</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       <b>r.li</b> - Landscape structure analysis package overview

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>r.li</u>  suite  is  a  toolset  for multiscale analysis of landscape structure. It aims at implementing
       metrics as found in external software for quantitative measures of  landscape  structure  like  FRAGSTATS
       (McGarigal and Marks 1995).

       The  <u>r.li</u> suite offers a set of patch and diversity indices.  It supports analysis of landscapes composed
       of a mosaic of patches, but, more generally, the modules work with any two-dimensional raster  map  whose
       cell values are integer (e.g., 1, 2) or floating point (e.g., 1.1, 3.2) values. The <u>g.gui.rlisetup</u> module
       has  options  for controlling the shape, size, number, and distribution of sampling areas used to collect
       information about the landscape structure.  Sampling area shapes can be the entire map or a moving window
       of square, rectangular or circular shape. The size  of  sampling  areas  can  be  changed,  so  that  the
       landscape  can  be  analyzed  at  a  variety  of  spatial  scales  simultaneously.  Sampling areas may be
       distributed across the landscape in a random, systematic, or stratified-random manner,  or  as  a  moving
       window.

       The <u>r.li</u> modules can calculate a number of measures that produce single values as output (e.g. mean patch
       size  in  the  sampling  area), as well as measures that produce a distribution of values as output (e.g.
       frequency distribution of patch sizes in the sampling area). The results are stored as raster maps.

       All modules require configuration file which can be created by the <u>g.gui.rlisetup</u> module which is  a  GUI
       tool  providing  a  convenient  way  to  set all necessary parameters. This file can be used repetitively
       saving user from the need to specify all parameters over and over again.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       The general procedure to calculate an index from a raster map is two-fold:

       <b>1</b>      run <u>g.gui.rlisetup</u>: create a configuration file selecting the parts of raster map to be  analyzed.
              This  file  allows  re-running  an  analysis  easily.  It  is  stored  on Windows in the directory
              C:\Users\userxy\AppData\Roaming\GRASS8\r.li\, on GNU/Linux in $HOME/.grass8/r.li/.

       <b>2</b>      run one or more of the <u>r.li.</u><b>[index]</b> modules (e.g., <u>r.li.</u><b>patchdensity</b>) to  calculate  the  selected
              index using on the areas selected on configuration file.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Calculate a patch density index on the entire ’geology’ raster map in the Spearfish sample dataset, using
       a 5x5 moving window:

       <b>1</b>      CREATE A NEW CONFIGURATION FILE

       <b>1.1</b>    run
              g.gui.rlisetup

       <b>1.2</b>    The main <u>g.gui.rlisetup</u> window is displayed, click on "New"

       <b>1.3</b>    The new configuration window is now displayed, enter the
              configuration file name (e.g., "my_conf", do not use absolute paths)
              Now the new configuration window is displayed.
              Enter the configuration file name (e.g., "my_conf", do not use absolute paths)
              and the name of raster map (e.g., "geology").
              The other fields are not needed for this configuration.

       <b>1.4</b>    Click on "Setup sampling frame", select "Whole map layer" and click "OK"

       <b>1.5</b>    Click on "Setup sampling areas", select "Moving window" and click "OK"

       <b>1.6</b>    Click on "Use keyboard to enter moving window dimension"

       <b>1.7</b>    Select "Rectangle" and enter 5 in the "height" and "width" fields

       <b>1.8</b>    Click on "Save settings"

       <b>1.9</b>    Close the <u>g.gui.rlisetup</u> window

       <b>2</b>      CALCULATE PATCHDENSITY INDEX

       <b>2.1</b>    set the region settings to the "geology" raster map:
              g.region raster=geology -p

       <b>2.2</b>    run <u>r.li.patchdensity</u>:
              r.li.patchdensity input=geology conf=my_conf out=patchdens

       The  resulting  patch density is stored in "patchdens" raster map.  You can verify the result for example
       with contour lines:
       r.contour in=patchdens out=patchdens step=5
       d.rast patchdens
       d.vect -c patchdens
       Note that if you want to run another index with the same area configuration, you  don’t  have  to  create
       another  configuration  file.   You  can  also  use  the same area configuration file on another map. The
       program rescale it automatically. For instance if you have selected a 5x5 sample area on  100x100  raster
       map, and you use the same configuration file on a 200x200 raster map, then the sample area is 10x10.

</pre><h4><b>ADDING</b> <b>NEW</b> <b>INDICES</b></h4><pre>
       New  indices  can  be  defined and implemented by any C programmer, without having to deal with all basic
       functions (IO etc.). The computing architecture and the functions are clearly separated, thus allowing an
       easy expandability. Every index is defined separately, placed in a directory along with its Makefile  for
       compiling  it  and a file &lt;module_name&gt;.html which describes the index including a simple example of use.
       See r.li.daemon for more information about development.
