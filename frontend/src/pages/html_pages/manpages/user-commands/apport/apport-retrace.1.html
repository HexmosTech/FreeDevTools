       apport-retrace - regenerate a crash report's stack trace

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>apport-retrace</b> [ <u>OPTIONS</u> ] <u>report</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>apport-retrace</b>  regenerates  the  stack  traces (both the simple and the threaded one) in an apport crash
       report from the included core dump. For this it figures out the  set  of  necessary  packages  and  their
       accompanying  debug  symbol packages, so that the regenerated stack trace will be fully symbolic and thus
       become much more useful for developers to fix the problem.

       <b>apport-retrace</b> has two modes: By default it will just regenerate traces based on the packages  which  are
       currently  installed  in the system, i. e. it assumes that all necessary debug symbols for the report are
       installed. When specifying the <b>-S</b> option, it creates a temporary "sandbox" and downloads and installs all
       necessary packages and debug symbols there. It will not do any changes to your  system.   This  does  not
       require  root  privileges,  as  it does not actually use the <b>chroot()</b> system call, but just supplies some
       "virtual root" options to <b>gdb</b>.

       If you regularly use <b>apport-retrace</b> in sandbox mode, it is highly recommended to use  a  permanent  cache
       directory (the <b>--cache</b> option).

       <u>report</u>  is  either  the  path  to  a .crash file, or a bug number. In the latter case, the information is
       downloaded from the bug report, and either one of the options <b>-g</b>, <b>-s</b>, or <b>-o</b> have to be  used  to  process
       the  report locally, or <b>--auth</b> needs to be specified to attach the resulting stack traces back to the bug
       report.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-c,</b> <b>--remove-core</b>
              Remove the core dump from the report after stack trace regeneration.  By default it is retained.

       <b>-g,</b> <b>--gdb</b>
              Start an interactive gdb session with the report's core dump.

       <b>-s,</b> <b>--stdout</b>
              Write the new stack traces to stdout instead of putting them back into the report.

       <b>-o</b> <u>FILE</u>, <b>--output=</b><u>FILE</u>
              Write modified report to given file instead of changing the original report.

       <b>-R,</b> <b>--rebuild-package-info</b>
              (Re-)generate Packages: and Dependenencies: fields before retracing. This is  particularly  useful
              if  you  want to retrace a .crash report before it was completed by running it through the UI data
              collection phase. However, this only works when you run this on the very  same  system  where  the
              crash happened.

       <b>-S</b> <u>CONFIG_DIR</u>, <b>--sandbox=</b><u>CONFIG_DIR</u>
              Build  a temporary sandbox and download/install the necessary packages and debug symbols in there;
              without this option it assumes that the necessary packages and debug symbols are already installed
              in the system.

              The argument points to the packaging  system  configuration  directory,  which  needs  to  have  a
              subdirectory  for  the  <b>DistroRelease</b>  field  in  the report (e. g. "config/Ubuntu 11.04/"), which
              contains the package system configuration.

              When using the apt/dpkg backend (Debian/Ubuntu based  distributions),  the  per-release  directory
              must  contain  an  apt  <b>sources.list</b>  file  with  package  sources  for  this  release,  plus  the
              corresponding debug symbol package repository.

              Sandboxing is not implemented for other (RPM based) backends right now.

              If <u>CONFIG_DIR</u> is "system", it will use the system configuration files, but will then only be  able
              to retrace crashes that happened on the currently running release.

       <b>-v,</b> <b>--verbose</b>
              Report download/install progress when installing packages in sandbox mode.

       <b>-p,</b> <b>--extra-package</b>
              Install an additional package for retracing into the sandbox. May be specified multiple times.

       <b>-C</b> <u>DIR</u>, <b>--cache=</b><u>DIR</u>
              Permanent  cache  directory  for  downloaded package indexes and packages for sandbox mode. If not
              specified all indexes and packages will have to be re-downloaded at each  run  of  <b>apport-retrace</b>.
              If you use sandbox mode regularly, using a permanent cache directory is highly recommended.

       <b>--sandbox-dir=</b><u>DIR</u>
              Permanent  directory  for  the sandbox of extracted packages. If not specified all cached packages
              will have to be re-extracted at each run of <b>apport-retrace</b>.  If you use  sandbox  mode  regularly,
              using a permanent cache directory is highly recommended.

       <b>-h,</b> <b>--help</b>
              Print a short help that documents all options.

       <b>--auth=</b><u>authfile</u>
              If  a bug number is given without any of the options <b>-g</b>, <b>-s</b>, or <b>-o</b>, then the retraced stack traces
              are attached to the bug.  Since this needs authentication, an authentication file  for  the  crash
              database  must  be  specified.  This could e. g. be the standard <b>cookies.txt</b> from Firefox' profile
              directory if the crash database uses cookie based authentication.

       <b>--confirm</b>
              Display retraced stack traces and ask for confirmation before uploading them to  the  bug  report.
              This option is ignored when retracing report files.

       <b>--duplicate-db=</b><u>dbfile</u>
              Specify  path to the duplicate check database (in SQLite format). The database will be created and
              initialized if it does not exist. If not specified, <b>apport-retrace</b> will not check for duplicates.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Reprocess recent local gedit crash report after the debug symbol packages have been  installed  into  the
       system, and show reprocessed stack traces on stdout:

           apport-retrace --stdout /var/crash/_usr_bin_gedit.1000.crash

       Build  a  sandbox  with all necessary packages and debug symbols, and start a gdb session on the report's
       core file:

           apport-retrace       --gdb       --sandbox       system        --cache        <a href="file:~/.cache/apport-retrace">~/.cache/apport-retrace</a>
           /var/crash/_usr_bin_gedit.1000.crash

       Download  crash  report  bug  #12345,  run  in  sandbox mode with local configuration files, and reupload
       updated traces to the bug (as neither -g or -s is specified):

           apport-retrace     --auth     <a href="file:~/.cache/apport/launchpad.credentials">~/.cache/apport/launchpad.credentials</a>     -S     <a href="file:~/retrace-conf/">~/retrace-conf/</a>     -C
           <a href="file:~/.cache/apport-retrace">~/.cache/apport-retrace</a> 12345
