</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       apport-cli, apport-gtk, apport-kde - Apport user interfaces for reporting problems

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>apport-cli</b>

       <b>apport-cli</b> [ <b>--save</b> <u>file</u> ] <u>symptom</u> | <u>pid</u> | <u>package</u> | <u>program</u> <u>path</u> | <u>.apport/.crash</u> <u>file</u>

       <b>apport-cli</b> <b>-f</b>

       <b>apport-cli</b> <b>-f</b> <b>-p</b> <u>package</u> <b>-P</b> <u>pid</u>

       <b>apport-cli</b> <b>-u</b> <u>report-number</u>

       Same options/arguments for <b>apport-gtk</b> and <b>apport-kde</b>.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>apport</b>  automatically  collects data from crashed processes and compiles a problem report in <u><a href="file:/var/crash/">/var/crash/</a></u>.
       This is a command line frontend for reporting those crashes to the developers. It can  also  be  used  to
       report bugs about packages or running processes.

       If  symptom  scripts are available, it can also be given the name of a symptom, or be called with just <b>-f</b>
       to display a list of known symptoms.

       When being called without any options, it processes the pending crash reports and offers to  report  them
       one by one. You can also display the entire report to see what is sent to the software developers.

       When  being  called  with exactly one argument and no option, <b>apport-cli</b> uses some heuristics to find out
       "what you mean" and reports a bug against the given symptom name, package name, program path, or PID.  If
       the  argument  is  a  <b>.crash</b>  or  <b>.apport</b>  file, it uploads the stored problem report to the bug tracking
       system.

       For desktop systems with a graphical user interface, you should consider installing the GTK or  KDE  user
       interface  (apport-gtk  or  apport-kde).  They accept the very same options and arguments.  <b>apport-cli</b> is
       mainly intended to be used on servers.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-f,</b> <b>--file-bug</b>
              Report a (non-crash) problem. If neither <b>--package</b>, <b>--symptom</b>, or <b>--pid</b>  are  specified,  then  it
              displays a list of available symptoms. If none are available, it aborts with an error.

              This  will  automatically  attach  information about your operating system and the package version
              etc. to the bug report, so that the developers have some important context.

       <b>-s</b> <u>symptom</u>, <b>--symptom</b>=<u>symptom</u>
              When being used in <b>--file-bug</b> mode, specify the symptom to report the problem about.

       <b>-p</b> <u>package</u>, <b>--package</b>=<u>package</u>
              When being used in <b>--file-bug</b> mode, specify the package to report the problem against.

       <b>-P</b> <u>pid</u>, <b>--pid</b>=<u>pid</u>
              When being used in <b>--file-bug</b> mode, specify the PID (process ID) of a running  program  to  report
              the problem against. This can be determined with e. g.  <b>ps</b> <b>-ux</b>.

       <b>-c</b> <u>report</u>, <b>--crash-file</b>=<u>report</u>
              Upload  a  previously  processed  stored report in an arbitrary file location.  This is useful for
              copying a crash report to a machine with internet connection and reporting it  from  there.  Files
              must end in <b>.crash</b> or <b>.apport</b>.

       <b>-u</b> <u>report-number</u>, <b>--update-report</b> <u>report-number</u>
              Run  apport  information collection on an already existing problem report. The affected package is
              taken from the report by default, but you can explicitly specify one  with  --package  to  collect
              information  for  a  different  package  (this  is  useful  if the report is assigned to the wrong
              package).

       <b>--save</b> <u>filename</u>
              In --file-bug mode, save the collected information into a file instead of reporting it. This  file
              can then be reported with --crash-file later on.

       <b>-w,</b> <b>--window</b>
              Point  and  click  at the application window against which you wish to report the bug. Apport will
              automatically find the package name and generate a report for you. This option  can  be  specially
              useful  in  situations  when you do not know the name of the package, or if the application window
              has stopped responding and you cannot report the problem from the "Help" menu of the application.

              This option is not supported on Wayland. Users running Wayland should use another option  such  as
              <b>-P</b> to specify the application.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>APPORT_IGNORE_OBSOLETE_PACKAGES</b>
              Apport  refuses  to  create  bug  reports if the package or any dependency is not current. If this
              environment variable is set, this check is waived. Experts who will thoroughly check the situation
              before filing a bug report can define this in their <b><a href="file:~/.bashrc">~/.bashrc</a></b>  or  temporarily  when  calling  the
              apport frontend (-cli, -gtk, or -kde).

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <b><a href="file:/usr/share/apport/symptoms/">/usr/share/apport/symptoms/</a>*.py</b>
              Symptom  scripts.  These  ask  a  set  of  interactive questions to determine the package which is
              responsible for a particular problem. (For some problems like sound or storage device related bugs
              there are many places where things can go wrong, and  it's  not  immediately  obvious  for  a  bug
              reporter where the problem is.)
