</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       upgrade_sympa_password, upgrade_sympa_password.pl - Upgrading password in database

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         upgrade_sympa_password.pl [--dry_run|-n] [--debug|d] [--verbose|v] [--config file ] [--cache file] [--nosavecache] [--noupdateuser] [--limit|l number_of_users]

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       --dry_run|-n
           Shows what will be done but won't really perform the upgrade process.

       --debug|-d
           Print additional debugging information during the upgrade process.

       --verbose|-v
           Print verbose logging messages during the upgrade process.

       --config FILENAME
           Specify  the  pathname  of  the  file  to  use as the Sympa configuration file.  Otherwise the system
           default Sympa configuration file is used.

       --cache FILENAME
           Specify the pathname of a file to store precalculated hashes for reuse  on  subsequent  runs  of  the
           script.

           The file is created if it does not already exist.

           This  option  is useful for large sites using intentionally expensive password hashes such as bcrypt.
           In that case this script can be run in advance to precalculate hashes and reduce  the  time  required
           during the final upgrade process.

           WARNING: since it contains sensitive password data, this file should be protected as carefully as any
           other password file, or a database dump of the Sympa user_table.

       --nosavecache
           Disables updates of the cache. The cache is still consulted if specified with "--cache".

       --noupdateuser
           Disables updates of the user_table. Mostly useful when precalculating user hashes in advance.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Versions  later  than  5.4  use  one-way  hashes instead of symmetric encryption to store passwords. This
       script upgrades any symmetric encrypted passwords it finds to one-way hashes.

       Versions later than 6.2.26 support bcrypt.

       This upgrade requires to  rewriting  user  password  entries  in  the  database.   This  upgrade  IS  NOT
       REVERSIBLE.

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       As of Sympa 3.1b.7, passwords may be stored into user table with encrypted form by reversible RC4.

       Sympa 5.4 or later uses MD5 one-way hash function to encode user passwords.

       Sympa 6.2.26 or later has optional support for bcrypt.

6.2.70                                             2023-01-26                          <u><a href="../man1/UPGRADE_SYMPA_PASSWORD.1.html">UPGRADE_SYMPA_PASSWORD</a></u>(1)
