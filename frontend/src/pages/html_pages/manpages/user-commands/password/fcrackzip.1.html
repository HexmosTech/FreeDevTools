       <u>fcrackzip</u> - a Free/Fast Zip Password Cracker

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>fcrackzip</b>  [-bDBchVvplum2] [--brute-force] [--dictionary] [--benchmark] [--charset characterset] [--help]
       [--validate] [--verbose] [--init-password string/path] [--length min-max] [--use-unzip]  [--method  name]
       [--modulo r/m] file...

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>fcrackzip</u> searches each zipfile given for encrypted files and tries to guess the password. All files must
       be encrypted with the same password, the more files you provide, the better.

   <b>OPTIONS</b>
       <b>-h,</b> <b>--help</b>
              Prints the version number and (hopefully) some helpful insights.

       <b>-v,</b> <b>--verbose</b>
              Each -v makes the program more verbose.

       <b>-b,</b> <b>--brute-force</b>
              Select brute force mode. This tries all possible combinations of the letters you specify.

       <b>-D,</b> <b>--dictionary</b>
              Select  dictionary  mode.  In  this  mode,  fcrackzip  will read passwords from a file, which must
              contain one password per line and should be alphabetically sorted (e.g. using <b><a href="../man1/sort.1.html">sort</a>(1)</b>).

       <b>-c,</b> <b>--charset</b> <b>characterset-specification</b>
              Select the characters to use in brute-force cracking. Must be one of

                a   include all lowercase characters [a-z]
                A   include all uppercase characters [A-Z]
                1   include the digits [0-9]
                !   include [!:$%&amp;/()=?{[]}+*~#]
                :   the following characters up to the end of the spe-
                    cification string are included in the character set.
                    This way you can include any character except binary
                    null (at least under unix).

              For example, a1:$% selects lowercase characters, digits and the dollar and percent signs.

       <b>-p,</b> <b>--init-password</b> <b>string</b>
              Set initial (starting) password for brute-force searching to <u>string</u>, or use the file with the name
              <u>string</u> to supply passwords for dictionary searching.

       <b>-l,</b> <b>--length</b> <b>min[-max]</b>
              Use an initial password of length min, and check all passwords  up  to  passwords  of  length  max
              (including). You can omit the max parameter.

       <b>-u,</b> <b>--use-unzip</b>
              Try  to decompress the first file by calling unzip with the guessed password. This weeds out false
              positives when not enough files have been given.

       <b>-m,</b> <b>--method</b> <b>name</b>
              Use method number "name" instead of the default cracking method. The switch <b>--help</b>  will  print  a
              list  of available methods. Use <b>--benchmark</b> to see which method does perform best on your machine.
              The <b>name</b> can also be the number of the method to use.

       <b>-2,</b> <b>--modulo</b> <b>r/m</b>
              Calculate only r/m of the password. Not yet supported.

       <b>-B,</b> <b>--benchmark</b>
              Make a small benchmark, the output is nearly meaningless.

       <b>-V,</b> <b>--validate</b>
              Make some basic checks whether the cracker works.

</pre><h4><b>ZIP</b> <b>PASSWORD</b> <b>BASICS</b></h4><pre>
       Have you ever mis-typed a password for unzip?  Unzip  reacted  pretty  fast  with  ´incorrect  password´,
       <u>without</u>  decrypting  the  whole file. While the encryption algorithm used by zip is relatively secure, PK
       made cracking easy by providing hooks  for  very  fast  password-checking,  directly  in  the  zip  file.
       Understanding these is crucial to zip password cracking:

       For  each  password  that  is  tried,  the first twelve bytes of the file are decrypted. Depending on the
       version of zip used to encrypt the file (more on that later), the first ten or eleven bytes  are  random,
       followed  by  one  or  two  bytes  whose  values  are  stored  elsewhere  in the zip file, i.e. are known
       beforehand. If these last bytes don't have the correct (known) value, the password is  definitely  wrong.
       If  the bytes are correct, the password <u>might</u> be correct, but the only method to find out is to unzip the
       file and compare the uncompressed length and crc´s.

       Earlier versions of pkzip (1.xx) (and, incidentally, many zip clones for other operating systems!) stored
       two known bytes. Thus the error rate was roughly 1/2^16 =  0.01%.  PKWARE  ´improved´  (interesting  what
       industry  calls  improved) the security of their format by only including one byte, so the possibility of
       false passwords is now raised to 0.4%. Unfortunately, there is no real way to distinguish one  byte  from
       two byte formats, so we have to be conservative.

</pre><h4><b>BRUTE</b> <b>FORCE</b> <b>MODE</b></h4><pre>
       By  default,  brute  force starts at the given starting password, and successively tries all combinations
       until they are exhausted, printing all passwords that it  detects,  together  with  a  rough  correctness
       indicator.

       The  starting  password  given  by  the  <u>-p</u>  switch  determines the length.  fcrackzip will not currently
       increase the password length automatically, unless the <u>-l</u> switch is used.

</pre><h4><b>DICTIONARY</b> <b>MODE</b></h4><pre>
       This mode is similar to brute force mode, but instead of  generating  passwords  using  a  given  set  of
       characters  and  a  length,  the passwords will be read from a file that you have to specify using the <u>-p</u>
       switch.

</pre><h4><b>CP</b> <b>MASK</b></h4><pre>
       A CP mask is a method to obscure images or parts of images using a password.  These obscured  images  can
       be restored even when saved as JPEG files. In most of these files the password is actually hidden and can
       be  decoded easily (using one of the many available viewer and masking programs, e.g. xv). If you convert
       the image the password, however, is lost. The <b>cpmask</b> crack  method  can  be  used  to  brute-force  these
       images.  Instead  of  a zip file you supply the obscured part (and nothing else) of the image in the <b>PPM</b>-
       Image Format (<b>xv</b> and other viewers can easily do this).

       The <b>cpmask</b> method can only cope with password composed of uppercase letters, so be  sure  to  supply  the
       <b>--charset</b> <b>A</b> or equivalent option, together with a suitable initialization password.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>fcrackzip</b> <b>-c</b> <b>a</b> <b>-p</b> <b>aaaaaa</b> <b>sample.zip</b>
              checks  the  encrypted  files  in  sample.zip  for all lowercase 6 character passwords (aaaaaa ...
              abaaba ... ghfgrg ... zzzzzz).

       <b>fcrackzip</b> <b>--method</b> <b>cpmask</b> <b>--charset</b> <b>A</b> <b>--init</b> <b>AAAA</b> <b>test.ppm</b>
              checks the obscured image <b>test.ppm</b> for all four character passwords.

       <b>fcrackzip</b> <b>-D</b> <b>-p</b> <b>passwords.txt</b> <b>sample.zip</b>
              check for every password listed in the file <b>passwords.txt</b>.

</pre><h4><b>PERFORMANCE</b></h4><pre>
       <u>fzc</u>, which seems to be widely used as a fast password cracker, claims to make 204570 checks per second on
       my machine (measured under plain dos w/o memory manager).

       <u>fcrackzip</u>, being written in C and not in assembler, naturally is slower. Measured on  a  slightly  loaded
       unix (same machine), it´s 12 percent slower (the compiler used was <u>pgcc</u>, from <b><a href="http://www.gcc.ml.org/">http://www.gcc.ml.org/</a></b>).

       To  remedy  this  a  bit,  I converted small parts of the encryption core to x86 assembler (it will still
       compile on non x86 machines), and now it´s about 4-12 percent  faster  than  <u>fzc</u>  (again,  the  <u>fcrackzip</u>
       performance  was  measured  under  a multitasking os, so there are inevitably some meaurement errors), so
       there shouldn't be a tempting reason to switch to other programs.

       Further improvements are definitely possible: <u>fzc</u> took 4 years to get into  shape,  while  fcrackzip  was
       hacked  together  in  under  10  hours. And not to forget you have the source, while other programs (like
       <u>fzc</u>), even come as an <u>encrypted</u> <u>.exe</u> file (maybe because their programmers are  afraid  of  other  people
       could having a look at their lack of programming skills?  nobody knows...)

</pre><h4><b>RATIONALE</b></h4><pre>
       The  reason  I  wrote  <u>fcrackzip</u>  was  <b>NOT</b>  to  have  the fastest zip cracker available, but to provide a
       <u>portable</u>, <u>free</u> (thus <u>extensible</u>), but still <u>fast</u> zip password cracker. I was really pissed of  with  that
       dumb,  nonextendable  zipcrackers  that  were  either  slow,  were  too  limited,  or wouldn't run in the
       background (say, under unix). (And you can't run them on your superfast 600Mhz Alpha).

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       No automatic unzip checking.

       Stop/resume facility is missing.

       Should be able to distinguish between files with 16 bit stored CRC´s and 8 bit stored CRC´s.

       The benchmark does not work on all systems.

       It's still early alpha.

       Method "cpmask" only accepts ppms.

       Could be faster.
