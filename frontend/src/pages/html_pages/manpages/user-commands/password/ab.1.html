</pre><h4><b>SUMMARY</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ab</b>  is  a  tool for benchmarking your Apache Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) server. It is designed to
       give you an impression of how your current Apache installation performs. This especially  shows  you  how
       many requests per second your Apache installation is capable of serving.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-A</b> <u>auth-username</u>:<u>password</u>
              Supply  BASIC Authentication credentials to the server. The username and password are separated by
              a single <b>:</b> and sent on the wire base64 encoded. The string  is  sent  regardless  of  whether  the
              server needs it (<u>i.e.</u>, has sent an 401 authentication needed).

       <b>-b</b> <u>windowsize</u>
              Size of TCP send/receive buffer, in bytes.

       <b>-B</b> <u>local-address</u>
              Address to bind to when making outgoing connections.

       <b>-c</b> <u>concurrency</u>
              Number of multiple requests to perform at a time. Default is one request at a time.

       <b>-C</b> <u>cookie-name</u>=<u>value</u>
              Add  a  <b>Cookie:</b>  line  to the request. The argument is typically in the form of a <u>name</u>=<u>value</u> pair.
              This field is repeatable.

       <b>-d</b>     Do not display the "percentage served within XX [ms] table". (legacy support).

       <b>-e</b> <u>csv-file</u>
              Write a Comma separated value (CSV) file which contains for each percentage (from 1% to 100%)  the
              time  (in  milliseconds)  it  took  to serve that percentage of the requests. This is usually more
              useful than the 'gnuplot' file; as the results are already 'binned'.

       <b>-E</b> <u>client-certificate-file</u>
              When connecting to an  SSL  website,  use  the  provided  client  certificate  in  PEM  format  to
              authenticate  with the server. The file is expected to contain the client certificate, followed by
              intermediate certificates, followed by the private key. Available in 2.4.36 and later.

       <b>-f</b> <u>protocol</u>
              Specify SSL/TLS protocol (SSL2, SSL3, TLS1, TLS1.1, TLS1.2, or ALL).  TLS1.1  and  TLS1.2  support
              available in 2.4.4 and later.

       <b>-g</b> <u>gnuplot-file</u>
              Write  all  measured  values  out  as a 'gnuplot' or TSV (Tab separate values) file. This file can
              easily be imported into packages like Gnuplot, IDL, Mathematica, Igor or even  Excel.  The  labels
              are on the first line of the file.

       <b>-h</b>     Display usage information.

       <b>-H</b> <u>custom-header</u>
              Append extra headers to the request. The argument is typically in the form of a valid header line,
              containing a colon-separated field-value pair (<u>i.e.</u>, <b>"Accept-Encoding:</b> <b>zip/zop;8bit"</b>).

       <b>-i</b>     Do <b>HEAD</b> requests instead of <b>GET</b>.

       <b>-k</b>     Enable  the  HTTP  KeepAlive  feature,  <u>i.e.</u>,  perform  multiple requests within one HTTP session.
              Default is no KeepAlive.

       <b>-l</b>     Do not report errors if the length of the responses is  not  constant.  This  can  be  useful  for
              dynamic pages. Available in 2.4.7 and later.

       <b>-m</b> <u>HTTP-method</u>
              Custom HTTP method for the requests. Available in 2.4.10 and later.

       <b>-n</b> <u>requests</u>
              Number  of  requests  to  perform  for  the benchmarking session. The default is to just perform a
              single request which usually leads to non-representative benchmarking results.

       <b>-p</b> <u>POST-file</u>
              File containing data to POST. Remember to also set <b>-T</b>.

       <b>-P</b> <u>proxy-auth-username</u>:<u>password</u>
              Supply BASIC Authentication credentials to  a  proxy  en-route.  The  username  and  password  are
              separated  by  a  single  <b>:</b>  and sent on the wire base64 encoded. The string is sent regardless of
              whether the proxy needs it (<u>i.e.</u>, has sent an 407 proxy authentication needed).

       <b>-q</b>     When processing more than 150 requests, <b>ab</b> outputs a progress count on <b>stderr</b>  every  10%  or  100
              requests or so. The <b>-q</b> flag will suppress these messages.

       <b>-r</b>     Don't exit on socket receive errors.

       <b>-s</b> <u>timeout</u>
              Maximum number of seconds to wait before the socket times out. Default is 30 seconds. Available in
              2.4.4 and later.

       <b>-S</b>     Do  not  display  the median and standard deviation values, nor display the warning/error messages
              when the average and median are more than one or two  times  the  standard  deviation  apart.  And
              default to the min/avg/max values. (legacy support).

       <b>-t</b> <u>timelimit</u>
              Maximum  number of seconds to spend for benchmarking. This implies a <b>-n</b> <b>50000</b> internally. Use this
              to benchmark the server within a fixed total amount of time. Per default there is no timelimit.

       <b>-T</b> <u>content-type</u>
              Content-type header to use for POST/PUT data, eg.  <b>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</b>.  Default  is
              <b>text/plain</b>.

       <b>-u</b> <u>PUT-file</u>
              File containing data to PUT. Remember to also set <b>-T</b>.

       <b>-v</b> <u>verbosity</u>
              Set verbosity level - <b>4</b> and above prints information on headers, <b>3</b> and above prints response codes
              (404, 200, etc.), <b>2</b> and above prints warnings and info.

       <b>-V</b>     Display version number and exit.

       <b>-w</b>     Print out results in HTML tables. Default table is two columns wide, with a white background.

       <b>-x</b> <u>&lt;table&gt;-attributes</u>
              String to use as attributes for <b>&lt;table&gt;</b>. Attributes are inserted <b>&lt;table</b> <u>here</u> &gt;.

       <b>-X</b> <u>proxy</u>[:<u>port</u>]
              Use a proxy server for the requests.

       <b>-y</b> <u>&lt;tr&gt;-attributes</u>
              String to use as attributes for <b>&lt;tr&gt;</b>.

       <b>-z</b> <u>&lt;td&gt;-attributes</u>
              String to use as attributes for <b>&lt;td&gt;</b>.

       <b>-Z</b> <u>ciphersuite</u>
              Specify SSL/TLS cipher suite (See openssl ciphers)

</pre><h4><b>OUTPUT</b></h4><pre>
       The following list describes the values returned by <b>ab</b>:

       Server Software
              The  value,  if  any,  returned  in  the <u>server</u> HTTP header of the first successful response. This
              includes all characters in the header from beginning to the point a character with  decimal  value
              of 32 (most notably: a space or CR/LF) is detected.

       Server Hostname
              The DNS or IP address given on the command line

       Server Port
              The  port to which ab is connecting. If no port is given on the command line, this will default to
              80 for http and 443 for https.

       SSL/TLS Protocol
              The protocol parameters negotiated between the client and server. This will only be printed if SSL
              is used.

       Document Path
              The request URI parsed from the command line string.

       Document Length
              This is the size in bytes of the first successfully returned  document.  If  the  document  length
              changes during testing, the response is considered an error.

       Concurrency Level
              The number of concurrent clients used during the test

       Time taken for tests
              This  is  the  time taken from the moment the first socket connection is created to the moment the
              last response is received

       Complete requests
              The number of successful responses received

       Failed requests
              The number of requests that were considered a failure. If the number is greater than zero, another
              line will be printed showing the number of  requests  that  failed  due  to  connecting,  reading,
              incorrect content length, or exceptions.

       Write errors
              The number of errors that failed during write (broken pipe).

       Non-2xx responses
              The  number  of responses that were not in the 200 series of response codes. If all responses were
              200, this field is not printed.

       Keep-Alive requests
              The number of connections that resulted in Keep-Alive requests

       Total body sent
              If configured to send data as part of the test, this is the total number of bytes sent during  the
              tests. This field is omitted if the test did not include a body to send.

       Total transferred
              The total number of bytes received from the server. This number is essentially the number of bytes
              sent over the wire.

       HTML transferred
              The  total  number of document bytes received from the server. This number excludes bytes received
              in HTTP headers

       Requests per second
              This is the number of requests per second. This value is the result  of  dividing  the  number  of
              requests by the total time taken

       Time per request
              The  average  time spent per request. The first value is calculated with the formula <b>concurrency</b> <b>*</b>
              <b>timetaken</b> <b>*</b> <b>1000</b> <b>/</b> <b>done</b> while the second value is calculated with the formula <b>timetaken</b> <b>*</b>  <b>1000</b>  <b>/</b>
              <b>done</b>

       Transfer rate
              The rate of transfer as calculated by the formula <b>totalread</b> <b>/</b> <b>1024</b> <b>/</b> <b>timetaken</b>

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       There  are  various  statically  declared  buffers of fixed length. Combined with the lazy parsing of the
       command line arguments, the response headers from the server and other external inputs, this  might  bite
       you.

       It  does  not implement HTTP/1.x fully; only accepts some 'expected' forms of responses. The rather heavy
       use of <b><a href="../man3/strstr.3.html">strstr</a>(3)</b> shows up top in profile, which might indicate a performance  problem;  <u>i.e.</u>,  you  would
       measure the <b>ab</b> performance rather than the server's.
