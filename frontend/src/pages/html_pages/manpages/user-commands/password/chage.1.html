       chage - change user password expiry information

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>

       <b>chage</b> [<u>options</u>] <u>LOGIN</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>chage</b> command changes the number of days between password changes and the date of the last password
       change. This information is used by the system to determine when a user must change their password.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The options which apply to the <b>chage</b> command are:

       <b>-d</b>, <b>--lastday</b> <u>LAST_DAY</u>
           Set the number of days since January 1st, 1970 when the password was last changed. The date may also
           be expressed in the format YYYY-MM-DD (or the format more commonly used in your area). If the
           <u>LAST_DAY</u> is set to <u>0</u> the user is forced to change his password on the next log on.

       <b>-E</b>, <b>--expiredate</b> <u>EXPIRE_DATE</u>
           Set the date or number of days since January 1, 1970 on which the user's account will no longer be
           accessible. The date may also be expressed in the format YYYY-MM-DD (or the format more commonly used
           in your area). A user whose account is locked must contact the system administrator before being able
           to use the system again.

           For example the following can be used to set an account to expire in 180 days:

                        chage -E $(date -d +180days +%Y-%m-%d)

           Passing the number <u>-1</u> as the <u>EXPIRE_DATE</u> will remove an account expiration date.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
           Display help message and exit.

       <b>-i</b>, <b>--iso8601</b>
           When printing dates, use YYYY-MM-DD format.

       <b>-I</b>, <b>--inactive</b> <u>INACTIVE</u>
           Set the number of days of inactivity after a password has expired before the account is locked. The
           <u>INACTIVE</u> option is the number of days of inactivity. A user whose account is locked must contact the
           system administrator before being able to use the system again.

           Passing the number <u>-1</u> as the <u>INACTIVE</u> will remove an account's inactivity.

       <b>-l</b>, <b>--list</b>
           Show account aging information.

       <b>-m</b>, <b>--mindays</b> <u>MIN_DAYS</u>
           Set the minimum number of days between password changes to <u>MIN_DAYS</u>. A value of zero for this field
           indicates that the user may change their password at any time.

       <b>-M</b>, <b>--maxdays</b> <u>MAX_DAYS</u>
           Set the maximum number of days during which a password is valid. When <u>MAX_DAYS</u> plus <u>LAST_DAY</u> is less
           than the current day, the user will be required to change their password before being able to use
           their account. This occurrence can be planned for in advance by use of the <b>-W</b> option, which provides
           the user with advance warning.

           Passing the number <u>-1</u> as <u>MAX_DAYS</u> will remove checking a password's validity.

       <b>-R</b>, <b>--root</b> <u>CHROOT_DIR</u>
           Apply changes in the <u>CHROOT_DIR</u> directory and use the configuration files from the <u>CHROOT_DIR</u>
           directory. Only absolute paths are supported.

       <b>-P</b>, <b>--prefix</b> <u>PREFIX_DIR</u>
           Apply changes to configuration files under the root filesystem found under the directory <u>PREFIX_DIR</u>.
           This option does not chroot and is intended for preparing a cross-compilation target. Some
           limitations: NIS and LDAP users/groups are not verified. PAM authentication is using the host files.
           No SELINUX support.

       <b>-W</b>, <b>--warndays</b> <u>WARN_DAYS</u>
           Set the number of days of warning before a password change is required. The <u>WARN_DAYS</u> option is the
           number of days prior to the password expiring that a user will be warned their password is about to
           expire.

       If none of the options are selected, <b>chage</b> operates in an interactive fashion, prompting the user with
       the current values for all of the fields. Enter the new value to change the field, or leave the line
       blank to use the current value. The current value is displayed between a pair of <u>[</u> <u>]</u> marks.

</pre><h4><b>NOTE</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>chage</b> program requires a shadow password file to be available.

       The chage program will report only the information from the shadow password file. This implies that
       configuration from other sources (e.g. LDAP or empty password hash field from the passwd file) that
       affect the user's login will not be shown in the chage output.

       The <b>chage</b> program will also not report any inconsistency between the shadow and passwd files (e.g.
       missing x in the passwd file). The <b>pwck</b> can be used to check for this kind of inconsistencies.

       The <b>chage</b> command is restricted to the root user, except for the <b>-l</b> option, which may be used by an
       unprivileged user to determine when their password or account is due to expire.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       The following configuration variables in <a href="file:/etc/login.defs">/etc/login.defs</a> change the behavior of this tool:

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <a href="file:/etc/passwd">/etc/passwd</a>
           User account information.

       <a href="file:/etc/shadow">/etc/shadow</a>
           Secure user account information.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>VALUES</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>chage</b> command exits with the following values:

       <u>0</u>
           success

       <u>1</u>
           permission denied

       <u>2</u>
           invalid command syntax

       <u>15</u>
           can't find the shadow password file
