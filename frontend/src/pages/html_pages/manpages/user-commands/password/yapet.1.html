       yapet - text based password manager

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>yapet</b> [[-c] | [-h] | [-V] [[-i] | [-r <u>rcfile</u>]] [[-s] | [-S]] [-t <u>sec</u>]] [<u>filename</u>] v == DESCRIPTION

       <b>yapet</b> provides a text user interface for storing passwords and associated information (referred to as
       password records) in files encrypted on disk. A password record is comprised of a record name, host name,
       user name, password, and comment. A master password is required to encrypt/decrypt the password records
       in a given file. <b>yapet</b> does not impose a limit of password records per file.

       Files created by <b>yapet</b> always have the suffix <u>.pet</u>. Also, if a file is loaded using the command line,
       <b>yapet</b> appends the suffix <u>.pet</u> to the filename unless the filename includes this suffix already. By
       default, <b>yapet</b> refuses to load files not having a file mode of 0600. This behavior can be changed by
       providing the <b>-s</b> option when starting <b>yapet</b> or using a configuration file (see <b><a href="../man5/yapet_config.5.html">yapet_config</a></b>(5), and
       OPTIONS).

       After loading a file, the record name of each password record is displayed in a list. Existing password
       records can be opened by selecting them and pressing <b>Enter</b>. By default, existing password records are
       opened in read-only mode to avoid accidental changes. Pressing <b>Ctrl+r</b> toggles between read-only and edit
       mode.

       On terminals supporting colors, the password is hidden if the password record dialog is in read-only
       mode. The password can be made visible, by either going to edit mode (<b>Ctrl+r</b>), or by pressing <b>Ctrl+t</b>.

       <b>yapet</b> relies on OpenSSL for encryption and decryption of password records. Starting with YAPET 2.0 the
       cipher used is AES-256. YAPET 2.0 will read and write pre YAPET 2.0 files. Pre YAPET 2.0 files are
       converted to YAPET 2.0 files when changing the master password. Once converted, the files can no longer
       be read by pre YAPET 2.0 versions.

       Other features of <b>yapet</b> are:

       •   Screen lock after a certain amount of inactivity when password file is loaded (see also
           <b><a href="../man5/yapet_config.5.html">yapet_config</a></b>(5) and OPTIONS).

       •   Password records opened in read-only mode (default) hide the password. Toggling into edit mode
           reveals the password (see Password Record Dialog Keys).

       •   Import of CSV files (see <b><a href="../man1/csv2yapet.1.html">csv2yapet</a></b>(1)).

       •   Export of YAPET files to CSV files (see <b><a href="../man1/yapet2csv.1.html">yapet2csv</a></b>(1)).

       •   Integrated password generator.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The following options are supported:

       <b>-c</b>
           Show copyright information.

       <b>-h</b>
           Print help text.

       <b>-i</b>
           Do not read the configuration file.

       <b>-r</b> <u>rcfile</u>
           Read the configuration file specified by <u>rcfile</u>. If this option is not given, the default
           configuration file read is <u>$HOME/.yapet</u> unless <b>-i</b> is specified.

       <b>-s</b>
           Disable the check for the owner and file mode when loading files. Without this option, <b>yapet</b> checks
           password files for having the same owner as the user running <b>yapet</b> and verifies that the file mode is
           strictly 0600. If one of these conditions are not met, <b>yapet</b> refuses to load the file.
           Providing this options disables those checks and <b>yapet</b> will load files with owners other than the
           process owner of <b>yapet</b> and file modes different from 0600. New files saved while this option is
           active will have the file mode set according to <b><a href="../man2/umask.2.html">umask</a></b>(2).

       <b>-S</b>
           Enable the check for the owner and file mode when loading files. This option makes <b>yapet</b> to load
           password files having the owner set to the process owner of <b>yapet</b> and the file mode strictly set to
           0600 only. If one of these conditions are not met, <b>yapet</b> refuses to load the file.
           New files saved while this option is active will have the file mode set to 0600. This is the default
           mode.

       <b>-t</b> <u>sec</u>
           Set the timeout until the screen is locked to <u>sec</u> seconds. The minimum time allowed is 10 seconds. If
           a smaller value is provided, the timeout will be set to 10 seconds.

           Default: 10 min.

       <b>-V</b>
           Show version of <b>yapet</b>.

       <u>filename</u>
           The file to open upon invocation of <b>yapet</b>. If the file does not exist, <b>yapet</b> asks whether it should
           be created. Files created by <b>yapet</b> always have the suffix <u>.pet</u>.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <u>$HOME/.yapet</u>
           The per-user configuration file. If existing, options are read from this file but can be overridden
           by the command line options. Processing of this file can be disabled by invoking <b>yapet</b> with the <b>-i</b>
           option. Refer to the <b><a href="../man5/yapet_config.5.html">yapet_config</a></b>(5) for an explanation of the per-user configuration file.
