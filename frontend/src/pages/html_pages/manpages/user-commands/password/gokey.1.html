</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       gokey - A simple vaultless password manager in Go

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>gokey</b> [<b>OPTIONS</b>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>gokey</b>  is a password manager, which does not require a password vault.  Instead of storing your passwords
       in a vault it derives your password on the fly from your master password and supplied <u>realm</u>  string  (for
       example, resource URL).  This way you do not have to manage, backup or sync your password vault (or trust
       its management to a third party) as your passwords are available immediately anywhere.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-o</b> <u>output_path</u>
              by default <b>gokey</b> outputs generated data to <u>stdout</u>

       <b>-P</b> <u>/path/to/password</u>
              path  to  master  password  file which will be used to generate other passwords/keys or to encrypt
              seed file (see <u>Modes</u> <u>of</u> <u>operation</u> below, if no master password or master password file is  provid‐
              ed, <b>gokey</b> will ask for it interactively)

       <b>-p</b> <u>master_password</u>
              master  password  which will be used to generate other passwords/keys or to encrypt seed file (see
              <u>Modes</u> <u>of</u> <u>operation</u> below, if no master password or master password file is  provided,  <b>gokey</b>  will
              ask for it interactively)

       <b>-r</b> <u>password/key_realm</u>
              any string which identifies requested password/key, most likely key usage or resource URL

       <b>-s</b> <u>path_to_seed_file</u>
              needed, if you want to use seed file instead of master password as an entropy source (see <u>Modes</u> <u>of</u>
              <u>operation</u> below); can be generated with <b>-t</b> <u>seed</u> flag as described below

       <b>-skip</b> <u>number_of_bytes</u>
              number of bytes to skip when reading seed file

       <b>-u</b>     <b>UNSAFE</b>, allow generating keys without using a seed file (see <u>Modes</u> <u>of</u> <u>operation</u> below)

       <b>-t</b> <u>password/key_type</u>
              requested password/key output type.  Supported password/key types:

              • <u>pass</u> - default, generates a password

              • <u>seed</u> - generates a seed file, which can be used with <b>-s</b> option later

              • <u>raw</u> - generates 32 random bytes (can be used as a symmetric key)

              • <u>ec256</u> - generates ECC P-256 private key

              • <u>ec384</u> - generates ECC P-384 private key

              • <u>ec521</u> - generates ECC P-521 private key

              • <u>rsa2048</u> - generates 2048-bit RSA private key

              • <u>rsa4096</u> - generates 4096-bit RSA private key

              • <u>x25519</u> - generates x25519 (also known as curve25519) ECC private key

              • <u>ed25519</u> - generates ed25519 ECC private key

       <b>-l</b> <u>length</u>
              number of characters in the generated password or number of bytes in the generated raw stream (de‐
              fault 10 for “pass” type and 32 for “raw” type)

</pre><h4><b>MODES</b> <b>OF</b> <b>OPERATION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>gokey</b>  can  generate passwords and cryptographic private keys (ECC and RSA keys are currently supported).
       However, without any additional options specified it uses your master password as a single source of  en‐
       tropy  for  generated  data.  For passwords it is acceptable most of the time, but keys usually have much
       higher entropy requirements.

       For cases, where higher entropy is required for generated passwords/keys, <b>gokey</b> can use a  seed  file  (a
       blob with random data) instead of the master password as a source of entropy.

   <b>Simple</b> <b>mode</b> <b>(without</b> <b>a</b> <b>seed</b> <b>file)</b>
       In  simple  mode  passwords are derived directly from your master password and the realm string.  That is
       each unique combination of a master password and a realm string will produce a unique password.

       For example, if your master password is <u>super-secret-master-password</u> and you want to generate a  password
       for <u>example.com</u>, you would invoke <b>gokey</b> like

              gokey -p super-secret-master-password -r example.com

       If you need a password for a different resource, <u>example2.com</u>, you would change the real string

              gokey -p super-secret-master-password -r example2.com

       This  way  you  need to remember only your master password and you can always recreate passwords for your
       services/resources.

       <u>NOTE</u>: In this mode generated passwords are as strong as your master password,  so  do  have  your  master
       password  strong  enough.   You can also derive private keys from your master password, but keep in mind,
       that these keys will have low entropy.  That is why it is considered unsafe, so <b>gokey</b> does not  allow  it
       by  default.   If  you’re  <u><b>really</b></u>  know what you are doing, you can override this default by supplying <b>-u</b>
       flag.

   <b>Using</b> <b>a</b> <b>seed</b> <b>file</b>
       If you plan to generate not only passwords, but also private keys or you want to have your passwords/keys
       with higher entropy, you can use a seed file instead of the master password.  You still need to supply  a
       master  password, when invoking <b>gokey</b>, but it will be used only to protect the seed file itself; all gen‐
       erated passwords/keys will be derived from the data in the seed file.  <b>gokey</b> uses  seed  files  protected
       (encrypted)  with  your  master  password, so it is reasonably safe to store/backup seed files to a third
       party location, such as Google Drive or Dropbox.

       To generate an encrypted seed file, use

              gokey -p super-secret-master-password -t seed -o seedfile

       This will create a seed file <u>seedfile</u> with 256 bytes  of  random  data.   The  data  is  encrypted  using
       AES-256-GCM mode and <u>super-secret-master-password</u> as a key.

       Then, to generate EC-256 private key for <u>example.com</u>, use

              gokey -p super-secret-master-password -s seedfile -r example.com -t ec256
