</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       sshpass - noninteractive ssh password provider

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>sshpass</b> [<b>-f</b><u>filename</u>|<b>-d</b><u>num</u>|<b>-p</b><u>password</u>|<b>-e[</b><u>env_var</u>]] [<u>options</u>] <u>command</u> <u>arguments</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This manual page documents the <b>sshpass</b> command.

       <b>sshpass</b>  is  a  utility  designed  for  running  <b>ssh</b> using the mode referred to as "keyboard-interactive"
       password authentication, but in non-interactive mode.

       ssh uses direct TTY access to make sure that the password is indeed issued  by  an  interactive  keyboard
       user.  Sshpass  runs  ssh in a dedicated tty, fooling it into thinking it is getting the password from an
       interactive user.

       The command to run is specified after sshpass' own options. Typically it will be  "ssh"  with  arguments,
       but  it  can  just  as  well be any other command. The password prompt used by ssh is, however, currently
       hardcoded into sshpass.

</pre><h4><b>Options</b></h4><pre>
       If no option is given, sshpass reads the password from the standard input. The user may give at most  one
       alternative source for the password:

       <b>-p</b><u>password</u>
              The   password   is  given  on  the  command  line.  Please  note  the  section  titled  "<b>SECURITY</b>
              <b>CONSIDERATIONS</b>".

       <b>-f</b><u>filename</u>
              The password is the first line of the file <u>filename</u>.

       <b>-d</b><u>number</u>
              <u>number</u> is a file descriptor inherited by sshpass from the runner. The password is  read  from  the
              open file descriptor.

       <b>-e</b>[<u>env_var</u>]
              The  password  is  taken  from  an  environment  variable.  If  <u>env_var</u>  is  supplied, that is the
              environment variable used. If not, the password is taken from the variable <b>SSHPASS</b>.

       <b>-P</b>     Set the password prompt. Sshpass searched for this prompt in the program's output to the TTY as an
              indication when to send the password. By default sshpass looks for the  string  "assword:"  (which
              matches  both  "Password:" and "password:"). If your client's prompt does not fall under either of
              these, you can override the default with this option.

       <b>-v</b>     Be verbose. sshpass will output to stderr information that  should  help  debug  cases  where  the
              connection hangs, seemingly for no good reason.

</pre><h4><b>SECURITY</b> <b>CONSIDERATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       First  and  foremost,  users of sshpass should realize that ssh's insistance on only getting the password
       interactively is not without reason. It is close to impossible to securely store the password, and  users
       of sshpass should consider whether ssh's public key authentication provides the same end-user experience,
       while involving less hassle and being more secure.

       The  -p  option  should be considered the least secure of all of sshpass's options.  All system users can
       see the password in the command line with a simple "ps" command. Sshpass makes a minimal attempt to  hide
       the  password,  but  such  attempts  are  doomed  to  create race conditions without actually solving the
       problem. Users of sshpass are encouraged to use one of the other password passing techniques,  which  are
       all more secure.

       In  particular,  people  writing programs that are meant to communicate the password programmatically are
       encouraged to use an anonymous pipe and pass the pipe's reading end to sshpass using the -d option.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUES</b></h4><pre>
       As with any other program, sshpass returns 0 on success. In case of failure, the following  return  codes
       are used:

       1      Invalid command line argument

       2      Conflicting arguments given

       3      General runtime error

       4      Unrecognized response from ssh (parse error)

       5      Invalid/incorrect password

       6      Host public key is unknown. sshpass exits without confirming the new key.

       7      IP public key changed. sshpass exits without confirming the new key.

       In addition, ssh might be complaining about a man in the middle attack. This complaint does not go to the
       tty.  In other words, even with sshpass, the error message from ssh is printed to standard error. In such
       a case ssh's return code is reported back. This is typically an unimaginative (and non-informative) "255"
       for all error cases.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Run rsync over SSH using password authentication, passing the password on the command line:

       rsync --rsh='sshpass -p 12345 ssh -l test' host.example.com:path .

       To do the same from a bourne shell script in a marginally less exposed way:

       SSHPASS=12345 rsync --rsh='sshpass -e ssh -l test' host.example.com:path .

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Sshpass utilizes the <b><a href="../man7/pty.7.html">pty</a></b>(7) interface to control the TTY for ssh. This interface, at least on Linux,  has
       a  misfeature where if no slave file descriptors are open, the master pty returns <b>EIO</b>. This is the normal
       behavior, except a slave pty may be born at any point by  a  program  opening  <b>/dev/tty</b>.  This  makes  it
       impossible to reliably wait for events without consuming 100% of the CPU.

       Over the various versions different approaches were attempted at solving this problem.  Any given version
       of sshpass is released with the belief that it is working, but experience has shown that these things do,
       occasionally,  break.  This  happened  with OpenSSH version 5.6.  As of this writing, it is believed that
       sshpass is, again, working properly.

       It seems that HPUX has some non Posix compliant ideas how controlling TTY is detached.  sshpass  may  not
       work properly on that platform.
