</pre><h4><b>NAME</b> <b>fccexam</b> <b>-</b> <b>Study</b> <b>guide</b> <b>for</b> <b>USA</b> <b>FCC</b> <b>commercial</b> <b>radio</b> <b>license</b> <b>examinations.</b></h4><pre>
</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>fccexam</b> <b>[option]</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>fccexam</b>  presents  questions  in  random  order  from the selected question pool, and terminates when all
       questions have been answered correctly. The session may be interrupted with ^C, and resumed later.

       Some questions refer to figures. The figures for the selected question pool are displayed in  a  separate
       window using $HTML_VIEWER, if it is executable. If $HTML_VIEWER is undefined, <a href="../man1/xdg-open.1.html">xdg-open</a>(1) will be used to
       choose  the default browser. If $HTML_VIEWER is not an executable command (e.g. ""), then questions which
       refer to figures will be noted and skipped.

       Licenses are issued by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), but examinations are administered  by
       COLEM  examiners.  See <a href="http://wireless.fcc.gov/commoperators/index.htm">http://wireless.fcc.gov/commoperators/index.htm</a>?job=home for information regarding
       USA commercial radio licenses.
