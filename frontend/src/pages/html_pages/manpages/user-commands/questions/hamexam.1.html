</pre><h4><b>NAME</b> <b>hamexam</b> <b>-</b> <b>Study</b> <b>guide</b> <b>for</b> <b>USA</b> <b>FCC</b> <b>amateur</b> <b>radio</b> <b>(ham</b> <b>radio)</b> <b>license</b> <b>examinations.</b></h4><pre>
</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>hamexam</b> <b>{t,g,e,q}</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>hamexam</b>  presents  questions  in  random  order  from the selected question pool, and terminates when all
       questions have been answered correctly.  The  session  may  be  terminated  with  end-of-file  (^D),  and
       restarted later.

       Some  questions  refer to figures. The figures for the selected question pool are displayed in a separate
       window using $PNG_VIEWER, if  it  is  executable.  If  $PNG_VIEWER  is  undefined,  <a href="../man1/eog.1.html">eog</a>(1),  <a href="../man1/gwenview.1.html">gwenview</a>(1),
       <a href="../man1/gpicview.1.html">gpicview</a>(1),  <a href="../man1/ristretto.1.html">ristretto</a>(1),  will  be  used,  whichever  is  first  found to be an executable command. If
       $PNG_VIEWER is not an executable command (e.g. ""), or if none of the other viewers are  installed,  then
       questions which refer to figures will be noted and skipped.

       Licenses  are issued by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), but examinations are administered by
       Volunteer Examiners.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>

              <b>g</b>  Element  3, the General Class pool (for examinations administered July 1, 2023 through June 30,
