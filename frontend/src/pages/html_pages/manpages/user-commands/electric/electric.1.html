</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       electric - a VLSI design system

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>electric</b> [<u>OPTIONS</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Electric  is  a  general  purpose system for all electrical design.  It currently knows about nMOS, CMOS,
       Bipolar, artwork, schematics, printed-circuit boards, and many other technologies.  It has a large set of
       tools including multiple design-rule checkers (both incremental and hierarchical),  an  electrical  rules
       checker,  over  a  dozen  simulator interfaces, multiple generators (PLA and pad frame), multiple routers
       (stitching, maze, river), network comparison, compaction, compensation, a VHDL compiler,  and  a  silicon
       compiler that places-and-routes standard cells.

       In  addition  to the text terminal used to invoke the program, Electric uses a color display with a mouse
       as a work station.  Separate windows are used for text and graphics.

       If a <u>library</u> disk file is mentioned on the command line, that file is read  as  the  initial  design  for
       editing.  In addition, the following switches are recognized:

</pre><h4><b>REPRESENTATION</b></h4><pre>
       Circuits  are  represented  as networks that contain <u>nodes</u> and connecting <u>arcs</u>.  The nodes are electrical
       components such as transistors, logic gates, and contacts.  The arcs are simply wires  that  connect  the
       nodes.   In  addition, each node has a set of <u>ports</u> which are the sites of arc connection.  A <u>technology</u>,
       then, is simply a set of primitive nodes and arcs that are the building blocks of  circuits  designed  in
       that environment.

       Collections of nodes and arcs can also be aggregated into <u>facets</u> of <u>cells</u> which can be used higher in the
       hierarchy to act as nodes.  These user-defined nodes have ports that come from internal nodes whose ports
       are <u>exported</u>.  Facets are collected in <u>libraries</u> which contain a hierarchically consistent design.

       Arcs  have  properties  that help constrain the design.  For example, an arc may rotate arbitrarily or be
       fixed in their angle.  Arcs can also be stretchable or  <u>rigid</u>  under  modification  of  their  connecting
       nodes.  These constraints propagate hierarchically from the bottom-up.

</pre><h4><b>TECHNOLOGIES</b></h4><pre>
       A  large  set of technologies is provided in Electric.  These can be modified with the technology editor,
       or completely new technologies can be created.  The following  paragraphs  describe  some  of  the  basic
       technologies.

       The  nMOS  technologies  have  arcs  available in Metal, Polysilicon, and Diffusion.  The primitive nodes
       include normal contacts, buried contacts, transistors, and "pins" for making  arc  corners.   Transistors
       may be serpentine and the pure layer nodes may be polygonally described with the <b>node</b> <b>trace</b> command.  The
       "nmos" technology has the standard Mead&amp;Conway design rules.

       The  CMOS  technologies have arcs available in Metal, Polysilicon, and Diffusion.  The Diffusion arcs may
       be found in a P-well implant or in a P+  implant.   Thus,  there  are  two  types  of  metal-to-diffusion
       contacts,  two  types  of  diffusion pins, and two types of transistors: in P-well and in P+ implant.  As
       with nMOS, the transistors may be serpentine and the pure layer primitives may  be  polygonally  defined.
       The  "cmos"  technology  has the standard design rules according to Griswold; the "mocmos" technology has
       design rules for the MOSIS CMOS process (double metal); the "mocmossub" technology has design  rules  for
       the  MOSIS  CMOS  Submicron  process  (double  poly  and up to 6 metal); the "rcmos" technology has round
       geometry for the MOSIS CMOS process.

       The "schematic" technology provides basic symbols for doing schematic capture.   It  contains  the  logic
       symbols:  BUFFER,  AND, OR, and XOR.  Negating bubbles can be placed by negating a connecting arc.  There
       are also more complex components such as  flip-flop,  off-page-connector,  black-box,  meter,  and  power
       source.   Finally,  there  are  the  electrical  components:  transistor, resistor, diode, capacitor, and
       inductor.  Two arc types exist for normal wires and variable-width busses.

       The "artwork" technology is a sketchpad environment for doing general-purpose graphics.   Components  can
       be placed with arbitrary color and shape.

       The  "generic"  technology  exists  for  those miscellaneous purposes that do not fall into the domain of
       other technologies.  It has the universal arc and pin which can connect  to  ANY  other  object  and  are
       therefore  useful  in mixed-technology designs.  The invisible arc can be used for constraining two nodes
       without making a connection.  The unrouted arc can be used for electrical  connections  that  are  to  be
       routed  later  with  real  wires.  The facet-center primitive, when placed in a facet, defines the cursor
       origin on instances of that facet.

</pre><h4><b>DESIGN-RULE</b> <b>CHECKING</b></h4><pre>
       The incremental design-rule checker is normally on and watches all changes made to the circuit.  It  does
       not  correct  but prints error messages when design rules are violated.  Hierarchy is not handled, so the
       contents of subfacets are not checked.

       The hierarchical checker looks all the way down the circuit for all design-rules.  Another option  allows
       an input deck to prepared for ECAD's Dracula design-rule checker.

</pre><h4><b>COMPACTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  compactor  attempts  to  reduce  the size of a facet by removing unnecessary space between elements.
       When invoked it will compact in the vertical and horizontal directions  until  it  can  find  no  way  to
       compact  the  facet  any  further.   It  does  not do hierarchical compaction, does not guarantee optimal
       compaction, nor can it handle non-manhattan geometry properly.  The compactor will also  spread  out  the
       facet to guarantee no design-rule violations, if the "spread" option is set.

</pre><h4><b>SIMULATION</b></h4><pre>
       There  are many simulator interfaces: ESIM (the default simulator: switch-level for nMOS without timing),
       RSIM (switch-level for MOS with timing), RNL (switch-level for  MOS  with  timing  and  LISP  front-end),
       MOSSIM  (switch-level  for  MOS with timing), COSMOS (switch-level for MOS with timing), VERILOG (Cadence
       simulator),  TEXSIM   (a   commercial   simulator),   SILOS   (a   commercial   simulator),   ABEL   (PAL
       generator/simulator  for  schematic), and SPICE (circuit level).  MOSSIM, COSMOS, VERILOG, TEXSIM, SILOS,
       and ABEL do not actually simulate: they only write an input deck of your circuit.

       In preparation for most simulators, it is necessary to export those ports that you wish to manipulate  or
       examine.  You must also export power and ground ports.

       In  preparation  for  SPICE simulation, you must export power and ground signals and.  explicitly connect
       them to source nodes.  The source should then be parameterized to indicate the amount and whether  it  is
       voltage  or  current.   For example, to make a 5 volt supply, create a source node and set the SPICE card
       to: "DC 5".  Next, all input ports must be exported and connected to the positive side of sources.  Next,
       all values that are being plotted must be exported and have meter nodes placed on them.  The node  should
       have the top and bottom ports connected appropriately.

</pre><h4><b>PLA</b> <b>GENERATION</b></h4><pre>
       There are two PLA generators, one specific to nMOS layout, and another specific to CMOS layout.  The nMOS
       PLA  generator  reads  a  single  personality  table  and  generates  the array and all driving circuitry
       including power and ground connections.  The CMOS PLA generator reads two personality tables (AND and OR)
       and also reads a library of PLA helper components (called "pla_mocmos") and generates the array.

</pre><h4><b>ROUTING</b></h4><pre>
       The router is able to do river routing, maze routing, and simple facet stitching (the explicit wiring  of
       implicitly  connected nodes that abut).  River routing runs a bus of wires between the two opposite sides
       of a routing channel.  The connections on each side must be in a line so that the bus  runs  between  two
       parallel sets of points.  You must use the Unrouted arc from the Generic technology to indicate the ports
       to  be  connected.   The  river  router  can also connect wires to the perpendicular sides of the routing
       channel if one or more Unrouted wires cross these sides.

       There are two stitching modes: auto stitching and mimic stitching.  In auto  stitching,  all  ports  that
       physically  touch  will  be stitched.  Mimic stitching watches arcs that are created by the user and adds
       similar ones at other places in the facet.

</pre><h4><b>NETWORK</b> <b>COMPARISON</b></h4><pre>
       The network maintainer tool is able to compare the networks in the two  facets  being  displayed  on  the
       screen.   Once  compared, nodes in one facet can be equated with nodes in the other.  If the two networks
       are automorphic or otherwise difficult to distinguish, equivalence information can be specified prior  to
       comparison by selecting a component in the first facet then selecting a component in the second facet.
