</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       gri - scientific graphics language

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>gri</b> [ <b>OPTIONS</b> ] [ <u>CommandFile</u> [ <u>optional_arguments</u> ]]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Gri is a programming language for scientific graphics.  It can make x-y graphs, contour-graphs, and image
       graphs.   In  addition,  Gri  has a full suite of low-level graphical elements and sufficient programming
       capabilities (loops, subroutines, etc) to permit complex customization.

       Gri is not point-click.  In some ways it is analogous to TeX.  Extensive power  rewards  tolerance  of  a
       modest learning curve.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       If  a command file (CommandFile) is named, commands are read from that file; otherwise they are read from
       the keyboard.  If a command file is named, then a file in which to store the PostScript output  may  also
       be  named;  otherwise  it  is stored in a file named by substituting the .ps extension instead of .gri in
       CommandFile.  If no command file is named, the output is  named  gri-00.ps  (or  gri-01.ps  if  gri-00.ps
       exists, etc).

       There are 3 special forms that do no graphing:

       `gri <b>-creator</b> postscript_file'

              Extracts the Gri commands that created the Gri PostScript file.

       `gri <b>-help</b>' or `gri <b>-h</b>'

              Prints this help message.

       `gri <b>-version</b>' or `gri <b>-v</b>'

              Prints the version number of Gri.

       In normal usage, where drawing is expected, Gri takes these options:

       <b>-batch</b> or <b>-b</b>

              Stops printing of prompts and hints.

       <b>-chatty[N]</b> or <b>-c[N]</b>

              Let gri print info messages

       <b>-debug</b> or <b>-d</b>

              Turns debugging on (sets variable ..debug.. to value 1).

       <b>-warn_offpage</b>

              Warn if any item is drawn far off a 8.5x11 inch page.  (This is the default.)

       <b>-nowarn_offpage</b>

              Don't warn if any item is drawn far off a 8.5x11 inch page

       <b>-directory</b> pathname

              Specifies  the  directory where Gri looks for startup files; otherwise it looks in /opt/gri/lib or
              at whatever directory is defined in configure shellscript, at compile time.

       <b>-directory_default</b>

              Reports directory where gri.cmd should be found, if not supplied by <b>-directory</b>.

       <b>-no_bounding_box</b>

              Make bounding-box be full page.

       <b>-no_expecting</b>

              Prevent warning message if `expecting version .n.'  command is missing.

       <b>-no_startup_message</b>

              Stops printing of startup message.

       <b>-publication</b> or <b>-p</b>

              Sets the builtin variable ..publication.. to 1; normally it is 0.  One  might  use  if  statements
              (`if !..publication..' ...) on drafts.

       <b>-superuser</b> or <b>-s</b>

              Used  only  by  Gri  programmers  (who can check the value with the C function `superuser()'.)  An
              optional value can be supplied without spaces (e.g. `-s2') to set the debugging level.  Flags  are
              listed below; add flags to get several actions at once

              1: print cmdline before/after substituting synonyms

              2: print cmdline before/after substituting rpn expressions

              4: print new commands being defined

              8: print system commands and `open "... | "' commands before

              they are passed to the system

              128: for author's use only

              256: for author's use only

              Note that all flags are equal to 2 raised to an integer power.  Since the flag values are detected
              by a bitwise OR, you can combine flags by adding; thus specifying a flag of 5 yields flags 1 and 4
              together; specifying 15 yields flags 1, 2, 4 and 8.

       <b>-trace</b> or <b>-t</b>

              Makes Gri print out command lines as they are executed.

       <b>-true</b> or <b>-y</b>

              Makes Gri think the answer to all `query's is RETURN.

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       For more information, please consult online <u>info</u> and <u>html</u> manuals.

       The <u>info</u> manual included in the main <b>gri</b> Debian package is normally accessed by typing

       <b>info</b> <b>gri</b>

       (or from within Emacs' own info).

       There are also <u>reference</u> <u>cards</u> in postscript format.  See <b>/usr/share/doc/gri/*refcard.ps</b>

       The Debian package <b>gri-html-doc</b> provides the <u>html</u> manual, which when installed is then located at

              <b>/usr/share/doc/gri/html/index.html</b>

       or, if you have a web server installed, at

              <b><a href="http://localhost/doc/gri/html/index.html">http://localhost/doc/gri/html/index.html</a></b>

       The HTML manual is accessible via <u>dwww</u> and <u>dhelp</u> Debian help interfaces.  The <u>html</u> FAQ is located at

              <b>/usr/share/doc/gri/html/FAQ.html</b>

       The  <b>gri-html-doc</b>  package  also includes <u>examples</u> in <b>/usr/share/doc/gri/examples/</b> which are described in
       the manual, and are included as a quick start primer.

       The <b>gri-pdf-doc</b> package is a <u>PDF</u> version of the manual suitable for printing.

</pre><h4><b>GRI_MERGE</b> <b>AND</b> <b>GRI_UNPAGE</b> <b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       Two Perl scripts are provided with Gri to manipulate the PostScript output.

       <u>gri_merge</u> is used to merge multiple Gri output files into a single PostScript file.  See <b>gri_merge</b> <b>-h</b> and
       its man page for usage information.

       <u>gri_unpage</u> is used is split a multi-page Gri output file (in which the <b>new</b> <b>page</b> command  was  used)  into
       separate PostScript files, one for each page.

       See their respective man pages.

</pre><h4><b>EMACS</b> <b>SUPPORT</b></h4><pre>
       An <u>emacs</u> mode is provided with Gri.  It is documented in the gri Info or HTML manual.

       The mode is installed automatically in Debian by the elisp file:

       <b>/etc/emacs/site-start.d/50gri-el.el</b>

       The emacs mode itself is <u>gri-mode.el</u> and is installed on Debian as <b>/usr/share/emacs/site-lisp/gri-mode.el</b>

       Byte-compiled  versions  of  this file are produced for every flavour of Emacs that is installed, and are
       located in places like <b>/usr/share/emacs/23.1/site-lisp/gri-el/gri-mode.elc</b>
