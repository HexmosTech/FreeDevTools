</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       compton - a compositor for X11

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>compton</b> [<u>OPTIONS</u>]

</pre><h4><b>WARNING</b></h4><pre>
       This man page may be less up-to-date than the usage text in compton (compton -h).

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       compton is a compositor based on Dana Jansens' version of xcompmgr (which itself was written by Keith
       Packard). It includes some improvements over the original xcompmgr, like window frame opacity and
       inactive window transparency.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
           Get the usage text embedded in program code, which may be more up-to-date than this man page.

       <b>-C</b>, <b>--no-dock-shadow</b>
           Avoid drawing shadows on dock/panel windows.

       <b>-z</b>, <b>--clear-shadow</b>

           with fully transparent areas.

       <b>-f</b>, <b>--fading</b>
           Fade windows in/out when opening/closing and when opacity changes, unless <b>--no-fading-openclose</b> is
           used.

           Enable synchronous X operation (for debugging).

       <b>--show-all-xerrors</b>
           Show all X errors (for debugging).

       <b>--config</b> <u>PATH</u>
           Look for configuration file at the path. See <b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>FILES</b> section below for where compton
           looks for a configuration file by default. Use /dev/null to avoid loading configuration file.

       <b>--write-pid-path</b> <u>PATH</u>
           Write process ID to a file.

       <b>--shadow-red</b> <u>VALUE</u>
           Red color value of shadow (0.0 - 1.0, defaults to 0).

       <b>--shadow-green</b> <u>VALUE</u>
           Green color value of shadow (0.0 - 1.0, defaults to 0).

       <b>--shadow-blue</b> <u>VALUE</u>
           Blue color value of shadow (0.0 - 1.0, defaults to 0).

       <b>--inactive-opacity-override</b>
           Let inactive opacity set by <b>-i</b> overrides the windows' <b>_</b><u>NET_WM_OPACITY</u> values.

       <b>--active-opacity</b> <u>OPACITY</u>
           Default opacity for active windows. (0.0 - 1.0, defaults to 1.0)

       <b>--inactive-dim</b> <u>VALUE</u>
           Dim inactive windows. (0.0 - 1.0, defaults to 0.0)

       <b>--mark-wmwin-focused</b>
           Try to detect WM windows (a non-override-redirect window with no child that has WM_STATE) and mark
           them as active.

       <b>--mark-ovredir-focused</b>
           Mark override-redirect windows that doesn’t have a child window with WM_STATE focused.

       <b>--no-fading-openclose</b>
           Do not fade on window open/close.

       <b>--no-fading-destroyed-argb</b>
           Do not fade destroyed ARGB windows with WM frame. Workaround of bugs in Openbox, Fluxbox, etc.

       <b>--shadow-ignore-shaped</b>
           Do not paint shadows on shaped windows. Note shaped windows here means windows setting its shape
           through X Shape extension. Those using ARGB background is beyond our control. Deprecated, use
           --shadow-exclude 'bounding_shaped' or --shadow-exclude 'bounding_shaped &amp;&amp; !rounded_corners' instead.

       <b>--detect-rounded-corners</b>
           Try to detect windows with rounded corners and don’t consider them shaped windows. The accuracy is
           not very high, unfortunately.

       <b>--detect-client-opacity</b>
           Detect <b>_</b><u>NET_WM_OPACITY</u> on client windows, useful for window managers not passing <b>_</b><u>NET_WM_OPACITY</u> of
           client windows to frame windows.

       <b>--refresh-rate</b> <u>REFRESH_RATE</u>
           Specify refresh rate of the screen. If not specified or 0, compton will try detecting this with X
           RandR extension.

       <b>--vsync</b> <u>VSYNC_METHOD</u>
           Set VSync method. VSync methods currently available:

           •   <u>none</u>: No VSync

           •   <u>drm</u>: VSync with <u>DRM_IOCTL_WAIT_VBLANK</u>. May only work on some (DRI-based) drivers.

           •   <u>opengl</u>: Try to VSync with <u>SGI_video_sync</u> OpenGL extension. Only work on some drivers.

           •   <u>opengl-oml</u>: Try to VSync with <u>OML_sync_control</u> OpenGL extension. Only work on some drivers.

           •   <u>opengl-swc</u>: Try to VSync with <u>SGI_swap_control</u> OpenGL extension. Only work on some drivers. Works
               only with GLX backend. Known to be most effective on many drivers. Does not guarantee to control
               paint timing.

           •   <u>opengl-mswc</u>: Try to VSync with <u>MESA_swap_control</u> OpenGL extension. Basically the same as
               <u>opengl-swc</u> above, except the extension we use.

           (Note some VSync methods may not be enabled at compile time.)

       <b>--vsync-aggressive</b>
           Attempt to send painting request before VBlank and do XFlush() during VBlank. Reported to work pretty
           terribly. This switch may be lifted out at any moment.

       <b>--alpha-step</b> <u>VALUE</u>
           X Render backend: Step for pregenerating alpha pictures. (0.01 - 1.0, defaults to 0.03)

       <b>--dbe</b>
           Enable DBE painting mode, intended to use with VSync to (hopefully) eliminate tearing. Reported to
           have no effect, though.

       <b>--paint-on-overlay</b>
           Painting on X Composite overlay window instead of on root window.

       <b>--sw-opti</b>
           Limit compton to repaint at most once every 1 / <u>refresh_rate</u> second to boost performance. This should
           not be used with <b>--vsync</b> drm/opengl/opengl-oml as they essentially does <b>--sw-opti</b>'s job already,
           unless you wish to specify a lower refresh rate than the actual value.

       <b>--use-ewmh-active-win</b>
           Use EWMH <b>_</b><u>NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW</u> to determine currently focused window, rather than listening to
           <u>FocusIn</u>/<u>FocusOut</u> event. Might have more accuracy, provided that the WM supports it.

       <b>--respect-prop-shadow</b>
           Respect <b>_</b><u>COMPTON_SHADOW</u>. This a prototype-level feature, which you must not rely on.

       <b>--unredir-if-possible</b>
           Unredirect all windows if a full-screen opaque window is detected, to maximize performance for
           full-screen windows. Known to cause flickering when redirecting/unredirecting windows.
           <b>--paint-on-overlay</b> may make the flickering less obvious.

       <b>--unredir-if-possible-delay</b> <u>MILLISECONDS</u>
           Delay before unredirecting the window, in milliseconds. Defaults to 0.

       <b>--unredir-if-possible-exclude</b> <u>CONDITION</u>
           Conditions of windows that shouldn’t be considered full-screen for unredirecting screen.

       <b>--shadow-exclude</b> <u>CONDITION</u>
           Specify a list of conditions of windows that should have no shadow.

       <b>--fade-exclude</b> <u>CONDITION</u>
           Specify a list of conditions of windows that should not be faded.

       <b>--focus-exclude</b> <u>CONDITION</u>
           Specify a list of conditions of windows that should always be considered focused.

       <b>--inactive-dim-fixed</b>
           Use fixed inactive dim value, instead of adjusting according to window opacity.

       <b>--detect-transient</b>
           Use <u>WM_TRANSIENT_FOR</u> to group windows, and consider windows in the same group focused at the same
           time.

       <b>--detect-client-leader</b>
           Use <u>WM_CLIENT_LEADER</u> to group windows, and consider windows in the same group focused at the same
           time.  <u>WM_TRANSIENT_FOR</u> has higher priority if <b>--detect-transient</b> is enabled, too.

       <b>--blur-background</b>
           Blur background of semi-transparent / ARGB windows. Bad in performance, with driver-dependent
           behavior. The name of the switch may change without prior notifications.

       <b>--blur-background-frame</b>
           Blur background of windows when the window frame is not opaque. Implies <b>--blur-background</b>. Bad in
           performance, with driver-dependent behavior. The name may change.

       <b>--blur-background-fixed</b>
           Use fixed blur strength rather than adjusting according to window opacity.

       <b>--blur-kern</b> <u>MATRIX</u>
           Specify the blur convolution kernel, with the following format:

               WIDTH,HEIGHT,ELE1,ELE2,ELE3,ELE4,ELE5...

           The element in the center must not be included, it will be forever 1.0 or changing based on opacity,
           depending on whether you have --blur-background-fixed. Yet the automatic adjustment of blur factor
           may not work well with a custom blur kernel.

           A 7x7 Gaussian blur kernel (sigma = 0.84089642) looks like:

               --blur-kern '7,7,0.000003,0.000102,0.000849,0.001723,0.000849,0.000102,0.000003,0.000102,0.003494,0.029143,0.059106,0.029143,0.003494,0.000102,0.000849,0.029143,0.243117,0.493069,0.243117,0.029143,0.000849,0.001723,0.059106,0.493069,0.493069,0.059106,0.001723,0.000849,0.029143,0.243117,0.493069,0.243117,0.029143,0.000849,0.000102,0.003494,0.029143,0.059106,0.029143,0.003494,0.000102,0.000003,0.000102,0.000849,0.001723,0.000849,0.000102,0.000003'

           May also be one of the predefined kernels: 3x3box (default), 5x5box, 7x7box, 3x3gaussian,
           5x5gaussian, 7x7gaussian, 9x9gaussian, 11x11gaussian. All Gaussian kernels are generated with sigma =
           0.84089642 . You may use the accompanied compton-convgen.py to generate blur kernels.

       <b>--blur-background-exclude</b> <u>CONDITION</u>
           Exclude conditions for background blur.

       <b>--resize-damage</b> <u>INTEGER</u>
           Resize damaged region by a specific number of pixels. A positive value enlarges it while a negative
           one shrinks it. If the value is positive, those additional pixels will not be actually painted to
           screen, only used in blur calculation, and such. (Due to technical limitations, with <b>--dbe</b> or
           <b>--glx-swap-method</b>, those pixels will still be incorrectly painted to screen.) Primarily used to fix
           the line corruption issues of blur, in which case you should use the blur radius value here (e.g.
           with a 3x3 kernel, you should use <b>--resize-damage</b> 1, with a 5x5 one you use <b>--resize-damage</b> 2, and so
           on). May or may not work with --glx-no-stencil. Shrinking doesn’t function correctly.

       <b>--invert-color-include</b> <u>CONDITION</u>
           Specify a list of conditions of windows that should be painted with inverted color. Resource-hogging,
           and is not well tested.

       <b>--opacity-rule</b> <u>OPACITY</u>:'CONDITION'
           Specify a list of opacity rules, in the format PERCENT:PATTERN, like 50:name *= "Firefox".
           compton-trans is recommended over this. Note we don’t make any guarantee about possible conflicts
           with other programs that set <b>_</b><u>NET_WM_WINDOW_OPACITY</u> on frame or client windows.

       <b>--shadow-exclude-reg</b> <u>GEOMETRY</u>
           Specify a X geometry that describes the region in which shadow should not be painted in, such as a
           dock window region. Use --shadow-exclude-reg x10+0-0, for example, if the 10 pixels on the bottom of
           the screen should not have shadows painted on.

       <b>--xinerama-shadow-crop</b>
           Crop shadow of a window fully on a particular Xinerama screen to the screen.

       <b>--backend</b> <u>BACKEND</u>
           Specify the backend to use: xrender, glx, or xr_glx_hybrid.  xrender is the default one.

           •   xrender backend performs all rendering operations with X Render extension. It is what xcompmgr
               uses, and is generally a safe fallback when you encounter rendering artifacts or instability.

           •   glx (OpenGL) backend performs all rendering operations with OpenGL. It is more friendly to some
               VSync methods, and has significantly superior performance on color inversion
               (--invert-color-include) or blur (--blur-background). It requires proper OpenGL 2.0 support from
               your driver and hardware. You may wish to look at the GLX performance optimization options below.
               --xrender-sync and --xrender-sync-fence might be needed on some systems to avoid delay in changes
               of screen contents.

           •   xr_glx_hybrid backend renders the updated screen contents with X Render and presents it on the
               screen with GLX. It attempts to address the rendering issues some users encountered with GLX
               backend and enables the better VSync of GLX backends.  --vsync-use-glfinish might fix some
               rendering issues with this backend.

       <b>--glx-no-stencil</b>
           GLX backend: Avoid using stencil buffer, useful if you don’t have a stencil buffer. Might cause
           incorrect opacity when rendering transparent content (but never practically happened) and may not
           work with <b>--blur-background</b>. My tests show a 15% performance boost. Recommended.

       <b>--glx-copy-from-front</b>
           GLX backend: Copy unmodified regions from front buffer instead of redrawing them all. My tests with
           nvidia-drivers show a 10% decrease in performance when the whole screen is modified, but a 20%
           increase when only 1/4 is. My tests on nouveau show terrible slowdown. Useful with --glx-swap-method,
           as well.

       <b>--glx-use-copysubbuffermesa</b>
           GLX backend: Use <u>MESA_copy_sub_buffer</u> to do partial screen update. My tests on nouveau shows a 200%
           performance boost when only 1/4 of the screen is updated. May break VSync and is not available on
           some drivers. Overrides <b>--glx-copy-from-front</b>.

       <b>--glx-no-rebind-pixmap</b>
           GLX backend: Avoid rebinding pixmap on window damage. Probably could improve performance on rapid
           window content changes, but is known to break things on some drivers (LLVMpipe, xf86-video-intel,
           etc.). Recommended if it works.

       <b>--glx-swap-method</b> undefined/exchange/copy/3/4/5/6/buffer-age
           GLX backend: GLX buffer swap method we assume. Could be undefined (0), copy (1), exchange (2), 3-6,
           or buffer-age (-1).  undefined is the slowest and the safest, and the default value.  copy is
           fastest, but may fail on some drivers, 2-6 are gradually slower but safer (6 is still faster than 0).
           Usually, double buffer means 2, triple buffer means 3.  buffer-age means auto-detect using
           <u>GLX_EXT_buffer_age</u>, supported by some drivers. Useless with <b>--glx-use-copysubbuffermesa</b>. Partially
           breaks --resize-damage. Defaults to undefined.

       <b>--glx-use-gpushader4</b>
           GLX backend: Use <u>GL_EXT_gpu_shader4</u> for some optimization on blur GLSL code. My tests on GTX 670 show
           no noticeable effect.

       <b>--xrender-sync</b>
           Attempt to synchronize client applications' draw calls with XSync(), used on GLX backend to ensure
           up-to-date window content is painted.

       <b>--xrender-sync-fence</b>
           Additionally use X Sync fence to sync clients' draw calls. Needed on nvidia-drivers with GLX backend
           for some users. May be disabled at compile time with NO_XSYNC=1.

       <b>--glx-fshader-win</b> <u>SHADER</u>
           GLX backend: Use specified GLSL fragment shader for rendering window contents. See
           compton-default-fshader-win.glsl and compton-fake-transparency-fshader-win.glsl in the source tree
           for examples.

       <b>--force-win-blend</b>
           Force all windows to be painted with blending. Useful if you have a <b>--glx-fshader-win</b> that could turn
           opaque pixels transparent.

       <b>--dbus</b>
           Enable remote control via D-Bus. See the <b>D-BUS</b> <b>API</b> section below for more details.

       <b>--benchmark</b> <u>CYCLES</u>
           Benchmark mode. Repeatedly paint until reaching the specified cycles.

       <b>--benchmark-wid</b> <u>WINDOW_ID</u>
           Specify window ID to repaint in benchmark mode. If omitted or is 0, the whole screen is repainted.

</pre><h4><b>FORMAT</b> <b>OF</b> <b>CONDITIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Some options accept a condition string to match certain windows. A condition string is formed by one or
       more conditions, joined by logical operators.

       A condition with "exists" operator looks like this:

           &lt;NEGATION&gt; &lt;TARGET&gt; &lt;CLIENT/FRAME&gt; [&lt;INDEX&gt;] : &lt;FORMAT&gt; &lt;TYPE&gt;

       With equals operator it looks like:

           &lt;NEGATION&gt; &lt;TARGET&gt; &lt;CLIENT/FRAME&gt; [&lt;INDEX&gt;] : &lt;FORMAT&gt; &lt;TYPE&gt; &lt;NEGATION&gt; &lt;OP QUALIFIER&gt; &lt;MATCH TYPE&gt; = &lt;PATTERN&gt;

       With greater-than/less-than operators it looks like:

           &lt;NEGATION&gt; &lt;TARGET&gt; &lt;CLIENT/FRAME&gt; [&lt;INDEX&gt;] : &lt;FORMAT&gt; &lt;TYPE&gt; &lt;NEGATION&gt; &lt;OPERATOR&gt; &lt;PATTERN&gt;

       <u>NEGATION</u> (optional) is one or more exclamation marks;

       <u>TARGET</u> is either a predefined target name, or the name of a window property to match. Supported
       predefined targets are id, x, y, x2 (x + widthb), y2, width, height, widthb (width + 2 * border_width),
       heightb, override_redirect, argb (whether the window has an ARGB visual), focused, wmwin (whether the
       window looks like a WM window, i.e. has no child window with WM_STATE and is not override-redirected),
       bounding_shaped, rounded_corners (requires <b>--detect-rounded-corners</b>), client (ID of client window),
       window_type (window type in string), leader (ID of window leader), name, class_g (= WM_CLASS[1]), class_i
       (= WM_CLASS[0]), and role.

       <u>CLIENT/FRAME</u> is a single @ if the window attribute should be be looked up on client window, nothing if on
       frame window;

       <u>INDEX</u> (optional) is the index number of the property to look up. For example, [2] means look at the third
       value in the property. Do not specify it for predefined targets.

       <u>FORMAT</u> (optional) specifies the format of the property, 8, 16, or 32. On absence we use format X reports.
       Do not specify it for predefined or string targets.

       <u>TYPE</u> is a single character representing the type of the property to match for: c for <u>CARDINAL</u>, a for
       <u>ATOM</u>, w for <u>WINDOW</u>, d for <u>DRAWABLE</u>, s for <u>STRING</u> (and any other string types, such as <u>UTF8_STRING</u>). Do
       not specify it for predefined targets.

       <u>OP</u> <u>QUALIFIER</u> (optional), applicable only for equals operator, could be ? (ignore-case).

       <u>MATCH</u> <u>TYPE</u> (optional), applicable only for equals operator, could be nothing (exact match), * (match
       anywhere), ^ (match from start), % (wildcard), or ~ (PCRE regular expression).

       <u>OPERATOR</u> is one of = (equals), &lt;, &gt;, &lt;=, =&gt;, or nothing (exists). Exists operator checks whether a
       property exists on a window (but for predefined targets, exists means != 0 then).

       <u>PATTERN</u> is either an integer or a string enclosed by single or double quotes. Python-3-style escape
       sequences and raw string are supported in the string format.

       Supported logical operators are &amp;&amp; (and) and || (or). &amp;&amp; has higher precedence than ||, left-to-right
       associativity. Use parentheses to change precedence.

       Examples:

           # If the window is focused
           focused
           focused = 1
           # If the window is not override-redirected
           !override_redirect
           override_redirect = false
           override_redirect != true
           override_redirect != 1
           # If the window is a menu
           window_type *= "menu"
           _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE@:a *= "MENU"
           # If the window name contains "Firefox", ignore case
           name *?= "Firefox"
           _NET_WM_NAME@:s *?= "Firefox"
           # If the window name ends with "Firefox"
           name %= "*Firefox"
           name ~= "Firefox$"
           # If the window has a property _COMPTON_SHADOW with value 0, type CARDINAL,
           # format 32, value 0, on its frame window
           _COMPTON_SHADOW:32c = 0
           # If the third value of _NET_FRAME_EXTENTS is less than 20, or there's no
           # _NET_FRAME_EXTENTS property on client window
           _NET_FRAME_EXTENTS@[2]:32c &lt; 20 || !_NET_FRAME_EXTENTS@:32c
           # The pattern here will be parsed as "dd4"
           name = "\x64\x64\o64"
           # The pattern here will be parsed as "\x64\x64\x64"
           name = r"\x64\x64\o64"

</pre><h4><b>LEGACY</b> <b>FORMAT</b> <b>OF</b> <b>CONDITIONS</b></h4><pre>
       This is the old condition format we once used. Support of this format might be removed in the future.

           condition = TARGET:TYPE[FLAGS]:PATTERN

       <u>TARGET</u> is one of "n" (window name), "i" (window class instance), "g" (window general class), and "r"
       (window role).

       <u>TYPE</u> is one of "e" (exact match), "a" (match anywhere), "s" (match from start), "w" (wildcard), and "p"
       (PCRE regular expressions, if compiled with the support).

       <u>FLAGS</u> could be a series of flags. Currently the only defined flag is "i" (ignore case).

       <u>PATTERN</u> is the actual pattern string.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       compton could read from a configuration file if libconfig support is compiled in. If <b>--config</b> is not
       used, compton will seek for a configuration file in $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/compton.conf
       (<a href="file:~/.config/compton.conf">~/.config/compton.conf</a>, usually), then <a href="file:~/.compton.conf">~/.compton.conf</a>, then compton.conf under $XDG_CONFIG_DIRS (often
       /etc/xdg/compton.conf).

       compton uses general libconfig configuration file format. A sample configuration file is available as
       compton.sample.conf in the source tree. Most commandline switches each could be replaced with an option
       in configuration file, thus documented above. Window-type-specific settings are exposed only in
       configuration file and has the following format:

           wintypes:
           {
             WINDOW_TYPE = { fade = BOOL; shadow = BOOL; opacity = FLOAT; focus = BOOL; };
           };

       <u>WINDOW_TYPE</u> is one of the 15 window types defined in EWMH standard: "unknown", "desktop", "dock",
       "toolbar", "menu", "utility", "splash", "dialog", "normal", "dropdown_menu", "popup_menu", "tooltip",
       "notify", "combo", and "dnd". "fade" and "shadow" controls window-type-specific shadow and fade settings.
       "opacity" controls default opacity of the window type. "focus" controls whether the window of this type
       is to be always considered focused. (By default, all window types except "normal" and "dialog" has this
       on.)

</pre><h4><b>SIGNALS</b></h4><pre>
       •   compton reinitializes itself upon receiving SIGUSR1.

</pre><h4><b>D-BUS</b> <b>API</b></h4><pre>
       It’s possible to control compton via D-Bus messages, by running compton with <b>--dbus</b> and send messages to
       com.github.chjj.compton.&lt;DISPLAY&gt;. &lt;DISPLAY&gt; is the display used by compton, with all non-alphanumeric
       characters transformed to underscores. For DISPLAY=:0.0 you should use com.github.chjj.compton._0_0, for
       example.

       The D-Bus methods and signals are not yet stable, thus undocumented right now.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       •   Disable configuration file parsing:

               $ compton --config /dev/null

       •   Run compton with client-side shadow and fading, disable shadow on dock windows and drag-and-drop
           windows:

               $ compton -cCGf

       •   Same thing as above, plus making inactive windows 80% transparent, making frame 80% transparent,
           don’t fade on window open/close, enable software optimization, and fork to background:

               $ compton -bcCGf -i 0.8 -e 0.8 --no-fading-openclose --sw-opti

       •   Draw white shadows:

               $ compton -c --shadow-red 1 --shadow-green 1 --shadow-blue 1

       •   Avoid drawing shadows on wbar window:

               $ compton -c --shadow-exclude 'class_g = "wbar"'

       •   Enable OpenGL SGI_swap_control VSync with GLX backend:

               $ compton --backend glx --vsync opengl-swc
