</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       arc - arcanist, a code review and revision management utility

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>arc</b> <u>command</u> [<u>options</u>] [<u>args</u>] This help file provides a detailed command reference.

</pre><h4><b>COMMAND</b> <b>REFERENCE</b></h4><pre>
       <b>alias</b>

       <b>alias</b> <u>command</u>

       <b>alias</b> <u>command</u> <u>target</u> -- [<u>options</u>]

           Supports: cli Create an alias from <u>command</u> to <u>target</u> (optionally, with <u>options</u>). For example:

             arc alias fpatch patch -- --force

           ...will create a new 'arc' command, 'arc fpatch', which invokes 'arc patch --force ...' when run.
           NOTE: use "--" before specifying options!

           If you start an alias with "!", the remainder of the alias will be invoked as a shell command. For
           example, if you want to implement 'arc ls', you can do so like this:

             arc alias ls '!ls'

           You can now run "arc ls" and it will behave like "ls". Of course, this example is silly and would
           make your life worse.

           You can not overwrite builtins, including 'alias' itself. The builtin will always execute, even if it
           was added after your alias.

           To remove an alias, run:

             arc alias fpatch

           Without any arguments, 'arc alias' will list aliases.

       <b>amend</b> [--revision <u>revision_id</u>] [--show]

           Supports: git, hg Amend the working copy, synchronizing the local commit message from Differential.

           Supported in Mercurial 2.2 and newer.

           <u>--revision</u> <u>revision_id</u>

               Use  the message from a specific revision. If you do not specify a revision, arc will guess which
               revision is in the working copy.

           <u>--show</u>

               Show the amended commit message, without modifying the working copy.

       <b>anoid</b>

           There's only one way to find out...

       <b>backout</b>

           Reverts/backouts on a previous commit. Supports: git, hg

               Command is used like this: arc backout &lt;commithash&gt; | &lt;diff  revision&gt;  Entering  a  differential
               revision  will  only work if there is only one commit associated with the revision. This requires
               your working copy is up to date and that the commit exists in the working copy.

       <b>bookmark</b> [<u>options</u>]

       <b>bookmark</b> <u>name</u> [<u>start</u>]

           Supports: hg Alias for arc feature.

           <u>--by-status</u>

               Sort branches by status instead of time.

           <u>--output</u> <u>format</u>

               With 'json', show features in machine-readable JSON format.

           <u>--view-all</u>

               Include closed and abandoned revisions.

       <b>branch</b> [<u>options</u>]

       <b>branch</b> <u>name</u> [<u>start</u>]

           Supports: git Alias for arc feature.

           <u>--by-status</u>

               Sort branches by status instead of time.

           <u>--output</u> <u>format</u>

               With 'json', show features in machine-readable JSON format.

           <u>--view-all</u>

               Include closed and abandoned revisions.

       <b>browse</b> [<u>options</u>] <u>path</u> ...

       <b>browse</b> [<u>options</u>] <u>object</u> ...

           Supports: git, hg, svn Open a file or object (like a task or revision) in your web browser.

             $ arc browse README   # Open a file in Diffusion.
             $ arc browse T123     # View a task.
             $ arc browse HEAD     # View a symbolic commit.

           Set the 'browser' value using 'arc set-config' to select a browser. If no browser is set, the command
           will try to guess which browser to use.

           <u>--branch</u> <u>branch_name</u>

               Default branch name to view on server. Defaults to "master".

           <u>--force</u>

               Open arguments as paths, even if they do not exist in the working copy.

       <b>call-conduit</b> <u>method</u>

           Supports: http, https Allows you to make a raw Conduit method call:

             - Run this command from a working directory.
             - Call parameters are REQUIRED and read as a JSON blob from stdin.
             - Results are written to stdout as a JSON blob.

           This workflow is primarily useful for writing scripts which integrate with Phabricator. Examples:

             $ echo '{}' | arc call-conduit conduit.ping
             $ echo '{"phid":"PHID-FILE-xxxx"}' | arc call-conduit file.download

       <b>close</b> <u>task_id</u> [<u>options</u>]
         Close a task or otherwise update its status.

       <u>--list-statuses</u>

           Show available status options and exit.

       <u>--message</u> <u>comment</u>, <u>-m</u> <u>comment</u>

           Provide a comment with your status change.

       <u>--status</u> <u>status</u>, <u>-s</u> <u>status</u>

           Specify a new status. Valid status options can be seen with the `list-statuses` argument.

       <b>close-revision</b> [<u>options</u>] <u>revision</u>

           Supports: git, hg, svn Close a revision which has been committed (svn)  or  pushed  (git,  hg).   You
           should  not  normally  need to do this: arc commit (svn), arc amend (git, hg), arc land (git, hg), or
           repository tracking on the master  remote  repository  should  do  it  for  you.  However,  if  these
           mechanisms  have failed for some reason you can use this command to manually change a revision status
           from "Accepted" to "Closed".

           <u>--finalize</u>

               Close only if the repository is untracked and the revision is  accepted.  Continue  even  if  the
               close can't happen. This is a soft version of '' used by other workflows.

           <u>--quiet</u>

               Do not print a success message.

       <b>commit</b> [--revision <u>revision_id</u>] [--show]

           Supports: svn Commit a revision which has been accepted by a reviewer.

           <u>--revision</u> <u>revision_id</u>

               Commit  a  specific  revision.  If  you  do not specify a revision, arc will look for committable
               revisions.

           <u>--show</u>

               Show the command which would be issued, but do not actually commit anything.

       <b>cover</b> [--rev <u>revision</u>] [<u>path</u> ...]

           Supports: svn, git, hg Cover your... professional reputation. Show blame for the lines you changed in
           your working copy (svn) or since some commit (hg, git).  This will take a minute because blame  takes
           a minute, especially under SVN.

           <u>--rev</u> <u>revision</u>

               Supports: git, hg Cover changes since a specific revision.

       <b>diff</b> [<u>paths</u>] (svn)

       <b>diff</b> [<u>commit</u>] (git, hg)

           Supports: git, svn, hg Generate a Differential diff or revision from local changes.

           Under  git  and  mercurial,  you  can specify a commit (like <u>HEAD^^^</u> or <u>master</u>) and Differential will
           generate a diff against the merge base of that commit and your current working directory parent.

           Under svn, you can choose to include only some of the modified files in the working copy in the  diff
           by specifying their paths. If you omit paths, all changes are included in the diff.

           <u>--add-all</u>, <u>-a</u>

               Automatically add all unstaged and uncommitted files to the commit.

           <u>--advice</u>

               Require excuse for lint advice in addition to lint warnings and errors.

           <u>--allow-untracked</u>

               Skip checks for untracked files in the working copy.

           <u>--amend-all</u>

               When linting git repositories, amend HEAD with all patches suggested by lint without prompting.

           <u>--amend-autofixes</u>

               When  linting  git  repositories,  amend  HEAD  with  autofix  patches  suggested by lint without
               prompting.

           <u>--apply-patches</u>

               Apply patches suggested by lint to the working copy without prompting.

           <u>--base</u> <u>rules</u>

               Supports: git, hg Additional rules for determining base revision.

           <u>--browse</u>

               After creating a diff or revision, open it in a web browser.

           <u>--cache</u> <u>bool</u>

               0 to disable lint cache, 1 to enable (default).

           <u>--cc</u> <u>usernames</u>

           <u>--coverage</u>

               Always enable coverage information.

           <u>--create</u>

               Always create a new revision.

           <u>--edit</u>

               Supports: git, hg When updating a revision under git, edit revision information before updating.

           <u>--encoding</u> <u>encoding</u>

               Attempt to convert non UTF-8 hunks into specified encoding.

           <u>--excuse</u> <u>excuse</u>

               Provide a prepared in advance excuse for any lints/tests shall they fail.

           <u>--head</u> <u>commit</u>

               Supports: git Specify the end of  the  commit  range.  This  disables  many  Arcanist/Phabricator
               features which depend on having access to the working copy.

           <u>--ignore-unsound-tests</u>

               Ignore unsound test failures without prompting.

           <u>--json</u>

               Emit machine-readable JSON. EXPERIMENTAL! Probably does not work!

           <u>--less-context</u>

               Normally,  files  are  diffed  with  full  context:  the  entire  file is sent to Differential so
               reviewers can 'show more' and see it. If you are making changes to very large files with tens  of
               thousands  of lines, this may not work well. With this flag, a diff will be created that has only
               a few lines of context.

           <u>--lintall</u>

               Raise all lint warnings, not just those on lines you changed.

           <u>--message</u> <u>message</u>, <u>-m</u> <u>message</u>

               When updating a revision, use the specified message instead of prompting.

           <u>--message-file</u> <u>file</u>, <u>-F</u> <u>file</u>

               When creating a revision, read revision information from this file.

           <u>--never-apply-patches</u>

               Never apply patches suggested by lint.

           <u>--no-amend</u>

               Never amend commits in the working copy with lint patches.

           <u>--no-coverage</u>

               Always disable coverage information.

           <u>--no-diff</u>

               Only run lint and unit tests. Intended for internal use.

           <u>--nolint</u>

               Do not run lint.

           <u>--nounit</u>

               Do not run unit tests.

           <u>--only</u>

               Only generate a diff, without running lint, unit  tests,  or  other  auxiliary  steps.  See  also
               --preview.

           <u>--only-new</u> <u>bool</u>

               Display only lint messages not present in the original code.

           <u>--plan-changes</u>

               Create or update a revision without requesting a code review.

           <u>--preview</u>

               Instead  of  creating or updating a revision, only create a diff, which you may later attach to a
               revision. This still runs lint unit tests. See also --only.

           <u>--raw</u>

               Read diff from stdin, not from the working copy. This disables many Arcanist/Phabricator features
               which depend on having access to the working copy.

           <u>--raw-command</u> <u>command</u>

               Generate diff by executing a specified command, not from the working  copy.  This  disables  many
               Arcanist/Phabricator features which depend on having access to the working copy.

           <u>--reviewers</u> <u>usernames</u>

               When creating a revision, add reviewers.

           <u>--skip-binaries</u>

           <u>--use-commit-message</u> <u>commit</u>, <u>-C</u> <u>commit</u>

               Supports: git Read revision information from a specific commit.

           <u>--verbatim</u>

               Supports:  hg, git When creating a revision, try to use the working copy commit message verbatim,
               without prompting to edit it. When updating a revision, update some fields from the local  commit
               message.

       <b>download</b> <u>file</u> [--as <u>name</u>] [--show]

           Supports: filesystems Download a file to local disk, e.g.:

             $ arc download F33              # Download file 'F33'

           <u>--as</u> <u>name</u>

               Save the file with a specific name rather than the default.

           <u>--show</u>

               Write file to stdout instead of to disk.

       <b>export</b> <u>--diff</u> <u>diff_id</u> <u>format</u>

           Supports:  svn,  git,  hg Export the local changeset (or a Differential changeset) to a file, in some
           <u>format</u>: git diff (<u>--git</u>), unified diff (<u>--unified</u>), or arc bundle (<u>--arcbundle</u> <u>path</u>) format.

           <u>--arcbundle</u> <u>file</u>

               Export change as an arc bundle. This format can represent  all  changes.  These  bundles  can  be
               applied with 'arc patch'.

           <u>--diff</u> <u>diff_id</u>

               Instead of exporting changes from the working copy, export them from a Differential diff.

           <u>--encoding</u> <u>encoding</u>

           <u>--git</u>

               Export  change  as a git patch. This format is more complete than unified, but less complete than
               arc bundles. These patches can be applied with 'git apply' or 'arc patch'.

           <u>--revision</u> <u>revision_id</u>

               Instead of exporting changes from the working copy, export them from a Differential revision.

           <u>--unified</u>

       <b>feature</b> <u>name</u> [<u>start</u>]

           Supports: git, hg A wrapper on 'git branch' or 'hg bookmark'.

           Without <u>name</u>, it lists the available branches and their revision status.

           With  <u>name</u>, it creates or checks out a branch. If the branch <u>name</u> doesn't exist and is in format D123
           then the branch of revision D123 is checked out. Use <u>start</u> to  specify  where  the  new  branch  will
           start. Use 'arc.feature.start.default' to set the default feature start location.

           <u>--by-status</u>

               Sort branches by status instead of time.

           <u>--output</u> <u>format</u>

           (Maniphest  tasks  T[7m#,  Differential  revisions  D[m#,  Diffusion  references  rXXX???,  or  PHIDs
           PHID-XXX-???)  to print only flags for those objects.

           In the second form, clear an existing flag on one object.

           In  the  third form, create or update a flag on one object. Color defaults to blue and note to empty,
           but if you omit both you must pass --edit.

           <u>--clear</u>

               Delete the flag on an object.

           <u>--color</u> <u>color</u>

               Set the color of a flag.

           <u>--edit</u>

               Edit the flag on an object.

               Print detailed information about each command.

       <b>install-certificate</b> [uri]

           Supports: http, https Installs Conduit credentials into  your  <a href="file:~/.arcrc">~/.arcrc</a>  for  the  given  install  of
           Phabricator.  You need to do this before you can use 'arc', as it enables 'arc' to link your command-
           line activity with your account on the web. Run this command  from  within  a  project  directory  to
           install     that     project's     certificate,     or     specify     an    explicit    URI    (like
           "https://phabricator.example.com/").

       <b>land</b> [<u>options</u>] [<u>ref</u>]

           Supports: git, hg

           Publish an accepted revision after review. This command is the last step in the standard Differential
           pre-publish code review workflow.

           This command merges and pushes changes associated  with  an  accepted  revision  that  are  currently
           sitting  in  <u>ref</u>,  which is usually the name of a local branch. Without <u>ref</u>, the current working copy
           state will be used.

           Under Git: branches, tags, and arbitrary commits (detached HEADs) may be landed.

           Under Mercurial: branches and bookmarks may be landed, but only onto a target of the same  type.  See
           T3855.

           The workflow selects a target branch to land onto and a remote where the change will be pushed to.

           A target branch is selected by examining these sources in order:

             - the B&lt;--onto&gt; flag;
             - the upstream of the current branch, recursively (Git only);
             - the I&lt;arc.land.onto.default&gt; configuration setting;
             - or by falling back to a standard default:
               - "master" in Git;
               - "default" in Mercurial.

           A remote is selected by examining these sources in order:

             - the B&lt;--remote&gt; flag;
             - the upstream of the current branch, recursively (Git only);
             - or by falling back to a standard default:
               - "origin" in Git;
               - the default remote in Mercurial.

           After selecting a target branch and a remote, the commits which will be landed are printed.

           With <b>--preview</b>, execution stops here, before the change is merged.

           The change is merged with the changes in the target branch, following these rules:

           In  repositories  with mutable history or with <b>--squash</b>, this will perform a squash merge (the entire
           branch will be represented as one commit after the merge).

           In repositories with immutable history or with <b>--merge</b>, this will perform a  strict  merge  (a  merge
           commit will always be created, and local commits will be preserved).

           The  resulting  commit  will  be given an up-to-date commit message describing the final state of the
           revision in Differential.

           In Git, the merge occurs in a detached HEAD. The local  branch  reference  (if  one  exists)  is  not
           updated yet.

           With <b>--hold</b>, execution stops here, before the change is pushed.

           The change is pushed into the remote.

           Consulting  mystical  sources of power, the workflow makes a guess about what state you wanted to end
           up in after the process finishes and the working copy is put into that state.

           The branch which was landed is deleted, unless the <b>--keep-branch</b>  flag  was  passed  or  the  landing
           branch is the same as the target branch.

           <u>--delete-remote</u>

               Delete the feature branch in the remote after landing it.

           <u>--hold</u>

               Prepare the change to be pushed, but do not actually push it.

           <u>--keep-branch</u>

               Keep the feature branch after pushing changes to the remote (by default, it is deleted).

           <u>--merge</u>

               Supports:  git  Perform a --no-ff merge, not a --squash merge. If the project is marked as having
               an immutable history, this is the default behavior.

           <u>--onto</u> <u>master</u>

               Land feature branch onto a branch other than the default ('master' in git, 'default' in hg).  You
               can change the default by setting 'arc.land.onto.default' with `arc set-config` or for the entire
               project in .arcconfig.

           <u>--preview</u>

               Prints the commits that would be landed. Does not actually modify or land the commits.

           <u>--remote</u> <u>origin</u>

           <u>--revision</u> <u>id</u>

               Use  the  message  from  a  specific revision, rather than inferring the revision based on branch
               content.

           <u>--squash</u>

               Perform a --squash merge, not a --no-ff merge. If the project  is  marked  as  having  a  mutable
               history, this is the default behavior.

           <u>--update-with-merge</u>

               Supports: git When updating the feature branch, use merge instead of rebase.  This is the default
               behavior. Setting arc.land.update.default to 'merge' can also be used to make this the default.

           <u>--update-with-rebase</u>

               Supports:  git  When  updating  the feature branch, use rebase instead of merge.  This might make
               things work better in some cases. Set  arc.land.update.default  to  'rebase'  to  make  this  the
               default.

       <b>liberate</b> [<u>path</u>]

           Supports:  libphutil  Create  or  update a libphutil library, generating required metadata files like
           <u>init</u>.php.

               Force the library map to be updated, even in the presence of lint errors.

           <u>--library-name</u> <u>name</u>

           Supports:  git,  svn,  hg  Run  static  analysis  on  changes  to check for mistakes. If no files are
           specified, lint will be run on all files which have been modified.

           <u>--amend-all</u>

               When linting git repositories, amend HEAD with all patches suggested by lint without prompting.

           <u>--amend-autofixes</u>

               Never apply patches suggested by lint.

           <u>--only-changed</u>

               Show lint warnings just on changed lines. When no paths are specified, this is the default.  This
               differs from only-new in cases where line modifications introduce lint on other unmodified lines.

           <u>--only-new</u> <u>bool</u>

               Supports: git, hg Display only messages not present in the original code.
