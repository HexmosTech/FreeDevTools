</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>kanif</b> is a tool for cluster management and administration. It combines main features of well known
       cluster management tools such as c3, pdsh and dsh and mimics their syntax. For the effective cluster
       management it relies on <b>TakTuk</b>, a tool for large scale remote execution deployment.

       For simple parallel tasks that have to be executed on regular machines such as clusters, <b>TakTuk</b> syntax is
       too complicated.  The goal of <b>kanif</b> is to provide an easier and familiar syntax to cluster administrators
       while still taking advantage of <b>TakTuk</b> characteristics and features (adaptivity, scalability,
       portability, autopropagation and information redirection).

       To work, <b>kanif</b> needs to find the "taktuk" command (version 3.3 and above) in the user path. The other
       requirements are the same as <b>TakTuk</b>: it requires, on all the nodes of the cluster, a working Perl
       interpreter (version 5.8 and above) and a command to log without password (such as "ssh" with proper rsa
       keys installed).

       <b>kanif</b> provides three simple commands for clusters administration and management:

       <b>kash</b>: runs the same command on multiple nodes
       <b>kaput</b>: broadcasts the copy of files or directories to several nodes
       <b>kaget</b>: gathers several remote files or directories

       <b>kanif</b>  combines  the advantages of several cluster management tools.  Its main features can be summarized
       as follows:

       •   C3-style configuration file for static clusters setups

       •   pdsh-like options such as nodes ranges and timeouts

       •   dshbak-like gathering, sorting and merging of output

       As with "pdsh", <b>kanif</b> deployment can be monitored and controlled  by  signals.   When  <b>kanif</b>  receives  a
       SIGINT  (usually sent by typing Ctrl-C), it displays a brief summary of its deployment state and commands
       execution progress. After this first SIGINT, if <b>kanif</b> receives a second signal within one second:

       •   it terminates its execution (cancelling any ongoing task) if this is a SIGINT

       •   it cancels any ongoing connections and start executions on the already deployed nodes if  this  is  a
           SIGTSTP (usually sent by typing Ctrl-Z)

       At  the  end  of  executions,  <b>kanif</b>  also  reports a quick summary of failures: connections and commands
       execution.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       To help administrators in their task, <b>kanif</b> options syntax is as close as possible  to  C3/pdsh/dsh  well
       known tools.

       <b>-a</b>
       <b>--all</b>
           Deploys on all nodes of all configured clusters.

       <b>-f</b> conf-file
       <b>--file</b> conf-file
           Uses  "conf-file"  as  configuration  file instead of default. Several possibilities are examined for
           default configuration file, in order: "$HOME/.kanif.conf", "/etc/kanif.conf", "/etc/c3.conf".

       <b>-F</b>
       <b>--flat-deployment</b>
           Deploys all remote execution from the root node (which executes  kanif).  Useful  when  remote  nodes
           cannot log on each other.

       <b>-H</b>
       <b>--head</b>
           Deploys only on clusters "head" node (using local interface) for all specified clusters.

       <b>-h</b>
       <b>--help</b>
           Prints a short help text and exits.

       <b>-i</b>
       <b>--interactive</b>
           Asks  confirmation  before  any  action.  An action is either the execution of one command on all the
           hosts (default) or the execution of one command on one host (sequential mode, see <b>-s</b> switch).

       <b>-l</b> login
       <b>--login</b> login
           Uses the given "login" to connect to remote hosts.

       <b>-M</b> machines-list
       <b>--list</b> machines-list
           Adds to the remote hosts the names contained in the file named "machines-list". <b>kanif</b> accepts as many
           <b>-M</b> options as you wish.

       <b>-m</b>
       <b>--monitoring</b>
           Makes <b>kanif</b> more verbose about whats happening during deployment commands execution.

       <b>-n</b> nodes
       <b>--nodes</b> nodes
           Adds the given "nodes" to the deployment. See section "HOSTNAMES SPECIFICATION" for more  information
           about "nodes" syntax.  <b>kanif</b> accepts as many <b>-n</b> options as you wish.

       <b>-o</b> options
       <b>--remote-opts</b> options
           Sets additional options to be passed to the remote shell command.

       <b>-p</b> level
       <b>--postprocess</b> level
           Sets  the  level  of  output formatting made in <b>kanif</b>. The general idea is: the higher the level, the
           more sorted, merged and human readable the output. Default is 4, different levels are:

           0   No processing at all: raw commands output is printed to stdout and raw commands error is  printed
               to stderr. Connections and executions errors are not reported.

           1   Same  as  0  except  that the name of the host which produced the output is prepended before each
               line.

           2   Same as 1 except that the output is sorted by command (one complete command execution is outputed
               entirely before another one). Connections and executions errors are  summarized  at  the  end  to
               stderr.

           3   Same as 2 except that the hostname is printed once, formatted as a title, before its output.

           4   Same  as  3  except that identical output produced by multiple nodes is printed once with all the
               hosts summarized in the title.

       <b>-q</b>
       <b>--dry-run</b>
           When this option is given, <b>kanif</b> does nothing and prints its configuration, the remote nodes it would
           have tried to contact and the <b>TakTuk</b> command that would have been executed.

       <b>-r</b> command
       <b>--remote-cmd</b> command
           Sets  the  name  of  the  "command"  used   to   contact   remote   hosts   (default   is   "ssh   -o
           StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o BatchMode=yes").

       <b>-s</b>
       <b>--sequential</b>
           Each  command  is executed sequentially on remote hosts (using the order given on the command line as
           hosts order).

       <b>-T</b> options
       <b>--taktuk-options</b> options
           Allows power users to pass some options to the <b>TakTuk</b> command executed (caution:  always  include  <b>-s</b>
           which is the default unless you really know what you are doing).

       <b>-t</b> timeout
       <b>--timeout</b> timeout
           Gives  a  timeout value for connection attempts. At expiration, connection is canceled and deployment
           on the remote host is aborted.

       <b>-u</b> timeout
       <b>--upper-limit</b> timeout
           Gives a timeout value for commands execution. At expiration the command is killed with a TERM signal.

       <b>-V</b>
       <b>--version</b>
           Prints <b>kanif</b> version and exits.

       <b>-w</b>
       <b>-wcoll</b>
           Synonym to <b>-n</b>.

       <b>-x</b> nodes
       <b>--exclude</b> nodes
           Excludes some nodes from the ones given using <b>-n</b> or <b>-w</b>. Applies to all hosts sets that do not already
           contain an exclusion part. Does not apply to host given with <b>-M</b> option.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       Usually all <b>kanif</b> options can be set by environment variables.  The rationale  is  that  boolean  options
       have 0/1 value and environment settings are overridden by command line switches.

       The name of an environment variable used by <b>kanif</b> is made of the long option name capitalized with dashes
       replaced by underscores and "KANIF_" prepended (for instance "KANIF_ALL", "KANIF_HEAD", and so on).  This
       rule admits the following exceptions (that have been chosen to mimic C3/dsh behavior):

       KANIF_CONF
           Instead of KANIF_FILE for configuration file.

       KANIF_USER
           Instead of KANIF_LOGIN for login name.

       Notice also that the variable KANIF_WCOLL has no meaning to <b>kanif</b>.

</pre><h4><b>HOSTNAMES</b> <b>SPECIFICATION</b></h4><pre>
       Hostnames  given  to  <b>kanif</b>  might  be  simple machine name or complex hosts lists specifications. In its
       general form, an hostname is made of an host set and an optional exclusion  set  separated  by  a  slash.
       Each  of  those  sets  is  a  comma  separated list of host templates. Each of these templates is made of
       constant parts (characters outside brackets) and optional range parts (characters inside brackets).  Each
       range  part  is a comma separated list of intervals or single values. Each interval is made of two single
       values separated by a dash. This is true for all  hostnames  given  to  <b>kanif</b>  (both  with  <b>-M</b>  or  <b>-n/-w</b>
       options).

       In other words, the following expressions are valid host specifications:
           node1
           node[19]
           node[1-3]
           node[1-3],otherhost/node2
           node[1-3,5]part[a-b]/node[3-5]parta,node1partb

       they respectively expand to:
           node1
           node19
           node1 node2 node3
           node1 node3 otherhost
           node1parta node2parta node2partb node3partb node5partb

       Notice  that  these  list  of  values are not regular expressions ("node[19]" is "node19" and not "node1,
       node2, ...., node9"). Intervals are implemented using the perl magical auto increment feature,  thus  you
       can  use  alphanumeric  values as interval bounds (see perl documentation, operator ++ for limitations of
       this auto increment).

</pre><h4><b>MACHINES</b> <b>SPECIFICATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       With <b>kanif</b>, you can specify the remote nodes on which you want to do some stuff using  the  command  line
       switches  (<b>-n</b>  and <b>-x</b>, pdsh/dsh style), using machines specifications (C3 style) or both. Thus, this part
       of the documentation might be ignored if you do not want to use C3 style nodes management.

       To use machines specification you must describe your cluster in a configuration file (see <b>-f</b>  option  and
       <b><a href="../man5/kanif.conf.5.html">kanif.conf</a></b>(5)).  Machines specifications are nodes intervals taken from clusters defined in this file.

       A  machine  specification  is  an  optional  cluster  name followed by a colon and an optional range. The
       default cluster is taken if no cluster name is given.  All the nodes of the cluster are taken if no range
       is given. Notice that if none of <b>-n</b>/<b>-w</b>, <b>-M</b> or machine specification is given on  the  command  line,  the
       remote hosts are assumed to be all the nodes of the default cluster.

</pre><h4><b>COMMAND</b> <b>BODY</b></h4><pre>
       Depending  on  the  name  used to invoke it (<b>kash</b>, <b>kaput</b> or <b>kaget</b>), <b>kanif</b> does not perform the same task.
       Here are its various behavior:

       <b>kash</b> [options] [command line]
           Executes the last part of the command line on all the remote hosts.  If  this  last  part  is  empty,
           enters  interactive  mode  in  which  <b>kanif</b> waits for command (one per line) on stdin. In interactive
           mode, just send an EOF character (Ctrl-D) to exit kash.

       <b>kaput</b> [options] src1 [src2 ...] dest
           Copies one ore more files or directories to all the remote hosts. The last argument is  the  path  to
           the  destination  file  or  directory  on the remote machine.  The other arguments are local files or
           directories to copy. Behavior and limitations are similar to the command <a href="../man1/cp.1.html">cp</a>(1).

       <b>kaget</b> [options] src1 [src2 ...] dest
           Download one ore more files or directories from all the remote hosts. The last argument is  the  path
           to  the  destination  directory  on  the  local  machine.  The  other  arguments are path to files or
           directories on remote hosts. Each source must be present on all the remote hosts. Sources are  copied
           to the destination directory having the originating host appended to their name.

       Notice  that  when  using <b>kaget</b> or <b>kaput</b> each file or directory is completely copied before proceeding to
       the next one.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       When a configuration file exists on the system or is given on the command line (see  option  <b>-f</b>),  remote
       machines  can  be specified via clusters names. For instance, the simple execution of the command "ls -l"
       on all the nodes of the cluster named "megacluster" can be written:

           kash megacluster: ls -l

       Intervals can also be given. The following command copies the local .cshrc file to the login directory of
       a subset of the default cluster and another subset of the "megacluster":

           kaput :3-6 megacluster:2-5 $HOME/.cshrc .

       Finally, one can take advantage of the default behavior to gather a file named  "results.txt"  placed  in
       the "<a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a>" directory on all the nodes of the default cluster to the local directory "results":

           kaget /tmp/results.txt results

       When  a  user does not want to write a configuration file or just wants to deploy on some other nodes, it
       is possible to give remote hosts on the command line:

           kash -n localhost,supernode uptime

       This last command will just execute "uptime"  on  "localhost"  and  "supernode".   Giving  intervals  and
       exclusion   lists  is  also  possible  on  the  command  line.  The  following  command  copie  the  file
       "/tmp/temporary.txt" to the remote "<a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a>" directories of node1 and node5:

           kaput -n node[1-6] -x node[2-4],node6 /tmp/temporary.txt <a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a>

       Finally, without entering into the details of each option, the final command illustrates the  <b>-u</b>  option.
       It executes during 5 seconds a "ping" to "gateway" from 5 nodes:

           kash -n node[1-2],node[4-6] -u 5 ping gateway

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Missing features:

       •   indirect clusters not supported (see C3 documentation about such clusters)

       •   when  there  are  no  machine  to  deploy and <b>kanif</b> runs in interactive mode, kanif still waits for a
           command (or eof) before exiting

       Performance issues:

       •   the algorithm used by <b>kaput</b> is not very efficient for transferring large files. Although the  precise
           limit depends on the machine, it should not scale well above a few hundreds of megabytes.
