</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ssh</b>  (SSH  client)  is a program for logging into a remote machine and for executing commands on a remote
       machine.  It is intended to provide secure encrypted communications between two untrusted hosts  over  an
       insecure  network.   X11  connections,  arbitrary TCP ports and Unix-domain sockets can also be forwarded
       over the secure channel.

       <b>ssh</b> connects and logs into the specified <u>hostname</u> (with optional <u>user</u> name).  The user must prove his/her
       identity to the remote machine using one of several methods (see below).

       If <u>command</u> is specified, it is executed on the remote host instead of a login shell.

       The options are as follows:

       <b>-1</b>      Forces <b>ssh</b> to try protocol version 1 only.

       <b>-2</b>      Forces <b>ssh</b> to try protocol version 2 only.

       <b>-4</b>      Forces <b>ssh</b> to use IPv4 addresses only.

       <b>-6</b>      Forces <b>ssh</b> to use IPv6 addresses only.

       <b>-A</b>      Enables forwarding of the authentication agent connection.  This can also be specified on a  per-
               host basis in a configuration file.

               Agent  forwarding  should  be  enabled  with  caution.   Users  with  the  ability to bypass file
               permissions on the remote host (for the agent's Unix-domain socket) can access  the  local  agent
               through the forwarded connection.  An attacker cannot obtain key material from the agent, however
               they  can  perform  operations  on the keys that enable them to authenticate using the identities
               loaded into the agent.

       <b>-a</b>      Disables forwarding of the authentication agent connection.

       <b>-b</b> <u>bind_address</u>
               Use <u>bind_address</u> on the local machine as the source address of the connection.   Only  useful  on
               systems with more than one address.

       <b>-C</b>      Requests  compression  of  all data (including stdin, stdout, stderr, and data for forwarded X11,
               TCP and Unix-domain connections).  The compression algorithm is the same used by <u><a href="../man1/gzip.1.html">gzip</a></u>(1), and the
               “level” can be controlled by the <b>CompressionLevel</b> option for protocol version 1.  Compression  is
               desirable  on  modem  lines  and  other  slow connections, but will only slow down things on fast
               networks.  The default value can be set on a host-by-host basis in the configuration  files;  see
               the <b>Compression</b> option.

       <b>-c</b> <u>cipher_spec</u>
               Selects the cipher specification for encrypting the session.

               Protocol  version  1  allows  specification of a single cipher.  The supported values are “3des”,
               “blowfish”, and “des”.  For protocol version 2, <u>cipher_spec</u> is a comma-separated list of  ciphers
               listed in order of preference.  See the <b>Ciphers</b> keyword in <u><a href="../man5/ssh_config.5.html">ssh_config</a></u>(5) for more information.

       <b>-D</b> [<u>bind_address</u>:]<u>port</u>
               Specifies a local “dynamic” application-level port forwarding.  This works by allocating a socket
               to  listen to <u>port</u> on the local side, optionally bound to the specified <u>bind_address</u>.  Whenever a
               connection is made to this port, the connection is forwarded over the  secure  channel,  and  the
               application  protocol  is  then  used  to  determine where to connect to from the remote machine.
               Currently the SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols are supported, and <b>ssh</b> will  act  as  a  SOCKS  server.
               Only  root  can  forward privileged ports.  Dynamic port forwardings can also be specified in the
               configuration file.

               IPv6 addresses can be specified by enclosing the address in square brackets.  Only the  superuser
               can  forward  privileged  ports.   By  default,  the  local  port is bound in accordance with the
               <b>GatewayPorts</b> setting.  However, an explicit <u>bind_address</u> may be used to bind the connection to  a
               specific address.  The <u>bind_address</u> of “localhost” indicates that the listening port be bound for
               local  use  only,  while an empty address or ‘*’ indicates that the port should be available from
               all interfaces.

       <b>-E</b> <u>log_file</u>
               Append debug logs to <u>log_file</u> instead of standard error.

       <b>-e</b> <u>escape_char</u>
               Sets the escape character for sessions with a pty (default: ‘~’).  The escape character  is  only
               recognized  at  the beginning of a line.  The escape character followed by a dot (‘.’) closes the
               connection; followed by control-Z suspends the connection;  and  followed  by  itself  sends  the
               escape  character  once.   Setting  the  character  to  “none” disables any escapes and makes the
               session fully transparent.

       <b>-F</b> <u>configfile</u>
               Specifies an alternative per-user configuration file.  If a configuration file is  given  on  the
               command  line,  the  system-wide  configuration  file (<u><a href="file:/etc/ssh/ssh_config">/etc/ssh/ssh_config</a></u>) will be ignored.  The
               default for the per-user configuration file is <u><a href="file:~/.ssh/config">~/.ssh/config</a></u>.

       <b>-f</b>      Requests <b>ssh</b> to go to background just before command execution.  This is useful if <b>ssh</b>  is  going
               to  ask  for passwords or passphrases, but the user wants it in the background.  This implies <b>-n</b>.
               The recommended way to start X11 programs at a remote site is with something  like  <b>ssh</b>  <b>-f</b>  <b>host</b>
               <b>xterm</b>.

               If  the  <b>ExitOnForwardFailure</b> configuration option is set to “yes”, then a client started with <b>-f</b>
               will wait for all remote port forwards to be successfully established before  placing  itself  in
               the background.

       <b>-G</b>      Causes <b>ssh</b> to print its configuration after evaluating <b>Host</b> and <b>Match</b> blocks and exit.

       <b>-g</b>      Allows  remote  hosts  to connect to local forwarded ports.  If used on a multiplexed connection,
               then this option must be specified on the master process.

       <b>-I</b> <u>pkcs11</u>
               Specify the PKCS#11 shared library <b>ssh</b> should use to communicate with a PKCS#11  token  providing
               the user's private RSA key.

       <b>-i</b> <u>identity_file</u>
               Selects  a file from which the identity (private key) for public key authentication is read.  The
               default  is  <u><a href="file:~/.ssh/identity">~/.ssh/identity</a></u>  for  protocol  version  1,  and   <u><a href="file:~/.ssh/id_dsa">~/.ssh/id_dsa</a></u>,   <u><a href="file:~/.ssh/id_ecdsa">~/.ssh/id_ecdsa</a></u>,
               <u><a href="file:~/.ssh/id_ed25519">~/.ssh/id_ed25519</a></u> and <u><a href="file:~/.ssh/id_rsa">~/.ssh/id_rsa</a></u> for protocol version 2.  Identity files may also be specified
               on  a  per-host basis in the configuration file.  It is possible to have multiple <b>-i</b> options (and
               multiple identities specified in configuration files).  If no certificates have  been  explicitly
               specified  by  the  <b>CertificateFile</b>  directive, <b>ssh</b> will also try to load certificate information
               from the filename obtained by appending <u>-cert.pub</u> to identity filenames.

       <b>-J</b> [<u>user</u>@]<u>host</u>[:<u>port</u>]
               Connect to the target host  by  first  making  a  <b>ssh</b>  connection  to  the  jump  <u>host</u>  and  then
               establishing  a TCP forwarding to the ultimate destination from there.  Multiple jump hops may be
               specified separated by comma characters.  This is a shortcut to specify a <b>ProxyJump</b> configuration
               directive.

       <b>-K</b>      Enables GSSAPI-based authentication and forwarding (delegation)  of  GSSAPI  credentials  to  the
               server.

       <b>-k</b>      Disables forwarding (delegation) of GSSAPI credentials to the server.

       <b>-L</b> [<u>bind_address</u>:]<u>port</u>:<u>host</u>:<u>hostport</u>
       <b>-L</b> [<u>bind_address</u>:]<u>port</u>:<u>remote_socket</u>
       <b>-L</b> <u>local_socket</u>:<u>host</u>:<u>hostport</u>
       <b>-L</b> <u>local_socket</u>:<u>remote_socket</u>
               Specifies that connections to the given TCP port or Unix socket on the local (client) host are to
               be  forwarded  to  the  given  host  and port, or Unix socket, on the remote side.  This works by
               allocating a socket to listen to either a TCP <u>port</u> on the local side,  optionally  bound  to  the
               specified  <u>bind_address</u>, or to a Unix socket.  Whenever a connection is made to the local port or
               socket, the connection is forwarded over the secure channel, and a connection is made  to  either
               <u>host</u> port <u>hostport</u>, or the Unix socket <u>remote_socket</u>, from the remote machine.

               Port forwardings can also be specified in the configuration file.  Only the superuser can forward
               privileged ports.  IPv6 addresses can be specified by enclosing the address in square brackets.

               By  default,  the  local  port is bound in accordance with the <b>GatewayPorts</b> setting.  However, an
               explicit <u>bind_address</u> may be used to bind the connection to a specific address.  The <u>bind_address</u>
               of “localhost” indicates that the listening port be bound for local  use  only,  while  an  empty
               address or ‘*’ indicates that the port should be available from all interfaces.

       <b>-l</b> <u>login_name</u>
               Specifies  the user to log in as on the remote machine.  This also may be specified on a per-host
               basis in the configuration file.

       <b>-M</b>      Places the <b>ssh</b> client into “master” mode for connection sharing.  Multiple <b>-M</b> options places  <b>ssh</b>
               into  “master”  mode  with confirmation required before slave connections are accepted.  Refer to
               the description of <b>ControlMaster</b> in <u><a href="../man5/ssh_config.5.html">ssh_config</a></u>(5) for details.

       <b>-m</b> <u>mac_spec</u>
               A comma-separated list of MAC (message authentication code) algorithms,  specified  in  order  of
               preference.  See the <b>MACs</b> keyword for more information.

       <b>-N</b>      Do not execute a remote command.  This is useful for just forwarding ports.

       <b>-n</b>      Redirects  stdin  from <u>/dev/null</u> (actually, prevents reading from stdin).  This must be used when
               <b>ssh</b> is run in the background.  A common trick is to use this to run  X11  programs  on  a  remote
               machine.  For example, <b>ssh</b> <b>-n</b> <b>shadows.cs.hut.fi</b> <b>emacs</b> <b>&amp;</b> will start an emacs on shadows.cs.hut.fi,
               and  the  X11  connection  will  be  automatically  forwarded over an encrypted channel.  The <b>ssh</b>
               program will be put in the background.  (This does not work if <b>ssh</b> needs to ask for a password or
               passphrase; see also the <b>-f</b> option.)

       <b>-O</b> <u>ctl_cmd</u>
               Control an active connection multiplexing master process.  When the <b>-O</b> option is  specified,  the
               <u>ctl_cmd</u>  argument  is  interpreted and passed to the master process.  Valid commands are: “check”
               (check that the master process  is  running),  “forward”  (request  forwardings  without  command
               execution),  “cancel”  (cancel  forwardings),  “exit”  (request  the  master to exit), and “stop”
               (request the master to stop accepting further multiplexing requests).

       <b>-o</b> <u>option</u>
               Can be used to give options in the format used in the configuration file.   This  is  useful  for
               specifying  options  for  which  there is no separate command-line flag.  For full details of the
               options listed below, and their possible values, see <u><a href="../man5/ssh_config.5.html">ssh_config</a></u>(5).

               configuration file.

       <b>-Q</b> <u>query_option</u>
               Queries  <b>ssh</b>  for  the  algorithms supported for the specified version 2.  The available features
               are: <u>cipher</u> (supported symmetric ciphers), <u>cipher-auth</u> (supported symmetric ciphers that  support

               algorithms), <u>key</u> (key types), <u>key-cert</u> (certificate key types),  <u>key-plain</u>  (non-certificate  key
               types), and <u>protocol-version</u> (supported SSH protocol versions).

       <b>-q</b>      Quiet mode.  Causes most warning and diagnostic messages to be suppressed.

       <b>-R</b> <u>remote_socket</u>:<u>host</u>:<u>hostport</u>
       <b>-R</b> <u>remote_socket</u>:<u>local_socket</u>
               Specifies  that  connections to the given TCP port or Unix socket on the remote (server) host are
               to be forwarded to the given host and port, or Unix socket, on the local  side.   This  works  by
               allocating  a  socket  to  listen  to  either  a TCP <u>port</u> or to a Unix socket on the remote side.
               Whenever a connection is made to this port or Unix socket, the connection is forwarded  over  the
               secure  channel, and a connection is made to either <u>host</u> port <u>hostport</u>, or <u>local_socket</u>, from the
               local machine.

               Port forwardings can also be specified in  the  configuration  file.   Privileged  ports  can  be
               forwarded only when logging in as root on the remote machine.  IPv6 addresses can be specified by
               enclosing the address in square brackets.

               By  default,  TCP  listening  sockets on the server will be bound to the loopback interface only.
               This may be overridden by specifying a <u>bind_address</u>.  An empty <u>bind_address</u>, or the address  ‘*’,
               indicates  that  the  remote  socket  should  listen  on  all  interfaces.   Specifying  a remote
               <u>bind_address</u>  will  only  succeed  if  the  server's  <b>GatewayPorts</b>   option   is   enabled   (see
               <u><a href="../man5/sshd_config.5.html">sshd_config</a></u>(5)).

               If  the  <u>port</u>  argument  is  ‘0’, the listen port will be dynamically allocated on the server and
               reported to the client at run time.  When used together with <b>-O</b> <b>forward</b> the allocated  port  will
               be printed to the standard output.

       <b>-S</b> <u>ctl_path</u>
               Specifies  the  location  of  a  control  socket  for connection sharing, or the string “none” to
               disable connection sharing.  Refer  to  the  description  of  <b>ControlPath</b>  and  <b>ControlMaster</b>  in
               <u><a href="../man5/ssh_config.5.html">ssh_config</a></u>(5) for details.

       <b>-s</b>      May be used to request invocation of a subsystem on the remote system.  Subsystems facilitate the
               use  of  SSH  as  a  secure  transport  for  other applications (e.g. <u><a href="../man1/sftp.1.html">sftp</a></u>(1)).  The subsystem is
               specified as the remote command.

       <b>-T</b>      Disable pseudo-terminal allocation.

       <b>-t</b>      Force pseudo-terminal allocation.  This can be used to execute arbitrary screen-based programs on
               a remote machine, which can be very useful, e.g. when implementing menu  services.   Multiple  <b>-t</b>
               options force tty allocation, even if <b>ssh</b> has no local tty.

       <b>-V</b>      Display the version number and exit.

       <b>-v</b>      Verbose  mode.   Causes  <b>ssh</b>  to print debugging messages about its progress.  This is helpful in
               debugging connection, authentication, and configuration problems.  Multiple <b>-v</b>  options  increase
               the verbosity.  The maximum is 3.

       <b>-W</b> <u>host</u>:<u>port</u>
               Requests  that  standard  input  and  output  on the client be forwarded to <u>host</u> on <u>port</u> over the
               secure channel.  Implies <b>-N</b>, <b>-T</b>, <b>ExitOnForwardFailure</b> and <b>ClearAllForwardings</b>, though  these  can
               be overridden in the configuration file or using <b>-o</b> command line options.

       <b>-w</b> <u>local_tun</u>[:<u>remote_tun</u>]
               Requests  tunnel  device  forwarding  with  the  specified  <u><a href="../man4/tun.4.html">tun</a></u>(4)  devices  between  the  client
               (<u>local_tun</u>) and the server (<u>remote_tun</u>).

               The devices may be specified by numerical ID or the keyword “any”, which uses the next  available
               tunnel  device.   If  <u>remote_tun</u> is not specified, it defaults to “any”.  See also the <b>Tunnel</b> and
               <b>TunnelDevice</b> directives in <u><a href="../man5/ssh_config.5.html">ssh_config</a></u>(5).  If the <b>Tunnel</b> directive is unset, it  is  set  to  the
               default tunnel mode, which is “point-to-point”.

       <b>-X</b>      Enables X11 forwarding.  This can also be specified on a per-host basis in a configuration file.

               X11 forwarding should be enabled with caution.  Users with the ability to bypass file permissions
               on  the  remote  host  (for the user's X authorization database) can access the local X11 display
               through the forwarded connection.  An attacker may then be able to  perform  activities  such  as
               keystroke monitoring.

               For  this  reason, X11 forwarding is subjected to X11 SECURITY extension restrictions by default.
               Please refer to the <b>ssh</b> <b>-Y</b> option and the <b>ForwardX11Trusted</b> directive in <u><a href="../man5/ssh_config.5.html">ssh_config</a></u>(5)  for  more
               information.

               (Debian-specific:  X11  forwarding  is  not  subjected  to X11 SECURITY extension restrictions by
               default, because too many programs currently crash  in  this  mode.   Set  the  <b>ForwardX11Trusted</b>
               option to “no” to restore the upstream behaviour.  This may change in future depending on client-
               side improvements.)

       <b>-x</b>      Disables X11 forwarding.

       <b>-Y</b>      Enables  trusted  X11  forwarding.  Trusted X11 forwardings are not subjected to the X11 SECURITY
               extension controls.

               (Debian-specific: This option does nothing in the default  configuration:  it  is  equivalent  to
               “<b>ForwardX11Trusted</b>  yes”,  which  is  the  default as described above.  Set the <b>ForwardX11Trusted</b>
               option to “no” to restore the upstream behaviour.  This may change in future depending on client-
               side improvements.)

       <b>-y</b>      Send log information using the <u><a href="../man3/syslog.3.html">syslog</a></u>(3) system module.  By default this information is  sent  to
               stderr.

       <b>ssh</b>  may  additionally  obtain  configuration  data  from a per-user configuration file and a system-wide
       configuration file.  The file format and configuration options are described in <u><a href="../man5/ssh_config.5.html">ssh_config</a></u>(5).

</pre><h4><b>AUTHENTICATION</b></h4><pre>
       The OpenSSH SSH client supports SSH protocols 1 and 2.  The default is to use  protocol  2  only,  though
       this  can  be  changed  via  the  <b>Protocol</b>  option in <u><a href="../man5/ssh_config.5.html">ssh_config</a></u>(5) or the <b>-1</b> and <b>-2</b> options (see above).
       Protocol 1 should not be used and is only offered to support legacy devices.  It suffers from a number of
       cryptographic weaknesses and doesn't support many of the advanced features available for protocol 2.

       The methods available for authentication are:  GSSAPI-based  authentication,  host-based  authentication,
       public    key   authentication,   challenge-response   authentication,   and   password   authentication.
       Authentication methods are tried in the order specified above,  though  <b>PreferredAuthentications</b>  can  be
       used to change the default order.

       Host-based  authentication  works  as  follows:  If  the  machine  the  user  logs  in  from is listed in
       <u>/etc/hosts.equiv</u> or <u>/etc/ssh/shosts.equiv</u> on the remote machine, and the user names are the same on  both
       sides,  or  if  the files <u><a href="file:~/.rhosts">~/.rhosts</a></u> or <u><a href="file:~/.shosts">~/.shosts</a></u> exist in the user's home directory on the remote machine
       and contain a line containing the name of the client machine and the name of the user  on  that  machine,
       the  user is considered for login.  Additionally, the server <u>must</u> be able to verify the client's host key
       (see the  description  of  <u>/etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts</u>  and  <u><a href="file:~/.ssh/known_hosts">~/.ssh/known_hosts</a></u>,  below)  for  login  to  be
       permitted.   This  authentication  method  closes  security  holes  due to IP spoofing, DNS spoofing, and
       routing spoofing.  [Note to the administrator: <u>/etc/hosts.equiv</u>, <u><a href="file:~/.rhosts">~/.rhosts</a></u>, and the  rlogin/rsh  protocol
       in general, are inherently insecure and should be disabled if security is desired.]

       Public  key  authentication  works  as  follows:  The  scheme  is based on public-key cryptography, using
       cryptosystems where encryption and decryption are done using separate  keys,  and  it  is  unfeasible  to
       derive  the  decryption key from the encryption key.  The idea is that each user creates a public/private
       key pair for authentication purposes.  The server knows the public key,  and  only  the  user  knows  the
       private  key.   <b>ssh</b>  implements  public  key authentication protocol automatically, using one of the DSA,
       ECDSA, Ed25519  or  RSA  algorithms.   The  HISTORY  section  of  <u><a href="../man8/ssl.8.html">ssl</a></u>(8)  (on  non-OpenBSD  systems,  see
       <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi">http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi</a>?query=ssl&amp;sektion=8#HISTORY)  contains  a  brief discussion of the
       DSA and RSA algorithms.

       The file <u><a href="file:~/.ssh/authorized_keys">~/.ssh/authorized_keys</a></u> lists the public keys that are permitted for logging in.  When  the  user
       logs  in,  the  <b>ssh</b> program tells the server which key pair it would like to use for authentication.  The
       client proves that it has access to the private key and the server checks that the  corresponding  public
       key is authorized to accept the account.

       The  user  creates  his/her  key  pair  by  running  <u><a href="../man1/ssh-keygen.1.html">ssh-keygen</a></u>(1).   This  stores  the  private  key  in
       <u><a href="file:~/.ssh/identity">~/.ssh/identity</a></u> (protocol 1), <u><a href="file:~/.ssh/id_dsa">~/.ssh/id_dsa</a></u> (DSA), <u><a href="file:~/.ssh/id_ecdsa">~/.ssh/id_ecdsa</a></u> (ECDSA), <u><a href="file:~/.ssh/id_ed25519">~/.ssh/id_ed25519</a></u>  (Ed25519),
       or  <u><a href="file:~/.ssh/id_rsa">~/.ssh/id_rsa</a></u>  (RSA) and stores the public key in <u><a href="file:~/.ssh/identity.pub">~/.ssh/identity.pub</a></u> (protocol 1), <u><a href="file:~/.ssh/id_dsa.pub">~/.ssh/id_dsa.pub</a></u>
       (DSA), <u><a href="file:~/.ssh/id_ecdsa.pub">~/.ssh/id_ecdsa.pub</a></u> (ECDSA), <u><a href="file:~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub">~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub</a></u> (Ed25519), or <u><a href="file:~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub">~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub</a></u>  (RSA)  in  the
       user's  home  directory.   The  user should then copy the public key to <u><a href="file:~/.ssh/authorized_keys">~/.ssh/authorized_keys</a></u> in his/her
       home directory on the remote machine.  The <u>authorized_keys</u> file corresponds to the conventional <u><a href="file:~/.rhosts">~/.rhosts</a></u>
       file, and has one key per line, though the lines can be very long.  After  this,  the  user  can  log  in
       without giving the password.

       A  variation on public key authentication is available in the form of certificate authentication: instead
       of a set of public/private keys, signed certificates are used.  This has  the  advantage  that  a  single
       trusted  certification  authority can be used in place of many public/private keys.  See the CERTIFICATES
       section of <u><a href="../man1/ssh-keygen.1.html">ssh-keygen</a></u>(1) for more information.

       The most convenient way to use public key or certificate authentication may  be  with  an  authentication
       agent.   See  <u><a href="../man1/ssh-agent.1.html">ssh-agent</a></u>(1)  and  (optionally)  the  <b>AddKeysToAgent</b>  directive  in  <u><a href="../man5/ssh_config.5.html">ssh_config</a></u>(5) for more
       information.

       Challenge-response authentication works as follows: The server sends an arbitrary "challenge"  text,  and
       prompts  for  a  response.  Examples of challenge-response authentication include BSD Authentication (see
       <u><a href="../man5/login.conf.5.html">login.conf</a></u>(5)) and PAM (some non-OpenBSD systems).

       Finally, if other authentication methods fail, <b>ssh</b> prompts the user for a password.  The password is sent
       to the remote host for checking; however, since all communications are encrypted, the password cannot  be
       seen by someone listening on the network.

       <b>ssh</b>  automatically  maintains  and  checks a database containing identification for all hosts it has ever
       been used with.  Host keys are stored in <u><a href="file:~/.ssh/known_hosts">~/.ssh/known_hosts</a></u> in the user's home directory.   Additionally,
       the  file  <u>/etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts</u>  is  automatically  checked  for  known  hosts.   Any  new  hosts are
       automatically added to the user's file.  If a host's identification ever changes, <b>ssh</b>  warns  about  this
       and disables password authentication to prevent server spoofing or man-in-the-middle attacks, which could
       otherwise  be used to circumvent the encryption.  The <b>StrictHostKeyChecking</b> option can be used to control
       logins to machines whose host key is not known or has changed.

       When the user's identity has been accepted by the server, the server either executes the given command in
       a non-interactive session or, if no command has been specified, logs into the machine and gives the  user
       a  normal  shell  as  an interactive session.  All communication with the remote command or shell will be
       automatically encrypted.

       If an interactive session is requested <b>ssh</b> by default will  only  request  a  pseudo-terminal  (pty)  for
       interactive  sessions  when  the  client  has  one.   The  flags  <b>-T</b>  and <b>-t</b> can be used to override this
       behaviour.

       If a pseudo-terminal has been allocated the user may use the escape characters noted below.

       If no pseudo-terminal has been allocated, the session is transparent and can be used to reliably transfer
       binary data.  On most systems, setting the  escape  character  to  “none”  will  also  make  the  session
       transparent even if a tty is used.

       The  session  terminates  when  the  command  or  shell  on  the remote machine exits and all X11 and TCP
       connections have been closed.

</pre><h4><b>ESCAPE</b> <b>CHARACTERS</b></h4><pre>
       When a pseudo-terminal has been requested, <b>ssh</b> supports a number of  functions  through  the  use  of  an
       escape character.

       A  single  tilde  character  can  be sent as <b>~~</b> or by following the tilde by a character other than those
       described below.  The escape character must always follow a newline to be interpreted  as  special.   The
       escape character can be changed in configuration files using the <b>EscapeChar</b> configuration directive or on
       the command line by the <b>-e</b> option.

       The supported escapes (assuming the default ‘~’) are:

       <b>~.</b>      Disconnect.

       <b>~^Z</b>     Background <b>ssh</b>.

       <b>~#</b>      List forwarded connections.

       <b>~&amp;</b>      Background <b>ssh</b> at logout when waiting for forwarded connection / X11 sessions to terminate.

       <b>~?</b>      Display a list of escape characters.

       <b>~B</b>      Send a BREAK to the remote system (only useful if the peer supports it).

       <b>~C</b>      Open  command  line.  Currently this allows the addition of port forwardings using the <b>-L</b>, <b>-R</b> and
               <b>-D</b> options (see above).  It also  allows  the  cancellation  of  existing  port-forwardings  with
               <b>-KL</b>[<u>bind_address</u>:]<u>port</u>  for  local,  <b>-KR</b>[<u>bind_address</u>:]<u>port</u> for remote and <b>-KD</b>[<u>bind_address</u>:]<u>port</u>
               for dynamic port-forwardings.  <b>!</b><u>command</u> allows the  user  to  execute  a  local  command  if  the
               <b>PermitLocalCommand</b>  option  is  enabled  in <u><a href="../man5/ssh_config.5.html">ssh_config</a></u>(5).  Basic help is available, using the <b>-h</b>
               option.

       <b>~R</b>      Request rekeying of the connection (only useful if the peer supports it).

       <b>~V</b>      Decrease the verbosity (<b>LogLevel</b>) when errors are being written to stderr.

       <b>~v</b>      Increase the verbosity (<b>LogLevel</b>) when errors are being written to stderr.

</pre><h4><b>TCP</b> <b>FORWARDING</b></h4><pre>
       Forwarding of arbitrary TCP connections over the secure channel can be specified either  on  the  command
       line  or in a configuration file.  One possible application of TCP forwarding is a secure connection to a
       mail server; another is going through firewalls.

       In the example below, we look at encrypting communication between an IRC client and server,  even  though
       the  IRC  server  does  not  directly  support encrypted communications.  This works as follows: the user
       connects to the remote host using <b>ssh</b>, specifying a port to be used to forward connections to the  remote
       server.   After  that it is possible to start the service which is to be encrypted on the client machine,
       connecting to the same local port, and <b>ssh</b> will encrypt and forward the connection.

       The following example tunnels an IRC session from client machine “127.0.0.1” (localhost) to remote server
       “server.example.com”:

           $ ssh -f -L 1234:localhost:6667 server.example.com sleep 10
           $ irc -c '#users' -p 1234 pinky 127.0.0.1

       This tunnels a connection to IRC server “server.example.com”, joining channel “#users”, nickname “pinky”,
       using port 1234.  It doesn't matter which port is used, as long as it's greater than 1023 (remember, only
       root can open sockets on privileged ports) and doesn't conflict with  any  ports  already  in  use.   The
       connection  is  forwarded  to  port  6667  on  the  remote server, since that's the standard port for IRC
       services.

       The <b>-f</b> option backgrounds <b>ssh</b> and the remote command “sleep 10” is specified to allow an amount  of  time
       (10  seconds,  in the example) to start the service which is to be tunnelled.  If no connections are made
       within the time specified, <b>ssh</b> will exit.

</pre><h4><b>X11</b> <b>FORWARDING</b></h4><pre>
       If the <b>ForwardX11</b> variable is set to “yes” (or see the description of the <b>-X</b>, <b>-x</b>, and <b>-Y</b>  options  above)
       and the user is using X11 (the DISPLAY environment variable is set), the connection to the X11 display is
       automatically forwarded to the remote side in such a way that any X11 programs started from the shell (or
       command) will go through the encrypted channel, and the connection to the real X server will be made from
       the  local  machine.   The  user  should  not manually set DISPLAY.  Forwarding of X11 connections can be
       configured on the command line or in configuration files.

       The DISPLAY value set by <b>ssh</b> will point to the server machine, but with a  display  number  greater  than
       zero.   This  is  normal,  and  happens  because <b>ssh</b> creates a “proxy” X server on the server machine for
       forwarding the connections over the encrypted channel.

       <b>ssh</b> will also automatically set up Xauthority data on the server machine.   For  this  purpose,  it  will
       generate  a  random  authorization  cookie,  store  it  in  Xauthority on the server, and verify that any
       forwarded connections carry this cookie and replace it by the real cookie when the connection is  opened.
       The  real  authentication  cookie  is  never  sent  to the server machine (and no cookies are sent in the
       plain).

       If the <b>ForwardAgent</b> variable is set to “yes” (or see the description of the <b>-A</b> and <b>-a</b> options above)  and
       the  user is using an authentication agent, the connection to the agent is automatically forwarded to the
       remote side.

</pre><h4><b>VERIFYING</b> <b>HOST</b> <b>KEYS</b></h4><pre>
       When connecting to a server for the first time, a fingerprint of the server's public key is presented  to
       the  user  (unless  the  option <b>StrictHostKeyChecking</b> has been disabled).  Fingerprints can be determined
       using <u><a href="../man1/ssh-keygen.1.html">ssh-keygen</a></u>(1):

             <b>$</b> <b>ssh-keygen</b> <b>-l</b> <b>-f</b> <b><a href="file:/etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key">/etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key</a></b>

       If the fingerprint is already known, it can be matched and the key can be accepted or rejected.  If  only
       legacy  (MD5)  fingerprints  for  the  server  are  available, the <u><a href="../man1/ssh-keygen.1.html">ssh-keygen</a></u>(1) <b>-E</b> option may be used to
       downgrade the fingerprint algorithm to match.

       Because of the difficulty of comparing host keys just by looking at fingerprint strings,  there  is  also
       support to compare host keys visually, using <u>random</u> <u>art</u>.  By setting the <b>VisualHostKey</b> option to “yes”, a
       small  ASCII  graphic  gets  displayed  on  every  login  to a server, no matter if the session itself is
       interactive or not.  By learning the pattern a known server produces, a user can easily find out that the
       host key has changed when a completely different pattern is displayed.  Because these  patterns  are  not
       unambiguous however, a pattern that looks similar to the pattern remembered only gives a good probability
       that the host key is the same, not guaranteed proof.

       To  get  a  listing  of  the  fingerprints along with their random art for all known hosts, the following
       command line can be used:

             <b>$</b> <b>ssh-keygen</b> <b>-lv</b> <b>-f</b> <b><a href="file:~/.ssh/known_hosts">~/.ssh/known_hosts</a></b>

       If the fingerprint is unknown, an alternative method  of  verification  is  available:  SSH  fingerprints
       verified  by  DNS.   An additional resource record (RR), SSHFP, is added to a zonefile and the connecting
       client is able to match the fingerprint with that of the key presented.

       In this example, we are connecting a client to a server, “host.example.com”.  The SSHFP resource  records
       should first be added to the zonefile for host.example.com:

             $ ssh-keygen -r host.example.com.

       The  output lines will have to be added to the zonefile.  To check that the zone is answering fingerprint
       queries:

             <b>$</b> <b>dig</b> <b>-t</b> <b>SSHFP</b> <b>host.example.com</b>

       Finally the client connects:

             $ ssh -o "VerifyHostKeyDNS ask" host.example.com
             [...]
             Matching host key fingerprint found in DNS.
             Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?

       See the <b>VerifyHostKeyDNS</b> option in <u><a href="../man5/ssh_config.5.html">ssh_config</a></u>(5) for more information.

</pre><h4><b>SSH-BASED</b> <b>VIRTUAL</b> <b>PRIVATE</b> <b>NETWORKS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ssh</b> contains support for Virtual Private Network (VPN) tunnelling using the <u><a href="../man4/tun.4.html">tun</a></u>(4) network pseudo-device,
       allowing two networks to be  joined  securely.   The  <u><a href="../man5/sshd_config.5.html">sshd_config</a></u>(5)  configuration  option  <b>PermitTunnel</b>
       controls whether the server supports this, and at what level (layer 2 or 3 traffic).

       The  following example would connect client network 10.0.50.0/24 with remote network 10.0.99.0/24 using a
       point-to-point connection from 10.1.1.1 to 10.1.1.2, provided that the SSH server running on the  gateway
       to the remote network, at 192.168.1.15, allows it.

       On the client:

             # ssh -f -w 0:1 192.168.1.15 true
             # ifconfig tun0 10.1.1.1 10.1.1.2 netmask 255.255.255.252
             # route add 10.0.99.0/24 10.1.1.2

       On the server:

             # ifconfig tun1 10.1.1.2 10.1.1.1 netmask 255.255.255.252
             # route add 10.0.50.0/24 10.1.1.1

       Client  access  may  be  more  finely  tuned  via the <u>/root/.ssh/authorized_keys</u> file (see below) and the
       <b>PermitRootLogin</b> server option.  The following entry would permit connections on <u><a href="../man4/tun.4.html">tun</a></u>(4) device 1 from user
       “jane” and on tun device 2 from user “john”, if <b>PermitRootLogin</b> is set to “forced-commands-only”:

         tunnel="1",command="sh /etc/netstart tun1" ssh-rsa ... jane
         tunnel="2",command="sh /etc/netstart tun2" ssh-rsa ... john

       Since an SSH-based setup entails a fair amount of overhead, it may be more suited  to  temporary  setups,
       such  as  for  wireless  VPNs.   More permanent VPNs are better provided by tools such as <u><a href="../man8/ipsecctl.8.html">ipsecctl</a></u>(8) and
       <u><a href="../man8/isakmpd.8.html">isakmpd</a></u>(8).

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ssh</b> will normally set the following environment variables:

       DISPLAY               The DISPLAY variable indicates the location of the X11 server.  It is automatically
                             set by <b>ssh</b> to point to a value of the form “hostname:n”, where “hostname” indicates
                             the host where the shell runs, and ‘n’ is an integer ≥ 1.  <b>ssh</b>  uses  this  special
                             value to forward X11 connections over the secure channel.  The user should normally
                             not  set  DISPLAY  explicitly, as that will render the X11 connection insecure (and
                             will require the user to manually copy any required authorization cookies).

       HOME                  Set to the path of the user's home directory.

       LOGNAME               Synonym for USER; set for compatibility with systems that use this variable.

       MAIL                  Set to the path of the user's mailbox.

       PATH                  Set to the default PATH, as specified when compiling <b>ssh</b>.

       SSH_ASKPASS           If <b>ssh</b> needs a passphrase, it will read the passphrase from the current terminal if
                             it was run from a terminal.  If <b>ssh</b> does not have a terminal associated with it but
                             DISPLAY and  SSH_ASKPASS  are  set,  it  will  execute  the  program  specified  by
                             SSH_ASKPASS  and  open  an X11 window to read the passphrase.  This is particularly
                             useful when calling <b>ssh</b> from a <u>.xsession</u> or related script.   (Note  that  on  some
                             machines  it  may  be  necessary  to redirect the input from <u>/dev/null</u> to make this
                             work.)

       SSH_AUTH_SOCK         Identifies the path of a Unix-domain socket used to communicate with the agent.

       SSH_CONNECTION        Identifies the client and server ends of the  connection.   The  variable  contains
                             four  space-separated  values:  client  IP  address,  client port number, server IP
                             address, and server port number.

       SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND  This variable contains the original command line if a forced command  is  executed.
                             It can be used to extract the original arguments.

       SSH_TTY               This is set to the name of the tty (path to the device) associated with the current
                             shell or command.  If the current session has no tty, this variable is not set.

       TZ                    This  variable  is  set  to  indicate  the present time zone if it was set when the
                             daemon was started (i.e. the daemon passes the value on to new connections).

       USER                  Set to the name of the user logging in.

       Additionally, <b>ssh</b> reads  <u><a href="file:~/.ssh/environment">~/.ssh/environment</a></u>,  and  adds  lines  of  the  format  “VARNAME=value”  to  the
       environment  if the file exists and users are allowed to change their environment.  For more information,
       see the <b>PermitUserEnvironment</b> option in <u><a href="../man5/sshd_config.5.html">sshd_config</a></u>(5).

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <u><a href="file:~/.rhosts">~/.rhosts</a></u>
               This file is used for host-based authentication (see above).  On some machines this file may need
               to be world-readable if the user's home directory is on an NFS partition, because  <u><a href="../man8/sshd.8.html">sshd</a></u>(8)  reads
               it  as  root.   Additionally,  this  file  must  be  owned  by  the user, and must not have write
               permissions for anyone else.  The recommended permission for most machines is read/write for  the
               user, and not accessible by others.

       <u><a href="file:~/.shosts">~/.shosts</a></u>
               This  file  is  used  in  exactly  the  same way as <u>.rhosts</u>, but allows host-based authentication
               without permitting login with rlogin/rsh.

       <u><a href="file:~/.ssh/">~/.ssh/</a></u>
               This directory is the default location for all  user-specific  configuration  and  authentication
               information.   There  is  no  general  requirement  to keep the entire contents of this directory
               secret, but the recommended permissions are read/write/execute for the user, and  not  accessible
               by others.

       <u><a href="file:~/.ssh/authorized_keys">~/.ssh/authorized_keys</a></u>
               Lists  the  public  keys (DSA, ECDSA, Ed25519, RSA) that can be used for logging in as this user.
               The format of this file is described in the  <u><a href="../man8/sshd.8.html">sshd</a></u>(8)  manual  page.   This  file  is  not  highly
               sensitive,  but  the  recommended  permissions are read/write for the user, and not accessible by
               others.

       <u><a href="file:~/.ssh/config">~/.ssh/config</a></u>
               This is the per-user configuration file.  The file format and configuration options are described
               in <u><a href="../man5/ssh_config.5.html">ssh_config</a></u>(5).  Because of the potential for abuse, this file must  have  strict  permissions:
               read/write  for the user, and not writable by others.  It may be group-writable provided that the
               group in question contains only the user.

       <u><a href="file:~/.ssh/environment">~/.ssh/environment</a></u>
               Contains additional definitions for environment variables; see “ENVIRONMENT”, above.

       <u><a href="file:~/.ssh/identity">~/.ssh/identity</a></u>
       <u><a href="file:~/.ssh/id_dsa">~/.ssh/id_dsa</a></u>
       <u><a href="file:~/.ssh/id_ecdsa">~/.ssh/id_ecdsa</a></u>
       <u><a href="file:~/.ssh/id_ed25519">~/.ssh/id_ed25519</a></u>
       <u><a href="file:~/.ssh/id_rsa">~/.ssh/id_rsa</a></u>
               Contains the private key for authentication.  These files contain sensitive data  and  should  be
               readable by the user but not accessible by others (read/write/execute).  <b>ssh</b> will simply ignore a
               private  key  file  if  it  is accessible by others.  It is possible to specify a passphrase when
               generating the key which will be used to encrypt the sensitive part of this file using 3DES.

       <u><a href="file:~/.ssh/identity.pub">~/.ssh/identity.pub</a></u>
       <u><a href="file:~/.ssh/id_dsa.pub">~/.ssh/id_dsa.pub</a></u>
       <u><a href="file:~/.ssh/id_ecdsa.pub">~/.ssh/id_ecdsa.pub</a></u>
       <u><a href="file:~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub">~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub</a></u>
       <u><a href="file:~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub">~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub</a></u>
               Contains the public key for authentication.  These files are not sensitive and can (but need not)
               be readable by anyone.

       <u><a href="file:~/.ssh/known_hosts">~/.ssh/known_hosts</a></u>
               Contains a list of host keys for all hosts the user has logged into that are not already  in  the
               systemwide list of known host keys.  See <u><a href="../man8/sshd.8.html">sshd</a></u>(8) for further details of the format of this file.

       <u><a href="file:~/.ssh/rc">~/.ssh/rc</a></u>
               Commands in this file are executed by <b>ssh</b> when the user logs in, just before the user's shell (or
               command) is started.  See the <u><a href="../man8/sshd.8.html">sshd</a></u>(8) manual page for more information.

       <u>/etc/hosts.equiv</u>
               This file is for host-based authentication (see above).  It should only be writable by root.

       <u>/etc/ssh/shosts.equiv</u>
               This  file  is  used in exactly the same way as <u>hosts.equiv</u>, but allows host-based authentication
               without permitting login with rlogin/rsh.

       <u><a href="file:/etc/ssh/ssh_config">/etc/ssh/ssh_config</a></u>
               Systemwide configuration file.  The file  format  and  configuration  options  are  described  in
               <u><a href="../man5/ssh_config.5.html">ssh_config</a></u>(5).

       <u>/etc/ssh/ssh_host_key</u>
       <u>/etc/ssh/ssh_host_dsa_key</u>
       <u><a href="file:/etc/ssh/ssh_host_ecdsa_key">/etc/ssh/ssh_host_ecdsa_key</a></u>
       <u><a href="file:/etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key">/etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key</a></u>
       <u><a href="file:/etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key">/etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key</a></u>
               These   files  contain  the  private  parts  of  the  host  keys  and  are  used  for  host-based
               authentication.

       <u>/etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts</u>
               Systemwide list of known host keys.  This file should be prepared by the system administrator  to
               contain  the  public host keys of all machines in the organization.  It should be world-readable.
               See <u><a href="../man8/sshd.8.html">sshd</a></u>(8) for further details of the format of this file.

       <u>/etc/ssh/sshrc</u>
               Commands in this file are executed by <b>ssh</b> when the user logs in, just before the user's shell (or
               command) is started.  See the <u><a href="../man8/sshd.8.html">sshd</a></u>(8) manual page for more information.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
