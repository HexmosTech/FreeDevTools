</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       privbind - allow an unprivileged application to bind with reserved ports.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>privbind</b> <b>-u</b> <u>user</u> [ <b>-g</b> <u>group</u>] [ <b>-n</b> <u>num</u>] [ <b>-l</b> <u>path</u>] <u>command</u> [ <u>arguments</u> ... ]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Normally in Linux, only a superuser process can bind an Internet domain socket with a reserved port (port
       numbers less than 1024). Accordingly, server processes are typically run with superuser privileges, which
       can be dropped after binding the reserved port.

       <b>privbind</b> can execute an application as an unprivileged user with just one extra privilege: it can bind to
       reserved ports.

       <b>privbind</b>  is  useful in several situations. It can be used when the application is not trusted enough; It
       can be used when the server is written in a language without the <a href="../man2/setuid.2.html">setuid</a>(2) feature (e.g.,  Java(TM));  It
       can also be used to run applications which don't manipulate their own user id and need to be able to bind
       to a reserved port without needing any other root privileges.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-u</b>     The <b>-u</b> option is mandatory, and specifies under which user to run the given command.  The user can
              be  specified  using  either  a username or a numeric user id.  It should be an unprivileged (non-
              root) user.

       <b>-g</b>     Specifies the group to switch to when running the given command. If this option is  missing,  then
              the given user's default group is used.

       <b>-n</b>     <b>privbind</b>'s  default  behaviour  is to allow the application to call <a href="../man2/bind.2.html">bind</a>(2) with reserved ports an
              unlimited number of times. In order to do that (see "HOW IT WORKS"  below),  the  <b>privbind</b>  helper
              process needs to wait for the application to exit before it terminates.

              The  <b>-n</b> <u>num</u> option tells <b>privbind</b> that it can assume that only <u>num</u> binds need to be given elevated
              privileges.  After this number of <a href="../man2/bind.2.html">bind</a>(2) calls have been executed, <b>privbind</b>'s helper process will
              exit, leaving behind only the unprivileged application running.

       <b>-l</b>     Mostly for internal use during build. Gives the explicit path to the LD_PRELOAD library.

       <b>-h</b>     Shows a short help screen, and exits.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       Using technical jargon, <b>privbind</b> execs <u>command</u> as its main process, running itself in the background  (as
       a  child of the application's process). The practical upshot of this, in layman's terms, is that the user
       never sees <b>privbind</b>'s exit status. When running <b>privbind</b>,  the  process  will  exit  whenever,  and  with
       whatever exit status, <u>command</u> does.

       The above point should be particularly noted when using <b>privbind</b> to run daemons.

</pre><h4><b>SECURITY</b> <b>CONSIDERATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>privbind</b>  has  no  SUID parts, and runs within the confines of a single process.  This serves to minimize
       the security implications of using it. It is strongly advised that <b>privbind</b> <u>not</u> be  made  SUID,  as  this
       would  allow  any  user  that  can  run it to run any process as any other (non-root) user. At the moment
       privbind detects such a situation and warns about it, but will continue with the execution.

</pre><h4><b>HOW</b> <b>IT</b> <b>WORKS</b></h4><pre>
       In a nutshell, <b>privbind</b> works by starting two processes. One drops  privileges  and  runs  (<a href="../man2/exec.2.html">exec</a>(2))  the
       command,  the other remains as root.  <b>Privbind</b> makes sure to keep a unix domain socket connecting the two
       processes.

       <b>Privbind</b> uses LD_PRELOAD to intercept every call to <a href="../man2/bind.2.html">bind</a>(2) made  by  the  program.  Calls  that  can  be
       completed  non-privileged  are  done  so.   Calls  that require root privileges are forwarded to the root
       process, that carry them out on the program's behalf.

       A more detailed explanation is available in the README file.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>privbind</b>  currently  uses  "SOCK_SEQPACKET"  for  communication  between  privileged  and  non-privileged
       processes.  This  socket  type  is only implemented on Linux kernel 2.6.4 and later, which makes privbind
       none portable to older Linux kernels and many other non-Linux platforms.
