</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>uftpproxyd</b>  is  the  proxy daemon of the UFTP suite.  It performs multicast tunneling, NAT traversal, and
       client response aggregation.  It is used in one of two scenarios.  The first is when the server  and  one
       or more clients are on separate networks and cannot be reached directly via multicast, and/or one or both
       sides  are  behind a firewall or NAT'ed.  This allows applications to function when there is little to no
       access to routers.  The second is when the server can contact clients directly but there are too many  of
       them to directly handle the responses.  This allows greater scalability.

       The proxy can run in one of three modes: a server proxy, a client proxy, or response proxy.

       A  server  proxy  is  typically local to a server and acts as the upstream end of a multicast tunnel.  It
       listens on the public multicast address (and private  multicast  address  when  specified)  and  forwards
       downstream  packets  to  a  specific  address  downstream.  Upstream packets are forwarded back where the
       announcement originated from.

       A client proxy is typically local to one or more clients and forms the  downstream  end  of  a  multicast
       tunnel.   It receives unicast data from one or more server proxies and forwards downstream traffic to the
       multicast address specified in the  packet  header.   Upstream  traffic  from  clients  is  gathered  and
       forwarded back where the announcement came from as an aggregated response.

       If  a  client proxy is behind a firewall, the proxy can send a heartbeat message to the upstream proxy to
       make a pinhole in the firewall that the upstream server proxy can connect to.  If  the  client  proxy  is
       also  NATed,  the upstream server proxy may not know the IP/port of the client proxy, so the server proxy
       can be configured to wait for a heartbeat message, and use the IP/port the heartbeat  came  from  as  its
       downstream  address.   If  the  server proxy is also behind a firewall or NAT, a second server proxy on a
       machine with a publicly accessible IP can be inserted between the  first  server  proxy  and  the  client
       proxy.   In  this case, the first server proxy is set up to use the second as its downstream address, and
       the second server proxy is set up to use the first heartbeat it receives  from  a  client  proxy  as  its
       downstream address.

       A  response  proxy functions as a response aggregator in situations where the server has direct multicast
       accessibility to clients but the number of clients are too high for the  server  to  handle  itself.   It
       listens  on  the  public  multicast  address (and private multicast address when specified), but does not
       forward packets from the server since those packets reach clients directly.  It does  however  send  some
       messages  directly  to  clients  in  the  process of establishing encryption keys.  Upstream traffic from
       clients is gathered and forwarded back where the  announcement  came  from  as  an  aggregated  response.
       Clients  in this environment are configured to send all responses to a specific response proxy.  Messages
       sent directly from response proxies to clients use multicast (either the primary public address,  or  the
       private address, depending on the message).

       In  Figure  1 above there are a server and five clients.  The server and one client are on network A, two
       clients are on network B, and two clients are on network C.  There is one client proxy on network  B  and
       one  on  network  C.   On network A are two server proxies, one configured to send to the client proxy on
       network B and the other configured to send to the client proxy on network C.

       Client proxies normally should NOT run on the same machine as a client.   Doing  so  can  result  in  the
       server  getting  confused  when  it  sees  messages coming from a proxy and a client with the same IP and
       therefore cannot tell the difference.  This can only work if the machine has multiple IPs and the  client
       proxy and client listen on different IPs.

       NOTE:  When using proxies in environments where private IP addresses are in use (10.x.x.x, 172.16-31.x.x,
       192.168.x.x), it is strongly recommended to assign a unique ID to each client and client proxy,  and  for
       servers  to call out clients by unique ID instead of name/IP.  This prevents IP address collisions at the
       server between two clients with the same local IP.

       Figure 2 shows a simplified setup involving a server, two clients, and two response proxies, all  on  the
       same  network segment.  In this environment, multicast messages from each proxy reaches both clients, not
       just the client it serves.

       In Figure 3, there are two response proxies local to the server and four clients in two remote  networks,
       with each response proxy handling the clients from one network.  Multicast messages from each proxy would
       reach  all clients, not just the clients it serves.  Even though the proxies are offloading work from the
       server in handling client responses, the server's network still has to handle responses from all  clients
       since the proxies are on the server's network.  As a result, this setup has limited scalability.

       In  Figure  4,  each proxy is at least one hop away from the clients it serves, and at least one hop away
       from the server.  In this case, multicast messages from each proxy only go  to  the  clients  it  serves.
       Also,  since the proxies are not on the same network as the server, messages coming from the client don't
       have any effect on the server's local network.  A setup like this is the most scalabile, and is the  most
       flexible since another server on a different network can utilize the response proxies in the same way.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The following options are supported:

       <b>-s</b> { <u>dest</u> | <b>fp=</b><u>fingerprint</u> }
              Sets  up the proxy as a server proxy.  If dest is specified, this is the name/IP of the downstream
              client proxy.  If fingerprint is specified, this  designates  the  public  key  signature  of  the
              downstream  proxy.  When this proxy gets a heartbeat message signed with the matching key, it will
              use the source IP:port of the heartbeat for its downstream address.  Exactly one of <b>-s</b>, <b>-c</b>, or  -r
              must be specified.

       <b>-c</b>     Sets up the proxy as a client proxy.  Exactly one of <b>-s</b>, <b>-c</b>, or -r must be specified.

       <b>-r</b>[<b>:</b><u>curve</u>]
              Sets  up  the  proxy  as a response proxy.  If "<u>curve</u>" is given, specifies the EC curve to use for
              ECDH key exchange (see <b>-k</b> and <b>-K</b> for details), otherwise no ECDH key is generated.  Exactly one of
              <b>-s</b>, <b>-c</b>, or <b>-r</b> must be specified.

       <b>-d</b>     Enable debug mode.  The process will run in the foreground and all output will go to  stderr.   If
              specified, the <b>-L</b> option is ignored.

       <b>-p</b> <u>port</u>
              The UDP port number to listen on.  Default is <b>1044</b>.

       <b>-t</b> <u>ttl</u> Specifies the time-to-live for multicast packets.  Default is <b>1</b>.

       <b>-N</b> <u>priority</u>
              Sets  the  process priority.  On Windows systems, valid values are from <b>-2</b> to <b>2</b>, with a default of
              <b>0</b>.  These correspond to the following priorities:

              -2 High
              -1 Above Normal
               0 Normal
               1 Below Normal
               2 Low

              On all other systems, this is the "nice" value.  Valid values are from <b>-20</b> to <b>19</b>p where <b>-20</b> is the
              highest priority and 19 is the lowest priority.  Default is <b>0</b>.

       <b>-O</b> <u>out_multi_interface</u>
              The interface to send the data from.  Can be specified either by interface name, by  hostname,  or
              by IP.  If not specified, the default system interface is used.  Applies only to client proxies.

       <b>-U</b> <u>UID</u> The  unique  ID  for  this  proxy,  specified  as an 8 digit hexadecimal number (0xnnnnnnnn).  The
              default value is based on the IP address of the first listed multicast capable  interface  on  the
              system.   If  this  address is IPv4, the UID is the address.  If it is IPv6, the UID is the last 4
              bytes of the address.

       <b>-q</b> <u>dest_port</u>
              The port number of the downstream proxy (for server proxies) or clients (for client proxies).

       <b>-m</b>     For Windows systems using CryptoAPI or CNG, private keys are normally stored in the key  container
              of the running user.  Specifying this option stores keys in the system key container.  Useful when
              running as a service.  On non-Windows systems, this option has no effect.

       <b>-x</b> <u>log_level</u>
              Specifies current logging level.  Valid values are 0-5, with <b>0</b> being the least verbose and <b>5</b> being
              the most verbose.  Default is <b>2</b>, which is consistent with logging prior to version 3.5.

       <b>-H</b> <u>hb_server</u>[<b>:</b><u>port</u>][<b>,</b><u>hb_server</u>[<b>:</b><u>port</u>]...]
              Lists one or more proxies to send heartbeat messages to.  When sending a signed heartbeat message,
              the  first  key listed under <b>-k</b> is used to sign the message.  If port is not specified for a given
              proxy, the default port of <b>1044</b> is assumed.

       <b>-h</b> <u>hb_interval</u>
              The time in seconds between sending heartbeat messages.  Ignored if <b>-H</b> is not specified.

       <b>-g</b> <u>max_log_size</u>
              Specifies the maximum log file size in MB.  Once the log file  reaches  this  size,  the  file  is
              renamed  with  a  .1  extension  and  a  new  log file is opened.  For example, if the log file is
              <u>/tmp/uftpproxyd.log</u>, it will be renamed <u>/tmp/uftpproxyd.log.1</u> and a new  <u>/tmp/uftpproxyd.log</u>  will
              be created.  Ignored if <b>-d</b> is specified.  Valid values are 1-1024.  Default is no log rolling.

       <b>-n</b> <u>max_log_count</u>
              Specifies  the  maximum  number of archive log files to keep when log rolling is active.  When the
              log file rolls, archive logs are renamed with an incrementing numerical extension until the max is
              reached.  Archive log files beyond the maximum are deleted.   Ignored  if  <b>-g</b>  is  not  specified.
              Valid values are 1-1000.  Default is <b>5</b>.

       <b>-B</b> <u>buf_size</u>
              The  size  in  bytes  of  the  UDP  send  buffer  and  receive  buffer  to  use.  Valid values are
              65536-104857600 (64KB-100MB).  Defaults to <b>262144</b>.

       <b>-L</b> <u>logfile</u>
              Specifies  the  log  file.   Default  is  <u>/tmp/uftpproxyd.log</u>  for  UNIX-like   systems   systems,
              <u>C:\uftpproxyd_log.txt</u> for Windows.

       <b>-Q</b> <u>dscp</u>
              Specifies the Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP), formerly Type of Service (TOS), in the IP
              header  for all outgoing packets.  Valid values are 0-63 and may be specified in either decimal or
              hexadecimal.  Default is <b>0</b>.

              On Windows XP systems, the OS doesn't allow this parameter to be changed by  default.   To  change
              this, add/modify the following DWORD registry value, set to 0, and reboot:

              HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters\DisableUserTOSSetting

              Not currently supported on Windows Vista or later.

       <b>-P</b> <u>pidfile</u>
              The pidfile to write the daemon's pid to on startup.  Default is no pidfile.

       <b>-C</b> <u>clientlist_file</u>
              A  file  containing a list of clients the proxy will allow to receive files from.  The file should
              contain the name/IP of a client followed by the client's public key fingerprint, with one on  each
              line.   The  key  specified  by  the  client  must  match the fingerprint.  Applies only to client
              proxies.

              Example contents:
              0x00001111|66:1E:C9:1D:FC:99:DB:60:B0:1A:F0:8F:CA:F4:28:27:A6:BE:94:BC
              0x00002222

       <b>-S</b> <u>serverlist_file</u>
              A file containing a list of servers.  The file should contain the ID of the server, the IP address
              the proxy expects the server's request to come  from,  and  optionally  the  server's  public  key
              fingerprint,  with  one  entry for a server on each line.  For client proxies, this is the list of
              servers the proxy will allow to connect, and the key  specified  by  the  server  must  match  the
              fingerprint.   For  server  proxies,  if your system supports source specific multicast (SSM), the
              proxy will subscribe to all public and private multicast  addresses  using  SSM  for  all  servers
              listed.  Response proxies perform both of the above functions

              When  this  option  is specified, the public and private addresses specified by the server must be
              valid SSM addresses.  Any ANNOUNCE that specifies a private IP that is not  a  valid  SSM  address
              will be rejected.  Valid SSM addresses are in the <u>232/8</u> range for IPv4 and the <u>ff30::/96</u> range for
              IPv6.

              Example contents:
              0x11112222|192.168.1.101|66:1E:C9:1D:FC:99:DB:60:B0:1A:F0:8F:CA:F4:28:27:A6:BE:94:BC
              0x11113333|fe80::213:72ff:fed6:69ca

       <b>-k</b> <u>keyfile</u>[<b>,</b><u>keyfile</u>...]

       <b>-K</b> "{ <b>rsa:</b><u>key_len</u> | <b>ec:</b><u>curve</u> }[<b>,</b>...]"
              These two options are used to read and/or write the proxy's RSA/ECDSA private keys.

              The  -K  option  creates  one or more RSA or ECDSA private keys.  New keys are specified as either
              <b>rsa:</b><u>key_length</u>, which creates an RSA private key <u>key_length</u>  bits  wide,  or  as  <b>ec:</b><u>curve</u>,  which
              creates an EC key using the curve "<u>curve</u>".

              The  list of supported EC curves is as follows (availability may vary depending on system settings
              and crypto library used):

              sect163k1  sect163r1  sect163r2  sect193r1  sect193r2  sect233k1  sect233r1  sect239k1   sect283k1
              sect283r1   sect409k1  sect409r1  sect571k1  sect571r1  secp160k1  secp160r1  secp160r2  secp192k1
              prime192v1 secp224k1 secp224r1 secp256k1 prime256v1 secp384r1 secp521r1

              If only <b>-K</b> is specified, the keys created are not persisted.

              If only <b>-k</b> is specified, this option reads RSA or ECDSA private keys from each keyfile.

              If <b>-k</b> and <b>-K</b> are specified, the keys created by <b>-K</b> are written to the keyfiles listed by  <b>-k</b>.   In
              this case, <b>-k</b> and <b>-K</b> must give the same number of items.

              If  neither  <b>-k</b>  nor <b>-K</b> are specified, an RSA private key 512 bytes in length is generated and not
              persisted.

              If <b>-k</b> is specified but not <b>-K</b>, the RSA or ECDSA private keys are read from each keyfile.

              The definition of keyfile is dependent on the crypto library UFTP is compiled to use.

              On Windows systems, UFTP can built to use either CNG, which is the new API  supported  by  Windows
              Vista  and  Windows 7, or CryptoAPI, which is the legacy API and the only one available to Windows
              XP.

              Under CryptoAPI, all RSA private keys must be stored in a key  container  (technically  only  keys
              used  to  sign  data,  but  for UFTP's purposes this is the case).  Key containers are internal to
              Windows, and each user (and the system) has its own set of key containers.  In this case, key_file
              is actually the name of the key container.  When <b>-k</b> is not specified, the  generated  key  is  not
              persisted. Elliptic Curve algorithms are not supported under CryptoAPI.

              Under  CNG,  RSA and ECDSA private keys are also stored in key containers, and RSA keys created by
              CrypoAPI may be read by CNG.  Like CryptoAPI, key_file also specifies the key container name,  and
              the  generated  key is not persisted if <b>-k</b> is not specified.  CNG only supports 3 named EC curves:
              <b>prime256v1</b>, <b>secp384r1</b>, and <b>secp521r1</b>.

              All other systems use OpenSSL for the crypto library (although under Windows UFTP can be  also  be
              built  to  use  it).   In  this  case, key_file specifies a file name where the RSA private key is
              stored unencrypted in PEM format (the OS is expected to protect this file).  When both <b>-k</b>  and  <b>-K</b>
              are  specified,  the  file  is  only  written to if it does not currently exist.  If the file does
              exist, an error message will be returned and the server will exit.  When <b>-k</b> is not specified,  the
              generated  key  is  not  persisted.   These  PEM  files may also be manipulated via the <a href="../man1/openssl.1.html">openssl</a>(1)
              command line tool.

              Keys can also be generated and viewed via the <b><a href="../man1/uftp_keymgt.1.html">uftp_keymgt</a></b>(1) utility.

       <b>-e</b> <u>ecdh_curve</u>
              Specifies the EC curve type to use for a response proxy's ECDH private key.  This option  MUST  be
              specified  for  a  response proxy to use an ECDH key exchange scheme.  If unspecified, no ECDH key
              will be created.  Ignored if <b>-r</b> is not specified.

       <b>-I</b> <u>interface</u>[<b>,</b><u>interface</u>...]
              For server proxies, lists one or more interfaces to listen to multicast traffic  on.   For  client
              proxies,  the  interface it reports itself as to servers and clients.  Interfaces can be specified
              either by interface name, by hostname, or  by  IP.   When  receiving  a  closed  group  membership
              request,  the  client  proxy  will  participate  if  any  of these interfaces matches an IP in the
              announcement.  The default is to listen  on  all  active  non-loopback  interfaces.   NOTE:  Since
              Windows doesn't have named interfaces (not in the sense that UNIX-like systems do), only hostnames
              or IP addresses are accepted on Windows.

       <b>-M</b> <u>pub_mcast_addr</u>[<b>,</b><u>pub_mcast_addr</u>...]
              The  list  of  public  multicast addresses to listen on.  Used only by server proxies and response
              proxies.  Default is <b>230.4.4.1</b>.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       The following exit values are returned:

       0      The proxy started successfully and is running in the background.

       1      An invalid command line parameter was specified.

       2      An error occurred while attempting to initialize network connections.

       3      An error occurred while reading or generating cryptographic key data.

       4      An error occurred while opening or rolling the log file.

       5      A memory allocation error occurred.

       6      The proxy was interrupted by the user.
