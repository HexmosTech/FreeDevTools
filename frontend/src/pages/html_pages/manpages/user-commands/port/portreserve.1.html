</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       portreserve - reserve ports to prevent portmap mapping them

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>

       <b>portreserve</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>portreserve</b> program aims to help services with well-known ports that lie in the <b>bindresvport</b> range.
       It prevents portmap (or other programs using <b>bindresvport</b>) from occupying a real service's port by
       occupying it itself, until the real service tells it to release the port (generally in its init script).

       It is intended that <b>portreserve</b> runs from an initscript of its own, and services wishing to interact with
       it should use <b>portrelease</b>.

       When the <b>portreserve</b> daemon is started, it examines the /etc/portreserve/ directory. Each file not
       containing “.”  or “~” in its name is considered to be a service configuration file, and must contain a
       service name (as listed in <a href="file:/etc/services">/etc/services</a>) or a port number. UDP services may be specified by appending
       "/udp" to the service name, and TCP services by "/tcp". Several services may be specified, one per line.

       For example, /etc/portreserve/cups might contain the string “ipp” or, equivalently, “ipp/tcp” and
       “ipp/udp” on separate lines.

       For each service configuration file, a socket is created and bound to the appropriate port. A service
       wishing to bind to its port must first run <b>portrelease</b>, which instructs <b>portreserve</b> to release the port
       associated with the service.

       Once all the reserved ports have been released, the daemon exits.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       /etc/portreserve/*
           Service configuration files

       /var/run/portreserve/socket
           communication socket for <b>portrelease</b>
