</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       BootTerm - simple terminal to ease connections with SBCs

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>bt</b> [<u>options</u>] [<u>/dev/ttyXXX</u> <u>|</u> <u>port#</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       BootTerm  is  a  simple,  reliable  and powerful terminal designed to ease connection to ephemeral serial
       ports as found on various SBCs, and typically USB-based ones.

       •  automatic port detection (uses the most recently registered one by default)
       •  enumeration of available ports with detected drivers and descriptions
       •  wait for a specific, a new, or any port to appear (convenient with USB ports)
       •  support for non-standard baud rates (e.g. 74880 bauds for ESP8266)
       •  can send a Break sequence and toggling RTS/DTR for various reset sequences, even on startup
       •  fixed/timed captures to files (may be enabled at run time)
       •  optionally time-stamped captures (relative/absolute dates)
       •  reliable with proper error handling
       •  single binary without annoying dependencies, builds out of the box
       •  supports stdin/stdout to inject/download data
       •  configurable escape character and visible character ranges

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>

       Ports are sorted in reverse registration order so that port 0 is the most recently added  one.  A  number
       may  be  set  instead  of the port. With no name nor number, last port is used. Use '?' or 'help' in baud
       rate to list them all.  Comma-delimited lists of ports  to  exclude/include/restrict  may  be  passed  in
       BT_SCAN_EXCLUDE_PORTS,   BT_SCAN_INCLUDE_PORTS,   and   BT_SCAN_RESTRICT_PORTS.   BT_SCAN_EXCLUDE_DRIVERS
       ignores ports matching these drivers.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Most</b> <b>common</b> <b>usage</b>
       By default, bt connects to the last registered serial port, which usually is the most recently  connected
       USB adapter. A list of currently available ports is obtained by bt -l:

       $ bt -l
        port |  age (sec) | device     | driver           | description
       ------+------------+------------+------------------+----------------------
           0 |     524847 | ttyAMA0    | uart-pl011       |
           1 |     524847 | ttyUSB0    | ftdi_sio         | TTL232R-3V3
           2 |       1320 | ttyUSB1    | ch341-uart       |
        *  3 |        206 | ttyUSB2    | cp210x           | CP2102 USB to UART Bridge Controller

       In the example above, ttyUSB2 will be used when no option is specified (which is indicated by the star in
       front  of  the  port number). Otherwise, running bt ttyUSB2, bt /dev/ttyS0, or anything else will also do
       what is expected. The help is shown with bt -h.

       Once connected, the default escape character is the same as telnet:  Ctrl-]  (Control  and  right-square-
       bracket).  After  the  escape  character,  a  single  character is expected to issue an internal command.
       Quitting is achieved by pressing q (either upper or lower case) or . (dot) after  the  escape  character.
       Sending  the escape character itself is possible by issuing it again. If the command that must follow the
       escape character doesn’t arrive within two seconds, the escape character is  ignored,  and  the  terminal
       will  emit  a  visible flash when supported, to indicate the user that the escape sequence was aborted. A
       help page is available with h or ?:

       $ bt
       No port specified, using ttyUSB0 (last registered). Use -l to list ports.
       Trying port ttyUSB0... Connected to ttyUSB0 at 115200 bps.
       Escape character is 'Ctrl-]'. Use escape followed by '?' for help.

       BootTerm supports several single-character commands after the escape character:
         H h ?      display this help
         Q q .      quit
         P p        show port status
         D d        flip DTR pin
         R r        flip RTS pin
         F f        flip both DTR and RTS pins
         B b        send break
         C c        enable / disable capture
         T t        enable / disable timestamps on terminal
       Enter the escape character again after this menu to use these commands.

   <b>Waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>serial</b> <b>port</b>
       Most often you don’t want to know what name your serial port will have, you just want to connect  to  the
       one  you’re about to plug, as soon as it’s available, in order to grasp most of the boot sequence. That’s
       what bt -n is made for. It will check the list of current ports and  will  wait  for  a  new  one  to  be
       inserted.  It  even works if one port is unplugged and replugged. This is very convenient to avoid having
       to follow cables on a desk, or when connecting to a device that gets both the power and the console  from
       the  same  USB  connector.  It’s worth noting that this wait feature is ignored when -l is used to get an
       instant list of detected ports.

       The automatic port detection is more precise on Linux and FreeBSD where  a  detailed  list  of  available
       ports  with  their  respective  drivers  and  descriptions are available. On other operating systems, the
       automatic detection falls back to a scan of node in <a href="file:/dev">/dev</a>, avoiding known unrelated ones, and focusing  on
       specific ones for certain operating systems (e.g. macOS uses cu.*).

       Example below booting a Breadbee board with an integrated CH340E adapter after bt -n:

       $ bt -n
       3 ports found, waiting for a new one...
        port |  age (sec) | device     | driver           | description
       ------+------------+------------+------------------+----------------------
           3 |          0 | ttyUSB1    | ch341-uart       |

       Trying port ttyUSB1... Connected to ttyUSB1 at 115200 bps.
       Escape character is 'Ctrl-]'. Use escape followed by '?' for help.
       !

       U-Boot 2019.07-00068-g18b9e73630-dirty (May 30 2020 - 13:37:48 +0900)

       DRAM:  64 MiB

       One  particularly appreciable case is when connecting to an emulated port, such as below on a NanoPI NEO2
       running Armbian:

       $ bt -n
       2 ports found, waiting for a new one...
        port |  age (sec) | device     | driver           | description
       ------+------------+------------+------------------+----------------------
           2 |          0 | ttyACM0    | cdc_acm          | CDC Abstract Control Model (ACM)

       This port selection mode can  be  automatically  enabled  by  setting  the  BT_SCAN_WAIT_NEW  environment
       variable to any value:

       $ export BT_SCAN_WAIT_NEW=1
       $ bt
       3 ports found, waiting for a new one...

   <b>Waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>any</b> <b>port</b>
       A  different  approach consists in waiting for either a specific port or any port. By default, issuing bt
       ttyUSB0 will fail if this terminal doesn’t exist yet. But with bt -a ttyUSB0, BootTerm will wait for  the
       device  to appear. Just like with -n, this wait feature is ignored when -l is used to get an instant list
       of detected ports.

       With no device name specified, it will wait for any usable device and use the most recent  one.  If  some
       ports  are  already  on board and must never be used, they can be excluded using the environment variable
       BT_SCAN_EXCLUDE_PORTS, which is a comma-delimited list of device names, possibly ending with *:

       $ export BT_SCAN_EXCLUDE_PORTS=ttyS0,ttyS1
       $ bt -a
       Waiting for one port to appear...
       Port ttyUSB0 available, using it.
        port |  age (sec) | device     | driver           | description
       ------+------------+------------+------------------+----------------------
           0 |          0 | ttyUSB0    | ch341-uart       |

       Trying port ttyUSB0... Connected to ttyUSB0 at 115200 bps.
       Escape character is 'Ctrl-]'. Use escape followed by '?' for help.

       It is also possible to enable this port selection mode by default using BT_SCAN_WAIT_ANY:

       $ export BT_SCAN_EXCLUDE_PORTS=ttyS*
       $ export BT_SCAN_WAIT_ANY=1
       $ bt
       Waiting for one port to appear...

       It is probably what most laptop users will want to do so as never  to  have  to  pass  any  argument  and
       automatically connect to a USB serial port.

       One  may  also  exclude  some drivers from the scan using BT_SCAN_EXCLUDE_DRIVERS, which can sometimes be
       more convenient to ignore some known uninteresting internal devices:

       $ bt -l
        port |  age (sec) | device     | driver           | description
       ------+------------+------------+------------------+----------------------
           0 |      12562 | ttyACM0    | cdc_acm          | Fibocom L830-EB
           1 |         99 | ttyS0      | serial           |
        *  2 |         21 | ttyUSB0    | cp210x           | CP2102 USB to UART Bridge Controller

       $ BT_SCAN_EXCLUDE_DRIVERS=serial,cdc_acm bt -l
        port |  age (sec) | device     | driver           | description
       ------+------------+------------+------------------+----------------------
        *  0 |         24 | ttyUSB0    | cp210x           | CP2102 USB to UART Bridge Controller

       Alternately, it is possible to restrict the port enumeration to only a specific set by  listing  them  in
       BT_SCAN_RESTRICT_PORTS. This can be more convenient when you know that your port is always called ttyACM0
       or  any  such  thing  for  example.  Similarly these ports can end with * to validate any suffix, such as
       ttyACM*.

   <b>Changing</b> <b>the</b> <b>baud</b> <b>rate</b>
       On opening, the port’s baud rate is automatically changed to the value  specified  with  -b,  or  in  the
       BT_PORT_BAUD_RATE  variable,  or  by  default  to  115200  if neither is set. However if the baud rate is
       explicitly set to 0 (either using -b or using the variable) then the  baud  rate  is  unchanged.  Example
       below with a NodeMCU module:

       $ bt -b 74880
       Port ttyUSB2 available, using it.
        port |  age (sec) | device     | driver           | description
       ------+------------+------------+------------------+----------------------
           2 |     524342 | ttyUSB2    | cp210x           | CP2102 USB to UART Bridge Controller

       Trying port ttyUSB2... Connected to ttyUSB2 at 76800 bps.
       Escape character is 'Ctrl-]'. Use escape followed by '?' for help.

       It  is  interesting to note above that the hardware does not support 74880 bauds and selected its closest
       support speed (76800). This is a 2.5% error, it will not cause any trouble.

   <b>Using</b> <b>BootTerm</b> <b>to</b> <b>detect</b> <b>ports</b>
       BootTerm supports a “print” mode. In this mode it will simply print the device name without  the  leading
       <a href="file:/dev/.">/dev/.</a>  It  can  be  convenient  as an assistant to other flashing tools to wait for a port and print its
       name. By default the newly detected port is reported however, and it is wise to switch to quiet  mode  to
       avoid intermediary information:

       $ bt -np
       4 ports found, waiting for a new one...
       ttyUSB2

       $ bt -npq
       ttyUSB2

       Thus  a script that needs to connect to the port as early as possible to reprogram a board could be doing
       something like this to wait for the device to show up:

       PORT=$(bt -npq)
       if [ -n "$PORT" ]; then
          flash -p "$PORT" -i "$IMAGE"
       fi

   <b>Issuing</b> <b>special</b> <b>sequences</b>
       The current port status (name, speed, pins) is reported when pressing p after the  escape  sequence.  Pin
       names  in  lower cases are in the low state, those in upper case are in the high state. When pin toggling
       is required, it is wise to check the real pin’s polarity, as most circuits invert it multiple times along
       the chain. The reported status here is the one seen by the serial port driver.

       A break sequence can be used to trigger the SysRq feature in Linux, or to reboot some boards.  The  break
       happens  by  pressing b after the escape key. E.g. Ctrl-] b. It is also possible to send a break sequence
       just before starting the terminal by passing -B on the command line. Combined with -N, it may be used  to
       simply program a reset from a script (e.g. bt -aqNB).

       The  DTR  pin  can be toggled by pressing D after the escape character, and the RTS pin can be toggled by
       pressing R. Both pins can be toggled together (for example to reset  an  ESP8266  in  flashing  mode)  by
       pressing F.

   <b>Capturing</b> <b>responses</b>
       There  are two ways of capturing responses. If no terminal is needed, simply redirecting bt’s output to a
       file will work:

       $ bt /dev/ttyS0 &gt; server-panic.log

       If a terminal is needed and a capture of the session is desired, there is a special capture function.  It
       supports  three  modes,  which  are  enabled  either  by -c on the command line, otherwise by environment
       variable BT_CAPTURE_MODE:

       •  none : capture is disabled, this is the default
       •  fixed: a file name is fixed on start of the capture and will not change
       •  timed: the file name is re-evaluated each second and if it changes, the previous file is closed and  a
          new one is opened.

       In  all  cases,  the  files are only appended to and never truncated, so that BootTerm will never destroy
       previous traces. If a fresh file is needed, just remove the file before starting BootTerm.

       The fixed mode usually is the one that users will want to capture a session when dumping a boot  loader’s
       configuration  or  the  kernel’s  boot  messages.  The timed mode can be useful when connecting to a port
       waiting for rare or periodic events in order to get a dated file. The file name is defined by the  format
       passed  to  -f,  which defaults to the current date and time. It uses strftime() so please check this man
       page to get all format options supported on your system.

       Thus when exploring a new device, one would likely use:

       $ bt -c fixed

       And when collecting event logs from a server with one file per day:

       $ bt -c timed -f "server-%Y%m%d.log"

   <b>Timestamps</b> <b>in</b> <b>captures</b>
       Timestamps  may  be  enabled  in  captures,  according  to  the  -t  command  line   argument,   or   the
       BT_TIMESTAMP_MODE, which may contain one of the following values:

       •  none: no timestamp is added, lines are dumped exactly as received, this is the default
       •  abs  :  the  date  and  time  of  the  first  character  at  the  beginning of a line are dumped using
          year,month,day,hour,minute,second,micro enclosed in square brackets at  the  beginning  of  the  line,
          followed by a space, such as [20201219-192208.888633].
       •  init: the time of the first character of each line, relative to the start of the program is printed at
          the  beginning of each line using seconds and microseconds inside square brackets followed by a space,
          such as [     3.557564]. The seconds are padded on 6 characters, which  are  enough  for  11  days  of
          capture. Above this the field’s width will increase.
       •  line:  the  time  of  the  first  character of each line, relative to the date of the previous line is
          printed at the beginning of each line using seconds and microseconds inside square  brackets  followed
          by  a  space, such as [     1.273017]. The seconds are padded on 6 characters, which are enough for 11
          days of pause between two lines. Above this the field’s width will increase.

       Example of capture with line-relative timestamps, showing a kernel decompression  time  of  1.27  second:
       <b>capture</b> (Image: <u>doc/kernel-boot.png</u>)

       In  addition, timestamps may also be temporarily enabled on the terminal by pressing ‘T’ after the escape
       character. The timestamp mode configured above will be used, except  if  not  set,  in  which   case  the
       absolute  mode  will  be  used.  It is important to understand that timestamps on a terminal will quickly
       cause trouble on the output since the terminal and the application  are  seeing  different  contents  and
       positions.  It  can be convenient to observe boot times for example, but should be disabled when starting
       any interactive application (e.g. an editor).

       Please note that there is a subtle difference between terminal  timestamp  and  file-based  captures.  In
       file-based  captures,  the  time  is  taken  when  the first character is printed after a line feed. This
       provides the most accurate timing between two consecutive lines because it will take the processing  time
       into  account.  However on the terminal it cannot be done exactly this way without rendering the terminal
       very painful to use, because on a typical prompt, the leading timestamp would be missing until  the  user
       presses  a  character  that would suddenly cause the timestamp to be printed before it is echoed. Thus on
       the terminal, the timestamp is calculated when the cursor goes to the beginning of a  new  line,  and  is
       (re-)printed  every  time  the cursor goes to the beginning of the line. This means that on the terminal,
       the processing time, if any, will usually be accounted as part of the time needed to print the next line.

   <b>Changing</b> <b>the</b> <b>escape</b> <b>character</b>
       The escape character may be specified either as  a  single  character  after  -e  or  as  an  integer  or
       hexadecimal value representing the ASCII code of this character.

       Users  coming  from the venerable screen utility will probably want to set the escape character to Ctrl-A
       (unless of course they want to  call  screen  from  within  these  sessions,  or  are  irritated  by  the
       confiscation of this common sequence):

       $ bt -e1

       Those coming from tmux would rather use Ctrl-B:

       $ bt -e2

       Here are a few other convenient and less common escape characters:
       ┌─────────────────────────┬───────────────────────────────────┬────────────────────────┐

   <b>Masking</b> <b>problematic</b> <b>characters</b>
       Running at wrong speeds or connecting during a boot sequence often results in some garbage to be received
       on  a  terminal. And different terminal emulators handle these differently. For example, Xterm supports a
       very large variety of codes in the C1 range (0x80-0x9F) among which CSI (0x9B) which is  an  escape  with
       the  high  bit  set.  The  problem is that the prefix range is large and that many of them will result in
       reconfiguring it or hanging it until a sequence ends. This is often translated into unreadble fonts,  the
       terminal definitely freezing, or arrow keys making the cursor move on the screen instead of being sent to
       the  remote  terminal.  Other  terminals  have  their own problems with 0x00, 0xFF or can be at risk with
       improper handling of ANSI codes prefixed with 0x1B.

       In order to address this, BootTerm can block dangerous characters and print them encoded instead. It will
       always block raw and UTF-8 encoded C1 codes (0x80-0x9F with or without the 0xC2  prefix),  as  these  are
       always terminal configuration codes which should never be sent to the terminal emulator. In addition it’s
       possible to restrict the range of printable characters using -m and -M.

   <b>Remapping</b> <b>CR</b> <b>to</b> <b>CRLF</b> <b>or</b> <b>LF</b> <b>to</b> <b>CRLF</b>
       In  raw  mode,  terminals  emit CR and LF separately and expect them both to be received. This is true as
       well for the user terminal. If the device being connected to works in raw mode but does not  emit  CR  or
       does  not  emit  LF,  then the user terminal will quickly be confusing and painful to use. An environment
       variable, BT_PORT_CRLF may be used to force a remapping of input characters to the expected CRLF pair:
       ┌─────────────────────┬─────────────────────────────────────┬────────────────────────────────────┐
       │ <b>BT_PORT_CRLF</b>        │       <b>Behavior</b>                      │       <b>Use</b> <b>case</b>                     │
       ├─────────────────────┼─────────────────────────────────────┼────────────────────────────────────┤
       │ 0                   │       no remapping                  │       all the time                 │
       ├─────────────────────┼─────────────────────────────────────┼────────────────────────────────────┤
       │ 1                   │       LF is replaced by CRLF        │       when lines look like stairs  │
       ├─────────────────────┼─────────────────────────────────────┼────────────────────────────────────┤
       │ 2                   │       CR is replaced by CRLF        │       when the  same  line  always │
       │                     │                                     │       gets overwritten             │
       └─────────────────────┴─────────────────────────────────────┴────────────────────────────────────┘

       Note  that  in  order  to  make  this  compatible with captures and terminal timestamps, the remapping is
       performed inside the port buffer before the captures, and as such the fixed CRLF sequence will appear  in
       the captures.

       Most users will never need to change this setting.
