</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       DjVu - DjVu and DjVuLibre.

</pre><h4><b>INTRODUCTION</b></h4><pre>
       Although  the  Internet  has given us a worldwide infrastructure on which to build the universal library,
       much of the world knowledge, history, and literature is still trapped on paper in the  basements  of  the
       world's  traditional  libraries. Many libraries and content owners are in the process of digitizing their
       collections.  While many such efforts involve the painstaking process of converting  paper  documents  to
       computer-friendly  form,  such  as  SGML  based  formats,  the high cost of such conversions limits their
       extent. Scanning documents, and distributing the resulting images electronically is not only considerably
       cheaper, but also more faithful to the original document because it preserves its visual aspect.

       Despite the quickly improving speed of network connections and computers, the number of scanned  document
       images accessible on the Web today is relatively small. There are several reasons for this.

       The  first  reason  is the relatively high cost of scanning anything else but unbound sheets in black and
       white. This problem is slowly going away with the appearance of fast and  low-cost  color  scanners  with
       sheet feeders.

       The  second  reason  is  that  long-established  image compression standards and file formats have proved
       inadequate for distributing scanned documents at high resolution, particularly color documents.  Not only
       are the file sizes and download times impractical, the decoding and rendering times are also prohibitive.
       A typical magazine page scanned in color at 100 dpi in JPEG would typically occupy 100 KB to 200 KB , but
       the text would be hardly readable: insufficient for screen viewing and totally unacceptable for printing.
       The same page at 300 dpi would have sufficient quality for viewing and printing, but the file size  would
       be  300  KB  to  1000 KB at best, which is impractical for remote access. Another major problem is that a
       fully decoded 300 dpi color images of a letter-size page occupies 24 MB of memory and easily causes  disk
       swapping.

       The  third  reason  is  that digital documents are more than just a collection of individual page images.
       Pages in a scanned documents have a natural serial order. Special provision must be made to  ensure  that
       flipping  pages  be  instantaneous  and  effortless  so  as to maintain a good user experience. Even more
       important, most existing document formats force users  to  download  the  entire  document  first  before
       displaying  a chosen page.  However, users often want to jump to individual pages of the document without
       waiting for the entire document to download.  Efficient browsing requires efficient random  page  access,
       fast  sequential  page flipping, and quick rendering. This can be achieved with a combination of advanced
       compression, pre-fetching, pre-decoding, caching, and progressive rendering. DjVu  decomposes  each  page
       into  multiple  components (text, backgrounds, images, libraries of common shapes...)  that may be shared
       by several pages and downloaded on demand.  All these requirements call  for  a  very  sophisticated  but
       parsimonious  control  mechanism  to  handle  on-demand downloading, pre-fetching, decoding, caching, and
       progressive rendering of the page images.  What is being considered here is not  just  a  document  image
       compression technique, but a whole platform for document delivery.

       DjVu  is  an  image  compression  technique,  a  document  format, and a software platform for delivering
       documents images over the Internet that fulfills the above requirements.

</pre><h4><b>DJVU</b> <b>IMAGE</b> <b>COMPRESSION</b></h4><pre>
       The DjVu image compression is based on three technologies:

   <b>DjVuPhoto</b>
       DjVuPhoto, also known as IW44, is  a  wavelet-based  continuous-tone  image  compression  technique  with
       progressive  decoding/rendering.  It is best used for encoding photographic images in colors or in shades
       of gray.  Images are typically half the size as JPEG for the same distortion.

   <b>DjVuBitonal</b>
       DjVuBitonal, also known as JB2, is a bitonal image compression that takes  advantage  of  repetitions  of
       nearly identical shapes on the page (such as characters) to efficiently compress text images.  It is best
       used to compress black and white images representing text and simple drawings.  A typical 300 dpi page in
       DjVuBitonal occupies 5 to 25 KB (3 to 8 times better than TIFF-G4 or PDF ).

   <b>DjVuDocument</b>
       DjVuDocument  is  a  compression  technique  specifically  designed  for  color  digital documents images
       containing both pictures and text, such as a page of a magazine.   DjVuDocument  represents  images  into
       separately  compressed layers.  The foreground layer is usually compressed with DjVu Bitonal and contains
       the text and drawings.  The background layer is  usually  compressed  with  DjVuPhoto  and  contains  the
       background texture and the pictures at lower resolution.

</pre><h4><b>DJVU</b> <b>DOCUMENT</b> <b>DELIVERY</b> <b>PLATFORM</b></h4><pre>
       The DjVu technology is designed from the ground up to support the efficient delivery of digital documents
       over  the  Internet.   It  provides  various  ways to deal with multi-page documents, and various ways to
       enrich the content with hyper-links, meta-data, searchable text, etc.

   <b>MIME</b> <b>types</b>
       The DjVu format has an official MIME type of <b>image/vnd.djvu</b>, which is the preferred  content-type  to  be
       given  by  http  servers  for  DjVu  files.  Unofficial mime types used historically are <b>image/x.djvu</b> and
       <b>image/x-djvu</b>, which may still be encountered.  Ideally, clients should be configured to handle all three.

   <b>Bundled</b> <b>multi-page</b> <b>documents</b>
       Bundled multi-page DjVu document uses a single file to represent the entire document.  This  single  file
       contains  all the pages as well as ancillary information (e.g. the page directory, data shared by several
       pages, thumbnails, etc.).  Using a single file format is very convenient for  storing  documents  or  for
       sending email attachments.

       When  you  type  the  URL  of a multi-page document, the DjVu browser plugin starts downloading the whole
       file, but displays the first page as soon as it is available.  You  can  immediately  navigate  to  other
       pages  using  the DjVu toolbar.  Suppose however that the document is stored on a remote web server.  You
       can easily access the first page and see that this is not the document you  wanted.   Although  you  will
       never  display  the  other  pages  the  browser  is  transferring data for these pages and is wasting the
       bandwidth of your server (and the bandwidth of the Internet too).  You could also see the summary of  the
       document on the first page and jump to page 100.  But page 100 cannot be displayed until data for pages 1
       to  99  has  been  received.   You  may have to wait for the transmission of unnecessary page data.  This
       second problem (the unnecessary wait) can be solved using the ``byte serving'' options  of  the  HTTP/1.1
       protocol.   This  option  has to be supported by the web server, the proxies, the caches and the browser.
       Byte serving however does not solve the first problem (the waste of bandwidth).

   <b>Indirect</b> <b>multi-page</b> <b>documents</b>
       Indirect multi-page DjVu documents solve both problems.  An indirect multi-page DjVu document is composed
       of several files.  The main file is named the index file.  You can browse a document using the URL of the
       index file, just like you do with a bundled multi-page document.  The index file however is  very  small.
       It simply contains the document directory and the URLs of secondary files containing the page data.  When
       you browse an indirect multi-page document, the browser only accesses data for the pages you are viewing.
       This  can be done at a reasonable speed because the browser maintains a cache of pages and sometimes pre-
       fetches a few pages ahead of the current page.  This model uses  the  web  serving  bandwidth  much  more
       effectively.   It  also  eliminates  unnecessary delays when jumping ahead to pages located anywhere in a
       long document.

   <b>Annotations</b>
       Every DjVu image optionally includes so-called annotation chunks.  The annotation chunk is often used  to
       define hyper-links to other document pages or to arbitrary web pages.  Annotation chunks can also be used
       for  other  purposes  such  as setting the initial viewing mode of a page, defining highlighted zones, or
       storing arbitrary meta-data about the page or the document.

   <b>Hidden</b> <b>text</b>
       Every DjVu image optionally includes a hidden text layer that  associated  graphical  features  with  the
       corresponding  text.   The  hidden  text  layer  is  usually  generated  by  running an Optical Character
       Recognition software.  This textual information provides for indexing DjVu documents and  copying/pasting
       text from DjVu page images.

   <b>Thumbnails</b>
       DjVu documents sometimes contain pre-computed page thumbnails.

   <b>Outline</b>
       DjVu  documents sometimes contain a navigation chunk containing an outline, that is, a hierarchical table
       of contents with pointers to the corresponding document pages.

</pre><h4><b>DJVUZONE</b> <b>AND</b> <b>DJVULIBRE</b></h4><pre>
       The DjVu technology was initially created by a few researchers  in  AT&amp;T  Labs  between  1995  and  1999.
       Lizardtech, Inc.  then obtained a commercial license from AT&amp;T and continued the development. The current
       owner of the DjVu commercial rights is Cuminas ( <b>https://www.cuminas.jp/en/about_djvu</b> ), offers solutions
       for  producing and distributing documents using the DjVu technology, as well as a DjVu viewer packaged as
       a Chrome extension.

       The DjVu.org web site ( <b><a href="http://www.djvu.org">http://www.djvu.org</a></b> ) is managed by the few AT&amp;T Labs researchers who created the
       DjVu technology in the first place.  We promote the DjVu technology by providing an independent source of
       information about DjVu.

       Understanding how little room there is for a proprietary document format, Lizardtech  released  the  DjVu
       Reference  Library  under  the  GNU  Public  License in December 2000.  This library entirely defines the
       compression format and the elementary codecs.  Six month  later,  Lizardtech  released  an  updated  DjVu
       Reference Library as well as the source code of the Unix viewer.

       These  two  releases  form  the basis of our initial DjVuLibre software.  We modified the build system to
       comply with the expectations of the open source community.  Various bugs and portability issues have been
       fixed.  We also tried to make it simpler to use and install, while preserving the essential structure  of
       the Lizardtech releases.

       The DjVuLibre software contains the following components:

       <b><a href="../man1/bzz.1.html">bzz</a></b>(1) A  general  purpose  compression  command  line  program.   Many internal DjVu data structures are
              compressed using this technique.

       <b><a href="../man1/c44.1.html">c44</a></b>(1) A DjVuPhoto command line encoder. This  state-of-the-art  wavelet  compressor  produces  DjVuPhoto
              images from PPM or JPEG images.

       <b><a href="../man1/cjb2.1.html">cjb2</a></b>(1)
              A  DjVuBitonal  command  line  encoder. This soft-pattern-matching compressor produces DjVuBitonal
              images from PBM images.  It can encode images without loss, or introduce small changes in order to
              improve the compression ratio.  The lossless  encoding  mode  is  competitive  with  that  of  the
              Lizardtech commercial encoders.

       <b><a href="../man1/cpaldjvu.1.html">cpaldjvu</a></b>(1)
              A  DjVuDocument  command  line encoder for images with few colors.  This encoder is well suited to
              compressing images with a small number of distinct colors (e.g. screen-shots).  The dominant color
              is encoded by the background layer.  The other colors are encoded by the foreground layer.

       <b><a href="../man1/csepdjvu.1.html">csepdjvu</a></b>(1)
              A DjVuDocument command line encoder for separated images.  This encoder takes  a  file  containing
              pre-segmented foreground and background images and produces a DjVuDocument image.

       <b><a href="../man1/ddjvu.1.html">ddjvu</a></b>(1)
              A  command  line  decoder  for  DjVu  images.   This program produces a PNM image representing any
              segment of any page of a DjVu document at any resolution.

       <b><a href="../man1/djview.1.html">djview</a></b>(1)
              A stand-alone viewer for DjVu images.  This sophisticated  viewer  displays  DjVu  documents.   It
              implements document navigation as well as fast zooming and panning.

       <b><a href="../man1/nsdejavu.1.html">nsdejavu</a></b>(1)
              A web browser plugin for viewing DjVu images.  This small plugin allows for viewing DjVu documents
              from web browsers.  It internally uses djview to perform the actual work.

       <b><a href="../man1/djvups.1.html">djvups</a></b>(1)
              A command line tool for converting DjVu documents into PostScript .

       <b><a href="../man1/djvm.1.html">djvm</a></b>(1)
              A  command  line  tool  for manipulating bundled multi-page DjVu documents.  This program is often
              used to collect individual pages and produce a bundled document.

       <b><a href="../man1/djvmcvt.1.html">djvmcvt</a></b>(1)
              A command line tool for converting bundled documents to indirect documents and conversely.

              Command line tools to edit DjVu metadata as XML files.

</pre><h4><b>DJVU</b> <b>ENCODERS</b> <b>AND</b> <b>ANY2DJVU</b></h4><pre>
       DjVuLibre comes with a variety of specialized encoders,  <b><a href="../man1/c44.1.html">c44</a></b>(1)  for  photographic  images,  <b><a href="../man1/cjb2.1.html">cjb2</a></b>(1)  for
       bitonal  images,  and  <b><a href="../man1/cpaldjvu.1.html">cpaldjvu</a></b>(1)  for images with few distinct colors.  Although these encoders perform
       well in their specialized domain, they cannot handle complex tasks involving segmentation  and  multipage
       encoding.

       The  Lizardtech  commercial products (see <b><a href="http://www.lizardtech.com/solutions/document">http://www.lizardtech.com/solutions/document</a></b>) can perform these
       complex encoding tasks

       Another solution is provided by the compression server at (<b><a href="http://any2djvu.djvu.org">http://any2djvu.djvu.org</a></b>).  This machine  uses
       pre-lizardtech prototype encoders from AT&amp;T Labs and performs almost as well as the commercial Lizardtech
       encoders.  Please note that the Any2DjVu compression server comes with no guarantee, that nothing is done
       to  ensure  that your documents will remain confidential, and that there is only one computer working for
       the whole planet.
