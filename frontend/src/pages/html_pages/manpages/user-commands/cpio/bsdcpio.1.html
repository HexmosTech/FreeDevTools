</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       cpio — copy files to and from archives

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>cpio</b> <b>-i</b> [<u>options</u>] [<u>pattern</u> <u>...</u>] [<u>&lt;</u> <u>archive</u>]
       <b>cpio</b> <b>-o</b> [<u>options</u>] <u>&lt;</u> <u>name-list</u> [<u>&gt;</u> <u>archive</u>]
       <b>cpio</b> <b>-p</b> [<u>options</u>] <u>dest-dir</u> <u>&lt;</u> <u>name-list</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>cpio</b> copies files between archives and directories.  This implementation can extract from tar, pax, cpio,
       zip, jar, ar, and ISO 9660 cdrom images and can create tar, pax, cpio, ar, and shar archives.

       The first option to <b>cpio</b> is a mode indicator from the following list:
       <b>-i</b>      Input.   Read an archive from standard input (unless overridden) and extract the contents to disk
               or (if the <b>-t</b> option is specified) list the contents to standard output.  If  one  or  more  file
               patterns are specified, only files matching one of the patterns will be extracted.
       <b>-o</b>      Output.   Read  a  list  of  filenames  from standard input and produce a new archive on standard
               output (unless overridden) containing the specified items.
       <b>-p</b>      Pass-through.  Read a list of filenames from standard input and copy the files to  the  specified
               directory.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Unless specifically stated otherwise, options are applicable in all operating modes.

       <b>-0</b>, <b>--null</b>
               Read  filenames separated by NUL characters instead of newlines.  This is necessary if any of the
               filenames being read might contain newlines.

       <b>-6</b>, <b>--pwb</b>
               When reading a binary format archive, assume it's the earlier one, from the PWB  variant  of  6th
               Edition UNIX.  When writing a cpio archive, use the PWB format.

       <b>-7</b>, <b>--binary</b>
               (o mode only) When writing a cpio archive, use the (newer, non-PWB) binary format.

       <b>-A</b>      (o mode only) Append to the specified archive.  (Not yet implemented.)

       <b>-a</b>      (o and p modes) Reset access times on files after they are read.

       <b>-B</b>      (o mode only) Block output to records of 5120 bytes.

       <b>-C</b> <u>size</u>
               (o mode only) Block output to records of <u>size</u> bytes.

       <b>-c</b>      (o mode only) Use the old POSIX portable character format.  Equivalent to <b>--format</b> <u>odc</u>.

       <b>-d</b>, <b>--make-directories</b>
               (i and p modes) Create directories as necessary.

       <b>-E</b> <u>file</u>
               (i mode only) Read list of file name patterns from <u>file</u> to list and extract.

       <b>-F</b> <u>file</u>, <b>--file</b> <u>file</u>
               Read archive from or write archive to <u>file</u>.

       <b>-f</b> <u>pattern</u>
               (i mode only) Ignore files that match <u>pattern</u>.

       <b>-H</b> <u>format</u>, <b>--format</b> <u>format</u>
               (o mode only) Produce the output archive in the specified format.  Supported formats include:

               <u>cpio</u>     Synonym for <u>odc</u>.
               <u>newc</u>     The SVR4 portable cpio format.
               <u>odc</u>      The old POSIX.1 portable octet-oriented cpio format.
               <u>pax</u>      The POSIX.1 pax format, an extension of the ustar format.
               <u>ustar</u>    The POSIX.1 tar format.

               The  default  format  is  <u>odc</u>.  See <u><a href="../man5/libarchive-formats.5.html">libarchive-formats</a></u>(5) for more complete information about the
               formats currently supported by the underlying <u><a href="../man3/libarchive.3.html">libarchive</a></u>(3) library.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
               Print usage information.

       <b>-I</b> <u>file</u>
               Read archive from <u>file</u>.

       <b>-i</b>, <b>--extract</b>
               Input mode.  See above for description.

       <b>--insecure</b>
               (i and p mode only) Disable security checks during extraction or copying.  This allows extraction
               via symbolic links, absolute paths, and path names containing ‘..’ in the name.

       <b>-J</b>, <b>--xz</b>
               (o mode only) Compress the file with xz-compatible compression before writing it.  In input mode,
               this option is ignored; xz compression is recognized automatically on input.

       <b>-j</b>      Synonym for <b>-y</b>.

       <b>-L</b>      (o and p modes) All symbolic links will be followed.  Normally, symbolic links are  archived  and
               copied  as  symbolic  links.  With this option, the target of the link will be archived or copied
               instead.

       <b>-l</b>, <b>--link</b>
               (p mode only) Create links from the target directory to the original files, instead of copying.

       <b>--lrzip</b>
               (o mode only) Compress the resulting archive with  <u><a href="../man1/lrzip.1.html">lrzip</a></u>(1).   In  input  mode,  this  option  is
               ignored.

       <b>--lz4</b>   (o  mode  only) Compress the archive with lz4-compatible compression before writing it.  In input
               mode, this option is ignored; lz4 compression is recognized automatically on input.

       <b>--zstd</b>  (o mode only) Compress the archive with zstd-compatible compression before writing it.  In  input
               mode, this option is ignored; zstd compression is recognized automatically on input.

       <b>--lzma</b>  (o  mode  only)  Compress  the file with lzma-compatible compression before writing it.  In input
               mode, this option is ignored; lzma compression is recognized automatically on input.

       <b>--lzop</b>  (o mode only) Compress the resulting archive  with  <u><a href="../man1/lzop.1.html">lzop</a></u>(1).   In  input  mode,  this  option  is
               ignored.

       <b>--passphrase</b> <u>passphrase</u>
               The  <u>passphrase</u>  is  used  to  extract  or create an encrypted archive.  Currently, zip is only a
               format that <b>cpio</b> can handle encrypted archives.  You shouldn't use this option unless you realize
               how insecure use of this option is.

       <b>-m</b>, <b>--preserve-modification-time</b>
               (i and p modes) Set file modification time on created files to match those in the source.

       <b>-n</b>, <b>--numeric-uid-gid</b>
               (i mode, only with <b>-t</b>) Display numeric uid and gid.  By default, <b>cpio</b> displays the user and group
               names when they are provided in the archive, or looks up the user and group names in  the  system
               password database.

       <b>--no-preserve-owner</b>
               (i mode only) Do not attempt to restore file ownership.  This is the default when run by non-root
               users.

       <b>-O</b> <u>file</u>
               Write archive to <u>file</u>.

       <b>-o</b>, <b>--create</b>
               Output mode.  See above for description.

       <b>-p</b>, <b>--pass-through</b>
               Pass-through mode.  See above for description.

       <b>--preserve-owner</b>
               (i mode only) Restore file ownership.  This is the default when run by the root user.

       <b>--quiet</b>
               Suppress unnecessary messages.

       <b>-R</b> [user][:][group], <b>--owner</b> [user][:][group]
               Set  the  owner  and/or  group  on  files in the output.  If group is specified with no user (for
               example, <b>-R</b> <u>:wheel</u>) then the group will be set but not the user.  If the user is specified with a
               trailing colon and no group (for example, <b>-R</b> <u>root:</u>) then the group will  be  set  to  the  user's
               default  group.   If  the user is specified with no trailing colon, then the user will be set but
               not the group.  In <b>-i</b> and <b>-p</b> modes, this option  can  only  be  used  by  the  super-user.   (For
               compatibility, a period can be used in place of the colon.)

       <b>-r</b>      (All  modes.)   Rename  files  interactively.   For  each  file,  a prompt is written to <u>/dev/tty</u>
               containing the name of the file and a line is read from <u>/dev/tty</u>.  If the line read is blank, the
               file is skipped.  If the  line  contains  a  single  period,  the  file  is  processed  normally.
               Otherwise, the line is taken to be the new name of the file.

       <b>-t</b>, <b>--list</b>
               (i mode only) List the contents of the archive to stdout; do not restore the contents to disk.

       <b>-u</b>, <b>--unconditional</b>
               (i  and  p  modes)  Unconditionally overwrite existing files.  Ordinarily, an older file will not
               overwrite a newer file on disk.

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--dot</b>
               Print a dot to stderr for each file as it is processed.  Superseded by <b>-v</b>.

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b>
               Print the name of each file to stderr as it is processed.  With <b>-t</b>, provide a detailed listing of
               each file.

       <b>--version</b>
               Print the program version information and exit.

       <b>-y</b>      (o mode only) Compress the archive with bzip2-compatible compression before writing it.  In input
               mode, this option is ignored; bzip2 compression is recognized automatically on input.

       <b>-Z</b>      (o mode only) Compress the archive with compress-compatible compression before  writing  it.   In
               input mode, this option is ignored; compression is recognized automatically on input.

       <b>-z</b>      (o  mode only) Compress the archive with gzip-compatible compression before writing it.  In input
               mode, this option is ignored; gzip compression is recognized automatically on input.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>cpio</b> utility exits 0 on success, and &gt;0 if an error occurs.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       The following environment variables affect the execution of <b>cpio</b>:

       LANG       The locale to use.  See <u><a href="../man7/environ.7.html">environ</a></u>(7) for more information.

       TZ         The timezone to use when displaying dates.  See <u><a href="../man7/environ.7.html">environ</a></u>(7) for more information.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>cpio</b> command is traditionally used to copy file hierarchies in conjunction with the <u><a href="../man1/find.1.html">find</a></u>(1)  command.
       The first example here simply copies all files from <u>src</u> to <u>dest</u>:
             <b>find</b> <u>src</u> | <b>cpio</b> <b>-pmud</b> <u>dest</u>

       By  carefully selecting options to the <u><a href="../man1/find.1.html">find</a></u>(1) command and combining it with other standard utilities, it
       is possible to exercise very fine control over which files are copied.  This next  example  copies  files
       from <u>src</u> to <u>dest</u> that are more than 2 days old and whose names match a particular pattern:
             <b>find</b> <u>src</u> <b>-mtime</b> <u>+2</u> | <b>grep</b> <b>foo[bar]</b> | <b>cpio</b> <b>-pdmu</b> <u>dest</u>

       This  example  copies  files  from  <u>src</u>  to <u>dest</u> that are more than 2 days old and which contain the word
       “foobar”:
             <b>find</b> <u>src</u> <b>-mtime</b> <u>+2</u> | <b>xargs</b> <b>grep</b> <b>-l</b> <b>foobar</b> | <b>cpio</b> <b>-pdmu</b> <u>dest</u>

</pre><h4><b>COMPATIBILITY</b></h4><pre>
       The mode options i, o, and p and the options a, B, c, d, f, l, m, r, t, u, and v comply with SUSv2.

       The old POSIX.1 standard specified that only <b>-i</b>, <b>-o</b>, and <b>-p</b> were  interpreted  as  command-line  options.
       Each  took  a  single argument of a list of modifier characters.  For example, the standard syntax allows
       <b>-imu</b> but does not support <b>-miu</b> or <b>-i</b> <b>-m</b> <b>-u</b>, since <u>m</u> and <u>u</u> are only modifiers to <b>-i</b>, they are not command-
       line options in their own right.  The syntax supported by  this  implementation  is  backwards-compatible
       with the standard.  For best compatibility, scripts should limit themselves to the standard syntax.

</pre><h4><b>STANDARDS</b></h4><pre>
       There  is  no current POSIX standard for the cpio command; it appeared in ISO/IEC 9945-1:1996 (“POSIX.1”)
       but was dropped from IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 (“POSIX.1”).

       The cpio, ustar, and pax interchange file formats are defined by IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 (“POSIX.1”) for the
       pax command.

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       The original <b>cpio</b> and <b>find</b> utilities were written by Dick Haight while working  in  AT&amp;T's  Unix  Support
       Group.   They  first appeared in 1977 in PWB/UNIX 1.0, the “Programmer's Work Bench” system developed for
       use within AT&amp;T.  They were first released outside of AT&amp;T as part of System III  Unix  in  1981.   As  a
       result,  <b>cpio</b>  actually  predates  <b>tar</b>, even though it was not well-known outside of AT&amp;T until some time
       later.

       This is a complete re-implementation based on the <u><a href="../man3/libarchive.3.html">libarchive</a></u>(3) library.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       The cpio archive format has several basic limitations: It does not  store  user  and  group  names,  only
       numbers.   As a result, it cannot be reliably used to transfer files between systems with dissimilar user
       and group numbering.  Older cpio formats limit the user and group numbers to 16  or  18  bits,  which  is
       insufficient  for modern systems.  The cpio archive formats cannot support files over 4 gigabytes, except
       for the “odc” variant, which can support files up to 8 gigabytes.
