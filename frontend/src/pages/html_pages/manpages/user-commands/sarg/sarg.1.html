</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       sarg - Squid Analysis Report Generator

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>

       <b>sarg</b> [options] [logfile...]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>sarg</b> is a log file parser and analyzer for the <b>Squid</b> <b>Web</b> <b>Proxy</b> <b>Cache</b>[1]. It allows you to view "where"
       your users are going to on the Internet.

       <b>sarg</b> generates reports in HTML with fields such as: users, IP Addresses, bytes, sites, and times. These
       HTML files can appear in your web server's directory for browsing by users or administrators. You may
       also have <b>sarg</b> email the reports to the Squid Cache administrator.

       <b>sarg</b> can read squid or Microsoft ISA access logs. Optionally, it can complement the reports with the log
       of a Squid filter/redirector such as <b>squidGuard</b>[2].

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       A summary of options is included below.

       <b>-h</b> <b>--help</b>
           Show summary of options.

       <b>-a</b> <b>hostname|ip</b> <b>address</b>
           Limits report to records containing the specified hostname/ip address

       <b>-b</b> <u>filename</u>
           Enables UserAgent log and writes it to <u>filename</u>.

       <b>-c</b> <u>filename</u>
           Read <u>filename</u> for a list of the web hosts to exclude from the report. See the section called “HOST
           EXCLUSION FILE”.

       <b>--convert</b>
           Convert a squid log file date/time field to a human-readable format. All the log files are read and
           output as one text on the standard output.

       <b>--css</b>
           Output, on the standard output, the internal css <b>sarg</b> inlines in the reports. You can redirect the
           output to a file of your choice and edit it. Then you can override the internal css with
           <u>external_css_file</u> in sarg.conf.

           Using an external css can reduce the size of the report file. If you are short on disk space, you may
           consider exporting the css as explained above.

       <b>-d</b> <u>date</u>
           Use <u>date</u> to restrict the report to some date range during log file processing. Format for <u>date</u> is
           <b>dd/mm/yyyy-dd/mm/yyyy</b> or a single date <b>dd/mm/yyyy</b>. Date ranges can also be specified as <u>day-</u><b>n</b>,
           <u>week-</u><b>n</b>, or <u>month-</u><b>n</b> where <b>n</b> is the number of days, weeks or months to jump backward. Note that there
           is no spaces around the hyphen.

       <b>-e</b> <u>email</u>
           Sends report to <u>email</u> (stdout for console).

       <b>-f</b> <u>filename</u>
           Reads configuration from <u>filename</u>.

       <b>-g</b> <b>e|u</b>
           Sets date format in generated reports.
               e = Europe -&gt; dd/mm/yy
               u = USA    -&gt; mm/dd/yy

       <b>-i</b>
           Generates reports by user and ip address.

               <b>Note</b>
               This requires the <u>report_type</u> option in config file to contain "users_sites".

       <b>--keeplogs</b>
           Don't delete any old report. It is equivalent to setting <b>--lastlog</b> <b>0</b> but is provided for convenience.

       <b>-l</b> <u>filename</u>
           Uses <u>filename</u> as the input log. This option can be repeated up to 255 times to read multiple files.
           If the files end with the extension .gz, .bz2 or .Z they are decompressed. If the file name is just
           <u>-</u>, the log file is read from standard input. In that case, it cannot be compressed.

           This option is kept for compatibility with older versions of sarg but, starting with sarg 2.3, the
           log files may be named on the command line without the <b>-l</b> option. It allows the use of wildcards on
           the command line. Make sure you don't exceed the limit of 255 files.

       <b>--lastlog</b> <u>n</u>
           Limit the number of logs kept in the output directory to <u>n</u>. Any supernumerary report is deleted
           starting with the oldest report. The value of <u>n</u> must be positive or zero. A value of zero means no
           report should be deleted.

       <b>-L</b> <u>filename</u>
           Reads a proxy redirector log file such as one created by squidGuard or Rejik. If you use this option,
           you may want to configure <u>redirector_log_format</u> in sarg.conf to match the output format of your web
           content filtering program. This option can be repeated up to 64 times to read multiple files.

       <b>-n</b>
           Enables ip address resolution.

       <b>-o</b> <u>dir</u>
           Writes report in <u>dir</u>.

       <b>-p</b>
           Generates reports using ip address instead of userid.

       <b>-P</b> <u>prefix</u> <b>--splitprefix</b> <u>prefix</u>
           This option must be used with <b>--split</b>. If it is provided, the input log is split among several files
           each containing one day. The name of the output files is made of the <u>prefix</u> and the date formatted as
           -YYYY-MM-DD.

           The output files are written in the output directory specified with <b>-o</b> or in the current directory.

       <b>-r</b>
           Output the realtime report on the standard output and exit.

       <b>-s</b> <u>string</u>
           Limits report to the site specified by <u>string</u> [eg. www.debian.org]

       <b>--split</b>
           Split the squid log file and output it as text on the standard output omitting the dates outside of
           the range specified by the <b>-d</b> parameter. If it is combined with <b>--convert</b> the dates are also
           converted to a human-readable format.

           Combined with <b>-P</b>, the log is written in several files each containing one day of the original log.

       <b>--statistics</b>
           Writes some statistics about the execution time. The statistics include the total execution time; the
           number of records read in the input log files and the time it took to read them; the number of
           records and users processed and the time it took to process them.

       <b>-t</b> <u>string</u>
           Limits the records included in the report based on time-of-day. Format for <u>string</u> is <b>HH:MM</b> or
           <b>HH:MM-HH:MM</b>. The former reports only the requested time. The latter reports any entry falling within
           the requested range. This limit complement the limit imposed by option <b>-d</b>.

       <b>-u</b> <u>user</u>
           Limits reports to <u>user</u> activities.

       <b>-v</b>
           Write sarg version and exit.

       <b>-w</b> <u>dir</u>
           Store temporary files in <u>dir</u>. In fact, <b>sarg</b> stores its temporary files in the sarg subdirectory of
           <u>dir</u>. Be sure to set the HTML output directory to a place outside of the temporary directory or sarg
           may fail or delete the report when it completes its task.

       <b>-x</b>
           Writes debug messages to stdout

       <b>-z</b>
           Writes process messages to stdout.

</pre><h4><b>HOST</b> <b>EXCLUSION</b> <b>FILE</b></h4><pre>
       Sarg can be told to exclude visited hosts from the report by providing it with a file containing one host
       to exclude per line. The "host" may be one of the following:

       •   a full host name,

       •   a host name starting with a wildcard (*) to match any prefix,

       •   a single ip address,

       •   a subnet noted a.b.c.d/e.

       <b>Example</b> <b>1.</b> <b>Example</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>hosts</b> <b>exclusion</b> <b>file</b>
           *.google.com
           10.0.0.0/8

       Sarg cannot exclude IPv6 addresses at the moment.
