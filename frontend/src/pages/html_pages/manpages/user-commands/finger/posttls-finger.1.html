</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       posttls-finger - Probe the TLS properties of an ESMTP or LMTP server.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>posttls-finger</b> [<u>options</u>] [<b>inet:</b>]<u>domain</u>[:<u>port</u>] [<u>match</u> <u>...</u>]
       <b>posttls-finger</b> -S [<u>options</u>] <b>unix:</b><u>pathname</u> [<u>match</u> <u>...</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b><a href="../man1/posttls-finger.1.html">posttls-finger</a></b>(1)  connects  to  the  specified destination and reports TLS-related information about the
       server. With SMTP, the destination is a domainname; with LMTP it is either  a  domainname  prefixed  with
       <b>inet:</b>  or  a  pathname  prefixed  with  <b>unix:</b>.   If  Postfix  is built without TLS support, the resulting
       <b><a href="../man1/posttls-finger.1.html">posttls-finger</a></b>(1) program has very limited functionality, and only the <b>-a</b>, <b>-c</b>, <b>-h</b>, <b>-o</b>, <b>-S</b>, <b>-t</b>, <b>-T</b> and  <b>-v</b>
       options are available.

       Note:  this  is  an  unsupported  test  program.  No  attempt  is  made to maintain compatibility between
       successive versions.

       For SMTP servers that don't support ESMTP, only the greeting banner and the negative  EHLO  response  are
       reported. Otherwise, the reported EHLO response details further server capabilities.

       If  TLS  support  is  enabled when <b><a href="../man1/posttls-finger.1.html">posttls-finger</a></b>(1) is compiled, and the server supports <b>STARTTLS</b>, a TLS
       handshake is attempted.

       If DNSSEC support is available, the connection TLS security level  (<b>-l</b>  option)  defaults  to  <b>dane</b>;  see
       TLS_README  for  details.  Otherwise,  it  defaults  to  <b>secure</b>.  This setting determines the certificate
       matching policy.

       If TLS negotiation succeeds, the TLS protocol and cipher details are reported. The server certificate  is
       then  verified  in  accordance  with  the  policy at the chosen (or default) security level.  With public
       CA-based trust, when the <b>-L</b> option includes <b>certmatch</b>, (true by default) name matching is performed  even
       if the certificate chain is not trusted.  This logs the names found in the remote SMTP server certificate
       and which if any would match, were the certificate chain trusted.

       Note: <b><a href="../man1/posttls-finger.1.html">posttls-finger</a></b>(1) does not perform any table lookups, so the TLS policy table and obsolete per-site
       tables  are  not  consulted.   It  does  not  communicate with the <b><a href="../man8/tlsmgr.8.html">tlsmgr</a></b>(8) daemon (or any other Postfix
       daemons); its TLS session cache is held in private memory, and disappears when the process exits.

       With the <b>-r</b> <u>delay</u> option, if the server assigns a  TLS  session  id,  the  TLS  session  is  cached.  The
       connection  is  then  closed  and re-opened after the specified delay, and <b><a href="../man1/posttls-finger.1.html">posttls-finger</a></b>(1) then reports
       whether the cached TLS session was re-used.

       When the destination is a load balancer, it may be distributing  load  between  multiple  server  caches.
       Typically, each server returns its unique name in its EHLO response. If, upon reconnecting with <b>-r</b>, a new
       server  name  is detected, another session is cached for the new server, and the reconnect is repeated up
       to a maximum number of times (default 5) that can be specified via the <b>-m</b> option.

       The choice of SMTP or LMTP (<b>-S</b> option) determines the syntax of the destination argument. With SMTP,  one
       can  specify a service on a non-default port as <u>host</u>:<u>service</u>, and disable MX (mail exchanger) DNS lookups
       with [<u>host</u>] or [<u>host</u>]:<u>port</u>.  The [] form is required  when  you  specify  an  IP  address  instead  of  a
       hostname.   An  IPv6  address takes the form [<b>ipv6:</b><u>address</u>].  The default port for SMTP is taken from the
       <b>smtp/tcp</b> entry in <a href="file:/etc/services">/etc/services</a>, defaulting to 25 if the entry is not found.

       With LMTP, specify <b>unix:</b><u>pathname</u> to connect to a local server listening on a unix-domain socket bound  to
       the  specified pathname; otherwise, specify an optional <b>inet:</b> prefix followed by a <u>domain</u> and an optional
       port, with the same syntax as for SMTP. The default TCP port for LMTP is 24.

       Arguments:

       <b>-a</b> <u>family</u> (default: <b>any</b>)
              Address family preference: <b>ipv4</b>, <b>ipv6</b> or <b>any</b>.  When using  <b>any</b>,  <b><a href="../man1/posttls-finger.1.html">posttls-finger</a></b>(1)  will  randomly
              select  one of the two as the more preferred, and exhaust all MX preferences for the first address
              family before trying any addresses for the other.

       <b>-A</b> <u>trust-anchor.pem</u> (default: none)
              A list of PEM trust-anchor files that  overrides  CAfile  and  CApath  trust  chain  verification.
              Specify  the  option  multiple times to specify multiple files.  See the main.cf documentation for
              smtp_tls_trust_anchor_file for details.

       <b>-c</b>     Disable SMTP chat logging; only TLS-related information is logged.

       <b>-C</b>     Print the remote SMTP server certificate trust chain in PEM format.  The issuer  DN,  subject  DN,
              certificate  and  public  key  fingerprints (see <b>-d</b> <u>mdalg</u> option below) are printed above each PEM
              certificate block.  If you specify <b>-F</b> <u>CAfile</u> or <b>-P</b> <u>CApath</u>, the OpenSSL  library  may  augment  the
              chain  with  missing  issuer certificates.  To see the actual chain sent by the remote SMTP server
              leave <u>CAfile</u> and <u>CApath</u> unset.

       <b>-d</b> <u>mdalg</u> (default: <b>$smtp_tls_fingerprint_digest</b>)
              The message digest algorithm to use for reporting remote SMTP  server  fingerprints  and  matching
              against  user provided certificate fingerprints (with DANE TLSA records the algorithm is specified
              in the DNS).  In Postfix versions prior to 3.6, the default value was "md5".

       <b>-f</b>     Look up the associated DANE TLSA RRset even when a hostname  is  not  an  alias  and  its  address
              records lie in an unsigned zone.  See smtp_tls_force_insecure_host_tlsa_lookup for details.

       <b>-F</b> <u>CAfile.pem</u> (default: none)
              The PEM formatted CAfile for remote SMTP server certificate verification.  By default no CAfile is
              used and no public CAs are trusted.

       <b>-g</b> <u>grade</u> (default: medium)
              The  minimum  TLS  cipher  grade  used  by  <b><a href="../man1/posttls-finger.1.html">posttls-finger</a></b>(1).  See smtp_tls_mandatory_ciphers for
              details.

       <b>-h</b> <u>host_lookup</u> (default: <b>dns</b>)
              The hostname lookup methods used for the connection.  See the  documentation  of  smtp_host_lookup
              for syntax and semantics.

       <b>-H</b> <u>chainfiles</u> (default: <u>none</u>)
              List of files with a sequence PEM-encoded TLS client certificate chains.  The list can be built-up
              incrementally,  by  specifying the option multiple times, or all at once via a comma or whitespace
              separated list of filenames.  Each chain starts with a private key, which is followed  immediately
              by  the  corresponding certificate, and optionally by additional issuer certificates. Each new key
              begins a new chain for the corresponding algorithm.  This option is mutually  exclusive  with  the
              below <b>-k</b> and <b>-K</b> options.

       <b>-k</b> <u>certfile</u> (default: <u>keyfile</u>)
              File with PEM-encoded TLS client certificate chain. This defaults to <u>keyfile</u> if one is specified.

       <b>-K</b> <u>keyfile</u> (default: <u>certfile</u>)
              File with PEM-encoded TLS client private key.  This defaults to <u>certfile</u> if one is specified.

       <b>-l</b> <u>level</u> (default: <b>dane</b> or <b>secure</b>)
              The  security  level  for  the  connection,  default <b>dane</b> or <b>secure</b> depending on whether DNSSEC is
              available.  For syntax and semantics, see the documentation of smtp_tls_security_level.  When <b>dane</b>
              or <b>dane-only</b> is supported and selected, if no TLSA records are found, or all the records found are
              unusable, the <u>secure</u> level will be used instead.  The <b>fingerprint</b> security  level  allows  you  to
              test certificate or public-key fingerprint matches before you deploy them in the policy table.

              Note,  since  <b><a href="../man1/posttls-finger.1.html">posttls-finger</a></b>(1)  does  not  actually  deliver any email, the <b>none</b>, <b>may</b> and <b>encrypt</b>
              security levels are not very useful.  Since <b>may</b> and <b>encrypt</b> don't require peer certificates,  they
              will  often  negotiate  anonymous  TLS ciphersuites, so you won't learn much about the remote SMTP
              server's certificates at these levels if it also supports anonymous TLS (though you may learn that
              the server supports anonymous TLS).

       <b>-L</b> <u>logopts</u> (default: <b>routine,certmatch</b>)
              Fine-grained TLS logging options. To tune the  TLS  features  logged  during  the  TLS  handshake,
              specify one or more of:

              <b>0,</b> <b>none</b>
                     These  yield no TLS logging; you'll generally want more, but this is handy if you just want
                     the trust chain:
                     $ posttls-finger -cC -L none destination

              <b>1,</b> <b>routine,</b> <b>summary</b>
                     These synonymous values yield a normal one-line summary of the TLS connection.

              <b>2,</b> <b>debug</b>
                     These synonymous values combine routine, ssl-debug, cache and verbose.

              <b>3,</b> <b>ssl-expert</b>
                     These synonymous values combine debug with ssl-handshake-packet-dump.  For experts only.

              <b>4,</b> <b>ssl-developer</b>
                     These synonymous values combine ssl-expert with ssl-session-packet-dump.  For experts only,
                     and in most cases, use wireshark instead.

              <b>ssl-debug</b>
                     Turn on OpenSSL logging of the progress of the SSL handshake.

              <b>ssl-handshake-packet-dump</b>
                     Log hexadecimal packet dumps of the SSL handshake; for experts only.

              <b>ssl-session-packet-dump</b>
                     Log hexadecimal packet dumps of the entire SSL session; only useful to those who can  debug
                     SSL protocol problems from hex dumps.

              <b>untrusted</b>
                     Logs trust chain verification problems.  This is turned on automatically at security levels
                     that use peer names signed by Certification Authorities to validate certificates.  So while
                     this setting is recognized, you should never need to set it explicitly.

              <b>peercert</b>
                     This  logs  a  one  line summary of the remote SMTP server certificate subject, issuer, and
                     fingerprints.

              <b>certmatch</b>
                     This logs remote SMTP server certificate matching, showing the CN and  each  subjectAltName
                     and  which  name  matched.   With  DANE,  logs  matching  of  TLSA  record trust-anchor and
                     end-entity certificates.

              <b>cache</b>  This logs session cache operations, showing whether session caching is effective  with  the
                     remote  SMTP server.  Automatically used when reconnecting with the <b>-r</b> option; rarely needs
                     to be set explicitly.

              <b>verbose</b>
                     Enables verbose logging in the Postfix TLS driver;  includes  all  of  peercert..cache  and
                     more.

              The  default  is  <b>routine,certmatch</b>.  After  a  reconnect,  <b>peercert</b>,  <b>certmatch</b>  and  <b>verbose</b> are
              automatically disabled while <b>cache</b> and <b>summary</b> are enabled.

       <b>-m</b> <u>count</u> (default: <b>5</b>)
              When the <b>-r</b> <u>delay</u> option is specified, the <b>-m</b> option determines the maximum  number  of  reconnect
              attempts  to use with a server behind a load balancer, to see whether connection caching is likely
              to be effective for this destination.  Some MTAs don't expose the underlying  server  identity  in
              their EHLO response; with these servers there will never be more than 1 reconnection attempt.

       <b>-M</b> <u>insecure_mx_policy</u> (default: <b>dane</b>)
              The TLS policy for MX hosts with "secure" TLSA records when the nexthop destination security level
              is  <b>dane</b>,  but the MX record was found via an "insecure" MX lookup.  See the main.cf documentation
              for smtp_tls_dane_insecure_mx_policy for details.

       <b>-o</b> <u>name=value</u>
              Specify zero or more times to override the  value  of  the  main.cf  parameter  <u>name</u>  with  <u>value</u>.
              Possible  use-cases  include  overriding  the values of TLS library parameters, or "myhostname" to
              configure the SMTP EHLO name sent to the remote server.

       <b>-p</b> <u>protocols</u> (default: &gt;=TLSv1)
              TLS protocols that <b><a href="../man1/posttls-finger.1.html">posttls-finger</a></b>(1) will exclude or  include.   See  smtp_tls_mandatory_protocols
              for details.

       <b>-P</b> <u>CApath/</u> (default: none)
              The  OpenSSL  CApath/  directory  (indexed  via  <a href="../man1/c_rehash.1.html">c_rehash</a>(1))  for  remote SMTP server certificate
              verification.  By default no CApath is used and no public CAs are trusted.

       <b>-r</b> <u>delay</u>
              With a cacheable TLS session, disconnect and reconnect after <u>delay</u>  seconds.  Report  whether  the
              session  is  re-used. Retry if a new server is encountered, up to 5 times or as specified with the
              <b>-m</b> option.  By default reconnection is disabled, specify a positive delay to enable this behavior.

       <b>-R</b>     Use SRV lookup instead of MX.

       <b>-s</b> <u>servername</u>
              The server name to send with the TLS Server Name Indication (SNI) extension.  When the server  has
              DANE TLSA records, this parameter is ignored and the TLSA base domain is used instead.  Otherwise,
              SNI is not used by default, but can be enabled by specifying the desired value with this option.

       <b>-S</b>     Disable  SMTP;  that  is,  connect  to  an  LMTP server. The default port for LMTP over TCP is 24.
              Alternative ports can specified by appending "<u>:servicename</u>" or ":<u>portnumber</u>"  to  the  destination
              argument.

       <b>-t</b> <u>timeout</u> (default: <b>30</b>)
              The  TCP  connection timeout to use.  This is also the timeout for reading the remote server's 220
              banner.

       <b>-T</b> <u>timeout</u> (default: <b>30</b>)
              The SMTP/LMTP command timeout for EHLO/LHLO, STARTTLS and QUIT.

       <b>-v</b>     Enable verbose Postfix logging.  Specify more than once to increase the level of verbose logging.

       <b>-w</b>     Enable outgoing TLS wrapper mode, or SUBMISSIONS/SMTPS support.  This  is  typically  provided  on
              port  465  by  servers that are compatible with the SMTP-in-SSL protocol, rather than the STARTTLS
              protocol.  The destination <u>domain</u>:<u>port</u> must of course provide such a service.

       <b>-x</b>     Prefer RFC7250 non-X.509  raw  public  key  (RPK)  server  credentials.   By  default  only  X.509
              certificates  are accepted.  This is analogous to setting <b>smtp_tls_enable_rpk</b> <b>=</b> <b>yes</b> in the <a href="../man8/smtp.8.html">smtp</a>(8)
              client.  At the fingerprint security level, when raw public keys are enabled, only public key (and
              not certificate) fingerprints will be compared against the  specified  list  of  <u>match</u>  arguments.
              Certificate  fingerprints  are  fragile when raw public keys are solicited, the server may at some
              point in time start returning only the public key.

       <b>-X</b>     Enable <b><a href="../man8/tlsproxy.8.html">tlsproxy</a></b>(8) mode. This is an unsupported mode, for program development only.

       [<b>inet:</b>]<u>domain</u>[:<u>port</u>]
              Connect via TCP to domain <u>domain</u>, port <u>port</u>. The default port is <b>smtp</b> (or  24  with  LMTP).   With
              SMTP  an  MX lookup is performed to resolve the domain to a host, unless the domain is enclosed in
              <b>[]</b>.  If you want to  connect  to  a  specific  MX  host,  for  instance  <u>mx1.example.com</u>,  specify
              [<u>mx1.example.com</u>]  as  the  destination  and <u>example.com</u> as a <b>match</b> argument.  When using DNS, the
              destination domain is assumed fully qualified  and  no  default  domain  or  search  suffixes  are
              applied;  you  must  use  fully-qualified  names  or  also enable <b>native</b> host lookups (these don't
              support <b>dane</b> or <b>dane-only</b> as no DNSSEC validation information is available via <b>native</b> lookups).

       <b>unix:</b><u>pathname</u>
              Connect to the UNIX-domain socket at <u>pathname</u>. LMTP only.

       <b>match</b> <b>...</b>
              With no match arguments specified, certificate peername  matching  uses  the  compiled-in  default
              strategies  for  each security level.  If you specify one or more arguments, these will be used as
              the list of certificate or public-key digests to match for the <b>fingerprint</b> level, or as  the  list
              of  DNS  names to match in the certificate at the <b>verify</b> and <b>secure</b> levels.  If the security level
              is <b>dane</b>, or <b>dane-only</b> the match names are ignored, and <b>hostname,</b> <b>nexthop</b> strategies are used.
