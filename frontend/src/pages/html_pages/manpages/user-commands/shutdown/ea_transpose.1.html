</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ea_transpose</b> - Compute the transpose of the restart matrix

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ea_transpose</b> [<b>-v</b>] [<b>-l</b> &lt;index&gt;] &lt;file&gt; &lt;outfile&gt;

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Compute the transpose of the restart matrix of &lt;file&gt;, output to &lt;outfile&gt;.

       <b>-v</b>: Increase verbosity.

       <b>-l</b> &lt;index&gt;:    Read the &lt;index&gt; substring of 1000000 samples.

       &lt;file&gt;:  File  with  (blocks  of)  1000 sets of restart data, each set being 1000 samples.  The result is
              saved in &lt;file&gt;.column This program computes the transpose of the  restart  matrix,  and  produces
              column data appropriate testing with the other tools.  This helps to support the testing described
              in SP800-90B Section 3.1.2 #3

       <b>--version</b>: Prints tool version information
