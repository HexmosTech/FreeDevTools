</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       shellex - shell-based launcher

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>shellex</b> [...]

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       All command-line parameters (together with some shellex-specific) are passed on to urxvt. This means, you
       can you e.g. <u>-bg</u> <u>grey20</u> for a lighter background. Using it for more than just customizing the appearance
       (for example adding own extensions) might stop shellex from working, so be careful.

       See <a href="../man1/urxvt.1.html">urxvt</a>(1) for a full list of options.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>shellex</b> is a shell-based launcher with a lot more features and a lot simpler design. It launches a shell
       (currently <a href="../man1/zsh.1.html">zsh</a>(1)) and shows it in a small terminal (currently <a href="../man1/urxvt.1.html">urxvt</a>(1)), wrapping every command with a
       little bit of extra magic (redirecting stdout, stderr, disowning and closing the shell) to get more
       typical launcher-behaviour.

       This gives you a simple launcher with tab-completion and other shell-features, configurable in shell.

</pre><h4><b>RESOURCES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>shellex</b> uses two X-Resources at the moment, to manipulate its behaviour:

       shellex.pos
           If pointer, shellex shows the window on the window, the mousepointer is on. If focus, it uses the
           output, where most of the currently focused window is. Defaults to focus.

       shellex.edge
           On what screen edge to show the launcher (top or bottom). Defaults to top.

       Additionally all resources defined by urxvt (with class <u>shellex</u> instead of <u>urxvt</u>) can be used to
       customize the appearance or behaviour of the used terminal window.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>shellex</b> configuration snippets can be found in <b>/usr/lib/shellex/</b>.

       On start, <b>shellex</b> assembles a list of snippet basenames by looking at all of the paths listed below. For
       each snippet basename, <b>shellex</b> loads the first file it finds when looking through the paths in order:

        1. $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/.shellex. Typically unset, defaulting to $HOME/.config/shellex.

        2. $HOME/.shellex

        3. /etc/shellex (shellex defaults, symlinks to <b>/usr/lib/shellex/conf/</b>)

       To customize shellex, you can do the following things in <b>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/.shellex</b> or <b>$HOME/.shellex/</b>:

        1. Overwrite a default by creating a new snippet of the same name

        2. Not include a default by creating a symlink to <b>/dev/null</b> of the same same

        3. Include an example-snippet not used by default, by creating a symlink to <b>/usr/lib/shellex/snippet</b>

        4. Write you own snippets with a currently unused name

       To avoid naming-conflicts in the future, you should add a common suffix to all your own snippets.
       Snippets are run in ascending order. By choosing a number which sorts between/after the existing
       snippet(s) you can ensure it runs at the desired time. E.g. if your snippet beeps on errors, name it
       15-errorbeep so that it sorts before 20-nobeep.
