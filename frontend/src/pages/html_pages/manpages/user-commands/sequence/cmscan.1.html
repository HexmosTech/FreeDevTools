       cmscan - search sequence(s) against a covariance model database

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>cmscan</b> <u>[options]</u> <u>&lt;cmdb&gt;</u> <u>&lt;seqfile&gt;</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>cmscan</b>  is  used  to  search  sequences  against  collections of covariance models.  For each sequence in
       <u>&lt;seqfile&gt;,</u> use that query sequence to search the target database of CMs  in  <u>&lt;cmdb&gt;,</u>  and  output  ranked
       lists of the CMs with the most significant matches to the sequence.

       The  <u>&lt;seqfile&gt;</u>  may  contain  more  than  one query sequence. It can be in FASTA format, or several other
       common sequence file formats (genbank, embl, and among others), or in alignment file formats  (stockholm,
       aligned fasta, and others). See the <u>--qformat</u> option for a complete list.

       The  <u>&lt;cmdb&gt;</u>  needs to be press'ed using <b>cmpress</b> before it can be searched with <b>cmscan.</b>  This creates four
       binary files, suffixed .i1{fimp}.  Additionally, <u>&lt;cmdb&gt;</u> must  have  been  calibrated  for  E-values  with
       <b>cmcalibrate</b> before being press'ed with <b>cmpress.</b>

       The  query  <u>&lt;seqfile&gt;</u>  may  be  '-' (a dash character), in which case the query sequences are read from a
       &lt;stdin&gt; pipe instead of from a file.  The <u>&lt;cmdb&gt;</u> cannot be read from a &lt;stdin&gt; stream, because  it  needs
       to have those four auxiliary binary files generated by <b>cmpress.</b>

       The  output  format  is  designed  to  be  human-readable,  but is often so voluminous that reading it is
       impractical, and parsing it is a pain. The <b>--tblout</b> option saves output in a simple tabular  format  that
       is  concise  and  easier to parse. The <b>--fmt</b> <u>2</u> option modifies the format of the tabular output by adding
       several fields, including markup of overlapping hits, as described in section  6  of  the  Infernal  user
       guide.  The <b>-o</b> option allows redirecting the main output, including throwing it away in /dev/null.

       <b>cmscan</b> reexamines the 5' and 3' termini of target sequences using specialized algorithms for detection of
       <u>truncated</u>  hits,  in  which part of the 5' and/or 3' end of the actual full length homologous sequence is
       missing in the target sequence file. These types of hits will be most common in sequence files consisting
       of unassembled sequencing reads. By default, any 5' truncated  hit  is  required  to  include  the  first
       residue  of  the  target  sequence  it derives from in <u>&lt;seqfile&gt;,</u> and any 3' truncated hit is required to
       include the final residue of the target sequence it derives from.  Any  5'  and  3'  truncated  hit  must
       include  the  first  and final residue of the target sequence it derives from. The <b>--anytrunc</b> option will
       relax the requirements for hit inclusion of sequence endpoints, and truncated hits are allowed  to  start
       and stop at any positions of target sequences.  Importantly though, with <b>--anytrunc,</b> hit E-values will be
       less  accurate  because  model calibration does not consider the possibility of truncated hits, so use it
       with caution.  The <b>--notrunc</b> option can be used to turn off  truncated  hit  detection.   <b>--notrunc</b>  will
       reduce  the running time of <b>cmscan,</b> most significantly for target <u>&lt;seqfile&gt;</u> files that include many short
       sequences.  Truncated hit detection is automatically turned  off  when  the  <b>--max,</b>  <b>--nohmm,</b>  <b>--qdb,</b>  or
       <b>--nonbanded</b> options are used because it relies on the use of an accelerated HMM banded alignment strategy
       that is turned off by any of those options.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-h</b>     Help; print a brief reminder of command line usage and all available options.

       <b>-g</b>     Turn  on  the  <u>glocal</u>  alignment  algorithm, global with respect to the query model and local with
              respect to the target database. By default, the local alignment algorithm is used which  is  local
              with  respect  to both the target sequence and the model. In local mode, the alignment to span two
              or more subsequences if necessary (e.g. if the structures of the query model and  target  sequence
              are only partially shared), allowing certain large insertions and deletions in the structure to be
              penalized  differently  than normal indels. Local mode performs better on empirical benchmarks and
              is significantly more sensitive for remote homology detection. Empirically, glocal searches return
              many fewer hits than local searches, so glocal may be desired for some applications.

       <b>-Z</b> <u>&lt;x&gt;</u> Calculate E-values as if the search space size was <u>&lt;x&gt;</u> megabases (Mb). Without  the  use  of  this
              option,  the search space size changes for each query sequence, it is defined as the length of the
              current query sequence times 2 (because both strands of the sequence will be searched)  times  the
              number of CMs in <u>&lt;cmdb&gt;.</u>

       <b>--devhelp</b>
              Print  help,  as with <b>-h</b> <b>,</b> but also include expert options that are not displayed with <b>-h</b> <b>.</b>  These
              expert options are not expected to be relevant for the vast majority  of  users  and  so  are  not
              described  in the manual page.  The only resources for understanding what they actually do are the
              brief one-line descriptions output when <b>--devhelp</b> is enabled, and the source code.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>CONTROLLING</b> <b>OUTPUT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-o</b> <u>&lt;f&gt;</u> Direct the main human-readable output to a file <u>&lt;f&gt;</u> instead of the default stdout.

       <b>--tblout</b> <u>&lt;f&gt;</u>
              Save a simple tabular (space-delimited) file summarizing the hits found, with one  data  line  per
              hit.  The format of this file is described in section 6 of the Infernal user guide.

       <b>--fmt</b> <u>&lt;n&gt;</u>
              specify  the  format  of  the  tabular  output  file specified with <b>--tblout</b> <u>&lt;f&gt;</u> be in format <u>&lt;n&gt;.</u>
              Possible values for <u>&lt;n&gt;</u> are 1 or 2. By default <u>&lt;n&gt;</u> is 1 when <b>--tblout</b> is used without <b>--fmt.</b>  With
              <b>--fmt</b> <u>2</u> nine additional fields are added to the tabular output file, most of which pertain to  the
              annotation  of  overlapping hits.  See section 6 the Infernal user guide for a description of both
              formats.

       <b>--acc</b>  Use accessions instead of names in the main output, where available for profiles and/or sequences.

       <b>--noali</b>
              Omit the alignment section from the main output. This can greatly reduce the output volume.

       <b>--notextw</b>
              Unlimit the length of each line in the main output. The default is a limit of 120  characters  per
              line,  which  helps in displaying the output cleanly on terminals and in editors, but can truncate
              target profile description lines.

       <b>--textw</b> <u>&lt;n&gt;</u>
              Set the main output's line length limit to <u>&lt;n&gt;</u> characters per line. The default is 120.

       <b>--verbose</b>
              Include extra search pipeline statistics in the main output, including filter survival  statistics
              for truncated hit detection and number of envelopes discarded due to matrix size overflows.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b> <b>CONTROLLING</b> <b>REPORTING</b> <b>THRESHOLDS</b></h4><pre>
       Reporting  thresholds control which hits are reported in output files (the main output and <u>--tblout)</u> Hits
       are ranked by statistical significance (E-value).  By default,  all  hits  with  an  E-value  &lt;=  10  are
       reported.   The following options allow you to change the default E-value reporting thresholds, or to use
       bit score thresholds instead.

       <b>-E</b> <u>&lt;x&gt;</u> In the per-target output, report target sequences with an E-value of &lt;= <u>&lt;x&gt;.</u>  The default is 10.0,
              meaning that on average, about 10 false positives will be reported per query, so you can  see  the
              top of the noise and decide for yourself if it's really noise.

       <b>-T</b> <u>&lt;x&gt;</u> Instead  of  thresholding per-CM output on E-value, report target sequences with a bit score of &gt;=
              <u>&lt;x&gt;.</u>

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>INCLUSION</b> <b>THRESHOLDS</b></h4><pre>
       Inclusion thresholds are stricter than reporting thresholds.  Inclusion thresholds control which hits are
       considered to be reliable enough to be included in a possible  subsequent  search  round,  or  marked  as
       significant ("!") as opposed to questionable ("?") in hit output.

       <b>--incE</b> <u>&lt;x&gt;</u>
              Use  an  E-value  of  &lt;= <u>&lt;x&gt;</u> as the hit inclusion threshold.  The default is 0.01, meaning that on
              average, about 1 false positive would be expected in  every  100  searches  with  different  query
              sequences.

       <b>--incT</b> <u>&lt;x&gt;</u>
              Instead  of  using E-values for setting the inclusion threshold, instead use a bit score of &gt;= <u>&lt;x&gt;</u>
              as the hit inclusion threshold.  By default this option is unset.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>MODEL-SPECIFIC</b> <b>SCORE</b> <b>THRESHOLDING</b></h4><pre>
       Curated CM databases may define specific bit score thresholds for each CM, superseding  any  thresholding
       based on statistical significance alone.

       To  use  these  options,  the  profile  must  contain  the appropriate (GA, TC, and/or NC) optional score
       threshold annotation; this  is  picked  up  by  <b>cmbuild</b>  from  Stockholm  format  alignment  files.  Each
       thresholding  option  has  a  score  of  <u>&lt;x&gt;</u>  bits,  and  acts  as  if <b>-T</b> <u>&lt;x&gt;</u> <b>--incT</b> <u>&lt;x&gt;</u> has been applied
       specifically using each model's curated thresholds.

       <b>--cut_ga</b>
              Use the GA (gathering) bit scores in the model to set hit reporting and inclusion  thresholds.  GA
              thresholds  are  generally  considered  to  be  the  reliable  curated  thresholds defining family
              membership; for example, in Rfam,  these  thresholds  define  what  gets  included  in  Rfam  Full
              alignments based on searches with Rfam Seed models.

       <b>--cut_nc</b>
              Use  the  NC  (noise  cutoff) bit score thresholds in the model to set hit reporting and inclusion
              thresholds. NC thresholds are generally considered to be the score of  the  highest-scoring  known
              false positive.

       <b>--cut_tc</b>
              Use  the  TC (trusted cutoff) bit score thresholds in the model to set hit reporting and inclusion
              thresholds. TC thresholds are generally considered to be the score  of  the  lowest-scoring  known
              true positive that is above all known false positives.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b> <b>CONTROLLING</b> <b>THE</b> <b>ACCELERATION</b> <b>PIPELINE</b></h4><pre>
       Infernal searches are accelerated in a six-stage filter pipeline. The first five stages use a profile HMM
       to  define  envelopes  that  are  passed  to  the stage six CM CYK filter. Any envelopes that survive all
       filters are assigned final scores using the the CM Inside algorithm.

       The profile HMM filter is built by the <b>cmbuild</b> program and is stored in <u>&lt;cmfile&gt;.</u>

       Each successive filter is slower than the previous one, but  better  than  it  at  disciminating  between
       subsequences  that  may  contain  high-scoring  CM hits and those that do not. The first three HMM filter
       stages are the same as those used in HMMER3.  Stage 1 (F1) is the local HMM SSV filter modified for  long
       sequences.  Stage  2  (F2) is the local HMM Viterbi filter. Stage 3 (F3) is the local HMM Forward filter.
       Each of the first three stages uses the profile HMM in local mode, which allows a target  subsequence  to
       align  to any region of the HMM. Stage 4 (F4) is a glocal HMM filter, which requires a target subsequence
       to align to the full-length profile HMM. Stage 5 (F5) is the glocal HMM envelope definition filter, which
       uses HMMER3's domain identification heursitics to define envelope boundaries. After each stage from 2  to
       5  a bias filter step (F2b, F3b, F4b, and F5b) is used to remove sequences that appear to have passed the
       filter due to biased composition alone. Any envelopes that survive stages F1 through F5b are then  passed
       with  the  local  CM CYK filter. The CYK filter uses constraints (bands) derived from an HMM alignment of
       the envelope to reduce the number of required calculations and save time.  Any envelopes  that  pass  CYK
       are scored with the local CM Inside algorithm, again using HMM bands for acceleration.

       The  default  filter  thresholds that define the minimum score required for a subsequence to survive each
       stage are defined based on the size of the search space (Z), which  is  defined  as  the  length  of  the
       current  query  sequence  times 2 (because both strands will be searched) times the number of profiles in
       <u>&lt;cmdb&gt;.</u>  However, if either the <b>-Z</b> <u>&lt;x&gt;</u> or <b>--FZ</b> <u>&lt;x&gt;</u> options  are  used  then  the  search  space  will  be
       considered to be <u>&lt;x&gt;</u> for purposes of defining the filter thresholds.

       For  larger databases, the filters are more strict leading to more acceleration but potentially a greater
       loss of sensitivity. The rationale is that for larger databases, hits must have higher scores to  achieve
       statistical  significance,  so  stricter  filtering  that  removes  lower  scoring  insignificant hits is
       acceptable.

       The P-value thresholds for all possible search space sizes and all filter stages are listed next.  (A  P-
       value  threshold  of  0.01  means  that  roughly  1% of the highest scoring nonhomologous subsequence are
       expected to pass the filter.) Z is defined as the number of nucleotides in the complete  target  sequence
       file times 2 because both strands will be searched with each model.

       If Z is less than 2 Mb: F1 is 0.35; F2 and F2b are off; F3, F3b, F4, F4b and F5 are 0.02; F6 is 0.0001.

       If  Z is between 2 Mb and 20 Mb: F1 is 0.35; F2 and F2b are off; F3, F3b, F4, F4b and F5 are 0.005; F6 is
       0.0001.

       If Z is between 20 Mb and 200 Mb: F1 is 0.35; F2 and F2b are 0.15; F3, F3b, F4, F4b and F5 are 0.003;  F6
       is 0.0001.

       If  Z  is  between  200  Mb  and 2 Gb: F1 is 0.15; F2 and F2b are 0.15; F3, F3b, F4, F4b, F5, and F5b are
       0.0008; and F6 is 0.0001.

       If Z is between 2 Gb and 20 Gb: F1 is 0.15; F2 and F2b are 0.15; F3,  F3b,  F4,  F4b,  F5,  and  F5b  are
       0.0002; and F6 is 0.0001.

       If  Z  is more than 20 Gb: F1 is 0.06; F2 and F2b are 0.02; F3, F3b, F4, F4b, F5, and F5b are 0.0002; and
       F6 is 0.0001.

       These thresholds were chosen based on  performance  on  an  internal  benchmark  testing  many  different
       possible settings.

       There  are  five  options  for  controlling the general filtering level. These options are, in order from
       least strict (slowest but most sensitive) to most strict (fastest but least sensitive):  <b>--max,</b>  <b>--nohmm,</b>
       <b>--mid,</b>  <b>--default,</b>  (this  is  the  default  setting)  <b>--rfam.</b>  and <b>--hmmonly.</b>  With <b>--default</b> the filter
       thresholds will be database-size dependent. See the explanation of each of these individual options below
       for more information.

       Additionally, an expert user can precisely control each filter  stage  score  threshold  with  the  <b>--F1,</b>
       <b>--F1b,</b>  <b>--F2,</b>  <b>--F2b,</b> <b>--F3,</b> <b>--F3b,</b> <b>--F4,</b> <b>--F4b,</b> <b>--F5,</b> <b>--F5b,</b> and <b>--F6</b> options. As well as turn each stage
       on or off with the <b>--noF1,</b> <b>--doF1b,</b> <b>--noF2,</b>  <b>--noF2b,</b>  <b>--noF3,</b>  <b>--noF3b,</b>  <b>--noF4,</b>  <b>--noF4b,</b>  <b>--noF5,</b>  and
       <b>--noF6.</b>  options.  These options are only displayed if the <b>--devhelp</b> option is used to keep the number of
       displayed options with <b>-h</b> reasonable, and because they are only expected to be useful to a small minority
       of users.

       As  a  special  case,  for any models in <u>&lt;cmfile&gt;</u> which have zero basepairs, profile HMM searches are run
       instead of CM searches. HMM algorithms are more efficient than CM  algorithms,  and  the  benefit  of  CM
       algorithms  is  lost  for models with no secondary structure (zero basepairs). These profile HMM searches
       will run significantly faster than the CM searches. You can force HMM-only searches  with  the  <b>--hmmonly</b>
       option. For more information on HMM-only searches see the user guide.

       <b>--max</b>  Turn  off  all  filters,  and  run  non-banded  Inside  on every full-length target sequence. This
              increases sensitivity somewhat, at an extremely large cost in speed.

       <b>--nohmm</b>
              Turn off all HMM filter stages (F1 through F5b). The CYK filter, using QDBs, will be run on  every
              full-length  target sequence and will enforce a P-value threshold of 0.0001. Each subsequence that
              survives CYK will be passed to Inside, which will also use QDBs (but a looser set). This increases
              sensitivity somewhat, at a very large cost in speed.

       <b>--mid</b>  Turn off the HMM SSV and Viterbi filter  stages  (F1  through  F2b).   Set  remaining  HMM  filter
              thresholds  (F3  through  F5b) to 0.02 by default, but changeable to <u>&lt;x&gt;</u> with <b>--Fmid</b> <u>&lt;x&gt;</u> sequence.
              This may increase sensitivity, at a significant cost in speed.

       <b>--default</b>
              Use the default filtering strategy. This option is  on  by  default.  The  filter  thresholds  are
              determined based on the database size.

       <b>--rfam</b> Use  a  strict  filtering  strategy  devised  for  large  databases  (more  than 20 Gb). This will
              accelerate the search at a potential cost to sensitivity.

       <b>--hmmonly</b>
              Only use the filter profile HMM for searches, do not use the CM.  Only filter stages F1 through F3
              will be executed, using strict P-value thresholds (0.02 for F1, 0.001 for F2 and 0.00001 for  F3).
              Additionally  a  bias  composition  filter  is  used  after  the  F1  stage  (with P=0.02 survival
              threshold).  Any hit that survives all stages and has an  HMM  E-value  or  bit  score  above  the
              reporting  threshold  will  be  output.   The  user  can change the HMM-only filter thresholds and
              options with <b>--hmmF1,</b> <b>--hmmF2,</b> <b>--hmmF3,</b> <b>--hmmnobias,</b>  <b>--hmmnonull2,</b>  and  <b>--hmmmax.</b>   By  default,
              searches  for  any model with zero basepairs will be run in HMM-only mode. This can be turned off,
              forcing CM searches for these models with the <b>--nohmmonly</b> option.

       <b>--FZ</b> <u>&lt;x&gt;</u>
              Set filter thresholds as the defaults used if the database were <b>&lt;x&gt;</b> megabases (Mb). If  used  with
              <b>&lt;x&gt;</b> greater than 20000 (20 Gb) this option has the same effect as <b>--rfam.</b>

       <b>--Fmid</b> <u>&lt;x&gt;</u>
              With  the  <b>--mid</b> option set the HMM filter thresholds (F3 through F5b) to <u>&lt;x&gt;.</u>  By default, <u>&lt;x&gt;</u> is
              0.02.

</pre><h4><b>OTHER</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--notrunc</b>
              Turn off truncated hit detection.

       <b>--anytrunc</b>
              Allow truncated hits to begin and end at any  position  in  a  target  sequence.  By  default,  5'
              truncated  hits must include the first residue of their target sequence and 3' truncated hits must
              include the final residue of their target sequence. With this option you may  observe  fewer  full
              length  hits  that extend to the beginning and end of the query CM. As of version 1.1.5, truncated
              hits that end at sequence terminii with a lower score penalty than internally truncated  hits  are
              also  considered  (these  were  not considered in 1.1x versions prior to 1.1.5).  To reproduce the
              behavior of this option from v1.1.4, use the <b>--inttrunc</b> option instead.

       <b>--nonull3</b>
              Turn off the null3 CM score corrections for biased composition. This correction is not used during
              the HMM filter stages.

       <b>--mxsize</b> <u>&lt;x&gt;</u>
              Set the maximum allowable CM DP matrix size to <u>&lt;x&gt;</u> megabytes. By default  this  size  is  128  Mb.
              This should be large enough for the vast majority of searches, especially with smaller models.  If
              <b>cmscan</b>  encounters  an  envelope  in  the  CYK  or Inside stage that requires a larger matrix, the
              envelope will be discounted from consideration. This behavior is like an  additional  filter  that
              prevents  expensive  (slow) CM DP calculations, but at a potential cost to sensitivity.  Note that
              if <b>cmscan</b> is being run in <u>&lt;n&gt;</u> multiple threads on a multicore machine then each thread may have an
              allocated matrix of up to size <u>&lt;x&gt;</u> Mb at any given time.

       <b>--smxsize</b> <u>&lt;x&gt;</u>
              Set the maximum allowable CM search DP matrix size to <u>&lt;x&gt;</u> megabytes. By default this size  is  128
              Mb.   This  option is only relevant if the CM will not use HMM banded matrices, i.e. if the <b>--max,</b>
              <b>--nohmm,</b> <b>--qdb,</b> <b>--fqdb,</b> <b>--nonbanded,</b> or <b>--fnonbanded</b> options are also used. Note that if  <b>cmsearch</b>
              is being run in <u>&lt;n&gt;</u> multiple threads on a multicore machine then each thread may have an allocated
              matrix of up to size <u>&lt;x&gt;</u> Mb at any given time.

       <b>--cyk</b>  Use the CYK algorithm, not Inside, to determine the final score of all hits.

       <b>--acyk</b> Use  the  CYK algorithm to align hits. By default, the Durbin/Holmes optimal accuracy algorithm is
              used, which finds the alignment that maximizes the expected accuracy of all aligned residues.

       <b>--wcx</b> <u>&lt;x&gt;</u>
              For each CM, set the W parameter, the expected maximum length of a hit, to <u>&lt;x&gt;</u> times the consensus
              length of the model. By default, the W parameter is read from the CM file and was calculated based
              on the transition probabilities of the model by <b>cmbuild.</b>  You can find out what the default  W  is
              for  a  model  using  <b>cmstat.</b>  This option should be used with caution as it impacts the filtering
              pipeline at several different stages in nonobvious ways. It is only recommended for  expert  users
              searching  for  hits  that  are  much  longer  than any of the homologs used to build the model in
              <b>cmbuild,</b> e.g. ones with large introns or other large insertions.  It cannot be used in combination
              with the <b>--nohmm,</b> <b>--fqdb</b> or <b>--qdb</b> options because in those cases W is limited  by  query-dependent
              bands.

       <b>--toponly</b>
              Only  search  the  top (Watson) strand of target sequences in <u>&lt;seqfile&gt;.</u>  By default, both strands
              are searched. This will halve the search space size (Z).

       <b>--bottomonly</b>
              Only search the bottom (Crick) strand of target sequences in <u>&lt;seqfile&gt;.</u>  By default, both  strands
              are searched. This will halve the search space size (Z).

       <b>--qformat</b> <u>&lt;s&gt;</u>
              Assert  that  the  query sequence database file is in format <u>&lt;s&gt;.</u>  Accepted formats include <u>fasta,</u>
              <u>embl,</u> <u>genbank,</u> <u>ddbj,</u> <u>stockholm,</u> <u>pfam,</u> <u>a2m,</u> <u>afa,</u> <u>clustal,</u> and <u>phylip</u> The default is  to  autodetect
              the format of the file.

       <b>--glist</b> <u>&lt;f&gt;</u>
              Configure a subset of models from <u>&lt;cmfile&gt;</u> in glocal alignment mode, instead of local mode, namely
              the  models  listed  in  file  <u>&lt;f&gt;.</u>  Configure all other models (those not listed in <u>&lt;f&gt;)</u> in local
              mode.  This option is incompatible with <u>-g.</u>  File  <u>&lt;f&gt;</u>  must  list  valid  names  of  models  from
              <u>&lt;cmfile&gt;,</u> each separated by any whitespace character (e.g. a newline character).

       <b>--clanin</b> <u>&lt;f&gt;</u>
              Read clan information on the models in <u>&lt;cmfile&gt;</u> from file <u>&lt;f&gt;.</u>  Not all models in <u>&lt;cmfile&gt;</u> need to
              be  a member of a clan.  This option must be used in combination with <b>--fmt</b> <u>2</u> and <b>--tblout</b> because
              clan annotation is only output in format 2 of the tabular output  file.   See  section  9  of  the
              Infernal user guide for specifications on the format of the clan input file <u>&lt;f&gt;.</u>

       <b>--oclan</b>
              Only  mark overlaps between models in the same clan.  This option must be used in combination with
              <b>--fmt</b> <u>2</u> , <b>--tblout</b> and <b>--clanin</b> because clan annotation is only output in format 2 of the  tabular
              output file, and clan information can only be input using the <b>--clanin</b> option.

       <b>--oskip</b>
              Omit  any hit h from the tabular output file that satisfies the following: another hit h2 overlaps
              with h and the E-value of h2 is lower than that of h, and h2 is itself not omitted. Hit h will not
              appear in the tabular output file, although it will still exist  in  the  standard  output.   This
              option must be used in combination with <b>--fmt</b> <u>2</u> <b>--tblout</b> because overlap annotation is only output
              in  format  2  of the tabular output file.  When used in combination with <b>--oclan</b> only hits h that
              satisfy the following are omitted: another hit h2 overlaps with h, the E-value of h2 is lower than
              that of h, and both h and h2 are hits to models that are in the same clan.

       <b>--cpu</b> <u>&lt;n&gt;</u>
              Set the number of parallel worker threads to <u>&lt;n&gt;</u>.  On multicore machines, the default is  4.   You
              can  also  control this number by setting an environment variable, <u>INFERNAL_NCPU</u>.  There is also a
              master thread, so the actual number of threads that Infernal spawns is <u>&lt;n&gt;</u>+1.  This option is  not
              available if Infernal was compiled with POSIX threads support turned off.

       <b>--stall</b>
              For  debugging the MPI master/worker version: pause after start, to enable the developer to attach
              debuggers to the running master and worker(s) processes. Send SIGCONT signal to release the pause.
              (Under gdb: <u>(gdb)</u> <u>signal</u> <u>SIGCONT)</u> (Only available if optional MPI support was enabled at  compile-
              time.)

       <b>--mpi</b>  Run  in MPI master/worker mode, using <u>mpirun.</u>  (Only available if optional MPI support was enabled
              at compile-time.)
