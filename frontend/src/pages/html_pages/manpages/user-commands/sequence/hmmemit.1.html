</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       hmmemit - sample sequences from a profile

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>hmmemit</b> [<u>options</u>] <u>hmmfile</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>hmmemit</b>  program  samples  (emits)  sequences from the profile HMM(s) in <u>hmmfile</u>, and writes them to
       output.  Sampling sequences may be useful for a variety of purposes, including  creating  synthetic  true
       positives for benchmarks or tests.

       The  default  is  to sample one unaligned sequence from the core probability model, which means that each
       sequence consists of one full-length domain.  Alternatively, with the <b>-c</b> option, you can  emit  a  simple
       majority-rule  consensus  sequence;  or with the <b>-a</b> option, you can emit an alignment (in which case, you
       probably also want to set <b>-N</b> to something other than its default of 1 sequence per model).

       As another option, with the <b>-p</b> option you can sample a sequence from  a  fully  configured  HMMER  search
       profile.  This  means  sampling  a  `homologous  sequence' by HMMER's definition, including nonhomologous
       flanking sequences, local alignments, and multiple domains per sequence, depending on  the  length  model
       and alignment mode chosen for the profile.

       The <u>hmmfile</u> may contain a library of HMMs, in which case each HMM will be used in turn.

       <u>hmmfile</u> may be '-' (dash), which means reading this input from stdin rather than a file.

</pre><h4><b>COMMON</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-h</b>     Help; print a brief reminder of command line usage and all available options.

       <b>-o</b> <u>&lt;f&gt;</u> Direct the output sequences to file <u>&lt;f&gt;</u>, rather than to stdout.

       <b>-N</b> <u>&lt;n&gt;</u> Sample <u>&lt;n&gt;</u> sequences per model, rather than just one.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b> <b>CONTROLLING</b> <b>WHAT</b> <b>TO</b> <b>EMIT</b></h4><pre>
       The  default  is  to  sample <b>N</b> sequences from the core model. Alternatively, you may choose one (and only
       one) of the following alternatives.

       <b>-a</b>     Emit an alignment for each HMM in the <u>hmmfile</u> rather than sampling unaligned sequences  one  at  a
              time.

       <b>-c</b>     Emit  a  plurality-rule  consensus sequence, instead of sampling a sequence from the profile HMM's
              probability distribution. The consensus sequence is formed by selecting  the  maximum  probability
              residue at each match state.

       <b>-C</b>     Emit  a  fancier  plurality-rule consensus sequence than the <b>-c</b> option. If the maximum probability
              residue has p &lt; <b>minl</b> show it as a lower case 'any' residue (n or x); if p &gt;= <b>minl</b> and &lt; <b>minu</b>  show
              it  as  a  lower  case  residue;  and  if p &gt;= <b>minu</b> show it as an upper case residue.  The default
              settings of <b>minu</b> and <b>minl</b> are both 0.0, which means <b>-C</b> gives the same output as <b>-c</b> unless you also
              set <b>minu</b> and <b>minl</b> to what you want.

       <b>-p</b>     Sample unaligned sequences from the implicit search profile, not from the core  model.   The  core
              model  consists  only  of the homologous states (between the begin and end states of a HMMER Plan7
              model). The profile includes the nonhomologous N, C, and J states, local/glocal  and  uni/multihit
              algorithm  configuration, and the target length model.  Therefore sequences sampled from a profile
              may include nonhomologous as  well  as  homologous  sequences,  and  may  contain  more  than  one
              homologous  sequence  segment.  By  default, the profile is in multihit local mode, and the target
              sequence length is configured for L=400.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b> <b>CONTROLLING</b> <b>EMISSION</b> <b>FROM</b> <b>PROFILES</b></h4><pre>
       These options require that you have set the <b>-p</b> option.

       <b>-L</b> <u>&lt;n&gt;</u> Configure the profile's target sequence length model to generate a mean  length  of  approximately
              &lt;n&gt; rather than the default of 400.

       <b>--local</b>
              Configure the profile for multihit local alignment.

       <b>--unilocal</b>
              Configure the profile for unihit local alignment (Smith/Waterman).

       <b>--glocal</b>
              Configure the profile for multihit glocal alignment.

       <b>--uniglocal</b>
              Configure the profile for unihit glocal alignment.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b> <b>CONTROLLING</b> <b>FANCY</b> <b>CONSENSUS</b> <b>EMISSION</b></h4><pre>
       These options require that you have set the <b>-C</b> option.

       <b>--minl</b> <u>&lt;x&gt;</u>
              Sets the <b>minl</b> threshold for showing weakly conserved residues as lower case.  (0 &lt;= x &lt;= 1)

       <b>--minu</b> <u>&lt;x&gt;</u>
              Sets the <b>minu</b> threshold for showing strongly conserved residues as upper case.  (0 &lt;= x &lt;= 1)

</pre><h4><b>OTHER</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--seed</b> <u>&lt;n&gt;</u>
              Seed  the  random  number  generator with <u>&lt;n&gt;</u>, an integer &gt;= 0.  If <u>&lt;n&gt;</u> is nonzero, any stochastic
              simulations will be reproducible; the same command will give the same results.  If <u>&lt;n&gt;</u> is  0,  the
              random  number  generator  is seeded arbitrarily, and stochastic simulations will vary from run to
              run of the same command.  The default is 0: use an arbitrary seed, so different <b>hmmemit</b> runs  will
              generate different samples.
