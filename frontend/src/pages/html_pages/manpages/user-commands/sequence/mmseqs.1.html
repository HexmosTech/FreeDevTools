</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       MMseqs2  -  MMseqs2  (Many against Many sequence searching): fast, parallelized protein sequence searches
       and clustering of huge protein sequence data sets.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>mmseqs</b> <u>&lt;module&gt;</u> <u>args</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       MMseqs2  (Many-against-Many  sequence  searching)  is  a  software  suite  to  search  and  cluster  huge
       proteins/nucleotide  sequence  sets.  MMseqs2 is open source GPL-licensed software implemented in C++ for
       Linux, MacOS, and (as beta version, via cygwin) Windows. The software is  designed  to  run  on  multiple
       cores  and servers and exhibits very good scalability. MMseqs2 can run 10000 times faster than BLAST.  At
       100 times its speed it achieves almost the same sensitivity. It can perform  profile  searches  with  the
       same sensitivity as PSI-BLAST at over 400 times its speed.

       The following depicts the different <u>&lt;module&gt;</u> that can be used.

       Easy workflows (for non-experts)

       An example for running a command using easy-* modules would be <b>mmseqs</b> easy-search <u>&lt;DB&gt;</u> <u>&lt;targetDB&gt;</u>

       easy-search
              Search  with a query fasta against target fasta (or database) and return a BLAST-compatible result
              in a single step

       easy-linsearch
              Linear time  search  with  a  query  fasta  against  target  fasta  (or  database)  and  return  a
              BLAST-compatible result in a single step

       easy-linclust
              Compute   clustering  of  a  fasta/fastq  database  in  linear  time.  The  workflow  outputs  the
              representative sequences, a cluster tsv and a fasta-like format containing all sequences.

       easy-cluster
              Compute clustering of a fasta database. The  workflow  outputs  the  representative  sequences,  a
              cluster tsv and a fasta-like format containing all sequences.

       easy-taxonomy
              Compute  taxonomy  and  lowest common ancestor for each sequence. The workflow outputs a taxonomic
              classification for sequences and a hierarchical summery report.
