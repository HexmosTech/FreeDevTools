</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       phmmer - search protein sequence(s) against a protein sequence database

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>phmmer</b> [<u>options</u>] <u>seqfile</u> <u>seqdb</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>phmmer</b>  is  used  to search one or more query protein sequences against a protein sequence database.  For
       each query sequence in <u>seqfile</u>, use that sequence to search the target database of  sequences  in  <u>seqdb</u>,
       and output ranked lists of the sequences with the most significant matches to the query.

       Either  the  query  <u>seqfile</u>  or  the  target <u>seqdb</u> may be '-' (a dash character), in which case the query
       sequences or target database input will be read from a &lt;stdin&gt; pipe instead of  from  a  file.  Only  one
       input  source can come through &lt;stdin&gt;, not both.  An exception is that if the <u>seqfile</u> contains more than
       one query sequence, then <u>seqdb</u> cannot come from &lt;stdin&gt;, because we can't  rewind  the  streaming  target
       database to search it with another query.

       The  output  format  is  designed  to  be  human-readable,  but is often so voluminous that reading it is
       impractical, and parsing it is a pain. The <b>--tblout</b> and <b>--domtblout</b> options save output in simple tabular
       formats that are concise and easier to  parse.   The  <b>-o</b>  option  allows  redirecting  the  main  output,
       including throwing it away in /dev/null.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-h</b>     Help; print a brief reminder of command line usage and all available options.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>CONTROLLING</b> <b>OUTPUT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-o</b> <u>&lt;f&gt;</u> Direct the main human-readable output to a file <u>&lt;f&gt;</u> instead of the default stdout.

       <b>-A</b> <u>&lt;f&gt;</u> Save  a  multiple alignment of all significant hits (those satisfying inclusion thresholds) to the
              file <u>&lt;f&gt;</u> in Stockholm format.

       <b>--tblout</b> <u>&lt;f&gt;</u>
              Save a simple tabular (space-delimited) file summarizing the per-target output, with one data line
              per homologous target sequence found.

       <b>--domtblout</b> <u>&lt;f&gt;</u>
              Save a simple tabular (space-delimited) file summarizing the per-domain output, with one data line
              per homologous domain detected in a query sequence for each homologous model.

       <b>--acc</b>  Use accessions instead of names in the main output, where available for profiles and/or sequences.

       <b>--noali</b>
              Omit the alignment section from the main output. This can greatly reduce the output volume.

       <b>--notextw</b>
              Unlimit the length of each line in the main output. The default is a limit of 120  characters  per
              line,  which  helps in displaying the output cleanly on terminals and in editors, but can truncate
              target profile description lines.

       <b>--textw</b> <u>&lt;n&gt;</u>
              Set the main output's line length limit to <u>&lt;n&gt;</u> characters per line. The default is 120.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b> <b>CONTROLLING</b> <b>SCORING</b> <b>SYSTEM</b></h4><pre>
       The probability model in <b>phmmer</b> is constructed by inferring residue probabilities from a  standard  20x20
       substitution  score  matrix,  plus  two  additional  parameters for position-independent gap open and gap
       extend probabilities.

       <b>--popen</b> <u>&lt;x&gt;</u>
              Set the gap open probability for a single sequence query model to <u>&lt;x&gt;</u>.  The default is 0.02.   <u>&lt;x&gt;</u>
              must be &gt;= 0 and &lt; 0.5.

       <b>--pextend</b> <u>&lt;x&gt;</u>
              Set the gap extend probability for a single sequence query model to <u>&lt;x&gt;</u>.  The default is 0.4.  <u>&lt;x&gt;</u>
              must be &gt;= 0 and &lt; 1.0.

       <b>--mx</b> <u>&lt;s&gt;</u>
              Obtain  residue  alignment probabilities from the built-in substitution matrix named <u>&lt;s&gt;</u>.  Several
              standard matrices are built-in, and do not need to be read from files.  The matrix name <u>&lt;s&gt;</u> can be
              PAM30, PAM70, PAM120, PAM240, BLOSUM45, BLOSUM50, BLOSUM62, BLOSUM80, or BLOSUM90.   Only  one  of
              the <b>--mx</b> and <b>--mxfile</b> options may be used.

       <b>--mxfile</b> <u>mxfile</u>
              Obtain  residue  alignment probabilities from the substitution matrix in file <u>mxfile</u>.  The default
              score matrix is BLOSUM62 (this matrix is internal to HMMER and does not have to be available as  a
              file).   The  format  of  a  substitution  matrix <u>mxfile</u> is the standard format accepted by BLAST,
              FASTA, and other sequence analysis software.  See ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/matrices/ for example
              files. (The only exception: we require matrices to be square, so for DNA, use  files  like  NCBI's
              NUC.4.4, not NUC.4.2.)

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b> <b>CONTROLLING</b> <b>REPORTING</b> <b>THRESHOLDS</b></h4><pre>
       Reporting  thresholds  control  which  hits  are reported in output files (the main output, <b>--tblout</b>, and
       <b>--domtblout</b>).  Sequence hits and domain hits are ranked by statistical significance (E-value) and  output
       is  generated  in two sections called per-target and per-domain output. In per-target output, by default,
       all sequence hits with an E-value &lt;= 10 are reported. In the per-domain output, for each target that  has
       passed  per-target  reporting  thresholds,  all  domains  satisfying  per-domain reporting thresholds are
       reported. By default, these are domains with conditional E-values of &lt;= 10. The following  options  allow
       you to change the default E-value reporting thresholds, or to use bit score thresholds instead.

       <b>-E</b> <u>&lt;x&gt;</u> In the per-target output, report target sequences with an E-value of &lt;= <u>&lt;x&gt;</u>.  The default is 10.0,
              meaning  that  on average, about 10 false positives will be reported per query, so you can see the
              top of the noise and decide for yourself if it's really noise.

       <b>-T</b> <u>&lt;x&gt;</u> Instead of thresholding per-profile output on E-value, instead report target sequences with a  bit
              score of &gt;= <u>&lt;x&gt;</u>.

       <b>--domE</b> <u>&lt;x&gt;</u>
              In  the  per-domain  output,  for  target  sequences  that  have already satisfied the per-profile
              reporting threshold, report individual domains with a conditional E-value of &lt;= <u>&lt;x&gt;</u>.  The  default
              is  10.0.  A conditional E-value means the expected number of additional false positive domains in
              the smaller search space of those comparisons that  already  satisfied  the  per-target  reporting
              threshold (and thus must have at least one homologous domain already).

       <b>--domT</b> <u>&lt;x&gt;</u>
              Instead  of  thresholding per-domain output on E-value, instead report domains with a bit score of
              &gt;= <u>&lt;x&gt;</u>.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b> <b>CONTROLLING</b> <b>INCLUSION</b> <b>THRESHOLDS</b></h4><pre>
       Inclusion thresholds are stricter than reporting thresholds. They control which hits are included in  any
       output multiple alignment (the <b>-A</b> option) and which domains are marked as significant ("!") as opposed to
       questionable ("?")  in domain output.

       <b>--incE</b> <u>&lt;x&gt;</u>
              Use an E-value of &lt;= <u>&lt;x&gt;</u> as the per-target inclusion threshold.  The default is 0.01, meaning that
              on  average,  about  1 false positive would be expected in every 100 searches with different query
              sequences.

       <b>--incT</b> <u>&lt;x&gt;</u>
              Instead of using E-values for setting the inclusion threshold, instead use a bit score of  &gt;=  <u>&lt;x&gt;</u>
              as the per-target inclusion threshold.  By default this option is unset.

       <b>--incdomE</b> <u>&lt;x&gt;</u>
              Use  a  conditional  E-value of &lt;= <u>&lt;x&gt;</u> as the per-domain inclusion threshold, in targets that have
              already satisfied the overall per-target inclusion threshold.  The default is 0.01.

       <b>--incdomT</b> <u>&lt;x&gt;</u>
              Instead of using E-values, use a bit score of &gt;= <u>&lt;x&gt;</u> as the per-domain  inclusion  threshold.   By
              default this option is unset.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b> <b>CONTROLLING</b> <b>THE</b> <b>ACCELERATION</b> <b>PIPELINE</b></h4><pre>
       HMMER3  searches are accelerated in a three-step filter pipeline: the MSV filter, the Viterbi filter, and
       the Forward filter. The first filter is the fastest and most approximate; the last is  the  full  Forward
       scoring  algorithm,  slowest but most accurate. There is also a bias filter step between MSV and Viterbi.
       Targets that pass all the steps in the acceleration pipeline are  then  subjected  to  postprocessing  --
       domain identification and scoring using the Forward/Backward algorithm.

       Essentially  the  only  free parameters that control HMMER's heuristic filters are the P-value thresholds
       controlling the expected fraction of nonhomologous sequences that pass the filters. Setting  the  default
       thresholds  higher will pass a higher proportion of nonhomologous sequence, increasing sensitivity at the
       expense of speed; conversely, setting lower P-value thresholds will pass a smaller proportion, decreasing
       sensitivity and increasing speed. Setting a filter's P-value threshold to 1.0 means it will  passing  all
       sequences, and effectively disables the filter.

       Changing  filter  thresholds  only  removes  or  includes  targets  from  consideration;  changing filter
       thresholds does not alter bit scores, E-values, or alignments, all of  which  are  determined  solely  in
       postprocessing.

       <b>--max</b>  Maximum   sensitivity.    Turn   off  all  filters,  including  the  bias  filter,  and  run  full
              Forward/Backward postprocessing on every target. This increases sensitivity slightly, at  a  large
              cost in speed.

       <b>--F1</b> <u>&lt;x&gt;</u>
              First  filter  threshold; set the P-value threshold for the MSV filter step.  The default is 0.02,
              meaning that roughly 2% of the highest scoring nonhomologous targets  are  expected  to  pass  the
              filter.

       <b>--F2</b> <u>&lt;x&gt;</u>
              Second  filter  threshold;  set the P-value threshold for the Viterbi filter step.  The default is
              0.001.

       <b>--F3</b> <u>&lt;x&gt;</u>
              Third filter threshold; set the P-value threshold for the Forward filter  step.   The  default  is
              1e-5.

       <b>--nobias</b>
              Turn  off  the  bias  filter.  This increases sensitivity somewhat, but can come at a high cost in
              speed, especially if the query has biased residue  composition  (such  as  a  repetitive  sequence
              region,  or  if  it  is a membrane protein with large regions of hydrophobicity). Without the bias
              filter, too many sequences may pass the  filter  with  biased  queries,  leading  to  slower  than
              expected  performance  as  the  computationally  intensive Forward/Backward algorithms shoulder an
              abnormally heavy load.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b> <b>CONTROLLING</b> <b>E-VALUE</b> <b>CALIBRATION</b></h4><pre>
       Estimating the location parameters for the expected score distributions for MSV  filter  scores,  Viterbi
       filter scores, and Forward scores requires three short random sequence simulations.

       <b>--EmL</b> <u>&lt;n&gt;</u>
              Sets  the sequence length in simulation that estimates the location parameter mu for MSV filter E-
              values. Default is 200.

       <b>--EmN</b> <u>&lt;n&gt;</u>
              Sets the number of sequences in simulation that estimates the location parameter mu for MSV filter
              E-values. Default is 200.

       <b>--EvL</b> <u>&lt;n&gt;</u>
              Sets the sequence length in simulation that estimates the location parameter mu for Viterbi filter
              E-values. Default is 200.

       <b>--EvN</b> <u>&lt;n&gt;</u>
              Sets the number of sequences in simulation that estimates the location parameter  mu  for  Viterbi
              filter E-values. Default is 200.

       <b>--EfL</b> <u>&lt;n&gt;</u>
              Sets  the  sequence  length in simulation that estimates the location parameter tau for Forward E-
              values. Default is 100.

       <b>--EfN</b> <u>&lt;n&gt;</u>
              Sets the number of sequences in simulation that estimates the location parameter tau  for  Forward
              E-values. Default is 200.

       <b>--Eft</b> <u>&lt;x&gt;</u>
              Sets the tail mass fraction to fit in the simulation that estimates the location parameter tau for
              Forward evalues. Default is 0.04.

</pre><h4><b>OTHER</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--nonull2</b>
              Turn off the null2 score corrections for biased composition.

       <b>-Z</b> <u>&lt;x&gt;</u> Assert  that the total number of targets in your searches is <u>&lt;x&gt;</u>, for the purposes of per-sequence
              E-value calculations, rather than the actual number of targets seen.

       <b>--domZ</b> <u>&lt;x&gt;</u>
              Assert that the total number of targets in your searches is <u>&lt;x&gt;</u>, for the  purposes  of  per-domain
              conditional  E-value  calculations,  rather  than  the number of targets that passed the reporting
              thresholds.

       <b>--seed</b> <u>&lt;n&gt;</u>
              Seed the random number generator with <u>&lt;n&gt;</u>, an  integer  &gt;=  0.   If  <u>&lt;n&gt;</u>  is  &gt;0,  any  stochastic
              simulations  will  be reproducible; the same command will give the same results.  If <u>&lt;n&gt;</u> is 0, the
              random number generator is seeded arbitrarily, and stochastic simulations will vary  from  run  to
              run of the same command.  The default seed is 42.

       <b>--qformat</b> <u>&lt;s&gt;</u>
              Assert  that  input  <u>seqfile</u> is in format <u>&lt;s&gt;</u>, bypassing format autodetection.  Common choices for
              <u>&lt;s&gt;</u> include:  <b>fasta</b>,  <b>embl</b>,  <b>genbank.</b>   Alignment  formats  also  work;  common  choices  include:
              <b>stockholm</b>,  <b>a2m</b>,  <b>afa</b>,  <b>psiblast</b>,  <b>clustal</b>, <b>phylip</b>.  <b>phmmer</b> always uses a single sequence query to
              start its search, so when the input <u>seqfile</u> is an alignment, <b>phmmer</b> reads it one  unaligned  query
              sequence at a time, not as an alignment.  For more information, and for codes for some less common
              formats, see main documentation.  The string <u>&lt;s&gt;</u> is case-insensitive (<b>fasta</b> or <b>FASTA</b> both work).

              <b>--tformat</b>  <u>&lt;s&gt;</u>  Assert  that  target  sequence  database  <u>seqdb</u> is in format <u>&lt;s&gt;</u>, bypassing format
              autodetection.  See <b>--qformat</b> above for list of accepted format codes for <u>&lt;s&gt;</u>.

       <b>--cpu</b> <u>&lt;n&gt;</u>
              Set the number of parallel worker threads to <u>&lt;n&gt;</u>.  On multicore machines, the default is  2.   You
              can  also  control  this  number  by setting an environment variable, <u>HMMER_NCPU</u>.  There is also a
              master thread, so the actual number of threads that HMMER spawns is <u>&lt;n&gt;</u>+1.

              This option is not available if HMMER was compiled with POSIX threads support turned off.

       <b>--stall</b>
              For debugging the MPI master/worker version: pause after start, to enable the developer to  attach
              debuggers to the running master and worker(s) processes. Send SIGCONT signal to release the pause.
              (Under  gdb: <b>(gdb)</b> <b>signal</b> <b>SIGCONT</b>) (Only available if optional MPI support was enabled at compile-
              time.)

       <b>--mpi</b>  Run  under  MPI  control  with  master/worker  parallelization  (using  <b>mpirun</b>,  for  example,  or
              equivalent). Only available if optional MPI support was enabled at compile-time.
