</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       nhmmscan - search DNA sequence(s) against a DNA profile database

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>nhmmscan</b> [<u>options</u>] <u>hmmdb</u> <u>seqfile</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>nhmmscan</b>  is  used  to  search  nucleotide sequences against collections of nucleotide profiles. For each
       sequence in <u>seqfile</u>, use that query sequence to search the target database  of  profiles  in  <u>hmmdb</u>,  and
       output ranked lists of the profiles with the most significant matches to the sequence.

       The  <u>seqfile</u> may contain more than one query sequence. It can be in FASTA format, or several other common
       sequence file formats  (genbank,  embl,  and  uniprot,  among  others),  or  in  alignment  file  formats
       (stockholm, aligned fasta, and others). See the <u>--qformat</u> option for a complete list.

       The <u>hmmdb</u> needs to be press'ed using <b>hmmpress</b> before it can be searched with <b>nhmmscan</b>.  This creates four
       binary files, suffixed <b>.h3{fimp}.</b>

       The  query <u>seqfile</u> may be '-' (a dash character), in which case the query sequences are read from a stdin
       pipe instead of from a file.  The <u>hmmdb</u> cannot be read from a stdin stream, because it needs to have  the
       four auxiliary binary files generated by <b>hmmpress</b>.

       The  output  format  is  designed  to  be  human-readable,  but is often so voluminous that reading it is
       impractical, and parsing it is a pain. The <b>--tblout</b> option saves output in a simple tabular  format  that
       is  concise and easier to parse.  The <b>-o</b> option allows redirecting the main output, including throwing it
       away in /dev/null.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-h</b>     Help; print a brief reminder of command line usage and all available options.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>CONTROLLING</b> <b>OUTPUT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-o</b> <u>&lt;f&gt;</u> Direct the main human-readable output to a file <u>&lt;f&gt;</u> instead of the default stdout.

       <b>--tblout</b> <u>&lt;f&gt;</u>
              Save a simple tabular (space-delimited) file summarizing the per-hit output, with  one  data  line
              per homologous target model hit found.

       <b>--dfamtblout</b> <u>&lt;f&gt;</u>
              Save a tabular (space-delimited) file summarizing the per-hit output, similar to <b>--tblout</b> but more
              succinct.

       <b>--aliscoresout</b> <u>&lt;f&gt;</u>
              Save  to  file  a  list  of  per-position  scores  for  each hit.  This is useful, for example, in
              identifying regions of high score density for use in resolving  overlapping  hits  from  different
              models.

       <b>--acc</b>  Use accessions instead of names in the main output, where available for profiles and/or sequences.

       <b>--noali</b>
              Omit the alignment section from the main output. This can greatly reduce the output volume.

       <b>--notextw</b>
              Unlimit  the  length of each line in the main output. The default is a limit of 120 characters per
              line, which helps in displaying the output cleanly on terminals and in editors, but  can  truncate
              target profile description lines.

       <b>--textw</b> <u>&lt;n&gt;</u>
              Set the main output's line length limit to <u>&lt;n&gt;</u> characters per line. The default is 120.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>REPORTING</b> <b>THRESHOLDS</b></h4><pre>
       Reporting  thresholds  control  which  hits  are reported in output files (the main output, <b>--tblout</b>, and
       <b>--dfamtblout</b>).  Hits are ranked by statistical significance (E-value).

       <b>-E</b> <u>&lt;x&gt;</u> Report target profiles with an E-value of &lt;= <u>&lt;x&gt;</u>.  The default is 10.0, meaning that  on  average,
              about  10  false  positives  will  be  reported per query, so you can see the top of the noise and
              decide for yourself if it's really noise.

       <b>-T</b> <u>&lt;x&gt;</u> Instead of thresholding output on E-value, instead report target profiles with a bit score  of  &gt;=
              <u>&lt;x&gt;</u>.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>INCLUSION</b> <b>THRESHOLDS</b></h4><pre>
       Inclusion thresholds are stricter than reporting thresholds.  Inclusion thresholds control which hits are
       considered  to be reliable enough to be included in an output alignment or a subsequent search round.  In
       <b>nhmmscan</b>, which does not have any alignment  output  (like  <b>nhmmer</b>),  inclusion  thresholds  have  little
       effect. They only affect what hits get marked as significant (!) or questionable (?) in hit output.

       <b>--incE</b> <u>&lt;x&gt;</u>
              Use  an  E-value  of  &lt;=  <u>&lt;x&gt;</u>  as  the  inclusion threshold.  The default is 0.01, meaning that on
              average, about 1 false positive would be expected in  every  100  searches  with  different  query
              sequences.

       <b>--incT</b> <u>&lt;x&gt;</u>
              Instead  of  using  E-values for setting the inclusion threshold, use a bit score of &gt;= <u>&lt;x&gt;</u> as the
              inclusion threshold.  It would be unusual to use bit score thresholds with  <b>hmmscan</b>,  because  you
              don't  expect  a  single  score  threshold to work for different profiles; different profiles have
              slightly different expected score distributions.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>MODEL-SPECIFIC</b> <b>SCORE</b> <b>THRESHOLDING</b></h4><pre>
       Curated profile databases may define specific bit score thresholds  for  each  profile,  superseding  any
       thresholding based on statistical significance alone.

       To  use  these  options,  the  profile  must  contain  the appropriate (GA, TC, and/or NC) optional score
       threshold annotation; this is picked up  by  <b>hmmbuild</b>  from  Stockholm  format  alignment  files.  For  a
       nucleotide  model,  each  thresholding  option  has a single per-hit threshold &lt;x&gt; This acts as if <b>-T</b> <u>&lt;x&gt;</u>
       <b>--incT</b> <u>&lt;x&gt;</u> has been applied specifically using each model's curated thresholds.

       <b>--cut_ga</b>
              Use the GA (gathering) bit score threshold in the model to set  per-hit  reporting  and  inclusion
              thresholds.  GA thresholds are generally considered to be the reliable curated thresholds defining
              family membership; for example, in Dfam, these thresholds are applied  when  annotating  a  genome
              with  a  model of a family known to be found in that organism. They may allow for minimal expected
              false discovery rate.

       <b>--cut_nc</b>
              Use the NC (noise cutoff) bit score threshold in the model to set per-hit reporting and  inclusion
              thresholds.  NC  thresholds are less stringent than GA; in the context of Pfam, they are generally
              used to store the score of the highest-scoring known false positive.

       <b>--cut_tc</b>
              Use the TC (trusted cutoff) bit score  threshold  in  the  model  to  set  per-hit  reporting  and
              inclusion thresholds. TC thresholds are more stringent than GA, and are generally considered to be
              the  score  of the lowest-scoring known true positive that is above all known false positives; for
              example, in Dfam, these thresholds are applied when annotating a genome with a model of  a  family
              not known to be found in that organism.

</pre><h4><b>CONTROL</b> <b>OF</b> <b>THE</b> <b>ACCELERATION</b> <b>PIPELINE</b></h4><pre>
       HMMER3  searches  are  accelerated  in a three-step filter pipeline: the scanning-SSV filter, the Viterbi
       filter, and the Forward filter. The first filter is the fastest and most approximate;  the  last  is  the
       full  Forward  scoring  algorithm. There is also a bias filter step between SSV and Viterbi. Targets that
       pass all the steps  in  the  acceleration  pipeline  are  then  subjected  to  postprocessing  --  domain
       identification and scoring using the Forward/Backward algorithm.

       Changing  filter  thresholds  only  removes  or  includes  targets  from  consideration;  changing filter
       thresholds does not alter bit scores, E-values, or alignments, all of  which  are  determined  solely  in
       postprocessing.

       <b>--max</b>  Turn  off  (nearly)  all  filters,  including  the  bias  filter,  and  run  full Forward/Backward
              postprocessing on most of the target sequence.  In contrast to <b>hmmscan,</b>  where  this  flag  really
              does  turn  off  the  filters  entirely,  the  <b>--max</b> flag in <b>nhmmscan</b> sets the scanning-SSV filter
              threshold to 0.4, not 1.0. Use of this flag increases sensitivity somewhat, at  a  large  cost  in
              speed.

       <b>--F1</b> <u>&lt;x&gt;</u>
              Set  the  P-value threshold for the MSV filter step.  The default is 0.02, meaning that roughly 2%
              of the highest scoring nonhomologous targets are expected to pass the filter.

       <b>--F2</b> <u>&lt;x&gt;</u>
              Set the P-value threshold for the Viterbi filter step.  The default is 0.001.

       <b>--F3</b> <u>&lt;x&gt;</u>
              Set the P-value threshold for the Forward filter step.  The default is 1e-5.

       <b>--nobias</b>
              Turn off the bias filter. This increases sensitivity somewhat, but can come  at  a  high  cost  in
              speed,  especially  if  the  query  has  biased residue composition (such as a repetitive sequence
              region, or if it is a membrane protein with large regions of  hydrophobicity).  Without  the  bias
              filter,  too  many  sequences  may  pass  the  filter  with biased queries, leading to slower than
              expected performance as the computationally  intensive  Forward/Backward  algorithms  shoulder  an
              abnormally heavy load.

</pre><h4><b>OTHER</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--nonull2</b>
              Turn off the null2 score corrections for biased composition.

       <b>-Z</b> <u>&lt;x&gt;</u> Assert  that the total number of targets in your searches is <u>&lt;x&gt;</u>, for the purposes of per-sequence
              E-value calculations, rather than the actual number of targets seen.

       <b>--seed</b> <u>&lt;n&gt;</u>
              Set the random number seed to <u>&lt;n&gt;</u>.  Some steps in postprocessing require Monte  Carlo  simulation.
              The  default  is  to  use  a  fixed seed (42), so that results are exactly reproducible. Any other
              positive integer will give different (but also reproducible)  results.  A  choice  of  0  uses  an
              arbitrarily chosen seed.

       <b>--qformat</b> <u>&lt;s&gt;</u>
              Assert  that input query <u>seqfile</u> is in format <u>&lt;s&gt;</u>, bypassing format autodetection.  Common choices
              for <u>&lt;s&gt;</u> include: <b>fasta</b>, <b>embl</b>, <b>genbank.</b>  Alignment  formats  also  work;  common  choices  include:
              <b>stockholm</b>, <b>a2m</b>, <b>afa</b>, <b>psiblast</b>, <b>clustal</b>, <b>phylip</b>.  For more information, and for codes for some less
              common  formats,  see main documentation.  The string <u>&lt;s&gt;</u> is case-insensitive (<b>fasta</b> or <b>FASTA</b> both
              work).

       <b>--w_beta</b> <u>&lt;x&gt;</u>
              Window length tail mass.  The upper bound, W, on the length at which nhmmer  expects  to  find  an
              instance  of  the model is set such that the fraction of all sequences generated by the model with
              length &gt;= W is less than <u>&lt;x&gt;</u>.  The default is 1e-7.  This flag may be used to override  the  value
              of W established for the model by <b>hmmbuild</b>.

       <b>--w_length</b> <u>&lt;n&gt;</u>
              Override  the model instance length upper bound, W, which is otherwise controlled by <b>--w_beta</b>.  It
              should be larger than the model length. The value of  W is used deep in the acceleration pipeline,
              and modest changes are not expected to impact results (though larger values of W do lead to longer
              run time).  This flag may be used to override  the  value  of  W  established  for  the  model  by
              <b>hmmbuild</b>.

       <b>--watson</b>
              Only  search  the  top  strand.  By default both the query sequence and its reverse-complement are
              searched.

       <b>--crick</b>
              Only search the bottom (reverse-complement) strand. By default both the  query  sequence  and  its
              reverse-complement are searched.

       <b>--cpu</b> <u>&lt;n&gt;</u>
              Set  the number of parallel worker threads to <u>&lt;n&gt;</u>.  The default is 0, meaning off (no thread-level
              parallelization), because <b>nhmmscan</b> is typically i/o bound and the extra overhead  of  our  current
              multithreaded  implementation  isn't  worthwhile.   You can also control this number by setting an
              environment variable, <u>HMMER_NCPU</u>.  There is also a master thread, so the actual number of  threads
              that HMMER spawns is at least <u>&lt;n&gt;</u>+1.

              This option is not available if HMMER was compiled with POSIX threads support turned off.

       <b>--stall</b>
              For  debugging the MPI master/worker version: pause after start, to enable the developer to attach
              debuggers to the running master and worker(s) processes. Send SIGCONT signal to release the pause.
              (Under gdb: <b>(gdb)</b> <b>signal</b> <b>SIGCONT</b>)

              (Only available if optional MPI support was enabled at compile-time.)

       <b>--mpi</b>  Run  under  MPI  control  with  master/worker  parallelization  (using  <b>mpirun</b>,  for  example,  or
              equivalent). Only available if optional MPI support was enabled at compile-time.
