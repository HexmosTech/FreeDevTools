       cmsearch - search covariance model(s) against a sequence database

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>cmsearch</b> <u>[options]</u> <u>&lt;cmfile&gt;</u> <u>&lt;seqdb&gt;</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>cmsearch</b>  is used to search one or more covariance models (CMs) against a sequence database.  For each CM
       in <u>&lt;cmfile&gt;,</u> use that query CM to search the target database of sequences in <u>&lt;seqdb&gt;,</u> and  output  ranked
       lists  of  the  sequences  with  the  most  significant  matches  to  the CM.  To build CMs from multiple
       alignments, see <b>cmbuild.</b>

       The query <u>&lt;cmfile&gt;</u> must have been calibrated for E-values with <b>cmcalibrate.</b>  As a special exception,  any
       models  in <u>&lt;cmfile&gt;</u> that have zero basepairs need not be calibrated. For these models, profile HMM search
       algorithms will be used instead of CM ones, as discussed further below.

       The query <u>&lt;cmfile&gt;</u> may be '-' (a dash character), in which case the query CM input will be  read  from  a
       &lt;stdin&gt;  pipe instead of from a file. The <u>&lt;seqdb&gt;</u> may not be '-' because the current implementation needs
       to be able to rewind the database, which is not possible with <u>stdin</u> input.

       The output format is designed to be human-readable, but  is  often  so  voluminous  that  reading  it  is
       impractical,  and  parsing it is a pain. The <b>--tblout</b> option saves output in a simple tabular format that
       is concise and easier to parse.  The <b>-o</b> option allows redirecting the main output, including throwing  it
       away in /dev/null.

       <b>cmsearch</b>  reexamines the 5' and 3' termini of target sequences using specialized algorithms for detection
       of <u>truncated</u> hits, in which part of the 5' and/or 3' end of the actual full length homologous sequence is
       missing in the target sequence file. These types of hits will be most common in sequence files consisting
       of unassembled sequencing reads. By default, any 5' truncated  hit  is  required  to  include  the  first
       residue  of  the  target  sequence  it  derives  from in <u>&lt;seqdb&gt;,</u> and any 3' truncated hit is required to
       include the final residue of the target sequence it derives from.  Any  5'  and  3'  truncated  hit  must
       include  the  first  and final residue of the target sequence it derives from. The <b>--anytrunc</b> option will
       relax the requirements for hit inclusion of sequence endpoints, and truncated hits are allowed  to  start
       and  stop at any positions of target sequences. Importantly though, with <b>--anytrunc,</b> hit E-values will be
       less accurate because model calibration does not consider the possibility of truncated hits,  so  use  it
       with  caution.   The  <b>--notrunc</b>  option  can be used to turn off truncated hit detection.  <b>--notrunc</b> will
       reduce the running time of <b>cmsearch,</b> most significantly for target <u>&lt;seqdb&gt;</u> files that include many  short
       sequences.

       Truncated  hit  detection  is  automatically  turned  off  when the <b>--max,</b> <b>--nohmm,</b> <b>--qdb,</b> or <b>--nonbanded</b>
       options are used because it relies on the use of an accelerated HMM banded  alignment  strategy  that  is
       turned off by any of those options.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-h</b>     Help; print a brief reminder of command line usage and all available options.

       <b>-g</b>     Turn  on  the  <u>glocal</u>  alignment  algorithm, global with respect to the query model and local with
              respect to the target database. By default, the local alignment algorithm is used which  is  local
              with  respect  to both the target sequence and the model. In local mode, the alignment to span two
              or more subsequences if necessary (e.g. if the structures of the query model and  target  sequence
              are only partially shared), allowing certain large insertions and deletions in the structure to be
              penalized  differently  than normal indels. Local mode performs better on empirical benchmarks and
              is significantly more sensitive for remote homology detection. Empirically, glocal searches return
              many fewer hits than local searches, so glocal may be desired for some applications. With <b>-g,</b>  all
              models must be calibrated, even those with zero basepairs.

       <b>-Z</b> <u>&lt;x&gt;</u> Calculate  E-values  as  if  the search space size was <u>&lt;x&gt;</u> megabases (Mb). Without the use of this
              option, the search space size is defined as the total number of nucleotides in  <u>&lt;seqdb&gt;</u>  times  2,
              because both strands of each target sequence will be searched.

       <b>--devhelp</b>
              Print  help,  as with <b>-h</b> <b>,</b> but also include expert options that are not displayed with <b>-h</b> <b>.</b>  These
              expert options are not expected to be relevant for the vast majority  of  users  and  so  are  not
              described  in the manual page.  The only resources for understanding what they actually do are the
              brief one-line descriptions output when <b>--devhelp</b> is enabled, and the source code.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>CONTROLLING</b> <b>OUTPUT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-o</b> <u>&lt;f&gt;</u> Direct the main human-readable output to a file <u>&lt;f&gt;</u> instead of the default stdout.

       <b>-A</b> <u>&lt;f&gt;</u> Save a multiple alignment of all significant hits (those satisfying <u>inclusion</u> <u>thresholds)</u>  to  the
              file <u>&lt;f&gt;.</u>

       <b>--tblout</b> <u>&lt;f&gt;</u>
              Save  a  simple  tabular (space-delimited) file summarizing the hits found, with one data line per
              hit. The format of this file is described in section 6 of the Infernal user guide.

       <b>--acc</b>  Use accessions instead of names in the main output, where available for profiles and/or sequences.

       <b>--noali</b>
              Omit the alignment section from the main output. This can greatly reduce the output volume.

       <b>--notextw</b>
              Unlimit the length of each line in the main output. The default is a limit of 120  characters  per
              line,  which  helps in displaying the output cleanly on terminals and in editors, but can truncate
              target profile description lines.

       <b>--textw</b> <u>&lt;n&gt;</u>
              Set the main output's line length limit to <u>&lt;n&gt;</u> characters per line. The default is 120.

       <b>--verbose</b>
              Include extra search pipeline statistics in the main output, including filter survival  statistics
              for truncated hit detection and number of envelopes discarded due to matrix size overflows.

       <b>--nomiss</b>
              With  -A, in the output alignment, do not mark truncated hits as fragmentary by using missing data
              '~' characters before the first residue (for 5' truncated hits) and/or  after  the  final  residue
              (for  3'  truncated  hits).  By default, missing data characters ('~') will be used in this way to
              mark truncated hits as fragments. The cmbuild program can use these fragment definitions in  input
              alignment files if the <b>--fraggiven</b> option is used.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b> <b>CONTROLLING</b> <b>REPORTING</b> <b>THRESHOLDS</b></h4><pre>
       Reporting  thresholds control which hits are reported in output files (the main output and <u>--tblout)</u> Hits
       are ranked by statistical significance (E-value).  By default,  all  hits  with  an  E-value  &lt;=  10  are
       reported.   The following options allow you to change the default E-value reporting thresholds, or to use
       bit score thresholds instead.

       <b>-E</b> <u>&lt;x&gt;</u> In the per-target output, report target sequences with an E-value of &lt;= <u>&lt;x&gt;.</u>  The default is 10.0,
              meaning that on average, about 10 false positives will be reported per query, so you can  see  the
              top of the noise and decide for yourself if it's really noise.

       <b>-T</b> <u>&lt;x&gt;</u> Instead  of  thresholding per-CM output on E-value, report target sequences with a bit score of &gt;=
              <u>&lt;x&gt;.</u>

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>INCLUSION</b> <b>THRESHOLDS</b></h4><pre>
       Inclusion thresholds are stricter than reporting thresholds.  Inclusion thresholds control which hits are
       considered to be reliable enough to be included in an output alignment or in a possible subsequent search
       round, or marked as significant ("!") as opposed to questionable ("?") in hit output.

       <b>--incE</b> <u>&lt;x&gt;</u>
              Use an E-value of &lt;= <u>&lt;x&gt;</u> as the hit inclusion threshold.  The default is  0.01,  meaning  that  on
              average,  about  1  false  positive  would  be expected in every 100 searches with different query
              sequences.

       <b>--incT</b> <u>&lt;x&gt;</u>
              Instead of using E-values for setting the inclusion threshold, instead use a bit score of  &gt;=  <u>&lt;x&gt;</u>
              as the hit inclusion threshold.  By default this option is unset.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>MODEL-SPECIFIC</b> <b>SCORE</b> <b>THRESHOLDING</b></h4><pre>
       Curated  CM  databases may define specific bit score thresholds for each CM, superseding any thresholding
       based on statistical significance alone.

       To use these options, the profile must contain  the  appropriate  (GA,  TC,  and/or  NC)  optional  score
       threshold  annotation;  this  is  picked  up  by  <b>cmbuild</b>  from  Stockholm  format  alignment files. Each
       thresholding option has a score of <u>&lt;x&gt;</u> bits,  and  acts  as  if  <b>-T</b>  <u>&lt;x&gt;</u>  <b>--incT</b>  <u>&lt;x&gt;</u>  has  been  applied
       specifically using each model's curated thresholds.

       <b>--cut_ga</b>
              Use  the  GA (gathering) bit scores in the model to set hit reporting and inclusion thresholds. GA
              thresholds are generally  considered  to  be  the  reliable  curated  thresholds  defining  family
              membership;  for  example,  in  Rfam,  these  thresholds  define  what  gets included in Rfam Full
              alignments based on searches with Rfam Seed models.

       <b>--cut_nc</b>
              Use the NC (noise cutoff) bit score thresholds in the model to set  hit  reporting  and  inclusion
              thresholds.  NC  thresholds  are generally considered to be the score of the highest-scoring known
              false positive.

       <b>--cut_tc</b>
              Use the TC (trusted cutoff) bit score thresholds in the model to set hit reporting  and  inclusion
              thresholds.  TC  thresholds  are  generally considered to be the score of the lowest-scoring known
              true positive that is above all known false positives.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b> <b>CONTROLLING</b> <b>THE</b> <b>ACCELERATION</b> <b>PIPELINE</b></h4><pre>
       Infernal 1.1 searches are accelerated in a six-stage filter pipeline. The first five stages use a profile
       HMM to define envelopes that are passed to the stage six CM CYK filter. Any envelopes  that  survive  all
       filters  are  assigned  final  scores  using  the  the  CM Inside algorithm. (See the user guide for more
       information.)

       The profile HMM filter is built by the <b>cmbuild</b> program and is stored in <u>&lt;cmfile&gt;.</u>

       Each successive filter is slower than the previous one, but  better  than  it  at  disciminating  between
       subsequences  that  may  contain  high-scoring  CM hits and those that do not. The first three HMM filter
       stages are the same as those used in HMMER3.  Stage 1 (F1) is the local HMM SSV filter modified for  long
       sequences.  Stage  2  (F2) is the local HMM Viterbi filter. Stage 3 (F3) is the local HMM Forward filter.
       Each of the first three stages uses the profile HMM in local mode, which allows a target  subsequence  to
       align  to any region of the HMM. Stage 4 (F4) is a glocal HMM filter, which requires a target subsequence
       to align to the full-length profile HMM. Stage 5 (F5) is the glocal HMM envelope definition filter, which
       uses HMMER3's domain identification heursitics to define envelope boundaries. After each stage from 2  to
       5  a bias filter step (F2b, F3b, F4b, and F5b) is used to remove sequences that appear to have passed the
       filter due to biased composition alone. Any envelopes that survive stages F1 through F5b are then  passed
       with  the  local  CM CYK filter. The CYK filter uses constraints (bands) derived from an HMM alignment of
       the envelope to reduce the number of required calculations and save time.  Any envelopes  that  pass  CYK
       are scored with the local CM Inside algorithm, again using HMM bands for acceleration.

       The  default  filter  thresholds that define the minimum score required for a subsequence to survive each
       stage are defined based on the size of the database in  <u>&lt;seqdb&gt;</u>  (or  the  size  <u>&lt;x&gt;</u>  in  megabases  (Mb)
       specified  by the <b>-Z</b> <u>&lt;x&gt;</u> or <b>--FZ</b> <u>&lt;x&gt;</u> options).  For larger databases, the filters are more strict leading
       to more acceleration but potentially a greater loss of sensitivity. The  rationale  is  that  for  larger
       databases,  hits  must have higher scores to achieve statistical significance, so stricter filtering that
       removes lower scoring insignificant hits is acceptable.

       The P-value thresholds for all possible search space sizes and all filter stages are listed next.  (A  P-
       value  threshold  of  0.01  means  that  roughly  1% of the highest scoring nonhomologous subsequence are
       expected to pass the filter.) Z is defined as the number of nucleotides in the complete  target  sequence
       file times 2 because both strands will be searched with each model.

       If Z is less than 2 Mb: F1 is 0.35; F2 and F2b are off; F3, F3b, F4, F4b and F5 are 0.02; F6 is 0.0001.

       If  Z is between 2 Mb and 20 Mb: F1 is 0.35; F2 and F2b are off; F3, F3b, F4, F4b and F5 are 0.005; F6 is
       0.0001.

       If Z is between 20 Mb and 200 Mb: F1 is 0.35; F2 and F2b are 0.15; F3, F3b, F4, F4b and F5 are 0.003;  F6
       is 0.0001.

       If  Z  is  between  200  Mb  and 2 Gb: F1 is 0.15; F2 and F2b are 0.15; F3, F3b, F4, F4b, F5, and F5b are
       0.0008; and F6 is 0.0001.

       If Z is between 2 Gb and 20 Gb: F1 is 0.15; F2 and F2b are 0.15; F3,  F3b,  F4,  F4b,  F5,  and  F5b  are
       0.0002; and F6 is 0.0001.

       If  Z  is more than 20 Gb: F1 is 0.06; F2 and F2b are 0.02; F3, F3b, F4, F4b, F5, and F5b are 0.0002; and
       F6 is 0.0001.

       These thresholds were chosen based on  performance  on  an  internal  benchmark  testing  many  different
       possible settings.

       There  are  five  options  for  controlling the general filtering level. These options are, in order from
       least strict (slowest but most sensitive) to most strict (fastest but least sensitive):  <b>--max,</b>  <b>--nohmm,</b>
       <b>--mid,</b>  <b>--default,</b>  (this  is  the  default  setting), <b>--rfam.</b>  and <b>--hmmonly.</b>  With <b>--default</b> the filter
       thresholds will be database-size dependent. See the explanation of each of these individual options below
       for more information.

       Additionally, an expert user can precisely control each filter  stage  score  threshold  with  the  <b>--F1,</b>
       <b>--F1b,</b>  <b>--F2,</b>  <b>--F2b,</b> <b>--F3,</b> <b>--F3b,</b> <b>--F4,</b> <b>--F4b,</b> <b>--F5,</b> <b>--F5b,</b> and <b>--F6</b> options. As well as turn each stage
       on or off with the <b>--noF1,</b> <b>--doF1b,</b> <b>--noF2,</b>  <b>--noF2b,</b>  <b>--noF3,</b>  <b>--noF3b,</b>  <b>--noF4,</b>  <b>--noF4b,</b>  <b>--noF5,</b>  and
       <b>--noF6.</b>  options.  These options are only displayed if the <b>--devhelp</b> option is used to keep the number of
       displayed options with <b>-h</b> reasonable, and because they are only expected to be useful to a small minority
       of users.

       As  a  special  case,  for any models in <u>&lt;cmfile&gt;</u> which have zero basepairs, profile HMM searches are run
       instead of CM searches. HMM algorithms are more efficient than CM  algorithms,  and  the  benefit  of  CM
       algorithms  is  lost  for models with no secondary structure (zero basepairs). These profile HMM searches
       will run significantly faster than the CM searches. You can force HMM-only searches  with  the  <b>--hmmonly</b>
       option.  For more information on HMM-only searches see the description of the <b>--hmmonly</b> option below, and
       the user guide.

       <b>--max</b>  Turn off all filters, and run  non-banded  Inside  on  every  full-length  target  sequence.  This
              increases sensitivity somewhat, at an extremely large cost in speed.

       <b>--nohmm</b>
              Turn  off all HMM filter stages (F1 through F5b). The CYK filter, using QDBs, will be run on every
              full-length target sequence and will enforce a P-value threshold of 0.0001. Each subsequence  that
              survives CYK will be passed to Inside, which will also use QDBs (but a looser set). This increases
              sensitivity somewhat, at a very large cost in speed.

       <b>--mid</b>  Turn  off  the  HMM  SSV  and  Viterbi  filter  stages (F1 through F2b).  Set remaining HMM filter
              thresholds (F3 through F5b) to 0.02 by default, but changeable to <u>&lt;x&gt;</u> with  <b>--Fmid</b>  <u>&lt;x&gt;</u>  sequence.
              This may increase sensitivity, at a significant cost in speed.

       <b>--default</b>
              Use  the  default  filtering  strategy.  This  option  is on by default. The filter thresholds are
              determined based on the database size.

       <b>--rfam</b> Use a strict filtering strategy  devised  for  large  databases  (more  than  20  Gb).  This  will
              accelerate  the  search at a potential cost to sensitivity. It will have no effect if the database
              is larger than 20 Gb.

       <b>--hmmonly</b>
              Only use the filter profile HMM for searches, do not use the CM.  Only filter stages F1 through F3
              will be executed, using strict P-value thresholds (0.02 for F1, 0.001 for F2 and 0.00001 for  F3).
              Additionally  a  bias  composition  filter  is  used  after  the  F1  stage  (with P=0.02 survival
              threshold).  Any hit that survives all stages and has an  HMM  E-value  or  bit  score  above  the
              reporting  threshold  will  be  output.   The  user  can change the HMM-only filter thresholds and
              options with <b>--hmmF1,</b> <b>--hmmF2,</b> <b>--hmmF3,</b> <b>--hmmnobias,</b>  <b>--hmmnonull2,</b>  and  <b>--hmmmax.</b>   By  default,
              searches  for  any model with zero basepairs will be run in HMM-only mode. This can be turned off,
              forcing CM searches for these  models  with  the  <b>--nohmmonly</b>  option.   These  options  are  only
              displayed if the <b>--devhelp</b> option is used.

       <b>--FZ</b> <u>&lt;x&gt;</u>
              Set  filter  thresholds as the defaults used if the database were <b>&lt;x&gt;</b> megabases (Mb). If used with
              <b>&lt;x&gt;</b> greater than 20000 (20 Gb) this option has the same effect as <b>--rfam.</b>

       <b>--Fmid</b> <u>&lt;x&gt;</u>
              With the <b>--mid</b> option set the HMM filter thresholds (F3 through F5b) to <u>&lt;x&gt;.</u>  By default,  <u>&lt;x&gt;</u>  is
              0.02.

</pre><h4><b>OTHER</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--notrunc</b>
              Turn off truncated hit detection.

       <b>--anytrunc</b>
              Allow  truncated  hits  to  begin  and  end  at  any position in a target sequence. By default, 5'
              truncated hits must include the first residue of their target sequence and 3' truncated hits  must
              include  the  final  residue of their target sequence. With this option you may observe fewer full
              length hits that extend to the beginning and end of the query CM. As of version  1.1.5,  truncated
              hits  that  end at sequence terminii with a lower score penalty than internally truncated hits are
              also considered (these were not considered in 1.1x versions prior to  1.1.5).   To  reproduce  the
              behavior of this option from v1.1.4, use the <b>--inttrunc</b> option instead.

       <b>--nonull3</b>
              Turn off the null3 CM score corrections for biased composition. This correction is not used during
              the HMM filter stages.

       <b>--mxsize</b> <u>&lt;x&gt;</u>
              Set  the  maximum  allowable  CM  DP matrix size to <u>&lt;x&gt;</u> megabytes. By default this size is 128 Mb.
              This should be large enough for the vast majority of searches, especially with smaller models.  If
              <b>cmsearch</b> encounters an envelope in the CYK or Inside stage that  requires  a  larger  matrix,  the
              envelope  will  be  discounted from consideration. This behavior is like an additional filter that
              prevents expensive (slow) CM DP calculations, but at a potential cost to sensitivity.   Note  that
              if  <b>cmsearch</b> is being run in <u>&lt;n&gt;</u> multiple threads on a multicore machine then each thread may have
              an allocated matrix of up to size <u>&lt;x&gt;</u> Mb at any given time.

       <b>--smxsize</b> <u>&lt;x&gt;</u>
              Set the maximum allowable CM search DP matrix size to <u>&lt;x&gt;</u> megabytes. By default this size  is  128
              Mb.   This  option is only relevant if the CM will not use HMM banded matrices, i.e. if the <b>--max,</b>
              <b>--nohmm,</b> <b>--qdb,</b> <b>--fqdb,</b> <b>--nonbanded,</b> or <b>--fnonbanded</b> options are also used. Note that if  <b>cmsearch</b>
              is being run in <u>&lt;n&gt;</u> multiple threads on a multicore machine then each thread may have an allocated
              matrix of up to size <u>&lt;x&gt;</u> Mb at any given time.

       <b>--cyk</b>  Use the CYK algorithm, not Inside, to determine the final score of all hits.

       <b>--acyk</b> Use  the  CYK algorithm to align hits. By default, the Durbin/Holmes optimal accuracy algorithm is
              used, which finds the alignment that maximizes the expected accuracy of all aligned residues.

       <b>--wcx</b> <u>&lt;x&gt;</u>
              For each CM, set the W parameter, the expected maximum length of a hit, to <u>&lt;x&gt;</u> times the consensus
              length of the model. By default, the W parameter is read from the CM file and was calculated based
              on the transition probabilities of the model by <b>cmbuild.</b>  You can find out what the default  W  is
              for  a  model  using  <b>cmstat.</b>  This option should be used with caution as it impacts the filtering
              pipeline at several different stages in nonobvious ways. It is only recommended for  expert  users
              searching  for  hits  that  are  much  longer  than any of the homologs used to build the model in
              <b>cmbuild,</b> e.g. ones with large introns or other large insertions.  This option cannot  be  used  in
              combination  with  the  <b>--nohmm,</b>  <b>--fqdb</b>  or  <b>--qdb</b> options because in those cases W is limited by
              query-dependent bands.

       <b>--toponly</b>
              Only search the top (Watson) strand of target sequences in <u>&lt;seqdb&gt;.</u>  By default, both strands  are
              searched. This will halve the database size (Z).

       <b>--bottomonly</b>
              Only  search  the  bottom (Crick) strand of target sequences in <u>&lt;seqdb&gt;.</u>  By default, both strands
              are searched.  This will halve the database size (Z).

       <b>--tformat</b> <u>&lt;s&gt;</u>
              Assert that the target sequence database file is in format <u>&lt;s&gt;.</u>  Accepted formats  include  <u>fasta,</u>
              <u>embl,</u>  <u>genbank,</u>  <u>ddbj,</u> <u>stockholm,</u> <u>pfam,</u> <u>a2m,</u> <u>afa,</u> <u>clustal,</u> and <u>phylip</u> The default is to autodetect
              the format of the file.

       <b>--cpu</b> <u>&lt;n&gt;</u>
              Set the number of parallel worker threads to <u>&lt;n&gt;</u>.  On multicore machines, the default is  4.   You
              can  also  control this number by setting an environment variable, <u>INFERNAL_NCPU</u>.  There is also a
              master thread, so the actual number of threads that Infernal spawns is <u>&lt;n&gt;</u>+1.  This option is  not
              available if Infernal was compiled with POSIX threads support turned off.

       <b>--stall</b>
              For  debugging the MPI master/worker version: pause after start, to enable the developer to attach
              debuggers to the running master and worker(s) processes. Send SIGCONT signal to release the pause.
              (Under gdb: <u>(gdb)</u> <u>signal</u> <u>SIGCONT)</u> (Only available if optional MPI support was enabled at  compile-
              time.)

       <b>--mpi</b>  Run in MPI master/worker mode, using <u>mpirun.</u>  To use <b>--mpi,</b> the sequence file must have first been
              'indexed'  using  the  <b>esl-sfetch</b> program, which is included with Infernal, in the <u>easel/miniapps/</u>
              subdirectory.  (Only available if optional MPI support was enabled at compile-time.)
