</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       ffmpeg-filters - FFmpeg filters

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This document describes filters, sources, and sinks provided by the libavfilter library.

</pre><h4><b>FILTERING</b> <b>INTRODUCTION</b></h4><pre>
       Filtering in FFmpeg is enabled through the libavfilter library.

       In libavfilter, a filter can have multiple inputs and multiple outputs.  To illustrate the sorts of
       things that are possible, we consider the following filtergraph.

                               [main]
               input --&gt; split ---------------------&gt; overlay --&gt; output
                           |                             ^
                           |[tmp]                  [flip]|
                           +-----&gt; crop --&gt; vflip -------+

       This filtergraph splits the input stream in two streams, then sends one stream through the crop filter
       and the vflip filter, before merging it back with the other stream by overlaying it on top. You can use
       the following command to achieve this:

               ffmpeg -i INPUT -vf "split [main][tmp]; [tmp] crop=iw:ih/2:0:0, vflip [flip]; [main][flip] overlay=0:H/2" OUTPUT

       The result will be that the top half of the video is mirrored onto the bottom half of the output video.

       Filters in the same linear chain are separated by commas, and distinct linear chains of filters are
       separated by semicolons. In our example, <u>crop,vflip</u> are in one linear chain, <u>split</u> and <u>overlay</u> are
       separately in another. The points where the linear chains join are labelled by names enclosed in square
       brackets. In the example, the split filter generates two outputs that are associated to the labels <u>[main]</u>
       and <u>[tmp]</u>.

       The stream sent to the second output of <u>split</u>, labelled as <u>[tmp]</u>, is processed through the <u>crop</u> filter,
       which crops away the lower half part of the video, and then vertically flipped. The <u>overlay</u> filter takes
       in input the first unchanged output of the split filter (which was labelled as <u>[main]</u>), and overlay on
       its lower half the output generated by the <u>crop,vflip</u> filterchain.

       Some filters take in input a list of parameters: they are specified after the filter name and an equal
       sign, and are separated from each other by a colon.

       There exist so-called <u>source</u> <u>filters</u> that do not have an audio/video input, and <u>sink</u> <u>filters</u> that will
       not have audio/video output.

</pre><h4><b>GRAPH</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>graph2dot</u> program included in the FFmpeg <u>tools</u> directory can be used to parse a filtergraph
       description and issue a corresponding textual representation in the dot language.

       Invoke the command:

               graph2dot -h

       to see how to use <u>graph2dot</u>.

       You can then pass the dot description to the <u>dot</u> program (from the graphviz suite of programs) and obtain
       a graphical representation of the filtergraph.

       For example the sequence of commands:

               echo &lt;GRAPH_DESCRIPTION&gt; | \
               tools/graph2dot -o graph.tmp &amp;&amp; \
               dot -Tpng graph.tmp -o graph.png &amp;&amp; \
               display graph.png

       can be used to create and display an image representing the graph described by the <u>GRAPH_DESCRIPTION</u>
       string. Note that this string must be a complete self-contained graph, with its inputs and outputs
       explicitly defined.  For example if your command line is of the form:

               ffmpeg -i infile -vf scale=640:360 outfile

       your <u>GRAPH_DESCRIPTION</u> string will need to be of the form:

               nullsrc,scale=640:360,nullsink

       you may also need to set the <u>nullsrc</u> parameters and add a <u>format</u> filter in order to simulate a specific
       input file.

</pre><h4><b>FILTERGRAPH</b> <b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       A filtergraph is a directed graph of connected filters. It can contain cycles, and there can be multiple
       links between a pair of filters. Each link has one input pad on one side connecting it to one filter from
       which it takes its input, and one output pad on the other side connecting it to one filter accepting its
       output.

       Each filter in a filtergraph is an instance of a filter class registered in the application, which
       defines the features and the number of input and output pads of the filter.

       A filter with no input pads is called a "source", and a filter with no output pads is called a "sink".

   <b>Filtergraph</b> <b>syntax</b>
       A filtergraph has a textual representation, which is recognized by the <b>-filter</b>/<b>-vf</b>/<b>-af</b> and
       <b>-filter_complex</b> options in <b>ffmpeg</b> and <b>-vf</b>/<b>-af</b> in <b>ffplay</b>, and by the avfilter_graph_parse_ptr() function
       defined in <u>libavfilter/avfilter.h</u>.

       A filterchain consists of a sequence of connected filters, each one connected to the previous one in the
       sequence. A filterchain is represented by a list of ","-separated filter descriptions.

       A filtergraph consists of a sequence of filterchains. A sequence of filterchains is represented by a list
       of ";"-separated filterchain descriptions.

       A filter is represented by a string of the form:
       [<u>in_link_1</u>]...[<u>in_link_N</u>]<u>filter_name</u>@<u>id</u>=<u>arguments</u>[<u>out_link_1</u>]...[<u>out_link_M</u>]

       <u>filter_name</u> is the name of the filter class of which the described filter is an instance of, and has to
       be the name of one of the filter classes registered in the program optionally followed by "@<u>id</u>".  The
       name of the filter class is optionally followed by a string "=<u>arguments</u>".

       <u>arguments</u> is a string which contains the parameters used to initialize the filter instance. It may have
       one of two forms:

       •   A ':'-separated list of <u>key=value</u> pairs.

       •   A ':'-separated list of <u>value</u>. In this case, the keys are assumed to be the option names in the order
           they  are  declared. E.g. the "fade" filter declares three options in this order -- <b>type</b>, <b>start_frame</b>
           and <b>nb_frames</b>. Then the parameter list <u>in:0:30</u> means that the value <u>in</u>  is  assigned  to  the  option
           <b>type</b>, <u>0</u> to <b>start_frame</b> and <u>30</u> to <b>nb_frames</b>.

       •   A  ':'-separated  list  of mixed direct <u>value</u> and long <u>key=value</u> pairs. The direct <u>value</u> must precede
           the <u>key=value</u> pairs, and follow the same constraints order  of  the  previous  point.  The  following
           <u>key=value</u> pairs can be set in any preferred order.

       If  the  option value itself is a list of items (e.g. the "format" filter takes a list of pixel formats),
       the items in the list are usually separated by <b>|</b>.

       The list of arguments can be quoted using the character <b>'</b> as initial and ending mark, and the character <b>\</b>
       for escaping the characters  within  the  quoted  text;  otherwise  the  argument  string  is  considered
       terminated when the next special character (belonging to the set <b>[]=;,</b>) is encountered.

       A special syntax implemented in the <b>ffmpeg</b> CLI tool allows loading option values from files. This is done
       be prepending a slash '/' to the option name, then the supplied value is interpreted as a path from which
       the actual value is loaded. E.g.

               ffmpeg -i &lt;INPUT&gt; -vf drawtext=/text=/tmp/some_text &lt;OUTPUT&gt;

       will  load  the  text  to  be drawn from <u>/tmp/some_text</u>. API users wishing to implement a similar feature
       should use the "avfilter_graph_segment_*()" functions together with custom IO code.

       The name and arguments of the filter are optionally preceded and followed by a list of  link  labels.   A
       link  label  allows  one  to  name a link and associate it to a filter output or input pad. The preceding
       labels <u>in_link_1</u> ... <u>in_link_N</u>, are associated to the filter input pads, the following labels  <u>out_link_1</u>
       ... <u>out_link_M</u>, are associated to the output pads.

       When  two  link  labels with the same name are found in the filtergraph, a link between the corresponding
       input and output pad is created.

       If an output pad is not labelled, it is linked by default to the first unlabelled input pad of  the  next
       filter in the filterchain.  For example in the filterchain

               nullsrc, split[L1], [L2]overlay, nullsink

       the  split filter instance has two output pads, and the overlay filter instance two input pads. The first
       output pad of split is labelled "L1", the first input pad of overlay is labelled  "L2",  and  the  second
       output pad of split is linked to the second input pad of overlay, which are both unlabelled.

       In a filter description, if the input label of the first filter is not specified, "in" is assumed; if the
       output label of the last filter is not specified, "out" is assumed.

       In  a  complete  filterchain  all  the  unlabelled  filter  input  and  output  pads must be connected. A
       filtergraph is considered valid if all the filter input and output  pads  of  all  the  filterchains  are
       connected.

       Leading  and  trailing  whitespaces  (space,  tabs,  or  line feeds) separating tokens in the filtergraph
       specification are ignored. This means that the filtergraph can be expressed using empty lines and  spaces
       to improve redability.

       For example, the filtergraph:

               testsrc,split[L1],hflip[L2];[L1][L2] hstack

       can be represented as:

               testsrc,
               split [L1], hflip [L2];

               [L1][L2] hstack

       Libavfilter  will  automatically insert <b>scale</b> filters where format conversion is required. It is possible
       to specify swscale flags for those automatically inserted scalers by prepending "sws_flags=<u>flags</u>;" to the
       filtergraph description.

       Here is a BNF description of the filtergraph syntax:

               &lt;NAME&gt;             ::= sequence of alphanumeric characters and '_'
               &lt;FILTER_NAME&gt;      ::= &lt;NAME&gt;["@"&lt;NAME&gt;]
               &lt;LINKLABEL&gt;        ::= "[" &lt;NAME&gt; "]"
               &lt;LINKLABELS&gt;       ::= &lt;LINKLABEL&gt; [&lt;LINKLABELS&gt;]
               &lt;FILTER_ARGUMENTS&gt; ::= sequence of chars (possibly quoted)
               &lt;FILTER&gt;           ::= [&lt;LINKLABELS&gt;] &lt;FILTER_NAME&gt; ["=" &lt;FILTER_ARGUMENTS&gt;] [&lt;LINKLABELS&gt;]
               &lt;FILTERCHAIN&gt;      ::= &lt;FILTER&gt; [,&lt;FILTERCHAIN&gt;]
               &lt;FILTERGRAPH&gt;      ::= [sws_flags=&lt;flags&gt;;] &lt;FILTERCHAIN&gt; [;&lt;FILTERGRAPH&gt;]

   <b>Notes</b> <b>on</b> <b>filtergraph</b> <b>escaping</b>
       Filtergraph description composition entails several levels of escaping. See <b>the</b>  <b>"Quoting</b>  <b>and</b>  <b>escaping"</b>
       <b>section</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b><a href="../man1/ffmpeg-utils.1.html">ffmpeg-utils</a>(1)</b> <b>manual</b> for more information about the employed escaping procedure.

       A  first  level  escaping  affects the content of each filter option value, which may contain the special
       character ":" used to separate values, or one of the escaping characters "\'".

       A second level escaping affects the whole filter description, which may contain the  escaping  characters
       "\'" or the special characters "[],;" used by the filtergraph description.

       Finally,  when  you  specify  a  filtergraph  on  a  shell commandline, you need to perform a third level
       escaping for the shell special characters contained within it.

       For example, consider the following string to be embedded in the <b>drawtext</b> filter description <b>text</b> value:

               this is a 'string': may contain one, or more, special characters

       This string contains the "'" special escaping character, and the ":" special character, so it needs to be
       escaped in this way:

               text=this is a \'string\'\: may contain one, or more, special characters

       A second level  of  escaping  is  required  when  embedding  the  filter  description  in  a  filtergraph
       description, in order to escape all the filtergraph special characters. Thus the example above becomes:

               drawtext=text=this is a \\\'string\\\'\\: may contain one\, or more\, special characters

       (note that in addition to the "\'" escaping special characters, also "," needs to be escaped).

       Finally  an  additional  level  of escaping is needed when writing the filtergraph description in a shell
       command, which depends on the escaping rules of the adopted shell. For  example,  assuming  that  "\"  is
       special and needs to be escaped with another "\", the previous string will finally result in:

               -vf "drawtext=text=this is a \\\\\\'string\\\\\\'\\\\: may contain one\\, or more\\, special characters"

       In  order  to avoid cumbersome escaping when using a commandline tool accepting a filter specification as
       input, it is advisable to avoid direct inclusion of the filter or options specification in the shell.

       For example, in case of the <b>drawtext</b> <b>filter</b>, you might prefer to use the <b>textfile</b> option in place of <b>text</b>
       to specify the text to render.

</pre><h4><b>TIMELINE</b> <b>EDITING</b></h4><pre>
       Some filters support a generic <b>enable</b> option. For the filters supporting timeline  editing,  this  option
       can be set to an expression which is evaluated before sending a frame to the filter. If the evaluation is
       non-zero,  the  filter  will be enabled, otherwise the frame will be sent unchanged to the next filter in
       the filtergraph.

       The expression accepts the following values:

       <b>t</b>   timestamp expressed in seconds, NAN if the input timestamp is unknown

       <b>n</b>   sequential number of the input frame, starting from 0

       <b>pos</b> the position in the file of the input frame, NAN if unknown; deprecated, do not use

       <b>w</b>
       <b>h</b>   width and height of the input frame if video

       Additionally, these filters support an <b>enable</b> command that can be used to re-define the expression.

       Like any other filtering option, the <b>enable</b> option follows the same rules.

       For example, to enable a blur filter (<b>smartblur</b>) from 10 seconds  to  3  minutes,  and  a  <b>curves</b>  filter
       starting at 3 seconds:

               smartblur = enable='between(t,10,3*60)',
               curves    = enable='gte(t,3)' : preset=cross_process

       See "ffmpeg -filters" to view which filters have timeline support.

</pre><h4><b>CHANGING</b> <b>OPTIONS</b> <b>AT</b> <b>RUNTIME</b> <b>WITH</b> <b>A</b> <b>COMMAND</b></h4><pre>
       Some  options can be changed during the operation of the filter using a command. These options are marked
       'T' on the output of <b>ffmpeg</b> <b>-h</b> <b>filter=&lt;name</b> <b>of</b> <b>filter&gt;</b>.  The name of the  command  is  the  name  of  the
       option and the argument is the new value.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>FILTERS</b> <b>WITH</b> <b>SEVERAL</b> <b>INPUTS</b></h4><pre>
       Some filters with several inputs support a common set of options.  These options can only be set by name,
       not with the short notation.

       <b>eof_action</b>
           The  action  to  take when EOF is encountered on the secondary input; it accepts one of the following
           values:

           <b>repeat</b>
               Repeat the last frame (the default).

           <b>endall</b>
               End both streams.

           <b>pass</b>
               Pass the main input through.

       <b>shortest</b>
           If set to 1, force the output to terminate when the shortest input terminates. Default value is 0.

       <b>repeatlast</b>
           If set to 1, force the filter to extend the last frame of secondary streams  until  the  end  of  the
           primary stream. A value of 0 disables this behavior.  Default value is 1.

       <b>ts_sync_mode</b>
           How  strictly  to  sync  streams based on secondary input timestamps; it accepts one of the following
           values:

           <b>default</b>
               Frame from secondary input with the nearest lower or equal timestamp to the primary input frame.

           <b>nearest</b>
               Frame from secondary input with the absolute nearest timestamp to the primary input frame.

</pre><h4><b>AUDIO</b> <b>FILTERS</b></h4><pre>
       When  you  configure  your  FFmpeg  build,  you  can  disable  any  of   the   existing   filters   using
       "--disable-filters".  The configure output will show the audio filters included in your build.

       Below is a description of the currently available audio filters.

   <b>aap</b>
       Apply Affine Projection algorithm to the first audio stream using the second audio stream.

       This  adaptive  filter  is  used to estimate unknown audio based on multiple input audio samples.  Affine
       projection algorithm can make trade-offs between computation complexity with convergence speed.

       A description of the accepted options follows.

       <b>order</b>
           Set the filter order.

       <b>projection</b>
           Set the projection order.

       <b>mu</b>  Set the filter mu.

       <b>delta</b>
           Set the coefficient to initialize internal covariance matrix.

       <b>out_mode</b>
           Set the filter output samples. It accepts the following values:

           <b>i</b>   Pass the 1st input.

           <b>d</b>   Pass the 2nd input.

           <b>o</b>   Pass difference between desired, 2nd input and error signal estimate.

           <b>n</b>   Pass difference between input, 1st input and error signal estimate.

           <b>e</b>   Pass error signal estimated samples.

               Default value is <u>o</u>.

       <b>precision</b>
           Set which precision to use when processing samples.

           <b>auto</b>
               Auto pick internal sample format depending on other filters.

           <b>float</b>
               Always use single-floating point precision sample format.

           <b>double</b>
               Always use double-floating point precision sample format.

   <b>acompressor</b>
       A compressor is mainly used to reduce the dynamic range of a signal.  Especially modern music  is  mostly
       compressed  at  a high ratio to improve the overall loudness. It's done to get the highest attention of a
       listener, "fatten" the sound and bring more "power" to the track.  If a signal is compressed too much  it
       may  sound  dull or "dead" afterwards or it may start to "pump" (which could be a powerful effect but can
       also destroy a track completely).  The right compression is the key to reach a professional sound and  is
       the  high art of mixing and mastering. Because of its complex settings it may take a long time to get the
       right feeling for this kind of effect.

       Compression is done by detecting the volume above a chosen level  "threshold"  and  dividing  it  by  the
       factor  set  with  "ratio".  So if you set the threshold to -12dB and your signal reaches -6dB a ratio of
       2:1 will result in a signal at -9dB. Because an exact manipulation of the signal would  cause  distortion
       of  the  waveform  the  reduction  can  be  levelled  over the time. This is done by setting "Attack" and
       "Release".  "attack" determines how long the signal has to rise above the threshold before any  reduction
       will occur and "release" sets the time the signal has to fall below the threshold to reduce the reduction
       again.  Shorter signals than the chosen attack time will be left untouched.  The overall reduction of the
       signal can be made up afterwards with the "makeup" setting. So compressing the peaks of  a  signal  about
       6dB  and  raising  the  makeup to this level results in a signal twice as loud than the source. To gain a
       softer entry in the compression the "knee" flattens the hard edge at the threshold in the  range  of  the
       chosen decibels.

       The filter accepts the following options:

       <b>level_in</b>
           Set input gain. Default is 1. Range is between 0.015625 and 64.

       <b>mode</b>
           Set mode of compressor operation. Can be "upward" or "downward".  Default is "downward".

       <b>threshold</b>
           If  a  signal  of  stream rises above this level it will affect the gain reduction.  By default it is
           0.125. Range is between 0.00097563 and 1.

       <b>ratio</b>
           Set a ratio by which the signal is reduced. 1:2 means that if the level rose 4dB above the threshold,
           it will be only 2dB above after the reduction.  Default is 2. Range is between 1 and 20.

       <b>attack</b>
           Amount of milliseconds the signal has to rise above  the  threshold  before  gain  reduction  starts.
           Default is 20. Range is between 0.01 and 2000.

       <b>release</b>
           Amount  of  milliseconds  the  signal  has  to fall below the threshold before reduction is decreased
           again. Default is 250. Range is between 0.01 and 9000.

       <b>makeup</b>
           Set the amount by how much signal will be amplified after processing.  Default is 1. Range is from  1
           to 64.

       <b>knee</b>
           Curve  the  sharp knee around the threshold to enter gain reduction more softly.  Default is 2.82843.
           Range is between 1 and 8.

       <b>link</b>
           Choose if the "average" level between all channels of input stream or the  louder("maximum")  channel
           of input stream affects the reduction. Default is "average".

       <b>detection</b>
           Should  the  exact signal be taken in case of "peak" or an RMS one in case of "rms". Default is "rms"
           which is mostly smoother.

   <b>acrusher</b>
       Reduce audio bit resolution.

       This filter is bit crusher with enhanced functionality. A bit crusher is used to audibly reduce number of
       bits  an  audio  signal  is  sampled with. This doesn't change the bit depth at all, it just produces the
       effect. Material reduced in bit depth sounds more harsh and "digital".  This filter is able to even round
       to continuous values instead of discrete bit depths.  Additionally it has a D/C offset which  results  in
       different  crushing  of  the lower and the upper half of the signal.  An Anti-Aliasing setting is able to
       produce "softer" crushing sounds.

       Another feature of this filter is the logarithmic mode.  This  setting  switches  from  linear  distances
       between  bits  to  logarithmic  ones.  The result is a much more "natural" sounding crusher which doesn't
       gate low signals for example. The human ear has a logarithmic perception, so this  kind  of  crushing  is
       much more pleasant.  Logarithmic crushing is also able to get anti-aliased.

       The filter accepts the following options:

       <b>level_in</b>
           Set level in.

       <b>level_out</b>
           Set level out.

       <b>bits</b>
           Set bit reduction.

       <b>mix</b> Set mixing amount.

       <b>mode</b>
           Can be linear: "lin" or logarithmic: "log".

       <b>dc</b>  Set DC.

       <b>aa</b>  Set anti-aliasing.

       <b>samples</b>
           Set sample reduction.

       <b>lfo</b> Enable LFO. By default disabled.

       <b>lforange</b>
           Set LFO range.

       <b>lforate</b>
           Set LFO rate.

           as impulsive noise.

       <b>burst,</b> <b>b</b>
           Set burst fusion, in percentage of window size. Allowed range is 0 to 10. Default value is 2.  If any
           two samples detected as noise are spaced less than this value  then  any  sample  between  those  two
           samples will be also detected as noise.

           is 8 percent. This option also controls quality of interpolated samples using neighbour good samples.

       <b>threshold,</b> <b>t</b>
           Set threshold value. Allowed range is from 1 to 100.  Default value is 10. Higher  values  make  clip
           detection less aggressive.

       <b>hsize,</b> <b>n</b>
           Set  size  of  histogram  used  to detect clips. Allowed range is from 100 to 9999.  Default value is
           1000. Higher values make clip detection less aggressive.

       Samples in delayed channel are filled with silence.

       The filter accepts the following option:

       <b>delays</b>
           Set list of delays in milliseconds for each channel separated by '|'.  Unused delays will be silently
           ignored. If number of given delays is smaller than number of channels all remaining channels will not
           be delayed.  If you want to delay exact number of samples, append 'S' to number.  If you want instead
           to delay in seconds, append 's' to number.

       <b>all</b> Use last set delay for all remaining channels. By  default  is  disabled.   This  option  if  enabled
           changes how option "delays" is interpreted.

       <u>Examples</u>

   <b>aemphasis</b>
       Audio emphasis filter creates or restores material directly taken from LPs or emphased CDs with different
       filter  curves.  E.g.  to store music on vinyl the signal has to be altered by a filter first to even out
       the disadvantages of this recording medium.  Once the material is played back the inverse filter  has  to
       be applied to restore the distortion of the frequency response.

       The filter accepts the following options:

       <b>level_in</b>
           Set input gain.

       <b>level_out</b>
           Set output gain.

       <b>mode</b>
           Set  filter  mode.  For  restoring material use "reproduction" mode, otherwise use "production" mode.
           Default is "reproduction" mode.

       <b>type</b>
           Set filter type. Selects medium. Can be one of the following:

           <b>col</b> select Columbia.

           <b>emi</b> select EMI.

           <b>bsi</b> select BSI (78RPM).

           <b>riaa</b>
               select RIAA.

           <b>cd</b>  select Compact Disc (CD).

           <b>50fm</b>
               select 50µs (FM).

           <b>75fm</b>
               select 75µs (FM).

           <b>50kf</b>
               select 50µs (FM-KF).

           <b>75kf</b>
               select 75µs (FM-KF).

       <u>Commands</u>

       This filter supports the all above options as <b>commands</b>.

   <b>aeval</b>
       Modify an audio signal according to the specified expressions.

       This filter accepts one or more expressions (one for each channel),  which  are  evaluated  and  used  to
       modify a corresponding audio signal.

       It accepts the following parameters:

       <b>exprs</b>
           Set  the '|'-separated expressions list for each separate channel. If the number of input channels is
           greater than the number of expressions, the last specified  expression  is  used  for  the  remaining
           output channels.

       <b>channel_layout,</b> <b>c</b>
           Set  output  channel  layout.  If  not  specified,  the  channel layout is specified by the number of
           expressions. If set to <b>same</b>, it will use by default the same input channel layout.

       Each expression in <u>exprs</u> can contain the following constants and functions:

       <b>ch</b>  channel number of the current expression

       <b>n</b>   number of the evaluated sample, starting from 0

       <b>s</b>   sample rate

       <b>t</b>   time of the evaluated sample expressed in seconds

       <b>nb_in_channels</b>
       <b>nb_out_channels</b>

       <b>val(CH)</b>
           the value of input channel with number <u>CH</u>

       Note: this filter is slow. For faster processing you should use a dedicated filter.

       <u>Examples</u>

       •   Half volume:

                   aeval=val(ch)/2:c=same

       •   Invert phase of the second channel:

   <b>aexciter</b>
       An exciter is used to produce high sound that is not present in the original  signal.  This  is  done  by
       creating  harmonic  distortions  of  the  signal  which are restricted in range and added to the original
       signal.  An Exciter raises the upper end of an audio signal without simply raising the higher frequencies
       like an equalizer would do to create a more "crisp" or "brilliant" sound.

       The filter accepts the following options:

       <b>level_in</b>
           Set input level prior processing of signal.  Allowed range is from 0 to 64.  Default value is 1.

       <b>level_out</b>
           Set output level after processing of signal.  Allowed range is from 0 to 64.  Default value is 1.

       <b>amount</b>
           Set the amount of harmonics added to original signal.  Allowed range is from 0 to 64.  Default  value
           is 1.

       <b>drive</b>
           Set the amount of newly created harmonics.  Allowed range is from 0.1 to 10.  Default value is 8.5.

       <b>blend</b>
           Set the octave of newly created harmonics.  Allowed range is from -10 to 10.  Default value is 0.

       <b>freq</b>

           Default is 7500 Hz.

       <b>ceil</b>
           Set the upper frequency limit of producing harmonics.  Allowed range is from 9999 to  20000  Hz.   If
           value is lower than 10000 Hz no limit is applied.

       <b>listen</b>

   <b>afir</b>
       Apply an arbitrary Finite Impulse Response filter.

       This filter is designed for applying long FIR filters, up to 60 seconds long.

       It  can  be  used as component for digital crossover filters, room equalization, cross talk cancellation,
       wavefield synthesis, auralization, ambiophonics, ambisonics and spatialization.

       This filter uses the streams higher than first one as FIR coefficients.  If the non-first stream holds  a
       single  channel,  it  will  be  used  for all input channels in the first stream, otherwise the number of
       channels in the non-first stream must be same as the number of channels in the first stream.

       It accepts the following parameters:

       <b>dry</b> Set dry gain. This sets input gain.

       <b>wet</b> Set wet gain. This sets final output gain.

       This filter supports the all above options as <b>commands</b>.

   <b>afwtdn</b>
       Reduce broadband noise from input samples using Wavelets.

       A description of the accepted options follows.

       <b>sigma</b>
           Set  the  noise  sigma,  allowed  range  is  from  0 to 1.  Default value is 0.  This option controls
           strength of denoising applied to input samples.  Most useful way to set this option is via  decibels,
           eg. -45dB.

       <b>levels</b>
           Set  the number of wavelet levels of decomposition.  Allowed range is from 1 to 12.  Default value is
           10.  Setting this too low make denoising performance very poor.

       <b>wavet</b>
           Set wavelet type for decomposition of input frame.  They are sorted by number of  coefficients,  from
           lowest  to  highest.   More  coefficients  means  worse  filtering speed, but overall better quality.
           Available wavelets are:

           <b>sym2</b>
           <b>sym4</b>
           <b>rbior68</b>

           <b>sym10</b>
           <b>coif5</b>
           <b>bl3</b>
       <b>percent</b>
           Set percent of full denoising. Allowed range is from 0 to 100 percent.  Default value is  85  percent
           or partial denoising.

       <b>profile</b>
           If  enabled,  first  input  frame will be used as noise profile.  If first frame samples contain non-
           noise performance will be very poor.

       <b>adaptive</b>
           If enabled, input frames are analyzed for  presence  of  noise.   If  noise  is  detected  with  high
           possibility  then  input  frame profile will be used for processing following frames, until new noise
           frame is detected.

       <b>samples</b>
           Set size of single frame in number of samples. Allowed range is from 512 to 65536. Default frame size
           is 8192 samples.

           Set softness applied inside thresholding function. Allowed range is from 0 to 10. Default softness is
           1.

       <u>Commands</u>

       This filter supports the all above options as <b>commands</b>.

   <b>agate</b>
       A gate is mainly used to reduce lower  parts  of  a  signal.  This  kind  of  signal  processing  reduces
       disturbing noise between useful signals.

       Gating  is  done by detecting the volume below a chosen level <u>threshold</u> and dividing it by the factor set
       with <u>ratio</u>. The bottom of the noise floor is set via <u>range</u>. Because an exact manipulation of  the  signal
       would  cause  distortion of the waveform the reduction can be levelled over time. This is done by setting
       <u>attack</u> and <u>release</u>.

       <u>attack</u> determines how long the signal has to fall below the threshold before any reduction will occur and
       <u>release</u> sets the time the signal has to rise above the threshold to reduce the reduction again.   Shorter
       signals than the chosen attack time will be left untouched.

       <b>level_in</b>
           Set input level before filtering.  Default is 1. Allowed range is from 0.015625 to 64.

       <b>mode</b>
           Set  the mode of operation. Can be "upward" or "downward".  Default is "downward". If set to "upward"
           mode, higher parts of signal  will  be  amplified,  expanding  dynamic  range  in  upward  direction.
           Otherwise, in case of "downward" lower parts of signal will be reduced.

       <b>range</b>
           Set  the level of gain reduction when the signal is below the threshold.  Default is 0.06125. Allowed
           range is from 0 to 1.  Setting this to 0 disables reduction and then filter behaves like expander.

       <b>threshold</b>
           If a signal rises above this level the gain reduction is released.  Default is 0.125.  Allowed  range
           is from 0 to 1.

       <b>ratio</b>
           Set a ratio by which the signal is reduced.  Default is 2. Allowed range is from 1 to 9000.

       <b>attack</b>
           Amount  of  milliseconds  the  signal  has  to  rise above the threshold before gain reduction stops.
           Default is 20 milliseconds. Allowed range is from 0.01 to 9000.

       <b>release</b>
           Amount of milliseconds the signal has to fall below the threshold before the reduction  is  increased
           again. Default is 250 milliseconds.  Allowed range is from 0.01 to 9000.

       <b>makeup</b>
           Set amount of amplification of signal after processing.  Default is 1. Allowed range is from 1 to 64.

       <b>knee</b>
           Curve  the  sharp  knee  around  the  threshold  to  enter  gain  reduction  more softly.  Default is
           2.828427125. Allowed range is from 1 to 8.

       <b>detection</b>
           Choose if exact signal should be taken for detection or an RMS like one.  Default is  "rms".  Can  be
           "peak" or "rms".

       <b>link</b>
           Choose  if  the  average  level  between  all  channels  or the louder channel affects the reduction.
           Default is "average". Can be "average" or "maximum".

   <b>alimiter</b>
       The limiter prevents an input signal from rising over a desired threshold.  This limiter  uses  lookahead
       technology to prevent your signal from distorting.  It means that there is a small delay after the signal
       is processed. Keep in mind that the delay it produces is the attack time you set.

       The filter accepts the following options:

       <b>level_in</b>
           Set input gain. Default is 1.

       <b>level_out</b>
           Set output gain. Default is 1.

       <b>limit</b>
           Don't let signals above this level pass the limiter. Default is 1.

       <b>attack</b>
           The  limiter  will  reach  its attenuation level in this amount of time in milliseconds. Default is 5
           milliseconds.

       <b>release</b>
           Come back from  limiting  to  attenuation  1.0  in  this  amount  of  milliseconds.   Default  is  50
           milliseconds.

       <b>asc</b> When gain reduction is always needed ASC takes care of releasing to an average reduction level rather
           than reaching a reduction of 0 in the release time.

       <b>asc_level</b>
           Select  how much the release time is affected by ASC, 0 means nearly no changes in release time while
           1 produces higher release times.

       <b>level</b>
           Auto level output signal. Default is enabled.  This normalizes audio back to 0dB if enabled.

       <b>latency</b>
           Compensate the delay introduced by using the lookahead buffer set with attack parameter.  Also  flush
           the valid audio data in the lookahead buffer when the stream hits EOF.

       Depending  on  picked  setting  it  is recommended to upsample input 2x or 4x times with <b>aresample</b> before
       applying this filter.

   <b>allpass</b>
       Apply a two-pole all-pass filter with central frequency (in Hz) <u>frequency</u>, and  filter-width  <u>width</u>.   An

       <b>width_type,</b> <b>t</b>
           Change allpass width_type.  Syntax for the command is : "<u>width_type</u>"

       <b>width,</b> <b>w</b>
           Change allpass width.  Syntax for the command is : "<u>width</u>"

       <b>mix,</b> <b>m</b>
           Change allpass mix.  Syntax for the command is : "<u>mix</u>"

   <b>aloop</b>
       Loop audio samples.

       The filter accepts the following options:

       <b>loop</b>
           Set the number of loops. Setting this value to -1 will result in infinite loops.  Default is 0.

       <b>size</b>
           Set maximal number of samples. Default is 0.

       <b>start</b>
           Set first sample of loop. Default is 0.

       <b>time</b>
           Set the time of loop start in seconds.  Only used if option named <u>start</u> is set to -1.

   <b>amerge</b>
       Merge two or more audio streams into a single multi-channel stream.

       The filter accepts the following options:

       <b>inputs</b>
           Set the number of inputs. Default is 2.

       If the channel layouts of the inputs are disjoint, and therefore compatible, the channel  layout  of  the
       output will be set accordingly and the channels will be reordered as necessary. If the channel layouts of
       the  inputs  are  not  disjoint,  the  output  will have all the channels of the first input then all the
       channels of the second input, in that order, and the channel layout of the output  will  be  the  default
       value corresponding to the total number of channels.

       For  example,  if  the first input is in 2.1 (FL+FR+LF) and the second input is FC+BL+BR, then the output
       will be in 5.1, with the channels in the following order: a1, a2, b1, a3, b2, b3 (a1 is the first channel
       of the first input, b1 is the first channel of the second input).

       On the other hand, if both input are in stereo, the output channels will be in the default order: a1, a2,
       b1, b2, and the channel layout will be arbitrarily set to 4.0, which may  or  may  not  be  the  expected
       value.

       All inputs must have the same sample rate, and format.

       If inputs do not have the same duration, the output will stop with the shortest.

       <u>Examples</u>

       •   Merge two mono files into a stereo stream:

                   amovie=left.wav [l] ; amovie=right.mp3 [r] ; [l] [r] amerge

       •   Multiple merges assuming 1 video stream and 6 audio streams in <u>input.mkv</u>:

                   ffmpeg -i input.mkv -filter_complex "[0:1][0:2][0:3][0:4][0:5][0:6] amerge=inputs=6" -c:a pcm_s16le output.mkv

   <b>amix</b>
       Mixes multiple audio inputs into a single output.

       Note  that  this  filter  only  supports  float  samples  (the  <u>amerge</u> and <u>pan</u> audio filters support many
       formats). If the <u>amix</u> input has integer samples then <b>aresample</b> will be automatically inserted to  perform
       the conversion to float samples.

       It accepts the following parameters:

       <b>inputs</b>
           The number of inputs. If unspecified, it defaults to 2.

       <b>duration</b>
           How to determine the end-of-stream.

           <b>longest</b>
               The duration of the longest input. (default)

           <b>shortest</b>
               The duration of the shortest input.

           <b>first</b>
               The duration of the first input.

       <b>dropout_transition</b>
           The  transition  time,  in seconds, for volume renormalization when an input stream ends. The default
           value is 2 seconds.

       <b>weights</b>
           Specify weight of each input audio stream as a sequence of numbers separated by  a  space.  If  fewer
           weights  are  specified  compared  to  number of inputs, the last weight is assigned to the remaining
           inputs.  Default weight for each input is 1.

       <b>normalize</b>
           Always scale inputs instead of only doing summation of samples.  Beware of heavy clipping  if  inputs
           are  not normalized prior or after filtering by this filter if this option is disabled. By default is
           enabled.

       <u>Examples</u>

       •   This will mix 3 input audio streams to a single output with the same duration as the first input  and
           a dropout transition time of 3 seconds:

                   ffmpeg -i INPUT1 -i INPUT2 -i INPUT3 -filter_complex amix=inputs=3:duration=first:dropout_transition=3 OUTPUT

       •   This will mix one vocal and one music input audio stream to a single output with the same duration as
           the  longest  input.  The  music  will  have quarter the weight as the vocals, and the inputs are not
           normalized:

                   ffmpeg -i VOCALS -i MUSIC -filter_complex amix=inputs=2:duration=longest:dropout_transition=0:weights="1 0.25":normalize=0 OUTPUT

       <u>Commands</u>

       This filter supports the following commands:

       <b>weights</b>
       <b>normalize</b>
           Syntax is same as option with same name.

   <b>amultiply</b>
       Multiply first audio  stream  with  second  audio  stream  and  store  result  in  output  audio  stream.
       Multiplication  is  done  by  multiplying each sample from first stream with sample at same position from
       second stream.

       With this element-wise multiplication one can create amplitude fades and amplitude modulations.

   <b>anequalizer</b>
       High-order parametric multiband equalizer for each channel.

       It accepts the following parameters:

       <b>params</b>
           This option string is in format: "c<u>chn</u> f=<u>cf</u> w=<u>w</u> g=<u>g</u> t=<u>f</u> | ..."  Each equalizer band is  separated  by
           '|'.

           <b>chn</b> Set channel number to which equalization will be applied.  If input doesn't have that channel the
               entry is ignored.

           <b>f</b>   Set central frequency for band.  If input doesn't have that frequency the entry is ignored.

           <b>w</b>   Set band width in Hertz.

           <b>g</b>   Set band gain in dB.

           <b>t</b>   Set filter type for band, optional, can be:

               <b>0</b>   Butterworth, this is default.

               <b>1</b>   Chebyshev type 1.

               <b>2</b>   Chebyshev type 2.

       <b>curves</b>
           With this option activated frequency response of anequalizer is displayed in video stream.

       <b>size</b>
           Set video stream size. Only useful if curves option is activated.

       <b>mgain</b>
           Set  max  gain  that will be displayed. Only useful if curves option is activated.  Setting this to a
           reasonable value makes it possible to display gain which is derived from neighbour  bands  which  are
           too close to each other and thus produce higher gain when both are activated.

       <b>fscale</b>
           Set  frequency  scale used to draw frequency response in video output.  Can be linear or logarithmic.
           Default is logarithmic.

       <b>colors</b>
           Set color for each channel curve which is going to be displayed in video stream.   This  is  list  of
           color  names  separated by space or by '|'.  Unrecognised or missing colors will be replaced by white
           color.

       <u>Examples</u>

       •   Lower gain by 10 of central frequency 200Hz and width 100 Hz for first  2  channels  using  Chebyshev
           type 1 filter:

       <u>Commands</u>

       This filter supports the following commands:

       <b>change</b>
           Alter existing filter parameters.  Syntax for the commands is : "<u>fN</u>|f=<u>freq</u>|w=<u>width</u>|g=<u>gain</u>"

           <u>fN</u>  is  existing  filter  number,  starting from 0, if no such filter is available error is returned.
           <u>freq</u> set new frequency parameter.  <u>width</u> set new  width  parameter  in  Hertz.   <u>gain</u>  set  new  gain
           parameter in dB.

       <u>Examples</u>

       •   One of many usages of this filter is noise reduction, input audio is filtered with same samples  that
           are delayed by fixed amount, one such example for stereo audio is:

                   asplit[a][b],[a]adelay=32S|32S[a],[b][a]anlms=order=128:leakage=0.0005:mu=.5:out_mode=o

       <u>Commands</u>

       This filter supports the same commands as options, excluding option "order".

   <b>anull</b>
       Pass the audio source unchanged to the output.

   <b>apad</b>
       Pad the end of an audio stream with silence.

       This  can  be used together with <b>ffmpeg</b> <b>-shortest</b> to extend audio streams to the same length as the video
       stream.

       A description of the accepted options follows.

       <b>packet_size</b>
           Set silence packet size. Default value is 4096.

       <b>pad_len</b>
           Set the number of samples of silence to add to the end. After the value is  reached,  the  stream  is
           terminated. This option is mutually exclusive with <b>whole_len</b>.

       <b>whole_len</b>
           Set  the  minimum total number of samples in the output audio stream. If the value is longer than the
           input audio length, silence is added to the end, until the value is reached. This option is  mutually
           exclusive with <b>pad_len</b>.

       <b>pad_dur</b>
           Specify  the  duration  of  samples  of  silence  to  add.  See  <b>the</b>  <b>Time</b>  <b>duration</b>  <b>section</b>  <b>in</b> <b>the</b>
           <b><a href="../man1/ffmpeg-utils.1.html">ffmpeg-utils</a>(1)</b> <b>manual</b> for the accepted syntax. Used only if set to non-negative value.

       <b>whole_dur</b>
           Specify the minimum total duration in the output audio stream. See <b>the</b> <b>Time</b> <b>duration</b> <b>section</b>  <b>in</b>  <b>the</b>
           <b><a href="../man1/ffmpeg-utils.1.html">ffmpeg-utils</a>(1)</b>  <b>manual</b> for the accepted syntax. Used only if set to non-negative value. If the value
           is longer than the input audio length, silence is added to the end, until the value is reached.  This
           option is mutually exclusive with <b>pad_dur</b>

       If neither the <b>pad_len</b> nor the <b>whole_len</b> nor <b>pad_dur</b> nor <b>whole_dur</b> option is set,  the  filter  will  add
       silence to the end of the input stream indefinitely.

       Note  that  for  ffmpeg 4.4 and earlier a zero <b>pad_dur</b> or <b>whole_dur</b> also caused the filter to add silence
       indefinitely.

       <u>Examples</u>

       •   Add 1024 samples of silence to the end of the input:

                   apad=pad_len=1024

       •   Make sure the audio output will contain at least  10000  samples,  pad  the  input  with  silence  if
           required:

                   apad=whole_len=10000

       •   Use  <b>ffmpeg</b>  to  pad  the  audio  input with silence, so that the video stream will always result the
           shortest and will be converted until the end in the output file when using the <b>shortest</b> option:

                   ffmpeg -i VIDEO -i AUDIO -filter_complex "[1:0]apad" -shortest OUTPUT

   <b>aphaser</b>
       Add a phasing effect to the input audio.

       A phaser filter creates series of peaks and troughs in the frequency spectrum.  The position of the peaks
       and troughs are modulated so that they vary over time, creating a sweeping effect.

       <u>Commands</u>

       This filter supports the all above options as <b>commands</b>.

   <b>apulsator</b>
       Audio pulsator is something between an autopanner and a tremolo.  But it can produce funny stereo effects
       as well. Pulsator changes the volume of the left  and  right  channel  based  on  a  LFO  (low  frequency
       oscillator)  with  different  waveforms  and  shifted  phases.  This filter have the ability to define an
       offset between left and right channel. An offset of 0 means that both LFO shapes match each  other.   The
       left  and  right  channel  are altered equally - a conventional tremolo.  An offset of 50% means that the
       shape of the right channel is exactly shifted in phase (or moved backwards about half of the frequency) -
       pulsator acts as an autopanner. At 1 both curves match again. Every setting in between  moves  the  phase
       shift  gapless  between all stages and produces some "bypassing" sounds with sine and triangle waveforms.
       The more you set the offset near 1 (starting from the 0.5) the faster the signal passes from the left  to
       the right speaker.

       The filter accepts the following options:

       <b>level_in</b>
           Set input gain. By default it is 1. Range is [0.015625 - 64].

       <b>level_out</b>
           Set output gain. By default it is 1. Range is [0.015625 - 64].

       <b>mode</b>
           Set waveform shape the LFO will use. Can be one of: sine, triangle, square, sawup or sawdown. Default
           is sine.

       <b>amount</b>
           Set modulation. Define how much of original signal is affected by the LFO.

       <b>offset_l</b>
           Set left channel offset. Default is 0. Allowed range is [0 - 1].

       <b>offset_r</b>
           Set right channel offset. Default is 0.5. Allowed range is [0 - 1].

       <b>width</b>
           Set pulse width. Default is 1. Allowed range is [0 - 2].

       <b>timing</b>
           Set possible timing mode. Can be one of: bpm, ms or hz. Default is hz.

       <b>bpm</b> Set bpm. Default is 120. Allowed range is [30 - 300]. Only used if timing is set to bpm.

       <b>ms</b>  Set ms. Default is 500. Allowed range is [10 - 2000]. Only used if timing is set to ms.

       <b>hz</b>  Set frequency in Hz. Default is 2. Allowed range is [0.01 - 100]. Only used if timing is set to hz.

   <b>aresample</b>
       Resample  the  input  audio  to  the  specified  parameters, using the libswresample library. If none are
       specified then the filter will automatically convert between its input and output.

       This filter is also able to stretch/squeeze the audio data to make it match the timestamps or  to  inject
       silence / cut out audio to make it match the timestamps, do a combination of both or do neither.

       The  filter accepts the syntax [<u>sample_rate</u>:]<u>resampler_options</u>, where <u>sample_rate</u> expresses a sample rate
       and <u>resampler_options</u> is a list of <u>key</u>=<u>value</u> pairs, separated by ":". See the <b>"Resampler</b> <b>Options"</b> <b>section</b>
       <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b><a href="../man1/ffmpeg-resampler.1.html">ffmpeg-resampler</a>(1)</b> <b>manual</b> for the complete list of supported options.

       <u>Examples</u>

       •   Resample the input audio to 44100Hz:

                   aresample=44100

       •   Stretch/squeeze samples to  the  given  timestamps,  with  a  maximum  of  1000  samples  per  second
           compensation:

                   aresample=async=1000

   <b>areverse</b>
       Reverse an audio clip.

       Warning: This filter requires memory to buffer the entire clip, so trimming is suggested.

       <u>Examples</u>

       •   Take the first 5 seconds of a clip, and reverse it.

                   atrim=end=5,areverse

       This  filter  takes  two  audio streams for input, and outputs first audio stream.  Results are in dB per
       channel at end of either input.

   <b>asetnsamples</b>
       Set the number of samples per each output audio frame.

       The last output packet may contain a different number of samples,  as  the  filter  will  flush  all  the
       remaining samples when the input audio signals its end.

       The filter accepts the following options:

       <b>nb_out_samples,</b> <b>n</b>
           Set the number of frames per each output audio frame. The number is intended as the number of samples
           <u>per</u> <u>each</u> <u>channel</u>.  Default value is 1024.

       <b>pad,</b> <b>p</b>
           If  set  to  1,  the  filter  will  pad the last audio frame with zeroes, so that the last frame will
           contain the same number of samples as the previous ones. Default value is 1.

       For example, to set the number of per-frame samples to 1234 and disable padding for the last frame, use:

               asetnsamples=n=1234:p=0

   <b>asetrate</b>
       Set the sample rate without altering the PCM data.  This will result in a change of speed and pitch.

       The filter accepts the following options:

       <b>sample_rate,</b> <b>r</b>
           Set the output sample rate. Default is 44100 Hz.

   <b>ashowinfo</b>
       Show a line containing various information for each input audio frame.  The input audio is not modified.

   <b>atempo</b>
       Adjust audio tempo.

       The  filter  accepts exactly one parameter, the audio tempo. If not specified then the filter will assume
       nominal 1.0 tempo. Tempo must be in the [0.5, 100.0] range.

       Note that tempo greater than 2 will skip some samples rather than blend them in.  If for any reason  this
       is  a  concern  it  is  always possible to daisy-chain several instances of atempo to achieve the desired
       product tempo.

       <u>Examples</u>

                   atempo=0.8

       •   To speed up audio to 300% tempo:

                   atempo=3

       •   To speed up audio to 300% tempo by daisy-chaining two atempo instances:

       <u>Commands</u>

       This filter supports the all above options as <b>commands</b>.

   <b>atrim</b>
       Trim the input so that the output contains one continuous subpart of the input.

       It accepts the following parameters:

       <b>start</b>
           Timestamp (in seconds) of the start of the section to keep. I.e. the audio sample with the  timestamp
           <u>start</u> will be the first sample in the output.

       <b>end</b> Specify  time  of  the  first  audio  sample  that will be dropped, i.e. the audio sample immediately
           preceding the one with the timestamp <u>end</u> will be the last sample in the output.

       <b>start_pts</b>
           Same as <u>start</u>, except this option sets the start timestamp in samples instead of seconds.

       <b>end_pts</b>
           Same as <u>end</u>, except this option sets the end timestamp in samples instead of seconds.

       <b>duration</b>
           The maximum duration of the output in seconds.

       <b>start_sample</b>
           The number of the first sample that should be output.

       <b>end_sample</b>
           The number of the first sample that should be dropped.

       <b>start</b>, <b>end</b>, and <b>duration</b> are expressed as time duration specifications; see <b>the</b> <b>Time</b> <b>duration</b> <b>section</b>  <b>in</b>
       <b>the</b> <b><a href="../man1/ffmpeg-utils.1.html">ffmpeg-utils</a>(1)</b> <b>manual</b>.

       Note  that  the  first  two  sets  of  the  start/end  options  and the <b>duration</b> option look at the frame
       timestamp, while the _sample  options  simply  count  the  samples  that  pass  through  the  filter.  So
       start/end_pts  and start/end_sample will give different results when the timestamps are wrong, inexact or
       do not start at zero. Also note that this filter does not modify the timestamps. If you wish to have  the
       output timestamps start at zero, insert the asetpts filter after the atrim filter.

       If  multiple start or end options are set, this filter tries to be greedy and keep all samples that match
       at least one of the specified constraints. To keep only the part that  matches  all  the  constraints  at
       once, chain multiple atrim filters.

       The  defaults  are such that all the input is kept. So it is possible to set e.g.  just the end values to
       keep everything before the specified time.

       Examples:

       •   Drop everything except the second minute of input:

                   ffmpeg -i INPUT -af atrim=60:120

       •   Keep only the first 1000 samples:

                   ffmpeg -i INPUT -af atrim=end_sample=1000

   <b>axcorrelate</b>
       Calculate normalized windowed cross-correlation between two input audio streams.

       Resulted samples are always between -1 and 1 inclusive.  If result is 1 it means two  input  samples  are
       highly correlated in that selected segment.  Result 0 means they are not correlated at all.  If result is
       -1 it means two input samples are out of phase, which means they cancel each other.

       The filter accepts the following options:

       <b>size</b>
           Set  size  of  segment  over which cross-correlation is calculated.  Default is 256. Allowed range is
           from 2 to 131072.

       <b>algo</b>
           Set algorithm for cross-correlation. Can be "slow" or "fast" or  "best".   Default  is  "best".  Fast
           algorithm  assumes  mean  values  over  any  given  segment  are  always zero and thus need much less
           calculations to make.  This is generally not true, but is valid for typical audio streams.

       <u>Examples</u>

       •   Calculate correlation between channels in stereo audio stream:

                   ffmpeg -i stereo.wav -af channelsplit,axcorrelate=size=1024:algo=fast correlation.wav

   <b>bandpass</b>
       Apply a two-pole Butterworth band-pass filter with central frequency  <u>frequency</u>,  and  (3dB-point)  band-
       width  width.   The  <u>csg</u>  option  selects  a  constant skirt gain (peak gain = Q) instead of the default:
       constant 0dB peak gain.  The filter roll off at 6dB per octave (20dB per decade).

       The filter accepts the following options:

       <b>frequency,</b> <b>f</b>
           Set the filter's central frequency. Default is 3000.

       <b>csg</b> Constant skirt gain if set to 1. Defaults to 0.

           than  impulse  response  length truncated when reaches near zero values) filtering will become linear
           phase otherwise if not big enough it will just produce nasty artifacts.

   <b>bs2b</b>
       Bauer stereo to binaural transformation, which improves headphone listening of stereo audio records.

       To enable compilation of this filter you need to configure FFmpeg with "--enable-libbs2b".

       It accepts the following parameters:

       <b>profile</b>
           Pre-defined crossfeed level.

           <b>default</b>
               Default level (fcut=700, feed=50).

           <b>cmoy</b>
               Chu Moy circuit (fcut=700, feed=60).

           <b>jmeier</b>
               Jan Meier circuit (fcut=650, feed=95).

       <b>fcut</b>
           Cut frequency (in Hz).

       <b>feed</b>
           Feed level (in Hz).

   <b>channelmap</b>
       Remap input channels to new locations.

       It accepts the following parameters:

       <b>map</b> Map  channels  from  input  to  output. The argument is a '|'-separated list of mappings, each in the
           "<u>in_channel</u>-<u>out_channel</u>" or "<u>in_channel</u>" form. <u>in_channel</u> can be either the name of the input channel
           (e.g. FL for front left) or its index in the input channel layout. <u>out_channel</u> is  the  name  of  the
           output  channel  or  its  index  in the output channel layout. If <u>out_channel</u> is not given then it is
           implicitly an index, starting with zero and increasing by one  for  each  mapping.  Mixing  different
           types of mappings is not allowed and will result in a parse error.

       <b>channel_layout</b>
           The  channel  layout  of  the output stream. If not specified, then filter will guess it based on the
           <u>out_channel</u> names or the number of mappings.  Guessed layouts will not necessarily  contain  channels
           in the order of the mappings.

       If  no  mapping  is present, the filter will implicitly map input channels to output channels, preserving
       indices.

       <u>Examples</u>

       •   For example, assuming a 5.1+downmix input MOV file,

                   ffmpeg -i in.mov -filter 'channelmap=map=DL-FL|DR-FR' out.wav

           will create an output WAV file tagged as stereo from the downmix channels of the input.

       •   To fix a 5.1 WAV improperly encoded in AAC's native channel order

                   ffmpeg -i in.wav -filter 'channelmap=1|2|0|5|3|4:5.1' out.wav

   <b>channelsplit</b>
       Split each channel from an input audio stream into a separate output stream.

       It accepts the following parameters:

       <b>channel_layout</b>
           The channel layout of the input stream. The default is "stereo".

       <b>channels</b>
           A channel layout describing the channels to be extracted as  separate  output  streams  or  "all"  to
           extract each input channel as a separate stream. The default is "all".

           Choosing channels not present in channel layout in the input will result in an error.

       <u>Examples</u>

       •   For example, assuming a stereo input MP3 file,

                   ffmpeg -i in.mp3 -filter_complex channelsplit out.mkv

           will  create an output Matroska file with two audio streams, one containing only the left channel and
           the other the right channel.

       •   Split a 5.1 WAV file into per-channel files:

                   ffmpeg -i in.wav -filter_complex
                   'channelsplit=channel_layout=5.1[FL][FR][FC][LFE][SL][SR]'
                   -map '[FL]' front_left.wav -map '[FR]' front_right.wav -map '[FC]'
                   front_center.wav -map '[LFE]' lfe.wav -map '[SL]' side_left.wav -map '[SR]'
                   side_right.wav

       •   Extract only LFE from a 5.1 WAV file:

                   ffmpeg -i in.wav -filter_complex 'channelsplit=channel_layout=5.1:channels=LFE[LFE]'
                   -map '[LFE]' lfe.wav

   <b>chorus</b>
       Add a chorus effect to the audio.

       Can make a single vocal sound like a chorus, but can also be applied to instrumentation.

       Chorus resembles an echo effect with a short delay, but whereas with echo the  delay  is  constant,  with
       chorus,  it  is varied using using sinusoidal or triangular modulation.  The modulation depth defines the
       range the modulated delay is played before or after the delay. Hence the delayed sound will sound  slower
       or  faster,  that  is the delayed sound tuned around the original one, like in a chorus where some vocals
       are slightly off key.

       It accepts the following parameters:

       <b>in_gain</b>
           Set input gain. Default is 0.4.

       <b>out_gain</b>
           Set output gain. Default is 0.4.

       <b>delays</b>
           Set delays. A typical delay is around 40ms to 60ms.

       <b>decays</b>
           Set decays.

       <b>speeds</b>
           Set speeds.

       <b>depths</b>
           Set depths.

       <u>Examples</u>

       •   A single delay:

                   chorus=0.7:0.9:55:0.4:0.25:2

       •   Two delays:

                   chorus=0.6:0.9:50|60:0.4|0.32:0.25|0.4:2|1.3

       •   Fuller sounding chorus with three delays:

                   chorus=0.5:0.9:50|60|40:0.4|0.32|0.3:0.25|0.4|0.3:2|2.3|1.3

   <b>compand</b>
       Compress or expand the audio's dynamic range.

       It accepts the following parameters:

       <b>attacks</b>
       <b>decays</b>
           A list of times in seconds for each channel over which the instantaneous level of the input signal is
           averaged to determine its volume. <u>attacks</u> refers to increase of volume and <u>decays</u> refers to  decrease
           of  volume.  For  most  situations,  the attack time (response to the audio getting louder) should be
           shorter than the decay time, because the human ear is more sensitive to sudden loud audio than sudden
           soft audio. A typical value for attack is 0.3 seconds and a typical value for decay is  0.8  seconds.
           If  specified  number of attacks &amp; decays is lower than number of channels, the last set attack/decay
           will be used for all remaining channels.

       <b>points</b>
           A list of points for the transfer function, specified in dB relative to the maximum  possible  signal
           amplitude.  Each key points list must be defined using the following syntax: "x0/y0|x1/y1|x2/y2|...."
           or "x0/y0 x1/y1 x2/y2 ...."

           The input values must be in strictly increasing order but the transfer function does not have  to  be
           monotonically  rising.  The  point  "0/0"  is assumed but may be overridden (by "0/out-dBn"). Typical
           values for the transfer function are "-70/-70|-60/-20|1/0".

       <b>soft-knee</b>
           Set the curve radius in dB for all joints. It defaults to 0.01.

       <b>gain</b>
           Set the additional gain in dB to be applied at all points on the transfer function. This  allows  for
           easy adjustment of the overall gain.  It defaults to 0.

       <b>volume</b>
           Set  an initial volume, in dB, to be assumed for each channel when filtering starts. This permits the
           user to supply a nominal level initially, so that, for example, a very large gain is not  applied  to
           initial  signal levels before the companding has begun to operate. A typical value for audio which is
           initially quiet is -90 dB. It defaults to 0.

       <b>delay</b>
           Set a delay, in seconds. The input audio is analyzed immediately, but audio is delayed  before  being
           fed  to  the volume adjuster. Specifying a delay approximately equal to the attack/decay times allows
           the filter to effectively operate in predictive rather than reactive mode. It defaults to 0.

       <u>Examples</u>

       •   Make music with both quiet and loud passages suitable for listening to in a noisy environment:

   <b>compensationdelay</b>
       Compensation Delay Line is a metric based delay to  compensate  differing  positions  of  microphones  or
       speakers.

       For  example,  you  have  recorded guitar with two microphones placed in different locations. Because the
       front of sound wave has fixed speed in normal conditions, the phasing of microphones can vary and depends
       on their location and interposition. The best sound mix can be achieved when  these  microphones  are  in
       phase (synchronized). Note that a distance of ~30 cm between microphones makes one microphone capture the
       signal  in antiphase to the other microphone. That makes the final mix sound moody.  This filter helps to
       solve phasing problems by adding different delays to each microphone track and make them synchronized.

       The best result can be reached when you take one track as base and synchronize other tracks  one  by  one
       with it.  Remember that synchronization/delay tolerance depends on sample rate, too.  Higher sample rates
       will give more tolerance.

       The filter accepts the following parameters:

       <b>mm</b>  Set millimeters distance. This is compensation distance for fine tuning.  Default is 0.

       <b>cm</b>  Set cm distance. This is compensation distance for tightening distance setup.  Default is 0.

       <b>m</b>   Set meters distance. This is compensation distance for hard distance setup.  Default is 0.

       <b>dry</b> Set dry amount. Amount of unprocessed (dry) signal.  Default is 0.

       <b>wet</b> Set wet amount. Amount of processed (wet) signal.  Default is 1.

       <b>temp</b>
           Set temperature in degrees Celsius. This is the temperature of the environment.  Default is 20.

       <u>Commands</u>

       This filter supports the all above options as <b>commands</b>.

   <b>crossfeed</b>
       Apply headphone crossfeed filter.

       Crossfeed is the process of blending the left and right channels of stereo audio recording.  It is mainly
       used to reduce extreme stereo separation of low frequencies.

       The intent is to produce more speaker like sound to the listener.

       The filter accepts the following options:

       <b>strength</b>
           Set strength of crossfeed. Default is 0.2. Allowed range is from 0 to 1.  This sets gain of low shelf
           filter  for side part of stereo image.  Default is -6dB. Max allowed is -30db when strength is set to
           1.

       <b>range</b>
           Set soundstage wideness. Default is 0.5. Allowed range is from 0 to 1.  This sets cut  off  frequency
           of low shelf filter. Default is cut off near 1550 Hz. With range set to 1 cut off frequency is set to
           2100 Hz.

       <b>slope</b>
           Set curve slope of low shelf filter. Default is 0.5.  Allowed range is from 0.01 to 1.

       <b>level_in</b>
           Set input gain. Default is 0.9.

       <b>level_out</b>
           Set output gain. Default is 1.

       <b>block_size</b>
           Set  block  size  used  for reverse IIR processing. If this value is set to high enough value (higher
           than impulse response length truncated when reaches near zero values) filtering  will  become  linear
           phase otherwise if not big enough it will just produce nasty artifacts.

           Note that filter delay will be exactly this many samples when set to non-zero value.

       Simple algorithm for audio noise sharpening.

       This filter linearly increases differences between each audio sample.

       The filter accepts the following options:

       <b>i</b>   Sets the intensity of effect (default: 2.0). Must be in range between -10.0 to 0 (unchanged sound) to
           10.0 (maximum effect).  To inverse filtering use negative value.

       <b>c</b>   Enable clipping. By default is enabled.

       <u>Commands</u>

       This filter supports the all above options as <b>commands</b>.

   <b>dcshift</b>
       Apply a DC shift to the audio.

       This  can  be  useful to remove a DC offset (caused perhaps by a hardware problem in the recording chain)
       from the audio. The effect of a DC offset is reduced headroom and hence volume. The <b>astats</b> filter can  be
       used to determine if a signal has a DC offset.

       <b>shift</b>
           Set the DC shift, allowed range is [-1, 1]. It indicates the amount to shift the audio.

       <b>limitergain</b>
           Optional.  It  should  have  a  value  much  less  than  1 (e.g. 0.05 or 0.02) and is used to prevent
           clipping.

   <b>deesser</b>
       Apply de-essing to the audio samples.

       <b>i</b>   Set intensity for triggering de-essing. Allowed range is from 0 to 1.  Default is 0.

       <b>m</b>   Set amount of ducking on treble part of sound. Allowed range is from 0 to 1.  Default is 0.5.

       <b>f</b>   How much of original frequency content to keep when de-essing. Allowed range is from 0 to 1.  Default
           is 0.5.

       <b>s</b>   Set the output mode.

           It accepts the following values:

           <b>i</b>   Pass input unchanged.

           <b>o</b>   Pass ess filtered out.

           <b>e</b>   Pass only ess.

               Default value is <u>o</u>.

   <b>dialoguenhance</b>
       Enhance dialogue in stereo audio.

       This filter accepts stereo input and produce surround (3.0) channels output.  The  newly  produced  front
       center  channel  have enhanced speech dialogue originally available in both stereo channels.  This filter
       outputs front left and front right channels same as available in stereo input.

       The filter accepts the following options:

       <b>original</b>
           Set the original center factor to keep in front center channel output.  Allowed range is from 0 to 1.
           Default value is 1.

       <b>enhance</b>
           Set the dialogue enhance factor to put in front center channel output.  Allowed range is from 0 to 3.
           Default value is 1.

       <b>voice</b>
           Set the voice detection factor.  Allowed range is from 2 to 32. Default value is 2.

       <u>Commands</u>

       This filter supports the all above options as <b>commands</b>.

   <b>drmeter</b>
       Measure audio dynamic range.

       DR values of 14 and higher is found in very dynamic material. DR of  8  to  13  is  found  in  transition
       material. And anything less that 8 have very poor dynamics and is very compressed.

       The filter accepts the following options:

       <b>length</b>
           Set  window  length  in  seconds  used  to  split  audio into segments of equal length.  Default is 3
           seconds.

   <b>dynaudnorm</b>
       Dynamic Audio Normalizer.

       This filter applies a certain amount of gain to the input audio in order to bring its peak magnitude to a
       target level (e.g. 0 dBFS). However, in contrast to more "simple" normalization algorithms,  the  Dynamic
       Audio  Normalizer  *dynamically* re-adjusts the gain factor to the input audio.  This allows for applying
       extra gain to the "quiet" sections of the  audio  while  avoiding  distortions  or  clipping  the  "loud"
       sections.  In  other  words:  The  Dynamic  Audio Normalizer will "even out" the volume of quiet and loud
       sections, in the sense that the volume of each section  is  brought  to  the  same  target  level.  Note,
       however,  that  the  Dynamic  Audio  Normalizer  achieves  this  goal  *without*  applying "dynamic range
       compressing". It will retain 100% of the dynamic range *within* each section of the audio file.

       <b>framelen,</b> <b>f</b>
           Set the frame length in milliseconds. In  range  from  10  to  8000  milliseconds.   Default  is  500
           milliseconds.  The Dynamic Audio Normalizer processes the input audio in small chunks, referred to as
           frames.  This  is  required,  because a peak magnitude has no meaning for just a single sample value.
           Instead, we need to determine the peak magnitude for a contiguous sequence of sample values. While  a
           "standard"  normalizer  would  simply  use the peak magnitude of the complete file, the Dynamic Audio
           Normalizer determines the peak magnitude individually for each  frame.  The  length  of  a  frame  is
           specified  in  milliseconds.  By  default,  the  Dynamic  Audio Normalizer uses a frame length of 500
           milliseconds, which has been found to give good results with most files.  Note that the  exact  frame
           length,  in  number  of  samples, will be determined automatically, based on the sampling rate of the
           individual input audio file.

       <b>gausssize,</b> <b>g</b>
           Set the Gaussian filter window size. In range from 3 to 301, must  be  odd  number.  Default  is  31.
           Probably  the  most  important  parameter of the Dynamic Audio Normalizer is the "window size" of the
           Gaussian smoothing filter. The filter's window size is  specified  in  frames,  centered  around  the
           current  frame.  For  the  sake  of simplicity, this must be an odd number. Consequently, the default
           value of 31 takes into account the current frame, as well as the  15  preceding  frames  and  the  15
           subsequent frames. Using a larger window results in a stronger smoothing effect and thus in less gain
           variation,  i.e.  slower  gain  adaptation.  Conversely,  using  a smaller window results in a weaker
           smoothing effect and thus in more gain variation, i.e. faster gain adaptation.  In other  words,  the
           more  you increase this value, the more the Dynamic Audio Normalizer will behave like a "traditional"
           normalization filter. On the contrary, the more you decrease this value, the more the  Dynamic  Audio
           Normalizer will behave like a dynamic range compressor.

       <b>peak,</b> <b>p</b>
           Set  the target peak value. This specifies the highest permissible magnitude level for the normalized
           audio input. This filter will try to approach the target peak magnitude as closely as  possible,  but
           at  the same time it also makes sure that the normalized signal will never exceed the peak magnitude.
           A frame's maximum local gain factor is imposed directly by the target  peak  magnitude.  The  default
           value is 0.95 and thus leaves a headroom of 5%*.  It is not recommended to go above this value.

       <b>maxgain,</b> <b>m</b>
           Set  the  maximum  gain  factor.  In  range  from  1.0  to 100.0. Default is 10.0.  The Dynamic Audio
           Normalizer determines the maximum possible (local) gain factor for each input frame, i.e. the maximum
           gain factor that does not result in clipping or distortion. The maximum gain factor is determined  by
           the  frame's  highest magnitude sample. However, the Dynamic Audio Normalizer additionally bounds the
           frame's maximum gain factor by a predetermined (global) maximum gain factor. This is done in order to
           avoid excessive gain factors in "silent" or almost silent frames. By default, the maximum gain factor
           is 10.0, For most inputs the default value should be sufficient and it usually is not recommended  to
           increase  this  value.  Though,  for  input  with  an  extremely  low overall volume level, it may be
           necessary to allow even higher gain factors. Note, however, that the Dynamic  Audio  Normalizer  does
           not  simply apply a "hard" threshold (i.e. cut off values above the threshold).  Instead, a "sigmoid"
           threshold function will be applied. This way, the gain factors will smoothly approach  the  threshold
           value, but never exceed that value.

       <b>targetrms,</b> <b>r</b>
           Set  the  target  RMS.  In range from 0.0 to 1.0. Default is 0.0 - disabled.  By default, the Dynamic
           Audio Normalizer performs "peak" normalization.  This means that the maximum local  gain  factor  for
           each  frame  is  defined (only) by the frame's highest magnitude sample. This way, the samples can be
           amplified as much as possible without exceeding the maximum  signal  level,  i.e.  without  clipping.
           Optionally,  however,  the  Dynamic Audio Normalizer can also take into account the frame's root mean
           square, abbreviated RMS. In electrical engineering, the RMS is commonly used to determine  the  power
           of  a  time-varying  signal. It is therefore considered that the RMS is a better approximation of the
           "perceived loudness" than just looking at the signal's peak magnitude. Consequently, by adjusting all
           frames to a constant RMS value, a uniform "perceived loudness" can be established. If  a  target  RMS
           value  has  been specified, a frame's local gain factor is defined as the factor that would result in
           exactly that RMS value.  Note, however, that the maximum local gain factor is still restricted by the
           frame's highest magnitude sample, in order to prevent clipping.

       <b>coupling,</b> <b>n</b>
           Enable channels coupling. By default is enabled.  By  default,  the  Dynamic  Audio  Normalizer  will
           amplify  all  channels  by  the  same  amount. This means the same gain factor will be applied to all
           channels, i.e.  the maximum possible gain factor is determined by the "loudest" channel.  However, in
           some recordings, it may happen that the volume of the different channels is uneven, e.g. one  channel
           may be "quieter" than the other one(s).  In this case, this option can be used to disable the channel
           coupling. This way, the gain factor will be determined independently for each channel, depending only
           on  the  individual channel's highest magnitude sample. This allows for harmonizing the volume of the
           different channels.

       <b>correctdc,</b> <b>c</b>
           Enable DC bias correction. By default is disabled.  An  audio  signal  (in  the  time  domain)  is  a
           sequence  of  sample  values.  In the Dynamic Audio Normalizer these sample values are represented in
           the -1.0 to 1.0 range, regardless of the original  input  format.  Normally,  the  audio  signal,  or
           "waveform",  should  be centered around the zero point.  That means if we calculate the mean value of
           all samples in a file, or in a single frame, then the result should be 0.0 or at least very close  to
           that  value.  If,  however,  there  is  a significant deviation of the mean value from 0.0, in either
           positive or negative direction, this is referred to as a DC bias or DC offset. Since  a  DC  bias  is
           clearly undesirable, the Dynamic Audio Normalizer provides optional DC bias correction.  With DC bias
           correction  enabled,  the  Dynamic Audio Normalizer will determine the mean value, or "DC correction"
           offset, of each input frame and subtract that value from all  of  the  frame's  sample  values  which
           ensures  those  samples  are  centered  around 0.0 again. Also, in order to avoid "gaps" at the frame
           boundaries, the DC correction offset  values  will  be  interpolated  smoothly  between  neighbouring
           frames.

       <b>altboundary,</b> <b>b</b>
           Enable  alternative  boundary  mode. By default is disabled.  The Dynamic Audio Normalizer takes into
           account a certain neighbourhood around each frame. This includes the preceding frames as well as  the
           subsequent  frames. However, for the "boundary" frames, located at the very beginning and at the very
           end of the audio file, not all neighbouring frames are available. In particular, for  the  first  few
           frames in the audio file, the preceding frames are not known. And, similarly, for the last few frames
           in  the audio file, the subsequent frames are not known. Thus, the question arises which gain factors
           should be assumed for the missing frames in the  "boundary"  region.  The  Dynamic  Audio  Normalizer
           implements  two modes to deal with this situation. The default boundary mode assumes a gain factor of
           exactly 1.0 for the missing frames, resulting in a smooth "fade in" and "fade out" at  the  beginning
           and at the end of the input, respectively.

       <b>compress,</b> <b>s</b>
           Set  the  compress  factor. In range from 0.0 to 30.0. Default is 0.0.  By default, the Dynamic Audio
           Normalizer does not apply "traditional" compression. This means that signal peaks will not be  pruned
           and  thus  the  full dynamic range will be retained within each local neighbourhood. However, in some
           cases it may be desirable to combine the Dynamic Audio Normalizer's normalization  algorithm  with  a
           more  "traditional" compression.  For this purpose, the Dynamic Audio Normalizer provides an optional
           compression (thresholding) function. If (and only if) the compression feature is enabled,  all  input
           frames  will  be  processed  by  a  soft knee thresholding function prior to the actual normalization
           process. Put simply, the thresholding function is going to prune all samples whose magnitude  exceeds
           a  certain  threshold  value.   However,  the  Dynamic Audio Normalizer does not simply apply a fixed
           threshold value. Instead, the threshold value  will  be  adjusted  for  each  individual  frame.   In
           general, smaller parameters result in stronger compression, and vice versa.  Values below 3.0 are not
           recommended, because audible distortion may appear.

       <b>threshold,</b> <b>t</b>
           Set  the  target threshold value. This specifies the lowest permissible magnitude level for the audio
           input which will be normalized.  If input frame volume is above this value frame will be  normalized.
           Otherwise  frame  may  not be normalized at all. The default value is set to 0, which means all input
           frames will be normalized.  This option is mostly useful  if  digital  noise  is  not  wanted  to  be
           amplified.

       <b>channels,</b> <b>h</b>
           Specify which channels to filter, by default all available channels are filtered.

       <b>overlap,</b> <b>o</b>
           Specify  overlap  for  frames.  If  set to 0 (default) no frame overlapping is done.  Using &gt;0 and &lt;1
           values will make less conservative gain adjustments, like when framelen  option  is  set  to  smaller
           value,  if  framelen  option  value is compensated for non-zero overlap then gain adjustments will be
           smoother across time compared to zero overlap case.

       <b>curve,</b> <b>v</b>
           Specify the peak mapping curve expression which is going to be used when calculating gain applied  to
           frames.  The  max  output  frame gain will still be limited by other options mentioned previously for
           this filter.

           The expression can contain the following constants:

           <b>ch</b>  current channel number

           <b>sn</b>  current sample number

           <b>nb_channels</b>
               number of channels

           <b>t</b>   timestamp expressed in seconds

           <b>sr</b>  sample rate

           <b>p</b>   current frame peak value

   <b>equalizer</b>
       Apply a two-pole peaking equalisation (EQ) filter. With this filter, the signal-level  at  and  around  a

       all other frequencies is unchanged.

       In  order  to  produce  complex  equalisation curves, this filter can be given several times, each with a

           The desired output channel layout. It defaults to stereo.

       <b>map</b> Map  channels  from  inputs  to output. The argument is a '|'-separated list of mappings, each in the
           "<u>input_idx</u>.<u>in_channel</u>-<u>out_channel</u>" form.  <u>input_idx</u>  is  the  0-based  index  of  the  input  stream.
           <u>in_channel</u>  can  be either the name of the input channel (e.g. FL for front left) or its index in the
           specified input stream. <u>out_channel</u> is the name of the output channel.

       The filter will attempt to guess the mappings when they are not specified explicitly. It does so by first
       trying to find an unused matching input channel and if  that  fails  it  picks  the  first  unused  input
       channel.

       Join 3 inputs (with properly set channel layouts):

               ffmpeg -i INPUT1 -i INPUT2 -i INPUT3 -filter_complex join=inputs=3 OUTPUT

       Build a 5.1 output from 6 single-channel streams:

               ffmpeg -i fl -i fr -i fc -i sl -i sr -i lfe -filter_complex
               'join=inputs=6:channel_layout=5.1:map=0.0-FL|1.0-FR|2.0-FC|3.0-SL|4.0-SR|5.0-LFE'
               out

   <b>ladspa</b>
       Load a LADSPA (Linux Audio Developer's Simple Plugin API) plugin.

       To enable compilation of this filter you need to configure FFmpeg with "--enable-ladspa".

       <b>file,</b> <b>f</b>
           Specifies  the  name  of  LADSPA  plugin  library to load. If the environment variable <b>LADSPA_PATH</b> is
           defined, the LADSPA plugin is searched in  each  one  of  the  directories  specified  by  the  colon
           separated  list  in  <b>LADSPA_PATH</b>,  otherwise  in  the standard LADSPA paths, which are in this order:
           <u>HOME/.ladspa/lib/</u>, <u>/usr/local/lib/ladspa/</u>, <u>/usr/lib/ladspa/</u>.

       <b>plugin,</b> <b>p</b>
           Specifies the plugin within the library. Some libraries contain only one plugin, but  others  contain
           many of them. If this is not set filter will list all available plugins within the specified library.

       <b>controls,</b> <b>c</b>
           Set  the  '|'  separated list of controls which are zero or more floating point values that determine
           the behavior of the loaded plugin (for example delay,  threshold  or  gain).   Controls  need  to  be
           defined  using the following syntax: c0=<u>value0</u>|c1=<u>value1</u>|c2=<u>value2</u>|..., where <u>valuei</u> is the value set
           on  the  <u>i</u>-th  control.   Alternatively  they  can  be  also  defined  using  the  following  syntax:
           <u>value0</u>|<u>value1</u>|<u>value2</u>|...,  where  <u>valuei</u> is the value set on the <u>i</u>-th control.  If <b>controls</b> is set to
           "help", all available controls and their valid ranges are printed.

       <b>sample_rate,</b> <b>s</b>
           Specify the sample rate, default to 44100. Only used if plugin have zero inputs.

       <b>nb_samples,</b> <b>n</b>
           Set the number of samples per channel per each output frame, default is 1024.  Only  used  if  plugin
           have zero inputs.

       <b>duration,</b> <b>d</b>
           Set  the  minimum duration of the sourced audio. See <b>the</b> <b>Time</b> <b>duration</b> <b>section</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b><a href="../man1/ffmpeg-utils.1.html">ffmpeg-utils</a>(1)</b>
           <b>manual</b> for the accepted syntax.  Note that the resulting duration may be greater than  the  specified
           duration,  as the generated audio is always cut at the end of a complete frame.  If not specified, or
           the expressed duration is negative, the audio is supposed to be  generated  forever.   Only  used  if
           plugin have zero inputs.

       <b>latency,</b> <b>l</b>
           Enable latency compensation, by default is disabled.  Only used if plugin have inputs.

       <u>Commands</u>

       This filter supports the following commands:

       <b>cN</b>  Modify the <u>N</u>-th control value.

           If the specified value is not valid, it is ignored and prior one is kept.

   <b>loudnorm</b>
       EBU R128 loudness normalization. Includes both dynamic and linear normalization modes.  Support for  both
       single  pass  (livestreams, files) and double pass (files) modes.  This algorithm can target IL, LRA, and
       maximum true peak. In dynamic mode, to accurately detect true peaks, the audio stream will  be  upsampled
       to 192 kHz.  Use the "-ar" option or "aresample" filter to explicitly set an output sample rate.

       The filter accepts the following options:

       <b>I,</b> <b>i</b>
           Set integrated loudness target.  Range is -70.0 - -5.0. Default value is -24.0.

       <b>LRA,</b> <b>lra</b>
           Set loudness range target.  Range is 1.0 - 50.0. Default value is 7.0.

       <b>TP,</b> <b>tp</b>
           Set maximum true peak.  Range is -9.0 - +0.0. Default value is -2.0.

       <b>measured_I,</b> <b>measured_i</b>
           Measured IL of input file.  Range is -99.0 - +0.0.

       <b>measured_LRA,</b> <b>measured_lra</b>
           Measured LRA of input file.  Range is  0.0 - 99.0.

       <b>measured_TP,</b> <b>measured_tp</b>
           Measured true peak of input file.  Range is  -99.0 - +99.0.

       <b>measured_thresh</b>
           Measured threshold of input file.  Range is -99.0 - +0.0.

       <b>offset</b>
           Set  offset  gain. Gain is applied before the true-peak limiter.  Range is  -99.0 - +99.0. Default is
           +0.0.

       <b>linear</b>
           Normalize by linearly scaling the source audio.   "measured_I",  "measured_LRA",  "measured_TP",  and
           "measured_thresh" must all be specified. Target LRA shouldn't be lower than source LRA and the change
           in  integrated  loudness shouldn't result in a true peak which exceeds the target TP. If any of these
           conditions aren't met, normalization mode will revert to <u>dynamic</u>.  Options  are  "true"  or  "false".
           Default is "true".

       <b>dual_mono</b>
           Treat  mono  input  files as "dual-mono". If a mono file is intended for playback on a stereo system,
           its EBU R128 measurement will be  perceptually  incorrect.   If  set  to  "true",  this  option  will
           compensate  for this effect.  Multi-channel input files are not affected by this option.  Options are
           true or false. Default is false.

       <b>print_format</b>
           Set print format for stats. Options are summary, json, or none.  Default value is none.

   <b>lowpass</b>
       Apply a low-pass filter with 3dB point frequency.  The filter can be either  single-pole  or  double-pole
       (the default).  The filter roll off at 6dB per pole per octave (20dB per pole per decade).

       The filter accepts the following options:

       <b>frequency,</b> <b>f</b>
           Set frequency in Hz. Default is 500.

       <b>poles,</b> <b>p</b>
           Set number of poles. Default is 2.

       <b>width_type,</b> <b>t</b>
           Set method to specify band-width of filter.

           <b>h</b>   Hz

       <b>width,</b> <b>w</b>
           Specify  the  band-width  of  a filter in width_type units.  Applies only to double-pole filter.  The
           default is 0.707q and gives a Butterworth response.

       <b>mix,</b> <b>m</b>
           How much to use filtered signal in output. Default is 1.  Range is between 0 and 1.

       <b>channels,</b> <b>c</b>
           Specify which channels to filter, by default all available are filtered.

       <b>normalize,</b> <b>n</b>
           Normalize biquad coefficients, by default is disabled.  Enabling it will normalize magnitude response
           at DC to 0dB.

       <b>transform,</b> <b>a</b>
           Set transform type of IIR filter.

           <b>di</b>
           <b>dii</b>
           <b>tdi</b>
           <b>tdii</b>
           <b>latt</b>
           <b>svf</b>
           <b>zdf</b>
       <b>precision,</b> <b>r</b>
           Set precision of filtering.

           <b>auto</b>
               Pick automatic sample format depending on surround filters.

           <b>s16</b> Always use signed 16-bit.

           <b>s32</b> Always use signed 32-bit.

           <b>f32</b> Always use float 32-bit.

           <b>f64</b> Always use float 64-bit.

       <b>block_size,</b> <b>b</b>
           Set block size used for reverse IIR processing. If this value is set to  high  enough  value  (higher
           than  impulse  response  length truncated when reaches near zero values) filtering will become linear
           phase otherwise if not big enough it will just produce nasty artifacts.

           Note that filter delay will be exactly this many samples when set to non-zero value.

       <u>Commands</u>

       This filter supports all options that are exported by plugin as commands.

   <b>mcompand</b>
       Multiband Compress or expand the audio's dynamic range.

       The input audio is divided into bands using 4th order Linkwitz-Riley IIRs.  This is akin to the crossover
       of a loudspeaker, and results in flat frequency response when absent compander action.

       It accepts the following parameters:

       <b>args</b>
           This  option  syntax  is:  attack,decay,[attack,decay..]  soft-knee points crossover_frequency [delay
           [initial_volume [gain]]] | attack,decay ...  For explanation of each item  refer  to  compand  filter
           documentation.

   <b>pan</b>
       Mix channels with specific gain levels. The filter accepts the output channel layout followed by a set of
       channels definitions.

       This filter is also designed to efficiently remap the channels of an audio stream.

       The filter accepts parameters of the form: "<u>l</u>|<u>outdef</u>|<u>outdef</u>|..."

       <b>l</b>   output channel layout or number of channels

       <b>outdef</b>
           output channel specification, of the form: "<u>out_name</u>=[<u>gain</u>*]<u>in_name</u>[(+-)[<u>gain</u>*]<u>in_name</u>...]"

       <b>out_name</b>
           output channel to define, either a channel name (FL, FR, etc.) or a channel number (c0, c1, etc.)

       <b>gain</b>
           multiplicative coefficient for the channel, 1 leaving the volume unchanged

       <b>in_name</b>
           input  channel  to  use, see out_name for details; it is not possible to mix named and numbered input
           channels

       If the `=' in a channel specification is replaced by `&lt;', then the gains for that specification  will  be
       renormalized so that the total is 1, thus avoiding clipping noise.

       <u>Mixing</u> <u>examples</u>

       For example, if you want to down-mix from stereo to mono, but with a bigger factor for the left channel:

               pan=1c|c0=0.9*c0+0.1*c1

       A customized down-mix to stereo that works automatically for 3-, 4-, 5- and 7-channels surround:

               pan=stereo| FL &lt; FL + 0.5*FC + 0.6*BL + 0.6*SL | FR &lt; FR + 0.5*FC + 0.6*BR + 0.6*SR

       Note  that  <b>ffmpeg</b>  integrates a default down-mix (and up-mix) system that should be preferred (see "-ac"
       option) unless you have very specific needs.

       <u>Remapping</u> <u>examples</u>

       The channel remapping will be effective if, and only if:

       *&lt;gain coefficients are zeroes or ones,&gt;
       *&lt;only one input per channel output,&gt;

       If all these conditions are satisfied, the filter will notify the user ("Pure channel mapping detected"),
       and use an optimized and lossless method to do the remapping.

       For example, if you have a 5.1 source and want a stereo audio stream by dropping the extra channels:

               pan="stereo| c0=FL | c1=FR"

       Given the same source, you can also switch front left and front right channels and keep the input channel
       layout:

               pan="5.1| c0=c1 | c1=c0 | c2=c2 | c3=c3 | c4=c4 | c5=c5"

       If the input is a stereo audio stream, you can mute the front left channel (and  still  keep  the  stereo
       channel layout) with:

               pan="stereo|c1=c1"

       Still with a stereo audio stream input, you can copy the right channel in both front left and right:

               pan="stereo| c0=FR | c1=FR"

   <b>replaygain</b>
       ReplayGain  scanner  filter.  This filter takes an audio stream as an input and outputs it unchanged.  At
       end of filtering it displays "track_gain" and "track_peak".

       The filter accepts the following exported read-only options:

       <b>track_gain</b>
           Exported track gain in dB at end of stream.

       <b>track_peak</b>
           Exported track peak at end of stream.

   <b>resample</b>
       Convert the audio sample format, sample rate and channel layout. It is not meant to be used directly.

   <b>rubberband</b>
       Apply time-stretching and pitch-shifting with librubberband.

       To enable compilation of this filter, you need to configure FFmpeg with "--enable-librubberband".

   <b>sidechaincompress</b>
       This filter acts like normal compressor but has the ability to  compress  detected  signal  using  second
       input  signal.   It  needs  two  input streams and returns one output stream.  First input stream will be
       processed depending on second stream signal.  The filtered signal then can be filtered with other filters
       in later stages of processing. See <b>pan</b> and <b>amerge</b> filter.

       The filter accepts the following options:

       <b>level_in</b>
           Set input gain. Default is 1. Range is between 0.015625 and 64.

       <b>mode</b>
           Set mode of compressor operation. Can be "upward" or "downward".  Default is "downward".

           If a signal of second stream raises above this level it will  affect  the  gain  reduction  of  first
           stream.  By default is 0.125. Range is between 0.00097563 and 1.

       <b>ratio</b>
           Set  a  ratio  about  which  the  signal is reduced. 1:2 means that if the level raised 4dB above the
           threshold, it will be only 2dB above after the reduction.  Default is 2. Range is between 1 and 20.

       <b>attack</b>
           Amount of milliseconds the signal has to rise above  the  threshold  before  gain  reduction  starts.
           Default is 20. Range is between 0.01 and 2000.

       <b>release</b>
           Amount  of  milliseconds  the  signal  has  to fall below the threshold before reduction is decreased
           again. Default is 250. Range is between 0.01 and 9000.

       <b>makeup</b>
           Set the amount by how much signal will be amplified after processing.  Default is 1. Range is from  1
           to 64.

       <b>knee</b>
           Curve  the  sharp knee around the threshold to enter gain reduction more softly.  Default is 2.82843.
           Range is between 1 and 8.

       <b>link</b>
           Choose if the "average" level between all channels of  side-chain  stream  or  the  louder("maximum")
           channel of side-chain stream affects the reduction. Default is "average".

       <b>detection</b>
           Should  the  exact signal be taken in case of "peak" or an RMS one in case of "rms". Default is "rms"
           which is mainly smoother.

       <b>level_sc</b>
           Set sidechain gain. Default is 1. Range is between 0.015625 and 64.

       <b>mix</b> How much to use compressed signal in output. Default is 1.  Range is between 0 and 1.

       <u>Commands</u>

       This filter supports the all above options as <b>commands</b>.

       <u>Examples</u>

       •   Full ffmpeg example taking 2 audio inputs, 1st input to be compressed depending on the signal of  2nd
           input and later compressed signal to be merged with 2nd input:

                   ffmpeg -i main.flac -i sidechain.flac -filter_complex "[1:a]asplit=2[sc][mix];[0:a][sc]sidechaincompress[compr];[compr][mix]amerge"

   <b>sidechaingate</b>
       A  sidechain  gate  acts  like a normal (wideband) gate but has the ability to filter the detected signal
       before sending it to the gain reduction stage.  Normally a gate uses the full range signal  to  detect  a
       level  above the threshold.  For example: If you cut all lower frequencies from your sidechain signal the
       gate will decrease the volume of your track only if not enough highs appear. With this technique you  are
       able  to  reduce  the  resonation  of a natural drum or remove "rumbling" of muted strokes from a heavily
       distorted guitar.  It needs two input streams and returns one output stream.  First input stream will  be
       processed depending on second stream signal.

       The filter accepts the following options:

       <b>level_in</b>
           Set input level before filtering.  Default is 1. Allowed range is from 0.015625 to 64.

       <b>mode</b>
           Set  the mode of operation. Can be "upward" or "downward".  Default is "downward". If set to "upward"
           mode, higher parts of signal  will  be  amplified,  expanding  dynamic  range  in  upward  direction.
           Otherwise, in case of "downward" lower parts of signal will be reduced.

       <b>range</b>
           Set  the level of gain reduction when the signal is below the threshold.  Default is 0.06125. Allowed
           range is from 0 to 1.  Setting this to 0 disables reduction and then filter behaves like expander.

       <b>threshold</b>
           If a signal rises above this level the gain reduction is released.  Default is 0.125.  Allowed  range
           is from 0 to 1.

       <b>ratio</b>
           Set a ratio about which the signal is reduced.  Default is 2. Allowed range is from 1 to 9000.

       <b>attack</b>
           Amount  of  milliseconds  the  signal  has  to  rise above the threshold before gain reduction stops.
           Default is 20 milliseconds. Allowed range is from 0.01 to 9000.

       <b>release</b>
           Amount of milliseconds the signal has to fall below the threshold before the reduction  is  increased
           again. Default is 250 milliseconds.  Allowed range is from 0.01 to 9000.

       <b>makeup</b>
           Set amount of amplification of signal after processing.  Default is 1. Allowed range is from 1 to 64.

       <b>knee</b>
           Curve  the  sharp  knee  around  the  threshold  to  enter  gain  reduction  more softly.  Default is
           2.828427125. Allowed range is from 1 to 8.

       <b>detection</b>
           Choose if exact signal should be taken for detection or an RMS like one.  Default is rms. Can be peak
           or rms.

       <b>link</b>
           Choose if the average level between all  channels  or  the  louder  channel  affects  the  reduction.
           Default is average. Can be average or maximum.

       <b>level_sc</b>
           Set sidechain gain. Default is 1. Range is from 0.015625 to 64.

       <u>Commands</u>

       This filter supports the all above options as <b>commands</b>.

   <b>silencedetect</b>
       Detect silence in an audio stream.

       This  filter  logs  a  message  when  it  detects that the input audio volume is less or equal to a noise
       tolerance value for a duration greater or equal to the minimum detected noise duration.

       The  printed  times   and   duration   are   expressed   in   seconds.   The   "lavfi.silence_start"   or
       "lavfi.silence_start.X"  metadata  key  is  set  on the first frame whose timestamp equals or exceeds the
       detection duration and it contains the timestamp of the first frame of the silence.

       The    "lavfi.silence_duration"    or    "lavfi.silence_duration.X"    and     "lavfi.silence_end"     or
       "lavfi.silence_end.X" metadata keys are set on the first frame after the silence. If <b>mono</b> is enabled, and
       each channel is evaluated separately, the ".X" suffixed keys are used, and "X" corresponds to the channel
       number.

       The filter accepts the following options:

       <b>noise,</b> <b>n</b>
           Set  noise  tolerance.  Can  be  specified in dB (in case "dB" is appended to the specified value) or
           amplitude ratio. Default is -60dB, or 0.001.

       <b>duration,</b> <b>d</b>
           Set silence duration until notification (default is 2 seconds). See <b>the</b> <b>Time</b> <b>duration</b> <b>section</b> <b>in</b>  <b>the</b>
           <b><a href="../man1/ffmpeg-utils.1.html">ffmpeg-utils</a>(1)</b> <b>manual</b> for the accepted syntax.

       <b>mono,</b> <b>m</b>
           Process each channel separately, instead of combined. By default is disabled.

       <u>Examples</u>

       •   Detect 5 seconds of silence with -50dB noise tolerance:

                   silencedetect=n=-50dB:d=5

       •   Complete example with <b>ffmpeg</b> to detect silence with 0.0001 noise tolerance in <u>silence.mp3</u>:

                   ffmpeg -i silence.mp3 -af silencedetect=noise=0.0001 -f null -

   <b>silenceremove</b>
       Remove silence from the beginning, middle or end of the audio.

       The filter accepts the following options:

       <b>start_periods</b>
           This  value is used to indicate if audio should be trimmed at beginning of the audio. A value of zero
           indicates no silence should be trimmed from the beginning. When specifying a non-zero value, it trims
           audio up until it finds non-silence. Normally, when trimming silence  from  beginning  of  audio  the
           <u>start_periods</u>  will  be  1  but it can be increased to higher values to trim all audio up to specific
           count of non-silence periods.  Default value is 0.

       <b>start_duration</b>
           Specify the amount of time that non-silence must be detected  before  it  stops  trimming  audio.  By
           increasing the duration, bursts of noises can be treated as silence and trimmed off. Default value is
           0.

       <b>start_threshold</b>
           This indicates what sample value should be treated as silence. For digital audio, a value of 0 may be
           fine but for audio recorded from analog, you may wish to increase the value to account for background
           noise.   Can be specified in dB (in case "dB" is appended to the specified value) or amplitude ratio.
           Default value is 0.

       <b>start_silence</b>
           Specify max duration of silence at beginning that will be kept after trimming. Default is 0, which is
           equal to trimming all samples detected as silence.

       <b>start_mode</b>
           Specify mode of detection of silence end at start of multi-channel audio.  Can be <u>any</u> or <u>all</u>. Default
           is <u>any</u>.  With <u>any</u>, any sample from any channel that is detected as non-silence will  trigger  end  of
           silence  trimming  at  start  of  audio stream.  With <u>all</u>, only if every sample from every channel is
           detected as non-silence will trigger end of silence trimming at start of audio stream, limited usage.

       <b>stop_periods</b>
           Set the count for trimming silence from the end of audio. When specifying a positive value, it  trims
           audio  after it finds specified silence period.  To remove silence from the middle of a file, specify
           a <u>stop_periods</u> that is negative. This value is then treated as  a  positive  value  and  is  used  to
           indicate  the  effect  should restart processing as specified by <u>stop_periods</u>, making it suitable for
           removing periods of silence in the middle of the audio.  Default value is 0.

       <b>stop_duration</b>
           Specify a duration of silence that must exist before audio is not copied any more.  By  specifying  a
           higher duration, silence that is wanted can be left in the audio.  Default value is 0.

       <b>stop_threshold</b>
           This is the same as <b>start_threshold</b> but for trimming silence from the end of audio.  Can be specified
           in dB (in case "dB" is appended to the specified value) or amplitude ratio. Default value is 0.

       <b>stop_silence</b>
           Specify max duration of silence at end that will be kept after trimming. Default is 0, which is equal
           to trimming all samples detected as silence.

       <b>stop_mode</b>
           Specify  mode  of  detection of silence start after start of multi-channel audio.  Can be <u>any</u> or <u>all</u>.
           Default is <u>all</u>.  With <u>any</u>, any sample from any channel that is detected as silence will trigger start
           of silence trimming after start of audio stream, limited usage.  With <u>all</u>, only if every sample  from
           every  channel  is  detected  as  silence will trigger start of silence trimming after start of audio
           stream.

       <b>detection</b>
           Set how is silence detected.

           <b>avg</b> Mean of absolute values of samples in moving window.

           <b>rms</b> Root squared mean of absolute values of samples in moving window.

           <b>peak</b>
               Maximum of absolute values of samples in moving window.

           <b>median</b>
               Median of absolute values of samples in moving window.

           <b>ptp</b> Absolute of max peak to min peak difference of samples in moving window.

           <b>dev</b> Standard deviation of values of samples in moving window.

           Default value is "rms".

       <b>window</b>
           Set duration in number of seconds used to calculate size of window in number of samples for detecting
           silence. Using 0 will effectively disable any windowing and use only single sample  per  channel  for
           silence  detection.   In  that case it may be needed to also set <b>start_silence</b> and/or <b>stop_silence</b> to
           nonzero values with also <b>start_duration</b> and/or <b>stop_duration</b> to nonzero  values.   Default  value  is
           0.02. Allowed range is from 0 to 10.

       <b>timestamp</b>
           Set processing mode of every audio frame output timestamp.

           <b>write</b>
               Full timestamps rewrite, keep only the start time for the first output frame.

           <b>copy</b>
               Non-dropped frames are left with same timestamp as input audio frame.

           Defaults value is "write".

       <u>Examples</u>

       •   The  following  example  shows how this filter can be used to start a recording that does not contain
           the delay at the start which usually occurs between pressing the record button and the start  of  the
           performance:

                   silenceremove=start_periods=1:start_duration=5:start_threshold=0.02

       •   Trim  all  silence  encountered from beginning to end where there is more than 1 second of silence in

       •   Trim every 2nd encountered silence period from beginning to end where there is more than 1 second  of
           silence per silence period in audio:

                   silenceremove=stop_periods=-2:stop_duration=1:stop_threshold=-90dB

       •   Similar as above, but keep maximum of 0.5 seconds of silence from each trimmed period:

       <u>Commands</u>

       This filter supports some above options as <b>commands</b>.

   <b>sofalizer</b>
       SOFAlizer uses head-related transfer functions (HRTFs) to create virtual loudspeakers around the user for
       binaural  listening  via  headphones (audio formats up to 9 channels supported).  The HRTFs are stored in
       SOFA files (see &lt;<b><a href="http://www.sofacoustics.org/">http://www.sofacoustics.org/</a></b>&gt; for a database).  SOFAlizer is developed at the  Acoustics
       Research Institute (ARI) of the Austrian Academy of Sciences.

   <b>speechnorm</b>
       Speech Normalizer.

       This filter expands or compresses each half-cycle of audio samples (local set of samples all above or all
       below  zero and between two nearest zero crossings) depending on threshold value, so audio reaches target
       peak value under conditions controlled by below options.

       The filter accepts the following options:

       <b>peak,</b> <b>p</b>
           Set the expansion target peak value. This specifies the highest allowed absolute amplitude level  for
           the normalized audio input. Default value is 0.95. Allowed range is from 0.0 to 1.0.

       <b>expansion,</b> <b>e</b>
           Set  the  maximum  expansion  factor.  Allowed range is from 1.0 to 50.0. Default value is 2.0.  This
           option controls maximum local half-cycle of samples expansion. The maximum expansion  would  be  such
           that  local  peak  value reaches target peak value but never to surpass it and that ratio between new
           and previous peak value does not surpass this option value.

       <b>compression,</b> <b>c</b>
           Set the maximum compression factor. Allowed range is from 1.0 to 50.0. Default value  is  2.0.   This
           option  controls  maximum  local  half-cycle  of  samples  compression.  This  option is used only if
           <b>threshold</b> option is set to value greater than 0.0, then in such cases when local  peak  is  lower  or
           same  as value set by <b>threshold</b> all samples belonging to that peak's half-cycle will be compressed by
           current compression factor.

       <b>threshold,</b> <b>t</b>
           Set the threshold value. Default value is 0.0. Allowed  range  is  from  0.0  to  1.0.   This  option
           specifies which half-cycles of samples will be compressed and which will be expanded.  Any half-cycle
           samples  with their local peak value below or same as this option value will be compressed by current
           compression factor, otherwise, if greater than threshold value they will be expanded  with  expansion
           factor so that it could reach peak target value but never surpass it.

       <b>raise,</b> <b>r</b>
           Set  the  expansion  raising  amount per each half-cycle of samples. Default value is 0.001.  Allowed
           range is from 0.0 to 1.0. This controls how fast expansion factor is raised per each  new  half-cycle
           until it reaches <b>expansion</b> value.  Setting this options too high may lead to distortions.

       <b>fall,</b> <b>f</b>
           Set  the  compression raising amount per each half-cycle of samples. Default value is 0.001.  Allowed
           range is from 0.0 to 1.0. This controls how fast compression factor is raised per each new half-cycle
           until it reaches <b>compression</b> value.

       <b>channels,</b> <b>h</b>
           Specify which channels to filter, by default all available channels are filtered.

       <b>invert,</b> <b>i</b>
           Enable inverted filtering, by default is disabled. This inverts interpretation of  <b>threshold</b>  option.
           When  enabled any half-cycle of samples with their local peak value below or same as <b>threshold</b> option
           will be expanded otherwise it will be compressed.

       <b>link,</b> <b>l</b>
           Link channels when calculating gain applied to each filtered channel sample, by default is  disabled.
           When  disabled  each  filtered channel gain calculation is independent, otherwise when this option is
           enabled the minimum of all possible gains for each filtered channel is used.

       <b>rms,</b> <b>m</b>
           Set the expansion target RMS value. This specifies the highest allowed RMS level for  the  normalized
           audio input. Default value is 0.0, thus disabled. Allowed range is from 0.0 to 1.0.

       The filter accepts the following options:

       <b>f</b>   Modulation frequency in Hertz. Modulation frequencies in the subharmonic range (20 Hz or lower)  will
           result  in  a  tremolo  effect.   This  filter  may  also be used as a ring modulator by specifying a
           modulation frequency higher than 20 Hz.  Range is 0.1 - 20000.0. Default value is 5.0 Hz.

       <b>d</b>   Depth of modulation as a percentage. Range is 0.0 - 1.0.  Default value is 0.5.

   <b>vibrato</b>
       Sinusoidal phase modulation.

       <b>f</b>   Modulation frequency in Hertz.  Range is 0.1 - 20000.0. Default value is 5.0 Hz.

       <b>d</b>   Depth of modulation as a percentage. Range is 0.0 - 1.0.  Default value is 0.5.

   <b>virtualbass</b>
       Apply audio Virtual Bass filter.

       This filter accepts stereo input and produce stereo with LFE (2.1) channels output.  The  newly  produced
       LFE  channel  have  enhanced  virtual  bass  originally  obtained from both stereo channels.  This filter
       outputs front left and front right channels unchanged as available in stereo input.

       The filter accepts the following options:

       <b>cutoff</b>
           Set the virtual bass cutoff frequency. Default value is 250 Hz.  Allowed range is from 100 to 500 Hz.

       <b>strength</b>
           Set the virtual bass strength. Allowed range is from 0.5 to 3.  Default value is 3.

   <b>volume</b>
       Adjust the input audio volume.

       It accepts the following parameters:

       <b>volume</b>
           Set audio volume expression.

           Output values are clipped to the maximum value.

           The output audio volume is given by the relation:

                   &lt;output_volume&gt; = &lt;volume&gt; * &lt;input_volume&gt;

           The default value for <u>volume</u> is "1.0".

       <b>precision</b>
           This parameter represents the mathematical precision.

           It determines which input sample formats will be allowed, which affects the precision of  the  volume
           scaling.

           <b>fixed</b>
               8-bit fixed-point; this limits input sample format to U8, S16, and S32.

           <b>float</b>
               32-bit floating-point; this limits input sample format to FLT. (default)

           <b>double</b>
               64-bit floating-point; this limits input sample format to DBL.

       <b>replaygain</b>
           Choose the behaviour on encountering ReplayGain side data in input frames.

           <b>drop</b>
               Remove ReplayGain side data, ignoring its contents (the default).

           Prevent clipping by limiting the gain applied.

           Default value for <u>replaygain_noclip</u> is 1.

       <b>eval</b>
           Set when the volume expression is evaluated.

           It accepts the following values:

           <b>once</b>
               only  evaluate  expression  once  during the filter initialization, or when the <b>volume</b> command is
               sent

           <b>frame</b>
               evaluate expression for each incoming frame

           Default value is <b>once</b>.

       variables will evaluate to NAN.

       <u>Commands</u>

       This filter supports the following commands:

       <b>volume</b>
           Modify the volume expression.  The command accepts the same syntax of the corresponding option.

           If the specified expression is not valid, it is kept at its current value.

       <u>Examples</u>

       •   Halve the input audio volume:

                   volume=volume=0.5
                   volume=volume=1/2
                   volume=volume=-6.0206dB

           In all the above example the named key for <b>volume</b> can be omitted, for example like in:

                   volume=0.5

       •   Increase input audio power by 6 decibels using fixed-point precision:

                   volume=volume=6dB:precision=fixed

       •   Fade volume after time 10 with an annihilation period of 5 seconds:

                   volume='if(lt(t,10),1,max(1-(t-10)/5,0))':eval=frame

   <b>volumedetect</b>
       Detect the volume of the input video.

       The  filter  has  no  parameters.  It  supports  only 16-bit signed integer samples, so the input will be
       converted when needed. Statistics about the volume will be printed in the log when the input  stream  end
       is reached.

       In  particular  it  will show the mean volume (root mean square), maximum volume (on a per-sample basis),
       and the beginning of a histogram of the registered volume values (from the maximum value to  a  cumulated
       1/1000 of the samples).

       All volumes are in decibels relative to the maximum PCM value.

       <u>Examples</u>

       Here is an excerpt of the output:

               [Parsed_volumedetect_0  0xa23120] mean_volume: -27 dB
               [Parsed_volumedetect_0  0xa23120] max_volume: -4 dB
               [Parsed_volumedetect_0  0xa23120] histogram_4db: 6
               [Parsed_volumedetect_0  0xa23120] histogram_5db: 62
               [Parsed_volumedetect_0  0xa23120] histogram_6db: 286
               [Parsed_volumedetect_0  0xa23120] histogram_7db: 1042
               [Parsed_volumedetect_0  0xa23120] histogram_8db: 2551
               [Parsed_volumedetect_0  0xa23120] histogram_9db: 4609
               [Parsed_volumedetect_0  0xa23120] histogram_10db: 8409

       It means that:

       •   The mean square energy is approximately -27 dB, or 10^-2.7.

       •   The largest sample is at -4 dB, or more precisely between -4 dB and -5 dB.

       •   There are 6 samples at -4 dB, 62 at -5 dB, 286 at -6 dB, etc.

       In  other  words,  raising  the  volume  by +4 dB does not cause any clipping, raising it by +5 dB causes
       clipping for 6 samples, etc.

</pre><h4><b>AUDIO</b> <b>SOURCES</b></h4><pre>
       Below is a description of the currently available audio sources.

   <b>abuffer</b>
       Buffer audio frames, and make them available to the filter chain.

       This source is mainly intended for a programmatic use, in particular through  the  interface  defined  in
       <u>libavfilter/buffersrc.h</u>.

       It accepts the following parameters:

       <b>time_base</b>
           The  timebase  which  will  be used for timestamps of submitted frames. It must be either a floating-
           point number or in <u>numerator</u>/<u>denominator</u> form.

       <b>sample_rate</b>
           The sample rate of the incoming audio buffers.

       <b>sample_fmt</b>
           The sample format of the incoming audio buffers.  Either a sample format name  or  its  corresponding
           integer representation from the enum AVSampleFormat in <u>libavutil/samplefmt.h</u>

       <b>channel_layout</b>
           The   channel   layout   of   the  incoming  audio  buffers.   Either  a  channel  layout  name  from
           channel_layout_map in <u>libavutil/channel_layout.c</u> or its corresponding integer representation from the
           AV_CH_LAYOUT_* macros in <u>libavutil/channel_layout.h</u>

       <b>channels</b>
           The number of channels of the incoming audio  buffers.   If  both  <u>channels</u>  and  <u>channel_layout</u>  are
           specified, then they must be consistent.

       <u>Examples</u>

               abuffer=sample_rate=44100:sample_fmt=s16p:channel_layout=stereo

       will  instruct  the source to accept planar 16bit signed stereo at 44100Hz.  Since the sample format with
       name "s16p" corresponds to the number 6 and the "stereo" channel layout corresponds  to  the  value  0x3,
       this is equivalent to:

               abuffer=sample_rate=44100:sample_fmt=6:channel_layout=0x3

   <b>aevalsrc</b>
       Generate an audio signal specified by an expression.

       This source accepts in input one or more expressions (one for each channel), which are evaluated and used
       to generate a corresponding audio signal.

       This source accepts the following options:

       <b>exprs</b>
           Set  the  '|'-separated expressions list for each separate channel. In case the <b>channel_layout</b> option
           is not specified, the selected  channel  layout  depends  on  the  number  of  provided  expressions.
           Otherwise the last specified expression is applied to the remaining output channels.

       <b>channel_layout,</b> <b>c</b>
           Set the channel layout. The number of channels in the specified layout must be equal to the number of
           specified expressions.

       <b>duration,</b> <b>d</b>
           Set  the  minimum duration of the sourced audio. See <b>the</b> <b>Time</b> <b>duration</b> <b>section</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b><a href="../man1/ffmpeg-utils.1.html">ffmpeg-utils</a>(1)</b>
           <b>manual</b> for the accepted syntax.  Note that the resulting duration may be greater than  the  specified
           duration, as the generated audio is always cut at the end of a complete frame.

           If  not  specified,  or  the  expressed  duration  is negative, the audio is supposed to be generated
           forever.

       <b>nb_samples,</b> <b>n</b>
           Set the number of samples per channel per each output frame, default to 1024.

</pre><h4><b>AUDIO</b> <b>SINKS</b></h4><pre>
       Below is a description of the currently available audio sinks.

   <b>abuffersink</b>
       Buffer audio frames, and make them available to the end of filter chain.

       This  sink  is  mainly  intended  for  programmatic  use,  in particular through the interface defined in
       <u>libavfilter/buffersink.h</u> or the options system.

       It accepts a pointer to an AVABufferSinkContext structure, which defines the incoming  buffers'  formats,
       to be passed as the opaque parameter to "avfilter_init_filter" for initialization.

   <b>anullsink</b>
       Null  audio  sink;  do absolutely nothing with the input audio. It is mainly useful as a template and for
       use in analysis / debugging tools.

</pre><h4><b>VIDEO</b> <b>FILTERS</b></h4><pre>
       When  you  configure  your  FFmpeg  build,  you  can  disable  any  of   the   existing   filters   using
       "--disable-filters".  The configure output will show the video filters included in your build.

       Below is a description of the currently available video filters.

   <b>addroi</b>
       Mark a region of interest in a video frame.

       The  frame  data is passed through unchanged, but metadata is attached to the frame indicating regions of
       interest which can affect the behaviour of later encoding.  Multiple regions can be  marked  by  applying
       the filter multiple times.

       <b>x</b>   Region distance in pixels from the left edge of the frame.

       <b>y</b>   Region distance in pixels from the top edge of the frame.

       <b>w</b>   Region width in pixels.

       <b>h</b>   Region height in pixels.

           The parameters <u>x</u>, <u>y</u>, <u>w</u> and <u>h</u> are expressions, and may contain the following variables:

           <b>iw</b>  Width of the input frame.

           <b>ih</b>  Height of the input frame.

       <b>qoffset</b>
           Quantisation offset to apply within the region.

           This  must  be  a  real value in the range -1 to +1.  A value of zero indicates no quality change.  A
           negative value asks for better quality (less quantisation), while a positive  value  asks  for  worse
           quality (greater quantisation).

           The range is calibrated so that the extreme values indicate the largest possible offset - if the rest
           of  the  frame is encoded with the worst possible quality, an offset of -1 indicates that this region
           should be encoded with the best possible quality anyway.  Intermediate values are  then  interpolated
           in some codec-dependent way.

           For example, in 10-bit H.264 the quantisation parameter varies between -12 and 51.  A typical qoffset
           value  of  -1/10 therefore indicates that this region should be encoded with a QP around one-tenth of
           the full range better than the rest of the frame.  So, if most of the frame were to be encoded with a
           QP of around 30, this region would get a QP of around 24 (an offset of approximately -1/10  *  (51  -
           -12) = -6.3).  An extreme value of -1 would indicate that this region should be encoded with the best
           possible quality regardless of the treatment of the rest of the frame - that is, should be encoded at
           a QP of -12.

       <b>clear</b>
           If  set  to  true,  remove any existing regions of interest marked on the frame before adding the new
           one.

       <u>Examples</u>

       •   Mark the centre quarter of the frame as interesting.

                   addroi=iw/4:ih/4:iw/2:ih/2:-1/10

       •   Mark the 100-pixel-wide region on the left edge of the frame as very uninteresting (to be encoded  at
           much lower quality than the rest of the frame).

                   addroi=0:0:100:ih:+1/5

   <b>alphaextract</b>
       Extract  the  alpha  component  from  the  input as a grayscale video. This is especially useful with the
       <u>alphamerge</u> filter.

   <b>alphamerge</b>
       Add or replace the alpha component of the primary input with the grayscale value of a second input.  This
       is  intended  for use with <u>alphaextract</u> to allow the transmission or storage of frame sequences that have
       alpha in a format that doesn't support an alpha channel.

       For example, to reconstruct full frames from a normal YUV-encoded video and a separate video created with
       <u>alphaextract</u>, you might use:

               movie=in_alpha.mkv [alpha]; [in][alpha] alphamerge [out]

   <b>amplify</b>
       Amplify differences between current pixel and pixels of adjacent frames in same pixel location.

       This filter accepts the following options:

       <b>radius</b>
           Set frame radius. Default is 2. Allowed range is from 1 to 63.  For example radius of 3 will instruct
           filter to calculate average of 7 frames.

       <b>factor</b>
           Set factor to amplify difference. Default is 2. Allowed range is from 0 to 65535.

       <b>threshold</b>
           Set threshold for difference amplification. Any difference greater or equal to this  value  will  not
           alter source pixel. Default is 10.  Allowed range is from 0 to 65535.

       <b>tolerance</b>
           Set  tolerance for difference amplification. Any difference lower to this value will not alter source
           pixel. Default is 0.  Allowed range is from 0 to 65535.

       <b>low</b> Set lower limit for changing source pixel. Default is 65535. Allowed range is from 0 to 65535.   This
           option controls maximum possible value that will decrease source pixel value.

       <b>high</b>
           Set  high  limit for changing source pixel. Default is 65535. Allowed range is from 0 to 65535.  This
           option controls maximum possible value that will increase source pixel value.

       <b>planes</b>
           Set which planes to filter. Default is all. Allowed range is from 0 to 15.

       <u>Commands</u>

       <b>factor</b>
       <b>threshold</b>
       <b>tolerance</b>
       <b>low</b>
       <b>high</b>
       <b>planes</b>

   <b>ass</b>
       Same as the <b>subtitles</b> filter, except that it doesn't require libavcodec and libavformat to work.  On  the
       other hand, it is limited to ASS (Advanced Substation Alpha) subtitles files.

       This filter accepts the following option in addition to the common options from the <b>subtitles</b> filter:

       <b>shaping</b>
           Set the shaping engine

           Available values are:

           <b>auto</b>
               The default libass shaping engine, which is the best available.

           <b>simple</b>
               Fast, font-agnostic shaper that can do only substitutions

           <b>complex</b>
               Slower shaper using OpenType for substitutions and positioning

           The default is "auto".

   <b>atadenoise</b>
       Apply an Adaptive Temporal Averaging Denoiser to the video input.

       The filter accepts the following options:

       <b>0a</b>  Set threshold A for 1st plane. Default is 0.02.  Valid range is 0 to 0.3.

       <b>0b</b>  Set threshold B for 1st plane. Default is 0.04.  Valid range is 0 to 5.

       <b>1a</b>  Set threshold A for 2nd plane. Default is 0.02.  Valid range is 0 to 0.3.

       <b>1b</b>  Set threshold B for 2nd plane. Default is 0.04.  Valid range is 0 to 5.

       <b>2a</b>  Set threshold A for 3rd plane. Default is 0.02.  Valid range is 0 to 0.3.

       <b>2b</b>  Set threshold B for 3rd plane. Default is 0.04.  Valid range is 0 to 5.

           Threshold A is designed to react on abrupt changes in the input signal and threshold B is designed to
           react on continuous changes in the input signal.

       <b>s</b>   Set  number  of  frames  filter will use for averaging. Default is 9. Must be odd number in range [5,
           129].

       <b>p</b>   Set what planes of frame filter will use for averaging. Default is all.

       <b>a</b>   Set what variant of algorithm filter will use for averaging. Default is "p" parallel.   Alternatively
           can be set to "s" serial.

           Parallel  can be faster then serial, while other way around is never true.  Parallel will abort early
           on first change being greater then thresholds, while serial will continue processing  other  side  of
           frames if they are equal or below thresholds.

       <b>0s</b>
       <b>1s</b>
       <b>2s</b>  Set  sigma  for 1st plane, 2nd plane or 3rd plane. Default is 32767.  Valid range is from 0 to 32767.
           This options controls weight for each pixel in radius defined by size.   Default  value  means  every
           pixel have same weight.  Setting this option to 0 effectively disables filtering.

   <b>bitplanenoise</b>
       Show and measure bit plane noise.

       The filter accepts the following options:

       <b>bitplane</b>
           Set which plane to analyze. Default is 1.

       <b>filter</b>
           Filter out noisy pixels from "bitplane" set above.  Default is disabled.

   <b>blackdetect</b>
       Detect video intervals that are (almost) completely black. Can be useful to detect  chapter  transitions,
       commercials, or invalid recordings.

       The  filter  outputs its detection analysis to both the log as well as frame metadata. If a black segment
       of at least the specified minimum duration is found, a line with the start and end timestamps as well  as
       duration  is  printed to the log with level "info". In addition, a log line with level "debug" is printed
       per frame showing the black amount detected for that frame.

       The filter also attaches metadata to the first frame of a black segment with key "lavfi.black_start"  and
       to  the  first  frame  after  the black segment ends with key "lavfi.black_end". The value is the frame's
       timestamp. This metadata is added regardless of the minimum duration specified.

       The filter accepts the following options:

       <b>black_min_duration,</b> <b>d</b>
           Set the minimum detected black duration expressed in seconds. It  must  be  a  non-negative  floating
           point number.

           Default value is 2.0.

       <b>picture_black_ratio_th,</b> <b>pic_th</b>
           Set the threshold for considering a picture "black".  Express the minimum value for the ratio:

                   &lt;nb_black_pixels&gt; / &lt;nb_pixels&gt;

           for which a picture is considered black.  Default value is 0.98.

       <b>pixel_black_th,</b> <b>pix_th</b>
           Set the threshold for considering a pixel "black".

           The  threshold  expresses  the  maximum pixel luma value for which a pixel is considered "black". The
           provided value is scaled according to the following equation:

                   &lt;absolute_threshold&gt; = &lt;luma_minimum_value&gt; + &lt;pixel_black_th&gt; * &lt;luma_range_size&gt;

           <u>luma_range_size</u> and <u>luma_minimum_value</u> depend on the input video format, the range is [0-255] for YUV
           full-range formats and [16-235] for YUV non full-range formats.

           Default value is 0.10.

       The following example sets the maximum pixel threshold to the  minimum  value,  and  detects  only  black
       intervals of 2 or more seconds:

               blackdetect=d=2:pix_th=0.00

   <b>blackframe</b>
       Detect  frames  that  are  (almost)  completely  black.  Can  be  useful to detect chapter transitions or
       commercials. Output lines consist of the frame number of the detected frame, the percentage of blackness,
       the position in the file if known or -1 and the timestamp in seconds.

       In order to display the output lines, you need to set the loglevel at least to the AV_LOG_INFO value.

       This filter exports frame metadata "lavfi.blackframe.pblack".  The value  represents  the  percentage  of
       pixels in the picture that are below the threshold value.

       It accepts the following parameters:

       <b>amount</b>
           The percentage of the pixels that have to be below the threshold; it defaults to 98.

       <b>threshold,</b> <b>thresh</b>
           The threshold below which a pixel value is considered black; it defaults to 32.

   <b>blend</b>
       Blend two video frames into each other.

       The "blend" filter takes two input streams and outputs one stream, the first input is the "top" layer and
       second input is "bottom" layer.  By default, the output terminates when the longest input terminates.

       The  "tblend"  (time  blend)  filter takes two consecutive frames from one single stream, and outputs the
       result obtained by blending the new frame on top of the old frame.

           Set minimum and maximum values for determining pixel grids (periods).  Default values are [3,24].

       <b>planes</b>
           Set planes to filter. Default is first only.

       <u>Examples</u>

       •   Determine blockiness for the first plane and search for periods within [8,32]:

                   blockdetect=period_min=8:period_max=32:planes=1

   <b>blurdetect</b>
       Determines blurriness of frames without altering the input frames.

       Based on Marziliano, Pina, et al. "A no-reference perceptual blur  metric."   Allows  for  a  block-based
       abbreviation.

       The filter accepts the following options:

       <b>low</b>
       <b>high</b>
           Set low and high threshold values used by the Canny thresholding algorithm.

           The  high threshold selects the "strong" edge pixels, which are then connected through 8-connectivity
           with the "weak" edge pixels selected by the low threshold.

           <u>low</u> and <u>high</u> threshold values must be chosen in the range [0,1], and <u>low</u> should be lesser or equal to
           <u>high</u>.

           Default value for <u>low</u> is "20/255", and default value for <u>high</u> is "50/255".

       <b>radius</b>
           Define the radius to search around an edge pixel for local maxima.

       <b>block_pct</b>
           Determine blurriness only for the most significant blocks, given in percentage.

       <b>block_width</b>
           Determine blurriness for blocks of width <u>block_width</u>. If set to any value smaller 1,  no  blocks  are
           used and the whole image is processed as one no matter of <u>block_height</u>.

       <b>block_height</b>
           Determine  blurriness for blocks of height <u>block_height</u>. If set to any value smaller 1, no blocks are
           used and the whole image is processed as one no matter of <u>block_width</u>.

       <b>planes</b>
           Set planes to filter. Default is first only.

       <u>Examples</u>

       •   Determine blur for 80% of most significant 32x32 blocks:

       Denoise frames using Block-Matching 3D algorithm.

       The filter accepts the following options.

       <b>sigma</b>
           Set denoising strength. Default value is 1.  Allowed  range  is  from  0  to  999.9.   The  denoising
           algorithm is very sensitive to sigma, so adjust it according to the source.

           Set local patch size. This sets dimensions in 2D.

       <b>bstep</b>
           Set  sliding step for processing blocks. Default value is 4.  Allowed range is from 1 to 64.  Smaller
           values allows processing more reference blocks and is slower.

       <b>group</b>
           Set maximal number of similar blocks for 3rd dimension. Default value is 1.  When set to 1, no  block
           matching is done. Larger values allows more blocks in single group.  Allowed range is from 1 to 256.

       <b>range</b>
           Set radius for search block matching. Default is 9.  Allowed range is from 1 to INT32_MAX.

       <b>mstep</b>
           Set  step  between two search locations for block matching. Default is 1.  Allowed range is from 1 to
           64. Smaller is slower.

       <b>thmse</b>
           Set threshold of mean square error for block matching. Valid range is 0 to INT32_MAX.

       <b>hdthr</b>
           Set thresholding parameter for hard thresholding in 3D transformed domain.  Larger values results  in
           stronger hard-thresholding filtering in frequency domain.

       <b>estim</b>
           Set filtering estimation mode. Can be "basic" or "final".  Default is "basic".

       <b>ref</b> If  enabled, filter will use 2nd stream for block matching.  Default is disabled for "basic" value of
           <u>estim</u> option, and always enabled if value of <u>estim</u> is "final".

       <b>planes</b>
           Set planes to filter. Default is all available except alpha.

       <u>Examples</u>

       •   Basic filtering with bm3d:

           expression "min(w,h)/2" for the luma and alpha planes, and of "min(cw,ch)/2" for the chroma planes.

           Default value for <b>luma_radius</b> is "2". If not specified, <b>chroma_radius</b> and <b>alpha_radius</b> default to the
           corresponding value set for <b>luma_radius</b>.

           The expressions can contain the following constants:

           everything.

       <b>blend</b>
           Blend percentage.  0.0 makes pixels either fully gray, or not gray at all.  Higher values  result  in
           more preserved color.

       <b>yuv</b> Signals that the color passed is already in YUV instead of RGB.

           Literal colors like "green" or "red" don't make sense with this enabled anymore.  This can be used to
           pass exact YUV values as hexadecimal numbers.

   <b>colorkey</b>
       RGB  colorspace  color  keying.   This  filter  operates  on 8-bit RGB format frames by setting the alpha
       component of each pixel which falls within the similarity radius of the key color to 0. The  alpha  value
       for pixels outside the similarity radius depends on the value of the blend option.

       The filter accepts the following options:

       <b>color</b>
           Set  the  color  for  which  alpha  will be set to 0 (full transparency).  See <b>"Color"</b> <b>section</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b>
           <b>ffmpeg-utils</b> <b>manual</b>.  Default is "black".

       <b>similarity</b>
           Set the radius from the key color within  which  other  colors  also  have  full  transparency.   The
           computed  distance  is  related to the unit fractional distance in 3D space between the RGB values of
           the key color and the pixel's color. Range is 0.01 to 1.0. 0.01 matches within a  very  small  radius
           around the exact key color, while 1.0 matches everything.  Default is 0.01.

       <b>blend</b>
           Set  how  the  alpha value for pixels that fall outside the similarity radius is computed.  0.0 makes
           pixels either fully transparent or fully opaque.  Higher values result  in  semi-transparent  pixels,
           with greater transparency the more similar the pixel color is to the key color.  Range is 0.0 to 1.0.
           Default is 0.0.

       <u>Examples</u>

       •   Make every green pixel in the input image transparent:

       <b>irange</b>
           Override input color range. Same accepted values as <b>range</b>.

       The filter converts the transfer characteristics, color space and color primaries to the  specified  user
       values.  The  output  value,  if not specified, is set to a default value based on the "all" property. If
       that property is also not specified, the filter will log an error. The  output  color  range  and  format
       default  to the same value as the input color range and format. The input transfer characteristics, color
       space, color primaries and color range should be set on the input data. If any of these are missing,  the
       filter will log an error and no conversion will take place.

       For example to convert the input to SMPTE-240M, use the command:

               colorspace=smpte240m

   <b>colorspace_cuda</b>
       CUDA accelerated implementation of the colorspace filter.

       It  is  by  no means feature complete compared to the software colorspace filter, and at the current time
       only supports color range conversion between jpeg/full and mpeg/limited range.

       The filter accepts the following options:

       <b>planes</b>
           Set which planes to process.

       <b>impulse</b>
           Set which impulse video frames will be processed, can be <u>first</u> or <u>all</u>. Default is <u>all</u>.

       The "convolve" filter also supports the <b>framesync</b> options.

   <b>copy</b>
       Copy the input video source unchanged to the output. This is mainly useful for testing purposes.

   <b>coreimage</b>
       Video filtering on GPU using Apple's CoreImage API on OSX.

       Hardware  acceleration  is  based  on  an  OpenGL  context.  Usually, this means it is processed by video
       hardware. However, software-based OpenGL implementations exist which means  there  is  no  guarantee  for
       hardware processing. It depends on the respective OSX.

       There  are many filters and image generators provided by Apple that come with a large variety of options.
       The filter has to be referenced by its name along with its options.

       The coreimage filter accepts the following options:

       <b>list_filters</b>
           List all available filters and generators along with all their respective options as well as possible
           minimum and maximum values along with the default values.

                   list_filters=true

       <b>filter</b>
           Specify all filters by their respective name and options.  Use <u>list_filters</u> to  determine  all  valid
           filter  names  and  options.   Numerical options are specified by a float value and are automatically
           clamped to their respective value range.  Vector and color options have to be specified by a list  of
           space  separated float values. Character escaping has to be done.  A special option name "default" is
           available to use default options for a filter.

           It is required to specify either "default" or at least  one  of  the  filter  options.   All  omitted
           options are used with their default values.  The syntax of the filter string is as follows:

                   filter=&lt;NAME&gt;@&lt;OPTION&gt;=&lt;VALUE&gt;[@&lt;OPTION&gt;=&lt;VALUE&gt;][@...][#&lt;NAME&gt;@&lt;OPTION&gt;=&lt;VALUE&gt;[@&lt;OPTION&gt;=&lt;VALUE&gt;][@...]][#...]

       <b>output_rect</b>
           Specify  a rectangle where the output of the filter chain is copied into the input image. It is given
           by a list of space separated float values:

                   output_rect=x\ y\ width\ height

           If not given, the output rectangle equals the dimensions of the input image.  The output rectangle is
           automatically cropped at the borders  of  the  input  image.  Negative  values  are  valid  for  each
           component.

                   output_rect=25\ 25\ 100\ 100

       Several  filters  can  be  chained for successive processing without GPU-HOST transfers allowing for fast
       processing of complex filter chains.  Currently, only filters  with  zero  (generators)  or  exactly  one
       (filters)  input image and one output image are supported. Also, transition filters are not yet usable as
       intended.

       Some filters generate output images with additional padding depending on the  respective  filter  kernel.
       The padding is automatically removed to ensure the filter output has the same size as the input image.

       For  image  generators,  the  size  of the output image is determined by the previous output image of the
       filter chain or the input image of the whole filterchain, respectively. The generators  do  not  use  the
       pixel  information  of this image to generate their output. However, the generated output is blended onto
       this image, resulting in partial or complete coverage of the output image.

       The <b>coreimagesrc</b> video source can be used for generating input images which are  directly  fed  into  the
       filter  chain.  By  using  it,  providing  input  images by another video source or an input video is not
       required.

       <u>Examples</u>

       •   List all filters available:

                   coreimage=list_filters=true

       •   Use the CIBoxBlur filter with default options to blur an image:

                   coreimage=filter=CIBoxBlur@default

       •   Use a filter chain with CISepiaTone at default values and CIVignetteEffect with its center at 100x100
           and a radius of 50 pixels:

                   coreimage=filter=CIBoxBlur@default#CIVignetteEffect@inputCenter=100\ 100@inputRadius=50

       •   Use nullsrc and CIQRCodeGenerator to create a QR code for the FFmpeg homepage, given as complete  and
           escaped command-line for Apple's standard bash shell:

                   ffmpeg -f lavfi -i nullsrc=s=100x100,coreimage=filter=CIQRCodeGenerator@inputMessage=https\\\\\://FFmpeg.org/@inputCorrectionLevel=H -frames:v 1 QRCode.png

   <b>corr</b>
       Obtain the correlation between two input videos.

       This filter takes two input videos.

       Both  input videos must have the same resolution and pixel format for this filter to work correctly. Also
       it assumes that both inputs have the same number of frames, which are compared one by one.

       The obtained per component, average, min and max correlation is printed through the logging system.

       The filter stores the calculated correlation of each frame in frame metadata.

       This filter also supports the <b>framesync</b> options.

       In the below example the input file <u>main.mpg</u> being processed is compared with the reference file <u>ref.mpg</u>.

               ffmpeg -i main.mpg -i ref.mpg -lavfi corr -f null -

   <b>cover_rect</b>
       Cover a rectangular object

       It accepts the following options:

       <b>cover</b>
           Filepath of the optional cover image, needs to be in yuv420.

       <b>mode</b>
           Set covering mode.

           It accepts the following values:

           <b>cover</b>
               cover it by the supplied image

           <b>blur</b>
               cover it by interpolating the surrounding pixels

           Default value is <u>blur</u>.

       <u>Examples</u>

       •   Cover a rectangular object by the supplied image of a given video using <b>ffmpeg</b>:

                   ffmpeg -i file.ts -vf find_rect=newref.pgm,cover_rect=cover.jpg:mode=cover new.mkv

   <b>crop</b>
       Crop the input video to given dimensions.

       It accepts the following parameters:

       <b>w,</b> <b>out_w</b>
           The width of the output video. It defaults to "iw".  This expression is evaluated  only  once  during
           the filter configuration, or when the <b>w</b> or <b>out_w</b> command is sent.

       <b>h,</b> <b>out_h</b>
           The  height  of the output video. It defaults to "ih".  This expression is evaluated only once during
           the filter configuration, or when the <b>h</b> or <b>out_h</b> command is sent.

       <b>x</b>   The horizontal position, in the input video, of the left edge of the output  video.  It  defaults  to
           "(in_w-out_w)/2".  This expression is evaluated per-frame.

       <b>y</b>   The  vertical  position,  in  the  input  video, of the top edge of the output video.  It defaults to
           "(in_h-out_h)/2".  This expression is evaluated per-frame.

       <b>keep_aspect</b>
           If set to 1 will force the output display aspect ratio to be the same of the input, by  changing  the
           output sample aspect ratio. It defaults to 0.

       <b>exact</b>
           Enable  exact  cropping.  If  enabled, subsampled videos will be cropped at exact width/height/x/y as
           specified and will not be rounded to nearest smaller value.  It defaults to 0.

       The <u>out_w</u>, <u>out_h</u>, <u>x</u>, <u>y</u> parameters are expressions containing the following constants:

       <b>x</b>
       <b>y</b>   The computed values for <u>x</u> and <u>y</u>. They are evaluated for each new frame.

       <b>in_w</b>
       <b>in_h</b>
           The input width and height.

       <b>iw</b>
       <b>ih</b>  These are the same as <u>in_w</u> and <u>in_h</u>.

       <b>out_w</b>
       <b>out_h</b>
           The output (cropped) width and height.

       <b>ow</b>
       <b>oh</b>  These are the same as <u>out_w</u> and <u>out_h</u>.

       <b>a</b>   same as <u>iw</u> / <u>ih</u>

       <b>sar</b> input sample aspect ratio

       <b>dar</b> input display aspect ratio, it is the same as (<u>iw</u> / <u>ih</u>) * <u>sar</u>

       <b>hsub</b>
       <b>vsub</b>
           horizontal and vertical chroma subsample values. For example for the pixel format "yuv422p" <u>hsub</u> is 2
           and <u>vsub</u> is 1.

       <b>n</b>   The number of the input frame, starting from 0.

       <b>pos</b> the position in the file of the input frame, NAN if unknown; deprecated, do not use

       <b>t</b>   The timestamp expressed in seconds. It's NAN if the input timestamp is unknown.

       The expression for <u>out_w</u> may depend on the value of <u>out_h</u>, and the expression for  <u>out_h</u>  may  depend  on
       <u>out_w</u>, but they cannot depend on <u>x</u> and <u>y</u>, as <u>x</u> and <u>y</u> are evaluated after <u>out_w</u> and <u>out_h</u>.

       The  <u>x</u>  and  <u>y</u>  parameters  specify the expressions for the position of the top-left corner of the output
       (non-cropped) area. They are evaluated for each frame. If  the  evaluated  value  is  not  valid,  it  is
       approximated to the nearest valid value.

       The expression for <u>x</u> may depend on <u>y</u>, and the expression for <u>y</u> may depend on <u>x</u>.

       <u>Examples</u>

       •   Crop area with size 100x100 at position (12,34).

                   crop=100:100:12:34

           Using named options, the example above becomes:

       •   Set x depending on the value of y:

                   crop=in_w/2:in_h/2:y:10+10*sin(n/10)

       <u>Commands</u>

       This filter supports the following commands:

       <b>w,</b> <b>out_w</b>
       <b>h,</b> <b>out_h</b>
       <b>x</b>
       <b>y</b>   Set  width/height  of  the output video and the horizontal/vertical position in the input video.  The
           command accepts the same syntax of the corresponding option.

           If the specified expression is not valid, it is kept at its current value.

   <b>cropdetect</b>
       Auto-detect the crop size.

       It calculates the necessary cropping parameters and prints the recommended  parameters  via  the  logging
       system. The detected dimensions correspond to the non-black or video area of the input video according to
       <u>mode</u>.

       It accepts the following parameters:

       <b>mode</b>
           Depending  on  <u>mode</u> crop detection is based on either the mere black value of surrounding pixels or a
           combination of motion vectors and edge pixels.

           <b>black</b>
               Detect black pixels surrounding the playing video. For fine control use option <u>limit</u>.

           <b>mvedges</b>
               Detect the playing video by the motion vectors inside the video  and  scanning  for  edge  pixels
               typically forming the border of a playing video.

       <b>limit</b>
           Set  higher  black  value threshold, which can be optionally specified from nothing (0) to everything
           (255 for 8-bit based formats). An intensity value greater to the set value is  considered  non-black.
           It  defaults  to 24.  You can also specify a value between 0.0 and 1.0 which will be scaled depending
           on the bitdepth of the pixel format.

       <b>round</b>
           The value which the  width/height  should  be  divisible  by.  It  defaults  to  16.  The  offset  is
           automatically  adjusted  to  center  the  video.  Use 2 to get only even dimensions (needed for 4:2:2
           video). 16 is best when encoding to most video codecs.

       <b>skip</b>
           Set the number of initial frames for which evaluation is skipped.   Default  is  2.  Range  is  0  to
           INT_MAX.

       <b>reset_count,</b> <b>reset</b>
           Set  the  counter that determines after how many frames cropdetect will reset the previously detected
           largest video area and start over to detect the current optimal crop area. Default value is 0.

           This can be useful when channel logos distort the video area. 0 indicates 'never reset', and  returns
           the largest area encountered during playback.

       <b>mv_threshold</b>
           Set motion in pixel units as threshold for motion detection. It defaults to 8.

       <b>low</b>
       <b>high</b>
           Set low and high threshold values used by the Canny thresholding algorithm.

           The  high threshold selects the "strong" edge pixels, which are then connected through 8-connectivity
           with the "weak" edge pixels selected by the low threshold.

           <u>low</u> and <u>high</u> threshold values must be chosen in the range [0,1], and <u>low</u> should be lesser or equal to
           <u>high</u>.

           Default value for <u>low</u> is "5/255", and default value for <u>high</u> is "15/255".

       <u>Examples</u>

       •   Find video area surrounded by black borders:

                   ffmpeg -i file.mp4 -vf cropdetect,metadata=mode=print -f null -

       •   Find an embedded video area, generate motion vectors beforehand:

                   ffmpeg -i file.mp4 -vf mestimate,cropdetect=mode=mvedges,metadata=mode=print -f null -

       •   Find an embedded video area, use motion vectors from decoder:

                   ffmpeg -flags2 +export_mvs -i file.mp4 -vf cropdetect=mode=mvedges,metadata=mode=print -f null -

       <u>Commands</u>

       This filter supports the following commands:

       <b>limit</b>
           The command accepts the same syntax of the corresponding option.  If the specified expression is  not
           valid, it is kept at its current value.

   <b>cue</b>
       Delay  video  filtering  until  a given wallclock timestamp. The filter first passes on <b>preroll</b> amount of
       frames, then it buffers at most <b>buffer</b> amount of frames and waits for the cue. After reaching the cue  it
       forwards the buffered frames and also any subsequent frames coming in its input.

       The  filter  can  be used synchronize the output of multiple ffmpeg processes for realtime output devices
       like decklink. By putting the delay in the filtering chain and pre-buffering frames the process can  pass
       on data to output almost immediately after the target wallclock timestamp is reached.

       Perfect frame accuracy cannot be guaranteed, but the result is good enough for some use cases.

       <b>cue</b> The cue timestamp expressed in a UNIX timestamp in microseconds. Default is 0.

       <b>preroll</b>
           The duration of content to pass on as preroll expressed in seconds. Default is 0.

       <b>buffer</b>
           The maximum duration of content to buffer before waiting for the cue expressed in seconds. Default is
           0.

   <b>curves</b>
       Apply color adjustments using curves.

       This filter is similar to the Adobe Photoshop and GIMP curves tools. Each component (red, green and blue)
       has  its  values defined by <u>N</u> key points tied from each other using a smooth curve. The x-axis represents
       the pixel values from the input frame, and the y-axis the new pixel values  to  be  set  for  the  output
       frame.

       By  default, a component curve is defined by the two points <u>(0;0)</u> and <u>(1;1)</u>. This creates a straight line
       where each original pixel value is "adjusted" to its own value, which means no change to the image.

       The filter allows you to redefine these two points and add some more. A new curve will be defined to pass
       smoothly through all these new coordinates. The new defined points need to be  strictly  increasing  over
       the  x-axis,  and  their  <u>x</u>  and  <u>y</u>  values must be in the <u>[0;1]</u> interval. The curve is formed by using a
       natural or monotonic cubic spline interpolation, depending on the <u>interp</u> option (default: "natural"). The
       "natural" spline produces a smoother curve in general while the monotonic ("pchip") spline guarantees the
       transitions between the specified points to be monotonic. If the computed curves happened to  go  outside
       the vector spaces, the values will be clipped accordingly.

       The filter accepts the following options:

       <b>preset</b>
           Select  one  of  the  available  color  presets.  This  option can be used in addition to the <b>r</b>, <b>g</b>, <b>b</b>
           parameters; in this case, the later options takes priority on the preset values.   Available  presets
           are:

           <b>none</b>
           <b>color_negative</b>
           <b>cross_process</b>
           <b>darker</b>
           <b>increase_contrast</b>
           <b>lighter</b>
           <b>linear_contrast</b>
           <b>medium_contrast</b>
           <b>negative</b>
           <b>strong_contrast</b>
           <b>vintage</b>

           Default is "none".

       <b>master,</b> <b>m</b>
           Set  the  master key points. These points will define a second pass mapping. It is sometimes called a
           "luminance" or "value" mapping. It can be used with <b>r</b>, <b>g</b>, <b>b</b>  or  <b>all</b>  since  it  acts  like  a  post-
           processing LUT.

       <b>red,</b> <b>r</b>
           Set the key points for the red component.

       <b>green,</b> <b>g</b>
           Set the key points for the green component.

       <b>blue,</b> <b>b</b>
           Set the key points for the blue component.

       <b>all</b> Set  the  key points for all components (not including master).  Can be used in addition to the other
           key points component options. In this case, the unset component(s) will fallback on this <b>all</b> setting.

       <b>psfile</b>
           Specify a Photoshop curves file (".acv") to import the settings from.

       <b>plot</b>
           Save Gnuplot script of the curves in specified file.

       <b>interp</b>
           Specify the kind of interpolation. Available algorithms are:

           <b>natural</b>
               Natural  cubic  spline  using  a  piece-wise  cubic  polynomial  that   is   twice   continuously
               differentiable.

           <b>pchip</b>
               Monotonic cubic spline using a piecewise cubic Hermite interpolating polynomial (PCHIP).

       To  avoid  some filtergraph syntax conflicts, each key points list need to be defined using the following
       syntax: "x0/y0 x1/y1 x2/y2 ...".

       <u>Commands</u>

       This filter supports same <b>commands</b> as options.

       <u>Examples</u>

       •   Increase slightly the middle level of blue:

                   curves=blue='0/0 0.5/0.58 1/1'

       •   Vintage effect:

                   curves=r='0/0.11 .42/.51 1/0.95':g='0/0 0.50/0.48 1/1':b='0/0.22 .49/.44 1/0.8'

           Here we obtain the following coordinates for each components:

           <u>red</u> "(0;0.11) (0.42;0.51) (1;0.95)"

           <u>green</u>
               "(0;0) (0.50;0.48) (1;1)"

           <u>blue</u>
               "(0;0.22) (0.49;0.44) (1;0.80)"

       •   The previous example can also be achieved with the associated built-in preset:

                   curves=preset=vintage

       •   Or simply:

                   curves=vintage

       •   Use a Photoshop preset and redefine the points of the green component:

                   curves=psfile='MyCurvesPresets/purple.acv':green='0/0 0.45/0.53 1/1'

       •   Check out the curves of the "cross_process" profile using <b>ffmpeg</b> and <b>gnuplot</b>:

                   ffmpeg -f lavfi -i color -vf curves=cross_process:plot=/tmp/curves.plt -frames:v 1 -f null -
                   gnuplot -p /tmp/curves.plt

   <b>datascope</b>

           <b>color2</b>
               Draw hexadecimal pixel values on color background picked from input  video,  the  text  color  is
               picked in such way so its always visible.

       <b>axis</b>

           Set display number format. Can be "hex", or "dec". Default is "hex".

       <b>components</b>
           Set pixel components to display. By default all pixel components are displayed.

       <u>Commands</u>

       This filter supports same <b>commands</b> as options excluding "size" option.

   <b>dblur</b>
       Apply Directional blur filter.

       The filter accepts the following options:

       <b>angle</b>
           Set angle of directional blur. Default is 45.

       <b>radius</b>
           Set radius of directional blur. Default is 5.

       <b>planes</b>
           Set which planes to filter. By default all planes are filtered.

       <u>Commands</u>

       This  filter supports same <b>commands</b> as options.  The command accepts the same syntax of the corresponding
       option.

       If the specified expression is not valid, it is kept at its current value.

   <b>dctdnoiz</b>
       Denoise frames using 2D DCT (frequency domain filtering).

       This filter is not designed for real time.

       The filter accepts the following options:

       <b>sigma,</b> <b>s</b>
           Set the noise sigma constant.

           This <u>sigma</u> defines a hard threshold of "3 * sigma"; every DCT coefficient (absolute value) below this
           threshold with be dropped.

           If you need a more advanced filtering, see <b>expr</b>.

           Default is 0.

       <b>overlap</b>
           Set number overlapping pixels for each block. Since the filter can be slow, you may  want  to  reduce
           this value, at the cost of a less effective filter and the risk of various artefacts.

           If the overlapping value doesn't permit processing the whole input width or height, a warning will be
           displayed and according borders won't be denoised.

           Default value is <u>blocksize</u>-1, which is the best possible setting.

       <b>expr,</b> <b>e</b>
           Set the coefficient factor expression.

           For  each coefficient of a DCT block, this expression will be evaluated as a multiplier value for the
           coefficient.

           If this is option is set, the <b>sigma</b> option will be ignored.

           The absolute value of the coefficient can be accessed through the <u>c</u> variable.

       <b>n</b>   Set the <u>blocksize</u> using the number of bits. "1&lt;&lt;<u>n</u>" defines the <u>blocksize</u>,  which  is  the  width  and
           height of the processed blocks.

           The default value is <u>3</u> (8x8) and can be raised to <u>4</u> for a <u>blocksize</u> of 16x16. Note that changing this
           setting has huge consequences on the speed processing. Also, a larger block size does not necessarily
           means a better de-noising.

       <u>Examples</u>

       Apply a denoise with a <b>sigma</b> of 4.5:

               dctdnoiz=4.5

       The same operation can be achieved using the expression system:

               dctdnoiz=e='gte(c, 4.5*3)'

       Violent denoise using a block size of "16x16":

               dctdnoiz=15:n=4

   <b>deband</b>
       Remove  banding  artifacts  from  input video.  It works by replacing banded pixels with average value of
       referenced pixels.

       The filter accepts the following options:

       <b>1thr</b>
       <b>2thr</b>
       <b>3thr</b>
       <b>4thr</b>
           Set banding detection threshold for each plane. Default is 0.02.  Valid range is 0.00003 to 0.5.   If
           difference between current pixel and reference pixel is less than threshold, it will be considered as
           banded.

       <b>range,</b> <b>r</b>
           Banding  detection range in pixels. Default is 16. If positive, random number in range 0 to set value
           will be used. If negative, exact absolute value will be used.   The  range  defines  square  of  four
           pixels around current pixel.

       <b>direction,</b> <b>d</b>
           Set direction in radians from which four pixel will be compared. If positive, random direction from 0
           to  set  direction  will  be picked. If negative, exact of absolute value will be picked. For example
           direction 0, -PI or -2*PI radians will pick only pixels on same row and -PI/2 will pick  only  pixels
           on same column.

       <b>blur,</b> <b>b</b>
           If  enabled, current pixel is compared with average value of all four surrounding pixels. The default
           is enabled. If disabled current pixel is compared with all four  surrounding  pixels.  The  pixel  is
           considered banded if only all four differences with surrounding pixels are less than threshold.

       <b>coupling,</b> <b>c</b>
           If  enabled,  current  pixel  is changed if and only if all pixel components are banded, e.g. banding

       <u>Commands</u>

       This filter supports the all above options as <b>commands</b>.

   <b>deblock</b>
       Remove blocking artifacts from input video.

       The filter accepts the following options:

       <b>filter</b>
           Set filter type, can be <u>weak</u> or <u>strong</u>. Default is <u>strong</u>.  This controls what kind of deblocking  is
           applied.

       <b>block</b>
           Set size of block, allowed range is from 4 to 512. Default is <u>8</u>.

       <b>alpha</b>
       <b>beta</b>
       <b>gamma</b>
       <b>delta</b>
           Set  blocking  detection thresholds. Allowed range is 0 to 1.  Defaults are: <u>0.098</u> for <u>alpha</u> and <u>0.05</u>
           for the rest.  Using higher  threshold  gives  more  deblocking  strength.   Setting  <u>alpha</u>  controls
           threshold  detection at exact edge of block.  Remaining options controls threshold detection near the
           edge. Each one for below/above or left/right. Setting any of those to <u>0</u> disables deblocking.

       <b>planes</b>
           Set planes to filter. Default is to filter all available planes.

       <u>Examples</u>

       •   Deblock using weak filter and block size of 4 pixels.

                   deblock=filter=weak:block=4

       •   Deblock using strong filter, block size of 4 pixels and custom thresholds for deblocking more edges.

                   deblock=filter=strong:block=4:alpha=0.12:beta=0.07:gamma=0.06:delta=0.05

       •   Similar as above, but filter only first plane.

                   deblock=filter=strong:block=4:alpha=0.12:beta=0.07:gamma=0.06:delta=0.05:planes=1

       •   Similar as above, but filter only second and third plane.

       <b>cycle</b>
           Set the number of frames from which one will be dropped. Setting this to <u>N</u> means one frame  in  every
           batch of <u>N</u> frames will be dropped.  Default is 5.

       <b>dupthresh</b>
           Set the threshold for duplicate detection. If the difference metric for a frame is less than or equal
           to this value, then it is declared as duplicate. Default is 1.1

       It accepts the following options:

       <b>m</b>   Set mode of operation. Can be combination of <u>dotcrawl</u> for cross-luminance reduction  and/or  <u>rainbows</u>
           for cross-color reduction.

       <b>lt</b>  Set spatial luma threshold. Lower values increases reduction of cross-luminance.

       <b>tl</b>  Set tolerance for temporal luma. Higher values increases reduction of cross-luminance.

       <b>tc</b>  Set tolerance for chroma temporal variation. Higher values increases reduction of cross-color.

       <b>show</b>
           When  set to 1, a green rectangle is drawn on the screen to simplify finding the right <u>x</u>, <u>y</u>, <u>w</u>, and <u>h</u>
           parameters.  The default value is 0.

           The rectangle is drawn on the outermost pixels which will  be  (partly)  replaced  with  interpolated
           values.  The  values  of the next pixels immediately outside this rectangle in each direction will be
           used to compute the interpolated pixel values inside the rectangle.

       <u>Examples</u>

       •   Set a rectangle covering the area with top left corner coordinates 0,0 and size 100x77:

       <b>dnn_backend</b>
           Specify  which  DNN backend to use for model loading and execution. This option accepts the following
           values:

           <b>tensorflow</b>
               TensorFlow backend. To enable this backend you need to install the TensorFlow for C library  (see
               &lt;<b>https://www.tensorflow.org/install/lang_c</b>&gt;) and configure FFmpeg with "--enable-libtensorflow"

       <b>model</b>
           Set  path  to  model  file  specifying  network architecture and its parameters.  Note that different
           backends use different file formats. TensorFlow can load files for only its format.

       To get full functionality (such as async execution), please use the <b>dnn_processing</b> filter.

   <b>deshake</b>
       Attempt to fix small changes in horizontal and/or vertical shift. This filter helps remove  camera  shake
       from hand-holding a camera, bumping a tripod, moving on a vehicle, etc.

       The filter accepts the following options:

       <b>x</b>
       <b>y</b>
       <b>w</b>
       <b>h</b>   Specify  a  rectangular area where to limit the search for motion vectors.  If desired the search for
           motion vectors can be limited to a rectangular area of the frame defined  by  its  top  left  corner,
           width  and  height. These parameters have the same meaning as the drawbox filter which can be used to
           visualise the position of the bounding box.

           This is useful when simultaneous movement of subjects within the frame might be confused  for  camera
           motion by the motion vector search.

           If  any  or all of <u>x</u>, <u>y</u>, <u>w</u> and <u>h</u> are set to -1 then the full frame is used. This allows later options
           to be set without specifying the bounding box for the motion vector search.

           Default - search the whole frame.

       <b>rx</b>
       <b>ry</b>  Specify the maximum extent of movement in x and y directions in the range 0-64 pixels. Default 16.

       <b>contrast</b>
           Specify the contrast threshold for  blocks.  Only  blocks  with  more  than  the  specified  contrast
           (difference between darkest and lightest pixels) will be considered. Range 1-255, default 125.

       <b>search</b>
           Specify the search strategy. Available values are:

           <b>exhaustive,</b> <b>0</b>
               Set exhaustive search

       It accepts the following parameters:

       <b>x</b>
       <b>y</b>   The expressions which specify the top left corner coordinates of the box. It defaults to 0.

       <b>width,</b> <b>w</b>
       <b>height,</b> <b>h</b>
           The expressions which specify the width and height of the box; if 0 they are interpreted as the input
           width and height. It defaults to 0.

       <b>color,</b> <b>c</b>
           Specify the color of the box to write. For the general syntax  of  this  option,  check  the  <b>"Color"</b>
           <b>section</b>  <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ffmpeg-utils</b> <b>manual</b>. If the special value "invert" is used, the box edge color is the
           same as the video with inverted luma.

       <b>thickness,</b> <b>t</b>
           The expression which sets the thickness of the box edge.  A value of "fill" will create a filled box.
           Default value is 3.

           See below for the list of accepted constants.

       <b>replace</b>
           Applicable if the input has alpha. With value 1, the pixels of the painted  box  will  overwrite  the
           video's  color  and alpha pixels.  Default is 0, which composites the box onto the input, leaving the
           video's alpha intact.

       The parameters for <u>x</u>, <u>y</u>, <u>w</u> and <u>h</u> and <u>t</u> are expressions containing the following constants:

       <b>dar</b> The input display aspect ratio, it is the same as (<u>w</u> / <u>h</u>) * <u>sar</u>.

       <b>hsub</b>
       <b>vsub</b>
           horizontal and vertical chroma subsample values. For example for the pixel format "yuv422p" <u>hsub</u> is 2
           and <u>vsub</u> is 1.

       <b>in_h,</b> <b>ih</b>
       <b>in_w,</b> <b>iw</b>
           The input width and height.

       <b>sar</b> The input sample aspect ratio.

       <b>x</b>
       <b>y</b>   The x and y offset coordinates where the box is drawn.

       <b>w</b>
       <b>h</b>   The width and height of the drawn box.

       <b>box_source</b>
           Box source can be set as side_data_detection_bboxes if you want to use box data in  detection  bboxes
           of side data.

           If  <u>box_source</u> is set, the <u>x</u>, <u>y</u>, <u>width</u> and <u>height</u> will be ignored and still use box data in detection
           bboxes of side data. So please do not use this parameter if you were not sure about the box source.

       <b>t</b>   The thickness of the drawn box.

           These constants allow the <u>x</u>, <u>y</u>, <u>w</u>, <u>h</u> and <u>t</u> expressions to refer to each other, so you may for example
           specify "y=x/dar" or "h=w/dar".

       <u>Examples</u>

       <b>timecode</b>
           Set  the  initial timecode representation in "hh:mm:ss[:;.]ff" format. It can be used with or without
           text parameter. <u>timecode_rate</u> option must be specified.

       <b>timecode_rate,</b> <b>rate,</b> <b>r</b>
           Set the timecode frame rate (timecode only). Value will be rounded to nearest integer. Minimum  value
           is "1".  Drop-frame timecode is supported for frame rates 30 &amp; 60.

       <b>tc24hmax</b>
           If  set  to  1,  the  output  of  the  timecode  option  will  wrap around at 24 hours.  Default is 0
           (disabled).

       <b>text</b>
           The text string to be drawn. The text must be a sequence of UTF-8 encoded characters.  This parameter
           is mandatory if no file is specified with the parameter <u>textfile</u>.

       <b>textfile</b>
           A text file containing text to be drawn. The text must be a sequence of UTF-8 encoded characters.

           This parameter is mandatory if no text string is specified with the parameter <u>text</u>.

           If both <u>text</u> and <u>textfile</u> are specified, an error is thrown.

       <b>text_source</b>
           Text source should be set as side_data_detection_bboxes if you want to use  text  data  in  detection
           bboxes of side data.

           If  text source is set, <u>text</u> and <u>textfile</u> will be ignored and still use text data in detection bboxes
           of side data. So please do not use this parameter if you are not sure about the text source.

       <b>reload</b>
           The <u>textfile</u> will be reloaded at specified frame interval.  Be sure to update <u>textfile</u> atomically, or
           it may be read partially, or even fail.  Range is 0 to INT_MAX. Default is 0.

       <b>x</b>
       <b>y</b>   The expressions which specify the offsets where text will be drawn within the video frame.  They  are
           relative to the top/left border of the output image.

           The default value of <u>x</u> and <u>y</u> is "0".

           See below for the list of accepted constants and functions.

       The parameters for <u>x</u> and <u>y</u> are expressions containing the following constants and functions:

       <b>dar</b> input display aspect ratio, it is the same as (<u>w</u> / <u>h</u>) * <u>sar</u>

       <b>hsub</b>
       <b>vsub</b>
           horizontal and vertical chroma subsample values. For example for the pixel format "yuv422p" <u>hsub</u> is 2
           and <u>vsub</u> is 1.

       <b>line_h,</b> <b>lh</b>
           the height of each text line

       <b>main_h,</b> <b>h,</b> <b>H</b>
           the input height

       <b>main_w,</b> <b>w,</b> <b>W</b>
           the input width

       <b>max_glyph_a,</b> <b>ascent</b>
           the  maximum  distance  from  the baseline to the highest/upper grid coordinate used to place a glyph
           outline point, for all the rendered glyphs.  It is a positive value, due to  the  grid's  orientation
           with the Y axis upwards.

       <b>max_glyph_d,</b> <b>descent</b>
           the  maximum  distance  from the baseline to the lowest grid coordinate used to place a glyph outline
           point, for all the rendered glyphs.  This is a negative value, due to the  grid's  orientation,  with
           the Y axis upwards.

       <b>max_glyph_h</b>
           maximum  glyph  height, that is the maximum height for all the glyphs contained in the rendered text,
           it is equivalent to <u>ascent</u> - <u>descent</u>.

       <b>max_glyph_w</b>
           maximum glyph width, that is the maximum width for all the glyphs contained in the rendered text

       <b>font_a</b>
           the ascent size defined in the font metrics

       <b>font_d</b>
           the descent size defined in the font metrics

       <b>top_a</b>
           the maximum ascender of the glyphs of the first text line

       <b>bottom_d</b>

       <b>rand(min,</b> <b>max)</b>
           return a random number included between <u>min</u> and <u>max</u>

       <b>sar</b> The input sample aspect ratio.

       <b>t</b>   timestamp expressed in seconds, NAN if the input timestamp is unknown

       <b>text_h,</b> <b>th</b>
           the height of the rendered text

       <b>text_w,</b> <b>tw</b>
           the width of the rendered text

       <b>x</b>
       <b>y</b>   the x and y offset coordinates where the text is drawn.

           These parameters allow the <u>x</u> and <u>y</u> expressions to refer to each other, so you can for example specify
           "y=x/dar".

       <b>pict_type</b>
           A one character description of the current frame's picture type.

       <b>pkt_pos</b>
           The current packet's position in the input file or stream (in bytes, from the start of the input).  A
           value of -1 indicates this info is not available.

       <b>duration</b>
           The current packet's duration, in seconds.

       <b>pkt_size</b>
           The current packet's size (in bytes).

       <u>Text</u> <u>expansion</u>

       If  <b>expansion</b> is set to "strftime", the filter recognizes sequences accepted by the "strftime" C function
       in the provided text and expands them accordingly. Check the documentation of "strftime". This feature is
       deprecated in favor of "normal" expansion with the "gmtime" or "localtime" expansion functions.

       If <b>expansion</b> is set to "none", the text is printed verbatim.

       If <b>expansion</b> is set to "normal" (which is the default), the following expansion mechanism is used.

       The backslash character <b>\</b>, followed by any character, always expands to the second character.

       Sequences of the form "%{...}" are expanded. The text between the braces is  a  function  name,  possibly
       followed  by  arguments separated by ':'.  If the arguments contain special characters or delimiters (':'
       or '}'), they should be escaped.

       Note that they probably must also be escaped as the value for the <b>text</b>  option  in  the  filter  argument
       string  and  as the filter argument in the filtergraph description, and possibly also for the shell, that
       makes up to four levels of escaping; using a text file with the <b>textfile</b> option avoids these problems.

       The following functions are available:

       <b>expr,</b> <b>e</b>
           The expression evaluation result.

           It must take one argument specifying the expression to be evaluated, which accepts the same constants
           and functions as the <u>x</u> and <u>y</u> values. Note that not all constants should be used, for example the text
           size is not known when evaluating the expression, so the constants <u>text_w</u> and  <u>text_h</u>  will  have  an
           undefined value.

       <b>expr_int_format,</b> <b>eif</b>
           Evaluate the expression's value and output as formatted integer.

           The  first  argument  is  the  expression to be evaluated, just as for the <u>expr</u> function.  The second
           argument specifies the output format. Allowed values are <b>x</b>, <b>X</b>, <b>d</b> and <b>u</b>. They are treated  exactly  as
           in  the "printf" function.  The third parameter is optional and sets the number of positions taken by
           the output.  It can be used to add padding with zeros from the left.

       <b>gmtime</b>
           The time at which the filter is running, expressed in UTC.  It can accept an argument: a "strftime" C
           function format string.  The format string is extended to support the variable <u>%[1-6]N</u>  which  prints
           fractions of the second with optionally specified number of digits.

       <b>localtime</b>
           The  time  at  which  the  filter  is  running,  expressed  in the local time zone.  It can accept an
           argument: a "strftime" C function format string.  The  format  string  is  extended  to  support  the
           variable <u>%[1-6]N</u> which prints fractions of the second with optionally specified number of digits.

       <b>metadata</b>
           Frame metadata. Takes one or two arguments.

           The first argument is mandatory and specifies the metadata key.

           The  second  argument  is  optional  and specifies a default value, used when the metadata key is not
           found or empty.

           Available metadata can be identified by inspecting entries starting with  TAG  included  within  each
           frame section printed by running "ffprobe -show_frames".

           String metadata generated in filters leading to the drawtext filter are also available.

       <b>n,</b> <b>frame_num</b>
           The frame number, starting from 0.

       <b>pict_type</b>
           A one character description of the current picture type.

       <b>pts</b> The timestamp of the current frame.  It can take up to three arguments.

           The  first  argument  is  the  format of the timestamp; it defaults to "flt" for seconds as a decimal
           number with microsecond accuracy;  "hms"  stands  for  a  formatted  <u>[-]HH:MM:SS.mmm</u>  timestamp  with
           millisecond  accuracy.   "gmtime"  stands  for  the  timestamp  of  the  frame formatted as UTC time;
           "localtime" stands for the timestamp of the frame formatted as local time zone time.

           The second argument is an offset added to the timestamp.

           If the format is set to "hms", a third argument "24HH" may be supplied to present the  hour  part  of
           the formatted timestamp in 24h format (00-23).

           If  the  format  is  set to "localtime" or "gmtime", a third argument may be supplied: a "strftime" C
           function format string.  By default, <u>YYYY-MM-DD</u> <u>HH:MM:SS</u> format will be used.

       <u>Commands</u>

       This filter supports altering parameters via commands:

       <b>reinit</b>
           Alter existing filter parameters.

           Syntax for the argument is the same as for filter invocation, e.g.

                   fontsize=56:fontcolor=green:text='Hello World'

           Full filter invocation with sendcmd would look like this:

                   sendcmd=c='56.0 drawtext reinit fontsize=56\:fontcolor=green\:text=Hello\\ World'

           If the entire argument can't be parsed or applied as valid values then the filter will continue  with
           its existing parameters.

       The following options are also supported as <b>commands</b>:

       *&lt;x&gt;
       *&lt;y&gt;
       *&lt;alpha&gt;
       *&lt;fontsize&gt;
       *&lt;fontcolor&gt;
       *&lt;boxcolor&gt;
       *&lt;bordercolor&gt;
       *&lt;shadowcolor&gt;
       *&lt;box&gt;
       *&lt;boxw&gt;
       *&lt;boxh&gt;
       *&lt;boxborderw&gt;
       *&lt;line_spacing&gt;
       *&lt;text_align&gt;
       *&lt;shadowx&gt;
       *&lt;shadowy&gt;
       *&lt;borderw&gt;

       <u>Examples</u>

       •   Draw "Test Text" with font FreeSerif, using the default values for the optional parameters.

                   drawtext="fontfile=/usr/share/fonts/truetype/freefont/FreeSerif.ttf: text='Test Text'"

       •   Draw  'Test  Text'  with font FreeSerif of size 24 at position x=100 and y=50 (counting from the top-
           left corner of the screen), text is yellow with a red box around it. Both the text and the  box  have
           an opacity of 20%.

                   drawtext="fontfile=/usr/share/fonts/truetype/freefont/FreeSerif.ttf: text='Test Text':\

       •   Show text for 1 second every 3 seconds:

                   drawtext="fontfile=FreeSerif.ttf:fontcolor=white:x=100:y=x/dar:enable=lt(mod(t\,3)\,1):text='blink'"

       •   Use fontconfig to set the font. Note that the colons need to be escaped.

                   drawtext='fontfile=Linux Libertine O-40\\:style=Semibold:text=FFmpeg'

       •   Draw "Test Text" with font size dependent on height of the video.

                   drawtext="text='Test Text': fontsize=h/30: x=(w-text_w)/2: y=(h-text_h*2)"

       •   Print the date of a real-time encoding (see documentation for the "strftime" C function):

                   drawtext='fontfile=FreeSans.ttf:text=%{localtime\:%a %b %d %Y}'

       •   Show text fading in and out (appearing/disappearing):

   <b>edgedetect</b>
       Detect and draw edges. The filter uses the Canny Edge Detection algorithm.

       The filter accepts the following options:

       <b>low</b>
       <b>high</b>
           Set low and high threshold values used by the Canny thresholding algorithm.

           The  high threshold selects the "strong" edge pixels, which are then connected through 8-connectivity
           with the "weak" edge pixels selected by the low threshold.

           <u>low</u> and <u>high</u> threshold values must be chosen in the range [0,1], and <u>low</u> should be lesser or equal to
           <u>high</u>.

           Default value for <u>low</u> is "20/255", and default value for <u>high</u> is "50/255".

       <b>mode</b>
           Define the drawing mode.

           <b>wires</b>
               Draw white/gray wires on black background.

           <b>colormix</b>
               Mix the colors to create a paint/cartoon effect.

           <b>canny</b>
               Apply Canny edge detector on all selected planes.

           Default value is <u>wires</u>.

       <b>planes</b>
           Select planes for filtering. By default all available planes are filtered.

       <u>Examples</u>

       •   Standard edge detection with custom values for the hysteresis thresholding:

                   edgedetect=low=0.1:high=0.4

       •   Painting effect without thresholding:

                   edgedetect=mode=colormix:high=0

   <b>elbg</b>
       Apply a posterize effect using the ELBG (Enhanced LBG) algorithm.

       For each input image, the filter will compute the optimal mapping from the input to the output given  the
       codebook length, that is the number of distinct output colors.

       This filter accepts the following options.

       <b>codebook_length,</b> <b>l</b>
           Set  codebook  length.  The  value  must be a positive integer, and represents the number of distinct
           output colors. Default value is 256.

       <b>nb_steps,</b> <b>n</b>
           Set the maximum number of iterations to apply for computing the optimal mapping. The higher the value
           the better the result and the higher the computation time. Default value is 1.

       <b>seed,</b> <b>s</b>
           Set a random seed, must be an integer included between 0 and UINT32_MAX.  If  not  specified,  or  if
           explicitly set to -1, the filter will try to use a good random seed on a best effort basis.

       <b>pal8</b>
           Set  pal8  output  pixel  format.  This  option  does not work with codebook length greater than 256.
           Default is disabled.

       <b>use_alpha</b>
           Include alpha values in the quantization calculation. Allows creating palettized output images  (e.g.
           PNG8) with multiple alpha smooth blending.

   <b>entropy</b>
       Measure graylevel entropy in histogram of color channels of video frames.

       It accepts the following parameters:

       <b>mode</b>
           Can be either <u>normal</u> or <u>diff</u>. Default is <u>normal</u>.

           <u>diff</u>  mode  measures  entropy  of  histogram  delta  values,  absolute  differences between neighbour
           histogram values.

   <b>epx</b>
       Apply the EPX magnification filter which is designed for pixel art.

       It accepts the following option:

       <b>n</b>   Set the scaling dimension: 2 for "2xEPX", 3 for "3xEPX".  Default is 3.

   <b>eq</b>
       Set brightness, contrast, saturation and approximate gamma adjustment.

       The filter accepts the following options:

       <b>contrast</b>
           Set the contrast expression. The value must be a float value in range -1000.0 to 1000.0. The  default
           value is "1".

       <b>brightness</b>
           Set  the  brightness  expression.  The  value must be a float value in range -1.0 to 1.0. The default
           value is "0".

       <b>saturation</b>
           Set the saturation expression. The value must be a float in range 0.0 to 3.0. The  default  value  is
           "1".

       <b>gamma</b>
           Set the gamma expression. The value must be a float in range 0.1 to 10.0.  The default value is "1".

       <b>gamma_r</b>
           Set  the  gamma expression for red. The value must be a float in range 0.1 to 10.0. The default value
           is "1".

       <b>gamma_g</b>

   <b>field</b>
       Extract a single field from an interlaced image using stride arithmetic to avoid wasting  CPU  time.  The
       output frames are marked as non-interlaced.

       The filter accepts the following options:

       <b>type</b>
           Specify  whether to extract the top (if the value is 0 or "top") or the bottom field (if the value is
           1 or "bottom").

   <b>fieldhint</b>
       Create new frames by copying the top and bottom fields from surrounding frames supplied as numbers by the
       hint file.

       <b>hint</b>
           Set file containing hints: absolute/relative frame numbers.

           There must be one line for each frame in a clip. Each line must contain two numbers separated by  the
           comma,  optionally  followed  by "-" or "+".  Numbers supplied on each line of file can not be out of
           [N-1,N+1] where N is current frame number for "absolute" mode or out of [-1, 1] range for  "relative"
           mode.  First  number  tells  from which frame to pick up top field and second number tells from which
           frame to pick up bottom field.

           If optionally followed by "+" output frame will be marked as interlaced,  else  if  followed  by  "-"
           output  frame  will  be  marked  as  progressive,  else  it  will  be marked same as input frame.  If
           optionally followed by "t" output frame will use only top field, or in case of "b" it will  use  only
           bottom field.  If line starts with "#" or ";" that line is skipped.

       <b>mode</b>
           Can be item "absolute" or "relative" or "pattern". Default is "absolute".  The "pattern" mode is same
           as "relative" mode, except at last entry of file if there are more frames to process than "hint" file
           is seek back to start.

       Example of first several lines of "hint" file for "relative" mode:

               0,0 - # first frame
               1,0 - # second frame, use third's frame top field and second's frame bottom field
               1,0 - # third frame, use fourth's frame top field and third's frame bottom field
               1,0 -
               0,0 -
               0,0 -
               1,0 -
               1,0 -
               1,0 -
               0,0 -
               0,0 -
               1,0 -
               1,0 -
               1,0 -
               0,0 -

   <b>fieldmatch</b>
       Field  matching  filter  for  inverse  telecine. It is meant to reconstruct the progressive frames from a
       telecined stream. The filter does not drop duplicated frames, so to achieve a complete  inverse  telecine
       "fieldmatch" needs to be followed by a decimation filter such as <b>decimate</b> in the filtergraph.

       The  separation  of  the  field  matching  and  the decimation is notably motivated by the possibility of
       inserting a de-interlacing filter fallback between the two.  If the source has mixed telecined  and  real
       interlaced  content,  "fieldmatch"  will not be able to match fields for the interlaced parts.  But these
       remaining combed frames will be marked as interlaced, and thus can be de-interlaced  by  a  later  filter
       such as <b>yadif</b> before decimation.

       In  addition  to  the  various  configuration  options,  "fieldmatch" can take an optional second stream,
       activated through the <b>ppsrc</b> option. If enabled, the frames reconstruction will be based on the fields and
       frames from this second stream. This allows the first input to be pre-processed  in  order  to  help  the
       various  algorithms  of  the  filter,  while keeping the output lossless (assuming the fields are matched
       properly). Typically, a field-aware denoiser, or brightness/contrast adjustments can help.

       Note that this filter uses the same algorithms as TIVTC/TFM (AviSynth project) and VIVTC/VFM (VapourSynth
       project). The later is a light clone of TFM from which "fieldmatch" is based on. While the  semantic  and
       usage are very close, some behaviour and options names can differ.

       The  <b>decimate</b>  filter  currently  only  works  for  constant  frame  rate input.  If your input has mixed
       telecined (30fps) and progressive content with a lower framerate like 24fps use the following filterchain
       to produce the necessary cfr stream: "dejudder,fps=30000/1001,fieldmatch,decimate".

       The filter accepts the following options:

       <b>order</b>
           Specify the assumed field order of the input stream. Available values are:

           <b>auto</b>
               Auto detect parity (use FFmpeg's internal parity value).

           <b>bff</b> Assume bottom field first.

           <b>tff</b> Assume top field first.

           Note that it is sometimes recommended not to trust the parity announced by the stream.

           Default value is <u>auto</u>.

       <b>mode</b>
           Set the matching mode or strategy to use. <b>pc</b> mode is the safest in  the  sense  that  it  won't  risk
           creating  jerkiness  due  to  duplicate  frames  when possible, but if there are bad edits or blended
           fields it will end up outputting combed frames when a good match might actually exist. On  the  other
           hand,  <b>pcn_ub</b>  mode  is  the most risky in terms of creating jerkiness, but will almost always find a
           good frame if there is one. The other values are all somewhere in between <b>pc</b> and <b>pcn_ub</b> in  terms  of
           risking  jerkiness  and  creating  duplicate  frames versus finding good matches in sections with bad
           edits, orphaned fields, blended fields, etc.

           More details about p/c/n/u/b are available in <b>p/c/n/u/b</b> <b>meaning</b> section.

           Available values are:

           <b>pc</b>  2-way matching (p/c)

           <b>pc_n</b>
               2-way matching, and trying 3rd match if still combed (p/c + n)

           <b>pc_u</b>
               2-way matching, and trying 3rd match (same order) if still combed (p/c + u)

           <b>pc_n_ub</b>
               2-way matching, trying 3rd match if still combed, and trying 4th/5th matches if still combed (p/c
               + n + u/b)

           <b>pcn</b> 3-way matching (p/c/n)

           <b>pcn_ub</b>
               3-way matching, and trying 4th/5th matches if all 3 of  the  original  matches  are  detected  as
               combed (p/c/n + u/b)

           The  parenthesis  at the end indicate the matches that would be used for that mode assuming <b>order</b>=<u>tff</u>
           (and <b>field</b> on <u>auto</u> or <u>top</u>).

           In terms of speed <b>pc</b> mode is by far the fastest and <b>pcn_ub</b> is the slowest.

           Default value is <u>pc_n</u>.

       <b>ppsrc</b>
           Mark the main input stream as a pre-processed input, and enable the secondary  input  stream  as  the
           clean  source to pick the fields from. See the filter introduction for more details. It is similar to
           the <b>clip2</b> feature from VFM/TFM.

           Default value is 0 (disabled).

       <b>field</b>
           Set the field to match from. It is recommended to set this to the same  value  as  <b>order</b>  unless  you
           experience  matching  failures with that setting. In certain circumstances changing the field that is
           used to match from can have a large impact on matching performance. Available values are:

           <b>auto</b>
               Automatic (same value as <b>order</b>).

           <b>bottom</b>
               Match from the bottom field.

           <b>top</b> Match from the top field.

           Default value is <u>auto</u>.

       <b>mchroma</b>
           Set whether or not chroma is included during the match comparisons. In most cases it  is  recommended
           to  leave  this  enabled.  You should set this to 0 only if your clip has bad chroma problems such as
           heavy rainbowing or other artifacts. Setting this to 0 could also be used to speed things up  at  the
           cost of some accuracy.

           Default value is 1.

       <b>y0</b>
       <b>y1</b>  These  define an exclusion band which excludes the lines between <b>y0</b> and <b>y1</b> from being included in the
           field matching decision. An exclusion band can be used to ignore subtitles, a logo, or  other  things
           that may interfere with the matching. <b>y0</b> sets the starting scan line and <b>y1</b> sets the ending line; all
           lines in between <b>y0</b> and <b>y1</b> (including <b>y0</b> and <b>y1</b>) will be ignored. Setting <b>y0</b> and <b>y1</b> to the same value
           will disable the feature.  <b>y0</b> and <b>y1</b> defaults to 0.

       <b>scthresh</b>
           Set  the  scene  change detection threshold as a percentage of maximum change on the luma plane. Good
           values are in the "[8.0, 14.0]" range. Scene change detection is only relevant in case  <b>combmatch</b>=<u>sc</u>.
           The range for <b>scthresh</b> is "[0.0, 100.0]".

           Default value is 12.0.

       <b>combmatch</b>
           When  <b>combatch</b>  is  not  <u>none</u>,  "fieldmatch" will take into account the combed scores of matches when
           deciding what match to use as the final match. Available values are:

           <b>none</b>
               No final matching based on combed scores.

           <b>sc</b>  Combed scores are only used when a scene change is detected.

           <b>full</b>
               Use combed scores all the time.

           Default is <u>sc</u>.

       <b>combdbg</b>
           Force "fieldmatch" to calculate the combed metrics for certain matches and print them.  This  setting
           is known as <b>micout</b> in TFM/VFM vocabulary.  Available values are:

           <b>none</b>
               No forced calculation.

           <b>pcn</b> Force p/c/n calculations.

           <b>pcnub</b>
               Force p/c/n/u/b calculations.

           Default value is <u>none</u>.

       <b>cthresh</b>
           This  is  the  area  combing threshold used for combed frame detection. This essentially controls how
           "strong" or "visible" combing must be to be detected.   Larger  values  mean  combing  must  be  more
           visible  and  smaller  values mean combing can be less visible or strong and still be detected. Valid
           settings are from -1 (every pixel will be detected as combed) to 255 (no pixel will  be  detected  as
           combed). This is basically a pixel difference value. A good range is "[8, 12]".

           Default value is 9.

       <b>chroma</b>
           Sets  whether  or  not  chroma is considered in the combed frame decision.  Only disable this if your
           source has chroma problems (rainbowing,  etc.)  that  are  causing  problems  for  the  combed  frame
           detection with chroma enabled. Actually, using <b>chroma</b>=<u>0</u> is usually more reliable, except for the case
           where there is chroma only combing in the source.

           Default value is 0.

       <b>blockx</b>
       <b>blocky</b>
           Respectively  set  the  x-axis and y-axis size of the window used during combed frame detection. This
           has to do with the size of the area in which <b>combpel</b> pixels are required to be detected as combed for
           a frame to be declared combed. See the <b>combpel</b> parameter description for more info.  Possible  values
           are any number that is a power of 2 starting at 4 and going up to 512.

           Default value is 16.

       <b>combpel</b>
           The number of combed pixels inside any of the <b>blocky</b> by <b>blockx</b> size blocks on the frame for the frame
           to  be  detected  as  combed.  While <b>cthresh</b> controls how "visible" the combing must be, this setting
           controls "how much" combing there must be in any localized area (a window defined by the  <b>blockx</b>  and
           <b>blocky</b> settings) on the frame. Minimum value is 0 and maximum is "blocky x blockx" (at which point no
           frames will ever be detected as combed). This setting is known as <b>MI</b> in TFM/VFM vocabulary.

           Default value is 80.

       <u>p/c/n/u/b</u> <u>meaning</u>

       p/c/n

       We assume the following telecined stream:

               Top fields:     1 2 2 3 4
               Bottom fields:  1 2 3 4 4

       The  numbers  correspond  to  the  progressive frame the fields relate to. Here, the first two frames are
       progressive, the 3rd and 4th are combed, and so on.

       When "fieldmatch" is configured to run a matching from bottom  (<b>field</b>=<u>bottom</u>)  this  is  how  this  input
       stream get transformed:

               Input stream:
                               T     1 2 2 3 4
                               B     1 2 3 4 4   &lt;-- matching reference

               Matches:              c c n n c

               Output stream:
                               T     1 2 3 4 4
                               B     1 2 3 4 4

       As  a  result  of  the field matching, we can see that some frames get duplicated.  To perform a complete
       inverse telecine, you need to rely on a decimation filter after this  operation.  See  for  instance  the
       <b>decimate</b> filter.

       The same operation now matching from top fields (<b>field</b>=<u>top</u>) looks like this:

               Input stream:
                               T     1 2 2 3 4   &lt;-- matching reference
                               B     1 2 3 4 4

               Matches:              c c p p c

               Output stream:
                               T     1 2 2 3 4
                               B     1 2 2 3 4

       In  these  examples, we can see what <u>p</u>, <u>c</u> and <u>n</u> mean; basically, they refer to the frame and field of the
       opposite parity:

       *&lt;<u>p</u> matches the field of the opposite parity in the previous frame&gt;
       *&lt;<u>c</u> matches the field of the opposite parity in the current frame&gt;
       *&lt;<u>n</u> matches the field of the opposite parity in the next frame&gt;

       u/b

       The <u>u</u> and <u>b</u> matching are a bit special in the sense that they match from the opposite parity flag. In the
       following examples, we assume that we are currently matching the 2nd frame (Top:2,  bottom:2).  According
       to the match, a 'x' is placed above and below each matched fields.

       With bottom matching (<b>field</b>=<u>bottom</u>):

               Match:           c         p           n          b          u

                                x       x               x        x          x
                 Top          1 2 2     1 2 2       1 2 2      1 2 2      1 2 2
                 Bottom       1 2 3     1 2 3       1 2 3      1 2 3      1 2 3
                                x         x           x        x              x

               Output frames:
                                2          1          2          2          2
                                2          2          2          1          3

       With top matching (<b>field</b>=<u>top</u>):

               Match:           c         p           n          b          u

                                x         x           x        x              x
                 Top          1 2 2     1 2 2       1 2 2      1 2 2      1 2 2
                 Bottom       1 2 3     1 2 3       1 2 3      1 2 3      1 2 3
                                x       x               x        x          x

               Output frames:
                                2          2          2          1          2
                                2          1          3          2          2

       <u>Examples</u>

       Simple IVTC of a top field first telecined stream:

               fieldmatch=order=tff:combmatch=none, decimate

       Advanced IVTC, with fallback on <b>yadif</b> for still combed frames:

               fieldmatch=order=tff:combmatch=full, yadif=deint=interlaced, decimate

   <b>fieldorder</b>
       Transform the field order of the input video.

       It accepts the following parameters:

       <b>order</b>
           The output field order. Valid values are <u>tff</u> for top field first or <u>bff</u> for bottom field first.

       The default value is <b>tff</b>.

       The  transformation  is  done  by  shifting  the  picture content up or down by one line, and filling the
       remaining line with appropriate picture content.  This method is consistent  with  most  broadcast  field
       order converters.

       If  the input video is not flagged as being interlaced, or it is already flagged as being of the required
       output field order, then this filter does not alter the incoming video.

       It is very useful when converting to or from PAL DV material, which is bottom field first.

       For example:

               ffmpeg -i in.vob -vf "fieldorder=bff" out.dv

   <b>fillborders</b>
       Fill borders of the input video, without changing video stream  dimensions.   Sometimes  video  can  have
       garbage at the four edges and you may not want to crop video input to keep size multiple of some number.

       This filter accepts the following options:

       <b>left</b>
           Number of pixels to fill from left border.

       <b>right</b>
           Number of pixels to fill from right border.

       <b>top</b> Number of pixels to fill from top border.

       <b>bottom</b>
           Number of pixels to fill from bottom border.

       <b>mode</b>
           Set fill mode.

           It accepts the following values:

           <b>smear</b>
               fill pixels using outermost pixels

           <b>mirror</b>
               fill pixels using mirroring (half sample symmetric)

           <b>fixed</b>
               fill pixels with constant value

           <b>reflect</b>
               fill pixels using reflecting (whole sample symmetric)

           <b>wrap</b>
               fill pixels using wrapping

           <b>fade</b>
               fade pixels to constant value

           <b>margins</b>
               fill pixels at top and bottom with weighted averages pixels near borders

           Default is <u>smear</u>.

       <b>color</b>
           Set color for pixels in fixed or fade mode. Default is <u>black</u>.

       <u>Commands</u>

       This  filter supports same <b>commands</b> as options.  The command accepts the same syntax of the corresponding
       option.

       If the specified expression is not valid, it is kept at its current value.

   <b>find_rect</b>
       Find a rectangular object in the input video.

       The object to search for must be specified as a gray8 image specified with the <b>object</b> option.

       For each possible match, a score is computed. If the score reaches the specified threshold, the object is
       considered found.

       If the input video contains multiple instances of the object, the filter will find only one of them.

       When an object is found, the following metadata entries are set in the matching frame:

       <b>lavfi.rect.w</b>
           width of object

       <b>lavfi.rect.h</b>
           height of object

       <b>lavfi.rect.x</b>
           x position of object

       <b>lavfi.rect.y</b>
           y position of object

       <b>lavfi.rect.score</b>
           match score of the found object

       It accepts the following options:

       <b>object</b>
           Filepath of the object image, needs to be in gray8.

       <b>threshold</b>
           Detection threshold, expressed as a decimal number in the range 0-1.

           A threshold value of 0.01 means only exact matches, a  threshold  of  0.99  means  almost  everything
           matches.

           Default value is 0.5.

       <b>mipmaps</b>
           Number of mipmaps, default is 3.

       <b>xmin,</b> <b>ymin,</b> <b>xmax,</b> <b>ymax</b>
           Specifies the rectangle in which to search.

       <b>discard</b>
           Discard frames where object is not detected. Default is disabled.

       <u>Examples</u>

       •   Cover a rectangular object by the supplied image of a given video using <b>ffmpeg</b>:

                   ffmpeg -i file.ts -vf find_rect=newref.pgm,cover_rect=cover.jpg:mode=cover new.mkv

       •   Find the position of an object in each frame using <b>ffprobe</b> and write it to a log file:

                   ffprobe -f lavfi movie=test.mp4,find_rect=object=object.pgm:threshold=0.3 \
                     -show_entries frame=pkt_pts_time:frame_tags=lavfi.rect.x,lavfi.rect.y \
                     -of csv -o find_rect.csv

   <b>floodfill</b>
       Flood area with values of same pixel components with another values.

       It accepts the following options:

       <b>x</b>   Set pixel x coordinate.

       <b>y</b>   Set pixel y coordinate.

       <b>s0</b>  Set source #0 component value.

       <b>s1</b>  Set source #1 component value.

       <b>s2</b>  Set source #2 component value.

       <b>s3</b>  Set source #3 component value.

       <b>d0</b>  Set destination #0 component value.

       <b>d1</b>  Set destination #1 component value.

       <b>d2</b>  Set destination #2 component value.

       <b>d3</b>  Set destination #3 component value.

   <b>format</b>
       Convert  the input video to one of the specified pixel formats.  Libavfilter will try to pick one that is
       suitable as input to the next filter.

       It accepts the following parameters:

       <b>pix_fmts</b>
           A '|'-separated list of pixel format names, such as "pix_fmts=yuv420p|monow|rgb24".

       <b>color_spaces</b>
           A '|'-separated list of color space names, such as "color_spaces=bt709|bt470bg|bt2020nc".

       <b>color_ranges</b>
           A '|'-separated list of color range names, such as "color_spaces=tv|pc".

       <u>Examples</u>

       •   Convert the input video to the <u>yuv420p</u> format

                   format=pix_fmts=yuv420p

           Convert the input video to any of the formats in the list

                   format=pix_fmts=yuv420p|yuv444p|yuv410p

   <b>fps</b>
       Convert the video to specified constant frame rate by duplicating or dropping frames as necessary.

       It accepts the following parameters:

       <b>fps</b> The desired output frame rate. It accepts expressions containing the following constants:

           <b>source_fps</b>
               The input's frame rate

           <b>ntsc</b>
               NTSC frame rate of "30000/1001"

           <b>pal</b> PAL frame rate of 25.0

           <b>film</b>
               Film frame rate of 24.0

           <b>ntsc_film</b>
               NTSC-film frame rate of "24000/1001"

           The default is 25.

       <b>start_time</b>
           Assume the first PTS should be the given value, in seconds. This allows for padding/trimming  at  the
           start  of  stream.  By  default,  no  assumption  is made about the first frame's expected PTS, so no
           padding or trimming is done.  For example, this  could  be  set  to  0  to  pad  the  beginning  with
           duplicates  of  the first frame if a video stream starts after the audio stream or to trim any frames
           with a negative PTS.

       <b>round</b>
           Timestamp (PTS) rounding method.

           Possible values are:

           <b>zero</b>
               round towards 0

           <b>inf</b> round away from 0

           <b>down</b>
               round towards -infinity

           <b>up</b>  round towards +infinity

           <b>near</b>
               round to nearest

           The default is "near".

       <b>eof_action</b>
           Action performed when reading the last frame.

           Possible values are:

           <b>round</b>
               Use same timestamp rounding method as used for other frames.

           <b>pass</b>
               Pass through last frame if input duration has not been reached yet.

           The default is "round".

       Alternatively, the options can be specified as a flat string: <u>fps</u>[:<u>start_time</u>[:<u>round</u>]].

       See also the <b>setpts</b> filter.

       <u>Examples</u>

       •   A typical usage in order to set the fps to 25:

                   fps=fps=25

       •   Sets the fps to 24, using abbreviation and rounding method to round to nearest:

                   fps=fps=film:round=near

   <b>framepack</b>
       Pack two different video streams into a stereoscopic video, setting proper metadata on supported  codecs.
       The  two  views  should  have the same size and framerate and processing will stop when the shorter video
       ends. Please note that you may conveniently adjust view properties with the <b>scale</b> and <b>fps</b> filters.

       It accepts the following parameters:

       <b>format</b>
           The desired packing format. Supported values are:

           <b>sbs</b> The views are next to each other (default).

           <b>tab</b> The views are on top of each other.

           <b>lines</b>
               The views are packed by line.

           <b>columns</b>
               The views are packed by column.

           <b>frameseq</b>
               The views are temporally interleaved.

       Some examples:

               # Convert left and right views into a frame-sequential video
               ffmpeg -i LEFT -i RIGHT -filter_complex framepack=frameseq OUTPUT

               # Convert views into a side-by-side video with the same output resolution as the input
               ffmpeg -i LEFT -i RIGHT -filter_complex [0:v]scale=w=iw/2[left],[1:v]scale=w=iw/2[right],[left][right]framepack=sbs OUTPUT

   <b>framerate</b>
       Change the frame rate by interpolating new video output frames from the source frames.

       This filter is not designed to function correctly with interlaced media. If you wish to change the  frame
       rate  of  interlaced media then you are required to deinterlace before this filter and re-interlace after
       this filter.

       A description of the accepted options follows.

       <b>fps</b> Specify the output frames per second. This option can also be specified as a value alone. The default
           is 50.

       <b>interp_start</b>
           Specify the start of a range where the output frame will be created as a linear interpolation of  two
           frames. The range is [0-255], the default is 15.

       <b>interp_end</b>
           Specify  the  end  of a range where the output frame will be created as a linear interpolation of two
           frames. The range is [0-255], the default is 240.

       <b>scene</b>
           Specify the level at which a scene change is detected as a value between 0 and 100 to indicate a  new
           scene; a low value reflects a low probability for the current frame to introduce a new scene, while a
           higher value means the current frame is more likely to be one.  The default is 8.2.

       <b>flags</b>
           Specify flags influencing the filter process.

           Available value for <u>flags</u> is:

           <b>scene_change_detect,</b> <b>scd</b>
               Enable  scene  change  detection  using  the  value of the option <u>scene</u>.  This flag is enabled by
               default.

   <b>framestep</b>
       Select one frame every N-th frame.

       This filter accepts the following option:

       <b>step</b>
           Select frame after every "step" frames.  Allowed values are positive integers higher than 0.  Default
           value is 1.

   <b>freezedetect</b>
       Detect frozen video.

       This  filter  logs  a  message  and  sets  frame  metadata  when  it  detects that the input video has no
       significant change in content during a specified duration.  Video freeze detection  calculates  the  mean
       average absolute difference of all the components of video frames and compares it to a noise floor.

       The  printed  times and duration are expressed in seconds. The "lavfi.freezedetect.freeze_start" metadata
       key is set on the first frame whose timestamp equals or exceeds the detection duration  and  it  contains
       the   timestamp   of  the  first  frame  of  the  freeze.  The  "lavfi.freezedetect.freeze_duration"  and
       "lavfi.freezedetect.freeze_end" metadata keys are set on the first frame after the freeze.

       The filter accepts the following options:

       <b>noise,</b> <b>n</b>
           Set noise tolerance. Can be specified in dB (in case "dB" is appended to the specified value) or as a
           difference ratio between 0 and 1. Default is -60dB, or 0.001.

       <b>duration,</b> <b>d</b>
           Set freeze duration until notification (default is 2 seconds).

   <b>freezeframes</b>
       Freeze video frames.

       This filter freezes video frames using frame from 2nd input.

       The filter accepts the following options:

       <b>first</b>
           Set number of first frame from which to start freeze.

       <b>last</b>
           Set number of last frame from which to end freeze.

       <b>replace</b>
           Set number of frame from 2nd input which will be used instead of replaced frames.

   <b>frei0r</b>
       Apply a frei0r effect to the input video.

       To enable the compilation of this filter, you need to install the frei0r header and configure FFmpeg with
       "--enable-frei0r".

       It accepts the following parameters:

       <b>filter_name</b>
           The name of the frei0r effect to load. If the environment variable <b>FREI0R_PATH</b> is defined, the frei0r
           effect is searched for  in  each  of  the  directories  specified  by  the  colon-separated  list  in
           <b>FREI0R_PATH</b>.   Otherwise, the standard frei0r paths are searched, in this order: <u>HOME/.frei0r-1/lib/</u>,
           <u>/usr/local/lib/frei0r-1/</u>, <u>/usr/lib/frei0r-1/</u>.

       <b>filter_params</b>
           A '|'-separated list of parameters to pass to the frei0r effect.

       A frei0r effect parameter can be a boolean (its value is either "y" or "n"), a double, a color (specified
       as <u>R</u>/<u>G</u>/<u>B</u>, where <u>R</u>, <u>G</u>, and <u>B</u> are floating point numbers  between  0.0  and  1.0,  inclusive)  or  a  color
       description as specified in the <b>"Color"</b> <b>section</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ffmpeg-utils</b> <b>manual</b>, a position (specified as <u>X</u>/<u>Y</u>,
       where <u>X</u> and <u>Y</u> are floating point numbers) and/or a string.

       The  number and types of parameters depend on the loaded effect. If an effect parameter is not specified,
       the default value is set.

       <u>Examples</u>

       •   Apply the distort0r effect, setting the first two double parameters:

                   frei0r=filter_name=distort0r:filter_params=0.5|0.01

       •   Apply the colordistance effect, taking a color as the first parameter:

                   frei0r=colordistance:0.2/0.3/0.4
                   frei0r=colordistance:violet
                   frei0r=colordistance:0x112233

       •   Apply the perspective effect, specifying the top left and top right image positions:

                   frei0r=perspective:0.2/0.2|0.8/0.2

       For more information, see &lt;<b><a href="http://frei0r.dyne.org">http://frei0r.dyne.org</a></b>&gt;

       <u>Commands</u>

       This filter supports the <b>filter_params</b> option as <b>commands</b>.

   <b>fspp</b>
       Apply fast and simple postprocessing. It is a faster version of <b>spp</b>.

       It splits (I)DCT into horizontal/vertical passes. Unlike the simple post- processing filter, one of  them
       is performed once per block, not per pixel.  This allows for much higher speed.

       The filter accepts the following options:

       <b>quality</b>
           Set  quality.  This  option  defines the number of levels for averaging. It accepts an integer in the
           range 4-5. Default value is 4.

       <b>qp</b>  Force a constant quantization parameter. It accepts an integer in range 0-63.  If not set, the filter
           will use the QP from the video stream (if available).

       <b>strength</b>
           Set filter strength. It accepts an integer in range -15 to 32. Lower values  mean  more  details  but
           also  more artifacts, while higher values make the image smoother but also blurrier. Default value is
           0 − PSNR optimal.

       <b>use_bframe_qp</b>
           Enable the use of the QP from the B-Frames if set to 1. Using this option may cause flicker since the
           B-Frames have often larger QP. Default is 0 (not enabled).

   <b>fsync</b>
       Synchronize video frames with an external mapping from a file.

       For each input PTS given in the map file it either drops or  creates  as  many  frames  as  necessary  to
       recreate the sequence of output frames given in the map file.

       This filter is useful to recreate the output frames of a framerate conversion by the <b>fps</b> filter, recorded
       into  a map file using the ffmpeg option "-stats_mux_pre", and do further processing to the corresponding
       frames e.g. quality comparison.

       Each line of the map file must contain three items per input frame, the input PTS (decimal),  the  output
       PTS  (decimal)  and  the  output  TIMEBASE  (decimal/decimal),  seperated  by  a space.  This file format
       corresponds to the output of "-stats_mux_pre_fmt="{ptsi} {pts} {tb}"".

       The filter assumes the map file is sorted by increasing input PTS.

       The filter accepts the following options:

       <b>file,</b> <b>f</b>
           The filename of the map file to be used.

       Example:

               # Convert a video to 25 fps and record a MAP_FILE file with the default format of this filter
               ffmpeg -i INPUT -vf fps=fps=25 -stats_mux_pre MAP_FILE -stats_mux_pre_fmt "{ptsi} {pts} {tb}" OUTPUT

               # Sort MAP_FILE by increasing input PTS
               sort -n MAP_FILE

               # Use INPUT, OUTPUT and the MAP_FILE from above to compare the corresponding frames in INPUT and OUTPUT via SSIM
               ffmpeg -i INPUT -i OUTPUT -filter_complex '[0:v]fsync=file=MAP_FILE[ref];[1:v][ref]ssim' -f null -

   <b>gblur</b>
       Apply Gaussian blur filter.

       The filter accepts the following options:

       <b>sigma</b>
           Set horizontal sigma, standard deviation of Gaussian blur. Default is 0.5.

       <b>steps</b>
           Set number of steps for Gaussian approximation. Default is 1.

       <b>planes</b>
           Set which planes to filter. By default all planes are filtered.

       <b>sigmaV</b>
           Set vertical sigma, if negative it will be same as "sigma".  Default is -1.

       <u>Commands</u>

       This filter supports same commands as options.  The command accepts the same syntax of the  corresponding
       option.

       If the specified expression is not valid, it is kept at its current value.

   <b>geq</b>
       Apply generic equation to each pixel.

       The filter accepts the following options:

       <b>lum_expr,</b> <b>lum</b>
           Set the luma expression.

       <b>cb_expr,</b> <b>cb</b>
           Set the chrominance blue expression.

       <b>cr_expr,</b> <b>cr</b>
           Set the chrominance red expression.

       <b>alpha_expr,</b> <b>a</b>
           Set the alpha expression.

       <b>red_expr,</b> <b>r</b>
           Set the red expression.

       <b>green_expr,</b> <b>g</b>
           Set the green expression.

       <b>blue_expr,</b> <b>b</b>
           Set the blue expression.

       The  colorspace  is  selected  according  to  the  specified options. If one of the <b>lum_expr</b>, <b>cb_expr</b>, or
       <b>cr_expr</b> options is specified, the filter will automatically select a YCbCr  colorspace.  If  one  of  the
       <b>red_expr</b>, <b>green_expr</b>, or <b>blue_expr</b> options is specified, it will select an RGB colorspace.

       If  one  of  the  chrominance  expression  is  not  defined,  it falls back on the other one. If no alpha
       expression is specified it will evaluate to  opaque  value.   If  none  of  chrominance  expressions  are
       specified, they will evaluate to the luma expression.

       The expressions can use the following variables and functions:

       <b>N</b>   The sequential number of the filtered frame, starting from 0.

       <b>X</b>
       <b>Y</b>   The coordinates of the current sample.

       <b>W</b>
       <b>H</b>   The width and height of the image.

       <b>SW</b>
       <b>SH</b>  Width  and  height  scale  depending  on  the  currently  filtered plane. It is the ratio between the
           corresponding luma plane number of pixels and the current plane ones. E.g. for  YUV4:2:0  the  values
           are "1,1" for the luma plane, and "0.5,0.5" for chroma planes.

       <b>T</b>   Time of the current frame, expressed in seconds.

       <b>p(x,</b> <b>y)</b>
           Return the value of the pixel at location (<u>x</u>,<u>y</u>) of the current plane.

       <b>lum(x,</b> <b>y)</b>
           Return the value of the pixel at location (<u>x</u>,<u>y</u>) of the luma plane.

       <b>cb(x,</b> <b>y)</b>
           Return  the  value  of  the  pixel at location (<u>x</u>,<u>y</u>) of the blue-difference chroma plane. Return 0 if
           there is no such plane.

       <b>cr(x,</b> <b>y)</b>
           Return the value of the pixel at location (<u>x</u>,<u>y</u>) of the red-difference chroma plane. Return 0 if there
           is no such plane.

       <b>r(x,</b> <b>y)</b>
       <b>g(x,</b> <b>y)</b>
       <b>b(x,</b> <b>y)</b>
           Return the value of the pixel at location (<u>x</u>,<u>y</u>) of the red/green/blue component. Return 0 if there is
           no such component.

       <b>alpha(x,</b> <b>y)</b>
           Return the value of the pixel at location (<u>x</u>,<u>y</u>) of the alpha plane. Return 0  if  there  is  no  such
           plane.

       <b>psum(x,y),</b> <b>lumsum(x,</b> <b>y),</b> <b>cbsum(x,y),</b> <b>crsum(x,y),</b> <b>rsum(x,y),</b> <b>gsum(x,y),</b> <b>bsum(x,y),</b> <b>alphasum(x,y)</b>
           Sum  of  sample  values  in  the rectangle from (0,0) to (x,y), this allows obtaining sums of samples
           within a rectangle. See the functions without the sum postfix.

       <b>interpolation</b>
           Set one of interpolation methods:

           <b>nearest,</b> <b>n</b>
           <b>bilinear,</b> <b>b</b>

           Default is bilinear.

       For functions, if <u>x</u> and <u>y</u> are outside the area, the value will be automatically  clipped  to  the  closer
       edge.

       Please  note  that  this  filter  can  use  multiple  threads  in which case each slice will have its own
       expression state. If you want to use only a single expression state because your  expressions  depend  on
       previous state then you should limit the number of filter threads to 1.

       <u>Examples</u>

       •   Flip the image horizontally:

                   geq=p(W-X\,Y)

       •   Generate a bidimensional sine wave, with angle "PI/3" and a wavelength of 100 pixels:

                   geq=128 + 100*sin(2*(PI/100)*(cos(PI/3)*(X-50*T) + sin(PI/3)*Y)):128:128

       •   Generate a fancy enigmatic moving light:

                   nullsrc=s=256x256,geq=<a href="../man1/random.1.html">random</a>(1)/hypot(X-cos(N*0.07)*W/2-W/2\,Y-sin(N*0.09)*H/2-H/2)^2*1000000*sin(N*0.02):128:128

       •   Generate a quick emboss effect:

                   format=gray,geq=lum_expr='(p(X,Y)+(256-p(X-4,Y-4)))/2'

       •   Modify RGB components depending on pixel position:

                   geq=r='X/W*r(X,Y)':g='(1-X/W)*g(X,Y)':b='(H-Y)/H*b(X,Y)'

       •   Create a radial gradient that is the same size as the input (also see the <b>vignette</b> filter):

                   geq=lum=255*gauss((X/W-0.5)*3)*gauss((Y/H-0.5)*3)/<a href="../man0/gauss.0.html">gauss</a>(0)/<a href="../man0/gauss.0.html">gauss</a>(0),format=gray

   <b>gradfun</b>
       Fix  the  banding artifacts that are sometimes introduced into nearly flat regions by truncation to 8-bit
       color depth.  Interpolate the gradients that should go where the bands are, and dither them.

       It is designed for playback only.  Do not use it prior to lossy compression, because compression tends to
       lose the dither and bring back the bands.

       It accepts the following parameters:

       <b>strength</b>
           The maximum amount by which the filter will change any one pixel. This  is  also  the  threshold  for
           detecting nearly flat regions. Acceptable values range from .51 to 64; the default value is 1.2. Out-
           of-range values will be clipped to the valid range.

       <b>radius</b>
           The  neighborhood  to  fit  the  gradient  to. A larger radius makes for smoother gradients, but also
           prevents the filter from modifying the pixels near detailed regions. Acceptable values are 8-32;  the
           default value is 16. Out-of-range values will be clipped to the valid range.

       Alternatively, the options can be specified as a flat string: <u>strength</u>[:<u>radius</u>]

       <u>Examples</u>

       •   Apply the filter with a 3.5 strength and radius of 8:

                   gradfun=3.5:8

       •   Specify radius, omitting the strength (which will fall-back to the default value):

                   gradfun=radius=8

   <b>graphmonitor</b>
       Show various filtergraph stats.

       With  this  filter  one can debug complete filtergraph.  Especially issues with links filling with queued
       frames.

           Set upper limit for video rate of output stream, Default value is <u>25</u>.   This  guarantee  that  output
           video frame rate will not be higher than this value.

   <b>grayworld</b>
       A color constancy filter that applies color correction based on the grayworld assumption

       See:
       &lt;<b>https://www.researchgate.net/publication/275213614_A_New_Color_Correction_Method_for_Underwater_Imaging</b>&gt;

       The  algorithm   uses linear light, so input data should be linearized beforehand (and possibly correctly
       tagged).

               ffmpeg -i INPUT -vf zscale=transfer=linear,grayworld,zscale=transfer=bt709,format=yuv420p OUTPUT

   <b>greyedge</b>
       A color constancy variation filter which  estimates  scene  illumination  via  grey  edge  algorithm  and
       corrects the scene colors accordingly.

       See: &lt;<b>https://staff.science.uva.nl/th.gevers/pub/GeversTIP07.pdf</b>&gt;

       The filter accepts the following options:

       <b>difford</b>
           The  order  of  differentiation  to  be  applied  on the scene. Must be chosen in the range [0,2] and
           default value is 1.

       <b>minknorm</b>
           The Minkowski parameter to be used for calculating the Minkowski distance.  Must  be  chosen  in  the
           range  [0,20] and default value is 1. Set to 0 for getting max value instead of calculating Minkowski
           distance.

       <b>sigma</b>
           The standard deviation of Gaussian blur to be applied on the scene.  Must  be  chosen  in  the  range
           [0,1024.0]  and default value = 1. floor( <u>sigma</u> * <b><a href="../man3/break_off_sigma.3.html">break_off_sigma</a></b>(3) ) can't be equal to 0 if <u>difford</u>
           is greater than 0.

       <u>Examples</u>

       •   Grey Edge:

                   greyedge=difford=1:minknorm=5:sigma=2

       •   Max Edge:

                   greyedge=difford=1:minknorm=0:sigma=2

   <b>guided</b>
       Apply guided filter for edge-preserving smoothing, dehazing and so on.

       The filter accepts the following options:

       <b>radius</b>
           Set the box radius in pixels.  Allowed range is 1 to 20. Default is 3.

       <b>eps</b> Set regularization parameter (with square).  Allowed range is 0 to 1. Default is 0.01.

       <b>mode</b>
           Set filter mode. Can be "basic" or "fast".  Default is "basic".

       <b>sub</b> Set subsampling ratio for "fast" mode.  Range is 2 to 64. Default is 4.   No  subsampling  occurs  in
           "basic" mode.

       <b>guidance</b>
           Set  guidance  mode. Can be "off" or "on". Default is "off".  If "off", single input is required.  If
           "on", two inputs of the same resolution and pixel format are required.  The second  input  serves  as
           the guidance.

       <b>planes</b>
           Set planes to filter. Default is first only.

       <u>Commands</u>

       This filter supports the all above options as <b>commands</b>.

       <u>Examples</u>

       •   Edge-preserving smoothing with guided filter:

                   ffmpeg -i in.png -vf guided out.png

       •   Dehazing,   structure-transferring  filtering,  detail  enhancement  with  guided  filter.   For  the
           generation   of   guidance   image,   refer   to    paper    "Guided    Image    Filtering".     See:

   <b>haldclut</b>
       Apply a Hald CLUT to a video stream.

       First  input is the video stream to process, and second one is the Hald CLUT.  The Hald CLUT input can be
       a simple picture or a complete video stream.

       The filter accepts the following options:

       <b>clut</b>
           Set which CLUT video frames will be processed from second input stream, can be <u>first</u> or <u>all</u>.  Default
           is <u>all</u>.

       <b>shortest</b>
           Force termination when the shortest input terminates. Default is 0.

       <b>repeatlast</b>
           Continue  applying  the  last CLUT after the end of the stream. A value of 0 disable the filter after
           the last frame of the CLUT is reached.  Default is 1.

       "haldclut" also has the same interpolation options as <b>lut3d</b> (both filters share the same internals).

       This filter also supports the <b>framesync</b> options.

       More information about the Hald CLUT can be found on Eskil Steenberg's  website  (Hald  CLUT  author)  at
       &lt;<b><a href="http://www.quelsolaar.com/technology/clut.html">http://www.quelsolaar.com/technology/clut.html</a></b>&gt;.

       <u>Commands</u>

       This filter supports the "interp" option as <b>commands</b>.

       <u>Workflow</u> <u>examples</u>

       Hald CLUT video stream

       Generate an identity Hald CLUT stream altered with various effects:

               ffmpeg -f lavfi -i B&lt;haldclutsrc&gt;=8 -vf "hue=H=2*PI*t:s=sin(2*PI*t)+1, curves=cross_process" -t 10 -c:v ffv1 clut.nut

       Note: make sure you use a lossless codec.

       Then use it with "haldclut" to apply it on some random stream:

               ffmpeg -f lavfi -i mandelbrot -i clut.nut -filter_complex '[0][1] haldclut' -t 20 mandelclut.mkv

       The  Hald CLUT will be applied to the 10 first seconds (duration of <u>clut.nut</u>), then the latest picture of
       that CLUT stream will be applied to the remaining frames of the "mandelbrot" stream.

       Hald CLUT with preview

       A Hald CLUT is supposed to be a squared image of "Level*Level*Level" by "Level*Level*Level" pixels. For a
       given Hald CLUT, FFmpeg will select the biggest possible square starting at the top left of the  picture.
       The remaining padding pixels (bottom or right) will be ignored. This area can be used to add a preview of
       the Hald CLUT.

       Typically, the following generated Hald CLUT will be supported by the "haldclut" filter:

               ffmpeg -f lavfi -i B&lt;haldclutsrc&gt;=8 -vf "
                  pad=iw+320 [padded_clut];
                  smptebars=s=320x256, split [a][b];
                  [padded_clut][a] overlay=W-320:h, curves=color_negative [main];
                  [main][b] overlay=W-320" -frames:v 1 clut.png

       It  contains  the original and a preview of the effect of the CLUT: SMPTE color bars are displayed on the
       right-top, and below the same color bars processed by the color changes.

       Then, the effect of this Hald CLUT can be visualized with:

               ffplay input.mkv -vf "movie=clut.png, [in] haldclut"

   <b>hflip</b>
       Flip the input video horizontally.

       For example, to horizontally flip the input video with <b>ffmpeg</b>:

               ffmpeg -i in.avi -vf "hflip" out.avi

   <b>histeq</b>
       This filter applies a global color histogram equalization on a per-frame basis.

       It can be used to  correct  video  that  has  a  compressed  range  of  pixel  intensities.   The  filter
       redistributes  the pixel intensities to equalize their distribution across the intensity range. It may be
       viewed as an "automatically adjusting contrast  filter".  This  filter  is  useful  only  for  correcting
       degraded or poorly captured source video.

       The filter accepts the following options:

       <b>strength</b>
           Determine  the amount of equalization to be applied.  As the strength is reduced, the distribution of
           pixel intensities more-and-more approaches that of the input frame. The value must be a float  number
           in the range [0,1] and defaults to 0.200.

       <b>intensity</b>
           Set the maximum intensity that can generated and scale the output values appropriately.  The strength
           should  be  set  as desired and then the intensity can be limited if needed to avoid washing-out. The
           value must be a float number in the range [0,1] and defaults to 0.210.

       <b>antibanding</b>
           Set the antibanding level. If enabled the filter will randomly vary the luminance of output pixels by
           a small amount to avoid banding of the histogram. Possible values are "none", "weak" or "strong".  It
           defaults to "none".

   <b>histogram</b>
       Compute and draw a color distribution histogram for the input video.

       The computed histogram is a representation of the color component distribution in an image.

       Standard histogram displays the color components distribution in an image.  Displays color graph for each
       color  component.  Shows distribution of the Y, U, V, A or R, G, B components, depending on input format,
       in the current frame. Below each graph a color component scale meter is shown.

       The filter accepts the following options:

       <b>level_height</b>
           Set height of level. Default value is 200.  Allowed range is [50, 2048].

       <b>scale_height</b>
           Set height of color scale. Default value is 12.  Allowed range is [0, 40].

       <b>display_mode</b>
           Set display mode.  It accepts the following values:

           <b>stack</b>
               Per color component graphs are placed below each other.

           <b>parade</b>
               Per color component graphs are placed side by side.

           <b>overlay</b>
               Presents information identical to that in the "parade", except that the graphs representing color
               components are superimposed directly over one another.

           Default is "stack".

       <b>levels_mode</b>
           Set mode. Can be either "linear", or "logarithmic".  Default is "linear".

       <b>components</b>
           Set what color components to display.  Default is 7.

       <b>fgopacity</b>
           Set foreground opacity. Default is 0.7.

       <b>bgopacity</b>
           Set background opacity. Default is 0.5.

       <b>colors_mode</b>
           Set colors mode.  It accepts the following values:

           <b>whiteonblack</b>
           <b>blackonwhite</b>
           <b>whiteongray</b>
           <b>blackongray</b>
           <b>coloronblack</b>
           <b>coloronwhite</b>
           <b>colorongray</b>
           <b>blackoncolor</b>
           <b>whiteoncolor</b>
           <b>grayoncolor</b>

           Default is "whiteonblack".

       <u>Examples</u>

       •   Calculate and draw histogram:

                   ffplay -i input -vf histogram

   <b>hqdn3d</b>
       This is a high precision/quality 3d denoise filter. It aims  to  reduce  image  noise,  producing  smooth
       images and making still images really still. It should enhance compressibility.

       It accepts the following optional parameters:

       <b>luma_spatial</b>
           A non-negative floating point number which specifies spatial luma strength.  It defaults to 4.0.

       <b>chroma_spatial</b>
           A  non-negative  floating  point  number  which  specifies  spatial  chroma strength.  It defaults to
           3.0*<u>luma_spatial</u>/4.0.

       <b>luma_tmp</b>
           A floating point number which specifies luma temporal strength. It defaults to 6.0*<u>luma_spatial</u>/4.0.

       <b>chroma_tmp</b>
           A  floating   point   number   which   specifies   chroma   temporal   strength.   It   defaults   to
           <u>luma_tmp</u>*<u>chroma_spatial</u>/<u>luma_spatial</u>.

       <u>Commands</u>

       This  filter supports same <b>commands</b> as options.  The command accepts the same syntax of the corresponding
       option.

       If the specified expression is not valid, it is kept at its current value.

   <b>hwdownload</b>
       Download hardware frames to system memory.

       The input must be in hardware frames, and the output a non-hardware format.   Not  all  formats  will  be
       supported on the output - it may be necessary to insert an additional <b>format</b> filter immediately following
       in the graph to get the output in a supported format.

   <b>hwmap</b>
       Map hardware frames to system memory or to another device.

       This  filter  has several different modes of operation; which one is used depends on the input and output
       formats:

       •   Hardware frame input, normal frame output

           Map the input frames to system memory and pass them to the output.  If the original hardware frame is
           later required (for example, after overlaying something else on part of it), the <b>hwmap</b> filter can  be
           used again in the next mode to retrieve it.

       •   Normal frame input, hardware frame output

           If  the  input  is  actually  a  software-mapped  hardware frame, then unmap it - that is, return the
           original hardware frame.

           Otherwise, a device must be provided.  Create new hardware surfaces on that device  for  the  output,
           then map them back to the software format at the input and give those frames to the preceding filter.
           This  will  then  act  like the <b>hwupload</b> filter, but may be able to avoid an additional copy when the
           input is already in a compatible format.

       •   Hardware frame input and output

           A device must be supplied for the output, either directly or  with  the  <b>derive_device</b>  option.   The
           input  and  output  devices  must be of different types and compatible - the exact meaning of this is
           system-dependent, but typically it means that they must refer to the same underlying hardware context
           (for example, refer to the same graphics card).

           If the input frames were originally created on the output device, then unmap to retrieve the original
           frames.

           Otherwise, map the frames  to  the  output  device  -  create  new  hardware  frames  on  the  output
           corresponding to the frames on the input.

       The following additional parameters are accepted:

       <b>mode</b>
           Set the frame mapping mode.  Some combination of:

           <u>read</u>
               The mapped frame should be readable.

           <u>write</u>
               The mapped frame should be writeable.

           <u>overwrite</u>
               The mapping will always overwrite the entire frame.

               This  may  improve  performance  in some cases, as the original contents of the frame need not be
               loaded.

           <u>direct</u>
               The mapping must not involve any copying.

               Indirect mappings to copies of frames are created in some cases where either  direct  mapping  is
               not  possible or it would have unexpected properties.  Setting this flag ensures that the mapping
               is direct and will fail if that is not possible.

           Defaults to <u>read+write</u> if not specified.

       <b>derive_device</b> <u>type</u>
           Rather than using the device supplied at initialisation, instead derive a new  device  of  type  <u>type</u>
           from the device the input frames exist on.

       <b>reverse</b>
           In  a  hardware  to hardware mapping, map in reverse - create frames in the sink and map them back to
           the source.  This may be necessary in some cases where a mapping in one  direction  is  required  but
           only the opposite direction is supported by the devices being used.

           This  option  is  dangerous  -  it  may break the preceding filter in undefined ways if there are any
           additional constraints on that filter's output.  Do  not  use  it  without  fully  understanding  the
           implications of its use.

   <b>hwupload</b>
       Upload system memory frames to hardware surfaces.

       The  device  to  upload  to must be supplied when the filter is initialised.  If using ffmpeg, select the
       appropriate device with the <b>-filter_hw_device</b> option or with the <b>derive_device</b>  option.   The  input  and
       output devices must be of different types and compatible - the exact meaning of this is system-dependent,
       but  typically  it means that they must refer to the same underlying hardware context (for example, refer
       to the same graphics card).

       The following additional parameters are accepted:

       <b>derive_device</b> <u>type</u>
           Rather than using the device supplied at initialisation, instead derive a new  device  of  type  <u>type</u>
           from the device the input frames exist on.

   <b>hwupload_cuda</b>
       Upload system memory frames to a CUDA device.

       It accepts the following optional parameters:

       <b>device</b>
           The number of the CUDA device to use

   <b>hqx</b>
       Apply  a  high-quality magnification filter designed for pixel art. This filter was originally created by
       Maxim Stepin.

       It accepts the following option:

       <b>n</b>   Set the scaling dimension: 2 for "hq2x", 3 for "hq3x" and 4 for "hq4x".  Default is 3.

   <b>hstack</b>
       Stack input videos horizontally.

       All streams must be of same pixel format and of same height.

       Note that this filter is faster than using <b>overlay</b> and <b>pad</b> filter to create same output.

       The filter accepts the following option:

       <b>inputs</b>
           Set number of input streams. Default is 2.

       <b>shortest</b>
           If set to 1, force the output to terminate when the shortest input terminates. Default value is 0.

   <b>hsvhold</b>
       Turns a certain HSV range into gray values.

       This filter measures color difference between set HSV color in options and ones measured in video stream.
       Depending on options, output colors can be changed to be gray or not.

       The filter accepts the following options:

       <b>hue</b> Set the hue value which will be used in color difference calculation.  Allowed range is from -360  to
           360. Default value is 0.

       <b>sat</b> Set  the  saturation value which will be used in color difference calculation.  Allowed range is from
           -1 to 1. Default value is 0.

       <b>val</b> Set the value which will be used in color difference calculation.  Allowed range is  from  -1  to  1.
           Default value is 0.

       <b>similarity</b>
           Set similarity percentage with the key color.  Allowed range is from 0 to 1. Default value is 0.01.

           0.00001 matches only the exact key color, while 1.0 matches everything.

       <b>blend</b>
           Blend percentage.  Allowed range is from 0 to 1. Default value is 0.

           0.0 makes pixels either fully gray, or not gray at all.

           Higher  values result in more gray pixels, with a higher gray pixel the more similar the pixels color
           is to the key color.

   <b>hsvkey</b>
       Turns a certain HSV range into transparency.

       This filter measures color difference between set HSV color in options and ones measured in video stream.
       Depending on options, output colors can be changed to transparent by adding alpha channel.

       The filter accepts the following options:

       <b>hue</b> Set the hue value which will be used in color difference calculation.  Allowed range is from -360  to
           360. Default value is 0.

       <b>sat</b> Set  the  saturation value which will be used in color difference calculation.  Allowed range is from
           -1 to 1. Default value is 0.

       <b>val</b> Set the value which will be used in color difference calculation.  Allowed range is  from  -1  to  1.
           Default value is 0.

       <b>similarity</b>
           Set similarity percentage with the key color.  Allowed range is from 0 to 1. Default value is 0.01.

           0.00001 matches only the exact key color, while 1.0 matches everything.

       <b>blend</b>
           Blend percentage.  Allowed range is from 0 to 1. Default value is 0.

           0.0 makes pixels either fully transparent, or not transparent at all.

           Higher  values  result  in  semi-transparent  pixels, with a higher transparency the more similar the
           pixels color is to the key color.

   <b>hue</b>
       Modify the hue and/or the saturation of the input.

       It accepts the following parameters:

       <b>h</b>   Specify the hue angle as a number of degrees. It accepts an expression, and defaults to "0".

       <b>s</b>   Specify the saturation in the [-10,10] range. It accepts an expression and defaults to "1".

       <b>H</b>   Specify the hue angle as a number of radians. It accepts an expression, and defaults to "0".

       <b>b</b>   Specify the brightness in the [-10,10] range. It accepts an expression and defaults to "0".

       <b>h</b> and <b>H</b> are mutually exclusive, and can't be specified at the same time.

       The <b>b</b>, <b>h</b>, <b>H</b> and <b>s</b> option values are expressions containing the following constants:

       <b>n</b>   frame count of the input frame starting from 0

       <b>pts</b> presentation timestamp of the input frame expressed in time base units

       <b>r</b>   frame rate of the input video, NAN if the input frame rate is unknown

       <b>t</b>   timestamp expressed in seconds, NAN if the input timestamp is unknown

       <b>tb</b>  time base of the input video

       <u>Examples</u>

       •   Set the hue to 90 degrees and the saturation to 1.0:

                   hue=h=90:s=1

       •   Same command but expressing the hue in radians:

                   hue=H=PI/2:s=1

       •   Rotate hue and make the saturation swing between 0 and 2 over a period of 1 second:

                   hue="H=2*PI*t: s=sin(2*PI*t)+1"

       •   Apply a 3 seconds saturation fade-in effect starting at 0:

                   hue="s=min(t/3\,1)"

           The general fade-in expression can be written as:

                   hue="s=min(0\, max((t-START)/DURATION\, 1))"

       •   Apply a 3 seconds saturation fade-out effect starting at 5 seconds:

                   hue="s=max(0\, min(1\, (8-t)/3))"

           The general fade-out expression can be written as:

                   hue="s=max(0\, min(1\, (START+DURATION-t)/DURATION))"

       <u>Commands</u>

       This filter supports the following commands:

       <b>b</b>
       <b>s</b>
       <b>h</b>
       <b>H</b>   Modify the hue and/or the saturation and/or brightness of the input video.  The command  accepts  the
           same syntax of the corresponding option.

           If the specified expression is not valid, it is kept at its current value.

   <b>huesaturation</b>
       Apply hue-saturation-intensity adjustments to input video stream.

       This filter operates in RGB colorspace.

           0.333.  Those options are used in saturation and lightess processing.

       <b>lightness</b>
           Set  preserving lightness, by default is disabled.  Adjusting hues can change lightness from original
           RGB triplet, with this option enabled lightness is kept at same value.

   <b>hysteresis</b>
       Grow first stream into second stream by connecting components.  This makes  it  possible  to  build  more
       robust edge masks.

       This filter accepts the following options:

       <b>planes</b>
           Set  which  planes  will be processed as bitmap, unprocessed planes will be copied from first stream.
           By default value 0xf, all planes will be processed.

       <b>threshold</b>
           Set threshold which is used in filtering. If pixel component value is higher than this  value  filter
           algorithm for connecting components is activated.  By default value is 0.

       The "hysteresis" filter also supports the <b>framesync</b> options.

   <b>iccdetect</b>
       Detect  the  colorspace   from  an  embedded  ICC  profile  (if  present),  and  update  the frame's tags
       accordingly.

       This filter accepts the following options:

       <b>force</b>
           If true, the frame's existing colorspace tags will always be overridden by values  detected  from  an
           ICC profile. Otherwise, they will only be assigned if they contain "unknown". Enabled by default.

   <b>iccgen</b>
       Generate ICC profiles and attach them to frames.

       This filter accepts the following options:

       <b>color_primaries</b>
       <b>color_trc</b>
           Configure  the  colorspace  that  the  ICC profile will be generated for. The default value of "auto"
           infers the value from the input frame's metadata, defaulting to BT.709/sRGB as appropriate.

           See the <b>setparams</b> filter for a list of possible values, but note that "unknown" are not valid  values
           for this filter.

       <b>force</b>
           If true, an ICC profile will be generated even if it would overwrite an already existing ICC profile.
           Disabled by default.

   <b>identity</b>
       Obtain the identity score between two input videos.

       This filter takes two input videos.

       Both  input videos must have the same resolution and pixel format for this filter to work correctly. Also
       it assumes that both inputs have the same number of frames, which are compared one by one.

       The obtained per component, average, min and max identity score is printed through the logging system.

       The filter stores the calculated identity scores of each frame in frame metadata.

       This filter also supports the <b>framesync</b> options.

       In the below example the input file <u>main.mpg</u> being processed is compared with the reference file <u>ref.mpg</u>.

               ffmpeg -i main.mpg -i ref.mpg -lavfi identity -f null -

   <b>idet</b>
       Detect video interlacing type.

       This filter tries to detect if the input frames are interlaced, progressive, top or bottom  field  first.
       It will also try to detect fields that are repeated between adjacent frames (a sign of telecine).

       Single  frame detection considers only immediately adjacent frames when classifying each frame.  Multiple
       frame detection incorporates the classification history of previous frames.

       The filter will log these metadata values:

       <b>single.current_frame</b>
           Detected type of current frame using single-frame detection.  One  of:  ``tff''  (top  field  first),
           ``bff'' (bottom field first), ``progressive'', or ``undetermined''

       <b>single.tff</b>
           Cumulative number of frames detected as top field first using single-frame detection.

       <b>multiple.tff</b>
           Cumulative number of frames detected as top field first using multiple-frame detection.

       <b>single.bff</b>
           Cumulative number of frames detected as bottom field first using single-frame detection.

       <b>multiple.current_frame</b>
           Detected  type  of  current  frame using multiple-frame detection. One of: ``tff'' (top field first),
           ``bff'' (bottom field first), ``progressive'', or ``undetermined''

       <b>multiple.bff</b>
           Cumulative number of frames detected as bottom field first using multiple-frame detection.

       <b>single.progressive</b>
           Cumulative number of frames detected as progressive using single-frame detection.

       <b>multiple.progressive</b>
           Cumulative number of frames detected as progressive using multiple-frame detection.

       <b>single.undetermined</b>
           Cumulative number of frames that could not be classified using single-frame detection.

       <b>multiple.undetermined</b>
           Cumulative number of frames that could not be classified using multiple-frame detection.

       <b>repeated.current_frame</b>
           Which field in the current frame  is  repeated  from  the  last.  One  of  ``neither'',  ``top'',  or
           ``bottom''.

       <b>repeated.neither</b>
           Cumulative number of frames with no repeated field.

       <b>repeated.top</b>
           Cumulative number of frames with the top field repeated from the previous frame's top field.

       <b>repeated.bottom</b>
           Cumulative number of frames with the bottom field repeated from the previous frame's bottom field.

       The filter accepts the following options:

       <b>intl_thres</b>
           Set interlacing threshold.

       <b>prog_thres</b>
           Set progressive threshold.

       <b>rep_thres</b>
           Threshold for repeated field detection.

       <b>half_life</b>
           Number  of  frames  after  which  a  given frame's contribution to the statistics is halved (i.e., it
           contributes only 0.5 to its classification). The default of 0 means that all frames  seen  are  given
           full weight of 1.0 forever.

       <b>analyze_interlaced_flag</b>
           When  this  is not 0 then idet will use the specified number of frames to determine if the interlaced
           flag is accurate, it will not count undetermined frames.  If the flag is found to be accurate it will
           be used without any further computations, if it is found to be inaccurate it will be cleared  without
           any  further  computations.  This  allows  inserting the idet filter as a low computational method to
           clean up the interlaced flag

       <u>Examples</u>

       Inspect the field order of the first 360 frames in a video, in verbose detail:

               ffmpeg -i INPUT -filter:v idet,metadata=mode=print -frames:v 360 -an -f null -

       The idet filter will add analysis metadata to each frame, which will then be discarded. At the  end,  the
       filter will also print a final report with statistics.

   <b>il</b>
       Deinterleave or interleave fields.

       This  filter  allows  one  to process interlaced images fields without deinterlacing them. Deinterleaving
       splits the input frame into 2 fields (so called half pictures). Odd lines are moved to the  top  half  of
       the  output  image,  even lines to the bottom half.  You can process (filter) them independently and then
       re-interleave them.

       The filter accepts the following options:

       <b>luma_mode,</b> <b>l</b>
       <b>chroma_mode,</b> <b>c</b>
       <b>alpha_mode,</b> <b>a</b>
           Available values for <u>luma_mode</u>, <u>chroma_mode</u> and <u>alpha_mode</u> are:

           <b>none</b>
               Do nothing.

           <b>deinterleave,</b> <b>d</b>
               Deinterleave fields, placing one above the other.

           <b>interleave,</b> <b>i</b>
               Interleave fields. Reverse the effect of deinterleaving.

           Default value is "none".

       <b>luma_swap,</b> <b>ls</b>
       <b>chroma_swap,</b> <b>cs</b>
       <b>alpha_swap,</b> <b>as</b>
           Swap luma/chroma/alpha fields. Exchange even &amp; odd lines. Default value is 0.

       <u>Commands</u>

       This filter supports the all above options as <b>commands</b>.

   <b>inflate</b>
       Apply inflate effect to the video.

       This filter replaces the pixel by the <a href="../man3x3/local.3x3.html">local</a>(3x3) average by taking into account only values  higher  than
       the pixel.

       It accepts the following options:

       <b>threshold0</b>
       <b>threshold1</b>
       <b>threshold2</b>
       <b>threshold3</b>
           Limit the maximum change for each plane, default is 65535.  If 0, plane will remain unchanged.

       <u>Commands</u>

       This filter supports the all above options as <b>commands</b>.

   <b>interlace</b>
       Simple  interlacing  filter  from  progressive contents. This interleaves upper (or lower) lines from odd
       frames with lower (or upper) lines from even frames, halving the frame rate and preserving image height.

                  Original        Original             New Frame
                  Frame 'j'      Frame 'j+1'             (tff)

       It accepts the following optional parameters:

       <b>scan</b>
           This determines whether the interlaced frame is taken from the even (tff  -  default)  or  odd  (bff)
           lines of the progressive frame.

       <b>lowpass</b>
           Vertical lowpass filter to avoid twitter interlacing and reduce moire patterns.

               Enable linear filter (default)

           <b>2,</b> <b>complex</b>
               Enable  complex filter. This will slightly less reduce twitter and moire but better retain detail
               and subjective sharpness impression.

   <b>kerndeint</b>
       Deinterlace input video by applying Donald Graft's adaptive kernel deinterling. Work on interlaced  parts
       of a video to produce progressive frames.

       The description of the accepted parameters follows.

       <b>thresh</b>
           Set  the  threshold  which  affects  the  filter's tolerance when determining if a pixel line must be
           processed. It must be an integer in the range [0,255] and defaults to 10. A value of 0 will result in
           applying the process on every pixels.

       <b>map</b> Paint pixels exceeding the threshold value to white if set to 1.  Default is 0.

       <b>order</b>
           Set the fields order. Swap fields if set to 1, leave fields alone if 0. Default is 0.

                   kerndeint=sharp=1

       •   Paint processed pixels in white:

                   kerndeint=map=1

   <b>kirsch</b>
       Apply kirsch operator to input video stream.

       The filter accepts the following option:

       <b>planes</b>
           Set which planes will be processed, unprocessed planes will be copied.  By  default  value  0xf,  all
           planes will be processed.

       <b>scale</b>
           Set value which will be multiplied with filtered result.

       <b>delta</b>
           Set value which will be added to filtered result.

       <u>Commands</u>

       This filter supports the all above options as <b>commands</b>.

   <b>lagfun</b>
       Slowly update darker pixels.

       This filter makes short flashes of light appear longer.  This filter accepts the following options:

       <b>decay</b>

       <b>planes</b>
           Set which planes to filter. Default is all. Allowed range is from 0 to 15.

       <u>Commands</u>

       This filter supports the all above options as <b>commands</b>.

   <b>lenscorrection</b>
       Correct radial lens distortion

       This filter can be used to correct for radial distortion as can result from the use of wide angle lenses,
       and thereby re-rectify the image. To find the right parameters one can use tools available for example as
       part  of  opencv or simply trial-and-error.  To use opencv use the calibration sample (under samples/cpp)
       from the opencv sources and extract the k1 and k2 coefficients from the resulting matrix.

       Note that effectively the same filter is available in the open-source tools Krita and  Digikam  from  the
       KDE project.

       In  contrast  to  the  <b>vignette</b>  filter,  which  can  also be used to compensate lens errors, this filter
       corrects the distortion of the image, whereas <b>vignette</b> corrects the brightness distribution, so  you  may
       want  to  use both filters together in certain cases, though you will have to take care of ordering, i.e.
       whether vignetting should be applied before or after lens correction.

       <u>Options</u>

       The filter accepts the following options:

       <b>cx</b>  Relative x-coordinate of the focal point of the image, and thereby the center of the distortion. This
           value has a range [0,1] and is expressed as fractions of the image width. Default is 0.5.

       <b>cy</b>  Relative y-coordinate of the focal point of the image, and thereby the center of the distortion. This
           value has a range [0,1] and is expressed as fractions of the image height. Default is 0.5.

       <b>k1</b>  Coefficient of the quadratic correction term. This value has a range [-1,1]. 0 means  no  correction.
           Default is 0.

       <b>k2</b>  Coefficient  of  the  double  quadratic  correction  term. This value has a range [-1,1].  0 means no
           correction. Default is 0.

       <b>i</b>   Set interpolation type. Can be "nearest" or "bilinear".  Default is "nearest".

       <b>fc</b>  Specify the color of the unmapped pixels. For the syntax of this option, check the <b>"Color"</b> <b>section</b> <b>in</b>
           <b>the</b> <b>ffmpeg-utils</b> <b>manual</b>. Default color is "black@0".

       The formula that generates the correction is:

       <u>r_src</u> = <u>r_tgt</u> * (1 + <u>k1</u> * (<u>r_tgt</u> / <u>r_0</u>)^2 + <u>k2</u> * (<u>r_tgt</u> / <u>r_0</u>)^4)

       where <u>r_0</u> is halve of the image diagonal and <u>r_src</u> and <u>r_tgt</u> are the distances from the  focal  point  in
       the source and target images, respectively.

       <u>Commands</u>

       This filter supports the all above options as <b>commands</b>.

   <b>lensfun</b>
       Apply lens correction via the lensfun library (&lt;<b><a href="http://lensfun.sourceforge.net/">http://lensfun.sourceforge.net/</a></b>&gt;).

       The "lensfun" filter requires the camera make, camera model, and lens model to apply the lens correction.
       The  filter will load the lensfun database and query it to find the corresponding camera and lens entries
       in the database. As long as these entries can be found with the given options,  the  filter  can  perform
       corrections  on  frames.  Note  that incomplete strings will result in the filter choosing the best match
       with the given options, and the filter will output the chosen camera and lens models (logged  with  level
       "info"). You must provide the make, camera model, and lens model as they are required.

       To  obtain a list of available makes and models, leave out one or both of "make" and "model" options. The
       filter will send the full list to the log with level "INFO".  The first column is the make and the second
       column is the model.  To obtain a list of available lenses, set any values for make and model  and  leave
       out  the  "lens_model" option. The filter will send the full list of lenses in the log with level "INFO".
       The ffmpeg tool will exit after the list is printed.

       The filter accepts the following options:

       <b>make</b>
           The make of the camera (for example, "Canon"). This option is required.

       <b>model</b>
           The model of the camera (for example, "Canon EOS 100D"). This option is required.

       <b>lens_model</b>
           The model of the lens (for example, "Canon EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS STM"). This option is required.

       <b>db_path</b>
           The full path to the lens database folder. If not set, the filter will attempt to load  the  database
           from the install path when the library was built. Default is unset.

       <b>mode</b>
           The type of correction to apply. The following values are valid options:

           <b>vignetting</b>
               Enables fixing lens vignetting.

           <b>geometry</b>
               Enables fixing lens geometry. This is the default.

           <b>subpixel</b>
               Enables fixing chromatic aberrations.

           <b>vig_geo</b>
               Enables fixing lens vignetting and lens geometry.

           <b>vig_subpixel</b>
               Enables fixing lens vignetting and chromatic aberrations.

           <b>distortion</b>
               Enables fixing both lens geometry and chromatic aberrations.

           <b>all</b> Enables all possible corrections.

       <b>focal_length</b>
           The focal length of the image/video (zoom; expected constant for video). For example, a 18--55mm lens
           has  focal  length range of [18--55], so a value in that range should be chosen when using that lens.
           Default 18.

       <b>aperture</b>
           The aperture of the image/video (expected constant for video). Note that aperture is  only  used  for
           vignetting correction. Default 3.5.

       <b>focus_distance</b>
           The focus distance of the image/video (expected constant for video). Note that focus distance is only
           used for vignetting and only slightly affects the vignetting correction process. If unknown, leave it
           at the default value (which is 1000).

       <b>scale</b>
           The  scale  factor  which  is  applied  after transformation. After correction the video is no longer
           necessarily rectangular. This parameter controls how much of the  resulting  image  is  visible.  The
           value 0 means that a value will be chosen automatically such that there is little or no unmapped area
           in the output image. 1.0 means that no additional scaling is done. Lower values may result in more of
           the corrected image being visible, while higher values may avoid unmapped areas in the output.

       <b>target_geometry</b>
           The target geometry of the output image/video. The following values are valid options:

           <b>rectilinear</b> <b>(default)</b>
           <b>fisheye</b>
           <b>panoramic</b>
           <b>equirectangular</b>
           <b>fisheye_orthographic</b>
           <b>fisheye_stereographic</b>
           <b>fisheye_equisolid</b>
           <b>fisheye_thoby</b>
       <b>reverse</b>
           Apply the reverse of image correction (instead of correcting distortion, apply it).

       <b>interpolation</b>
           The type of interpolation used when correcting distortion. The following values are valid options:

           <b>nearest</b>
           <b>linear</b> <b>(default)</b>
           <b>lanczos</b>

       <u>Examples</u>

       •   Apply  lens  correction  with make "Canon", camera model "Canon EOS 100D", and lens model "Canon EF-S
           18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS STM" with focal length of "18" and aperture of "8.0".

                   ffmpeg -i input.mov -vf lensfun=make=Canon:model="Canon EOS 100D":lens_model="Canon EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS STM":focal_length=18:aperture=8 -c:v h264 -b:v 8000k output.mov

   <b>libplacebo</b>
       Flexible        GPU-accelerated        processing        filter        based        on         libplacebo
       (&lt;<b>https://code.videolan.org/videolan/libplacebo</b>&gt;).

       <u>Options</u>

       The options for this filter are divided into the following sections:

       Output mode

       These  options  control  the  overall output mode. By default, libplacebo will try to preserve the source
       colorimetry and size as best as it can, but it will apply any embedded film grain, dolby vision  metadata
       or anamorphic SAR present in source frames.

       <b>inputs</b>
           Set  the  number of inputs. This can be used, alongside the "idx" variable, to allow placing/blending
           multiple inputs inside the output frame. This effectively enables functionality  similar  to  <b>hstack</b>,
           <b>overlay</b>, etc.

       <b>w</b>
       <b>h</b>   Set the output video dimension expression. Default values are "iw" and "ih".

           Allows for the same expressions as the <b>scale</b> filter.

       <b>crop_x</b>
       <b>crop_y</b>
           Set the input crop x/y expressions, default values are "(iw-cw)/2" and "(ih-ch)/2".

       <b>crop_w</b>
       <b>crop_h</b>
           Set the input crop width/height expressions, default values are "iw" and "ih".

       <b>pos_x</b>
       <b>pos_y</b>
           Set the output placement x/y expressions, default values are "(ow-pw)/2" and "(oh-ph)/2".

       <b>pos_w</b>
       <b>pos_h</b>
           Set the output placement width/height expressions, default values are "ow" and "oh".

       <b>fps</b> Set  the  output  frame  rate.  This can be rational, e.g. "60000/1001". If set to the special string
           "none" (the default), input timestamps will instead be  passed  through  to  the  output  unmodified.
           Otherwise,  the  input  video  frames  will  be interpolated as necessary to rescale the video to the
           specified target framerate, in a manner as determined by the <b>frame_mixer</b> option.

       <b>format</b>
           Set the output format override. If unset (the default), frames will be output in the same  format  as
           the respective input frames. Otherwise, format conversion will be performed.

       <b>force_original_aspect_ratio</b>
       <b>force_divisible_by</b>
           Work the same as the identical <b>scale</b> filter options.

       <b>normalize_sar</b>
           If  enabled,  output  frames  will  always  have  a  pixel  aspect  ratio of 1:1. This will introduce
           additional padding/cropping as necessary. If disabled (the default),  any  aspect  ratio  mismatches,
           including those from e.g. anamorphic video sources, are forwarded to the output pixel aspect ratio.

       <b>pad_crop_ratio</b>
           Specifies a ratio (between 0.0 and 1.0) between padding and cropping when the input aspect ratio does
           not  match the output aspect ratio and <b>normalize_sar</b> is in effect. The default of 0.0 always pads the
           content with black borders, while a value of 1.0 always crops off parts of the content.  Intermediate
           values are possible, leading to a mix of the two approaches.

       <b>fillcolor</b>
           Set  the  color used to fill the output area not covered by the output image, for example as a result
           of <b>normalize_sar</b>. For the general syntax of this option, check the <b>"Color"</b>  <b>section</b>  <b>in</b>  <b>the</b>  <b>ffmpeg-</b>
           <b>utils</b> <b>manual</b>. Defaults to "black".

       <b>corner_rounding</b>
           Render  frames  with  rounded corners. The value, given as a float ranging from 0.0 to 1.0, indicates
           the relative degree of rounding, from fully square to fully circular. In other words,  it  gives  the
           radius divided by half the smaller side length. Defaults to 0.0.

       <b>extra_opts</b>
           Pass  extra  libplacebo internal configuration options. These can be specified as a list of <u>key</u>=<u>value</u>
           pairs separated by ':'. The following example shows how to configure a  custom  filter  kernel  ("EWA
           LanczosSharp") and use it to double the input image resolution:

                   -vf "libplacebo=w=iw*2:h=ih*2:extra_opts='upscaler=custom\:upscaler_preset=ewa_lanczos\:upscaler_blur=0.9812505644269356'"

       <b>colorspace</b>
       <b>color_primaries</b>
       <b>color_trc</b>
       <b>range</b>
           Configure the colorspace that output frames will be delivered in. The default value of "auto" outputs
           frames  in the same format as the input frames, leading to no change. For any other value, conversion
           will be performed.

           See the <b>setparams</b> filter for a list of possible values.

       <b>apply_filmgrain</b>
           Apply film grain (e.g. AV1 or H.274) if present in source frames,  and  strip  it  from  the  output.
           Enabled by default.

       <b>apply_dolbyvision</b>
           Apply Dolby Vision RPU metadata if present in source frames, and strip it from the output. Enabled by
           default.  Note  that  Dolby  Vision  will  always output BT.2020+PQ, overriding the usual input frame
           metadata. These will also be picked as the values of "auto" for the respective frame output options.

       In addition to the expression constants documented for the <b>scale</b>  filter,  the  <b>crop_w</b>,  <b>crop_h</b>,  <b>crop_x</b>,
       <b>crop_y</b>, <b>pos_w</b>, <b>pos_h</b>, <b>pos_x</b> and <b>pos_y</b> options can also contain the following constants:

       <b>in_idx,</b> <b>idx</b>
           The (0-based) numeric index of the currently active input stream.

       <b>crop_w,</b> <b>cw</b>
       <b>crop_h,</b> <b>ch</b>
           The computed values of <b>crop_w</b> and <b>crop_h</b>.

       <b>pos_w,</b> <b>pw</b>
       <b>pos_h,</b> <b>ph</b>
           The computed values of <b>pos_w</b> and <b>pos_h</b>.

       <b>in_t,</b> <b>t</b>
           The input frame timestamp, in seconds. NAN if input timestamp is unknown.

       <b>out_t,</b> <b>ot</b>
           The input frame timestamp, in seconds. NAN if input timestamp is unknown.

       <b>n</b>   The input frame number, starting with 0.

       Scaling

       The  options  in  this  section control how libplacebo performs upscaling and (if necessary) downscaling.
       Note that libplacebo will always internally operate on 4:4:4 content, so any sub-sampled  chroma  formats
       such  as  "yuv420p"  will necessarily be upsampled and downsampled as part of the rendering process. That
       means scaling might be in effect even if the source and destination resolution are the same.

       <b>upscaler</b>
       <b>downscaler</b>
           Configure the filter  kernel  used  for  upscaling  and  downscaling.  The  respective  defaults  are
           "spline36" and "mitchell". For a full list of possible values, pass "help" to these options. The most
           important values are:

           <b>none</b>
               Forces  the  use  of  built-in GPU texture sampling (typically bilinear). Extremely fast but poor
               quality, especially when downscaling.

           <b>bilinear</b>
               Bilinear interpolation. Can generally be done for free on GPUs, except when doing so  would  lead
               to aliasing. Fast and low quality.

           <b>nearest</b>
               Nearest-neighbour interpolation. Sharp but highly aliasing.

           <b>oversample</b>
               Algorithm  that  looks  visually similar to nearest-neighbour interpolation but tries to preserve
               pixel aspect ratio. Good for pixel art, since it results in minimal distortion  of  the  artistic
               appearance.

           <b>lanczos</b>
               Standard sinc-sinc interpolation kernel.

           <b>spline36</b>
               Cubic  spline  approximation of lanczos. No difference in performance, but has very slightly less
               ringing.

           <b>ewa_lanczos</b>
               Elliptically weighted average version of lanczos, based on a  jinc-sinc  kernel.   This  is  also
               popularly referred to as just "Jinc scaling". Slow but very high quality.

           <b>gaussian</b>
               Gaussian kernel. Has certain ideal mathematical properties, but subjectively very blurry.

           <b>mitchell</b>
               Cubic BC spline with parameters recommended by Mitchell and Netravali. Very little ringing.

       <b>frame_mixer</b>
           Controls  the  kernel  used for mixing frames temporally. The default value is "none", which disables
           frame mixing. For a full list of possible values, pass "help" to  this  option.  The  most  important
           values are:

           <b>none</b>
               Disables frame mixing, giving a result equivalent to "nearest neighbour" semantics.

           <b>oversample</b>
               Oversamples  the  input  video  to create a "Smooth Motion"-type effect: if an output frame would
               exactly fall on the transition between two video frames, it is blended according to the  relative
               overlap. This is the recommended option whenever preserving the original subjective appearance is
               desired.

           <b>mitchell_clamp</b>
               Larger filter kernel that smoothly interpolates multiple frames in a manner designed to eliminate
               ringing  and other artefacts as much as possible. This is the recommended option wherever maximum
               visual smoothness is desired.

           <b>linear</b>
               Linear blend/fade between frames. Especially useful for constructing e.g.  slideshows.

       <b>lut_entries</b>
           Configures the size of scaler LUTs, ranging from 1 to 256. The default of 0  will  pick  libplacebo's
           internal default, typically 64.

       <b>antiringing</b>
           Enables  anti-ringing  (for non-EWA filters). The value (between 0.0 and 1.0) configures the strength
           of the anti-ringing algorithm. May increase aliasing if set too high. Disabled by default.

       <b>sigmoid</b>
           Enable sigmoidal compression during upscaling. Reduces ringing slightly.  Enabled by default.

       Debanding

       Libplacebo comes with a built-in debanding filter that is good at counteracting many  common  sources  of
       banding and blocking. Turning this on is highly recommended whenever quality is desired.

       <b>deband</b>
           Enable (fast) debanding algorithm. Disabled by default.

       <b>deband_iterations</b>
           Number   of  deband  iterations  of  the  debanding  algorithm.  Each  iteration  is  performed  with
           progressively increased radius (and diminished threshold).  Recommended values are in the range 1  to
           4. Defaults to 1.

       <b>deband_threshold</b>
           Debanding filter strength. Higher numbers lead to more aggressive debanding.  Defaults to 4.0.

       <b>deband_radius</b>
           Debanding filter radius. A higher radius is better for slow gradients, while a lower radius is better
           for steep gradients. Defaults to 16.0.

       <b>deband_grain</b>
           Amount of extra output grain to add. Helps hide imperfections. Defaults to 6.0.

       Color adjustment

       A  collection  of  subjective  color  controls. Not very rigorous, so the exact effect will vary somewhat
       depending on the input primaries and colorspace.

       <b>brightness</b>
           Brightness boost, between -1.0 and 1.0. Defaults to 0.0.

       <b>contrast</b>
           Contrast gain, between 0.0 and 16.0. Defaults to 1.0.

       <b>saturation</b>
           Saturation gain, between 0.0 and 16.0. Defaults to 1.0.

       <b>hue</b> Hue shift in radians, between -3.14 and 3.14. Defaults to 0.0. This will  rotate  the  UV  subvector,
           defaulting to BT.709 coefficients for RGB inputs.

       <b>gamma</b>
           Gamma adjustment, between 0.0 and 16.0. Defaults to 1.0.

       <b>cones</b>
           Cone  model  to use for color blindness simulation. Accepts any combination of "l", "m" and "s". Here
           are some examples:

           <b>m</b>   Deuteranomaly / deuteranopia (affecting 3%-4% of the population)

           <b>l</b>   Protanomaly / protanopia (affecting 1%-2% of the population)

           <b>l+m</b> Monochromacy (very rare)

           <b>l+m+s</b>
               Achromatopsy (complete loss of daytime vision, extremely rare)

       <b>cone-strength</b>
           Gain factor for the cones specified by "cones", between 0.0 and 10.0. A value of 1.0  results  in  no
           change  to  color vision. A value of 0.0 (the default) simulates complete loss of those cones. Values
           above 1.0 result in exaggerating the differences between cones, which may help compensate for reduced
           color vision.

       Peak detection

       To help deal with sources that only have static HDR10 metadata (or  no  tagging  whatsoever),  libplacebo
       uses  its  own internal frame analysis compute shader to analyze source frames and adapt the tone mapping
       function in realtime. If this is too slow, or if exactly reproducible frame-perfect results  are  needed,
       it's recommended to turn this feature off.

       <b>peak_detect</b>
           Enable  HDR  peak  detection. Ignores static MaxCLL/MaxFALL values in favor of dynamic detection from
           the input. Note that the detected values do not get written back to the output  frames,  they  merely
           guide the internal tone mapping process. Enabled by default.

       <b>smoothing_period</b>
           Peak  detection  smoothing  period,  between  0.0  and 1000.0. Higher values result in peak detection
           becoming less responsive to changes in the input. Defaults to 100.0.

       <b>minimum_peak</b>
           Lower bound on the detected peak (relative to SDR white), between 0.0 and 100.0. Defaults to 1.0.

       <b>scene_threshold_low</b>
       <b>scene_threshold_high</b>
           Lower and upper thresholds for scene change detection. Expressed in a logarithmic scale  between  0.0
           and  100.0.  Default  to 5.5 and 10.0, respectively. Setting either to a negative value disables this
           functionality.

       <b>percentile</b>
           Which percentile of the frame brightness histogram to  use  as  the  source  peak  for  tone-mapping.
           Defaults  to  99.995,  a  fairly  conservative value.  Setting this to 100.0 disables frame histogram
           measurement and instead uses the true peak brightness for tone-mapping.

       Tone mapping

       The options in this section control how libplacebo performs tone-mapping and gamut-mapping  when  dealing
       with  mismatches  between  wide-gamut  or  HDR content.  In general, libplacebo relies on accurate source
       tagging and mastering display gamut information to produce the best results.

       <b>gamut_mode</b>
           How to handle out-of-gamut colors that can occur as a result of colorimetric gamut mapping.

           <b>clip</b>
               Do nothing, simply clip out-of-range colors to the RGB volume. Low quality but extremely fast.

           <b>perceptual</b>
               Perceptually soft-clip colors to the gamut volume. This is the default.

           <b>relative</b>
               Relative colorimetric hard-clip. Similar to "perceptual" but without the soft knee.

           <b>saturation</b>
               Saturation mapping, maps primaries directly to primaries in RGB space.   Not  recommended  except
               for artificial computer graphics for which a bright, saturated display is desired.

           <b>absolute</b>
               Absolute colorimetric hard-clip. Performs no adjustment of the white point.

           <b>desaturate</b>
               Hard-desaturates  out-of-gamut  colors  towards  white,  while  preserving  the  luminance. Has a
               tendency to distort the visual appearance of bright objects.

           <b>darken</b>
               Linearly reduces content brightness to preserves saturated  details,  followed  by  clipping  the
               remaining out-of-gamut colors.

           <b>warn</b>
               Highlight out-of-gamut pixels (by inverting/marking them).

           <b>linear</b>
               Linearly  reduces chromaticity of the entire image to make it fit within the target color volume.
               Be careful when using this on BT.2020 sources without proper mastering metadata, as doing so will
               lead to excessive desaturation.

       <b>tonemapping</b>
           Tone-mapping algorithm to use. Available values are:

           <b>auto</b>
               Automatic selection based on internal heuristics. This is the default.

           <b>clip</b>
               Performs no tone-mapping, just clips out-of-range colors. Retains perfect color accuracy for  in-
               range  colors but completely destroys out-of-range information.  Does not perform any black point
               adaptation. Not configurable.

           <b>st2094-40</b>
               EETF from SMPTE ST 2094-40 Annex B, which applies the Bezier curves from HDR10+ dynamic  metadata
               based  on  Bezier  curves  to  perform tone-mapping. The OOTF used is adjusted based on the ratio
               between the targeted and actual display peak luminances.

           <b>st2094-10</b>
               EETF from SMPTE ST 2094-10 Annex B.2, which takes into account the input signal average luminance
               in addition to the maximum/minimum. The configurable contrast parameter influences the  slope  of
               the linear output segment, defaulting to 1.0 for no increase/decrease in contrast. Note that this
               does not currently include the subjective gain/offset/gamma controls defined in Annex B.3.

           <b>bt.2390</b>
               EETF from the ITU-R Report BT.2390, a hermite spline roll-off with linear segment. The knee point
               offset  is  configurable.  Note that this parameter defaults to 1.0, rather than the value of 0.5
               from the ITU-R spec.

           <b>bt.2446a</b>
               EETF from ITU-R Report BT.2446, method A. Designed for well-mastered HDR sources. Can be used for
               both forward and inverse tone mapping. Not configurable.

           <b>spline</b>
               Simple spline consisting of two polynomials, joined by a single pivot point.  The parameter gives
               the pivot point (in PQ space), defaulting to 0.30.  Can be used for both forward and inverse tone
               mapping.

           <b>reinhard</b>
               Simple non-linear, global tone mapping algorithm. The  parameter  specifies  the  local  contrast
               coefficient at the display peak. Essentially, a parameter of 0.5 implies that the reference white
               will  be  about  half  as bright as when clipping. Defaults to 0.5, which results in the simplest
               formulation of this function.

           <b>mobius</b>
               Generalization of the reinhard tone mapping algorithm to support an additional linear slope  near
               black. The tone mapping parameter indicates the trade-off between the linear section and the non-
               linear  section.  Essentially,  for a given parameter <u>x</u>, every color value below <u>x</u> will be mapped
               linearly, while higher values get non-linearly tone-mapped.  Values  near  1.0  make  this  curve
               behave  like  "clip",  while  values near 0.0 make this curve behave like "reinhard". The default
               value is 0.3, which provides a good balance between colorimetric accuracy and preserving  out-of-
               gamut details.

           <b>hable</b>
               Piece-wise,  filmic  tone-mapping  algorithm  developed  by  John  Hable  for use in Uncharted 2,
               inspired by a similar tone-mapping algorithm used by Kodak.  Popularized  by  its  use  in  video
               games  with  HDR  rendering. Preserves both dark and bright details very well, but comes with the
               drawback of changing the average brightness quite significantly.  This  is  sort  of  similar  to
               "reinhard" with parameter 0.24.

           <b>gamma</b>
               Fits a gamma (power) function to transfer between the source and target color spaces, effectively
               resulting  in  a perceptual hard-knee joining two roughly linear sections. This preserves details
               at all scales fairly accurately, but can result in an image with a muted or dull appearance.  The
               parameter is used as the cutoff point, defaulting to 0.5.

           <b>linear</b>
               Linearly  stretches  the  input  range  to  the output range, in PQ space. This will preserve all
               details accurately, but results in a significantly different average brightness. Can be used  for
               inverse  tone-mapping  in  addition  to  regular  tone-mapping.  The  parameter can be used as an
               additional linear gain coefficient (defaulting to 1.0).

       <b>tonemapping_param</b>
           For tunable tone mapping functions, this parameter can be used to fine-tune the curve behavior. Refer
           to the documentation of "tonemapping". The default value of 0.0 is replaced by the curve's  preferred
           default setting.

       <b>inverse_tonemapping</b>
           If  enabled,  this  filter will also attempt stretching SDR signals to fill HDR output color volumes.
           Disabled by default.

       <b>tonemapping_lut_size</b>
           Size of the tone-mapping LUT, between 2 and 1024. Defaults to 256. Note that this figure  is  squared
           when combined with "peak_detect".

       <b>contrast_recovery</b>
           Contrast  recovery strength. If set to a value above 0.0, the source image will be divided into high-
           frequency and low-frequency components, and a portion of the high-frequency image is added back  onto
           the  tone-mapped output.  May cause excessive ringing artifacts for some HDR sources, but can improve
           the subjective sharpness and detail left over in the image after tone-mapping.  Defaults to 0.30.

       <b>contrast_smoothness</b>
           Contrast recovery lowpass kernel size. Defaults to 3.5. Increasing or decreasing this will affect the
           visual appearance substantially. Has no effect when "contrast_recovery" is disabled.

       Dithering

       By default, libplacebo will dither whenever necessary, which includes rendering  to  any  integer  format
       below  16-bit  precision.  It's  recommended  to  always  leave this on, since not doing so may result in
       visible banding in the output, even if the "debanding" filter  is  enabled.  If  maximum  performance  is
       needed, use "ordered_fixed" instead of disabling dithering.

       <b>dithering</b>
           Dithering method to use. Accepts the following values:

           <b>none</b>
               Disables dithering completely. May result in visible banding.

           <b>blue</b>
               Dither with pseudo-blue noise. This is the default.

           <b>ordered</b>
               Tunable ordered dither pattern.

           <b>ordered_fixed</b>
               Faster ordered dither with a fixed size of 6. Texture-less.

           <b>white</b>
               Dither with white noise. Texture-less.

       <b>dither_lut_size</b>
           Dither LUT size, as log base2 between 1 and 8. Defaults to 6, corresponding to a LUT size of "64x64".

       <b>dither_temporal</b>
           Enables temporal dithering. Disabled by default.

       Custom shaders

       libplacebo  supports  a number of custom shaders based on the mpv .hook GLSL syntax. A collection of such
       shaders can be found here: &lt;<b>https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/wiki/User-Scripts#user-shaders</b>&gt;

       A full description of the mpv shader format is beyond the scope of this section, but  a  summary  can  be
       found here: &lt;<b>https://mpv.io/manual/master/#options-glsl-shader</b>&gt;

       <b>custom_shader_path</b>
           Specifies a path to a custom shader file to load at runtime.

       <b>custom_shader_bin</b>
           Specifies a complete custom shader as a raw string.

       Debugging / performance

       All  of the options in this section default off. They may be of assistance when attempting to squeeze the
       maximum performance at the cost of quality.

       <b>skip_aa</b>
           Disable anti-aliasing when downscaling.

       <b>polar_cutoff</b>
           Truncate polar (EWA) scaler kernels below this absolute magnitude, between 0.0 and 1.0.

       <b>disable_linear</b>
           Disable linear light scaling.

       <b>disable_builtin</b>
           Disable built-in GPU sampling (forces LUT).

       <b>disable_fbos</b>
           Forcibly disable FBOs, resulting in loss of  almost  all  functionality,  but  offering  the  maximum
           possible speed.

       <u>Commands</u>

       This filter supports almost all of the above options as <b>commands</b>.

       <u>Examples</u>

       •   Tone-map input to standard gamut BT.709 output:

                   libplacebo=colorspace=bt709:color_primaries=bt709:color_trc=bt709:range=tv

       •   Rescale input to fit into standard 1080p, with high quality scaling:

                   libplacebo=w=1920:h=1080:force_original_aspect_ratio=decrease:normalize_sar=true:upscaler=ewa_lanczos:downscaler=ewa_lanczos

       •   Interpolate low FPS / VFR input to smoothed constant 60 fps output:

                   libplacebo=fps=60:frame_mixer=mitchell_clamp

       •   Convert input to standard sRGB JPEG:

                   libplacebo=format=yuv420p:colorspace=bt470bg:color_primaries=bt709:color_trc=iec61966-2-1:range=pc

       •   Use higher quality debanding settings:

                   libplacebo=deband=true:deband_iterations=3:deband_radius=8:deband_threshold=6

       •   Run  this  filter  on  the  CPU,  on systems with Mesa installed (and with the most expensive options
           disabled):

                   ffmpeg ... -init_hw_device vulkan:llvmpipe ... -vf libplacebo=upscaler=none:downscaler=none:peak_detect=false

       •   Suppress CPU-based AV1/H.274 film grain application in the decoder, in favor of doing  it  with  this
           filter. Note that this is only a gain if the frames are either already on the GPU, or if you're using
           libplacebo  for other purposes, since otherwise the VRAM roundtrip will more than offset any expected
           speedup.

                   ffmpeg -export_side_data +film_grain ... -vf libplacebo=apply_filmgrain=true

       •   Interop with VAAPI hwdec to avoid round-tripping through RAM:

                   ffmpeg -init_hw_device vulkan -hwaccel vaapi -hwaccel_output_format vaapi ... -vf libplacebo

   <b>libvmaf</b>

   <b>limitdiff</b>
       Apply limited difference filter using second and optionally third video stream.

       The filter accepts the following options:

       <b>threshold</b>
           Set the threshold to use when allowing certain  differences  between  video  streams.   Any  absolute
           difference  value  lower  or  exact  than  this threshold will pick pixel components from first video
           stream.

       <b>elasticity</b>
           Set the elasticity of soft thresholding when processing video streams.  This  value  multiplied  with
           first  one  sets  second  threshold.   Any  absolute  difference  value  greater or exact than second
           threshold will pick pixel components from second video stream. For values between those two threshold
           linear interpolation between first and second video stream will be used.

       <b>reference</b>
           Enable the reference (third) video stream processing. By default is disabled.   If  set,  this  video
           stream will be used for calculating absolute difference with first video stream.

       <b>planes</b>
           Specify which planes will be processed. Defaults to all available.

       <u>Commands</u>

       This filter supports same <b>commands</b> as options.  The command accepts the same syntax of the  corresponding
       option.

       If the specified expression is not valid, it is kept at its current value.

   <b>lut,</b> <b>lutrgb,</b> <b>lutyuv</b>
       Compute  a look-up table for binding each pixel component input value to an output value, and apply it to
       the input video.

       <u>lutyuv</u> applies a lookup table to a YUV input video, <u>lutrgb</u> to an RGB input video.

       These filters accept the following parameters:

       <b>c0</b>  set first pixel component expression

       component values.

       The exact component associated to each of the <u>c*</u> options depends on the format in input.

       The  <u>lut</u>  filter  requires either YUV or RGB pixel formats in input, <u>lutrgb</u> requires RGB pixel formats in
       input, and <u>lutyuv</u> requires YUV.

       The expressions can contain the following constants and functions:

       <b>w</b>
       <b>h</b>   The input width and height.

       <b>val</b> The input value for the pixel component.

       <b>clipval</b>
           The input value, clipped to the <u>minval</u>-<u>maxval</u> range.

       <b>maxval</b>
           The maximum value for the pixel component.

       <b>minval</b>
           The minimum value for the pixel component.

       <b>negval</b>
           The negated value for the pixel component value, clipped to the <u>minval</u>-<u>maxval</u> range;  it  corresponds
           to the expression "maxval-clipval+minval".

       <b>clip(val)</b>
           The computed value in <u>val</u>, clipped to the <u>minval</u>-<u>maxval</u> range.

       <b>gammaval(gamma)</b>

           It                   corresponds                  to                  the                  expression
           "pow((clipval-minval)/(maxval-minval)\,<u>gamma</u>)*(maxval-minval)+minval"

       All expressions default to "clipval".

       <u>Commands</u>

       This filter supports same <b>commands</b> as options.

       <u>Examples</u>

       •   Negate input video:

       could in theory be used for fixing movies that were inverse-telecined incorrectly.

       A description of the accepted options follows.

       <b>max</b> Set  the  maximum  number  of  consecutive  frames which can be dropped (if positive), or the minimum
           interval between dropped frames (if negative). If the value is 0, the frame is  dropped  disregarding
           the number of previous sequentially dropped frames.

           Default value is 0.

       <b>keep</b>
           Set the maximum number of consecutive similar frames to ignore before to start dropping them.  If the
           value is 0, the frame is dropped disregarding the number of previous sequentially similar frames.

           Default value is 0.

       <b>hi</b>
       <b>lo</b>
       <b>frac</b>
           Set the dropping threshold values.

           Values  for  <b>hi</b>  and  <b>lo</b>  are for 8x8 pixel blocks and represent actual pixel value differences, so a
           threshold of 64 corresponds to 1  unit  of  difference  for  each  pixel,  or  the  same  spread  out
           differently over the block.

           A frame is a candidate for dropping if no 8x8 blocks differ by more than a threshold of <b>hi</b>, and if no
           more than <b>frac</b> blocks (1 meaning the whole image) differ by more than a threshold of <b>lo</b>.

           Default value for <b>hi</b> is 64*12, default value for <b>lo</b> is 64*5, and default value for <b>frac</b> is 0.33.

   <b>msad</b>
       Obtain the MSAD (Mean Sum of Absolute Differences) between two input videos.

       This filter takes two input videos.

       Both  input videos must have the same resolution and pixel format for this filter to work correctly. Also
       it assumes that both inputs have the same number of frames, which are compared one by one.

       The obtained per component, average, min and max MSAD is printed through the logging system.

       The filter stores the calculated MSAD of each frame in frame metadata.

       This filter also supports the <b>framesync</b> options.

       In the below example the input file <u>main.mpg</u> being processed is compared with the reference file <u>ref.mpg</u>.

               ffmpeg -i main.mpg -i ref.mpg -lavfi msad -f null -

   <b>multiply</b>
       Multiply first video stream pixels values with second video stream pixels values.

       The filter accepts the following options:

       <b>scale</b>
           Set the scale applied to second video stream. By default is 1.  Allowed range is from 0 to 9.

       <b>offset</b>
           Set the offset applied to second video stream. By default is 0.5.  Allowed range is from -1 to 1.

       <b>planes</b>
           Specify planes from input video stream that will be processed.  By default all planes are processed.

       <u>Commands</u>

       This filter supports same <b>commands</b> as options.

   <b>negate</b>
       Negate (invert) the input video.

       It accepts the following option:

       <b>components</b>
           Set components to negate.

           Available values for components are:

           <b>r</b>
           <b>g</b>
           <b>b</b>
       <b>negate_alpha</b>
           With value 1, it negates the alpha component, if present. Default value is 0.

       <u>Commands</u>

       This filter supports same <b>commands</b> as options.

   <b>nlmeans</b>
       Denoise frames using Non-Local Means algorithm.

       Each pixel is adjusted by looking for other pixels with similar  contexts.  This  context  similarity  is
       defined by comparing their surrounding patches of size <b>p</b>x<b>p</b>. Patches are searched in an area of <b>r</b>x<b>r</b> around
       the pixel.

       Note  that the research area defines centers for patches, which means some patches will be made of pixels
       outside that research area.

       The filter accepts the following options.

       <b>s</b>   Set denoising strength. Default is 1.0. Must be in range [1.0, 30.0].

       <b>p</b>   Set patch size. Default is 7. Must be odd number in range [0, 99].

       <b>pc</b>  Same as <b>p</b> but for chroma planes.

           The default value is <u>0</u> and means automatic.

       <b>r</b>   Set research size. Default is 15. Must be odd number in range [0, 99].

       <b>rc</b>  Same as <b>r</b> but for chroma planes.

           The default value is <u>0</u> and means automatic.

   <b>nnedi</b>

       This filter accepts the following options:

       <b>weights</b>
           Mandatory option, without binary file filter can  not  work.   Currently  file  can  be  found  here:
           https://github.com/dubhater/vapoursynth-nnedi3/blob/master/src/nnedi3_weights.bin

       <b>deint</b>
           Set which frames to deinterlace, by default it is "all".  Can be "all" or "interlaced".

       <b>field</b>
           Set mode of operation.

           Can be one of the following:

           <b>af</b>  Use frame flags, both fields.

           <b>a</b>   Use frame flags, single field.

           <b>t</b>   Use top field only.

           <b>b</b>   Use bottom field only.

           Set which planes to process, by default filter process all frames.

       <b>nsize</b>
           Set size of local neighborhood around each pixel, used by the predictor neural network.

           Can be one of the following:

           <b>s8x6</b>
           <b>s16x6</b>
           <b>s32x6</b>
           <b>s48x6</b>
           <b>s8x4</b>
           <b>s16x4</b>
           <b>s32x4</b>
       <b>nns</b> Set the number of neurons in predictor neural network.  Can be one of the following:

           <b>n16</b>
           <b>n32</b>
           <b>n64</b>
           <b>n128</b>
           <b>n256</b>
       <b>qual</b>
           Controls  the number of different neural network predictions that are blended together to compute the
           final output value. Can be "fast", default or "slow".

       <b>etype</b>
           Set which set of weights to use in the predictor.  Can be one of the following:

           <b>a,</b> <b>abs</b>
               weights trained to minimize absolute error

           <b>s,</b> <b>mse</b>
               weights trained to minimize squared error

       <b>pscrn</b>
           Controls whether or not the prescreener neural network is used  to  decide  which  pixels  should  be
           processed  by  the  predictor  neural network and which can be handled by simple cubic interpolation.
           The prescreener is trained to know whether cubic interpolation will be  sufficient  for  a  pixel  or
           whether  it should be predicted by the predictor nn.  The computational complexity of the prescreener
           nn is much less than  that  of  the  predictor  nn.  Since  most  pixels  can  be  handled  by  cubic
           interpolation, using the prescreener generally results in much faster processing.  The prescreener is
           pretty accurate, so the difference between using it and not using it is almost always unnoticeable.

           Can be one of the following:

           <b>none</b>
           <b>original</b>
           <b>new</b>
           <b>new2</b>
           <b>new3</b>

           Default is "new".

       <u>Examples</u>

       •   Force libavfilter to use a format different from <u>yuv420p</u> for the input to the vflip filter:

                   noformat=pix_fmts=yuv420p,vflip

       •   Convert the input video to any of the formats not contained in the list:

                   noformat=yuv420p|yuv444p|yuv410p

   <b>noise</b>
       Add noise on video input frame.

       The filter accepts the following options:

       <b>all_seed</b>
       <b>c0_seed</b>
       <b>c1_seed</b>
       <b>c2_seed</b>
       <b>c3_seed</b>
           Set  noise  seed  for  specific  pixel component or all pixel components in case of <u>all_seed</u>. Default

       <b>c3_strength,</b> <b>c3s</b>
           Set noise strength for specific pixel component or all pixel components in case <u>all_strength</u>. Default
           value is 0. Allowed range is [0, 100].

       <b>all_flags,</b> <b>allf</b>
       <b>c0_flags,</b> <b>c0f</b>
       <b>c1_flags,</b> <b>c1f</b>
       <b>c2_flags,</b> <b>c2f</b>
       <b>c3_flags,</b> <b>c3f</b>
           Set pixel component flags or set flags  for  all  components  if  <u>all_flags</u>.   Available  values  for
           component flags are:

           <b>a</b>   averaged temporal noise (smoother)

           <b>p</b>   mix random noise with a (semi)regular pattern

           <b>t</b>   temporal noise (noise pattern changes between frames)

           <b>u</b>   uniform noise (gaussian otherwise)

       <u>Examples</u>

       Add temporal and uniform noise to input video:

               noise=alls=20:allf=t+u

   <b>normalize</b>
       Normalize     RGB     video     (aka     histogram     stretching,     contrast     stretching).     See:
       https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normalization_(image_processing)

       For each channel of each frame, the filter computes the input range and maps it  linearly  to  the  user-
       specified  output  range.  The  output  range  defaults to the full dynamic range from pure black to pure
       white.

       Temporal smoothing can be used on the input range to reduce  flickering  (rapid  changes  in  brightness)
       caused  when  small dark or bright objects enter or leave the scene. This is similar to the auto-exposure
       (automatic gain control) on a video camera, and, like a video camera, it may cause a period of  over-  or
       under-exposure of the video.

       The  R,G,B  channels  can  be  normalized  independently,  which may cause some color shifting, or linked
       together as a single  channel,  which  prevents  color  shifting.  Linked  normalization  preserves  hue.
       Independent  normalization does not, so it can be used to remove some color casts. Independent and linked
       normalization can be combined in any ratio.

       The normalize filter accepts the following options:

       <b>blackpt</b>
       <b>whitept</b>
           Colors which define the output range. The minimum input value is mapped to the <u>blackpt</u>.  The  maximum
           input  value  is  mapped  to  the <u>whitept</u>.  The defaults are black and white respectively. Specifying
           white for <u>blackpt</u> and black for <u>whitept</u> will give color-inverted, normalized video.  Shades  of  grey
           can  be used to reduce the dynamic range (contrast). Specifying saturated colors here can create some
           interesting effects.

       <b>smoothing</b>
           The number of previous frames to use for temporal smoothing. The  input  range  of  each  channel  is
           smoothed  using  a  rolling  average  over  the  current frame and the <u>smoothing</u> previous frames. The
           default is 0 (no temporal smoothing).

       <b>independence</b>
           Controls the ratio of independent (color shifting) channel normalization to linked (color preserving)
           normalization. 0.0 is fully linked, 1.0 is fully independent. Defaults to 1.0 (fully independent).

       <b>strength</b>
           Overall strength of the filter. 1.0 is full strength. 0.0 is a rather expensive  no-op.  Defaults  to
           1.0 (full strength).

       <u>Commands</u>

       This  filter supports same <b>commands</b> as options, excluding <u>smoothing</u> option.  The command accepts the same
       syntax of the corresponding option.

       If the specified expression is not valid, it is kept at its current value.

       <u>Examples</u>

       Stretch video contrast to use the full dynamic range, with no temporal smoothing; may  flicker  depending
       on the source content:

               normalize=blackpt=black:whitept=white:smoothing=0

       As  above,  but  with 50 frames of temporal smoothing; flicker should be reduced, depending on the source
       content:

               normalize=blackpt=black:whitept=white:smoothing=50

       As above, but with hue-preserving linked channel normalization:

               normalize=blackpt=black:whitept=white:smoothing=50:independence=0

       As above, but with half strength:

               normalize=blackpt=black:whitept=white:smoothing=50:independence=0:strength=0.5

       Map the darkest input color to red, the brightest input color to cyan:

               normalize=blackpt=red:whitept=cyan

   <b>null</b>
       Pass the video source unchanged to the output.

   <b>ocr</b>
       Optical Character Recognition

       This filter uses Tesseract for optical character recognition. To enable compilation of this  filter,  you
       need to configure FFmpeg with "--enable-libtesseract".

       It accepts the following options:

       <b>datapath</b>
           Set datapath to tesseract data. Default is to use whatever was set at installation.

       <b>language</b>
           Set language, default is "eng".

       <b>whitelist</b>
           Set character whitelist.

       <b>blacklist</b>
           Set character blacklist.

       The filter exports recognized text as the frame metadata "lavfi.ocr.text".  The filter exports confidence
       of recognized words as the frame metadata "lavfi.ocr.confidence".

   <b>ocv</b>
       Apply a video transform using libopencv.

       To   enable   this  filter,  install  the  libopencv  library  and  headers  and  configure  FFmpeg  with
       "--enable-libopencv".

       It accepts the following parameters:

       <b>filter_name</b>
           The name of the libopencv filter to apply.

       <b>filter_params</b>
           The parameters to pass to the libopencv filter. If not specified, the default values are assumed.

       Refer    to    the    official    libopencv    documentation    for     more     precise     information:
       &lt;<b><a href="http://docs.opencv.org/master/modules/imgproc/doc/filtering.html">http://docs.opencv.org/master/modules/imgproc/doc/filtering.html</a></b>&gt;

       Several libopencv filters are supported; see the following subsections.

       <u>dilate</u>

       Dilate  an  image  by  using  a  specific  structuring element.  It corresponds to the libopencv function
       "cvDilate".

       It accepts the parameters: <u>struct_el</u>|<u>nb_iterations</u>.

       <u>struct_el</u> represents a structuring element, and has the syntax: <u>cols</u>x<u>rows</u>+<u>anchor_x</u>x<u>anchor_y</u>/<u>shape</u>

       <u>cols</u> and <u>rows</u> represent the number of columns and rows of the structuring element, <u>anchor_x</u> and  <u>anchor_y</u>
       the  anchor  point,  and  <u>shape</u>  the  shape  for  the structuring element. <u>shape</u> must be "rect", "cross",
       "ellipse", or "custom".

       If the value for <u>shape</u> is "custom", it must be followed by a string of the  form  "=<u>filename</u>".  The  file
       with name <u>filename</u> is assumed to represent a binary image, with each printable character corresponding to
       a bright pixel. When a custom <u>shape</u> is used, <u>cols</u> and <u>rows</u> are ignored, the number or columns and rows of
       the read file are assumed instead.

       The default value for <u>struct_el</u> is "3x3+0x0/rect".

       <u>nb_iterations</u> specifies the number of times the transform is applied to the image, and defaults to 1.

       Some examples:

               # Use the default values
               ocv=dilate

               # Dilate using a structuring element with a 5x5 cross, iterating two times
               ocv=filter_name=dilate:filter_params=5x5+2x2/cross|2

               # Read the shape from the file diamond.shape, iterating two times.
               # The file diamond.shape may contain a pattern of characters like this
               #   *
               #  ***
               # *****
               #  ***
               #   *
               # The specified columns and rows are ignored
               # but the anchor point coordinates are not
               ocv=dilate:0x0+2x2/custom=diamond.shape|2

       <u>erode</u>

       Erode  an  image  by  using  a  specific  structuring  element.  It corresponds to the libopencv function
       "cvErode".

       It accepts the parameters: <u>struct_el</u>:<u>nb_iterations</u>, with the same syntax  and  semantics  as  the  <b>dilate</b>
       filter.

       <u>smooth</u>

       Smooth the input video.

       The filter takes the following parameters: <u>type</u>|<u>param1</u>|<u>param2</u>|<u>param3</u>|<u>param4</u>.

       <u>type</u>  is  the  type  of  smooth  filter  to  apply,  and  must  be  one  of the following values: "blur",
       "blur_no_scale", "median", "gaussian", or "bilateral". The default value is "gaussian".

       The meaning of <u>param1</u>, <u>param2</u>, <u>param3</u>, and <u>param4</u> depends on the smooth type. <u>param1</u>  and  <u>param2</u>  accept
       integer positive values or 0. <u>param3</u> and <u>param4</u> accept floating point values.

       The default value for <u>param1</u> is 3. The default value for the other parameters is 0.

       These parameters correspond to the parameters assigned to the libopencv function "cvSmooth".

   <b>oscilloscope</b>
       2D Video Oscilloscope.

       Useful to measure spatial impulse, step responses, chroma delays, etc.

       It accepts the following parameters:

       <b>x</b>   Set scope center x position.

       <b>y</b>   Set scope center y position.

       <b>s</b>   Set scope size, relative to frame diagonal.

       <b>t</b>   Set scope tilt/rotation.

       <b>o</b>   Set trace opacity.

       <b>tx</b>  Set trace center x position.

       <b>ty</b>  Set trace center y position.

       <b>tw</b>  Set trace width, relative to width of frame.

       <b>g</b>   Draw trace grid. By default is enabled.

       <b>st</b>  Draw some statistics. By default is enabled.

       <b>sc</b>  Draw scope. By default is enabled.

       <u>Commands</u>

       This  filter supports same <b>commands</b> as options.  The command accepts the same syntax of the corresponding
       option.

       If the specified expression is not valid, it is kept at its current value.

       <u>Examples</u>

       •   Inspect full first row of video frame.

       A description of the accepted options follows.

       <b>x</b>
       <b>y</b>   Set the expression for the x and y coordinates of the overlaid video on the main video. Default value
           is  "0"  for  both expressions. In case the expression is invalid, it is set to a huge value (meaning
           that the overlay will not be displayed within the output visible area).

           Set the format for the output video.

           It accepts the following values:

           <b>yuv420</b>
               force YUV 4:2:0 8-bit planar output

           <b>yuv420p10</b>
               force YUV 4:2:0 10-bit planar output

           <b>yuv422</b>
               force YUV 4:2:2 8-bit planar output

           <b>yuv422p10</b>
               force YUV 4:2:2 10-bit planar output

           <b>yuv444</b>
               force YUV 4:4:4 8-bit planar output

           <b>yuv444p10</b>
               force YUV 4:4:4 10-bit planar output

           <b>rgb</b> force RGB 8-bit packed output

           <b>gbrp</b>
               force RGB 8-bit planar output

           <b>auto</b>
               automatically pick format

           Default value is <b>yuv420</b>.

       <b>repeatlast</b>
           See <b>framesync</b>.

       <b>alpha</b>
           Set format of alpha of the overlaid video, it can be <u>straight</u> or <u>premultiplied</u>. Default is <u>straight</u>.

       The <b>x</b>, and <b>y</b> expressions can contain the following parameters.

       <b>main_w,</b> <b>W</b>
       <b>main_h,</b> <b>H</b>
           The main input width and height.

       <b>overlay_w,</b> <b>w</b>
       <b>overlay_h,</b> <b>h</b>
           The overlay input width and height.

       <b>x</b>
       <b>y</b>   The computed values for <u>x</u> and <u>y</u>. They are evaluated for each new frame.

       <b>hsub</b>
       <b>vsub</b>
           horizontal and vertical chroma subsample values of the output  format.  For  example  for  the  pixel
           format "yuv422p" <u>hsub</u> is 2 and <u>vsub</u> is 1.

       <b>n</b>   the number of input frame, starting from 0

       <b>pos</b> the position in the file of the input frame, NAN if unknown; deprecated, do not use

       <b>t</b>   The timestamp, expressed in seconds. It's NAN if the input timestamp is unknown.

       This filter also supports the <b>framesync</b> options.

       Note  that  the <u>n</u>, <u>t</u> variables are available only when evaluation is done <u>per</u> <u>frame</u>, and will evaluate to
       NAN when <b>eval</b> is set to <b>init</b>.

       Be aware that frames are taken from each  input  video  in  timestamp  order,  hence,  if  their  initial
       timestamps  differ, it is a good idea to pass the two inputs through a <u>setpts=PTS-STARTPTS</u> filter to have
       them begin in the same zero timestamp, as the example for the <u>movie</u> filter does.

       You can chain together more overlays but you should test the efficiency of such approach.

       <u>Commands</u>

       This filter supports the following commands:

       <b>x</b>
       <b>y</b>   Modify the x and y of the overlay input.  The command accepts the same syntax  of  the  corresponding
           option.

           If the specified expression is not valid, it is kept at its current value.

       <u>Examples</u>

       •   Draw the overlay at 10 pixels from the bottom right corner of the main video:

                   overlay=main_w-overlay_w-10:main_h-overlay_h-10

           Using named options the example above becomes:

                   overlay=x=main_w-overlay_w-10:y=main_h-overlay_h-10

       •   Insert  a transparent PNG logo in the bottom left corner of the input, using the <b>ffmpeg</b> tool with the
           "-filter_complex" option:

                   ffmpeg -i input -i logo -filter_complex 'overlay=10:main_h-overlay_h-10' output

       •   Insert 2 different transparent PNG logos (second logo on bottom right corner) using the <b>ffmpeg</b> tool:

                   ffmpeg -i input -i logo1 -i logo2 -filter_complex 'overlay=x=10:y=H-h-10,overlay=x=W-w-10:y=H-h-10' output

       •   Add a transparent color layer on top of the main video; "WxH" must specify the size of the main input
           to the overlay filter:

                   color=color=red@.3:size=WxH [over]; [in][over] overlay [out]

       •   Play an original video and a filtered version (here with the deshake filter) side by side  using  the
           <b>ffplay</b> tool:

                   ffplay input.avi -vf 'split[a][b]; [a]pad=iw*2:ih[src]; [b]deshake[filt]; [src][filt]overlay=w'

           The above command is the same as:

                   ffplay input.avi -vf 'split[b], pad=iw*2[src], [b]deshake, [src]overlay=w'

       •   Make  a  sliding  overlay  appearing from the left to the right top part of the screen starting since
           time 2:

                   overlay=x='if(gte(t,2), -w+(t-2)*20, NAN)':y=0

       •   Compose output by putting two input videos side to side:

                   ffmpeg -i left.avi -i right.avi -filter_complex "
                   nullsrc=size=200x100 [background];
                   [0:v] setpts=PTS-STARTPTS, scale=100x100 [left];
                   [1:v] setpts=PTS-STARTPTS, scale=100x100 [right];
                   [background][left]       overlay=shortest=1       [background+left];
                   [background+left][right] overlay=shortest=1:x=100 [left+right]
                   "

       •   Mask 10-20 seconds of a video by applying the delogo filter to a section

                   ffmpeg -i test.avi -codec:v:0 wmv2 -ar 11025 -b:v 9000k
                   -vf '[in]split[split_main][split_delogo];[split_delogo]trim=start=360:end=371,delogo=0:0:640:480[delogoed];[split_main][delogoed]overlay=eof_action=pass[out]'
                   masked.avi

       •   Chain several overlays in cascade:

                   nullsrc=s=200x200 [bg];
                   testsrc=s=100x100, split=4 [in0][in1][in2][in3];
                   [in0] lutrgb=r=0, [bg]   overlay=0:0     [mid0];
                   [in1] lutrgb=g=0, [mid0] overlay=100:0   [mid1];
                   [in2] lutrgb=b=0, [mid1] overlay=0:100   [mid2];
                   [in3] null,       [mid2] overlay=100:100 [out0]

   <b>overlay_cuda</b>
       Overlay one video on top of another.

       This is the CUDA variant of the <b>overlay</b> filter.  It only accepts CUDA frames. The underlying input  pixel
       formats have to match.

       It  takes two inputs and has one output. The first input is the "main" video on which the second input is
       overlaid.

       It accepts the following parameters:

       <b>x</b>
       <b>y</b>   Set expressions for the x and y coordinates of the overlaid video on the main video.

           They can contain the following parameters:

           <b>main_w,</b> <b>W</b>
           <b>main_h,</b> <b>H</b>
               The main input width and height.

           <b>overlay_w,</b> <b>w</b>
           <b>overlay_h,</b> <b>h</b>
               The overlay input width and height.

           <b>x</b>
           <b>y</b>   The computed values for <u>x</u> and <u>y</u>. They are evaluated for each new frame.

           <b>n</b>   The ordinal index of the main input frame, starting from 0.

           <b>pos</b> The byte offset position in the file of the main input frame, NAN if unknown.  Deprecated, do not
               use.

           <b>t</b>   The timestamp of the main input frame, expressed in seconds, NAN if unknown.

           Default value is "0" for both expressions.

       <b>eval</b>
           Set when the expressions for <b>x</b> and <b>y</b> are evaluated.

           It accepts the following values:

           <b>init</b>
               Evaluate expressions once during filter initialization or when a command is processed.

           <b>frame</b>
               Evaluate expressions for each incoming frame

           Default value is <b>frame</b>.

       <b>shortest</b>
           See <b>framesync</b>.

       <b>repeatlast</b>
           See <b>framesync</b>.

       This filter also supports the <b>framesync</b> options.

   <b>owdenoise</b>
       Apply Overcomplete Wavelet denoiser.

       The filter accepts the following options:

       <b>depth</b>
           Set depth.

           Larger depth values will denoise lower frequency components more, but slow down filtering.

           Must be an int in the range 8-16, default is 8.

       <b>luma_strength,</b> <b>ls</b>
           Set luma strength.

           Must be a double value in the range 0-1000, default is 1.0.

       <b>chroma_strength,</b> <b>cs</b>
           Set chroma strength.

           Must be a double value in the range 0-1000, default is 1.0.

   <b>pad</b>
       Add paddings to the input image, and place the original input at the provided <u>x</u>, <u>y</u> coordinates.

       It accepts the following parameters:

       <b>width,</b> <b>w</b>
       <b>height,</b> <b>h</b>
           Specify an expression for the size of the output image with the paddings  added.  If  the  value  for
           <u>width</u> or <u>height</u> is 0, the corresponding input size is used for the output.

           The <u>width</u> expression can reference the value set by the <u>height</u> expression, and vice versa.

           The default value of <u>width</u> and <u>height</u> is 0.

       <b>x</b>
       <b>y</b>   Specify  the offsets to place the input image at within the padded area, with respect to the top/left
           border of the output image.

           The <u>x</u> expression can reference the value set by the <u>y</u> expression, and vice versa.

           The default value of <u>x</u> and <u>y</u> is 0.

           If <u>x</u> or <u>y</u> evaluate to a negative number, they'll be changed so the input image  is  centered  on  the
           padded area.

       <b>color</b>
           Specify the color of the padded area. For the syntax of this option, check the <b>"Color"</b> <b>section</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b>
           <b>ffmpeg-utils</b> <b>manual</b>.

           The default value of <u>color</u> is "black".

       <b>eval</b>
           Specify when to evaluate  <u>width</u>, <u>height</u>, <u>x</u> and <u>y</u> expression.

           It accepts the following values:

           <b>init</b>
               Only evaluate expressions once during the filter initialization or when a command is processed.

           <b>frame</b>
               Evaluate expressions for each incoming frame.

           Default value is <b>init</b>.

       <b>aspect</b>
           Pad to aspect instead to a resolution.

       The value for the <u>width</u>, <u>height</u>, <u>x</u>, and <u>y</u> options are expressions containing the following constants:

       <b>in_w</b>
       <b>in_h</b>
           The input video width and height.

       <b>iw</b>
       <b>ih</b>  These are the same as <u>in_w</u> and <u>in_h</u>.

       <b>out_w</b>
       <b>out_h</b>
           The  output  width  and  height  (the  size of the padded area), as specified by the <u>width</u> and <u>height</u>
           expressions.

       <b>ow</b>
       <b>oh</b>  These are the same as <u>out_w</u> and <u>out_h</u>.

       <b>x</b>
       <b>y</b>   The x and y offsets as specified by the <u>x</u> and <u>y</u> expressions, or NAN if not yet specified.

       <b>a</b>   same as <u>iw</u> / <u>ih</u>

       <b>sar</b> input sample aspect ratio

       <b>dar</b> input display aspect ratio, it is the same as (<u>iw</u> / <u>ih</u>) * <u>sar</u>

       <b>hsub</b>
       <b>vsub</b>
           The horizontal and vertical chroma subsample values. For example for the pixel format "yuv422p"  <u>hsub</u>
           is 2 and <u>vsub</u> is 1.

       <u>Examples</u>

       •   Add  paddings  with  the color "violet" to the input video. The output video size is 640x480, and the
           top-left corner of the input video is placed at column 0, row 40

                   pad=640:480:0:40:violet

           The example above is equivalent to the following command:

                   pad=width=640:height=480:x=0:y=40:color=violet

       •   Pad the input to get an output with dimensions increased by 3/2, and  put  the  input  video  at  the
           center of the padded area:

                   pad="3/2*iw:3/2*ih:(ow-iw)/2:(oh-ih)/2"

       •   Pad  the  input  to get a squared output with size equal to the maximum value between the input width
           and height, and put the input video at the center of the padded area:

                   pad="max(iw\,ih):ow:(ow-iw)/2:(oh-ih)/2"

       •   Pad the input to get a final w/h ratio of 16:9:

                   pad="ih*16/9:ih:(ow-iw)/2:(oh-ih)/2"

       •   In case of anamorphic video, in order to set the output display aspect correctly, it is necessary  to
           use <u>sar</u> in the expression, according to the relation:

                   (ih * X / ih) * sar = output_dar
                   X = output_dar / sar

           Thus the previous example needs to be modified to:

                   pad="ih*16/9/sar:ih:(ow-iw)/2:(oh-ih)/2"

       •   Double the output size and put the input video in the bottom-right corner of the output padded area:

                   pad="2*iw:2*ih:ow-iw:oh-ih"

   <b>palettegen</b>
       Generate one palette for a whole video stream.

       It accepts the following options:

       <b>max_colors</b>
           Set  the  maximum  number of colors to quantize in the palette.  Note: the palette will still contain
           256 colors; the unused palette entries will be black.

       <b>reserve_transparent</b>
           Create a palette of 255 colors maximum and reserve the  last  one  for  transparency.  Reserving  the
           transparency  color is useful for GIF optimization.  If not set, the maximum of colors in the palette
           will be 256. You probably want to disable this option for a standalone image.  Set by default.

       <b>transparency_color</b>
           Set the color that will be used as background for transparency.

       <b>stats_mode</b>
           Set statistics mode.

           It accepts the following values:

           <b>full</b>
               Compute full frame histograms.

           <b>diff</b>
               Compute histograms only for the part that differs from previous frame. This might be relevant  to
               give more importance to the moving part of your input if the background is static.

           <b>single</b>
               Compute new histogram for each frame.

           Default value is <u>full</u>.

       The filter also exports the frame metadata "lavfi.color_quant_ratio" ("nb_color_in / nb_color_out") which
       you can use to evaluate the degree of color quantization of the palette. This information is also visible
       at <u>info</u> logging level.

       <u>Examples</u>

       •   Generate a representative palette of a given video using <b>ffmpeg</b>:

                   ffmpeg -i input.mkv -vf palettegen palette.png

   <b>paletteuse</b>
       Use a palette to downsample an input video stream.

       The filter takes two inputs: one video stream and a palette. The palette must be a 256 pixels image.

       It accepts the following options:

       <b>dither</b>
           Select dithering mode. Available algorithms are:

           <b>bayer</b>
               Ordered 8x8 bayer dithering (deterministic)

           <b>heckbert</b>
               Dithering  as defined by Paul Heckbert in 1982 (simple error diffusion).  Note: this dithering is
               sometimes considered "wrong" and is included as a reference.

           <b>floyd_steinberg</b>
               Floyd and Steingberg dithering (error diffusion)

           <b>sierra2</b>
               Frankie Sierra dithering v2 (error diffusion)

           <b>sierra2_4a</b>
               Frankie Sierra dithering v2 "Lite" (error diffusion)

           <b>sierra3</b>
               Frankie Sierra dithering v3 (error diffusion)

           <b>burkes</b>
               Burkes dithering (error diffusion)

           <b>atkinson</b>
               Atkinson dithering by Bill Atkinson at Apple Computer (error diffusion)

           <b>none</b>
               Disable dithering.

           Default is <u>sierra2_4a</u>.

       <b>bayer_scale</b>
           When <u>bayer</u> dithering is selected, this option  defines  the  scale  of  the  pattern  (how  much  the
           crosshatch  pattern  is visible). A low value means more visible pattern for less banding, and higher
           value means less visible pattern at the cost of more banding.

           The option must be an integer value in the range [0,5]. Default is <u>2</u>.

       <b>diff_mode</b>
           If set, define the zone to process

           <b>rectangle</b>
               Only the changing rectangle will be reprocessed.  This  is  similar  to  GIF  cropping/offsetting
               compression  mechanism.  This  option  can  be  useful  for  speed if only a part of the image is
               changing, and has use cases such as limiting the scope  of  the  error  diffusal  <b>dither</b>  to  the
               rectangle  that  bounds  the  moving  scene  (it  leads to more deterministic output if the scene
               doesn't change much, and as a result less moving noise and better GIF compression).

           Default is <u>none</u>.

       <b>new</b> Take new palette for each output frame.

       <b>alpha_threshold</b>
           Sets the alpha threshold for transparency. Alpha values above  this  threshold  will  be  treated  as
           completely opaque, and values below this threshold will be treated as completely transparent.

           The option must be an integer value in the range [0,255]. Default is <u>128</u>.

       <u>Examples</u>

       •   Use a palette (generated for example with <b>palettegen</b>) to encode a GIF using <b>ffmpeg</b>:

                   ffmpeg -i input.mkv -i palette.png -lavfi paletteuse output.gif

   <b>perspective</b>
       Correct perspective of video not recorded perpendicular to the screen.

       A description of the accepted parameters follows.

       <b>x0</b>
       <b>y0</b>
       <b>x1</b>
       <b>y1</b>
       <b>x2</b>
       <b>y2</b>
       <b>x3</b>
       <b>y3</b>  Set  coordinates  expression  for top left, top right, bottom left and bottom right corners.  Default
           values are "0:0:W:0:0:H:W:H" with which perspective will remain unchanged.  If the "sense" option  is
           set  to  "source",  then  the specified points will be sent to the corners of the destination. If the
           "sense" option is set to "destination", then the corners of the source will be sent to the  specified
           coordinates.

           The expressions can use the following variables:

           <b>W</b>
           <b>H</b>   the width and height of video frame.

           <b>in</b>  Input frame count.

           <b>on</b>  Output frame count.

       to-video transfer.

       A description of the accepted parameters follows.

       <b>mode</b>
           Set phase mode.

           It accepts the following values:

           <b>p</b>   Capture  and  transfer  with the same field order. This mode only exists for the documentation of
               the other options to refer to, but if you actually select  it,  the  filter  will  faithfully  do
               nothing.

           <b>a</b>   Capture  field  order determined automatically by field flags, transfer opposite.  Filter selects
               among <b>t</b> and <b>b</b> modes on a frame by frame basis using field  flags.  If  no  field  information  is
               available, then this works just like <b>u</b>.

           <b>u</b>   Capture  unknown or varying, transfer opposite.  Filter selects among <b>t</b> and <b>b</b> on a frame by frame
               basis by analyzing the images and selecting the alternative that produces best match between  the
               fields.

           <b>T</b>   Capture  top-first,  transfer  unknown  or  varying.   Filter  selects  among <b>t</b> and <b>p</b> using image
               analysis.

           <b>B</b>   Capture bottom-first, transfer unknown or varying.  Filter selects among  <b>b</b>  and  <b>p</b>  using  image
               analysis.

           <b>A</b>   Capture  determined by field flags, transfer unknown or varying.  Filter selects among <b>t</b>, <b>b</b> and <b>p</b>
               using field flags and image analysis. If no field information is available, then this works  just
               like <b>U</b>. This is the default mode.

           <b>U</b>   Both  capture  and  transfer  unknown  or  varying.   Filter selects among <b>t</b>, <b>b</b> and <b>p</b> using image
               analysis only.

       <u>Commands</u>

       This filter supports the all above options as <b>commands</b>.

       <u>Examples</u>

       •   Change too high luma values to gradient:

                   pseudocolor="'if(between(val,ymax,amax),lerp(ymin,ymax,(val-ymax)/(amax-ymax)),-1):if(between(val,ymax,amax),lerp(umax,umin,(val-ymax)/(amax-ymax)),-1):if(between(val,ymax,amax),lerp(vmin,vmax,(val-ymax)/(amax-ymax)),-1):-1'"

   <b>psnr</b>
       Obtain the average, maximum and minimum PSNR (Peak Signal to Noise Ratio) between two input videos.

       This  filter  takes  in  input  two  input videos, the first input is considered the "main" source and is
       passed unchanged to the output. The second input is used as a "reference" video for computing the PSNR.

       Both video inputs must have the same resolution and pixel format for this filter to work correctly.  Also
       it assumes that both inputs have the same number of frames, which are compared one by one.

       The obtained average PSNR is printed through the logging system.

       The  filter  stores  the  accumulated  MSE  (mean  squared  error)  of  each frame, and at the end of the
       processing it is averaged across all frames equally, and the following formula is applied to  obtain  the
       PSNR:

               PSNR = 10*log10(MAX^2/MSE)

       Where MAX is the average of the maximum values of each component of the image.

       The description of the accepted parameters follows.

       <b>stats_file,</b> <b>f</b>
           If  specified  the  filter  will  use  the named file to save the PSNR of each individual frame. When
           filename equals "-" the data is sent to standard output.

       <b>stats_version</b>
           Specifies which version of the stats file format to use. Details of each format  are  written  below.
           Default value is 1.

       <b>stats_add_max</b>
           Determines  whether  the  max  value  is  output  to  the  stats  log.  Default value is 0.  Requires
           stats_version &gt;= 2. If this is set and stats_version &lt; 2, the filter will return an error.

       This filter also supports the <b>framesync</b> options.

       The file printed if <u>stats_file</u> is selected, contains a sequence of key/value pairs of the form  <u>key</u>:<u>value</u>
       for each compared couple of frames.

       If  a <u>stats_version</u> greater than 1 is specified, a header line precedes the list of per-frame-pair stats,
       with key value pairs following the frame format with the following parameters:

       <b>psnr_log_version</b>
           The version of the log file format. Will match <u>stats_version</u>.

       <b>fields</b>
           A comma separated list of the per-frame-pair parameters included in the log.

       A description of each shown per-frame-pair parameter follows:

       <b>n</b>   sequential number of the input frame, starting from 1

       <b>mse_avg</b>
           Mean Square Error pixel-by-pixel average difference of the compared frames,  averaged  over  all  the
           image components.

       <b>mse_y,</b> <b>mse_u,</b> <b>mse_v,</b> <b>mse_r,</b> <b>mse_g,</b> <b>mse_b,</b> <b>mse_a</b>
           Mean  Square  Error  pixel-by-pixel  average  difference  of  the  compared  frames for the component
           specified by the suffix.

       <b>psnr_y,</b> <b>psnr_u,</b> <b>psnr_v,</b> <b>psnr_r,</b> <b>psnr_g,</b> <b>psnr_b,</b> <b>psnr_a</b>
           Peak Signal to Noise ratio of the compared frames for the component specified by the suffix.

       <b>max_avg,</b> <b>max_y,</b> <b>max_u,</b> <b>max_v</b>
           Maximum allowed value for each channel, and average over all channels.

       <u>Examples</u>

       •   For example:

                   movie=ref_movie.mpg, setpts=PTS-STARTPTS [main];
                   [main][ref] psnr="stats_file=stats.log" [out]

           On this example the input file being processed is compared with the reference file <u>ref_movie.mpg</u>. The
           PSNR of each individual frame is stored in <u>stats.log</u>.

       •   Another example with different containers:

                   ffmpeg -i main.mpg -i ref.mkv -lavfi  "[0:v]settb=AVTB,setpts=PTS-STARTPTS[main];[1:v]settb=AVTB,setpts=PTS-STARTPTS[ref];[main][ref]psnr" -f null -

   <b>pullup</b>
       Pulldown reversal (inverse telecine) filter, capable of  handling  mixed  hard-telecine,  24000/1001  fps
       progressive, and 30000/1001 fps progressive content.

       The pullup filter is designed to take advantage of future context in making its decisions. This filter is
       stateless  in  the  sense that it does not lock onto a pattern to follow, but it instead looks forward to
       the following fields in order to identify matches and rebuild progressive frames.

       To produce content with an even framerate, insert the fps filter after pullup,  use  "fps=24000/1001"  if
       the input frame rate is 29.97fps, "fps=24" for 30fps and the (rare) telecined 25fps input.

       The filter accepts the following options:

       <b>jl</b>
       <b>jr</b>
       <b>jt</b>
       <b>jb</b>  These  options  set  the amount of "junk" to ignore at the left, right, top, and bottom of the image,
           respectively. Left and right are in units of 8 pixels, while top and bottom are in units of 2  lines.
           The default is 8 pixels on each side.

       <b>sb</b>  Set  the  strict  breaks.  Setting  this  option to 1 will reduce the chances of filter generating an
           occasional mismatched frame, but it may also cause an excessive number of frames to be dropped during
           high motion sequences.  Conversely, setting it to -1 will make filter match fields more easily.  This
           may help processing of video where there is slight blurring between the fields, but  may  also  cause
           there to be interlaced frames in the output.  Default value is 0.

       <b>mp</b>  Set the metric plane to use. It accepts the following values:

           <b>l</b>   Use luma plane.

           <b>u</b>   Use chroma blue plane.

           <b>v</b>   Use chroma red plane.

           This  option  may  be  set  to  use chroma plane instead of the default luma plane for doing filter's
           computations. This may improve accuracy on very clean source material, but more likely will  decrease
           accuracy,  especially  if  there  is  chroma noise (rainbow effect) or any grayscale video.  The main
           purpose of setting <b>mp</b> to a chroma plane is to reduce CPU load and make pullup usable in  realtime  on
           slow machines.

       For  best  results  (without  duplicated  frames in the output file) it is necessary to change the output
       frame rate. For example, to inverse telecine NTSC input:

               ffmpeg -i input -vf pullup -r 24000/1001 ...

   <b>qp</b>
       Change video quantization parameters (QP).

       The filter accepts the following option:

       <b>qp</b>  Set expression for quantization parameter.

       The expression is evaluated through the eval API and can contain, among others, the following constants:

       <u>known</u>
           1 if index is not 129, 0 otherwise.

       <u>qp</u>  Sequential index starting from -129 to 128.

       <u>Examples</u>

       •   Some equation like:

                   qp=2+2*sin(PI*qp)

   <b>qrencode</b>
       Generate a QR code using the libqrencode library (see &lt;<b>https://fukuchi.org/works/qrencode/</b>&gt;), and overlay
       it on top of the current frame.

       To enable the compilation of this filter, you need to configure FFmpeg with "--enable-libqrencode".

       The QR code is generated from the provided text or text pattern. The corresponding QR code is scaled  and
       overlayed into the video output according to the specified options.

       In case no text is specified, no QR code is overlaied.

       This filter accepts the following options:

       <b>qrcode_width,</b> <b>q</b>
       <b>padded_qrcode_width,</b> <b>Q</b>
           Specify  an  expression  for  the  width  of  the  rendered  QR  code,  with and without padding. The
           <u>qrcode_width</u> expression can reference the value set by the <u>padded_qrcode_width</u> expression,  and  vice
           versa.  By default <u>padded_qrcode_width</u> is set to <u>qrcode_width</u>, meaning that there is no padding.

           These expressions are evaluated for each new frame.

           See the <b>qrencode</b> <b>Expressions</b> section for details.

       <b>x</b>
       <b>y</b>   Specify  an  expression  for  positioning  the  padded QR code top-left corner.  The <u>x</u> expression can
           reference the value set by the <u>y</u> expression, and vice.

           By default <u>x</u> and <u>y</u> are set set to <u>0</u>, meaning that the QR code is placed in the top left corner of the
           input.

           These expressions are evaluated for each new frame.

           See the <b>qrencode</b> <b>Expressions</b> section for details.

       <b>case_sensitive,</b> <b>cs</b>
           Instruct libqrencode to use case sensitive encoding. This is enabled by default. This can be disabled
           to reduce the QR encoding size.

       <b>level,</b> <b>l</b>
           Specify the QR encoding error correction level. With an higher correction level,  the  encoding  size
           will increase but the code will be more robust to corruption.  Lower level is <u>L</u>.

           It accepts the following values:

           <b>L</b>
           <b>M</b>
           <b>Q</b>
           <b>H</b>
       <b>expansion</b>
           Select  how the input text is expanded. Can be either "none", or "normal" (default). See the <b>qrencode</b>
           <b>Text</b> <b>expansion</b> section below for details.

       <b>text</b>
       <b>textfile</b>
           Define the text to be rendered. In case neither is specified, no QR is encoded (just an empty colored
           frame).

           In case expansion is enabled, the text is treated as a text template, using  the  qrencode  expansion
           mechanism. See the <b>qrencode</b> <b>Text</b> <b>expansion</b> section below for details.

       <b>background_color,</b> <b>bc</b>
       <b>foreground_color,</b> <b>fc</b>
           Set  the  QR code and background color. The default value of <u>foreground_color</u> is "black", the default
           value of <u>background_color</u> is "white".

           For the syntax of the color options, check the <b>"Color"</b> <b>section</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ffmpeg-utils</b> <b>manual</b>.

       <u>qrencode</u> <u>Expressions</u>

       The expressions set by the options contain the following constants and functions.

       <b>dar</b> input display aspect ratio, it is the same as (<u>w</u> / <u>h</u>) * <u>sar</u>

       <b>duration</b>
           the current frame's duration, in seconds

       <b>hsub</b>
       <b>vsub</b>
           horizontal and vertical chroma subsample values. For example for the pixel format "yuv422p" <u>hsub</u> is 2
           and <u>vsub</u> is 1.

       <b>main_h,</b> <b>H</b>
           the input height

       <b>main_w,</b> <b>W</b>
           the input width

       <b>n</b>   the number of input frame, starting from 0

       <b>pict_type</b>
           a number representing the picture type

       <b>qr_w,</b> <b>w</b>
           the width of the encoded QR code

       <b>rendered_qr_w,</b> <b>q</b>
       <b>rendered_padded_qr_w,</b> <b>Q</b>
           the width of the rendered QR code, without and without padding.

           These parameters allow the <u>q</u> and <u>Q</u> expressions to refer to each other, so you can for example specify
           "q=3/4*Q".

       <b>rand(min,</b> <b>max)</b>
           return a random number included between <u>min</u> and <u>max</u>

       <b>sar</b> the input sample aspect ratio

       <b>t</b>   timestamp expressed in seconds, NAN if the input timestamp is unknown

       <b>x</b>
       <b>y</b>   the x and y offset coordinates where the text is drawn.

           These parameters allow the <u>x</u> and <u>y</u> expressions to refer to each other, so you can for example specify
           "y=x/dar".

       <u>qrencode</u> <u>Text</u> <u>expansion</u>

       If <b>expansion</b> is set to "none", the text is printed verbatim.

       If <b>expansion</b> is set to "normal" (which is the default), the following expansion mechanism is used.

       The backslash character <b>\</b>, followed by any character, always expands to the second character.

       Sequences of the form "%{...}" are expanded. The text between the braces is  a  function  name,  possibly
       followed  by  arguments separated by ':'.  If the arguments contain special characters or delimiters (':'
       or '}'), they should be escaped.

       Note that they probably must also be escaped as the value for the <b>text</b>  option  in  the  filter  argument
       string  and  as the filter argument in the filtergraph description, and possibly also for the shell, that
       makes up to four levels of escaping; using a text file with the <b>textfile</b> option avoids these problems.

       The following functions are available:

       <b>n,</b> <b>frame_num</b>
           return the frame number

       <b>pts</b> Return the presentation timestamp of the current frame.

           It can take up to two arguments.

           The first argument is the format of the timestamp; it defaults to "flt"  for  seconds  as  a  decimal
           number  with  microsecond  accuracy;  "hms"  stands  for  a  formatted <u>[-]HH:MM:SS.mmm</u> timestamp with
           millisecond accuracy.  "gmtime" stands for  the  timestamp  of  the  frame  formatted  as  UTC  time;
           "localtime" stands for the timestamp of the frame formatted as local time zone time. If the format is
           set to "hms24hh", the time is formatted in 24h format (00-23).

           The second argument is an offset added to the timestamp.

           If  the  format  is  set to "localtime" or "gmtime", a third argument may be supplied: a "strftime" C
           function format string. By default, <u>YYYY-MM-DD</u> <u>HH:MM:SS</u> format will be used.

       <b>expr,</b> <b>e</b>
           Evaluate the expression's value and output as a double.

           It must take one argument specifying the expression to be  evaluated,  accepting  the  constants  and
           functions defined in <b>qrencode_expressions</b>.

       <b>expr_formatted,</b> <b>ef</b>
           Evaluate the expression's value and output as a formatted string.

           The  first  argument  is  the  expression to be evaluated, just as for the <u>expr</u> function.  The second
           argument specifies the output format. Allowed values are <b>x</b>, <b>X</b>, <b>d</b> and <b>u</b>. They are treated  exactly  as
           in  the "printf" function.  The third parameter is optional and sets the number of positions taken by
           the output.  It can be used to add padding with zeros from the left.

       <b>gmtime</b>
           The time at which the filter is running, expressed in UTC.  It can accept an argument: a "strftime" C
           function format string.  The format string is extended to support the variable <u>%[1-6]N</u>  which  prints
           fractions of the second with optionally specified number of digits.

       <b>localtime</b>
           The  time  at  which  the  filter  is  running,  expressed  in the local time zone.  It can accept an
           argument: a "strftime" C function format string.  The  format  string  is  extended  to  support  the
           variable <u>%[1-6]N</u> which prints fractions of the second with optionally specified number of digits.

       <b>metadata</b>
           Frame metadata. Takes one or two arguments.

           The first argument is mandatory and specifies the metadata key.

           The  second  argument  is  optional  and specifies a default value, used when the metadata key is not
           found or empty.

           Available metadata can be identified by inspecting entries starting with  TAG  included  within  each
           frame section printed by running "ffprobe -show_frames".

           String metadata generated in filters leading to the qrencode filter are also available.

       <b>rand(min,</b> <b>max)</b>
           return a random number included between <u>min</u> and <u>max</u>

       <u>Examples</u>

       •   Generate a QR code encoding the timestamp expressed as a float:

                   qrencode=text=%{pts}

   <b>quirc</b>
       Identify and decode a QR code using the libquirc library  (see  &lt;<b>https://github.com/dlbeer/quirc/</b>&gt;),  and
       print the identified QR codes positions and payload as metadata.

       To enable the compilation of this filter, you need to configure FFmpeg with "--enable-libquirc".

       For each found QR code in the input video, some metadata entries are added with the prefix <u>lavfi.quirc.N</u>,
       where <u>N</u> is the index, starting from 0, associated to the QR code.

       A description of each metadata value follows:

       <b>lavfi.quirc.count</b>
           the number of found QR codes, it is not set in case none was found

       <b>lavfi.quirc.N.corner.M.x</b>
       <b>lavfi.quirc.N.coreer.M.y</b>
           the  x/y  positions of the four corners of the square containing the QR code, where <u>M</u> is the index of
           the corner starting from 0

       <b>lavfi.quirc.N.payload</b>
           the payload of the QR code

   <b>random</b>
       Flush video frames from internal cache of frames into a random order.  No frame is  discarded.   Inspired
       by <b>frei0r</b> nervous filter.

       <b>frames</b>
           Set size in number of frames of internal cache, in range from 2 to 512. Default is 30.

       <b>seed</b>
           Set  seed for random number generator, must be an integer included between 0 and "UINT32_MAX". If not
           specified, or if explicitly set to less than 0, the filter will try to use a good random  seed  on  a
           best effort basis.

   <b>readeia608</b>
       Read closed captioning (EIA-608) information from the top lines of a video frame.

       This  filter  adds frame metadata for "lavfi.readeia608.X.cc" and "lavfi.readeia608.X.line", where "X" is
       the number of the identified line with EIA-608 data (starting from 0). A  description  of  each  metadata
       value follows:

       <b>lavfi.readeia608.X.cc</b>
           The two bytes stored as EIA-608 data (printed in hexadecimal).

       <b>lavfi.readeia608.X.line</b>
           The number of the line on which the EIA-608 data was identified and read.

       This filter accepts the following options:

       <b>scan_min</b>
           Set the line to start scanning for EIA-608 data. Default is 0.

       <b>scan_max</b>
           Set the line to end scanning for EIA-608 data. Default is 29.

       <b>spw</b> Set  the  ratio of width reserved for sync code detection.  Default is 0.27. Allowed range is "[0.1 -
           0.7]".

       <b>chp</b> Enable checking the parity bit. In the event of a parity error, the filter will output 0x00 for  that
           character. Default is false.

       <b>lp</b>  Lowpass lines prior to further processing. Default is enabled.

       <u>Commands</u>

       This filter supports the all above options as <b>commands</b>.

       <u>Examples</u>

       •   Output a csv with presentation time and the first two lines of identified EIA-608 captioning data.

                   ffprobe -f lavfi -i movie=captioned_video.mov,readeia608 -show_entries frame=pts_time:frame_tags=lavfi.readeia608.0.cc,lavfi.readeia608.1.cc -of csv

   <b>readvitc</b>
       Read vertical interval timecode (VITC) information from the top lines of a video frame.

       The  filter  adds frame metadata key "lavfi.readvitc.tc_str" with the timecode value, if a valid timecode
       has been detected. Further metadata key  "lavfi.readvitc.found"  is  set  to  0/1  depending  on  whether
       timecode data has been found or not.

       This filter accepts the following options:

       <b>scan_max</b>
           Set the maximum number of lines to scan for VITC data. If the value is set to -1 the full video frame
           is scanned. Default is 45.

       <b>thr_b</b>
           Set the luma threshold for black. Accepts float numbers in the range [0.0,1.0], default value is 0.2.
           The value must be equal or less than "thr_w".

       <b>thr_w</b>
           Set the luma threshold for white. Accepts float numbers in the range [0.0,1.0], default value is 0.6.
           The value must be equal or greater than "thr_b".

       <u>Examples</u>

       •   Detect and draw VITC data onto the video frame; if no valid VITC is detected, draw "--:--:--:--" as a
           placeholder:

                   ffmpeg -i input.avi -filter:v 'readvitc,drawtext=fontfile=FreeMono.ttf:text=%{metadata\\:lavfi.readvitc.tc_str\\:--\\\\\\:--\\\\\\:--\\\\\\:--}:x=(w-tw)/2:y=400-ascent'

   <b>remap</b>
       Remap pixels using 2nd: Xmap and 3rd: Ymap input video stream.

       Destination  pixel at position (X, Y) will be picked from source (x, y) position where x = Xmap(X, Y) and
       y = Ymap(X, Y). If mapping values are out of range, zero value for pixel will  be  used  for  destination
       pixel.

       Xmap  and  Ymap  input  video streams must be of same dimensions. Output video stream will have Xmap/Ymap
       video stream dimensions.  Xmap and Ymap input video streams are 16bit depth, single channel.

       <b>format</b>
           Specify pixel format of output from this filter. Can be "color" or "gray".  Default is "color".

       <b>fill</b>
           Specify the color of the unmapped pixels. For the syntax of this option, check the <b>"Color"</b> <b>section</b> <b>in</b>
           <b>the</b> <b>ffmpeg-utils</b> <b>manual</b>. Default color is "black".

   <b>removegrain</b>
       The removegrain filter is a spatial denoiser for progressive video.

       <b>m0</b>  Set mode for the first plane.

       <b>m1</b>  Set mode for the second plane.

       <b>m2</b>  Set mode for the third plane.

       <b>m3</b>  Set mode for the fourth plane.

       Range of mode is from 0 to 24. Description of each mode follows:

       <u>0</u>   Leave input plane unchanged. Default.

       <u>1</u>   Clips the pixel with the minimum and maximum of the 8 neighbour pixels.

       <u>2</u>   Clips the pixel with the second minimum and maximum of the 8 neighbour pixels.

       <u>3</u>   Clips the pixel with the third minimum and maximum of the 8 neighbour pixels.

       <u>4</u>   Clips the pixel with the fourth minimum and maximum of the 8 neighbour pixels.  This is equivalent to
           a median filter.

       <u>5</u>   Line-sensitive clipping giving the minimal change.

       <u>6</u>   Line-sensitive clipping, intermediate.

       <u>7</u>   Line-sensitive clipping, intermediate.

       <u>8</u>   Line-sensitive clipping, intermediate.

       <u>9</u>   Line-sensitive clipping on a line where the neighbours pixels are the closest.

       <u>10</u>  Replaces the target pixel with the closest neighbour.

       <u>11</u>  [1 2 1] horizontal and vertical kernel blur.

       <u>12</u>  Same as mode 11.

       <u>13</u>  Bob mode, interpolates top field from the line where the neighbours pixels are the closest.

       <u>14</u>  Bob mode, interpolates bottom field from the line where the neighbours pixels are the closest.

       <u>15</u>  Bob mode, interpolates top field. Same as 13 but with a more complicated interpolation formula.

       <u>16</u>  Bob mode, interpolates bottom field. Same as 14 but with a more complicated interpolation formula.

       <u>17</u>  Clips the pixel with the minimum and maximum of respectively the maximum and minimum of each pair  of
           opposite neighbour pixels.

       <u>18</u>  Line-sensitive  clipping  using opposite neighbours whose greatest distance from the current pixel is
           minimal.

       <u>19</u>  Replaces the pixel with the average of its 8 neighbours.

       <u>20</u>  Averages the 9 pixels ([1 1 1] horizontal and vertical blur).

       <u>21</u>  Clips pixels using the averages of opposite neighbour.

       <u>22</u>  Same as mode 21 but simpler and faster.

       <u>23</u>  Small edge and halo removal, but reputed useless.

       <u>24</u>  Similar as 23.

   <b>removelogo</b>
       Suppress a TV station logo, using an image file to determine which pixels comprise the logo. It works  by
       filling in the pixels that comprise the logo with neighboring pixels.

       The filter accepts the following options:

       <b>filename,</b> <b>f</b>
           Set  the  filter  bitmap  file, which can be any image format supported by libavformat. The width and
           height of the image file must match those of the video stream being processed.

       Pixels in the provided bitmap image with a value of zero are not considered part of  the  logo,  non-zero
       pixels  are  considered part of the logo. If you use white (255) for the logo and black (0) for the rest,
       you will be safe. For making the filter bitmap, it is recommended to take a screen  capture  of  a  black
       frame  with  the  logo  visible,  and  then using a threshold filter followed by the erode filter once or
       twice.

       If needed, little splotches can be fixed manually. Remember that if logo  pixels  are  not  covered,  the
       filter  quality  will be much reduced. Marking too many pixels as part of the logo does not hurt as much,
       but it will increase the amount of blurring needed  to  cover  over  the  image  and  will  destroy  more
       information than necessary, and extra pixels will slow things down on a large logo.

   <b>repeatfields</b>
       This  filter  uses  the  repeat_field flag from the Video ES headers and hard repeats fields based on its
       value.

   <b>reverse</b>
       Reverse a video clip.

       Warning: This filter requires memory to buffer the entire clip, so trimming is suggested.

       <u>Examples</u>

   <b>rotate</b>
       Rotate video by an arbitrary angle expressed in radians.

       The filter accepts the following options:

       A description of the optional parameters follows.

       <b>angle,</b> <b>a</b>
           Set  an  expression for the angle by which to rotate the input video clockwise, expressed as a number
           of radians. A negative value will result in a counter-clockwise rotation. By default  it  is  set  to
           "0".

           This expression is evaluated for each frame.

       <b>out_w,</b> <b>ow</b>
           Set  the  output  width  expression,  default  value is "iw".  This expression is evaluated just once
           during configuration.

       <b>out_h,</b> <b>oh</b>
           Set the output height expression, default value is "ih".  This  expression  is  evaluated  just  once
           during configuration.

       <b>bilinear</b>
           Enable bilinear interpolation if set to 1, a value of 0 disables it. Default value is 1.

       <b>fillcolor,</b> <b>c</b>
           Set  the  color used to fill the output area not covered by the rotated image. For the general syntax
           of this option, check the <b>"Color"</b> <b>section</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ffmpeg-utils</b> <b>manual</b>.  If the special value "none" is
           selected then no background is printed (useful for example if the background is never shown).

           Default value is "black".

       The expressions for the angle and the output size can contain the following constants and functions:

       <b>n</b>   sequential number of the input frame, starting from 0. It is always NAN before  the  first  frame  is
           filtered.

       <b>t</b>   time  in  seconds  of the input frame, it is set to 0 when the filter is configured. It is always NAN
           before the first frame is filtered.

       <b>hsub</b>
       <b>vsub</b>
           horizontal and vertical chroma subsample values. For example for the pixel format "yuv422p" <u>hsub</u> is 2
           and <u>vsub</u> is 1.

       <b>in_w,</b> <b>iw</b>
       <b>in_h,</b> <b>ih</b>
           the input video width and height

       <b>out_w,</b> <b>ow</b>
       <b>out_h,</b> <b>oh</b>
           the output width and height, that is the size of the padded area as specified by the <u>width</u> and <u>height</u>
           expressions

       <b>rotw(a)</b>
       <b>roth(a)</b>
           the minimal width/height required for completely containing the input video rotated by <u>a</u> radians.

           These are only available when computing the <b>out_w</b> and <b>out_h</b> expressions.

       <u>Examples</u>

       •   Rotate the input by PI/6 radians clockwise:

                   rotate=PI/6

       •   Rotate the input by PI/6 radians counter-clockwise:

                   rotate=-PI/6

       •   Rotate the input by 45 degrees clockwise:

                   rotate=45*PI/180

       •   Apply a constant rotation with period T, starting from an angle of PI/3:

                   rotate=PI/3+2*PI*t/T

       •   Make the input video rotation oscillating with a period of T seconds and an amplitude of A radians:

                   rotate=A*sin(2*PI/T*t)

       •   Rotate the video, output size is chosen so that the whole rotating input video is  always  completely
           contained in the output:

                   rotate='2*PI*t:ow=hypot(iw,ih):oh=ow'

       •   Rotate the video, reduce the output size so that no background is ever shown:

                   rotate=2*PI*t:ow='min(iw,ih)/<a href="../man2/sqrt.2.html">sqrt</a>(2)':oh=ow:c=none

       <u>Commands</u>

       The filter supports the following commands:

       <b>a,</b> <b>angle</b>
           Set the angle expression.  The command accepts the same syntax of the corresponding option.

           If the specified expression is not valid, it is kept at its current value.

   <b>sab</b>
       Apply Shape Adaptive Blur.

       The filter accepts the following options:

       <b>luma_radius,</b> <b>lr</b>
           Set  luma  blur  filter  strength,  must be a value in range 0.1-4.0, default value is 1.0. A greater
           value will result in a more blurred image, and in slower processing.

       <b>luma_pre_filter_radius,</b> <b>lpfr</b>
           Set luma pre-filter radius, must be a value in the 0.1-2.0 range, default value is 1.0.

       <b>luma_strength,</b> <b>ls</b>
           Set luma maximum difference between pixels to still be considered, must be a value in  the  0.1-100.0
           range, default value is 1.0.

       <b>chroma_radius,</b> <b>cr</b>
           Set  chroma blur filter strength, must be a value in range -0.9-4.0. A greater value will result in a
           more blurred image, and in slower processing.

       <b>chroma_pre_filter_radius,</b> <b>cpfr</b>
           Set chroma pre-filter radius, must be a value in the -0.9-2.0 range.

       <b>chroma_strength,</b> <b>cs</b>
           Set chroma maximum difference between pixels  to  still  be  considered,  must  be  a  value  in  the
           -0.9-100.0 range.

       Each chroma option value, if not explicitly specified, is set to the corresponding luma option value.

   <b>scale</b>
       Scale (resize) the input video, using the libswscale library.

       The  scale  filter  forces  the  output display aspect ratio to be the same of the input, by changing the
       output sample aspect ratio.

       If the input image format is different from the format requested by the next  filter,  the  scale  filter
       will convert the input to the requested format.

       <u>Options</u>

       The  filter accepts the following options, any of the options supported by the libswscale scaler, as well
       as any of the <b>framesync</b> options.

       See <b>the</b> <b>ffmpeg-scaler</b> <b>manual</b> for the complete list of scaler options.

       <b>width,</b> <b>w</b>
       <b>height,</b> <b>h</b>
           Set the output video dimension expression. Default value is the input dimension.

           If the <u>width</u> or <u>w</u> value is 0, the input width is used for the output. If the <u>height</u> or <u>h</u> value is  0,
           the input height is used for the output.

           If one and only one of the values is -n with n &gt;= 1, the scale filter will use a value that maintains
           the  aspect  ratio  of  the input image, calculated from the other specified dimension. After that it
           will, however, make sure that the calculated dimension is divisible by n  and  adjust  the  value  if
           necessary.

           If  both  values  are -n with n &gt;= 1, the behavior will be identical to both values being set to 0 as
           previously detailed.

           See below for the list of accepted constants for use in the dimension expression.

       <b>eval</b>
           Specify when to evaluate <u>width</u> and <u>height</u> expression. It accepts the following values:

           <b>init</b>
               Only evaluate expressions once during the filter initialization or when a command is processed.

           <b>frame</b>
               Evaluate expressions for each incoming frame.

           Default value is <b>init</b>.

       <b>interl</b>
           Set the interlacing mode. It accepts the following values:

           <b>1</b>   Force interlaced aware scaling.

           <b>0</b>   Do not apply interlaced scaling.

           <b>-1</b>  Select interlaced aware scaling depending on whether the source frames are flagged as  interlaced
               or not.

           Default value is <b>0</b>.

       <b>flags</b>
           Set  libswscale  scaling  flags. See <b>the</b> <b>ffmpeg-scaler</b> <b>manual</b> for the complete list of values. If not
           explicitly specified the filter applies the default flags.

       <b>param0,</b> <b>param1</b>
           Set libswscale input parameters for scaling algorithms that need them. See <b>the</b>  <b>ffmpeg-scaler</b>  <b>manual</b>
           for the complete documentation. If not explicitly specified the filter applies empty parameters.

       <b>size,</b> <b>s</b>
           Set the video size. For the syntax of this option, check the <b>"Video</b> <b>size"</b> <b>section</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ffmpeg-utils</b>
           <b>manual</b>.

       <b>in_color_matrix</b>
       <b>out_color_matrix</b>
           Set in/output YCbCr color space type.

           This  allows  the autodetected value to be overridden as well as allows forcing a specific value used
           for the output and encoder.

           If not specified, the color space type depends on the pixel format.

           Possible values:

           <b>auto</b>
               Choose automatically.

           <b>bt709</b>
               Format conforming to International Telecommunication Union (ITU) Recommendation BT.709.

           <b>fcc</b> Set color space conforming to the United States Federal Communications Commission (FCC)  Code  of
               Federal Regulations (CFR) Title 47 (2003) 73.682 (a).

           <b>bt470</b>
           <b>smpte170m</b>
               Set color space conforming to:

               •   ITU Radiocommunication Sector (ITU-R) Recommendation BT.601

               •   ITU-R Rec. BT.470-6 (1998) Systems B, B1, and G

               •   Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers (SMPTE) ST 170:2004

           <b>smpte240m</b>
               Set color space conforming to SMPTE ST 240:1999.

           <b>bt2020</b>
               Set color space conforming to ITU-R BT.2020 non-constant luminance system.

       <b>in_range</b>
       <b>out_range</b>
           Set in/output YCbCr sample range.

           This  allows  the autodetected value to be overridden as well as allows forcing a specific value used
           for the output and encoder. If not specified, the range depends on the pixel format. Possible values:

           <b>auto/unknown</b>
               Choose automatically.

           <b>jpeg/full/pc</b>
               Set full range (0-255 in case of 8-bit luma).

           <b>mpeg/limited/tv</b>
               Set "MPEG" range (16-235 in case of 8-bit luma).

       <b>in_chroma_loc</b>
       <b>out_chroma_loc</b>
           Set in/output chroma sample location. If not specified,  center-sited  chroma  is  used  by  default.
           Possible values:

           <b>auto,</b> <b>unknown</b>
           <b>left</b>
           <b>center</b>
           <b>topleft</b>
           <b>top</b>
           <b>bottomleft</b>
           <b>bottom</b>
       <b>force_original_aspect_ratio</b>
           Enable decreasing or increasing output video width or height if necessary to keep the original aspect
           ratio. Possible values:

           <b>disable</b>
               Scale the video as specified and disable this feature.

           <b>decrease</b>
               The output video dimensions will automatically be decreased if needed.

           <b>increase</b>
               The output video dimensions will automatically be increased if needed.

           One  useful  instance  of  this  option  is  that  when  you know a specific device's maximum allowed
           resolution, you can use this to limit the output video to that, while retaining the aspect ratio. For
           example, device A allows 1280x720 playback, and your video is 1920x800. Using this option (set it  to
           decrease) and specifying 1280x720 to the command line makes the output 1280x533.

           Please  note  that this is a different thing than specifying -1 for <b>w</b> or <b>h</b>, you still need to specify
           the output resolution for this option to work.

       <b>force_divisible_by</b>
           Ensures that both the output dimensions, width and height, are divisible by the  given  integer  when
           used  together  with  <b>force_original_aspect_ratio</b>.  This  works  similar to using "-n" in the <b>w</b> and <b>h</b>
           options.

           This option respects the value set for  <b>force_original_aspect_ratio</b>,  increasing  or  decreasing  the
           resolution accordingly. The video's aspect ratio may be slightly modified.

           This  option can be handy if you need to have a video fit within or exceed a defined resolution using
           <b>force_original_aspect_ratio</b> but also have encoder restrictions on width or height divisibility.

       The values of the <b>w</b> and <b>h</b> options are expressions containing the following constants:

       <u>in_w</u>
       <u>in_h</u>
           The input width and height

       <u>iw</u>
       <u>ih</u>  These are the same as <u>in_w</u> and <u>in_h</u>.

       <u>sar</u> input sample aspect ratio

       <u>dar</u> The input display aspect ratio. Calculated from "(iw / ih) * sar".

       <u>hsub</u>
       <u>vsub</u>

           <u>hsub</u> is 2 and <u>vsub</u> is 1.

       <u>ohsub</u>
       <u>ovsub</u>
           horizontal  and  vertical  output chroma subsample values. For example for the pixel format "yuv422p"
           <u>hsub</u> is 2 and <u>vsub</u> is 1.

       <u>n</u>   The (sequential) number of the input frame, starting from 0.  Only available with "eval=frame".

       <u>t</u>   The presentation timestamp of the input frame, expressed as a number of seconds. Only available  with
           "eval=frame".

       <u>pos</u> The  position  (byte  offset)  of  the  frame  in  the  input  stream,  or NaN if this information is
           unavailable and/or meaningless (for example  in  case  of  synthetic  video).   Only  available  with
           "eval=frame".  Deprecated, do not use.

       <u>ref_w,</u> <u>rw</u>

       <u>ref_dar,</u> <u>rdar</u>
       <u>ref_n</u>
       <u>ref_t</u>
       <u>ref_pos</u>
           Eqvuialent  to  the  above,  but for a second reference input. If any of these variables are present,
           this filter accepts two inputs.

       <u>Examples</u>

       •   Scale the input video to a size of 200x100

                   scale=w=200:h=100

           This is equivalent to:

                   scale=200:100

           or:

                   scale=200x100

       •   Specify a size abbreviation for the output size:

                   scale=qcif

           which can also be written as:

                   scale=size=qcif

       •   Scale the input to 2x:

                   scale=w=2*iw:h=2*ih

       •   The above is the same as:

                   scale=2*in_w:2*in_h

       •   Scale the input to 2x with forced interlaced scaling:

                   scale=2*iw:2*ih:interl=1

       •   Scale the input to half size:

                   scale=w=iw/2:h=ih/2

       •   Increase the width, and set the height to the same size:

                   scale=3/2*iw:ow

       •   Seek Greek harmony:

                   scale=iw:1/PHI*iw
                   scale=ih*PHI:ih

       •   Increase the height, and set the width to 3/2 of the height:

                   scale=w=3/2*oh:h=3/5*ih

       •   Increase the size, making the size a multiple of the chroma subsample values:

                   scale="trunc(3/2*iw/hsub)*hsub:trunc(3/2*ih/vsub)*vsub"

       •   Increase the width to a maximum of 500 pixels, keeping the same aspect ratio as the input:

                   scale=w='min(500\, iw*3/2):h=-1'

       •   Make pixels square by combining scale and setsar:

                   scale='trunc(ih*dar):ih',setsar=1/1

       •   Make pixels square by combining scale and setsar,  making  sure  the  resulting  resolution  is  even
           (required by some codecs):

                   scale='trunc(ih*dar/2)*2:trunc(ih/2)*2',setsar=1/1

       •   Scale a subtitle stream (sub) to match the main video (main) in size before overlaying. ("scale2ref")

       <u>Commands</u>

       This filter supports the following commands:

       <b>width,</b> <b>w</b>
       <b>height,</b> <b>h</b>
           Set  the output video dimension expression.  The command accepts the same syntax of the corresponding
           option.

           If the specified expression is not valid, it is kept at its current value.

   <b>scale_cuda</b>
       Scale (resize) and convert (pixel format) the input video, using accelerated CUDA kernels.   Setting  the
       output width and height works in the same way as for the <b>scale</b> filter.

       The filter accepts the following options:

       <b>w</b>
       <b>h</b>   Set the output video dimension expression. Default value is the input dimension.

           Allows for the same expressions as the <b>scale</b> filter.

       <b>interp_algo</b>
           Sets the algorithm used for scaling:

           <u>nearest</u>
               Nearest neighbour

               Used by default if input parameters match the desired output.

           <u>bilinear</u>
               Bilinear

           <u>bicubic</u>
               Bicubic

               This is the default.

           <u>lanczos</u>
               Lanczos

       <b>format</b>
           Controls  the  output  pixel  format.  By default, or if none is specified, the input pixel format is
           used.

           The filter does not support converting between YUV and RGB pixel formats.

       <b>passthrough</b>
           If set to 0, every frame is processed, even if no conversion is necessary.  This mode can  be  useful
           to use the filter as a buffer for a downstream frame-consumer that exhausts the limited decoder frame
           pool.

           If set to 1, frames are passed through as-is if they match the desired output parameters. This is the
           default behaviour.

       <b>param</b>
           Algorithm-Specific parameter.

           Affects the curves of the bicubic algorithm.

       <b>force_original_aspect_ratio</b>
       <b>force_divisible_by</b>
           Work the same as the identical <b>scale</b> filter options.

       <u>Examples</u>

       •   Scale input to 720p, keeping aspect ratio and ensuring the output is yuv420p.

                   scale_cuda=-2:720:format=yuv420p

       •   Upscale to 4K using nearest neighbour algorithm.

                   scale_cuda=4096:2160:interp_algo=nearest

       •   Don't do any conversion or scaling, but copy all input frames into newly allocated ones.  This can be
           useful to deal with a filter and encode chain that otherwise exhausts the decoders frame pool.

                   scale_cuda=passthrough=0

   <b>scale_npp</b>
       Use  the NVIDIA Performance Primitives (libnpp) to perform scaling and/or pixel format conversion on CUDA
       video frames. Setting the output width and height works in the same way as for the <u>scale</u> filter.

       The following additional options are accepted:

       <b>format</b>
           The pixel format of the output CUDA frames. If set to the string  "same"  (the  default),  the  input
           format  will  be kept. Note that automatic format negotiation and conversion is not yet supported for
           hardware frames

       <b>interp_algo</b>
           The interpolation algorithm used for resizing. One of the following:

           <b>nn</b>  Nearest neighbour.

           <b>linear</b>
           <b>cubic</b>
           <b>cubic2p_bspline</b>
               2-parameter cubic (B=1, C=0)

           <b>cubic2p_catmullrom</b>
               2-parameter cubic (B=0, C=1/2)

           <b>cubic2p_b05c03</b>
               2-parameter cubic (B=1/2, C=3/10)

           <b>super</b>
               Supersampling

           <b>lanczos</b>
       <b>force_original_aspect_ratio</b>
           Enable decreasing or increasing output video width or height if necessary to keep the original aspect
           ratio. Possible values:

           <b>disable</b>
               Scale the video as specified and disable this feature.

           <b>decrease</b>
               The output video dimensions will automatically be decreased if needed.

           <b>increase</b>
               The output video dimensions will automatically be increased if needed.

           One useful instance of this option is  that  when  you  know  a  specific  device's  maximum  allowed
           resolution, you can use this to limit the output video to that, while retaining the aspect ratio. For
           example,  device A allows 1280x720 playback, and your video is 1920x800. Using this option (set it to
           decrease) and specifying 1280x720 to the command line makes the output 1280x533.

           Please note that this is a different thing than specifying -1 for <b>w</b> or <b>h</b>, you still need  to  specify
           the output resolution for this option to work.

       <b>force_divisible_by</b>
           Ensures  that  both  the output dimensions, width and height, are divisible by the given integer when
           used together with <b>force_original_aspect_ratio</b>. This works similar to using  "-n"  in  the  <b>w</b>  and  <b>h</b>
           options.

           This  option  respects  the  value  set for <b>force_original_aspect_ratio</b>, increasing or decreasing the
           resolution accordingly. The video's aspect ratio may be slightly modified.

           This option can be handy if you need to have a video fit within or exceed a defined resolution  using
           <b>force_original_aspect_ratio</b> but also have encoder restrictions on width or height divisibility.

       <b>eval</b>
           Specify when to evaluate <u>width</u> and <u>height</u> expression. It accepts the following values:

           unavailable  and/or  meaningless  (for  example  in  case  of  synthetic video).  Only available with
           "eval=frame".  Deprecated, do not use.

   <b>scale2ref_npp</b>
       Use the NVIDIA Performance Primitives (libnpp) to scale (resize) the input video, based  on  a  reference
       video.

       See  the  <b>scale_npp</b>  filter for available options, scale2ref_npp supports the same but uses the reference
       video instead of the main input as basis. scale2ref_npp also supports the following additional  constants
       for the <b>w</b> and <b>h</b> options:

           "eval=frame".

       <u>Examples</u>

       •   Scale a subtitle stream (b) to match the main video (a) in size before overlaying

                   'scale2ref_npp[b][a];[a][b]overlay_cuda'

       •   Scale a logo to 1/10th the height of a video, while preserving its display aspect ratio.

   <b>scdet</b>
       Detect video scene change.

       This  filter  sets  frame metadata with mafd between frame, the scene score, and forward the frame to the
       next filter, so they can use these metadata to detect scene change or others.

       In addition, this filter logs a message and sets frame  metadata  when  it  detects  a  scene  change  by
       <b>threshold</b>.

       "lavfi.scd.mafd" metadata keys are set with mafd for every frame.

       "lavfi.scd.score" metadata keys are set with scene change score for every frame to detect scene change.

       "lavfi.scd.time"  metadata  keys  are set with current filtered frame time which detect scene change with
       <b>threshold</b>.

       The filter accepts the following options:

       <b>threshold,</b> <b>t</b>
           Set the scene change detection threshold as a percentage of maximum change. Good values  are  in  the
           "[8.0, 14.0]" range. The range for <b>threshold</b> is "[0., 100.]".

       <b>sc_pass,</b> <b>s</b>
           Set  the flag to pass scene change frames to the next filter. Default value is 0 You can enable it if
           you want to get snapshot of scene change frames only.

   <b>selectivecolor</b>
       Adjust cyan, magenta, yellow and black (CMYK) to certain ranges of colors  (such  as  "reds",  "yellows",
       "greens",  "cyans",  ...).  The  adjustment  range  is defined by the "purity" of the color (that is, how
       saturated it already is).

       This filter is similar to the Adobe Photoshop Selective Color tool.

       The filter accepts the following options:

       <b>correction_method</b>
           Select color correction method.

           Available values are:

           <b>absolute</b>
               Specified adjustments are applied "as-is" (added/subtracted to original pixel component value).

           <b>relative</b>
               Specified adjustments are relative to the original component value.

           Default is "absolute".

       <b>reds</b>
           Adjustments for red pixels (pixels where the red component is the maximum)

       <b>yellows</b>
           Adjustments for yellow pixels (pixels where the blue component is the minimum)

       <b>greens</b>
           Adjustments for green pixels (pixels where the green component is the maximum)

       <b>cyans</b>
           Adjustments for cyan pixels (pixels where the red component is the minimum)

       <b>blues</b>
           Adjustments for blue pixels (pixels where the blue component is the maximum)

       <b>magentas</b>
           Adjustments for magenta pixels (pixels where the green component is the minimum)

       <b>whites</b>
           Adjustments for white pixels (pixels where all components are greater than 128)

       <b>neutrals</b>
           Adjustments for all pixels except pure black and pure white

       <b>blacks</b>
           Adjustments for black pixels (pixels where all components are lesser than 128)

       <b>psfile</b>
           Specify a Photoshop selective color file (".asv") to import the settings from.

       All the adjustment settings (<b>reds</b>, <b>yellows</b>, ...) accept up to 4 space separated floating point adjustment
       values in the [-1,1] range, respectively to adjust the amount of cyan, magenta, yellow and black for  the
       pixels of its range.

       <u>Examples</u>

       •   Increase  cyan  by  50% and reduce yellow by 33% in every green areas, and increase magenta by 27% in
           blue areas:

                   selectivecolor=greens=.5 0 -.33 0:blues=0 .27

       •   Use a Photoshop selective color preset:

                   selectivecolor=psfile=MySelectiveColorPresets/Misty.asv

   <b>separatefields</b>
       The "separatefields" takes a frame-based video input and splits each frame into  its  components  fields,
       producing a new half height clip with twice the frame rate and twice the frame count.

       This  filter  use  field-dominance  information  in frame to decide which of each pair of fields to place
       first in the output.  If it gets it wrong use <b>setfield</b> filter before "separatefields" filter.

   <b>setdar,</b> <b>setsar</b>
       The "setdar" filter sets the Display Aspect Ratio for the filter output video.

       This is done by changing the specified Sample (aka  Pixel)  Aspect  Ratio,  according  to  the  following
       equation:

               &lt;DAR&gt; = &lt;HORIZONTAL_RESOLUTION&gt; / &lt;VERTICAL_RESOLUTION&gt; * &lt;SAR&gt;

       Keep  in mind that the "setdar" filter does not modify the pixel dimensions of the video frame. Also, the
       display aspect ratio set by this filter may be changed by later filters in the filterchain, e.g. in  case
       of scaling or if another "setdar" or a "setsar" filter is applied.

       The "setsar" filter sets the Sample (aka Pixel) Aspect Ratio for the filter output video.

       Note that as a consequence of the application of this filter, the output display aspect ratio will change
       according to the equation above.

       Keep  in  mind that the sample aspect ratio set by the "setsar" filter may be changed by later filters in
       the filterchain, e.g. if another "setsar" or a "setdar" filter is applied.

       It accepts the following parameters:

       <b>r,</b> <b>ratio,</b> <b>dar</b> <b>("setdar"</b> <b>only),</b> <b>sar</b> <b>("setsar"</b> <b>only)</b>
           Set the aspect ratio used by the filter.

           The parameter can be a floating point number string, or  an  expression.  If  the  parameter  is  not
           specified, the value "0" is assumed, meaning that the same input value is used.

       <b>max</b> Set  the  maximum  integer  value  to  use for expressing numerator and denominator when reducing the
           expressed aspect ratio to a rational.  Default value is 100.

       The parameter <u>sar</u> is an expression containing the following constants:

       <b>w,</b> <b>h</b>
           The input width and height.

       <b>a</b>   Same as <u>w</u> / <u>h</u>.

       <b>sar</b> The input sample aspect ratio.

       <b>dar</b> The input display aspect ratio. It is the same as (<u>w</u> / <u>h</u>) * <u>sar</u>.

       <b>hsub,</b> <b>vsub</b>
           Horizontal and vertical chroma subsample values. For example, for the pixel format "yuv422p" <u>hsub</u>  is
           2 and <u>vsub</u> is 1.

       <u>Examples</u>

       •   To change the display aspect ratio to 16:9, specify one of the following:

                   setdar=dar=1.77777
                   setdar=dar=16/9

       •   To change the sample aspect ratio to 10:11, specify:

                   setsar=sar=10/11

       •   To  set  a  display  aspect  ratio of 16:9, and specify a maximum integer value of 1000 in the aspect
           ratio reduction, use the command:

                   setdar=ratio=16/9:max=1000

   <b>setfield</b>
       Force field for the output video frame.

       The "setfield" filter marks the interlace type field for the output frames. It does not change the  input
       frame,  but  only  sets  the  corresponding property, which affects how the frame is treated by following
       filters (e.g. "fieldorder" or "yadif").

       The filter accepts the following options:

       <b>mode</b>
           Available values are:

           <b>auto</b>

           <b>prog</b>
               Mark the frame as progressive.

   <b>setparams</b>
       Force frame parameter for the output video frame.

       The "setparams" filter marks interlace and color range for the output frames.  It  does  not  change  the
       input  frame,  but  only  sets  the  corresponding  property,  which  affects how the frame is treated by
       filters/encoders.

           highlighted.

           Both options accept the following values:

           <b>tout</b>
               Identify <u>temporal</u> <u>outliers</u> pixels. A <u>temporal</u> <u>outlier</u> is a pixel unlike the neighboring pixels of

               within a frame. In born-digital video vertical line repetition is common,  but  this  pattern  is
               uncommon  in video digitized from an analog source. When it occurs in video that results from the
               digitization of an analog source it can indicate concealment from a dropout compensator.

       If a chroma or alpha option is not explicitly set, the corresponding luma value is set.

   <b>sobel</b>
       Apply sobel operator to input video stream.

       The filter accepts the following option:

       <b>planes</b>
           Set  which  planes  will  be processed, unprocessed planes will be copied.  By default value 0xf, all
           planes will be processed.

       <b>scale</b>
           Set value which will be multiplied with filtered result.

       <b>delta</b>
           Set value which will be added to filtered result.

       <u>Commands</u>

       This filter supports the all above options as <b>commands</b>.

   <b>spp</b>
       Apply a simple postprocessing filter that compresses and decompresses the image at several (or -  in  the
       case of <b>quality</b> level 6 - all) shifts and average the results.

       The filter accepts the following options:

       <b>quality</b>
           Set  quality.  This  option  defines the number of levels for averaging. It accepts an integer in the
           range 0-6. If set to 0, the filter will have no effect. A value of 6 means the  higher  quality.  For
           each increment of that value the speed drops by a factor of approximately 2.  Default value is 3.

       <b>qp</b>  Force a constant quantization parameter. If not set, the filter will use the QP from the video stream
           (if available).

       <b>mode</b>
           Set thresholding mode. Available modes are:

           <b>hard</b>
               Set hard thresholding (default).

           <b>soft</b>
               Set soft thresholding (better de-ringing effect, but likely blurrier).

       <b>use_bframe_qp</b>
           Enable the use of the QP from the B-Frames if set to 1. Using this option may cause flicker since the
           B-Frames have often larger QP. Default is 0 (not enabled).

       <u>Commands</u>

       This filter supports the following commands:

       <b>quality,</b> <b>level</b>
           Set quality level. The value "max" can be used to set the maximum level, currently 6.

   <b>sr</b>
       Scale  the  input by applying one of the super-resolution methods based on convolutional neural networks.
       Supported models:

       •   Super-Resolution Convolutional Neural Network model (SRCNN).  See &lt;<b>https://arxiv.org/abs/1501.00092</b>&gt;.

       •   Efficient     Sub-Pixel     Convolutional      Neural      Network      model      (ESPCN).       See
           &lt;<b>https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.05158</b>&gt;.

       &lt;<b>https://github.com/HighVoltageRocknRoll/sr.git</b>&gt;.

       The filter accepts the following options:

       <b>dnn_backend</b>
           Specify  which  DNN backend to use for model loading and execution. This option accepts the following
           values:

           <b>tensorflow</b>
               TensorFlow backend. To enable this backend you need to install the TensorFlow for C library  (see
               &lt;<b>https://www.tensorflow.org/install/lang_c</b>&gt;) and configure FFmpeg with "--enable-libtensorflow"

       <b>model</b>
           Set  path  to  model  file  specifying  network architecture and its parameters.  Note that different
           backends use different file formats. TensorFlow, OpenVINO backend can load files for only its format.

       <b>scale_factor</b>
           Set scale factor for SRCNN model. Allowed values are 2, 3 and 4.  Default value is 2. Scale factor is
           necessary for SRCNN model, because it accepts input upscaled  using  bicubic  upscaling  with  proper
           scale factor.

       To get full functionality (such as async execution), please use the <b>dnn_processing</b> filter.

   <b>ssim</b>
       Obtain the SSIM (Structural SImilarity Metric) between two input videos.

       This  filter  takes  in  input  two  input videos, the first input is considered the "main" source and is
       passed unchanged to the output. The second input is used as a "reference" video for computing the SSIM.

       Both video inputs must have the same resolution and pixel format for this filter to work correctly.  Also
       it assumes that both inputs have the same number of frames, which are compared one by one.

       The filter stores the calculated SSIM of each frame.

       The description of the accepted parameters follows.

       <b>stats_file,</b> <b>f</b>
           If  specified  the  filter  will  use  the named file to save the SSIM of each individual frame. When
           filename equals "-" the data is sent to standard output.

       The file printed if <u>stats_file</u> is selected, contains a sequence of key/value pairs of the form  <u>key</u>:<u>value</u>
       for each compared couple of frames.

       A description of each shown parameter follows:

       <b>n</b>   sequential number of the input frame, starting from 1

       <b>Y,</b> <b>U,</b> <b>V,</b> <b>R,</b> <b>G,</b> <b>B</b>
           SSIM of the compared frames for the component specified by the suffix.

       <b>All</b> SSIM of the compared frames for the whole frame.

       <b>dB</b>  Same as above but in dB representation.

       This filter also supports the <b>framesync</b> options.

       <u>Examples</u>

       •   For example:

                   movie=ref_movie.mpg, setpts=PTS-STARTPTS [main];
                   [main][ref] ssim="stats_file=stats.log" [out]

           On this example the input file being processed is compared with the reference file <u>ref_movie.mpg</u>. The
           SSIM of each individual frame is stored in <u>stats.log</u>.

       •   Another example with both psnr and ssim at same time:

                   ffmpeg -i main.mpg -i ref.mpg -lavfi  "ssim;[0:v][1:v]psnr" -f null -

       •   Another example with different containers:

                   ffmpeg -i main.mpg -i ref.mkv -lavfi  "[0:v]settb=AVTB,setpts=PTS-STARTPTS[main];[1:v]settb=AVTB,setpts=PTS-STARTPTS[ref];[main][ref]ssim" -f null -

           Set number of inputs. Default is 2.

       <b>map</b> Set input indexes to remap to outputs.

       <u>Commands</u>

       The "streamselect" and "astreamselect" filter supports the following commands:

       <b>map</b> Set input indexes to remap to outputs.

       <u>Examples</u>

       •   Select first 5 seconds 1st stream and rest of time 2nd stream:

                   sendcmd='5.0 streamselect map 1',streamselect=inputs=2:map=0

       •   Same as above, but for audio:

                   asendcmd='5.0 astreamselect map 1',astreamselect=inputs=2:map=0

   <b>subtitles</b>
       Draw subtitles on top of input video using the libass library.

       To  enable  compilation  of  this filter you need to configure FFmpeg with "--enable-libass". This filter
       also requires a build with libavcodec and libavformat  to  convert  the  passed  subtitles  file  to  ASS
       (Advanced Substation Alpha) subtitles format.

       The filter accepts the following options:

       <b>filename,</b> <b>f</b>
           Set the filename of the subtitle file to read. It must be specified.

       <b>original_size</b>
           Specify the size of the original video, the video for which the ASS file was composed. For the syntax
           of this option, check the <b>"Video</b> <b>size"</b> <b>section</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ffmpeg-utils</b> <b>manual</b>.  Due to a misdesign in ASS
           aspect  ratio arithmetic, this is necessary to correctly scale the fonts if the aspect ratio has been
           changed.

       <b>fontsdir</b>
           Set a directory path containing fonts that can be used by the filter.  These fonts will  be  used  in
           addition to whatever the font provider uses.

       <b>alpha</b>
           Process alpha channel, by default alpha channel is untouched.

       <b>charenc</b>
           Set subtitles input character encoding. "subtitles" filter only. Only useful if not UTF-8.

       <b>stream_index,</b> <b>si</b>
           Set subtitles stream index. "subtitles" filter only.

       <b>force_style</b>
           Override default style or script info parameters of the subtitles. It accepts a string containing ASS
           style format "KEY=VALUE" couples separated by ",".

       <b>wrap_unicode</b>
           Break  lines  according to the Unicode Line Breaking Algorithm. Availability requires at least libass
           release 0.17.0 (or LIBASS_VERSION 0x01600010), <u>and</u> libass must have been built with libunibreak.

           The option is enabled by default except for native ASS.

       If the first key is not specified, it is assumed that the first value specifies the <b>filename</b>.

       For example, to render the file <u>sub.srt</u> on top of the input video, use the command:

               subtitles=sub.srt

       which is equivalent to:

               subtitles=filename=sub.srt

       To render the default subtitles stream from file <u>video.mkv</u>, use:

               subtitles=video.mkv

       To render the second subtitles stream from that file, use:

               subtitles=video.mkv:si=1

       To make the subtitles stream from <u>sub.srt</u> appear in 80% transparent blue "DejaVu Serif", use:

               subtitles=sub.srt:force_style='Fontname=DejaVu Serif,PrimaryColour=&amp;HCCFF0000'

   <b>super2xsai</b>
       Scale the input by 2x and  smooth  using  the  Super2xSaI  (Scale  and  Interpolate)  pixel  art  scaling
       algorithm.

       Useful for enlarging pixel art images without reducing sharpness.

       Apply threshold effect to video stream.

       This filter needs four video streams to perform thresholding.  First stream is stream we  are  filtering.
       Second stream is holding threshold values, third stream is holding min values, and last, fourth stream is
       holding max values.

       The filter accepts the following option:

       <b>planes</b>
           Set  which  planes  will  be processed, unprocessed planes will be copied.  By default value 0xf, all
           planes will be processed.

       For example if first stream pixel's component value is less then threshold value of pixel component  from
       2nd  threshold stream, third stream value will picked, otherwise fourth stream pixel component value will
       be picked.

       Using color source filter one can perform various types of thresholding:

       <u>Commands</u>

       This filter supports the all options as <b>commands</b>.

       <u>Examples</u>

       •   Binary threshold, using gray color as threshold:

                   ffmpeg -i 320x240.avi -f lavfi -i color=gray -f lavfi -i color=black -f lavfi -i color=white -lavfi threshold output.avi

       •   Inverted binary threshold, using gray color as threshold:

                   ffmpeg -i 320x240.avi -f lavfi -i color=gray -f lavfi -i color=white -f lavfi -i color=black -lavfi threshold output.avi

       •   Truncate binary threshold, using gray color as threshold:

                   ffmpeg -i 320x240.avi -f lavfi -i color=gray -i 320x240.avi -f lavfi -i color=gray -lavfi threshold output.avi

       •   Threshold to zero, using gray color as threshold:

                   ffmpeg -i 320x240.avi -f lavfi -i color=gray -f lavfi -i color=white -i 320x240.avi -lavfi threshold output.avi

       •   Inverted threshold to zero, using gray color as threshold:

                   ffmpeg -i 320x240.avi -f lavfi -i color=gray -i 320x240.avi -f lavfi -i color=white -lavfi threshold output.avi

   <b>thumbnail</b>
       Select the most representative frame in a given sequence of consecutive frames.

       The filter accepts the following options:

       <b>n</b>   Set the frames batch size to analyze; in a set of <u>n</u> frames, the filter will pick  one  of  them,  and
           then handle the next batch of <u>n</u> frames until the end. Default is 100.

       <b>log</b> Set the log level to display picked frame stats.  Default is "info".

       Since  the  filter  keeps  track  of  the whole frames sequence, a bigger <u>n</u> value will result in a higher
       memory usage, so a high value is not recommended.

       <u>Examples</u>

       •   Extract one picture each 50 frames:

                   thumbnail=50

       •   Complete example of a thumbnail creation with <b>ffmpeg</b>:

                   ffmpeg -i in.avi -vf thumbnail,scale=300:200 -frames:v 1 out.png

   <b>tile</b>
       Tile several successive frames together.

       The <b>untile</b> filter can do the reverse.

       The filter accepts the following options:

       <b>layout</b>
           Set the grid size in the form "COLUMNSxROWS". Range is up to UINT_MAX cells.  Default is "6x5".

       <b>nb_frames</b>
           Set the maximum number of frames to render in the given area. It must be less than or equal  to  <u>w</u>x<u>h</u>.
           The default value is 0, meaning all the area will be used.

       <b>margin</b>
           Set the outer border margin in pixels. Range is 0 to 1024. Default is 0.

       <b>padding</b>
           Set  the inner border thickness (i.e. the number of pixels between frames). For more advanced padding
           options (such as having different values for the edges), refer to the pad video filter. Range is 0 to
           1024. Default is 0.

       <b>color</b>
           Specify the color of the unused area. For the syntax of this option, check the <b>"Color"</b> <b>section</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b>
           <b>ffmpeg-utils</b> <b>manual</b>.  The default value of <u>color</u> is "black".

       <b>overlap</b>
           Set the number of frames to overlap when tiling several successive frames together.  The  value  must
           be between 0 and <u>nb_frames</u> <u>-</u> <u>1</u>. Default is 0.

       <b>init_padding</b>
           Set  the  number of frames to initially be empty before displaying first output frame.  This controls
           how soon will one get first output frame.  The value must be between 0 and <u>nb_frames</u> <u>-</u> <u>1</u>. Default  is
           0.

       <u>Examples</u>

       •   Produce 8x8 PNG tiles of all keyframes (<b>-skip_frame</b> <b>nokey</b>) in a movie:

                   ffmpeg -skip_frame nokey -i file.avi -vf 'scale=128:72,tile=8x8' -an -vsync 0 keyframes%03d.png

           The  <b>-vsync</b>  <b>0</b>  is  necessary to prevent <b>ffmpeg</b> from duplicating each output frame to accommodate the
           originally detected frame rate.

       •   Display 5 pictures in an area of "3x2" frames, with 7 pixels between them, and 2  pixels  of  initial
           margin, using mixed flat and named options:

                   tile=3x2:nb_frames=5:padding=7:margin=2

   <b>tiltandshift</b>
       Apply tilt-and-shift effect.

       What happens when you invert time and space?

       Normally  a  video  is  composed of several frames that represent a different instant of time and shows a
       scene that evolves in the space captured by the frame. This filter  is  the  antipode  of  that  concept,
       taking inspiration from tilt and shift photography.

       A  filtered  frame  contains the whole timeline of events composing the sequence, and this is obtained by
       placing a slice of pixels from each frame into a single one. However, since there are  no  infinite-width
       frames,  this  is  done  up  the width of the input frame, and a video is recomposed by shifting away one
       column for each subsequent frame. In order to map space to time, the filter tilts  each  input  frame  as
       well,  so  that  motion  is preserved. This is accomplished by progressively selecting a different column
       from each input frame.

       The end result is a sort of inverted parallax, so that far away objects move much faster that the ones in
       the front. The ideal conditions for this video effect are when there is either very little motion and the
       backgroud is static, or when there is a lot of motion and a very wide depth of field (e.g. wide panorama,
       while moving on a train).

       The filter accepts the following parameters:

       <b>tilt</b>
           Tilt video while shifting (default). When unset, video will be sliding a static  image,  composed  of
           the first column of each frame.

       <b>start</b>
           What to do at the start of filtering (see below).

       <b>end</b> What to do at the end of filtering (see below).

       <b>hold</b>
           How many columns should pass through before start of filtering.

       <b>pad</b> How many columns should be inserted before end of filtering.

       Normally  the filter shifts and tilts from the very first frame, and stops when the last one is received.
       However, before filtering starts, normal video may be preseved, so that the effect is slowly  shifted  in
       its  place. Similarly, the last video frame may be reconstructed at the end. Alternatively it is possible
       to just start and end with black.

       <b>none</b>
           Filtering starts immediately and ends when the last frame is received.

       <b>frame</b>
           The first frames or the very last frame are kept intact during processing.

       <b>black</b>
           Black is padded at the beginning or at the end of filtering.

   <b>tinterlace</b>
       Perform various types of temporal field interlacing.

       Frames are counted starting from 1, so the first input frame is considered odd.

       The filter accepts the following options:

       <b>mode</b>
           Specify the mode of the interlacing. This option can also be specified as a value  alone.  See  below
           for a list of values for this option.

           Available values are:

           <b>merge,</b> <b>0</b>
               Move odd frames into the upper field, even into the lower field, generating a double height frame
               at half frame rate.

           Numeric values are deprecated but are accepted for backward compatibility reasons.

           Default mode is "merge".

       <b>flags</b>
           Specify flags influencing the filter process.

           Available value for <u>flags</u> is:

           <b>low_pass_filter,</b> <b>vlpf</b>
               Enable linear vertical low-pass filtering in the filter.  Vertical low-pass filtering is required
               when  creating  an interlaced destination from a progressive source which contains high-frequency
               vertical detail. Filtering will reduce interlace 'twitter' and Moire patterning.

           <b>complex_filter,</b> <b>cvlpf</b>
               Enable complex vertical low-pass filtering.  This will slightly less reduce  interlace  'twitter'
               and Moire patterning but better retain detail and subjective sharpness impression.

           <b>bypass_il</b>
               Bypass already interlaced frames, only adjust the frame rate.

           Vertical  low-pass  filtering  and  bypassing  already interlaced frames can only be enabled for <b>mode</b>
           <u>interleave_top</u> and <u>interleave_bottom</u>.

   <b>tmedian</b>
       Pick median pixels from several successive input video frames.

       The filter accepts the following options:

       <b>radius</b>
           Set radius of median filter.  Default is 1. Allowed range is from 1 to 127.

       <b>planes</b>
           Set which planes to filter. Default value is 15, by which all planes are processed.

       <b>percentile</b>
           Set median percentile. Default value is 0.5.  Default value of 0.5 will pick  always  median  values,
           while 0 will pick minimum values, and 1 maximum values.

       <u>Commands</u>

       This filter supports all above options as <b>commands</b>, excluding option "radius".

   <b>tmidequalizer</b>
       Apply Temporal Midway Video Equalization effect.

       Midway  Video  Equalization  adjusts  a  sequence  of  video  frames  to  have the same histograms, while
       maintaining their dynamics as much as possible. It's useful for e.g.  matching  exposures  from  a  video
       frames sequence.

       This filter accepts the following option:

       <b>radius</b>
           Set filtering radius. Default is 5. Allowed range is from 1 to 127.

       <b>sigma</b>
           Set  filtering  sigma. Default is 0.5. This controls strength of filtering.  Setting this option to 0
           effectively does nothing.

       <b>planes</b>
           Set which planes to process. Default is 15, which is all available planes.

   <b>tmix</b>
       Mix successive video frames.

       A description of the accepted options follows.

       <b>frames</b>
           The number of successive frames to mix. If unspecified, it defaults to 3.

       <b>weights</b>
           Specify weight of each input video frame.  Each weight is separated by space. If number of weights is
           smaller than number of <u>frames</u> last specified weight will be used for all remaining unset weights.

       <b>scale</b>
           Specify scale, if it is set it will be multiplied with sum  of  each  weight  multiplied  with  pixel
           values to give final destination pixel value. By default <u>scale</u> is auto scaled to sum of weights.

       <b>planes</b>
           Set which planes to filter. Default is all. Allowed range is from 0 to 15.

       <u>Examples</u>

       •   Average 7 successive frames:

                   tmix=frames=7:weights="1 1 1 1 1 1 1"

       •   Apply simple temporal convolution:

                   tmix=frames=3:weights="-1 3 -1"

       •   Similar as above but only showing temporal differences:

                   tmix=frames=3:weights="-1 2 -1":scale=1

       <u>Commands</u>

       This filter supports the following commands:

       <b>weights</b>
       <b>scale</b>
       <b>planes</b>
           Syntax is same as option with same name.

   <b>tonemap</b>
       Tone map colors from different dynamic ranges.

       This  filter  expects data in single precision floating point, as it needs to operate on (and can output)
       out-of-range values. Another filter, such as <b>zscale</b>, is needed to convert the resulting frame to a usable
       format.

       The tonemapping algorithms implemented only work on linear light, so  input  data  should  be  linearized
       beforehand (and possibly correctly tagged).

               ffmpeg -i INPUT -vf zscale=transfer=linear,tonemap=clip,zscale=transfer=bt709,format=yuv420p OUTPUT

       <u>Options</u>

       The filter accepts the following options.

       <b>tonemap</b>
           Set the tone map algorithm to use.

           Possible values are:

           <u>none</u>
               Do not apply any tone map, only desaturate overbright pixels.

           <u>clip</u>
               Hard-clip  any  out-of-range values. Use it for perfect color accuracy for in-range values, while
               distorting out-of-range values.

           <u>linear</u>
               Stretch the entire reference gamut to a linear multiple of the display.

           <u>gamma</u>
               Fit a logarithmic transfer between the tone curves.

           <u>reinhard</u>
               Preserve overall image brightness with a simple curve, using nonlinear contrast, which results in
               flattening details and degrading color accuracy.

           <u>hable</u>
               Preserve both dark and bright details better than <u>reinhard</u>, at the  cost  of  slightly  darkening
               everything. Use it when detail preservation is more important than color and brightness accuracy.

           <u>mobius</u>
               Smoothly  map  out-of-range  values, while retaining contrast and colors for in-range material as
               much as possible. Use it when color accuracy is more important than detail preservation.

           Default is none.

       <b>param</b>
           Tune the tone mapping algorithm.

           This affects the following algorithms:

           <u>none</u>
               Ignored.

           <u>linear</u>
               Specifies the scale factor to use while stretching.  Default to 1.0.

           <u>gamma</u>
               Specifies the exponent of the function.  Default to 1.8.

           <u>clip</u>
               Specify an extra linear coefficient to multiply into the signal before clipping.  Default to 1.0.

           <u>reinhard</u>
               Specify the local contrast coefficient at the display peak.  Default to 0.5, which means that in-
               gamut values will be about half as bright as when clipping.

           <u>hable</u>
               Ignored.

           <u>mobius</u>
               Specify the transition point from linear to mobius transform. Every value  below  this  point  is
               guaranteed  to  be mapped 1:1. The higher the value, the more accurate the result will be, at the
               cost of losing bright details.  Default to 0.3, which  due  to  the  steep  initial  slope  still
               preserves in-range colors fairly accurately.

       <b>desat</b>
           Apply desaturation for highlights that exceed this level of brightness. The higher the parameter, the
           more color information will be preserved. This setting helps prevent unnaturally blown-out colors for
           super-highlights,  by  (smoothly) turning into white instead. This makes images feel more natural, at
           the cost of reducing information about out-of-range colors.

           The default of 2.0 is somewhat conservative and will mostly just apply to skies  or  directly  sunlit
           surfaces. A setting of 0.0 disables this option.

           This option works only if the input frame has a supported color tag.

       <b>peak</b>
           Override  signal/nominal/reference peak with this value. Useful when the embedded peak information in
           display metadata is not reliable or when tone mapping from a lower range to a higher range.

   <b>tpad</b>
       Temporarily pad video frames.

       The filter accepts the following options:

       <b>start</b>
           Specify number of delay frames before input video stream. Default is 0.

       <b>stop</b>
           Specify number of padding frames after input video stream.  Set to -1 to pad indefinitely. Default is
           0.

       <b>start_mode</b>
           Set kind of frames added to beginning of stream.  Can be either <u>add</u> or <u>clone</u>.   With  <u>add</u>  frames  of
           solid-color are added.  With <u>clone</u> frames are clones of first frame.  Default is <u>add</u>.

       <b>stop_mode</b>
           Set  kind  of  frames added to end of stream.  Can be either <u>add</u> or <u>clone</u>.  With <u>add</u> frames of solid-
           color are added.  With <u>clone</u> frames are clones of last frame.  Default is <u>add</u>.

       <b>start_duration,</b> <b>stop_duration</b>
           Specify the duration of the start/stop delay. See <b>the</b> <b>Time</b> <b>duration</b> <b>section</b>  <b>in</b>  <b>the</b>  <b><a href="../man1/ffmpeg-utils.1.html">ffmpeg-utils</a>(1)</b>
           <b>manual</b> for the accepted syntax.  These options override <u>start</u> and <u>stop</u>. Default is 0.

       <b>color</b>
           Specify the color of the padded area. For the syntax of this option, check the <b>"Color"</b> <b>section</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b>
           <b>ffmpeg-utils</b> <b>manual</b>.

           The default value of <u>color</u> is "black".

   <b>transpose</b>
       Transpose rows with columns in the input video and optionally flip it.

       It accepts the following parameters:

       <b>dir</b> Specify the transposition direction.

           Can assume the following values:

           <b>0,</b> <b>4,</b> <b>cclock_flip</b>
               Rotate by 90 degrees counterclockwise and vertically flip (default), that is:

                       L.R     L.l
                       . . -&gt;  . .
                       l.r     R.r

           <b>1,</b> <b>5,</b> <b>clock</b>

                       . . -&gt;  . .
                       l.r     r.R

           <b>2,</b> <b>6,</b> <b>cclock</b>
               Rotate by 90 degrees counterclockwise, that is:

                       L.R     R.r

           <b>3,</b> <b>7,</b> <b>clock_flip</b>
               Rotate by 90 degrees clockwise and vertically flip, that is:

                       L.R     r.R
                       . . -&gt;  . .
                       l.r     l.L

           For  values  between  4-7, the transposition is only done if the input video geometry is portrait and
           not landscape. These values are deprecated, the "passthrough" option should be used instead.

           Numerical values are deprecated, and should be dropped in favor of symbolic constants.

       <b>passthrough</b>
           Do not apply the transposition if the input geometry matches  the  one  specified  by  the  specified
           value. It accepts the following values:

           <b>none</b>
               Always apply transposition.

           <b>portrait</b>
               Preserve portrait geometry (when <u>height</u> &gt;= <u>width</u>).

           <b>landscape</b>
               Preserve landscape geometry (when <u>width</u> &gt;= <u>height</u>).

           Default value is "none".

       For example to rotate by 90 degrees clockwise and preserve portrait layout:

               transpose=dir=1:passthrough=portrait

       The command above can also be specified as:

               transpose=1:portrait

   <b>transpose_npp</b>
       Transpose  rows  with  columns in the input video and optionally flip it.  For more in depth examples see
       the <b>transpose</b> video filter, which shares mostly the same options.

       It accepts the following parameters:

       <b>dir</b> Specify the transposition direction.

           Can assume the following values:

           <b>cclock_flip</b>
               Rotate by 90 degrees counterclockwise and vertically flip. (default)

           <b>clock</b>
               Rotate by 90 degrees clockwise.

           <b>cclock</b>
               Rotate by 90 degrees counterclockwise.

           <b>clock_flip</b>
               Rotate by 90 degrees clockwise and vertically flip.

       <b>passthrough</b>
           Do not apply the transposition if the input geometry matches  the  one  specified  by  the  specified
           value. It accepts the following values:

           <b>none</b>
               Always apply transposition. (default)

           <b>portrait</b>
               Preserve portrait geometry (when <u>height</u> &gt;= <u>width</u>).

           <b>landscape</b>
               Preserve landscape geometry (when <u>width</u> &gt;= <u>height</u>).

   <b>trim</b>
       Trim the input so that the output contains one continuous subpart of the input.

       It accepts the following parameters:

       <b>start</b>
           Specify  the  time  of the start of the kept section, i.e. the frame with the timestamp <u>start</u> will be
           the first frame in the output.

       <b>end</b> Specify the time of the first frame that will be dropped, i.e. the frame  immediately  preceding  the
           one with the timestamp <u>end</u> will be the last frame in the output.

       <b>start_pts</b>
           This  is  the same as <u>start</u>, except this option sets the start timestamp in timebase units instead of
           seconds.

       <b>end_pts</b>
           This is the same as <u>end</u>, except this option sets the end  timestamp  in  timebase  units  instead  of
           seconds.

       <b>duration</b>
           The maximum duration of the output in seconds.

       <b>start_frame</b>
           The number of the first frame that should be passed to the output.

       <b>end_frame</b>
           The number of the first frame that should be dropped.

       <b>start</b>,  <b>end</b>, and <b>duration</b> are expressed as time duration specifications; see <b>the</b> <b>Time</b> <b>duration</b> <b>section</b> <b>in</b>
       <b>the</b> <b><a href="../man1/ffmpeg-utils.1.html">ffmpeg-utils</a>(1)</b> <b>manual</b> for the accepted syntax.

       Note that the first two sets of the  start/end  options  and  the  <b>duration</b>  option  look  at  the  frame
       timestamp, while the _frame variants simply count the frames that pass through the filter. Also note that
       this  filter  does  not  modify  the  timestamps. If you wish for the output timestamps to start at zero,
       insert a setpts filter after the trim filter.

       If multiple start or end options are set, this filter tries to be greedy and keep  all  the  frames  that
       match  at  least one of the specified constraints. To keep only the part that matches all the constraints
       at once, chain multiple trim filters.

       The defaults are such that all the input is kept. So it is possible to set e.g.  just the end  values  to
       keep everything before the specified time.

       Examples:

       •   Drop everything except the second minute of input:

                   ffmpeg -i INPUT -vf trim=60:120

       •   Keep only the first second:

                   ffmpeg -i INPUT -vf trim=duration=1

   <b>unpremultiply</b>
       Apply alpha unpremultiply effect to input video stream using first plane of second stream as alpha.

       Both streams must have same dimensions and same pixel format.

       The filter accepts the following option:

       <b>planes</b>
           Set  which  planes  will  be processed, unprocessed planes will be copied.  By default value 0xf, all
           planes will be processed.

           If the format has 1 or 2 components, then luma is bit 0.  If the format has 3 or  4  components:  for
           RGB  formats  bit 0 is green, bit 1 is blue and bit 2 is red; for YUV formats bit 0 is luma, bit 1 is
           chroma-U and bit 2 is chroma-V.  If present, the alpha channel is always the last bit.

       <b>inplace</b>
           Do not require 2nd input for processing, instead use alpha plane from input stream.

   <b>unsharp</b>
       Sharpen or blur the input video.

       It accepts the following parameters:

       <b>luma_msize_x,</b> <b>lx</b>
           Set the luma matrix horizontal size. It must be an odd integer between 3 and 23. The default value is
           5.

       <b>luma_msize_y,</b> <b>ly</b>
           Set the luma matrix vertical size. It must be an odd integer between 3 and 23. The default  value  is
           5.

       <b>luma_amount,</b> <b>la</b>
           Set  the luma effect strength. It must be a floating point number, reasonable values lay between -1.5
           and 1.5.

           Negative values will blur the input video, while positive values will sharpen it,  a  value  of  zero
           will disable the effect.

           Default value is 1.0.

       <b>chroma_msize_x,</b> <b>cx</b>
           Set  the chroma matrix horizontal size. It must be an odd integer between 3 and 23. The default value
           is 5.

       <b>chroma_msize_y,</b> <b>cy</b>
           Set the chroma matrix vertical size. It must be an odd integer between 3 and 23. The default value is
           5.

       <b>chroma_amount,</b> <b>ca</b>
           Set the chroma effect strength. It must be a floating point number,  reasonable  values  lay  between
           -1.5 and 1.5.

           Negative  values  will  blur  the input video, while positive values will sharpen it, a value of zero
           will disable the effect.

           Default value is 0.0.

       <b>alpha_msize_x,</b> <b>ax</b>
           Set the alpha matrix horizontal size. It must be an odd integer between 3 and 23. The  default  value
           is 5.

       <b>alpha_msize_y,</b> <b>ay</b>
           Set  the alpha matrix vertical size. It must be an odd integer between 3 and 23. The default value is
           5.

       <b>alpha_amount,</b> <b>aa</b>
           Set the alpha effect strength. It must be a floating point number, reasonable values lay between -1.5
           and 1.5.

           Negative values will blur the input video, while positive values will sharpen it,  a  value  of  zero
           will disable the effect.

           Default value is 0.0.

       All parameters are optional and default to the equivalent of the string '5:5:1.0:5:5:0.0'.

       <u>Examples</u>

       •   Apply strong luma sharpen effect:

                   unsharp=luma_msize_x=7:luma_msize_y=7:luma_amount=2.5

       •   Apply a strong blur of both luma and chroma parameters:

                   unsharp=7:7:-2:7:7:-2

   <b>untile</b>
       Decompose a video made of tiled images into the individual images.

       The  frame  rate  of  the  output  video is the frame rate of the input video multiplied by the number of
       tiles.

       This filter does the reverse of <b>tile</b>.

       The filter accepts the following options:

       <b>layout</b>
           Set the grid size (i.e. the number of lines and columns). For the syntax of this  option,  check  the
           <b>"Video</b> <b>size"</b> <b>section</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ffmpeg-utils</b> <b>manual</b>.

       <u>Examples</u>

       •   Produce  a  1-second  video  from  a  still  image file made of 25 frames stacked vertically, like an
           analogic film reel:

                   ffmpeg -r 1 -i image.jpg -vf untile=1x25 movie.mkv

   <b>uspp</b>
       Apply ultra slow/simple postprocessing filter that compresses and decompresses the image at several (or -
       in the case of <b>quality</b> level 8 - all) shifts and average the results.

       The way this differs from the behavior of spp is that uspp actually encodes  &amp;  decodes  each  case  with
       libavcodec Snow, whereas spp uses a simplified intra only 8x8 DCT similar to MJPEG.

       This filter is not available in ffmpeg versions between 5.0 and 6.0.

       The filter accepts the following options:

       <b>quality</b>
           Set  quality.  This  option  defines the number of levels for averaging. It accepts an integer in the
           range 0-8. If set to 0, the filter will have no effect. A value of 8 means the  higher  quality.  For
           each increment of that value the speed drops by a factor of approximately 2.  Default value is 3.

       <b>qp</b>  Force a constant quantization parameter. If not set, the filter will use the QP from the video stream
           (if available).

       <b>codec</b>
           Use specified codec instead of snow.

   <b>v360</b>
       Convert 360 videos between various formats.

       The filter accepts the following options:

       <u>Examples</u>

       •   Convert equirectangular video to cubemap with 3x2 layout and 1% padding using bicubic interpolation:

                   ffmpeg -i input.mkv -vf v360=e:c3x2:cubic:out_pad=0.01 output.mkv

       •   Extract back view of Equi-Angular Cubemap:

                   ffmpeg -i input.mkv -vf v360=eac:flat:yaw=180 output.mkv

       •   Convert transposed and horizontally flipped Equi-Angular Cubemap in  side-by-side  stereo  format  to
           equirectangular top-bottom stereo format:

                   v360=eac:equirect:in_stereo=sbs:in_trans=1:ih_flip=1:out_stereo=tb

       <u>Commands</u>

       This filter supports subset of above options as <b>commands</b>.

   <b>vaguedenoiser</b>
       Apply a wavelet based denoiser.

       It  transforms  each  frame from the video input into the wavelet domain, using Cohen-Daubechies-Feauveau
       9/7. Then it applies some filtering to the obtained coefficients. It does an  inverse  wavelet  transform
       after.   Due  to  wavelet  properties,  it should give a nice smoothed result, and reduced noise, without
       blurring picture features.

       This filter accepts the following options:

       <b>threshold</b>
           The filtering strength. The higher, the more filtered the video will be.  Hard thresholding can use a
           higher threshold than soft thresholding before the video looks overfiltered. Default value is 2.

       <b>method</b>
           The filtering method the filter will use.

           It accepts the following values:

           <b>hard</b>
               All values under the threshold will be zeroed.

           <b>soft</b>
               All values under the threshold will be zeroed. All values above will be reduced by the threshold.

           <b>garrote</b>
               Scales or nullifies coefficients - intermediary between (more) soft and (less) hard thresholding.

           Default is garrote.

       <b>nsteps</b>
           Number of times, the wavelet will decompose  the  picture.  Picture  can't  be  decomposed  beyond  a
           particular  point  (typically, 8 for a 640x480 frame - as 2^9 = 512 &gt; 480). Valid values are integers
           between 1 and 32. Default value is 6.

       <b>percent</b>
           Partial of full denoising (limited coefficients shrinking), from 0 to 100. Default value is 85.

       <b>planes</b>
           A list of the planes to process. By default all planes are processed.

       <b>type</b>
           The threshold type the filter will use.

           It accepts the following values:

           <b>universal</b>
               Threshold used is same for all decompositions.

           <b>bayes</b>
               Threshold used depends also on each decomposition coefficients.

           Default is universal.

   <b>varblur</b>
       Apply variable blur filter by using 2nd video stream to set blur radius.  The 2nd stream  must  have  the
       same dimensions.

       This filter accepts the following options:

       <b>min_r</b>
           Set min allowed radius. Allowed range is from 0 to 254. Default is 0.

       <b>max_r</b>
           Set max allowed radius. Allowed range is from 1 to 255. Default is 8.

       <b>planes</b>
           Set which planes to process. By default, all are used.

       The "varblur" filter also supports the <b>framesync</b> options.

       <u>Commands</u>

       This filter supports all the above options as <b>commands</b>.

   <b>vectorscope</b>
       Display 2 color component values in the two dimensional graph (which is called a vectorscope).

       This filter accepts the following options:

       <b>mode,</b> <b>m</b>
           Set vectorscope mode.

           It accepts the following values:

           <b>gray</b>
           <b>tint</b>
               Gray values are displayed on graph, higher brightness means more pixels have same component color
               value on location in graph. This is the default mode.

           <b>color</b>
               Gray  values  are  displayed  on  graph. Surrounding pixels values which are not present in video
               frame are drawn in gradient of 2 color components which are set by option "x" and  "y".  The  3rd
               color component is static.

           <b>color2</b>
               Actual color components values present in video frame are displayed on graph.

           <b>color3</b>
               Similar  as  color2  but  higher frequency of same values "x" and "y" on graph increases value of
               another color component, which is luminance by default values of "x" and "y".

           <b>color4</b>
               Actual colors present in video frame are displayed on graph. If two different colors map to  same
               position on graph then color with higher value of component not present in graph is picked.

           <b>color5</b>
               Gray  values  are displayed on graph. Similar to "color" but with 3rd color component picked from
               radial gradient.

       <b>x</b>   Set which color component will be represented on X-axis. Default is 1.

       <b>y</b>   Set which color component will be represented on Y-axis. Default is 2.

       <b>intensity,</b> <b>i</b>
           Set intensity, used by modes: gray, color, color3 and  color5  for  increasing  brightness  of  color
           component which represents frequency of (X, Y) location in graph.

       <b>envelope,</b> <b>e</b>
           <b>none</b>
               No envelope, this is default.

           <b>instant</b>
               Instant envelope, even darkest single pixel will be clearly highlighted.

           <b>peak</b>
               Hold  maximum and minimum values presented in graph over time. This way you can still spot out of
               range values without constantly looking at vectorscope.

           <b>peak+instant</b>
               Peak and instant envelope combined together.

       <b>graticule,</b> <b>g</b>
           Set what kind of graticule to draw.

           <b>none</b>
           <b>green</b>
           <b>color</b>
           <b>invert</b>
       <b>opacity,</b> <b>o</b>
           Set graticule opacity.

       <b>flags,</b> <b>f</b>
           Set graticule flags.

           <b>white</b>
               Draw graticule for white point.

           <b>black</b>
               Draw graticule for black point.

           <b>name</b>
               Draw color points short names.

       <b>bgopacity,</b> <b>b</b>
           Set background opacity.

       <b>lthreshold,</b> <b>l</b>
           Set low threshold for color component not represented on X or Y axis.  Values lower than  this  value
           will  be  ignored.  Default  is  0.  Note this value is multiplied with actual max possible value one
           pixel component can have. So for 8-bit input and low threshold value of 0.1 actual threshold is 0.1 *
           255 = 25.

       <b>hthreshold,</b> <b>h</b>
           Set high threshold for color component not represented on X or Y axis.  Values higher than this value
           will be ignored. Default is 1.  Note this value is multiplied with  actual  max  possible  value  one
           pixel  component can have. So for 8-bit input and high threshold value of 0.9 actual threshold is 0.9
           * 255 = 230.

       <b>colorspace,</b> <b>c</b>
           Set what kind of colorspace to use when drawing graticule.

           <b>auto</b>
           <b>601</b>
           <b>709</b>

           Default is auto.

       <b>tint0,</b> <b>t0</b>
       <b>tint1,</b> <b>t1</b>
           Set color tint for gray/tint vectorscope mode. By default both options are zero.  This means no tint,
           and output will remain gray.

   <b>vidstabdetect</b>
       Analyze video stabilization/deshaking. Perform pass 1 of 2, see <b>vidstabtransform</b> for pass 2.

       This filter generates  a  file  with  relative  translation  and  rotation  transform  information  about
       subsequent frames, which is then used by the <b>vidstabtransform</b> filter.

       To enable compilation of this filter you need to configure FFmpeg with "--enable-libvidstab".

       This filter accepts the following options:

       <b>result</b>
           Set the path to the file used to write the transforms information.  Default value is <u>transforms.trf</u>.

       <b>shakiness</b>
           Set  how  shaky  the video is and how quick the camera is. It accepts an integer in the range 1-10, a
           value of 1 means little shakiness, a value of 10 means strong shakiness. Default value is 5.

       <b>accuracy</b>
           Set the accuracy of the detection process. It must be a value in the range 1-15. A value of  1  means
           low accuracy, a value of 15 means high accuracy. Default value is 15.

       <b>stepsize</b>
           Set  stepsize  of  the  search process. The region around minimum is scanned with 1 pixel resolution.
           Default value is 6.

       <b>mincontrast</b>
           Set minimum contrast. Below this value a local measurement field is discarded.  Must  be  a  floating
           point value in the range 0-1. Default value is 0.3.

       <b>tripod</b>
           Set reference frame number for tripod mode.

           If  enabled,  the  motion  of  the  frames  is  compared to a reference frame in the filtered stream,
           identified by the specified number. The idea is to compensate all movements in a more-or-less  static
           scene and keep the camera view absolutely still.

           If set to 0, it is disabled. The frames are counted starting from 1.

       <b>show</b>
           Show  fields  and transforms in the resulting frames. It accepts an integer in the range 0-2. Default
           value is 0, which disables any visualization.

       <b>fileformat</b>
           Format for the transforms data file to be written.  Acceptable values are

           <b>ascii</b>
               Human-readable plain text

           <b>binary</b>
               Binary format, roughly 40% smaller than "ascii". (<u>default</u>)

       <u>Examples</u>

       •   Use default values:

                   vidstabdetect

       •   Analyze strongly shaky movie and put the results in file <u>mytransforms.trf</u>:

                   vidstabdetect=shakiness=10:accuracy=15:result="mytransforms.trf"

       •   Visualize the result of internal transformations in the resulting video:

                   vidstabdetect=show=1

       •   Analyze a video with medium shakiness using <b>ffmpeg</b>:

                   ffmpeg -i input -vf vidstabdetect=shakiness=5:show=1 dummy.avi

   <b>vidstabtransform</b>
       Video stabilization/deshaking: pass 2 of 2, see <b>vidstabdetect</b> for pass 1.

       Read a file with transform information for each  frame  and  apply/compensate  them.  Together  with  the
       <b>vidstabdetect</b>  filter  this can be used to deshake videos. See also &lt;<b><a href="http://public.hronopik.de/vid.stab">http://public.hronopik.de/vid.stab</a></b>&gt;.
       It is important to also use the <b>unsharp</b> filter, see below.

       To enable compilation of this filter you need to configure FFmpeg with "--enable-libvidstab".

       <u>Options</u>

       <b>input</b>
           Set path to the file used to read the transforms. Default value is <u>transforms.trf</u>.

       <b>smoothing</b>
           Set the number of frames (value*2 + 1) used for lowpass filtering the camera movements. Default value
           is 10.

           For example a number of 10 means that 21 frames are used (10 in the past and 10  in  the  future)  to
           smoothen  the  motion  in  the  video.  A  larger  value  leads  to  a smoother video, but limits the
           acceleration of the camera (pan/tilt movements). 0 is  a  special  case  where  a  static  camera  is
           simulated.

       <b>optalgo</b>
           Set the camera path optimization algorithm.

           Accepted values are:

           <b>avg</b> averaging on transformations

       <b>maxshift</b>
           Set maximal number of pixels to translate frames. Default value is -1, meaning no limit.

       <b>maxangle</b>

       <b>crop</b>
           Specify how to deal with borders that may be visible due to movement compensation.

           Available values are:

           <b>keep</b>
               keep image information from previous frame (default)

           <b>black</b>
               fill the border black

       <b>invert</b>
           Invert transforms if set to 1. Default value is 0.

       <b>relative</b>
           Consider transforms as relative to previous frame if set to 1, absolute if set to 0. Default value is
           0.

       <b>zoom</b>
           Set percentage to zoom. A positive value will result in a zoom-in effect, a negative value in a zoom-
           out effect. Default value is 0 (no zoom).

       <b>optzoom</b>
           Set optimal zooming to avoid borders.

           Accepted values are:

           <b>0</b>   disabled

           <b>1</b>   optimal static zoom value is determined (only very strong movements will lead to visible borders)
               (default)

           <b>2</b>   optimal adaptive zoom value is determined (no borders will be visible), see <b>zoomspeed</b>

           Note that the value given at zoom is added to the one calculated here.

       <b>zoomspeed</b>
           Set  percent  to  zoom maximally each frame (enabled when <b>optzoom</b> is set to 2). Range is from 0 to 5,
           default value is 0.25.

       <b>interpol</b>
           Specify type of interpolation.

           Available values are:

           <b>no</b>  no interpolation

           <b>linear</b>
               linear only horizontal

           <b>bilinear</b>
               linear in both directions (default)

           <b>bicubic</b>
               cubic in both directions (slow)

       <b>tripod</b>
           Enable virtual tripod mode if set to 1, which  is  equivalent  to  "relative=0:smoothing=0".  Default
           value is 0.

           Use also "tripod" option of <b>vidstabdetect</b>.

       <b>debug</b>
           Increase  log  verbosity  if  set to 1. Also the detected global motions are written to the temporary
           file <u>global_motions.trf</u>. Default value is 0.

       <u>Examples</u>

       •   Use <b>ffmpeg</b> for a typical stabilization with default values:

                   ffmpeg -i inp.mpeg -vf vidstabtransform,unsharp=5:5:0.8:3:3:0.4 inp_stabilized.mpeg

           Note the use of the <b>unsharp</b> filter which is always recommended.

       •   Zoom in a bit more and load transform data from a given file:

                   vidstabtransform=zoom=5:input="mytransforms.trf"

       •   Smoothen the video even more:

                   vidstabtransform=smoothing=30

   <b>vflip</b>
       Flip the input video vertically.

       For example, to vertically flip a video with <b>ffmpeg</b>:

               ffmpeg -i in.avi -vf "vflip" out.avi

   <b>vfrdet</b>
       Detect variable frame rate video.

       This filter tries to detect if the input is variable or constant frame rate.

       At end it will output number of frames detected as having variable delta  pts,  and  ones  with  constant
       delta  pts.   If  there was frames with variable delta, than it will also show min, max and average delta
       encountered.

   <b>vibrance</b>
       Boost or alter saturation.

       The filter accepts the following options:

       <b>intensity</b>
           Set strength of boost if positive value or strength of  alter  if  negative  value.   Default  is  0.
           Allowed range is from -2 to 2.

       <b>gbal</b>
           Set the green balance. Default is 1. Allowed range is from -10 to 10.

       <b>bbal</b>
           Set the blue balance. Default is 1. Allowed range is from -10 to 10.

       <b>rlum</b>
           Set the red luma coefficient.

       <b>glum</b>
           Set the green luma coefficient.

       <b>blum</b>
           Set the blue luma coefficient.

       <b>alternate</b>
           If  "intensity"  is  negative and this is set to 1, colors will change, otherwise colors will be less
           saturated, more towards gray.

       <u>Commands</u>

       This filter supports the all above options as <b>commands</b>.

   <b>vif</b>
       Obtain the average VIF (Visual Information Fidelity) between two input videos.

       This filter takes two input videos.

       Both input videos must have the same resolution and pixel format for this filter to work correctly.  Also
       it assumes that both inputs have the same number of frames, which are compared one by one.

       The obtained average VIF score is printed through the logging system.

       The filter stores the calculated VIF score of each frame.

       This filter also supports the <b>framesync</b> options.

       In the below example the input file <u>main.mpg</u> being processed is compared with the reference file <u>ref.mpg</u>.

               ffmpeg -i main.mpg -i ref.mpg -lavfi vif -f null -

   <b>vignette</b>
       Make or reverse a natural vignetting effect.

       The filter accepts the following options:

       <b>angle,</b> <b>a</b>
           Set lens angle expression as a number of radians.

           The value is clipped in the "[0,PI/2]" range.

           Default value: "PI/5"

       <b>x0</b>
       <b>y0</b>  Set center coordinates expressions. Respectively "w/2" and "h/2" by default.

       <b>mode</b>
           Set forward/backward mode.

           Available modes are:

           <b>forward</b>
               The larger the distance from the central point, the darker the image becomes.

           <b>backward</b>
               The larger the distance from the central point, the brighter the image becomes.  This can be used
               to  reverse  a  vignette effect, though there is no automatic detection to extract the lens <b>angle</b>
               and other settings (yet). It can also be used to create a burning effect.

           Default value is <b>forward</b>.

       <b>eval</b>
           Set evaluation mode for the expressions (<b>angle</b>, <b>x0</b>, <b>y0</b>).

           It accepts the following values:

           <b>init</b>
               Evaluate expressions only once during the filter initialization.

           <b>frame</b>
               Evaluate expressions for each incoming frame. This is way slower than  the  <b>init</b>  mode  since  it
               requires all the scalers to be re-computed, but it allows advanced dynamic expressions.

           Default value is <b>init</b>.

       <b>dither</b>
           Set dithering to reduce the circular banding effects. Default is 1 (enabled).

       <b>aspect</b>
           Set vignette aspect. This setting allows one to adjust the shape of the vignette.  Setting this value
           to the SAR of the input will make a rectangular vignetting following the dimensions of the video.

           Default is "1/1".

       <u>Expressions</u>

       The <b>alpha</b>, <b>x0</b> and <b>y0</b> expressions can contain the following parameters.

       <b>w</b>
       <b>h</b>   input width and height

       <b>n</b>   the number of input frame, starting from 0

       <b>pts</b> the  PTS  (Presentation  TimeStamp)  time  of the filtered video frame, expressed in <u>TB</u> units, NAN if
           undefined

       <b>r</b>   frame rate of the input video, NAN if the input frame rate is unknown

       <b>t</b>   the PTS (Presentation TimeStamp) of the filtered video frame, expressed in seconds, NAN if undefined

       <b>tb</b>  time base of the input video

       <u>Examples</u>

       •   Apply simple strong vignetting effect:

                   vignette=PI/4

       •   Make a flickering vignetting:

                   vignette='PI/4+<a href="../man1/random.1.html">random</a>(1)*PI/50':eval=frame

   <b>vmafmotion</b>
       Obtain the average VMAF motion score of a video.  It is one of the component metrics of VMAF.

       The obtained average motion score is printed through the logging system.

       The filter accepts the following options:

       <b>stats_file</b>
           If specified, the filter will use the named file to save the motion score of each frame with  respect
           to the previous frame.  When filename equals "-" the data is sent to standard output.

       Example:

               ffmpeg -i ref.mpg -vf vmafmotion -f null -

   <b>vstack</b>
       Stack input videos vertically.

       All streams must be of same pixel format and of same width.

       Note that this filter is faster than using <b>overlay</b> and <b>pad</b> filter to create same output.

       The filter accepts the following options:

       <b>inputs</b>
           Set number of input streams. Default is 2.

       <b>shortest</b>
           If set to 1, force the output to terminate when the shortest input terminates. Default value is 0.

   <b>w3fdif</b>
       Deinterlace the input video ("w3fdif" stands for "Weston 3 Field Deinterlacing Filter").

       Based  on  the  process described by Martin Weston for BBC R&amp;D, and implemented based on the de-interlace
       algorithm written by Jim Easterbrook for BBC R&amp;D, the Weston 3 field  deinterlacing  filter  uses  filter
       coefficients calculated by BBC R&amp;D.

       This  filter  uses  field-dominance  information in frame to decide which of each pair of fields to place
       first in the output.  If it gets it wrong use <b>setfield</b> filter before "w3fdif" filter.

       There are two sets of filter coefficients,  so  called  "simple"  and  "complex".  Which  set  of  filter
       coefficients is used can be set by passing an optional parameter:

       <b>filter</b>
           Set the interlacing filter coefficients. Accepts one of the following values:

           <b>simple</b>
               Simple filter coefficient set.

           <b>complex</b>
               More-complex filter coefficient set.

           Default value is <b>complex</b>.

       <b>mode</b>
           The interlacing mode to adopt. It accepts one of the following values:

           <b>frame</b>
               Output one frame for each frame.

           <b>field</b>
               Output one frame for each field.

           The default value is "field".

       <b>parity</b>
           The  picture  field  parity  assumed  for the input interlaced video. It accepts one of the following
           values:

           <b>tff</b> Assume the top field is first.

           <b>bff</b> Assume the bottom field is first.

           <b>auto</b>
               Enable automatic detection of field parity.

           The default value is "auto".  If the interlacing is unknown or  the  decoder  does  not  export  this
           information, top field first will be assumed.

       <b>deint</b>
           Specify which frames to deinterlace. Accepts one of the following values:

           <b>all</b> Deinterlace all frames,

           <b>interlaced</b>
               Only deinterlace frames marked as interlaced.

           Default value is <b>all</b>.

       <u>Commands</u>

       This filter supports same <b>commands</b> as options.

   <b>waveform</b>
       Video waveform monitor.

       The  waveform  monitor plots color component intensity. By default luma only. Each column of the waveform
       corresponds to a column of pixels in the source video.

       It accepts the following options:

       <b>mode,</b> <b>m</b>
           Can be either "row", or "column". Default is "column".  In row mode,  the  graph  on  the  left  side
           represents color component value 0 and the right side represents value = 255. In column mode, the top
           side represents color component value = 0 and bottom side represents value = 255.

       <b>intensity,</b> <b>i</b>
           Set  intensity.  Smaller  values  are  useful  to  find out how many values of the same luminance are
           distributed across input rows/columns.  Default value is 0.04. Allowed range is [0, 1].

       <b>mirror,</b> <b>r</b>
           Set mirroring mode. 0 means unmirrored, 1 means mirrored.  In mirrored mode, higher  values  will  be
           represented  on  the  left  side  for  "row"  mode  and  at  the  top for "column" mode. Default is 1
           (mirrored).

       <b>display,</b> <b>d</b>
           Set display mode.  It accepts the following values:

           <b>overlay</b>
               Presents information identical to that in the "parade", except that the graphs representing color
               components are superimposed directly over one another.

               This display mode makes it easier to spot relative differences  or  similarities  in  overlapping
               areas  of  the color components that are supposed to be identical, such as neutral whites, grays,
               or blacks.

           <b>stack</b>
               Display separate graph for the color components side by side in "row" mode or one below the other
               in "column" mode.

           <b>parade</b>
               Display separate graph for the color components side by side in "column" mode or  one  below  the
               other in "row" mode.

               Using  this  display  mode  makes it easy to spot color casts in the highlights and shadows of an
               image, by comparing the contours of the top and the bottom graphs of each waveform. Since whites,
               grays, and blacks are characterized by exactly equal amounts of red,  green,  and  blue,  neutral
               areas  of  the  picture should display three waveforms of roughly equal width/height. If not, the
               correction is easy to perform by making level adjustments the three waveforms.

           Default is "stack".

       <b>components,</b> <b>c</b>
           Set which color components to display. Default is 1, which means only luma or red color component  if
           input  is  in  RGB  colorspace. If is set for example to 7 it will display all 3 (if) available color
           components.

       <b>envelope,</b> <b>e</b>
           <b>none</b>
               No envelope, this is default.

           <b>instant</b>
               Instant envelope, minimum and maximum values presented in graph will be easily visible even  with
               small "step" value.

           <b>peak</b>
               Hold  minimum  and maximum values presented in graph across time. This way you can still spot out
               of range values without constantly looking at waveforms.

           <b>peak+instant</b>
               Peak and instant envelope combined together.

       <b>filter,</b> <b>f</b>
           <b>lowpass</b>
               No filtering, this is default.

           <b>flat</b>
               Luma and chroma combined together.

           <b>aflat</b>
               Similar as above, but shows difference between blue and red chroma.

           <b>xflat</b>
               Similar as above, but use different colors.

           <b>yflat</b>
               Similar as above, but again with different colors.

           <b>chroma</b>
               Displays only chroma.

           <b>color</b>
               Displays actual color value on waveform.

           <b>acolor</b>
               Similar as above, but with luma showing frequency of chroma values.

       <b>graticule,</b> <b>g</b>
           Set which graticule to display.

           <b>none</b>
               Do not display graticule.

           Set background opacity.

       <b>tint0,</b> <b>t0</b>
       <b>tint1,</b> <b>t1</b>
           Set tint for output.  Only used with lowpass filter and when display is not overlay and  input  pixel
           formats are not RGB.

       <b>fitmode,</b> <b>fm</b>
           Set  sample  aspect  ratio  of  video  output frames.  Can be used to configure waveform so it is not

   <b>weave,</b> <b>doubleweave</b>
       The  "weave"  takes  a  field-based  video  input  and join each two sequential fields into single frame,
       producing a new double height clip with half the frame rate and half the frame count.

       The "doubleweave" works same as "weave" but without halving frame rate and frame count.

       It accepts the following option:

       <b>first_field</b>

       The "xcorrelate" filter also supports the <b>framesync</b> options.

   <b>xfade</b>
       Apply cross fade from one input video stream to another input video stream.  The cross  fade  is  applied
       for specified duration.

       Both  inputs  must  be  constant  frame-rate  and  have the same resolution, pixel format, frame rate and

                   ffmpeg -i first.mp4 -i second.mp4 -filter_complex xfade=transition=fade:duration=2:offset=5 output.mp4

   <b>xmedian</b>
       Pick median pixels from several input videos.

       The filter accepts the following options:

       <b>inputs</b>
           Set  number  of  inputs.   Default is 3. Allowed range is from 3 to 255.  If number of inputs is even
           number, than result will be mean value between two median values.

       <b>planes</b>
           Set which planes to filter. Default value is 15, by which all planes are processed.

       <b>percentile</b>
           Set median percentile. Default value is 0.5.  Default value of 0.5 will pick  always  median  values,
           while 0 will pick minimum values, and 1 maximum values.

       <u>Commands</u>

       This filter supports all above options as <b>commands</b>, excluding option "inputs".

   <b>xpsnr</b>
       Obtain  the  average  (across  all  input  frames) and minimum (across all color plane averages) eXtended
       Perceptually weighted peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (XPSNR) between two input videos.

       The XPSNR is a low-complexity psychovisually motivated distortion measurement algorithm for assessing the
       difference between two video streams or images. This is especially useful for objectively quantifying the
       distortions caused by video and image codecs,  as  an  alternative  to  a  formal  subjective  test.  The
       logarithmic  XPSNR  output  values  are  in  a similar range as those of traditional <b>psnr</b> assessments but
       better reflect human impressions of visual coding quality. More  details  on  the  XPSNR  measure,  which
       essentially  represents  a  blockwise weighted variant of the PSNR measure, can be found in the following
       freely available papers:

       When publishing the results of XPSNR assessments obtained using, e.g., this FFmpeg filter, a reference to
       the  above  papers  as  a  means  of  documentation is strongly encouraged. The filter requires two input
       videos. The first input is considered a (usually not distorted) reference source and is passed  unchanged
       to the output, whereas the second input is a (distorted) test signal. Except for the bit depth, these two
       video  inputs  must  have  the  same pixel format. In addition, for best performance, both compared input
       videos should be in YCbCr color format.

       The obtained overall XPSNR values mentioned above are printed through the  logging  system.  In  case  of
       input with multiple color planes, we suggest reporting of the minimum XPSNR average.

       The following parameter, which behaves like the one for the <b>psnr</b> filter, is accepted:

       <b>stats_file,</b> <b>f</b>
           If specified, the filter will use the named file to save the XPSNR value of each individual frame and
           color plane. When the file name equals "-", that data is sent to standard output.

       This filter also supports the <b>framesync</b> options.

       <u>Examples</u>

   <b>xstack</b>
       Stack video inputs into custom layout.

       All streams must be of same pixel format.

       The filter accepts the following options:

       <b>inputs</b>
           Set number of input streams. Default is 2.

       <b>layout</b>
           Specify layout of inputs.  This option requires the desired layout configuration to be explicitly set
           by  the user.  This sets position of each video input in output. Each input is separated by '|'.  The
           first number represents the column, and the second number represents the row.  Numbers start at 0 and
           are separated by '_'. Optionally one can use wX and hX, where X is video input  from  which  to  take
           width  or  height.  Multiple values can be used when separated by '+'. In such case values are summed
           together.

           Note that if inputs are of different sizes gaps may appear, as not all of the output video frame will
           be filled. Similarly, videos can overlap each other if their position doesn't leave enough space  for
           the full frame of adjoining videos.

           For 2 inputs, a default layout of "0_0|w0_0" (equivalent to "grid=2x1") is set. In all other cases, a
           layout  or  a  grid  must  be  set by the user. Either "grid" or "layout" can be specified at a time.
           Specifying both will result in an error.

       <b>grid</b>
           Specify a fixed size grid of inputs.  This option is used to create a fixed size grid  of  the  input
           streams.  Set  the grid size in the form "COLUMNSxROWS". There must be "ROWS * COLUMNS" input streams
           and they will be arranged as a grid with "ROWS" rows and "COLUMNS" columns. When using  this  option,
           each input stream within a row must have the same height and all the rows must have the same width.

           If "grid" is set, then "inputs" option is ignored and is implicitly set to "ROWS * COLUMNS".

           For 2 inputs, a default grid of "2x1" (equivalent to "layout=0_0|w0_0") is set. In all other cases, a
           layout  or  a  grid  must  be  set by the user. Either "grid" or "layout" can be specified at a time.
           Specifying both will result in an error.

       <b>shortest</b>
           If set to 1, force the output to terminate when the shortest input terminates. Default value is 0.

       <b>fill</b>
           If set to valid color, all unused pixels will be filled with that color.  By default fill is  set  to
           none, so it is disabled.

       <u>Examples</u>

       •   Zoom in up to 1.5x and pan at same time to some spot near center of picture:

                   zoompan=z='min(zoom+0.0015,1.5)':d=700:x='if(gte(zoom,1.5),x,x+1/a)':y='if(gte(zoom,1.5),y,y+1)':s=640x360

       •   Zoom in up to 1.5x and pan always at center of picture:

                   zoompan=z='min(zoom+0.0015,1.5)':d=700:x='iw/2-(iw/zoom/2)':y='ih/2-(ih/zoom/2)'

       •   Same as above but without pausing:

                   zoompan=z='min(max(zoom,pzoom)+0.0015,1.5)':d=1:x='iw/2-(iw/zoom/2)':y='ih/2-(ih/zoom/2)'

       •   Zoom in 2x into center of picture only for the first second of the input video:

                   zoompan=z='if(between(in_time,0,1),2,1)':d=1:x='iw/2-(iw/zoom/2)':y='ih/2-(ih/zoom/2)'

   <b>zscale</b>
       Scale  (resize) the input video, using the z.lib library: &lt;<b>https://github.com/sekrit-twc/zimg</b>&gt;. To enable
       compilation of this filter, you need to configure FFmpeg with "--enable-libzimg".

       The zscale filter forces the output display aspect ratio to be the same as the  input,  by  changing  the
       output sample aspect ratio.

       If  the  input  image format is different from the format requested by the next filter, the zscale filter
       will convert the input to the requested format.

       <u>Options</u>

       The filter accepts the following options.

       <b>width,</b> <b>w</b>
       <b>height,</b> <b>h</b>
           Set the output video dimension expression. Default value is the input dimension.

           If the <u>width</u> or <u>w</u> value is 0, the input width is used for the output. If the <u>height</u> or <u>h</u> value is  0,
           the input height is used for the output.

           If  one  and  only  one  of  the  values  is  -n with n &gt;= 1, the zscale filter will use a value that
           maintains the aspect ratio of the input image, calculated from the other specified  dimension.  After
           that it will, however, make sure that the calculated dimension is divisible by n and adjust the value
           if necessary.

           If  both  values  are -n with n &gt;= 1, the behavior will be identical to both values being set to 0 as
           previously detailed.

           See below for the list of accepted constants for use in the dimension expression.

       <b>size,</b> <b>s</b>

</pre><h4><b>OPENCL</b> <b>VIDEO</b> <b>FILTERS</b></h4><pre>
       Below is a description of the currently available OpenCL video filters.

       To enable compilation of these filters you need to configure FFmpeg with "--enable-opencl".

       Running OpenCL filters requires you to initialize a hardware device  and  to  pass  that  device  to  all
       filters in any filter graph.

       <b>-init_hw_device</b> <b>opencl[=</b><u>name</u><b>][:</b><u>device</u><b>[,</b><u>key=value</u><b>...]]</b>
           Initialise a new hardware device of type <u>opencl</u> called <u>name</u>, using the given device parameters.

       <b>-filter_hw_device</b> <u>name</u>
           Pass the hardware device called <u>name</u> to all filters in any filter graph.

       For more detailed information see &lt;<b>https://www.ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg.html#Advanced-Video-options</b>&gt;

       •   Example  of  choosing  the first device on the second platform and running avgblur_opencl filter with
           default parameters on it.

                   -init_hw_device opencl=gpu:1.0 -filter_hw_device gpu -i INPUT -vf "hwupload, avgblur_opencl, hwdownload" OUTPUT

       Since OpenCL filters are not able to access frame data in normal memory,  all  frame  data  needs  to  be
       uploaded(<b>hwupload</b>)  to  hardware  surfaces connected to the appropriate device before being used and then
       downloaded(<b>hwdownload</b>) back to normal memory. Note that <b>hwupload</b> will upload to a surface with  the  same
       layout as the software frame, so it may be necessary to add a <b>format</b> filter immediately before to get the
       input  into  the  right  format  and  <b>hwdownload</b>  does  not support all formats on the output - it may be
       necessary to insert an additional <b>format</b> filter immediately following in the graph to get the output in a
       supported format.

   <b>avgblur_opencl</b>
       Apply average blur filter.

       The filter accepts the following options:

       <b>sizeX</b>
           Set horizontal radius size.  Range is "[1, 1024]" and default value is 1.

       <b>planes</b>
           Set which planes to filter. Default value is 0xf, by which all planes are processed.

       <b>sizeY</b>
           Set vertical radius size. Range is "[1, 1024]" and default value is 0. If zero, "sizeX" value will be
           used.

       <u>Example</u>

       •   Apply average blur filter with horizontal and vertical size of 3, setting each pixel of the output to
           the average value of the 7x7 region centered on it in the input. For  pixels  on  the  edges  of  the
           image,  the  region  does not extend beyond the image boundaries, and so out-of-range coordinates are
           not used in the calculations.

                   -i INPUT -vf "hwupload, avgblur_opencl=3, hwdownload" OUTPUT

   <b>boxblur_opencl</b>
       Apply a boxblur algorithm to the input video.

       It accepts the following parameters:

       <b>luma_radius,</b> <b>lr</b>
       <b>luma_power,</b> <b>lp</b>
       <b>chroma_radius,</b> <b>cr</b>
       <b>chroma_power,</b> <b>cp</b>
       <b>alpha_radius,</b> <b>ar</b>
       <b>alpha_power,</b> <b>ap</b>

       A description of the accepted options follows.

       <b>luma_radius,</b> <b>lr</b>
       <b>chroma_radius,</b> <b>cr</b>
       <b>alpha_radius,</b> <b>ar</b>
           Set an expression for the box radius in pixels used for blurring the corresponding input plane.

           The radius value must be a non-negative number, and must  not  be  greater  than  the  value  of  the
           expression "min(w,h)/2" for the luma and alpha planes, and of "min(cw,ch)/2" for the chroma planes.

           Default value for <b>luma_radius</b> is "2". If not specified, <b>chroma_radius</b> and <b>alpha_radius</b> default to the
           corresponding value set for <b>luma_radius</b>.

           The expressions can contain the following constants:

           <b>w</b>
           <b>h</b>   The input width and height in pixels.

           <b>cw</b>
           <b>ch</b>  The input chroma image width and height in pixels.

           <b>hsub</b>
           <b>vsub</b>
               The horizontal and vertical chroma subsample values. For example, for the pixel format "yuv422p",
               <u>hsub</u> is 2 and <u>vsub</u> is 1.

       <b>luma_power,</b> <b>lp</b>
       <b>chroma_power,</b> <b>cp</b>
       <b>alpha_power,</b> <b>ap</b>
           Specify how many times the boxblur filter is applied to the corresponding plane.

           Default  value  for  <b>luma_power</b>  is  2. If not specified, <b>chroma_power</b> and <b>alpha_power</b> default to the
           corresponding value set for <b>luma_power</b>.

           A value of 0 will disable the effect.

       <u>Examples</u>

       Apply boxblur filter, setting each pixel of the output to the average value of box-radiuses  <u>luma_radius</u>,
       <u>chroma_radius</u>,  <u>alpha_radius</u> for each plane respectively. The filter will apply <u>luma_power</u>, <u>chroma_power</u>,
       <u>alpha_power</u> times onto the corresponding plane. For pixels on the edges of the image, the radius does not
       extend beyond the image boundaries, and so out-of-range coordinates are not used in the calculations.

       •   Apply a boxblur filter with the luma, chroma, and alpha radius set to 2 and luma, chroma,  and  alpha
           power set to 3. The filter will run 3 times with box-radius set to 2 for every plane of the image.

                   -i INPUT -vf "hwupload, boxblur_opencl=luma_radius=2:luma_power=3, hwdownload" OUTPUT
                   -i INPUT -vf "hwupload, boxblur_opencl=2:3, hwdownload" OUTPUT

       •   Apply  a  boxblur filter with luma radius set to 2, luma_power to 1, chroma_radius to 4, chroma_power
           to 5, alpha_radius to 3 and alpha_power to 7.

           For the luma plane, a 2x2 box radius will be run once.

           For the chroma plane, a 4x4 box radius will be run 5 times.

           For the alpha plane, a 3x3 box radius will be run 7 times.

                   -i INPUT -vf "hwupload, boxblur_opencl=2:1:4:5:3:7, hwdownload" OUTPUT

   <b>colorkey_opencl</b>
       RGB colorspace color keying.

       The filter accepts the following options:

       <b>color</b>
           The color which will be replaced with transparency.

       <b>similarity</b>
           Similarity percentage with the key color.

           0.01 matches only the exact key color, while 1.0 matches everything.

       <b>blend</b>
           Blend percentage.

           0.0 makes pixels either fully transparent, or not transparent at all.

           Higher values result in semi-transparent pixels, with a higher  transparency  the  more  similar  the
           pixels color is to the key color.

       <u>Examples</u>

       •   Make every semi-green pixel in the input transparent with some slight blending:

                   -i INPUT -vf "hwupload, colorkey_opencl=green:0.3:0.1, hwdownload" OUTPUT

       <b>0rdiv</b>
       <b>1rdiv</b>
       <b>2rdiv</b>
       <b>3rdiv</b>
           Set  multiplier  for  calculated  value  for each plane.  If unset or 0, it will be sum of all matrix
           elements.  The option value must be a float number greater or equal to 0.0. Default value is 1.0.

       <b>0bias</b>
       <b>1bias</b>
       <b>2bias</b>
       <b>3bias</b>
           Set bias for each plane. This value is added to the result of the multiplication.  Useful for  making
           the  overall  image  brighter or darker.  The option value must be a float number greater or equal to
           0.0. Default value is 0.0.

       <u>Examples</u>

       The filter accepts the following options:

       <b>tripod</b>
           Simulates a tripod by preventing any camera movement whatsoever from the original frame. Defaults  to
           0.

       <b>debug</b>
           Whether  or  not  additional  debug info should be displayed, both in the processed output and in the
           console.

           Note that in order to see console debug output you will also need to pass "-v verbose" to ffmpeg.

           Viewing point matches in the output video is only supported for RGB input.

           Defaults to 0.

       <b>adaptive_crop</b>
           Whether or not to do a tiny bit of cropping at the borders to cut down  on  the  amount  of  mirrored
           pixels.

           Defaults to 1.

       <b>refine_features</b>
           Whether or not feature points should be refined at a sub-pixel level.

           This can be turned off for a slight performance gain at the cost of precision.

           Defaults to 1.

       <b>smooth_strength</b>
           The strength of the smoothing applied to the camera path from 0.0 to 1.0.

           1.0 is the maximum smoothing strength while values less than that result in less smoothing.

           0.0 causes the filter to adaptively choose a smoothing strength on a per-frame basis.

           Defaults to 0.0.

       <b>smooth_window_multiplier</b>
           Controls  the  size  of  the  smoothing  window  (the  number  of frames buffered to determine motion
           information from).

           The size of the smoothing window is determined by multiplying the framerate  of  the  video  by  this
           number.

           Acceptable values range from 0.1 to 10.0.

           Larger  values  increase the amount of motion data available for determining how to smooth the camera
           path, potentially improving smoothness, but also increase latency and memory usage.

           Defaults to 2.0.

       <u>Examples</u>

       •   Stabilize a video with a fixed, medium smoothing strength:

                   -i INPUT -vf "hwupload, deshake_opencl=smooth_strength=0.5, hwdownload" OUTPUT

       •   Stabilize a video with debugging (both in console and in rendered video):

       <b>threshold0</b>
       <b>threshold1</b>
       <b>threshold2</b>
       <b>threshold3</b>
           Limit the maximum change for each plane. Range is "[0, 65535]" and default value  is  65535.   If  0,
           plane will remain unchanged.

       <b>coordinates</b>
           Flag  which  specifies the pixel to refer to.  Range is "[0, 255]" and default value is 255, i.e. all
           eight pixels are used.

           Flags to local 3x3 coordinates region centered on "x":

               1 2 3

               4 x 5

               6 7 8

       <u>Example</u>

       •   Apply dilation filter with threshold0 set to  30,  threshold1  set  40,  threshold2  set  to  50  and
           coordinates  set  to 231, setting each pixel of the output to the local maximum between pixels: 1, 2,
           3, 6, 7, 8 of the 3x3 region centered on it in the input. If the difference between input  pixel  and
           local  maximum  is  more then threshold of the corresponding plane, output pixel will be set to input
           pixel + threshold of corresponding plane.

       Non-local Means denoise filter through OpenCL, this filter accepts same options as <b>nlmeans</b>.

   <b>overlay_opencl</b>
       Overlay one video on top of another.

       It takes two inputs and has one output. The first input is the "main" video on which the second input  is
       overlaid.   This  filter  requires  same  memory  layout for all the inputs. So, format conversion may be
       needed.

       The filter accepts the following options:

       <b>x</b>   Set the x coordinate of the overlaid video on the main video.  Default value is 0.

       <b>y</b>   Set the y coordinate of the overlaid video on the main video.  Default value is 0.

       <u>Examples</u>

       •   Overlay an image LOGO at the top-left corner of the INPUT video. Both inputs are yuv420p format.

       •   The inputs have same memory layout for color channels , the overlay has additional alpha plane,  like
           INPUT is yuv420p, and the LOGO is yuva420p.

                   -i INPUT -i LOGO -filter_complex "[0:v]hwupload[a], [1:v]format=yuva420p, hwupload[b], [a][b]overlay_opencl, hwdownload" OUTPUT

   <b>pad_opencl</b>
       Add paddings to the input image, and place the original input at the provided <u>x</u>, <u>y</u> coordinates.

       <b>height,</b> <b>h</b>
           Specify  an  expression  for  the  size of the output image with the paddings added. If the value for
           <u>width</u> or <u>height</u> is 0, the corresponding input size is used for the output.

           The <u>width</u> expression can reference the value set by the <u>height</u> expression, and vice versa.

           The default value of <u>width</u> and <u>height</u> is 0.

       <b>x</b>
       <b>y</b>   Specify the offsets to place the input image at within the padded area, with respect to the  top/left
           border of the output image.

           The <u>x</u> expression can reference the value set by the <u>y</u> expression, and vice versa.

           The default value of <u>x</u> and <u>y</u> is 0.

           If  <u>x</u>  or  <u>y</u>  evaluate to a negative number, they'll be changed so the input image is centered on the
           padded area.

       <b>color</b>
           Specify the color of the padded area. For the syntax of this option, check the <b>"Color"</b> <b>section</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b>

   <b>prewitt_opencl</b>
       Apply the Prewitt operator (&lt;<b>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prewitt_operator</b>&gt;) to input video stream.

       The filter accepts the following option:

       <b>planes</b>
           Set which planes to filter. Default value is 0xf, by which all planes are processed.

       <b>scale</b>
           Set  value  which will be multiplied with filtered result.  Range is "[0.0, 65535]" and default value
           is 1.0.

       <b>delta</b>
           Set value which will be added to filtered result.  Range is "[-65535, 65535]" and  default  value  is
           0.0.

       <u>Example</u>

       •   Apply the Prewitt operator with scale set to 2 and delta set to 10.

   <b>program_opencl</b>
       Filter video using an OpenCL program.

       <b>source</b>
           OpenCL program source file.

       <b>kernel</b>
           Kernel name in program.

       <b>inputs</b>
           Number of inputs to the filter.  Defaults to 1.

       <b>size,</b> <b>s</b>
           Size of output frames.  Defaults to the same as the first input.

       The "program_opencl" filter also supports the <b>framesync</b> options.

       The  program  source  file must contain a kernel function with the given name, which will be run once for
       each plane of the output.  Each run on a plane gets enqueued as a separate 2D  global  NDRange  with  one
       work-item  for  each  pixel  to  be  generated.  The global ID offset for each work-item is therefore the
       coordinates of a pixel in the destination image.

       The kernel function needs to take the following arguments:

       •   Destination image, <b>__</b><u>write_only</u> <u>image2d_t</u>.

           This image will become the output; the kernel should write all of it.

       •   Frame index, <u>unsigned</u> <u>int</u>.

           This is a counter starting from zero and increasing by one for each frame.

       •   Source images, <b>__</b><u>read_only</u> <u>image2d_t</u>.

           These are the most recent images on each input.  The kernel  may  read  from  them  to  generate  the
           output, but they can't be written to.

       Example programs:

       •   Copy the input to the output (output must be the same size as the input).

                   __kernel void copy(__write_only image2d_t destination,
                                      unsigned int index,
                                      __read_only  image2d_t source)

                       float4 value = read_imagef(source, sampler, location);

                       write_imagef(destination, location, value);
                   }

       •   Apply  a  simple  transformation,  rotating the input by an amount increasing with the index counter.
           Pixel values are linearly interpolated by the  sampler,  and  the  output  need  not  have  the  same
           dimensions as the input.

   <b>remap_opencl</b>
       Remap pixels using 2nd: Xmap and 3rd: Ymap input video stream.

       Destination  pixel at position (X, Y) will be picked from source (x, y) position where x = Xmap(X, Y) and
       y = Ymap(X, Y). If mapping values are out of range, zero value for pixel will  be  used  for  destination
       pixel.

       Xmap  and  Ymap  input  video streams must be of same dimensions. Output video stream will have Xmap/Ymap
       video stream dimensions.  Xmap and Ymap input video streams are 32bit float pixel format, single channel.

   <b>tonemap_opencl</b>
       Perform HDR(PQ/HLG) to SDR conversion with tone-mapping.

       It accepts the following parameters:

       <b>tonemap</b>
           Specify the tone-mapping operator to be used. Same as tonemap option in <b>tonemap</b>.

       <b>param</b>
           Tune the tone mapping algorithm. same as param option in <b>tonemap</b>.

       <b>desat</b>
           Apply desaturation for highlights that exceed this level of brightness. The higher the parameter, the
           more color information will be preserved. This setting helps prevent unnaturally blown-out colors for
           super-highlights, by (smoothly) turning into white instead. This makes images feel more  natural,  at
           the cost of reducing information about out-of-range colors.

           The  default  value is 0.5, and the algorithm here is a little different from the cpu version tonemap
           currently. A setting of 0.0 disables this option.

       <b>threshold</b>
           The tonemapping algorithm parameters is fine-tuned per each scene. And a threshold is used to  detect
           whether  the  scene  has changed or not. If the distance between the current frame average brightness
           and the current running average exceeds a threshold value, we would re-calculate  scene  average  and
           peak brightness.  The default value is 0.2.

       <b>format</b>
           Specify the output pixel format.

           Currently supported formats are:

           <u>p010</u>

</pre><h4><b>VAAPI</b> <b>VIDEO</b> <b>FILTERS</b></h4><pre>
       VAAPI  Video  filters  are  usually  used with VAAPI decoder and VAAPI encoder. Below is a description of
       VAAPI video filters.

       To enable compilation of these filters you need to configure FFmpeg with "--enable-vaapi".

       To use vaapi filters, you need to setup the vaapi device correctly. For  more  information,  please  read
       &lt;<b>https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/Hardware/VAAPI</b>&gt;

   <b>overlay_vaapi</b>
       Overlay one video on the top of another.

       It  takes two inputs and has one output. The first input is the "main" video on which the second input is
       overlaid.

       The filter accepts the following options:

       <b>x</b>
       <b>y</b>   Set expressions for the x and y coordinates of the overlaid video on the main video.

           Default value is "0" for both expressions.

       <b>w</b>
       <b>h</b>   Set expressions for the width and height the overlaid video on the main video.

           Default values are 'overlay_iw' for 'w' and 'overlay_ih*w/overlay_iw' for 'h'.

           The expressions can contain the following parameters:

           <b>main_w,</b> <b>W</b>
           <b>main_h,</b> <b>H</b>
               The main input width and height.

           <b>overlay_iw</b>
           <b>overlay_ih</b>
               The overlay input width and height.

           <b>overlay_w,</b> <b>w</b>
           <b>overlay_h,</b> <b>h</b>
               The overlay output width and height.

           <b>overlay_x,</b> <b>x</b>
           <b>overlay_y,</b> <b>y</b>
               Position of the overlay layer inside of main

       <b>alpha</b>
           Set transparency of overlaid  video.  Allowed  range  is  0.0  to  1.0.   Higher  value  means  lower
           transparency.  Default value is 1.0.

       <b>eof_action</b>

</pre><h4><b>VULKAN</b> <b>VIDEO</b> <b>FILTERS</b></h4><pre>
       Below is a description of the currently available Vulkan video filters.

       To enable compilation of these filters you need to configure FFmpeg  with  "--enable-vulkan"  and  either
       "--enable-libglslang" or "--enable-libshaderc".

       Running  Vulkan  filters  requires  you  to  initialize  a hardware device and to pass that device to all
       filters in any filter graph.

       <b>-init_hw_device</b> <b>vulkan[=</b><u>name</u><b>][:</b><u>device</u><b>[,</b><u>key=value</u><b>...]]</b>
           Initialise a new hardware device of type <u>vulkan</u> called <u>name</u>, using the given  device  parameters  and
           options in <u>key=value</u>. The following options are supported:

           <b>debug</b>
               Switches validation layers on if set to 1.

           <b>linear_images</b>
               Allocates linear images. Does not apply to decoding.

           <b>disable_multiplane</b>
               Disables multiplane images. Does not apply to decoding.

       <b>-filter_hw_device</b> <u>name</u>
           Pass the hardware device called <u>name</u> to all filters in any filter graph.

       For more detailed information see &lt;<b>https://www.ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg.html#Advanced-Video-options</b>&gt;

       •   Example of choosing the first device and running nlmeans_vulkan filter with default parameters on it.

                   -init_hw_device vulkan=vk:0 -filter_hw_device vk -i INPUT -vf "hwupload,nlmeans_vulkan,hwdownload" OUTPUT

       As Vulkan filters are not able to access frame data in normal memory, all frame data needs to be uploaded
       (<b>hwupload</b>) to hardware surfaces connected to the appropriate device before being used and then downloaded
       (<b>hwdownload</b>) back to normal memory. Note that <b>hwupload</b> will upload to a frame with the same layout as the
       software  frame,  so  it may be necessary to add a <b>format</b> filter immediately before to get the input into
       the right format and <b>hwdownload</b> does not support all formats on the output - it is usually  necessary  to
       insert  an  additional  <b>format</b> filter immediately following in the graph to get the output in a supported
       format.

   <b>avgblur_vulkan</b>
       Apply an average blur filter, implemented on the GPU using Vulkan.

       The filter accepts the following options:

       <b>sizeX</b>
           Set horizontal radius size.  Range is "[1, 32]" and default value is 3.

       <b>sizeY</b>
           Set vertical radius size. Range is "[1, 32]" and default value is 3.

       <b>planes</b>
           Set which planes to filter. Default value is 0xf, by which all planes are processed.

   <b>blend_vulkan</b>
       Blend two Vulkan frames into each other.

       The "blend" filter takes two input streams and outputs one stream, the first input is the "top" layer and
       second input is "bottom" layer.  By default, the output terminates when the longest input terminates.

       A description of the accepted options follows.

       <b>c0_mode</b>
       <b>c1_mode</b>
       <b>c2_mode</b>
       <b>c3_mode</b>
       <b>all_mode</b>
           Set blend mode for specific pixel component or all pixel components  in  case  of  <u>all_mode</u>.  Default
           value is "normal".

           Available values for component modes are:

           <b>normal</b>
           <b>multiply</b>

   <b>bwdif_vulkan</b>
       Deinterlacer  using  <b>bwdif</b>, the "Bob Weaver Deinterlacing Filter" algorithm, implemented on the GPU using
       Vulkan.

       It accepts the following parameters:

       <b>mode</b>
           The interlacing mode to adopt. It accepts one of the following values:

           <b>0,</b> <b>send_frame</b>
               Output one frame for each frame.

           <b>1,</b> <b>send_field</b>
               Output one frame for each field.

           The default value is "send_field".

       <b>parity</b>
           The picture field parity assumed for the input interlaced video. It  accepts  one  of  the  following
           values:

           <b>0,</b> <b>tff</b>
               Assume the top field is first.

           <b>1,</b> <b>bff</b>
               Assume the bottom field is first.

           <b>-1,</b> <b>auto</b>
               Enable automatic detection of field parity.

           The  default  value  is  "auto".   If  the interlacing is unknown or the decoder does not export this
           information, top field first will be assumed.

       <b>deint</b>
           Specify which frames to deinterlace. Accepts one of the following values:

           <b>0,</b> <b>all</b>

       effect with YCbCr inputs too.

       <b>dist_x</b>
           Horizontal  displacement  multiplier. Each chroma pixel's position will be multiplied by this amount,
           starting from the center of the image. Default is 0.

       <b>dist_y</b>
           Similarly, this sets the vertical displacement multiplier. Default is 0.

   <b>color_vulkan</b>
       Video source that creates a Vulkan frame of a solid color.  Useful for benchmarking, or overlaying.

       It accepts the following parameters:

       <b>color</b>
           The color to use. Either a name, or a hexadecimal value.  The default value is "black".

       <b>size</b>
           The size of the output frame. Default value is "1920x1080".

       <b>rate</b>
           The framerate to output at. Default value is 60 frames per second.

       <b>duration</b>

       <b>out_range</b>
           Set the output YCbCr sample range.

           This allows the autodetected value to be overridden as well as allows forcing a specific  value  used
           for the output and encoder. If not specified, the range depends on the pixel format. Possible values:

           <b>auto/unknown</b>
               Choose automatically.

           <b>jpeg/full/pc</b>

           Set the kernel size along the horizontal axis. Default is 19.

       <b>sizeV</b>
           Set the kernel size along the vertical axis. Default is 0, which sets to use the same value as <u>size</u>.

   <b>nlmeans_vulkan</b>
       Denoise frames using Non-Local Means algorithm, implemented on the GPU using Vulkan.  Supports more pixel
       formats than <b>nlmeans</b> or <b>nlmeans_opencl</b>, including alpha channel support.

       <b>t</b>   Set  parallelism.  Default is 36. Must be a number in the range [1, 168].  Larger values may speed up
           processing, at the cost of more VRAM.  Lower values will slow it down,  reducing  VRAM  usage.   Only
           supported on GPUs with atomic float operations (RDNA3+, Ampere+).

       <b>s0</b>
       <b>s1</b>
       <b>s2</b>
       <b>s3</b>  Set  denoising  strength  for  a specific component. Default is <u>1</u>, equal to <b>s</b>.  Must be odd number in
           range [1, 100].

       <b>p0</b>
       <b>p1</b>
       <b>p2</b>
       <b>p3</b>  Set patch size for a specific component. Default is <u>7</u>, equal to <b>p</b>.  Must be odd number in  range  [0,
           99].

   <b>overlay_vulkan</b>
       Overlay one video on top of another.

       It  takes two inputs and has one output. The first input is the "main" video on which the second input is
       overlaid.  This filter requires all inputs to use the same pixel format. So,  format  conversion  may  be
       needed.

       The filter accepts the following options:

       <b>x</b>   Set the x coordinate of the overlaid video on the main video.  Default value is 0.

       <b>y</b>   Set the y coordinate of the overlaid video on the main video.  Default value is 0.

   <b>transpose_vt</b>
       Transpose  rows  with  columns in the input video and optionally flip it.  For more in depth examples see
       the <b>transpose</b> video filter, which shares mostly the same options.

       It accepts the following parameters:

       <b>dir</b> Specify the transposition direction.

           Can assume the following values:

           <b>cclock_flip</b>
               Rotate by 90 degrees counterclockwise and vertically flip. (default)

           <b>clock</b>

           <b>vflip</b>
               Flip the input video vertically.

       <b>passthrough</b>
           Do not apply the transposition if the input geometry matches  the  one  specified  by  the  specified
           value. It accepts the following values:

           <b>none</b>
               Always apply transposition. (default)

           <b>portrait</b>
               Preserve portrait geometry (when <u>height</u> &gt;= <u>width</u>).

</pre><h4><b>QSV</b> <b>VIDEO</b> <b>FILTERS</b></h4><pre>
       Below is a description of the currently available QSV video filters.

       To  enable  compilation  of  these  filters  you  need  to  configure  FFmpeg  with  "--enable-libmfx" or
       "--enable-libvpl".

       To use QSV filters, you need to setup the  QSV  device  correctly.  For  more  information,  please  read
       &lt;<b>https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/Hardware/QuickSync</b>&gt;

   <b>hstack_qsv</b>
       Stack input videos horizontally.

       This  is  the  QSV variant of the <b>hstack</b> filter, each input stream may have different height, this filter
       will scale down/up each input stream while keeping the original aspect.

       It accepts the following options:

       <b>inputs</b>
           See <b>hstack</b>.

       <b>shortest</b>
           See <b>hstack</b>.

       <b>height</b>
           Set height of output. If set to 0, this filter will set height of output to height of the first input
           stream. Default value is 0.

   <b>vstack_qsv</b>
       Stack input videos vertically.

       This is the QSV variant of the <b>vstack</b> filter, each input stream may have  different  width,  this  filter
       will scale down/up each input stream while keeping the original aspect.

       It accepts the following options:

       <b>inputs</b>
           See <b>vstack</b>.

       <b>shortest</b>
           See <b>vstack</b>.

       <b>width</b>
           Set  width  of  output. If set to 0, this filter will set width of output to width of the first input
           stream. Default value is 0.

   <b>xstack_qsv</b>
       Stack video inputs into custom layout.

       This is the QSV variant of the <b>xstack</b> filter.

       It accepts the following options:

       <b>inputs</b>
           See <b>xstack</b>.

       <b>shortest</b>
           See <b>xstack</b>.

       <b>layout</b>
           See <b>xstack</b>.  Moreover, this permits the user to supply output size for each input stream.

                   xstack_qsv=inputs=4:layout=0_0_1920x1080|0_h0_1920x1080|w0_0_1920x1080|w0_h0_1920x1080

       <b>grid</b>
           See <b>xstack</b>.

       <b>grid_tile_size</b>
           Set output size for each input stream when <b>grid</b> is set. If this option is not set, this  filter  will
           set  output  size  by  default  to the size of the first input stream. For the syntax of this option,
           check the <b>"Video</b> <b>size"</b> <b>section</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ffmpeg-utils</b> <b>manual</b>.

           See <b>xstack</b>.

</pre><h4><b>VIDEO</b> <b>SOURCES</b></h4><pre>
       Below is a description of the currently available video sources.

   <b>buffer</b>
       Buffer video frames, and make them available to the filter chain.

       This source is mainly intended for a programmatic use, in particular through  the  interface  defined  in
       <u>libavfilter/buffersrc.h</u>.

       It accepts the following parameters:

       <b>video_size</b>
           Specify  the  size  (width  and  height) of the buffered video frames. For the syntax of this option,
           check the <b>"Video</b> <b>size"</b> <b>section</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ffmpeg-utils</b> <b>manual</b>.

       <b>width</b>
           The input video width.

       <b>height</b>
           The input video height.

       <b>pix_fmt</b>
           A string representing  the  pixel  format  of  the  buffered  video  frames.   It  may  be  a  number
           corresponding to a pixel format, or a pixel format name.

       <b>time_base</b>
           Specify the timebase assumed by the timestamps of the buffered frames.

       <b>frame_rate</b>
           Specify the frame rate expected for the video stream.

       <b>colorspace</b>
           A string representing the color space of the buffered video frames.  It may be a number corresponding
           to a color space, or a color space name.

       <b>range</b>
           A string representing the color range of the buffered video frames.  It may be a number corresponding
           to a color range, or a color range name.

       <b>pixel_aspect,</b> <b>sar</b>
           The sample (pixel) aspect ratio of the input video.

       <b>hw_frames_ctx</b>
           When  using  a  hardware  pixel format, this should be a reference to an AVHWFramesContext describing
           input frames.

       For example:

               buffer=width=320:height=240:pix_fmt=yuv410p:time_base=1/24:sar=1

       will instruct the source to accept video frames with size 320x240 and  with  format  "yuv410p",  assuming
       1/24 as the timestamps timebase and square pixels (1:1 sample aspect ratio).  Since the pixel format with
       name   "yuv410p"   corresponds   to   the   number   6   (check  the  enum  AVPixelFormat  definition  in
       <u>libavutil/pixfmt.h</u>), this example corresponds to:

               buffer=size=320x240:pixfmt=6:time_base=1/24:pixel_aspect=1/1

       Alternatively, the options can be specified as a flat string, but this syntax is deprecated:

       <u>width</u>:<u>height</u>:<u>pix_fmt</u>:<u>time_base.num</u>:<u>time_base.den</u>:<u>pixel_aspect.num</u>:<u>pixel_aspect.den</u>

   <b>cellauto</b>
       Create a pattern generated by an elementary cellular automaton.

       The initial state of the cellular automaton can be defined through the <b>filename</b> and <b>pattern</b>  options.  If
       such options are not specified an initial state is created randomly.

       At  each  new  frame  a  new  row  in  the video is filled with the result of the cellular automaton next
       generation. The behavior when the whole frame is filled is defined by the <b>scroll</b> option.

       This source accepts the following options:

       <b>filename,</b> <b>f</b>
           Read the initial cellular automaton state, i.e. the starting row, from the specified  file.   In  the
           file,  each  non-whitespace  character is considered an alive cell, a newline will terminate the row,
           and further characters in the file will be ignored.

       <b>pattern,</b> <b>p</b>
           Read the initial cellular automaton state, i.e. the starting row, from the specified string.

           Each non-whitespace character in the string is considered an alive cell, a newline will terminate the
           row, and further characters in the string will be ignored.

       <b>rate,</b> <b>r</b>
           Set the video rate, that is the number of frames generated per second.  Default is 25.

       <b>random_fill_ratio,</b> <b>ratio</b>
           Set the random fill ratio for the initial cellular automaton row. It is a floating point number value
           ranging from 0 to 1, defaults to 1/PHI.

           This option is ignored when a file or a pattern is specified.

       <b>random_seed,</b> <b>seed</b>
           Set the seed for filling randomly the initial  row,  must  be  an  integer  included  between  0  and
           UINT32_MAX.  If  not  specified, or if explicitly set to -1, the filter will try to use a good random
           seed on a best effort basis.

       <b>rule</b>
           Set the cellular automaton rule, it is a number ranging from 0 to 255.  Default value is 110.

       <b>size,</b> <b>s</b>
           Set the size of the output video. For the syntax of this option, check the <b>"Video</b>  <b>size"</b>  <b>section</b>  <b>in</b>
           <b>the</b> <b>ffmpeg-utils</b> <b>manual</b>.

           If <b>filename</b> or <b>pattern</b> is specified, the size is set by default to the width of the specified initial
           state row, and the height is set to <u>width</u> * PHI.

           If  <b>size</b> is set, it must contain the width of the specified pattern string, and the specified pattern
           will be centered in the larger row.

           If a filename or a pattern string is not specified, the size value defaults to "320x518" (used for  a
           randomly generated initial state).

       <b>scroll</b>
           If  set  to  1, scroll the output upward when all the rows in the output have been already filled. If
           set to 0, the new generated row will be written over the top row just after the bottom row is filled.
           Defaults to 1.

       <b>start_full,</b> <b>full</b>
           If set to 1, completely fill the output with generated rows before outputting the first frame.   This
           is the default behavior, for disabling set the value to 0.

       <b>stitch</b>
           If  set  to  1,  stitch  the  left  and  right row edges together.  This is the default behavior, for
           disabling set the value to 0.

       <u>Examples</u>

       •   Read the initial state from <u>pattern</u>, and specify an output of size 200x400.

                   cellauto=f=pattern:s=200x400

       •   Generate a random initial row with a width of 200 cells, with a fill ratio of 2/3:

                   cellauto=ratio=2/3:s=200x200

       •   Create a pattern generated by rule 18 starting by a single alive cell centered on an initial row with
           width 100:

                   cellauto=p=@s=100x400:full=0:rule=18

       •   Specify a more elaborated initial pattern:

                   cellauto=p='@@ @ @@':s=100x400:full=0:rule=18

   <b>coreimagesrc</b>
       Video source generated on GPU using Apple's CoreImage API on OSX.

       This video source is a specialized version of the <b>coreimage</b> video filter.  Use a core image generator  at
       the beginning of the applied filterchain to generate the content.

       The coreimagesrc video source accepts the following options:

       <b>list_generators</b>
           List all available generators along with all their respective options as well as possible minimum and
           maximum values along with the default values.

                   list_generators=true

       <b>size,</b> <b>s</b>
           Specify  the size of the sourced video. For the syntax of this option, check the <b>"Video</b> <b>size"</b> <b>section</b>
           <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ffmpeg-utils</b> <b>manual</b>.  The default value is "320x240".

       <b>rate,</b> <b>r</b>
           Specify the frame rate of the sourced video, as the number of frames generated per second. It has  to
           be  a  string in the format <u>frame_rate_num</u>/<u>frame_rate_den</u>, an integer number, a floating point number
           or a valid video frame rate abbreviation. The default value is "25".

       <b>sar</b> Set the sample aspect ratio of the sourced video.

       <b>duration,</b> <b>d</b>
           Set the duration of the sourced video. See <b>the</b> <b>Time</b> <b>duration</b> <b>section</b> <b>in</b>  <b>the</b>  <b><a href="../man1/ffmpeg-utils.1.html">ffmpeg-utils</a>(1)</b>  <b>manual</b>
           for the accepted syntax.

           If  not  specified,  or  the  expressed  duration  is negative, the video is supposed to be generated
           forever.

       Additionally, all options of the <b>coreimage</b> video filter are accepted.  A complete filterchain can be used
       for further processing of the generated input without CPU-HOST transfer. See <b>coreimage</b> documentation  and
       examples for details.

       <u>Examples</u>

       •   Use  CIQRCodeGenerator  to  create  a  QR code for the FFmpeg homepage, given as complete and escaped
           command-line for Apple's standard bash shell:

                   ffmpeg -f lavfi -i coreimagesrc=s=100x100:filter=CIQRCodeGenerator@inputMessage=https\\\\\://FFmpeg.org/@inputCorrectionLevel=H -frames:v 1 QRCode.png

           This example is equivalent to the QRCode example of <b>coreimage</b> without the need for  a  nullsrc  video
           source.

   <b>ddagrab</b>
       Captures the Windows Desktop via Desktop Duplication API.

       The  filter  exclusively returns D3D11 Hardware Frames, for on-gpu encoding or processing. So an explicit
       <b>hwdownload</b> is needed for any kind of software processing.

       It accepts the following options:

       <b>output_idx</b>
           DXGI Output Index to capture.

           Usually corresponds to the index Windows has given the screen minus one, so it's starting at 0.

           Defaults to output 0.

       <b>draw_mouse</b>
           Whether to draw the mouse cursor.

           Defaults to true.

           Only affects hardware cursors. If a game or application renders  its  own  cursor,  it'll  always  be
           captured.

       <b>framerate</b>
           Maximum framerate at which the desktop will be captured - the interval between successive frames will
           not  be  smaller  than  the  inverse  of the framerate. When <u>dup_frames</u> is true (the default) and the
           desktop is not being updated often enough, the filter will duplicate  a  previous  frame.  Note  that
           there  is  no  background  buffering going on, so when the filter is not polled often enough then the
           actual inter-frame interval may be significantly larger.

           Defaults to 30 FPS.

       <b>video_size</b>
           Specify the size of the captured video.

           Defaults to the full size of the screen.

           Cropped from the bottom/right if smaller than screen size.

       <b>offset_x</b>
           Horizontal offset of the captured video.

       <b>offset_y</b>
           Vertical offset of the captured video.

       <b>output_fmt</b>
           Desired filter output format.  Defaults to 8 Bit BGRA.

           It accepts the following values:

           <b>auto</b>
               Passes all supported output formats to DDA and returns what DDA decides to use.

           <b>8bit</b>
           <b>bgra</b>
               8 Bit formats always work, and DDA will convert to them if necessary.

           <b>10bit</b>
           <b>x2bgr10</b>
               Filter initialization will fail if 10 bit format is requested but unavailable.

       <b>dup_frames</b>
           When this option is set to true (the default), the filter will duplicate frames when the desktop  has
           not  been  updated  in order to maintain approximately constant target framerate. When this option is
           set to false, the filter will wait for the desktop to be  updated  (inter-frame  intervals  may  vary
           significantly in this case).

       <u>Examples</u>

       Capture primary screen and encode using nvenc:

               ffmpeg -f lavfi -i ddagrab -c:v h264_nvenc -cq 18 output.mp4

       You  can also skip the lavfi device and directly use the filter.  Also demonstrates downloading the frame
       and encoding with libx264.  Explicit output format specification is required in this case:

               ffmpeg -filter_complex ddagrab=output_idx=1:framerate=60,hwdownload,format=bgra -c:v libx264 -crf 18 output.mp4

       If you want to capture only a subsection of the desktop, this can be achieved  by  specifying  a  smaller
       size and its offsets into the screen:

               ddagrab=video_size=800x600:offset_x=100:offset_y=100

   <b>gradients</b>
       Generate several gradients.

       <b>size,</b> <b>s</b>
           Set  frame  size.  For  the syntax of this option, check the <b>"Video</b> <b>size"</b> <b>section</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ffmpeg-utils</b>
           <b>manual</b>. Default value is "640x480".

       <b>rate,</b> <b>r</b>
           Set frame rate, expressed as number of frames per second. Default value is "25".

       <b>c0,</b> <b>c1,</b> <b>c2,</b> <b>c3,</b> <b>c4,</b> <b>c5,</b> <b>c6,</b> <b>c7</b>
           Set 8 colors. Default values for colors is to pick random one.

       <b>x0,</b> <b>y0,</b> <b>y0,</b> <b>y1</b>
           Set gradient line source and destination points. If negative or out of range, random ones are picked.

       <b>nb_colors,</b> <b>n</b>
           Set number of colors to use at once. Allowed range is from 2 to 8. Default value is 2.

       <b>seed</b>
           Set seed for picking gradient line points.

       <b>duration,</b> <b>d</b>
           Set the duration of the sourced video. See <b>the</b> <b>Time</b> <b>duration</b> <b>section</b> <b>in</b>  <b>the</b>  <b><a href="../man1/ffmpeg-utils.1.html">ffmpeg-utils</a>(1)</b>  <b>manual</b>
           for the accepted syntax.

           If  not  specified,  or  the  expressed  duration  is negative, the video is supposed to be generated
           forever.

       <b>speed</b>
           Set speed of gradients rotation.

       <b>type,</b> <b>t</b>

   <b>frei0r_src</b>
       Provide a frei0r source.

       To enable compilation of this filter you need to install the frei0r  header  and  configure  FFmpeg  with
       "--enable-frei0r".

       This source accepts the following parameters:

       <b>size</b>
           The  size  of the video to generate. For the syntax of this option, check the <b>"Video</b> <b>size"</b> <b>section</b> <b>in</b>
           <b>the</b> <b>ffmpeg-utils</b> <b>manual</b>.

       <b>framerate</b>
           The framerate of the generated video. It may be a  string  of  the  form  <u>num</u>/<u>den</u>  or  a  frame  rate
           abbreviation.

       <b>filter_name</b>
           The  name  to  the  frei0r  source  to load. For more information regarding frei0r and how to set the
           parameters, read the <b>frei0r</b> section in the video filters documentation.

       <b>filter_params</b>
           A '|'-separated list of parameters to pass to the frei0r source.

       For example, to generate a frei0r partik0l source with size 200x200 and frame rate 10 which  is  overlaid
       on the overlay filter main input:

               frei0r_src=size=200x200:framerate=10:filter_name=partik0l:filter_params=1234 [overlay]; [in][overlay] overlay

   <b>life</b>
       Generate a life pattern.

       This source is based on a generalization of John Conway's life game.

       The  sourced  input  represents  a  life  grid,  each  pixel represents a cell which can be in one of two
       possible states, alive or dead. Every cell interacts with its eight neighbours, which are the cells  that
       are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent.

       At  each  interaction  the  grid  evolves  according  to  the adopted rule, which specifies the number of
       neighbor alive cells which will make a cell stay alive or born. The <b>rule</b> option allows one to specify the
       rule to adopt.

       This source accepts the following options:

       <b>filename,</b> <b>f</b>
           Set the file from which to read the initial grid state. In the file, each non-whitespace character is
           considered an alive cell, and newline is used to delimit the end of each row.

           If this option is not specified, the initial grid is generated randomly.

       <b>rate,</b> <b>r</b>
           Set the video rate, that is the number of frames generated per second.  Default is 25.

       <b>random_fill_ratio,</b> <b>ratio</b>
           Set the random fill ratio for the initial random grid. It is a floating point  number  value  ranging
           from 0 to 1, defaults to 1/PHI.  It is ignored when a file is specified.

       <b>random_seed,</b> <b>seed</b>
           Set  the  seed  for  filling  the  initial  random  grid,  must  be an integer included between 0 and
           UINT32_MAX. If not specified, or if explicitly set to -1, the filter will try to use  a  good  random
           seed on a best effort basis.

       <b>rule</b>
           Set the life rule.

           A  rule  can be specified with a code of the kind "S<u>NS</u>/B<u>NB</u>", where <u>NS</u> and <u>NB</u> are sequences of numbers
           in the range 0-8, <u>NS</u> specifies the number of alive neighbor cells which make a live cell stay  alive,
           and  <u>NB</u>  the  number of alive neighbor cells which make a dead cell to become alive (i.e. to "born").
           "s" and "b" can be used in place of "S" and "B", respectively.

           Alternatively a rule can be specified by an 18-bits integer. The 9 high order bits are used to encode
           the next cell state if it is alive for each number of  neighbor  alive  cells,  the  low  order  bits
           specify  the  rule for "borning" new cells. Higher order bits encode for an higher number of neighbor
           cells.  For example the number 6153 = "(12&lt;&lt;9)+9" specifies a stay alive rule of 12 and a  born  rule
           of 9, which corresponds to "S23/B03".

           Default  value  is  "S23/B3",  which is the original Conway's game of life rule, and will keep a cell
           alive if it has 2 or 3 neighbor alive cells, and will born a new cell if there are three alive  cells
           around a dead cell.

       <b>size,</b> <b>s</b>
           Set  the  size  of the output video. For the syntax of this option, check the <b>"Video</b> <b>size"</b> <b>section</b> <b>in</b>
           <b>the</b> <b>ffmpeg-utils</b> <b>manual</b>.

           If <b>filename</b> is specified, the size is set by default to the same size of the input file. If  <b>size</b>  is
           set,  it must contain the size specified in the input file, and the initial grid defined in that file
           is centered in the larger resulting area.

           If a filename is not specified, the size value defaults to "320x240" (used for a  randomly  generated
           initial grid).

       <b>stitch</b>
           If  set  to  1,  stitch  the  left  and right grid edges together, and the top and bottom edges also.
           Defaults to 1.

       <b>mold</b>
           Set cell mold speed. If set, a dead cell will go from <b>death_color</b> to <b>mold_color</b> with a step of  <b>mold</b>.
           <b>mold</b> can have a value from 0 to 255.

       <b>life_color</b>
           Set the color of living (or new born) cells.

       <b>death_color</b>
           Set the color of dead cells. If <b>mold</b> is set, this is the first color used to represent a dead cell.

       <b>mold_color</b>
           Set mold color, for definitely dead and moldy cells.

           For the syntax of these 3 color options, check the <b>"Color"</b> <b>section</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ffmpeg-utils</b> <b>manual</b>.

       <u>Examples</u>

       •   Read a grid from <u>pattern</u>, and center it on a grid of size 300x300 pixels:

                   life=f=pattern:s=300x300

       •   Generate a random grid of size 200x200, with a fill ratio of 2/3:

                   life=ratio=2/3:s=200x200

       •   Specify a custom rule for evolving a randomly generated grid:

                   life=rule=S14/B34

       •   Full example with slow death effect (mold) using <b>ffplay</b>:

                   ffplay -f lavfi life=s=300x200:mold=10:r=60:ratio=0.1:death_color=#C83232:life_color=#00ff00,scale=1200:800:flags=16

   <b>perlin</b>
       Generate Perlin noise.

       Perlin  noise  is  a  kind of noise with local continuity in space. This can be used to generate patterns
       with continuity in space and time, e.g. to simulate smoke, fluids, or terrain.

       In case more than one octave is specified through the <b>octaves</b> option, Perlin noise is generated as a  sum
       of  components, each one with doubled frequency. In this case the <b>persistence</b> option specify the ratio of
       the amplitude with respect to the previous component. More octave components enable to specify more  high
       frequency  details  in  the  generated  noise  (e.g. small size variations due to boulders in a generated
       terrain).

       <u>Options</u>

       <b>size,</b> <b>s</b>
           Specify the size (width and height) of the buffered video frames. For  the  syntax  of  this  option,
           check the <b>"Video</b> <b>size"</b> <b>section</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ffmpeg-utils</b> <b>manual</b>.  Default value is "320x240".

       <b>rate,</b> <b>r</b>
           Specify  the  frame  rate  expected for the video stream, expressed as a number of frames per second.
           Default value is 25.

       <b>octaves</b>
           Specify the total number of components making up the noise, each one with doubled frequency.  Default
           value is 1.

       <b>persistence</b>
           Set the ratio used to compute the amplitude of the next octave component with respect to the previous
           component amplitude. Default value is 1.

       <b>xscale</b>
       <b>yscale</b>
           Define  a  scale factor used to multiple the x, y coordinates. This can be useful to define an effect
           with a pattern stretched along the x or y axis. Default value is 1.

       <b>tscale</b>
           Define a scale factor used to multiple the time coordinate. This can be useful  to  change  the  time
           variation speed. Default value is 1.

       <b>random_mode</b>
           Set random mode used to compute initial pattern.

           Supported values are:

           <b>random</b>
               Compute and use random seed.

           <b>ken</b> Use  the  predefined initial pattern defined by Ken Perlin in the original article, can be useful
               to compare the output with other sources.

           <b>seed</b>
               Use the value specified by <b>random_seed</b> option.

           Default value is "random".

       <b>random_seed,</b> <b>seed</b>
           When <b>random_mode</b> is set to <u>random_seed</u>, use this value to compute the initial pattern. Default  value
           is 0.

       <u>Examples</u>

       •   Generate single component:

                   perlin

       •   Use Perlin noise with 7 components, each one with a halved contribution to total amplitude:

                   perlin=octaves=7:persistence=0.5

       •   Chain Perlin noise with the <b>lutyuv</b> to generate a black&amp;white effect:

                   perlin=octaves=3:tscale=0.3,lutyuv=y='if(lt(val\,128)\,255\,0)'

       •   Stretch noise along the y axis, and convert gray level to red-only signal:

                   perlin=octaves=7:tscale=0.4:yscale=0.3,lutrgb=r=val:b=0:g=0

   <b>qrencodesrc</b>
       Generate a QR code using the libqrencode library (see &lt;<b>https://fukuchi.org/works/qrencode/</b>&gt;).

       To enable the compilation of this source, you need to configure FFmpeg with "--enable-libqrencode".

       The  QR code is generated from the provided text or text pattern. The corresponding QR code is scaled and
       put in the video output according to the specified output size options.

       In case no text is specified, the QR code is not generated, but  an  empty  colored  output  is  returned
       instead.

       This source accepts the following options:

       <b>qrcode_width,</b> <b>q</b>
       <b>padded_qrcode_width,</b> <b>Q</b>
           Specify  an  expression  for  the  width  of  the  rendered  QR  code,  with and without padding. The
           <u>qrcode_width</u> expression can reference the value set by the <u>padded_qrcode_width</u> expression,  and  vice
           versa.  By default <u>padded_qrcode_width</u> is set to <u>qrcode_width</u>, meaning that there is no padding.

           These  expressions  are  evaluated  only  once,  when  initializing  the  source.   See  the <b>qrencode</b>
           <b>Expressions</b> section for details.

           Note that some of the constants are missing for the source (for example the <u>x</u> or <u>t</u> or ¸<u>n</u>), since they
           only makes sense when evaluating the expression for each frame rather than at initialization time.

       <b>rate,</b> <b>r</b>
           Specify the frame rate of the sourced video, as the number of frames generated per second. It has  to
           be  a  string in the format <u>frame_rate_num</u>/<u>frame_rate_den</u>, an integer number, a floating point number
           or a valid video frame rate abbreviation. The default value is "25".

       <b>case_sensitive,</b> <b>cs</b>
           Instruct libqrencode to use case sensitive encoding. This is enabled by default. This can be disabled
           to reduce the QR encoding size.

       <b>level,</b> <b>l</b>
           Specify the QR encoding error correction level. With an higher correction level,  the  encoding  size
           will increase but the code will be more robust to corruption.  Lower level is <u>L</u>.

           It accepts the following values:

           <b>L</b>
           <b>M</b>
           <b>Q</b>
           <b>H</b>
       <b>expansion</b>
           Select  how the input text is expanded. Can be either "none", or "normal" (default). See the <b>qrencode</b>
           <b>Text</b> <b>expansion</b> section for details.

       <b>text</b>
       <b>textfile</b>
           Define the text to be rendered. In case neither is specified, no QR is encoded (just an empty colored
           frame).

           In case expansion is enabled, the text is treated as a text template, using  the  qrencode  expansion
           mechanism. See the <b>qrencode</b> <b>Text</b> <b>expansion</b> section for details.

       <b>background_color,</b> <b>bc</b>
       <b>foreground_color,</b> <b>fc</b>
           Set  the  QR code and background color. The default value of <u>foreground_color</u> is "black", the default
           value of <u>background_color</u> is "white".

           For the syntax of the color options, check the <b>"Color"</b> <b>section</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ffmpeg-utils</b> <b>manual</b>.

       The "colorspectrum" source provides a color spectrum input.

       The "haldclutsrc" source provides an identity Hald CLUT. See also <b>haldclut</b> filter.

       The  "nullsrc"  source returns unprocessed video frames. It is mainly useful to be employed in analysis /
       debugging tools, or as the source for filters which ignore the input data.

       The "pal75bars" source generates a color bars pattern, based on EBU PAL recommendations  with  75%  color
       levels.

       The  "pal100bars" source generates a color bars pattern, based on EBU PAL recommendations with 100% color
       levels.

       The "rgbtestsrc" source generates an RGB test pattern useful for detecting RGB vs BGR issues. You  should
       see a red, green and blue stripe from top to bottom.

       The  "testsrc2"  source  is  similar to testsrc, but supports more pixel formats instead of just "rgb24".
       This allows using it as an input for other tests without requiring a format conversion.

       The "yuvtestsrc" source generates an YUV test pattern. You should see a y, cb and cr stripe from  top  to
       bottom.

       The sources accept the following parameters:

       <b>level</b>
           Specify  the  level  of  the  Hald  CLUT,  only available in the "haldclutsrc" source. A level of "N"
           generates a picture of "N*N*N" by "N*N*N" pixels to be used as identity matrix for 3D lookup  tables.
           Each component is coded on a "1/(N*N)" scale.

       <b>color,</b> <b>c</b>
           Specify the color of the source, only available in the "color" source. For the syntax of this option,
           check the <b>"Color"</b> <b>section</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ffmpeg-utils</b> <b>manual</b>.

       <b>size,</b> <b>s</b>
           Specify  the size of the sourced video. For the syntax of this option, check the <b>"Video</b> <b>size"</b> <b>section</b>
           <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ffmpeg-utils</b> <b>manual</b>.  The default value is "320x240".

           This option is not available with the "allrgb", "allyuv", and "haldclutsrc" filters.

       <b>rate,</b> <b>r</b>
           Specify the frame rate of the sourced video, as the number of frames generated per second. It has  to
           be  a  string in the format <u>frame_rate_num</u>/<u>frame_rate_den</u>, an integer number, a floating point number
           or a valid video frame rate abbreviation. The default value is "25".

       <b>duration,</b> <b>d</b>
           Set the duration of the sourced video. See <b>the</b> <b>Time</b> <b>duration</b> <b>section</b> <b>in</b>  <b>the</b>  <b><a href="../man1/ffmpeg-utils.1.html">ffmpeg-utils</a>(1)</b>  <b>manual</b>
           for the accepted syntax.

           If  not  specified,  or  the  expressed  duration  is negative, the video is supposed to be generated
           forever.

           Since the frame rate is used as time base, all frames including the last one  will  have  their  full
           duration. If the specified duration is not a multiple of the frame duration, it will be rounded up.

       <b>sar</b> Set the sample aspect ratio of the sourced video.

       <b>alpha</b>
           Specify  the  alpha  (opacity)  of the background, only available in the "testsrc2" source. The value
           must be between 0 (fully transparent) and 255 (fully opaque, the default).

       <b>decimals,</b> <b>n</b>
           Set the number of decimals to show in the timestamp, only available in the "testsrc" source.

           The displayed timestamp value will correspond to the original timestamp value multiplied by the power
           of 10 of the specified value. Default value is 0.

       <b>type</b>
           Set the type of the color spectrum, only available in the "colorspectrum" source. Can be one  of  the
           following:

           <b>black</b>
           <b>white</b>
           <b>all</b>
       <b>patch_size</b>
           Set patch size of single color patch, only available in the "colorchart" source. Default is "64x64".

       <b>preset</b>
           Set colorchecker colors preset, only available in the "colorchart" source.

           Available values are:

           <b>reference</b>
           <b>skintones</b>

           Default value is "reference".

       <u>Examples</u>

       •   Generate  a video with a duration of 5.3 seconds, with size 176x144 and a frame rate of 10 frames per
           second:

                   testsrc=duration=5.3:size=qcif:rate=10

   <b>avectorscope</b>
       Convert input audio to a video output, representing the audio vector scope.

       The filter is used to measure the difference between channels of stereo audio stream. A monaural  signal,
       consisting  of  identical left and right signal, results in straight vertical line. Any stereo separation
       is visible as a deviation from this line, creating a Lissajous figure.  If  the  straight  (or  deviation
       from it) but horizontal line appears this indicates that the left and right channels are out of phase.

       The filter accepts the following options:

       <b>mode,</b> <b>m</b>
           Set the vectorscope mode.

           Available values are:

       <u>Commands</u>

       This filter supports the all above options as commands except options "size" and "rate".

   <b>bench,</b> <b>abench</b>
       Benchmark part of a filtergraph.

       The filter accepts the following options:

       <b>action</b>
           Start or stop a timer.

           Available values are:

           <b>start</b>
               Get  the  current  time,  set  it as frame metadata (using the key "lavfi.bench.start_time"), and
               forward the frame to the next filter.

           <b>stop</b>
               Get the current time and  fetch  the  "lavfi.bench.start_time"  metadata  from  the  input  frame
               metadata  to  get  the  time  difference.  Time  difference,  average,  maximum  and minimum time
               (respectively "t", "avg", "max" and "min") are then printed.  The  timestamps  are  expressed  in
               seconds.

       <u>Examples</u>

       •   Benchmark <b>selectivecolor</b> filter:

                   bench=start,selectivecolor=reds=-.2 .12 -.49,bench=stop

   <b>concat</b>
       Concatenate audio and video streams, joining them together one after the other.

       The  filter  works  on  segments of synchronized video and audio streams. All segments must have the same
       number of streams of each type, and that will also be the number of streams at output.

       The filter accepts the following options:

       <b>n</b>   Set the number of segments. Default is 2.

       <b>v</b>   Set the number of output video streams, that is also the number of video  streams  in  each  segment.
           Default is 1.

       <b>a</b>   Set  the  number  of  output audio streams, that is also the number of audio streams in each segment.
           Default is 0.

       <b>unsafe</b>
           Activate unsafe mode: do not fail if segments have a different format.

       The filter has <u>v</u>+<u>a</u> outputs: first <u>v</u> video outputs, then <u>a</u> audio outputs.

       There are <u>n</u>x(<u>v</u>+<u>a</u>) inputs: first the inputs for the first segment, in the same order as the outputs,  then
       the inputs for the second segment, etc.

       Related  streams  do not always have exactly the same duration, for various reasons including codec frame
       size or sloppy authoring. For that reason, related synchronized streams  (e.g.  a  video  and  its  audio
       track)  should  be concatenated at once. The concat filter will use the duration of the longest stream in
       each segment (except the last one), and if necessary pad shorter audio streams with silence.

       For this filter to work correctly, all segments must start at timestamp 0.

       All corresponding streams must have the same parameters  in  all  segments;  the  filtering  system  will
       automatically select a common pixel format for video streams, and a common sample format, sample rate and
       channel layout for audio streams, but other settings, such as resolution, must be converted explicitly by
       the user.

       Different  frame  rates  are  acceptable  but  will  result  in variable frame rate at output; be sure to
       configure the output file to handle it.

       <u>Examples</u>

       •   Concatenate an opening, an episode and an ending, all in bilingual version (video in stream 0,  audio
           in streams 1 and 2):

                   ffmpeg -i opening.mkv -i episode.mkv -i ending.mkv -filter_complex \
                     '[0:0] [0:1] [0:2] [1:0] [1:1] [1:2] [2:0] [2:1] [2:2]
                      concat=n=3:v=1:a=2 [v] [a1] [a2]' \
                     -map '[v]' -map '[a1]' -map '[a2]' output.mkv

       •   Concatenate two parts, handling audio and video separately, using the (a)movie sources, and adjusting
           the resolution:

                   movie=part1.mp4, scale=512:288 [v1] ; amovie=part1.mp4 [a1] ;
                   movie=part2.mp4, scale=512:288 [v2] ; amovie=part2.mp4 [a2] ;
                   [v1] [v2] concat [outv] ; [a1] [a2] concat=v=0:a=1 [outa]

           Note  that  a desync will happen at the stitch if the audio and video streams do not have exactly the
           same duration in the first file.

       <u>Commands</u>

       This filter supports the following commands:

       <b>next</b>
           Close the current segment and step to the next one

   <b>ebur128</b>
       EBU R128 scanner filter. This filter takes an audio stream and analyzes its loudness level.  By  default,
       it  logs  a  message  at  a frequency of 10Hz with the Momentary loudness (identified by "M"), Short-term
       loudness ("S"), Integrated loudness ("I") and Loudness Range ("LRA").

       The filter can only analyze streams which have sample format  is  double-precision  floating  point.  The
       input  stream will be converted to this specification, if needed. Users may need to insert aformat and/or
       aresample filters after this filter to obtain the original parameters.

       The filter also has a video output (see the <u>video</u> option) with a real time graph to observe the  loudness
       evolution.  The  graphic  contains  the logged message mentioned above, so it is not printed anymore when
       this option is set, unless the verbose logging is set. The main graphing  area  contains  the  short-term
       loudness  (3  seconds  of  analysis),  and  the  gauge  on  the  right is for the momentary loudness (400
       milliseconds), but can optionally be configured to instead display short-term loudness (see <u>gauge</u>).

       The green area marks a  +/- 1LU target range around the  target  loudness  (-23LUFS  by  default,  unless
       modified through <u>target</u>).

       More information about the Loudness Recommendation EBU R128 on &lt;<b><a href="http://tech.ebu.ch/loudness">http://tech.ebu.ch/loudness</a></b>&gt;.

       The filter accepts the following options:

       <b>video</b>
           Activate the video output. The audio stream is passed unchanged whether this option is set or no. The
           video stream will be the first output stream if activated. Default is 0.

       <b>size</b>
           Set  the  video  size. This option is for video only. For the syntax of this option, check the <b>"Video</b>
           <b>size"</b> <b>section</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ffmpeg-utils</b> <b>manual</b>.  Default and minimum resolution is "640x480".

       <b>meter</b>
           Set the EBU scale meter. Default is 9. Common values are 9 and 18, respectively for EBU  scale  meter
           +9 and EBU scale meter +18. Any other integer value between this range is allowed.

       <b>metadata</b>
           Set metadata injection. If set to 1, the audio input will be segmented into 100ms output frames, each
           of them containing various loudness information in metadata.  All the metadata keys are prefixed with
           "lavfi.r128.".

           Default is 0.

       <b>framelog</b>
           Force the frame logging level.

           Available values are:

           <b>quiet</b>
               logging disabled

           <b>info</b>
               information logging level

           <b>verbose</b>
               verbose logging level

           By  default,  the  logging  level  is  set  to <u>info</u>. If the <b>video</b> or the <b>metadata</b> options are set, it
           switches to <u>verbose</u>.

       <b>peak</b>
           Set peak mode(s).

           Available modes can be cumulated (the option is a "flag" type). Possible values are:

           <b>none</b>
               Disable any peak mode (default).

           <b>sample</b>
               Enable sample-peak mode.

               Simple peak mode looking for  the  higher  sample  value.  It  logs  a  message  for  sample-peak
               (identified by "SPK").

           <b>true</b>
               Enable true-peak mode.

               If  enabled,  the  peak  lookup is done on an over-sampled version of the input stream for better
               peak accuracy. It logs a message for true-peak.  (identified by "TPK") and  true-peak  per  frame
               (identified by "FTPK").  This mode requires a build with "libswresample".

       <b>dualmono</b>
           Treat  mono  input  files as "dual mono". If a mono file is intended for playback on a stereo system,
           its EBU R128 measurement will be  perceptually  incorrect.   If  set  to  "true",  this  option  will
           compensate for this effect.  Multi-channel input files are not affected by this option.

       <b>panlaw</b>
           Set  a  specific  pan  law  to  be  used  for  the measurement of dual mono files.  This parameter is
           optional, and has a default value of -3.01dB.

       <b>target</b>
           Set a specific target level (in LUFS) used as relative zero in the visualization.  This parameter  is
           optional  and  has  a  default value of -23LUFS as specified by EBU R128. However, material published
           online may prefer a level of -16LUFS (e.g. for use with podcasts or video platforms).

       <b>gauge</b>
           Set the value displayed by the gauge. Valid values are "momentary" and s "shortterm". By default  the
           momentary  value  will  be  used, but in certain scenarios it may be more useful to observe the short
           term value instead (e.g.  live mixing).

       <b>scale</b>
           Sets the display scale for the loudness. Valid parameters are "absolute" (in LUFS) or "relative" (LU)
           relative to the target. This only affects the video output, not the summary or continuous log output.

       <b>integrated</b>
           Read-only exported value for measured integrated loudness, in LUFS.

       <b>range</b>
           Read-only exported value for measured loudness range, in LU.

       <b>lra_low</b>
           Read-only exported value for measured LRA low, in LUFS.

       <b>lra_high</b>
           Read-only exported value for measured LRA high, in LUFS.

       <b>sample_peak</b>
           Read-only exported value for measured sample peak, in dBFS.

       <b>true_peak</b>
           Read-only exported value for measured true peak, in dBFS.

       <u>Examples</u>

       •   Real-time graph using <b>ffplay</b>, with a EBU scale meter +18:

                   ffplay -f lavfi -i "amovie=input.mp3,ebur128=video=1:meter=18 [out0][out1]"

       •   Run an analysis with <b>ffmpeg</b>:

                   ffmpeg -nostats -i input.mp3 -filter_complex ebur128 -f null -

   <b>interleave,</b> <b>ainterleave</b>
       Temporally interleave frames from several inputs.

       "interleave" works with video inputs, "ainterleave" with audio.

       These filters read frames from several inputs and send the oldest queued frame to the output.

       Input streams must have well defined, monotonically increasing frame timestamp values.

       In order to submit one frame to output, these filters need to enqueue at least one frame for each  input,
       so they cannot work in case one input is not yet terminated and will not receive incoming frames.

       For  example  consider  the case when one input is a "select" filter which always drops input frames. The
       "interleave" filter will keep reading from that input, but it will never be able to send  new  frames  to
       output until the input sends an end-of-stream signal.

       Also,  depending  on inputs synchronization, the filters will drop frames in case one input receives more
       frames than the other ones, and the queue is already filled.

       These filters accept the following options:

       <b>nb_inputs,</b> <b>n</b>
           Set the number of different inputs, it is 2 by default.

       <b>duration</b>
           How to determine the end-of-stream.

           <b>longest</b>
               The duration of the longest input. (default)

           <b>shortest</b>
               The duration of the shortest input.

           <b>first</b>
               The duration of the first input.

       <u>Examples</u>

       •   Interleave frames belonging to different streams using <b>ffmpeg</b>:

                   ffmpeg -i bambi.avi -i pr0n.mkv -filter_complex "[0:v][1:v] interleave" out.avi

       •   Add flickering blur effect:

                   select='if(gt(<a href="../man0/random.0.html">random</a>(0), 0.2), 1, 2)':n=2 [tmp], boxblur=2:2, [tmp] interleave

   <b>latency,</b> <b>alatency</b>
       Measure filtering latency.

       Report previous filter filtering latency, delay in number of audio samples for audio filters or number of
       video frames for video filters.

       On end of input stream, filter will report min and max measured latency for previous  running  filter  in
       filtergraph.

   <b>metadata,</b> <b>ametadata</b>
       Manipulate frame metadata.

       This filter accepts the following options:

       <b>mode</b>
           Set mode of operation of the filter.

           Can be one of the following:

           <b>select</b>
               If  both  "value" and "key" is set, select frames which have such metadata. If only "key" is set,
               select every frame that has such key in metadata.

           <b>add</b> Add new metadata "key" and "value". If key is already available do nothing.

           <b>modify</b>
               Modify value of already present key.

           <b>delete</b>
               If "value" is set, delete only keys that have such value.  Otherwise, delete key. If "key" is not
               set, delete all metadata values in the frame.

           <b>print</b>
               Print key and its value if metadata was found. If "key" is not  set  print  all  metadata  values
               available in frame.

       <b>key</b> Set key used with all modes. Must be set for all modes except "print" and "delete".

       <b>value</b>
           Set metadata value which will be used. This option is mandatory for "modify" and "add" mode.

       <b>function</b>
           Which function to use when comparing metadata value and "value".

           Can be one of following:

           <b>same_str</b>
               Values are interpreted as strings, returns true if metadata value is same as "value".

           <b>starts_with</b>
               Values  are interpreted as strings, returns true if metadata value starts with the "value" option
               string.

           <b>less</b>
               Values are interpreted as floats, returns true if metadata value is less than "value".

           <b>equal</b>
               Values are interpreted as floats, returns true if "value" is equal with metadata value.

           <b>greater</b>
               Values are interpreted as floats, returns true if metadata value is greater than "value".

           <b>expr</b>
               Values are interpreted as floats, returns true if expression  from  option  "expr"  evaluates  to
               true.

           <b>ends_with</b>
               Values  are  interpreted  as strings, returns true if metadata value ends with the "value" option
               string.

       <b>expr</b>
           Set expression which is used when "function" is set to "expr".  The expression is  evaluated  through
           the eval API and can contain the following constants:

           <b>VALUE1,</b> <b>FRAMEVAL</b>
               Float representation of "value" from metadata key.

           <b>VALUE2,</b> <b>USERVAL</b>
               Float representation of "value" as supplied by user in "value" option.

       <b>file</b>
           If  specified  in  "print"  mode,  output is written to the named file. Instead of plain filename any
           writable url can be specified. Filename ``-'' is a shorthand for standard output. If "file" option is
           not set, output is written to the log with AV_LOG_INFO loglevel.

       <b>direct</b>
           Reduces buffering in print mode when output is written to a URL set using <u>file</u>.

       <u>Examples</u>

       •   Print all metadata values for frames with key "lavfi.signalstats.YDIF" with values between 0 and 1.

                   signalstats,metadata=print:key=lavfi.signalstats.YDIF:value=0:function=expr:expr='between(VALUE1,0,1)'

       •   Print silencedetect output to file <u>metadata.txt</u>.

                   silencedetect,ametadata=mode=print:file=metadata.txt

       •   Direct all metadata to a pipe with file descriptor 4.

                   metadata=mode=print:file='pipe\:4'

   <b>perms,</b> <b>aperms</b>
       Set read/write permissions for the output frames.

       These filters are mainly aimed at developers  to  test  direct  path  in  the  following  filter  in  the
       filtergraph.

       The filters accept the following options:

       <b>mode</b>
           Select the permissions mode.

           It accepts the following values:

           <b>none</b>
               Do nothing. This is the default.

           <b>ro</b>  Set all the output frames read-only.

           <b>rw</b>  Set all the output frames directly writable.

           <b>toggle</b>
               Make the frame read-only if writable, and writable if read-only.

           <b>random</b>
               Set each output frame read-only or writable randomly.

       <b>seed</b>
           Set  the  seed  for  the  <u>random</u> mode, must be an integer included between 0 and "UINT32_MAX". If not
           specified, or if explicitly set to -1, the filter will try to use a good random seed on a best effort
           basis.

       Note: in case of auto-inserted filter between the permission filter and the following one, the permission
       might not be received as expected in that following filter. Inserting a <b>format</b> or <b>aformat</b>  filter  before
       the perms/aperms filter can avoid this problem.

   <b>realtime,</b> <b>arealtime</b>
       Slow down filtering to match real time approximately.

       These  filters  will  pause the filtering for a variable amount of time to match the output rate with the
       input timestamps.  They are similar to the <b>re</b> option to "ffmpeg".

       They accept the following options:

       <b>limit</b>
           Time limit for the pauses. Any pause longer than that will be considered  a  timestamp  discontinuity
           and reset the timer. Default is 2 seconds.

       <b>speed</b>
           Speed factor for processing. The value must be a float larger than zero.  Values larger than 1.0 will
           result  in  faster  than  realtime  processing,  smaller  will  slow  processing  down.  The <u>limit</u> is
           automatically adapted accordingly. Default is 1.0.

           A processing speed faster than what is possible without these filters cannot be achieved.

       <u>Commands</u>

       Both filters supports the all above options as <b>commands</b>.

   <b>segment,</b> <b>asegment</b>
       Split single input stream into multiple streams.

       This filter does opposite of concat filters.

       "segment" works on video frames, "asegment" on audio samples.

       This filter accepts the following options:

       <b>timestamps</b>
           Timestamps of output segments separated by '|'. The first segment will run from the beginning of  the
           input stream. The last segment will run until the end of the input stream

       <b>frames,</b> <b>samples</b>
           Exact frame/sample count to split the segments.

       In all cases, prefixing an each segment with '+' will make it relative to the previous segment.

       <u>Examples</u>

       •   Split input audio stream into three output audio streams, starting at start of input audio stream and
           storing that in 1st output audio stream, then following at 60th second and storing than in 2nd output
           audio stream, and last after 150th second of input audio stream store in 3rd output audio stream:

                   asegment=timestamps="60|150"

   <b>select,</b> <b>aselect</b>
       Select frames to pass in output.

       This filter accepts the following options:

       <b>expr,</b> <b>e</b>
           Set expression, which is evaluated for each input frame.

           If the expression is evaluated to zero, the frame is discarded.

           If  the  evaluation result is negative or NaN, the frame is sent to the first output; otherwise it is
           sent to the output with index "ceil(val)-1", assuming that the input index starts from 0.

           For example a value of 1.2 corresponds to the output with index "ceil(1.2)-1 = 2-1 = 1", that is  the
           second output.

       <b>outputs,</b> <b>n</b>
           Set  the  number of outputs. The output to which to send the selected frame is based on the result of
           the evaluation. Default value is 1.

       The expression can contain the following constants:

       <b>n</b>   The (sequential) number of the filtered frame, starting from 0.

       <b>selected_n</b>
           The (sequential) number of the selected frame, starting from 0.

       <b>prev_selected_n</b>
           The sequential number of the last selected frame. It's NAN if undefined.

       <b>TB</b>  The timebase of the input timestamps.

       <b>pts</b> The PTS (Presentation TimeStamp) of the filtered frame, expressed in <u>TB</u> units. It's NAN if undefined.

       <b>t</b>   The PTS of the filtered frame, expressed in seconds. It's NAN if undefined.

       <b>prev_pts</b>
           The PTS of the previously filtered frame. It's NAN if undefined.

       <b>prev_selected_pts</b>
           The PTS of the last previously filtered frame. It's NAN if undefined.

       <b>prev_selected_t</b>
           The PTS of the last previously selected frame, expressed in seconds. It's NAN if undefined.

       <b>start_pts</b>
           The first PTS in the stream which is not NAN. It remains NAN if not found.

       <b>start_t</b>
           The first PTS, in seconds, in the stream which is not NAN. It remains NAN if not found.

       <b>pict_type</b> <u>(video</u> <u>only)</u>
           The type of the filtered frame. It can assume one of the following values:

           <b>I</b>
           <b>P</b>
           <b>B</b>
           <b>S</b>
           <b>SI</b>
           <b>SP</b>
           <b>BI</b>
       <b>interlace_type</b> <u>(video</u> <u>only)</u>
           The frame interlace type. It can assume one of the following values:

           <b>PROGRESSIVE</b>
               The frame is progressive (not interlaced).

           <b>TOPFIRST</b>
               The frame is top-field-first.

           <b>BOTTOMFIRST</b>
               The frame is bottom-field-first.

       <b>consumed_sample_n</b> <u>(audio</u> <u>only)</u>
           the number of selected samples before the current frame

       <b>samples_n</b> <u>(audio</u> <u>only)</u>
           the number of samples in the current frame

       <b>sample_rate</b> <u>(audio</u> <u>only)</u>
           the input sample rate

       <b>key</b> This is 1 if the filtered frame is a key-frame, 0 otherwise.

       <b>pos</b> the position in the file of the filtered frame, -1 if the information  is  not  available  (e.g.  for
           synthetic video); deprecated, do not use

       <b>scene</b> <u>(video</u> <u>only)</u>
           value between 0 and 1 to indicate a new scene; a low value reflects a low probability for the current
           frame to introduce a new scene, while a higher value means the current frame is more likely to be one
           (see the example below)

       <b>concatdec_select</b>
           The concat demuxer can select only part of a concat input file by setting an inpoint and an outpoint,
           but  the  output  packets  may  not  be  entirely  contained  in the selected interval. By using this
           variable, it is possible to skip frames generated  by  the  concat  demuxer  which  are  not  exactly
           contained in the selected interval.

           This works by comparing the frame pts against the <u>lavf.concat.start_time</u> and the <u>lavf.concat.duration</u>
           packet metadata values which are also present in the decoded frames.

           The  <u>concatdec_select</u>  variable is -1 if the frame pts is at least start_time and either the duration
           metadata is missing or the frame pts is less than start_time + duration, 0 otherwise, and NaN if  the
           start_time metadata is missing.

           That  basically  means  that  an input frame is selected if its pts is within the interval set by the
           concat demuxer.

       <b>iw</b> <u>(video</u> <u>only)</u>
           Represents the width of the input video frame.

       <b>ih</b> <u>(video</u> <u>only)</u>
           Represents the height of the input video frame.

       <b>view</b> <u>(video</u> <u>only)</u>
           View ID for multi-view video.

       The default value of the select expression is "1".

       <u>Examples</u>

       •   Select all frames in input:

                   select

           The example above is the same as:

                   select=1

       •   Skip all frames:

                   select=0

       •   Select only I-frames:

                   select='eq(pict_type\,I)'

       •   Select one frame every 100:

                   select='not(mod(n\,100))'

       •   Select only frames contained in the 10-20 time interval:

                   select=between(t\,10\,20)

       •   Select only I-frames contained in the 10-20 time interval:

                   select=between(t\,10\,20)*eq(pict_type\,I)

       •   Select frames with a minimum distance of 10 seconds:

                   select='isnan(prev_selected_t)+gte(t-prev_selected_t\,10)'

       •   Use aselect to select only audio frames with samples number &gt; 100:

                   aselect='gt(samples_n\,100)'

       •   Create a mosaic of the first scenes:

                   ffmpeg -i video.avi -vf select='gt(scene\,0.4)',scale=160:120,tile -frames:v 1 preview.png

           Comparing <u>scene</u> against a value between 0.3 and 0.5 is generally a sane choice.

       •   Send even and odd frames to separate outputs, and compose them:

                   select=n=2:e='mod(n, 2)+1' [odd][even]; [odd] pad=h=2*ih [tmp]; [tmp][even] overlay=y=h

       •   Select useful frames from an ffconcat file which is using inpoints and outpoints but where the source
           files are not intra frame only.

                   ffmpeg -copyts -vsync 0 -segment_time_metadata 1 -i input.ffconcat -vf select=concatdec_select -af aselect=concatdec_select output.avi

   <b>sendcmd,</b> <b>asendcmd</b>
       Send commands to filters in the filtergraph.

       These filters read commands to be sent to other filters in the filtergraph.

       "sendcmd" must be inserted between two video filters, "asendcmd"  must  be  inserted  between  two  audio
       filters, but apart from that they act the same way.

       The  specification  of commands can be provided in the filter arguments with the <u>commands</u> option, or in a
       file specified by the <u>filename</u> option.

       These filters accept the following options:

       <b>commands,</b> <b>c</b>
           Set the commands to be read and sent to the other filters.

       <b>filename,</b> <b>f</b>
           Set the filename of the commands to be read and sent to the other filters.

       <u>Commands</u> <u>syntax</u>

       A commands description consists of a sequence of interval specifications, comprising a list  of  commands
       to  be executed when a particular event related to that interval occurs. The occurring event is typically
       the current frame time entering or leaving a given time interval.

       An interval is specified by the following syntax:

               &lt;START&gt;[-&lt;END&gt;] &lt;COMMANDS&gt;;

       The time interval is specified by the <u>START</u> and <u>END</u> times.  <u>END</u> is optional and defaults to  the  maximum
       time.

       The  current  frame  time  is  considered within the specified interval if it is included in the interval
       [<u>START</u>, <u>END</u>), that is when the time is greater or equal to <u>START</u> and is lesser than <u>END</u>.

       <u>COMMANDS</u> consists of a sequence of one or more command specifications, separated by ",", relating to that
       interval.  The syntax of a command specification is given by:

               [&lt;FLAGS&gt;] &lt;TARGET&gt; &lt;COMMAND&gt; &lt;ARG&gt;

       <u>FLAGS</u> is optional and specifies the type of events relating to the time interval which enable sending the
       specified command, and must be a non-null sequence of identifier  flags  separated  by  "+"  or  "|"  and
       enclosed between "[" and "]".

       The following flags are recognized:

       <b>enter</b>
           The  command  is sent when the current frame timestamp enters the specified interval. In other words,
           the command is sent when the previous frame timestamp was not in the given interval, and the  current
           is.

       <b>leave</b>
           The  command  is sent when the current frame timestamp leaves the specified interval. In other words,
           the command is sent when the previous frame timestamp was in the given interval, and the  current  is
           not.

       <b>expr</b>
           The command <u>ARG</u> is interpreted as expression and result of expression is passed as <u>ARG</u>.

           The expression is evaluated through the eval API and can contain the following constants:

           <b>POS</b> Original  position  in  the  file  of the frame, or undefined if undefined for the current frame.
               Deprecated, do not use.

           <b>PTS</b> The presentation timestamp in input.

           <b>N</b>   The count of the input frame for video or audio, starting from 0.

           <b>T</b>   The time in seconds of the current frame.

           <b>TS</b>  The start time in seconds of the current command interval.

           <b>TE</b>  The end time in seconds of the current command interval.

           <b>TI</b>  The interpolated time of the current command interval, TI = (T - TS) / (TE - TS).

           <b>W</b>   The video frame width.

           <b>H</b>   The video frame height.

       If <u>FLAGS</u> is not specified, a default value of "[enter]" is assumed.

       <u>TARGET</u> specifies the target of the command, usually the name of the filter class  or  a  specific  filter
       instance name.

       <u>COMMAND</u> specifies the name of the command for the target filter.

       <u>ARG</u> is optional and specifies the optional list of argument for the given <u>COMMAND</u>.

       Between one interval specification and another, whitespaces, or sequences of characters starting with "#"
       until the end of line, are ignored and can be used to annotate comments.

       A simplified BNF description of the commands specification syntax follows:

               &lt;COMMAND_FLAG&gt;  ::= "enter" | "leave"
               &lt;COMMAND_FLAGS&gt; ::= &lt;COMMAND_FLAG&gt; [(+|"|")&lt;COMMAND_FLAG&gt;]
               &lt;COMMAND&gt;       ::= ["[" &lt;COMMAND_FLAGS&gt; "]"] &lt;TARGET&gt; &lt;COMMAND&gt; [&lt;ARG&gt;]
               &lt;COMMANDS&gt;      ::= &lt;COMMAND&gt; [,&lt;COMMANDS&gt;]
               &lt;INTERVAL&gt;      ::= &lt;START&gt;[-&lt;END&gt;] &lt;COMMANDS&gt;
               &lt;INTERVALS&gt;     ::= &lt;INTERVAL&gt;[;&lt;INTERVALS&gt;]

       <u>Examples</u>

       •   Specify audio tempo change at second 4:

                   asendcmd=c='4.0 atempo tempo 1.5',atempo

       •   Target a specific filter instance:

                   asendcmd=c='4.0 atempo@my tempo 1.5',atempo@my

       •   Specify a list of drawtext and hue commands in a file.

                   # show text in the interval 5-10
                   5.0-10.0 [enter] drawtext reinit 'fontfile=FreeSerif.ttf:text=hello world',
                            [leave] drawtext reinit 'fontfile=FreeSerif.ttf:text=';

                   # desaturate the image in the interval 15-20
                   15.0-20.0 [enter] hue s 0,
                             [enter] drawtext reinit 'fontfile=FreeSerif.ttf:text=nocolor',
                             [leave] hue s 1,
                             [leave] drawtext reinit 'fontfile=FreeSerif.ttf:text=color';

                   # apply an exponential saturation fade-out effect, starting from time 25
                   25 [enter] hue s exp(25-t)

           A  filtergraph  allowing to read and process the above command list stored in a file <u>test.cmd</u>, can be
           specified with:

                   sendcmd=f=test.cmd,drawtext=fontfile=FreeSerif.ttf:text='',hue

   <b>setpts,</b> <b>asetpts</b>
       Change the PTS (presentation timestamp) of the input frames.

       "setpts" works on video frames, "asetpts" on audio frames.

       This filter accepts the following options:

       <b>expr</b>
           The expression which is evaluated for each frame to construct its timestamp.

       The expression is evaluated through the eval API and can contain the following constants:

       <b>FRAME_RATE,</b> <b>FR</b>
           frame rate, only defined for constant frame-rate video

       <b>PTS</b> The presentation timestamp in input

       <b>TB</b>  The timebase of the input timestamps.

       <b>T_CHANGE</b>
           Time of the first frame after command was applied or time of the first frame if no commands.

       <u>Examples</u>

       •   Start counting PTS from zero

                   setpts=PTS-STARTPTS

       •   Apply fast motion effect:

                   setpts=0.5*PTS

       •   Apply slow motion effect:

                   setpts=2.0*PTS

       •   Generate timestamps from a "live source" and rebase onto the current timebase:

                   setpts='(RTCTIME - RTCSTART) / (TB * 1000000)'

       •   Generate timestamps by counting samples:

                   asetpts=N/SR/TB

       <u>Commands</u>

       Both filters support all above options as <b>commands</b>.

   <b>setrange</b>
       Force color range for the output video frame.

       The "setrange" filter marks the color range property for the output frames. It does not change the  input
       frame,  but  only  sets  the  corresponding property, which affects how the frame is treated by following
       filters.

       The filter accepts the following options:

       <b>range</b>
           Available values are:

           <b>auto</b>
               Keep the same color range property.

           <b>unspecified,</b> <b>unknown</b>
               Set the color range as unspecified.

           <b>limited,</b> <b>tv,</b> <b>mpeg</b>
               Set the color range as limited.

           <b>full,</b> <b>pc,</b> <b>jpeg</b>
               Set the color range as full.

   <b>settb,</b> <b>asettb</b>
       Set the timebase to use for the output frames timestamps.  It  is  mainly  useful  for  testing  timebase
       configuration.

       It accepts the following parameters:

       <b>expr,</b> <b>tb</b>
           The expression which is evaluated into the output timebase.

       The  value  for  <b>tb</b>  is  an arithmetic expression representing a rational. The expression can contain the
       constants "AVTB" (the default timebase), "intb" (the input timebase) and "sr"  (the  sample  rate,  audio
       only). Default value is "intb".

       <u>Examples</u>

       •   Set the timebase to 1/25:

                   settb=expr=1/25

       •   Set the timebase to 1/10:

                   settb=expr=0.1

       •   Set the timebase to 1001/1000:

                   settb=1+0.001

       •   Set the timebase to 2*intb:

                   settb=2*intb

       •   Set the default timebase value:

                   settb=AVTB

   <b>showcqt</b>
       Convert  input  audio  to  a  video  output  representing frequency spectrum logarithmically using Brown-
       Puckette constant Q transform algorithm with direct frequency domain  coefficient  calculation  (but  the
       transform  itself  is  not  really  constant  Q, instead the Q factor is actually variable/clamped), with
       musical tone scale, from E0 to D#10.

       The filter accepts the following options:

       <b>size,</b> <b>s</b>
           Specify the video size for the output. It must be even. For the syntax  of  this  option,  check  the
           <b>"Video</b> <b>size"</b> <b>section</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ffmpeg-utils</b> <b>manual</b>.  Default value is "1920x1080".

       This filter accepts the following options:

       <b>mode</b>
           Set mode of operation of the filter.

           Can be one of the following:

           <b>select</b>
               Select every frame with side data of "type".

           <b>delete</b>
               Delete side data of "type". If "type" is not set, delete all side data in the frame.

       <b>type</b>
           Set side data type used with all modes. Must be set for "select" mode. For the  list  of  frame  side
           data  types,  refer  to  the  "AVFrameSideDataType" enum in <u>libavutil/frame.h</u>. For example, to choose
           "AV_FRAME_DATA_PANSCAN" side data, you must specify "PANSCAN".

   <b>spectrumsynth</b>
       Synthesize audio from 2 input video spectrums, first input stream represents magnitude  across  time  and
       second  represents  phase  across  time.  The filter will transform from frequency domain as displayed in
       videos back to time domain as presented in audio output.

       This filter is primarily created for reversing processed <b>showspectrum</b> filter outputs, but can  synthesize
       sound  from  other  spectrograms too.  But in such case results are going to be poor if the phase data is
       not available, because in such cases phase data need to be recreated, usually it's  just  recreated  from
       random  noise.   For  best results use gray only output ("channel" color mode in <b>showspectrum</b> filter) and
       "log" scale for magnitude video and "lin" scale for phase video. To produce phase,  for  2nd  video,  use
       "data"  option.  Inputs videos should generally use "fullframe" slide mode as that saves resources needed
       for decoding video.

       The filter accepts the following options:

       <b>sample_rate</b>
           Specify sample rate of output audio, the sample rate of audio from which spectrum was  generated  may
           differ.

       <b>channels</b>
           Set number of channels represented in input video spectrums.

       <b>scale</b>
           Set scale which was used when generating magnitude input spectrum.  Can be "lin" or "log". Default is
           "log".

       <b>slide</b>
           Set  slide  which was used when generating inputs spectrums.  Can be "replace", "scroll", "fullframe"
           or "rscroll".  Default is "fullframe".

       <b>win_func</b>
           Set window function used for resynthesis.

       <b>overlap</b>
           Set window overlap. In range "[0, 1]". Default is 1, which means optimal overlap for selected  window
           function will be picked.

       <b>orientation</b>
           Set orientation of input videos. Can be "vertical" or "horizontal".  Default is "vertical".

       <u>Examples</u>

       •   First  create magnitude and phase videos from audio, assuming audio is stereo with 44100 sample rate,
           then resynthesize videos back to audio with spectrumsynth:

                   ffmpeg -i input.flac -lavfi showspectrum=mode=separate:scale=log:overlap=0.875:color=channel:slide=fullframe:data=magnitude -an -c:v rawvideo magnitude.nut
                   ffmpeg -i input.flac -lavfi showspectrum=mode=separate:scale=lin:overlap=0.875:color=channel:slide=fullframe:data=phase -an -c:v rawvideo phase.nut
                   ffmpeg -i magnitude.nut -i phase.nut -lavfi spectrumsynth=channels=2:sample_rate=44100:win_func=hann:overlap=0.875:slide=fullframe output.flac

   <b>split,</b> <b>asplit</b>
       Split input into several identical outputs.

       "asplit" works with audio input, "split" with video.

       The filter accepts a single parameter which specifies the number of outputs. If unspecified, it  defaults
       to 2.

       <u>Examples</u>

       •   Create two separate outputs from the same input:

                   [in] split [out0][out1]

       •   To create 3 or more outputs, you need to specify the number of outputs, like in:

                   [in] asplit=3 [out0][out1][out2]

       •   Create two separate outputs from the same input, one cropped and one padded:

                   [in] split [splitout1][splitout2];
                   [splitout1] crop=100:100:0:0    [cropout];
                   [splitout2] pad=200:200:100:100 [padout];

       •   Create 5 copies of the input audio with <b>ffmpeg</b>:

                   ffmpeg -i INPUT -filter_complex asplit=5 OUTPUT

   <b>zmq,</b> <b>azmq</b>
       Receive commands sent through a libzmq client, and forward them to filters in the filtergraph.

       "zmq" and "azmq" work as a pass-through filters. "zmq" must be inserted between two video filters, "azmq"
       between two audio filters. Both are capable to send messages to any filter type.

       To  enable  these  filters  you  need to install the libzmq library and headers and configure FFmpeg with
       "--enable-libzmq".

       For more information about libzmq see: &lt;<b><a href="http://www.zeromq.org/">http://www.zeromq.org/</a></b>&gt;

       The "zmq" and "azmq" filters work as a libzmq server, which receives  messages  sent  through  a  network
       interface  defined by the <b>bind_address</b> (or the abbreviation "<b>b</b>") option.  Default value of this option is
       <u>tcp://localhost:5555</u>. You may want to alter this value to your needs, but do not forget to escape any ':'
       signs (see <b>filtergraph</b> <b>escaping</b>).

       The received message must be in the form:

               &lt;TARGET&gt; &lt;COMMAND&gt; [&lt;ARG&gt;]

       <u>TARGET</u> specifies the target of the command, usually the name of the filter class  or  a  specific  filter
       instance  name.  The  default filter instance name uses the pattern <b>Parsed_&lt;filter_name&gt;_&lt;index&gt;</b>, but you
       can override this by using the <b>filter_name@id</b> syntax (see <b>Filtergraph</b> <b>syntax</b>).

       <u>COMMAND</u> specifies the name of the command for the target filter.

       <u>ARG</u> is optional and specifies the optional argument list for the given <u>COMMAND</u>.

       Upon reception, the message is processed and the corresponding command is injected into the  filtergraph.
       Depending on the result, the filter will send a reply to the client, adopting the format:

               &lt;ERROR_CODE&gt; &lt;ERROR_REASON&gt;
               &lt;MESSAGE&gt;

       <u>MESSAGE</u> is optional.

       <u>Examples</u>

       Look  at  <u>tools/zmqsend</u>  for  an  example of a zmq client which can be used to send commands processed by
       these filters.

       Consider the following filtergraph generated by <b>ffplay</b>.  In this example the last overlay filter  has  an
       instance name. All other filters will have default instance names.

               ffplay -dumpgraph 1 -f lavfi "
               color=s=100x100:c=red  [l];
               color=s=100x100:c=blue [r];
               nullsrc=s=200x100, zmq [bg];
               [bg][l]   overlay     [bg+l];
               [bg+l][r] overlay@my=x=100 "

       To change the color of the left side of the video, the following command can be used:

               echo Parsed_color_0 c yellow | tools/zmqsend

       To change the right side:

               echo Parsed_color_1 c pink | tools/zmqsend

       To change the position of the right side:

               echo overlay@my x 150 | tools/zmqsend

       Below is a description of the currently available multimedia sources.

   <b>amovie</b>
       This is the same as <b>movie</b> source, except it selects an audio stream by default.

   <b>avsynctest</b>
       Generate an Audio/Video Sync Test.

       Generated  stream  periodically  shows  flash video frame and emits beep in audio.  Useful to inspect A/V
       sync issues.

       It accepts the following options:

       <b>size,</b> <b>s</b>
           Set output video size. Default value is "hd720".

       <b>framerate,</b> <b>fr</b>
           Set output video frame rate. Default value is 30.

       <b>samplerate,</b> <b>sr</b>
           Set output audio sample rate. Default value is 44100.

       <b>amplitude,</b> <b>a</b>
           Set output audio beep amplitude. Default value is 0.7.

       <b>period,</b> <b>p</b>
           Set output audio beep period in seconds. Default value is 3.

       <b>delay,</b> <b>dl</b>
           Set output video flash delay in number of frames. Default value is 0.

       <b>cycle,</b> <b>c</b>
           Enable cycling of video delays, by default is disabled.

       <b>fg,</b> <b>bg,</b> <b>ag</b>
           Set foreground/background/additional color.

       <u>Commands</u>

       This source supports the some above options as <b>commands</b>.

   <b>movie</b>
       Read audio and/or video stream(s) from a movie container.

       It accepts the following parameters:

       <b>filename</b>
           The name of the resource to read (not necessarily a file; it  can  also  be  a  device  or  a  stream
           accessed through some protocol).

       <b>format_name,</b> <b>f</b>
           Specifies  the  format assumed for the movie to read, and can be either the name of a container or an
           input device. If not specified, the format is guessed from <u>movie_name</u> or by probing.

       <b>seek_point,</b> <b>sp</b>
           Specifies the seek point in seconds. The frames will be output starting from  this  seek  point.  The
           parameter is evaluated with "av_strtod", so the numerical value may be suffixed by an IS postfix. The
           default value is "0".

       <b>streams,</b> <b>s</b>
           Specifies  the  streams  to read. Several streams can be specified, separated by "+". The source will
           then have as many outputs, in the same order. The syntax is  explained  in  the  <b>"Stream</b>  <b>specifiers"</b>
           <b>section</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ffmpeg</b> <b>manual</b>. Two special names, "dv" and "da" specify respectively the default (best
           suited) video and audio stream. Default is "dv", or "da" if the filter is called as "amovie".

       <b>stream_index,</b> <b>si</b>
           Specifies  the  index of the video stream to read. If the value is -1, the most suitable video stream
           will be automatically selected. The default value is  "-1".  Deprecated.  If  the  filter  is  called
           "amovie", it will select audio instead of video.

       <b>loop</b>
           Specifies  how  many  times  to  read  the stream in sequence.  If the value is 0, the stream will be
           looped infinitely.  Default value is "1".

           Note that when the movie is looped the source timestamps are not changed, so  it  will  generate  non
           monotonically increasing timestamps.

       <b>discontinuity</b>
           Specifies  the  time  difference  between  frames  above  which  the  point is considered a timestamp
           discontinuity which is removed by adjusting the later timestamps.

       <b>dec_threads</b>
           Specifies the number of threads for decoding

       <b>format_opts</b>
           Specify format options for the opened file. Format options can be specified as a  list  of  <u>key</u>=<u>value</u>
           pairs   separated   by   ':'.   The  following  example  shows  how  to  add  protocol_whitelist  and
           protocol_blacklist options:

                   ffplay -f lavfi
                   "movie=filename='1.sdp':format_opts='protocol_whitelist=file,rtp,udp\:protocol_blacklist=http'"

       It allows overlaying a second video on top of the main input of a filtergraph, as shown in this graph:

               input -----------&gt; deltapts0 --&gt; overlay --&gt; output
                                                   ^
                                                   |
               movie --&gt; scale--&gt; deltapts1 -------+

       <u>Examples</u>

       •   Skip 3.2 seconds from the start of the AVI file in.avi, and overlay it on top of the  input  labelled
           "in":

                   movie=in.avi:seek_point=3.2, scale=180:-1, setpts=PTS-STARTPTS [over];
                   [in] setpts=PTS-STARTPTS [main];
                   [main][over] overlay=16:16 [out]

       •   Read from a video4linux2 device, and overlay it on top of the input labelled "in":

                   movie=/dev/video0:f=video4linux2, scale=180:-1, setpts=PTS-STARTPTS [over];
                   [in] setpts=PTS-STARTPTS [main];
                   [main][over] overlay=16:16 [out]

       •   Read the first video stream and the audio stream with id 0x81 from dvd.vob; the video is connected to
           the pad named "video" and the audio is connected to the pad named "audio":

                   movie=dvd.vob:s=v:0+#0x81 [video] [audio]

       <u>Commands</u>

       Both movie and amovie support the following commands:

       <b>seek</b>
           Perform seek using "av_seek_frame".  The syntax is: seek <u>stream_index</u>|<u>timestamp</u>|<u>flags</u>

           •   <u>stream_index</u>: If stream_index is -1, a default stream is selected, and <u>timestamp</u> is automatically
               converted from AV_TIME_BASE units to the stream specific time_base.

           •   <u>timestamp</u>:  Timestamp  in AVStream.time_base units or, if no stream is specified, in AV_TIME_BASE
               units.

           •   <u>flags</u>: Flags which select direction and seeking mode.

       <b>get_duration</b>
           Get movie duration in AV_TIME_BASE units.
