       elk, scheme-elk - extensible Scheme interpreter

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>elk</b> [ <b>-l</b> <u>file</u> ] [ <b>-h</b> <u>KBytes</u> ] [ <b>-p</b> <u>load-path</u> ] [ <b>-g</b> ] [ <b>-i</b> ] [ <b>-v</b> <u>type</u> ] [[ <b>--</b> ] <u>args</u>]

       <b>elk</b>...

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Elk</u>  (Extension  Language  Kit)  is  a Scheme implementation designed as a general extension language for
       applications written in C or C++.  Normally, <u>Elk</u> is linked with the application it serves, but  a  stand-
       alone  version  of  the  Scheme  interpreter  is  installed  as  well (usually under the name <b>elk</b>).  This
       interpreter, together with the standard Scheme toplevel, <u>Elk</u> can be  used  as  an  ordinary,  stand-alone
       implementation of the Scheme language.

       When  called  without  the  <b>-l</b> option, <u>Elk</u> loads the standard “toplevel” to start an interactive session.
       When called with <b>-l</b> <u>file</u>, the contents of the specified file is loaded instead.  If a `-' is given  as  a
       filename argument, <u>Elk</u> loads from standard input.

       The  option  <b>-p</b>  <u>load-path</u>  can  be  used  to  override the standard <u>load-path</u>.  The argument is a colon-
       separated list of directories.  If this option is not present and the environment  variable  ELK_LOADPATH
       is  defined,  the  value of this variable is used to initialize the <u>load-path</u>.  The value of ELK_LOADPATH
       has the same format as the argument to the <b>-p</b> option.

       The <b>-h</b> <u>KBytes</u> option is used to specify a non-standard heap size.  The default heap size is 512 KBytes.

       If the option <b>-i</b> is specified, symbols are mapped to lower case.  Normally, <u>Elk</u> is case-sensitive.

       The <b>-g</b> option causes the interpreter to run the garbage collector each time memory is  allocated  on  the
       heap.   This  is  useful  for  writers  of extensions who want to test the garbage collect behavior of an
       extension.  Running <u>Elk</u> with the <b>-g</b> option is likely to reveal GC-related bugs in extensions (such as not
       properly protected local objects), as it triggers a garbage collection each time an object  is  allocated
       on the Scheme heap.  A dot is written to standard output each time a garbage collection is performed when
       <b>-g</b> has been specified.

       When  called  with  one  or  more  <b>-v</b>  <u>type</u>  (``verbose'')  options,  the  interpreter  prints additional
       informational messages to standard output, depending on the value of the <u>type</u> argument.  If <u>type</u> is <u>load</u>,
       the linker command and options are printed each time an object file is loaded; if <u>type</u> is <u>init</u>, the names
       of extension initialization and finalization functions are printed as they are called.

       The remaining <u>args</u> are put into a list of strings, and the Scheme variable <b>command-line-args</b> is bound  to
       this  list  in the global environment.  If arguments could be interpreted as options, `--´ can be used to
       indicate the end of the options.
