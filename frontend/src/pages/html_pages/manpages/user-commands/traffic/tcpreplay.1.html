</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       <b>tcpreplay</b> - Replay network traffic stored in pcap files

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>tcpreplay</b> [<b>-flags</b>] [<b>-flag</b> [<u>value</u>]] [<b>--option-name</b>[[=| ]<u>value</u>]] &lt;pcap_file(s)&gt; | &lt;pcap_dir(s)&gt;

       tcpreplay  is  a  tool  for  replaying network traffic from files saved with tcpdump or other tools which
       write <a href="../man3/pcap.3.html">pcap</a>(3) files.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The basic operation of tcpreplay is to resend  all  packets  from  the input  file(s)  at  the  speed  at
       which they were recorded, or a specified data rate, up to as fast as the hardware is capable.

       Optionally,  the  traffic  can  be split between two interfaces, written to files, filtered and edited in
       various ways, providing the means to test firewalls, NIDS and other network devices.

       For more details, please see the Tcpreplay Manual at: <a href="http://tcpreplay.appneta.com">http://tcpreplay.appneta.com</a>

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-d</b> <u>number</u>, <b>--dbug</b>=<u>number</u> Enable debugging output.  This option may appear up to 1 times.  This option
       takes an integer number as its argument.  The value of <u>number</u> is constrained to being:
           in the range  0 through 5
       The default <u>number</u> for this option is:
            0

       If configured with --enable-debug, then you can specify a verbosity level for debugging output.  Higher
       numbers increase verbosity.

       <b>-q</b>, <b>--quiet</b> Quiet mode.

       Print nothing except the statistics at the end of the run

       <b>-T</b> <u>string</u>, <b>--timer</b>=<u>string</u> Select packet timing mode: select, ioport, gtod, nano.  This option may appear
       up to 1 times.  The default <u>string</u> for this option is:
            gtod

       Allows you to select the packet timing method to use:

       <u>nano</u> - Use nanosleep() API

       <u>select</u> - Use select() API

       <u>ioport</u> - Write to the i386 IO Port 0x80

       <u>gtod</u> <u>[default]</u> - Use a gettimeofday() loop

       <b>--maxsleep</b>=<u>number</u> Sleep for no more then X milliseconds between packets.  This option takes an integer
       number as its argument.  The default <u>number</u> for this option is:
            0

       Set a limit for the maximum number of milliseconds that tcpreplay will sleep between packets.
       Effectively prevents long delays between packets without effecting the majority of packets.  Default is
       disabled.

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b> Print decoded packets via tcpdump to STDOUT.  This option may appear up to 1 times.

       <b>-A</b> <u>string</u>, <b>--decode</b>=<u>string</u> Arguments passed to tcpdump decoder.  This option may appear up to 1 times.
       This option must appear in combination with the following options: verbose.

       When enabling verbose mode (<b>-v</b>) you may also specify one or more additional  arguments to pass to <b>tcpdump</b>
       to modify the way packets are decoded.  By default, -n and -l are used.   Be  sure  to quote the
       arguments like: -A "-axxx" so that they are not interpreted by tcpreplay.   Please see the <a href="../man1/tcpdump.1.html">tcpdump</a>(1) man
       page for a complete list of options.

       <b>-K</b>, <b>--preload-pcap</b> Preloads packets into RAM before sending.

       This option loads the specified pcap(s) into RAM before starting to send in order to improve replay
       performance while introducing a startup performance hit.  Preloading can be used with or without <b>--loop</b>.
       This option also suppresses flow statistics collection for every iteration, which can significantly
       reduce memory usage. Flow statistics are predicted based on options supplied and statistics collected
       from the first loop iteration.

       <b>-c</b> <u>string</u>, <b>--cachefile</b>=<u>string</u> Split traffic via a tcpprep cache file.  This option may appear up to 1
       times.  This option must appear in combination with the following options: intf2.  This option must not
       appear in combination with any of the following options: dualfile.

       If you have a pcap file you would like to use to send bi-directional traffic through a device (firewall,
       router, IDS, etc) then using tcpprep you can create a cachefile which tcpreplay will use to split the
       traffic across two network interfaces.

       <b>-2</b>, <b>--dualfile</b> Replay two files at a time from a network tap.  This option may appear up to 1 times.
       This option must appear in combination with the following options: intf2.  This option must not appear in
       combination with any of the following options: cachefile.

       If you captured network traffic using a network tap, then you can end up with two pcap files- one for
       each direction.  This option will replay these two files at the same time, one on each interface and
       inter-mix them using the timestamps in each.

       <b>-i</b> <u>string</u>, <b>--intf1</b>=<u>string</u> Client to server/RX/primary traffic output interface.  This option may appear
       up to 1 times.  This option is a member of the intf1 class of options.

       Required network interface used to send either all traffic or traffic which is marked as 'primary' via
       tcpprep.  Primary traffic is usually client-to-server or inbound (RX) on khial virtual interfaces.

       <b>-I</b> <u>string</u>, <b>--intf2</b>=<u>string</u> Server to client/TX/secondary traffic output interface.  This option may appear
       up to 1 times.

       Optional network interface used to send traffic which is marked as 'secondary' via tcpprep.  Secondary
       traffic is usually server-to-client or outbound (TX) on khial virtual interfaces.  Generally, it only
       makes sense to use this option with --cachefile.

       <b>-w</b> <u>string</u>, <b>--write</b>=<u>string</u> Pcap file to receive traffic outputs.  This option may appear up to 1 times.
       This option is a member of the intf1 class of options.  This option must not appear in combination with
       any of the following options: intf2.

       Optional pcap file name used to receive traffic.

       <b>--include</b>=<u>string</u> Send only selected packet numbers.  This option may appear up to 1 times.  This option
       must not appear in combination with any of the following options: exclude.

       Override default of processing all packets stored in the capture file and only send packets that are part
       of a supplied list of packet numbers.

           -x P:1-5,9,15,72-
       would skip packets 1 through 5, the 9th and 15th packet, and packets 72 until the end of the file

       <b>--exclude</b>=<u>string</u> Send all but selected packet numbers.  This option may appear up to 1 times.  This
       option must not appear in combination with any of the following options: include.

       Override default of processing all packets stored in the capture file and only send packets that are NOT
       part of a supplied list of packet numbers.

           -x P:1-5,9,15,72-
       would skip packets 1 through 5, the 9th and 15th packet, and packets 72 until the end of the file

       <b>--listnics</b> List available network interfaces and exit.

       <b>-l</b> <u>number</u>, <b>--loop</b>=<u>number</u> Loop through the capture file X times.  This option may appear up to 1 times.
       This option takes an integer number as its argument.  The value of <u>number</u> is constrained to being:
           greater than or equal to 0
       The default <u>number</u> for this option is:
            1

       <b>--loopdelay-ms</b>=<u>number</u> Delay between loops in milliseconds.  This option must appear in combination with
       the following options: loop.  This option must not appear in combination with any of the following
       options: loopdelay-ns.  This option takes an integer number as its argument.  The value of <u>number</u> is
       constrained to being:
           greater than or equal to 0
       The default <u>number</u> for this option is:
            0

       <b>--loopdelay-ns</b>=<u>number</u> Delay between loops in nanoseconds.  This option must appear in combination with
       the following options: loop.  This option must not appear in combination with any of the following
       options: loopdelay-ms.  This option takes an integer number as its argument.  The value of <u>number</u> is
       constrained to being:
           greater than or equal to 0
       The default <u>number</u> for this option is:
            0

       By default, tcpreplay will use loop delay with microsecond accuracy (loopdelay-ms).  In order to use loop
       delay with nanosecond accuracy you need to use nano packet timing mode.

       <b>--pktlen</b> Override the snaplen and use the actual packet len.  This option may appear up to 1 times.

       By default, tcpreplay will send packets based on the size of the "snaplen" stored in the pcap file which
       is usually the correct thing to do.  However, occasionally, tools will store more bytes then told to.  By
       specifying this option, tcpreplay will ignore the snaplen field and instead try to send packets based on
       the original packet length.  Bad things may happen if you specify this option.

       <b>-L</b> <u>number</u>, <b>--limit</b>=<u>number</u> Limit the number of packets to send.  This option may appear up to 1 times.
       This option takes an integer number as its argument.  The value of <u>number</u> is constrained to being:
           greater than or equal to 1
       The default <u>number</u> for this option is:
            -1

       By default, tcpreplay will send all the packets.  Alternatively, you can specify a maximum number of
       packets to send.

       <b>--duration</b>=<u>number</u> Limit the number of seconds to send.  This option may appear up to 1 times.  This
       option takes an integer number as its argument.  The value of <u>number</u> is constrained to being:
           greater than or equal to 1
       The default <u>number</u> for this option is:
            -1

       By default, tcpreplay will send all the packets.  Alternatively, you can specify a maximum number of
       seconds to transmit.

       <b>-x</b> <u>string</u>, <b>--multiplier</b>=<u>string</u> Modify replay speed to a given multiple.  This option may appear up to 1
       times.  This option must not appear in combination with any of the following options: pps, mbps,
       oneatatime, topspeed.

       Specify a value to modify the packet replay speed.  Examples:
               2.0 will replay traffic at twice the speed captured
               0.7 will replay traffic at 70% the speed captured

       <b>-p</b> <u>string</u>, <b>--pps</b>=<u>string</u> Replay packets at a given packets/sec.  This option may appear up to 1 times.
       This option must not appear in combination with any of the following options: multiplier, mbps,
       oneatatime, topspeed.

       Specify a value to regulate the packet replay to a specific packet-per-second rate.  Examples:
               200 will replay traffic at 200 packets per second
               0.25 will replay traffic at 15 packets per minute

       <b>-M</b> <u>string</u>, <b>--mbps</b>=<u>string</u> Replay packets at a given Mbps.  This option may appear up to 1 times.  This
       option must not appear in combination with any of the following options: multiplier, pps, oneatatime,
       topspeed.

       Specify a floating point value for the Mbps rate that tcpreplay should send packets at.

       <b>-t</b>, <b>--topspeed</b> Replay packets as fast as possible.  This option must not appear in combination with any
       of the following options: mbps, multiplier, pps, oneatatime.

       <b>-o</b>, <b>--oneatatime</b> Replay one packet at a time for each user input.  This option must not appear in
       combination with any of the following options: mbps, pps, multiplier, topspeed.

       Allows you to step through one or more packets at a time.

       <b>--pps-multi</b>=<u>number</u> Number of packets to send for each time interval.  This option must appear in
       combination with the following options: pps.  This option takes an integer number as its argument.  The
       value of <u>number</u> is constrained to being:
           greater than or equal to 1
       The default <u>number</u> for this option is:
            1

       When trying to send packets at very high rates, the time between each packet can be so short that it is
       impossible to accurately sleep for the required period of time.  This option allows you to send multiple
       packets at a time, thus allowing for longer sleep times which can be more accurately implemented.

       <b>--unique-ip</b> Modify IP addresses each loop iteration to generate unique flows.  This option must appear in
       combination with the following options: loop.

       Ensure IPv4 and IPv6 packets will be unique for each <b>--loop</b> iteration.  This is done in a way that will
       not alter packet CRC, and therefore will generally not affect performance. This option will significantly
       increase the flows/sec over generated over multiple loop iterations.

       <b>--unique-ip-loops</b>=<u>string</u> Number of times to loop before assigning new unique ip.  This option may appear
       up to 1 times.  This option must appear in combination with the following options: unique-ip.

       Number of <b>--loop</b> iterations before a new unique IP is assigned. Default is 1. Assumes both <b>--loop</b> and
       <b>--unique-ip</b>.

       <b>--netmap</b> Write packets directly to netmap enabled network adapter.

       This feature will detect netmap capable network drivers on Linux and BSD systems. If detected, the
       network driver is bypassed for the execution duration, and network buffers will be written to directly.
       This will allow you to achieve full line rates on commodity network adapters, similar to rates achieved
       by commercial network traffic generators. Note that bypassing the network driver will disrupt other
       applications connected through the test interface. See INSTALL for more information.

       This feature can also be enabled by specifying an interface as 'netmap:&lt;intf&gt;' or 'vale:&lt;intf&gt;. For
       example 'netmap:eth0' specifies netmap over interface eth0.

       <b>--nm-delay</b>=<u>number</u> Netmap startup delay.  This option takes an integer number as its argument.  The
       default <u>number</u> for this option is:
            10

       Number of seconds to delay after netmap is loaded. Required to ensure interfaces are fully up before
       netmap transmit. Requires netmap option. Default is 10 seconds.

       <b>--no-flow-stats</b> Suppress printing and tracking flow count, rates and expirations.

       Suppress the collection and printing of flow statistics. This option may improve performance when not
       using <b>--preload-pcap</b> option, otherwise its only function is to suppress printing.

       The flow feature will track and print statistics of the flows being sent.  A flow is loosely defined as a
       unique combination of a 5-tuple, i.e.  source IP, destination IP, source port, destination port and
       protocol.

       If <b>--loop</b> is specified, the flows from one iteration to the next will not be unique, unless the packets
       are altered. Use <b>--unique-ip</b> or <b>tcpreplay-edit</b> to alter packets between iterations.

       <b>--flow-expiry</b>=<u>number</u> Number of inactive seconds before a flow is considered expired.  This option must
       not appear in combination with any of the following options: no-flow-stats.  This option takes an integer
       number as its argument.  The value of <u>number</u> is constrained to being:
           greater than or equal to 0
       The default <u>number</u> for this option is:
            0

       This option will track and report flow expirations based on the flow idle times. The timestamps within
       the pcap file are used to determine the expiry, not the actual timestamp of the packets are replayed. For
       example, a value of 30 suggests that if no traffic is seen on a flow for 30 seconds, any subsequent
       traffic would be considered a new flow, and thereby will increment the flows and flows per second (fps)
       statistics.

       This option can be used to optimize flow timeout settings for flow products.  Setting the timeout low may
       lead to flows being dropped when in fact the flow is simply slow to respond. Configuring your flow
       timeouts too high may increase resources required by your flow product.

       Note that using this option while replaying at higher than original speeds can lead to inflated flows and
       fps counts.

       Default is 0 (no expiry) and a typical value is 30-120 seconds.

       <b>-P</b>, <b>--pid</b> Print the PID of tcpreplay at startup.

       <b>--stats</b>=<u>number</u> Print statistics every X seconds, or every loop if '0'.  This option takes an integer
       number as its argument.  The value of <u>number</u> is constrained to being:
           greater than or equal to 0

       Note that timed delays are a "best effort" and long delays between sending packets may cause equally long
       delays between printing statistics.

       <b>-W</b>, <b>--suppress-warnings</b> suppress printing warning messages.

       <b>--xdp</b> Write packets directly to AF_XDP enabled network adapter.

       This feature will detect AF_XDP capable network drivers on Linux systems that have 'libxdp-dev' and
       'libbpf-dev' installed. If detected, the network stack is bypassed and packets are sent directly to an
       eBPF enabled driver directly.  This will allow you to achieve full line rates on commodity network
       adapters, similar to rates achieved by commercial network traffic generators.

       <b>--xdp-batch-size</b>=<u>number</u> The maximum number of packets that can be submitted to the AF_XDP TX ring at
       once.  This option takes an integer number as its argument.  The value of <u>number</u> is constrained to being:
           in the range  1 through 4096
       The default <u>number</u> for this option is:
            25

       Higher values may improve performance at the cost of accuracy

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--version</b> Print version information.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--less-help</b> Display less usage information and exit.

       <b>-H</b>, <b>--help</b> Display usage information and exit.

       <b>-!</b>, <b>--more-help</b> Pass the extended usage information through a pager.

       <b>--save-opts</b> [=<u>cfgfile</u>] Save the option state to <u>cfgfile</u>.  The default is the <u>last</u> configuration file
       listed in the <b>OPTION</b> <b>PRESETS</b> section, below.  The command will exit after updating the config file.

       <b>--load-opts</b>=<u>cfgfile</u>, <b>--no-load-opts</b> Load options from <u>cfgfile</u>.  The <u>no-load-opts</u> form will disable the
       loading of earlier config/rc/ini files.  <u>--no-load-opts</u> is handled early, out of order.

       <b>OPTION</b> <b>PRESETS</b>
              Any option that  is  not  marked  as  <u>not</u>  <u>presettable</u>  may  be  preset  by  loading  values  from
              configuration ("RC" or ".INI") file(s).  The <u>homerc</u> file is "<u>$$/</u>", unless that is a directory.  In
              that case, the file "<u>.tcpreplayrc</u>" is searched for within that directory.
