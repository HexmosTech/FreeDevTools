</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       wmsystemtray - A freedesktop.org system tray as a Window Maker dock app

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>wmsystemtray</b> [<b>options</b>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>wmsystemtray</b>  is  a system tray using the freedesktop.org system tray protocol designed as a Window Maker
       dock app. It has the ability to display more than one dock window to make room for more tray  icons,  and
       the ability to scroll through the icons if more are present than will fit.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-display</b> <u>&lt;display</u> <u>name&gt;</u>
              Name of display to use.

       <b>--help</b> Display usage information.

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--version</b>
              Display the version number and exit.

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b>
              Print more messages to the console. May be repeated.

       <b>-q</b>, <b>--quiet</b>
              Print fewer messages to the console. May be repeated.

       <b>-s</b>, <b>--small</b>
              Use  16x16  tray  icons,  instead  of  24x24. In other words, fit 9 icons instead of 4 in one dock
              window.

       <b>-w</b> <u>&lt;n&gt;</u>, <b>--windows</b> <u>&lt;n&gt;</u>
              Specifies the number of dock windows to open. Each dock window is assigned a unique name (i.e. the
              first is wmsystemtray.wmsystemtray0, the second wmsystemtray.wmsystemtray1, and so  on),  so  they
              can be reliably positioned in the dock or clip.

       <b>--id-windows</b>
              Print  the window's index number on the window, to make it easier to dock them in the right order.
              Note that if there are enough tray icons active, this number may be covered up.

       <b>--fill-rows</b>
              Normally the first dock window is completely filled before  any  tray  icons  are  placed  in  the
              second.  This  option fills the top row of each dock window before placing any icons in the second
              row, which may make more sense if you arrange the dock windows horizontally.

       <b>--arrows</b> <u>&lt;place&gt;</u>
              Normally, every dock window has both left and right scrolling arrows  at  the  bottom.  Specifying
              <u>--arrows</u> <u>horizontal</u> places the left arrow only on the first window and the right arrow only on the
              last, which may make more sense if the windows are arranged horizontally. <u>--arrows</u> <u>vertical</u> places
              the  arrows  only  on  the  last  window,  which  may  make more sense if the windows are arranged
              vertically.

       <b>-c</b> <u>&lt;color&gt;</u>, <b>--fgcolor</b> <u>&lt;color&gt;</u>
              Specify a color for the page indicator and <u>--id-windows</u> indicators, instead of black.  Colors  may
              be  specified  in  any  format  recognized  by  <b>XParseColor</b> In short, that's any color name in X's
              rgb.txt or an RGB color specified as "rgb:<u>rr</u>/<u>gg</u>/<u>gg</u>".

       <b>--bgcolor</b> <u>&lt;color&gt;</u>
              In non-Window Maker mode, specify the color for the window background. The default is to shape the
              window to fit the used area and to set <u>ParentRelative</u>, which attempts to copy whatever  is  behind
              the window.

       <b>--non-wmaker</b>
              Activate  non-Window  Maker  mode.  This  provides limited support for using the program in window
              managers that don't do Window Maker-style dockapps; the application still sizes itself as a  64x64
              window, however, so you might be better served by a more traditional system tray.

</pre><h4><b>DISPLAY</b></h4><pre>
       The  main portion of the dockapp has room for four 24x24 or nine 16x16 tray icons. At the bottom are left
       and right arrows for paging when more tray icons are available than can be displayed  at  once,  with  an
       indicator between showing the current "page" of icons and total number of pages currently available.

       In  addition to left-clicking either scrolling arrows, the mouse's scroll wheel may be used on the bottom
       section to change pages.

</pre><h4><b>SIGNALS</b></h4><pre>
       SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2 may be used to change pages. A program such as xbindkeys may be used  to  send  these
       signals to wmsystemtray on appropriate key presses.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       The  balloon  message portion of the freedesktop.org protocol is not implemented at this time. I've heard
       that the official Gnome system tray doesn't implement this either, and most tray apps  seem  to  directly
       use dbus desktop notifications service.

       Most  of  the  Xembed  specification is not implemented, as it is not needed here.  For example, the only
       point to redirecting input focus is to allow the outer window to see input events  (and  then  the  outer
       window  has  to  forward those events to the embeds). But since we don't really care, we can just let the
       icons get events directly. Similarly, we don't take focus or activation, and we don't do accellerators.

</pre><h4><b>INSPIRATION</b></h4><pre>
       When I finally decided to make use of some applications that work via system tray icons, I looked  around
       for a tray for my preferred window manager. Some didn't integrate well (I didn't want a bar at the top or
       bottom of the screen), some dockapps couldn't handle more than 4 icons at all, some could do 4 icons with
       paging  (and  much  crashing  if  any  program  was  killed), some could do more than 4 icons by creating
       arbitrary numbers of app icons (but undockable, because they were created "as needed"). So I  decided  to
       write my own, combining the best features into a stable app.
