</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       cafeobj - algebraic specification and programming language

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>cafeobj</b> [<u>OPTION</u>]... [<u>FILES</u>]...

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Starts the <b>CafeOBJ</b> interpreter.

       <b>CafeOBJ</b>  is  a  most  advanced  formal specification language which inherits many advanced features (e.g.
       flexible mix-fix syntax, powerful and clear typing system with ordered  sorts,  parameteric  modules  and
       views  for  instantiating  the  parameters, and module expressions, etc.) from OBJ (or more exactly OBJ3)
       algebraic specification language.

       CafeOBJ is a language for writing formal (i.e. mathematical) specifications of models for wide  varieties
       of  software  and  systems,  and  verifying  properties  of  them. CafeOBJ implements equational logic by
       rewriting and can be used as a powerful interactive theorem proving system. Specifiers  can  write  proof
       scores also in CafeOBJ and doing proofs by executing the proof scores.

       CafeOBJ  has  state-of-art  rigorous  logical semantics based on institutions. The CafeOBJ cube shows the
       structure of the various logics underlying the combination of the various paradigms  implemented  by  the
       language.  Proof  scores  in  CafeOBJ  are also based on institution based rigorous semantics, and can be
       constructed using a complete set of proof rules.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       There are two classes of options. The first are options for the <b>cafeobj</b> wrapper  script  that  allows  to
       select the underlying Common Lisp interpreter, and to adjust search path parameters.

       <b>-engine</b> <u>NAME</u>
              selects  the underlying common lisp engine. If not given, the first one selected during build time
              is used.

       <b>-list-engines</b>
              lists all available common lisp engines

       <b>-wrapper-libpath</b> <u>PATH</u>
              sets the path where memory dumps of the lisp interpreters are found

       <b>-wrapper-sharepath</b> <u>PATH</u>
              sets the path where CafeOBJ initialization files are searched

       The following set of options are directed at the CafeOBJ interpreter directly:

       <b>-help</b>  print a help message

       <b>-q</b>     do not load user's initialization file

       <b>-batch</b> run in batch mode

       <b>-p</b> <u>PATH</u>
              gives the standard prelude file defining modules

       <b>+p</b> <u>PATH</u>
              load additional prelude file

       <b>-l</b> <u>DIR-LIST</u>
              set list of pathnames for module search path, separated by colons

       <b>+l</b> <u>DIR-LIST</u>
              adds a list of pathname for module search path

       <u>FILES</u>  files that are loaded at startup time in order.
