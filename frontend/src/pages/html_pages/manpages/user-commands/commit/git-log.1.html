</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       git-log - Show commit logs

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>git</u> <u>log</u> [&lt;options&gt;] [&lt;revision-range&gt;] [[--] &lt;path&gt;...]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Shows the commit logs.

       List commits that are reachable by following the <b>parent</b> links from the given commit(s), but exclude
       commits that are reachable from the one(s) given with a <u>^</u> in front of them. The output is given in
       reverse chronological order by default.

       You can think of this as a set operation. Commits reachable from any of the commits given on the command
       line form a set, and then commits reachable from any of the ones given with <u>^</u> in front are subtracted
       from that set. The remaining commits are what comes out in the command’s output. Various other options
       and paths parameters can be used to further limit the result.

       Thus, the following command:

           $ git log foo bar ^baz

       means "list all the commits which are reachable from <u>foo</u> or <u>bar</u>, but not from <u>baz</u>".

       A special notation "<u>&lt;commit1&gt;</u>..<u>&lt;commit2&gt;</u>" can be used as a short-hand for "^<u>&lt;commit1&gt;</u> <u>&lt;commit2&gt;</u>". For
       example, either of the following may be used interchangeably:

           $ git log origin..HEAD
           $ git log HEAD ^origin

       Another special notation is "<u>&lt;commit1&gt;</u>...<u>&lt;commit2&gt;</u>" which is useful for merges. The resulting set of
       commits is the symmetric difference between the two operands. The following two commands are equivalent:

           $ git log A B --not $(git merge-base --all A B)
           $ git log A...B

       The command takes options applicable to the <b><a href="../man1/git-rev-list.1.html">git-rev-list</a></b>(1) command to control what is shown and how, and
       options applicable to the <b><a href="../man1/git-diff.1.html">git-diff</a></b>(1) command to control how the changes each commit introduces are
       shown.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       --follow
           Continue listing the history of a file beyond renames (works only for a single file).

       --no-decorate, --decorate[=short|full|auto|no]
           Print out the ref names of any commits that are shown. If <u>short</u> is specified, the ref name prefixes
           <u>refs/heads/</u>, <u>refs/tags/</u> and <u>refs/remotes/</u> will not be printed. If <u>full</u> is specified, the full ref
           name (including prefix) will be printed. If <u>auto</u> is specified, then if the output is going to a
           terminal, the ref names are shown as if <u>short</u> were given, otherwise no ref names are shown. The
           option <b>--decorate</b> is short-hand for <b>--decorate=short</b>. Default to configuration value of <b>log.decorate</b>
           if configured, otherwise, <b>auto</b>.

       --decorate-refs=&lt;pattern&gt;, --decorate-refs-exclude=&lt;pattern&gt;
           For each candidate reference, do not use it for decoration if it matches any patterns given to
           <b>--decorate-refs-exclude</b> or if it doesn’t match any of the patterns given to <b>--decorate-refs</b>. The
           <b>log.excludeDecoration</b> config option allows excluding refs from the decorations, but an explicit
           <b>--decorate-refs</b> pattern will override a match in <b>log.excludeDecoration</b>.

           If none of these options or config settings are given, then references are used as decoration if they
           match <b>HEAD</b>, <b>refs/heads/</b>, <b>refs/remotes/</b>, <b>refs/stash/</b>, or <b>refs/tags/</b>.

       --clear-decorations
           When specified, this option clears all previous <b>--decorate-refs</b> or <b>--decorate-refs-exclude</b> options
           and relaxes the default decoration filter to include all references. This option is assumed if the
           config value <b>log.initialDecorationSet</b> is set to <b>all</b>.

       --source
           Print out the ref name given on the command line by which each commit was reached.

       --[no-]mailmap, --[no-]use-mailmap
           Use mailmap file to map author and committer names and email addresses to canonical real names and
           email addresses. See <b><a href="../man1/git-shortlog.1.html">git-shortlog</a></b>(1).

       --full-diff
           Without this flag, <b>git</b> <b>log</b> <b>-p</b> <u>&lt;path&gt;</u>... shows commits that touch the specified paths, and diffs about
           the same specified paths. With this, the full diff is shown for commits that touch the specified
           paths; this means that "&lt;path&gt;..." limits only commits, and doesn’t limit diff for those commits.

           Note that this affects all diff-based output types, e.g. those produced by <b>--stat</b>, etc.

       --log-size
           Include a line “log size &lt;number&gt;” in the output for each commit, where &lt;number&gt; is the length of
           that commit’s message in bytes. Intended to speed up tools that read log messages from <b>git</b> <b>log</b> output
           by allowing them to allocate space in advance.

       -L&lt;start&gt;,&lt;end&gt;:&lt;file&gt;, -L:&lt;funcname&gt;:&lt;file&gt;
           Trace the evolution of the line range given by <u>&lt;start&gt;,&lt;end&gt;</u>, or by the function name regex
           <u>&lt;funcname&gt;</u>, within the <u>&lt;file&gt;</u>. You may not give any pathspec limiters. This is currently limited to a
           walk starting from a single revision, i.e., you may only give zero or one positive revision
           arguments, and <u>&lt;start&gt;</u> and <u>&lt;end&gt;</u> (or <u>&lt;funcname&gt;</u>) must exist in the starting revision. You can specify
           this option more than once. Implies <b>--patch</b>. Patch output can be suppressed using <b>--no-patch</b>, but
           other diff formats (namely <b>--raw</b>, <b>--numstat</b>, <b>--shortstat</b>, <b>--dirstat</b>, <b>--summary</b>, <b>--name-only</b>,
           <b>--name-status</b>, <b>--check</b>) are not currently implemented.

           <u>&lt;start&gt;</u> and <u>&lt;end&gt;</u> can take one of these forms:

           •   number

               If <u>&lt;start&gt;</u> or <u>&lt;end&gt;</u> is a number, it specifies an absolute line number (lines count from 1).

           •   <b>/regex/</b>

               This form will use the first line matching the given POSIX regex. If <u>&lt;start&gt;</u> is a regex, it will
               search from the end of the previous <b>-L</b> range, if any, otherwise from the start of file. If
               <u>&lt;start&gt;</u> is <b>^/regex/</b>, it will search from the start of file. If <u>&lt;end&gt;</u> is a regex, it will search
               starting at the line given by <u>&lt;start&gt;</u>.

           •   +offset or -offset

               This is only valid for <u>&lt;end&gt;</u> and will specify a number of lines before or after the line given by
               <u>&lt;start&gt;</u>.

           If <b>:</b><u>&lt;funcname&gt;</u> is given in place of <u>&lt;start&gt;</u> and <u>&lt;end&gt;</u>, it is a regular expression that denotes the
           range from the first funcname line that matches <u>&lt;funcname&gt;</u>, up to the next funcname line.
           <b>:</b><u>&lt;funcname&gt;</u> searches from the end of the previous <b>-L</b> range, if any, otherwise from the start of file.
           <b>^:</b><u>&lt;funcname&gt;</u> searches from the start of file. The function names are determined in the same way as
           <b>git</b> <b>diff</b> works out patch hunk headers (see <u>Defining</u> <u>a</u> <u>custom</u> <u>hunk-header</u> in <b><a href="../man5/gitattributes.5.html">gitattributes</a></b>(5)).

       &lt;revision-range&gt;
           Show only commits in the specified revision range. When no &lt;revision-range&gt; is specified, it defaults
           to <b>HEAD</b> (i.e. the whole history leading to the current commit).  <b>origin..HEAD</b> specifies all the
           commits reachable from the current commit (i.e.  <b>HEAD</b>), but not from <b>origin</b>. For a complete list of
           ways to spell &lt;revision-range&gt;, see the <u>Specifying</u> <u>Ranges</u> section of <b><a href="../man7/gitrevisions.7.html">gitrevisions</a></b>(7).

       [--] &lt;path&gt;...
           Show only commits that are enough to explain how the files that match the specified paths came to be.
           See <u>History</u> <u>Simplification</u> below for details and other simplification modes.

           Paths may need to be prefixed with <b>--</b> to separate them from options or the revision range, when
           confusion arises.

   <b>Commit</b> <b>Limiting</b>
       Besides specifying a range of commits that should be listed using the special notations explained in the
       description, additional commit limiting may be applied.

       Using more options generally further limits the output (e.g. <b>--since=</b><u>&lt;date1&gt;</u> limits to commits newer than
       <u>&lt;date1&gt;</u>, and using it with <b>--grep=</b><u>&lt;pattern&gt;</u> further limits to commits whose log message has a line that
       matches <u>&lt;pattern&gt;</u>), unless otherwise noted.

       Note that these are applied before commit ordering and formatting options, such as <b>--reverse</b>.

       -&lt;number&gt;, -n &lt;number&gt;, --max-count=&lt;number&gt;
           Limit the number of commits to output.

       --skip=&lt;number&gt;
           Skip <u>number</u> commits before starting to show the commit output.

       --since=&lt;date&gt;, --after=&lt;date&gt;
           Show commits more recent than a specific date.

       --since-as-filter=&lt;date&gt;
           Show all commits more recent than a specific date. This visits all commits in the range, rather than
           stopping at the first commit which is older than a specific date.

       --until=&lt;date&gt;, --before=&lt;date&gt;
           Show commits older than a specific date.

       --author=&lt;pattern&gt;, --committer=&lt;pattern&gt;
           Limit the commits output to ones with author/committer header lines that match the specified pattern
           (regular expression). With more than one <b>--author=</b><u>&lt;pattern&gt;</u>, commits whose author matches any of the
           given patterns are chosen (similarly for multiple <b>--committer=</b><u>&lt;pattern&gt;</u>).

       --grep-reflog=&lt;pattern&gt;
           Limit the commits output to ones with reflog entries that match the specified pattern (regular
           expression). With more than one <b>--grep-reflog</b>, commits whose reflog message matches any of the given
           patterns are chosen. It is an error to use this option unless <b>--walk-reflogs</b> is in use.

       --grep=&lt;pattern&gt;
           Limit the commits output to ones with a log message that matches the specified pattern (regular
           expression). With more than one <b>--grep=</b><u>&lt;pattern&gt;</u>, commits whose message matches any of the given
           patterns are chosen (but see <b>--all-match</b>).

           When <b>--notes</b> is in effect, the message from the notes is matched as if it were part of the log
           message.

       --all-match
           Limit the commits output to ones that match all given <b>--grep</b>, instead of ones that match at least
           one.

       --invert-grep
           Limit the commits output to ones with a log message that do not match the pattern specified with
           <b>--grep=</b><u>&lt;pattern&gt;</u>.

       -i, --regexp-ignore-case
           Match the regular expression limiting patterns without regard to letter case.

       --basic-regexp
           Consider the limiting patterns to be basic regular expressions; this is the default.

       -E, --extended-regexp
           Consider the limiting patterns to be extended regular expressions instead of the default basic
           regular expressions.

       -F, --fixed-strings
           Consider the limiting patterns to be fixed strings (don’t interpret pattern as a regular expression).

       -P, --perl-regexp
           Consider the limiting patterns to be Perl-compatible regular expressions.

           Support for these types of regular expressions is an optional compile-time dependency. If Git wasn’t
           compiled with support for them providing this option will cause it to die.

       --remove-empty
           Stop when a given path disappears from the tree.

       --merges
           Print only merge commits. This is exactly the same as <b>--min-parents=2</b>.

       --no-merges
           Do not print commits with more than one parent. This is exactly the same as <b>--max-parents=1</b>.

       --min-parents=&lt;number&gt;, --max-parents=&lt;number&gt;, --no-min-parents, --no-max-parents
           Show only commits which have at least (or at most) that many parent commits. In particular,
           <b>--max-parents=1</b> is the same as <b>--no-merges</b>, <b>--min-parents=2</b> is the same as <b>--merges</b>.  <b>--max-parents=0</b>
           gives all root commits and <b>--min-parents=3</b> all octopus merges.

           <b>--no-min-parents</b> and <b>--no-max-parents</b> reset these limits (to no limit) again. Equivalent forms are
           <b>--min-parents=0</b> (any commit has 0 or more parents) and <b>--max-parents=-1</b> (negative numbers denote no
           upper limit).

       --first-parent
           When finding commits to include, follow only the first parent commit upon seeing a merge commit. This
           option can give a better overview when viewing the evolution of a particular topic branch, because
           merges into a topic branch tend to be only about adjusting to updated upstream from time to time, and
           this option allows you to ignore the individual commits brought in to your history by such a merge.

           This option also changes default diff format for merge commits to <b>first-parent</b>, see
           <b>--diff-merges=first-parent</b> for details.

       --exclude-first-parent-only
           When finding commits to exclude (with a <u>^</u>), follow only the first parent commit upon seeing a merge
           commit. This can be used to find the set of changes in a topic branch from the point where it
           diverged from the remote branch, given that arbitrary merges can be valid topic branch changes.

       --not
           Reverses the meaning of the <u>^</u> prefix (or lack thereof) for all following revision specifiers, up to
           the next <b>--not</b>. When used on the command line before --stdin, the revisions passed through stdin will
           not be affected by it. Conversely, when passed via standard input, the revisions passed on the
           command line will not be affected by it.

       --all
           Pretend as if all the refs in <b>refs/</b>, along with <b>HEAD</b>, are listed on the command line as <u>&lt;commit&gt;</u>.

       --branches[=&lt;pattern&gt;]
           Pretend as if all the refs in <b>refs/heads</b> are listed on the command line as <u>&lt;commit&gt;</u>. If <u>&lt;pattern&gt;</u> is
           given, limit branches to ones matching given shell glob. If pattern lacks <u>?</u>, <u>*</u>, or <u>[</u>, <u>/*</u> at the end
           is implied.

       --tags[=&lt;pattern&gt;]
           Pretend as if all the refs in <b>refs/tags</b> are listed on the command line as <u>&lt;commit&gt;</u>. If <u>&lt;pattern&gt;</u> is
           given, limit tags to ones matching given shell glob. If pattern lacks <u>?</u>, <u>*</u>, or <u>[</u>, <u>/*</u> at the end is
           implied.

       --remotes[=&lt;pattern&gt;]
           Pretend as if all the refs in <b>refs/remotes</b> are listed on the command line as <u>&lt;commit&gt;</u>. If <u>&lt;pattern&gt;</u>
           is given, limit remote-tracking branches to ones matching given shell glob. If pattern lacks <u>?</u>, <u>*</u>, or
           <u>[</u>, <u>/*</u> at the end is implied.

       --glob=&lt;glob-pattern&gt;
           Pretend as if all the refs matching shell glob <u>&lt;glob-pattern&gt;</u> are listed on the command line as
           <u>&lt;commit&gt;</u>. Leading <u>refs/</u>, is automatically prepended if missing. If pattern lacks <u>?</u>, <u>*</u>, or <u>[</u>, <u>/*</u> at
           the end is implied.

       --exclude=&lt;glob-pattern&gt;
           Do not include refs matching <u>&lt;glob-pattern&gt;</u> that the next <b>--all</b>, <b>--branches</b>, <b>--tags</b>, <b>--remotes</b>, or
           <b>--glob</b> would otherwise consider. Repetitions of this option accumulate exclusion patterns up to the
           next <b>--all</b>, <b>--branches</b>, <b>--tags</b>, <b>--remotes</b>, or <b>--glob</b> option (other options or arguments do not clear
           accumulated patterns).

           The patterns given should not begin with <b>refs/heads</b>, <b>refs/tags</b>, or <b>refs/remotes</b> when applied to
           <b>--branches</b>, <b>--tags</b>, or <b>--remotes</b>, respectively, and they must begin with <b>refs/</b> when applied to <b>--glob</b>
           or <b>--all</b>. If a trailing <u>/*</u> is intended, it must be given explicitly.

       --exclude-hidden=[fetch|receive|uploadpack]
           Do not include refs that would be hidden by <b>git-fetch</b>, <b>git-receive-pack</b> or <b>git-upload-pack</b> by
           consulting the appropriate <b>fetch.hideRefs</b>, <b>receive.hideRefs</b> or <b>uploadpack.hideRefs</b> configuration
           along with <b>transfer.hideRefs</b> (see <b><a href="../man1/git-config.1.html">git-config</a></b>(1)). This option affects the next pseudo-ref option
           <b>--all</b> or <b>--glob</b> and is cleared after processing them.

       --reflog
           Pretend as if all objects mentioned by reflogs are listed on the command line as <u>&lt;commit&gt;</u>.

       --alternate-refs
           Pretend as if all objects mentioned as ref tips of alternate repositories were listed on the command
           line. An alternate repository is any repository whose object directory is specified in
           <b>objects/info/alternates</b>. The set of included objects may be modified by <b>core.alternateRefsCommand</b>,
           etc. See <b><a href="../man1/git-config.1.html">git-config</a></b>(1).

       --single-worktree
           By default, all working trees will be examined by the following options when there are more than one
           (see <b><a href="../man1/git-worktree.1.html">git-worktree</a></b>(1)): <b>--all</b>, <b>--reflog</b> and <b>--indexed-objects</b>. This option forces them to examine the
           current working tree only.

       --ignore-missing
           Upon seeing an invalid object name in the input, pretend as if the bad input was not given.

       --bisect
           Pretend as if the bad bisection ref <b>refs/bisect/bad</b> was listed and as if it was followed by <b>--not</b> and
           the good bisection refs <b>refs/bisect/good-</b>* on the command line.

       --stdin
           In addition to getting arguments from the command line, read them from standard input as well. This
           accepts commits and pseudo-options like <b>--all</b> and <b>--glob=</b>. When a <b>--</b> separator is seen, the following
           input is treated as paths and used to limit the result. Flags like <b>--not</b> which are read via standard
           input are only respected for arguments passed in the same way and will not influence any subsequent
           command line arguments.

       --cherry-mark
           Like <b>--cherry-pick</b> (see below) but mark equivalent commits with <b>=</b> rather than omitting them, and
           inequivalent ones with <b>+</b>.

       --cherry-pick
           Omit any commit that introduces the same change as another commit on the “other side” when the set of
           commits are limited with symmetric difference.

           For example, if you have two branches, <b>A</b> and <b>B</b>, a usual way to list all commits on only one side of
           them is with <b>--left-right</b> (see the example below in the description of the <b>--left-right</b> option).
           However, it shows the commits that were cherry-picked from the other branch (for example, “3rd on b”
           may be cherry-picked from branch A). With this option, such pairs of commits are excluded from the
           output.

       --left-only, --right-only
           List only commits on the respective side of a symmetric difference, i.e. only those which would be
           marked &lt; resp. &gt; by <b>--left-right</b>.

           For example, <b>--cherry-pick</b> <b>--right-only</b> <b>A...B</b> omits those commits from <b>B</b> which are in <b>A</b> or are
           patch-equivalent to a commit in <b>A</b>. In other words, this lists the <b>+</b> commits from <b>git</b> <b>cherry</b> <b>A</b> <b>B</b>. More
           precisely, <b>--cherry-pick</b> <b>--right-only</b> <b>--no-merges</b> gives the exact list.

       --cherry
           A synonym for <b>--right-only</b> <b>--cherry-mark</b> <b>--no-merges</b>; useful to limit the output to the commits on
           our side and mark those that have been applied to the other side of a forked history with <b>git</b> <b>log</b>
           <b>--cherry</b> <b>upstream...mybranch</b>, similar to <b>git</b> <b>cherry</b> <b>upstream</b> <b>mybranch</b>.

       -g, --walk-reflogs
           Instead of walking the commit ancestry chain, walk reflog entries from the most recent one to older
           ones. When this option is used you cannot specify commits to exclude (that is, <u>^commit</u>,
           <u>commit1..commit2</u>, and <u>commit1...commit2</u> notations cannot be used).

           With <b>--pretty</b> format other than <b>oneline</b> and <b>reference</b> (for obvious reasons), this causes the output
           to have two extra lines of information taken from the reflog. The reflog designator in the output may
           be shown as <b>ref@</b>{<u>&lt;Nth&gt;</u>} (where <u>&lt;Nth&gt;</u> is the reverse-chronological index in the reflog) or as
           <b>ref@</b>{<u>&lt;timestamp&gt;</u>} (with the <u>&lt;timestamp&gt;</u> for that entry), depending on a few rules:

            1. If the starting point is specified as <b>ref@</b>{<u>&lt;Nth&gt;</u>}, show the index format.

            2. If the starting point was specified as <b>ref@</b>{now}, show the timestamp format.

            3. If neither was used, but <b>--date</b> was given on the command line, show the timestamp in the format
               requested by <b>--date</b>.

            4. Otherwise, show the index format.

           Under <b>--pretty=oneline</b>, the commit message is prefixed with this information on the same line. This
           option cannot be combined with <b>--reverse</b>. See also <b><a href="../man1/git-reflog.1.html">git-reflog</a></b>(1).

           Under <b>--pretty=reference</b>, this information will not be shown at all.

       --merge
           Show commits touching conflicted paths in the range <b>HEAD...</b><u>&lt;other&gt;</u>, where <u>&lt;other&gt;</u> is the first
           existing pseudoref in <b>MERGE_HEAD</b>, <b>CHERRY_PICK_HEAD</b>, <b>REVERT_HEAD</b> or <b>REBASE_HEAD</b>. Only works when the
           index has unmerged entries. This option can be used to show relevant commits when resolving conflicts
           from a 3-way merge.

       --boundary
           Output excluded boundary commits. Boundary commits are prefixed with <b>-</b>.

   <b>History</b> <b>Simplification</b>
       Sometimes you are only interested in parts of the history, for example the commits modifying a particular
       &lt;path&gt;. But there are two parts of <u>History</u> <u>Simplification</u>, one part is selecting the commits and the
       other is how to do it, as there are various strategies to simplify the history.

       The following options select the commits to be shown:

       &lt;paths&gt;
           Commits modifying the given &lt;paths&gt; are selected.

       --simplify-by-decoration
           Commits that are referred by some branch or tag are selected.

       Note that extra commits can be shown to give a meaningful history.

       The following options affect the way the simplification is performed:

       Default mode
           Simplifies the history to the simplest history explaining the final state of the tree. Simplest
           because it prunes some side branches if the end result is the same (i.e. merging branches with the
           same content)

       --show-pulls
           Include all commits from the default mode, but also any merge commits that are not TREESAME to the
           first parent but are TREESAME to a later parent. This mode is helpful for showing the merge commits
           that "first introduced" a change to a branch.

       --full-history
           Same as the default mode, but does not prune some history.

       --dense
           Only the selected commits are shown, plus some to have a meaningful history.

       --sparse
           All commits in the simplified history are shown.

       --simplify-merges
           Additional option to <b>--full-history</b> to remove some needless merges from the resulting history, as
           there are no selected commits contributing to this merge.

       --ancestry-path[=&lt;commit&gt;]
           When given a range of commits to display (e.g.  <u>commit1..commit2</u> or <u>commit2</u> <u>^commit1</u>), and a commit
           &lt;commit&gt; in that range, only display commits in that range that are ancestors of &lt;commit&gt;,
           descendants of &lt;commit&gt;, or &lt;commit&gt; itself. If no commit is specified, use <u>commit1</u> (the excluded
           part of the range) as &lt;commit&gt;. Can be passed multiple times; if so, a commit is included if it is
           any of the commits given or if it is an ancestor or descendant of one of them.

       A more detailed explanation follows.

       Suppose you specified <b>foo</b> as the &lt;paths&gt;. We shall call commits that modify <b>foo</b> !TREESAME, and the rest
       TREESAME. (In a diff filtered for <b>foo</b>, they look different and equal, respectively.)

       In the following, we will always refer to the same example history to illustrate the differences between
       simplification settings. We assume that you are filtering for a file <b>foo</b> in this commit graph:

                     .-A---M---N---O---P---Q
                    /     /   /   /   /   /
                   I     B   C   D   E   Y
                    \   /   /   /   /   /
                     `-------------'   X

       The horizontal line of history A---Q is taken to be the first parent of each merge. The commits are:

       •   <b>I</b> is the initial commit, in which <b>foo</b> exists with contents “asdf”, and a file <b>quux</b> exists with
           contents “quux”. Initial commits are compared to an empty tree, so <b>I</b> is !TREESAME.

       •   In <b>A</b>, <b>foo</b> contains just “foo”.

       •   <b>B</b> contains the same change as <b>A</b>. Its merge <b>M</b> is trivial and hence TREESAME to all parents.

       •   <b>C</b> does not change <b>foo</b>, but its merge <b>N</b> changes it to “foobar”, so it is not TREESAME to any parent.

       •   <b>D</b> sets <b>foo</b> to “baz”. Its merge <b>O</b> combines the strings from <b>N</b> and <b>D</b> to “foobarbaz”; i.e., it is not
           TREESAME to any parent.

       •   <b>E</b> changes <b>quux</b> to “xyzzy”, and its merge <b>P</b> combines the strings to “quux xyzzy”.  <b>P</b> is TREESAME to <b>O</b>,
           but not to <b>E</b>.

       •   <b>X</b> is an independent root commit that added a new file <b>side</b>, and <b>Y</b> modified it.  <b>Y</b> is TREESAME to <b>X</b>.
           Its merge <b>Q</b> added <b>side</b> to <b>P</b>, and <b>Q</b> is TREESAME to <b>P</b>, but not to <b>Y</b>.

       <b>rev-list</b> walks backwards through history, including or excluding commits based on whether <b>--full-history</b>
       and/or parent rewriting (via <b>--parents</b> or <b>--children</b>) are used. The following settings are available.

       Default mode
           Commits are included if they are not TREESAME to any parent (though this can be changed, see <b>--sparse</b>
           below). If the commit was a merge, and it was TREESAME to one parent, follow only that parent. (Even
           if there are several TREESAME parents, follow only one of them.) Otherwise, follow all parents.

           This results in:

                         .-A---N---O
                        /     /   /
                       I---------D

           Note how the rule to only follow the TREESAME parent, if one is available, removed <b>B</b> from
           consideration entirely.  <b>C</b> was considered via <b>N</b>, but is TREESAME. Root commits are compared to an
           empty tree, so <b>I</b> is !TREESAME.

           Parent/child relations are only visible with <b>--parents</b>, but that does not affect the commits selected
           in default mode, so we have shown the parent lines.

       --full-history without parent rewriting
           This mode differs from the default in one point: always follow all parents of a merge, even if it is
           TREESAME to one of them. Even if more than one side of the merge has commits that are included, this
           does not imply that the merge itself is! In the example, we get

                       I  A  B  N  D  O  P  Q

           <b>M</b> was excluded because it is TREESAME to both parents.  <b>E</b>, <b>C</b> and <b>B</b> were all walked, but only <b>B</b> was
           !TREESAME, so the others do not appear.

           Note that without parent rewriting, it is not really possible to talk about the parent/child
           relationships between the commits, so we show them disconnected.

       --full-history with parent rewriting
           Ordinary commits are only included if they are !TREESAME (though this can be changed, see <b>--sparse</b>
           below).

           Merges are always included. However, their parent list is rewritten: Along each parent, prune away
           commits that are not included themselves. This results in

                         .-A---M---N---O---P---Q
                        /     /   /   /   /
                       I     B   /   D   /
                        \   /   /   /   /
                         `-------------'

           Compare to <b>--full-history</b> without rewriting above. Note that <b>E</b> was pruned away because it is
           TREESAME, but the parent list of P was rewritten to contain <b>E</b>'s parent <b>I</b>. The same happened for <b>C</b> and
           <b>N</b>, and <b>X</b>, <b>Y</b> and <b>Q</b>.

       In addition to the above settings, you can change whether TREESAME affects inclusion:

       --dense
           Commits that are walked are included if they are not TREESAME to any parent.

       --sparse
           All commits that are walked are included.

           Note that without <b>--full-history</b>, this still simplifies merges: if one of the parents is TREESAME, we
           follow only that one, so the other sides of the merge are never walked.

       --simplify-merges
           First, build a history graph in the same way that <b>--full-history</b> with parent rewriting does (see
           above).

           Then simplify each commit <b>C</b> to its replacement <b>C</b>' in the final history according to the following
           rules:

           •   Set <b>C</b>' to <b>C</b>.

           •   Replace each parent <b>P</b> of <b>C</b>' with its simplification <b>P</b>'. In the process, drop parents that are
               ancestors of other parents or that are root commits TREESAME to an empty tree, and remove
               duplicates, but take care to never drop all parents that we are TREESAME to.

           •   If after this parent rewriting, <b>C</b>' is a root or merge commit (has zero or &gt;1 parents), a boundary
               commit, or !TREESAME, it remains. Otherwise, it is replaced with its only parent.

           The effect of this is best shown by way of comparing to <b>--full-history</b> with parent rewriting. The
           example turns into:

                         .-A---M---N---O
                        /     /       /
                       I     B       D
                        \   /       /
                         `---------'

           Note the major differences in <b>N</b>, <b>P</b>, and <b>Q</b> over <b>--full-history</b>:

           •   <b>N</b>'s parent list had <b>I</b> removed, because it is an ancestor of the other parent <b>M</b>. Still, <b>N</b> remained
               because it is !TREESAME.

           •   <b>P</b>'s parent list similarly had <b>I</b> removed.  <b>P</b> was then removed completely, because it had one
               parent and is TREESAME.

           •   <b>Q</b>'s parent list had <b>Y</b> simplified to <b>X</b>.  <b>X</b> was then removed, because it was a TREESAME root.  <b>Q</b>
               was then removed completely, because it had one parent and is TREESAME.

       There is another simplification mode available:

       --ancestry-path[=&lt;commit&gt;]
           Limit the displayed commits to those which are an ancestor of &lt;commit&gt;, or which are a descendant of
           &lt;commit&gt;, or are &lt;commit&gt; itself.

           As an example use case, consider the following commit history:

                           D---E-------F
                          /     \       \
                         B---C---G---H---I---J
                        /                     \
                       A-------K---------------L--M

           A regular <u>D..M</u> computes the set of commits that are ancestors of <b>M</b>, but excludes the ones that are
           ancestors of <b>D</b>. This is useful to see what happened to the history leading to <b>M</b> since <b>D</b>, in the sense
           that “what does <b>M</b> have that did not exist in <b>D</b>”. The result in this example would be all the commits,
           except <b>A</b> and <b>B</b> (and <b>D</b> itself, of course).

           When we want to find out what commits in <b>M</b> are contaminated with the bug introduced by <b>D</b> and need
           fixing, however, we might want to view only the subset of <u>D..M</u> that are actually descendants of <b>D</b>,
           i.e. excluding <b>C</b> and <b>K</b>. This is exactly what the <b>--ancestry-path</b> option does. Applied to the <u>D..M</u>
           range, it results in:

                               E-------F
                                \       \
                                 G---H---I---J
                                              \
                                               L--M

           We can also use <b>--ancestry-path=D</b> instead of <b>--ancestry-path</b> which means the same thing when applied
           to the <u>D..M</u> range but is just more explicit.

           If we instead are interested in a given topic within this range, and all commits affected by that
           topic, we may only want to view the subset of <b>D..M</b> which contain that topic in their ancestry path.
           So, using <b>--ancestry-path=H</b> <b>D..M</b> for example would result in:

                               E
                                \
                                 G---H---I---J
                                              \
                                               L--M

           Whereas <b>--ancestry-path=K</b> <b>D..M</b> would result in

                               K---------------L--M

       Before discussing another option, <b>--show-pulls</b>, we need to create a new example history.

       A common problem users face when looking at simplified history is that a commit they know changed a file
       somehow does not appear in the file’s simplified history. Let’s demonstrate a new example and show how
       options such as <b>--full-history</b> and <b>--simplify-merges</b> works in that case:

                     .-A---M-----C--N---O---P
                    /     / \  \  \/   /   /
                   I     B   \  R-'`-Z'   /
                    \   /     \/         /
                     \ /      /\        /
                      `---X--'  `---Y--'

       For this example, suppose <b>I</b> created <b>file.txt</b> which was modified by <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, and <b>X</b> in different ways. The
       single-parent commits <b>C</b>, <b>Z</b>, and <b>Y</b> do not change <b>file.txt</b>. The merge commit <b>M</b> was created by resolving the
       merge conflict to include both changes from <b>A</b> and <b>B</b> and hence is not TREESAME to either. The merge commit
       <b>R</b>, however, was created by ignoring the contents of <b>file.txt</b> at <b>M</b> and taking only the contents of
       <b>file.txt</b> at <b>X</b>. Hence, <b>R</b> is TREESAME to <b>X</b> but not <b>M</b>. Finally, the natural merge resolution to create <b>N</b> is
       to take the contents of <b>file.txt</b> at <b>R</b>, so <b>N</b> is TREESAME to <b>R</b> but not <b>C</b>. The merge commits <b>O</b> and <b>P</b> are
       TREESAME to their first parents, but not to their second parents, <b>Z</b> and <b>Y</b> respectively.

       When using the default mode, <b>N</b> and <b>R</b> both have a TREESAME parent, so those edges are walked and the
       others are ignored. The resulting history graph is:

                   I---X

       When using <b>--full-history</b>, Git walks every edge. This will discover the commits <b>A</b> and <b>B</b> and the merge <b>M</b>,
       but also will reveal the merge commits <b>O</b> and <b>P</b>. With parent rewriting, the resulting graph is:

                     .-A---M--------N---O---P
                    /     / \  \  \/   /   /
                   I     B   \  R-'`--'   /
                    \   /     \/         /
                     \ /      /\        /
                      `---X--'  `------'

       Here, the merge commits <b>O</b> and <b>P</b> contribute extra noise, as they did not actually contribute a change to
       <b>file.txt</b>. They only merged a topic that was based on an older version of <b>file.txt</b>. This is a common issue
       in repositories using a workflow where many contributors work in parallel and merge their topic branches
       along a single trunk: many unrelated merges appear in the <b>--full-history</b> results.

       When using the <b>--simplify-merges</b> option, the commits <b>O</b> and <b>P</b> disappear from the results. This is because
       the rewritten second parents of <b>O</b> and <b>P</b> are reachable from their first parents. Those edges are removed
       and then the commits look like single-parent commits that are TREESAME to their parent. This also happens
       to the commit <b>N</b>, resulting in a history view as follows:

                     .-A---M--.
                    /     /    \
                   I     B      R
                    \   /      /
                     \ /      /
                      `---X--'

       In this view, we see all of the important single-parent changes from <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, and <b>X</b>. We also see the
       carefully-resolved merge <b>M</b> and the not-so-carefully-resolved merge <b>R</b>. This is usually enough information
       to determine why the commits <b>A</b> and <b>B</b> "disappeared" from history in the default view. However, there are a
       few issues with this approach.

       The first issue is performance. Unlike any previous option, the <b>--simplify-merges</b> option requires walking
       the entire commit history before returning a single result. This can make the option difficult to use for
       very large repositories.

       The second issue is one of auditing. When many contributors are working on the same repository, it is
       important which merge commits introduced a change into an important branch. The problematic merge <b>R</b> above
       is not likely to be the merge commit that was used to merge into an important branch. Instead, the merge
       <b>N</b> was used to merge <b>R</b> and <b>X</b> into the important branch. This commit may have information about why the
       change <b>X</b> came to override the changes from <b>A</b> and <b>B</b> in its commit message.

       --show-pulls
           In addition to the commits shown in the default history, show each merge commit that is not TREESAME
           to its first parent but is TREESAME to a later parent.

           When a merge commit is included by <b>--show-pulls</b>, the merge is treated as if it "pulled" the change
           from another branch. When using <b>--show-pulls</b> on this example (and no other options) the resulting
           graph is:

                       I---X---R---N

           Here, the merge commits <b>R</b> and <b>N</b> are included because they pulled the commits <b>X</b> and <b>R</b> into the base
           branch, respectively. These merges are the reason the commits <b>A</b> and <b>B</b> do not appear in the default
           history.

           When <b>--show-pulls</b> is paired with <b>--simplify-merges</b>, the graph includes all of the necessary
           information:

                         .-A---M--.   N
                        /     /    \ /
                       I     B      R
                        \   /      /
                         \ /      /
                          `---X--'

           Notice that since <b>M</b> is reachable from <b>R</b>, the edge from <b>N</b> to <b>M</b> was simplified away. However, <b>N</b> still
           appears in the history as an important commit because it "pulled" the change <b>R</b> into the main branch.

       The <b>--simplify-by-decoration</b> option allows you to view only the big picture of the topology of the
       history, by omitting commits that are not referenced by tags. Commits are marked as !TREESAME (in other
       words, kept after history simplification rules described above) if (1) they are referenced by tags, or
       (2) they change the contents of the paths given on the command line. All other commits are marked as
       TREESAME (subject to be simplified away).

   <b>Commit</b> <b>Ordering</b>
       By default, the commits are shown in reverse chronological order.

       --date-order
           Show no parents before all of its children are shown, but otherwise show commits in the commit
           timestamp order.

       --author-date-order
           Show no parents before all of its children are shown, but otherwise show commits in the author
           timestamp order.

       --topo-order
           Show no parents before all of its children are shown, and avoid showing commits on multiple lines of
           history intermixed.

           For example, in a commit history like this:

                   ---1----2----4----7
                       \              \

                        3----5----6----8---
           where the numbers denote the order of commit timestamps, <b>git</b> <b>rev-list</b> and friends with <b>--date-order</b>
           show the commits in the timestamp order: 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1.

           With <b>--topo-order</b>, they would show 8 6 5 3 7 4 2 1 (or 8 7 4 2 6 5 3 1); some older commits are shown
           before newer ones in order to avoid showing the commits from two parallel development track mixed
           together.

       --reverse
           Output the commits chosen to be shown (see Commit Limiting section above) in reverse order. Cannot be
           combined with <b>--walk-reflogs</b>.

   <b>Object</b> <b>Traversal</b>
       These options are mostly targeted for packing of Git repositories.

       --no-walk[=(sorted|unsorted)]
           Only show the given commits, but do not traverse their ancestors. This has no effect if a range is
           specified. If the argument <b>unsorted</b> is given, the commits are shown in the order they were given on
           the command line. Otherwise (if <b>sorted</b> or no argument was given), the commits are shown in reverse
           chronological order by commit time. Cannot be combined with <b>--graph</b>.

       --do-walk
           Overrides a previous <b>--no-walk</b>.

   <b>Commit</b> <b>Formatting</b>
       --pretty[=&lt;format&gt;], --format=&lt;format&gt;
           Pretty-print the contents of the commit logs in a given format, where <u>&lt;format&gt;</u> can be one of <u>oneline</u>,
           <u>short</u>, <u>medium</u>, <u>full</u>, <u>fuller</u>, <u>reference</u>, <u>email</u>, <u>raw</u>, <u>format:&lt;string&gt;</u> and <u>tformat:&lt;string&gt;</u>. When
           <u>&lt;format&gt;</u> is none of the above, and has <u>%placeholder</u> in it, it acts as if <u>--pretty=tformat:&lt;format&gt;</u>
           were given.

           See the "PRETTY FORMATS" section for some additional details for each format. When <u>=&lt;format&gt;</u> part is
           omitted, it defaults to <u>medium</u>.

           Note: you can specify the default pretty format in the repository configuration (see <b><a href="../man1/git-config.1.html">git-config</a></b>(1)).

       --abbrev-commit
           Instead of showing the full 40-byte hexadecimal commit object name, show a prefix that names the
           object uniquely. "--abbrev=&lt;n&gt;" (which also modifies diff output, if it is displayed) option can be
           used to specify the minimum length of the prefix.

           This should make "--pretty=oneline" a whole lot more readable for people using 80-column terminals.

       --no-abbrev-commit
           Show the full 40-byte hexadecimal commit object name. This negates <b>--abbrev-commit</b>, either explicit
           or implied by other options such as "--oneline". It also overrides the <b>log.abbrevCommit</b> variable.

       --oneline
           This is a shorthand for "--pretty=oneline --abbrev-commit" used together.

       --encoding=&lt;encoding&gt;
           Commit objects record the character encoding used for the log message in their encoding header; this
           option can be used to tell the command to re-code the commit log message in the encoding preferred by
           the user. For non plumbing commands this defaults to UTF-8. Note that if an object claims to be
           encoded in <b>X</b> and we are outputting in <b>X</b>, we will output the object verbatim; this means that invalid
           sequences in the original commit may be copied to the output. Likewise, if <a href="../man3/iconv.3.html">iconv</a>(3) fails to convert
           the commit, we will quietly output the original object verbatim.

       --expand-tabs=&lt;n&gt;, --expand-tabs, --no-expand-tabs
           Perform a tab expansion (replace each tab with enough spaces to fill to the next display column that
           is a multiple of <u>&lt;n&gt;</u>) in the log message before showing it in the output.  <b>--expand-tabs</b> is a
           short-hand for <b>--expand-tabs=8</b>, and <b>--no-expand-tabs</b> is a short-hand for <b>--expand-tabs=0</b>, which
           disables tab expansion.

           By default, tabs are expanded in pretty formats that indent the log message by 4 spaces (i.e.
           <u>medium</u>, which is the default, <u>full</u>, and <u>fuller</u>).

       --notes[=&lt;ref&gt;]
           Show the notes (see <b><a href="../man1/git-notes.1.html">git-notes</a></b>(1)) that annotate the commit, when showing the commit log message. This
           is the default for <b>git</b> <b>log</b>, <b>git</b> <b>show</b> and <b>git</b> <b>whatchanged</b> commands when there is no <b>--pretty</b>,
           <b>--format</b>, or <b>--oneline</b> option given on the command line.

           By default, the notes shown are from the notes refs listed in the <b>core.notesRef</b> and <b>notes.displayRef</b>
           variables (or corresponding environment overrides). See <b><a href="../man1/git-config.1.html">git-config</a></b>(1) for more details.

           With an optional <u>&lt;ref&gt;</u> argument, use the ref to find the notes to display. The ref can specify the
           full refname when it begins with <b>refs/notes/</b>; when it begins with <b>notes/</b>, <b>refs/</b> and otherwise
           <b>refs/notes/</b> is prefixed to form the full name of the ref.

           Multiple --notes options can be combined to control which notes are being displayed. Examples:
           "--notes=foo" will show only notes from "refs/notes/foo"; "--notes=foo --notes" will show both notes
           from "refs/notes/foo" and from the default notes ref(s).

       --no-notes
           Do not show notes. This negates the above <b>--notes</b> option, by resetting the list of notes refs from
           which notes are shown. Options are parsed in the order given on the command line, so e.g. "--notes
           --notes=foo --no-notes --notes=bar" will only show notes from "refs/notes/bar".

       --show-notes-by-default
           Show the default notes unless options for displaying specific notes are given.

       --show-notes[=&lt;ref&gt;], --[no-]standard-notes
           These options are deprecated. Use the above --notes/--no-notes options instead.

       --show-signature
           Check the validity of a signed commit object by passing the signature to <b>gpg</b> <b>--verify</b> and show the
           output.

       --relative-date
           Synonym for <b>--date=relative</b>.

       --date=&lt;format&gt;
           Only takes effect for dates shown in human-readable format, such as when using <b>--pretty</b>.  <b>log.date</b>
           config variable sets a default value for the log command’s <b>--date</b> option. By default, dates are shown
           in the original time zone (either committer’s or author’s). If <b>-local</b> is appended to the format
           (e.g., <b>iso-local</b>), the user’s local time zone is used instead.

           <b>--date=relative</b> shows dates relative to the current time, e.g. “2 hours ago”. The <b>-local</b> option has
           no effect for <b>--date=relative</b>.

           <b>--date=local</b> is an alias for <b>--date=default-local</b>.

           <b>--date=iso</b> (or <b>--date=iso8601</b>) shows timestamps in a ISO 8601-like format. The differences to the
           strict ISO 8601 format are:

           •   a space instead of the <b>T</b> date/time delimiter

           •   a space between time and time zone

           •   no colon between hours and minutes of the time zone

           <b>--date=iso-strict</b> (or <b>--date=iso8601-strict</b>) shows timestamps in strict ISO 8601 format.

           <b>--date=rfc</b> (or <b>--date=rfc2822</b>) shows timestamps in RFC 2822 format, often found in email messages.

           <b>--date=short</b> shows only the date, but not the time, in <b>YYYY-MM-DD</b> format.

           <b>--date=raw</b> shows the date as seconds since the epoch (1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC), followed by a space,
           and then the timezone as an offset from UTC (a <b>+</b> or <b>-</b> with four digits; the first two are hours, and
           the second two are minutes). I.e., as if the timestamp were formatted with <b>strftime</b>("%s %z")). Note
           that the <b>-local</b> option does not affect the seconds-since-epoch value (which is always measured in
           UTC), but does switch the accompanying timezone value.

           <b>--date=human</b> shows the timezone if the timezone does not match the current time-zone, and doesn’t
           print the whole date if that matches (ie skip printing year for dates that are "this year", but also
           skip the whole date itself if it’s in the last few days and we can just say what weekday it was). For
           older dates the hour and minute is also omitted.

           <b>--date=unix</b> shows the date as a Unix epoch timestamp (seconds since 1970). As with <b>--raw</b>, this is
           always in UTC and therefore <b>-local</b> has no effect.

           <b>--date=format:.</b>.. feeds the format ... to your system <b>strftime</b>, except for %s, %z, and %Z, which are
           handled internally. Use <b>--date=format:</b>%c to show the date in your system locale’s preferred format.
           See the <b>strftime</b> manual for a complete list of format placeholders. When using <b>-local</b>, the correct
           syntax is <b>--date=format-local:.</b>...

           <b>--date=default</b> is the default format, and is based on <a href="../man3/ctime.3.html">ctime</a>(3) output. It shows a single line with
           three-letter day of the week, three-letter month, day-of-month, hour-minute-seconds in "HH:MM:SS"
           format, followed by 4-digit year, plus timezone information, unless the local time zone is used, e.g.
           <b>Thu</b> <b>Jan</b> <b>1</b> <b>00:00:00</b> <b>1970</b> <b>+0000</b>.

       --parents
           Print also the parents of the commit (in the form "commit parent..."). Also enables parent rewriting,
           see <u>History</u> <u>Simplification</u> above.

       --children
           Print also the children of the commit (in the form "commit child..."). Also enables parent rewriting,
           see <u>History</u> <u>Simplification</u> above.

       --left-right
           Mark which side of a symmetric difference a commit is reachable from. Commits from the left side are
           prefixed with &lt; and those from the right with &gt;. If combined with <b>--boundary</b>, those commits are
           prefixed with <b>-</b>.

           For example, if you have this topology:

                            y---b---b  branch B
                           / \ /
                          /   .
                         /   / \
                        o---x---a---a  branch A

           you would get an output like this:

                       $ git rev-list --left-right --boundary --pretty=oneline A...B

                       &gt;bbbbbbb... 3rd on b
                       &gt;bbbbbbb... 2nd on b
                       &lt;aaaaaaa... 3rd on a
                       &lt;aaaaaaa... 2nd on a
                       -yyyyyyy... 1st on b
                       -xxxxxxx... 1st on a

       --graph
           Draw a text-based graphical representation of the commit history on the left hand side of the output.
           This may cause extra lines to be printed in between commits, in order for the graph history to be
           drawn properly. Cannot be combined with <b>--no-walk</b>.

           This enables parent rewriting, see <u>History</u> <u>Simplification</u> above.

           This implies the <b>--topo-order</b> option by default, but the <b>--date-order</b> option may also be specified.

       --show-linear-break[=&lt;barrier&gt;]
           When --graph is not used, all history branches are flattened which can make it hard to see that the
           two consecutive commits do not belong to a linear branch. This option puts a barrier in between them
           in that case. If <u>&lt;barrier&gt;</u> is specified, it is the string that will be shown instead of the default
           one.

</pre><h4><b>PRETTY</b> <b>FORMATS</b></h4><pre>
       If the commit is a merge, and if the pretty-format is not <u>oneline</u>, <u>email</u> or <u>raw</u>, an additional line is
       inserted before the <u>Author:</u> line. This line begins with "Merge: " and the hashes of ancestral commits are
       printed, separated by spaces. Note that the listed commits may not necessarily be the list of the <b>direct</b>
       parent commits if you have limited your view of history: for example, if you are only interested in
       changes related to a certain directory or file.

       There are several built-in formats, and you can define additional formats by setting a pretty.&lt;name&gt;
       config option to either another format name, or a <u>format:</u> string, as described below (see <b><a href="../man1/git-config.1.html">git-config</a></b>(1)).
       Here are the details of the built-in formats:

       •   <u>oneline</u>

               &lt;hash&gt; &lt;title-line&gt;

           This is designed to be as compact as possible.

       •   <u>short</u>

               commit &lt;hash&gt;
               Author: &lt;author&gt;

               &lt;title-line&gt;

       •   <u>medium</u>

               commit &lt;hash&gt;
               Author: &lt;author&gt;
               Date:   &lt;author-date&gt;

               &lt;title-line&gt;

               &lt;full-commit-message&gt;

       •   <u>full</u>

               commit &lt;hash&gt;
               Author: &lt;author&gt;
               Commit: &lt;committer&gt;

               &lt;title-line&gt;

               &lt;full-commit-message&gt;

       •   <u>fuller</u>

               commit &lt;hash&gt;
               Author:     &lt;author&gt;
               AuthorDate: &lt;author-date&gt;
               Commit:     &lt;committer&gt;
               CommitDate: &lt;committer-date&gt;

               &lt;title-line&gt;

               &lt;full-commit-message&gt;

       •   <u>reference</u>

               &lt;abbrev-hash&gt; (&lt;title-line&gt;, &lt;short-author-date&gt;)

           This format is used to refer to another commit in a commit message and is the same as
           <b>--pretty=</b>'format:%C(<b>auto</b>)%h (%s, %ad)'. By default, the date is formatted with <b>--date=short</b> unless
           another <b>--date</b> option is explicitly specified. As with any <b>format:</b> with format placeholders, its
           output is not affected by other options like <b>--decorate</b> and <b>--walk-reflogs</b>.

       •   <u>email</u>

               From &lt;hash&gt; &lt;date&gt;
               From: &lt;author&gt;
               Date: &lt;author-date&gt;
               Subject: [PATCH] &lt;title-line&gt;

               &lt;full-commit-message&gt;

       •   <u>mboxrd</u>

           Like <u>email</u>, but lines in the commit message starting with "From " (preceded by zero or more "&gt;") are
           quoted with "&gt;" so they aren’t confused as starting a new commit.

       •   <u>raw</u>

           The <u>raw</u> format shows the entire commit exactly as stored in the commit object. Notably, the hashes
           are displayed in full, regardless of whether --abbrev or --no-abbrev are used, and <u>parents</u>
           information show the true parent commits, without taking grafts or history simplification into
           account. Note that this format affects the way commits are displayed, but not the way the diff is
           shown e.g. with <b>git</b> <b>log</b> <b>--raw</b>. To get full object names in a raw diff format, use <b>--no-abbrev</b>.

       •   <u>format:&lt;format-string&gt;</u>

           The <u>format:&lt;format-string&gt;</u> format allows you to specify which information you want to show. It works
           a little bit like printf format, with the notable exception that you get a newline with <u>%n</u> instead of
           <u>\n</u>.

           E.g, <u>format:"The</u> <u>author</u> <u>of</u> <u>%h</u> <u>was</u> <u>%an,</u> <u>%ar%nThe</u> <u>title</u> <u>was</u> <u>&gt;&gt;%s&lt;&lt;%n"</u> would show something like this:

               The author of fe6e0ee was Junio C Hamano, 23 hours ago
               The title was &gt;&gt;t4119: test autocomputing -p&lt;n&gt; for traditional diff input.&lt;&lt;

           The placeholders are:

           •   Placeholders that expand to a single literal character:

               <u>%n</u>
                   newline

               <u>%%</u>
                   a raw <u>%</u>

               <u>%x00</u>
                   <u>%x</u> followed by two hexadecimal digits is replaced with a byte with the hexadecimal digits'
                   value (we will call this "literal formatting code" in the rest of this document).

           •   Placeholders that affect formatting of later placeholders:

               <u>%Cred</u>
                   switch color to red

               <u>%Cgreen</u>
                   switch color to green

               <u>%Cblue</u>
                   switch color to blue

               <u>%Creset</u>
                   reset color

               <u>%C(...)</u>
                   color specification, as described under Values in the "CONFIGURATION FILE" section of <b><a href="../man1/gitconfig.1.html">git-</a></b>
                   <b><a href="../man1/gitconfig.1.html">config</a></b>(1). By default, colors are shown only when enabled for log output (by <b>color.diff</b>,
                   <b>color.ui</b>, or <b>--color</b>, and respecting the <b>auto</b> settings of the former if we are going to a
                   terminal). %C(<b>auto,...</b>) is accepted as a historical synonym for the default (e.g.,
                   %C(<b>auto,red</b>)). Specifying %C(<b>always,...</b>) will show the colors even when color is not
                   otherwise enabled (though consider just using <b>--color=always</b> to enable color for the whole
                   output, including this format and anything else git might color).  <b>auto</b> alone (i.e. %C(<b>auto</b>))
                   will turn on auto coloring on the next placeholders until the color is switched again.

               <u>%m</u>

               <u>%w([&lt;w&gt;[,&lt;i1&gt;[,&lt;i2&gt;]]])</u>
                   switch line wrapping, like the -w option of <b><a href="../man1/git-shortlog.1.html">git-shortlog</a></b>(1).

               <u>%&lt;(</u> <u>&lt;N&gt;</u> <u>[,trunc|ltrunc|mtrunc])</u>
                   make the next placeholder take at least N column widths, padding spaces on the right if
                   necessary. Optionally truncate (with ellipsis <u>..</u>) at the left (ltrunc) <b>..ft</b>, the middle
                   (mtrunc) <b>mi..le</b>, or the end (trunc) <b>rig.</b>., if the output is longer than N columns. Note 1:
                   that truncating only works correctly with N &gt;= 2. Note 2: spaces around the N and M (see
                   below) values are optional. Note 3: Emojis and other wide characters will take two display
                   columns, which may over-run column boundaries. Note 4: decomposed character combining marks
                   may be misplaced at padding boundaries.

               <u>%&lt;|(</u> <u>&lt;M&gt;</u> <u>)</u>
                   make the next placeholder take at least until Mth display column, padding spaces on the right
                   if necessary. Use negative M values for column positions measured from the right hand edge of
                   the terminal window.

                   spaces than given and there are spaces on its left, use those spaces

               <u>%&gt;&lt;(</u> <u>&lt;N&gt;</u> <u>)</u>, <u>%&gt;&lt;|(</u> <u>&lt;M&gt;</u> <u>)</u>

                   ref names without the " (", ")" wrapping.

               <u>%(decorate[:&lt;options&gt;])</u>
                   ref names with custom decorations. The <b>decorate</b> string may be followed by a colon and zero or
                   more comma-separated options. Option values may contain literal formatting codes. These must
                   be used for commas (%x2C) and closing parentheses (%x29), due to their role in the option
                   syntax.

                   •   <u>prefix=&lt;value&gt;</u>: Shown before the list of ref names. Defaults to " (".

                   •   <u>suffix=&lt;value&gt;</u>: Shown after the list of ref names. Defaults to ")".

                   For example, to produce decorations with no wrapping or tag annotations, and spaces as
                   separators:

                   %(<b>decorate:prefix=,suffix=,tag=,separator=</b> )

               <u>%(describe[:&lt;options&gt;])</u>
                   human-readable name, like <b><a href="../man1/git-describe.1.html">git-describe</a></b>(1); empty string for undescribable commits. The
                   <b>describe</b> string may be followed by a colon and zero or more comma-separated options.
                   Descriptions can be inconsistent when tags are added or removed at the same time.

                   •   <u>tags[=&lt;bool-value&gt;]</u>: Instead of only considering annotated tags, consider lightweight
                       tags as well.

                   •   <u>abbrev=&lt;number&gt;</u>: Instead of using the default number of hexadecimal digits (which will
                       vary according to the number of objects in the repository with a default of 7) of the
                       abbreviated object name, use &lt;number&gt; digits, or as many digits as needed to form a
                       unique object name.

                   •   <u>match=&lt;pattern&gt;</u>: Only consider tags matching the given <b>glob</b>(<b>7</b>) pattern, excluding the
                       "refs/tags/" prefix.

                   •   <u>exclude=&lt;pattern&gt;</u>: Do not consider tags matching the given <b>glob</b>(<b>7</b>) pattern, excluding the
                       "refs/tags/" prefix.

               <u>%S</u>
                   ref name given on the command line by which the commit was reached (like <b>git</b> <b>log</b> <b>--source</b>),
                   only works with <b>git</b> <b>log</b>

                   unknown validity, "X" for a good signature that has expired, "Y" for a good signature made by
                   an expired key, "R" for a good signature made by a revoked key, "E" if the signature cannot
                   be checked (e.g. missing key) and "N" for no signature

               <u>%GS</u>
                   show the name of the signer for a signed commit

               <u>%GK</u>
                   show the key used to sign a signed commit

                   show the fingerprint of the key used to sign a signed commit

               <u>%GP</u>
                   show the fingerprint of the primary key whose subkey was used to sign a signed commit

               <u>%GT</u>
                   show the trust level for the key used to sign a signed commit

               <u>%gD</u>
                   reflog selector, e.g., <b>refs/stash@</b>{1} or <b>refs/stash@</b>{2 <b>minutes</b> <b>ago</b>}; the format follows the
                   rules described for the <b>-g</b> option. The portion before the <b>@</b> is the refname as given on the
                   command line (so <b>git</b> <b>log</b> <b>-g</b> <b>refs/heads/master</b> would yield <b>refs/heads/master@</b>{0}).

               <u>%gd</u>
                   shortened reflog selector; same as %gD, but the refname portion is shortened for human
                   readability (so <b>refs/heads/master</b> becomes just <b>master</b>).

               <u>%gn</u>
                   reflog identity name

               <u>%gN</u>
                   reflog identity name (respecting .mailmap, see <b><a href="../man1/git-shortlog.1.html">git-shortlog</a></b>(1) or <b><a href="../man1/git-blame.1.html">git-blame</a></b>(1))

               <u>%gs</u>
                   reflog subject

               <u>%(trailers[:&lt;options&gt;])</u>
                   display the trailers of the body as interpreted by <b><a href="../man1/git-interpret-trailers.1.html">git-interpret-trailers</a></b>(1). The <b>trailers</b>
                   string may be followed by a colon and zero or more comma-separated options. If any option is
                   provided multiple times, the last occurrence wins.

                   •   <u>key=&lt;key&gt;</u>: only show trailers with specified &lt;key&gt;. Matching is done case-insensitively
                       and trailing colon is optional. If option is given multiple times trailer lines matching
                       any of the keys are shown. This option automatically enables the <b>only</b> option so that
                       non-trailer lines in the trailer block are hidden. If that is not desired it can be
                       disabled with <b>only=false</b>. E.g., %(<b>trailers:key=Reviewed-by</b>) shows trailer lines with key
                       <b>Reviewed-by</b>.

                   •   <u>only[=&lt;bool&gt;]</u>: select whether non-trailer lines from the trailer block should be
                       included.

                   •   <u>separator=&lt;sep&gt;</u>: specify the separator inserted between trailer lines. Defaults to a line
                       feed character. The string &lt;sep&gt; may contain the literal formatting codes described
                       above. To use comma as separator one must use %x2C as it would otherwise be parsed as
                       next option. E.g., %(<b>trailers:key=Ticket,separator=</b>%x2C ) shows all trailer lines whose
                       key is "Ticket" separated by a comma and a space.

                   •   <u>unfold[=&lt;bool&gt;]</u>: make it behave as if interpret-trailer’s <b>--unfold</b> option was given.
                       E.g., %(<b>trailers:only,unfold=true</b>) unfolds and shows all trailer lines.

                   •   <u>keyonly[=&lt;bool&gt;]</u>: only show the key part of the trailer.

                   •   <u>valueonly[=&lt;bool&gt;]</u>: only show the value part of the trailer.

                   •   <u>key_value_separator=&lt;sep&gt;</u>: specify the separator inserted between the key and value of
                       each trailer. Defaults to ": ". Otherwise it shares the same semantics as <u>separator=&lt;sep&gt;</u>
                       above.

           <b>Note</b>

           Some placeholders may depend on other options given to the revision traversal engine. For example,
           the %g* reflog options will insert an empty string unless we are traversing reflog entries (e.g., by
           <b>git</b> <b>log</b> <b>-g</b>). The %d and %D placeholders will use the "short" decoration format if <b>--decorate</b> was not
           already provided on the command line.

       The boolean options accept an optional value [<b>=</b><u>&lt;bool-value&gt;</u>]. The values <b>true</b>, <b>false</b>, <b>on</b>, <b>off</b> etc. are
       all accepted. See the "boolean" sub-section in "EXAMPLES" in <b><a href="../man1/git-config.1.html">git-config</a></b>(1). If a boolean option is given
       with no value, it’s enabled.

       If you add a <b>+</b> (plus sign) after <u>%</u> of a placeholder, a line-feed is inserted immediately before the
       expansion if and only if the placeholder expands to a non-empty string.

       If you add a <b>-</b> (minus sign) after <u>%</u> of a placeholder, all consecutive line-feeds immediately preceding
       the expansion are deleted if and only if the placeholder expands to an empty string.

       If you add a ` ` (space) after <u>%</u> of a placeholder, a space is inserted immediately before the expansion
       if and only if the placeholder expands to a non-empty string.

       •   <u>tformat:</u>

           The <u>tformat:</u> format works exactly like <u>format:</u>, except that it provides "terminator" semantics
           instead of "separator" semantics. In other words, each commit has the message terminator character
           (usually a newline) appended, rather than a separator placed between entries. This means that the
           final entry of a single-line format will be properly terminated with a new line, just as the
           "oneline" format does. For example:

               $ git log -2 --pretty=format:%h 4da45bef \
                 | perl -pe '$_ .= " -- NO NEWLINE\n" unless /\n/'
               4da45be
               7134973 -- NO NEWLINE

               $ git log -2 --pretty=tformat:%h 4da45bef \
                 | perl -pe '$_ .= " -- NO NEWLINE\n" unless /\n/'
               4da45be
               7134973

           In addition, any unrecognized string that has a % in it is interpreted as if it has <b>tformat:</b> in front
           of it. For example, these two are equivalent:

               $ git log -2 --pretty=tformat:%h 4da45bef
               $ git log -2 --pretty=%h 4da45bef

</pre><h4><b>DIFF</b> <b>FORMATTING</b></h4><pre>
       By default, <b>git</b> <b>log</b> does not generate any diff output. The options below can be used to show the changes
       made by each commit.

       Note that unless one of <b>--diff-merges</b> variants (including short <b>-m</b>, <b>-c</b>, <b>--cc</b>, and <b>--dd</b> options) is
       explicitly given, merge commits will not show a diff, even if a diff format like <b>--patch</b> is selected, nor
       will they match search options like <b>-S</b>. The exception is when <b>--first-parent</b> is in use, in which case
       <b>first-parent</b> is the default format for merge commits.

       <b>-p</b>, <b>-u</b>, <b>--patch</b>
           Generate patch (see the section called “GENERATING PATCH TEXT WITH -P”).

       <b>-s</b>, <b>--no-patch</b>
           Suppress all output from the diff machinery. Useful for commands like <b>git</b> <b>show</b> that show the patch by
           default to squelch their output, or to cancel the effect of options like <b>--patch</b>, <b>--stat</b> earlier on
           the command line in an alias.

       -m
           Show diffs for merge commits in the default format. This is similar to <b>--diff-merges=on</b>, except <b>-m</b>
           will produce no output unless <b>-p</b> is given as well.

       -c
           Produce combined diff output for merge commits. Shortcut for <b>--diff-merges=combined</b> <b>-p</b>.

       --cc
           Produce dense combined diff output for merge commits. Shortcut for <b>--diff-merges=dense-combined</b> <b>-p</b>.

       --dd
           Produce diff with respect to first parent for both merge and regular commits. Shortcut for
           <b>--diff-merges=first-parent</b> <b>-p</b>.

       --remerge-diff
           Produce remerge-diff output for merge commits. Shortcut for <b>--diff-merges=remerge</b> <b>-p</b>.

       --no-diff-merges
           Synonym for <b>--diff-merges=off</b>.

       --diff-merges=&lt;format&gt;
           Specify diff format to be used for merge commits. Default is <b>f</b> unless <b>--first-parent</b> is in use, in
           which case <b>first-parent</b> is the default.

           The following formats are supported:

           off, none
               Disable output of diffs for merge commits. Useful to override implied value.

           on, m
               Make diff output for merge commits to be shown in the default format. The default format can be
               changed using <b>log.diffMerges</b> configuration variable, whose default value is <b>separate</b>.

           first-parent, 1
               Show full diff with respect to first parent. This is the same format as <b>--patch</b> produces for
               non-merge commits.

           separate
               Show full diff with respect to each of parents. Separate log entry and diff is generated for each
               parent.

           combined, c
               Show differences from each of the parents to the merge result simultaneously instead of showing
               pairwise diff between a parent and the result one at a time. Furthermore, it lists only files
               which were modified from all parents.

           dense-combined, cc
               Further compress output produced by <b>--diff-merges=combined</b> by omitting uninteresting hunks whose
               contents in the parents have only two variants and the merge result picks one of them without
               modification.

           remerge, r
               Remerge two-parent merge commits to create a temporary tree object—potentially containing files
               with conflict markers and such. A diff is then shown between that temporary tree and the actual
               merge commit.

               The output emitted when this option is used is subject to change, and so is its interaction with
               other options (unless explicitly documented).

       --combined-all-paths
           Cause combined diffs (used for merge commits) to list the name of the file from all parents. It thus
           only has effect when <b>--diff-merges=</b>[<b>dense-</b>]<b>combined</b> is in use, and is likely only useful if filename
           changes are detected (i.e. when either rename or copy detection have been requested).

       <b>-U</b><u>&lt;n&gt;</u>, <b>--unified=</b><u>&lt;n&gt;</u>
           Generate diffs with <u>&lt;n&gt;</u> lines of context instead of the usual three. Implies <b>--patch</b>.

       <b>--output=</b><u>&lt;file&gt;</u>
           Output to a specific file instead of stdout.

       <b>--output-indicator-new=</b><u>&lt;char&gt;</u>, <b>--output-indicator-old=</b><u>&lt;char&gt;</u>, <b>--output-indicator-context=</b><u>&lt;char&gt;</u>
           Specify the character used to indicate new, old or context lines in the generated patch. Normally
           they are <b>+</b>, <b>-</b> and ' ' respectively.

       <b>--raw</b>
           For each commit, show a summary of changes using the raw diff format. See the "RAW OUTPUT FORMAT"
           section of <b><a href="../man1/git-diff.1.html">git-diff</a></b>(1). This is different from showing the log itself in raw format, which you can
           achieve with <b>--format=raw</b>.

       <b>--patch-with-raw</b>
           Synonym for <b>-p</b> <b>--raw</b>.

       <b>-t</b>
           Show the tree objects in the diff output.

       <b>--indent-heuristic</b>
           Enable the heuristic that shifts diff hunk boundaries to make patches easier to read. This is the
           default.

       <b>--no-indent-heuristic</b>
           Disable the indent heuristic.

       <b>--minimal</b>
           Spend extra time to make sure the smallest possible diff is produced.

       <b>--patience</b>
           Generate a diff using the "patience diff" algorithm.

       <b>--histogram</b>
           Generate a diff using the "histogram diff" algorithm.

       <b>--anchored=</b><u>&lt;text&gt;</u>
           Generate a diff using the "anchored diff" algorithm.

           This option may be specified more than once.

           If a line exists in both the source and destination, exists only once, and starts with <u>&lt;text&gt;</u>, this
           algorithm attempts to prevent it from appearing as a deletion or addition in the output. It uses the
           "patience diff" algorithm internally.

       <b>--diff-algorithm=</b>(<b>patience</b>|<b>minimal</b>|<b>histogram</b>|<b>myers</b>)
           Choose a diff algorithm. The variants are as follows:

           <b>default</b>, <b>myers</b>
               The basic greedy diff algorithm. Currently, this is the default.

           <b>minimal</b>
               Spend extra time to make sure the smallest possible diff is produced.

           <b>patience</b>
               Use "patience diff" algorithm when generating patches.

           <b>histogram</b>
               This algorithm extends the patience algorithm to "support low-occurrence common elements".

           For instance, if you configured the <b>diff.algorithm</b> variable to a non-default value and want to use
           the default one, then you have to use <b>--diff-algorithm=default</b> option.

       <b>--stat</b>[<b>=</b><u>&lt;width&gt;</u>[<b>,</b><u>&lt;name-width&gt;</u>[<b>,</b><u>&lt;count&gt;</u>]]]
           Generate a diffstat. By default, as much space as necessary will be used for the filename part, and
           the rest for the graph part. Maximum width defaults to terminal width, or 80 columns if not connected
           to a terminal, and can be overridden by <u>&lt;width&gt;</u>. The width of the filename part can be limited by
           giving another width <u>&lt;name-width&gt;</u> after a comma or by setting <b>diff.statNameWidth=</b><u>&lt;name-width&gt;</u>. The
           width of the graph part can be limited by using <b>--stat-graph-width=</b><u>&lt;graph-width&gt;</u> or by setting
           <b>diff.statGraphWidth=</b><u>&lt;graph-width&gt;</u>. Using <b>--stat</b> or <b>--stat-graph-width</b> affects all commands generating
           a stat graph, while setting <b>diff.statNameWidth</b> or <b>diff.statGraphWidth</b> does not affect <b>git</b>
           <b>format-patch</b>. By giving a third parameter <u>&lt;count&gt;</u>, you can limit the output to the first <u>&lt;count&gt;</u>
           lines, followed by ... if there are more.

           These parameters can also be set individually with <b>--stat-width=</b><u>&lt;width&gt;</u>,
           <b>--stat-name-width=</b><u>&lt;name-width&gt;</u> and <b>--stat-count=</b><u>&lt;count&gt;</u>.

       <b>--compact-summary</b>
           Output a condensed summary of extended header information such as file creations or deletions ("new"
           or "gone", optionally <b>+l</b> if it’s a symlink) and mode changes (<b>+x</b> or <b>-x</b> for adding or removing
           executable bit respectively) in diffstat. The information is put between the filename part and the
           graph part. Implies <b>--stat</b>.

       <b>--numstat</b>
           Similar to <b>--stat</b>, but shows number of added and deleted lines in decimal notation and pathname
           without abbreviation, to make it more machine friendly. For binary files, outputs two <b>-</b> instead of
           saying <b>0</b> <b>0</b>.

       <b>--shortstat</b>
           Output only the last line of the <b>--stat</b> format containing total number of modified files, as well as
           number of added and deleted lines.

       <b>-X</b> [<u>&lt;param&gt;</u><b>,.</b>..], <b>--dirstat</b>[<b>=</b><u>&lt;param&gt;</u><b>,.</b>..]
           Output the distribution of relative amount of changes for each sub-directory. The behavior of
           <b>--dirstat</b> can be customized by passing it a comma separated list of parameters. The defaults are
           controlled by the <b>diff.dirstat</b> configuration variable (see <b><a href="../man1/git-config.1.html">git-config</a></b>(1)). The following parameters
           are available:

           <b>changes</b>
               Compute the dirstat numbers by counting the lines that have been removed from the source, or
               added to the destination. This ignores the amount of pure code movements within a file. In other
               words, rearranging lines in a file is not counted as much as other changes. This is the default
               behavior when no parameter is given.

           <b>lines</b>
               Compute the dirstat numbers by doing the regular line-based diff analysis, and summing the
               removed/added line counts. (For binary files, count 64-byte chunks instead, since binary files
               have no natural concept of lines). This is a more expensive <b>--dirstat</b> behavior than the <b>changes</b>
               behavior, but it does count rearranged lines within a file as much as other changes. The
               resulting output is consistent with what you get from the other <b>--</b>*stat options.

           <b>files</b>
               Compute the dirstat numbers by counting the number of files changed. Each changed file counts
               equally in the dirstat analysis. This is the computationally cheapest <b>--dirstat</b> behavior, since
               it does not have to look at the file contents at all.

           <b>cumulative</b>
               Count changes in a child directory for the parent directory as well. Note that when using
               <b>cumulative</b>, the sum of the percentages reported may exceed 100%. The default (non-cumulative)
               behavior can be specified with the <b>noncumulative</b> parameter.

           <u>&lt;limit&gt;</u>
               An integer parameter specifies a cut-off percent (3% by default). Directories contributing less
               than this percentage of the changes are not shown in the output.

           Example: The following will count changed files, while ignoring directories with less than 10% of the
           total amount of changed files, and accumulating child directory counts in the parent directories:
           <b>--dirstat=files,10,cumulative</b>.

       <b>--cumulative</b>
           Synonym for <b>--dirstat=cumulative</b>.

       <b>--dirstat-by-file</b>[<b>=</b><u>&lt;param&gt;</u><b>,.</b>..]
           Synonym for <b>--dirstat=files,</b><u>&lt;param&gt;</u><b>,.</b>...

       <b>--summary</b>
           Output a condensed summary of extended header information such as creations, renames and mode
           changes.

       <b>--patch-with-stat</b>
           Synonym for <b>-p</b> <b>--stat</b>.

       <b>-z</b>
           Separate the commits with <u>NUL</u>s instead of newlines.

           Also, when <b>--raw</b> or <b>--numstat</b> has been given, do not munge pathnames and use <u>NUL</u>s as output field
           terminators.

           Without this option, pathnames with "unusual" characters are quoted as explained for the
           configuration variable <b>core.quotePath</b> (see <b><a href="../man1/git-config.1.html">git-config</a></b>(1)).

       <b>--name-only</b>
           Show only the name of each changed file in the post-image tree. The file names are often encoded in
           UTF-8. For more information see the discussion about encoding in the <b><a href="../man1/git-log.1.html">git-log</a></b>(1) manual page.

       <b>--name-status</b>
           Show only the name(s) and status of each changed file. See the description of the <b>--diff-filter</b>
           option on what the status letters mean. Just like <b>--name-only</b> the file names are often encoded in
           UTF-8.

       <b>--submodule</b>[<b>=</b><u>&lt;format&gt;</u>]
           Specify how differences in submodules are shown. When specifying <b>--submodule=short</b> the <b>short</b> format
           is used. This format just shows the names of the commits at the beginning and end of the range. When
           <b>--submodule</b> or <b>--submodule=log</b> is specified, the <b>log</b> format is used. This format lists the commits in
           the range like <b><a href="../man1/git-submodule.1.html">git-submodule</a></b>(1) <b>summary</b> does. When <b>--submodule=diff</b> is specified, the <b>diff</b> format is
           used. This format shows an inline diff of the changes in the submodule contents between the commit
           range. Defaults to <b>diff.submodule</b> or the <b>short</b> format if the config option is unset.

       <b>--color</b>[<b>=</b><u>&lt;when&gt;</u>]
           Show colored diff.  <b>--color</b> (i.e. without <b>=</b><u>&lt;when&gt;</u>) is the same as <b>--color=always</b>.  <u>&lt;when&gt;</u> can be one
           of <b>always</b>, <b>never</b>, or <b>auto</b>.

       <b>--no-color</b>
           Turn off colored diff. It is the same as <b>--color=never</b>.

       <b>--color-moved</b>[<b>=</b><u>&lt;mode&gt;</u>]
           Moved lines of code are colored differently. The <u>&lt;mode&gt;</u> defaults to <b>no</b> if the option is not given and
           to <b>zebra</b> if the option with no mode is given. The mode must be one of:

           <b>no</b>
               Moved lines are not highlighted.

           <b>default</b>
               Is a synonym for <b>zebra</b>. This may change to a more sensible mode in the future.

           <b>plain</b>
               Any line that is added in one location and was removed in another location will be colored with
               <b>color.diff.newMoved</b>. Similarly <b>color.diff.oldMoved</b> will be used for removed lines that are added
               somewhere else in the diff. This mode picks up any moved line, but it is not very useful in a
               review to determine if a block of code was moved without permutation.

           <b>blocks</b>
               Blocks of moved text of at least 20 alphanumeric characters are detected greedily. The detected
               blocks are painted using either the <b>color.diff.</b>(<b>old</b>|<b>new</b>)<b>Moved</b> color. Adjacent blocks cannot be
               told apart.

           <b>zebra</b>
               Blocks of moved text are detected as in <b>blocks</b> mode. The blocks are painted using either the
               <b>color.diff.</b>(<b>old</b>|<b>new</b>)<b>Moved</b> color or <b>color.diff.</b>(<b>old</b>|<b>new</b>)<b>MovedAlternative</b>. The change between the
               two colors indicates that a new block was detected.

           <b>dimmed-zebra</b>
               Similar to <b>zebra</b>, but additional dimming of uninteresting parts of moved code is performed. The
               bordering lines of two adjacent blocks are considered interesting, the rest is uninteresting.
               <b>dimmed_zebra</b> is a deprecated synonym.

       <b>--no-color-moved</b>
           Turn off move detection. This can be used to override configuration settings. It is the same as
           <b>--color-moved=no</b>.

       <b>--color-moved-ws=</b><u>&lt;mode&gt;</u><b>,.</b>..
           This configures how whitespace is ignored when performing the move detection for <b>--color-moved</b>. These
           modes can be given as a comma separated list:

           <b>no</b>
               Do not ignore whitespace when performing move detection.

           <b>ignore-space-at-eol</b>
               Ignore changes in whitespace at EOL.

           <b>ignore-space-change</b>
               Ignore changes in amount of whitespace. This ignores whitespace at line end, and considers all
               other sequences of one or more whitespace characters to be equivalent.

           <b>ignore-all-space</b>
               Ignore whitespace when comparing lines. This ignores differences even if one line has whitespace
               where the other line has none.

           <b>allow-indentation-change</b>
               Initially ignore any whitespace in the move detection, then group the moved code blocks only into
               a block if the change in whitespace is the same per line. This is incompatible with the other
               modes.

       <b>--no-color-moved-ws</b>
           Do not ignore whitespace when performing move detection. This can be used to override configuration
           settings. It is the same as <b>--color-moved-ws=no</b>.

       <b>--word-diff</b>[<b>=</b><u>&lt;mode&gt;</u>]
           By default, words are delimited by whitespace; see <b>--word-diff-regex</b> below. The <u>&lt;mode&gt;</u> defaults to
           <b>plain</b>, and must be one of:

           <b>color</b>
               Highlight changed words using only colors. Implies <b>--color</b>.

           <b>plain</b>
               Show words as <b>[-removed-]</b> and <b>{added</b>}. Makes no attempts to escape the delimiters if they appear
               in the input, so the output may be ambiguous.

           <b>porcelain</b>
               Use a special line-based format intended for script consumption. Added/removed/unchanged runs are
               printed in the usual unified diff format, starting with a <b>+</b>/<b>-</b>/` ` character at the beginning of
               the line and extending to the end of the line. Newlines in the input are represented by a tilde <b>~</b>
               on a line of its own.

           <b>none</b>
               Disable word diff again.

           Note that despite the name of the first mode, color is used to highlight the changed parts in all
           modes if enabled.

       <b>--word-diff-regex=</b><u>&lt;regex&gt;</u>
           Use <u>&lt;regex&gt;</u> to decide what a word is, instead of considering runs of non-whitespace to be a word.
           Also implies <b>--word-diff</b> unless it was already enabled.

           Every non-overlapping match of the <u>&lt;regex&gt;</u> is considered a word. Anything between these matches is
           considered whitespace and ignored(!) for the purposes of finding differences. You may want to append
           |[<b>^</b>[<b>:space:</b>]] to your regular expression to make sure that it matches all non-whitespace characters.
           A match that contains a newline is silently truncated(!) at the newline.

           For example, <b>--word-diff-regex=.</b>  will treat each character as a word and, correspondingly, show
           differences character by character.

           The regex can also be set via a diff driver or configuration option, see <b><a href="../man5/gitattributes.5.html">gitattributes</a></b>(5) or <b><a href="../man1/gitconfig.1.html">git-</a></b>
           <b><a href="../man1/gitconfig.1.html">config</a></b>(1). Giving it explicitly overrides any diff driver or configuration setting. Diff drivers
           override configuration settings.

       <b>--color-words</b>[<b>=</b><u>&lt;regex&gt;</u>]
           Equivalent to <b>--word-diff=color</b> plus (if a regex was specified) <b>--word-diff-regex=</b><u>&lt;regex&gt;</u>.

       <b>--no-renames</b>
           Turn off rename detection, even when the configuration file gives the default to do so.

       <b>--</b>[<b>no-</b>]<b>rename-empty</b>
           Whether to use empty blobs as rename source.

       <b>--check</b>
           Warn if changes introduce conflict markers or whitespace errors. What are considered whitespace
           errors is controlled by <b>core.whitespace</b> configuration. By default, trailing whitespaces (including
           lines that consist solely of whitespaces) and a space character that is immediately followed by a tab
           character inside the initial indent of the line are considered whitespace errors. Exits with non-zero
           status if problems are found. Not compatible with <b>--exit-code</b>.

       <b>--ws-error-highlight=</b><u>&lt;kind&gt;</u>
           Highlight whitespace errors in the <b>context</b>, <b>old</b> or <b>new</b> lines of the diff. Multiple values are
           separated by comma, <b>none</b> resets previous values, <b>default</b> reset the list to <b>new</b> and <b>all</b> is a shorthand
           for <b>old,new,context</b>. When this option is not given, and the configuration variable
           <b>diff.wsErrorHighlight</b> is not set, only whitespace errors in <b>new</b> lines are highlighted. The whitespace
           errors are colored with <b>color.diff.whitespace</b>.

       <b>--full-index</b>
           Instead of the first handful of characters, show the full pre- and post-image blob object names on
           the "index" line when generating patch format output.

       <b>--binary</b>
           In addition to <b>--full-index</b>, output a binary diff that can be applied with <b>git-apply</b>. Implies
           <b>--patch</b>.

       <b>--abbrev</b>[<b>=</b><u>&lt;n&gt;</u>]
           Instead of showing the full 40-byte hexadecimal object name in diff-raw format output and diff-tree
           header lines, show the shortest prefix that is at least <u>&lt;n&gt;</u> hexdigits long that uniquely refers the
           object. In diff-patch output format, <b>--full-index</b> takes higher precedence, i.e. if <b>--full-index</b> is
           specified, full blob names will be shown regardless of <b>--abbrev</b>. Non default number of digits can be
           specified with <b>--abbrev=</b><u>&lt;n&gt;</u>.

       <b>-B</b>[<u>&lt;n&gt;</u>][<b>/</b><u>&lt;m&gt;</u>], <b>--break-rewrites</b>[<b>=</b>[<u>&lt;n&gt;</u>][<b>/</b><u>&lt;m&gt;</u>]]
           Break complete rewrite changes into pairs of delete and create. This serves two purposes:

           It affects the way a change that amounts to a total rewrite of a file not as a series of deletion and
           insertion mixed together with a very few lines that happen to match textually as the context, but as
           a single deletion of everything old followed by a single insertion of everything new, and the number
           <u>&lt;m&gt;</u> controls this aspect of the <b>-B</b> option (defaults to 60%).  <b>-B/70</b>% specifies that less than 30% of
           the original should remain in the result for Git to consider it a total rewrite (i.e. otherwise the
           resulting patch will be a series of deletion and insertion mixed together with context lines).

           When used with <b>-M</b>, a totally-rewritten file is also considered as the source of a rename (usually <b>-M</b>
           only considers a file that disappeared as the source of a rename), and the number <u>&lt;n&gt;</u> controls this
           aspect of the <b>-B</b> option (defaults to 50%).  <b>-B20</b>% specifies that a change with addition and deletion
           compared to 20% or more of the file’s size are eligible for being picked up as a possible source of a
           rename to another file.

       <b>-M</b>[<u>&lt;n&gt;</u>], <b>--find-renames</b>[<b>=</b><u>&lt;n&gt;</u>]
           If generating diffs, detect and report renames for each commit. For following files across renames
           while traversing history, see <b>--follow</b>. If <u>&lt;n&gt;</u> is specified, it is a threshold on the similarity
           index (i.e. amount of addition/deletions compared to the file’s size). For example, <b>-M90</b>% means Git
           should consider a delete/add pair to be a rename if more than 90% of the file hasn’t changed. Without
           a % sign, the number is to be read as a fraction, with a decimal point before it. I.e., <b>-M5</b> becomes
           0.5, and is thus the same as <b>-M50</b>%. Similarly, <b>-M05</b> is the same as <b>-M5</b>%. To limit detection to exact
           renames, use <b>-M100</b>%. The default similarity index is 50%.

       <b>-C</b>[<u>&lt;n&gt;</u>], <b>--find-copies</b>[<b>=</b><u>&lt;n&gt;</u>]
           Detect copies as well as renames. See also <b>--find-copies-harder</b>. If <u>&lt;n&gt;</u> is specified, it has the same
           meaning as for <b>-M</b><u>&lt;n&gt;</u>.

       <b>--find-copies-harder</b>
           For performance reasons, by default, <b>-C</b> option finds copies only if the original file of the copy was
           modified in the same changeset. This flag makes the command inspect unmodified files as candidates
           for the source of copy. This is a very expensive operation for large projects, so use it with
           caution. Giving more than one <b>-C</b> option has the same effect.

       <b>-D</b>, <b>--irreversible-delete</b>
           Omit the preimage for deletes, i.e. print only the header but not the diff between the preimage and
           <b>/dev/null</b>. The resulting patch is not meant to be applied with <b>patch</b> or <b>git</b> <b>apply</b>; this is solely for
           people who want to just concentrate on reviewing the text after the change. In addition, the output
           obviously lacks enough information to apply such a patch in reverse, even manually, hence the name of
           the option.

           When used together with <b>-B</b>, omit also the preimage in the deletion part of a delete/create pair.

       <b>-l</b><u>&lt;num&gt;</u>
           The <b>-M</b> and <b>-C</b> options involve some preliminary steps that can detect subsets of renames/copies
           cheaply, followed by an exhaustive fallback portion that compares all remaining unpaired destinations
           to all relevant sources. (For renames, only remaining unpaired sources are relevant; for copies, all
           original sources are relevant.) For N sources and destinations, this exhaustive check is O(N^2). This
           option prevents the exhaustive portion of rename/copy detection from running if the number of
           source/destination files involved exceeds the specified number. Defaults to <b>diff.renameLimit</b>. Note
           that a value of 0 is treated as unlimited.

       <b>--diff-filter=</b>[(<b>A</b>|<b>C</b>|<b>D</b>|<b>M</b>|<b>R</b>|<b>T</b>|<b>U</b>|<b>X</b>|<b>B</b>)<b>...</b>[*]]
           Select only files that are Added (<b>A</b>), Copied (<b>C</b>), Deleted (<b>D</b>), Modified (<b>M</b>), Renamed (<b>R</b>), have their
           type (i.e. regular file, symlink, submodule, ...) changed (<b>T</b>), are Unmerged (<b>U</b>), are Unknown (<b>X</b>), or
           have had their pairing Broken (<b>B</b>). Any combination of the filter characters (including none) can be
           used. When * (All-or-none) is added to the combination, all paths are selected if there is any file
           that matches other criteria in the comparison; if there is no file that matches other criteria,
           nothing is selected.

           Also, these upper-case letters can be downcased to exclude. E.g.  <b>--diff-filter=ad</b> excludes added and
           deleted paths.

           Note that not all diffs can feature all types. For instance, copied and renamed entries cannot appear
           if detection for those types is disabled.

       <b>-S</b><u>&lt;string&gt;</u>
           Look for differences that change the number of occurrences of the specified <u>&lt;string&gt;</u> (i.e.
           addition/deletion) in a file. Intended for the scripter’s use.

           It is useful when you’re looking for an exact block of code (like a struct), and want to know the
           history of that block since it first came into being: use the feature iteratively to feed the
           interesting block in the preimage back into <b>-S</b>, and keep going until you get the very first version
           of the block.

           Binary files are searched as well.

       <b>-G</b><u>&lt;regex&gt;</u>
           Look for differences whose patch text contains added/removed lines that match <u>&lt;regex&gt;</u>.

           To illustrate the difference between <b>-S</b><u>&lt;regex&gt;</u> <b>--pickaxe-regex</b> and <b>-G</b><u>&lt;regex&gt;</u>, consider a commit with
           the following diff in the same file:

               +    return frotz(nitfol, two-&gt;ptr, 1, 0);
               ...
               -    hit = frotz(nitfol, mf2.ptr, 1, 0);

           While <b>git</b> <b>log</b> <b>-G</b>"frotz\(<b>nitfol</b>" will show this commit, <b>git</b> <b>log</b> <b>-S</b>"frotz\(<b>nitfol</b>" <b>--pickaxe-regex</b> will
           not (because the number of occurrences of that string did not change).

           Unless <b>--text</b> is supplied patches of binary files without a textconv filter will be ignored.

           See the <u>pickaxe</u> entry in <b><a href="../man7/gitdiffcore.7.html">gitdiffcore</a></b>(7) for more information.

       <b>--find-object=</b><u>&lt;object-id&gt;</u>
           Look for differences that change the number of occurrences of the specified object. Similar to <b>-S</b>,
           just the argument is different in that it doesn’t search for a specific string but for a specific
           object id.

           The object can be a blob or a submodule commit. It implies the <b>-t</b> option in <b>git-log</b> to also find
           trees.

       <b>--pickaxe-all</b>
           When <b>-S</b> or <b>-G</b> finds a change, show all the changes in that changeset, not just the files that contain
           the change in <u>&lt;string&gt;</u>.

       <b>--pickaxe-regex</b>
           Treat the <u>&lt;string&gt;</u> given to <b>-S</b> as an extended POSIX regular expression to match.

       <b>-O</b><u>&lt;orderfile&gt;</u>
           Control the order in which files appear in the output. This overrides the <b>diff.orderFile</b>
           configuration variable (see <b><a href="../man1/git-config.1.html">git-config</a></b>(1)). To cancel <b>diff.orderFile</b>, use <b>-O/dev/null</b>.

           The output order is determined by the order of glob patterns in <u>&lt;orderfile&gt;</u>. All files with pathnames
           that match the first pattern are output first, all files with pathnames that match the second pattern
           (but not the first) are output next, and so on. All files with pathnames that do not match any
           pattern are output last, as if there was an implicit match-all pattern at the end of the file. If
           multiple pathnames have the same rank (they match the same pattern but no earlier patterns), their
           output order relative to each other is the normal order.

           <u>&lt;orderfile&gt;</u> is parsed as follows:

           •   Blank lines are ignored, so they can be used as separators for readability.

           •   Lines starting with a hash ("#") are ignored, so they can be used for comments. Add a backslash
               ("\") to the beginning of the pattern if it starts with a hash.

           •   Each other line contains a single pattern.

           Patterns have the same syntax and semantics as patterns used for <b><a href="../man3/fnmatch.3.html">fnmatch</a></b>(3) without the <b>FNM_PATHNAME</b>
           flag, except a pathname also matches a pattern if removing any number of the final pathname
           components matches the pattern. For example, the pattern "<b>foo</b>*bar" matches "<b>fooasdfbar</b>" and
           "<b>foo/bar/baz/asdf</b>" but not "<b>foobarx</b>".

       <b>--skip-to=</b><u>&lt;file&gt;</u>, <b>--rotate-to=</b><u>&lt;file&gt;</u>
           Discard the files before the named <u>&lt;file&gt;</u> from the output (i.e.  <u>skip</u> <u>to</u>), or move them to the end of
           the output (i.e.  <u>rotate</u> <u>to</u>). These options were invented primarily for the use of the <b>git</b> <b>difftool</b>
           command, and may not be very useful otherwise.

       <b>-R</b>
           Swap two inputs; that is, show differences from index or on-disk file to tree contents.

       <b>--relative</b>[<b>=</b><u>&lt;path&gt;</u>], <b>--no-relative</b>
           When run from a subdirectory of the project, it can be told to exclude changes outside the directory
           and show pathnames relative to it with this option. When you are not in a subdirectory (e.g. in a
           bare repository), you can name which subdirectory to make the output relative to by giving a <u>&lt;path&gt;</u>
           as an argument.  <b>--no-relative</b> can be used to countermand both <b>diff.relative</b> config option and
           previous <b>--relative</b>.

       <b>-a</b>, <b>--text</b>
           Treat all files as text.

       <b>--ignore-cr-at-eol</b>
           Ignore carriage-return at the end of line when doing a comparison.

       <b>--ignore-space-at-eol</b>
           Ignore changes in whitespace at EOL.

       <b>-b</b>, <b>--ignore-space-change</b>
           Ignore changes in amount of whitespace. This ignores whitespace at line end, and considers all other
           sequences of one or more whitespace characters to be equivalent.

       <b>-w</b>, <b>--ignore-all-space</b>
           Ignore whitespace when comparing lines. This ignores differences even if one line has whitespace
           where the other line has none.

       <b>--ignore-blank-lines</b>
           Ignore changes whose lines are all blank.

       <b>-I</b><u>&lt;regex&gt;</u>, <b>--ignore-matching-lines=</b><u>&lt;regex&gt;</u>
           Ignore changes whose all lines match <u>&lt;regex&gt;</u>. This option may be specified more than once.

       <b>--inter-hunk-context=</b><u>&lt;number&gt;</u>
           Show the context between diff hunks, up to the specified <u>&lt;number&gt;</u> of lines, thereby fusing hunks that
           are close to each other. Defaults to <b>diff.interHunkContext</b> or 0 if the config option is unset.

       <b>-W</b>, <b>--function-context</b>
           Show whole function as context lines for each change. The function names are determined in the same
           way as <b>git</b> <b>diff</b> works out patch hunk headers (see "Defining a custom hunk-header" in
           <b><a href="../man5/gitattributes.5.html">gitattributes</a></b>(5)).

       <b>--ext-diff</b>
           Allow an external diff helper to be executed. If you set an external diff driver with
           <b><a href="../man5/gitattributes.5.html">gitattributes</a></b>(5), you need to use this option with <b><a href="../man1/git-log.1.html">git-log</a></b>(1) and friends.

       <b>--no-ext-diff</b>
           Disallow external diff drivers.

       <b>--textconv</b>, <b>--no-textconv</b>
           Allow (or disallow) external text conversion filters to be run when comparing binary files. See
           <b><a href="../man5/gitattributes.5.html">gitattributes</a></b>(5) for details. Because textconv filters are typically a one-way conversion, the
           resulting diff is suitable for human consumption, but cannot be applied. For this reason, textconv
           filters are enabled by default only for <b><a href="../man1/git-diff.1.html">git-diff</a></b>(1) and <b><a href="../man1/git-log.1.html">git-log</a></b>(1), but not for <b><a href="../man1/git-format-patch.1.html">git-format-patch</a></b>(1)
           or diff plumbing commands.

       <b>--ignore-submodules</b>[<b>=</b>(<b>none</b>|<b>untracked</b>|<b>dirty</b>|<b>all</b>)]
           Ignore changes to submodules in the diff generation.  <b>all</b> is the default. Using <b>none</b> will consider
           the submodule modified when it either contains untracked or modified files or its <b>HEAD</b> differs from
           the commit recorded in the superproject and can be used to override any settings of the <b>ignore</b> option
           in <b><a href="../man1/git-config.1.html">git-config</a></b>(1) or <b><a href="../man5/gitmodules.5.html">gitmodules</a></b>(5). When <b>untracked</b> is used submodules are not considered dirty when
           they only contain untracked content (but they are still scanned for modified content). Using <b>dirty</b>
           ignores all changes to the work tree of submodules, only changes to the commits stored in the
           superproject are shown (this was the behavior until 1.7.0). Using <b>all</b> hides all changes to
           submodules.

       <b>--src-prefix=</b><u>&lt;prefix&gt;</u>
           Show the given source <u>&lt;prefix&gt;</u> instead of "a/".

       <b>--dst-prefix=</b><u>&lt;prefix&gt;</u>
           Show the given destination <u>&lt;prefix&gt;</u> instead of "b/".

       <b>--no-prefix</b>
           Do not show any source or destination prefix.

       <b>--default-prefix</b>
           Use the default source and destination prefixes ("a/" and "b/"). This overrides configuration
           variables such as <b>diff.noprefix</b>, <b>diff.srcPrefix</b>, <b>diff.dstPrefix</b>, and <b>diff.mnemonicPrefix</b> (see <b><a href="../man1/gitconfig.1.html">git-</a></b>
           <b><a href="../man1/gitconfig.1.html">config</a></b>(1)).

       <b>--line-prefix=</b><u>&lt;prefix&gt;</u>
           Prepend an additional <u>&lt;prefix&gt;</u> to every line of output.

       <b>--ita-invisible-in-index</b>
           By default entries added by <b>git</b> <b>add</b> <b>-N</b> appear as an existing empty file in <b>git</b> <b>diff</b> and a new file in
           <b>git</b> <b>diff</b> <b>--cached</b>. This option makes the entry appear as a new file in <b>git</b> <b>diff</b> and non-existent in
           <b>git</b> <b>diff</b> <b>--cached</b>. This option could be reverted with <b>--ita-visible-in-index</b>. Both options are
           experimental and could be removed in future.

       For more detailed explanation on these common options, see also <b><a href="../man7/gitdiffcore.7.html">gitdiffcore</a></b>(7).

</pre><h4><b>GENERATING</b> <b>PATCH</b> <b>TEXT</b> <b>WITH</b> <b>-P</b></h4><pre>
       Running <b><a href="../man1/git-diff.1.html">git-diff</a></b>(1), <b><a href="../man1/git-log.1.html">git-log</a></b>(1), <b><a href="../man1/git-show.1.html">git-show</a></b>(1), <b><a href="../man1/git-diff-index.1.html">git-diff-index</a></b>(1), <b><a href="../man1/git-diff-tree.1.html">git-diff-tree</a></b>(1), or <b><a href="../man1/git-diff-files.1.html">git-diff-files</a></b>(1)
       with the <b>-p</b> option produces patch text. You can customize the creation of patch text via the
       <b>GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF</b> and the <b>GIT_DIFF_OPTS</b> environment variables (see <b><a href="../man1/git.1.html">git</a></b>(1)), and the <b>diff</b> attribute (see
       <b><a href="../man5/gitattributes.5.html">gitattributes</a></b>(5)).

       What the <b>-p</b> option produces is slightly different from the traditional diff format:

        1. It is preceded by a "git diff" header that looks like this:

               diff --git a/file1 b/file2

           The <b>a/</b> and <b>b/</b> filenames are the same unless rename/copy is involved. Especially, even for a creation
           or a deletion, <b>/dev/null</b> is <u>not</u> used in place of the <b>a/</b> or <b>b/</b> filenames.

           When a rename/copy is involved, <b>file1</b> and <b>file2</b> show the name of the source file of the rename/copy
           and the name of the file that the rename/copy produces, respectively.

        2. It is followed by one or more extended header lines:

               <b>old</b> <b>mode</b> <u>&lt;mode&gt;</u>
               <b>new</b> <b>mode</b> <u>&lt;mode&gt;</u>
               <b>deleted</b> <b>file</b> <b>mode</b> <u>&lt;mode&gt;</u>
               <b>new</b> <b>file</b> <b>mode</b> <u>&lt;mode&gt;</u>
               <b>copy</b> <b>from</b> <u>&lt;path&gt;</u>
               <b>copy</b> <b>to</b> <u>&lt;path&gt;</u>
               <b>rename</b> <b>from</b> <u>&lt;path&gt;</u>
               <b>rename</b> <b>to</b> <u>&lt;path&gt;</u>
               <b>similarity</b> <b>index</b> <u>&lt;number&gt;</u>
               <b>dissimilarity</b> <b>index</b> <u>&lt;number&gt;</u>
               <b>index</b> <u>&lt;hash&gt;</u><b>..</b><u>&lt;hash&gt;</u> <u>&lt;mode&gt;</u>

           File modes <u>&lt;mode&gt;</u> are printed as 6-digit octal numbers including the file type and file permission
           bits.

           Path names in extended headers do not include the <b>a/</b> and <b>b/</b> prefixes.

           The similarity index is the percentage of unchanged lines, and the dissimilarity index is the
           percentage of changed lines. It is a rounded down integer, followed by a percent sign. The similarity
           index value of 100% is thus reserved for two equal files, while 100% dissimilarity means that no line
           from the old file made it into the new one.

           The index line includes the blob object names before and after the change. The <u>&lt;mode&gt;</u> is included if
           the file mode does not change; otherwise, separate lines indicate the old and the new mode.

        3. Pathnames with "unusual" characters are quoted as explained for the configuration variable
           <b>core.quotePath</b> (see <b><a href="../man1/git-config.1.html">git-config</a></b>(1)).

        4. All the <b>file1</b> files in the output refer to files before the commit, and all the <b>file2</b> files refer to
           files after the commit. It is incorrect to apply each change to each file sequentially. For example,
           this patch will swap a and b:

               diff --git a/a b/b
               rename from a
               rename to b
               diff --git a/b b/a
               rename from b
               rename to a

        5. Hunk headers mention the name of the function to which the hunk applies. See "Defining a custom
           hunk-header" in <b><a href="../man5/gitattributes.5.html">gitattributes</a></b>(5) for details of how to tailor this to specific languages.

</pre><h4><b>COMBINED</b> <b>DIFF</b> <b>FORMAT</b></h4><pre>
       Any diff-generating command can take the <b>-c</b> or <b>--cc</b> option to produce a <u>combined</u> <u>diff</u> when showing a
       merge. This is the default format when showing merges with <b><a href="../man1/git-diff.1.html">git-diff</a></b>(1) or <b><a href="../man1/git-show.1.html">git-show</a></b>(1). Note also that you
       can give suitable <b>--diff-merges</b> option to any of these commands to force generation of diffs in a
       specific format.

       A "combined diff" format looks like this:

           diff --combined describe.c
           index fabadb8,cc95eb0..4866510
           --- a/describe.c
           +++ b/describe.c
           @@@ -98,20 -98,12 +98,20 @@@
                   return (a_date &gt; b_date) ? -1 : (a_date == b_date) ? 0 : 1;
             }

           - static void describe(char *arg)
            -static void describe(struct commit *cmit, int last_one)
           ++static void describe(char *arg, int last_one)
             {
            +      unsigned char sha1[20];
            +      struct commit *cmit;
                   struct commit_list *list;
                   static int initialized = 0;
                   struct commit_name *n;

            +      if (get_sha1(arg, sha1) &lt; 0)
            +              usage(describe_usage);
            +      cmit = lookup_commit_reference(sha1);
            +      if (!cmit)
            +              usage(describe_usage);
            +
                   if (!initialized) {
                           initialized = 1;
                           for_each_ref(get_name);

        1. It is preceded by a "git diff" header, that looks like this (when the <b>-c</b> option is used):

               diff --combined file

           or like this (when the <b>--cc</b> option is used):

               diff --cc file

        2. It is followed by one or more extended header lines (this example shows a merge with two parents):

               <b>index</b> <u>&lt;hash&gt;</u><b>,</b><u>&lt;hash&gt;</u><b>..</b><u>&lt;hash&gt;</u>
               <b>mode</b> <u>&lt;mode&gt;</u><b>,</b><u>&lt;mode&gt;</u><b>..</b><u>&lt;mode&gt;</u>
               <b>new</b> <b>file</b> <b>mode</b> <u>&lt;mode&gt;</u>
               <b>deleted</b> <b>file</b> <b>mode</b> <u>&lt;mode&gt;</u><b>,</b><u>&lt;mode&gt;</u>

           The <b>mode</b> <u>&lt;mode&gt;</u><b>,</b><u>&lt;mode&gt;</u><b>..</b><u>&lt;mode&gt;</u> line appears only if at least one of the &lt;mode&gt; is different from the
           rest. Extended headers with information about detected content movement (renames and copying
           detection) are designed to work with the diff of two <u>&lt;tree-ish&gt;</u> and are not used by combined diff
           format.

        3. It is followed by a two-line from-file/to-file header:

               --- a/file
               +++ b/file

           Similar to the two-line header for the traditional <u>unified</u> diff format, <b>/dev/null</b> is used to signal
           created or deleted files.

           However, if the --combined-all-paths option is provided, instead of a two-line from-file/to-file, you
           get an N+1 line from-file/to-file header, where N is the number of parents in the merge commit:

               --- a/file
               --- a/file
               --- a/file
               +++ b/file

           This extended format can be useful if rename or copy detection is active, to allow you to see the
           original name of the file in different parents.

        4. Chunk header format is modified to prevent people from accidentally feeding it to <b>patch</b> <b>-p1</b>. Combined
           diff format was created for review of merge commit changes, and was not meant to be applied. The
           change is similar to the change in the extended <u>index</u> header:

               @@@ &lt;from-file-range&gt; &lt;from-file-range&gt; &lt;to-file-range&gt; @@@

           There are (number of parents + 1) <b>@</b> characters in the chunk header for combined diff format.

       Unlike the traditional <u>unified</u> diff format, which shows two files A and B with a single column that has <b>-</b>
       (minus — appears in A but removed in B), <b>+</b> (plus — missing in A but added to B), or " " (space —
       unchanged) prefix, this format compares two or more files file1, file2,... with one file X, and shows how
       X differs from each of fileN. One column for each of fileN is prepended to the output line to note how
       X’s line is different from it.

       A <b>-</b> character in the column N means that the line appears in fileN but it does not appear in the result.
       A <b>+</b> character in the column N means that the line appears in the result, and fileN does not have that
       line (in other words, the line was added, from the point of view of that parent).

       In the above example output, the function signature was changed from both files (hence two <b>-</b> removals
       from both file1 and file2, plus <b>++</b> to mean one line that was added does not appear in either file1 or
       file2). Also, eight other lines are the same from file1 but do not appear in file2 (hence prefixed with
       <b>+</b>).

       When shown by <b>git</b> <b>diff-tree</b> <b>-c</b>, it compares the parents of a merge commit with the merge result (i.e.
       file1..fileN are the parents). When shown by <b>git</b> <b>diff-files</b> <b>-c</b>, it compares the two unresolved merge
       parents with the working tree file (i.e. file1 is stage 2 aka "our version", file2 is stage 3 aka "their
       version").

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>git</b> <b>log</b> <b>--no-merges</b>
           Show the whole commit history, but skip any merges

       <b>git</b> <b>log</b> <b>v2.6.12..</b> <b>include/scsi</b> <b>drivers/scsi</b>
           Show all commits since version <u>v2.6.12</u> that changed any file in the <b>include/scsi</b> or <b>drivers/scsi</b>
           subdirectories

       <b>git</b> <b>log</b> <b>--since=</b>"2 <b>weeks</b> <b>ago</b>" <b>--</b> <b>gitk</b>
           Show the changes during the last two weeks to the file <u>gitk</u>. The <b>--</b> is necessary to avoid confusion
           with the <b>branch</b> named <u>gitk</u>

       <b>git</b> <b>log</b> <b>--name-status</b> <b>release..test</b>
           Show the commits that are in the "test" branch but not yet in the "release" branch, along with the
           list of paths each commit modifies.

       <b>git</b> <b>log</b> <b>--follow</b> <b>builtin/rev-list.c</b>
           Shows the commits that changed <b>builtin/rev-list.c</b>, including those commits that occurred before the
           file was given its present name.

       <b>git</b> <b>log</b> <b>--branches</b> <b>--not</b> <b>--remotes=origin</b>
           Shows all commits that are in any of local branches but not in any of remote-tracking branches for
           <u>origin</u> (what you have that origin doesn’t).

       <b>git</b> <b>log</b> <b>master</b> <b>--not</b> <b>--remotes=</b>*/master
           Shows all commits that are in local master but not in any remote repository master branches.

       <b>git</b> <b>log</b> <b>-p</b> <b>-m</b> <b>--first-parent</b>
           Shows the history including change diffs, but only from the “main branch” perspective, skipping
           commits that come from merged branches, and showing full diffs of changes introduced by the merges.
           This makes sense only when following a strict policy of merging all topic branches when staying on a
           single integration branch.

       <b>git</b> <b>log</b> <b>-L</b> '/int <b>main/</b>',/^}/:main.c
           Shows how the function <b>main</b>() in the file <b>main.c</b> evolved over time.

       <b>git</b> <b>log</b> <b>-3</b>
           Limits the number of commits to show to 3.

</pre><h4><b>DISCUSSION</b></h4><pre>
       Git is to some extent character encoding agnostic.

       •   The contents of the blob objects are uninterpreted sequences of bytes. There is no encoding
           translation at the core level.

       •   Path names are encoded in UTF-8 normalization form C. This applies to tree objects, the index file,
           ref names, as well as path names in command line arguments, environment variables and config files
           (<b>.git/config</b> (see <b><a href="../man1/git-config.1.html">git-config</a></b>(1)), <b><a href="../man5/gitignore.5.html">gitignore</a></b>(5), <b><a href="../man5/gitattributes.5.html">gitattributes</a></b>(5) and <b><a href="../man5/gitmodules.5.html">gitmodules</a></b>(5)).

           Note that Git at the core level treats path names simply as sequences of non-NUL bytes, there are no
           path name encoding conversions (except on Mac and Windows). Therefore, using non-ASCII path names
           will mostly work even on platforms and file systems that use legacy extended ASCII encodings.
           However, repositories created on such systems will not work properly on UTF-8-based systems (e.g.
           Linux, Mac, Windows) and vice versa. Additionally, many Git-based tools simply assume path names to
           be UTF-8 and will fail to display other encodings correctly.

       •   Commit log messages are typically encoded in UTF-8, but other extended ASCII encodings are also
           supported. This includes ISO-8859-x, CP125x and many others, but <u>not</u> UTF-16/32, EBCDIC and CJK
           multi-byte encodings (GBK, Shift-JIS, Big5, EUC-x, CP9xx etc.).

       Although we encourage that the commit log messages are encoded in UTF-8, both the core and Git Porcelain
       are designed not to force UTF-8 on projects. If all participants of a particular project find it more
       convenient to use legacy encodings, Git does not forbid it. However, there are a few things to keep in
       mind.

        1. <u>git</u> <u>commit</u> and <u>git</u> <u>commit-tree</u> issue a warning if the commit log message given to it does not look
           like a valid UTF-8 string, unless you explicitly say your project uses a legacy encoding. The way to
           say this is to have <b>i18n.commitEncoding</b> in <b>.git/config</b> file, like this:

               [i18n]
                       commitEncoding = ISO-8859-1

           Commit objects created with the above setting record the value of <b>i18n.commitEncoding</b> in their
           <b>encoding</b> header. This is to help other people who look at them later. Lack of this header implies
           that the commit log message is encoded in UTF-8.

        2. <u>git</u> <u>log</u>, <u>git</u> <u>show</u>, <u>git</u> <u>blame</u> and friends look at the <b>encoding</b> header of a commit object, and try to
           re-code the log message into UTF-8 unless otherwise specified. You can specify the desired output
           encoding with <b>i18n.logOutputEncoding</b> in <b>.git/config</b> file, like this:

               [i18n]
                       logOutputEncoding = ISO-8859-1

           If you do not have this configuration variable, the value of <b>i18n.commitEncoding</b> is used instead.

       Note that we deliberately chose not to re-code the commit log message when a commit is made to force
       UTF-8 at the commit object level, because re-coding to UTF-8 is not necessarily a reversible operation.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       See <b><a href="../man1/git-config.1.html">git-config</a></b>(1) for core variables and <b><a href="../man1/git-diff.1.html">git-diff</a></b>(1) for settings related to diff generation.

       format.pretty
           Default for the <b>--format</b> option. (See <u>Pretty</u> <u>Formats</u> above.) Defaults to <b>medium</b>.

       i18n.logOutputEncoding
           Encoding to use when displaying logs. (See <u>Discussion</u> above.) Defaults to the value of
           <b>i18n.commitEncoding</b> if set, and UTF-8 otherwise.

       Everything above this line in this section isn’t included from the <b><a href="../man1/git-config.1.html">git-config</a></b>(1) documentation. The
       content that follows is the same as what’s found there:

       log.abbrevCommit
           If true, makes <b><a href="../man1/git-log.1.html">git-log</a></b>(1), <b><a href="../man1/git-show.1.html">git-show</a></b>(1), and <b><a href="../man1/git-whatchanged.1.html">git-whatchanged</a></b>(1) assume <b>--abbrev-commit</b>. You may
           override this option with <b>--no-abbrev-commit</b>.

       log.date
           Set the default date-time mode for the <u>log</u> command. Setting a value for log.date is similar to using
           <u>git</u> <u>log</u>'s <b>--date</b> option. See <b><a href="../man1/git-log.1.html">git-log</a></b>(1) for details.

           If the format is set to "auto:foo" and the pager is in use, format "foo" will be used for the date
           format. Otherwise, "default" will be used.

       log.decorate
           Print out the ref names of any commits that are shown by the log command. If <u>short</u> is specified, the
           ref name prefixes <u>refs/heads/</u>, <u>refs/tags/</u> and <u>refs/remotes/</u> will not be printed. If <u>full</u> is
           specified, the full ref name (including prefix) will be printed. If <u>auto</u> is specified, then if the
           output is going to a terminal, the ref names are shown as if <u>short</u> were given, otherwise no ref names
           are shown. This is the same as the <b>--decorate</b> option of the <b>git</b> <b>log</b>.

       log.initialDecorationSet
           By default, <b>git</b> <b>log</b> only shows decorations for certain known ref namespaces. If <u>all</u> is specified,
           then show all refs as decorations.

       log.excludeDecoration
           Exclude the specified patterns from the log decorations. This is similar to the
           <b>--decorate-refs-exclude</b> command-line option, but the config option can be overridden by the
           <b>--decorate-refs</b> option.

       log.diffMerges
           Set diff format to be used when <b>--diff-merges=on</b> is specified, see <b>--diff-merges</b> in <b><a href="../man1/git-log.1.html">git-log</a></b>(1) for
           details. Defaults to <b>separate</b>.

       log.follow
           If <b>true</b>, <b>git</b> <b>log</b> will act as if the <b>--follow</b> option was used when a single &lt;path&gt; is given. This has
           the same limitations as <b>--follow</b>, i.e. it cannot be used to follow multiple files and does not work
           well on non-linear history.

       log.graphColors
           A list of colors, separated by commas, that can be used to draw history lines in <b>git</b> <b>log</b> <b>--graph</b>.

       log.showRoot
           If true, the initial commit will be shown as a big creation event. This is equivalent to a diff
           against an empty tree. Tools like <b><a href="../man1/git-log.1.html">git-log</a></b>(1) or <b><a href="../man1/git-whatchanged.1.html">git-whatchanged</a></b>(1), which normally hide the root
           commit will now show it. True by default.

       log.showSignature
           If true, makes <b><a href="../man1/git-log.1.html">git-log</a></b>(1), <b><a href="../man1/git-show.1.html">git-show</a></b>(1), and <b><a href="../man1/git-whatchanged.1.html">git-whatchanged</a></b>(1) assume <b>--show-signature</b>.

       log.mailmap
           If true, makes <b><a href="../man1/git-log.1.html">git-log</a></b>(1), <b><a href="../man1/git-show.1.html">git-show</a></b>(1), and <b><a href="../man1/git-whatchanged.1.html">git-whatchanged</a></b>(1) assume <b>--use-mailmap</b>, otherwise assume
           <b>--no-use-mailmap</b>. True by default.

       notes.mergeStrategy
           Which merge strategy to choose by default when resolving notes conflicts. Must be one of <b>manual</b>,
           <b>ours</b>, <b>theirs</b>, <b>union</b>, or <b>cat_sort_uniq</b>. Defaults to <b>manual</b>. See the "NOTES MERGE STRATEGIES" section
           of <b><a href="../man1/git-notes.1.html">git-notes</a></b>(1) for more information on each strategy.

           This setting can be overridden by passing the <b>--strategy</b> option to <b><a href="../man1/git-notes.1.html">git-notes</a></b>(1).

       notes.&lt;name&gt;.mergeStrategy
           Which merge strategy to choose when doing a notes merge into refs/notes/&lt;name&gt;. This overrides the
           more general "notes.mergeStrategy". See the "NOTES MERGE STRATEGIES" section in <b><a href="../man1/git-notes.1.html">git-notes</a></b>(1) for more
           information on the available strategies.

       notes.displayRef
           Which ref (or refs, if a glob or specified more than once), in addition to the default set by
           <b>core.notesRef</b> or <b>GIT_NOTES_REF</b>, to read notes from when showing commit messages with the <u>git</u> <u>log</u>
           family of commands.

           This setting can be overridden with the <b>GIT_NOTES_DISPLAY_REF</b> environment variable, which must be a
           colon separated list of refs or globs.

           A warning will be issued for refs that do not exist, but a glob that does not match any refs is
           silently ignored.

           This setting can be disabled by the <b>--no-notes</b> option to the <u>git</u> <u>log</u> family of commands, or by the
           <b>--notes=</b><u>&lt;ref&gt;</u> option accepted by those commands.

           The effective value of "core.notesRef" (possibly overridden by GIT_NOTES_REF) is also implicitly
           added to the list of refs to be displayed.

       notes.rewrite.&lt;command&gt;
           When rewriting commits with &lt;command&gt; (currently <b>amend</b> or <b>rebase</b>), if this variable is <b>false</b>, git
           will not copy notes from the original to the rewritten commit. Defaults to <b>true</b>. See also
           "<b>notes.rewriteRef</b>" below.

           This setting can be overridden with the <b>GIT_NOTES_REWRITE_REF</b> environment variable, which must be a
           colon separated list of refs or globs.

       notes.rewriteMode
           When copying notes during a rewrite (see the "notes.rewrite.&lt;command&gt;" option), determines what to do
           if the target commit already has a note. Must be one of <b>overwrite</b>, <b>concatenate</b>, <b>cat_sort_uniq</b>, or
           <b>ignore</b>. Defaults to <b>concatenate</b>.

           This setting can be overridden with the <b>GIT_NOTES_REWRITE_MODE</b> environment variable.

       notes.rewriteRef
           When copying notes during a rewrite, specifies the (fully qualified) ref whose notes should be
           copied. May be a glob, in which case notes in all matching refs will be copied. You may also specify
           this configuration several times.

           Does not have a default value; you must configure this variable to enable note rewriting. Set it to
           <b>refs/notes/commits</b> to enable rewriting for the default commit notes.

           Can be overridden with the <b>GIT_NOTES_REWRITE_REF</b> environment variable. See <b>notes.rewrite.</b><u>&lt;command&gt;</u>
           above for a further description of its format.
