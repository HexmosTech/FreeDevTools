       VIBes-viewer - Visualizer for Intervals and Boxes

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>VIBes-viewer</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This manual page documents briefly the <b>VIBes-viewer</b> command.

       This  manual  page  was  written for the Debian distribution because the original program does not have a
       manual page.  Instead, it has documentation in the GNU <a href="../man1/info.1.html">info</a>(1) format; see below.

       VIBes is a visualization system that aims at providing people working with  interval  methods  a  way  to
       display  results  (boxes, pavings), without worrying with GUI programming.  It provides drawing functions
       accessible from a lot of programming languages, without complex installation  and  library  dependencies.
       The  main  design  goal of VIBes is to be cross-platform, available from different programming languages,
       simple to set-up, easy to port to a new language.

       The <b>VIBes-viewer</b> command is the server side of VIBes  and  features  viewing,  annotating  and  exporting
       figures.  The VIBes API enables your program to communicate with the viewer in order to draw figures from
       different programming languages.
