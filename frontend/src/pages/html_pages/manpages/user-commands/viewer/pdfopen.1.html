</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       pdfopen, pdfclose - open or close a PDF file viewer

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>pdfopen</b> [ <u>options</u> ]  [ <b>--file</b> ]  <u>file.pdf</u>
       <b>pdfclose</b> [ <b>--file</b> ]  <u>file.pdf</u>

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-h,</b> <b>--help,</b> <b>-?</b>
               output help and exit.

       <b>-v,</b> <b>--version,</b> <b>-V</b>
               output the version number and exit.

       <b>-p</b> <b>&lt;n&gt;,</b> <b>--page</b> <b>&lt;n&gt;</b>
               when  starting  the viewer, display page &lt;n&gt; of the document (notes: not all viewers support this
               feature, and even in those cases this option only has  effect  when  the  document  is  initially
               loaded).  This option is over-ridden by <b>-g</b>.

       <b>-g</b> <b>&lt;named</b> <b>destination&gt;,</b> <b>--goto</b> <b>&lt;named</b> <b>destination&gt;</b>
               when  starting  the  viewer,  display  the  page of the document containing the named destination
               (notes: not all viewers support this feature, and even in those cases this option only has effect
               when the document is initially loaded).

       <b>-r,</b> <b>--reset_focus</b>
               after sending commands to the PDF viewer, attempt to reset the input focus to  the  window  which
               had focus before the commands were sent.

       <b>-viewer,</b> <b>--viewer</b> <b>&lt;</b><u>ar9</u><b>|</b><u>ar9-tab</u><b>|</b><u>ar8</u><b>|</b><u>ar7</u><b>|</b><u>ar5</u><b>|</b><u>xpdf</u><b>|</b><u>evince</u><b>&gt;</b>
               use  (respectively)  Adobe  Reader 9 (in a new window), Adobe Reader 9 (in a new tab of a running
               AR9, if any), Adobe Reader 8, Adobe Reader 7, Adobe Reader 5, xpdf or evince as  the  PDF  viewer
               program.  Adobe Reader 9 (in a new window) is the default.

</pre><h4><b>RATIONALE</b></h4><pre>
       At certain points of TeX document preparation, many people repeat a "edit-compile-view" cycle.  Since PDF
       viewers such as Adobe's Acrobat Reader ("<b>acroread</b>") do not automatically refresh the display when the PDF
       file  changes,  this cycle can be more cumbersome than desired.  The <b>pdfopen</b> program provides the ability
       to automate the reloading of the PDF document when it is changed.

       Note: there seems to be little need for <b>pdfclose</b> under GNU/Linux, since  (unlike  the  situation  for  MS
       windows) <b>acroread</b> does not lock the PDF file, which would prevent <b>pdftex</b> (or a DVI to PDF converter) from
       creating  a  new  version of the PDF output file.  However, <b>pdfclose</b> is provided in case someone finds it
       useful.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>pdfopen</b> searches for an instance of the specified (or default) PDF viewer displaying  the  specified  PDF
       file.   If  there  is  already  an  instance of the given viewer displaying the given file, the viewer is
       instructed to reload the file.  If no such instance is found,  <b>pdfopen</b>  attempts  to  run  the  specified
       viewer on the specified document.

       The  default  viewer  is "<b>acroread</b>", which could start any one of a number of versions of Acrobat Reader,
       depending on what is installed on your system.  However, the commands to reload the current document vary
       from one version of <b>acroread</b> to another; consequently, if you are using a version of <b>acroread</b> other  than
       AR9, you should explicitly specify the viewer program.

       This version of <b>pdfopen</b> accepts the following viewer options:
       <u>ar9</u>, <u>ar9-tab</u>, <u>ar8</u>, <u>ar7</u>, <u>ar5</u>, <u>xpdf</u>, and <u>evince</u>.
       The difference between <u>ar9</u> and <u>ar9-tab</u> is significant when there is no instance of AR9 already displaying
       the  requested  document.  In this situation, while <u>ar9</u> will request <b>acroread</b> to create a new instance of
       <b>acroread</b> (and thus open a new window) by using the <b>-openInNewInstance</b> argument, <u>ar9-tab</u>  starts  <b>acroread</b>
       without  this  argument; if there is already an instance of <b>acroread</b> running, a new tab will be opened in
       an existing window.

       <b>pdfclose</b> searches for one of the above PDF viewers displaying the given file and instructs the viewer  to
       "close" the window.  In most cases, the PDF viewer continues to run, possibly now displaying just a blank
       window.  (This behaviour varies somewhat from one PDF viewer to another.)

</pre><h4><b>PORTABILITY</b> <b>AND</b> <b>AVAILABILITY</b></h4><pre>
       These  programs  have been tested on Slackware64 Version 14.1 and a few other versions / distributions of
       GNU/Linux.  The code is reasonably generic and  should  work  out  of  the  box  using  most  recent  X11
       implementations.  (Reports to the contrary are welcome, particularly if they come with robust fixes.)

       These  programs  are  designed  for  X11-based  systems.   If you somehow find compiled versions of these
       programs on a system using another window system, they are very unlikely to be of any use to you.

       Source  and  binaries  of  the  programs  can  be   downloaded   from   CTAN://support/xpdfopen/   (e.g.,
       <a href="http://mirror.ctan.org/support/xpdfopen">http://mirror.ctan.org/support/xpdfopen</a>).

</pre><h4><b>CAVEATS</b></h4><pre>
       If  you  use  <u>ar9-tab</u>  to reload the PDF document and the instance of <b>acroread</b> with the given document is
       currently displaying some other document, the command causes your  document  to  be  displayed,  but  not
       reloaded.

       <b>pdfopen</b>  works  by  looking  for a window with a name (window title) matching that expected for the given
       viewer and document.  If for some reason your viewer's window name is not as expected,  <b>pdfopen</b>  may  not
       work for you.

       With  at  least  AR9  and  some  window managers, using <b>pdfopen</b> to reload the document gives focus to the
       <b>acroread</b> window, even though the mouse cursor is not necessarily in that window.  This can  be  annoying.
       The <b>-reset_focus</b> option can be used to deal with this problem.

</pre><h4><b>AUTHOR</b></h4><pre>
       This manual page was written by Jim Diamond &lt;<a href="mailto:Jim.Diamond@acadiau.ca">Jim.Diamond@acadiau.ca</a>&gt;.  I am the current maintainer of the
       X11  versions of <b>pdfopen</b> and <b>pdfclose</b>.  Report any bugs you find to me.  Feature enhancement requests are
       welcome, coded enhancements even more so.

       Past authors: Fabrice Popineau wrote the MS-windows versions of <b>pdfopen</b> and  <b>pdfclose</b>  upon  which  these
       programs  were  originally  based.   Taco  Hoekwater  created  the GNU/Linux versions, up to Version 0.61
       (including some  documentation  which  inspired  parts  of  this  man  page).   Peter  Breitenlohner  has
       contributed both code and suggestions to versions later than 0.61.
