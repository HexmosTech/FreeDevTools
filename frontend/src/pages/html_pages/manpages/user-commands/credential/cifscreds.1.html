</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       cifscreds - manage NTLM credentials in kernel keyring

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
          cifscreds add|clear|clearall|update [-u username] [-d] host|domain [-t timeout]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>cifscreds</b>   program  is  a  tool for managing credentials (username and password) for the purpose of
       establishing sessions in multiuser mounts.

       When a cifs filesystem is mounted with the "multiuser" option, and does not use krb5  authentication,  it
       needs  to  be able to get the credentials for each user from somewhere. The <b>cifscreds</b> program is the tool
       used to provide these credentials to the kernel.

       The first non-option argument to cifscreds is a command (see the COMMANDS   section  below).  The  second
       non-option argument is a hostname or address, or an NT domain name.

</pre><h4><b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>add</b>    Add  credentials  to  the  kernel to be used for connecting to the given server, or servers in the
              given domain.

       <b>clear</b>  Clear credentials for a particular host or domain from the kernel.

       <b>clearall</b>
              Clear all cifs credentials from the kernel.

       <b>update</b> Update stored credentials in the kernel with a new username and password.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-d</b>, <b>--domain</b>
              The provided host/domain argument is a NT domainname.

              Ordinarily the second argument provided to cifscreds is treated as a hostname or IP address.  This
              option causes the cifscreds program to treat that argument as an NT domainname instead.

              If  there are not host specific credentials for the mounted server, then the kernel will next look
              for a set of domain credentials equivalent to the domain= option provided at mount time.

       <b>-u</b>, <b>--username</b>
              Ordinarily, the username is derived from the unix username of the  user  adding  the  credentials.
              This option allows the user to substitute a different username.

       <b>-t</b>, <b>--timeout</b>
              Sets the key timeout in seconds. If not set, will use the system default timeout for logon keys.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       The  cifscreds  utility  requires  a  kernel built with support for the <b>login</b> key type. That key type was
       added in v3.3 in mainline Linux kernels.

       Since <b>cifscreds</b> adds keys to the session keyring, it is highly recommended that one  use  <b>pam_keyinit</b>  to
       ensure that a session keyring is established at login time.
