</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       systemd-creds - Lists, shows, encrypts and decrypts service credentials

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>

       <b>systemd-creds</b> [OPTIONS...] COMMAND [ARGS...]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>systemd-creds</b> is a tool for listing, showing, encrypting and decrypting unit credentials. Credentials are
       limited-size binary or textual objects that may be passed to unit processes. They are primarily used for
       passing cryptographic keys (both public and private) or certificates, user account information or
       identity information from the host to services.

       Credentials are configured in unit files via the <u>ImportCredential=</u>, <u>LoadCredential=</u>, <u>SetCredential=</u>,
       <u>LoadCredentialEncrypted=</u>, and <u>SetCredentialEncrypted=</u> settings, see <b><a href="../man5/systemd.exec.5.html">systemd.exec</a></b>(5) for details.

       For further information see <b>System</b> <b>and</b> <b>Service</b> <b>Credentials</b>[1] documentation.

</pre><h4><b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       The following commands are understood:

       <b>list</b>
           Show a list of credentials passed into the current execution context. This command shows the files in
           the directory referenced by the <u>$CREDENTIALS_DIRECTORY</u> environment variable, and is intended to be
           executed from within service context.

           Along with each credential name, the size and security state is shown. The latter is one of "secure"
           (in case the credential is backed by unswappable memory, i.e.  "ramfs"), "weak" (in case it is backed
           by any other type of memory), or "insecure" (if having any access mode that is not 0400, i.e. if
           readable by anyone but the owner).

           Added in version 250.

       <b>cat</b> <u>credential...</u>
           Show contents of specified credentials passed into the current execution context. Takes one or more
           credential names, whose contents shall be written to standard output.

           When combined with <b>--json=</b> or <b>--transcode=</b> the output is transcoded in simple ways before outputting.

           Added in version 250.

       <b>setup</b>
           Generates a host encryption key for credentials, if one has not been generated already. This ensures
           the /var/lib/systemd/credential.secret file is initialized with a random secret key if it doesn't
           exist yet. This secret key is used when encrypting/decrypting credentials with <b>encrypt</b> or <b>decrypt</b>,
           and is only accessible to the root user. Note that there's typically no need to invoke this command
           explicitly as it is implicitly called when <b>encrypt</b> is invoked, and credential host key encryption
           selected.

           Added in version 250.

       <b>encrypt</b> <u>input|-</u> <u>output|-</u>
           Loads the specified (unencrypted plaintext) input credential file, encrypts it and writes the
           (encrypted ciphertext) output to the specified target credential file. The resulting file may be
           referenced in the <u>LoadCredentialEncrypted=</u> setting in unit files, or its contents used literally in
           <u>SetCredentialEncrypted=</u> settings.

           Takes two file system paths. The file name part of the output path is embedded as name in the
           encrypted credential, to ensure encrypted credentials cannot be renamed and reused for different
           purposes without this being noticed. The credential name to embed may be overridden with the <b>--name=</b>
           setting. The input or output paths may be specified as "-", in which case the credential data is read
           from/written to standard input and standard output. If the output path is specified as "-" the
           credential name cannot be derived from the file system path, and thus should be specified explicitly
           via the <b>--name=</b> switch.

           The credential data is encrypted and authenticated symmetrically with one of the following encryption
           keys:

            1. A secret key automatically derived from the system's TPM2 chip. This encryption key is not stored
               on the host system and thus decryption is only possible with access to the original TPM2 chip. Or
               in other words, the credential secured in this way can only be decrypted again by the local
               machine.

            2. A secret key stored in the /var/lib/systemd/credential.secret file which is only accessible to
               the root user. This "host" encryption key is stored on the host file system, and thus decryption
               is possible with access to the host file system and sufficient privileges. The key is
               automatically generated when needed, but can also be created explicitly with the <b>setup</b> command,
               see above.

            3. A combination of the above: an encryption key derived from both the TPM2 chip and the host file
               system. This means decryption requires both access to the original TPM2 chip and the OS
               installation. This is the default mode of operation if a TPM2 chip is available and
               <a href="file:/var/lib/systemd/">/var/lib/systemd/</a> resides on persistent media.

           Which of the three keys shall be used for encryption may be configured with the <b>--with-key=</b> switch.
           Depending on the use-case for the encrypted credential the key to use may differ. For example, for
           credentials that shall be accessible from the initrd, encryption with the host key is not
           appropriate, since access to the host key is typically not available from the initrd. Thus, for such
           credentials only the TPM2 key should be used.

           Encrypted credentials are always encoded in Base64.

           Use <b>decrypt</b> (see below) to undo the encryption operation, and acquire the decrypted plaintext
           credential from the encrypted ciphertext credential.

           The credential data is encrypted using AES256-GCM, i.e. providing both confidentiality and integrity,
           keyed by a SHA256 hash of one or both of the secret keys described above.

           Added in version 250.

       <b>decrypt</b> <u>input|-</u> [<u>output|-</u>]
           Undoes the effect of the <b>encrypt</b> operation: loads the specified (encrypted ciphertext) input
           credential file, decrypts and authenticates it and writes the (decrypted plaintext) output to the
           specified target credential file.

           Takes one or two file system paths. The file name part of the input path is compared with the
           credential name embedded in the encrypted file. If it does not match decryption fails. This is done
           in order to ensure that encrypted credentials are not re-purposed without this being detected. The
           credential name to compare with the embedded credential name may also be overridden with the <b>--name=</b>
           switch. If the input path is specified as "-", the encrypted credential is read from standard input.
           If only one path is specified or the output path specified as "-", the decrypted credential is
           written to standard output. In this mode, the expected name embedded in the credential cannot be
           derived from the path and should be specified explicitly with <b>--name=</b>.

           Decrypting credentials requires access to the original TPM2 chip and/or credentials host key, see
           above. Information about which keys are required is embedded in the encrypted credential data, and
           thus decryption is entirely automatic.

           Added in version 250.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
           Print a short help text and exit.

       <b>--version</b>
           Print a short version string and exit.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--system</b>
           When specified with the <b>list</b> and <b>cat</b> commands operates on the credentials passed to system as a whole
           instead of on those passed to the current execution context. This is useful in container environments
           where credentials may be passed in from the container manager.

           Added in version 250.

       <b>--user</b>
           When specified with the <b>encrypt</b> and <b>decrypt</b> commands encrypts a user-scoped (rather than a
           system-scoped) credential. Use <b>--uid=</b> to select which user the credential is from. Such credentials
           may only be decrypted from the specified user's context, except if privileges can be acquired.
           Generally, when an encrypted credential shall be used in the per-user service manager it should be
           encrypted with this option set, when it shall be used in the system service manager it should be
           encrypted without.

           Internally, this ensures that the selected user's numeric UID and username, as well as the system's
           <b><a href="../man5/machine-id.5.html">machine-id</a></b>(5) are incorporated into the encryption key.

           Added in version 256.

       <b>--uid=</b>
           Specifies the user to encrypt the credential for. Takes a user name or numeric UID. If set, implies
           <b>--user</b>. If set to the special string "self" sets the user to the user of the calling process. If
           <b>--user</b> is used without <b>--uid=</b> then <b>--uid=self</b> is implied, i.e. the credential is encrypted for the
           calling user.

           Added in version 256.

       <b>--transcode=</b>
           When specified with the <b>cat</b> or <b>decrypt</b> commands, transcodes the output before showing it. Takes one
           of "base64", "unbase64", "hex" or "unhex" as argument, in order to encode/decode the credential data
           with Base64 or as series of hexadecimal values.

           Note that this has no effect on the <b>encrypt</b> command, as encrypted credentials are unconditionally
           encoded in Base64.

           Added in version 250.

       <b>--newline=</b>
           When specified with <b>cat</b> or <b>decrypt</b> controls whether to add a trailing newline character to the end of
           the output if it doesn't end in one, anyway. Takes one of "auto", "yes" or "no". The default mode of
           "auto" will suffix the output with a single newline character only when writing credential data to a
           TTY.

           Added in version 250.

       <b>--pretty</b>, <b>-p</b>
           When specified with <b>encrypt</b> controls whether to show the encrypted credential as
           <u>SetCredentialEncrypted=</u> setting that may be pasted directly into a unit file. Has effect only when
           used together with <b>--name=</b> and "-" as the output file.

           Added in version 250.

       <b>--name=</b><u>name</u>
           When specified with the <b>encrypt</b> command controls the credential name to embed in the encrypted
           credential data. If not specified the name is chosen automatically from the filename component of the
           specified output path. If specified as empty string no credential name is embedded in the encrypted
           credential, and no verification of credential name is done when the credential is decrypted.

           When specified with the <b>decrypt</b> command control the credential name to validate the credential name
           embedded in the encrypted credential with. If not specified the name is chosen automatically from the
           filename component of the specified input path. If no credential name is embedded in the encrypted
           credential file (i.e. the <b>--name=</b> with an empty string was used when encrypted) the specified name
           has no effect as no credential name validation is done.

           Embedding the credential name in the encrypted credential is done in order to protect against reuse
           of credentials for purposes they weren't originally intended for, under the assumption the credential
           name is chosen carefully to encode its intended purpose.

           Added in version 250.

       <b>--timestamp=</b><u>timestamp</u>
           When specified with the <b>encrypt</b> command controls the timestamp to embed into the encrypted
           credential. Defaults to the current time. Takes a timestamp specification in the format described in
           <b><a href="../man7/systemd.time.7.html">systemd.time</a></b>(7).

           When specified with the <b>decrypt</b> command controls the timestamp to use to validate the "not-after"
           timestamp that was configured with <b>--not-after=</b> during encryption. If not specified defaults to the
           current system time.

           Added in version 250.

       <b>--not-after=</b><u>timestamp</u>
           When specified with the <b>encrypt</b> command controls the time when the credential shall not be used
           anymore. This embeds the specified timestamp in the encrypted credential. During decryption the
           timestamp is checked against the current system clock, and if the timestamp is in the past the
           decryption will fail. By default no such timestamp is set. Takes a timestamp specification in the
           format described in <b><a href="../man7/systemd.time.7.html">systemd.time</a></b>(7).

           Added in version 250.

       <b>--with-key=</b>, <b>-H</b>, <b>-T</b>
           When specified with the <b>encrypt</b> command controls the encryption/signature key to use. Takes one of
           "host", "tpm2", "host+tpm2", "null", "auto", "auto-initrd". See above for details on the three key
           types. If set to "auto" (which is the default) the TPM2 key is used if a TPM2 device is found and not
           running in a container. The host key is used if <a href="file:/var/lib/systemd/">/var/lib/systemd/</a> is on persistent media. This means
           on typical systems the encryption is by default bound to both the TPM2 chip and the OS installation,
           and both need to be available to decrypt the credential again. If "auto" is selected but neither TPM2
           is available (or running in container) nor <a href="file:/var/lib/systemd/">/var/lib/systemd/</a> is on persistent media, encryption will
           fail. If set to "null" a fixed zero length key is used (thus, in this mode no confidentiality nor
           authenticity are provided!). This logic is useful to cover for systems that lack a TPM2 chip but
           where credentials shall be generated. Note that decryption of such credentials is refused on systems
           that have a TPM2 chip and where UEFI SecureBoot is enabled (this is done so that such a locked down
           system cannot be tricked into loading a credential generated this way that lacks authentication
           information). If set to "auto-initrd" a TPM2 key is used if a TPM2 is found. If not a fixed zero
           length key is used, equivalent to "null" mode. This option is particularly useful to generate
           credentials files that are encrypted/authenticated against TPM2 where available but still work on
           systems lacking support for this.

           The <b>-H</b> switch is a shortcut for <b>--with-key=host</b>. Similar, <b>-T</b> is a shortcut for <b>--with-key=tpm2</b>.

           When encrypting credentials that shall be used in the initrd (where <a href="file:/var/lib/systemd/">/var/lib/systemd/</a> is typically
           not available) make sure to use <b>--with-key=auto-initrd</b> mode, to disable binding against the host
           secret.

           This switch has no effect on the <b>decrypt</b> command, as information on which key to use for decryption
           is included in the encrypted credential already.

           Added in version 250.

       <b>--tpm2-device=</b><u>PATH</u>
           Controls the TPM2 device to use. Expects a device node path referring to the TPM2 chip (e.g.
           /dev/tpmrm0). Alternatively the special value "auto" may be specified, in order to automatically
           determine the device node of a suitable TPM2 device (of which there must be exactly one). The special
           value "list" may be used to enumerate all suitable TPM2 devices currently discovered.

           Added in version 250.

       <b>--tpm2-pcrs=</b><u>PCR[+PCR...]</u>
           Configures the TPM2 PCRs (Platform Configuration Registers) to bind the encryption key to. Takes a
           "+" separated list of numeric PCR indexes in the range 0...23. If not used, defaults to PCR 7 only.
           If an empty string is specified, binds the encryption key to no PCRs at all. For details about the
           PCRs available, see the documentation of the switch of the same name for <b><a href="../man1/systemd-cryptenroll.1.html">systemd-cryptenroll</a></b>(1).

           Added in version 250.

       <b>--tpm2-public-key=</b><u>PATH</u>, <b>--tpm2-public-key-pcrs=</b><u>PCR[+PCR...]</u>
           Configures a TPM2 signed PCR policy to bind encryption to, for use with the <b>encrypt</b> command. The
           <b>--tpm2-public-key=</b> option accepts a path to a PEM encoded RSA public key, to bind the encryption to.
           If this is not specified explicitly, but a file tpm2-pcr-public-key.pem exists in one of the
           directories <a href="file:/etc/systemd/">/etc/systemd/</a>, <a href="file:/run/systemd/">/run/systemd/</a>, <a href="file:/usr/lib/systemd/">/usr/lib/systemd/</a> (searched in this order), it is
           automatically used. The <b>--tpm2-public-key-pcrs=</b> option takes a list of TPM2 PCR indexes to bind to
           (same syntax as <b>--tpm2-pcrs=</b> described above). If not specified defaults to 11 (i.e. this binds the
           policy to any unified kernel image for which a PCR signature can be provided).

           Note the difference between <b>--tpm2-pcrs=</b> and <b>--tpm2-public-key-pcrs=</b>: the former binds decryption to
           the current, specific PCR values; the latter binds decryption to any set of PCR values for which a
           signature by the specified public key can be provided. The latter is hence more useful in scenarios
           where software updates shall be possible without losing access to all previously encrypted secrets.

           Added in version 252.

       <b>--tpm2-signature=</b><u>PATH</u>
           Takes a path to a TPM2 PCR signature file as generated by the <b><a href="../man1/systemd-measure.1.html">systemd-measure</a></b>(1) tool and that may be
           used to allow the <b>decrypt</b> command to decrypt credentials that are bound to specific signed PCR
           values. If this is not specified explicitly, and a credential with a signed PCR policy is attempted
           to be decrypted, a suitable signature file tpm2-pcr-signature.json is searched for in <a href="file:/etc/systemd/">/etc/systemd/</a>,
           <a href="file:/run/systemd/">/run/systemd/</a>, <a href="file:/usr/lib/systemd/">/usr/lib/systemd/</a> (in this order) and used.

           Added in version 252.

       <b>--allow-null</b>
           Allow decrypting credentials that use an empty key.

           Added in version 256.

       <b>--quiet</b>, <b>-q</b>
           Suppress additional output.

           Added in version 251.

       <b>--no-pager</b>
           Do not pipe output into a pager.

       <b>--no-legend</b>
           Do not print the legend, i.e. column headers and the footer with hints.

       <b>--json=</b><u>MODE</u>
           Shows output formatted as JSON. Expects one of "short" (for the shortest possible output without any
           redundant whitespace or line breaks), "pretty" (for a pretty version of the same, with indentation
           and line breaks) or "off" (to turn off JSON output, the default).

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       On success, 0 is returned.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Example</b> <b>1.</b> <b>Encrypt</b> <b>a</b> <b>password</b> <b>for</b> <b>use</b> <b>as</b> <b>credential</b>

       The following command line encrypts the specified password "hunter2", writing the result to a file
       password.cred.

           # echo -n hunter2 | systemd-creds encrypt - password.cred

       This decrypts the file password.cred again, revealing the literal password:

           # systemd-creds decrypt password.cred
           hunter2

       <b>Example</b> <b>2.</b> <b>Encrypt</b> <b>a</b> <b>password</b> <b>and</b> <b>include</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>unit</b> <b>file</b>

       The following command line prompts the user for a password and generates a <u>SetCredentialEncrypted=</u> line
       from it for a credential named "mysql-password", suitable for inclusion in a unit file.

           # systemd-ask-password -n | systemd-creds encrypt --name=mysql-password -p - -
           🔐 Password: ****
           SetCredentialEncrypted=mysql-password: \

       The generated line can be pasted 1:1 into a unit file, and will ensure the acquired password will be made
       available in the <u>$CREDENTIALS_DIRECTORY</u>/mysql-password credential file for the started service.

       Utilizing the unit file drop-in logic this can be used to securely pass a password credential to a unit.
