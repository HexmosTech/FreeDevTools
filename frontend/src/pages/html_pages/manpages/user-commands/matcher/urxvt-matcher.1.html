</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       matcher - match strings in terminal output and change their rendition

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Uses per-line display filtering ("on_line_update") to underline text matching a certain pattern and make
       it clickable. When clicked with the mouse button specified in the "matcher.button" resource (default 2,
       or middle), the program specified in the "matcher.launcher" resource (default, the "url-launcher"
       resource, "sensible-browser") will be started with the matched text as first argument. The default
       configuration is suitable for matching URLs and launching a web browser, like the former "mark-urls"
       extension.

       The default pattern to match URLs can be overridden with the "matcher.pattern.0" resource, and additional
       patterns can be specified with numbered patterns, in a manner similar to the "selection" extension.  The
       launcher can also be overridden on a per-pattern basis.

       It is possible to activate the most recently seen match or a list of matches from the keyboard. Simply
       bind a keysym to "matcher:last" or "matcher:list" as seen in the example below.

       The "matcher:select" action enables a mode in which it is possible to iterate over the matches using the
       keyboard and either activate them or copy them to the clipboard. While the mode is active, normal
       terminal input/output is suspended and the following bindings are recognized:

       "Up"
           Search for a match upwards.

       "Down"
           Search for a match downwards.

       "Home"
           Jump to the topmost match.

       "End"
           Jump to the bottommost match.

       "Escape"
           Leave the mode and return to the point where search was started.

       "Enter"
           Activate the current match.

       "y" Copy the current match to the clipboard.

       It  is  also  possible to cycle through the matches using a key combination bound to the "matcher:select"
       action.

       Example: load and use the matcher extension with defaults.

           URxvt.perl-ext:           default,matcher

       Example: use a custom configuration.

           URxvt.url-launcher:       sensible-browser
           URxvt.keysym.C-Delete:    matcher:last
           URxvt.keysym.M-Delete:    matcher:list
           URxvt.matcher.button:     1
           URxvt.matcher.pattern.1:  \\bwww\\.[\\w-]+\\.[\\w./?&amp;@#-]*[\\w/-]
           URxvt.matcher.pattern.2:  \\B(/\\S+?):(\\d+)(?=:|$)
           URxvt.matcher.launcher.2: gvim +$2 $1

   <b>Regex</b> <b>encoding/wide</b> <b>character</b> <b>matching</b>
       Urxvt stores all text as unicode, in a special encoding that uses one character/code  point  per  column.
       For  various  reasons,  the  regular  expressions are matched directly against this encoding, which means
       there are a few things you need to keep in mind:

       X resources/command line arguments are locale-encoded
           The regexes taken from the command line or resources  will  be  converted  from  locale  encoding  to
           unicode. This can change the number of code points per character.

       Wide characters are column-padded with $urxvt::NOCHAR
           Wide  characters  (such  as  kanji  and  sometimes  tabs)  are  padded with a special character value
           ($urxvt::NOCHAR). That means that constructs such as "\w" or "." will only match part of a character,
           as $urxvt::NOCHAR is not matched by "\w" and both only match the first "column" of a wide character.

           That means you have to  incorporate  $urxvt::NOCHAR  into  parts  of  regexes  that  may  match  wide
           characters.  For  example, to match "\w+" you might want to use "[\w$urxvt::NOCHAR]+" instead, and to
           match a single character (".") you might want to use ".$urxvt::NOCHAR*" instead.
