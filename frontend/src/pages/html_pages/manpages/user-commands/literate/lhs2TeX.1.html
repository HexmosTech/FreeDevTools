</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       lhs2TeX - a literate Haskell to (La)TeX code translator

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>lhs2TeX</b> [options] file

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This  tool  takes  as  its  input  a  literate  Haskell  source file (Bird-style or LaTeX-style or even a
       combination thereof), and produces output, which, depending on the <b>STYLE</b> selected, can be either a  LaTeX
       document  or  a  stripped version of the code.  The output is produced on stdout.  Several directives are
       interpreted by <b>lhs2TeX</b> itself and can be used to customize the output further.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       There are two sorts of options for <b>lhs2TeX</b>. The first selects a <b>STYLE</b> which governs the  overal  mode  of
       operation for <b>lhs2TeX</b>. Only one style may be selected:

       <b>--poly</b> The  poly  style is an improvement of the older <b>math</b> style. It produces a LaTeX document, with the
              code blocks formatted  using  a  proportional  font.  The  output  is  highly  customizable  using
              formatting directives. Furthermore, the resulting code respects some of the alignments made in the
              source file.

       <b>--math</b> The  math  style  is  as  <b>poly</b> style, but has less alignment capabilities. Tokens appearing in the
              source file at a special column are  all  aligned  in  the  output.  Furthermore,  indentation  is
              respected.

       <b>--newcode</b>
              In  the new code style, everything but code blocks is stripped from the file. In addition, certain
              syntactic transformations can be performed on the code using formatting directives.  For  example,
              if  the source code is annotated in certain positions to produce even nicer results in <b>poly</b> style,
              one can use <b>newcode</b> style to remove these annotations.

       <b>--code</b> In code style, all comments and specification code is stripped from the file,  so  that  only  the
              code remains. Use this if you want to produce a smaller version of your source file.

       <b>--tt</b>   Typewriter  style  prints  code  almost  verbatim, using a monospaced font, but formatting certain
              symbols (lambda abstraction, arrows ...) using an extended character set. This style is default if
              no style is explicitly selected, but this behaviour should not be relied upon.  The default  style
              may be changed in future versions.

       <b>--verb</b> Verbatim  style prints code as-is, using a monospaced font. No formatting whatsoever is applied to
              the code. However, <b>lhs2TeX</b> does not make use of a LaTeX verbatim environment, but  rather  escapes
              special  TeX  constructs  in the translation. This implies that it is easier to pass the resulting
              TeX code to macros or use it inside certain environments than it would be with a native  verbatim-
              environment.

       The following options are considered are also considered as styles, but return only information about the
       program:

       <b>-h</b>, <b>-?</b>, <b>--help</b>
              Returns a short usage message listing all the available options.

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--version</b>
              Returns version information.

       <b>--copying</b>
              Displays the complete GNU General Public License.

       <b>--warranty</b>
              Displays the parts of the GPL than concerns warranty.

       The remaining options modify the behaviour of the program.

       <b>-P</b><u>path</u>, <b>--path=</b><u>path</u>
              Takes  a  (colon-separated)  list  <u>path</u>  of  paths  that  are  used as search path for files to be
              included. If the list starts with a colon, then the list is appended to the current  search  path.
              If  the list ends with a colon, then the list is prepended to the current search path. If there is
              neither a colon at the beginning nor at the end of the list, then the list  replaces  the  current
              search path.

              Environment  variables  can be used in the list of paths, if enclosed in curly braces, i.e., <u>{VAR}</u>
              expands to the current value of the environment variable VAR. If a path ends with a  double  slash
              <u>//</u>,  then  all  subdirectories  of  that  path are included in the search path. Note that this can
              significantly slow down <b>lhs2TeX</b> when looking for files.

              The built-in default search path of <b>lhs2TeX</b> is

                 {HOME}/lhs2TeX//
                 {HOME}/.lhs2TeX//
                 {LHS2TEX}//
                 /usr/local/share/lhs2tex//
                 /usr/local/share/lhs2TeX//
                 /usr/local/lib/lhs2tex//
                 /usr/local/lib/lhs2TeX//
                 /usr/share/lhs2tex//
                 /usr/share/lhs2TeX//
                 /usr/lib/lhs2tex//
                 /usr/lib/lhs2TeX//

       <b>-i</b><u>file</u>, <b>--include=</b><u>file</u>
              Includes <u>file</u> before anything else. This option has the same effect as an

                 %include <u>file</u>

              directive at the beginning of the source file.

       <b>-l</b><u>equation</u>, <b>--let=</b><u>equation</u>
              Assumes <u>equation</u> while processing the source file. This option has the same effect as a

                 %let <u>equation</u>

              directive at the beginning of the source file.

       <b>-s</b><u>flag</u>, <b>--set=</b><u>flag</u>
              Sets <u>flag</u> to <b>True</b> at the beginning of the source file. This option has the same effect as a

                 %let <u>flag</u>=True

              at the beginning of the source file.

       <b>-u</b><u>flag</u>, <b>--unset=</b><u>flag</u>
              Sets <u>flag</u> to <b>False</b> at the beginning of the source file. This option has the same effect as a

                 %let <u>flag</u>=False

              at the beginning of the source file.
