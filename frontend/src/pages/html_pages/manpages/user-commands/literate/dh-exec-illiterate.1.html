       dh-exec-illiterate - Write literate debhelper config files!

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>#!</b> <b>/usr/bin/dh-exec</b> <b>--with=illiterate,subst,install</b>
       Greetings, my dear reader, and welcome to the awesome world of
       literate programming!

       Today, we're going to explore how to write a debhelper install file in
       a literate manner. Trust me, it's going to be lots and lots of fun!

       So, what exactly are we trying to accomplish? We're going to try
       installing a file from `src/this-file' in the source tree, to a
       multi-arched path in the binary file. Lets say, to
       `/usr/lib/foo/${DEB_HOST_MULTIARCH}/'.

       Of course, ${DEB_HOST_MULTIARCH} is a variable, and will be expanded
       later in the dh-exec pipeline. It'll be something like
       x86_64-linux-gnu.

       Furthermore, we want to install all files from the 'usr/lib' directory
       under debian/tmp. If we were writing an illiteral install file, we'd
       write this rule as:

           usr/lib

       But the above description is much easier to understand, isn't it?

       We're almost finished! One thing left to do, is to install a script
       named `rename-me', to `/usr/share/foo/new-name' - we renamed it
       in the process!

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The dh-exec-illiterate sub-command, unlike the others, does not serve any particular case, except to
       serve as a warning to all, that things can be taken to an extreme, even with dh-exec. On the other hand,
       it is just like the other sub-commands in that it must not be called directly, but through <u><a href="../man1/dh-exec.1.html">dh-exec</a></u>(1),
       which automatically runs all available sub-commands if run bare; or explicitly with <b>dh-exec</b>
       <b>--with=illiterate</b>.

       It is a program that will translate its input from pretty much free-form text into something that
       resembles an install file. At least, that's the only supported output format for now.

       Everything that's not recognised, will be ignored, and not printed. The recognised constructs are:

       <b>`source'</b> <u>...</u> <b>`destination'</b>
              The  first  string  between  a backtick and a single quote will be treated as the source file, the
              next such string will be the destination. If the destination ends with a slash, dh-exec-illiterate
              will consider it a directory, otherwise it  will  output  a  construct  that  dh-exec-install  can
              recognise as a rename operation.

       <b>'source'</b>
              A  string, without whitespace, between two single quotes is treated as a source, whose destination
              is unspecified, and is left up to <u><a href="../man1/dh_install.1.html">dh_install</a></u>(1) to figure out.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <u>DH_EXEC_SCRIPTDIR</u>
           Indicates which directory the command-specific scripts  should  be  sought  for.  If  not  specified,
           scripts will be searched for in <u>/usr/share/dh-exec/</u>.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <u>$DH_EXEC_SCRIPTDIR/dh-exec-illiterate-*</u>
           The various scripts for the higher-level program.

</pre><h4><b>VERSIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The sub-command was introduced in dh-exec version <u>0.1</u>.
