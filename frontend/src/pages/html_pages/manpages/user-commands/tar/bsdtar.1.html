       tar — manipulate tape archives

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>tar</b> [<u>bundled-flags</u> ⟨args⟩] [⟨<u>file</u>⟩ | ⟨<u>pattern</u>⟩ ...]
       <b>tar</b> {<b>-c</b>} [<u>options</u>] [<u>files</u> | <u>directories</u>]
       <b>tar</b> {<b>-r</b> | <b>-u</b>} <b>-f</b> <u>archive-file</u> [<u>options</u>] [<u>files</u> | <u>directories</u>]
       <b>tar</b> {<b>-t</b> | <b>-x</b>} [<u>options</u>] [<u>patterns</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>tar</b>  creates  and  manipulates  streaming  archive files.  This implementation can extract from tar, pax,
       cpio, zip, jar, ar, xar, rpm, 7-zip, and ISO 9660 cdrom images and can create tar, pax,  cpio,  ar,  zip,
       7-zip, and shar archives.

       The  first  synopsis  form  shows a “bundled” option word.  This usage is provided for compatibility with
       historical implementations.  See COMPATIBILITY below for details.

       The other synopsis forms show the preferred usage.  The first option to <b>tar</b> is a mode indicator from  the
       following list:
       <b>-c</b>      Create a new archive containing the specified items.  The long option form is <b>--create</b>.
       <b>-r</b>      Like  <b>-c</b>, but new entries are appended to the archive.  Note that this only works on uncompressed
               archives stored in regular files.  The <b>-f</b> option is required.  The long option form is <b>--append</b>.
       <b>-t</b>      List archive contents to stdout.  The long option form is <b>--list</b>.
       <b>-u</b>      Like <b>-r</b>, but new entries are added  only  if  they  have  a  modification  date  newer  than  the
               corresponding entry in the archive.  Note that this only works on uncompressed archives stored in
               regular files.  The <b>-f</b> option is required.  The long form is <b>--update</b>.
       <b>-x</b>      Extract  to  disk  from  the archive.  If a file with the same name appears more than once in the
               archive, each copy will be extracted, with later copies overwriting (replacing)  earlier  copies.
               The long option form is <b>--extract</b>.

       In <b>-c</b>, <b>-r</b>, or <b>-u</b> mode, each specified file or directory is added to the archive in the order specified on
       the command line.  By default, the contents of each directory are also archived.

       In  extract  or  list mode, the entire command line is read and parsed before the archive is opened.  The
       pathnames or patterns on the command line indicate which  items  in  the  archive  should  be  processed.
       Patterns are shell-style globbing patterns as documented in <u><a href="../man1/tcsh.1.html">tcsh</a></u>(1).

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Unless specifically stated otherwise, options are applicable in all operating modes.

       <b>@</b><u>archive</u>
               (c  and  r  modes only) The specified archive is opened and the entries in it will be appended to
               the current archive.  As a simple example,
                     <b>tar</b> <b>-c</b> <b>-f</b> <u>-</u> <u>newfile</u> <b>@</b><u>original.tar</u>
               writes a new archive to standard output containing a file <u>newfile</u> and all  of  the  entries  from
               <u>original.tar</u>.  In contrast,
                     <b>tar</b> <b>-c</b> <b>-f</b> <u>-</u> <u>newfile</u> <u>original.tar</u>
               creates a new archive with only two entries.  Similarly,
                     <b>tar</b> <b>-czf</b> <u>-</u> <b>--format</b> <b>pax</b> <b>@</b><u>-</u>
               reads an archive from standard input (whose format will be determined automatically) and converts
               it  into a gzip-compressed pax-format archive on stdout.  In this way, <b>tar</b> can be used to convert
               archives from one format to another.

       <b>-a</b>, <b>--auto-compress</b>
               (c mode only) Use the archive suffix to decide a set of the format and the  compressions.   As  a
               simple example,
                     <b>tar</b> <b>-a</b> <b>-cf</b> <u>archive.tgz</u> <u>source.c</u> <u>source.h</u>
               creates a new archive with restricted pax format and gzip compression,
                     <b>tar</b> <b>-a</b> <b>-cf</b> <u>archive.tar.bz2.uu</u> <u>source.c</u> <u>source.h</u>
               creates a new archive with restricted pax format and bzip2 compression and uuencode compression,
                     <b>tar</b> <b>-a</b> <b>-cf</b> <u>archive.zip</u> <u>source.c</u> <u>source.h</u>
               creates a new archive with zip format,
                     <b>tar</b> <b>-a</b> <b>-jcf</b> <u>archive.tgz</u> <u>source.c</u> <u>source.h</u>
               ignores  the  “-j”  option,  and  creates  a  new  archive  with  restricted  pax format and gzip
               compression,
                     <b>tar</b> <b>-a</b> <b>-jcf</b> <u>archive.xxx</u> <u>source.c</u> <u>source.h</u>
               if it is unknown suffix or no suffix, creates a new archive with restricted pax format and  bzip2
               compression.

       <b>--acls</b>  (c,  r,  u,  x  modes  only)  Archive  or extract POSIX.1e or NFSv4 ACLs.  This is the reverse of
               <b>--no-acls</b> and the default behavior in c, r, and u modes (except on Mac OS X) or if <b>tar</b> is run  in
               x  mode  as  root.   On  Mac  OS  X this option translates extended ACLs to NFSv4 ACLs.  To store
               extended ACLs the <b>--mac-metadata</b> option is preferred.

       <b>-B</b>, <b>--read-full-blocks</b>
               Ignored for compatibility with other <u><a href="../man1/tar.1.html">tar</a></u>(1) implementations.

       <b>-b</b> <u>blocksize</u>, <b>--block-size</b> <u>blocksize</u>
               Specify the block size, in 512-byte records, for tape drive I/O.  As a  rule,  this  argument  is
               only needed when reading from or writing to tape drives, and usually not even then as the default
               block size of 20 records (10240 bytes) is very common.

       <b>-C</b> <u>directory</u>, <b>--cd</b> <u>directory</u>, <b>--directory</b> <u>directory</u>
               In c and r mode, this changes the directory before adding the following files.  In x mode, change
               directories after opening the archive but before extracting entries from the archive.

       <b>--chroot</b>
               (x  mode  only)  <b>chroot</b>()  to  the  current  directory after processing any <b>-C</b> options and before
               extracting any files.

       <b>--clear-nochange-fflags</b>
               (x mode only) Before removing file system objects to replace them, clear  platform-specific  file
               attributes or file flags that might prevent removal.

       <b>--exclude</b> <u>pattern</u>
               Do  not process files or directories that match the specified pattern.  Note that exclusions take
               precedence over patterns or filenames specified on the command line.

       <b>--exclude-vcs</b>
               Do not process files or directories internally  used  by  the  version  control  systems  ‘Arch’,
               ‘Bazaar’, ‘CVS’, ‘Darcs’, ‘Mercurial’, ‘RCS’, ‘SCCS’, ‘SVN’ and ‘git’.

       <b>--fflags</b>
               (c, r, u, x modes only) Archive or extract platform-specific file attributes or file flags.  This
               is the reverse of <b>--no-fflags</b> and the default behavior in c, r, and u modes or if <b>tar</b> is run in x
               mode as root.

       <b>--format</b> <u>format</u>
               (c,  r, u mode only) Use the specified format for the created archive.  Supported formats include
               “cpio”,  “pax”,  “shar”,   and   “ustar”.    Other   formats   may   also   be   supported;   see
               <u><a href="../man5/libarchive-formats.5.html">libarchive-formats</a></u>(5)  for more information about currently-supported formats.  In r and u modes,
               when extending an existing archive, the format specified here must be compatible with the  format
               of the existing archive on disk.

       <b>-f</b> <u>file</u>, <b>--file</b> <u>file</u>
               Read  the  archive  from  or  write the archive to the specified file.  The filename can be <u>-</u> for
               standard input or standard output.  The default varies by system;  on  FreeBSD,  the  default  is
               <u>/dev/sa0</u>; on Linux, the default is <u>/dev/st0</u>.

       <b>--gid</b> <u>id</u>
               Use  the  provided  group id number.  On extract, this overrides the group id in the archive; the
               group name in the archive will be ignored.  On create, this overrides  the  group  id  read  from
               disk; if <b>--gname</b> is not also specified, the group name will be set to match the group id.

       <b>--gname</b> <u>name</u>
               Use  the  provided  group name.  On extract, this overrides the group name in the archive; if the
               provided group name does not exist on the system, the group id (from  the  archive  or  from  the
               <b>--gid</b>  option)  will be used instead.  On create, this sets the group name that will be stored in
               the archive; the name will not be verified against the system group database.

       <b>--group</b> <u>name</u>[:<u>gid</u>]
               Use the provided group, if <u>gid</u> is not provided, <u>name</u> can be either a group name  or  numeric  id.
               See the <b>--gname</b> option for details.

       <b>-H</b>      (c and r modes only) Symbolic links named on the command line will be followed; the target of the
               link will be archived, not the link itself.

       <b>-h</b>      (c and r modes only) Synonym for <b>-L</b>.

       <b>-I</b>      Synonym for <b>-T</b>.

       <b>--help</b>  Show usage.

       <b>--hfsCompression</b>
               (x  mode  only)  Mac  OS  X specific (v10.6 or later). Compress extracted regular files with HFS+
               compression.

       <b>--ignore-zeros</b>
               An alias of <b>--options</b> <b>read_concatenated_archives</b> for compatibility with GNU tar.

       <b>--include</b> <u>pattern</u>
               Process only files or directories  that  match  the  specified  pattern.   Note  that  exclusions
               specified  with  <b>--exclude</b>  take  precedence  over  inclusions.   If no inclusions are explicitly
               specified, all entries are processed by default.  The <b>--include</b> option is especially useful  when
               filtering archives.  For example, the command
                     <b>tar</b> <b>-c</b> <b>-f</b> <u>new.tar</u> <b>--include='*foo*'</b> <b>@</b><u>old.tgz</u>
               creates  a  new  archive  <u>new.tar</u>  containing only the entries from <u>old.tgz</u> containing the string
               ‘foo’.

       <b>-J</b>, <b>--xz</b>
               (c mode only) Compress the resulting archive with <u><a href="../man1/xz.1.html">xz</a></u>(1).  In extract or list modes,  this  option
               is  ignored.   Note  that  this  <b>tar</b>  implementation recognizes XZ compression automatically when
               reading archives.

       <b>-j</b>, <b>--bzip</b>, <b>--bzip2</b>, <b>--bunzip2</b>
               (c mode only) Compress the resulting archive with <u><a href="../man1/bzip2.1.html">bzip2</a></u>(1).   In  extract  or  list  modes,  this
               option  is ignored.  Note that this <b>tar</b> implementation recognizes bzip2 compression automatically
               when reading archives.

       <b>-k</b>, <b>--keep-old-files</b>
               (x mode only) Do not overwrite existing files.  In particular, if a file appears more  than  once
               in an archive, later copies will not overwrite earlier copies.

       <b>--keep-newer-files</b>
               (x  mode  only) Do not overwrite existing files that are newer than the versions appearing in the
               archive being extracted.

       <b>-L</b>, <b>--dereference</b>
               (c and r modes only) All symbolic links will be followed.  Normally, symbolic links are  archived
               as such.  With this option, the target of the link will be archived instead.

       <b>-l</b>, <b>--check-links</b>
               (c and r modes only) Issue a warning message unless all links to each file are archived.

       <b>--lrzip</b>
               (c  mode  only)  Compress  the  resulting  archive with <u><a href="../man1/lrzip.1.html">lrzip</a></u>(1).  In extract or list modes, this
               option is ignored.  Note that this <b>tar</b> implementation recognizes lrzip compression  automatically
               when reading archives.

       <b>--lz4</b>   (c mode only) Compress the archive with lz4-compatible compression before writing it.  In extract
               or  list  modes,  this  option  is  ignored.   Note  that  this <b>tar</b> implementation recognizes lz4
               compression automatically when reading archives.

       <b>--zstd</b>  (c mode only) Compress the archive  with  zstd-compatible  compression  before  writing  it.   In
               extract or list modes, this option is ignored.  Note that this <b>tar</b> implementation recognizes zstd
               compression automatically when reading archives.

       <b>--lzma</b>  (c  mode  only)  Compress  the resulting archive with the original LZMA algorithm.  In extract or
               list modes, this option is ignored.  Use of this option is discouraged and new archives should be
               created with <b>--xz</b> instead.   Note  that  this  <b>tar</b>  implementation  recognizes  LZMA  compression
               automatically when reading archives.

       <b>--lzop</b>  (c mode only) Compress the resulting archive with <u><a href="../man1/lzop.1.html">lzop</a></u>(1).  In extract or list modes, this option
               is  ignored.   Note  that  this  <b>tar</b> implementation recognizes LZO compression automatically when
               reading archives.

       <b>-m</b>, <b>--modification-time</b>
               (x mode only) Do not extract modification time.  By default, the modification time is set to  the
               time stored in the archive.

       <b>--mac-metadata</b>
               (c,  r, u and x mode only) Mac OS X specific.  Archive or extract extended ACLs and extended file
               attributes using <u><a href="../man3/copyfile.3.html">copyfile</a></u>(3) in AppleDouble format.  This is the  reverse  of  <b>--no-mac-metadata</b>.
               and  the  default  behavior  in  c, r, and u modes or if <b>tar</b> is run in x mode as root.  Currently
               supported only for pax formats (including "pax restricted", the default tar format for bsdtar.)

       <b>-n</b>, <b>--norecurse</b>, <b>--no-recursion</b>
               Do not operate recursively on the content of directories.

       <b>--newer</b> <u>date</u>
               (c, r, u modes only) Only include files and directories newer  than  the  specified  date.   This
               compares ctime entries.

       <b>--newer-mtime</b> <u>date</u>
               (c, r, u modes only) Like <b>--newer</b>, except it compares mtime entries instead of ctime entries.

       <b>--newer-than</b> <u>file</u>
               (c,  r,  u  modes  only)  Only include files and directories newer than the specified file.  This
               compares ctime entries.

       <b>--newer-mtime-than</b> <u>file</u>
               (c, r, u modes only) Like <b>--newer-than</b>,  except  it  compares  mtime  entries  instead  of  ctime
               entries.

       <b>--nodump</b>
               (c and r modes only) Honor the nodump file flag by skipping this file.

       <b>--nopreserveHFSCompression</b>
               (x  mode  only) Mac OS X specific (v10.6 or later). Do not compress extracted regular files which
               were compressed with HFS+ compression before archived.  By default, compress  the  regular  files
               again with HFS+ compression.

       <b>--null</b>  (use  with  <b>-I</b>  or  <b>-T</b>)  Filenames or patterns are separated by null characters, not by newlines.
               This is often used to read filenames output by the <b>-print0</b> option to <u><a href="../man1/find.1.html">find</a></u>(1).

       <b>--no-acls</b>
               (c, r, u, x modes only) Do not archive or extract POSIX.1e or NFSv4 ACLs.  This is the reverse of
               <b>--acls</b> and the default behavior if <b>tar</b> is run as non-root in x mode (on Mac OS X as any  user  in
               c, r, u and x modes).

       <b>--no-fflags</b>
               (c,  r,  u,  x  modes only) Do not archive or extract file attributes or file flags.  This is the
               reverse of <b>--fflags</b> and the default behavior if <b>tar</b> is run as non-root in x mode.

       <b>--no-mac-metadata</b>
               (x mode only) Mac OS X specific.  Do not archive or extract ACLs  and  extended  file  attributes
               using <u><a href="../man3/copyfile.3.html">copyfile</a></u>(3) in AppleDouble format.  This is the reverse of <b>--mac-metadata</b>.  and the default
               behavior if <b>tar</b> is run as non-root in x mode.

       <b>--no-read-sparse</b>
               (c,  r,  u  modes  only)  Do  not read sparse file information from disk.  This is the reverse of
               <b>--read-sparse</b>.

       <b>--no-safe-writes</b>
               (x mode only) Do not create temporary files and use <u><a href="../man2/rename.2.html">rename</a></u>(2) to replace the original ones.  This
               is the reverse of <b>--safe-writes</b>.

       <b>--no-same-owner</b>
               (x mode only) Do not extract owner and group IDs.  This is the reverse of  <b>--same-owner</b>  and  the
               default behavior if <b>tar</b> is run as non-root.

       <b>--no-same-permissions</b>
               (x  mode  only)  Do not extract full permissions (SGID, SUID, sticky bit, file attributes or file
               flags, extended file attributes and ACLs).  This is the reverse of <b>-p</b> and the default behavior if
               <b>tar</b> is run as non-root.

       <b>--no-xattrs</b>
               (c, r, u, x modes only) Do not archive or extract extended file attributes.  This is the  reverse
               of <b>--xattrs</b> and the default behavior if <b>tar</b> is run as non-root in x mode.

       <b>--numeric-owner</b>
               This  is  equivalent to <b>--uname</b> "" <b>--gname</b> "".  On extract, it causes user and group names in the
               archive to be ignored in favor of the numeric user and group ids.  On create, it causes user  and
               group names to not be stored in the archive.

       <b>-O</b>, <b>--to-stdout</b>
               (x,  t  modes only) In extract (-x) mode, files will be written to standard out rather than being
               extracted to disk.  In list (-t) mode, the file listing will be written to stderr rather than the
               usual stdout.

       <b>-o</b>      (x mode) Use the user and group of the user running the program rather than  those  specified  in
               the archive.  Note that this has no significance unless <b>-p</b> is specified, and the program is being
               run  by the root user.  In this case, the file modes and flags from the archive will be restored,
               but ACLs or owner information in the archive will be discarded.

       <b>-o</b>      (c, r, u mode) A synonym for <b>--format</b> <u>ustar</u>

       <b>--older</b> <u>date</u>
               (c, r, u modes only) Only include files and directories older  than  the  specified  date.   This
               compares ctime entries.

       <b>--older-mtime</b> <u>date</u>
               (c, r, u modes only) Like <b>--older</b>, except it compares mtime entries instead of ctime entries.

       <b>--older-than</b> <u>file</u>
               (c,  r,  u  modes  only)  Only include files and directories older than the specified file.  This
               compares ctime entries.

       <b>--older-mtime-than</b> <u>file</u>
               (c, r, u modes only) Like <b>--older-than</b>,  except  it  compares  mtime  entries  instead  of  ctime
               entries.

       <b>--one-file-system</b>
               (c, r, and u modes) Do not cross mount points.

       <b>--options</b> <u>options</u>
               Select  optional  behaviors  for  particular  modules.   The argument is a text string containing
               comma-separated keywords and values.  These are passed to  the  modules  that  handle  particular
               formats to control how those formats will behave.  Each option has one of the following forms:
               <u>key=value</u>
                       The  key  will  be  set to the specified value in every module that supports it.  Modules
                       that do not support this key will ignore it.
               <u>key</u>     The key will be enabled in every module that supports it.  This is equivalent to <u>key</u><b>=1</b>.
               <u>!key</u>    The key will be disabled in every module that supports it.
               <u>module:key=value</u>, <u>module:key</u>, <u>module:!key</u>
                       As above, but the corresponding key and value will be provided only to modules whose name
                       matches <u>module</u>.

               The  complete  list  of  supported  modules  and  keys  for  create  and  append  modes   is   in
               <u><a href="../man3/archive_write_set_options.3.html">archive_write_set_options</a></u>(3) and for extract and list modes in <u><a href="../man3/archive_read_set_options.3.html">archive_read_set_options</a></u>(3).

               <b>gzip:compression-level</b>
                       A decimal integer from 1 to 9 specifying the gzip compression level.
               <b>gzip:timestamp</b>
                       Store timestamp.  This is enabled  by  default,  use  <b>!timestamp</b>  or  <b>gzip:!timestamp</b>  to
                       disable.
               <b>lrzip:compression</b>=<u>type</u>
                       Use  <u>type</u> as compression method.  Supported values are bzip2, gzip, lzo (ultra fast), and
                       zpaq (best, extremely slow).
               <b>lrzip:compression-level</b>

               <b>lz4:compression-level</b>
                       A decimal integer from 1 to 9 specifying the lzop compression level.
               <b>lz4:stream-checksum</b>
                       Enable stream checksum.  This is by default, use <b>lz4:!stream-checksum</b> to disable.
               <b>lz4:block-checksum</b>
                       Enable block checksum (Disabled by default).
               <b>lz4:block-size</b>
                       A decimal integer from 4 to 7 specifying the lz4 compression block  size  (7  is  set  by
                       default).
               <b>lz4:block-dependence</b>
                       Use  the  previous  block  of  the block being compressed for a compression dictionary to
                       improve compression ratio.
               <b>zstd:compression-level</b>=<u>N</u>
                       A decimal integer specifying the zstd compression level.  Supported values depend on  the
                       library version, common values are from 1 to 22.
               <b>zstd:threads</b>=<u>N</u>
                       Specify the number of worker threads to use, or 0 to use as many threads as there are CPU
                       cores in the system.
               <b>zstd:frame-per-file</b>
                       Start a new compression frame at the beginning of each file in the archive.
               <b>zstd:min-frame-in</b>=<u>N</u>
                       In  combination with <b>zstd:frame-per-file</b>, do not start a new compression frame unless the
                       uncompressed size of the current frame is at least <u>N</u> bytes.  The number may  be  followed
                       by <b>k</b> <b>/</b> <b>kB</b>, <b>M</b> <b>/</b> <b>MB</b>, or <b>G</b> <b>/</b> <b>GB</b> to indicate kilobytes, megabytes or gigabytes respectively.
               <b>zstd:min-frame-out</b>=<u>N</u>, <b>zstd:min-frame-size</b>=<u>N</u>
                       In  combination with <b>zstd:frame-per-file</b>, do not start a new compression frame unless the
                       compressed size of the current frame is at least <u>N</u> bytes.  The number may be followed  by
                       <b>k</b> <b>/</b> <b>kB</b>, <b>M</b> <b>/</b> <b>MB</b>, or <b>G</b> <b>/</b> <b>GB</b> to indicate kilobytes, megabytes or gigabytes respectively.
               <b>zstd:max-frame-in</b>=<u>N</u>, <b>zstd:max-frame-size</b>=<u>N</u>
                       Start  a  new  compression  frame  as soon as possible after the uncompressed size of the
                       current frame exceeds <u>N</u> bytes.  The number may be followed by <b>k</b> <b>/</b> <b>kB</b>, <b>M</b> <b>/</b> <b>MB</b>, or <b>G</b>  <b>/</b>  <b>GB</b>
                       to  indicate kilobytes, megabytes or gigabytes respectively.  Values less than 1,024 will
                       be rejected.
               <b>zstd:max-frame-out</b>=<u>N</u>
                       Start a new compression frame as soon as  possible  after  the  compressed  size  of  the
                       current  frame  exceeds <u>N</u> bytes.  The number may be followed by <b>k</b> <b>/</b> <b>kB</b>, <b>M</b> <b>/</b> <b>MB</b>, or <b>G</b> <b>/</b> <b>GB</b>
                       to indicate kilobytes, megabytes or gigabytes respectively.  Values less than 1,024  will
                       be rejected.
               <b>lzop:compression-level</b>
                       A decimal integer from 1 to 9 specifying the lzop compression level.
               <b>xz:compression-level</b>
                       A decimal integer from 0 to 9 specifying the xz compression level.
               <b>xz:threads</b>
                       Specify  the number of worker threads to use.  Setting threads to a special value 0 makes
                       <u><a href="../man1/xz.1.html">xz</a></u>(1) use as many threads as there are CPU cores on the system.
               <b>mtree:</b><u>keyword</u>
                       The mtree writer module allows you to specify which mtree keywords will  be  included  in
                       the  output.  Supported keywords include: <b>cksum</b>, <b>device</b>, <b>flags</b>, <b>gid</b>, <b>gname</b>, <b>indent</b>, <b>link</b>,
                       <b>md5</b>, <b>mode</b>, <b>nlink</b>, <b>rmd160</b>, <b>sha1</b>, <b>sha256</b>, <b>sha384</b>, <b>sha512</b>,  <b>size</b>,  <b>time</b>,  <b>uid</b>,  <b>uname</b>.   The
                       default  is  equivalent  to:  “device,  flags, gid, gname, link, mode, nlink, size, time,
                       type, uid, uname”.
               <b>mtree:all</b>
                       Enables all of the above keywords.  You can also use <b>mtree:!all</b> to disable all keywords.
               <b>mtree:use-set</b>
                       Enable generation of <b>/set</b> lines in the output.
               <b>mtree:indent</b>
                       Produce human-readable output by indenting options and splitting lines  to  fit  into  80
                       columns.
               <b>zip:compression</b>=<u>type</u>
                       Use  <u>type</u>  as  compression method.  Supported values are store (uncompressed) and deflate
                       (gzip algorithm).
               <b>zip:encryption</b>
                       Enable encryption using traditional zip encryption.
               <b>zip:encryption</b>=<u>type</u>
                       Use <u>type</u> as encryption type.  Supported values are zipcrypt (traditional zip encryption),
                       aes128 (WinZip AES-128 encryption) and aes256 (WinZip AES-256 encryption).
               <b>read_concatenated_archives</b>
                       Ignore zeroed blocks in the archive, which occurs when multiple tar  archives  have  been
                       concatenated  together.  Without this option, only the contents of the first concatenated
                       archive would be read.  This option is comparable to the <b>-i</b>, <b>--ignore-zeros</b> option of GNU
                       tar.
               If a provided option is not supported by any module, that is a fatal error.

       <b>-P</b>, <b>--absolute-paths</b>
               Preserve pathnames.  By default, absolute pathnames (those that begin with a  /  character)  have
               the  leading  slash removed both when creating archives and extracting from them.  Also, <b>tar</b> will
               refuse to extract archive entries whose pathnames contain <u>..</u> or whose target directory  would  be
               altered by a symlink.  This option suppresses these behaviors.

       <b>-p</b>, <b>--insecure</b>, <b>--preserve-permissions</b>
               (x mode only) Preserve file permissions.  Attempt to restore the full permissions, including file
               modes,  file  attributes or file flags, extended file attributes and ACLs, if available, for each
               item extracted from the archive.  This is the reverse of <b>--no-same-permissions</b> and the default if
               <b>tar</b> is being run as  root.   It  can  be  partially  overridden  by  also  specifying  <b>--no-acls</b>,
               <b>--no-fflags</b>, <b>--no-mac-metadata</b> or <b>--no-xattrs</b>.

       <b>--passphrase</b> <u>passphrase</u>
               The  <u>passphrase</u>  is  used  to extract or create an encrypted archive.  Currently, zip is the only
               supported format that supports encryption.  You shouldn't use this option unless you realize  how
               insecure use of this option is.

       <b>--posix</b>
               (c, r, u mode only) Synonym for <b>--format</b> <u>pax</u>

       <b>-q</b>, <b>--fast-read</b>
               (x  and  t  mode  only) Extract or list only the first archive entry that matches each pattern or
               filename operand.  Exit as soon as each specified pattern  or  filename  has  been  matched.   By
               default, the archive is always read to the very end, since there can be multiple entries with the
               same  name  and, by convention, later entries overwrite earlier entries.  This option is provided
               as a performance optimization.

       <b>--read-sparse</b>
               (c, r, u  modes  only)  Read  sparse  file  information  from  disk.   This  is  the  reverse  of
               <b>--no-read-sparse</b> and the default behavior.

       <b>-S</b>      (x mode only) Extract files as sparse files.  For every block on disk, check first if it contains
               only NULL bytes and seek over it otherwise.  This works similar to the conv=sparse option of dd.

       <b>-s</b> <u>pattern</u>
               Modify  file  or  archive  member  names  according  to  <u>pattern</u>.   The  pattern  has  the format
               <u>/old/new/</u>[bghHprRsS] where <u>old</u> is a basic regular expression, <u>new</u> is the  replacement  string  of
               the  matched  part,  and the optional trailing letters modify how the replacement is handled.  If
               <u>old</u> is not matched, the pattern is skipped.  Within <u>new</u>, ~ is substituted with the match,  \1  to
               \9  with the content of the corresponding captured group.  The optional trailing g specifies that
               matching should continue after the matched part and stop on the  first  unmatched  pattern.   The
               optional  trailing  s  specifies  that  the  pattern applies to the value of symbolic links.  The
               optional trailing p specifies that after a successful substitution the original path name and the
               new path name should be printed to standard error.  The optional trailing b  specifies  that  the
               substitution  should be matched from the beginning of the string rather than from right after the
               position at which the previous matching  substitution  ended.   Optional  trailing  H,  R,  or  S
               characters  suppress  substitutions  for hardlink targets, regular filenames, or symlink targets,
               respectively.  Optional trailing h, r, or s characters enable substitutions for hardlink targets,
               regular  filenames,  or  symlink  targets,  respectively.   The  default  is  <u>hrs</u>  which  applies
               substitutions to all names.  In particular, it is never necessary to specify h, r, or s.

       <b>--safe-writes</b>
               (x  mode  only) Extract files atomically.  By default <b>tar</b> unlinks the original file with the same
               name as the extracted file (if it exists), and then creates it immediately under  the  same  name
               and  writes  to it.  For a short period of time, applications trying to access the file might not
               find it, or see incomplete results.  If <b>--safe-writes</b> is enabled,  <b>tar</b>  first  creates  a  unique
               temporary  file,  then  writes  the  new  contents to the temporary file, and finally renames the
               temporary file to its final name atomically using <u><a href="../man2/rename.2.html">rename</a></u>(2).  This guarantees that an application
               accessing the file, will either see the old contents or the new contents at all times.

       <b>--same-owner</b>
               (x mode only) Extract owner and group IDs.  This  is  the  reverse  of  <b>--no-same-owner</b>  and  the
               default behavior if <b>tar</b> is run as root.

       <b>--strip-components</b> <u>count</u>
               Remove  the  specified  number  of  leading path elements.  Pathnames with fewer elements will be
               silently skipped.  Note that the pathname is edited after checking  inclusion/exclusion  patterns
               but before security checks.

       <b>-T</b> <u>filename</u>, <b>--files-from</b> <u>filename</u>
               In  x  or  t mode, <b>tar</b> will read the list of names to be extracted from <u>filename</u>.  In c mode, <b>tar</b>
               will read names to be archived from <u>filename</u>.  The special name “-C” on a  line  by  itself  will
               cause  the  current  directory  to  be  changed to the directory specified on the following line.
               Names are terminated by newlines unless <b>--null</b> is specified.  Note that <b>--null</b> also disables  the
               special  handling  of  lines  containing “-C”.  Note:  If you are generating lists of files using
               <u><a href="../man1/find.1.html">find</a></u>(1), you probably want to use <b>-n</b> as well.

       <b>--totals</b>
               (c, r, u modes only) After archiving all files, print a summary to stderr.

       <b>-U</b>, <b>--unlink</b>, <b>--unlink-first</b>
               (x mode only) Unlink files before creating them.  This can be a minor performance optimization if
               most files already exist, but can make things slower if most files do not  already  exist.   This
               flag also causes <b>tar</b> to remove intervening directory symlinks instead of reporting an error.  See
               the SECURITY section below for more details.

       <b>--uid</b> <u>id</u>
               Use the provided user id number and ignore the user name from the archive.  On create, if <b>--uname</b>
               is not also specified, the user name will be set to match the user id.

       <b>--uname</b> <u>name</u>
               Use  the  provided  user  name.   On extract, this overrides the user name in the archive; if the
               provided user name does not exist on the system, it will be ignored and the  user  id  (from  the
               archive  or from the <b>--uid</b> option) will be used instead.  On create, this sets the user name that
               will be stored in the archive; the name is not verified against the system user database.

       <b>--use-compress-program</b> <u>program</u>
               Pipe the input (in x or t mode) or the output (in c mode) through <u>program</u> instead  of  using  the
               builtin compression support.

       <b>--owner</b> <u>name</u>[:<u>uid</u>]
               Use the provided user, if <u>uid</u> is not provided, <u>name</u> can be either an username or numeric id.  See
               the <b>--uname</b> option for details.

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b>
               Produce  verbose output.  In create and extract modes, <b>tar</b> will list each file name as it is read
               from or written to the archive.  In list mode, <b>tar</b> will produce output similar to that of  <u><a href="../man1/ls.1.html">ls</a></u>(1).
               An additional <b>-v</b> option will also provide ls-like details in create and extract mode.

       <b>--version</b>
               Print version of <b>tar</b> and <b>libarchive</b>, and exit.

       <b>-w</b>, <b>--confirmation</b>, <b>--interactive</b>
               Ask for confirmation for every action.

       <b>-X</b> <u>filename</u>, <b>--exclude-from</b> <u>filename</u>
               Read  a  list  of exclusion patterns from the specified file.  See <b>--exclude</b> for more information
               about the handling of exclusions.

       <b>--xattrs</b>
               (c, r, u, x modes only) Archive or extract extended file attributes.   This  is  the  reverse  of
               <b>--no-xattrs</b> and the default behavior in c, r, and u modes or if <b>tar</b> is run in x mode as root.

       <b>-y</b>      (c  mode  only)  Compress  the  resulting  archive with <u><a href="../man1/bzip2.1.html">bzip2</a></u>(1).  In extract or list modes, this
               option is ignored.  Note that this <b>tar</b> implementation recognizes bzip2 compression  automatically
               when reading archives.

       <b>-Z</b>, <b>--compress</b>, <b>--uncompress</b>
               (c  mode  only)  Compress the resulting archive with <u><a href="../man1/compress.1.html">compress</a></u>(1).  In extract or list modes, this
               option  is  ignored.   Note  that  this  <b>tar</b>  implementation  recognizes   compress   compression
               automatically when reading archives.

       <b>-z</b>, <b>--gunzip</b>, <b>--gzip</b>
               (c mode only) Compress the resulting archive with <u><a href="../man1/gzip.1.html">gzip</a></u>(1).  In extract or list modes, this option
               is  ignored.   Note  that  this <b>tar</b> implementation recognizes gzip compression automatically when
               reading archives.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       The following environment variables affect the execution of <b>tar</b>:

       TAR_READER_OPTIONS
               The default options for format readers and compression readers.  The <b>--options</b>  option  overrides
               this.

       TAR_WRITER_OPTIONS
               The  default  options for format writers and compression writers.  The <b>--options</b> option overrides
               this.

       LANG    The locale to use.  See <u><a href="../man7/environ.7.html">environ</a></u>(7) for more information.

       TAPE    The default device.  The <b>-f</b> option overrides this.  Please see the description of the  <b>-f</b>  option
               above for more details.

       TZ      The timezone to use when displaying dates.  See <u><a href="../man7/environ.7.html">environ</a></u>(7) for more information.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>tar</b> utility exits 0 on success, and &gt;0 if an error occurs.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       The following creates a new archive called <u>file.tar.gz</u> that contains two files <u>source.c</u> and <u>source.h</u>:
             <b>tar</b> <b>-czf</b> <u>file.tar.gz</u> <u>source.c</u> <u>source.h</u>

       To view a detailed table of contents for this archive:
             <b>tar</b> <b>-tvf</b> <u>file.tar.gz</u>

       To extract all entries from the archive on the default tape drive:
             <b>tar</b> <b>-x</b>

       To examine the contents of an ISO 9660 cdrom image:
             <b>tar</b> <b>-tf</b> <u>image.iso</u>

       To move file hierarchies, invoke <b>tar</b> as
             <b>tar</b> <b>-cf</b> <u>-</u> <b>-C</b> <u>srcdir</u> <u>.</u> | <b>tar</b> <b>-xpf</b> <u>-</u> <b>-C</b> <u>destdir</u>
       or more traditionally
             <b>cd</b> <b>srcdir</b> <b>;</b> <b>tar</b> <b>-cf</b> <u>-</u> <u>.</u> | (<u>cd</u> <u>destdir</u> <u>;</u> <b>tar</b> <b>-xpf</b> <u>-</u>)

       In  create  mode,  the  list  of  files  and directories to be archived can also include directory change
       instructions of the form <b>-C</b><u>foo/baz</u> and archive inclusions of the form <b>@</b><u>archive-file</u>.   For  example,  the
       command line
             <b>tar</b> <b>-c</b> <b>-f</b> <u>new.tar</u> <u>foo1</u> <b>@</b><u>old.tgz</u> <b>-C</b><u><a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a></u> <u>foo2</u>
       will  create a new archive <u>new.tar</u>.  <b>tar</b> will read the file <u>foo1</u> from the current directory and add it to
       the output archive.  It will then read each entry from <u>old.tgz</u>  and  add  those  entries  to  the  output
       archive.  Finally, it will switch to the <u><a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a></u> directory and add <u>foo2</u> to the output archive.

       An  input  file  in  <u><a href="../man5/mtree.5.html">mtree</a></u>(5)  format  can  be used to create an output archive with arbitrary ownership,
       permissions, or names that differ from existing data on disk:

             $ cat input.mtree
             #mtree
             usr/bin uid=0 gid=0 mode=0755 type=dir
             usr/bin/ls uid=0 gid=0 mode=0755 type=file content=myls
             $ tar -cvf output.tar @input.mtree

       The <b>--newer</b> and <b>--newer-mtime</b> switches accept a variety of common date and time specifications, including
       “12 Mar 2005 7:14:29pm”, “2005-03-12 19:14”, “5 minutes ago”, and “19:14 PST May 1”.

       The <b>--options</b> argument can be used to control various details of  archive  generation  or  reading.   For
       example, you can generate mtree output which only contains <b>type</b>, <b>time</b>, and <b>uid</b> keywords:
             <b>tar</b> <b>-cf</b> <u>file.tar</u> <b>--format=mtree</b> <b>--options='!all,type,time,uid'</b> <u>dir</u>
       or you can set the compression level used by gzip or xz compression:
             <b>tar</b> <b>-czf</b> <u>file.tar</u> <b>--options='compression-level=9'</b>.
       For  more  details, see the explanation of the <b>archive_read_set_options</b>() and <b>archive_write_set_options</b>()
       API calls that are described in <u><a href="../man3/archive_read.3.html">archive_read</a></u>(3) and <u><a href="../man3/archive_write.3.html">archive_write</a></u>(3).

</pre><h4><b>COMPATIBILITY</b></h4><pre>
       The bundled-arguments format is supported for compatibility with historic implementations.   It  consists
       of  an initial word (with no leading - character) in which each character indicates an option.  Arguments
       follow as separate words.  The order  of  the  arguments  must  match  the  order  of  the  corresponding
       characters in the bundled command word.  For example,
             <b>tar</b> <b>tbf</b> <b>32</b> <u>file.tar</u>
       specifies  three  flags  <b>t</b>,  <b>b</b>,  and  <b>f</b>.   The <b>b</b> and <b>f</b> flags both require arguments, so there must be two
       additional items on the command line.  The <u>32</u> is the argument to the <b>b</b> flag, and <u>file.tar</u> is the argument
       to the <b>f</b> flag.

       The mode options c, r, t, u, and x and the options b, f, l, m, o, v, and w comply with SUSv2.

       For maximum portability, scripts that invoke <b>tar</b> should use the  bundled-argument  format  above,  should
       limit themselves to the <b>c</b>, <b>t</b>, and <b>x</b> modes, and the <b>b</b>, <b>f</b>, <b>m</b>, <b>v</b>, and <b>w</b> options.

       Additional long options are provided to improve compatibility with other tar implementations.

</pre><h4><b>SECURITY</b></h4><pre>
       Certain  security issues are common to many archiving programs, including <b>tar</b>.  In particular, carefully-
       crafted archives can request that <b>tar</b> extract files to locations outside of the target  directory.   This
       can potentially be used to cause unwitting users to overwrite files they did not intend to overwrite.  If
       the  archive  is being extracted by the superuser, any file on the system can potentially be overwritten.
       There are three ways this can happen.  Although <b>tar</b> has mechanisms to protect  against  each  one,  savvy
       users should be aware of the implications:

       <b>•</b>       Archive  entries  can  have  absolute pathnames.  By default, <b>tar</b> removes the leading <u>/</u> character
               from filenames before restoring them to guard against this problem.

       <b>•</b>       Archive entries can have pathnames that include <u>..</u> components.  By default, <b>tar</b> will not  extract
               files containing <u>..</u> components in their pathname.

       <b>•</b>       Archive entries can exploit symbolic links to restore files to other directories.  An archive can
               restore  a  symbolic  link  to  another directory, then use that link to restore a file into that
               directory.  To guard against this, <b>tar</b> checks each extracted path for  symlinks.   If  the  final
               path  element  is  a  symlink,  it will be removed and replaced with the archive entry.  If <b>-U</b> is
               specified, any intermediate symlink will also be unconditionally removed.  If neither <b>-U</b>  nor  <b>-P</b>
               is specified, <b>tar</b> will refuse to extract the entry.
       To  protect  yourself,  you  should be wary of any archives that come from untrusted sources.  You should
       examine the contents of an archive with
             <b>tar</b> <b>-tf</b> <u>filename</u>
       before extraction.  You should use the <b>-k</b> option to ensure that <b>tar</b> will not overwrite any existing files
       or the <b>-U</b> option to remove any pre-existing files.  You  should  generally  not  extract  archives  while
       running  with  super-user  privileges.  Note that the <b>-P</b> option to <b>tar</b> disables the security checks above
       and allows you to extract an archive while preserving any absolute pathnames, <u>..</u> components, or  symlinks
       to other directories.

</pre><h4><b>STANDARDS</b></h4><pre>
       There is no current POSIX standard for the tar command; it appeared in  ISO/IEC  9945-1:1996  (“POSIX.1”)
       but was dropped from IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 (“POSIX.1”).  The options supported by this implementation were
       developed  by  surveying  a number of existing tar implementations as well as the old POSIX specification
       for tar and the current POSIX specification for pax.

       The ustar and pax interchange file formats are defined by IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 (“POSIX.1”)  for  the  pax
       command.

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       A  <b>tar</b>  command  appeared  in Seventh Edition Unix, which was released in January, 1979.  There have been
       numerous other implementations, many of which extended the file format.   John  Gilmore's  <b>pdtar</b>  public-
       domain implementation (circa November, 1987) was quite influential, and formed the basis of GNU tar.  GNU
       tar was included as the standard system tar in FreeBSD beginning with FreeBSD 1.0.

       This  is  a  complete  re-implementation  based on the <u><a href="../man3/libarchive.3.html">libarchive</a></u>(3) library.  It was first released with
       FreeBSD 5.4 in May, 2005.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       This program follows ISO/IEC 9945-1:1996 (“POSIX.1”) for the definition of the <b>-l</b> option.  Note that  GNU
       tar prior to version 1.15 treated <b>-l</b> as a synonym for the <b>--one-file-system</b> option.

       The <b>-C</b> <u>dir</u> option may differ from historic implementations.

       All archive output is written in correctly-sized blocks, even if the output is being compressed.  Whether
       or not the last output block is padded to a full block size varies depending on the format and the output
       device.   For tar and cpio formats, the last block of output is padded to a full block size if the output
       is being written to standard output or to a character or block device such  as  a  tape  drive.   If  the
       output  is  being  written  to  a  regular  file,  the  last block will not be padded.  Many compressors,
       including <u><a href="../man1/gzip.1.html">gzip</a></u>(1) and <u><a href="../man1/bzip2.1.html">bzip2</a></u>(1), complain about the null padding when decompressing an archive created  by
       <b>tar</b>, although they still extract it correctly.

       The  compression  and  decompression is implemented internally, so there may be insignificant differences
       between the compressed output generated by
             <b>tar</b> <b>-czf</b> <u>-</u> <u>file</u>
       and that generated by
             <b>tar</b> <b>-cf</b> <u>-</u> <u>file</u> | <b>gzip</b>

       The default should be to read and write archives to the standard I/O paths,  but  tradition  (and  POSIX)
       dictates otherwise.

       The  <b>r</b> and <b>u</b> modes require that the archive be uncompressed and located in a regular file on disk.  Other
       archives can be modified using <b>c</b> mode with the <u>@archive-file</u> extension.

       To archive a file called <u>@foo</u> or <u>-foo</u> you must specify it as <u>./@foo</u> or <u>./-foo</u>, respectively.

       In create mode, a leading <u>./</u> is always removed.  A  leading  <u>/</u>  is  stripped  unless  the  <b>-P</b>  option  is
       specified.

       There needs to be better support for file selection on both create and extract.

       There is not yet any support for multi-volume archives.

       Converting  between  dissimilar  archive formats (such as tar and cpio) using the <b>@</b><u>-</u> convention can cause
       hard link information to be lost.  (This is a consequence of the incompatible ways that different archive
       formats store hardlink information.)
