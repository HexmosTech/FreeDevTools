</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Galvani -  a program for plotting and evaluating measurement data

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>galvani</b> [<u>options</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Galvani</b>  reads  measurement  data  of  digital  multimeters  from  a  serial  interface. Data are plotted
       graphically in a diagram. Two channels are available, therefore 2 devices can be used in parallel.

       Several mathematical <b>transformations</b> are available for data evaluation:
       • Inverse (1/x)
       • Logarithm
       • Conversion of a Copper/Constantan- or Nickel/Chromnickel-thermocouple voltage to temperature difference
       • Conversion of timeline to volumina (for titrations)

       There are some <b>mathematical</b> <b>operations</b> available for evaluation of graphs:
       • Differential function
       • Integration of peak area in Chromatograms including tabulation
       • Linear regression of data

       Diagrams can be exported into several file formats (PNG, SVG, EPS) or printed as report.

       Additionally, measurement data can be  <b>simulated</b>  (in combination with random variables) as:
       • Linear function
       • Exponential function (decay curve)
       • Chromatogram

       • Titration curve

</pre><h4><b>SETTINGS</b></h4><pre>
       The appearance of diagrams can be controlled in several options. Data  points  can  be  shown  as  cross,
       circle, square or diamond and/or can be interpolated by lines or curves.

       All  settings  for  serial  communication  with the device can be saved as files. For some devices, there
       exist already configuration files from which settings can be read.  Also,  setting  measurement  function
       remotely is possible if the device has this option.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>$(HOME)/galvani</b>
           Device specific settings are saved as files in this folder.

       <b>$(HOME)/galvani/data</b>
           This  folder contains the data files (.dat) produced by galvani and graphical data (.png, .svg, .eps)
           exported by the program. Alternatively other folders can be chosen for saving data files.

       <b>$(HOME)/.galvani</b>
           In this hidden folder galvani saves the file galvani.ini  holding  information  for  autoloading  and
           autosaving program settings and the configuration file galvani.conf in which all program settings are
           saved and can be read at program start.

       <b>/tmp/galvani</b>
           Folder for temporary files.
