</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       wn - command line interface to WordNet lexical database

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>wn</b> [ <u>searchstr</u> ] [ <b>-h</b>] [ <b>-g</b> ] [ <b>-a</b> ] [ <b>-l</b> ] [ <b>-o</b> ] [ <b>-s</b> ] [ <b>-n</b><u>#</u> ] [ <u>search_option</u>... ]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>wn()</b>  provides  a  command  line  interface to the WordNet database, allowing synsets and relations to be
       displayed as formatted text.  For each word, different searches are provided, based on syntactic category
       and pointer types.  Although only base forms of words are usually stored in WordNet, users may search for
       inflected forms.  A morphological process is applied to the search string to  generate  a  form  that  is
       present in WordNet.

       The  command  line interface is often useful when writing scripts to extract information from the WordNet
       database.  Post-processing of the output with  various  scripting  tools  can  reformat  the  results  as
       desired.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-h</b>             Print help text before search results.

       <b>-g</b>             Display textual glosses associated with synsets.

       <b>-a</b>             Display lexicographer file information.

       <b>-o</b>             Display synset offset of each synset.

       <b>-s</b>             Display each word's sense numbers in synsets.

       <b>-l</b>             Display the WordNet copyright notice, version number, and license.

       <b>-n</b><u>#</u>            Perform search on sense number <u>#</u> only.

       <b>-over</b>          Display overview of all senses of <u>searchstr</u> in all syntactic categories.

   <b>Search</b> <b>Options</b>
       Note  that  the last letter of <u>search_option</u> generally denotes the part of speech that the search applies
       to: <b>n</b> for nouns, <b>v</b> for verbs, <b>a</b> for adjectives, and <b>r</b> for adverbs.  Multiple searches  may  be  done  for
       <u>searchstr</u> with a single command by specifying all the appropriate search options.

       <b>-syns</b>(<u>n</u> | <u>v</u> | <u>a</u> | <u>r</u>)
                      Display  synonyms  and  immediate  hypernyms of synsets containing <u>searchstr</u>.  Synsets are
                      ordered by estimated frequency of use.  For adjectives, if <u>searchstr</u> is in a head  synset,
                      the cluster's satellite synsets are displayed in place of hypernyms.  If <u>searchstr</u> is in a
                      satellite synset, its head synset is also displayed.

       <b>-simsv</b>         Display  verb  synonyms  and immediate hypernyms of synsets containing <u>searchstr</u>.  Synsets
                      are grouped by similarity of meaning.

       <b>-ants</b>(<u>n</u> | <u>v</u> | <u>a</u> | <u>r</u>)
                      Display synsets containing antonyms of <u>searchstr</u>.  For adjectives, if <u>searchstr</u>  is  in  a
                      head  synset,  <u>searchstr</u>  has a direct antonym.  The head synset for the direct antonym is
                      displayed along with the direct  antonym's  satellite  synsets.   If  <u>searchstr</u>  is  in  a
                      satellite  synset,  <u>searchstr</u>  has  an  indirect  antonym  via  the  head synset, which is
                      displayed.

       <b>-faml</b>(<u>n</u> | <u>v</u> | <u>a</u> | <u>r</u>)
                      Display familiarity and polysemy information for <u>searchstr</u>.

       <b>-hype</b>(<u>n</u> | <u>v</u>)   Recursively display hypernym (superordinate) tree for <u>searchstr</u> (<u>searchstr</u> <u>IS</u>  <u>A</u>  <u>KIND</u>  <u>OF</u>
                      <b>_____</b> relation).

       <b>-hypo</b>(<u>n</u> | <u>v</u>)   Display  immediate  hyponyms  (subordinates)  for  <u>searchstr</u> (<b>_____</b> <u>IS</u> <u>A</u> <u>KIND</u> <u>OF</u> <u>searchstr</u>
                      relation).

       <b>-tree</b>(<u>n</u> | <u>v</u>)   Display hyponym (subordinate) tree for <u>searchstr</u>.  This is a recursive search  that  finds
                      the hyponyms of each hyponym.

       <b>-coor</b>(<u>n</u> | <u>v</u>)   Display the coordinates (sisters) of <u>searchstr</u>.  This search prints the immediate hypernym
                      for each synset that contains <u>searchstr</u> and the hypernym's immediate hyponyms.

       <b>-deri</b>(<u>n</u> | <u>v</u>)   Display derivational morphology links between noun and verb forms.

       <b>-domn</b>(<u>n</u> | <u>v</u> | <u>a</u> | <u>r</u>)
                      Display domain that <u>searchstr</u> has been classified in.

       <b>-domt</b>(<u>n</u> | <u>v</u> | <u>a</u> | <u>r</u>)
                      Display all terms classified as members of the <u>searchstr</u>'s domain.

       <b>-subsn</b>         Display substance meronyms of <u>searchstr</u> (<u>HAS</u> <u>SUBSTANCE</u> relation).

       <b>-partn</b>         Display part meronyms of <u>searchstr</u> (<u>HAS</u> <u>PART</u> relation).

       <b>-membn</b>         Display member meronyms of <u>searchstr</u> (<u>HAS</u> <u>MEMBER</u> relation).

       <b>-meron</b>         Display all meronyms of <u>searchstr</u> (<u>HAS</u> <u>PART,</u> <u>HAS</u> <u>MEMBER,</u> <u>HAS</u> <u>SUBSTANCE</u> relations).

       <b>-hmern</b>         Display  meronyms  for  <u>searchstr</u>  tree.   This  is a recursive search that prints all the
                      meronyms of <u>searchstr</u> and all of its hypernyms.

       <b>-sprtn</b>         Display <u>part</u> <u>of</u> holonyms of <u>searchstr</u> (<u>PART</u> <u>OF</u> relation).

       <b>-smemn</b>         Display <u>member</u> <u>of</u> holonyms of <u>searchstr</u> (<u>MEMBER</u> <u>OF</u> relation).

       <b>-ssubn</b>         Display <u>substance</u> <u>of</u> holonyms of <u>searchstr</u> (<u>SUBSTANCE</u> <u>OF</u> relation).

       <b>-holon</b>         Display all holonyms of <u>searchstr</u> (<u>PART</u> <u>OF,</u> <u>MEMBER</u> <u>OF,</u> <u>SUBSTANCE</u> <u>OF</u> relations).

       <b>-hholn</b>         Display holonyms for <u>searchstr</u> tree.  This is a  recursive  search  that  prints  all  the
                      holonyms of <u>searchstr</u> and all of each holonym's holonyms.

       <b>-entav</b>         Display entailment relations of <u>searchstr</u>.

        <b>-pert</b>(<u>a</u> | <u>r</u>)  Display pertainyms of <u>searchstr</u>.

        <b>-attr</b>(<u>n</u> | <u>a</u>)  Display adjective values for noun attribute, or noun attributes of adjective values.

       <b>-grep</b>(<u>n</u> | <u>v</u> | <u>a</u> | <u>r</u>)
                      List compound words containing <u>searchstr</u> as a substring.

</pre><h4><b>SEARCH</b> <b>RESULTS</b></h4><pre>
       The  results  of a search are written to the standard output.  For each search, the output consists a one
       line description of the search, followed by the search results.

       All searches other than <b>-over</b> list all senses matching  the  search  results  in  the  following  general
       format.  Items enclosed in italicized square brackets (<u>[</u> <u>...</u> <u>]</u>) may not be present.

              One line listing the number of senses matching the search request.

              Each sense matching the search requested displayed as follows:

                   <b>Sense</b> <u>n</u>
                   <u>[</u><b>{</b><u>synset_offset</u><b>}</b><u>]</u> <u>[</u><b>&lt;</b><u>lex_filename</u><b>&gt;</b><u>]</u>  <u>word1[</u><b>#</b><u>sense_number][,</u>  <u>word2...]</u>

              Where  <u>n</u> is the sense number of the search word, <u>synset_offset</u> is the byte offset of the synset in
              the <b>data.</b><u>pos</u> file corresponding to the  syntactic  category,  <u>lex_filename</u>  is  the  name  of  the
              lexicographer  file  that  the synset comes from, <u>word1</u> is the first word in the synset (note that
              this is not necessarily the search word) and <u>sense_number</u> is the WordNet sense number assigned  to
              the  preceding word.  <u>synset_offset,</u> <u>lex_filename</u>, and <u>sense_number</u> are generated when the <b>-o,</b> <b>-a,</b>
              and <b>-s</b> options, respectively, are specified.

              The synsets matching the search requested are printed below each sense's synset  output  described
              above.   Each  line  of  output  is preceded by a marker (usually <b>=&gt;</b>), then a synset, formatted as
              described above.  If a search traverses more one level of the  tree,  then  successive  lines  are
              indented  by spaces corresponding to its level in the hierarchy.  When the <b>-g</b> option is specified,
              synset glosses are displayed in parentheses at the end of each synset.  Each synset is printed  on
              one line.

              Senses  are  generally  ordered  from  most  to  least frequently used, with the most common sense
              numbered <b>1</b>.  Frequency of use is determined by the number of  times  a  sense  is  tagged  in  the
              various  semantic  concordance  texts.  Senses that are not semantically tagged follow the ordered
              senses.  Note that this ordering is only an estimate based on usage in a small corpus.

              Verb senses can be grouped by similarity of meaning, rather than ordered by frequency of use.  The
              <b>-simsv</b> search prints all senses that are  close  in  meaning  together,  with  a  line  of  dashes
              indicating the end of a group.  See <b><a href="../man7WN/wngroups.7WN.html">wngroups</a></b>(7WN) for a discussion of how senses are grouped.

              The  <b>-over</b>  search  displays  an  overview  of  all the senses of the search word in all syntactic
              categories.  The results of this search are similar to the <b>-syns</b>  search,  however  no  additional
              (ex.  hypernym)  synsets  are  displayed,  and  synset glosses are always printed.  The senses are
              grouped by syntactic category, and each synset is annotated as described above with <u>synset_offset</u>,
              <u>lex_filename</u>, and <u>sense_number</u> as dictated by the <b>-o,</b> <b>-a,</b> and <b>-s</b>  options.   The  overview  search
              also  indicates  how  many  of the senses in each syntactic category are represented in the tagged
              texts.  This is a way for the user to determine  whether  a  sense's  sense  number  is  based  on
              semantic  tagging  data,  or  was arbitrarily assigned.   For each sense that has appeared in such
              texts, the number of semantic tags to that sense are indicated  in  parentheses  after  the  sense
              number.

              If  a  search  cannot be performed on some senses of <u>searchstr</u>, the search results are headed by a
              string of the form:
                   X of Y senses of <u>searchstr</u>

              The output of the <b>-deri</b> search shows word forms that are  morphologically  related  to  <b>searchstr</b>.
              Each  word form pointed to from <u>searchstr</u> is displayed, preceded by <b>RELATED</b> <b>TO-&gt;</b> and the syntactic
              category of the link, followed, on the next line, by its synset.  Printed after the word  form  is
              <b>#</b><u>n</u> where <u>n</u> indicates the WordNet sense number of the term pointed to.

              The <b>-domn</b> and <b>-domt</b> searches show the domain that a synset has been classified in and, conversely,
              all of the terms that have been assigned to a specific domain.  A domain is either a <b>TOPIC,</b> <b>REGION</b>
              or  <b>USAGE,</b> as reflected in the specific pointer character stored in the database, and displayed in
              the output.  A <b>-domn</b> search on a term shows the  domain,  if  any,  that  each  synset  containing
              <u>searchstr</u>  has  been  classified  in.   The output display shows the domain type (<b>TOPIC,</b> <b>REGION</b> or
              <b>USAGE</b>), followed by the syntactic category of the domain synset and the terms in the synset.  Each
              term is followed by <b>#</b><u>n</u> where <u>n</u> indicates the WordNet sense  number  of  the  term.   The  converse
              search,  <b>-domt</b>,  shows  all  of  the synsets that have been placed into the domain <u>searchstr</u>, with
              analogous markers.

              When <b>-framv</b> is specified, sample illustrative sentences and generic sentence frames are displayed.
              If a sample sentence is found, the base form of <u>search</u> is substituted into the sentence, and it is
              printed below the synset, preceded with the <b>EX:</b> marker.  When no sample sentences are  found,  the
              generic  sentence  frames  are  displayed.  Sentence frames that are acceptable for all words in a
              synset are preceded by the marker <b>*&gt;</b>.  If a frame is acceptable for the search word  only,  it  is
              preceded by the marker <b>=&gt;</b>.

              Search  results  for adjectives are slightly different from those for other parts of speech.  When
              an adjective is printed, its direct antonym, if it has one, is also printed in parentheses.   When
              <u>searchstr</u>  is  in  a  head  synset,  all  of the head synset's satellites are also displayed.  The
              position of an adjective in relation to the noun may be restricted to the <u>prenominal</u>,  <u>postnominal</u>
              or <u>predicative</u> position.  Where present, these restrictions are noted in parentheses.

              When  an  adjective  is  a  participle  of  a verb, the output indicates the verb and displays its
              synset.

              When an adverb is derived from an adjective, the specific adjectival sense on which it is based is
              indicated.

              The morphological transformations performed by the search code may result in more than one word to
              search for.  WordNet automatically performs the requested search on all of the strings and returns
              the results grouped by word.  For example, the verb <b>saw</b> is both the present tense of <b>saw</b>  and  the
              past  tense  of  <b>see</b>.  When passed <u>searchstr</u> <b>saw</b>, WordNet performs the desired search first on <b>saw</b>
              and next on <b>see</b>, returning the list of <b>saw</b> senses and search results, followed by those for <b>see</b>.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>wn()</b> normally exits with the number of senses displayed.  If <u>searchword</u> is not found in WordNet, it exits
       with <b>0</b>.

       If the WordNet database cannot be opened, an error messages is displayed and <b>wn()</b> exits with <b>-1</b>.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b> <b>(UNIX)</b></h4><pre>
       <b>WNHOME</b>              Base directory for WordNet.  Default is <b>/usr/local/WordNet-3.0</b>.
