       yaws - yet another webserver

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>yaws</b> [<u>OPTIONS</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Yaws  is  fast lightweight webserver. It can run as daemon or in interactive mode where it is possible to
       directly interact with the webserver. Yaws is particularly good at generating dynamic  content.  See  the
       user docs for more information on that topic.

</pre><h4><b>DAEMON/SERVER</b> <b>options</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-i</b> <b>|</b> <b>--interactive</b>
              Interactive mode. This will start yaws in interactive mode with an erlang prompt. All error_logger
              messages will be written to the tty as well in this mode. Use this when developing yaws code.

       <b>-w</b> <b>|</b> <b>--winteractive</b>
              Cygwin inteactive mode (werl)

       <b>-D</b> <b>|</b> <b>--daemon</b>
              Daemon mode. This will start yaws as a daemon.

       <b>--heart</b>
              This will cause the yaws system to be automatically restarted in case it should crash. This switch
              also requires the <u>--daemon</u> switch to be present.

       <b>--heart-restart=C,T</b>
              This  controls  the number of restarts in a given time period that heart tolerates before refusing
              to restart Yaws. By default, heart allows up to 5  restarts  within  a  60  second  period  before
              refusing to restart Yaws again. This option allows up to <u>C</u> restarts in <u>T</u> seconds instead. To allow
              infinite restarts, set both <u>C</u> and <u>T</u> to 0. This switch automatically enables the <u>--heart</u> switch.

       <b>--debug</b>
              Debug  mode. This will produce some auxiliary error output for some error conditions. It will also
              start the otp sasl lib for additional error printouts.

       <b>--nodebug</b>
              Non-debug mode. This is useful for running interactively via the -i option but  without  incurring
              the performance penalties of debug mode.

       <b>--conf</b> <b>file</b>
              Use a different configuration file than the default. If the configuration parameter <u>config</u> is set,
              yaws  use  it  as default configuration file. Else, The default configuration file when running as
              root is /etc/yaws/yaws.conf. When running as a non priviliged  user,  yaws  will  search  for  its
              configuration  file  in  the  following  order.  First in $HOME/yaws.conf, then in ./yaws.conf and
              finally in /etc/yaws/yaws.conf.

       <b>--runmod</b> <b>module</b>
              Tells yaws to call <u>module:start/0</u> at startup. This makes it  possible  to  startup  user  specific
              applications together with yaws.

       <b>--pa</b> <b>path</b>
              Add path to the yaws system search path

       <b>--tracetraf</b>
              Traffic  trace  mode.  All traffic will be written to a trace file called trace.traffic in the log
              directory.

       <b>--tracehttp</b>
              HTTP trace mode. All HTTP messages will be written to a trace file called trace.http  in  the  log
              directory.

       <b>--traceout</b>
              When  yaws  is  put into trace mode using either --tracetraf or --tracehttp, traces are written to
              files. If we provide the --traceout flag, the trace will also be written to stdout.

       <b>--trace</b>
              Sames as --tracetraf --traceout. I.e. trace everything and write to stdout.

       <b>--mnesiadir</b> <b>dir</b>
              Start Mnesia in directory &lt;dir&gt;

       <b>--sname</b> <b>xxx</b>
              Start yaws as a distributed erlang node with name &lt;xxx&gt; using the unqualified hostname as nodename
              postfix

       <b>--disable-kpoll</b>
              By default, yaws starts erlang with <u>+K</u> <u>true</u>. This flag reverses that.

       <b>--name</b> <b>xxx</b>
              Start yaws as a distributed erlang node with name &lt;xxx&gt; using  the  fully  qualified  hostname  as
              nodename postfix

       <b>--proto_dist</b> <b>Mod</b>
              Use  module  Mod  for  erlang distribution. This is typically only used when we want to run erlang
              distribution over SSL.

       <b>--erlarg</b> <b>STRING</b>
              Pass STRING as an additional argument to the "erl" program. If STRING  comprises  multiple  words,
              you  must  quote  it so that your shell passes it to yaws as a single argument. If STRING contains
              any single quote characters, you must quote each of them as well. For example, to pass the  option
              <u>-env</u> <u>NAME</u> <u>O'Keeffe</u> to "erl" from a Bourne-compatible shell:

                                            --erlarg "-env NAME O\'Keeffe"

       <b>--id</b> <b>ID</b>
              This  flag  sets  the  id. If we're starting a daemon (or an interactive system) it gives the Yaws
              server the identity ID. This means that  the  server  will  write  all  internal  files  into  the
              directory $HOME/.yaws/yaws/ID.

              Yaws  also  creates a file called $HOME/.yaws/yaws/ID/CTL which contains the portnumber the daemon
              is listening on for control request by the control command such as "yaws --hup" etc.

              If we're invoking a control command which should perform some control function on the  daemon,  we
              may  have  to  give  the  --id  flag  also to the control command. If we don't do this the control
              command may interact with the wrong daemon due to finding the wrong "ctl" file.

              The daemon may also optionally specify the "id" in the yaws.conf configuration file.

       <b>--umask</b> <b>MASK</b>
              Set the umask for the daemon to MASK.

       <b>--encoding</b> <b>latin|unicode</b>
              Set the config file encoding (default: latin1).

</pre><h4><b>CONTROL</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The following list of options are are used to control the daemon from the "outside" while it is running.

       <b>--hup</b> <b>[--id</b> <b>ID]</b>
              HUP the daemon. This forces the daemon to reread the configuration file.  It also makes the daemon
              empty all its internal content caches.  Hence when updating the doc root, HUPing the daemon is the
              fastest way to see the content updates.

       <b>--stop</b> <b>[--id</b> <b>id]</b>
              Stop the daemon (called id)

       <b>--ls</b>   Lists current ids and status of all yaws servers on localhost.  In  practice  this  amounts  to  a
              listdir  in $HOME/.yaws/yaws - and check whether the different systems who has created files there
              are alive.

       <b>--status</b> <b>[--id</b> <b>id]</b>
              Query a running yaws daemon for its status, and print it.

       <b>--stats</b> <b>[--id</b> <b>id]</b>
              Query a running yaws daemon for its statistics, and print it.

       <b>--running-config</b> <b>[--id</b> <b>id]</b>
              Query a running yaws daemon for its current configuration, and print it.  This can be useful  when
              attempting  to figure out how to set config in embedded mode. Configure yaws to you liking in non-
              embedded mode, run this command and use the output to populate the embedded mode records.

       <b>--load</b> <b>Modules</b> <b>[--id</b> <b>id]</b>
              Try to (re)load erlang modules into a running daemon.  This is useful after modifying  appmods  or
              modules used by scripts.

       <b>--debug-dump</b>  <b>[--id</b> <b>id]</b>
              Produce  a  debug  dump  on  stdout.  In particular this code lists what we refer to as suspicious
              processes. I.e. processes that might be hanging or processes that are "large" - hardcoded  to  40k
              words.

       <b>--ctltrace</b> <b>[--id</b> <b>ID]</b> <b>http</b> <b>|</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>|</b> <b>off</b>
              Control  the  trace capabilities of a running yaws daemon. If the http or traffic option is given,
              the daemon will write a log for debug purposes into the logdir.

       <b>--wait-started[=T]</b> <b>[--id</b> <b>ID]</b>
              Waits at most 30 seconds for the server to start. Exits with 0 if server is running, 1  otherwise.
              Typically  useful  in  test scripts. The default 30 seconds can be modified by appending <u>=T</u> to the
              option, where <u>T</u> is the desired number of seconds to wait for the server to start.

</pre><h4><b>MISC</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--check</b> <b>YawsFile</b> <b>[IncDirs</b> <b>....]</b>
              Test compile a `.yaws' file. Useful in Makefiles when we want to ensure that all .yaws  files  are
              syntactically correct

       <b>--version</b>
              output version information and exit

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>HOME</b>   Is  used  to  determine  where  we  write  the temporary files. By default all tmp files end up in
              $HOME/.yaws. This includes the JIT files that are the result of processed .yaws files and also the
              so called control file that is used by the daemon  to  write  the  port  number  to  which  it  is
              listening for control commands such as "yaws --status"

              Thus  HOME  is  the handle we use in the control commands to find the control file so that we know
              where to connect to.

       <b>YAWSHOME</b>
              Can be used to override the HOME variable. This is useful when we for  example  are  running  yaws
              under port binding programs such as authpriv.

              It's useful by distros that don't want Yaws to write any files ever in the HOME directory of root.
