</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       readom - read or write data Compact Discs

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>readom</b> <b>dev=</b><u>device</u> [ <u>options</u> ]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Readom</b> is used to read or write Compact Discs.

       The <u>device</u> refers to a device location similar to the one used in the wodim command. Refer to its manpage
       for details.

       Also  note  that  this  version of readom uses a modified libusal library which has a different behaviour
       compared to the one distributed by its original author.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       If no options except the <u>dev=</u> option have been specified, <b>readom</b> goes into interactive  mode.   Select  a
       primary function and then follow the instructions.

       <b>-version</b>
              Print version information and exit.

       <b>dev=</b><u>target</u>
              Sets  the SCSI target for the drive, see notes above.  A typical device specification is <b>dev=</b><u>6,0</u> .
              If a filename must be provided together with the numerical target specification, the  filename  is
              implementation  specific.   The  correct filename in this case can be found in the system specific
              manuals of the target operating system.  On a <u>FreeBSD</u> system without <u>CAM</u> support, you need to  use
              the  control  device  (e.g.   <u>/dev/rcd0.ctl</u>).   A correct device specification in this case may be
              <b>dev=</b><u>/dev/rcd0.ctl:@</u> .

              On Linux, drives connected to a parallel port adapter are mapped to a virtual SCSI bus.  Different
              adapters are mapped to different targets on this virtual SCSI bus.

              If no <u>dev</u> option is present, <b>readom</b> will try to get the device from the <b>CDR_DEVICE</b> environment.

              If  the  argument  to  the <b>dev=</b> option does not contain the characters ',', '/', '@' or ':', it is
              interpreted as an label name that may be found in the file /etc/wodim.conf (see FILES section).

       <b>timeout=</b><u>#</u>
              Set the default SCSI command timeout value to <u>#</u> seconds.  The default SCSI command timeout is  the
              minimum timeout used for sending SCSI commands.  If a SCSI command fails due to a timeout, you may
              try  to  raise the default SCSI command timeout above the timeout value of the failed command.  If
              the command runs correctly with a raised command timeout, please report the better  timeout  value
              and  the  corresponding  command to the author of the program.  If no <u>timeout</u> option is present, a
              default timeout of 40 seconds is used.

       <b>debug=</b><u>#,</u> <b>-d</b>
              Set the misc debug value to # (with debug=#) or increment the misc debug level by one  (with  -d).
              If you specify <u>-dd,</u> this equals to <b>debug=</b><u>2.</u>  This may help to find problems while opening a driver
              for  libusal.  as well as with sector sizes and sector types.  Using <b>-debug</b> slows down the process
              and may be the reason for a buffer underrun.

       <b>kdebug=</b>#, <b>kd=</b>#
              Tell the <b>usal</b>-driver to modify the kernel debug value while SCSI commands are running.

       <b>-silent</b>, <b>-s</b>
              Do not print out a status report for failed SCSI commands.

       <b>-v</b>     Increment the level of general verbosity by one.  This is used e.g. to display the progress of the
              process.

       <b>-V</b>     Increment the verbose level with respect of SCSI command transport by one.  This  helps  to  debug
              problems  during  the  process,  that occur in the CD-Recorder.  If you get incomprehensible error
              messages you should use this flag to get more detailed output.  <b>-VV</b> will show data buffer  content
              in addition.  Using <b>-V</b> or <b>-VV</b> slows down the process.

       <b>f=</b><u>file</u> Specify  the  filename where the output should be written or the input should be taken from. Using
              '-' as filename will cause <b>readom</b> to use <b>stdout</b> resp. <b>stdin</b>.

       <b>-w</b>     Switch to write mode. If this option is not present, <b>readom</b> reads from the specified device.

       <b>-c2scan</b>
              Scans the whole CD or the range specified by the <b>sectors=</b><u>range</u> for C2 errors. C2 errors are errors
              that are uncorrectable after the second stage of the 24/28 + 28/32 Reed Solomon correction  system
              at  audio level (2352 bytes sector size). If an audio CD has C2 errors, interpolation is needed to
              hide the errors. If a data CD has C2 errors, these errors are  in  most  cases  corrected  by  the
              ECC/EDC  code  that  makes  2352  bytes out of 2048 data bytes. The ECC/EDC code should be able to
              correct about 100 C2 error bytes per sector.

              If you find C2 errors you may want to reduce the speed using the <b>speed=</b> option as C2 errors may be
              a result of dynamic unbalance on the medium.

       <b>-scanbus</b>
              Scan all SCSI devices on all SCSI busses and print the inquiry strings. This option may be used to
              find SCSI address of the devices on a system.  The numbers printed out as labels are computed  by:
              <b>bus</b> <b>*</b> <b>100</b> <b>+</b> <b>target</b>

       <b>sectors=</b><u>range</u>
              Specify a sector range that should be read.  The range is specified by the starting sector number,
              a  minus  sign  and  the  ending  sector  number.   The end sector is not included in the list, so
              <b>sectors=</b>0-0 will not read anything and may be used to check for a CD in the drive.

       <b>speed=</b>#
              Set the speed factor of the read or write process to #.  # is an integer, representing a  multiple
              of  the  audio  speed.   This is about 150 KB/s for CD-ROM and about 172 KB/s for CD-Audio.  If no
              <u>speed</u> option is present, <b>readom</b> will use maximum speed.  Only MMC compliant  drives  will  benefit
              from this option.  The speed of non MMC drives is not changed.

              Using a lower speed may increase the readability of a CD or DVD.

       <b>ts=</b>#   Set  the  maximum  transfer size for a single SCSI command to #.  The syntax for the <b>ts=</b> option is
              the same as for wodim fs=# or sdd bs=#.

              If no <b>ts=</b> option has been specified, <b>readom</b> defaults to a transfer size of 256 kB. If libusal gets
              lower values from the operating system, the value is reduced to the maximum value that is possible
              with the current operating system.  Sometimes, it may help to further reduce the transfer size  or
              to  enhance it, but note that it may take a long time to find a better value by experimenting with
              the <b>ts=</b> option.

       <b>-notrunc</b>
              Do not truncate the output file when opening it.

       <b>-fulltoc</b>
              Retrieve a full TOC from the current disk and print it in hex.

       <b>-clone</b> Do a clone read. Read the CD with all sub-channel data and a full TOC.  The full TOC data will  be
              put into a file with similar name as with the <b>f=</b> option but the suffix <b>.toc</b> added.

       <b>-noerror</b>
              Do  not  abort if the high level error checking in <b>readom</b> found an uncorrectable error in the data
              stream.

       <b>-nocorr</b>
              Switch the drive into a mode where it ignores read errors in data sectors that  are  a  result  of
              uncorrectable  ECC/EDC errors before reading.  If <b>readom</b> completes, the error recovery mode of the
              drive is switched back to the remembered old mode.

       <b>retries=</b><u>#</u>
              Set the retry count for high level retries in <b>readom</b> to <u>#</u>.  The default is to do 128 retries which
              may be too much if you like to read a CD with many unreadable sectors.

       <b>-overhead</b>
              Meter the SCSI command overhead time.  This is done by executing several commands 1000  times  and
              printing  the  total  time  used.  If  you divide the displayed times by 1000, you get the average
              overhead time for a single command.

       <b>meshpoints=</b>#
              Print read-speed at # locations.  The purpose of this option is to create a  list  of  read  speed
              values  suitable  for e.g.  <b>gnuplot</b>.  The speed values are calculated assuming that 1000 bytes are
              one kilobyte as documented in the SCSI standard.  The output data  created  for  this  purpose  is
              written to <u>stdout</u>.

       <b>-factor</b>
              Output  the  speed  values for <b>meshpoints=</b># as factor based on <u>single</u> <u>speed</u> of the current medium.
              This only works if <b>readom</b> is able to determine the current medium type.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       For all examples below, it will be assumed that the drive is connected to the primary  SCSI  bus  of  the
       machine. The SCSI target id is set to 2.

       To read the complete media from a CD-ROM writing the data to the file <u>cdimage.raw</u>:

           readom dev=2,0 f=cdimage.raw

       To read sectors from range 150 ... 10000 from a CD-ROM writing the data to the file <u>cdimage.raw</u>:

           readom dev=2,0 sectors=150-10000 f=cdimage.raw

       To  write  the  data  from  the file <u>cdimage.raw</u> (e.g. a filesystem image from <b>genisoimage</b>) to a DVD-RAM,
       call:

           readom dev=2,0 -w f=cdimage.raw

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>RSH</b>    If the <b>RSH</b> environment is present, the remote connection will not be created via  <b><a href="../man3/rcmd.3.html">rcmd</a></b>(3)  but  by
              calling  the  program  pointed  to  by  <b>RSH</b>.   Use e.g.  <b>RSH=</b><a href="file:///usr/lib/w3m/cgi-bin/w3mman2html.cgi?ssh">/usr/bin/ssh</a> to create a secure shell
              connection.

              Note that this forces <b>wodim</b> to create a pipe to the <b><a href="../man1/rsh.1.html">rsh</a>(1)</b> program and disallows <b>wodim</b> to directly
              access the network socket to the remote server.  This makes it impossible to  set  up  performance
              parameters and slows down the connection compared to a <b>root</b> initiated <b><a href="../man3/rcmd.3.html">rcmd</a>(3)</b> connection.

       <b>RSCSI</b>  If   the  <b>RSCSI</b>  environment  is  present,  the  remote  SCSI  server  will  not  be  the  program
              <b>/opt/schily/sbin/rscsi</b> but the program pointed to by <b>RSCSI</b>.  Note  that  the  remote  SCSI  server
              program  name  will  be ignored if you log in using an account that has been created with a remote
              SCSI server program as login shell.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       Unless you want to risk getting problems, <b>readom</b> should be run as root. If you don't want to allow  users
       to  become  root  on your system, <b>readom</b> may safely be installed suid root.  For more information see the
       additional notes of your system/program distribution or README.suidroot  which  is  part  of  the  Cdrkit
       source.

       Documentation of the <b>wodim</b> program contains more technical details which could also apply to <b>readom.</b>

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       A typical error message for a SCSI command looks like:

              readom: I/O error. test unit ready: scsi sendcmd: no error
              CDB:  00 20 00 00 00 00
              status: 0x2 (CHECK CONDITION)
              Sense Bytes: 70 00 05 00 00 00 00 0A 00 00 00 00 25 00 00 00 00 00
              Sense Key: 0x5 Illegal Request, Segment 0
              Sense Code: 0x25 Qual 0x00 (logical unit not supported) Fru 0x0
              Sense flags: Blk 0 (not valid)
              cmd finished after 0.002s timeout 40s

       The  first  line  gives  information  about the transport of the command.  The text after the first colon
       gives the error text for the system call from the view of the kernel. It usually  is:  <b>I/O</b>  <b>error</b>  unless
       other  problems  happen.  The next words contain a short description for the SCSI command that fails. The
       rest of the line tells you if there were any problems for the transport of the command over the SCSI bus.
       <b>fatal</b> <b>error</b> means that it was not possible to transport the  command  (i.e.  no  device  present  at  the
       requested SCSI address).

       The second line prints the SCSI command descriptor block for the failed command.

       The third line gives information on the SCSI status code returned by the command, if the transport of the
       command succeeds.  This is error information from the SCSI device.

       The fourth line is a hex dump of the auto request sense information for the command.

       The  fifth  line is the error text for the sense key if available, followed by the segment number that is
       only valid if the command was a <u>copy</u> command. If the error message is not directly related to the current
       command, the text <u>deferred</u> <u>error</u> is appended.

       The sixth line is the error text for the sense code and the sense qualifier if available.  If the type of
       the device is known, the sense data is decoded from tables in <u>scsierrs.c</u> .  The text is followed  by  the
       error value for a field replaceable unit.

       The seventh line prints the block number that is related to the failed command and text for several error
       flags. The block number may not be valid.

       The eight line reports the timeout set up for this command and the time that the command really needed to
       complete.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>readom</b> program described here is the Cdrkit spinoff from the original <b>readcd</b> application (see AUTHOR
       section for details). It may contain bugs not present in the original implementation.

       It is definitely less portable than the original implementation.

       For platform specific bugs, see the corresponding README.platform file in the Cdrkit  documentation  (eg.
       README.linux).
