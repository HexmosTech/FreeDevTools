</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       <b>gpg-card</b> - Administrate Smart Cards

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>gpg-card</b> [<u>options</u>]
       <b>gpg-card</b> [<u>options</u>] <u>command</u> { <b>--</b> <u>command</u> }

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>gpg-card</b> is used to administrate smart cards and USB tokens.  It provides a superset of features from
       <b>gpg</b>  <b>--card-edit</b>  an  can  be considered a frontend to <b>scdaemon</b> which is a daemon started by <b>gpg-agent</b> to
       handle smart cards.

       If <b>gpg-card</b> is invoked without commands an interactive mode is used.

       If <b>gpg-card</b> is invoked with one or more commands the same commands as available in the  interactive  mode
       are run from the command line.  These commands need to be delimited with a double-dash.  If a double-dash
       or  a  shell  specific  character  is required as part of a command the entire command needs to be put in
       quotes.  If one of those commands returns an error the remaining commands are not anymore run unless  the
       command was prefixed with a single dash.

       A  list  of  commands  is  available by using the command <b>help</b> and a brief description of each command is
       printed by using <b>help</b> <b>CMD</b>.  See the section COMMANDS for a full description.

       See the NOTES sections for instructions pertaining to specific cards or card applications.

</pre><h4><b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>gpg-card</b> understands the following commands, which have options of their own.  The pseudo-option ‘--’ can
       be used to separate command options from arguments; if this pseudo option is used on the command line the
       entire command with options and arguments must be quoted, so that it is not mixed up  with  the  ‘--’  as
       used  on  the  command  line  to  separate  commands.  Note that a short online help is available for all
       commands by prefixing them with ``help''.  Command completion in the interactive mode is also supported.

       <b>AUTHENTICATE</b> <b>[--setkey]</b> <b>[--raw]</b> <b>[&lt;</b> <u>file</u><b>]|</b><u>key</u><b>]</b>
       <b>AUTH</b>   Authenticate to the card.  Perform a mutual authentication either by reading the key from <u>file</u>  or
              by taking it from the command line as <u>key</u>.  Without the option <b>--raw</b> the key is expected to be hex
              encoded.   To  install  a  new  administration  key  <b>--setkey</b>  is  used;  this  requires  a  prior
              authentication with the old key.  This is used with PIV cards.

       <b>CAFPR</b> <b>[--clear]</b> <b>N</b>
              Change the CA fingerprint number N of an OpenPGP card.  N must be in the range 1 to 3.  The option
              <b>--clear</b> clears the specified CA fingerprint N or all of them if N is 0 or not given.

       <b>FACTORY-RESET</b>
              Do a complete reset of some OpenPGP and PIV cards.  This command deletes all  data  and  keys  and
              resets the PINs to their default.  Don't worry, you need to confirm before the command proceeds.

       <b>FETCH</b>  Retrieve a key using the URL data object of an OpenPGP card or if that is missing using the stored
              fingerprint.

       <b>FORCESIG</b>
              Toggle the forcesig flag of an OpenPGP card.

       <b>GENERATE</b> <b>[--force]</b> <b>[--algo=</b><u>algo</u><b>{+</b><u>algo2</u><b>}]</b> <u>keyref</u>
              Create a new key on a card.  Use <b>--force</b> to overwrite an existing key.  Use "help" for <u>algo</u> to get
              a  list of known algorithms.  For OpenPGP cards several algos may be given.  Note that the OpenPGP
              key generation is done interactively unless <b>--algo</b> or <u>keyref</u> are given.

       <b>KDF-SETUP</b>
              Prepare the OpenPGP card KDF feature for this card.

       <b>LANG</b> <b>[--clear]</b>
              Change the language info for the card.  This info can be used by applications for  a  personalized
              greeting.   Up  to  4  two-digit  language identifiers can be entered as a preference.  The option
              <b>--clear</b> removes all identifiers.  GnuPG does not use this info.

       <b>LIST</b> <b>[--cards]</b> <b>[--apps]</b> <b>[--info]</b> <b>[--no-key-lookup]</b> <b>[</b><u>n</u><b>]</b> <b>[</b><u>app</u><b>]</b>
       <b>L</b>      This command reads all information from the current card and display  them  in  a  human  readable
              format.   The  first  section shows generic information vaialable for all cards.  The next section
              shows information pertaining to keys which depend on the actual card and application.

              With <u>n</u> given select and list the n-th card; with <u>app</u>  also  given  select  that  application.   To
              select  an  <u>app</u>  on  the  current  card  use "-" for <u>n</u>.  The serial number of the card may be used
              instead of <u>n</u>.

              The option <b>--cards</b> lists the serial numbers of available cards.  The option <b>--apps</b> lists all  card
              applications.   The  option  <b>--info</b>  selects  a  card  and  prints  its serial number.  The option
              <b>--no-key-lookup</b> suppresses the listing of matching OpenPGP or X.509 keys.

       <b>LOGIN</b> <b>[--clear]</b> <b>[&lt;</b> <u>file</u><b>]</b>
              Set the login data object of OpenPGP cards.  If <u>file</u> is given the data is is read from that  file.
              This  allows  one  to  store binary data in the login field.  The option <b>--clear</b> deletes the login
              data object.

       <b>NAME</b> <b>[--clear]</b>
              Set the name field of an OpenPGP card.  With option <b>--clear</b> the stored name  is  cleared  off  the
              card.

       <b>PASSWD</b> <b>[--reset|--nullpin]</b> <b>[</b><u>pinref</u><b>]</b>
              Change  or  unblock  the  PINs.   Note  that  in  interactive  mode and without a <u>pinref</u> a menu is
              presented for certain cards."  In non-interactive mode and without a <u>pinref</u> a default value i used
              for these cards.  The option <b>--reset</b> is used with TCOS cards to reset the PIN  using  the  PUK  or
              vice versa; the option <u>--nullpin</u> is used for these cards to set the initial PIN.

       <b>PRIVATEDO</b> <b>[--clear]</b> <u>n</u> <b>[&lt;</b> <u>file</u><b>]</b>
              Change  the  private data object <u>n</u> of an OpenPGP card.  <u>n</u> must be in the range 1 to 4.  If <u>file</u> is
              given the data is is read from that file.  The option <b>--clear</b> clears the data.

       <b>QUIT</b>
       <b>Q</b>      Stop processing and terminate <b>gpg-card</b>.

       <b>READCERT</b> <b>[--openpgp]</b> <u>certref</u> <b>&gt;</b> <u>file</u>
              Read the certificate for key <u>certref</u> and store it in  <u>file</u>.   With  option  <b>--openpgp</b>  an  OpenPGP
              keyblock  wrapped  in  a  dedicated CMS content type (OID=1.3.6.1.4.1.11591.2.3.1) is expected and
              extracted to <u>file</u>.  Note that for current OpenPGP cards a certificate may only be available at the
              <u>certref</u> "OPENPGP.3".

       <b>RESET</b>  Send a reset to the card daemon.

       <b>SALUTATION</b> <b>[--clear]</b>
       <b>SALUT</b>  Change the salutation info for the card.  This info can be used by applications for a personalized
              greeting.  The option <b>--clear</b> removes this data object.  GnuPG does not use this info.

       <b>UIF</b> <u>N</u> <b>[on|off|permanent]</b>
              Change the User Interaction Flag.  That flags tells whether the confirmation  button  of  a  token
              shall be used.  <u>n</u> must in the range 1 to 3.  "permanent" is the same as "on" but the flag can't be
              changed anmore.

       <b>UNBLOCK</b>
              Unblock  a  PIN  using  a PUK or Reset Code.  Note that OpenPGP cards prior to version 2 can't use
              this; instead the <b>PASSWD</b> can be used to set a new PIN.

       <b>URL</b> <b>[--clear]</b>
              Set the URL data object of an OpenPGP card.  That data object can be  used  by  by  <b>gpg</b>'s  <b>--fetch</b>
              command  to  retrieve  the  full  public key.  The option <b>--clear</b> deletes the content of that data
              object.

       <b>VERIFY</b> <b>[</b><u>chvid</u><b>]</b>
              Verify the PIN identified by <u>chvid</u> or the default PIN.

       <b>WRITECERT</b> <u>certref</u> <b>&lt;</b> <u>file</u>
       <b>WRITECERT</b> <b>--openpgp</b> <u>certref</u> <b>[&lt;</b> <u>file</u><b>|</b><u>fpr</u><b>]</b>
       <b>WRITECERT</b> <b>--clear</b> <u>certref</u>
              Write a certificate to the card under the id <u>certref</u>.  The option <b>--clear</b> removes the  certificate
              from  the  card.  The option <b>--openpgp</b> expects an OpenPGP keyblock and stores it encapsulated in a
              CMS container; the keyblock is taken from <u>file</u> or directly from  the  OpenPGP  key  identified  by
              fingerprint <u>fpr</u>.

       <b>WRITEKEY</b> <b>[--force]</b> <u>keyref</u> <u>keygrip</u>
              Write  a private key object identified by <u>keygrip</u> to the card under the id <u>keyref</u>.  Option <b>--force</b>
              allows overwriting an existing key.

       <b>CHECKKEYS</b> <b>[--ondisk]</b> <b>[--delete-clear-copy]</b> <b>[--delete-protected-copy]</b>
              Print a list of keys noticed on all inserted cards.  With <b>--ondisk</b> only smartcard keys with a copy
              on disk are listed.  With <b>--delete-clear-copy</b> copies of smartcard keys stored on disk without  any
              protection  will  be deleted.  With <b>--delete-protected-copy</b> password protected copies of smartcard
              keys stored on disk will be deleted.

              This command creates missing shadow keys.  The delete options print the status of the keys  before
              they are deleted.

              The format of the output is:

              <b>Serial</b> <b>number</b>
                     A hex-string with the serial number of the card.

              <b>Type</b>   This gives the type of the card's application.  For example "OpenPGP" or "PIV".

              <b>Keygrip</b>
                     A hex-string identifying a key.

              <b>Keyref</b> The application slot where the key is stored on the card.  For example "OpenPGP.1"

              <b>Status</b> The status of the key.  The most common value is "shadowed" for a key where only the public
                     key along with the card's serial number is stored on the disk.  The value "clear" indicates
                     that  a  copy  of  the  card's  key  is  stored unprotected on disk.  The value "protected"
                     indicated that a copy of the car's key is stored on disk but is protected  by  a  password.
                     The  value  "error"  may  also be shown if there was a problem reading information from the
                     card.

       <b>YUBIKEY</b> <u>cmd</u> <u>args</u>
              Various commands pertaining to Yubikey tokens with <u>cmd</u> being:

              <b>LIST</b>   List supported and enabled Yubikey applications.

              <b>ENABLE</b> <b>usb|nfc|all</b> <b>[otp|u2f|opgp|piv|oath|fido2|all]</b>
              <b>DISABLE</b>
                     Enable or disable the specified or all applications on the given interface.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b> <b>(OPENPGP)</b></h4><pre>
       The support for OpenPGP cards in <b>gpg-card</b> is not yet complete.  For missing features, please continue  to
       use <b>gpg</b> <b>--card-edit</b>.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b> <b>(PIV)</b></h4><pre>
       GnuPG  has  support  for  PIV  cards  (``Personal  Identity  Verification''  as specified by NIST Special
       Publication 800-73-4).  This section describes how to initialize  (personalize)  a  fresh  Yubikey  token
       featuring  the  PIV  application  (requires Yubikey-5).  We assume that the credentials have not yet been
       changed and thus are:

       <b>Authentication</b> <b>key</b>
              This is a 24 byte key described by the hex string
              <b>010203040506070801020304050607080102030405060708</b>.

       <b>PIV</b> <b>Application</b> <b>PIN</b>
              This is the string <b>123456</b>.

       <b>PIN</b> <b>Unblocking</b> <b>Key</b>
              This is the string <b>12345678</b>.

       See the example section on how to change these defaults.  For production  use  it  is  important  to  use
       secure  values  for  them.  Note that the Authentication Key is not queried via the usual Pinentry dialog
       but needs to be entered manually or read from a file.  The use of  a  dedicated  machine  to  personalize
       tokens is strongly suggested.

       To  see  what  is  on  the  card, the command <b>list</b> can be given.  We will use the interactive mode in the
       following (the string <u>gpg/card&gt;</u> is the prompt).  An example output for a fresh card is:

         gpg/card&gt; list
         Reader ...........: 1050:0407:X:0
         Card type ........: yubikey
         Card firmware ....: 5.1.2
         Serial number ....: D2760001240102010006090746250000
         Application type .: OpenPGP
         Version ..........: 2.1
         [...]

       It can be seen by the ``Application type'' line that  GnuPG  selected  the  OpenPGP  application  of  the
       Yubikey.   This is because GnuPG assigns the highest priority to the OpenPGP application.  To use the PIV
       application of the Yubikey several methods can be used:

       With a Yubikey 5 or later the OpenPGP application on the Yubikey can be disabled:

         gpg/card&gt; yubikey disable all opgp
         gpg/card&gt; yubikey list
         Application  USB    NFC
         -----------------------
         OTP          yes    yes
         U2F          yes    yes
         OPGP         no     no
         PIV          yes    no
         OATH         yes    yes
         FIDO2        yes    yes
         gpg/card&gt; reset

       The <b>reset</b> is required so that the GnuPG system rereads the card.  Note that  disabled  applications  keep
       all their data and can at any time be re-enabled (use ‘help yubikey’).

       Another  option,  which  works  for  all Yubikey versions, is to disable the support for OpenPGP cards in
       scdaemon.  This is done by adding the line

         disable-application openpgp

       to ‘<u><a href="file:~/.gnupg/scdaemon.conf">~/.gnupg/scdaemon.conf</a></u>’ and by restarting scdaemon,  either  by  killing  the  process  or  by  using
       ‘gpgconf  --kill  scdaemon’.   Finally the default order in which card applications are tried by scdaemon
       can be changed.   For example to prefer PIV over OpenPGP it is sufficient to add

         application-priority piv

       to ‘<u><a href="file:~/.gnupg/scdaemon.conf">~/.gnupg/scdaemon.conf</a></u>’ and to restart <b>scdaemon</b>.  This has an effect only  on  tokens  which  support
       both, PIV and OpenPGP, but does not hamper the use of OpenPGP only tokens.

       With one of these methods employed the <b>list</b> command of <b>gpg-card</b> shows this:

         gpg/card&gt; list
         Reader ...........: 1050:0407:X:0
         Card type ........: yubikey
         Card firmware ....: 5.1.2
         Serial number ....: FF020001008A77C1
         Application type .: PIV
         Version ..........: 1.0
         Displayed s/n ....: yk-9074625
         PIN usage policy .: app-pin
         PIN retry counter : - 3 -
         PIV authentication: [none]
               keyref .....: PIV.9A
         Card authenticat. : [none]
               keyref .....: PIV.9E
         Digital signature : [none]
               keyref .....: PIV.9C
         Key management ...: [none]
               keyref .....: PIV.9D

       In case several tokens are plugged into the computer, gpg-card will show only one.  To show another token
       the  number  of  the  token  (0, 1, 2, ...) can be given as an argument to the <b>list</b> command.  The command
       ‘list --cards’ prints a list of all inserted tokens.

       Note that the ``Displayed s/n'' is printed on the token and also shown in Pinentry prompts asking for the
       PIN.  The four standard key slots are always shown, if other key slots are initialized they are shown  as
       well.   The  <u>PIV</u>  <u>authentication</u> key (internal reference <u>PIV.9A</u>) is used to authenticate the card and the
       card holder.  The use of the associated private key is protected by the Application PIN which needs to be
       provided once and the key can the be used until the card is reset or removed from the reader or USB port.
       GnuPG uses this key with its <u>Secure</u> <u>Shell</u> support.  The <u>Card</u> <u>authentication</u> key (<u>PIV.9E</u>) is also known as
       the CAK and used to support physical access applications.  The private key is not protected by a PIN  and
       can  thus  immediately  be used.  The <u>Digital</u> <u>signature</u> key (<u>PIV.9C</u>) is used to digitally sign documents.
       The use of the associated private key is protected by the Application PIN which needs to be provided  for
       each  signing  operation.   The  <u>Key</u>  <u>management</u>  key  (<u>PIV.9D</u>)  is  used for encryption.  The use of the
       associated private key is protected by the Application PIN which needs to be provided only once  so  that
       decryption operations can then be done until the card is reset or removed from the reader or USB port.

       We  now  generate  three  of  the  four  keys.   Note  that  GnuPG  does  currently  not use the the <u>Card</u>
       <u>authentication</u> key; however, that key is mandatory by the PIV standard and thus we create  it  too.   Key
       generation requires that we authenticate to the card.  This can be done either on the command line (which
       would reveal the key):

         gpg/card&gt; auth 010203040506070801020304050607080102030405060708

       or  by  reading  the  key from a file.  That file needs to consist of one LF terminated line with the hex
       encoded key (as above):

         gpg/card&gt; auth &lt; myauth.key

       As usual ‘help auth’ gives help for this command.  An error message is printed if a non-matching  key  is
       used.  The authentication is valid until a reset of the card or until the card is removed from the reader
       or  the  USB  port.   Note that that in non-interactive mode the ‘&lt;’ needs to be quoted so that the shell
       does not interpret it as a its own redirection symbol.

       Here are the actual commands to generate the keys:

         gpg/card&gt; generate --algo=nistp384 PIV.9A
         PIV card no. yk-9074625 detected
         gpg/card&gt; generate --algo=nistp256 PIV.9E
         PIV card no. yk-9074625 detected
         gpg/card&gt; generate --algo=rsa2048 PIV.9C
         PIV card no. yk-9074625 detected

       If a key has already been created for one of the slots an error will be printed;  to  create  a  new  key
       anyway  the  option  ‘--force’ can be used.  Note that only the private and public keys have been created
       but no certificates are stored in the key slots.  In fact, GnuPG uses  its  own  non-standard  method  to
       store  just  the  public key in place of the the certificate.  Other application will not be able to make
       use these keys until <b>gpgsm</b> or another tool has been used to create and store the respective certificates.
       Let us see what the list command now shows:

         gpg/card&gt; list

       The primary information for each key is the <u>keygrip</u>, a 40 byte  hex-string  identifying  the  key.   This
       keygrip  is  a unique identifier for the specific parameters of a key.  It is used by <b>gpg-agent</b> and other
       parts of GnuPG to associate a private key to its protocol specific certificate format (X.509, OpenPGP, or
       SecureShell).  Below the keygrip the key reference along  with  the  key  usage  capabilities  are  show.
       Finally  the  algorithm  is  printed in the format used by  {gpg}.  At that point no other information is
       shown because for these new keys gpg won't be able to find matching certificates.

       Although we could have created the <u>Key</u> <u>management</u> key also with the generate command, we will create that
       key off-card so that a backup exists.  To accomplish this a key needs to be created with  either  <b>gpg</b>  or
       <b>gpgsm</b>  or imported in one of these tools.  In our example we create a self-signed X.509 certificate (exit
       the gpg-card tool, first):

         $ gpgsm --gen-key -o encr.crt
            (1) RSA

         Proceed with creation? (y/N)
         Now creating self-signed certificate.  This may take a while ...

         gpgsm: certificate created
         Ready.
         $ gpgsm --import encr.crt
         gpgsm: certificate imported
         gpgsm: total number processed: 1
         gpgsm:               imported: 1

       Note the last step which imported the created certificate.  If you  you  instead  created  a  certificate
       signing  request  (CSR)  instead  of a self-signed certificate and sent this off to a CA you would do the
       same import step with the certificate received from the CA.  Take note of the keygrip (prefixed  with  an
       ampersand)  as  shown  during  the certificate creation or listed it again using ‘gpgsm --with-keygrip -k
       <a href="mailto:otto@example.net">otto@example.net</a>’.  Now to move the key and certificate to the card start <b>gpg-card</b> again and enter:

         gpg/card&gt; writekey PIV.9D 34798AAFE0A7565088101CC4AE31C5C8C74461CB
         gpg/card&gt; writecert PIV.9D &lt; encr.crt

       If you entered a passphrase to protect the private key, you will be asked for it via the Pinentry prompt.
       On success the key and the certificate has been written to the card and a <b>list</b> command shows:

         [...]
         Key management ...: 34798AAFE0A7565088101CC4AE31C5C8C74461CB

                 user id ..: &lt;<a href="mailto:otto@example.net">otto@example.net</a>&gt;

       In case the same key (identified by the keygrip) has been used for  several  certificates  you  will  see
       several  ``used  for''  parts.   With  this the encryption key is now fully functional and can be used to
       decrypt messages encrypted to this certificate.  <b>Take</b> <b>care:</b> the original key is still stored on-disk  and
       should   be   moved   to   a   backup   medium.    This   can   simply   be  done  by  copying  the  file
       ‘<u>34798AAFE0A7565088101CC4AE31C5C8C74461CB.key</u>’ from the directory  ‘<u><a href="file:~/.gnupg/private-keys-v1.d/">~/.gnupg/private-keys-v1.d/</a></u>’  to  the
       backup medium and deleting the file at its original place.

       The  final  example  is to create a self-signed certificate for digital signatures.  Leave <b>gpg-card</b> using
       <b>quit</b> or by pressing Control-D and use gpgsm:

         $ gpgsm --learn

         gpgsm:               imported: 1

       The use of ‘gpgsm --learn’ is currently necessary so that gpg-agent knows what keys are available on  the
       card.   The  need for this command will eventually be removed.  The remaining commands are similar to the
       creation of an on-disk key.  However, here we select the ‘Digital signature’ key.   During  the  creation
       process  you  will  be  asked  for  the  Application  PIN  of  the  card.  The final step is to write the
       certificate to the card using <b>gpg-card</b>:

         gpg/card&gt; writecert PIV.9C &lt; sign.crt

       By running list again we will see the fully initialized card:

       It is now possible to sign and to encrypt with this card using gpgsm and to use the ‘PIV  authentication’
       key with ssh:

         $ ssh-add -l
         384 SHA256:0qnJ0Y0ehWxKcx2frLfEljf6GCdlO55OZed5HqGHsaU cardno:yk-9074625 (ECDSA)

       As  usual  use  ssh-add with the uppercase ‘-L’ to list the public ssh key.  To use the certificates with
       Thunderbird or Mozilla, please consult the Scute manual for details.

       If you want to use the same PIV keys also for OpenPGP (for  example  on  a  Yubikey  to  avoid  switching
       between OpenPGP and PIV), this is also possible:

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>gpg-card</b> understands these options:

       <b>--with-colons</b>
              This option has currently no effect.

       <b>--status-fd</b> <u>n</u>
              Write  special  status  strings  to  the  file descriptor <u>n</u>.  This program returns only the status
              messages SUCCESS or FAILURE which are helpful when the caller uses  a  double  fork  approach  and
              can't easily get the return code of the process.

       <b>--verbose</b>
              Enable extra informational output.

       <b>--quiet</b>
              Disable almost all informational output.

       <b>--version</b>
              Print version of the program and exit.

       <b>--help</b> Display a brief help page and exit.

       <b>--no-autostart</b>
              Do  not  start  the  gpg-agent  if  it has not yet been started and its service is required.  This
              option is mostly useful on machines where the connection  to  gpg-agent  has  been  redirected  to
              another machines.

       <b>--no-history</b>
              In  interactive  mode  the  command  line history is usually saved and restored to and from a file
              below the GnuPG home directory.  This option inhibits the use of that file.

       <b>--agent-program</b> <u>file</u>
              Specify the agent program to be started if none is running.  The default value  is  determined  by
              running <b>gpgconf</b> with the option <b>--list-dirs</b>.

       <b>--gpg-program</b> <u>file</u>
              Specify a non-default gpg binary to be used by certain commands.

       <b>--gpgsm-program</b> <u>file</u>
              Specify a non-default gpgsm binary to be used by certain commands.

       <b>--chuid</b> <u>uid</u>
              Change  the current user to <u>uid</u> which may either be a number or a name.  This can be used from the
              root account to run gpg-card for another user.  If <u>uid</u> is not the current UID a standard  PATH  is
              set  and  the envvar GNUPGHOME is unset.  To override the latter the option <b>--homedir</b> can be used.
              This option has only an effect when used on the command line.  This option has currently no effect
              at all on Windows.
