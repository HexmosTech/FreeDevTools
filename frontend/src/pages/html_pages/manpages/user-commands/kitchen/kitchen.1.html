       Kitchen - integration tool for Chef

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Test  Kitchen  is  a  test  harness  tool  to  execute  your  configured code on one or more platforms in
       isolation. A driver plugin architecture is used which lets you run your code on various  cloud  providers
       and  virtualization  technologies  such  as  Amazon  EC2, Blue Box, CloudStack, Digital Ocean, Rackspace,
       OpenStack, Vagrant, Docker, LXC containers, and more. Many testing frameworks are already  supported  out
       of the box including Bats, shUnit2, RSpec, Serverspec, with others being created weekly.

       For Chef workflows, cookbook dependency resolver tools such as Berkshelf and Librarian-Chef are supported
       or  you  can  simply  have a cookbooks/ directory and Test Kitchen will know what to do. Support for Test
       Kitchen is already included in many Chef community cookbooks such as the MySQL, nginx, Chef  Server,  and
       runit cookbooks.

              A  `.kitchen.yml` will be created in your project base directory. This file describes your testing
              configuration; what you want to test and on which  target  platforms.  Each  of  these  suite  and
              platform combinations are called instances.  By default your instances will be converged with Chef
              Solo and run in Vagrant virtual machines.
