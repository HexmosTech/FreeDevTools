</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       gtk-gnutella - A Gnutella client for Gtk+

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>gtk-gnutella</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>gtk-gnutella</u>  is  a  GTK+  Gnutella  client for Unix. It supports both searching and sharing with the 0.6
       version of the Gnutella protocol and includes support for numerous protocol  improvements  and  additions
       that have been added to the Gnutella network since.

       The  Gnutella  network allows users to search for files and to advertise files shared locally, but is not
       handling file transfers which is done through HTTP.  The addition of Gnutella-specific HTTP headers makes
       each Gnutella client a powerful file swarmer where even firewalled hosts can contribute.

       Great care has been devoted into making <u>gtk-gnutella</u> powerful, efficient and reliable.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       All the options can be abbreviated as long as the supplied name is not ambiguous.

       <b>--cleanup</b>
              For developers mostly: this requests a final memory cleanup sequence at exit time in an attempt to
              be able to spot memory leaks by looking  at  all  the  remaining  allocated  blocks,  letting  the
              developpers figuring out, perhaps, why they were not cleaned-up properly.

       <b>--compile-info</b>
              Tell  <u>gtk-gnutella</u> to output a list of variables describing compile-time configuration information
              that was gathered when the program was built.

       <b>--daemonize</b>
              This options causes <u>gtk-gnutella</u> to become a daemon. It detaches from  the  terminal  (if  started
              from  one)  and forks itself into the background. It also changes it working directory to the root
              directory i.e., "/" so that it doesn't block a mount point for example. This is mainly  meant  for
              headless mode but you can also use it if the Gtk+ GUI is enabled.

              For  example,  if  you  do  not start gtk-gnutella from a terminal but from a window manager menu,
              there's little reason to not daemonize gtk-gnutella. Thus you might want to  add  the  --daemonize
              option in this case.

              Please note that when <u>gtk-gnutella</u> is started as a daemon all output which is normally send to the
              standard  output  and  standard  error  output (usually your terminal or a common log file such as
              <a href="file:~/.xsession-errors">~/.xsession-errors</a>), is sent to /dev/null. The options <b>--log-stderr</b> and <b>--log-stdout</b> can  be  used
              to redirect log output in this case.

       <b>--exec-on-crash</b> <u>path</u>
              Execute command specified in <u>path</u> when <u>gtk-gnutella</u> crashes.

       <b>--geometry</b>
              This  option  can be used to force the main window of the GUI to a certain location on your screen
              and/or give it certain dimensions.

              For example, the following would position the window in the lower right corner with a width of 800
              pixels and a height of 600 pixels:

                  gtk-gnutella --geometry 800x600-0-0

              Note that none of this can be guaranteed, your window manager has the  last  word  on  this.  This
              option is a traditional command-line switch supported by most X11 applications.

       <b>--help</b> Show a summary of all supported options.

       <b>--log-stderr</b> <b>,</b> <b>--log-stdout</b>
              These  options  allow you to log everything which is written to stderr respectively stdout to some
              files. A typical use would look like this:

                 gtk-gnutella --daemonize  \
                      --log-stderr <a href="file:~/logs/gtkg.stderr">~/logs/gtkg.stderr</a> \
                      --log-stdout <a href="file:~/logs/gtkg.stdout">~/logs/gtkg.stdout</a>

              Redirecting these log messages also works without <b>--daemonize.</b>  Of course, log  files  can  become
              large and you might want to archive them or delete them periodically. After moving or deleting the
              log files, you can send <u>gtk-gnutella</u> a SIGHUP signal to create new log files.

       <b>--log-supervise</b>
              Redirects the logs for the supervisor process.

       <b>--minimized</b>
              Launches  <u>gtk-gnutella</u> with a minimized main window. Recommended when starting <u>gtk-gnutella</u> <u>in</u> the
              background on login.

       <b>--no-dbus</b>
              Disable notifications of <u>gtk-gnutella</u> events to D-BUS.

       <b>--no-restart</b>
              Prevents <u>gtk-gnutella</u> from auto-restarting itself when crashing on a platform where core dumps are
              not possible or disabled.

       <b>--no-supervise</b>
              Prevents <u>gtk-gnutella</u> from starting a supervising process that will monitor the main  process  and
              automatically restart a new instance when the previous one exits abnormally.

       <b>--no-xshm</b>
              Disable MIT shared memory extension, when running with the X graphical user-interface.

       <b>--pause-on-crash</b>
              Pause  the  process  on crash, so that a debugger may be attached to inspect the current state for
              instance.

       <b>--ping</b> This option allows you to check whether <u>gtk-gnutella</u> is currently  running.  This  option  returns
              with a success code when <u>gtk-gnutella</u> is already running, and with a failure code when it is not.

              This  allows you to use the following code to start <u>gtk-gnutella</u> from a cron job or window manager
              menu and avoid starting it twice:

                  gtk-gnutella --ping || gtk-gnutella

       <b>--restart-on-crash</b>
              Asks <u>gtk-gnutella</u> to auto-restart itself after  crashing  on  a  platform  where  core  dumps  are
              allowed.

              Regardless   of   core  dumping  options,  <b>--no-restart</b>  will  always  prevent  a  restart  whilst
              <b>--restart-on-crash</b> will always request one if possible.  It is not allowed to supply both  options
              at the same time.

       <b>--resume-session</b>
              Requests  that  the  previous  session  be  continued.   This means that searches launched for the
              duration of the session only will not expire, that seeded files will continue to  be  seeded,  and
              that all the other aspects persisted during the previous session will be restored (current tab for
              instance).

       <b>--shell</b>
              When  this  option is used to connect to an already running <u>gtk-gnutella</u> process over a local unix
              domain  socket.  This  socket  is  located  at   "$GTK_GNUTELLA_DIR/ipc/socket",   thus   normally
              "<a href="file:~/.gtk-gnutella/ipc/socket">~/.gtk-gnutella/ipc/socket</a>". The socket is only accessible by the user running gtk-gnutella which
              is  enforced  by filesystem permissions. The socket is in a dedicated directory because apparently
              not all systems honor the access permissions on sockets as seen through the filesystem.

              You can disable this feature by  setting  the  property  "enable_local_socket"  to  FALSE.  It  is
              recommendable  to  use this local socket whenever possible instead of the TCP socket to access the
              shell interface remotely. The reason is that the authentication token is passed non-encrypted over
              the network and everyone who can sniff the network is able to connect to the  remote  shell.  This
              may  not  matter  over  the  loopback interface or a LAN, but it's a bad idea to use this over the
              Internet.

       <b>--topless</b>
              Starts gtk-gnutella without the graphical user-interface.

       <b>--use-poll</b>
              For developers mostly: this requests that I/O polling  be  done  exclusively  through  the  <b>poll()</b>
              interface instead of more modern and efficient <b>epoll()</b> or <b>kqueue()</b> system calls.

       <b>--version</b>
              Show the user-agent string used on the Gnutella network which also holds the version information.

</pre><h4><b>GETTING</b> <b>STARTED</b></h4><pre>
       When  <u>gtk-gnutella</u>  is  first  started,  it will attempt to connect to a well-known hosts server for some
       hosts to connect to. If you know a host you want to connect to, you can  enter  it  in  the  box  on  the
       GnutellaNet  tab and push the Add button. When first connecting to the gnutella network, it can take some
       time to establish a stable connection. Be patient.

</pre><h4><b>SEARCHING</b></h4><pre>
       To search files just type your query in the search box at the top  of  the  screen.  All  searches,  both
       active and inactive, are shown in the sidebar.

       You  can  have multiple searches running at once. To start another search while the first one is running,
       simply enter another search term into the edit box at the top of the window.

       To stop a particular search and remove its tab from the search window, select the search by  clicking  on
       its  tab  and click the "Close search" button. If you want to clear the list for a particular search, but
       want to continue to see new files that are received for this search, click the "Clear results" button.

       It is possible to apply filtering to search results using the filter editor. Click on "Edit  filters"  to
       access  the  editor.  Use  of the filtering editor goes beyond the scope of this man page, but there is a
       tutorial on this topic on the <u>gtk-gnutella</u> homepage.

       When you find a file that you want to  download,  select  the  file  in  the  list  and  click  "Download
       selected".  This  file  will  be  placed  in  the download queue. On the downloads view you can watch the
       download progress of the file(s) you are downloading.

       It is also possible to select a bunch of files for downloading at once. By holding down  the  control  or
       shift  keys  while clicking files, you can select several files and then click "Download selected" to put
       them all in the download queue at once.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       Most of the configuration can be done via the "Preferences" window that can be accesed using the "File -&gt;
       Preferences" menu-option.  You will find several tabs there, each tab regrouping common information.  But
       some specific information pertaining to downloads or searches are directly available on  the  "Downloads"
       and "Uploads" panes.

       If  you  linger  your mouse over each configuration parameter, a tooltip window will popup explaining the
       meaning of that parameter.  You may have to press "Enter" after a  text  input,  or  move  the  focus  to
       another  parameter  to  validate  your  entry.   Items  configured  via spin buttons normally take effect
       immediately, unless you type text instead of using the spin buttons.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <u>$GTK_GNUTELLA_DIR/config_gnet</u>
              Per-user configuration file, for core settings. This  can  be  edited  when  the  program  is  not
              running, but it is best to use the GUI to change configuration variables.  <b>gtk-gnutella</b> saves this
              file every time the program is exited normally.

       <u>$GTK_GNUTELLA_DIR/config_gui</u>
              GUI configuration.  It is best to not edit this file.

       <u>$GTK_GNUTELLA_DIR/dmesh</u>
              This is where the download mesh is persisted.  You don't need to worry about this.

       <u>$GTK_GNUTELLA_DIR/dmesh_ban</u>
              This is where temporarily banned download mesh entries are stored.

       <u>$GTK_GNUTELLA_DIR/done.namesize</u>
              This  file  holds  the name and size of files completely downloaded by <b>gtk-gnutella</b> and which will
              now be ignored.

       <u>$GTK_GNUTELLA_DIR/done.sha1</u>
              This file holds the SHA1 of files completely downloaded by <b>gtk-gnutella</b>  and  which  will  now  be
              ignored.

       <u>$GTK_GNUTELLA_DIR/downloads</u>
              This is where the download queue is persisted.  Only the direct downloads (i.e. non-pushed) can be
              saved, since they don't need routing information.

       <u>$GTK_GNUTELLA_DIR/hosts</u>
              This is the host cache. This is saved by <b>gtk-gnutella</b> on exit and should not be edited by hand.

       <u>$GTK_GNUTELLA_DIR/searches.xml</u>
              This is where the open searches and all the search filters are saved.

       <u>$GTK_GNUTELLA_DIR/sha1_cache</u>
              This is where the cache of all the computed SHA1 is stored.

       <u>$GTK_GNUTELLA_DIR/tth_cache</u>
              This  is  the directory under which all the computed TTH trees are stored.  These files are binary
              data.

       <u>$GTK_GNUTELLA_DIR/upload_stats</u>
              This file keeps track of the upload statistics.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <u>gtk-gnutella</u> searches <b>GTK_GNUTELLA_DIR</b> for configuration files. If this variable is not set, <b>HOME</b> is used
       instead. If <b>HOME</b> is not set, then no configuration information will be saved when <u>gtk-gnutella</u> exits.

</pre><h4><b>MAILING</b> <b>LISTS</b></h4><pre>
       There are a couple of mailing lists for <u>gtk-gnutella.</u>  See <a href="http://sourceforge.net/mail/">http://sourceforge.net/mail/</a>?group_id=4467 for
       more info.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>gtk-gnutella</u> is production-quality software, but still has minor bugs and incomplete or missing features.
       But which software doesn't for its authors?

       There are probably other missing features that should be listed here.

       A list of known bugs might be available at the <u>gtk-gnutella</u> web site (see below.)
