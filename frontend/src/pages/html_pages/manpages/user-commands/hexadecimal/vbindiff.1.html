</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       vbindiff - hexadecimal file display and comparison

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>vbindiff</b> <u>file1</u> [ <u>file2</u> ]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Visual Binary Diff (VBinDiff) displays files in hexadecimal and ASCII (or EBCDIC).  It can also display
       two files at once, and highlight the differences between them.  Unlike <b>diff</b>, it works well with large
       files (up to 4 GB).

   <b>Viewing</b> <b>files</b>
        Movement Keys
        -------------
        Up      Move one line (16 bytes) towards the beginning of the file
        Down    Move one line (16 bytes) towards the end of the file
        Left    Move one byte towards the beginning of the file
        Right   Move one byte towards the end of the file
        PageUp  Move one page towards the beginning of the file
        PageDn  Move one page towards the end of the file
        Home    Move to the beginning of the file
        End     Move to the end of the (shorter) file
        F       Search for a string or byte sequence
        G       Move to a specified file position

       When displaying two files, both files move together.  If bytes have been added or removed in one of the
       files, you can adjust the comparison by moving just one of the files.  To move only the top file, press
       "T".  To move only the bottom file, press "B".  To return to moving both files, press the same key again.
       (The window at the bottom of the screen will indicate when you are moving only one file.)

        Other Keys
        ----------
        Enter  Move to the next difference between the files
        Space  (same as Enter)
        C      Toggle between ASCII and EBCDIC display
        E      Edit currently displayed section of file
        Esc    Exit VBinDiff
        Q      Exit VBinDiff

       The "Enter" key will advance to the next difference between the files (after those already displayed on
       the screen).  If there are no more differences, it moves to the end.

   <b>Line</b> <b>editor</b>
       The line editor is used to enter search strings and file positions.  It uses the basic Emacs-style
       editing keys.

        Keys
        -----------------
        Ctrl-B, Left       Move the cursor one character left
        Ctrl-F, Right      Move the cursor one character right
        Ctrl-A, Home       Move to the beginning of the line
        Ctrl-E, End        Move to the end of the line
        Ctrl-P, Up         Move up in input history
        Ctrl-N, Down       Move down in input history
        Ctrl-H, Backspace  Delete the character to the left
        Ctrl-D, Delete     Delete the character under the cursor
        Ctrl-K             Delete from cursor to end of line
        Insert             Toggle between insert &amp; overstrike mode
        Enter              Finished entering text
        Esc                Abort the operation

   <b>Editing</b> <b>files</b>
       You can press "E" to edit the current file.  When displaying two files, this edits the one in the top
       window, unless you are in "move bottom" mode.

       When editing, you can move the cursor around with the arrow keys.  Use TAB to switch between entering
       hexadecimal or ASCII (or EBCDIC) characters.  Press the Esc key when you are done.  You will be given the
       choice to save or discard your changes then.

       If you are displaying two files, you can use the Enter key to copy a byte from the other file into the
       one you are editing.

       You cannot scroll through the file while editing, although you can save your changes and then move to a
       different part of the file.  Also, you cannot insert or delete bytes, only change them.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
        -L, --license   Display license information for vbindiff
        -V, --version   Display the version number
            --help      Display help information

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Does not work properly with files over 4 gigabytes.  It should be able to view the first 4 gigabytes ok,
       but the display only has room for 8 hex digits of file position, and the Goto box is also limited to 8
       digits.
