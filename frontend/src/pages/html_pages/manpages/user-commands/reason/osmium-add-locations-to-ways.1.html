</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       osmium-add-locations-to-ways - add node locations to ways in OSM file

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>osmium</b> <b>add-locations-to-ways</b> [<u>OPTIONS</u>] <u>OSM-FILE</u>...

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Usually  only  nodes have locations and the ways refer to those locations via the IDs of the nodes.  This
       program will copy the input file(s) to the output, taking the locations from the nodes and adding them to
       the ways.  This makes it easier for other programs to assemble the way geometries.

       The input file must contain all nodes needed for the ways, otherwise there will be  an  error.   You  can
       change this behaviour using the <b>--ignore-missing-nodes</b> option.

       Nodes without any tags will not be copied (unless the <b>--keep-untagged-nodes/-n</b> option is used).  The size
       of   the   output   file   will   be   similar  or  a  bit  smaller  than  the  input  file  (unless  the
       <b>--keep-untagged-nodes/-n</b> option is used in which case it will be a lot bigger).

       Note that the OSM files generated by this command use a format  extension.   Most  programs  reading  OSM
       files will not understand this extension and should ignore the extra data.

       The  <b>osmium</b>  <b>add-locations-to-ways</b>  command  has to keep an index of the node locations in memory or in a
       temporary file on disk while doing its work.  There are several different ways it can do that which  have
       different  advantages  and  disadvantages.   The  default  is  good  enough  for  most cases, but see the
       <b><a href="../man5/osmium-index-types.5.html">osmium-index-types</a></b>(5) man page for details.

       If the <b>--keep-untagged-nodes/-n</b> option is used, files created by this command can  be  updated  with  the
       <b>apply-changes</b> command using the <b>--locations-on-ways</b> option.

       This command will not work on full history files.

       The  command will work with negative IDs (unless the option <b>–keep-member-nodes</b> is used).  The index types
       for positive IDs and negative IDs are  set  separately  with  the  <b>--index-type/-i</b>  and  <b>--index-type-neg</b>
       options, respectively.

       This commands reads its input file(s) only once (unless the <b>–keep-member-nodes</b> option is used) and writes
       its  output  file  in one go so it can be streamed, ie.  it can read from STDIN and write to STDOUT.  The
       input file must be sorted in the usual order: first nodes, then ways, then  relations,  objects  of  each
       type  ordered  by id.  If there are multiple input files, they will be read in the order specified on the
       command line.  They must together have the correct order, so, for instance, the first one  can  have  all
       the  sorted  nodes, the second all the sorted ways, etc.  If this is not the case use <b>osmium</b> <b>merge</b> on the
       inputs first.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       -i, --index-type=TYPE
              Set the index type for positive IDs.  For details see the <b><a href="../man5/osmium-index-types.5.html">osmium-index-types</a></b>(5) man page.

       --index-type-neg=TYPE
              Set the index type for negative IDs.  For details see the <b><a href="../man5/osmium-index-types.5.html">osmium-index-types</a></b>(5) man page.

       -I, --show-index-types
              Shows a list of available index types.  For details see the <b><a href="../man5/osmium-index-types.5.html">osmium-index-types</a></b>(5) man page.

       -n, --keep-untagged-nodes
              Keep the untagged nodes in the output file.

       --keep-member-nodes
              Keep the nodes that are referenced from relations.  If this option is specified the input  file(s)
              are read twice.  Note that the nodes kept when this option is set are a strict subset of the nodes
              kept when <b>–keep-untagged-nodes</b> is set, so setting both options is unnecessary.

       --ignore-missing-nodes
              If  this  is  not set a missing node needed for a way results in an error.  If this is set, errors
              are ignored and the way will have an invalid location set for the missing node.

</pre><h4><b>COMMON</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       -h, --help
              Show usage help.

       -v, --verbose
              Set verbose mode.  The program will output information about what it is doing to STDERR.

       --progress
              Show progress bar.  Usually a progress bar is only displayed if STDOUT and STDERR are detected  to
              be  TTY.  With this option a progress bar is always shown.  Note that a progress bar will never be
              shown when reading from STDIN or a pipe.

       --no-progress
              Do not show progress bar.  Usually a progress bar is displayed if STDOUT and STDERR  are  detected
              to  be  a  TTY.   With  this option the progress bar is suppressed.  Note that a progress bar will
              never be shown when reading from STDIN or a pipe.

</pre><h4><b>INPUT</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       -F, --input-format=FORMAT
              The format of the input file(s).  Can be used to set the input format if it can’t be  autodetected
              from  the  file name(s).  This will set the format for all input files, there is no way to set the
              format for some input files only.  See <b><a href="../man5/osmium-file-formats.5.html">osmium-file-formats</a></b>(5) or the libosmium manual for details.

</pre><h4><b>OUTPUT</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       -f, --output-format=FORMAT
              The format of the output file.  Can be used  to  set  the  output  file  format  if  it  can’t  be
              autodetected  from  the  output file name.  See <b><a href="../man5/osmium-file-formats.5.html">osmium-file-formats</a></b>(5) or the libosmium manual for
              details.

       --fsync
              Call fsync after writing the output file to force flushing buffers to disk.

       --generator=NAME
              The name and version of the program generating the output file.  It will be added to the header of
              the output file.  Default is “<u>osmium/</u>” and the version of osmium.

       -o, --output=FILE
              Name of the output file.  Default is `-' (STDOUT).

       -O, --overwrite
              Allow an existing output file to be overwritten.  Normally <b>osmium</b> will refuse  to  write  over  an
              existing file.

       --output-header=OPTION=VALUE
              Add  output  header  option.   This  command  line option can be used multiple times for different
              OPTIONs.  See the <u><a href="../man5/osmium-output-headers.5.html">osmium-output-headers</a>(5)</u> man page for a list of available header  options.   For
              some  commands you can use the special format “OPTION!” (ie.  an exclamation mark after the OPTION
              and no value set) to set the value to the same as in the input file.

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>osmium</b> <b>add-locations-to-ways</b> exits with exit code

       0      if everything went alright,

       1      if there was an error processing the data, or

       2      if there was a problem with the command line arguments.

</pre><h4><b>MEMORY</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       <b>osmium</b> <b>add-locations-to-ways</b> will usually keep all node locations in memory.  For larger data files, this
       can need several tens of GBytes of memory.  See the <b><a href="../man5/osmium-index-types.5.html">osmium-index-types</a></b>(5) man page for details.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Add node locations to an extract keeping all nodes:

              osmium add-locations-to-ways -n -o germany-low.osm.pbf germany.osm.pbf

       Add node locations to a planet file (without untagged nodes):

              osmium add-locations-to-ways -i dense_mmap_array -o planet-low.osm.pbf planet.osm.pbf
