</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       sense_emu_gui - Sense HAT emulator

       The  Sense HAT emulator application. This GTK application provides an interactive interface for emulating
       the Raspberry Pi Sense HAT.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
          sense_emu_gui

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       [image]

       The main window is divided into four parts. At the left is a visual  representation  of  the  Sense  HAT.
       Scripts  using  the  emulator  library  (<b>sense_emu</b>)  to  set the HAT's LEDs will display the result here.
       Immediately below the LEDs are the rotation buttons which rotate the view of the HAT. These buttons  also
       affect the action of the joystick buttons (covered below).

       To  the  right  of the LEDs are three sliders representing the temperature, pressure, and humidity of the
       emulated HAT's environment.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          The emulation does not <u>precisely</u> reflect the settings  of  the  temperature,  pressure,  and  humidity
          sliders.  Random  errors  are introduced that scale according to the sensor specifications, and as the
          sliders are adjusted, the sensor value will gradually drift towards the new setting at a similar  rate
          to the sensors on the real HAT.

       On the far right of the window, three sliders provide the orientation of the emulated HAT in terms of yaw
       (rotation  around the vertical Z axis), pitch (rotation around the Y axis), and roll (rotation around the
       X axis). Adjusting these sliders affect the accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer (compass)  sensors
       on  the emulated HAT. The emulated HAT assumes gravity runs vertically in the direction of the Z axis (as
       in the real HAT), and that North is in the direction of the X axis.

       Finally, at the bottom right of the window, a series of buttons are provided to emulate the  joystick  on
       the  HAT.  The buttons will simulate <u>press</u>, <u>release</u>, and <u>hold</u> events generated by the real joystick. When
       the view of the HAT is rotated, the joystick buttons will act in the new  orientation  of  the  HAT.  For
       example,  initially  the  "up" button will send "up" events. After the HAT is rotated 90° the "up" button
       will send "right" events. After another 90° rotation, the "up" button will send "down" events, and so on.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          The emulator must be run prior to starting any scripts which expect  to  use  the  <b>sense_emu</b>  library.
          However,  the  emulator  can be terminated (and restarted) while scripts using the library are running
          (obviously, when the emulator isn't running sensor errors can't be emulated and  all  sensor  readings
          will  appear  fixed).  Attempting to spawn more than one instance of the emulator will simply activate
          the existing instance.

</pre><h4><b>PREFERENCES</b></h4><pre>
       On slower Pis in particular, you may wish to disable  some  aspects  of  the  emulation  for  performance
       purposes.  From  the "Edit" menu, select "Preferences".  In the window that appears you can control which
       aspects of the emulation are enabled, and what speed the screen updates will be limited to.  [image]

       You can also control the appearance of angles for the orientation sliders (note that  this  is  a  purely
       visual preference; it doesn't affect the output of the emulated sensors in any way).

</pre><h4><b>REPLAY</b></h4><pre>
       Recordings  of  actual  sensor  readings  from  a Sense HAT can be replayed within the emulator. From the
       "File" menu, select "Replay recording". From the file selection dialog that appears, select the recording
       you wish to replay and click "Open".  The replay will immediately begin, with progress displayed in a bar
       at the bottom of the main window. You can click "Stop" (next to the progress bar) to  terminate  playback
       of the recording.  [image]

       During playback, the sensor sliders will move according to the data in the recording but will be disabled
       (to prevent the user affecting the replay). At the end of the replay (or immediately after termination of
       playback), the sliders will be left at their present positions and re-enabled.
