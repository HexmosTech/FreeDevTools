</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       qtel - a "QT EchoLink" client

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Qtel  stands  for the "QT EchoLink" client. It is only a EchoLink client application.  There is no "sysop
       mode". If it is a link you want to run, have a look at the SvxLink server application. Qtel  is  quite  a
       simple application, so most things should be self explainatory. There are three windows: the main window,
       the communications dialog and the settings dialog.

       <b>The</b> <b>Qtel</b> <b>Main</b> <b>Window</b>

       The  main  window  consists of four areas. The top-left is where to choose which class of staions to view
       (Conferences, Links, Repeaters and private Stations). All stations in a class is shown to the  top-right.
       At  left-bottom  is  a message area that shows the messages from the EchoLink directory server. At right-
       bottom is a list of incoming connections. To accept an incoming connection,  highlight  the  station  and
       press "Accept".

       <b>The</b> <b>Qtel</b> <b>Communications</b> <b>Dialog</b>

       The  communications  dialog is used to perform a Qso to anoher station. To activate it, double-click on a
       station line or just press the enter key when the station is highlighted.  To  connect  to  the  station,
       press  the  Connect  button.  To  transmit,  press the PTT button.  To disconnect, press the "Disconnect"
       button. In the big, white area in the middle of the window, info messages from  the  remote  station  are
       shown.  Chat  messages  from the remote station is also shown here. In the oneline white area below, chat
       messages can be typed that is sent to the remote station.

       <b>The</b> <b>Qtel</b> <b>Settings</b> <b>Dialog</b>

       The configuration dialog is brought up the first time the application is started.  Most fields  are  self
       explainatory.  Location  is  the short string that is shown in the EchoLink directory server listing. The
       info message is the one that is sent to the remote station upon connection. In the Directory  Server  tab
       are some settings for the EchoLink directory server connection.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       There are no options. Start the program within a console - qtel &amp; - or from the menu.

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       For detailed description look at <b>https://github.com/sm0svx/svxlink/wiki/QtelUserDocs</b>

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       ASYNC_AUDIO_NOTRIGGER
              Set  this  environment  variable  to  1  if  you get an error about <b>ioctl:</b> <b>Broken</b> <b>pipe</b> during qtel
              startup when using OSS audio.

       ASYNC_AUDIO_ALSA_ZEROFILL
              Set this environment variable to 0 to stop the Alsa audio code from writing  zeros  to  the  audio
              device  when  there is no audio to write available.  ASYNC_AUDIO_UDP_ZEROFILL Set this environment
              variable to 1 to enable the UDP audio code to write zeros to the UDP connection when there  is  no
              audio to write available.
