</pre><h4><b>Description</b></h4><pre>
       GNU  <u>troff</u>  transforms  <u><a href="../man7/groff.7.html">groff</a></u>(7)  language  input  into the device-independent output format described in
       <u><a href="../man5/groff_out.5.html">groff_out</a></u>(5); <u>troff</u> is thus the heart of the GNU <u>roff</u> document formatting system.  If  no  <u>file</u>  operands
       are given on the command line, or if <u>file</u> is “<b>-</b>”, the standard input stream is read.

       GNU  <u>troff</u>  is  functionally  compatible with the AT&amp;T <u>troff</u> typesetter and features numerous extensions.
       Many people prefer to use the <u><a href="../man1/groff.1.html">groff</a></u>(1) command, a front end which  also  runs  preprocessors  and  output
       drivers in the appropriate order and with appropriate options.

</pre><h4><b>Options</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-h</b>  and  <b>--help</b>  display  a  usage  message,  while  <b>-v</b>  and <b>--version</b> show version information; all exit
       afterward.

       <b>-a</b>     Generate a plain text approximation of the typeset output.  The read-only register <b>.A</b> is set to 1.
              This option produces a sort of abstract preview of the formatted output.

              • Page breaks are marked by a phrase in angle brackets; for example, “&lt;beginning of page&gt;”.

              • Lines are broken where they would be in the formatted output.

              • A horizontal motion of any size is represented as one space.  Adjacent  horizontal  motions  are
                not  combined.   Inter-sentence  space  nodes (those arising from the second argument to the <b>.ss</b>
                request) are not represented.

              • Vertical motions are not represented.

              • Special characters are rendered  in  angle  brackets;  for  example,  the  default  soft  hyphen
                character appears as “&lt;hy&gt;”.

              The  above  description  should  not  be  considered a specification; the details of <b>-a</b> output are
              subject to change.

       <b>-b</b>     Write a backtrace reporting the state of <u>troff</u>'s input parser to the standard  error  stream  with
              each  diagnostic  message.   The  line numbers given in the backtrace might not always be correct,
              because <u>troff</u>'s idea of line numbers can be confused by requests that append to macros.

       <b>-c</b>     Start with color output disabled.

       <b>-C</b>     Enable AT&amp;T <u>troff</u> compatibility mode; implies <b>-c</b>.  See <u><a href="../man7/groff_diff.7.html">groff_diff</a></u>(7).

       <b>-d</b> <u>ctext</u>
       <b>-d</b> <u>string</u><b>=</b><u>text</u>
              Define <u>roff</u> string <u>c</u> or <u>string</u> as <u>text.</u>  <u>c</u> must be one  character;  <u>string</u>  can  be  of  arbitrary
              length.   Such  string  assignments  happen before any macro file is loaded, including the startup
              file.  Due to <u><a href="../man3/getopt_long.3.html">getopt_long</a></u>(3) limitations, <u>c</u> cannot be, and <u>string</u> cannot contain, an equals  sign,
              even though that is a valid character in a <u>roff</u> identifier.

       <b>-E</b>     Inhibit  <u>troff</u>  error  messages;  implies <b>-Ww</b>.  This option does <u>not</u> suppress messages sent to the
              standard error stream by documents or macro packages using <b>tm</b> or related requests.

       <b>-f</b> <u>fam</u> Use <u>fam</u> as the default font family.

       <b>-F</b> <u>dir</u> Search in directory <u>dir</u> for the selected output device's directory of device and font  description
              files.   See  the  description  of  <u>GROFF_FONT_PATH</u> in section “Environment” below for the default
              search locations and ordering.

       <b>-i</b>     Read the standard input stream after all named input files have been processed.

       <b>-I</b> <u>dir</u> Search the directory <u>dir</u> for files (those named on the command line;  in  <b>psbb</b>,  <b>so</b>,  and  <b>soquiet</b>
              requests;  and  in  “<b>\X'ps:</b>  <b>import'</b>”, “<b>\X'ps:</b> <b>file'</b>”, and “<b>\X'pdf:</b> <b>pdfpic'</b>” device control escape
              sequences).  <b>-I</b> may be specified more than once; each <u>dir</u> is searched  in  the  given  order.   To
              search  the  current  working  directory  before  others,  add  “<b>-I</b> <b>.</b>” at the desired place; it is
              otherwise searched last.  <b>-I</b> works similarly to, and is named for, the “include” option of Unix  C
              compilers.

       <b>-m</b> <u>name</u>
              Process  the file name<u>.tmac</u> prior to any input files.  If not found, <u>tmac.</u>name is attempted.  <u>name</u>
              (in both arrangements) is presumed to be a macro file; see the description of  <u>GROFF_TMAC_PATH</u>  in
              section “Environment” below for the default search locations and ordering.

       <b>-M</b> <u>dir</u> Search  directory  <u>dir</u>  for  macro  files.   See  the  description  of  <u>GROFF_TMAC_PATH</u> in section
              “Environment” below for the default search locations and ordering.

       <b>-n</b> <u>num</u> Begin numbering pages at <u>num.</u>  The default is <b>1</b>.

       <b>-o</b> <u>list</u>
              Output only pages in <u>list,</u> which is a comma-separated list of inclusive page ranges; <u>n</u> means  page
              <u>n,</u> <u>m</u><b>-</b><u>n</u> means every page between <u>m</u> and <u>n</u>, <b>-</b><u>n</u> means every page up to <u>n</u>, and <u>n</u><b>-</b> means every page from
              <u>n</u> on.  <u>troff</u> stops processing and exits after formatting the last page enumerated in <u>list.</u>

       <b>-r</b> <u>cnumeric-expression</u>
       <b>-r</b> <u>register</u><b>=</b><u>numeric-expression</u>
              Define  <u>roff</u>  register  <u>c</u>  or  <u>register</u>  as  <u>numeric-expression.</u>   <u>c</u> must be a one-character name;
              <u>register</u> can be of arbitrary length.  Such register assignments happen before any  macro  file  is
              loaded,  including the startup file.  Due to <u><a href="../man3/getopt_long.3.html">getopt_long</a></u>(3) limitations, <u>c</u> cannot be, and <u>register</u>
              cannot contain, an equals sign, even though that is a valid character in a <u>roff</u> identifier.

       <b>-R</b>     Don't load <u>troffrc</u> and <u>troffrc-end</u>.

       <b>-T</b> <u>dev</u> Prepare output for device <u>dev.</u>  The default is <b>ps</b>; see <u><a href="../man1/groff.1.html">groff</a></u>(1).

       <b>-U</b>     Operate in <u>unsafe</u> <u>mode,</u> enabling the <b>open</b>, <b>opena</b>, <b>pi</b>, <b>pso</b>, and <b>sy</b> requests, which are disabled  by
              default  because  they  allow an untrusted input document to write to arbitrary file names and run
              arbitrary commands.  This option also adds the current directory to the macro package search path;
              see the <b>-m</b> and <b>-M</b> options above.

       <b>-w</b> <u>name</u>
       <b>-W</b> <u>name</u>
              Enable (<b>-w</b>) or inhibit (<b>-W</b>) warnings in category <u>name.</u>  See section “Warnings” below.

       <b>-z</b>     Suppress formatted output.

</pre><h4><b>Warnings</b></h4><pre>
       Warning diagnostics emitted by <u>troff</u> are divided into named, numbered categories.   The  name  associated
       with  each  warning category is used by the <b>-w</b> and <b>-W</b> options.  Each category is also assigned a power of
       two; the sum of enabled category codes is used by the <b>warn</b> request and the <b>.warn</b> register.   Warnings  of
       each category are produced under the following circumstances.

       <b>break</b>           4   A  filled  output  line  could  not  be broken such that its length was less than the
                           output line length <b>\n[.l]</b>.  This category is enabled by default.

       <b>char</b>            1   No mounted font defines a glyph  for  the  requested  character.   This  category  is
                           enabled by default.

       <b>color</b>      524288   An  undefined color name was selected, an attempt was made to define a color using an
                           unrecognized color space, an invalid component in a color definition was encountered,
                           or an attempt was made to redefine a default color.

       <b>delim</b>           8   The closing delimiter in an escape sequence was missing or mismatched.

       <b>di</b>            256   A <b>di</b>, <b>da</b>, <b>box</b>, or <b>boxa</b> request was invoked without an  argument  when  there  was  no
                           current diversion.

       <b>el</b>             16   The <b>el</b> request was encountered with no prior corresponding <b>ie</b> request.

       <b>escape</b>      32768   An unsupported escape sequence was encountered.

       <b>file</b>      1048576   An  attempt was made to load a file that does not exist.  This category is enabled by
                           default.

       <b>font</b>       131072   A non-existent font was selected,  or  the  selection  was  ignored  because  a  font
                           selection escape sequence was used after the output line continuation escape sequence
                           on an input line.  This category is enabled by default.

       <b>ig</b>         262144   An  invalid  escape  sequence  occurred  in input ignored using the <b>ig</b> request.  This
                           warning category diagnoses a condition that is an error when it occurs in non-ignored
                           input.

       <b>input</b>       16384   An invalid character occurred on the input stream.

       <b>mac</b>           512   An undefined  string,  macro,  or  diversion  was  used.   When  such  an  object  is
                           dereferenced,  an  empty one of that name is automatically created.  So, unless it is
                           later deleted, at most one warning is given for each.

                           This warning is also emitted upon an attempt to move an  unplanted  trap  macro.   In
                           such  cases, the unplanted macro is <u>not</u> dereferenced, so it is not created if it does
                           not exist.

       <b>missing</b>      8192   A request was invoked with a mandatory argument absent.

       <b>number</b>          2   An invalid numeric expression was encountered.  This category is enabled by default.

       <b>range</b>          64   A numeric expression was out of range for its context.

       <b>reg</b>          1024   An undefined register was used.  When an undefined register is  dereferenced,  it  is
                           automatically defined with a value of 0.  So, unless it is later deleted, at most one
                           warning is given for each.

       <b>right-brace</b>  4096   A right brace escape sequence <b>\}</b> was encountered where a number was expected.

       <b>scale</b>          32   A scaling unit inappropriate to its context was used in a numeric expression.

       <b>space</b>       65536   A  space  was  missing  between a request or macro and its argument.  This warning is
                           produced when an undefined name longer than two characters  is  encountered  and  the
                           first  two  characters of the name constitute a defined name.  No request is invoked,
                           no macro called, and an empty macro is not defined.   This  category  is  enabled  by
                           default.  It never occurs in compatibility mode.

       <b>syntax</b>        128   A  self-contradictory  hyphenation mode was requested; an empty or incomplete numeric
                           expression was encountered; an operand to a numeric operator was missing; an  attempt
                           was  made  to  define  a recursive, empty, or nonsensical character class; or a <u>groff</u>
                           extension conditional expression operator was used while in compatibility mode.

       <b>tab</b>          2048   A tab character was encountered where a  number  was  expected,  or  appeared  in  an
                           unquoted macro argument.

       Two warning names group other warning categories for convenience.

       <b>all</b>    All  warning  categories  except  <b>di</b>,  <b>mac</b>,  and  <b>reg</b>.   This shorthand is intended to produce all
              warnings that are useful with macro  packages  and  documents  written  for  AT&amp;T  <u>troff</u>  and  its
              descendants, which have less fastidious diagnostics than GNU <u>troff</u>.

       <b>w</b>      All warning categories.  Authors of documents and macro packages targeting <u>groff</u> are encouraged to
              use this setting.

</pre><h4><b>Environment</b></h4><pre>
       <u>GROFF_FONT_PATH</u>  and  <u>GROFF_TMAC_PATH</u>  each  accept  a  search  path  of  directories; that is, a list of
       directory names separated by the system's path component separator  character.   On  Unix  systems,  this
       character is a colon (:); on Windows systems, it is a semicolon (;).

       <u>GROFF_FONT_PATH</u>
              A  list  of directories in which to seek the selected output device's directory of device and font
              description files.  <u>troff</u> will scan directories given as arguments to  any  specified  <b>-F</b>  options
              before  these, then in a site-specific directory (<u>/usr/share/groff/site-font</u>), a standard location
              (<u><a href="file:/usr/share/groff/1.23.0/font">/usr/share/groff/1.23.0/font</a></u>), and a compatibility directory (<u>/usr/lib/font</u>) after them.

       <u>GROFF_TMAC_PATH</u>
              A list of directories in which to search for macro files.  <u>troff</u> will scan  directories  given  as
              arguments  to any specified <b>-M</b> options before these, then the current directory (only if in unsafe
              mode), the user's home directory, a site-specific directory  (<u><a href="file:/usr/share/groff/site-tmac">/usr/share/groff/site-tmac</a></u>),  and  a
              standard location (<u><a href="file:/usr/share/groff/1.23.0/tmac">/usr/share/groff/1.23.0/tmac</a></u>) after them.

       <u>GROFF_TYPESETTER</u>
              Set  the  default  output  device.   If  empty  or  not  set, <b>ps</b> is used.  The <b>-T</b> option overrides
              <u>GROFF_TYPESETTER</u>.

       <u>SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH</u>
              A timestamp (expressed as seconds since the Unix epoch) to use as the output creation timestamp in
              place of the current time.  The time is converted  to  human-readable  form  using  <u><a href="../man3/gmtime.3.html">gmtime</a></u>(3)  and
              <u><a href="../man3/asctime.3.html">asctime</a></u>(3)  when  the  formatter  starts  up and stored in registers usable by documents and macro
              packages.

       <u>TZ</u>     The time zone to use when converting the current time to human-readable form;  see  <u><a href="../man3/tzset.3.html">tzset</a></u>(3).   If
              <u>SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH</u> is used, it is always converted to human-readable form using UTC.
