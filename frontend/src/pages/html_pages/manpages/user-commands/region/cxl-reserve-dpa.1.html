       cxl-reserve-dpa - allocate device-physical address space

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>cxl</u> <u>reserve-dpa</u> &lt;mem0&gt; [&lt;mem1&gt;..&lt;memN&gt;] [&lt;options&gt;]

       The CXL region provisioning process proceeds in multiple steps. One of the steps is identifying and
       reserving the DPA span that each member of the interleave-set (region) contributes in advance of
       attaching that allocation to a region. For development, test, and debug purposes this command is a helper
       to find the next available decoder on endpoint (memdev) and mark a span of DPA as busy.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       &lt;memory device(s)&gt;
           A <u>memX</u> device name, or a memdev id number. Restrict the operation to the specified memdev(s). The
           keyword <u>all</u> can be specified to indicate the lack of any restriction.

       -S, --serial
           Rather an a memdev id number, interpret the &lt;memdev&gt; argument(s) as a list of serial numbers.

       -d, --decoder
           Specify the decoder to attempt the allocation. The CXL specification mandates that allocations must
           be ordered by DPA and decoder instance. I.e. the lowest DPA allocation on the device is covered by
           decoder0, and the last / highest DPA allocation is covered by the last decoder. This ordering is
           enforced by the kernel. By default the tool picks the <u>next</u> <u>available</u> decoder.

       -t, --type
           Select the partition for the allocation. CXL devices implement a partition that divdes <u>ram</u> and <u>pmem</u>
           capacity, where <u>pmem</u> capacity consumes the higher DPA capacity above the partition boundary. The type
           defaults to <u>pmem</u>. Note that given CXL DPA allocation constraints, once any <u>pmem</u> allocation is
           established then all remaining <u>ram</u> capacity becomes reserved (skipped).

       -f, --force
           The kernel enforces CXL DPA allocation ordering constraints, and the tool anticipates those and fails
           operations that are expected to fail without sending them to the kernel. For test purposes, continue
           to attempt "expected to fail" operations to exercise the driver.

       -s, --size
           Specify the size of the allocation. This option supports the suffixes "k" or "K" for KiB, "m" or "M"
           for MiB, "g" or "G" for GiB and "t" or "T" for TiB. This defaults to "all available capacity of the
           specified type".

       -v
           Turn on verbose debug messages in the library (if libcxl was built with logging and debug enabled).
