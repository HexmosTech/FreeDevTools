</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       dba — characterising shared regulatory regions of genomic DNA

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>dba</b> [<u>options</u> ... ]  { <u>seq1</u> <u>seq2</u> }

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       dba  -  standing  for Dna Block Aligner, was developed by Niclas Jareborg, Richard Durbin and Ewan Birney
       for characterising shared regulatory regions of genomic DNA, either in upstream  regions  or  introns  of
       genes

       The  idea  was  that  in  these  regions  there  would a series of shared motifs, perhaps with one or two
       insertions or deletions but between motifs there would be any length of sequence.

       The subsquent model was a 3 state model which was log-odd'd ratio to a  null  model  of  their  being  no
       examples of a motif in the two sequences.
