</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       ipmctl-show-region - Retrieves a list of persistent memory regions.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           ipmctl show [OPTIONS] -region [TARGETS]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Retrieves a list of persistent memory regions of PMem module capacity.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       -a, -all
           Shows all attributes.

           <b>Note</b>

           The all and display options are exclusive and may not be used together.

       -d (attributes), -display (attributes)
           Filters the returned attributes by explicitly specifying a comma separated list of any of the
           attributes defined in the Return Data section.

           <b>Note</b>

           The all and display options are exclusive and may not be used together.

       -h, -help
           Displays help for the command.

       -ddrt
           Used to specify DDRT as the desired transport protocol for the current invocation of ipmctl.

       -smbus
           Used to specify SMBUS as the desired transport protocol for the current invocation of ipmctl.

           <b>Note</b>

           The -ddrt and -smbus options are mutually exclusive and may not be used together.

       -lpmb
           Used to specify large transport payload size for the current invocation of ipmctl.

       -spmb
           Used to specify small transport payload size for the current invocation of ipmctl.

           <b>Note</b>

           The -lpmb and -spmb options are mutually exclusive and may not be used together.

       -nfit
           Used to specify NFIT table as the source instead of PCD (default) for the current invocation of
           ipmctl.

       -o (text|nvmxml), -output (text|nvmxml)
           Changes the output format. One of: "text" (default) or "nvmxml".

       -u (B|MB|MiB|GB|GiB|TB| TiB), -units (B|MB|MiB|GB|GiB|TB| TiB)
           Changes the units that capacities are displayed in for this command. One of: bytes (B), megabytes
           (MB), mebibytes (MiB), gigabytes (GB), gibibytes (GiB), terabytes (TB) or tebibytes (TiB).

</pre><h4><b>TARGETS</b></h4><pre>
       -socket [SocketIDs]
           Restricts output to the persistent memory regions on specific sockets by supplying the socket target
           and one or more comma separated socket identifiers. The default is to display all sockets.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Shows all attributes of all persistent memory regions in the server.

           ipmctl show -a -region

</pre><h4><b>LIMITATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       In order to successfully execute this command:

       •   The caller must have the appropriate privileges.

       •   All the underlying PMem modules should be unlocked to accurately reflect the available capacities.
           The specified PMem modules must be manageable by the host software.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>DATA</b></h4><pre>
       The default behavior is to display a table with the default attributes listed below; applying options
       changes the output to a more detailed format.

       ISetID
           (Default) The region unique identifier. Also known as interleave set cookie.

       PersistentMemoryType
           (Default) A comma separated list of the underlying types of persistent memory capacity in the region.
           One or more of:

           •   AppDirect: App Direct capacity interleaved across two or more PMem modules that is fully mapped
               into the system physical address space.

           •   AppDirectNotInterleaved: App Direct capacity wholly contained on a single PMem modules that is
               fully mapped into the system physical address space.

       Capacity
           (Default) Total usable capacity, both allocated and unallocated

       FreeCapacity
           (Default) Remaining usable capacity

       SocketID
           (Default) Socket ID to which the region belongs

       HealthState
           The rolled up health of the underlying PMem modules. One of:

           •   Unknown: The region health cannot be determined.

           •   Healthy: All underlying PMem module persistent memory capacity is available.

           •   Pending: A new memory allocation goal has been created but not applied. Reboot or delete any
               existing memory allocation goals before creating namespaces on the region.

           •   Error: There is an issue with some or all of the underlying PMem module capacity because the
               interleave set has failed. One of:

               •   PMem module missing (serial number of PMem module from the Platform Config Data not found in
                   the PMem module list)

               •   PMem module not configured

               •   Failure to retrieve AppDirect I/O structures from NFIT (system physical address missing)

               •   Interleave set or PMem module region initialization failure (out of memory)

           •   Locked: One or more of the of the underlying PMem modules are locked.

       DimmID
           A list of all the PMem modules that are part of this reg.
