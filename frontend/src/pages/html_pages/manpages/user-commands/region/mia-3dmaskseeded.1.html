</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       mia-3dmaskseeded - Mask an area by seeded region growing

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>mia-3dmaskseeded</b> <b>-i</b> <b>&lt;in-file&gt;</b> <b>-o</b> <b>&lt;out-file&gt;</b> <b>[options]</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>mia-3dmaskseeded</b>  3D image segmentation based on region growing from a seed point. Neighboring points are
       added, either when their intensity is equal or higher than that of the seed point, or of the intensity is
       lower or equal then that of the neighoring point. After region growing is finished, this mask is used  to
       zero out the region in the original image yielding the resulting image.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
              -i --in-file=(input, required); io
                     input image(s) to be filtered
                      For supported file types see PLUGINS:3dimage/io

              -o --out-file=(required, output); io
                     output image(s) that have been filtered
                      For supported file types see PLUGINS:3dimage/io

              -s --seed=[0,0,0]
