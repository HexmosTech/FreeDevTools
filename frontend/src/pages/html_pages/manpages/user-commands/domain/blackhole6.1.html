       <b>SCRIPTS</b>

       <b>get-mx</b>

       This script takes no further arguments, and operates as follows:

           + The tool reads domain names from standard-input (oner per line),
             and obtains the MX for the corresponding domain.

           + Lines where the first non-blank character is the numeral sign (#)
             are consdered to contain comments, and hence are ignored.

           + The format of the resulting output is:

             # DOMAIN_NAME (CANONIC_NAME)
             MX_RECORD_1
             MX_RECORD_2

       <b>get-ns</b>

       This script takes no further arguments, and operates as follows:

           + The tool reads domain names from standard-input (oner per line),
             and obtains the NS records for the corresponding domain.

           + Lines where the first non-blank character is the numeral sign (#)
             are consdered to contain comments, and hence are ignored.

           + The format of the resulting output is:

             # DOMAIN_NAME (CANONIC_NAME)
             MX_RECORD_1
             MX_RECORD_2

       <b>trace-do8-tcp</b> <b>trace-do8-icmp</b> <b>trace-do256-tcp</b> <b>trace-do256-icmp</b>

       These scripts are meant to obtain information about where in the network packets employing IPv6 Extension
       Headers  are  being dropped. They test the path with IPv6 packets containing TCP or ICMPv6 payloads and a
       Destination Options Header of 8 or 256 bytes. Based on the obtained results, the tool can infer  what  is
       the system causing the packet drops.

       <b>trace-hbh8-tcp</b> <b>trace-hbh8-icmp</b> <b>trace-hbh256-tcp</b> <b>trace-hbh256-icmp</b>

       These scripts are meant to obtain information about where in the network packets employing IPv6 Extension
       Headers  are  being dropped. They test the path with IPv6 packets containing TCP or ICMPv6 payloads and a
       Hop-by-Hop Options Header of 8 or 256 bytes. Based on the obtained results, the tool can  infer  what  is
       the system causing the packet drops.

       <b>trace-fh256-tcp</b> <b>trace-fh256-icmp</b>

       These scripts are meant to obtain information about where in the network packets employing IPv6 Extension
       Headers  are  being  dropped.  They  test  the  path  with IPv6 packets containing TCP or ICMPv6 payloads
       resulting in IPv6 fragments of around 256 bytes. Based on the obtained results, the tool can  infer  what
       is the system causing the packet drops.

       These scripts are meant to obtain information about where in the network packets employing IPv6 Extension
       Headers  are  being dropped. They test the path with IPv6 packets containing TCP or ICMPv6 payloads and a
       Destination Options Header of 8 or 256 bytes. Based on the obtained results, the tool can infer  what  is
       the  system causing the packet drops. These tools read one IPv6 address per line form standard input and,
       for each of those addresses, information is printed with the following syntax:

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       The following sections illustrate typical use cases of the <b>script6</b> tool.

       <b>Example</b> <b>#1</b>

       # scan6 -i eth0 -L -e -v

       Perform host scanning on the local network ("-L" option) using interface "eth0" ("-i" option).  Use  both
       ICMPv6  echo  requests  and  unrecognized  IPv6 options of type 10xxxxxx (default). Print link-link layer
       addresses along with IPv6 addresses ("-e" option). Be verbose ("-v" option).

       <b>Example</b> <b>#2</b>

       # scan6 -d 2001:db8::/64 --tgt-virtual-machines all --ipv4-host 10.10.10.0/24

       Scan for virtual machines (both VirtualBox and  vmware)  in  the  prefix  2001:db8::/64.  The  additional
       information about the IPv4 prefix employed by the host system is leveraged to reduce the search space.

       <b>Example</b> <b>#3</b>

       # scan6 -d 2001:db8::/64 --tgt-ipv4-embedded ipv4-32 --ipv4-host 10.10.10.0/24

       Scan  for  IPv6 addresses of the network 2001:db8::/64 that embed the IPv4 prefix 10.10.10.0/24 (with the
       32-bit encoding).

       <b>Example</b> <b>#4</b>

       # scan6 -d 2001:db8:0-500:0-1000

       Scan for IPv6 addresses of the network 2001:db8::/64, varying the two lowest order 16-bit  words  of  the
       addresses in the range 0-500 and 0-1000, respectively.

       <b>Example</b> <b>#5</b>

       # scan6 -d fc00::/64 --tgt-vendor 'Dell Inc' -p tcp

       Scan  for network devices manufactured by 'Dell Inc' in the target prefix fc00::/64. The tool will employ
       TCP segments as the probe packets (rather than the default ICMPv6 echo requests).

       <b>Example</b> <b>#6</b>

       # scan6 -i eth0 -L -S 66:55:44:33:22:11 -p unrec -P global -v

       Use the "eth0" interface ("-i" option) to perform host-scanning on the local network ("-L"  option).  The
       Ethernet  Source  Address  is  set  to  "66:55:44:33:22:11" ("-S" option). The probe packets will be IPv6
       packets with unrecognized options of type 10xxxxxx ("-p" option). The tool will only  print  IPv6  global
       addresses ("-P" option). The tool will be verbose.

       <b>Example</b> <b>#7</b>

       # scan6 -d 2001:db8::/64 -w KNOWN_IIDS

       Perform  an  address  scan  of  a  set  of  known  hosts listed in the file KNOWN_IIDS, at remote network
       2001:db8::/64. The target addresses are obtaining by concatenating the network prefix 2001:db8::/64  with
       the interface IDs of each of the addresses fund in the file KNOWN_IIDS.

       <b>Example</b> <b>#8</b>

       # scan6 -i eth0 -L -P global --print-unique -e

       Use the "eth0" interface ("-i" option) to perform host-scanning on the local network ("-L" option). Print
       only  global  unicast  addresses  ("-P"  option),  and  at  most  one  IPv6  address per Ethernet address
       ("--print-unique" option). Ethernet addresses will be printed along with the corresponiding IPv6  address
       ("-e" option).

       <b>Example</b> <b>#9</b>

       # scan6 -m knownprefixes.txt -w knowniids.txt -l -z 60 -t -v

       Build  the  list  of  targets  from  the  IPv6 prefixes contained in the file 'knownprefixes.txt' and the
       Interface IDs (IIDs) contained in the file 'knowniids.txt'. Poll the targets periodically ("-l"  option),
       and sleep 60 seconds after each iteration ("-z" option). Print a timestamp along the IPv6 address of each
       alive node ("-t" option). Be verbose ("-v" option).
