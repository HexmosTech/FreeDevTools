</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       brightd - a brightness control daemon

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>brightd</b> <b>[-v]</b> <b>[-d]</b> <b>[-P</b> <b>&lt;file&gt;]</b> <b>[-u</b> <b>n]</b> <b>[-e</b> <b>n]</b> <b>[-w</b> <b>n]</b> <b>[-b</b> <b>s]</b> <b>[-f]</b> <b>[-c</b> <b>n]</b> <b>[-x]</b> <b>[-r</b> <b>n]</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>brightd</u>  is  a  daemon  which  dynamically reduces LCD brightness when you don't use your pc. The idea is
       adapted from iBooks.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       -v     Output some debugging information. Will not work in daemon mode.

       -d     Will cause brightd to fork itself into background.  You'll want to use this ;)

       -P &lt;file&gt;
              Set location of pid file in daemon mode (Default is /var/run/brightd.pid).

       -u n   brightd will drop privileges after opening all file descriptors. With this setting you may  choose
              which user to change to.

              You  <b>have</b>  to start brightd as root; or at least as a user which might as well access X11-Sessions
              and <u>/dev/input/event</u>

       -e n   Filter used event sources by POSIX extended regexp n (for example,  use  "i8042.+event"  on  intel
              platforms  to avoid having HDAPS taken into account) You are supposed to include "event" here, but
              you are not required to.

       -w n   The amount of seconds of inactivity to wait before reducing brightness

       -b n   Dark screen brightness Never reduce brightness below that value.  Note that you won't be  able  to
              change brightness manually below this value as well.

       -f     Reduce  brightness  even  if  on the highest brightness level.  By default, brightd won't do this.
              That way you can temporally disable it while reading through a text or so.  If  you  specify  this
              option twice, brightd will also reduce brightness when you're on AC.

       -c s   Set the backlight class to use. You may specify any subdirectoy of <u><a href="file:/sys/class/backlight">/sys/class/backlight</a></u>

       -x     Don't query X11 for inactivity / deactivated screensavers

       -r n   brightd  will  create  a FIFO n (deleting the file if it existed before!) and read from it. If you
              tell your acpid to write brightness levels to that FIFO when the user changes brightness,  brightd
              can  help  you  with  some  stuff:  For example, if brightd faded to brightness 0 and you increase
              brightness, brightd would automatically fade up to the highest level.
