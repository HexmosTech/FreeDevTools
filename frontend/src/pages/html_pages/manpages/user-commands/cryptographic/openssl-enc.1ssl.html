       <b>openssl</b> <u>cipher</u> [<b>...</b>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The symmetric cipher commands allow data to be encrypted or decrypted using various block and stream
       ciphers using keys based on passwords or explicitly provided. Base64 encoding or decoding can also be
       performed either by itself or in addition to the encryption or decryption.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-</b><u><b>cipher</b></u>
           The cipher to use.

       <b>-help</b>
           Print out a usage message.

       <b>-list</b>
           List all supported ciphers.

       <b>-ciphers</b>
           Alias of -list to display all supported ciphers.

       <b>-in</b> <u>filename</u>
           The input filename, standard input by default.

       <b>-out</b> <u>filename</u>
           The output filename, standard output by default.

       <b>-pass</b> <u>arg</u>
           The password source. For more information about the format of <u>arg</u> see <b><a href="../man1/openssl-passphrase-options.1.html">openssl-passphrase-options</a></b>(1).

       <b>-e</b>  Encrypt the input data: this is the default.

       <b>-d</b>  Decrypt the input data.

       <b>-a</b>  Base64  process  the  data.  This means that if encryption is taking place the data is base64 encoded
           after encryption. If decryption is set then the input data is base64 decoded before being decrypted.

           When the <b>-A</b> option not given, on encoding a newline is inserted after  each  64  characters,  and  on
           decoding a newline is expected among the first 1024 bytes of input.

       <b>-base64</b>
           Same as <b>-a</b>

       <b>-A</b>  If  the  <b>-a</b>  option  is  set  then base64 encoding produces output without any newline character, and
           base64 decoding does not require any newlines.  Therefore it can be helpful to use the <b>-A</b> option when
           decoding unknown input.

       <b>-k</b> <u>password</u>
           The password to derive the key from. This is for compatibility with  previous  versions  of  OpenSSL.
           Superseded by the <b>-pass</b> argument.

       <b>-kfile</b> <u>filename</u>
           Read  the password to derive the key from the first line of <u>filename</u>.  This is for compatibility with
           previous versions of OpenSSL. Superseded by the <b>-pass</b> argument.

       <b>-md</b> <u>digest</u>
           Use the specified digest to create the key from the passphrase.  The default algorithm is sha-256.

       <b>-iter</b> <u>count</u>
           Use a given number of iterations on the  password  in  deriving  the  encryption  key.   High  values
           increase  the time required to brute-force the resulting file.  This option enables the use of PBKDF2
           algorithm to derive the key.

       <b>-pbkdf2</b>
           Use PBKDF2 algorithm with a default iteration count of 10000 unless otherwise specified by the  <b>-iter</b>
           command line option.

       <b>-saltlen</b>
           Set  the salt length to use when using the <b>-pbkdf2</b> option.  For compatibility reasons, the default is
           8 bytes.  The maximum value is currently 16 bytes.  If the <b>-pbkdf2</b> option  is  not  used,  then  this
           option  is  ignored  and  a fixed salt length of 8 is used. The salt length used when encrypting must
           also be used when decrypting.

       <b>-nosalt</b>
           Don't use a salt in the key derivation routines. This option <b>SHOULD</b>  <b>NOT</b>  be  used  except  for  test
           purposes or compatibility with ancient versions of OpenSSL.

       <b>-salt</b>
           Use salt (randomly generated or provide with <b>-S</b> option) when encrypting, this is the default.

       <b>-S</b> <u>salt</u>
           The  actual  salt to use: this must be represented as a string of hex digits.  If this option is used
           while encrypting, the same exact value will be needed again  during  decryption.  This  salt  may  be
           truncated or zero padded to match the salt length (See <b>-saltlen</b>).

       <b>-K</b> <u>key</u>
           The actual key to use: this must be represented as a string comprised only of hex digits. If only the
           key  is  specified,  the  IV  must additionally specified using the <b>-iv</b> option. When both a key and a
           password are specified, the key given with the <b>-K</b> option will be used and the IV generated  from  the
           password will be taken. It does not make much sense to specify both key and password.

       <b>-iv</b> <u>IV</u>
           The  actual  IV  to use: this must be represented as a string comprised only of hex digits. When only
           the key is specified using the <b>-K</b> option, the IV must explicitly be defined. When a password is being
           specified using one of the other options, the IV is generated from this password.

       <b>-p</b>  Print out the key and IV used.

       <b>-P</b>  Print out the key and IV used then immediately exit: don't do any encryption or decryption.

       <b>-bufsize</b> <u>number</u>
           Set the buffer size for I/O.

       <b>-nopad</b>
           Disable standard block padding.

       <b>-v</b>  Verbose print; display some statistics about I/O and buffer sizes.

       <b>-debug</b>
           Debug the BIOs used for I/O.

       <b>-z</b>  Compress or decompress encrypted data using zlib after encryption or before decryption.  This  option
           exists only if OpenSSL was compiled with the zlib or zlib-dynamic option.

       <b>-none</b>
           Use NULL cipher (no encryption or decryption of input).

       <b>-rand</b> <u>files</u>, <b>-writerand</b> <u>file</u>
           See "Random State Options" in <b><a href="../man1/openssl.1.html">openssl</a></b>(1) for details.

       <b>-provider</b> <u>name</u>
       <b>-provider-path</b> <u>path</u>
       <b>-propquery</b> <u>propq</u>
           See "Provider Options" in <b><a href="../man1/openssl.1.html">openssl</a></b>(1), <b><a href="../man7/provider.7.html">provider</a></b>(7), and <b><a href="../man7/property.7.html">property</a></b>(7).

       <b>-engine</b> <u>id</u>
           See "Engine Options" in <b><a href="../man1/openssl.1.html">openssl</a></b>(1).  This option is deprecated.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       The  program  can  be  called either as "openssl <u>cipher</u>" or "openssl enc -<u>cipher</u>". The first form doesn't
       work with engine-provided ciphers, because this form is processed before the configuration file  is  read
       and any ENGINEs loaded.  Use the <b><a href="../man1/openssl-list.1.html">openssl-list</a></b>(1) command to get a list of supported ciphers.

       Engines which provide entirely new encryption algorithms (such as the ccgost engine which provides gost89
       algorithm)  should  be  configured in the configuration file. Engines specified on the command line using
       <b>-engine</b> option can only be used for hardware-assisted implementations of ciphers which are  supported  by
       the OpenSSL core or another engine specified in the configuration file.

       When the enc command lists supported ciphers, ciphers provided by engines, specified in the configuration
       files are listed too.

       A password will be prompted for to derive the key and IV if necessary.

       The  <b>-salt</b>  option  should  <b>ALWAYS</b>  be  used  if the key is being derived from a password unless you want
       compatibility with previous versions of OpenSSL.

       Without the <b>-salt</b> option it is possible to perform efficient dictionary attacks on the  password  and  to
       attack  stream  cipher  encrypted  data.  The  reason for this is that without the salt the same password
       always generates the same encryption key.

       When the salt is generated at random (that means when encrypting using a passphrase without explicit salt
       given using <b>-S</b> option), the first bytes of the encrypted data are reserved to store the  salt  for  later
       decrypting.

       Some of the ciphers do not have large keys and others have security implications if not used correctly. A
       beginner is advised to just use a strong block cipher, such as AES, in CBC mode.

       All  the  block  ciphers normally use PKCS#5 padding, also known as standard block padding. This allows a
       rudimentary integrity or password check to be performed. However, since the chance of random data passing
       the test is better than 1 in 256 it isn't a very good test.

       If padding is disabled then the input data must be a multiple of the cipher block length.

       All RC2 ciphers have the same key and effective key length.

       Blowfish and RC5 algorithms use a 128 bit key.

       Please note that OpenSSL 3.0 changed the effect of the <b>-S</b> option.  Any explicit salt value specified  via
       this  option  is  no  longer  prepended  to  the ciphertext when encrypting, and must again be explicitly
       provided when decrypting.  Conversely, when the <b>-S</b> option is used during decryption,  the  ciphertext  is
       expected to not have a prepended salt value.

       When  using  OpenSSL  3.0 or later to decrypt data that was encrypted with an explicit salt under OpenSSL
       1.1.1 do not use the <b>-S</b> option, the salt will then be read from the ciphertext.  To  generate  ciphertext
       that  can  be  decrypted  with OpenSSL 1.1.1 do not use the <b>-S</b> option, the salt will be then be generated
       randomly and prepended to the output.

</pre><h4><b>SUPPORTED</b> <b>CIPHERS</b></h4><pre>
       Note that some of these ciphers can be disabled at compile  time  and  some  are  available  only  if  an
       appropriate  engine  is  configured in the configuration file. The output when invoking this command with
       the <b>-list</b> option (that is "openssl enc -list") is a  list  of  ciphers,  supported  by  your  version  of
       OpenSSL, including ones provided by configured engines.

       This  command does not support authenticated encryption modes like CCM and GCM, and will not support such
       modes in the future.  This is due to having to begin streaming output (e.g., to standard output when <b>-out</b>
       is not used) before the authentication tag could be validated.  When this command is used in a  pipeline,
       the receiving end will not be able to roll back upon authentication failure.  The AEAD modes currently in
       common  use  also  suffer  from  catastrophic  failure  of confidentiality and/or integrity upon reuse of
       key/iv/nonce, and since <b>openssl</b> <b>enc</b> places the entire burden of key/iv/nonce management  upon  the  user,
       the  risk  of exposing AEAD modes is too great to allow. These key/iv/nonce management issues also affect
       other modes currently exposed in this command, but the failure modes are less extreme in these cases, and
       the functionality cannot be removed with a stable release branch.  For bulk encryption of  data,  whether
       using  authenticated  encryption  modes  or  other modes, <b><a href="../man1/openssl-cms.1.html">openssl-cms</a></b>(1) is recommended, as it provides a
       standard data format and performs the needed key/iv/nonce management.

       When enc is used with key wrapping modes the input data cannot be streamed, meaning it must be  processed
       in  a  single  pass.   Consequently, the input data size must be less than the buffer size (-bufsize arg,
       default to 8*1024 bytes).  The '*-wrap' ciphers require the input to be  a  multiple  of  8  bytes  long,
       because  no  padding is involved.  The '*-wrap-pad' ciphers allow any input length.  In both cases, no IV
       is needed. See example below.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Just base64 encode a binary file:

        openssl base64 -in file.bin -out file.b64

       Decode the same file

        openssl base64 -d -in file.b64 -out file.bin

       Encrypt a file using AES-128 using a prompted password and PBKDF2 key derivation:

        openssl enc -aes128 -pbkdf2 -in file.txt -out file.aes128

       Decrypt a file using a supplied password:

        openssl enc -aes128 -pbkdf2 -d -in file.aes128 -out file.txt \
           -pass pass:&lt;password&gt;

       Encrypt a file then base64 encode it (so it can be sent via mail for example) using AES-256 in  CTR  mode
       and PBKDF2 key derivation:

        openssl enc -aes-256-ctr -pbkdf2 -a -in file.txt -out file.aes256

       Base64 decode a file then decrypt it using a password supplied in a file:

        openssl enc -aes-256-ctr -pbkdf2 -d -a -in file.aes256 -out file.txt \
           -pass file:&lt;passfile&gt;

       AES key wrapping:

        openssl enc -e -a -id-aes128-wrap-pad -K 000102030405060708090A0B0C0D0E0F -in file.bin
       or
        openssl aes128-wrap-pad -e -a -K 000102030405060708090A0B0C0D0E0F -in file.bin

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>-A</b> option when used with large files doesn't work properly.  On the other hand, when base64 decoding
       without the <b>-A</b> option, if the first 1024 bytes of input do not include a newline character the first  two
       lines of input are ignored.

       The  <b>openssl</b>  <b>enc</b>  command only supports a fixed number of algorithms with certain parameters. So if, for
       example, you want to use RC2 with a 76 bit key or RC4 with an 84 bit key you can't use this program.

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       The default digest was changed from MD5 to SHA256 in OpenSSL 1.1.0.

       The <b>-list</b> option was added in OpenSSL 1.1.1e.

       The <b>-ciphers</b> and <b>-engine</b> options were deprecated in OpenSSL 3.0.

       The <b>-saltlen</b> option was added in OpenSSL 3.2.
