</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       h2pas - The C header to pascal unit conversion program.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>h2pas</b> <u>[options]</u> <u>filename</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>h2pas</b>  attempts  to  convert  a C header file to a pascal unit.  it can handle most C constructs that one
       finds in a C header file, and attempts to translate them to their pascal counterparts. see the <b>CONSTRUCTS</b>
       section for a full description of what the translator can handle.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       H2pas is a command-line tool that translates a C header file to a spascal unit. It  reads  the  C  header
       file  and translates the C declarations to equivalent pascal declarations that can be used to access code
       written in C.

       The output of the h2pas program is written to a file with the same name as the C  header  file  that  was
       used  as  input,  but  with the extension <u>.pp</u>.  The output file that h2pas creates can be customized in a
       number of ways by means of many options.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The output of <b>h2pas</b> can be controlled with the following options:

       <b>-d</b>     use <u>external;</u> for all procedure and function declarations.

       <b>-D</b>     use <b>external</b> <u>libname</u> <b>name</b> <u>'func_name'</u> for function and procedure declarations.

       <b>-e</b>     Emit a series of constants instead of an enumeration type for the C <u>enum</u> construct.

       <b>-i</b>     create an include file instead of a unit (omits the unit header).

       <b>-l</b> <u>libname</u>
              specify the library name for external function declarations.

       <b>-o</b> <u>outfile</u>
              Specify the output file name. Default is the input file name with the extension  replaced  by  <u>.pp</u>
              "."

       <b>-p</b>     use the letter <b>P</b> in front of pointer type parameters instead of "^".

       <b>-s</b>     Strip comments from the input file. By default comments are converted to comments, but they may be
              displaced, since a comment is handled by the scanner.

       <b>-t</b>     prepend  typedef  type names with the letter <b>T</b> (used to follow Borland's convention that all types
              should be defined with T).

       <b>-v</b>     replace pointer parameters by call by reference parameters.  Use with care because some calls  can
              expect a NIL pointer.

       <b>-w</b>     Header file is a win32 header file (adds support for some special macros).

       <b>-x</b>     handle SYS_TRAP of the PalmOS header files.

</pre><h4><b>CONSTRUCTS</b></h4><pre>
       The following C declarations and statements are recognized:

       <b>defines</b>
              defines  are  changed  into  pascal  constants  if  they are simple defines.  macros are changed -
              wherever possible to functions; however the arguments are all integers, so these must  be  changed
              manually.  Simple expressions in define staments are recognized, as are most arithmetic operators:
              addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, logical operators,  comparison  operators,  shift
              operators.  The  C  construct ( A ? B : C) is also recognized and translated to a pascal construct
              with an IF statement (this is buggy, however).

       <b>preprocessor</b> <b>statements</b>
              the conditional preprocessing commands  are  recognized  and  translated  into  equivalent  pascal
              compiler directives. The special <b>#ifdef</b> <b>__cplusplus</b> is also recognized and removed.

       <b>typedef</b>
              A  typedef  statement  is  changed  into  a  pascal  type statement. The following basic types are
              recognized:

              <u>char</u>   changed to char.

              <u>float</u>  changed to real (=double in free pascal).

              <u>int</u>    changed to longint.

              <u>long</u>   changed to longint.

              <u>long</u> <u>int</u>
                     changed to longint.

              <u>short</u>  changed to integer.

              <u>unsigned</u>
                     changed to cardinal.

              <u>unsigned</u> <u>char</u>
                     changed to byte.

              <u>unsigned</u> <u>int</u>
                     changed to cardinal.

              <u>unsigned</u> <u>long</u> <u>int</u>
                     changed to cardinal.

              <u>unsigned</u> <u>short</u>
                     changed to word.

              <u>void</u>   ignored.
       These types are also changed if they appear in the arguments of a function or procedure.

       <b>functions</b> <b>and</b> <b>procedures</b>
              functions and procedures are translated as well; pointer types may be changed to call by reference
              arguments (using the <b>var</b> argument) by using the <b>-p</b> command line argument. functions  that  have  a
              variable number of arguments are changed to a function with an <b>array</b> <b>of</b> <b>const</b> argument.

       <b>specifiers</b>
              the <u>extern</u> specifier is recognized; however it is ignored. the <u>packed</u> specifier is also recognised
              and  changed  with  the  <u>PACKRECORDS</u>  directive.  The  <u>const</u>  specifier is also recognized, but is
              ignored.

       <b>modifiers</b>
              If the <b>-w</b> option is specified, then the following modifiers are  recognized:  <u>STDCALL</u>  ,  <u>CDECL</u>  ,
              <u>CALLBACK</u>  ,  <u>PASCAL</u>  ,  <u>WINAPI</u>  ,  <u>APIENTRY</u>  ,  <u>WINGDIAPI</u>  as  defined  in  the win32 headers.  If
              additionally the <b>-x</b> option is specified then the <u>SYS_TRAP</u> specifier is also recognized.

       <b>enums</b>  enum constructs are changed into enumeration types; bear in mind that in C enumeration  types  can
              have  values  assigned to them; Free Pascal also allows this to a certain degree. If you know that
              values are assigned to enums, it is best to use the <b>-e</b> option to change the enus to  a  series  of
              integer constants.

       <b>unions</b> unions are changed to variant records.

       <b>structs</b>
              are changed to pascal records, with <b>C</b> packing.
