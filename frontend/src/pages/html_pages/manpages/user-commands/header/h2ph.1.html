</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       h2ph - convert .h C header files to .ph Perl header files

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>h2ph</b> <b>[-d</b> <b>destination</b> <b>directory]</b> <b>[-r</b> <b>|</b> <b>-a]</b> <b>[-l]</b> <b>[-h]</b> <b>[-e]</b> <b>[-D]</b> <b>[-Q]</b> <b>[headerfiles]</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>h2ph</u> converts any C header files specified to the corresponding Perl header file format.  It is most
       easily run while in <a href="file:/usr/include">/usr/include</a>:

               cd <a href="file:/usr/include">/usr/include</a>; h2ph * sys/*

       or

               cd <a href="file:/usr/include">/usr/include</a>; h2ph * sys/* arpa/* netinet/*

       or

               cd <a href="file:/usr/include">/usr/include</a>; h2ph -r -l .

       The output files are placed in the hierarchy rooted at Perl's architecture dependent library directory.
       You can specify a different hierarchy with a <b>-d</b> switch.

       If run with no arguments, filters standard input to standard output.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       -d destination_dir
           Put  the  resulting  <b>.ph</b>  files  beneath <b>destination_dir</b>, instead of beneath the default Perl library
           location ($Config{'installsitearch'}).

       -r  Run recursively; if any of <b>headerfiles</b>  are  directories,  then  run  <u>h2ph</u>  on  all  files  in  those
           directories (and their subdirectories, etc.).  <b>-r</b> and <b>-a</b> are mutually exclusive.

       -a  Run automagically; convert <b>headerfiles</b>, as well as any <b>.h</b> files which they include.  This option will
           search for <b>.h</b> files in all directories which your C compiler ordinarily uses.  <b>-a</b> and <b>-r</b> are mutually
           exclusive.

       -l  Symbolic  links  will be replicated in the destination directory.  If <b>-l</b> is not specified, then links
           are skipped over.

       -h  Put 'hints' in the .ph files which will help in locating problems with <u>h2ph</u>.  In those cases when you
           <b>require</b> a <b>.ph</b> file containing syntax errors, instead of the cryptic

                   [ some error condition ] at (eval mmm) line nnn

           you will see the slightly more helpful

                   [ some error condition ] at filename.ph line nnn

           However, the <b>.ph</b> files almost double in size when built using <b>-h</b>.

       -e  If an error is encountered during conversion, output file will  be  removed  and  a  warning  emitted
           instead of terminating the conversion immediately.

       -D  Include the code from the <b>.h</b> file as a comment in the <b>.ph</b> file.  This is primarily used for debugging
           <u>h2ph</u>.

       -Q  'Quiet' mode; don't print out the names of the files being converted.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       No environment variables are used.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
        <a href="file:/usr/include/">/usr/include/</a>*.h
        /usr/include/sys/*.h

       etc.

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       The usual warnings if it can't read or write the files involved.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Doesn't construct the %sizeof array for you.

       It  doesn't  handle all C constructs, but it does attempt to isolate definitions inside evals so that you
       can get at the definitions that it can translate.

       It's only intended as a rough tool.  You may need to dicker with the files produced.

       You have to run this program by hand; it's not run as part of the Perl installation.

       Doesn't handle complicated expressions built piecemeal, a la:

           enum {
               FIRST_VALUE,
               SECOND_VALUE,
           #ifdef ABC
               THIRD_VALUE
           #endif
           };

       Doesn't necessarily locate all of your C compiler's internally-defined symbols.
