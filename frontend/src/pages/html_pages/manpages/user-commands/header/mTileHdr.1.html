</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       mTileHdr - Create a set of tiled images or header templates from a FITS file or header

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       mTileHdr [-d] [-s <u>statusfile</u>] orig.hdr new.hdr nx ny ix iy [xpad [ypad]]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Takes  a header template file and creates another which represents one of a regular set of tiles covering
       the original.  The user specifies the tile gridding and which tile is desired.

       Only the NAXIS and CRVAL keyword lines are changed (pixel size and reference point location);  all  other
       keyword values will be inherited from the input header.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       -d     Turns on debugging.

       -s <u>statusfile</u>
              Output and errors are sent to <u>statusfile</u> instead of to stdout

</pre><h4><b>ARGUMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       orig.hdr
              ASCII header template from which to derive tiled headers

       new.hdr
              Path to output header

       nx     Number of tiles in the x-direction

       ny     Number of tiles in the y-direction

       ix     Integer identifying the x location of the output tile on the grid (counting from 0)

       iy     Integer identifying the y location of the output tile on the grid (counting from 0)

       xpad   Number of pixels to overlap tiles in the x direction (optional; default is 0)

       ypad   Number of pixels to overlap tiles in the y direction (optional; default is 0)

</pre><h4><b>RESULT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>[struct</b> <b>stat="OK",</b> <b>naxis1=</b><u>xsize</u><b>,</b> <b>naxis1=</b><u>ysize</u><b>,</b> <b>crpix1=</b><u>xref</u><b>,</b> <b>crpix2=</b><u>yref</u><b>]</b>

       Where  <u>xsize</u> and <u>ysize</u> are the x and y dimensions of the image described by the output header, and <u>crpix1</u>
       and <u>crpix2</u> are the new offset from the original reference pixel on the sky.

</pre><h4><b>MESSAGES</b></h4><pre>
       OK     [struct stat="OK", naxis1=<u>xsize</u>, naxis2=<u>ysize</u>, crpix1=<u>xref</u>, crpix2=<u>yref</u>]

       ERROR  Cannot open status file: <u>statusfile</u>

       ERROR  (nx,ny) have to be positive integers and (ix,iy) have to be in the range (0..nx-1, 0..ny-1)

       ERROR  Cannot open output template <u>new.hdr</u>

       ERROR  Bad template:<u>orig.hdr</u>

       ERROR  Bad template:<u>new.hdr</u>

       ERROR  Output wcsinit() failed.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       template.hdr is 850x850 pixels, and we want to generate the center tile out of 9 (3 by 3):

       $ mTileHdr template.hdr tile_1_1.hdr 3 3 1 1
              [struct stat="OK", naxis1=283, naxis2=283, crpix1=-283, crpix2=-283]

       tile_1_1.hdr has the same reference location and pixel scale as the input header, but a new pixel  offset
       (CRPIX) and size (NAXIS).

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       The drizzle algorithm has been implemented but has not been tested in this release.

       If a header template contains carriage returns (i.e., created/modified on a Windows machine), the cfitsio
       library  will  be  unable  to read it properly, resulting in the error: [struct stat="ERROR", status=207,
       msg="illegal character in keyword"]

       It is best for the background correction  algorithms  if  the  area  described  in  the  header  template
       completely encloses all of the input images in their entirety. If parts of input images are "chopped off"
       by  the  header  template,  the  background correction will be affected. We recommend you use an expanded
       header for the reprojection and background modeling steps, returning to  the  originally  desired  header
       size  for  the  final  coaddition.  The  default background matching assumes that there are no non-linear
       background variations in the individual images (and therefore in the overlap differences).  If  there  is
       any  uncertainty  in  this  regard, it is safer to turn on the "level only" background matching (the "-l"
       flag in mBgModel.
