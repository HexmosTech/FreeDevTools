               <u>objfile</u>...

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>objdump</b> displays information about one or more object files.  The options control what particular
       information to display.  This information is mostly useful to programmers who are working on the
       compilation tools, as opposed to programmers who just want their program to compile and work.

       <u>objfile</u>... are the object files to be examined.  When you specify archives, <b>objdump</b> shows information on
       each of the member object files.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The long and short forms of options, shown here as alternatives, are equivalent.  At least one option
       from the list <b>-a,-d,-D,-e,-f,-g,-G,-h,-H,-p,-r,-R,-s,-S,-t,-T,-V,-x</b> must be given.

       <b>-a</b>
       <b>--archive-header</b>
           If any of the <u>objfile</u> files are archives, display the archive header information (in a format similar
           to  <b>ls</b>  <b>-l</b>).   Besides  the  information  you could list with <b>ar</b> <b>tv</b>, <b>objdump</b> <b>-a</b> shows the object file
           format of each archive member.

       <b>--adjust-vma=</b><u>offset</u>
           When dumping information, first add <u>offset</u> to all the section  addresses.   This  is  useful  if  the
           section  addresses  do  not correspond to the symbol table, which can happen when putting sections at
           particular addresses when using a format which can not represent section addresses, such as a.out.

       <b>-b</b> <u>bfdname</u>
       <b>--target=</b><u>bfdname</u>
           Specify that the object-code format for the  object  files  is  <u>bfdname</u>.   This  option  may  not  be
           necessary; <u>objdump</u> can automatically recognize many formats.

           For example,

                   objdump -b oasys -m vax -h fu.o

           displays  summary  information  from the section headers (<b>-h</b>) of <u>fu.o</u>, which is explicitly identified
           (<b>-m</b>) as a VAX object file in the format produced by  Oasys  compilers.   You  can  list  the  formats
           available with the <b>-i</b> option.

       <b>-C</b>
       <b>--demangle[=</b><u>style</u><b>]</b>
           Decode  (<u>demangle</u>)  low-level  symbol  names  into  user-level  names.   Besides removing any initial
           underscore prepended by the system, this makes C++ function names readable.  Different compilers have
           different mangling styles.  The  optional  demangling  style  argument  can  be  used  to  choose  an
           appropriate demangling style for your compiler.

       <b>-g</b>
       <b>--debugging</b>
           Display  debugging  information.   This attempts to parse STABS and IEEE debugging format information
           stored in the file and print it out using a C like syntax.  If neither of  these  formats  are  found
           this option falls back on the <b>-W</b> option to print any DWARF information in the file.

       <b>-e</b>
       <b>--debugging-tags</b>
           Like <b>-g</b>, but the information is generated in a format compatible with ctags tool.

       <b>-d</b>
       <b>--disassemble</b>
           Display  the  assembler  mnemonics  for  the  machine  instructions  from  <u>objfile</u>.  This option only
           disassembles those sections which are expected to contain instructions.

       <b>-D</b>
       <b>--disassemble-all</b>
           Like <b>-d</b>, but  disassemble  the  contents  of  all  sections,  not  just  those  expected  to  contain
           instructions.

           If  the  target is an ARM architecture this switch also has the effect of forcing the disassembler to
           decode pieces of data found in code sections as if they were instructions.

       <b>--prefix-addresses</b>
           When disassembling, print the complete address on each line.  This is the older disassembly format.

       <b>-EB</b>
       <b>-EL</b>
       <b>--endian={big|little}</b>
           Specify the endianness of the object files.  This only affects disassembly.  This can be useful  when
           disassembling a file format which does not describe endianness information, such as S-records.

       <b>-f</b>
       <b>--file-headers</b>
           Display summary information from the overall header of each of the <u>objfile</u> files.

       <b>-F</b>
       <b>--file-offsets</b>
           When  disassembling  sections,  whenever  a  symbol is displayed, also display the file offset of the
           region of data that is about to be dumped.  If  zeroes  are  being  skipped,  then  when  disassembly
           resumes,  tell  the  user how many zeroes were skipped and the file offset of the location from where
           the disassembly resumes.  When dumping sections, display the file offset of the location  from  where
           the dump starts.

       <b>--file-start-context</b>
           Specify  that  when  displaying interlisted source code/disassembly (assumes <b>-S</b>) from a file that has
           not yet been displayed, extend the context to the start of the file.

       <b>-h</b>
       <b>--section-headers</b>
       <b>--headers</b>
           Display summary information from the section headers of the object file.

           File segments may be relocated to nonstandard addresses, for example by using the <b>-Ttext</b>, <b>-Tdata</b>,  or
           <b>-Tbss</b>  options  to  <b>ld</b>.   However, some object file formats, such as a.out, do not store the starting
           address of the file segments.  In those situations, although <b>ld</b>  relocates  the  sections  correctly,
           using  <b>objdump</b>  <b>-h</b>  to  list the file section headers cannot show the correct addresses.  Instead, it
           shows the usual addresses, which are implicit for the target.

       <b>-H</b>
       <b>--help</b>
           Print a summary of the options to <b>objdump</b> and exit.

       <b>-i</b>
       <b>--info</b>
           Display a list showing all architectures and object formats available for specification  with  <b>-b</b>  or
           <b>-m</b>.

       <b>-j</b> <u>name</u>
       <b>--section=</b><u>name</u>
           Display information only for section <u>name</u>.

       <b>-l</b>
       <b>--line-numbers</b>
           Label  the  display  (using  debugging  information)  with  the  filename  and  source  line  numbers
           corresponding to the object code or relocs shown.  Only useful with <b>-d</b>, <b>-D</b>, or <b>-r</b>.

       <b>-m</b> <u>machine</u>
       <b>--architecture=</b><u>machine</u>
           Specify the  architecture  to  use  when  disassembling  object  files.   This  can  be  useful  when
           disassembling  object  files  which do not describe architecture information, such as S-records.  You
           can list the available architectures with the <b>-i</b> option.

           If the target is an ARM architecture then this switch has an additional  effect.   It  restricts  the
           disassembly  to only those instructions supported by the architecture specified by <u>machine</u>.  If it is
           necessary to use this switch because the input file does not contain  any  architecture  information,
           but it is also desired to disassemble all the instructions use <b>-marm</b>.

       <b>-M</b> <u>options</u>
       <b>--disassembler-options=</b><u>options</u>
           Pass  target  specific  information  to  the disassembler.  Only supported on some targets.  If it is
           necessary to specify more than one disassembler option then multiple <b>-M</b> options can be used or can be
           placed together into a comma separated list.

           If the target is an ARM architecture then this switch can be used to select which register  name  set
           is  used  during  disassembler.   Specifying  <b>-M</b> <b>reg-names-std</b> (the default) will select the register
           names as used in ARM's instruction set documentation, but with register 13 called 'sp',  register  14
           called  'lr' and register 15 called 'pc'.  Specifying <b>-M</b> <b>reg-names-apcs</b> will select the name set used
           by the ARM Procedure Call Standard, whilst specifying <b>-M</b> <b>reg-names-raw</b> will just use  <b>r</b>  followed  by
           the register number.

           There  are  also two variants on the APCS register naming scheme enabled by <b>-M</b> <b>reg-names-atpcs</b> and <b>-M</b>
           <b>reg-names-special-atpcs</b> which use the ARM/Thumb Procedure Call Standard naming conventions.   (Either
           with the normal register names or the special register names).

           This  option  can  also  be  used  for  ARM  architectures to force the disassembler to interpret all
           instructions as Thumb instructions by using the switch <b>--disassembler-options=force-thumb</b>.  This  can
           be useful when attempting to disassemble thumb code produced by other compilers.

           For  the  x86,  some  of  the  options  duplicate functions of the <b>-m</b> switch, but allow finer grained
           control.  Multiple selections from the following may  be  specified  as  a  comma  separated  string.
           <b>x86-64</b>,  <b>i386</b>  and <b>i8086</b> select disassembly for the given architecture.  <b>intel</b> and <b>att</b> select between
           intel syntax mode and AT&amp;T  syntax  mode.   <b>intel-mnemonic</b>  and  <b>att-mnemonic</b>  select  between  intel
           mnemonic  mode  and  AT&amp;T  mnemonic  mode. <b>intel-mnemonic</b> implies <b>intel</b> and <b>att-mnemonic</b> implies <b>att</b>.
           <b>addr64</b>, <b>addr32</b>, <b>addr16</b>, <b>data32</b> and <b>data16</b> specify the default address size and operand  size.   These
           four  options will be overridden if <b>x86-64</b>, <b>i386</b> or <b>i8086</b> appear later in the option string.  Lastly,
           <b>suffix</b>, when in AT&amp;T mode, instructs the disassembler to print a mnemonic suffix even when the suffix
           could be inferred by the operands.

           For PowerPC, <b>booke</b> controls the disassembly of BookE instructions.  <b>32</b>  and  <b>64</b>  select  PowerPC  and
           PowerPC64  disassembly,  respectively.   <b>e300</b>  selects  disassembly for the e300 family.  <b>440</b> selects
           disassembly for the PowerPC 440.  <b>ppcps</b> selects disassembly for the paired single instructions of the
           PPC750CL.

           For MIPS, this option controls the printing of instruction  mnemonic  names  and  register  names  in
           disassembled  instructions.   Multiple  selections  from  the  following  may be specified as a comma
           separated string, and invalid options are ignored:

           "no-aliases"
               Print the 'raw' instruction mnemonic instead of some pseudo instruction  mnemonic.   I.e.,  print
               'daddu' or 'or' instead of 'move', 'sll' instead of 'nop', etc.

           "gpr-names=<u>ABI</u>"
               Print GPR (general-purpose register) names as appropriate for the specified ABI.  By default, GPR
               names are selected according to the ABI of the binary being disassembled.

           "fpr-names=<u>ABI</u>"
               Print  FPR (floating-point register) names as appropriate for the specified ABI.  By default, FPR
               numbers are printed rather than names.

           "cp0-names=<u>ARCH</u>"
               Print CP0 (system control coprocessor; coprocessor 0) register names as appropriate for  the  CPU
               or  architecture specified by <u>ARCH</u>.  By default, CP0 register names are selected according to the
               architecture and CPU of the binary being disassembled.

           "hwr-names=<u>ARCH</u>"
               Print HWR (hardware register, used by the "rdhwr" instruction) names as appropriate for  the  CPU
               or  architecture  specified  by  <u>ARCH</u>.   By  default,  HWR  names  are  selected according to the
               architecture and CPU of the binary being disassembled.

           "reg-names=<u>ABI</u>"
               Print GPR and FPR names as appropriate for the selected ABI.

           "reg-names=<u>ARCH</u>"
               Print CPU-specific register names (CP0 register and HWR names) as appropriate  for  the  selected
               CPU or architecture.

           For  any of the options listed above, <u>ABI</u> or <u>ARCH</u> may be specified as <b>numeric</b> to have numbers printed
           rather than names, for the selected types of registers.  You can list the available values of <u>ABI</u> and
           <u>ARCH</u> using the <b>--help</b> option.

           For VAX, you can specify function entry addresses with <b>-M</b> <b>entry:0xf00ba</b>.  You can use  this  multiple
           times to properly disassemble VAX binary files that don't contain symbol tables (like ROM dumps).  In
           these  cases,  the  function  entry  mask would otherwise be decoded as VAX instructions, which would
           probably lead the rest of the function being wrongly disassembled.

       <b>-p</b>
       <b>--private-headers</b>
           Print information that is specific to the object file format.  The exact information printed  depends
           upon the object file format.  For some object file formats, no additional information is printed.

       <b>-r</b>
       <b>--reloc</b>
           Print  the  relocation  entries  of  the  file.   If  used with <b>-d</b> or <b>-D</b>, the relocations are printed
           interspersed with the disassembly.

       <b>-R</b>
       <b>--dynamic-reloc</b>
           Print the dynamic relocation entries of the file.  This is only meaningful for dynamic objects,  such
           as  certain types of shared libraries.  As for <b>-r</b>, if used with <b>-d</b> or <b>-D</b>, the relocations are printed
           interspersed with the disassembly.

       <b>-s</b>
       <b>--full-contents</b>
           Display the full contents  of  any  sections  requested.   By  default  all  non-empty  sections  are
           displayed.

       <b>-S</b>
       <b>--source</b>
           Display source code intermixed with disassembly, if possible.  Implies <b>-d</b>.

       <b>--prefix=</b><u>prefix</u>
           Specify <u>prefix</u> to add to the absolute paths when used with <b>-S</b>.

       <b>--prefix-strip=</b><u>level</u>
           Indicate how many initial directory names to strip off the hardwired absolute paths. It has no effect
           without <b>--prefix=</b><u>prefix</u>.

       <b>--show-raw-insn</b>
           When  disassembling  instructions, print the instruction in hex as well as in symbolic form.  This is
           the default except when <b>--prefix-addresses</b> is used.

       <b>--no-show-raw-insn</b>
           When disassembling instructions, do not print the  instruction  bytes.   This  is  the  default  when
           <b>--prefix-addresses</b> is used.

       <b>--insn-width=</b><u>width</u>
           Display <u>width</u> bytes on a single line when disassembling instructions.

       <b>-W[lLiaprmfFsoRt]</b>
       <b>--dwarf[=rawline,=decodedline,=info,=abbrev,=pubnames,=aranges,=macro,=frames,=frames-interp,=str,=loc,=Ranges,=pubtypes,=trace_info,=trace_abbrev,=trace_aranges,=gdb_index]</b>
           Displays  the contents of the debug sections in the file, if any are present.  If one of the optional
           letters or words follows the switch then only data found in those specific sections will be dumped.

           Note that there is no single letter option to display the content of trace sections or .gdb_index.

       <b>-G</b>
       <b>--stabs</b>
           Display the full contents of  any  sections  requested.   Display  the  contents  of  the  .stab  and
           .stab.index  and  .stab.excl  sections  from  an  ELF  file.  This is only useful on systems (such as
           Solaris 2.0) in which ".stab" debugging symbol-table entries are carried in an ELF section.  In  most
           other  file  formats,  debugging  symbol-table  entries are interleaved with linkage symbols, and are
           visible in the <b>--syms</b> output.

       <b>--start-address=</b><u>address</u>
           Start displaying data at the specified address.  This affects  the  output  of  the  <b>-d</b>,  <b>-r</b>  and  <b>-s</b>
           options.

       <b>--stop-address=</b><u>address</u>
           Stop displaying data at the specified address.  This affects the output of the <b>-d</b>, <b>-r</b> and <b>-s</b> options.

       <b>-t</b>
       <b>--syms</b>
           Print  the  symbol  table entries of the file.  This is similar to the information provided by the <b>nm</b>
           program, although the display format is different.  The format of the output depends upon the  format
           of the file being dumped, but there are two main types.  One looks like this:

                   [  4](sec  3)(fl 0x00)(ty   0)(scl   3) (nx 1) 0x00000000 .bss
                   [  6](sec  1)(fl 0x00)(ty   0)(scl   2) (nx 0) 0x00000000 fred

           where  the  number inside the square brackets is the number of the entry in the symbol table, the <u>sec</u>
           number is the section number, the <u>fl</u> value are the symbol's flag bits, the <u>ty</u> number is the  symbol's
           type, the <u>scl</u> number is the symbol's storage class and the <u>nx</u> value is the number of auxilary entries
           associated with the symbol.  The last two fields are the symbol's value and its name.

           The other common output format, usually seen with ELF based files, looks like this:

                   00000000 l    d  .bss   00000000 .bss
                   00000000 g       .text  00000000 fred

           Here the first number is the symbol's value (sometimes refered to as its address).  The next field is
           actually  a  set of characters and spaces indicating the flag bits that are set on the symbol.  These
           characters are described below.  Next is the section with which the symbol is associated or <u>*ABS*</u>  if
           the section is absolute (ie not connected with any section), or <u>*UND*</u> if the section is referenced in
           the file being dumped, but not defined there.

           After  the  section name comes another field, a number, which for common symbols is the alignment and
           for other symbol is the size.  Finally the symbol's name is displayed.

           The flag characters are divided into 7 groups as follows:

           "l"
           "g"
           "u"
           "!" The symbol is a local (l), global (g), unique global (u), neither global nor local (a  space)  or
               both  global  and  local  (!).  A symbol can be neither local or global for a variety of reasons,
               e.g., because it is used for debugging, but it is probably an indication of a bug if it  is  ever
               both  local  and  global.   Unique  global symbols are a GNU extension to the standard set of ELF
               symbol bindings.  For such a symbol the dynamic linker will make sure that in the entire  process
               there is just one symbol with this name and type in use.

           "w" The symbol is weak (w) or strong (a space).

           "C" The symbol denotes a constructor (C) or an ordinary symbol (a space).

           "W" The  symbol  is a warning (W) or a normal symbol (a space).  A warning symbol's name is a message
               to be displayed if the symbol following the warning symbol is ever referenced.

           "I"
           "i" The symbol is an indirect reference to another symbol (I), a  function  to  be  evaluated  during
               reloc processing (i) or a normal symbol (a space).

           "d"
           "D" The symbol is a debugging symbol (d) or a dynamic symbol (D) or a normal symbol (a space).

           "F"
           "f"
           "O" The  symbol  is the name of a function (F) or a file (f) or an object (O) or just a normal symbol
               (a space).

       <b>-T</b>
       <b>--dynamic-syms</b>
           Print the dynamic symbol table entries of the file.  This is only  meaningful  for  dynamic  objects,
           such  as  certain  types  of shared libraries.  This is similar to the information provided by the <b>nm</b>
           program when given the <b>-D</b> (<b>--dynamic</b>) option.

       <b>--special-syms</b>
           When displaying symbols include those which the target considers to be special in some way and  which
           would not normally be of interest to the user.

       <b>-V</b>
       <b>--version</b>
           Print the version number of <b>objdump</b> and exit.

       <b>-x</b>
       <b>--all-headers</b>
           Display  all  available header information, including the symbol table and relocation entries.  Using
           <b>-x</b> is equivalent to specifying all of <b>-a</b> <b>-f</b> <b>-h</b> <b>-p</b> <b>-r</b> <b>-t</b>.

       <b>-w</b>
       <b>--wide</b>
           Format some lines for output devices that have more than 80 columns.  Also  do  not  truncate  symbol
           names when they are displayed.

       <b>-z</b>
       <b>--disassemble-zeroes</b>
           Normally  the disassembly output will skip blocks of zeroes.  This option directs the disassembler to
           disassemble those blocks, just like any other data.

       <b>@</b><u>file</u>
           Read command-line options from <u>file</u>.  The options read are inserted in place of  the  original  @<u>file</u>
           option.   If  <u>file</u>  does not exist, or cannot be read, then the option will be treated literally, and
           not removed.

           Options in <u>file</u> are separated by whitespace.  A whitespace character may be included in an option  by
           surrounding  the  entire  option  in  either  single  or  double  quotes.  Any character (including a
           backslash) may be included by prefixing the character to be included with a backslash.  The <u>file</u>  may
           itself contain additional @<u>file</u> options; any such options will be processed recursively.
