       mcat - dump raw disk image

</pre><h4><b>Note</b> <b>of</b> <b>warning</b></h4><pre>
       This  manpage  has  been  automatically  generated  from  mtools's  texinfo documentation, and may not be
       entirely accurate or complete.  See the end of this man page for details.

</pre><h4><b>Description</b></h4><pre>
       The mcat command is used to copy an entire disk image from or to the floppy device. It uses the following
       syntax:

       mcat [-w] <u>drive</u>:

       Mcat performs the same task as the Unix cat command. It is included into the mtools  package,  since  cat
       cannot  access  remote  floppy devices offered by the mtools floppy daemon.  Now it is possible to create
       boot floppies remotely.

       The default operation is reading. The output is written to stdout.

       If the -w option is specified, mcat reads a disk-image from stdin and writes it to the given device.  <b>Use</b>
       <b>this</b> <b>carefully!</b> Because of the low-level nature of this command, it will happily destroy any data written
       before on the disk without warning!

</pre><h4><b>Viewing</b> <b>the</b> <b>texi</b> <b>doc</b></h4><pre>
       This manpage has been automatically generated from mtools's texinfo documentation. However, this  process
       is  only  approximative,  and some items, such as crossreferences, footnotes and indices are lost in this
       translation process.  Indeed, these items have no  appropriate  representation  in  the  manpage  format.
       Moreover,  not  all information has been translated into the manpage version.  Thus I strongly advise you
       to use the original texinfo doc.  See the end of this manpage for instructions how to  view  the  texinfo
       doc.

       *      To generate a printable copy from the texinfo doc, run the following commands:

                     <b>./configure;</b> <b>make</b> <b>dvi;</b> <b>dvips</b> <b>mtools.dvi</b>

       *      To generate a html copy,  run:

                     <b>./configure;</b> <b>make</b> <b>html</b>

       A premade html can be found at `<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/mtools/manual/mtools.html">http://www.gnu.org/software/mtools/manual/mtools.html</a>'

       *      To generate an info copy (browsable using emacs' info mode), run:

                     <b>./configure;</b> <b>make</b> <b>info</b>

       The  texinfo doc looks most pretty when printed or as html.  Indeed, in the info version certain examples
       are difficult to read due to the quoting conventions used in info.
