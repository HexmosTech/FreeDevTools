</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       pev - Qualcomm Atheros Plug-in Electric Vehicle Emulator

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>pev</b> [<u>options</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Emulate  the PEV part of the HomePlug AV Signal Level Attentuation Characterization (SLAC) protocol where
       a <b>PEV</b> is a "<b>Plug-in</b> <b>Electric</b> <b>Vehicle</b>" and an <b>EVSE</b> is an "<b>Electric</b> <b>Vehicle</b> <b>Supply</b> <b>Equipment</b>"  or  charging
       station.   This  program will remain active until it detects and connects to an available EVSE-HLE on the
       powerline network.  Once connected, it charges a virtual vehicle for about 10  seconds  then  disconnects
       and  terminates.   See  the  <u>HomePlug</u> <u>Green</u> <u>PHY</u> <u>Specification</u> <u>Release</u> <u>Version</u> <u>1.1</u> for more information on
       this protocol.

       Signal Level Attenuation Characterization (SLAC) enables a station to measure the  signal  level  of  its
       transmission  at  other  stations in the network.  It is designed for automotive applications where there
       are multiple plug-in vehicle (PEVs) and electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) on the network.  The PEV
       signal level is measured at multiple EVSEs to determine which EVSE the PEV is actually plugged into.  The
       process leading to this determination is called "<b>Green</b> <b>PHY</b> <b>PEV-EVSE</b> <b>Association</b>" (GreenPPEA).

       This program is part of the Qualcomm Atheros Powerline Toolkit.  See the <b>plc</b> man page for an overview and
       installation instructions.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       -<b>c</b>     Print the PEV-HLE configuration profile on stdout.  The configuration  profile  specifies  program
              defaults  in a format that you, as a user, can edit and save.  Use options <b>-p</b> and <b>-s</b> to read named
              profiles and sections.

       -<b>C</b>     Compare confirmation counter and warn (or exit - if <b>-x</b> is givenv) if a mismatch is detected.

       -<b>d</b>     Print the contents of the PEV-HLE session variable on stdout.  The session variable is an  program
              data  structure  that  stores  information  passed  between  the  PEV-HLE and EVSE-HLE during SLAC
              association.  This option is used to inspect and veriify information relevant to the process.

              If the program was compiled with variable SLAC_DEBUG defined then  this  option  also  prints  MME
              message fields before messages are sent or after they are received.  Interested parties can follow
              along in the source code.

       -<b>i</b>     Select  the  host  Ethernet  interface.   All  requests  are sent via this host interface and only
              reponses received via this host interface are recognized.  The default interface is  <b>eth1</b>  because
              most  people  use <b>eth0</b> as their principle network connection; however, if environment string "PLC"
              is defined then it takes precedence over the default interface.  This option then takes precedence
              over either default.

       -<b>K</b>     Skip the step which sets the Network Membership Key and focus on sounding only.

       -<b>l</b>     Normally, this tool exits after one run. Use this parameter to loop indefinitely.  Note, that this
              parameter has inverse logic compared to <b>evse</b> tool.

       -<b>p</b> <u>profile</u>
              The PEV-HLE configuration profile name.  The  program  will  supply  default  values  for  missing
              profile elements.  See the example profile shown below.  The default profile name is "<b>pev.ini</b>".

       -<b>q</b>     Enter quiet mode.  Progress messages are suppressed.

       -<b>s</b> <u>section</u>
              The  configuration  profile  section  name.   The  program  will supply default values for missing
              configuration profile elements.  See the example profile shown below.  The default section name is
              "<b>default</b>".

       -<b>v</b>     Enter verbose mode.  All Ethernet frames sent or received by the program are displayed on stdout.

       -<b>x</b>     Exit on error.

       -<b>?</b>, --<b>help</b>
              Print program help summary on stdout.  This option takes precedence  over  other  options  on  the
              command line.

       -<b>!</b>, --<b>version</b>
              Print  program  version information on stdout.  This option takes precedence over other options on
              the command line.  Use this option when sending screen dumps to Atheros Technical Support so  that
              they know exactly which version of the Linux Toolkit you are using.

</pre><h4><b>PROFILES</b></h4><pre>
       The  default  configuration  profile  for  this  program  is  "<b>pev.ini</b>".   The default profile section is
       "<b>default</b>".  Users may create additional profiles and reference them with  option  <b>-p</b>  or  add  additional
       sections to an existing profiles and reference them with option <b>-s</b>.

       <b>Attenuation</b> <b>Theshold</b>
              The  average  attenuation  above  which the PEV will not connect to an EVSE.  The default value is
              <b>10</b>db.

       <b>MSound</b> <b>Pause</b>
              The time in milliseconds between each MSound sent by the PEV-HLE to the EVSE-HLE.  Sending MSounds
              too frequently overloads the EVSE-PLC.  Sending them too infrequently wastes time.  This value  is
              derived and does not appear in the HPGP specification.  The default pause is <b>10</b> milliseconds.

       <b>Vehicle</b> <b>Identifier</b>
              Vehicle   identification.    The   17-byte   Vehicle   Identification   Number  to  be  placed  in
              CM_MNBC_SOUND.IND.SenderID.  This value is not used but is can be changed here so that  the  field
              is easy to spot within network message traces.

       <b>Network</b> <b>Membership</b> <b>Key</b>
              The  16-byte  Network Memberhip Key (NMK) for the PEV-PLC device.  This program uses CM_SET_KEY to
              sets the PEV-PLC NMK to this value after disconnecting.  The default value is the key for  Network
              Password "<b>HomePlugAV</b>".

       <b>Network</b> <b>Identifier</b>
              The  7-byte Network Identifier (NID) for the PEV-PLC device.  This program uses CM_SET_KEY to sets
              the PEV-PLC NID to this value after disconnecting.  The default value is  the  same  as  that  for
              Network Password "<b>HomePlugAV</b>".

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       The  following  example  starts  a  PEV  session on interface <b>eth0</b> and wait up to 2000 milliseconds (or 2
       seconds) for the EVSE to respond during any given exchange.

          # pev -ieth0 -w2000

       The default PEV-HLE configuration profile, "<b>pev.ini</b>", looks something like this but  it  can  be  changed
       using a normal text editor.  Use option <b>-P</b> to produce a template profile, if one is needed.

          # file: pev.ini
          # ========================================================
          # PEV-HLE initialization;
          # --------------------------------------------------------
          [default]
          attenuation threshold = 10
          msound pause = 10
          vehicle identifier = AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
          network membership key = 50D3E4933F855B7040784DF815AA8DB7
          network identifier = B0F2E695666B03
