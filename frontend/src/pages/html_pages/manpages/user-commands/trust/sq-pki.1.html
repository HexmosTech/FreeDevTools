</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Authenticate certs using the Web of Trust.

       The "Web of Trust" is a decentralized trust model popularized by PGP. It is a superset of X.509, which is
       a hierarchical trust model, and is the most popular trust model on the public internet today.  As used on
       the  public  internet,  however,  X.509 relies on a handful of global certification authorities (CAs) who
       often undermine its security.

       The Web of Trust is more nuanced than X.509.  Using the Web of Trust, require multiple, independent paths
       to authenticate a binding by only partially  trusting  CAs.   This  prevents  a  single  bad  actor  from
       compromising  their security.  And those who have stronger security requirements can use the Web of Trust
       in a completely decentralized manner where only the individuals they select –  who  are  not  necessarily
       institutions – act as trusted introducers.

</pre><h4><b>SUBCOMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>sq</b> <b>pki</b> <b>authenticate</b>
       Authenticate a binding.

       Authenticate  a  binding  (a  certificate  and User ID) by looking for a path from the trust roots to the
       specified  binding  in  the  Web  of  Trust.   Because  certifications  may  express  uncertainty  (i.e.,
       certifications may be marked as conveying only partial or marginal trust), multiple paths may be needed.

       An  error  is  return  if  no  binding  could  be authenticated to the specified level (by default: fully
       authenticated, i.e., a trust amount of 120).

       If any valid paths to the binding are found, they are printed on stdout whether they  are  sufficient  to
       authenticate the binding or not.

   <b>sq</b> <b>pki</b> <b>lookup</b>
       Lookup the certificates associated with a User ID.

       Identifies authenticated bindings (User ID and certificate pairs) where the User ID matches the specified
       User ID.

       An  error  is  return  if  no  binding  could  be authenticated to the specified level (by default: fully
       authenticated, i.e., a trust amount of 120).

       If a binding could be partially authenticated (i.e., its trust  amount  is  greater  than  0),  then  the
       binding is displayed, even if the trust is below the specified threshold.

   <b>sq</b> <b>pki</b> <b>identify</b>
       Identify a certificate.

       Identify a certificate by finding authenticated bindings (User ID and certificate pairs).

       An  error  is  return  if  no  binding  could  be authenticated to the specified level (by default: fully
       authenticated, i.e., a trust amount of 120).

       If a binding could be partially authenticated (i.e., its trust  amount  is  greater  than  0),  then  the
       binding is displayed, even if the trust is below the specified threshold.

   <b>sq</b> <b>pki</b> <b>vouch</b>
       Manage certifications.

       A vouch is a potentially public statement that something is true.  In OpenPGP there are two main types of
       statements that you can make: certifications, and authorizations.

       You  can  assert  that  a certificate belongs to a particular entity. This says nothing about an entity's
       trustworthiness.  For instance, you might certify `<a href="mailto:bob@nsa.gov">bob@nsa.gov</a>` for a given certificate.  This just means
       that you think the person behind the  email  address  `<a href="mailto:bob@nsa.gov">bob@nsa.gov</a>`  really  controls  that  certificate.
       That's a useful statement to make even if you don't trust that person to act in your interest.

       Alternatively  you  can say that you believe a certificate is a reasonable trusted introducer.  A trusted
       introducer is a third-party that you authorize to make introductions.  For instance, your bank might have
       a certification authority (CA).  If you verify the  CA's  fingerprint,  you  can  authorize  it  to  make
       certifications.   That  means  that  sq will use those certifications almost as if you made them. This is
       convenient as now you can authenticate any of the bank's employee.

       Authorizing a trusted introducer gives the trusted introducer a lot of  power.   You  can  constrain  the
       amount  of  power  that you give it by saying that it is only authorized to certify user IDs that have an
       email address in one or more domains, for instance.  In this way, you can take advantage  of  the  places
       where  your  and  a  CA's interests are aligned, and protect yourself from potentially malicious actions.
       For example, you could authorize your bank's CA to certify  user  IDs  that  have  an  email  address  in
       `bank.com`.  sq will then ignore any other certifications made by the CA.

   <b>sq</b> <b>pki</b> <b>link</b>
       Manage authenticated certificate and User ID links.

       Linking  a certificate and User ID is one way of making `sq` consider a binding to be authentic.  Another
       way is to use `sq pki vouch add` to certify the binding with an explicitly configured  trust  root.   The
       linking functionality is often easier to work with, and the information is private by default.

       Authenticated bindings can be used to designate a certificate using a symbolic name.  For instance, using
       `sq  encrypt`'s `--for-userid` and `--for-email` options, a user can designate a certificate using a User
       ID or an email address that is authenticated for that certificate.

       `sq` also uses authenticated  certificates  to  authenticate  other  data.   For  instance,  `sq  verify`
       considers signatures made by an authenticated certificate to be authentic.

       Users  can  create  a  link using `sq pki link add`.  That link can later be retracted using `sq pki link
       retract`.  A certificate can also be accepted as a trusted introducer by using `sq pki link authorize`.

       `sq` implements linking using non-exportable certifications, and an  implicit  trust  root.   An  OpenPGP
       certificate  directory, the default certificate store used by `sq`, includes a local trust root, which is
       stored under the `trust-root` special name.  When the user instructs `sq` to accept a binding, `sq`  uses
       the  local  trust  root  to  create  a  non-exportable  certification, which it stores in the certificate
       directory.  In this way, operations that use the Web of Trust to authenticate a binding automatically use
       links.

       When a user retracts a link, `sq` creates a new, non-exportable  certification  with  zero  trust.   This
       certification suppresses the previous link.

   <b>sq</b> <b>pki</b> <b>path</b>
       Verify the specified path.

       A path is a sequence of certificates starting at the root, and a User ID.  This function checks that each
       path  segment has a valid certification, which also satisfies any constraints (trust amount, trust depth,
       regular expressions).

       If a valid path is not found, then this subcommand also lints the path.  In particular, it report if  any
       certifications  are insufficient, e.g., not enough trust depth, or invalid, e.g., because they use SHA-1,
       but the use of SHA-1 has been disabled.
