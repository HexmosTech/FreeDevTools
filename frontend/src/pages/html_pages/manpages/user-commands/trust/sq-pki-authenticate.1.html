</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       sq pki authenticate - Authenticate a binding

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>sq</b> <b>pki</b> <b>authenticate</b> [<u>OPTIONS</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Authenticate a binding.

       Authenticate  a  binding  (a  certificate  and User ID) by looking for a path from the trust roots to the
       specified  binding  in  the  Web  of  Trust.   Because  certifications  may  express  uncertainty  (i.e.,
       certifications may be marked as conveying only partial or marginal trust), multiple paths may be needed.

       An  error  is  return  if  no  binding  could  be authenticated to the specified level (by default: fully
       authenticated, i.e., a trust amount of 120).

       If any valid paths to the binding are found, they are printed on stdout whether they  are  sufficient  to
       authenticate the binding or not.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Subcommand</b> <b>options</b>
       <b>--amount</b>=<u>AMOUNT</u>
              The required amount of trust

              120  indicates  full  authentication;  values less than 120 indicate partial authentication.  When
              `--certification-network` is passed, this defaults to 1200, i.e., this command tries  to  find  10
              paths.

       <b>--cert</b>=<u>FINGERPRINT|KEYID</u>
              Use certificates with the specified fingerprint or key ID

       <b>--certification-network</b>
              Treats the network as a certification network

              Normally,  the  authentication  machinery  treats  the  Web  of Trust network as an authentication
              network where a certification only means that the binding is correct, not that the  target  should
              be treated as a trusted introducer.  In a certification network, the targets of certifications are
              treated  as  trusted  introducers  with  infinite  depth, and any regular expressions are ignored.
              Note: The trust amount remains unchanged.  This is how most so-called PGP path-finding  algorithms
              work.

       <b>--email</b>=<u>EMAIL</u>
              Authenticate the specified email address

              This  checks  whether  it  is possible to authenticate a user ID with the specified email address.
              The user IDs do not need to be self signed.   To  authenticate  a  user  ID  containing  just  the
              specified email address, use `--userid &lt;EMAIL&gt;`.

       <b>--gossip</b>
              Treats all certificates as unreliable trust roots

              This  option  is  useful  for  figuring out what others think about a certificate (i.e., gossip or
              hearsay).  In other words, this finds arbitrary paths to a particular certificate.

              Gossip is useful in helping to identify alternative  ways  to  authenticate  a  certificate.   For
              instance,  imagine  Ed  wants  to  authenticate  Laura's  certificate,  but asking her directly is
              inconvenient.  Ed discovers that Micah has  certified  Laura's  certificate,  but  Ed  hasn't  yet
              authenticated Micah's certificate.  If Ed is willing to rely on Micah as a trusted introducer, and
              authenticating  Micah's certificate is easier than authenticating Laura's certificate, then Ed has
              learned about an easier way to authenticate Laura's certificate.

              Stable since 1.1.0.

       <b>--show-paths</b>
              Show why a binding is authenticated

              By default, only a user ID and certificate binding's degree of authentication (a value  between  0
              and  120)  is  shown.  This changes the output to also show how that value was computed by showing
              the paths from the trust roots to the bindings.

       <b>--unusable</b>
              Show bindings that are unusable

              Normally, unusable certificates and bindings are not shown. This option considers  bindings,  even
              if  they  are  not  unusable,  because  they  (or the certificates) are not valid according to the
              policy, are revoked, or are not live.

              This option only makes sense with `--gossip`,  because  unusable  bindings  are  still  considered
              unauthenticated.

              Stable since 1.1.0.

       <b>--userid</b>=<u>USERID</u>
              Authenticate the specified user ID

              The specified user ID does not need to be self signed.

   <b>Global</b> <b>options</b>
       See <b><a href="../man1/sq.1.html">sq</a></b>(1) for a description of the global options.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Authenticate a specific binding.

              sq pki authenticate --cert \
                     EB28F26E2739A4870ECC47726F0073F60FD0CBF0 --userid \
                     "Alice &lt;<a href="mailto:alice@example.org">alice@example.org</a>&gt;"

       Check whether we can authenticate any user ID with the specified email address for the given certificate.

              sq pki authenticate --cert \
                     EB28F26E2739A4870ECC47726F0073F60FD0CBF0 --email \
                     <a href="mailto:alice@example.org">alice@example.org</a>
