</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       bootctl - Control EFI firmware boot settings and manage boot loader

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>

       <b>bootctl</b> [OPTIONS...] {COMMAND}

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>bootctl</b> can check the EFI firmware and boot loader status, list and manage available boot loaders and
       boot loader entries, and install, update, or remove the <b><a href="../man7/systemd-boot.7.html">systemd-boot</a></b>(7) boot loader on the current
       system.

</pre><h4><b>GENERIC</b> <b>EFI</b> <b>FIRMWARE/BOOT</b> <b>LOADER</b> <b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       These commands are available on any EFI system, regardless of the boot loader used.

       <b>status</b>
           Shows brief information about the system firmware, the boot loader that was used to boot the system,
           the boot loaders currently available in the ESP, the boot loaders listed in the firmware's list of
           boot loaders and the current default boot loader entry. If no command is specified, this is the
           implied default.

           See the example below for details of the output.

           Added in version 239.

       <b>reboot-to-firmware</b> [<u>BOOL</u>]
           Query or set the "Reboot-Into-Firmware-Setup" flag of the EFI firmware. Takes a boolean argument
           which controls whether to show the firmware setup on next system reboot. If the argument is omitted
           shows the current status of the flag, or whether the flag is supported. This controls the same flag
           as <b>systemctl</b> <b>reboot</b> <b>--firmware-setup</b>, but is more low-level and allows setting the flag independently
           from actually requesting a reboot.

           Hint: use <b>systemctl</b> <b>reboot</b> <b>--firmware-setup</b> to reboot into firmware setup once. See <b><a href="../man1/systemctl.1.html">systemctl</a></b>(1) for
           details.

           Added in version 251.

</pre><h4><b>BOOT</b> <b>LOADER</b> <b>SPECIFICATION</b> <b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       These commands are available for all boot loaders that implement the <b>Boot</b> <b>Loader</b> <b>Specification</b>[1], such
       as <b>systemd-boot</b>.

       <b>list</b>
           Shows all available boot loader entries implementing the <b>Boot</b> <b>Loader</b> <b>Specification</b>[1], as well as any
           other entries discovered or automatically generated by a boot loader implementing the <b>Boot</b> <b>Loader</b>
           <b>Interface</b>[2]. JSON output may be requested with <b>--json=</b>.

           See the example below for details of the output.

           Added in version 239.

       <b>unlink</b> <u>ID</u>
           Removes a boot loader entry including the files it refers to. Takes a single boot loader entry ID
           string or a glob pattern as argument. Referenced files such as kernel or initrd are only removed if
           no other entry refers to them.

           Added in version 253.

       <b>cleanup</b>
           Removes files from the ESP and XBOOTLDR partitions that belong to the entry token but are not
           referenced in any boot loader entries.

           Added in version 253.

</pre><h4><b>BOOT</b> <b>LOADER</b> <b>INTERFACE</b> <b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       These commands are available for all boot loaders that implement the <b>Boot</b> <b>Loader</b> <b>Specification</b>[1] and the
       <b>Boot</b> <b>Loader</b> <b>Interface</b>[2], such as <b>systemd-boot</b>.

       <b>set-default</b> <u>ID</u>, <b>set-oneshot</b> <u>ID</u>
           Sets the default boot loader entry. Takes a single boot loader entry ID string or a glob pattern as
           argument. The <b>set-oneshot</b> command will set the default entry only for the next boot, the <b>set-default</b>
           will set it persistently for all future boots.

           <b>bootctl</b> <b>list</b> can be used to list available boot loader entries and their IDs.

           In addition, the boot loader entry ID may be specified as one of: <b>@default</b>, <b>@oneshot</b> or <b>@current</b>,
           which correspond to the current default boot loader entry for all future boots, the current default
           boot loader entry for the next boot, and the currently booted boot loader entry. These special IDs
           are resolved to the current values of the EFI variables <u>LoaderEntryDefault</u>, <u>LoaderEntryOneShot</u> and
           <u>LoaderEntrySelected</u>, see <b>Boot</b> <b>Loader</b> <b>Specification</b>[1] for details. These special IDs are primarily
           useful as a quick way to persistently make the currently booted boot loader entry the default choice,
           or to upgrade the default boot loader entry for the next boot to the default boot loader entry for
           all future boots, but may be used for other operations too.

           If set to <b>@saved</b> the chosen entry will be saved as an EFI variable on every boot and automatically
           selected the next time the boot loader starts.

           When an empty string ("") is specified as the ID, then the corresponding EFI variable will be unset.

           Hint: use <b>systemctl</b> <b>reboot</b> <b>--boot-loader-entry=</b><u>ID</u> to reboot into a specific boot entry and <b>systemctl</b>
           <b>reboot</b> <b>--boot-loader-menu=</b><u>timeout</u> to reboot into the boot loader menu once. See <b><a href="../man1/systemctl.1.html">systemctl</a></b>(1) for
           details.

           Added in version 240.

       <b>set-timeout</b> <u>TIMEOUT</u>, <b>set-timeout-oneshot</b> <u>TIMEOUT</u>
           Sets the boot loader menu timeout in seconds. The <b>set-timeout-oneshot</b> command will set the timeout
           only for the next boot. See <b><a href="../man7/systemd.time.7.html">systemd.time</a></b>(7) for details about the syntax of time spans.

           If this is set to <b>menu-disabled</b> or <b>menu-hidden</b> or <b>0</b>, no menu is shown and the default entry will be
           booted immediately, while setting this to <b>menu-force</b> disables the timeout while always showing the
           menu. When an empty string ("") is specified the bootloader will revert to its default menu timeout.

           Added in version 250.

</pre><h4><b>SYSTEMD-BOOT</b> <b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       These commands manage the <b>systemd-boot</b> EFI boot loader, and do not work in conjunction with other boot
       loaders.

       <b>install</b>
           Installs <b>systemd-boot</b> into the EFI system partition. A copy of <b>systemd-boot</b> will be stored as the EFI
           default/fallback loader at <u>ESP</u>/EFI/BOOT/BOOT*.EFI. The boot loader is then added to the top of the
           firmware's boot loader list.

           Added in version 239.

       <b>update</b>
           Updates all installed versions of <b><a href="../man7/systemd-boot.7.html">systemd-boot</a></b>(7), if the available version is newer than the version
           installed in the EFI system partition. This also includes the EFI default/fallback loader at
           <u>ESP</u>/EFI/BOOT/BOOT*.EFI. The boot loader is then added to end of the firmware's boot loader list if
           missing.

           Added in version 239.

       <b>remove</b>
           Removes all installed versions of <b>systemd-boot</b> from the EFI system partition and the firmware's boot
           loader list.

           Added in version 239.

       <b>is-installed</b>
           Checks whether <b>systemd-boot</b> is installed in the ESP. Note that a single ESP might host multiple boot
           loaders; this hence checks whether <b>systemd-boot</b> is one (of possibly many) installed boot loaders —
           and neither whether it is the default nor whether it is registered in any EFI variables.

           Added in version 243.

       <b>random-seed</b>
           Generates a random seed and stores it in the EFI System Partition (ESP), for use by the <b>systemd-boot</b>
           boot loader. If a random seed already exists in the ESP it is refreshed. Also generates a random
           'system token' and stores it persistently as an EFI variable, if one has not been set before. If the
           boot loader finds the random seed in the ESP and the system token in the EFI variable it will derive
           a random seed to pass to the OS and a new seed to store in the ESP from the combination of both. The
           random seed passed to the OS is credited to the kernel's entropy pool by the system manager during
           early boot, and permits userspace to boot up with an entropy pool fully initialized very early on.
           Also see <b><a href="../man8/systemd-boot-random-seed.service.8.html">systemd-boot-random-seed.service</a></b>(8).

           See <b>Random</b> <b>Seeds</b>[3] for further information.

           Added in version 243.

</pre><h4><b>KERNEL</b> <b>IMAGE</b> <b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>kernel-identify</b> <u>kernel</u>
           Takes a kernel image as argument. Checks what kind of kernel the image is. Returns one of "uki",
           "addon", "pe", and "unknown".

           Added in version 253.

       <b>kernel-inspect</b> <u>kernel</u>
           Takes a kernel image as argument. Prints details about the image.

           Added in version 253.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The following options are understood:

       <b>--esp-path=</b>
           Path to the EFI System Partition (ESP). If not specified, /efi/, <a href="file:/boot/">/boot/</a>, and <a href="file:/boot/efi/">/boot/efi/</a> are checked
           in turn. It is recommended to mount the ESP to /efi/, if possible.

       <b>--boot-path=</b>
           Path to the Extended Boot Loader partition, as defined in the <b>Boot</b> <b>Loader</b> <b>Specification</b>[1]. If not
           specified, <a href="file:/boot/">/boot/</a> is checked. It is recommended to mount the Extended Boot Loader partition to
           <a href="file:/boot/">/boot/</a>, if possible.

       <b>--root=</b><u>root</u>
           Takes a directory path as an argument. All paths will be prefixed with the given alternate <u>root</u> path,
           including config search paths.

           Added in version 252.

       <b>--image=</b><u>image</u>
           Takes a path to a disk image file or block device node. If specified, all operations are applied to
           file system in the indicated disk image. This option is similar to <b>--root=</b>, but operates on file
           systems stored in disk images or block devices. The disk image should either contain just a file
           system or a set of file systems within a GPT partition table, following the <b>Discoverable</b> <b>Partitions</b>
           <b>Specification</b>[4]. For further information on supported disk images, see <b><a href="../man1/systemd-nspawn.1.html">systemd-nspawn</a></b>(1)'s switch of
           the same name.

           Added in version 252.

       <b>--image-policy=</b><u>policy</u>
           Takes an image policy string as argument, as per <b><a href="../man7/systemd.image-policy.7.html">systemd.image-policy</a></b>(7). The policy is enforced when
           operating on the disk image specified via <b>--image=</b>, see above. If not specified defaults to the "*"
           policy, i.e. all recognized file systems in the image are used.

       <b>--install-source=</b>
           When installing binaries with <b>--root=</b> or <b>--image=</b>, selects where to source them from. Takes one of
           "auto" (the default), "image" or "host". With "auto" binaries will be picked from the specified
           directory or image, and if not found they will be picked from the host. With "image" or "host" no
           fallback search will be performed if the binaries are not found in the selected source.

           Added in version 252.

       <b>-p</b>, <b>--print-esp-path</b>
           This option modifies the behaviour of <b>status</b>. Only prints the path to the EFI System Partition (ESP)
           to standard output and exits.

           Added in version 236.

       <b>-x</b>, <b>--print-boot-path</b>
           This option modifies the behaviour of <b>status</b>. Only prints the path to the Extended Boot Loader
           partition if it exists, and the path to the ESP otherwise to standard output and exit. This command
           is useful to determine where to place boot loader entries, as they are preferably placed in the
           Extended Boot Loader partition if it exists and in the ESP otherwise.

           Boot Loader Specification Type #1 entries should generally be placed in the directory "$(bootctl
           -x)/loader/entries/". Existence of that directory may also be used as indication that boot loader
           entry support is available on the system. Similarly, Boot Loader Specification Type #2 entries should
           be placed in the directory "$(bootctl -x)/EFI/Linux/".

           Note that this option (similarly to the <b>--print-esp-path</b> option mentioned above), is available
           independently from the boot loader used, i.e. also without <b>systemd-boot</b> being installed.

           Added in version 242.

       <b>--print-loader-path</b>
           This option modifies the behaviour of <b>status</b>: it shows the absolute path to the boot loader EFI
           binary used for the current boot if this information is available. Note that no attempt is made to
           verify whether the binary still exists.

           Added in version 257.

       <b>--print-stub-path</b>
           This option modifies the behaviour of <b>status</b>: it shows the absolute path to the UKI/stub EFI binary
           used for the current boot if this information is available. Note that no attempt is made to verify
           whether the binary still exists.

           Added in version 257.

       <b>-R</b>, <b>--print-root-device</b>
           Print the path to the block device node backing the root file system of the local OS. This prints a
           path such as /dev/nvme0n1p5. If the root file system is backed by dm-crypt/LUKS or dm-verity the
           underlying block device is returned. If the root file system is backed by multiple block devices (as
           supported by btrfs) the operation will fail. If the switch is specified twice (i.e.  <b>-RR</b>) and the
           discovered block device is a partition device the "whole" block device it belongs to is determined
           and printed (e.g.  /dev/nvme0n1). If the root file system is "tmpfs" (or a similar in-memory file
           system), the block device backing <a href="file:/usr/">/usr/</a> is returned if applicable. If the root file system is a
           network file system (e.g. NFS, CIFS) the operation will fail.

           Added in version 254.

       <b>--no-variables</b>
           Do not touch the firmware's boot loader list stored in EFI variables.

           Added in version 220.

       <b>--random-seed=yes|no</b>
           By default the <b>install</b> command initializes a random seed file in the ESP. When creating an image it
           may be desirable to disable that in order to avoid having the same seed in all instances.

           Added in version 257.

       <b>--graceful</b>
           Ignore failure when the EFI System Partition cannot be found, when EFI variables cannot be written,
           or a different or newer boot loader is already installed. Currently only applies to <b>is-installed</b>,
           <b>update</b>, and <b>random-seed</b> verbs.

           Added in version 244.

       <b>-q</b>, <b>--quiet</b>
           Suppress printing of the results of various commands and also the hints about ESP being unavailable.

           Added in version 251.

       <b>--make-entry-directory=yes|no</b>
           Controls creation and deletion of the <b>Boot</b> <b>Loader</b> <b>Specification</b>[1] Type #1 entry directory on the
           file system containing resources such as kernel and initrd images during <b>install</b> and <b>remove</b>,
           respectively. The directory is named after the entry token, as specified with <b>--entry-token=</b>
           parameter described below, and is placed immediately below the <u>$BOOT</u> root directory (i.e. beneath the
           file system returned by the <b>--print-boot-path</b> option, see above). Defaults to "no".

           Added in version 251.

       <b>--entry-token=</b>
           Controls how to name and identify boot loader entries for this OS installation. Accepted during
           <b>install</b>, and takes one of "auto", "machine-id", "os-id", "os-image-id" or an arbitrary string
           prefixed by "literal:" as argument.

           If set to <b>machine-id</b> the entries are named after the machine ID of the running system (e.g.
           "b0e793a9baf14b5fa13ecbe84ff637ac"). See <b><a href="../man5/machine-id.5.html">machine-id</a></b>(5) for details about the machine ID concept and
           file.

           If set to <b>os-id</b> the entries are named after the OS ID of the running system, i.e. the <u>ID=</u> field of
           <b><a href="../man5/os-release.5.html">os-release</a></b>(5) (e.g.  "fedora"). Similarly, if set to <b>os-image-id</b> the entries are named after the OS
           image ID of the running system, i.e. the <u>IMAGE_ID=</u> field of os-release (e.g.
           "vendorx-cashier-system").

           If set to <b>auto</b> (the default), the /etc/kernel/entry-token file will be read if it exists, and the
           stored value used. Otherwise if the local machine ID is initialized it is used. Otherwise <u>IMAGE_ID=</u>
           from os-release will be used, if set. Otherwise, <u>ID=</u> from os-release will be used, if set.

           Unless set to "machine-id", or when <b>--make-entry-directory=yes</b> is used the selected token string is
           written to a file /etc/kernel/entry-token, to ensure it will be used for future entries. This file is
           also read by <b><a href="../man8/kernel-install.8.html">kernel-install</a></b>(8), in order to identify under which name to generate boot loader entries
           for newly installed kernels, or to determine the entry names for removing old ones.

           Using the machine ID for naming the entries is generally preferable, however there are cases where
           using the other identifiers is a good option. Specifically: if the identification data that the
           machine ID entails shall not be stored on the (unencrypted) <u>$BOOT</u> partition, or if the ID shall be
           generated on first boot and is not known when the entries are prepared. Note that using the machine
           ID has the benefit that multiple parallel installations of the same OS can coexist on the same
           medium, and they can update their boot loader entries independently. When using another identifier
           (such as the OS ID or the OS image ID), parallel installations of the same OS would try to use the
           same entry name. To support parallel installations, the installer must use a different entry token
           when adding a second installation.

           Added in version 251.

       <b>--all-architectures</b>
           Install binaries for all supported EFI architectures (this implies <b>--no-variables</b>).

           Added in version 252.

       <b>--efi-boot-option-description=</b>
           Description of the entry added to the firmware's boot option list. Defaults to "Linux Boot Manager".

           Using the default entry name "Linux Boot Manager" is generally preferable as only one bootloader
           installed to a single ESP partition should be used to boot any number of OS installations found on
           the various disks installed in the system. Specifically distributions should not use this flag to
           install a branded entry in the boot option list. However in situations with multiple disks, each with
           their own ESP partition, it can be beneficial to make it easier to identify the bootloader being used
           in the firmware's boot option menu.

           Added in version 252.

       <b>--dry-run</b>
           Dry run for <b>unlink</b> and <b>cleanup</b>.

           In dry run mode, the unlink and cleanup operations only print the files that would get deleted
           without actually deleting them.

           Added in version 253.

       <b>--secure-boot-auto-enroll=yes|no</b>, <b>--private-key=</b><u>PATH/URI</u>, <b>--private-key-source=</b><u>TYPE</u><b>[:</b><u>NAME</u><b>]</b>,
       <b>--certificate=</b><u>PATH</u>, <b>--certificate-source=</b><u>TYPE</u><b>[:</b><u>NAME</u><b>]</b>
           Configure the ESP for secure boot auto-enrollment when invoking the <b>install</b> command. Takes a boolean
           argument. Disabled by default. Enabling this option will make <b>bootctl</b> populate the ESP with signed
           "PK", "KEK" and "db" signature databases, each containing the given certificate in "DER" format as
           their only entry. These secure boot signature databases will be picked up and enrolled by
           <b>systemd-boot</b> if secure boot is in setup mode and secure boot auto-enrollment is enabled.

           When specifying this option, a certificate and private key have to be provided as well using the
           <b>--certificate=</b> and <b>--private-key=</b> options. The <b>--certificate=</b> option takes a path to a PEM encoded
           X.509 certificate or a URI that's passed to the OpenSSL provider configured with <b>--certificate-source</b>
           which takes one of "file" or "provider", with the latter being followed by a specific provider
           identifier, separated with a colon, e.g.  "provider:pkcs11". The <b>--private-key=</b> option can take a
           path or a URI that will be passed to the OpenSSL engine or provider, as specified by
           <b>--private-key-source=</b> as a "type:name" tuple, such as "engine:pkcs11". The specified OpenSSL signing
           engine or provider will be used to sign the EFI signature lists.

           Added in version 257.

       <b>--no-pager</b>
           Do not pipe output into a pager.

       <b>--json=</b><u>MODE</u>
           Shows output formatted as JSON. Expects one of "short" (for the shortest possible output without any
           redundant whitespace or line breaks), "pretty" (for a pretty version of the same, with indentation
           and line breaks) or "off" (to turn off JSON output, the default).

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
           Print a short help text and exit.

       <b>--version</b>
           Print a short version string and exit.

</pre><h4><b>SIGNED</b> <b>.EFI</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>bootctl</b> <b>install</b> and <b>update</b> will look for a <b>systemd-boot</b> file ending with the ".efi.signed" suffix first,
       and copy that instead of the normal ".efi" file. This allows distributions or end-users to provide signed
       images for UEFI SecureBoot.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       On success, 0 is returned, a non-zero failure code otherwise.  <b>bootctl</b> <b>--print-root-device</b> returns exit
       status 80 in case the root file system is not backed by single block device, and other non-zero exit
       statuses on other errors.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       If <u>$SYSTEMD_RELAX_ESP_CHECKS=1</u> is set the validation checks for the ESP are relaxed, and the path
       specified with <b>--esp-path=</b> may refer to any kind of file system on any kind of partition.

       Similarly, <u>$SYSTEMD_RELAX_XBOOTLDR_CHECKS=1</u> turns off some validation checks for the Extended Boot Loader
       partition.
