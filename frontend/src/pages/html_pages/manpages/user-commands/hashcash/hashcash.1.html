</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Hashcash  is  a  denial-of-service  counter measure tool.  Its main current use is to help hashcash users
       avoid losing email due to content based and blacklist based anti-spam systems.

       The hashcash tool allows you to create hashcash stamps to attach  to  emails  you  send,  and  to  verify
       hashcash  stamps  attached  to  emails  you  receive.   Email  senders  attach  hashcash  stamps with the
       X-Hashcash: header.  Vendors and authors of anti-spam tools are  encouraged  to  exempt  mail  sent  with
       hashcash from their blacklists and content based filtering rules.

       A  hashcash stamp constitutes a proof-of-work which takes a parameterizable amount of work to compute for
       the sender.  The recipient can verify received stamps efficiently.

       The hashcash proof-of-work function is to compute partial hash  preimages  (the  SHA1  hash  function  is
       used).   By choosing the number of bits of the preimage that are equal to 0, the work required to compute
       a partial preimage can be made arbitrarily expensive -- from fractions of a second to minutes  or  hours.
       The verification is efficient requiring the same small cost whatever the preimage size.

       For   more   detailed   discussion   of   other   applications   hashcash   has   been   used   for   see
       <a href="http://www.hashcash.org/">http://www.hashcash.org/</a>

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b> <b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       In this man page a resource name is the name of the service or address the stamp is created for.  In  the
       case of email, the resource name is the recipient's email address in the form <a href="mailto:user@domain.com">user@domain.com</a>.

       <b>Minting</b> <b>stamps</b>

       The <u>-m</u> flag must be given to mint a stamp.

       The  resource name (recipient's email address) to mint the stamp against can be passed as an argument, or
       if omitted is read from stdin.  If stdin is a tty the user is prompted, if stdin is a pipe  the  resource
       name  is  just  silently  read.   The  desired  preimage size can be specified with the -b option.  If no
       preimage size is specified, the default is 20 bits.  See also the <u>-b</u> <u>default</u> option.

       <b>Checking</b> <b>stamps</b>

       The <u>-c</u> flag must be given to check a stamps expiry.  The stamp to check can be given as  an  argument  to
       "hashcash".   If  no  stamp  is  given  the stamp is read from stdin.  If stdin is a tty the user will be
       prompted, if stdin is a pipe the stamp is just silently read.  A resource  name  (the  recipient's  email
       address)  can  be given with the <u>-r</u> option.  If a resource name is given the resource name is compared to
       the resource name in the stamp, if they do not match, the stamp is rejected.

       Note: if no resource name is given the stamp is anyway checked to see if it is otherwise  valid,  but  it
       could  be  minted  for  a  different  resource,  which  would  allow stamps to be reused across different
       resources, so hashcash will return unchecked exit code on exit.

       Stamps are by default considered to be valid for 28 days.  The validity period can be changed  using  the
       <u>-e</u> flag.

       If  the  stamp  has  expired  or  has  a  date  in the future the stamp is rejected and the program exits
       immediately.

       If a required preimage size is given with the <u>-b</u> flag, the stamps value is computed and compared, if  the
       stamp  has  insufficent  value  it is rejected, and the program exits immediately.  If the <u>-b</u> flag is not
       given, the stamp is checked to see if it is otherwise valid, but hashcash will return unchecked exit code
       on exit.

       If the stamp is double spent the stamp is rejected.  Double spending  protection  is  discussed  in  more
       detail  below  in  "Double Spending Protection".  If double spending protection is not enabled, the stamp
       could be double spent, so hashcash will return unchecked exit code (exit code 2) on exit.

       The <u>-w</u> flag can be used to request that the number of bits of the preimage are counted and displayed. The
       <u>-n</u> flag can be used to request that the resource name in the stamp is parsed out and displayed.   The  <u>-l</u>
       flag can be used to request the number of seconds until expiry of the stamp is output.

       The program will only return exit codes valid or invalid if the <u>-c</u> flag is used, the <u>-b</u> flag is used, <u>-d</u>,
       <u>-r</u>  <u>resource</u>  are  used.   These are the minimum set of options necessary to fully check the validty of a
       stamp.  If these criteria are not met, the program will return exit code unchecked (exit code 2) on exit.
       (See also the <u>-y</u> flag.)

       <b>Double</b> <b>Spending</b> <b>Protection</b>

       If the <u>-d</u> flag is used when checking stamps, a database of spent stamps is kept.

       By default stamps expire after 28 days, without expiry the database would  grow  indefinately.   You  can
       specify  an  alternate  expiry  period with the <u>-e</u> flag.  The recommended (and default) expiry period for
       email is 28 days.  After the expiry period amount of time, the stamp is anyway considered expired and may
       be purged from the database to save space.  (See "Purging Periodically vs on  Next  Access"  for  how  to
       purge stamps.)

       For  efficiency  reasons  a  stamp  is  verified before it is checked in the database; if it is otherwise
       invalid no database activity will occur.

       Note: The decision about how long the stamp should be considered valid is up to the verifier.  If  it  is
       too  short  it  is  possible  for  some  applications  that  the stamp will expire before arriving at the
       recipient (eg with email.)  The suggested value of 28 days should  be  safe  for  normal  email  delivery
       delays.  The choice is a trade-off between database size and risk of expiry prior to arrival, and depends
       on the application.

       Note:  Different  stamps  in the same database can have different validity periods, so for example stamps
       for different resources with different validity periods can be  stored  in  the  same  database,  or  the
       recipient may change the validity period for future stamps without affecting the validity of old stamps.

       <b>Purging</b> <b>Periodically</b> <b>vs</b> <b>on</b> <b>Next</b> <b>Access</b>

       To  purge  old stamps periodically while checking stamps use the <u>-p</u> <u>period</u> option to purge no sooner than
       the given time period since the last purge.  Purging can be used with the <u>-k</u> option  to  purge  unexpired
       stamps also, and with the <u>-j</u> <u>resource</u> flag to purge only stamps for the given resource.

       There  are  circumstances where it may be inconvenient to purge stamps on the next access, for example if
       there is a large double spend database which takes some time to purge,  and  the  response  time  of  the
       hashcash  checker  is important.  To avoid this problem, purging can be done separately using just the <u>-p</u>
       <u>now</u> option to request just the purge operation.  On unix for example you could call "hashcash -p now"  in
       a cron job once per day, or on demand when disk was running low.

       <b>Speed</b> <b>Estimates</b>

       The  <u>-s</u>  flag requests measurement of how many preimage can be tested per second.  No stamp is minted, or
       verified.

       If the <u>-b</u> flag is used with this option, instead an estimate of how many seconds it would take to mint  a
       stamp  of  the  given size in bits is computed.  To find out how much time it will take to mint a default
       sized stamp use <u>-s</u> <u>-b</u> <u>default</u>.

       <b>Notes</b>

       All informational output is printed on stderr.  Minted stamps, and  results  of  stamp  verification  and
       timing  are  printed  on  stdout.   The  quiet  flag <u>-q</u> suppresses all informational output.  The <u>-v</u> flag
       requests more informational output.  The requested output, which is the only information that  is  output
       in  quiet  mode (when <u>-q</u> is specified) is printed on standard output.  If stdout is a pipe, or when quiet
       mode is in effect the output is printed without description (ie just bits, just seconds, just resource).

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>-c</u>  Check the expiry information of stamps given as an argument or on stdin.  (Use with  <u>-b</u>,  <u>-d</u>  and  <u>-r</u>
           <u>resource</u> to fully check stamps).

       <u>-m</u>  Mint stamps with the resources given as arguments or on stdin.

       <u>-b</u> <u>bits</u>
           When  minting  a stamp, create a preimage of at least this many bits.  When verifying a stamp require
           that it have a preimage of at minimum this many bits, otherwise reject it.  If omitted the default is
           used.

           When checking stamps, require that the stamps have this many bits.

           The default number of bits can be specified with <u>-b</u> <u>default</u>.  Bits relative to the default  can  also
           be specified with <u>-b</u> <u>+n</u> for n bits more than the default and <u>-b</u> <u>-n</u> for n bits less than the default.

           <u>-b</u> <u>default</u>, <u>-b</u> <u>+0</u> and <u>-b</u> <u>-0</u> are all equivalent.

           When doing the speed test <u>-s</u>, can to measure speed of default token with <u>-s</u> <u>-b</u> <u>default</u>.

       <u>-r</u> <u>resource</u>
           When  minting  stamps, the resource name (recipient's email address) to mint the stamp against can be
           given either with <u>-r</u> <u>resource</u> or as an argument to "hashcash".

           When checking stamps, the resource name (your own email address) is given with the <u>-r</u> option.  If the
           resource name is given it is checked against the resource name in the stamp, and if they do not match
           the stamp is rejected.  Note if the resource name is not given, stamps for other resources  would  be
           accepted, and therefore hashcash returns exit code unchecked (exit code 2) on exit.

       <u>-o</u>  When verifying stamps multiple resources can be given.  By default the resources are just checked one
           by  one  until  a  matching  valid  resource  is  found.   However  when you use wildcards or regular
           expressions (see <u>-E</u>), it is useful to be able to specify that one resource  overrides  another.   For
           example  this:  <u>-b15</u>  <u>-r</u>  <u><a href="mailto:adam@dev.null">adam@dev.null</a></u>  <u>-o</u> <u>-b10</u> <u>*@dev.null</u> states that mail to address <u><a href="mailto:adam@dev.null">adam@dev.null</a></u>
           requires 15 bits, but mail to <u>*@dev.null</u> requires only 10  bits.   If  we  omitted  the  <u>-o</u>  override
           relationship  between  the  two  resources,  a  stamp  of  10  bits  would  be  accepted  for address
           <u><a href="mailto:adam@dev.null">adam@dev.null</a></u> because while it would be rejected as having insufficient bits under the first rule, it
           would be accepted under the 2nd rule.  The <u>-o</u> option allows you avoid this problem.

       <u>-e</u> <u>time</u>
           Expiry period for spent stamps.  While checking stamps (using the <u>-c</u> flag), if the stamp  was  minted
           more than the specified amount of time ago, it is considered expired.  If this option is not used, by
           default  stamps  expire after 28 days.  The expiry period is given in seconds by default (an argument
           of 0 means forever).  A single character suffix can be used to specify alternate units (m =  minutes,
           h = hours, d = days, M = months, y = Y = years, and s = seconds).

           If  used  with the <u>-d</u> option, the spent stamp and its expiry period is recorded in the database.  See
           the <u>-p</u> option for description of how to purge stamps from the database.

           While minting stamps, the <u>-e</u> flag can have an effect on the resolution of time created in the  stamp.
           Without the <u>-e</u> option, the default resolution is days (time format: YYMMDD).  Alternate formats based
           on range of expiry period are as follows:

           While minting you can also given an explicit time width with the <u>-z</u> option instead.  (<u>-z</u> overrides <u>-e</u>
           if both are given.  If neither are given the default is 6 chars (time format: YYMMDD)).

           The rules for automatically determining appropriate time width from <u>-e</u> if no <u>-z</u> option is given are:

           * period &gt;= 2 years then time format YY is used rounded down to the nearest year start;
           * 2 years &lt; period &lt;= 2 months then time format YYMM is used rounded down to the nearest month start;
           * 2 months &lt; period &lt;= 2 days then time format YYMMDD is used rounded down to the beginning of the
           nearest day;
           * 2 days &lt; period &lt;= 2 minutes then time format YYMMDDhhmm is used rounded down to the beginning of
           the nearest minute;
           * period &lt; 2 minutes then time format YYMMDDhhmmss is used in seconds.

           Note  the  rounding down is based on UTC time, not local time.  This can lead to initially surprising
           results when rounding down to eg days in time zones other than GMT (UTC = GMT).  It may be clearer to
           understand if you use the <u>-u</u> option.

       <u>-z</u> <u>width</u>
           The <u>-z</u> option is for use during minting and allows user choice of width of  time  width  field.   See
           also  the  <u>-e</u>  option  given in combination with <u>-m</u> to specify an implicit time field width under the
           description of the <u>-e</u> flag.  Valid widths are 6,10 or 12 chars corresponding respectively to: YYMMDD,
           YYMMDDhhmm, and YYMMDDhhmmss rounded down to the nearest day, or minute respectively.

           Note the rounding down is based on UTC time, not local time.  This can lead to  initially  surprising
           results when rounding down to eg days in time zones other than GMT (UTC = GMT).  It may be clearer to
           understand if you use the <u>-u</u> option.

       <u>-g</u> <u>period</u>
           The  <u>-g</u>  option  is  for  use  when checking hashcash stamps with the <u>-c</u> option and specifies a grace
           period for clock skew, ie if a hashcash stamp arrives with a date in the future or  in  the  past  it
           will  not  be rejected as having a futuristic date (or as being expired) unless it is more futuristic
           (or has been expired for longer) than this period.  The default is 2 days, which means as long as the
           sending system's clock is no more than 2 days ahead (or 2 days  behind)  of  the  receiving  system's
           clock, the hashcash stamp will still be accepted.

           The  default  units  for  grace period are seconds.  A single character suffix can be used to specify
           alternate units (m = minutes, h = hours, d = days, M = months, y = Y = years, and s = seconds).

       <u>-d</u>  Store stamps in a double spend database.  If stamp has been seen before it will be rejected  even  if
           it  is  otherwise  valid.   The default database file is <u>database.sdb</u> in the current directory.  Only
           otherwise valid stamps will be stored in the database.  Only fully validated stamps will be stored in
           the database, unless the <u>-y</u> option is given.

       <u>-f</u> <u>dbname</u>
           Use <u>dbname</u> instead of default filename for double spend database.

       <u>-p</u> <u>period</u>
           Purges the database of expired stamps if the given time period has passed since the last time it  was
           purged.   As  a  convenience <u>-p</u> <u>now</u> is equivalent to <u>-p</u> <u>0</u> both of which mean purge now, regardless of
           when the database was last purged.

           If used in combination with <u>-j</u> <u>resource</u> only the stamps minted for the given resource are purged.

           If used in combination with <u>-k</u> all stamps  even  un-expired  stamps  are  purged.   Can  be  used  in
           combination with <u>-t</u> <u>time</u> to expire as if the current time were the given time.

       <u>-k</u>  Use with option <u>-p</u> to request all stamps are purged rather than just expired ones.

       <u>-j</u> <u>resource</u>
           Use  with  option  <u>-p</u>  to request that just stamps matching the given resource name are to be purged,
           rather than the default which is to purge all expired stamps.  If the  resource  name  is  the  empty
           string, all stamps are matched (this is equivalent to omitting the <u>-j</u> option).

           Note the <u>-E</u>, <u>-M</u> and <u>-S</u> type of match flags also apply to resources given with the <u>-j</u> <u>resource</u> flag.

       <u>-s</u>  Print  timing  information  only, and don't proceed to create a stamp.  If combined with <u>-b</u> <u>bits</u> flag
           print estimate of how long the requested preimage size would take to compute, if <u>-s</u> given by  itself,
           just  prints  speed  of  the preimage finder.  To print an estimate of how long the default number of
           bits would take use <u>-b</u> <u>default</u>.

       <u>-h</u>  Print short usage information.

       <u>-v</u>  Print more verbose informational output about the stamp minting or verification.  (If -v is the  only
           argument, prints the tool version number.)

       <u>-V</u>  Prints tool version number.

       <u>-q</u>  Batch mode.  Prints no information other than output.  This option overrides the <u>-v</u> option.

       <u>-X</u>  When  minting,  prints  the  hashcash  email  X-header 'X-Hashcash: ' before the stamp.  Without this
           option just the bare stamp is printed.

           When checking, after scanning stamps given as arguments, scans stdin  for  lines  starting  with  the
           string  'X-Hashcash:', and uses the rest of the matching line as the stamp.  Only the lines up to and
           ending at the first blank line are scanned (see also <u>-i</u> flag which can be used to override this).   A
           blank  line  is  the separator used to separate the headers from the body of a mail message or USENET
           article.  This is meant to make it convenient to pipe a mail message or USENET article to hashcash on
           stdin.

       <u>-x</u> <u>extension</u>
           An extension string composed of name value sets.  The extension format  is  described  below  in  the
           section  on  the hashcash stamp format.  This allows users to define their own stamp extensions which
           are hashed into the stamp, verified by recipients that support them, and ignored by  recipients  that
           don't  support them.  Note the extension hook mechanism has not yet been implemented.  This will come
           in a subsequent release.

       <u>-i</u>  When checking and using the <u>-X</u> flag, ignore the blank line boundary between headers and body  of  the
           message, and check for stamps in the body too if one is not found in the headers.

       <u>-t</u> <u>time</u>
           Pretend  the  current  time  is  the  time given for purposes of minting stamps, verifying stamps and
           purging old stamps  from  the  database.   Time  is  given  in  a  format  based  on  UTCTIME  format
           YYMMDD[hhmm[ss]].

           Time is expressed in local time by default.  Use with <u>-u</u> flag to give time in UTC (GMT).

           You  can  also  give  time  relative  to the current time by prefixing the argument with + or -.  The
           default units for relative time are seconds.  A single  character  suffix  can  be  used  to  specify
           alternate units (m = minutes, h = hours, d = days, M = months, y = Y = years, and s = seconds).

           Note:  when time is expressed in local time, if there is daylight savings in your timezone, there are
           one or two ambiguous hours per year at the time of change from daylight savings time to normal time.

       <u>-u</u>  Input and output absolute times in UTC (GMT) instead of local time.

       <u>-a</u> <u>period</u>
           Add (or subtract if number is negative) a random value from  the  current  time  before  minting  the
           stamp.   This  hides  the  time the stamp was created, which may be useful for anonymous users.  Note
           adding (rather than subtracting) a random time may be risky if the stamp takes less  than  the  added
           time to arrive as the recipient will reject stamps with time stamps in the future.

       <u>-n</u>  Print resource name parsed from stamp being verified.  Returns exit code unchecked on exit.

       <u>-l</u>  Print number of seconds left before stamp expires.  Returns exit code unchecked on exit.

           Note: the calculation includes the grace period, so can be up to 2 times grace period longer than you
           might  otherwise  expect  (clock  fast  but  system has to presume it could be slow).  If you want to
           exclude the grace period add <u>-g0</u> to set grace period to 0 for the calculation.

       <u>-w</u>  Print number of bits of preimage of stamp.  Returns exit code unchecked on exit.

       <u>-y</u>  Returns success if the stamp is valid even if it is not fully checked.  Use with <u>-c</u> where not all  of
           <u>-d</u>,  <u>-r</u>  are  specified to get success exit code on valid but partially checked stamp.  Similarly can
           use with <u>-n</u>, <u>-l</u>, <u>-w</u> with same effect.

       <u>-M</u>  When checking stamps, allow wildcard <u>*</u> matching in the resource name to make it  simpler  to  specify
           multiple  email  addresses  and  to  allow  matching  catch-all  addresses  and  addresses  including
           subdomains.  This is the default.  See also <u>-S</u>, <u>-E</u> and <u>-C</u>

       <u>-S</u>  When checking stamps use simple text compare to compare resource names to those in stamps.  See  also
           <u>-M</u>, <u>-E</u> and <u>-C</u>.

       <u>-E</u>  When  checking stamps use regular expressions to specify resource names to make it simpler to specify
           multiple email addresses, catch-all addresses, classes of extension addresses and addresses including
           subdomains.  Note regular expression syntax is POSIX style: special characters  do  not  need  to  be
           quoted  to  have their special meaning; but they do have to be quoted with \ to that character in the
           searched string.  The regular expression automatically has ^ added at the beginning and  $  added  at
           the  end, if they are not specified.  The special characters ^ matches the beginning of the resource,
           and $ matches the end of resource.

           (Note even if compiled with BSD regular expressions, POSIX  style  syntax  is  used;  also  note  BSD
           regular expressions do not support ranges {}.)

       <u>-C</u>  By  default  resources  are  canonicalized  to  lower  case  on minting and on checking.  The <u>-C</u> flag
           overrides this so that resources are treated as case sensitive on checking, and not canonizalized  on
           minting.

       <u>-P</u>  Print  progress  info  (number  of  iterations, expected iterations, percentage done, best stamp size
           found so far).

       <u>-O</u> <u>core</u>
           Select hashcash core with that number.  Currently 0-9 are valid cores.  Not all  cores  work  on  all
           architectures.   Eg some are x86 specific assembler, others PPC specific assembler.  If a core is not
           valid hashcash returns failure and explains what happened.

       <u>-Z</u> <u>n</u>
           Compress the stamp.  This is a time vs space trade off.   Larger  stamps  are  faster,  but  arguably
           slightly ugly.  For fastest stamps (the default) use -Z 0; for partly compressed stamps use -Z 1; for
           very  compressed, but somewhat slow stamps use -Z 2.  (Note: due to a late discovered bug, -Z2 is the
           same as -Z1 for now until I can fix that.)

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Creating</b> <b>stamps</b>

       "hashcash -s"
           Print timing information about how many preimages the machine can try per second.

       "hashcash -sv"
           More accurate but quite slow benchmarking of different processor specific minting cores.

       "hashcash -s -b default"
           Print how long it would take the machine to compute a default  sized  preimage  (but  don't  actually
           compute a preimage).

       "hashcash -s -b 32"
           Print  how  long it would take the machine to compute a 32 bit preimage (but don't actually compute a
           preimage).

       "hashcash -m"
           Mint a stamp.  Will prompt for resource name and mint with default value (number of preimage bits).

       "hashcash -m foo"
           Compute preimage on resource foo.  Will mint with default value (number of preimage bits).

       "hashcash -m foo -b 10"
           Compute 10 bit preimage on resource foo.

       "hashcash -a -3d"
           Subtract a random time of between 0 days and 3 days from the stamp's creation time.  This is the same
           fuzz factor used by mixmaster to reduce risk of timing-correlations.

       <b>Examining</b> <b>Stamps</b>

       "hashcash -w 1:24:040806:foo::511801694b4cd6b0:1e7297a"
           Report the value of the stamp (how many bits of preimage)  there  are.   The  example  is  a  24  bit
           preimage, which takes on average 25 seconds to create on a 3Ghz P4.

       "hashcash -mq -b 10 foo ⎪ hashcash -w"
           Create  a stamp in batch mode, pass to hashcash on stdin to verify, have it print how many bits there
           were.

       "hashcash -n 1:24:040806:foo::511801694b4cd6b0:1e7297a"
           Report the resource name from the stamp.  The resource name in the example is foo.

       "hashcash -l -e 30y 1:24:040806:foo::511801694b4cd6b0:1e7297a"
           Report how long until the stamp expires if it expires in 30 years  from  its  creation  date.   (Note
           dates  too  far  into the future run into the 2038 end of Epoch, which is the unix time analog of the
           y2k bug).

       <b>Verifying</b> <b>Stamps</b>

       "hashcash -c 1:24:040806:foo::511801694b4cd6b0:1e7297a"
           Check if the stamp is valid.  Note as we are not checking the stamp in a double spend  database,  and
           did not specify a resource name or required number of bits of preimage and hashcash will consider the
           stamp  not  fully  checked,  and it will report it as valid but not fully unchecked, or as invalid if
           there is any problem with the stamp.

       "hashcash -c -b24 1:24:040806:foo::511801694b4cd6b0:1e7297a"
           Check that the value of the stamp is greater or equal to 24 bits.  This example has 24 bit value.  If
           you increase the requested number of bits or replace the  stamp  with  one  with  less  than  24  bit
           preimage the stamp will be rejected.

       "hashcash -c -b24 -r foo 1:24:040806:foo::511801694b4cd6b0:1e7297a"
           As  above check if the stamp has sufficient value, but in addition check that the resource name given
           matches the resource name in the stamp.

       <b>Double</b> <b>Spending</b> <b>Prevention</b>

       The examples given in "Verifying Stamps" can be modified to keep a double spend database so that the same
       stamp will not be accepted twice.  Note a stamp will only be checked in and added to the database  if  it
       is  otherwise  valid  and  fully  checked (a required number of bits of preimage has been specified and a
       resource has been specified).

       "hashcash -cd -b 10 -r foo 1:24:040806:foo::511801694b4cd6b0:1e7297a"
           Check the stamp and add to double spent database  if  it's  valid  (has  correct  resource  name  and
           sufficient value).

       "hashcash -cd -b 10 -r foo 1:24:040806:foo::511801694b4cd6b0:1e7297a"
           Try to double spend the stamp.  It will be rejected as double spent.

       <b>Stamp</b> <b>Expiry</b>

       To  prevent  the  double spend database growing indefinately, the recipient can request that stamps be no
       older than a specified period.  After expiry old stamps can dropped from the  double  spend  database  as
       they  will  no  longer be needed -- expired stamps can be rejected based purely on their old date, so the
       space taken by expired stamps in the double spend database can be saved  without  risk  of  accepting  an
       expired though otherwise valid stamp.

       The  third field of the stamp is the UTC time since 1st January 1970.  The default time format is YYMMDD,
       time rounded down to the nearest day.  The default validity period is 28 days.

       You can provide an alternative validity period with the <u>-e</u> option.

       "hashcash -cd -b 10 -e 2d -r foo 1:24:040806:foo::511801694b4cd6b0:1e7297a"
           Try verifying an old stamp, the above stamp was created 11 Aug 2002.

           We gave option <u>-e</u> <u>2d</u> so the stamps expiry date is 2 days after creation, which is now in the past.

           Note: if the creation time is expressed in the stamp in  days,  the  precise  creation  date  is  the
           beginning  of  the  specified  day  in  UTC  time (similarly for alternate units the creation time is
           rounded down to the beginning of the unit it is expressed in).  For units in days, for example,  this
           may  mean  depending  on  your time zone that the stamp appears to be considered invalid in under the
           specified expiry period in days relative to your relative view of what day it is, as the  calculation
           is based on current time in UTC, and the creation time of the stamp is expressed in UTC time.

       "hashcash -cd -b 10 -r foo 1:24:040806:foo::511801694b4cd6b0:1e7297a"
           Test whether the stamp is otherwise valid, apart from having expired.  Omitting the <u>-e</u> tells hashcash
           that  the  stamp  will  never  expire.  An expiry period of forever can also be given explicitly like
           this: <u>-e</u> <u>0</u>, where an expiry period of 0 means forever.

       <b>Purging</b> <b>old</b> <b>stamps</b>

       If the <u>-c</u>, <u>-d</u> options are used together, each time a stamp is checked, if it is  valid  and  all  of  the
       mandatory aspects of the stamp are verified (preimage bits check, resource name check) then the stamp and
       its  expiry period is written to the database file.  The default expiry period if an expiry period is not
       given explicitly with the <u>-e</u> option is 28 days (ie stamps expire after 4 weeks).

       First mint and then add a stamp:

       "hashcash -m -b 10 foo -e 1m &gt; stamp"
           Note: we specified an expiry on minting in this example, to ensure that the stamp  creation  time  is
           given in high enough resolution in the stamp that the stamp will not be considered expired at time of
           creation.   (Recall  the  default resolution is in days, a stamp created with a creation time rounded
           down to the beginging of the day is unlikely to be considered valid 1 minute later unless you mint it
           at midnight UTC time.)

       "hashcash -cd -e 1m -b 10 -r foo &lt; stamp"
           The stamp expires in 1 minute.  Wait 1 minute and then explicitly  request  that  expired  stamps  be
           purged:

       "hashcash -p now"
           Then try resubmitting the same stamp:

       "hashcash -cd -e 1m -b 10 -r foo &lt; stamp"
           and  the  stamp  will  be rejected anyway as it has expired, illustrating why it was not necessary to
           keep this stamp in the database.

           With the default database (the sdb format) the database contents are human readable, so you can  view
           their contents by cating them to the terminal:

       "cat hashcash.sdb"
           to see that the stamp really is added and then after puring subsequently purged due to expiry.

       <b>Purging</b> <b>old</b> <b>stamps</b> <b>on</b> <b>Demand</b>

       As  a  convenience  you  can purge at the same time as checking stamps by using the <u>-p</u> option with the <u>-c</u>
       option.

       "hashcash -m -b 10 foo &gt; stamp"
       "hashcash -cd -p now -e 1 -b 10 -r foo &lt; stamp"
           It may be inefficient to purge stamps on every use as the entire  database  has  to  be  scanned  for
           expired  stamps.   By giving a time period to the <u>-p</u> option, you can tell "hashcash" to purge no more
           frequently than that time period since the previous purge.

           For example:

       "hashcash -cd -p 1d -e 1 -b 10 -r foo &lt; stamp"
           tells "hashcash" to purge any expired stamps no more than once per day.

       "hashcash -p 1M -j foo"
           tells "hashcash" to purge only expired stamps matching resource foo once per month.

       "hashcash -p now -k"
           tells "hashcash" to purge all stamps (expired and unexpired) now.

</pre><h4><b>stamp</b> <b>format</b> <b>(version</b> <b>1)</b></h4><pre>
       The current stamp format is version 1.  This tool can verify hashcash version 0 stamps also, but  version
       0  stamps  are  no  longer  created as they are being phased out in favor of the more extensible v1 stamp
       format.

       <u>ver</u>:<u>bits</u>:<u>date</u>:<u>resource</u>:[<u>ext</u>]:<u>rand</u>:<u>counter</u>

       where

       <u>ver</u> = 1
       <u>bits</u> = how many bits of partial-preimage the stamp is claimed to have
       <u>date</u> = YYMMDD[hhmm[ss]]
       <u>resource</u> = resource string (eg IP address, email address)
       <u>ext</u> = extension -- ignored in the current version
           Format of extension:

           [name1[=val1[,val2...]];[name2[=val1[,val2...]]...]]
               Note the value can also contain =.  Example extension (not a real one):

                       name1=2,3;name2;name3=var1=2,var2=3,2,val

               Which would be extension name1 has values 2 and 3; extension name2 has no values; extension name3
               has 3 values "var1=2", "var2=3", "2" and "val".  The hashcash extension may interpret the  values
               as it sees fit eg "var1=2" could be the value of an option to the extension name3.

       <u>rand</u> = string of random characters from alphabet a-zA-Z0-9+/= to avoid preimage with other sender's
       stamps
       <u>counter</u> = to find a stamp with the desired number of preimage bits need to try lots of different strings
       this counter is incremented on each try. The Counter is also composed of characters from the alphabet
       a-zA-Z0-9+/=.  (Note an implementation is not required to count sequentially).

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <u>hashcash.sdb</u>
           default double spend database

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       "hashcash" returns success (exit code 0) after successfully minting a stamp, after fully checking a stamp
       and finding it valid, and after a timing test.

       If  when  checking  a  stamp  it  is  found  to be invalid (due to being malformed, being expired, having
       insufficient value, having a date in the future, or being double spent), "hashcash" returns failure (exit
       code 1).

       If insufficient options are given to fully check  a  stamp,  if  the  stamp  is  otherwise  valid  return
       unchecked (exit code 2).  If the <u>-y</u> flag is given and hashcash would normally return unchecked, exit code
       success is returned instead.

       If  any exception occurs (file read failure for database checking or corrupted database contents) an exit
       status of 3 is returned.
