</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       mb2md — Converts Mbox mailboxes to Maildir format.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>mb2md</b> [-h]

       <b>mb2md</b> [<b>-c</b>]  [-m]  [<b>-d</b> <u>destdir]</u>

       <b>mb2md</b> [<b>-c</b>]  [-s <u>sourcefile</u>]  [<b>-d</b> <u>destdir]</u>

       <b>mb2md</b> [<b>-c</b>]  [-s <u>sourcedir</u>]  [<b>-l</b> <u>wu-mailboxlist]</u>  <u>[</u><b>-R|-f</b> <u>somefolder]</u>  <u>[</u><b>-d</b> <u>destdir]</u>  <u>[</u><b>-r</b> <u>strip_extension]</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>mb2md</b>     Converts Mbox mailboxes to Maildir format.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-h</b>        Show summary of options.

       <b>-c</b>        Use  the  Content-Length:  headers (if present) to find the beginning of the next message.  Use
                 with caution! Results may be unreliable. I recommend to do a run without "-c"  first  and  only
                 use it if you are certain, that the mbox in question really needs the "-c" option.

       <b>-m</b>        If  this  is  used  then the source will be the single mailbox at /var/spool/mail/blah for user
                 blah and the destination mailbox will be the "destdir" mailbox itself.

       <b>-s</b> <u>sourcedir</u>
                 Directory, relative to the  user's  home  directory,  which  is  where  the  the  "somefolders"
                 directories  are  located.   Or if directory starts with a "/" or "." it is taken as a absolute
                 path, e.g. /mnt/oldmail/user _OR_ A single mbox file which will be converted to the destdir.

       <b>-R</b>        If defined, do not skip directories found in a mailbox directory,  but  runs  recursively  into
                 each of them, creating all wanted folders in Maildir.

                 Incompatible with '-f'

       <b>-f</b> <u>somefolder</u>
                 Directories, relative to "sourcedir" where the Mbox files are. All mailboxes in the "sourcedir"
                 directory  will  be  converted  and  placed  in  the "destdir" directory.  (Typically the Inbox
                 directory which in this instance is also functioning as a folder for other mailboxes.)

                 The "somefolder" directory name will be encoded into the new mailboxes' names.  See the example
                 in the USAGE file (see below).

                 This does not save an UW IMAP dummy message file at the start of the Mbox file.  Small  changes
                 in the code could adapt it for looking for other distinctive patterns of dummy messages too.

                 Don't  let  the source directory you give as "somefolders" contain any "."s in its name, unless
                 you want to create subfolders from the IMAP user's point of view. See the example in the  USAGE
                 file (see below).

                 Incompatible with '-R'

       <b>-d</b> <u>destdir</u>
                 Directory  where  the  Maildir  format  directories  will  be  created.  If not given, then the
                 destination will be <a href="file:~/Maildir">~/Maildir</a> .  Typically, this is what the IMAP server sees as the Inbox  and
                 the  folder  for  all  user  mailboxes.  If this begins with a '/' the path is considered to be
                 absolute, otherwise it is relative to the users home directory.

       <b>-r</b> <u>strip_extension</u>
                 If defined this extension will be stripped from the original mailbox file name before  creating
                 the  corresponding maildir. The extension must be given without the leading dot (".").  See the
                 example in the USAGE file (see below).

       <b>-l</b> <u>UW-file</u>
                 File containing the list of  subscribed  folders.   If  migrating  from  UW-IMAP  the  list  of
                 subscribed  folders  will be found in the file called .mailboxlist in the users home directory.
                 This will convert all subscribed folders for a single user:

                 /bin/mb2md -s mail -l .mailboxlist -R -d Maildir

                 and for all users in a directory as root you can do the following:

                 for i in *; do echo $i;su - $i -c "/bin/mb2md -s mail -l .mailboxlist -R -d Maildir";done
