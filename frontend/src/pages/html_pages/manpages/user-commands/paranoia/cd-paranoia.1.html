</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       cd-paranoia - an audio CD reading utility which includes extra data verification features

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>cd-paranoia</b> [<b>options</b>] <b>span</b> [<b>outfile</b>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>cd-paranoia</b>  retrieves  audio tracks from CDDA capable CD-ROM drives.  The data can be saved to a file or
       directed to standard output in WAV, AIFF, AIFF-C or raw format.  Most ATAPI, SCSI and several proprietary
       CD-ROM drive makes are supported; <b>cd-paranoia</b> can determine if the target drive is CDDA capable.

       In addition to simple reading, <b>cd-paranoia</b> adds extra-robust data  verification,  synchronization,  error
       handling and scratch reconstruction capability.

       This  version  uses  the  libcdio  library  for  interaction  with  a  CD-ROM drive. The jitter and error
       correction however are the same as used in Xiph's cdparanoia.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-A</b> <b>--analyze-drive</b>
              Run and log a complete analysis of drive caching,  timing  and  reading  behavior;  verifies  that
              cdparanoia is correctly modelling a specific drive's cache and read behavior. Implies -vQL.

       <b>-v</b> <b>--verbose</b>
              Be absurdly verbose about the autosensing and reading process. Good for setup and debugging.

       <b>-q</b> <b>--quiet</b>
              Do not print any progress or error information during the reading process.

       <b>-e</b> <b>--stderr-progress</b>
              Force output of progress information to stderr (for wrapper scripts).

       <b>-V</b> <b>--version</b>
              Print the program version and quit.

       <b>-Q</b> <b>--query</b>
              Perform CD-ROM drive autosense, query and print the CD-ROM table of contents, then quit.

       <b>-h</b> <b>--help</b>
              Print a brief synopsis of <b>cd-paranoia</b> usage and options.

       <b>-l</b> <b>--log-summary</b> <u>file</u>
              Save result summary to file.

       <b>-L</b> <b>--log-debug</b> <u>file</u>
              Save detailed device autosense and debugging output to a file.

       <b>-p</b> <b>--output-raw</b>
              Output  headerless  data  as  raw 16 bit PCM data with interleaved samples in host byte order.  To
              force little or big endian byte order, use <b>-r</b> or <b>-R</b> as described below.

       <b>-r</b> <b>--output-raw-little-endian</b>
              Output headerless data as raw 16 bit PCM data with interleaved samples in LSB first byte order.

       <b>-R</b> <b>--output-raw-big-endian</b>
              Output headerless data as raw 16 bit PCM data with interleaved samples in MSB first byte order.

       <b>-w</b> <b>--output-wav</b>
              Output data in Microsoft RIFF WAV format (note that WAV data is always LSB first byte order).

       <b>-f</b> <b>--output-aiff</b>
              Output data in Apple AIFF format (note that AIFC data is always in MSB first byte order).

       <b>-a</b> <b>--output-aifc</b>
              Output data in uncompressed Apple AIFF-C format (note that AIFF-C data is always in MSB first byte
              order).

       <b>-B</b> <b>--batch</b>

              Cdda2wav-style batch output flag; cd-paranoia will split the output into multiple files  at  track
              boundaries.  Output file names are prepended with 'track#.'

       <b>-c</b> <b>--force-cdrom-little-endian</b>
              Some CD-ROM drives misreport their endianness (or do not report it at all); it's possible that cd-
              paranoia  will  guess  wrong.   Use  <b>-c</b> to force cd-paranoia to treat the drive as a little endian
              device.

       <b>-C</b> <b>--force-cdrom-big-endian</b>
              As above but force cd-paranoia to treat the drive as a big endian device.

       <b>-n</b> <b>--force-default-sectors</b> <u>n</u>
              Force the interface backend to do atomic reads  of  <b>n</b>  sectors  per  read.   This  number  can  be
              misleading;  the  kernel  will often split read requests into multiple atomic reads (the automated
              Paranoia code is aware of this) or allow reads only wihin a restricted size  range.   <b>This</b>  <b>option</b>
              <b>should</b> <b>generally</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>used.</b>

       <b>-d</b> <b>--force-cdrom-device</b> <u>device</u>
              Force  the  interface  backend  to read from <b>device</b> rather than the first readable CD-ROM drive it
              finds containing a CD-DA disc.  This can be used to specify devices of any  valid  interface  type
              (ATAPI, SCSI or proprietary).

       <b>-g</b> <b>--force-generic-device</b> <u>device</u>
              This option is an alias for <b>-d</b> and is retained for compatibility.

       <b>-S</b> <b>--force-read-speed</b> <u>number</u>
              Use  this  option  explicitly  to  set  the read rate of the CD drive (where supported).  This can
              reduce underruns on machines with slow disks, or which are low on memory.

       <b>-t</b> <b>--toc-offset</b> <u>number</u>
              Use this option to force the entire disc LBA addressing to shift by the given amount; the value is
              added to the beginning offsets in the TOC.  This can be used to shift  track  boundaries  for  the
              whole disc manually on sector granularity.  The next option does something similar...

       <b>-T</b> <b>--toc-bias</b>
              Some  drives (usually random Toshibas) report the actual track beginning offset values in the TOC,
              but then treat the beginning of track 1 index 1 as sector 0 for all read operations.  This results
              in every track seeming to start too late (losing a bit of the beginning and catching a bit of  the
              next  track).   -T  accounts  for  this behavior.  Note that this option will cause cd-paranoia to
              attempt to read sectors before or past the known user data area of the  disc,  resulting  in  read
              errors at disc edges on most drives and possibly even hard lockups on some buggy hardware.

       <b>-O</b> <b>--sample-offset</b> <u>number</u>
              Some  CD-ROM/CD-R drives will add an offset to the position on reading audio data. This is usually
              around 500-700 audio samples (ca. 1/75 second) on reading. So when cd-paranoia queries a  specific
              sector, it might not receive exactly that sector, but shifted by some amount.

       Use this option to force the entire disc to shift sample position output by the given amount; This can be
       used  to  shift  track boundaries for the whole disc manually on sample granularity. Note that if you are
       ripping something including the ending of the CD (e.g. the entire  disk),  this  option  will  cause  cd-
       paranoia  to  attempt  to  read partial sectors before or past the known user data area, probably causing
       read errors on most drives and possibly even hard lockups on some buggy hardware.

       <b>-E</b><u>--force-overread</u>
              Force overreading into the lead-out portion of the disc. This option is only applicable when using
              the +.B -O +option with a positive sample offset value. Many drives are  not  capable  of  reading
              into this portion of the disc and attempting to do so on those drives will produce read errors and
              possibly hard lockups.

       <b>-Z</b> <b>--disable-paranoia</b>
              Disable  <b>all</b>  data  verification  and  correction features.  When using -Z, cd-paranoia reads data
              exactly as would cdda2wav with an overlap setting of zero.  This option implies that <b>-Y</b> is active.

       <b>-z</b> <b>--never-skip[=max_retries]</b>
              Do not accept any skips; retry forever if needed.  An optional maximum number of  retries  can  be
              specified; for comparison, default without -z is currently 20.

       <b>-Y</b> <b>--disable-extra-paranoia</b>
              Disables  intra-read  data verification; only overlap checking at read boundaries is performed. It
              can wedge if errors occur in the attempted overlap area. Not recommended.

       <b>-X</b> <b>--abort-on-skip</b>
              If the read skips due to imperfect data, a scratch, whatever, abort reading this track.  If output
              is to a file, delete the partially completed file.

       <b>-x</b> <b>--test-flags</b> <b>mask</b>
              Simulate CD-reading errors. This is used in regression testing, but other uses might be to see how
              well a CD-ROM performs under (simulated) CD degradation. mask specifies the  artificial  kinds  of
              errors to introduced; "or"-ing values from the selection below will simulate the kind of specified
              failure.

       <b>OUTPUT</b> <b>SMILIES</b>

              :-) Normal operation, low/no jitter

              :-| Normal operation, considerable jitter

              :-/ Read drift

              :-P Unreported loss of streaming in atomic read operation

              8-| Finding read problems at same point during reread; hard to correct

              :-0 SCSI/ATAPI transport error

              :-( Scratch detected

</pre><h4><b>PROGRESS</b> <b>BAR</b> <b>SYMBOLS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>&lt;space&gt;</b>
              No corrections needed

              - Jitter correction required

              + Unreported loss of streaming/other error in read

              !   Errors found after stage 1 correction; the drive is making the same error through multiple re-
              reads, and cd-paranoia is having trouble detecting them.

              e SCSI/ATAPI transport error (corrected)

              V Uncorrected error/skip

</pre><h4><b>SPAN</b> <b>ARGUMENT</b></h4><pre>
       The span argument specifies which track, tracks or subsections of  tracks  to  read.   This  argument  is
       required.   <b>NOTE:</b>  Unless  the  span  is  a  simple  number, it's generally a good idea to quote the span
       argument to protect it from the shell.

       The span argument may be a simple track number  or  an  offset/span  specification.   The  syntax  of  an
       offset/span takes the rough form:

       1[ww:xx:yy.zz]-2[aa:bb:cc.dd]

       Here,  1  and  2  are  track  numbers;  the  numbers  in brackets provide a finer grained offset within a
       particular track. [aa:bb:cc.dd] is in hours/minutes/seconds/sectors  format.  Zero  fields  need  not  be
       specified:  [::20],  [:20],  [20], [20.], etc, would be interpreted as twenty seconds, [10:] would be ten
       minutes, [.30] would be thirty sectors (75 sectors per second).

       When only a single offset is supplied, it is interpreted as a starting offset and ripping  will  continue
       to  the  end  of the track.  If a single offset is preceded or followed by a hyphen, the implicit missing
       offset is taken to be the start or end of the disc, respectively. Thus:

       <b>1:[20.35]</b>
              Specifies ripping from track 1, second 20, sector 35 to the end of track 1.

       <b>1:[20.35]-</b>
              Specifies ripping from 1[20.35] to the end of the disc

       <b>-2</b>     Specifies ripping from the beginning of the disc up to (and including) track 2

       <b>-2:[30.35]</b>
              Specifies ripping from the beginning of the disc up to 2:[30.35]

       <b>2-4</b>    Specifies ripping from the beginning of track 2 to the end of track 4.

       Again, don't forget to protect square brackets and preceding hyphens from the shell.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       A few examples, protected from the shell:

       Query only with exhaustive search for a drive and full reporting of autosense:

              cd-paranoia -vsQ

       Extract an entire disc, putting each track in a separate file:

              cd-paranoia -B

       Extract from track 1, time 0:30.12 to 1:10.00:

              cd-paranoia "1[:30.12]-1[1:10]"

       Extract from the beginning of the disc up to track 3:

              cd-paranoia -- "-3"

       The "--" above is to distinguish "-3" from an option flag.

</pre><h4><b>OUTPUT</b></h4><pre>
       The output file argument is optional; if it is not specified, cd-paranoia will output samples to  one  of
       <b>cdda.wav</b>,  <b>cdda.aifc</b>,  or  <b>cdda.raw</b>  depending  on  whether  <b>-w</b>, <b>-a</b>, <b>-r</b> or <b>-R</b> is used (<b>-w</b> is the implicit
       default).  The output file argument of <b>-</b> specifies standard output; all data formats may be piped.

</pre><h4><b>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       cd-paranoia  sprang  from  and  once   drew   heavily   from   the   interface   of   Heiko   Eissfeldt's
       (<a href="mailto:heiko@colossus.escape.de">heiko@colossus.escape.de</a>) 'cdda2wav' package. cd-paranoia would not have happened without it.

       Joerg Schilling has also contributed SCSI expertise through his generic SCSI transport library.
