</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       rubberband — an audio time-stretching and pitch-shifting utility program

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>rubberband</b> [<u>options]</u>  <u>[input</u> <u>file]</u>  <u>[output</u> <u>file]</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This manual page documents briefly the <b>rubberband</b> command.

       Rubber  Band  is  a  program  that  permits  you  to  change  the  tempo  and pitch of an audio recording
       independently of one another.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       These programs follow the usual GNU command line syntax, with  long  options  starting  with  two  dashes
       (`--').  A summary of options is included below.

       You must specify at least one of the following time and pitch ratio options.

       <b>-t</b>, <b>--time</b> <u>X</u>
                 Stretch to <u>X</u> times original duration, or

       <b>-T</b>, <b>--tempo</b> <u>X</u>
                 Change tempo by multiple <u>X</u> (equivalent to --time 1/X), or

       <b>-T</b>, <b>--tempo</b> <u>X</u>:<u>Y</u>
                 Change tempo from <u>X</u> to <u>Y</u> (same as --time X/Y), or

       <b>-D</b>, <b>--duration</b> <u>X</u>
                 Stretch or squash to make output file <u>X</u> seconds long

       <b>-p</b>, <b>--pitch</b> <u>X</u>
                 Raise pitch by <u>X</u> semitones, or

       <b>-f</b>, <b>--frequency</b> <u>X</u>
                 Change frequency by multiple <u>X</u>

       The following options provide ways of making the time and frequency ratios change during the audio:

       <b>-M</b>, <b>--timemap</b> <u>F</u>
                 Use file F as the source for time map

       A  time  map  (or  key-frame  map)  file  contains  a series of lines, each with two sample frame numbers
       separated by a single space. These are source and target frames for fixed time points  within  the  audio
       data,  defining a varying stretch factor through the audio. When supplying a time map you must specify an
       overall stretch factor using -t, -T, or -D as well, to determine the total output duration.

           <b>--pitchmap</b> <u>F</u>
                 Use file F as the source for pitch map

       A pitch map file contains a series of lines, each with two values: the input sample frame  number  and  a
       pitch  offset in semitones, separated by a single space. These specify a varying pitch factor through the
       audio. The offsets are all relative to an initial offset specified by the pitch or frequency  option,  or
       relative  to  no shift if neither was specified. Offsets are not cumulative. This option implies realtime
       mode (-R) and also enables a high-consistency pitch shifting mode, appropriate for dynamic pitch changes.
       Because of the use of realtime mode, the overall duration will not be exact.

           <b>--freqmap</b> <u>F</u>
                 Use file F as the source for freq map

       A frequency map file is like a pitch map, except that  its  second  column  lists  frequency  multipliers
       rather than pitch offsets (like the difference between pitch and frequency options above)

       The following options affect the sound manipulation and quality

       <b>-2</b>, <b>--fast</b>
                 Use the R2 (faster) engine

       This  is  the  default (for backward compatibility) when this tool is invoked as "rubberband". It was the
       only engine available in versions prior to v3.0.

       <b>-3</b>, <b>--fine</b>
                 Use the R3 (finer) engine

       This is the default when this tool is invoked  as  "rubberband-r3".  It  almost  always  produces  better
       results than the R2 engine, but with significantly higher CPU load.

       <b>-F</b>, <b>--formant</b>
                 Enable formant preservation when pitch shifting

       This  option  attempts  to  keep  the  formant  envelope unchanged when changing the pitch, retaining the
       original timbre of vocals and instruments in a recognisable way.

       <b>-c</b>, <b>--crisp</b> <u>N</u>
                 Crispness (N = 0,1,2,3,4,5); default 4 (see below)

       This option only has an effect when using the R2 (faster) engine. See below for details of the  different
       levels.

       The remaining options fine-tune the processing mode and stretch algorithm.  The default is to use none of
       these options.  The options marked (2) currently only have an effect when using the R2 engine (see -2, -3
       options above).

       <b>-R</b>, <b>--realtime</b>
                 Select  realtime  mode  (implies  --no-threads).   This  utility  does  not  do realtime stream
                 processing; the option merely selects realtime mode for the stretcher it uses

       <b>--no-threads</b>
                 No extra threads regardless of CPU and channel count (R2)

       <b>--threads</b> Assume multi-CPU even if only one CPU is identified (R2)

       <b>--no-transients</b>
                 Disable phase resynchronisation at transients (R2)

       <b>--bl-transients</b>
                 Band-limit phase resync to extreme frequencies (R2)

       <b>--no-lamination</b>
                 Disable phase lamination (R2)

       <b>--smoothing</b>
                 Apply window presum and time-domain smoothing (R2)

       <b>--detector-perc</b>
                 Use percussive transient detector (as in pre-1.5) (R2)

       <b>--detector-soft</b>
                 Use soft transient detector (R2)

       <b>--window-long</b>
                 Use longer processing window (actual size may vary) (R2)

       <b>--window-short</b>
                 Use shorter processing window (with the R3 engine this is effectively a quick "draft mode")

       <b>--pitch-hq</b>
                 In RT mode, use a slower, higher quality pitch shift

       <b>--centre-focus</b>
                 reserve focus of centre material in stereo (at a cost in width and individual channel quality)

       <b>--ignore-clipping</b>
                 Ignore clipping at output; the default is to restart with reduced gain if clipping occurs

       <b>-L</b>, <b>--loose</b>
                 [Accepted for compatibility but ignored; always off]

       <b>-P</b>, <b>---precise</b>
                 [Accepted for compatibility but ignored; always on]

       <b>-d</b>, <b>--debug</b> <u>N</u>
                 Select debug level (N = 0,1,2,3); default 0, full 3 (N.B. debug level 3 includes audible  ticks
                 in output)

       The following options are for output control and administration:

       <b>-q</b>, <b>--quiet</b>
                 Suppress progress output

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--version</b>
                 Show version number and exit

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
                 Show the normal help output

       <b>-H</b>, <b>--full-help</b>
                 Show the full help output

       "Crispness" levels:

       0         equivalent to --no-transients --no-lamination --window-long

       1         equivalent to --detector-soft --no-lamination --window-long (for piano)

       2         equivalent to --no-transients --no-lamination

       3         equivalent to --no-transients

       4         equivalent to --bl-transients

       5         default processing options

       6         equivalent to --no-lamination --window-short (may be good for drums)
