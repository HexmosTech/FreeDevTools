</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       vis-menu — Interactively select an item from a list

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>vis-menu</b> [<b>-i</b>] [<b>-t</b> | <b>-b</b>] [<b>-p</b> <u>prompt</u>] [<b>-l</b> <u>lines</u>] [<u>initial</u>]
       <b>vis-menu</b> [<b>-v</b>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>vis-menu</b> allows a user to interactively select one item from a list of options.  A newline-separated list
       of  items  is read from standard input, then the list of items is drawn directly onto the terminal so the
       user may select one.  Finally, the selected item is printed to standard output.

       For information on actually navigating the menu, see “USAGE” below.

       <b>-i</b>    Use case-insensitive comparison when filtering items.

       <b>-t</b> | <b>-b</b>
             Normally, the menu is displayed on the current line of the terminal.  When <b>-t</b> is provided, the menu
             will always be drawn on the top line of the terminal.  When <b>-b</b> is provided, the menu will always be
             drawn on the bottom line.

       <b>-p</b> <u>prompt</u>
             Display <u>prompt</u> before the list of items.

       <b>-l</b> <u>lines</u>
             Normally, the list is displayed with all the items side-by-side on a single line, which  is  space-
             efficient  but does not show many items at a time, especially if some of them are long.  When <b>-l</b> is
             provided, the list is displayed with each item on its own line, <u>lines</u> lines  high.   If  there  are
             more  than <u>lines</u> items in the list, the user can scroll through them with the arrow keys, just like
             in the regular horizontal mode.

       <u>initial</u>
             The user can type into a text field to filter the list of items as well as scrolling through  them.
             If supplied, <u>initial</u> is used as the initial content of the text field.

       <b>-v</b>    Instead  of  displaying  an interactive menu, <b>vis-menu</b> prints its version number to standard output
             and exits.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       <b>vis-menu</b> displays the prompt (if any), a text field, and a list of items.  Normally these  are  presented
       side-by-side  in  a  single  line, but if the <b>-l</b> flag is given, the prompt and typing area will be on the
       first line, and list items on the following lines.

       The following commands are available:

       <b>Enter</b>      selects the currently-highlighted list item and exits.

       <b>Control-\</b> or <b>Control-]</b>
                  selects the current contents of the text field (even if it does not appear in  the  list)  and
                  exits.

       <b>ESC</b> <b>ESC</b> or <b>Control-C</b>
                  exit without selecting any item.

       <b>Down</b> or <b>Control-N</b>
                  scroll forward through the available list items.

       <b>Up</b> or <b>Control-P</b>
                  scroll backward through the available list items.

       <b>Right</b> or <b>Control-F</b>
                  move the cursor forward through the typed text, and scroll through the available list items.

       <b>Left</b> or <b>Control-B</b>
                  move the cursor backward through the typed text, and scroll through the available list items.

       <b>PageUp</b> or <b>Control-V</b>
                  scrolls to show the previous page of list items.

       <b>PageDown</b> or <b>Meta-v</b>
                  scrolls to show the next page of list items.

       <b>Home</b> or <b>Control-A</b>
                  move the cursor to the beginning of the text field or scroll to the first item in the list.

       <b>End</b> or <b>Control-E</b>
                  move the cursor to the end of the text field or scroll to the last item in the list.

       <b>Meta-b</b>     moves the cursor to the beginning of the current word in the text field.

       <b>Meta-f</b>     moves the cursor past the end of the current word in the text field.

       <b>Tab</b>        copies  the  content  of  the selected list item into the text field.  This is almost, but not
                  quite, like tab completion.

       <b>Delete</b> or <b>Control-D</b>
                  delete the character in the text field under the cursor.

       <b>Backspace</b>  deletes the character in the text field to the left of the cursor.

       <b>Meta-d</b>     deletes the characters in the text field from the character  under  the  cursor  to  the  next
                  space.

       <b>Control-K</b>  deletes the characters in the text field from the character under the cursor to the end.

       <b>Control-U</b>  deletes  the  characters  in  the  text field from the beginning up to (but not including) the
                  character under the cursor.

       <b>Control-W</b>  deletes the characters in the text field from the previous space up to (but not including) the
                  character under the cursor.

       All other non-control characters will be inserted into the text field at the current cursor position.

       When there is text in the text field, only list items that include the given text will be shown.  If  the
       text  contains  one  or  more  spaces,  each  space-delimited  string is a separate filter and only items
       matching every filter will be shown.

       If the user filters out all  the  items  from  the  list,  then  hits  Enter  to  select  the  “currently
       highlighted” item, the text they typed will be returned instead.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Here's a shell-script that allows the user to choose a number from one to 10:

             NUMBER=$(seq 1 10 | vis-menu -p "Choose a number")
             if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
                     echo "You chose: $NUMBER"
             else
                     echo "You refused to choose a number, or an error occurred."
             fi

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>vis-menu</b>  utility exits 0 if the user successfully selected an item from the list, and 1 if the user
       cancelled.

       If an internal error occurs, the <b>vis-menu</b> utility prints a message to standard error and terminates  with
       an exit status greater than 1.  Potential error conditions include being unable to allocate memory, being
       unable to read from standard input, or being run without a controlling terminal.

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       The original model for a single line menu reading items from standard input was <u><a href="../man1/dmenu.1.html">dmenu</a></u>(1) which implements
       the idea for X11.  <b>dmenu</b> is available from <b><a href="http://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/">http://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/</a></b>

       The  code  was  subsequently  re-worked  for  ANSI  terminal  output as <u><a href="../man1/slmenu.1.html">slmenu</a></u>(1) which is available from
       <b>https://bitbucket.org/rafaelgg/slmenu/</b>

       Since <b>slmenu</b> did not appear to be maintained, it was forked to become <b>vis-menu</b>  to  be  distributed  with
       <u><a href="../man1/vis.1.html">vis</a></u>(1).
