</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       epgsearch - Searchtimer and replacement of the VDR program menu

</pre><h4><b>OVERVIEW</b></h4><pre>
       EPG-Search can be used as a replacement for the default schedules menu entry. It looks like the standard
       schedules menu, but adds some additional functions:

        - Commands for EPG entries with 5 built-in commands like 'show repeats',
          'create search'. One can add own commands for other needs, like adding a
          VDRAdmin auto-timer.

        - Add up to 4 user-defined times to 'now' and 'next' and an optional
          favorites menu

        - Searching the EPG: Create reusable queries, which can also be used
          as 'search timers'.

        - Search timers: Search for broadcasts in the background and add a
          timer if one matches (similar to VDRAdmin's auto-timers) or simply
          make an announcement about it via OSD

        - Avoid double recordings of the same event
          * timer preview
          * recognition of broken recordings
          * fuzzy event comparison

        - Progress bar in 'What's on now' and 'What's on next'

        - Shift the time displayed by key press, e.g. 'What's on now' + 30 minutes

        - Start menu can be setup between 'Schedule' or 'What's on now'

        - background check for timer conflicts with a timer conflict manager

        - detailed EPG menu (summary) allows jumping to the next/previous
          event

        - support for extended EPG info for search timers

        - extension of the timer edit menu with a directory item, user
          defined weekday selection and a subtitle completion.

        - Timer conflict check, informs you over the OSD about conflicts

        - Timer conflict menu, show detailed information about the conflicts
          and let you resolve them

        - Email notifications about search timer updates and timer conflicts

       Parts of the sources are based on the repeating-ECG patch from Gerhard Steiner, who gave me the
       permission to use them. Thanks for his work!

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       -f file,  --svdrpsendcmd=file
           the path to svdrpsend for external SVDRP communication (default is internal communication, so this is
           usually not needed anymore)

       -c path,  --config=path
           to  specify  a  specific  config  directory  for  all  epgsearch  config  files, default is '&lt;plugins
           configuration directory&gt;/epgsearch'

       -l file,  --logfile=file
           to specify a specific log file for epgsearch (default log file  is  epgsearch.log  in  the  epgsearch
           config directory)

       -v n,  --verbose=n
           verbose  level  for  log  file.  Value  0  means no logging. Other values are 1 (general messages), 2
           (detailed messages), 3 (planned for extra detailed info for debugging purposes)

       -r,  --reloadmenuconf
           reload epgsearchmenu.conf with plugin call. This can be useful when testing customized menu layouts.

       -m file,  --mailcmd=file
           the external command to be used for mail delivery. The default uses 'sendEmail.pl'. If you are  using
           a different command or script make sure that it has the same parameter interface as sendEmail.pl.

</pre><h4><b>1.</b> <b>Description</b></h4><pre>
       At  first glance EPG-Search looks like the schedules menu entry of VDR.  By pressing the key '0', one can
       toggle the bottom color keys to access additional functions (the default assignment of the color keys can
       be adjusted by setup):

   <b>1.1</b> <b>Menu</b> <b>Commands</b>
       This menu displays commands that can be executed on the current item. There are 8 built-in commands:

        - Repeats: Searches for repeats

        - Record

        - Switch

        - Create search
          Switches to search menu and adds a new search with the name of the current
          item (to avoid editing the name manually)

        - Search in recordings:
          Search the recordings for a broadcast with the same name

        - Mark as 'already recorded':
          This puts the selected event into the file epgsearchdone.data and instructs
          epgsearch to avoid recording this event if an according search timer is set
          to "avoid repeats". An already created timer will be automatically removed
          with the next search timer update.

        - Add/Remove to/from switch list?:
          Controls the switch list. If there is an event in the switch list, epgsearch
          will announce it and switch to the event before it starts. To access the
          complete switch list, call 'Search/Actions/Switch list'.

        - Create blacklist:
          A blacklist is used to ignore events when using search timers. A search
          timer can be setup to ignore events from arbitrary blacklists.

       You can add your own commands to this menu by editing the file epgsearchcmds.conf in the epgsearch config
       directory. There's a sample conf file with some sample commands  (see  directory  'scripts',  taken  from
       vdr-wiki.de, thanks to the authors).

       The format of the file is the same as VDR's commands.conf or reccmds.conf. When a command is executed the
       following parameters are passed to it:

        $1: the title of the EPG entry
        $2: the start time of the EPG entry as time_t value (like in the
            shutdown script)
        $3: the end time
        $4: the channel number of the EPG entry
        $5: the long channel name of the EPG entry
        $6: the subtitle of the EPG entry, "" if not present

       To  execute  a  command  from  the main menu you can also press its associated number without opening the
       commands menu.

   <b>1.2</b> <b>Menu</b> <b>search</b>
       Here you can add, edit, delete and execute your own queries on the EPG. The usage and  behavior  of  this
       menu is similar to VDR's timer menu.

       <u>1.2.1</u> <u>Menu</u> <u>edit</u> <u>search</u>

       Most things in this menu are quite clear, so only some notes on:

       - <b>Search</b> <b>term:</b>
           The  term  to search for. If you like to search for more words, separate them by blanks. Leaving this
           empty (combined with search mode 'Phrase') will match anything. This is useful, if  you  search  e.g.
           for anything that starts between some times on a specific channel.

           With  'blue'  you  can  also  select a template for the new search. If one of the templates is set to
           default, new searches will automatically get the settings of the default template.

           Note: fuzzy searching is limited to 32 chars!

       - <b>Search</b> <b>mode:</b>
           'Phrase' searches for the expression within the EPG. 'All words' requires,  that  each  word  of  the
           expression  occurs  in  the EPG item.  'at least one word' requires, that only one word occurs in the
           EPG item.  'Match exactly' requires, that your search term matches exactly the found title,  subtitle
           or description.

           With 'Regular expression' you can setup a regular expression as search term. You don't need a leading
           and  trailing '/' in the expression. By default these are POSIX extended regular expressions.  If you
           like to have Herl compatible regular expression, simply  edit  the  plugins  Makefile  and  uncomment
           '#REGEXLIB  =  pcre' to 'REGEXLIB = pcre' (you will need pcreposix installed, comes with libpcre from
           www.pcre.org, but it's already part of most distributions).

           See also <a href="../man4/epgsearch.4.html">epgsearch</a>(4) 'Description of the search process'.

       - <b>Use</b> <b>content</b> <b>descriptor</b>
           Some   providers   deliver    content    descriptors    in    their    EPG,    like    "Movie/Drama",
           "Documentation",...(available  with  vdr-1.7.11)  Select here the descriptors to search for. Multiple
           choice is possible, that must match with all given descriptors (AND operator).

       - <b>Use</b> <b>extended</b> <b>EPG</b> <b>info:</b>
           Only available if configured, see below 'Using extended EPG info'.

       - <b>Ignore</b> <b>missing</b> <b>categories:</b>
           If set to 'Yes' this tells epgsearch that a missing EPG category should not exclude an event from the
           results. Caution: Using this without any other criterions could flood your timers.

       - <b>Use</b> <b>channel:</b>
           Search only for events in the given channels interval, channel groups or FTA channels only.

           Channel groups (e.g. sport channels or Pay-TV channels) can be managed with a  sub-menu  called  with
           'blue'.

           ATTENTION: After changing the channels order please check the settings of your search timers!

       - <b>Use</b> <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>week:</b>
           Besides  the  weekdays  you  can also set up a user-defined selection, e.g. search only on Monday and
           Friday.

           You'll find the user-defined selection in the list after Friday.

       - <b>Use</b> <b>blacklists:</b>
           Blacklists are a way to exclude unwanted events. Select only global,  one,  more  or  all  blacklists
           here. If any search result is also contained in one of the selected blacklists it will be skipped.

       - <b>Use</b> <b>in</b> <b>favorites</b> <b>menu:</b>
           Only  available  if  turned  on  in  setup.  With this option you can mark a search to be used in the
           favorites menu. The search results of all these searches are listed in the favorites menu.

       - <b>Result</b> <b>menu</b> <b>layout:</b>
           Only  available  if  you  have  defined  more  than  one  menu  template  for   search   results   in
           epgsearchmenu.conf.  This  option is used to assign a different menu layout for the search results of
           this search.

       - <b>Use</b> <b>as</b> <b>Search</b> <b>Timer:</b>
           If set to yes, the plugin will do a background scan of the EPG in certain intervals and add a  timer,
           if  there is a match. You have to activate the 'search timers' in the setup. If set to "user defined"
           one can specify time margins with key 'blue' where the search timer is active or not.

       - <b>Action:</b>
           Default action is creating a timer for the search results. But you can also choose to simply announce
           the found event via OSD as soon as it is found or to automatically switch  to  the  event  before  it
           starts.  It's  also  possible to get an announcement via OSD before the event starts and to switch to
           its channel with 'Ok'.

       - <b>Serial</b> <b>recording:</b>
           If set to yes, the recordings will be stored in a folder with the name of the  broadcasting  and  the
           recordings  itself  will have the name of the episode. If there is no episode name, the date and time
           of the recording will be used.

       - <b>Directory:</b>
           Here you can assign a directory, where the recording should be stored,  e.g.  'SciFi'.  Use  the  key
           'blue'  to  select  directory entries already used in other search entries or given by entries in the
           file epgsearchdirs.conf (simply place your directories here one at  each  line  without  the  leading
           video  directory,  also  see  MANUAL).  If your provider delivers extended EPG infos you can also use
           variables like "%Genre%" or "%Category%" in your directory entry. These are replaced with the current
           EPG info, when a timer is created.

           See also <a href="../man4/epgsearch.4.html">epgsearch</a>(4) 'Using variables in the directory entry of a search timer'.

       - <b>Delete</b> <b>recordings</b> <b>after</b> <b>...</b> <b>days:</b>
           Some recordings should only be kept for a few days,  like  news.  With  this  feature  you  can  tell
           epgsearch to delete them automatically after ... days.

       - <b>Pause</b> <b>if</b> <b>...</b> <b>recordings</b> <b>exist:</b>
           If  the  given numbers of recordings currently exists, then epgsearch will not create further timers.
           After deleting one or more recordings it will go on generating new timers.

       - <b>Avoid</b> <b>repeats:</b>
           If you don't want  to  record  repeats,  this  feature  tries  to  check  if  an  event  was  already
           recorded/programmed  and  skips  it.  Please  refer  to the section 'Avoid repeats - internals' below
           before using it.

       - <b>Allowed</b> <b>repeats:</b>
           If you like to accept a certain amount of repeats you can give here their number.

       - <b>Only</b> <b>repeats</b> <b>within</b> <b>...</b> <b>days:</b>
           Give here the number of days a  repeat  has  to  follow  its  first  broadcast.  0  is  equal  to  no
           restriction.

       - <b>Compare</b> <b>title:</b>
           When comparing to events then specify here if the title should be compared.

       - <b>Compare</b> <b>subtitle:</b>
           When  comparing  to events then specify here if the subtitle should be compared. With 'yes' epgsearch
           will classify two events only as equal if their episode names match and are not empty.   With  'allow
           empty'  two  events may be equal if both subtitles are empty.  Normally you would choose "no" in this
           case.

       - <b>Compare</b> <b>description:</b>
           When comparing to events then specify here if the description should be compared.

           For comparison all parts of the description, that look like a category value, are removed first.  The
           remaining  text  will  be compared. If this is similar at the value of the next option (regarding the
           Levinshtein-Distance algorithm) then it will be accepted as equal.

       - "Min. match in %:"
           The needed minimum match of descriptions in percent.

       - <b>Compare</b> <b>date:</b>
           Sometimes an event is repeated many times within some period (day, week, month,...), but  one  cannot
           distinguish  the repeats based on the EPG contents. So the only information is its time.  To use this
           for comparison select the appropriate period.

       - <b>Compare</b> <b>categories:</b>
           With the button 'setup' you can also specify which categories should be compared. As  with  subtitles
           an event is different if it has no according category value.

       - <b>Priority,</b> <b>lifetime,</b> <b>margins</b> <b>for</b> <b>start</b> <b>and</b> <b>stop:</b>
           Each  search  timer  can have its own settings for these parameters.  Defaults can be adjusted in the
           plugins setup.

       - <b>VPS:</b>
           If set to yes, VPS is used, but only, if activated in VDR's setup menu and if  the  broadcasting  has
           VPS information.

       - <b>Auto</b> <b>delete:</b>
           to automatically delete a search timer if the following is true:

            * after x recordings, or
            * after x days after the first recording

           Only  complete  recordings  are  counted.  The  deletion  is executed directly after the correspondig
           recording

       To toggle the flag 'Use as search timer' without editing the search entry you can use the key  '2'.  This
       will call directly the second command of the command menu.

       <u>1.2.2</u> <u>Menu</u> <u>search</u> <u>results</u>

       This  menu displays the search results. A 'T' lets you know, that there is already a timer for the event.
       A 't' means that there's only a partial timer for it, as in standard schedules menu.

   <b>1.3</b> <b>Extended</b> <b>'now'</b> <b>and</b> <b>'next'</b> <b>and</b> <b>favorites</b>
       By setup, one can add up to 4 additional times to extend  the  green  button,  e.g.  'afternoon',  'prime
       time',  'late  night'.  Times,  that  are  already  passed,  are skipped (you will not get 'afternoon' at
       evening) with the exception that a time will be displayed for the next day, if it is less then 20h in the
       future.  In these menus you can shift the currently displayed time by pressing FastRew or FastFwd to move
       back and forward in time. If you don't have these keys on your remote, you can access  this  function  by
       pressing  '0'  to  toggle  the green and yellow button to '&lt;&lt;' and '&gt;&gt;'. This toggling can be adjusted by
       setup.

       You can display a progress bar in 'now' and 'next'.

       Furthermore you can enable in the setup an favorites list. You can configure your searchtimers  ("Use  in
       favorite  list")  to  display  their results in you favorite list. This list display event in the next 24
       hours ordered by time.

   <b>1.4</b> <b>Menu</b> <b>setup</b>
       <u>1.4.1</u> <u>General</u>

       - <b>Hide</b> <b>main</b> <b>menu</b> <b>entry:</b>
           This hides the main menu entry 'search'. Attention: when the plugin is assigned to key  'green'  then
           hiding the plugin will give you VDR's standard schedule menu (see below to avoid this).

       - <b>Main</b> <b>menu</b> <b>entry:</b>
           If  not hidden, the name of main menu entry can be set here. Default is 'Program guide'. Note: If you
           set it to something different from the default then the main menu entry is no longer dependent on the
           OSD language. Setting it back to default or empty restores this behavior again.

       - <b>Start</b> <b>menu:</b>
           Select the starting menu 'Schedules' or 'Now'

       <u>1.4.2</u> <u>EPG</u> <u>menus</u>

       - <b>Ok</b> <b>key:</b>
           Choose here the behavior of key 'Ok'. You can use it to display the  summary  or  to  switch  to  the
           corresponding  channel.  Note:  the  functionality of key 'blue' (Switch/Info/Search) depends on this
           setting.

       - <b>Red</b> <b>key:</b>
           Select if you like to have Standard ('Record') or 'Commands' as assignment for key 'red'.

       - <b>Blue</b> <b>key:</b>
           select if you like to have Standard ('Switch') or 'Search' as assignment for key 'blue'.

       - <b>Show</b> <b>progress</b> <b>in</b> <b>'Now':</b>
           In the menu 'what's on now' you can display a progress bar, that displays the progress of the current
           item.

       - <b>Show</b> <b>channel</b> <b>numbers:</b>
           Select this if you like to have a leading channel number before each item in the EPG menus.

       - <b>Show</b> <b>channel</b> <b>separators:</b>
           Display channel group separators between channel in the menus 'Overview now',...

       - <b>Show</b> <b>day</b> <b>separators:</b>
           Display a day separator between events on different days in the schedule menu.

       - <b>Show</b> <b>radio</b> <b>channels:</b>
           Also list radio channels.

       - <b>Limit</b> <b>channels</b> <b>from</b> <b>1</b> <b>to:</b>
           If you have a large channel set you can speed up things when you limit the  displayed  channels  with
           this  setting.  Use '0' to disable the limit. If the current channel is above the limit, the limit is
           ignored and all channels will be displayed again.

       - <b>'One</b> <b>press'</b> <b>timer</b> <b>creation:</b>
           If set to 'yes' a timer is immediately created when pressing 'Record', else the timer  edit  menu  is
           displayed.

       - <b>Show</b> <b>channels</b> <b>without</b> <b>EPG:</b>
           Display channels without EPG to allow switching or create a timer.

       - <b>Time</b> <b>interval</b> <b>for</b> <b>FR/FF</b> <b>[min]:</b>
           In  the  menus 'now', 'next', 'user def 1', ... you can shift the displayed time by pressing FastRew,
           FastFwd on your remote control.  Adjust the amount of minutes to jump here.

       - <b>Toggle</b> <b>Green/Yellow:</b>
           If you don't have FastRew, FastFwd on your remote control, set this to yes. When pressing '0' in  the
           menus,  this  toggles  the assignment of the color keys and assigns e.g. '&lt;&lt;' and '&gt;&gt;' to 'green' and
           'yellow'.

       - <b>Show</b> <b>favorites</b> <b>menu:</b>
           A favorites menu can display a list  of  your  favorite  broadcasts.  Enable  this  if  you  want  an
           additional menu besides 'Now' and 'Next'. You can choose between displaying this menu before or after
           the  menus  with  user-defined  times. Any search can be used as a favorite. You only have to set the
           option 'Use in favorites menu' when editing a search.

       - <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>...</b> <b>hours:</b>
           This value lets you adjust the timespan used to display the favorites.

       <u>1.4.3</u> <u>User-defined</u> <u>EPG</u> <u>times</u>

       - <b>Use</b> <b>user</b> <b>time</b> <b>1..4:</b>
           Add up to 4 user-defined times besides 'now' and 'next'.

       - <b>Description:</b>
           Name of the user-defined time, e.g. 'Afternoon', 'Prime time', 'Late night'.

       - <b>Time:</b>
           The associated time of the user-defined time.

       <u>1.4.4</u> <u>Timer</u> <u>programming</u>

       - <b>Use</b> <b>VDR's</b> <b>timer</b> <b>edit</b> <b>menu:</b>
           When programming a standard timer epgsearch uses an extended menu, that  also  supports  a  directory
           item,  user  defined weekday selection and subtitle completion. If you are using a patched version of
           VDR, that also has an extended timer edit menu and like to use this menu rather than epgsearch's then
           set this option to 'Yes'.

       - <b>Default</b> <b>recording</b> <b>directory:</b>
           This entry will be used in standard timer programming as default directory.  You  can  also  use  EPG
           category  variables  (e.g.  'My  Movies~%Category%~%Genre%').  When  the  timer edit menu is launched
           epgsearch tries to replace all variables with the values found in the description of  the  event.  If
           not all variables could be replaced then the directory item is left blank.

       - <b>Add</b> <b>episode</b> <b>to</b> <b>manual</b> <b>timers:</b>
           When  manually  adding  a  timer  epgsearch  can automatically add the episode name to the timer file
           resulting in a sub-folder for the later recording, that is named with the episode name.  Choose  here
           how  this  should  be  done.  'smart' tries to recognize if this makes sense. Therefore it checks the
           length of the event and skips the subtitle if the event has more than 80min.

       - <b>Default</b> <b>timer</b> <b>check</b> <b>method:</b>
           Manual timers can be checked for EPG changes. Here you can setup the default check  method  for  each
           channel. The following methods exist:
              * no check
              * by event ID: checks by an event ID supplied by the channel provider.
              * by channel and time: check by the duration match.

           Not  all channels provide a proper event ID, so you can setup the default for each channel here. When
           programming a manual timer, this default use used in epgsearch's own timer edit menu.

       <u>1.4.5</u> <u>Search</u> <u>and</u> <u>search</u> <u>timers</u>

       - <b>Use</b> <b>search</b> <b>timers:</b>
           If yes, the plugin makes a background scan of the EPG and adds timers if it finds  matching  entries.
           This applies only to searches that are marked with 'use as search timer'.

           Search timers will always be created local, even if SVDRPDefaulthost is set to a different host.

       - <b>Update</b> <b>interval:</b>
           The update interval of the background scan for search timers in minutes.

       - <b>SVDRP</b> <b>port:</b>
           For  VDR  versions  through  1.7.14, the default SVDRP port was 2001. Starting with vdr-1.7.15 it was
           changed to 6419. If you want to use a port other than the default, set it  here  to  get  the  search
           timers working.

       - <b>Delay</b> <b>threads:</b>
           The start of the Searchtimer-Update Thread and the following Conflict check can be delayed after VDR-
           Ready between 0 and 300 seconds (Default is 10 secs).

       - <b>Default</b> <b>Priority:</b>
           Default priority of generated timers.

       - <b>Default</b> <b>Lifetime:</b>
           Default lifetime of generated timers.

       - <b>Margin</b> <b>at</b> <b>start/stop:</b>
           Default margins of generated timers.

       - <b>Allowed</b> <b>Errors:</b>
           Allowed errors before a recording is marked as incomplete.  (not available in vdr 2.4)

       - <b>No</b> <b>announcements</b> <b>when</b> <b>replaying:</b>
           suppress event announcements while any replay is active.

       - <b>Recreate</b> <b>timers</b> <b>after</b> <b>deletion:</b>
           epgsearch  remembers  by  default  which  timers  where already created by search timers and will not
           recreate them if they were removed. To disable this behaviour set this to 'Yes'.

       - <b>Check</b> <b>if</b> <b>EPG</b> <b>exists</b> <b>for</b> <b>...</b> <b>[h]:</b>
           If you get EPG content from external  providers  it  is  possible,  that  something  fails  and  some
           recordings  are  skipped  because of the missing EPG. With this function one can check if EPG content
           exists for the next ... hours. With '0' the check is disabled.

       - "Warn by OSD:"
           Set this to 'Yes' to get warned via OSD.

       - "Warn by mail:"
           Set this to 'Yes' to get warned by email. Please configure the email account in 'email notification'

       - "Channel group to check:"
           select hier the channel group to check. Perhaps you have to create it before in 'channel groups'

       - <b>Ignore</b> <b>Pay-TV</b> <b>channels:</b>
           Set this to 'Yes' if you don't want to have events from Pay-TV channels when searching for a repeat.

       - <b>Search</b> <b>templates:</b>
           Here you can manage search templates which can be used when creating a search.

       - <b>Blacklists:</b>
           Here you can manage blacklists which can be used to suppress unwanted  events  within  a  search.   A
           blacklist  can  also  be  marked  as  global.  Since  the  default setting of a search timer for 'use
           blacklists' is 'only global', this is a simple way to exclude unwanted events form all search timers,
           except: If the search timer has the option 'use  blacklists:  none'  no  blacklists  are  taken  into
           account. Also the search for repeats within the OSD ignores any blacklists.

       - <b>Channel</b> <b>groups:</b>
           Here  you  can  setup  channel  groups  (e.g.  Sport  channels,  Pay-TV channels) that can be used as
           criterion in  searches. The same can be done in the search edit menu.

       <b>Important</b>: if you get your EPG from external sources make sure that search  timer  updates  are  disabled
       while  your  EPG  is  updated.  The  reason  for this is that epgsearch will remove timers without events
       assigned to them. This situation can exist while the new EPG is feeded to VDR. A simple  way  to  disable
       search timer updates is to use the SVDRP command SETS in your EPG update script:

       svdrpsend plug epgsearch SETS off

       &lt;your EPG update script&gt;

       svdrpsend plug epgsearch SETS on

       <u>1.4.6</u> <u>Timer</u> <u>conflict</u> <u>checking</u>

       - <b>Ignore</b> <b>below</b> <b>priority:</b>
           If  a  timer will fail with a priority below the given value, you won't get an OSD message about this
           and the conflict will be classified as 'not relevant' in the conflicts overview.

       - <b>Ignore</b> <b>conflict</b> <b>duration</b> <b>less</b> <b>...</b> <b>min.:</b>
           If a conflict will last only the given minutes it will not produce an OSD message  and  the  conflict
           will be classified as 'not relevant' in the conflicts overview.

       - <b>Only</b> <b>check</b> <b>within</b> <b>next</b> <b>...</b> <b>days:</b>
           Here you can specify the day range that should be used for the conflict check.

       - <b>Check</b> <b>also</b> <b>remote</b> <b>conflicts:</b>
           If  SVDRPPeering is active, conflicts for remote timers will be checked, if set to "yes". For this to
           work epgseach-plugin has to be active on the remote host too. Default is "no".

       - <b>After</b> <b>each</b> <b>timer</b> <b>programming:</b>
           This performs a conflict check after each manual timer programming and - if the new/modified timer is
           involved in a conflict - pops up an OSD message about it.

       - <b>"When</b> <b>a</b> <b>recording</b> <b>starts:</b>
           Set this to 'yes' if the conflict check should be performed when a recording starts.  In the case  of
           a conlfict you get immediately a message that informs you about it.  The message is only displayed if
           the conflict is within the next 2 hours.

       - <b>After</b> <b>each</b> <b>search</b> <b>timer</b> <b>update:</b>
           Specify here if you want to have a conflict check after each search timer update. If set to 'No':

       - <b>every</b> <b>...</b> <b>minutes:</b>
           performs  a  conflict  check in the background every ... minutes and informs about relevant conflicts
           via OSD. Set this to '0' to disable this feature.

       - <b>if</b> <b>conflicts</b> <b>within</b> <b>next</b> <b>...</b> <b>minutes:</b>
           - <b>every</b> <b>...</b> <b>minutes:</b>
               if you like to have a more frequent check and OSD notification when a conflict appears within the
               given time, use this feature.

       - <b>Avoid</b> <b>notification</b> <b>when</b> <b>replaying:</b>
           Set this to 'yes' if the don't want to get OSD messages  about  conflicts  if  you  currently  replay
           something. Nevertheless messages will be displayed if
            the first upcoming conflict is within the next 2 hours.

       Also have a look at <a href="../man4/epgsearch.4.html">epgsearch</a>(4), section 'Working with the timer conflict menu'.

       <u>1.4.7</u> <u>Email</u> <u>notification</u>

       Please   make   sure,   that   'sendEmail.pl'   is   in  the  path  of  your  executables  and  that  the
       'epgsearchupdmail.templ' and 'epgsearchconflmail.templ' exists in epgsearch's configurations directory!

       - <b>Search</b> <b>timer</b> <b>notification:</b>
           Enable this, if you want to get an email notification, when the search timer background thread has

             - created a new timer
             - modified an existing timer
             - deleted a timer, that was void because of EPG changes or other user
               actions.

           (Also requires 'Use search timers' in the search timer setup to be activated.)

       - <b>Time</b> <b>between</b> <b>mails</b> <b>[h]:</b>
           For search timer notifications one can set the minimum distance in hours between the mails.  As  soon
           as this time has elapsed a new mail is sent after the next search timer update.  A value of '0' means
           no delay and will cause immediate mail delivery.

       - <b>Timer</b> <b>conflict</b> <b>notification:</b>
           Enable  this,  if  you want to get an email notification about timer conflicts. The notification will
           only include 'relevant' conflicts as specified in the timer conflict  setup.  epgsearch  will  always
           send a new notification if there is any change in the current conflicts.

           (Also requires 'After each search timer update' or 'every ... minutes' in the conflict check setup to
           be activated.)

       - <b>Send</b> <b>to:</b>
           The mail address of the recipient. Note: Some providers (like Arcor) don't allow the same address for
           sender and recipient.

       - <b>Mail</b> <b>method:</b>
           You can choose between:

             - sendEmail.pl: this is a simply script shipped with epgsearch, that allows
               mail delivery also on systems without a configured mail server. Please
               copy it to your $PATH
             - sendmail: requires a properly configured mail system

       - <b>Email</b> <b>address:</b>
           Your full(!) email account address to be used for sending the mail.

       - <b>SMTP</b> <b>server:</b>
           The name of your SMTP server to be used for sending the mails.

       - <b>Use</b> <b>SMTP</b> <b>authentication:</b>
           Select 'yes' if your account needs authentication to send mails.

       - <b>AUTH</b> <b>user:</b>
           Specify the accounts username if your account needs authentication.

       - <b>AUTH</b> <b>password:</b>
           Specify  the  accounts password if your account needs authentication.  Note: The password is saved as
           plain text. You have to make sure on your own that your system is  safe  and  no  VDR  configurations
           files are visible to non authorized persons.

       After  the  account  setup,  check  if  it  works  with  'Test'. If you are using 'sendEmail.pl' for mail
       delivery, there should be something like 'Email sent successfully' at the end of  the  test  output.  The
       test function is not available for method 'sendmail'.

</pre><h4><b>2.</b> <b>Search</b> <b>timers</b></h4><pre>
       This  is  quite  the  same  as  VDRAdmin's auto-timers, but needs no external software. When you create a
       search, you can give it an option to use it as search timer. Now the plugin scans EPG entries in  certain
       update  intervals  (-&gt;setup)  in  the background and creates timers if there are matching entries. If you
       don't like to get a new timer, but only want to be informed  about  the  event  set  'Announce  only  (no
       timer)'  to yes.  Since these search timers are quite useful for serials, you can set the  option 'serial
       recording' in a search, which creates timers whose recordings are stored in a  folder  with  the  serials
       name and whose entries are named with the episode name. If there is no episode name, the plugin names the
       recording with a date/time string.

       To  use search timers, you also have to activate them in the plugins setup.  Also edit the SVDRP port, if
       you are not using the default 2001.

       If you want to trigger a background scan manually simply

       touch /etc/vdr/plugins/epgsearch/.epgsearchupdate

       This can also be part of your shutdown script. (Add here a sleep afterwards to give the plugin  the  time
       to finish the scan.)

       For  more  info  about searchtimers please refer to <a href="../man4/epgsearch.4.html">epgsearch</a>(4), 'Description of the search process' and
       'How do Search Timers work?'

   <b>2.1</b> <b>'Avoid</b> <b>repeats'</b> <b>-</b> <b>internals</b>
       This section explains the feature 'Avoid repeats' for a search timer.  Sometimes one cannot avoid  double
       recordings of an event only by setting the corresponding search criterions.

       Therefore  the  feature  'avoid  repeats'  tries  to check before creating a timer, if the same event was
       already recorded in the past or if there is a timer that records the same event. If so, there will be  no
       new timer for the event.

   <b>2.2</b> <b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>we</b> <b>compare</b> <b>two</b> <b>events?</b>
       To  check  if two events are the same there are many possible settings for a search timer. You can choose
       the title, subtitle, description or extended EPG categories within the description  of  an  event  to  be
       compared with the elements of another event.

       This  comparison  is  always  done case-sensitive and for the whole term. But the description of an event
       makes an exception of this.  First all text within the description will be truncated that looks  like  an
       extended  category entry, e.g. 'Rating: tip'. An extended category entry is a line of text beginning with
       max. 40 signs, followed by ':' and ending with max. 60 further signs.  The reason  for  this  cutting  is
       that  some  categories  like  the rating of an event are not part of the description of the repeat of the
       same event.

       The remaining text will now be compared by length. If the difference is bigger then 90%, then we rate the
       description of the two events as different. If not, we  apply  the  Levinsthein-Distance-Algorithm  (LD),
       which  makes  a  fuzzy text comparison. We accept the description of the events as equal, if LD returns a
       match of more then 90%.  Since LD is quite runtime intensive (<a href="../manmn/O.mn.html">O</a>(mn)),  you  should  not  choose  'compare
       description' as the only comparison criterion, but combine it always with other criterions.

   <b>2.3</b> <b>How</b> <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>do</b> <b>we</b> <b>compare?</b>
       As  already  mentioned  each search timer update checks search timers with this feature for recordings in
       the past or an already existing timer for the same event.

       To remember past recordings epgsearch stores their info in the file epgsearchdone.data. You  can  have  a
       look  at  the contents of this file calling 'show recordings done' in the 'actions' of the searches menu.
       This file only stores info about recordings that are complete, i.e. that  started  and  stopped  just  in
       time.  So  a  broken  recording  will  not be stored in this file and epgsearch will automatically try to
       record the next repeat, if there is any. Starting with vdr 2.5.x also  recordings  with  errors  are  not
       stored.  If  you  would  like  to  allow  a  certain amount of errors, you can raise the value of "Allowd
       Errors".

       <b>How</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>it?</b>

       As you see, the whole feature depends on the quality of the EPG.  After creating such a search timer, you
       should first check if it does what is intended. Therefore the menu of search results  has  an  additional
       mode  for  the  key  'blue'  named  'Timer  preview'. Here you can see, what timers the next update would
       create. Existing timers are labeled with 'T', future timers with 'P'.

       Hint: If the programming results in a conflict simply disable the conflicting timer in the  timers  menu.
       The next search timer update, will try to program a different timer for the same event, if it exists.

       <b>When</b> <b>it</b> <b>works</b> <b>not</b> <b>correctly</b> <b>:-)</b>

       To get a better control of the programming or not-programming of the timers when using this feature a log
       file was introduced. When starting epgsearch with the command line option '-v n' where n is the log level
       than  you  get  additional  info  in the file epgsearch.log. Available log levels are 0 (no logging) to 3
       (extended logging). See also the manual for the command line options.

</pre><h4><b>3.</b> <b>Usage</b> <b>from</b> <b>other</b> <b>plugins</b> <b>or</b> <b>scripts</b></h4><pre>
       See <a href="../man4/epgsearch.4.html">epgsearch</a>(4).

</pre><h4><b>4.</b> <b>Using</b> <b>extended</b> <b>EPG</b> <b>info</b></h4><pre>
       Some EPG providers deliver additional EPG information like the type of event, the video and audio format,
       cast,... in the content summary.

       Note: This is different from the content descriptors introduced in  vdr-1.7.11,  that  are  delivered  as
       extra  data  with  a common standard. Unfortunately not all providers deliver this data, or the set wrong
       descriptors. So you can use the approach of 'extended EPG info' here, which is a way to extract that info
       from the content summary.

       Using tvm2vdr or epg4vdr you can import this into vdr.  To use this information with  search  timers  one
       has to configure it with the file epgsearchcats.conf in the epgsearch config directory. The format of the
       file is as follows:

        ID|category name|name in menu|values separated by ','(option)|search mode(option)

        - 'ID' should be a unique positive integer
           (changing the id later on will force you to re-edit your search timers!)
        - 'category name' is the name as delivered by the EPG provider, e.g. 'Genre'
        - 'name in menu' is the name displayed in epgsearch.
        - 'values' is an optional list of possible values
        - 'search mode' specifies the search mode:
          text comparison:
          0 - the whole term must appear as substring
          1 - all single terms (delimiters are ',', ';', '|' or '~')
              must exist as substrings. This is the default search mode.
          2 - at least one term (delimiters are ',', ';', '|' or '~')
              must exist as substring.
          3 - matches exactly
          4 - regular expression
          numerical comparison:
          10 - less
          11 - less or equal
          12 - greater
          13 - greater or equal
          14 - equal
          15 - not equal

       Sample files for epgsearchcats.conf are delivered with the plugin in the directory 'conf'.

       Simply   copy   the   one   that   fits  for  you  to  the  epgsearch  configuration  directory  filename
       epgsearchcats.conf and then have a look to the search timers edit menu (after a restart of VDR).

       Since setting up a new epgsearchcats.conf is a lot of work, I've added a small  tool  'createcats',  that
       makes the biggest part of the job. It should have been compiled with the plugin and exists in the sources
       directory.

       See <a href="../man1/createcats.1.html">createcats</a>(1) for information about how to use it.

       Internals:  epgsearch  scans  the  summary  of  an  event  for the category name followed by ': ' for all
       categories that have a corresponding value set  in  the  search  timer.  The  search  is  case  sensitive
       regarding the category name as also the value.

</pre><h4><b>5.</b> <b>Replacing</b> <b>the</b> <b>standard</b> <b>schedule</b> <b>menu</b></h4><pre>
       To use this plugin as a replacement for the default green key, simply put the line

        Green   @epgsearch

       in your keymacros.conf. If you don't like to get another plugin entry in your main menu, first hide it by
       setup. Then you could use my launcher-plugin and put the line

        Green @launcher x

       in your keymacros.conf, where x is the position of the Epgsearch plugin within launchers menu listing.

       Another  approach  is  using  a  patch  to  VDR that replaces vdr's standard schedule menu with epgsearch
       (vdr-replace-schedulemenu.diff.gz in the patches subdir, thanks to the author  Uwe/egal@vdrportal).  When
       using this patch the entry should look like

        Green Schedule

       This patch is already included in some patch collections, like the Bigpatch.

</pre><h4><b>6.</b> <b>Add-ons</b></h4><pre>
       epgsearch  delivers  2 'mini'-plugins. Both require an installed epgsearch (but epgsearch can be hided in
       the main menu):

       - <b>epgsearchonly:</b>
           For those who only want to use the search feature and/or search timers  or  simply  want  to  have  a
           separate main menu entry for the search feature. This plugin creates a main menu entry 'Search' which
           calls epgsearch search menu.  Activation in VDR start script with "-Pepgsearchonly".

       - <b>conflictcheckonly:</b>
           The  timer  conflict  check  can  also have its own main menu entry which displays epgsearch conflict
           overview menu. It has a setup option to display an information about the last check directly  in  its
           main menu entry.  Activation in VDR start script with "-Pconflictcheckonly".

       Have fun!
