</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       foot - Wayland terminal emulator

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>foot</b> [<u>OPTIONS</u>]
       <b>foot</b> [<u>OPTIONS</u>] &lt;<u>command</u>&gt; [<u>COMMAND</u> <u>OPTIONS</u>]

       All  trailing  (non-option) arguments are treated as a command, and its arguments, to execute (instead of
       the default shell).

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>foot</b> is a Wayland terminal emulator. Running it without arguments will start a new terminal  window  with
       your default shell.

       You can override the default shell by appending a custom command to the foot command line

           <b>foot</b> <b>htop</b>

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-c</b>,<b>--config</b>=<u>PATH</u>
           Path to configuration file, see <b><a href="../man5/foot.ini.5.html">foot.ini</a></b>(5) for details.

       <b>-C</b>,<b>--check-config</b>
           Verify configuration and then exit with 0 if ok, otherwise exit with 230 (see <b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b>).

       <b>-o</b>,<b>--override</b>=[<u>SECTION</u>.]<u>KEY</u>=<u>VALUE</u>
           Override an option set in the configuration file. If <u>SECTION</u> is not given, defaults to <u>main</u>.

       <b>-f</b>,<b>--font</b>=<u>FONT</u>
           Comma separated list of fonts to use, in fontconfig format (see <b>FONT</b> <b>FORMAT</b>).

           The first font is the primary font. The remaining fonts are fallback fonts that will be used whenever
           a glyph cannot be found in the primary font.

           The  fallback  fonts  are searched in the order they appear. If a glyph cannot be found in any of the
           fallback fonts, the dynamic fallback list from fontconfig (for the primary font) is searched.

           Default: <u>monospace</u>.

       <b>-w</b>,<b>--window-size-pixels</b>=<u>WIDTHxHEIGHT</u>
           Set initial window width and height, in pixels. Default: <u>700x500</u>.

       <b>-W</b>,<b>--window-size-chars</b>=<u>WIDTHxHEIGHT</u>
           Set initial window width and height, in characters. Default: <u>not</u> <u>set</u>.

       <b>-t</b>,<b>--term</b>=<u>TERM</u>
           Value to set the environment variable <b>TERM</b> to (see <b>TERMINFO</b> and <b>ENVIRONMENT</b>). Default: <u>foot</u>.

       <b>-T</b>,<b>--title</b>=<u>TITLE</u>
           Initial window title. Default: <u>foot</u>.

       <b>-a</b>,<b>--app-id</b>=<u>ID</u>
           Value to set the <b>app-id</b> property on the Wayland window to. Default: <u>foot</u> (normal mode), or <u>footclient</u>
           (server mode).

       <b>-m</b>,<b>--maximized</b>
           Start in maximized mode. If both <b>--maximized</b> and <b>--fullscreen</b>  are  specified,  the  <u>last</u>  one  takes
           precedence.

       <b>-F</b>,<b>--fullscreen</b>
           Start  in  fullscreen  mode.  If  both <b>--maximized</b> and <b>--fullscreen</b> are specified, the <u>last</u> one takes
           precedence.

       <b>-L</b>,<b>--login-shell</b>
           Start a login shell, by prepending a '-' to argv[0].

       <b>--pty</b>
           Display an existing pty instead of creating one. This is useful for interacting with VM consoles.

           This option is not currently supported in combination with <b>-s</b>,<b>--server</b>.

       <b>-D</b>,<b>--working-directory</b>=<u>DIR</u>
           Initial working directory for the client application. Default: <u>CWD</u> <u>of</u> <u>foot</u>.

       <b>-s</b>,<b>--server</b>[=<u>PATH</u>|<u>FD</u>]
           Run as a server. In this mode, a  single  foot  instance  hosts  multiple  terminals  (windows).  Use
           <b><a href="../man1/footclient.1.html">footclient</a></b>(1) to launch new terminals.

           This saves some memory since for example fonts and glyph caches can be shared between the terminals.

           It also saves upstart time since the config has already been loaded and parsed, and most importantly,
           fonts have already been loaded (and their glyph caches are likely to already have been populated).

           Each  terminal  will  have  its  own  rendering  threads,  but  all Wayland communication, as well as
           input/output to the shell, is multiplexed in the  main  thread.  Thus,  this  mode  might  result  in
           slightly worse performance when multiple terminals are under heavy load.

           Also be aware that should one terminal crash, it will take all the others with it.

           The default path is <b>$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/foot-$WAYLAND_DISPLAY.sock</b>.

           If <b>$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR</b> is not set, the default path is instead <b>/tmp/foot.sock</b>.

           If    <b>$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR</b>    is    set,   but   <b>$WAYLAND_DISPLAY</b>   is   not,   the   default   path   is
           <b>$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/foot.sock</b>.

           Note that if you change the default, you  will  also  need  to  use  the  <b>--server-socket</b>  option  in
           <b><a href="../man1/footclient.1.html">footclient</a></b>(1) and point it to your custom socket path.

           If  the argument is a number, foot will interpret it as the file descriptor of a socket provided by a
           supervision daemon (such as systemd or s6), and use that socket as it's own.

           Two systemd units (foot-server.{service,socket}) are provided to use that feature  with  systemd.  To
           use socket activation, only enable the socket unit.

           Note  that  starting  <b>foot</b> <b>--server</b> as a systemd service will use the environment of the systemd user
           instance; thus, you'll  need  to  import  <b>$WAYLAND_DISPLAY</b>  in  it  using  <b>systemctl</b>  <b>--user</b>  <b>import-</b>
           <b>environment</b> <b>WAYLAND_DISPLAY</b>.

       <b>-H</b>,<b>--hold</b>
           Remain open after child process exits.

       <b>-p</b>,<b>--print-pid</b>=<u>FILE</u>|<u>FD</u>
           Print  PID  to  this  file,  or FD, when successfully started. The file (or FD) is closed immediately
           after writing the PID. When a <u>FILE</u> as been specified, the file is unlinked at exit.

           This option can only be used in combination with <b>-s</b>,<b>--server</b>.

       <b>-d</b>,<b>--log-level</b>={<b>info</b>,<b>warning</b>,<b>error</b>,<b>none</b>}
           Log level, used both for log output on stderr as well as syslog. Default: <u>warning</u>.

       <b>-l</b>,<b>--log-colorize</b>=[{<b>never</b>,<b>always</b>,<b>auto</b>}]
           Enables or disables colorization of log output on stderr. Default: <u>auto</u>.

       <b>-S</b>,<b>--log-no-syslog</b>
           Disables syslog logging. Logging is only done on stderr. This option can only be used in  combination
           with <b>-s</b>,<b>--server</b>.

       <b>-v</b>,<b>--version</b>
           Show the version number and quit.

       <b>-e</b>
           Ignored; for compatibility with <b>xterm</b> <b>-e</b>.

           This  option  was  added  in response to several program launchers passing <b>-e</b> to arbitrary terminals,
           under the assumption that they all implement the same semantics  for  it  as  <b><a href="../man1/xterm.1.html">xterm</a></b>(1).  Ignoring  it
           allows  foot  to  be invoked as e.g. <b>foot</b> <b>-e</b> <b>man</b> <b>foot</b> with the same results as with xterm, instead of
           producing an "invalid option" error.

</pre><h4><b>KEYBOARD</b> <b>SHORTCUTS</b></h4><pre>
       The following keyboard shortcuts are available by default. They can be changed in <b><a href="../man5/foot.ini.5.html">foot.ini</a></b>(5). There  are
       also more actions (disabled by default) available; see <b><a href="../man5/foot.ini.5.html">foot.ini</a></b>(5).

   <b>SCROLLBACK</b> <b>SEARCH</b>
       These keyboard shortcuts affect the search selection:

       <b>ctrl</b>+<b>r</b>
           Search <u>backward</u> for the next match. If the search string is empty, the last  searched-for  string  is
           used.

       <b>ctrl</b>+<b>s</b>

       <b>escape</b>, <b>ctrl</b>+<b>g</b>, <b>ctrl</b>+<b>c</b>
           Cancel the search

       <b>return</b>
           Finish  the  search  and  copy  the current match to the primary selection. The terminal selection is
           kept, allowing you to press <b>ctrl</b>+<b>shift</b>+<b>c</b> to copy it to the clipboard.

       These shortcuts affect the search box in scrollback-search mode:

       <b>ctrl</b>+<b>b</b>
           Moves the cursor in the search box one character to the left.

       <b>ctrl</b>+<b>left</b>, <b>alt</b>+<b>b</b>
           Moves the cursor in the search box one word to the left.

       <b>ctrl</b>+<b>f</b>
           Moves the cursor in the search box one character to the right.

       <b>ctrl</b>+<b>right</b>, <b>alt</b>+<b>f</b>

       <b>shift</b>+<b>page-down</b>
           Scroll down/forward one page in history.

   <b>URL</b> <b>MODE</b>
       <b>t</b>
           Toggle URL visibility in jump label.

       <b>escape</b>, <b>ctrl</b>+<b>g</b>, <b>ctrl</b>+<b>c</b>, <b>ctrl</b>+<b>d</b>
           Exit URL mode without launching a URL.

   <b>MOUSE</b> <b>SHORTCUTS</b>
       <b>left</b>, single-click
           Drag to select; when released, the selected text is copied to the <u>primary</u> selection. This feature  is
           normally <b>disabled</b> whenever the client has enabled <u>mouse</u> <u>tracking</u>, but can be forced by holding <b>shift</b>.

           Holding <b>ctrl</b> will create a block selection.

       <b>left</b>, double-click
           Selects  the  <u>word</u> (separated by spaces, period, comma, parenthesis etc) under the pointer. Hold <b>ctrl</b>
           to select everything under the pointer up to, and until, the next space characters.

       <b>left</b>, triple-click
           Selects the everything between enclosing quotes, or the entire row if not inside a quote.

       <b>left</b>, quad-click
           Selects the entire row

       <b>middle</b>
           Paste from the <u>primary</u> selection

       <b>right</b>
           Extend current selection. Clicking immediately extends the selection, while hold-and-drag allows  you
           to interactively resize the selection.

       <b>ctrl</b>+<b>right</b>
           Extend  the  current  selection,  but  force  it  to  be character wise, rather than depending on the
           original selection mode.

       <b>wheel</b>
           Scroll up/down in history

       <b>ctrl</b>+<b>wheel</b>
           Increase/decrease font size

   <b>TOUCHSCREEN</b>
       <b>tap</b>
           Emulates mouse left button click.

       <b>drag</b>
           Scrolls up/down in history.

           Holding for a while before dragging (time delay can be configured) emulates mouse dragging with  left
           button held.

</pre><h4><b>FONT</b> <b>FORMAT</b></h4><pre>
       The  font  is  specified  in  FontConfig  syntax.  That  is, a colon-separated list of font name and font
       options.

       <u>Examples</u>:
       •   Dina:weight=bold:slant=italic
       •   Courier New:size=12

</pre><h4><b>URLs</b></h4><pre>
       Foot supports URL detection. But, unlike many other terminal emulators, where URLs are  highlighted  when
       they are hovered and opened by clicking on them, foot uses a keyboard driven approach.

       Pressing  <b>ctrl</b>+<b>shift</b>+<b>o</b>  enters  <u>"Open</u>  <u>URL</u> <u>mode"</u>, where all currently visible URLs are underlined, and is
       associated with a <u>"jump-label"</u>. The jump-label indicates the <u>key</u> <u>sequence</u> (e.g. <b>"AF"</b>) to use to  activate
       the URL.

       The  key binding can, of course, be customized, like all other key bindings in foot. See <b>show-urls-launch</b>
       and <b>show-urls-copy</b> in <b><a href="../man5/foot.ini.5.html">foot.ini</a></b>(5).

       <b>show-urls-launch</b> by default opens the URL with <b>xdg-open</b>. This can be changed with the <b>url-launch</b> option.

       <b>show-urls-copy</b> is an alternative to <b>show-urls-launch</b>, that changes what activating a URL <u>does</u>; instead of
       opening it, it copies it to the clipboard. It is unbound by default.

       Jump label colors, the URL underline color, and the letters used in the jump label key sequences  can  be
       configured.

</pre><h4><b>ALT/META</b> <b>CHARACTERS</b></h4><pre>
       By  default,  foot  prefixes meta characters with <b>ESC</b>. This corresponds to XTerm's <b>metaSendsEscape</b> option
       set to <b>true</b>.

       This can be disabled programmatically with <b>E[?1036l</b> (and enabled again with <b>E[?1036h</b>).

       When disabled, foot will instead set the 8:th bit of meta  character  and  then  UTF-8  encode  it.  This
       corresponds to XTerm's <b>eightBitMeta</b> option set to <b>true</b>.

       This  can  also be disabled programmatically with <b>rmm</b> (Reset Meta Mode, <b>E[?1034l</b>), and enabled again with
       <b>smm</b> (Set Meta Mode, <b>E[?1034h</b>).

</pre><h4><b>BACKSPACE</b></h4><pre>
       Foot transmits DEL (<b>^?</b>) on backspace. This corresponds to XTerm's <b>backarrowKey</b> option set to  <b>false</b>,  and
       to DECBKM being <u>reset</u>.

       To instead transmit BS (<b>^H</b>), press <b>ctrl</b>+<b>backspace</b>.

       Note that foot does <b>not</b> implement DECBKM, and that the behavior described above <b>cannot</b> be changed.

       Finally, pressing <b>alt</b> will prefix the transmitted byte with ESC.

</pre><h4><b>KEYPAD</b></h4><pre>
       By  default, <b>Num</b> <b>Lock</b> overrides the run-time configuration keypad mode; when active, the keypad is always
       considered to be in <u>numerical</u> mode. This corresponds to XTerm's <b>numLock</b> option set to <b>true</b>.

       In this mode, the keypad keys always sends either numbers (Num Lock is active) or  cursor  movement  keys
       (up, down, left, right, page up, page down etc).

       This can be disabled programmatically with <b>E[?1035l</b> (and enabled again with <b>E[?1035h</b>).

       When disabled, the keypad sends custom escape sequences instead of numbers, when in <u>application</u> mode.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       foot will search for a configuration file in the following locations, in this order:

           •   <b>XDG_CONFIG_HOME/foot/foot.ini</b> (defaulting to <b>$HOME/.config/foot/foot.ini</b> if unset)
           •   <b>XDG_CONFIG_DIRS/foot/foot.ini</b> (defaulting to <b>/etc/xdg/foot/foot.ini</b> if unset)

       An  example configuration file containing all options with their default value commented out will usually
       be installed to <b>/etc/xdg/foot/foot.ini</b>.

       For more information, see <b><a href="../man5/foot.ini.5.html">foot.ini</a></b>(5).

</pre><h4><b>SHELL</b> <b>INTEGRATION</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Current</b> <b>working</b> <b>directory</b>
       New foot terminal instances (bound  to  <b>ctrl</b>+<b>shift</b>+<b>n</b>  by  default)  will  open  in  the  current  working
       directory, if the shell in the "parent" terminal reports directory changes.

       This  is  done  with  the  OSC-7  escape sequence. Most shells can be scripted to do this, if they do not
       support  it  natively.  See  the   wiki   (https://codeberg.org/dnkl/foot/wiki#user-content-spawning-new-
       terminal-instances-in-the-current-working-directory) for details.

   <b>Jumping</b> <b>between</b> <b>prompts</b>
       Foot can move the current viewport to focus prompts of already executed commands (bound to <b>ctrl</b>+<b>shift</b>+<b>z</b>/<b>x</b>
       by default).

       For this to work, the shell needs to emit an OSC-133;A (<b>\E]133;A\E\\</b>) sequence before each prompt.

       In zsh, one way to do this is to add a <u>precmd</u> hook:

           <b>precmd()</b> <b>{</b>
               <b>print</b> <b>-Pn</b> <b>"\e]133;A\e\\"</b>
           <b>}</b>

       See  the wiki (https://codeberg.org/dnkl/foot/wiki#user-content-jumping-between-prompts) for details, and
       examples for other shells.

   <b>Piping</b> <b>last</b> <b>command's</b> <b>output</b>
       The key binding <b>pipe-command-output</b> can pipe the last command's output to an application of  your  choice
       (similar to the other <b>pipe-*</b> key bindings):

           <b>[key-bindings]</b>
           <b>pipe-command-output=[sh</b>  <b>-c</b>  <b>"f=$(mktemp);</b>  <b>cat</b>  <b>-</b>  <b>&gt;</b>  <b>$f;</b>  <b>footclient</b>  <b>emacsclient</b>  <b>-nw</b>  <b>$f;</b> <b>rm</b> <b>$f"]</b>
           <b>Control+Shift+g</b>

       When pressing <b>ctrl</b>+<b>shift</b>+<b>g</b>, the last command's output is written to a temporary file, then an emacsclient
       is started in a new footclient instance. The temporary file is removed after the footclient instance  has
       closed.

       For  this to work, the shell must emit an OSC-133;C (<b>\E]133;C\E\\</b>) sequence before command output starts,
       and an OSC-133;D (<b>\E]133;D\E\\</b>) when the command output ends.

       In fish, one way to do this is to add <u>preexec</u> and <u>postexec</u> hooks:

</pre><h4><b>TERMINFO</b></h4><pre>
       Client  applications use the terminfo identifier specified by the environment variable <b>TERM</b> (set by foot)
       to determine terminal capabilities.

       Foot has two terminfo definitions: <b>foot</b> and <b>foot-direct</b>, with <b>foot</b> being the default.

       The difference between the two is in the number of colors they describe; <b>foot</b> describes  256  colors  and
       <b>foot-direct</b> 16.7 million colors (24-bit truecolor).

       Note  that  using  the  <b>foot</b> terminfo does not limit the number of usable colors to 256; applications can
       still use 24-bit RGB colors. In fact, most applications work best with <b>foot</b>  (including  24-bit  colors).
       Using <b>*-direct</b> terminfo entries has been known to crash some ncurses applications even.

       There  are however applications that need a <b>*-direct</b> terminfo entry for 24-bit support. Emacs is one such
       example.

       While using either <b>foot</b> or <b>foot-direct</b> is strongly recommended, it is possible to use e.g. <b>xterm-256color</b>
       as well. This can be useful when remoting to a system where foot's  terminfo  entries  cannot  easily  be
       installed.

       Note  that  terminfo  entries can be installed in the user's home directory. I.e. if you do not have root
       access, or if there is no distro package for foot's terminfo entries, you  can  install  foot's  terminfo
       entries manually, by copying <b>foot</b> and <b>foot-direct</b> to <b><a href="file:~/.terminfo/f/">~/.terminfo/f/</a></b>.

</pre><h4><b>XTGETTCAP</b></h4><pre>
       <b>XTGETTCAP</b>  is  an  escape  sequence initially introduced by XTerm, and also implemented (and extended, to
       some degree) by Kitty.

       It allows querying the terminal for terminfo classic, file-based, terminfo definition.  For  example,  if
       all  applications  used this feature, you would no longer have to install foot's terminfo on remote hosts
       you SSH into.

       XTerm's implementation (as of XTerm-370) only supports querying key (as in keyboard  keys)  capabilities,
       and three custom capabilities:

       •   TN - terminal name
       •   Co -  number of colors (alias for the colors capability)
       •   RGB  -  number  of  bits per color channel (different semantics from the RGB capability in file-based
           terminfo definitions!).

       Kitty has extended this, and also supports querying all integer and string capabilities.

       Foot supports this, and extends it even further, to also include boolean capabilities. This means  foot's
       entire terminfo can be queried via <b>XTGETTCAP</b>.

       Note  that  both  Kitty  and  foot  handles  responses  to multi-capability queries slightly differently,
       compared to XTerm.

       XTerm will send a single DCS reply, with ;-separated capability/value pairs. There are a couple of issues
       with this:

       •   The success/fail flag in the beginning of the response is always 1 (success), unless the  very  first
           queried capability is invalid.
       •   XTerm  will  not  respond at all to an invalid capability, unless it's the first one in the XTGETTCAP
           query.
       •   XTerm will end the response at the first invalid capability.

       In other words, if you send a large multi-capability query, you will only get responses up  to,  but  not
       including, the first invalid capability. All subsequent capabilities will be dropped.

       Kitty  and  foot  on  the  other hand, send one DCS response for each capability in the multi query. This
       allows us to send a proper success/fail flag for each  queried  capability.  Responses  for  all  queried
       capabilities are always sent. No queries are ever dropped.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       Foot will exit with code 230 if there is a failure in foot itself.

       In all other cases, the exit code is that of the client application (i.e. the shell).

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Variables</b> <b>used</b> <b>by</b> <b>foot</b>
       <b>SHELL</b>
           The  default  child  process  to  run,  when no <u>command</u> argument is specified and the <b>shell</b> option in
           <b><a href="../man5/foot.ini.5.html">foot.ini</a></b>(5) is not set.

       <b>HOME</b>
           Used to determine the location of the configuration file, see <b><a href="../man5/foot.ini.5.html">foot.ini</a></b>(5) for details.

       <b>XDG_CONFIG_HOME</b>
           Used to determine the location of the configuration file, see <b><a href="../man5/foot.ini.5.html">foot.ini</a></b>(5) for details.

       <b>XDG_CONFIG_DIRS</b>

       <b>XDG_RUNTIME_DIR</b>
           Used to construct the default <u>PATH</u> for the <b>--server</b> option, when no explicit argument is  given  (see
           above).

       <b>WAYLAND_DISPLAY</b>
           Used  to  construct the default <u>PATH</u> for the <b>--server</b> option, when no explicit argument is given (see
           above).

       <b>XCURSOR_THEME</b>
           The name of the <b><a href="../man3/Xcursor.3.html">Xcursor</a></b>(3) theme to use for pointers (typically set by the Wayland compositor).

       <b>XCURSOR_SIZE</b>
           The size to use for <b><a href="../man3/Xcursor.3.html">Xcursor</a></b>(3) pointers (typically set by the Wayland compositor).

   <b>Variables</b> <b>set</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>process</b>
       <b>TERM</b>
           terminfo/termcap identifier. This is used by client applications to determine  which  capabilities  a
           terminal  supports.  The  value is set according to either the <b>--term</b> command-line option or the <b>term</b>
           config option in <b><a href="../man5/foot.ini.5.html">foot.ini</a></b>(5).

       <b>COLORTERM</b>
           This variable is set to <b>truecolor</b>, to indicate to client applications  that  24-bit  RGB  colors  are
           supported.

       <b>PWD</b>
           Current working directory (at the time of launching foot)

       <b>SHELL</b>
           Set to the launched shell, if the shell is valid (it is listed in <b><a href="file:/etc/shells">/etc/shells</a></b>).

       In addition to the variables listed above, custom environment variables may be defined in <b><a href="../man5/foot.ini.5.html">foot.ini</a></b>(5).

   <b>Variables</b> <b>*unset*</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>process</b>
       <b>TERM_PROGRAM</b> <b>TERM_PROGRAM_VERSION</b>
           These  environment  variables  are set by certain other terminal emulators. We unset them, to prevent
           applications from misdetecting foot.

       In addition to the variables listed above, custom environment  variables  to  unset  may  be  defined  in
       <b><a href="../man5/foot.ini.5.html">foot.ini</a></b>(5).
