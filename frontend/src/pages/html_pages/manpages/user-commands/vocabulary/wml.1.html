       <b>wml</b> [<b>-V</b> [<u>NUM</u>]] [<b>-h</b>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This is the control program of the <u>Website</u> <u>META</u> <u>Language</u> (WML), a free HTML generation toolkit for Unix,
       internally consisting of 9 independent languages.

       The main idea of WML is a sequential filtering scheme where each language provides one of 9 processing
       passes.  So <u>wml</u> reads <u>inputfile</u> (or from <u>stdin</u> if <u>inputfile</u> is a dash or completely missing), applies
       passes 1-9 (or only the passes specified by <b>-p</b>) and finally produces one or more <u>outputfile</u>s.

       For more details on this processing scheme read the <u>WML</u> <u>Introduction</u> under <b><a href="../man7/wml_intro.7.html">wml_intro</a></b>(7) and the <u>WML</u>
       <u>Tutorial</u> under <b><a href="../man7/wml_tutorial.7.html">wml_tutorial</a></b>(7).

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-I</b>, <b>--include=</b><u>PATH</u>
           Adds  a  <u>directory</u>  to the list of user include paths. Use this option to set the runtime environment
           for pass 1. See <b><a href="../man1/wml_p1_ipp.1.html">wml_p1_ipp</a></b>(1) for more details.

       <b>-i</b>, <b>--includefile=</b><u>PATH</u>
           Pre-loads a particular include <u>file</u>, i.e. virtually adds a

             #include "PATH"

           at the top of <u>inputfile</u>. Use this to automatically include default user include files. If you want to
           include a systems include file you have to surround the <u>PATH</u> with angle brackets,  for  instance  use
           ``"-i" "&lt;foo/bar.wml&gt;"'' to include the file <u>foo/bar.wml</u> from the system include area.  Alternatively
           you can use the special syntax ``"wml::foo::bar"'' as with the "#use" directive.

       <b>-D</b>, <b>--define=</b><u>NAME</u><b>=</b><u>STR</u>
           Defines  a  variable  which  can  be interpolated in pass 1 (IPP) via "$(NAME)", in pass 2 (mp4h) via
           &lt;"get-var NAME"&gt;, in pass 3 (ePerl) via "&lt;:=$NAME:&gt;" and in pass 4 (GNU m4) via "m4_NAME".  A special
           variant <b>--define=</b><u>NAME</u><b>=UNDEF</b> does  the  opposite,  it  deletes  previous  definitions  (which  may  be
           different than undefining these variables, e.g. with system defined variables).

       <b>-D</b>, <b>--define=</b><u>NAME</u><b>~</b><u>PATH</u>
           Similar to the above but defines a variable holding a pathname which is autoadjusted (see below).  It
           can be interpolated in the same ways as the "NAME=STR" variant from above.

       <b>-n</b>, <b>--noshebang</b>
           This  forces  WML  to ignore a possibly contained shebang line in <u>inputfile</u>.  This is usually used by
           WMk, because WMk already parsed this line and supplied the options to WML.

       <b>-r</b>, <b>--norcfile</b>
           This forces WML to ignore all <u>.wmlrc</u> files.

       <b>-c</b>, <b>--nocd</b>
           When WML processes an input file from another directory, it jumps into that directory before  parsing
           <u>.wmlrc</u>  files,  and jump back to current directory after.  If this option is set, no directory change
           is made and <u>.wmlrc</u> files are read reative to current working directory.

       <b>-O</b>, <b>--optimize=</b><u>NUM</u>
           This is the optimization option which is passed directly to pass 8 (<u>htmlfix</u>). It controls the  amount
           of optimization/stripping which is applied to the generated HTML markup code.

       <b>-o</b>, <b>--outputfile=</b><u>SLICETERM</u><b>:</b><u>outputfile</u>[<b>@</b><u>CHMODOPT</u>]
           This redirects the output to a file. Usually the whole file will be send to <u>stdout</u> (same as "ALL:-").
           You can use this option more than once to output to more than one file while using the <u>SLICETERM</u> as a
           set  theory  term  of slices to determine which contents will be included into each particular output
           file.  The optional <u>CHMODOPT</u> is intended for specifying options for a finally applied <u>chmod</u>  command.
           For  instance  use ``"u+x"'' to create a file with the execution bit set (Apache's XBitHack feature).
           See <b><a href="../man1/slice.1.html">slice</a></b>(1) for more details.

       <b>-P</b>, <b>--prolog=</b><u>PATH</u>
           Runs an prolog filter over the input file.  This program receives the data to act on as STDIN and has
           to produce the filtered data on STDOUT.

       <b>-E</b>, <b>--epilog=</b><u>PATH</u>
           Runs an epilogue program over the finally resulting  output  files.   Currently  the  following  WML-
           specific  programs  are known: <u>htmlinfo</u>, <u>linklint</u>, <u>tidy</u> and <u>weblint</u>.  But you can specify any program
           which is available in your "PATH". This program receives the file to act on as its first command line
           argument. Notice that output is not redirected to this file, so you have to use a wrapper or  program
           specific flags if you want to modify output files.

       <b>-t</b>, <b>--settime</b>
           This  sets  the  modification  time of all output files to the modification time of <u>intputfile</u> plus 1
           second. This is useful because Webservers will generate "Last-Modified" headers and there the editing
           time is more important than the generation time. The 1 second  offset  is  for  the  dependencies  of
           Makefiles.

       <b>-M</b>, <b>--depend</b>[<b>=</b><u>OPTIONS</u>]
           Output  a rule suitable for `make' describing the dependencies of each output file, as `gcc' does. It
           has only sense when the <b>-o</b> option is used.  No processing is done except for the first pass.

           The <b>D</b> flag option writes the rule to a dependency  file.  The  name  of  this  file  is  obtained  by
           replacing the suffix of the output file by ".d".

           The <b>M</b> flag option deletes the system files from the list of dependencies.

       <b>-p</b>, <b>--pass=</b><u>STR</u>
           Specifies which of the passes described above are actually applied under runtime. The argument <u>STR</u> is
           a  comma-separated  list  of  pass  numbers with one special case: You can write "X-Y" for all passes
           "X...Y".  When pass 9 is not part of <u>STR</u> the resulting output is written to <u>STDOUT</u>.  Default  is  the
           string ``"1-9"''.

       <b>-W</b>, <b>--passoption=</b><u>NUM</u>,<u>STR</u>
           Set option <u>STR</u> for the pass <u>NUM</u>.

       <b>-s</b>, <b>--safe</b>
           This  disables  some  Perl hacks inside WML which speedup processing by reducing the forking overhead
           when running the various passes.

           Without this option WML pre-compiles the passes  1,5,6,7,8  (which  are  written  in  Perl!)  into  a
           different  namespace of the currently running Perl interpreter instead of running them externally via
           "system()". The effect is that these programs are run from within  the  same  Perl  interpreter  thus
           saving  five  CPU-  and  time-intensive  "fork()"'s.  The  actual  gain is between 2 and 4 seconds of
           processing time. Although experience showed that it works great, the theoretical  problem  still  is,
           that this approach is somewhat risky due to internal Perl variable conflicts.

           Use this option to disable these speedups by forcing WML to use the safe "fork()" approach.

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b>[<b>=</b><u>NUM</u>]
           This  sets verbose mode (from 1 to 9) where some processing information will be given on the console.
           Useful for debugging. This option also gets passed to some of the filtering programs. Default  is  no
           verbosity and just <b>-v</b> means <b>-v1</b>.

       <b>-q</b>, <b>--quiet</b>
           This  sets quiet mode where the processing prop is no longer displayed.  Use this option when running
           <u>wml</u> as a batch job.  This option is  automatically  forced  when  <u>inputfile</u>  is  missing.   Then  WML
           automatically reads from <u>stdin</u> in quiet mode.

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--version</b>[<b>=</b><u>NUM</u>]
           Gives  the  version  identification  string  and  disclaimer  (no  <u>NUM</u>  or  <u>NUM</u>  &gt;= 1), the WML build
           information (<u>NUM</u> &gt;= 2) and the Perl build information (<u>NUM</u> &gt;= 3). Use this  option  to  get  a  brief
           description of your installed WML system, especially when reporting bugs to the author.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
           Prints the usage summary page.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
   <b>DEFINED</b> <b>VARIABLES</b>
       The  following  variables  are  always  defined  by  <u>wml</u>  under  runtime and are usually interpolated via
       &lt;"get-var NAME"&gt; inside Pass 2 and via $NAME in Pass 3.

       WML_SRC_DIRNAME
           The current working directory from where <u>wml</u> was started.  An absolute Unix filesystem path.

       WML_SRC_FILENAME
           The name of the <u>inputfile</u> from the command line. Useful when running <u>wml</u>  on  a  bulk  of  files  and
           includefiles have to determine in which they are included.

       WML_SRC_BASENAME
           The basename of the <u>inputfile</u>, i.e. the "WML_SRC_FILENAME", but with the extension already stripped.

       WML_SRC_TIME
           The  last  modification  time of <u>inputfile</u> in "time()" format.  Useful inside footers when customized
           date format is needed.

       WML_SRC_CTIME
           The last modification time of <u>inputfile</u> in "ctime()" format.  Useful inside footers include files.

       WML_SRC_ISOTIME
           The last modification time of <u>inputfile</u> in ISO "yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss" format.  Useful  inside  footers
           include files.

       WML_SRC_USERNAME
           The Unix username of the user who own <u>inputfile</u>.

       WML_SRC_REALNAME
           The realname of the user who own <u>inputfile</u>.

       WML_GEN_TIME
           The current time of generation in "time()" format.  Useful inside footers when customized date format
           is needed.

       WML_GEN_CTIME
           The current time of generation in "ctime()" format.  Useful inside footers include files.

       WML_GEN_ISOTIME
           The  current  time  of generation in ISO "yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss" format.  Useful inside footers include
           files.

       WML_GEN_USERNAME
           The Unix username of the user who runs the <u>wml</u> process.

       WML_GEN_REALNAME
           The realname of the user who runs the <u>wml</u> process.

       WML_GEN_HOSTNAME
           The name of the host on which the <u>wml</u> command runs.

       WML_LOC_PREFIX
           The location prefix where WML was installed to at built time.

       WML_LOC_BINDIR
           The directory where WML's binaries were installed to at built time.

       WML_LOC_LIBDIR
           The directory where WML's library files were installed to at built time.

       WML_LOC_MANDIR
           The directory where WML's manual pages were installed to at built time.

       WML_VERSION
           The version identification string of WML.  Use this for  instance  in  HTML  comments  inside  header
           includes to identify the generation tools version.

   <b>USED</b> <b>VARIABLES</b>
       "WMLOPTS"
           This variable can contain a string of options.  Usually this is used by Bourne-Shell users like

             $ WMLOPTS="-DNAME1=VALUE2 -DNAME2=VALUE2"
             $ export WMLOPTS

           and by C-Shell users like

             $ setenv WMLOPTS "-DNAME1=VALUE2 -DNAME2=VALUE2"

           to make sure some variables are defined for all runs of <u>wml</u>.

       "PAGER"
           This  variable  contains the pager WML is to use. WML uses a pager when called with the <b>--verbose=</b><u>NUM</u>
           or <b>-v</b><u>NUM</u> option respectively and <u>NUM</u> is 3 or higher and therefore showing the  processed  data  after
           each pass.  Default is 'more'.

       "TMPDIR"
           This variable contains the directory WML stores its temporary files in.  Default is '<a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a>'.

</pre><h4><b>USER</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <u>$HOME/.wmlrc</u> and <u>(../)*.wmlrc</u>
           These  files  can  also  contain option strings, one option per line.  Usually the contents is one or
           more <b>-D</b> options, especially auto-adjusted ones:

             -DROOTREL~.
             -DROOTABS=<a href="http://thishost/thisarea/">http://thishost/thisarea/</a>
                :
             -DNAME1=VALUE1
             -DNAME2=VALUE2
                :

</pre><h4><b>STANDARD</b> <b>INCLUDE</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       WML is shipped with a standard set of include files.  You can directly include them via

         #use wml::category::name

       and read their own documentation via

         $ man wml::category::name

       See <b>wml::<a href="../man3/all.3.html">all</a></b>(3) for a description of all available include files.

</pre><h4><b>SPECIAL</b> <b>FEATURES</b></h4><pre>
       The WML control frontend provides a few special features on its own:

       Shebang Line Support
           WML recognizes a <u>shebang</u> line (``"#!wml" <u>options</u>'') in the <u>.wml</u> files and automatically adds  <u>options</u>
           to its command line. This line is also used by WMk. Two special features in contrast to shebang lines
           for  the Unix loader are available: WML's shebang line can be continued via a backslash character and
           the constructs %DIR and %&lt;BASE&gt; are interpolated (where %DIR is the path to the directory the  source
           while resides and %BASE is the filename of the source file without any extension).

           Example:

             #!wml -o (ALL-LANG_*)+LANG_EN:%BASE.en.html \
                   -o (ALL-LANG_*)+LANG_DE:%BASE.de.html

       Data Protection Container Tag
           WML  provides an own internal container tag named "&lt;protect [pass=SPEC]&gt;"..."&lt;/protect&gt;" which can be
           used to protect any type of data from being processed by any WML pass. When no  "pass"  attribute  is
           given  <u>SPEC</u>  defaults  to  "1-9".  When you use "pass" then <u>SPEC</u> can be either "#-", "-#", "#-#" or a
           comma separated list of passes, while "#" can be between 1 and 9.

           Example:

              &lt;script language="JavaScript"&gt;
              &lt;protect pass=2&gt;
              ...
              output = "&lt;PRE&gt;&lt;DIV ALIGN=\"CENTER\"&gt;&lt;B&gt;" + help_string + "&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/PRE&gt;"
              ...
              &lt;/protect&gt;
              &lt;/script&gt;

           Warning:

           Since WML 2.0.3, pass 1 includes extra stuff to help keeping information about line numbers  relevant
           (a la cpp).  So when writing

              &lt;protect pass=2&gt;
              #include 'foo'
              &lt;/protect&gt;

           these  extra  commands  will not be interpreted during pass 2 and will remain on output.  To suppress
           them, either compile with "-W1,-N" flag, or write

              &lt;protect pass=2&gt;
              #include 'foo' IPP_NOSYNCLINES
              &lt;/protect&gt;
