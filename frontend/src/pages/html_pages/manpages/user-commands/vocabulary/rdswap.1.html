       rdswap - a multi-language RD documents support tool

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       rdswap [ -h | -v ] filename ...

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This  tool  is  written  to  support you to write multi-language documents using the Ruby-Document-Format
       (RD).

       The idea for such a tool was originated by Minero Aoki, how has thought about, how to  make  life  easier
       for developers who have to write and maintain scripts in more than one language.

       You  have  to  specify  at  least  two filenames on the command line. One containing the Ruby script, the
       second containing a translated RD. If the script does <u>not</u> end with `.rb', it has to be the first filename
       mentioned on the command line! In opposition, all files containing  translations  <u>must</u>  <u>not</u>  ending  with
       `.rb'!  They  should  use  a  extension  that describes the language. So that would give us the following
       picture:

              <b>•</b> sample.rb : Script contains the original documentation.

              <b>•</b> sample.jp : Documentation written in Japanese.

              <b>•</b> sample.de : Translation to German.

       The tool doesn't care about the language extensions.  You  can  name  them  as  you  like!  So  the  file
       containing   the   Japanese   translation  above,  could  also  be  names  e.g.  `sample.japan'  or  even
       `japantranslation.japan'.

       For every translation file, a new file will be created. The name is build from the script  filename  plus
       the language extension. So regarding the example above, following files would be created:

              <b>•</b> sample.rb.jp

              <b>•</b> sample.rb.de

       or, given the alternative translation filename as mentioned above...

              <b>•</b> sample.rb.japan

   <b>How</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>work?</b>
       The  contents  of all files will be split into source and RD blocks. The source of the translation files,
       will be discarded! Every RD block may be of a certain type. The type will  be  taken  from  the  contents
       directly following the `=begin' on the same line. If there is only a lonely `=begin' on a line by itself,
       the type of the block is `nil'. That means in
           # File sample.rd
           :
           =begin
            bla bla
           =end
           :
           =begin whatever or not
            blub blub
           =end
           :

       the first block would be of type `nil' and the second one of type `whatever or not'.

       Block  types  are  important  for  the  translation.  If  a  source will be generated from a script and a
       translation file, only these blocks are taken from  the  translation  files,  that  comes  in  the  right
       sequence <u>and</u> contains the same type as the block in the script! For example:
           # File sample.rb
           :
           =begin gnark
            Some comment
           =end
           :
           =begin
            block 2
           =end
           :
           =begin
            block 3
           =end
           :

           # File sample.de
           :
           =begin
            Block zwei
           =end
           :
           =begin
            Block drei
           =end
           :

       Here, the first block of `sample.rb' will *not* be translated, as there is no translation block with that
       type  in  sample.de! So the first block would be inserted as-it-is into the translated script. The blocks
       afterwards, however, are translated as the block type does match (it is `nil' there).

       Attention: In a translation file, a second block will only be used, if  a  first  one  was  already  used
       (matched). A third block will only be used, if a second one was used already!

       That  means,  if  the first block of `sample.de' would be of type e.g. `Never match', then no block would
       ever be taken to replace anyone of `sample.rb'.

   <b>OPTIONS</b>
       <b>-h</b>     shows this help text.

       <b>-v</b>     shows some more text during processing.

       <b>filename</b>
              means a file, that contains RD and/or Ruby code.

   <b>EXAMPLES</b>
           rdswap -v sample.rb sample.ja sample.de
           rdswap -v sample.ja sample.rb sample.de
           rdswap -v sample.ja sample.de sample.rb
           rdswap -v sample.??
