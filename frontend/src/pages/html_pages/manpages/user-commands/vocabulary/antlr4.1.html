</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       ANTLR - ANother Tool for Language Recognition, version 4

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>antlr4</b> [<u>options</u>] <u>file.g4</u> [ <u>file2.g4</u> <u>file3.g4</u> ...]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       ANTLR  (ANother  Tool for Language Recognition) is a parser generator for reading, processing, executing,
       or translating structured text or  binary  files.  It's  widely  used  to  build  languages,  tools,  and
       frameworks. From a grammar, ANTLR generates a parser that can build and walk parse trees.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-o</b> <u>outdir</u>
              Specify output directory where all output is generated.

              ANTLR generates output files in the current directory by default. This option specifies the output
              directory where ANTLR should generate parsers, listeners, visitors, and tokens files.

       <b>-lib</b> <u>dir</u>
              Specify location of grammars, tokens files.

              When  looking  for  tokens  files  and  imported  grammars,  ANTLR  normally  looks in the current
              directory. This option specifies which directory  to  look  in  instead.   It  is  only  used  for
              resolving  grammar  references for the import statement and the tokenVocab option. The path to the
              primary grammar must always be fully specified.

       <b>-atn</b>   Generate rule augmented transition network diagrams.

              This option generates DOT graph files  that  represent  the  internal  ATN  (augmented  transition
              network) data structures that ANTLR uses to represent grammars. The files come out as Grammar.rule
              .dot. If the grammar is a combined grammar, the lexer rules are named Grammar Lexer.rule .dot.

       <b>-encoding</b> <u>encodingname</u>
              Specify grammar file encoding; e.g., euc-jp.

              By  default  ANTLR  loads grammar files using the UTF-8 encoding, which is a very common character
              file encoding that degenerates to ASCII for characters that fit in one byte. If that grammar  file
              is  not  the  default  encoding  for  your locale, you need this option so that ANTLR can properly
              interpret grammar files. This does not affect  the  input  to  the  generated  parsers,  just  the
              encoding of the grammars themselves.

       <b>-message-format</b> <u>format</u>
              Specify output style for messages in antlr, gnu, vs2005.

              ANTLR    generates    warning    and    error    messages    using    templates   from   directory
              tool/resources/org/antlr/v4/tool/templates/messages/formats.  By default, ANTLR uses the antlr.stg
              (StringTemplate group) file. You can change this to 'gnu'  or  'vs2005'  to  have  ANTLR  generate
              messages  appropriate  for  Emacs  or  Visual  Studio.  To make your own called X, create resource
              org/antlr/v4/tool/templates/messages/formats/X and place it in the CLASSPATH.

       <b>-long-messages</b>
              Show exception details when available for errors and warnings.

       <b>-listener</b>
              Generate parse tree listener (default).

       <b>-no-listener</b>
              Don't generate parse tree listener.

       <b>-visitor</b>
              Generate parse tree visitor.

              ANTLR can generate both parse tree listeners  and  visitors;  this  option  and  <b>-listener</b>  aren’t
              mutually exclusive.

       <b>-no-visitor</b>
              Don't generate parse tree visitor (default).

       <b>-package</b> <u>packagename</u>
              Specify a package/namespace for the generated code.

              Use  this  option to specify a package or namespace for ANTLR-generated files.  Alternatively, you
              can add a @header {...} action but that ties the grammar to a specific language. If you  use  this
              option  and  @header,  make  sure  that the header action does not contain a package specification
              otherwise the generated code will have two of them.

       <b>-depend</b>
              Generate file dependencies.

              Instead of generating a parser and/or lexer, generate a list of file dependencies, one  per  line.
              The  output  shows  what  each  grammar depends on and what it generates. This is useful for build
              tools that need to know ANTLR grammar dependencies.

              If you use <b>-lib</b> libdir with <b>-depend</b> and grammar option tokenVocab=A, then the dependencies include
              the library path as well.

               -Xforce-atn         use the ATN simulator for all predictions
               -Xlog               dump lots of logging info to antlr-timestamp.log

       <b>-D&lt;option&gt;=&lt;value&gt;</b>
              Set or override a grammar-level option.

              This option is useful for generating parsers in different languages without altering  the  grammar
              itself (with <b>--Dlanguage=CSharp</b> for example).

       <b>-Werror</b>
              Treat warnings as errors.

              As  part  of a large build, ANTLR warning messages could go unnoticed. Turn on this option to have
              warnings treated as errors, causing the  ANTLR  tool  to  report  failure  back  to  the  invoking
              commandline shell.

       <b>-XdbgST</b>
              Launch StringTemplate visualizer on generated code.

              For  those building a code generation target, this option brings up a window showing the generated
              code and the templates used to generate  that  code.   It  invokes  the  StringTemplate  inspector
              window.

       <b>-XdbgSTWait</b>
              Wait for STViz to close before continuing.

       <b>-Xforce-atn</b>
              Use the ATN simulator for all predictions.

              ANTLR  normally  builds  traditional “switch on token type” decisions where possible (one token of
              lookahead is sufficient to distinguish between all alternatives in  a  decision).  To  force  even
              these simple decisions into the adaptive LL(*) mechanism, use this option.

       <b>-Xlog</b>  Dump lots of logging info to antlr-timestamp.log.

              This  option creates a log file containing lots of information messages from ANTLR as it processes
              your grammar. If you would like to see how ANTLR translates your  left-recursive  rules,  turn  on
              this option and look in the resulting log file.
