       gdl - GNU Data Language incremental compiler

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>gdl</b> [--help] [-h] [--version] [-v] [-V] [[-]-quiet] [-q] [ -arg value ] [ -args ...  ] [ -e statement ] [
       -pref=/path/to/preferenceFile ] [ batch_file ...  ]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>gdl</b>  is  an incremental compiler for the GNU Data Language (GDL).  GDL is being developed with the aim of
       providing an open-source drop-in replacement for Interactive Data Language (IDL) (RSI  then  ITTVIS  then
       Exelis  and  now Harris Geospatial Solutions, Inc.). It is also partially compatible with Visual Numerics
       (VN) PV-WAVE. IDL and PV-WAVE are registered trademarks of L3Harris and VN, respectively.   GDL  and  its
       library  routines  are  designed  as  a  tool  for  numerical  data  analysis  and visualisation.  GDL is
       dynamically typed, vectorized and has object-oriented programming  capabilities.   The  library  routines
       handle  numerical  calculations,  data  visualisation,  signal/image processing, file input/output (incl.
       graphical and scientific data formats such as TIFF, PNG, netCDF, HDF etc) and interaction with host OS.

       For a list of resources on GDL/IDL/PV-WAVE syntax and library routines, see references in GDL  v1.0  JOSS
       paper: https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.04633

       GDL mailing list is maintained at: https://sympa.obspm.fr/wws/info/gdl-announces

       A vast part of GDL library routines is implemented using open-source libraries including GSL, plPlot, and
       optionally: readline, FFTW, Eigen3, ImageMagick, netCDF, HDF4, HDF5, PROJ, UDUNITS-2, libps and others.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--help</b> <b>(or</b> <b>-h)</b>
              Show summary of options

       <b>--version</b> <b>(or</b> <b>-v,</b> <b>-V)</b>
              Show version of program

       <b>--quiet</b> <b>(or</b> <b>-quiet,</b> <b>-q)</b>
              Suppress welcome messages

       <b>-arg</b> <b>value</b>
              Tells COMMAND_LINE_ARGS() to report the following argument (may be specified more than once)

       <b>-args</b> <b>...</b>
              Tells COMMAND_LINE_ARGS() to report all following arguments

       <b>-e</b> <b>statement</b>
              Execute  given statement and exit (last occurrence taken into account only, executed after startup
              file, may not be specified together with batch files)

       <b>-pref=/path/to/PreferenceFile</b>
              (only partially working now) setting using external text  file  few  variables  including  default
              preferences (e.g. X11 Windows Size)

       <b>--fakerelease</b> <b>version</b>
              setting  !VERSION.RELEASE  to that value. !VERSION.RELEASE is often tested by procedures to decide
              whether some function or option should be used. It is sometimes possible to  use  this  option  to
              fool a procedure that request a specific value of !VERSION.RELEASE (e.g. atv.pro)

       <b>--fussy</b>
              signals  that  all  used  procedures will adhere with modern IDL, where "()" are for functions and
              "[]" are for arrays.  This speeds up (sometimes terribly) compilation but choke on  every  use  of
              "()"  with  arrays.   Conversion  of  procedures  to  modern  IDL  can  be done with D. Landsman's
              idlv4_to_v5 procedure.  Use  environment  variable  "GDL_IS_FUSSY"  to  set  up  permanently  this
              feature.

              Incidentally  "being  fussy"  can help find all places in a procedure that need to be corrected to
              have it in the modern IDL format.

       <b>--silent</b>
              Supresses some messages (mainly "Compiled Module XXX" .)

       <b>--sloppy</b>
              inverse of fussy above.  Sets the traditional (default) compiling option where "()"  can  be  used
              both  with  functions  and arrays.  Needed to counteract temporarily the effect of the environment
              variable "GDL_IS_FUSSY".

       <b>--smart-tpool</b>
              switch to a mode where the number of threads is  adaptive  (experimental).  Should  enable  better
              perfs on many core machines.

       <b>--use-wx</b>
              Tells  GDL  to  use  WxWidgets graphics instead of X11 or Windows. (nicer plots).  Also enabled by
              setting the environment variable GDL_USE_WX to a non-null value.

       <b>--no-use-wx</b>
              Tells GDL no to use WxWidgets graphics, even if env. var. "GDL_USE_WX" is set.

       <b>--no-dSFMT</b>
              Tells GDL not to use double precision  SIMD  oriented  Fast  Mersenne  Twister(dSFMT)  for  random
              values.  Also disabled by setting the environment variable GDL_NO_DSFMT to a non-null value.

              With  dSFMT,  although the Mersenne Twister algorithm is the same as in modern IDL, the values are
              computed in parallel (hence a speed gain) but the output order is not the same as IDL.  Also,  the
              seed  is  different.  Theses differences should not be a problem as it is discouraged to interfere
              with seed values.

              The -demo, -em, -novm, -queue, -rt, -ulicense and -vm options are ignored for  compatibility  with
              IDL.

       A list of batch files to be executed before entering the interactive
              mode (but after executing a startup file, if specified) may be given when not using the -e option.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>$DATADIR/gnudatalanguage/lib/*.pro</b>
              Library  routines  implemented  in  GDL.  $DATADIR  is  specified  during  compilation and usually
              translates to <a href="file:/usr/share">/usr/share</a>, <a href="file:/usr/local/share">/usr/local/share</a> or alike. GDL includes this  directory  in  its  search
              path unless GDL_PATH or IDL_PATH env. variables are set (see below).

       <b>$HOME/.gdl/history</b>
              A  file  used  for storing the history of commands issued in the interactive mode (if GDL compiled
              within ReadLine)

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       The following environment variables have special meaning to <b>gdl</b>.  The <b>GDL_*</b> variant,  if  defined,  takes
       precedence over any corresponding <b>IDL_*</b> variant.

       <b>GDL_PATH,</b> <b>IDL_PATH</b>
              The GDL command (script) search path.

       <b>GDL_STARTUP,</b> <b>IDL_STARTUP</b>
              A file of commands to be executed on startup.

       <b>GDL_TMPDIR,</b> <b>IDL_TMPDIR</b>
              A directory in which temporary files may be created.

       <b>HOME,</b> <b>SHELL</b>
              Variables  influencing  shell  invocations  from within GDL (SPAWN procedure and the $ interpreter
              command).  Value of HOME determines as well the location of the GDL history-file.

       <b>PATH</b>   Determines search path when spawning child processes using the SPAWN procedure with  the  /NOSHELL
              keyword set.

       <b>PYTHONPATH</b>
              Influences  behaviour of PYTHON procedure and PYTHON() function (available if GDL is compiled with
              support for calling Python code)

       <b>GDL_MPI</b>
              A message to be sent out using MPI_Send before initialization of the interpreter (available if GDL
              is compiled with support for MPI)

       <b>DISPLAY,</b> <b>XENVIRONMENT</b>
              Tell GDL how to connect to the X server

       <b>LC_*</b>   The locale-related settings accessible via LOCALE_GET() (GDL always uses the C locale internally)

       <b>GDL_GR_WIN_HEIGHT</b>
              Sets the preference for the default height of a Windows(tm) graphic window

       <b>GDL_GR_WIN_QSCREEN</b>
              if set to true (1) this will  prevent  the  use  of  the  GDL_GR_WIN_HEIGHT  and  GDL_GR_WIN_WIDTH
              preferences and the default dimensions of graphic windows will be 1/4 of the screen dimensions

       <b>GDL_GR_WIN_WIDTH</b>
              Sets the preference for the default width of a Windows(tm) graphic window

       <b>GDL_GR_X_HEIGHT</b>
              Sets the preference for the default height of an X11 graphic window

       <b>GDL_GR_X_QSCREEN</b>
              if set to true (1) this will prevent the use of the GDL_GR_X_HEIGHT and GDL_GR_X_WIDTH preferences
              and the default dimensions of graphic windows will be 1/4 of the screen dimensions

       <b>GDL_GR_X_WIDTH</b>
              Sets the preference for the default width of an X11 graphic window

       <b>GDL_WX_BACKEND</b>
              can  be  set  to  [0,1,2]  which will select, respectively, the back-ends 0,1 or 2 of plplot's old
              wxWidgets driver (plplot versions &lt; 5.10). Back-end 2 has anti-aliasing enabled.

       <b>GDL_MAPS_DIR</b>
              If not automatically found,  tells  GDL  where  the  maps  files  (coasts  rivers,  etc,  used  by
              MAPS_CONTINENTS)  are  located.   These are in Shapefile format and newer versions can possibly be
              present on naturalearthdata.com
