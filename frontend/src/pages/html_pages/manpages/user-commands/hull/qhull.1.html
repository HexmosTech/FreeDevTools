</pre><h4><b>INTRODUCTION</b></h4><pre>
       Qhull is a general dimension code for computing convex hulls, Delaunay triangulations,  Voronoi  diagram,
       furthest‐site Voronoi diagram, furthest‐site Delaunay triangulations, and halfspace intersections about a
       point.   It  implements  the  Quickhull algorithm for computing the convex hull.  Qhull handles round‐off
       errors from floating point arithmetic.  It can approximate a convex hull.

       The program includes  options  for  hull  volume,  facet  area,  partial  hulls,  input  transformations,
       randomization,  tracing,  multiple  output  formats, and execution statistics.  The program can be called
       from within your application.  You can view the results in 2‐d, 3‐d and 4‐d with Geomview.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The format of input is the following: first line contains the dimension, second line contains the  number
       of  input  points,  and  point  coordinates  follow.  The dimension and number of points can be reversed.
       Comments and line breaks are ignored.  A comment starts with a non‐numeric character and continues to the
       end of line.  The first comment is reported in summaries and statistics.  Error reporting  is  better  if
       there is one point per line.

       The default printout option is a short summary. There are many other output formats.

       Qhull  implements  the  Quickhull  algorithm  for  convex hull. This algorithm combines the 2‐d Quickhull
       algorithm with the n‐d beneath‐beyond algorithm [c.f., Preparata &amp; Shamos '85].  It  is  similar  to  the
       randomized algorithms of Clarkson and others [Clarkson et al. '93].  The main advantages of Quickhull are
       output sensitive performance, reduced space requirements, and automatic handling of precision problems.

       The  data  structure  produced by Qhull consists of vertices, ridges, and facets.  A vertex is a point of
       the input set.  A ridge is a set of d vertices and two neighboring facets.  For example in 3‐d,  a  ridge
       is an edge of the polyhedron.  A facet is a set of ridges, a set of neighboring facets, a set of incident
       vertices,  and  a hyperplane equation.  For simplicial facets, the ridges are defined by the vertices and
       neighboring facets.  When Qhull merges two facets, it produces a non‐simplicial facet.  A  non‐simplicial
       facet has more than d neighbors and may share more than one ridge with a neighbor.

</pre><h4><b>IMPRECISION</b></h4><pre>
       Since  Qhull  uses floating point arithmetic, roundoff error may occur for each calculation.  This causes
       problems for most geometric algorithms.

       Qhull automatically sets option 'C-0' in 2‐d, 3‐d, and 4‐d, or option 'Qx'  in  5‐d  and  higher.   These
       options handle precision problems by merging facets.  Alternatively, use option 'QJ' to joggle the input.

       With  'C-0', Qhull merges non‐convex facets while constructing the hull. The remaining facets are clearly
       convex. With 'Qx', Qhull merges coplanar horizon facets, flipped facets, concave  facets  and  duplicated
       ridges.   It  merges  coplanar  facets  after  constructing  the hull.  With 'Qx', coplanar points may be
       missed, but it appears to be unlikely.

       To guarantee triangular output, joggle the input with option 'QJ'.  Facet merging will not occur.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       To get a list of the most important options, execute 'qhull -?'.  To get  a  complete  list  of  options,
       execute 'qhull -'.  To get a complete, concise list of options, execute 'qhull .'.

       Options can be in any order.  Capitalized options take an argument (except 'PG' and 'F' options).  Single
       letters  are  used for output formats and precision constants.  The other options are grouped into menus:
       output formats ('F'), Geomview output ('G'), printing ('P'), Qhull control ('Q'), and tracing ('T').

       Main options:

       default
              Compute the convex hull of the input points.  Report a summary of the result.

       d      Compute the Delaunay triangulation by lifting the input points to a paraboloid.   The  'o'  option
              prints  the  input  points  and  facets.   The 'QJ' option guarantees triangular output.  The 'Ft'
              option prints a triangulation.  It adds points (the centrums) to non‐simplicial facets.

       v      Compute the Voronoi diagram from the Delaunay triangulation.  The 'p' option  prints  the  Voronoi
              vertices.  The 'o' option prints the Voronoi vertices and the vertices in each Voronoi region.  It
              lists  regions  in  site ID order.  The 'Fv' option prints each ridge of the Voronoi diagram.  The
              first or zero'th vertex indicates the infinity vertex.  Its coordinates are qh_INFINITE (-10.101).
              It indicates unbounded Voronoi regions or degenerate Delaunay triangles.

       Hn,n,...
              Compute halfspace intersection about [n,n,0,...].  The input is a set of halfspaces defined in the
              same format as 'n', 'Fo', and 'Fi'.  Use 'Fp' to print the intersection points.  Use 'Fv' to  list
              the  intersection  points  for  each  halfspace.  The other output formats display the dual convex
              hull.

              The point [n,n,n,...] is a feasible point for the halfspaces, i.e., a point that is inside all  of
              the halfspaces (Hx+b &lt;= 0).  The default coordinate value is 0.

              The  input  may  start  with a feasible point.  If so, use 'H' by itself.  The input starts with a
              feasible point when the first number  is  the  dimension,  the  second  number  is  "1",  and  the
              coordinates complete a line.  The 'FV' option produces a feasible point for a convex hull.

       d Qu   Compute  the  furthest‐site  Delaunay  triangulation  from  the upper convex hull.  The 'o' option
              prints the input points and facets.  The 'QJ' option guarantees triangular otuput.  You  can  also
              use 'Ft' to triangulate via the centrums of non‐simplicial facets.

       v Qu   Compute  the  furthest‐site Voronoi diagram.  The 'p' option prints the Voronoi vertices.  The 'o'
              option prints the Voronoi vertices and the vertices in  each  Voronoi  region.   The  'Fv'  option
              prints  each  ridge  of  the  Voronoi diagram.  The first or zero'th vertex indicates the infinity
              vertex at infinity.  Its coordinates are qh_INFINITE (-10.101).  It  indicates  unbounded  Voronoi
              regions and degenerate Delaunay triangles.

       Input/Output options:

       f      Print all facets and all fields of each facet.

       G      Output  the  hull  in Geomview format.  For imprecise hulls, Geomview displays the inner and outer
              hull.   Geomview  can  also  display  points,  ridges,  vertices,  coplanar  points,   and   facet
              intersections.  See below for a list of options.

              For   Delaunay   triangulations,   'G'  displays  the  corresponding  paraboloid.   For  halfspace
              intersection, 'G' displays the dual polytope.

       i      Output the incident vertices for each facet.  Qhull prints the number of facets  followed  by  the
              vertices of each facet.  One facet is printed per line.  The numbers are the 0‐relative indices of
              the corresponding input points.  The facets are oriented.

              In  4d  and  higher,  Qhull triangulates non‐simplicial facets.  Each apex (the first vertex) is a
              created point that corresponds to the facet's centrum.  Its index is greater than the  indices  of
              the  input  points.  Each base corresponds to a simplicial ridge between two facets.  To print the
              vertices without triangulation, use option 'Fv'.  To print the  centrum  coordinates,  use  option
              'Ft'.  The centrum indices for option 'i' are one more than the centrum indices for option 'Ft'.

       m      Output  the  hull  in  Mathematica format.  Qhull writes a Mathematica file for 2‐d and 3‐d convex
              hulls and for 2‐d Delaunay triangulations.   Qhull produces a list of objects that you can  assign
              to  a variable in Mathematica, for example: "list= &lt;&lt; &lt;outputfilename&gt; ". If the object is 2‐d, it
              can   be   visualized   by   "Show[Graphics[list]]   ".   For   3‐d   objects   the   command   is
              "Show[Graphics3D[list]]".

       n      Output  the  normal equation for each facet.  Qhull prints the dimension (plus one), the number of
              facets, and the normals for each facet.  The facet's offset follows its normal coefficients.

       o      Output the facets in OFF file format.  Qhull prints the dimension, number  of  points,  number  of
              facets, and number of ridges.  Then it prints the coordinates of the input points and the vertices
              for  each  facet.   Each facet is on a separate line.  The first number is the number of vertices.
              The remainder are the indices of the corresponding points.  The vertices are oriented in 2‐d, 3‐d,
              and in simplicial facets.

              For 2‐d Voronoi diagrams, the vertices are sorted by adjacency, but  not  oriented.   In  3‐d  and
              higher, the Voronoi vertices are sorted by index.  See the 'v' option for more information.

       p      Output  the  coordinates  of each vertex point.  Qhull prints the dimension, the number of points,
              and the coordinates for each vertex.  With the 'Gc' and 'Gi' options, it also prints coplanar  and
              interior points.  For Voronoi diagrams, it prints the coordinates of each Voronoi vertex.

       s      Print  a  summary  to  stderr.  If no output options are specified, a summary goes to stdout.  The
              summary lists the number of input points, the dimension, the number  of  vertices  in  the  convex
              hull,  the  number  of  facets  in  the  convex  hull,  the  number  of good facets (if 'Pg'), and
              statistics.

              The last two statistics (if needed) measure the maximum distance from  a  point  or  vertex  to  a
              facet.   The  number in parenthesis (e.g., 2.1x) is the ratio between the maximum distance and the
              worst‐case distance due to merging two simplicial facets.

       Precision options

       An     Maximum angle given as a cosine.  If the angle between a pair of facet normals is greater than  n,
              Qhull  merges  one  of  the  facets into a neighbor.  If 'n' is negative, Qhull tests angles after
              adding each point to the hull (pre‐merging).   If  'n'  is  positive,  Qhull  tests  angles  after
              constructing the hull (post‐merging).  Both pre‐ and post‐merging can be defined.

              Option  'C0'  or 'C-0' is set if the corresponding 'Cn' or 'C-n' is not set.  If 'Qx' is set, then
              'A-n' and 'C-n' are checked after the hull is constructed and before 'An' and 'Cn' are checked.

       Cn     Centrum radius.  If a centrum is less than n below a neighboring facet, Qhull merges  one  of  the
              facets.   If 'n' is negative or '-0', Qhull tests and merges facets after adding each point to the
              hull.  This is called "pre‐merging".   If  'n'  is  positive,  Qhull  tests  for  convexity  after
              constructing the hull ("post‐merging").  Both pre‐ and post‐merging can be defined.

              For  5‐d  and  higher, 'Qx' should be used instead of 'C-n'.  Otherwise, most or all facets may be
              merged together.

       En     Maximum roundoff error for distance computations.

       Rn     Randomly perturb distance computations up to +/-  n  *  max_coord.   This  option  perturbs  every
              distance,  hyperplane,  and  angle computation.  To use time as the random number seed, use option
              'QR-1'.

       Vn     Minimum distance for a facet to be visible.  A facet is visible if the distance from the point  to
              the facet is greater than 'Vn'.

              Without  merging,  the  default  value  for 'Vn' is the round‐off error ('En').  With merging, the
              default value is the pre‐merge centrum ('C-n') in 2‐d  or  3‐d,  or  three  times  that  in  other
              dimensions.   If  the  outside  width  is specified ('Wn'), the maximum, default value for 'Vn' is
              'Wn'.

       Un     Maximum distance below a facet for a point to be coplanar to the  facet.   The  default  value  is
              'Vn'.

       Wn     Minimum  outside  width of the hull.  Points are added to the convex hull only if they are clearly
              outside of a facet.  A point is outside of a facet if its distance to the facet  is  greater  than
              'Wn'.   The  normal  value  for  'Wn' is 'En'.  If the user specifies pre‐merging and does not set
              'Wn', than 'Wn' is set to the premerge 'Cn' and maxcoord*(1-An).

       Additional input/output formats

       Fa     Print area for each facet.  For Delaunay triangulations, the area is the  area  of  the  triangle.
              For  Voronoi  diagrams,  the  area  is  the  area of the dual facet.  Use 'PAn' for printing the n
              largest facets, and option 'PFn' for printing facets larger than 'n'.

              The area for non‐simplicial facets is the sum  of  the  areas  for  each  ridge  to  the  centrum.
              Vertices  far  below  the  facet's hyperplane are ignored.  The reported area may be significantly
              less than the actual area.

       FA     Compute the total area and volume for option 's'.   It  is  an  approximation  for  non‐simplicial
              facets (see 'Fa').

       Fc     Print  coplanar  points  for  each facet.  The output starts with the number of facets.  Then each
              facet is printed one per line.  Each line is the number of coplanar points followed by  the  point
              ids.   Option 'Qi' includes the interior points.  Each coplanar point (interior point) is assigned
              to the facet it is furthest above (resp., least below).

       FC     Print centrums for each facet.  The output starts with the dimension followed  by  the  number  of
              facets.  Then each facet centrum is printed, one per line.

       Fd     Read  input  in  cdd  format  with homogeneous points.  The input starts with comments.  The first
              comment is reported in the summary.  Data starts after a "begin"  line.   The  next  line  is  the
              number  of points followed by the dimension+1 and "real" or "integer".  Then the points are listed
              with a leading "1" or "1.0".  The data ends with an "end" line.

              For halfspaces ('Fd Hn,n,...'), the input format is the same.   Each  halfspace  starts  with  its
              offset.  The sign of the offset is the opposite of Qhull's convention.

       FD     Print normals ('n', 'Fo', 'Fi') or points ('p') in cdd format.  The first line is the command line
              that  invoked  Qhull.  Data starts with a "begin" line.  The next line is the number of normals or
              points followed by the dimension+1 and "real".  Then the normals or points are  listed   with  the
              offset  before  the  coefficients.   The offset for points is 1.0.  The offset for normals has the
              opposite sign.  The data ends with an "end" line.

       FF     Print facets (as in 'f') without printing the ridges.

       Fi     Print inner planes for each facet.  The inner plane is below all vertices.

       Fi     Print separating hyperplanes for bounded, inner regions of the Voronoi diagram.  The first line is
              the number of ridges.  Then each hyperplane is printed, one per line.   A  line  starts  with  the
              number  of  indices  and floats.  The first pair lists adjacent input sites, the next d floats are
              the normalized coefficients for the hyperplane, and the last float is the offset.  The  hyperplane
              is  oriented  toward  'QVn' (if defined), or the first input site of the pair.  Use 'Tv' to verify
              that the hyperplanes are perpendicular bisectors.  Use 'Fo' for unbounded regions,  and  'Fv'  for
              the corresponding Voronoi vertices.

       FI     Print facet identifiers.

       Fm     Print  number  of  merges for each facet.  At most 511 merges are reported for a facet.  See 'PMn'
              for printing the facets with the most merges.

       FM     Output the hull in Maple format.  Qhull writes a Maple file for 2‐d and 3‐d convex hulls  and  for
              2‐d Delaunay triangulations.   Qhull produces a '.mpl' file for displaying with display3d().

       Fn     Print  neighbors for each facet.  The output starts with the number of facets.  Then each facet is
              printed one per line.  Each line is the  number  of  neighbors  followed  by  an  index  for  each
              neighbor.  The indices match the other facet output formats.

              A  negative index indicates an unprinted facet due to printing only good facets ('Pg').  It is the
              negation of the facet's ID (option 'FI').  For example, negative indices are used for  facets  "at
              infinity" in the Delaunay triangulation.

       FN     Print  vertex neighbors or coplanar facet for each point.  The first line is the number of points.
              Then each point is printed, one per line.  If the point is coplanar, the line is "1"  followed  by
              the  facet's ID.  If the point is not a selected vertex, the line is "0".  Otherwise, each line is
              the number of neighbors followed by the corresponding facet indices (see 'Fn').

       Fo     Print outer planes for each facet in the same format as 'n'.  The outer plane is above all points.

       Fo     Print separating hyperplanes for unbounded, outer regions of the Voronoi diagram.  The first  line
              is  the  number of ridges.  Then each hyperplane is printed, one per line.  A line starts with the
              number of indices and floats.  The first pair lists adjacent input sites, the next  d  floats  are
              the  normalized coefficients for the hyperplane, and the last float is the offset.  The hyperplane
              is oriented toward 'QVn' (if defined), or the first input site of the pair.  Use  'Tv'  to  verify
              that  the hyperplanes are perpendicular bisectors.  Use 'Fi' for bounded regions, and 'Fv' for the
              corresponding Voronoi vertices.

       FO     List all options to stderr, including the default values.  Additional 'FO's are printed to stdout.

       Fp     Print points for halfspace intersections (option 'Hn,n,...').  Each intersection corresponds to  a
              facet  of  the  dual polytope.  The "infinity" point [-10.101,-10.101,...]  indicates an unbounded
              intersection.

       FP     For each coplanar point ('Qc') print the point ID of the nearest vertex, the point ID,  the  facet
              ID, and the distance.

       FQ     Print command used for qhull and input.

       Fs     Print  a  summary.   The  first  line  consists  of  the number of integers ("8"), followed by the
              dimension, the number of points, the number of vertices, the  number  of  facets,  the  number  of
              vertices  selected  for  output,  the number of facets selected for output, the number of coplanar
              points selected for output, number of simplicial, unmerged facets in output

              The second line consists of the number of reals ("2"), followed by the maxmimum offset to an outer
              plane and and minimum offset to an inner plane.  Roundoff is included.  Later  versions  of  Qhull
              may produce additional integers or reals.

       FS     Print  the size of the hull.  The first line consists of the number of integers ("0").  The second
              line consists of the number of reals ("2"), followed by  the  total  facet  area,  and  the  total
              volume.  Later versions of Qhull may produce additional integers or reals.

              The  total volume measures the volume of the intersection of the halfspaces defined by each facet.
              Both area and volume are approximations for non‐simplicial facets.  See option 'Fa'.

       Ft     Print a triangulation with added  points  for  non‐simplicial  facets.   The  first  line  is  the
              dimension  and  the  second  line  is  the  number of points and the number of facets.  The points
              follow, one per line, then the facets follow as a list of point indices.  With  option  'Qz',  the
              points include the point‐at‐infinity.

       Fv     Print  vertices  for  each  facet.   The  first  line is the number of facets.  Then each facet is
              printed, one per line.  Each line is the number of vertices followed by  the  corresponding  point
              ids.  Vertices are listed in the order they were added to the hull (the last one is first).

       Fv     Print  all  ridges of a Voronoi diagram.  The first line is the number of ridges.  Then each ridge
              is printed, one per line.  A line starts with  the  number  of  indices.   The  first  pair  lists
              adjacent  input  sites,  the  remaining  indices  list Voronoi vertices.  Vertex '0' indicates the
              vertex‐at‐infinity (i.e., an unbounded ray).  In 3‐d, the vertices are listed in order.  See  'Fi'
              and 'Fo' for separating hyperplanes.

       FV     Print average vertex.  The average vertex is a feasible point for halfspace intersection.

       Fx     List  extreme  points (vertices) of the convex hull.  The first line is the number of points.  The
              other lines give the indices of the corresponding points.  The first point is '0'.   In  2‐d,  the
              points  occur  in  counter‐clockwise  order;  otherwise  they  occur in input order.  For Delaunay
              triangulations, 'Fx' lists the extreme points of the input sites.  The points are unordered.

       Geomview options

       G      Produce a file for viewing with Geomview.  Without other options, Qhull  displays  edges  in  2‐d,
              outer  planes  in 3‐d, and ridges in 4‐d.  A ridge can be explicit or implicit.  An explicit ridge
              is a dim-1 dimensional simplex between two facets.  In 4‐d, the  explicit  ridges  are  triangles.
              When  displaying  a  ridge  in  4‐d,  Qhull  projects  the  ridge's vertices to one of its facets'
              hyperplanes.  Use 'Gh' to project ridges to the intersection of both hyperplanes.

       Ga     Display all input points as dots.

       Gc     Display the centrum for each facet in 3‐d.  The centrum is defined by a green radius sitting on  a
              blue  plane.   The plane corresponds to the facet's hyperplane.  The radius is defined by 'C-n' or
              'Cn'.

       GDn    Drop dimension n in 3‐d or 4‐d.  The result is a 2‐d or 3‐d object.

       Gh     Display hyperplane intersections in 3‐d and 4‐d.   In 3‐d, the intersection is a black  line.   It
              lies  on two neighboring hyperplanes (c.f., the blue squares associated with centrums ('Gc')).  In
              4‐d, the ridges are projected to the intersection of both hyperplanes.

       Gi     Display inner planes in 2‐d and 3‐d.  The inner plane of a facet is below all of its vertices.  It
              is parallel to the facet's hyperplane.  The inner plane's color is the opposite  (1-r,1-g,1-b)  of
              the outer plane.  Its edges are determined by the vertices.

       Gn     Do  not  display  inner  or  outer  planes.   By  default, Geomview displays the precise plane (no
              merging) or both inner and output planes (merging).  Under merging, Geomview does not display  the
              inner plane if the the difference between inner and outer is too small.

       Go     Display outer planes in 2‐d and 3‐d.  The outer plane of a facet is above all input points.  It is
              parallel  to the facet's hyperplane.  Its color is determined by the facet's normal, and its edges
              are determined by the vertices.

       Gp     Display coplanar points and vertices as radii.  A radius defines a ball which corresponds  to  the
              imprecision  of  the  point.   The  imprecision  is the maximum of the roundoff error, the centrum
              radius, and maxcoord * (1-An).  It is at least 1/20'th of  the  maximum  coordinate,  and  ignores
              post‐merging if pre‐merging is done.

       Gr     Display  ridges  in 3‐d.  A ridge connects the two vertices that are shared by neighboring facets.
              Ridges are always displayed in 4‐d.

       Gt     A 3‐d Delaunay triangulation looks like a convex hull with interior facets.  Option  'Gt'  removes
              the outside ridges to reveal the outermost facets.  It automatically sets options 'Gr' and 'GDn'.

       Gv     Display vertices as spheres.  The radius of the sphere corresponds to the imprecision of the data.
              See 'Gp' for determining the radius.

       Print options

       PAn    Only the n largest facets are marked good for printing.  Unless 'PG' is set, 'Pg' is automatically
              set.

       Pdk:n  Drop facet from output if normal[k] &lt;= n.  The option 'Pdk' uses the default value of 0 for n.

       PDk:n  Drop facet from output if normal[k] &gt;= n.  The option 'PDk' uses the default value of 0 for n.

       PFn    Only  facets  with  area  at  least 'n' are marked good for printing.  Unless 'PG' is set, 'Pg' is
              automatically set.

       Pg     Print only good facets.  A good facet is either  visible  from  a  point  (the  'QGn'  option)  or
              includes  a  point (the 'QVn' option).  It also meets the requirements of 'Pdk' and 'PDk' options.
              Option 'Pg' is automatically set for options 'd', 'PAn', 'PFn', and 'PMn'.

       PG     Print neighbors of good facets.

       PMn    Only the n facets with the most merges are marked good for printing.  Unless 'PG' is set, 'Pg'  is
              automatically set.

       Po     Force  output  despite precision problems.  Verify ('Tv') does not check coplanar points.  Flipped
              facets are reported and concave facets are counted.  If 'Po' is used, points are  not  partitioned
              into  flipped  facets  and a flipped facet is always visible to a point.  Also, if an error occurs
              before the completion of Qhull and tracing is not active,  'Po'  outputs  a  neighborhood  of  the
              erroneous facets (if any).

       Pp     Do not report precision problems.

       Qhull control options

       Qa     Allow input with fewer or more points than coordinates

       Qbk:0Bk:0
              Drop  dimension  k  from  the  input  points.   This  allows the user to take convex hulls of sub‐
              dimensional objects.  It happens before the Delaunay and Voronoi transformation.

       QbB    Scale the input points to fit the unit cube.  After scaling, the lower bound will be -0.5 and  the
              upper  bound  +0.5  in  all  dimensions.  For Delaunay and Voronoi diagrams, scaling happens after
              projection to the paraboloid.  Under precise arithmetic, scaling does not change the  topology  of
              the convex hull.

       Qbb    Scale  the  last  coordinate  to  [0,  m]  where  m  is  the  maximum  absolute value of the other
              coordinates.  For  Delaunay  and  Voronoi  diagrams,  scaling  happens  after  projection  to  the
              paraboloid.   It  reduces  roundoff  error  for  inputs  with  integer coordinates.  Under precise
              arithmetic, scaling does not change the topology of the convex hull.

       Qbk:n  Scale the k'th coordinate of the input points.  After scaling, the lower bound of the input points
              will be n.  'Qbk' scales to -0.5.

       QBk:n  Scale the k'th coordinate of the input points.  After scaling, the upper bound will be  n.   'QBk'
              scales to +0.5.

       Qc     Keep  coplanar points with the nearest facet.  Output formats 'p', 'f', 'Gp', 'Fc', 'FN', and 'FP'
              will print the points.

       Qf     Partition points to the furthest outside facet.

       Qg     Only build good facets.  With the 'Qg' option, Qhull will only build those facets that it needs to
              determine the good facets in the output.  See 'QGn', 'QVn', and 'PdD' for  defining  good  facets,
              and 'Pg' and 'PG' for printing good facets and their neighbors.

       QGn    A  facet  is good (see 'Qg' and 'Pg') if it is visible from point n.  If n &lt; 0, a facet is good if
              it is not visible from point n.  Point n is not added to the hull (unless 'TCn' or  'TPn').   With
              rbox, use the 'Pn,m,r' option to define your point; it will be point 0 (QG0).

       Qi     Keep  interior points with the nearest facet.  Output formats 'p', 'f', 'Gp', 'FN', 'FP', and 'Fc'
              will print the points.

       QJn    Joggle each input coordinate by adding a random number in [-n,n].  If a  precision  error  occurs,
              then  qhull  increases  n  and tries again.  It does not increase n beyond a certain value, and it
              stops after a certain number of attempts [see user.h].  Option 'QJ' selects a default value for n.
              The output will be simplicial.  For Delaunay triangulations, 'QJn' sets 'Qbb' to  scale  the  last
              coordinate  (not  if  'Qbk:n'  or 'QBk:n' is set).  ´QJn' is deprecated for Voronoi diagrams.  See
              also 'Qt'.

       Qm     Only process points that would otherwise  increase  max_outside.   Other  points  are  treated  as
              coplanar or interior points.

       Qr     Process  random  outside  points  instead  of  furthest  ones.  This makes Qhull equivalent to the
              randomized  incremental  algorithms.   CPU  time  is  not  reported  since  the  randomization  is
              inefficient.

       QRn    Randomly  rotate  the input points.  If n=0, use time as the random number seed.  If n&gt;0, use n as
              the random number seed.  If n=-1, don't rotate but use  time  as  the  random  number  seed.   For
              Delaunay triangulations ('d' and 'v'), rotate about the last axis.

       Qs     Search all points for the initial simplex.

       Qt     Triangulated  output.   Triangulate  all  non‐simplicial  facets.   ´Qt' is deprecated for Voronoi
              diagrams.  See also 'Qt'.

       Qv     Test vertex neighbors for convexity after post‐merging.  To use the 'Qv' option, you also need  to
              set a merge option (e.g., 'Qx' or 'C-0').

       QVn    A  good  facet  (see  'Qg' and 'Pg') includes point n.  If n&lt;0, then a good facet does not include
              point n.  The point is either in the initial simplex or it is the first point added to  the  hull.
              Option 'QVn' may not be used with merging.

       Qw     Allow option warnings. Otherwise Qhull returns an error after most option warnings

       Qx     Perform  exact  merges  while  building  the  hull.  The "exact" merges are merging a point into a
              coplanar facet (defined by 'Vn', 'Un', and  'C-n'),  merging  concave  facets,  merging  duplicate
              ridges,  and  merging  flipped  facets.  Coplanar merges and angle coplanar merges ('A-n') are not
              performed.  Concavity testing is delayed until a merge occurs.

              After the hull is built, all coplanar merges are performed (defined  by  'C-n'  and  'A-n'),  then
              post‐merges are performed (defined by 'Cn' and 'An').

       Qz     Add  a  point  "at  infinity" that is above the paraboloid for Delaunay triangulations and Voronoi
              diagrams.  This reduces precision problems and allows the triangulation of cospherical points.

       Qhull experiments and speedups

       Q0     Turn off pre‐merging as a default option.  With 'Q0'/'Qx' and without explicit pre‐merge  options,
              Qhull  ignores  precision  issues  while constructing the convex hull.  This may lead to precision
              errors.  If so, a descriptive warning is generated.

       Q1     With 'Q1', Qhull merges by mergetype/angle instead of mergetype/distance.

       Q2     With 'Q2', Qhull merges all facets at once instead of using independent sets of  merges  and  then
              retesting.

       Q3     With 'Q3', Qhull does not remove redundant vertices.

       Q4     With 'Q4', Qhull avoids merges of an old facet into a new facet.

       Q5     With  'Q5',  Qhull  does  not  correct  outer  planes at the end.  The maximum outer plane is used
              instead.

       Q6     With 'Q6', Qhull does not pre‐merge concave or coplanar facets.

       Q7     With 'Q7', Qhull processes facets in depth‐first order instead of breadth‐first order.

       Q8     With 'Q8' and merging, Qhull does not retain near‐interior  points  for  adjusting  outer  planes.
              'Qc' will probably retain all points that adjust outer planes.

       Q9     With 'Q9', Qhull processes the furthest of all outside sets at each iteration.

       Q10    With 'Q10', Qhull does not use special processing for narrow distributions.

       Q11    With 'Q11', Qhull copies normals and recompute centrums for tricoplanar facets.

       Q12    With 'Q12', Qhull allows wide facets and wide dupridge.

       Q14    With 'Q14', Qhull merges pinched vertices that create a dupridge.

       Q15    With 'Q15', Qhull checks for duplicate ridges with the same vertices.

       Trace options

       Tn     Trace  at  level n.  Qhull includes full execution tracing.  'T-1' traces events.  'T1' traces the
              overall execution of the program.  'T2'  and  'T3'  trace  overall  execution  and  geometric  and
              topological events.  'T4' traces the algorithm.  'T5' includes information about memory allocation
              and Gaussian elimination.

       Ta     Annotate output with codes that identify the corresponding qh_fprintf() statement.

       TAn    Stop Qhull after adding n vertices.

       Tc     Check frequently during execution.  This will catch most inconsistency errors.

       TCn    Stop  Qhull  after  building  the cone of new facets for point n.  The output for 'f' includes the
              cone and the old hull.  See also 'TVn'.

       Tf     Flush output after each qh_fprintf.  Use 'Tf' for debugging segfaults.  See 'Tz'  for  redirecting
              stderr.

       TFn    Report  progress  whenever  more  than  n  facets  are  created During post‐merging, 'TFn' reports
              progress after more than n/2 merges.

       TI file
              Input data from 'file'.  The filename may not include spaces or quotes.

       TMn    Turn on tracing at n'th merge.

       TO file
              Output results to 'file'.  The name may be enclosed in single quotes.

       TPn    Turn on tracing when point n is added to the hull.  Trace partitions of point  n.   If  used  with
              TWn, turn off tracing after adding point n to the hull.

       TP-1   Turn on tracing after qh_buildhull and qh_postmerge.

       TRn    Rerun  qhull  n  times.   Usually used with 'QJn' to determine the probability that a given joggle
              will fail.

       Ts     Collect statistics and print to stderr at the end of execution.

       Tv     Verify the convex hull.  This  checks  the  topological  structure,  facet  convexity,  and  point
              inclusion.   If  precision  problems  occurred,  facet  convexity is tested whether or not 'Tv' is
              selected.  Option 'Tv' does not check point inclusion if forcing output with 'Po', or if  'Q5'  is
              set.

              For  point  inclusion  testing,  Qhull  verifies  that  all  points  are  below  all  outer planes
              (facet-&gt;maxoutside).  Point inclusion is exhaustive if merging or if the  facet‐point  product  is
              small enough; otherwise Qhull verifies each point with a directed search (qh_findbest).

              Point  inclusion  testing  occurs  after  producing  output.  It prints a message to stderr unless
              option 'Pp' is used.  This allows the user to interrupt Qhull without changing the output.

       TVn    Stop Qhull after adding point n.  If n &lt; 0, stop Qhull before adding point n.   Output  shows  the
              hull at this time.  See also 'TCn'

       TWn    Trace merge facets when the width is greater than n.

       Tz     Redirect stderr to stdout.  See 'Tf' for flushing writes.

       Please report bugs to Brad Barber at <a href="mailto:qhull_bug@qhull.org">qhull_bug@qhull.org</a>.

       If Qhull does not compile, it is due to an incompatibility between your system and ours.  The first thing
       to  check  is that your compiler is ANSI standard.  If it is, check the man page for the best options, or
       find someone to help you.  If you locate the cause of your problem, please send email since it might help
       others.

       If Qhull compiles but crashes on the test case (rbox D4),  there's  still  incompatibility  between  your
       system  and  ours.  Typically it's been due to mem.c and memory alignment.  You can use qh_NOmem in mem.h
       to turn off memory management.  Please let us know if you figure out how to fix these problems.

       If you do find a problem, try to simplify it before reporting the error.  Try different  size  inputs  to
       locate  the  smallest  one  that  causes  an  error.   You're  welcome to hunt through the code using the
       execution trace as a guide.  This is especially true if you're incorporating Qhull into your own program.

       When you do report an error, please attach a data set to the end of your message.  This allows us to  see
       the error for ourselves.  Qhull is maintained part‐time.
