       klcc - compile a program against klibc

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>klcc</b> [<u>gcc</u> <u>options</u>] [<b>-o</b> <u>outfile</u>] <u>infile...</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>klcc</b>  is  a  wrapper  around <b><a href="../man1/gcc.1.html">gcc</a></b>(1) and <b><a href="../man1/ld.1.html">ld</a></b>(1) which compiles and links a program against the <b>klibc</b> tiny C
       library.  It supports most <b>gcc</b> options.

       Unlike <b>gcc</b>, <b>klcc</b> compiles with optimization on by default.   Furthermore,  the  optimization  level  used
       depends  on  whether  or not <b>-g</b> is specified, since <b>klcc</b> frequently uses options in the normal case which
       makes debugging impossible.  Therefore, compile without <b>-g</b>, <b>-O</b>, <b>-f</b>  or  <b>-m</b>  option  to  use  the  default
       optimization  level;  this  will  generally result in the smallest binaries.  You may want to use <b>-s</b> when
       linking, however.  Use <b>-O0</b> to compile without any optimization whatsoever; this may not work depending on
       the version of <b>gcc</b> used.

       <b>-nostdinc</b>
              allows to turn off klibc include files.

       Use the <b>-shared</b> or <b>-static</b> option to compile for and link against shared  or  static  klibc.   Note  that
       shared klibc only supports running against the exact same klibc binary as the binary was linked with.

       In  addition to standard <b>gcc</b> options, <b>klcc</b> supports options of the form <b>-print-klibc-</b><u>option</u>, which prints
       the corresponding klibc configuration option.
