</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>puttygen</b>  is  a tool to generate and manipulate SSH public and private key pairs. It is part of the PuTTY
       suite, although it can also interoperate with the key formats used by some other SSH clients.

       When you run <b>puttygen</b>, it does three things. Firstly, it either  loads  an  existing  key  file  (if  you
       specified  <u>keyfile</u>),  or  generates  a  new  key  (if  you  specified <u>keytype</u>). Then, it optionally makes
       modifications to the key (such as changing the comment and/or the passphrase); finally,  it  outputs  the
       key, or some information about the key, to a file.

       All three of these phases are controlled by the options described in the following section.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       In  the first phase, <b>puttygen</b> either loads or generates a key. Note that generating a key requires random
       data, which can cause <b>puttygen</b> to pause, possibly for some  time  if  your  system  does  not  have  much
       randomness available.

       The options to control this phase are:

       <u>keyfile</u>
              Specify a key file to be loaded. (Use `<b>-</b>' to read a key file from standard input.)

              Usually  this  will be a private key, which can be in the (de facto standard) SSH-1 key format, or
              in PuTTY's SSH-2 key format, or in either of the SSH-2 private key formats  used  by  OpenSSH  and
              ssh.com's implementation.

              You  can  also  specify  a  file  containing only a <u>public</u> key here. The operations you can do are
              limited to outputting another public key format (possibly removing an attached certificate first),
              or a fingerprint. Public keys can be in RFC 4716 or OpenSSH format, or the standard SSH-1 format.

       <b>-t</b> <u>keytype</u>
              Specify a type of key to generate. The acceptable values here are <b>rsa</b>, <b>dsa</b>, <b>ecdsa</b>, <b>eddsa</b>, <b>ed25519</b>,
              and <b>ed448</b> (to generate SSH-2 keys), and <b>rsa1</b> (to generate SSH-1 keys).

       <b>-b</b> <u>bits</u>
              Specify the size of the key to generate, in bits. Default for <b>rsa</b> and <b>dsa</b> keys is 2048.

       <b>--primes</b> <u>method</u>
              Method for generating prime numbers. The  acceptable  values  here  are  <b>probable</b>  (the  default),
              <b>proven</b>,  and  <b>proven-even</b>;  the later methods are slower. (Various synonyms for these method names
              are also accepted.)

              The `probable primes' method sounds unsafe, but  it's  the  most  commonly  used  prime-generation
              strategy. There is in theory a possibility that it might accidentally generate a number that isn't
              prime, but the software does enough checking to make that probability vanishingly small (less than
              1 in 2^80, or 1 in 10^24). So, in practice, nobody worries about it very much.

              The  other  methods  cause PuTTYgen to use numbers that it is <u>sure</u> are prime, because it generates
              the output number together with a  proof  of  its  primality.  This  takes  more  effort,  but  it
              eliminates that theoretical risk in the probabilistic method.

              You  might  choose  to switch from probable to proven primes if you have a local security standard
              that demands it, or if you don't trust the probabilistic argument for  the  safety  of  the  usual
              method.

       <b>--strong-rsa</b>
              When  generating an RSA key, make sure the prime factors of the key modulus are `strong primes'. A
              strong prime is a prime number chosen to have a particular structure that makes certain  factoring
              algorithms  more  difficult to apply, so some security standards recommend their use. However, the
              most modern factoring algorithms are unaffected, so this option is probably not worth  turning  on
              <u>unless</u> you have a local standard that recommends it.

       <b>-q</b>     Suppress the progress display when generating a new key.

       <b>--old-passphrase</b> <u>file</u>
              Specify  a  file  name; the first line will be read from this file (removing any trailing newline)
              and used as the old passphrase. <b>CAUTION:</b> If the passphrase is important, the file should be stored
              on a temporary filesystem or else securely erased after use.

       <b>--random-device</b> <u>device</u>
              Specify device to read entropy from. By default,  <b>puttygen</b>  uses  <b>/dev/urandom</b>,  falling  back  to
              <b>/dev/random</b> if it has to.

       In  the  second  phase,  <b>puttygen</b> optionally alters properties of the key it has loaded or generated. The
       options to control this are:

       <b>-C</b> <u>new-comment</u>
              Specify a comment string to describe the key. This  comment  string  will  be  used  by  PuTTY  to
              identify  the  key  to you (when asking you to enter the passphrase, for example, so that you know
              which passphrase to type).

       <b>-P</b>     Indicate that you want to change the key's passphrase. This is automatic when you are generating a
              new key, but not when you are modifying an existing key.

       <b>--certificate</b> <u>certificate-file</u>
              Adds an OpenSSH-style certificate to the public half of the key, so that the output file  contains
              a  certified  public  key  with  the  same  private  key.  If  the  input file already contained a
              certificate, it will be replaced with the new one. (Use `<b>-</b>' to read a  certificate  from  standard
              input.)

       <b>--remove-certificate</b>
              Removes  any  certificate  that  was  part  of  the key, to recover the uncertified version of the
              underlying key.

       <b>--reencrypt</b>
              For an existing private key saved with a passphrase, refresh the encryption without  changing  the
              passphrase.

              This  is  most  likely  to be useful with the <b>--ppk-param</b> option, to change some aspect of the key
              file's format or encryption.

       <b>--ppk-param</b> <u>key</u><b>=</b><u>value</u><b>,</b>...
              When saving a PPK file (the default <b>private</b> output type for SSH-2 keys), adjust details of the on-
              disk format.

              Aspects to change are specified as a series of <u>key</u><b>=</b><u>value</u> pairs separated by commas. The <u>key</u>s are:

              <b>version</b>
                     The PPK format version. Possible values are <b>3</b> (the default) and <b>2</b> (which is less  resistant
                     to  brute-force  decryption,  but  which you might need if your key needs to be used by old
                     versions of PuTTY tools, or other PPK consumers).

                     The following <u>key</u>s only affect PPK version 3 files.

              <b>kdf</b>    The variant of the Argon2 key derivation function to use. Options  are  <b>argon2id</b>  (default,
                     and recommended), <b>argon2i</b>, and <b>argon2d</b>.

                     You might change this if you consider your exposure to side-channel attacks to be different
                     to the norm.

              <b>memory</b> The amount of memory needed to decrypt the key, in Kbyte. Default is 8192 (i.e., 8 Mbyte).

              <b>time</b>   Approximate time, on this machine, required to attempt decrypting the key, in milliseconds.
                     Default is 100 (ms).

              <b>passes</b> Alternative  to  <b>time</b>:  explicitly  specify  the  number of hash passes required to attempt
                     decrypting the key.

              <b>parallelism</b>
                     Number of parallelisable threads that can be used to decrypt the key. Default is  1  (force
                     decryption to run single-threaded).

       In the third phase, <b>puttygen</b> saves the key or information about it. The options to control this are:

       <b>-O</b> <u>output-type</u>
              Specify the type of output you want <b>puttygen</b> to produce. Acceptable options are:

              <b>private</b>
                     Save  the  private  key in a format usable by PuTTY. This will either be the standard SSH-1
                     key format, or PuTTY's own SSH-2 key format (`PPK'). This is the default.

              <b>public</b> Save the public key only. For SSH-1 keys, the standard  public  key  format  will  be  used
                     (`<b>1024</b>  <b>37</b>  <b>5698745</b>...').  For  SSH-2  keys,  the  public  key will be output in the format
                     specified by RFC 4716, which is a multi-line text file beginning with the line `<b>----</b>  <b>BEGIN</b>
                     <b>SSH2</b> <b>PUBLIC</b> <b>KEY</b> <b>----</b>'.

              <b>public-openssh</b>
                     Save the public key only, in a format usable by OpenSSH. For SSH-1 keys, this output format
                     behaves identically to <b>public</b>. For SSH-2 keys, the public key will be output in the OpenSSH
                     format, which is a single line (`<b>ssh-rsa</b> <b>AAAAB3NzaC1yc2</b>...').

              <b>fingerprint</b>
                     Print  a fingerprint of the public key. The <b>-E</b> option lets you specify which fingerprinting
                     algorithm to use. All algorithms are believed compatible with OpenSSH.

              <b>private-openssh</b>
                     Save an SSH-2 private key in  OpenSSH's  format,  using  the  oldest  format  available  to
                     maximise backward compatibility. This option is not permitted for SSH-1 keys.

              <b>private-openssh-new</b>
                     As  <b>private-openssh</b>,  except that it forces the use of OpenSSH's newer format even for RSA,
                     DSA, and ECDSA keys.

              <b>private-sshcom</b>
                     Save an SSH-2 private key in ssh.com's format. This option is not permitted for SSH-1 keys.

              <b>cert-info</b>
                     Save a textual dump of information about the certificate on the key, if any: whether it's a
                     host or a user certificate, what host(s) or user(s) it's  certified  to  be,  its  validity
                     period, ID and serial number, and the fingerprint of the signing CA.

              <b>text</b>   Save  a  textual  dump  of  the  numeric components comprising the key (both the public and
                     private parts, if present). Useful for debugging, or for using PuTTYgen as a key  generator
                     for applications other than SSH.

                     The  output  consists  of a series of <b>name=value</b> lines, where each <b>value</b> is either a C-like
                     string literal in double quotes, a hexadecimal number starting with <b>0x...</b>, or a binary blob
                     encoded with base64, denoted by <b>b64("...")</b>.

              If no output type is specified, the default is <b>private</b>.

       <b>-o</b> <u>output-file</u>
              Specify the file where <b>puttygen</b> should write its output. If this option is not specified, <b>puttygen</b>
              will assume you want to overwrite the original file if the input and output  file  types  are  the
              same  (changing  a comment or passphrase), and will assume you want to output to stdout if you are
              asking for a public key, fingerprint, or one of the textual dump types. Otherwise, the  <b>-o</b>  option
              is required.

       <b>-l</b>     Synonym for `<b>-O</b> <b>fingerprint</b>'.

       <b>-L</b>     Synonym for `<b>-O</b> <b>public-openssh</b>'.

       <b>-p</b>     Synonym for `<b>-O</b> <b>public</b>'.

       <b>--cert-info</b>
              Synonym for `<b>-O</b> <b>cert-info</b>'.

       <b>--dump</b> Synonym for `<b>-O</b> <b>text</b>'.

       <b>-E</b> <u>fptype</u>
              Specify  the algorithm to use if generating a fingerprint. The available algorithms are are <b>sha256</b>
              (the default) and <b>md5</b>.

              By default, when showing the fingerprint of a public key that  includes  a  certificate,  <b>puttygen</b>
              will not include the certificate, so that the fingerprint shown will be the same as the underlying
              public  key. If you want the fingerprint including the certificate (for example, so as to tell two
              certified keys apart), you can specify <b>sha256-cert</b> or <b>md5-cert</b> as the fingerprint type.

       <b>--new-passphrase</b> <u>file</u>
              Specify a file name; the first line will be read from this file (removing  any  trailing  newline)
              and  used  as  the  new  passphrase.  If the file is empty then the saved key will be unencrypted.
              <b>CAUTION:</b> If the passphrase is important, the file should be stored on a  temporary  filesystem  or
              else securely erased after use.

       The following options do not run PuTTYgen as normal, but print informational messages and then quit:

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
              Display a message summarizing the available options.

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--version</b>
              Display the version of PuTTYgen.

       <b>--pgpfp</b>
              Display  the  fingerprints of the PuTTY PGP Master Keys, to aid in verifying new files released by
              the PuTTY team.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       To generate an SSH-2 RSA key pair and save it in PuTTY's  own  format  (you  will  be  prompted  for  the
       passphrase):

       puttygen -t rsa -C "my home key" -o mykey.ppk

       To generate a larger (4096-bit) key:

       puttygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "my home key" -o mykey.ppk

       To change the passphrase on a key (you will be prompted for the old and new passphrases):

       puttygen -P mykey.ppk

       To change the comment on a key:

       puttygen -C "new comment" mykey.ppk

       To convert a key into OpenSSH's private key format:

       puttygen mykey.ppk -O private-openssh -o my-openssh-key

       To convert a key <u>from</u> another format (<b>puttygen</b> will automatically detect the input key type):

       puttygen my-ssh.com-key -o mykey.ppk

       To  display  the  SHA-256  fingerprint of a key (some key types require a passphrase to extract even this
       much information):

       puttygen -l mykey.ppk

       To add the OpenSSH-format public half of a key to your authorised keys file:

       puttygen -L mykey.ppk &gt;&gt; $HOME/.ssh/authorized_keys
