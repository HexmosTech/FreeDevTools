</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       s3acl - Display or manipulate the ACL of AWS S3 buckets and items

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       s3acl [options] [[bucket|bucket/key] ...]

        Options:
          --access-key    AWS Access Key ID
          --secret-key    AWS Secret Access Key
          --get           Output the ACL to STDOUT
            --xml           in raw XML form instead of parsed form
          --set           Modify the ACL
            --clear                remove all grants from the ACL
            --add grant,grant,...  add grants to the ACL
            --del grant,grant,...  remove matching grants from the ACL
            --xml                  apply the XML ACL from STDIN to the item
            --acl-short cannedacl  apply the "canned" ACL to the item
        Environment:
          AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
          AWS_ACCESS_KEY_SECRET

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--help</b>  Print a brief help message and exits.

       <b>--man</b>   Prints the manual page and exits.

       <b>--verbose</b>
               Output what is being done as it is done.

       <b>--access-key</b> and <b>--secret-key</b>
               Specify  the  "AWS  Access Key Identifiers" for the AWS account.  <b>--access-key</b> is the "Access Key
               ID", and <b>--secret-key</b> is the "Secret Access Key".   These  are  effectively  the  "username"  and
               "password" to the AWS account, and should be kept confidential.

               The  access  keys  MUST  be  specified,  either  via  these  command  line parameters, or via the
               <b>AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID</b> and <b>AWS_ACCESS_KEY_SECRET</b> environment variables.

               Specifying them on the command line overrides the environment variables.

       <b>--secure</b>
               Uses SSL/TLS HTTPS to communicate with the AWS service, instead of HTTP.

       <b>--get</b>   Retrieve and display the ACL for each specified bucket or item.

       <b>--xml</b>   When used with the <b>--get</b> option, outputs to stdout the raw XML, instead of parsed  format.   This
               raw XML is documented in the "Amazon S3 Developer Guide".

               If  more  than one bucket or item is specified, the XML ACL for each will be output, concatenated
               together.  This is probably not very useful.

               The raw XML output can be used as input for the <b>--set</b> option, like so:

                 s3acl --get --xml bucketA | s3acl --set --xml bucketB bucketC

               This does not work when specifying more than one bucket or item to the <b>--get</b> option, because  the
               concatenation of multiple XML ACLs is not a valid XML ACL.

       <b>--set</b>   Instead  of  displaying  the ACL, modify it.  An ACL can be modified by using <b>--clear</b>, <b>--add</b>, and
               <b>--del</b>, or by using <b>--xml</b>, or by using <b>--acl-short</b>.

       <b>--clear</b> Removes all of the grants from the ACL.  This includes access by the owner of the bucket or item.
               This is done before the <b>--add</b> or <b>--del</b> options are applied, no  matter  what  order  options  are
               specified on the command line.

               It is usually accompanied by the <b>--add</b> option to add some grants back to the now empty ACL.

       <b>--del</b>   Remove  matching grants from the ACL.  This is done before the <b>--add</b> option is applied, no matter
               what order options are specified on the command line.

               Grants are specified in parsed form, and then joined together by commas with no whitespace.

               There is an extension to the parsed grant format. If the grantee is specified as "ANY",  then  it
               matches  any  and  all  grantees  in  the  ACL.  If the permission is specified as "ANY", then it
               matches any permission.  Thus

                 s3acl --set --del ANY:READ mybucket

               removes all grants that give READ permission, and

                 s3acl --set --del someuserid:ANY mybucket

               removes all grants to the user someuserid

                 s3acl --set --del ANY:ANY mybucket

               does the same thing as

                 s3acl --set --clear mybucket

               Due to a limitation in the semantics of the S3 API, it is not possible to  delete  a  grantee  by
               email address, only by canonical ID.

       <b>--add</b>   Add  the  specified  grants  to  the  ACL.   Grants are specified in parsed form, and then joined
               together by commas with no whitespace.

               It is possible to add the same grant to a bucket or item more than once.  This  is  a  surprising
               behavior of the S3 service.

       <b>--xml</b>   When used with <b>--set</b>, and instead of using &lt;--clear&gt;, &lt;--del&gt;, and <b>--add</b>, read a raw XML ACL from
               STDIN,  and  then  apply  it  to  each  given bucket or item.  This will completely overwrite the
               existing ACL for each given bucket or item.

       <b>--acl-short</b>
               Instead of using &lt;--clear&gt;, &lt;--del&gt;, and <b>--add</b>, or using &lt;--xml&gt;, apply a "canned  ACL"  to  each
               given  bucket  or item.  This will completely overwrite the existing ACL for each given bucket or
               item.

               The following canned ACLs are currently defined by S3:

               <b>private</b> Owner gets "FULL_CONTROL".  No one else has any access rights.  This is the  default  for
                       newly created buckets and items.

               <b>public-read</b>
                       Owner gets "FULL_CONTROL".  The anonymous principal is granted "READ" access.

               <b>public-read-write</b>
                       Owner gets "FULL_CONTROL".

                       The anonymous principal is granted "READ" and "WRITE" access.  This is a useful policy to
                       apply to a bucket, if you intend for any anonymous user to PUT objects into the bucket.

               <b>authenticated-read</b>
                       Owner  gets  "FULL_CONTROL" .  Any principal authenticated as a registered Amazon S3 user
                       is granted "READ" access.

       <b>bucket</b> or <b>bucket/key</b>
               One or more bucket names or bucket and key names, specifies an item.  As many as possible will be
               be processed.

               If just a bucket name is given, the ACL for that bucket is retrieved or modified.

               If a bucket name and a key, separated by a slash, is given, the ACL for that key in  that  bucket
               is retrieved or modified.

               If  a bucket name begins with one or more dashes, it might be mistaken for a command line option.
               If this is the case, separate the command line options from the bucket or bucket/key  names  with
               two dashes, like so:

                 s3acl --get -- --bucketname/keyname

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID</b> and <b>AWS_ACCESS_KEY_SECRET</b>
               Specify  the  "AWS  Access  Key Identifiers" for the AWS account.  <b>AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID</b> contains the
               "Access Key  ID",  and  <b>AWS_ACCESS_KEY_SECRET</b>  contains  the  "Secret  Access  Key".   These  are
               effectively the "username" and "password" to the AWS service, and should be kept confidential.

               The  access  keys  MUST  be  specified,  either  via  these  environment  variables,  or  via the
               <b>--access-key</b> and <b>--secret-key</b> command line parameters.

               If the command line parameters are set, they override these environment variables.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>FILE</b></h4><pre>
       The configuration options will be read from the file "<a href="file:~/.s3-tools">~/.s3-tools</a>" if it exists.  The format is the  same
       as the command line options with one option per line.  For example, the file could contain:

           --access-key &lt;AWS access key&gt;
           --secret-key &lt;AWS secret key&gt;
           --secure

       This  example  configuration  file  would  specify the AWS access keys and that a secure connection using
       HTTPS should be used for all communications.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Retrieves and outputs the Access Control List (ACL) of buckets and of items  in  buckets  in  the  Amazon
       Simple Storage Service (S3).

   <b>Principals</b>
       (Much of the following text is taken from the "Amazon S3 Developer Guide (API Version 2006-03-01)".)

       Every  bucket  and  item  has  an  Access  Control  List (ACL). When a request is made, S3 determines the
       principal making the request, and then checks the access  control  list  to  see  if  that  principal  is
       authorized  to  make  the  request.  If the ACL contains an entry authorizing that principal to make this
       request, the request is allowed to proceed, otherwise an error is returned.

       A principal may be someone with an AWS S3 account who has logged in, or "authenticated".   The  principal
       might  be  the  creator  and  owner  of the bucket or item.  Or the principal might be some anonymous web
       browser out on the internet.

   <b>ACL</b> <b>is</b> <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>grants.</b> <b>A</b> <b>grant</b> <b>is</b> <b>1</b> <b>grantee</b> <b>and</b> <b>1</b> <b>permission.</b>
       An access control list is a sequence of grants. It may contain up to 100 grants. A grant is  composed  of
       one  grantee,  which  is  a  description of the principal who will be allowed access, and one permission,
       which is a description of what that principal is allowed to do with that bucket or item.

   <b>User</b> <b>Grantee</b>
       A user grantee must be registered as an Amazon.com customer, but does not have to be registered as an AWS
       customer.

       When an ACL is read, the user grantee will be displayed in a canonical format, which consists of  64  hex
       characters.   The  exception is if the grantee is the owner.  Amazon still stores and returns the grantee
       in canonical form, but this tool displays it as "OWNER".

   <b>Group</b> <b>Grantee</b>
       The only groups available are those pre-defined by S3.  In the current release of S3, you  cannot  create
       your own group.  There are currently two pre-defined groups.

       The  first  is represented by the string "WORLD" by this tool. All principals, whether they are anonymous
       or authenticated, are considered part of this group.

       The second is represented by  the  string  "USERS"  by  this  tool.   Every  non-anonymous  principal  is
       considered  part  of the group. Note that permission granted by virtue of this grant does not trump other
       access control considerations. For example, if a user is registered with AWS, they may be  part  of  this
       group, but if they have not subscribed to S3, they will still not be granted access.

       There  is  also  a  special  pseudo group with the string "ANY".  It is used by the <b>--del</b> option to match
       against a ACL item to select for deletion.

       If Amazon updates S3 to define  any  additional  groups  before  this  tool  is  updated,  they  will  be
       represented as a URI surrounded by angle brackets.

   <b>Owner</b>
       Every  bucket  and  item in S3 has an owner attribute associated with it. The owner the user that created
       the bucket or item. The only way to change the owner of a bucket is to delete the bucket  and  create  it
       again  under  a  different user identity. The only way to change the owner of an item is to overwrite the
       item using a different identity.

       The owner of a bucket or item is subject to the access control policy of that bucket or  item  just  like
       everybody  else,  with two notable exceptions: The owner of a resource always has the ability to read and
       write the ACL of that resource, no matter what the associated ACL says. For example, as the owner  of  an
       item,  you could remove yourself from the associated access control list, and find that you can no longer
       read the item's data and metadata. However, by virtue of being owner, you always have the  right  to  re-
       grant  yourself  permissions  to it. This policy prevents the situation where an item becomes "stranded,"
       with nobody able to ever modify or even delete it.

   <b>Permissions</b>
       The permission in a grant describes the type of access to be  granted  to  the  respective  grantee.  The
       following permissions are supported:

       READ    When  applied  to  a  bucket, this grants permission to list the bucket. When applied to an item,
               this grants permission to read the item data and/or metadata.

       WRITE   When applied to a bucket, this grants permission to create, overwrite, and delete any item in the
               bucket. This permission is not supported for items (it is reserved for future use).

       READ_ACP
               Grants permission to read the access control policy (ACL and owner) for the applicable bucket  or
               item. The owner of a bucket or item always has this permission implicitly.

       WRITE_ACP
               Grants  permission  to overwrite the ACP for the applicable bucket or item. The owner of a bucket
               or item always has this permission implicitly. Note that granting this permission  is  equivalent
               to  granting  FULL_CONTROL,  because the grant recipient can now make any whatever changes to the
               ACP he or she likes!

       FULL_CONTROL
               This permission is short-hand for the union of READ, WRITE, READ_ACP, and WRITE_ACP  permissions.
               It  does  not  convey  additional  rights,  and is provided only for convenience.  It is probably
               unwise to give this permission to WORLD.

       ANY     This is not really a permission, but is used by the <b>--del</b> option.  It matches any  permission  to
               select a grant for deletion.

   <b>Default</b> <b>ACL</b>
       If  no  ACL is provided at the time a bucket is created or an item written then a default ACL is created.
       The default ACL for new resources consists of a single grant that gives the owner of the  resource  (i.e.
       the principal making the request to create the bucket or to write the item) FULL_CONTROL permission. Note
       that  if you overwrite an existing item, the ACL for the existing item is always overwritten as well, and
       defaulted back to OWNER:FULL_CONTROL if no explicit ACL is provided.

   <b>Raw</b> <b>XML</b> <b>ACL</b> <b>Format</b>
       The XML ACL format is documented in the "Amazon S3 Developer Guide".

   <b>Parsed</b> <b>ACL</b> <b>Format</b>
       This tool parses the raw XML ACL format into a more readable form.

       A parsed ACL consists of several lines.  Comments are lines that begin with a hash character.  Lines that
       are not comments are grants.

       For buckets, the comments give the bucket name, and the Amazon canonical user string for the owner.

       For items, the comments give the bucket name, the item key, and the Amazon canonical user string for  the
       owner.

       A  grant  is  grantee string and a permission string, separated with a colon character.  A grantee can be
       one of the strings "OWNER", "WORLD", or "USERS", or a URI wrapped in angle brackets, or the email address
       of an Amazon user, or a Amazon canonical user string, which is 64 hex characters.  A permission is one of
       the strings "READ", "WRITE", "READ_ACP", "WRITE_ACP", or "FULL_CONTROL".

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Report bugs to Mark Atwood <a href="mailto:mark@fallenpegasus.com">mark@fallenpegasus.com</a>.

       Occasionally the S3 service will randomly fail for no externally apparent  reason.   When  that  happens,
       this tool should retry, with a delay and a backoff.

       Access  to  the  S3 service can be authenticated with a X.509 certificate, instead of via the "AWS Access
       Key Identifiers".  This tool should support that.

       It might be useful to be able to specify the "AWS Access Key Identifiers" in the user's "<a href="file:~/.netrc">~/.netrc</a>"  file.
       This tool should support that.

       Errors and warnings are very "Perl-ish", and can be confusing.

       Trying  to  access  a  bucket or item that does not exist or is not accessible by the user generates less
       than helpful error messages.

       Net::Amazon::S3 already uses XML::LibXML and XML::LibXML::XPathContext, so this  tool  should  use  those
       instead of using XML::Writer, to have fewer module dependences.

       It  is  possible to add the same grant to a bucket or item more than once.  This is a surprising behavior
       of the S3 service.  Both identical grants will be removed by using the <b>--del</b> option.

       Due to a limitation in the semantics of the S3 API, it is not possible  to  delete  a  grantee  by  email
       address, only by canonical ID.
