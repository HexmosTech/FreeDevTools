       otp - generate one-time key pads or password lists

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>otp</b> [ <b>-c</b><u>chars</u> <b>-d</b><u>digits</u> <b>-e</b><u>chars</u> <b>-l</b><u>chars</u> <b>-m</b><u>sigfile</u> <b>-n</b><u>nkeys</u> <b>-r</b><u>seed</u> <b>-s</b><u>nchars</u> <b>-u</b> <b>-w</b><u>linelen</u> <u>outfile</u> ]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Systems  which  use  passwords and/or encryption keys to authenticate an individual's identity or protect
       against interception of communications achieve the highest degree of security when each password  or  key
       is  used <u>only</u> <u>once</u>.  Spies are furnished ``one-time pads'' containing pages of keys used to encrypt indi‐
       vidual characters of secret messages, then discarded.  As long as the physical security of the two copies
       of a one-time pad is assured and the keys on the pad are sufficiently random, security is absolute.

       Swiss banks which accept electronic payment orders use a similar mechanism to verify the identity of  the
       issuer of an order.  When a client authorises the bank to accept electronic orders, the bank delivers, by
       registered mail, a list of individual session passwords (usually numbers of 4 to 6 digits).  The customer
       agrees  to  keep the list of passwords physically secure, and to not hold the bank liable if the customer
       allows the list to fall into unauthorised hands.  Each time an order is given, in addition to the regular
       user identity and password, the next key from the list must be entered, and then crossed off by the user.
       The bank verifies the key against a copy of the list stored in their own secure computer, and only if the
       key matches is the order accepted.  Multiple incorrect entries block electronic access to the  customer's
       account  until re-enabled by the customer providing suitable verification that an unauthorised access at‐
       tempt did not, in fact, occur.

       Note that even if the customer's entire communication session with the bank is  intercepted,  the  eaves‐
       dropper  will not be able to subsequently issue orders in the customer's name since the one-time password
       used in the compromised session will never be used again, and provides no usable clue  as  to  subsequent
       one-time passwords.

       <b>otp</b>  creates key and password lists for verification and security purposes in a variety of formats.  Keys
       can be of any length, consist of digits or letters (capital or lower case), and alphabetic passwords  can
       either  be entirely random (most secure) or obey the digraph statistics of English text (easier to remem‐
       ber when transcribing, but less secure).

       For computer applications, for example one-time login passwords, <b>otp</b> can create a file containing the MD5
       signature of each of the generated keys.  This permits the computer to verify keys without  the  need  to
       store  the  keys in plaintext.  As noted below, this improves security only if keys are sufficiently long
       to deter exhaustive search for their signatures.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-c</b><u>chars</u>     Generate keys consisting of <u>chars</u> (default 8) capital letters.  The keys  consist  of  random
                   letters  unless  the <b>-e</b> option is also specified, in which case they obey the digraph statis‐
                   tics of English text.

       <b>-d</b><u>digits</u>    Generate keys consisting of <u>digits</u> (default 8) decimal digits.

       <b>-e</b><u>chars</u>     Generate keys consisting of <u>chars</u> (default 8) letters which obey the  digraph  statistics  of
                   English  text.  Such keys are usually easier to remember when transcribing from a printed pad
                   to a computer, but are less secure than entirely random sequences of letters.   Keys  default
                   to lower case letters; specify the <b>-c</b> option along with <b>-e</b> if you prefer capital letters.

       <b>-l</b><u>chars</u>     Generate keys consisting of <u>chars</u> (default 8) lower case letters.  The keys consist of random
                   letters  unless  the <b>-e</b> option is also specified, in which case they obey the digraph statis‐
                   tics of English text.

       <b>-m</b><u>sigfile</u>   A file <u>sigfile</u> is written which contains the MD5 signature of each  of  the  generated  keys,
                   with  each  128 bit signature written as 32 hexadecimal digits on a line by itself.  Computer
                   applications can use this signature file for verification  when  the  user  supplies  a  key,
                   rather  than storing a copy of the keys as plaintext.  Note that if the MD5 signature file is
                   compromised, short keys are still vulnerable since their MD5 signatures can be found  by  ex‐
                   haustive search.

       <b>-n</b><u>nkeys</u>     Generate <u>nkeys</u> keys.  By default, 50 keys are generated.

       <b>-r</b><u>seed</u>      The string <u>seed</u> is used to initialise the random number generator.  Every run of <b>otp</b> with the
                   same  seed  will  produce the same output.  This is primarily useful for testing, but it also
                   allows users at different locations to produce identical sheets given only a  seed  known  to
                   both.   If  you're  about  to  use up all the keys on a sheet, you can generate a new pair of
                   sheets by using the last key on the sheet as the seed for a new one.  (This is not as  secure
                   as  physically  exchanging a new pair of sheets, but if you're about to run out of keys, it's
                   better than nothing.)  If the <b>-r</b> option is not specified, the generator is initialised with a
                   value derived from the date and time and various system  environment  information;  each  run
                   will produce a different sheet.

       <b>-s</b><u>nchars</u>    Include  a  hyphen separator every <u>nchars</u> characters in the keys.  Breaking up long keys into
                   segments with separators makes them easier to transcribe.  By default, a hyphen  is  inserted
                   every 4 characters.

       <b>-u</b>          Print how-to-call information.

       <b>-w</b><u>linelen</u>   Format  output  so lines are less than or equal to <u>linelen</u> characters (unless individual keys
                   exceed the line length).  The default line length is 79 characters.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       If no <u>outfile</u> is specified, output is written on standard output.

</pre><h4><b>APPLICATION</b> <b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       If you're using <b>otp</b>-generated keys for computer system passwords, it's wise to include one or  more  non-
       alphanumeric  characters and to mix upper and lower case letters; this makes your password much more dif‐
       ficult to guess by exhaustive search.  For example, if <b>otp</b> generated a password of <b>jxuc-uiuf</b>  and  you're
       using  a  system  on which passwords are limited to 8 characters, you might actually use <b>jXu&amp;uIU=</b> as your
       password.

       When using one-time keys to communicate with other people, it's often a good idea to supply both the cur‐
       rent session key and the key for the previous session.  It's easy to forget to cross off a key after  us‐
       ing it; including the previous key makes it easier to discover if this has happened and get back in sync.
       Similarly,  in computer-based authentication systems it's a good idea to respond to entry of an incorrect
       key by prompting the user with the key from the last session.

       Pseudorandom numbers on which entries in the pads are based are generated by  the  exclusive-or  of  four
       concurrently-running  BSD  <b>random</b>() generators, each with 256 bytes of state, independently seeded from 4
       byte segments of the 16-byte MD5 signature of the original seed.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>otp</b> returns status 0 if processing was completed without errors, and 2 if an error  prevented  generation
       of output.

</pre><h4><b>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       The  English-digraph  frequency key generator is based on the ``mpw'' program developed at MIT, which was
       converted from Multics PL/I to C by Bill Sommerfeld, 4/21/86.  The original PL/I version was provided  by
       Jerry Saltzer.

       The  implementation  of MD5 message-digest algorithm is based on a public domain version written by Colin
       Plumb in 1993.  The algorithm is due to Ron Rivest.  The algorithm is described in Internet RFC 1321.
