       ccguess - search for ccrypt encryption keys

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ccguess</b> <b>[</b><u>options</u><b>]</b> <u>file</u><b>...</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>ccguess</b> program attempts to guess <b><a href="../man1/ccrypt.1.html">ccrypt</a></b>(1) encryption keys by searching the relevant part of the key
       space.  This is done by prompting the user for an <u>approximate</u> <u>key</u> and then trying many variations of this
       key. This is intended to assist <b>ccrypt</b> users in recovering mistyped or forgotten keys, provided that they
       remember at least part of the key.

       Note that <b>ccrypt</b> provides strong cryptographic security: there are no special back doors or shortcuts  to
       recovering  forgotten  keys.  Therefore,  the <b>ccguess</b> program does not have any special powers. It simply
       works by trying different keys until a possible match is found.

       A search of the entire key space is not usually a practical option.  <b>ccguess</b> therefore works by prompting
       the user for an approximate key. It then tries all variations that can be obtained by  applying  a  small
       number  of  changes.  Here, each change is either a deletion of one letter, an insertion of one letter, a
       replacement of one letter by another, or a transposition of two adjacent  letters.  By  default,  <b>ccguess</b>
       searches all keys that differ from the approximate key by up to 5 changes. The number of changes searched
       can be adjusted with the <b>--depth</b> option.

       The mechanism by which <b>ccguess</b> determines whether a key is a "possible match" is the same as that used by
       <b>ccrypt</b>  to  reject  non-matching decryption keys. There is a small chance of a false match, i.e., <b>ccguess</b>
       may find a key that turns out not to be the true encryption key and does not decrypt the file  correctly.
       A  false match happens approximately once for every 4.3 billion keywords tried, so the longer your search
       goes on, the higher the likelihood that a false match is found. Normally, <b>ccguess</b> stops after  the  first
       possible  match is found, but the <b>-c</b> option can be used to search for additional keys. The possibility of
       a false match can be further reduced by supplying multiple files that have been encrypted with  the  same
       key. In this case, <b>ccguess</b> will search for keys that match <u>any</u> of the files, but will print a warning for
       keys that do not match <u>all</u> of the files.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The following options are supported:

       <b>-h,</b> <b>--help</b>
                 Help. Print usage information and exit.

       <b>-L,</b> <b>--license</b>
                 Print license info and exit.

       <b>-V,</b> <b>--version</b>
                 Print version info and exit.

       <b>-K</b> <u>key</u><b>,</b> <b>--key</b> <u>key</u>
                 Specify the approximate key on the command line, rather than prompting the user for it.

       <b>-d</b> <u>n</u><b>,</b> <b>--depth</b> <u>n</u>
                 Search keys that contain up to <u>n</u> changes. The default is 5.

       <b>-c,</b> <b>--continue</b>
                 Keep  trying more keys even after the first match is found. By default, <b>ccguess</b> will stop after
                 the first key is found that matches all input files.

       <b>-t</b> <u>chars</u><b>,</b> <b>--chartable</b> <u>chars</u>
                 Specify the list of characters to try for replacements and insertions. By default, <b>ccguess</b> will
                 try all printable ASCII characters. If you know, for example, that your key only used lowercase
                 letters and numbers, you can speed up the search by specifying a list of characters explicitly.
                 This option is mutually exclusive with <b>-n</b>.

       <b>-n,</b> <b>--non-printable</b>
                 Allow non-printable characters in keys. By default,  <b>ccguess</b>  will  only  try  printable  ASCII
                 characters.  Note  that the use of this option slows down the search significantly. This option
                 is mutually exclusive with <b>-t</b>.

</pre><h4><b>ARGUMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>file</u>      The name of a file that has been encrypted with the unknown key. This file is only  read  from,
                 not written to. The special filename "-" is used to denote standard input.

                 If  multiple files are specified, <b>ccguess</b> will search for keys that match <u>any</u> of the files, but
                 will print a warning for keys that do not match <u>all</u> of the files.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLE</b></h4><pre>
       Suppose the file <u>myfile.cpt</u> has been encrypted  with  the  key  "gardenhouse",  but  the  user  remembers
       "gardenhose". The command

          ccguess -K gardenhose myfile.cpt

       will find the correct key after 2318 guesses.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       The  exit  status  is 0 if at least one possible match is found, 1 if no matches are found, and &gt;=2 if an
       error occurred.

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       1.11
