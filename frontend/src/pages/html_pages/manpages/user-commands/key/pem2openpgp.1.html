       pem2openpgp — translate PEM-encoded RSA keys to OpenPGP certificates

       <b>pem2openpgp</b> <b>$USERID</b> <b>&lt;</b> <b>mykey.pem</b> | <b>gpg</b> <b>--import</b>

       <b>PEM2OPENPGP_EXPIRATION=$((86400</b>   <b>*</b>   <b>$DAYS))</b>   <b>PEM2OPENPGP_USAGE_FLAGS=authenticate,certify</b>  <b>pem2openpgp</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       is a low-level  utility  for  transforming  raw,  PEM-encoded  RSA  secret  keys  into  OpenPGP-formatted
       certificates.   The  generated  certificates  include  the secret key material, so they should be handled
       carefully.

       It works as an element within a pipeline: feed it the raw key on stdin, supply the desired User ID  as  a
       command  line  argument.   Note  that you may need to quote the string to ensure that it is entirely in a
       single argument.

       Other choices about how to generate the new OpenPGP certificate are governed by environment variables.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       The following environment variables influence the behavior of :

   <b>PEM2OPENPGP_TIMESTAMP</b> controls the timestamp (measured in seconds since the  UNIX  epoch)  indicated  as  the
       creation  time  (a.k.a  "not  valid  before")  of  the generated certificate (self-signature) and the key
       itself.  By default, uses the current time.

   <b>PEM2OPENPGP_KEY_TIMESTAMP</b> controls the timestamp (measured in seconds since the UNIX epoch) indicated as  the
       creation  time  of  just  the  key  itself  (not  the  self-signature).   By default, uses the value from
       PEM2OPENPGP_TIMESTAMP.

   <b>PEM2OPENPGP_USAGE_FLAGS</b> should contain a comma-separated list of  valid  OpenPGP  usage  flags  (see  section
       5.2.3.21  of  RFC  4880  for  what these mean).  The available choices are: certify, sign, encrypt_comms,
       encrypt_storage, encrypt (this  means  both  encrypt_comms  and  encrypt_storage),  authenticate,  split,
       shared.  By default, only sets the certify flag.

   <b>PEM2OPENPGP_EXPIRATION</b>  sets  an  expiration (measured in seconds after the creation time of the key) in each
       self-signature packet.  By default, no expiration subpacket is included.

   <b>PEM2OPENPGP_NEWKEY</b> indicates that should ignore stdin, and instead generate a new key  internally  and  build
       the certificate based on this new key.  Set this variable to the number of bits for the new RSA key (e.g.
       3072).  By default (when this is unset), will read the key from stdin.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Only handles RSA keys at the moment.  It might be nice to handle DSA keys as well.

       Currently  only  creates  certificates with a single User ID.  Should be able to create certificates with
       multiple User IDs.

       Currently only accepts unencrypted RSA keys.  It should  be  able  to  deal  with  passphrase-locked  key
       material.

       Currently  outputs  OpenPGP certificates with cleartext secret key material.  It would be good to be able
       to lock the output with a passphrase.
