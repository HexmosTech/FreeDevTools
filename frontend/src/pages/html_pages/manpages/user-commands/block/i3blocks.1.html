</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       i3blocks - A flexible scheduler for your i3bar blocks

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       i3blocks [<u>options</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>i3blocks</b>  allows  one  to  easily  describe  blocks  in  a  simple format, and generate a status line for
       <a href="../man1/i3bar.1.html">i3bar</a>(1).  It handles clicks, signals and time interval for user scripts.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-c</b>     Specifies an alternate configuration file path.  By  default,  i3blocks  looks  for  configuration
              files in the following order (note that <a href="file:/etc">/etc</a> may be prefixed with <a href="file:/usr/local">/usr/local</a> depending on the com‐
              pilation flags):

                     1. <a href="file:~/.config/i3blocks/config">~/.config/i3blocks/config</a> (or $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/i3blocks/config if set)
                     2. <a href="file:~/.i3blocks.conf">~/.i3blocks.conf</a>
                     3. /etc/xdg/i3blocks/config (or $XDG_CONFIG_DIRS/i3blocks/config if set)
                     4. /etc/i3blocks.conf

       <b>-v</b>     Log  level.   This  option  is  cumulative.   By  default, error messages are displayed on stderr.
              Passed once, a failure during an update is shown within the block.  Passed twice enables the debug
              messages on stderr.

       <b>-V</b>     Print the version and exit.

       <b>-h</b>     Print the help message and exit.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       The configuration file is an ini file.  Each section describes a new block.  A line beginning  with  a  #
       sign  is  a comment, and empty lines are ignored.  A property is a key=value pair per line, with no space
       around the equal sign.  Properties declared outside a block (i.e.  at the beginning of the file) describe
       global settings.

       Here is an example config file:

              # This is a comment
              interval=5
              color=#00FF00

              [weather]
              command=<a href="file:~/bin/weather.pl">~/bin/weather.pl</a>
              interval=1800

              [time]
              command=date +%T

       To use i3blocks as your status line, define it in a <u>bar</u> block of your <a href="file:~/i3/config">~/i3/config</a> file:

              bar {
                status_command i3blocks
              }

</pre><h4><b>BLOCK</b></h4><pre>
       The  properties  used  to  describe  a  block  are   the   keys   specified   in   the   i3bar   protocol
       <a href="http://i3wm.org/docs/i3bar-protocol.html">http://i3wm.org/docs/i3bar-protocol.html</a>  ,  plus additional properties used by <b>i3blocks</b> to describe when
       and how to update a block.  All the supported properties are described below.

       The following keys are standard, see <a href="http://i3wm.org/docs/i3bar-protocol.html">http://i3wm.org/docs/i3bar-protocol.html</a> for details.

       • full_text

       • short_text

       • color

       • min_width

       • align

       • name

       • instance

       • urgent

       • separator

       • separator_block_width

       • markup

       The following keys are specific to <b>i3blocks</b>.

       <b>command</b>
              The command executed by a shell, used to update the block.  The expected behavior is described be‐
              low, in the <b>COMMAND</b> section.

       <b>interval</b>
              If it is a positive integer, then the block is spawned on startup and the value is used as a  time
              interval  in seconds to schedule future updates.  If unspecified or 0, the block won't be executed
              on startup (which is useful to simulate buttons).

              If "<u>once</u>" (or -1), the block will be executed only on startup (note that a click  or  signal  will
              still trigger an update).

              If "<u>repeat</u>" (or -2), the block will be spawned on startup, and as soon as it terminates (useful to
              repeat blocking commands).  Use with caution!

              If  "<u>persist</u>"  (or -3), the block will be executed only on startup, and updated as soon as it out‐
              puts a line.  Thus limited to single line updates.

       <b>signal</b> The signal number used to update the block.  All the real-time (think prioritized  and  queueable)
              signals are available to the user.  The number is valid between 1 and N, where SIGRTMIN+N = SIGRT‐
              MAX.   (Note:  there  are  31 real-time signals in Linux.) For instance, signal=10 means that this
              block will be updated when <b>i3blocks</b> receives SIGRTMIN+10.

       <b>label</b>  An optional label to preprend to the full_text after an update.

       <b>format</b> This property specifies the format of the output text.  The default format is plain text,  as  de‐
              scribed in the <b>COMMAND</b> section.  If "json" (or 1) is used, the block output is parsed as JSON.

</pre><h4><b>COMMAND</b></h4><pre>
       The value of the command key will be passed and executed as is by a shell.

       The  standard output of the command line is used to update the block content.  Each non-empty line of the
       output will overwrite the corresponding property:

       1. full_text

       2. short_text

       3. color

       For example, this script sets the full_text in blue but no short_text:

              echo "Here's my label"
              echo
              echo \#0000FF

       If the command line returns 0 or 33, the block is updated.  Otherwise, it is considered a failure and the
       first line (if any) is still displayed.  Note that stderr is ignored.  A return code of 33 will  set  the
       urgent flag to true.

       For example, this script prints the battery percentage and sets the urgent flag if it is below 10%:

              BAT=`acpi -b | grep -E -o '[0-9][0-9]?%'`
              echo "BAT: $BAT"
              test ${BAT%?} -le 10 &amp;&amp; exit 33 || exit 0

       When forking a block command, <b>i3blocks</b> will set the environment with some BLOCK_* variables.  The follow‐
       ing variables are always provided, with eventually an empty string as the value.

       <b>BLOCK_NAME</b>
              The name of the block (usually the section name).

       <b>BLOCK_INSTANCE</b>
              An optional argument to the script.

       <b>BLOCK_BUTTON</b>
              Mouse button (1, 2 or 3) if the block was clicked.

       <b>BLOCK_X</b> <b>and</b> <b>BLOCK_Y</b>
              Coordinates where the click occurred, if the block was clicked.

       Here is an example using the environment:

              [block]
              command=echo name=$BLOCK_NAME instance=$BLOCK_INSTANCE
              interval=1

              [clickme]
              full_text=Click me!
              command=echo button=$BLOCK_BUTTON x=$BLOCK_X y=$BLOCK_Y
              min_width=button=1 x=1366 y=768
              align=left

       Note  that  <b>i3blocks</b>  provides a set of optional scripts for convenience, such as network status, battery
       check, cpu load, volume, etc.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       As an example, here is a close configuration to <a href="../man1/i3status.1.html">i3status</a>(1) default settings:

       <b>TODO</b>

              interval=5
              signal=10

              [ipv6]

              [free]

              [dhcp]

              [vpn]

              [wifi]

              [ethernet]
              min_width=E: 255.255.255.255 (1000 Mbit/s)

              [battery]

              [cpu]

              [datetime]

       The following block shows the usage of signal with some <a href="../man1/i3.1.html">i3</a>(1) bindings which adjust  the  volume,  before
       issuing a pkill -RTMIN+1 i3blocks:

              [volume]
              command=echo -n 'Volume: '; amixer get Master | grep -E -o '[0-9][0-9]?%'
              interval=once
              signal=1
              # no interval, only check on SIGRTMIN+1

       Here  is an example of a very minimalist config, assuming you have a bunch of scripts under <a href="file:~/bin/blocks/">~/bin/blocks/</a>
       with the same name as the blocks:

              command=<a href="file:~/bin/blocks/">~/bin/blocks/</a>$BLOCK_NAME
              interval=1

              [free]
              [wifi]
              [ethernet]
              [battery]
              [cpu]
              [datetime]
