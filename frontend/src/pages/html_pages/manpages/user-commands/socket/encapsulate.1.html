       encapsulate  -  multiplex  several  channels  over  a  single socket with sampling of remote process exit
       status, and provide conversation termination without closing the socket.

       netpipes 4.2

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>encapsulate</b> <b>--fd</b> <u>n</u> [ <b>--verbose</b> ] [ <b>--subproc</b> [ <b>--infd</b> <u>n</u>[<b>=</b><u>sid</u>] ] [ <b>--outfd</b> <u>n</u>[<b>=</b><u>sid</u>] ] [ <b>--duplex</b> <u>n</u>[<b>=</b><u>sid</u>]  ]

       <u>...</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>encapsulate</b>  implements  the Session Control Protocol (SCP) in a limited manner.  <b>encapsulate</b> multiplexes
       several virtual channels over a single socket using SCP.  <b>encapsulate</b> transmits the exit  status  of  the
       local  program  to  the  remote end over a reserved SCP channel and receives the remote exit status back.
       <b>encapsulate</b> provides conversation boundaries without closing the socket.

       Flags may appear in any order.  The first argument that isn't a flag is the command  to  spawn  (assuming
       <b>--subproc</b> is specified, an error otherwise).

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--fd</b> <u>n</u>, <b>-#</b><u>n</u> : specify the file descriptor of the socket we will be multiplexing subprocess channels over.
       This argument is required

       <b>--verbose</b>, <b>-v</b> : Print extra information (including a copyright notice) to stderr.

       <b>--subproc</b>, <b>-s</b> : spawn a subprocess.  You must supply a <u>command</u> and <u>args</u>.  If you omit this flag, then you
       must  <b>not</b> supply a <u>command</u> and <u>args</u>.  If you omit this flag, <b>encapsulate</b> will copy input from stdin to an
       outgoing channel in the SCP-muxed socket and copy to stdout from an incoming  channel  in  the  SCP-muxed
       socket.  If you omit this flag, all of the input and output channel flags are illegal.

       <b>--infd</b>  <u>n</u>,  <b>-i</b><u>n</u>  :  specify  an  input  channel.   If there is a subprocess, it will be able to read from
       descriptor <u>n</u>.  If there is no subprocess <b>encapsulate</b> will read from its descriptor <u>n</u> (these are  opposite
       polarities for the SCP channel).

       <b>--outfd</b>  <u>n</u>,  <b>-o</b><u>n</u>  :  specify  an  output  channel.  If there is a subprocess, it will be able to write to
       descriptor <u>n</u>.  If there is no subprocess <b>encapsulate</b> will write to its descriptor <u>n</u> (these  are  opposite
       polarities for the SCP channel).

       <b>--duplex</b> <u>n</u>, <b>-io</b><u>n</u> : specify a bidirectional channel.  The remote <b>encapsulate</b> will send the SCP SYN packet,
       and  the  local  will  respond  with a SYN for the same session.  The subprocess will be able to read and
       write to file descriptor <u>n</u>.  The subprocess should use the <b><a href="../man1/sockdown.1.html">sockdown</a></b>(1)  program  if  it  must  close  one
       direction while leaving the other direction open.

       <b>--Duplex</b>  <u>n</u>, <b>-d</b><u>n</u> : specify a bidirectional channel.  The <b>--client</b> end of the <b>encapsulate</b> connection sends
       the SCP SYN packet and <b>--server</b> responds with a SYN for the same session.  The subprocess will be able to
       read and write to file descriptor <u>n</u>.  The subprocess should use the <b><a href="../man1/sockdown.1.html">sockdown</a></b>(1) program if it must  close
       one direction while leaving the other direction open.

       <b>--DUPLEX</b>  <u>n</u>, <b>-oi</b><u>n</u> : specify a bidirectional channel.  The local <b>encapsulate</b> will send the SCP SYN packet,
       and the remote will respond with a SYN for the same session.  The subprocess will be  able  to  read  and
       write  to  file  descriptor  <u>n</u>.   The  subprocess should use the <b><a href="../man1/sockdown.1.html">sockdown</a></b>(1) program if it must close one
       direction while leaving the other direction open.

       All of the long forms of the bidirectional channel have an optional <b>=</b><u>sid</u> component that can  be  used  to
       specify  the  SCP Session ID.  This is not very useful when connecting encapsulate to another instance of
       itself, but could be handy when connecting to another piece of software that implements SCP.

       <b>--prefer-local</b>, <b>-l</b> : if both the remote and local subprocesses  exit  with  non-zero  (erroneous)  codes,
       <b>encapsulate</b> will exit with the same code as the local subprocess.  <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>default.</b>

       <b>--prefer-remote</b>,  <b>-r</b>  :  if  both the remote and local subprocesses exit with non-zero (erroneous) codes,
       <b>encapsulate</b> will exit with the same code as the remote subprocess.

       <b>--local-only</b>, <b>-L</b> : <b>encapsulate</b> exits with the local status and ignores the remote status.

       <b>--remote-only</b>, <b>-R</b> : <b>encapsulate</b> exits with the remote status and ignores the local status.

</pre><h4><b>SESSION</b> <b>IDs</b> <b>AND</b> <b>SUBPROCESS</b> <b>CHANNELS</b></h4><pre>
       When specifying channels for the subprocess, the order of the flags is very important.  Every flag to the
       local <b>encapsulate</b> must have a corresponding flag on the remote <b>encapsulate</b> that  is  in  the  exact  same
       position  (in  the  list  of channels).  The descriptor numbers need not correspond, but the position and
       type of each channel must.

       A lamentably complicating factor is that the data flow implied by <b>--infd</b> and <b>--outfd</b> are  different  when
       you specify a subprocess.

       Local                  Remote
       <b>--infd</b> w/subproc       <b>--outfd</b> w/subproc
       <b>--infd</b> w/subproc       <b>--infd</b>
       <b>--infd</b>                 <b>--infd</b> w/subproc
       <b>--infd</b>                 <b>--outfd</b>
       <b>--outfd</b> w/subproc      <b>--infd</b> w/subproc
       <b>--outfd</b> w/subproc      <b>--outfd</b>
       <b>--outfd</b>                <b>--outfd</b> w/subproc
       <b>--outfd</b>                <b>--infd</b>
       <b>--duplex</b>               <b>--DUPLEX</b>
       <b>--Duplex</b>               <b>--Duplex</b>
       <b>--DUPLEX</b>               <b>--duplex</b>

       RIGHT:

       l$ encapsulate --infd 0 --duplex 5
       r$ encapsulate --outfd 1 --DUPLEX 5

       WRONG:

       l$ encapsulate --infd 0 --duplex 5
       r$ encapsulate --outfd 1 --duplex 5

       <b>--duplex</b> must have a corresponding <b>--DUPLEX</b> on the remote end.

       l$ encapsulate --infd 0 --duplex 5
       r$ encapsulate --DUPLEX 5 --outfd 1

       <b>--infd</b>  must  have a corresponding <b>--outfd</b> on the remote end.  It's out of order and the channels will be
       allocated incorrectly leading to protocol errors.

       If you understand the source  code  for  <b>encapsulate</b>,  you  can  violate  these  guidelines,  but  it  is
       unnecessary,  error-prone,  and ill-advised; besides, you don't really understand the source code.  Don't
       do it.

</pre><h4><b>CLIENT</b> <b>-VS-</b> <b>SERVER</b></h4><pre>
       The SCP has an implicit polarity.  One end is the server and the  other  end  is  the  client.   You  can
       specify which end is which using <b>--client</b> and <b>--server</b>.  If you do not specify one, then <b>encapsulate</b> will
       compare  the addresses of both ends of the socket (specified with <b>--fd</b>) and use a deterministic algorithm
       to pick one to be the server and one to be the client.  If the remote address  of  the  socket  does  not
       correspond to the remote <b>encapsulate</b> (e.g. the packets are being forwarded through a plugged gateway, the
       addresses  are  being  masqueraded,  or are otherwise percieved inconsistently by the two ends) then this
       algorithm has a good chance of "failing" and assigning both to be server or both to be client.

       The only time you should ever let  <b>encapsulate</b>  choose  between  client  and  server  is  in  interactive
       situations.   It  is  very  likely  that  a  software system built around <b>encapsulate</b> will be reused in a
       situation where the automatic polarity assignment fails.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Here's a simple file transfer daemon:

       server$ faucet 3001 --once --fd3 \
            sh -c 'while <a href="file:~/src/netpipes4.0/encapsulate">~/src/netpipes4.0/encapsulate</a> --fd 3 -so5i4 \
                       sh -c "fname=`cat 0&lt;&amp;4`; echo \$fname; cat &lt; \$fname 1&gt;&amp;5"; \
                       do true; done'
       client$ hose server 3001 --retry 10 --delay 1 --fd3 \
               sh -c 'while read fname; do \
                       <a href="file:~/src/netpipes4.0/encapsulate">~/src/netpipes4.0/encapsulate</a> --fd 3 -si4o5 \
                               sh -c "echo $fname 1&gt;&amp;5; exec 5&gt;&amp;-; cat 0&lt;&amp;4" \
                       || break; done'

       Just type the name of the file you want to retrieve into the hose and press return.  It will be dumped to
       stdout.  Repeat until enlightened or bored.

</pre><h4><b>TROUBLESHOOTING</b></h4><pre>
       Did you specify <b>--client</b> and <b>--server</b> properly?  One side should be server,  the  other  side  should  be
       client.   If  you specify them both as server or both as client, you have made a mistake.  Do not rely on
       the automatic polarity detection.  While it is theoretically a very good algorithm,  it  is  fooled  very
       easily.

       Do  all  of  your  channel assignments (<b>--infd</b> et al) match up?  If you get these wrong, <b>encapsulate</b> will
       freak out and drip spooge all over your shoes.

       For deadlock avoidance, make sure you are closing channels when you don't need them anymore.  Use the &gt;&amp;-
       redirection operator in sh or bash.  Make sure you close it in all of the background processes as well.

       Unable to read stdin from a process that has been backgrounded with &amp; ?  Bash closes  file  descriptor  0
       for  any  subprocess  that is backgrounded (e.g. (command&amp;) ).  You can get around this by copying 0 onto
       another descriptor, and then copying it back within the backgrounded process.

       ( ( cat 0&lt;&amp;3 ) &amp; ) 3&lt;&amp;0

       netpipes (1), <a href="http://sunsite.unc.edu/ses/scp.html">http://sunsite.unc.edu/ses/scp.html</a>

       The Session Control Protocol document on SunSite was a draft.  There is a more recent  one  that  doesn't
       specify  header  compression  (which  I don't use anyway).  It may eventually become an RFC.  Then again,
       encapsulate may be the only program which ever implements SCP.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>encapsulate</b> is not hard  to  deadlock.   Until  I  add  unbounded  buffering  inside  encapsulate,  avoid
       constructing deadlock-vulnerable systems.

       The  <b>encapsulate</b>  included  with  netpipes  4.0 totally failed to handle the case where no subprocess was
       specified.  No error message would be issued, and the program  would  do  absolutely  nothing.   The  4.1
       version should work.

       <b>encapsulate</b>  has  no  other known bugs.  I'm sure there are unknown ones because this software is not yet
       mature; in fact, it's totally wet behind the ears.  Break it and send me the pieces.

       Well, the command-line argument style is inconsistent with faucet &amp; hose.   I'll  be  updating  faucet  &amp;
       hose.

       The  Linux  kernel  from the beginning of time up through version 2.0.29 has a problem with sockets being
       shut down "too fast".  This results in loss of data at the end of a  stream  and  an  "Error:  connection
       reset  by  peer"  during  reads.   2.0.30  supposedly fixes this.  This state machine flaw is very likely
       present in many other OSes, because the strange conditions that exercise it  are  almost  nonexistent  in
       normal  applications,  but happen all the time in some applications of the NetPipes package.  <b>encapsulate</b>
       can be used to work around this bug in some cases because encapsulate does not perform a shutdown on  the
       network socket ever (it doesn't even do a "close").
