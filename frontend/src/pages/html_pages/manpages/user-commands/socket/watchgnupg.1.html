</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       <b>watchgnupg</b> - Read and print logs from a socket

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>watchgnupg</b> [<b>--force</b>] [<b>--verbose</b>] <u>socketname</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Most  of  the main utilities are able to write their log files to a Unix Domain socket if configured that
       way.  <b>watchgnupg</b> is a simple listener for such a socket.  It ameliorates the output with a time stamp and
       makes sure that long lines are not interspersed with log output from other utilities.  This tool  is  not
       available for Windows.

       <b>watchgnupg</b> is commonly invoked as

         watchgnupg

       which is a shorthand for

         watchgnupg --force $(gpgconf --list-dirs socketdir)/S.log

       To watch GnuPG running with a different home directory, use

         watchgnupg --homedir DIR

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>watchgnupg</b> understands these options:

       <b>--force</b>
              Delete an already existing socket file.  This option is implicitly used if no socket name has been
              given on the command line.

       <b>--homedir</b> <u>DIR</u>
              If no socket name is given on the command line, pass <u>DIR</u> to gpgconf so that the socket for a GnuPG
              running  with DIR has its home directory is used.  Note that the environment variable <u>GNUPGHOME</u> is
              ignored by watchgnupg.

       <b>--tcp</b> <u>n</u>
              Instead of reading from a local socket, listen for connects on TCP port <u>n</u>.  A Unix  domain  socket
              can optionally also be given as a second source.  This option does not use a default socket name.

       <b>--time-only</b>
              Do not print the date part of the timestamp.

       <b>--verbose</b>
              Enable extra informational output.

       <b>--version</b>
              Print version of the program and exit.

       <b>--help</b> Display a brief help page and exit.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
         $ watchgnupg --time-only

       This  waits for connections on the local socket (e.g. ‘<u>/var/run/user/1234/gnupg/S.log</u>’) and shows all log
       entries.  To make this work the option <b>log-file</b> needs to be used with all modules which logs  are  to  be
       shown.  The suggested entry for the configuration files is:

         log-file socket://

       If  the default socket as given above and returned by "echo $(gpgconf –list-dirs socketdir)/S.log" is not
       desired an arbitrary socket name can be specified, for  example  ‘<u>socket:///home/foo/bar/mysocket</u>’.   For
       debugging  purposes  it is also possible to do remote logging.  Take care if you use this feature because
       the information is send in the clear over the network.  Use this syntax in the conf files:

         log-file tcp://192.168.1.1:4711

       You may use any port and not just 4711 as shown above; only IP addresses are supported (v4 and v6) and no
       host names.  You need to start <b>watchgnupg</b> with the <b>tcp</b> option.  Note  that  under  Windows  the  registry
       entry  <u>HKCU\Software\GNU\GnuPG:DefaultLogFile</u> can be used to change the default log output from <b>stderr</b> to
       whatever is given by that entry.  However the only useful entry is a TCP name for remote debugging.

       The full documentation for this tool is maintained as a Texinfo manual.  If GnuPG and  the  info  program
       are properly installed at your site, the command

         info gnupg

       should give you access to the complete manual including a menu structure and an index.
