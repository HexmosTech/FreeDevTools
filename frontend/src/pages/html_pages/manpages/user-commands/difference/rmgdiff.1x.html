</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       rmgdiff  -  use  almost any graphical file difference browser to recursively view the differences between
       two directories.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       rmgdiff [-b] [-d] [-g gui] [-n] dir1 dir2

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>rmgdiff</u> is an awk script that works in conjunction with almost any graphical file difference browser.  It
       is known to work with <u>mgdiff</u>, <u>tkdiff</u>, and <u>xdiff</u>.

       Unless I am mistaken, most of the GUI difference viewers (except for emacs) do not have built-in  support
       for  recursing  down  two  directories,  but  <u>diff</u> does.  Based on <u>diff</u>'s output, <u>rmgdiff</u> decides when to
       invoke the graphical difference viewer.

       In addition, <u>rmgdiff</u> also collates <u>diff</u>'s output.  As soon as a new difference is encountered in  a  text
       file,  <u>rmgdiff</u>  will  print to standard output the name of the file that both directories have in common.
       It will then start the GUI and block until the user exits.  As  more  text  files  with  differences  are
       found, the GUI will be started up again.

       In  the  interim,  <u>rmgdiff</u>  will  keep track of differences in binary (non-text) files.  It organizes the
       binary files as executables, shared libraries, static libraries, object files, and other.  Only after all
       the text files have been displayed will <u>rmgdiff</u> report the binary differences.

       It also keeps track of files and directories that <u>diff</u> reports as being only in one directory or another.
       <u>rmgdiff</u> organizes these entries by directory.  Thus, files in one  directory  will  be  reported  in  one
       block, and files that are in the other directory will be reported in a different block.

       In  addition  to  printing  the  name  of  the files that are different, <u>rmgdiff</u> defaults to printing the
       relevant portion of the output from the <u>file</u> command.  This has the unfortunate  side-effect  of  slowing
       things down; however, I find this information to be invaluable.  If you're just looking for a fast way to
       collate <u>diff</u>'s output, try piping it into <u>sort</u> instead.

</pre><h4><b>COMMAND</b> <b>LINE</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-b</b>      Sets  the  basic  reporting  mode.   In basic mode, rmgdiff reports only file names.  It does not
               report the file types involved.

       <b>-c</b>      By default, files relating to <u>CVS</u> are ignored by <u>rmgdiff</u>.  If you want to include CVS files,  use
               this option.

       <b>-d</b>      Sets <u>rmgdiff</u> to print way too much debugging information.

       <b>-g</b> <u>gui</u>  Tells  <u>rmgdiff</u>  which  gui  you would like to use for viewing differences.  By default, <u>mgdiff</u> is
               used.  You can also set $RMGDIFF_GUI in your environment, but it  can  be  overridden  with  this
               option.

       <b>-n</b>      <u>rmgdiff</u> will not invoke the gui.  This is useful, if you only want to view the collated output.
