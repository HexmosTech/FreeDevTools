</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       perl583delta - what is new for perl v5.8.3

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This document describes differences between the 5.8.2 release and the 5.8.3 release.

       If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.6.1, first read the perl58delta, which describes
       differences between 5.6.0 and 5.8.0, and the perl581delta and perl582delta, which describe differences
       between 5.8.0, 5.8.1 and 5.8.2

</pre><h4><b>Incompatible</b> <b>Changes</b></h4><pre>
       There are no changes incompatible with 5.8.2.

</pre><h4><b>Core</b> <b>Enhancements</b></h4><pre>
       A "SCALAR" method is now available for tied hashes. This is called when a tied hash is used in scalar
       context, such as

           if (%tied_hash) {
               ...
           }

       The old behaviour was that %tied_hash would return whatever would have been returned for that hash before
       the hash was tied (so usually 0). The new behaviour in the absence of a SCALAR method is to return TRUE
       if in the middle of an "each" iteration, and otherwise call FIRSTKEY to check if the hash is empty
       (making sure that a subsequent "each" will also begin by calling FIRSTKEY). Please see "SCALAR" in
       perltie for the full details and caveats.

</pre><h4><b>Modules</b> <b>and</b> <b>Pragmata</b></h4><pre>
       CGI
       Cwd
       Digest
       Digest::MD5
       Encode
       File::Spec
       FindBin
           A function "again" is provided to resolve problems where modules in different directories wish to use
           FindBin.

       List::Util
           You can now weaken references to read only values.

       Math::BigInt
       PodParser
       Pod::Perldoc
       POSIX
       Unicode::Collate
       Unicode::Normalize
       Test::Harness
       threads::shared
           "cond_wait" has a new two argument form. "cond_timedwait" has been added.

</pre><h4><b>Utility</b> <b>Changes</b></h4><pre>
       "find2perl" now assumes "-print" as a default action. Previously, it needed to be specified explicitly.

       A  new  utility, "prove", makes it easy to run an individual regression test at the command line. "prove"
       is part of Test::Harness, which users of earlier Perl versions can install from CPAN.

</pre><h4><b>New</b> <b>Documentation</b></h4><pre>
       The documentation has been revised in places to produce more standard manpages.

       The documentation for the special code blocks (BEGIN, CHECK, INIT, END) has been improved.

</pre><h4><b>Installation</b> <b>and</b> <b>Configuration</b> <b>Improvements</b></h4><pre>
       Perl now builds on OpenVMS I64

</pre><h4><b>Selected</b> <b>Bug</b> <b>Fixes</b></h4><pre>
       Using <b>substr()</b> on a UTF8 string could cause subsequent accesses on that string to  return  garbage.  This
       was due to incorrect UTF8 offsets being cached, and is now fixed.

       <b>join()</b>  could return garbage when the same <b>join()</b> statement was used to process 8 bit data having earlier
       processed UTF8 data, due to the flags on that statement's temporary workspace not being reset  correctly.
       This is now fixed.

       "$a .. $b" will now work as expected when either $a or $b is "undef"

       Using Unicode keys with tied hashes should now work correctly.

       Reading  $^E  now  preserves  $!.  Previously,  the  C code implementing $^E did not preserve "errno", so
       reading $^E could cause "errno" and therefore $! to change unexpectedly.

       Reentrant functions will (once more) work with C++. 5.8.2 introduced a bugfix  which  accidentally  broke
       the compilation of Perl extensions written in C++

</pre><h4><b>New</b> <b>or</b> <b>Changed</b> <b>Diagnostics</b></h4><pre>
       The fatal error "DESTROY created new reference to dead object" is now documented in perldiag.

</pre><h4><b>Changed</b> <b>Internals</b></h4><pre>
       The  hash code has been refactored to reduce source duplication. The external interface is unchanged, and
       aside from the bug fixes described above, there should be no change in behaviour.

       "hv_clear_placeholders" is now part of the perl API

       Some C macros have been tidied. In particular macros which create  temporary  local  variables  now  name
       these variables more defensively, which should avoid bugs where names clash.

       &lt;signal.h&gt; is now always included.

</pre><h4><b>Configuration</b> <b>and</b> <b>Building</b></h4><pre>
       "Configure" now invokes callbacks regardless of the value of the variable they are called for. Previously
       callbacks  were  only  invoked  in  the  "case $variable $define)" branch. This change should only affect
       platform maintainers writing configuration hints files.

</pre><h4><b>Platform</b> <b>Specific</b> <b>Problems</b></h4><pre>
       The regression test ext/threads/shared/t/wait.t fails on early RedHat 9 and HP-UX 10.20 due  to  bugs  in
       their         threading         implementations.          RedHat         users         should         see
       https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2003-136.html and consider upgrading their glibc.

</pre><h4><b>Known</b> <b>Problems</b></h4><pre>
       Detached threads aren't supported on Windows yet, as they may lead to memory access violation problems.

       There is a known race condition opening scripts in "suidperl". "suidperl" is neither built nor  installed
       by  default,  and  has  been deprecated since perl 5.8.0. You are advised to replace use of suidperl with
       tools such as sudo ( <a href="http://www.courtesan.com/sudo/">http://www.courtesan.com/sudo/</a> )

       We have a backlog of unresolved bugs. Dealing  with  bugs  and  bug  reports  is  unglamorous  work;  not
       something ideally suited to volunteer labour, but that is all that we have.

       The perl5 development team are implementing changes to help address this problem, which should go live in
       early 2004.

</pre><h4><b>Future</b> <b>Directions</b></h4><pre>
       Code  freeze for the next maintenance release (5.8.4) is on March 31st 2004, with release expected by mid
       April. Similarly 5.8.5's freeze will be at the end of June, with release by mid July.

</pre><h4><b>Obituary</b></h4><pre>
       Iain 'Spoon' Truskett, Perl hacker, author of perlreref and contributor to CPAN, died  suddenly  on  29th
       December 2003, aged 24.  He will be missed.

</pre><h4><b>Reporting</b> <b>Bugs</b></h4><pre>
       If  you  find  what  you  think  is  a  bug,  you  might  check  the  articles  recently  posted  to  the
       comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug database  at  <a href="http://bugs.perl.org">http://bugs.perl.org</a>.   There  may  also  be
       information at <a href="http://www.perl.org">http://www.perl.org</a>, the Perl Home Page.

       If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the <b>perlbug</b> program included with your release.  Be
       sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of
       "perl  -V", will be sent off to <a href="mailto:perlbug@perl.org">perlbug@perl.org</a> to be analysed by the Perl porting team.  You can browse
       and search the Perl 5 bugs at <a href="http://bugs.perl.org/">http://bugs.perl.org/</a>
