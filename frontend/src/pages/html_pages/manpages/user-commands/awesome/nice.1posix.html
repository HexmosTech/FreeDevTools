</pre><h4><b>PROLOG</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       nice — invoke a utility with an altered nice value

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       nice <b>[</b>-n <u>increment</u><b>]</b> <u>utility</u> <b>[</b><u>argument</u>...<b>]</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>nice</u>  utility shall invoke a utility, requesting that it be run with a different nice value (see the
       Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <u>Section</u> <u>3.244</u>, <u>Nice</u>  <u>Value</u>).   With  no  options,  the  executed
       utility shall be run with a nice value that is some implementation-defined quantity greater than or equal
       to  the  nice  value  of the current process. If the user lacks appropriate privileges to affect the nice
       value in the requested manner, the <u>nice</u> utility shall not affect the nice value; in this case, a  warning
       message  may be written to standard error, but this shall not prevent the invocation of <u>utility</u> or affect
       the exit status.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>nice</u> utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume  of  POSIX.1‐2017,  <u>Section</u>  <u>12.2</u>,  <u>Utility</u>
       <u>Syntax</u> <u>Guidelines</u>.

       The following option is supported:

       <b>-n</b> <u>increment</u>
                 A positive or negative decimal integer which shall have the same effect on the execution of the
                 utility  as  if  the  utility  had  called  the  <u>nice</u>()  function with the numeric value of the
                 <u>increment</u> option-argument.

</pre><h4><b>OPERANDS</b></h4><pre>
       The following operands shall be supported:

       <u>utility</u>   The name of a utility that is to be invoked. If the <u>utility</u> operand names any  of  the  special
                 built-in utilities in <u>Section</u> <u>2.14</u>, <u>Special</u> <u>Built-In</u> <u>Utilities</u>, the results are undefined.

       <u>argument</u>  Any  string  to  be  supplied  as  an  argument  when invoking the utility named by the <u>utility</u>
                 operand.

</pre><h4><b>STDIN</b></h4><pre>
       Not used.

</pre><h4><b>INPUT</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of <u>nice</u>:

       <u>LANG</u>      Provide a default value for the internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See the
                 Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <u>Section</u> <u>8.2</u>, <u>Internationalization</u>  <u>Variables</u>  for  the
                 precedence   of   internationalization  variables  used  to  determine  the  values  of  locale
                 categories.)

       <u>LC_ALL</u>    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values of all the  other  internationalization
                 variables.

       <u>LC_CTYPE</u>  Determine  the  locale  for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of text data as characters
                 (for example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments).

       <u>LC_MESSAGES</u>
                 Determine the locale that should be used to  affect  the  format  and  contents  of  diagnostic
                 messages written to standard error.

       <u>NLSPATH</u>   Determine the location of message catalogs for the processing of <u>LC_MESSAGES</u>.

       <u>PATH</u>      Determine  the  search path used to locate the utility to be invoked.  See the Base Definitions
                 volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <u>Chapter</u> <u>8</u>, <u>Environment</u> <u>Variables</u>.

</pre><h4><b>ASYNCHRONOUS</b> <b>EVENTS</b></h4><pre>
       Default.

</pre><h4><b>STDOUT</b></h4><pre>
       Not used.

</pre><h4><b>STDERR</b></h4><pre>
       The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.

</pre><h4><b>OUTPUT</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>EXTENDED</b> <b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       If <u>utility</u> is invoked, the exit status of <u>nice</u> shall be the exit status of <u>utility</u>; otherwise,  the  <u>nice</u>
       utility shall exit with one of the following values:

       1‐125   An error occurred in the <u>nice</u> utility.

         126   The utility specified by <u>utility</u> was found but could not be invoked.

         127   The utility specified by <u>utility</u> could not be found.

</pre><h4><b>CONSEQUENCES</b> <b>OF</b> <b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       Default.

       <u>The</u> <u>following</u> <u>sections</u> <u>are</u> <u>informative.</u>

</pre><h4><b>APPLICATION</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       The only guaranteed portable uses of this utility are:

       <u>nice</u> <u>utility</u>
             Run <u>utility</u> with the default higher or equal nice value.

       <u>nice</u> <b>-n</b> &lt;<u>positive</u> <u>integer</u>&gt; <u>utility</u>
             Run <u>utility</u> with a higher nice value.

       On  some  implementations  they have no discernible effect on the invoked utility and on some others they
       are exactly equivalent.

       Historical systems have frequently supported the &lt;<u>positive</u> <u>integer</u>&gt; up to 20. Since  there  is  no  error
       penalty  associated  with  guessing  a  number  that  is  too  high,  users  without access to the system
       conformance document (to see what limits are actually in place) could use the historical 1 to 20 range or
       attempt to use very large numbers if the job should be truly low priority.

       The nice value of a process can be displayed using the command:

           ps -o nice

       The <u>command</u>, <u>env</u>, <u>nice</u>, <u>nohup</u>, <u>time</u>, and <u>xargs</u> utilities have been specified to use exit code 127  if  an
       error  occurs  so  that applications can distinguish ``failure to find a utility'' from ``invoked utility
       exited with an error indication''. The value 127 was chosen because it is not  commonly  used  for  other
       meanings; most utilities use small values for ``normal error conditions'' and the values above 128 can be
       confused  with  termination  due  to receipt of a signal. The value 126 was chosen in a similar manner to
       indicate that the utility could be found, but not invoked. Some scripts produce meaningful error messages
       differentiating the 126 and 127 cases. The distinction between  exit  codes  126  and  127  is  based  on
       KornShell  practice  that uses 127 when all attempts to <u>exec</u> the utility fail with <b>[ENOENT]</b>, and uses 126
       when any attempt to <u>exec</u> the utility fails for any other reason.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>RATIONALE</b></h4><pre>
       The 4.3 BSD version of <u>nice</u> does not check whether <u>increment</u> is a valid decimal integer. The command <u>nice</u>
       <b>-x</b> <u>utility</u>, for example, would be treated the same as the command <u>nice</u> <b>--1</b> <u>utility</u>.  If the user does not
       have appropriate privileges, this results in a ``permission denied'' error.  This is considered a bug.

       When a user without appropriate privileges gives a negative  <u>increment</u>,  System  V  treats  it  like  the
       command  <u>nice</u>  <b>-0</b>  <u>utility</u>,  while  4.3  BSD  writes a ``permission denied'' message and does not run the
       utility. The standard specifies the System V behavior together with an  optional  BSD-style  ``permission
       denied'' message.

       The  C shell has a built-in version of <u>nice</u> that has a different interface from the one described in this
       volume of POSIX.1‐2017.

       The term ``utility'' is used, rather  than  ``command'',  to  highlight  the  fact  that  shell  compound
       commands,  pipelines,  and  so  on,  cannot  be  used.  Special  built-ins also cannot be used.  However,
       ``utility'' includes user application programs and shell scripts, not  just  utilities  defined  in  this
       volume of POSIX.1‐2017.

       Historical  implementations  of  <u>nice</u>  provide  a  nice  value range of 40 or 41 discrete steps, with the
       default nice value being the midpoint of that range. By  default,  they  raise  the  nice  value  of  the
       executed utility by 10.

       Some  historical  documentation  states  that  the  <u>increment</u> value must be within a fixed range. This is
       misleading; the valid <u>increment</u> values on any invocation are  determined  by  the  current  process  nice
       value, which is not always the default.

       The  definition  of  nice value is not intended to suggest that all processes in a system have priorities
       that are comparable. Scheduling  policy  extensions  such  as  the  realtime  priorities  in  the  System
       Interfaces  volume  of  POSIX.1‐2017  make  the notion of a single underlying priority for all scheduling
       policies problematic. Some  implementations  may  implement  the  <u>nice</u>-related  features  to  affect  all
       processes on the system, others to affect just the general time-sharing activities implied by this volume
       of  POSIX.1‐2017,  and others may have no effect at all. Because of the use of ``implementation-defined''
       in <u>nice</u> and <u>renice</u>, a wide range of implementation strategies are possible.

       Earlier versions of this standard allowed a <b>-</b><u>increment</u> option.  This  form  is  no  longer  specified  by
       POSIX.1‐2008 but may be present in some implementations.
