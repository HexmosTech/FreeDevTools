</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       steghide - a steganography program

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>steghide</b> <u>command</u> [ <u>arguments</u> ]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Steghide</b> is a steganography program that is able to hide data in various kinds of image- and audio-files.
       The  color-  respectivly  sample-frequencies  are not changed thus making the embedding resistant against
       first-order statistical tests.

       Features include the compression of the embedded data, encryption of  the  embedded  data  and  automatic
       integrity  checking  using  a  checksum.  The JPEG, BMP, WAV and AU file formats are supported for use as
       cover file. There are no restrictions on the format of the secret data.

       Steghide uses a graph-theoretic approach to steganography. You do not need to know anything  about  graph
       theory  to  use  steghide and you can safely skip the rest of this paragraph if you are not interested in
       the technical details. The embedding algorithm roughly works as follows: At first,  the  secret  data  is
       compressed  and encrypted. Then a sequence of positions of pixels in the cover file is created based on a
       pseudo-random number generator initialized with the passphrase (the secret data will be embedded  in  the
       pixels at these positions). Of these positions those that do not need to be changed (because they already
       contain  the  correct  value  by  chance) are sorted out. Then a graph-theoretic matching algorithm finds
       pairs of positions such that exchanging their values has the effect of embedding the  corresponding  part
       of  the  secret  data.  If  the  algorithm  cannot  find  any  more such pairs all exchanges are actually
       performed.  The pixels at the remaining positions (the positions that are not part of such  a  pair)  are
       also  modified to contain the embedded data (but this is done by overwriting them, not by exchanging them
       with other pixels).  The fact that (most of) the embedding is done by  exchanging  pixel  values  implies
       that  the first-order statistics (i.e. the number of times a color occurs in the picture) is not changed.
       For audio files the algorithm is the same, except that audio samples are used instead of pixels.

       The default encryption algorithm is Rijndael with a key size of 128 bits (which is  AES  -  the  advanced
       encryption standard) in the cipher block chaining mode. If you do not trust this combination for whatever
       reason  feel free to choose another algorithm/mode combination (information about all possible algorithms
       and modes is displayed by the <b>encinfo</b> command).  The checksum is calculated using the CRC32 algorithm.

</pre><h4><b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       In this section the commands for steghide are listed. The first argument must  always  be  one  of  these
       commands. You can supply additional arguments to the <b>embed</b>, <b>extract</b> and <b>info</b> commands. The other commands
       to not take any arguments.

       <b>embed,</b> <b>--embed</b>
              Embed secret data in a cover file thereby creating a stego file.

       <b>extract,</b> <b>--extract</b>
              Extract secret data from a stego file.

       <b>info,</b> <b>--info</b>
              Display information about a cover or stego file.

       <b>encinfo,</b> <b>--encinfo</b>
              Display a list of encryption algorithms and modes that can be used. No arguments required.

       <b>version,</b> <b>--version</b>
              Display short version information. No arguments required.

       <b>license,</b> <b>--license</b>
              Display steghide's license. No arguments required.

       <b>help,</b> <b>--help</b>
              Display a help screen. No arguments required.

</pre><h4><b>EMBEDDING</b></h4><pre>
       You  should  use  the  <b>embed</b>  command  if  you  want  to embed secret data in a cover file. The following
       arguments can be used with the <b>embed</b> command:

       <b>-ef,</b> <b>--embedfile</b> <u>filename</u>
              Specify the file that will be embedded (the file that contains  the  secret  message).  Note  that
              steghide  embeds  the  original  file name in the stego file. When extracting data (see below) the
              default behaviour is to save the embedded file into the current directory under its original name.
              If this argument is omitted or <u>filename</u> is <b>-</b>, steghide will read the  secret  data  from  standard
              input.

       <b>-cf,</b> <b>--coverfile</b> <u>filename</u>
              Specify  the  cover  file  that  will  be used to embed data. The cover file must be in one of the
              following formats: AU, BMP, JPEG or WAV. The file-format will be detected automatically  based  on
              header  information (the extension is not relevant). If this argument is omitted or <u>filename</u> is <b>-</b>,
              steghide will read the cover file from standard input.

       <b>-sf,</b> <b>--stegofile</b> <u>filename</u>
              Specify the name for the stego file that will be created. If this argument is omitted when calling
              steghide with the <b>embed</b> command, then the modifications to embed the  secret  data  will  be  made
              directly to the cover file without saving it under a new name.

       <b>-e,</b> <b>--encryption</b> <u>algo</u> <b>[</b> <u>mode</u> <b>]</b> <b>|</b> <u>mode</u> <b>[</b> <u>algo</u> <b>]</b>
              Specify encryption parameters. This option must be followed by one or two strings that identify an
              encryption  algorithm and/or mode. You can get the names of all available algorithms and supported
              modes with the <b>encinfo</b> command. The default encryption is <b>rijndael-128</b> (AES) in the <b>cbc</b> mode.   If
              you do not want to use any encryption, use <b>-e</b> <b>none</b>.

       <b>-z,</b> <b>--compress</b> <u>level</u>
              Specify the compression level. The compression level can be any number in 1...9 where 1 means best
              speed and 9 means best compression.

       <b>-Z,</b> <b>--dontcompress</b>
              Do not compress the secret data before embedding it.

       <b>-K,</b> <b>--nochecksum</b>
              Do  not  embed a CRC32 checksum. You can use this if the secret data already contains some type of
              checksum or if you do not want to embed those extra 32 bits needed for the checksum.

       <b>-N,</b> <b>--dontembedname</b>
              Do not embed the file name of the secret file. If this option is  used,  the  extractor  needs  to
              specify a filename to tell steghide where to write the embedded data.

</pre><h4><b>EXTRACTING</b></h4><pre>
       If you have received a file that contains a message that has been embedded with steghide, use the <b>extract</b>
       command to extract it. The following arguments can be used with this command.

       <b>-sf,</b> <b>--stegofile</b> <u>filename</u>
              Specify  the  stego  file  (the  file that contains embedded data). If this argument is omitted or
              <u>filename</u> is <b>-</b>, steghide will read a stego file from standard input.

       <b>-xf,</b> <b>--extractfile</b> <u>filename</u>
              Create a file with the name <u>filename</u> and write the data that is embedded in the stego file to  it.
              This  option  overrides  the  filename  that  is  embedded int the stego file. If this argument is
              omitted, the embedded data will be saved to the current directory under its original name.

</pre><h4><b>GETTING</b> <b>INFORMATION</b> <b>ABOUT</b> <b>A</b> <b>COVER/STEGO</b> <b>FILE</b></h4><pre>
       You can use the <b>info</b> command to get some information about  a  cover  or  stego  file  (for  example  the
       capacity).  You might want to use this if you have received a file and you are not sure if it contains an
       embedded message or if you consider using a certain file as cover file and want to find out its capacity.

       The command line <b>steghide</b> <b>info</b> <u>&lt;filename&gt;</u> will print information about <u>&lt;filename&gt;</u> and then ask you if you
       would like to get information about data that is embedded in that file. If you answer with yes  you  have
       to supply the passphrase that was used to embed the data in that file.

       You  can  also  supply the <b>-p,</b> <b>--passphrase</b> argument (see below) to the <b>info</b> command which has the effect
       that steghide will automatically try to get information about the data that has been embedded  using  the
       given passphrase.

</pre><h4><b>COMMON</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The following options can be used with all commands (where it makes sense).

       <b>-p,</b> <b>--passphrase</b>
              Use  the string following this argument as the passphrase. If your passphrase contains whitespace,
              you have to enclose it in quotes, for example: <b>-p</b> <b>"a</b> <b>very</b> <b>long</b> <b>passphrase"</b>.

       <b>-v,</b> <b>--verbose</b>
              Display detailed information about the status of the embedding or extracting process.

       <b>-q,</b> <b>--quiet</b>
              Suppress information messages.

       <b>-f,</b> <b>--force</b>
              Always overwrite existing files.

</pre><h4><b>FILE</b> <b>NAME</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       All file name arguments (<b>-cf</b>, <b>-ef</b>, <b>-sf</b>, <b>-xf</b>) also accept  <b>-</b>  as  a  filename  which  makes  steghide  use
       standard  input or standard output (whichever makes sense). Omitting the corresponding file name argument
       will have the same effect as using <b>-</b> with two exceptions: If <b>-sf</b> is omitted for the embed  command,  then
       the  modifications  will  be  done directly in the cover file. If <b>-xf</b> is omitted for extraction, then the
       embedded data will be saved under the file name that is embedded in the stego file.  So when you want  to
       be sure that standard input/output is used, use <b>-</b> as filename.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       The basic usage is as follows:

         $ steghide embed -cf picture.jpg -ef secret.txt
         Enter passphrase:
         Re-Enter passphrase:
         embedding "secret.txt" in "picture.jpg"... done

       This command will embed the file secret.txt in the cover file picture.jpg.

       After  you  have embedded your secret data as shown above you can send the file picture.jpg to the person
       who should receive the secret message. The receiver has to use steghide in the following way:

         $ steghide extract -sf picture.jpg
         Enter passphrase:
         wrote extracted data to "secret.txt".

       If the supplied passphrase is correct, the contents of the original file  secret.txt  will  be  extracted
       from the stego file picture.jpg and saved in the current directory.

       If  you  have  received  a file that contains embedded data and you want to get some information about it
       before extracting it, use the info command:

         $ steghide info received_file.wav
         "received_file.wav":
           format: wave audio, PCM encoding
           capacity: 3.5 KB
         Try to get information about embedded data ? (y/n) y
         Enter passphrase:
           embedded file "secret.txt":
             size: 1.6 KB
             encrypted: rijndael-128, cbc
             compressed: yes

       After printing some general information about the stego file (format, capacity)  you  will  be  asked  if
       steghide should try to get information about the embedded data. If you answer with yes you have to supply
       a  passphrase.  Steghide  will  then  try  to  extract the embedded data with that passphrase and - if it
       succeeds - print some information about it.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       Steghide returns 0 on success and 1 if a failure occurred and it had to terminate  before  completion  of
       the requested operation. Warnings do not have an effect on the return value.
