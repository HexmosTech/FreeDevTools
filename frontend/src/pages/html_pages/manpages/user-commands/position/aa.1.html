</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       aa - astronomical almanac - calculate planet and star positions

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>aa</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>aa</b>  program  computes  the  orbital  positions  of planetary bodies and performs rigorous coordinate
       reductions to apparent geocentric and topocentric place (local altitude and azimuth).   It  also  reduces
       star  catalogue  positions  given in either the FK4 or FK5 system.  Data for the 57 navigational stars is
       included.  Most of the algorithms employed are from The Astronomical Almanac (AA) published by  the  U.S.
       Government Printing Office.

       The <b>aa</b> program follows the rigorous algorithms for reduction of celestial coordinates exactly as laid out
       in  current  editions  of  the Astronomical Almanac.  The reduction to apparent geocentric place has been
       checked by a special version of the program (aa200) that takes planetary positions directly from the  Jet
       Propulsion Laboratory DE200 numerical integration of the solar system. The results agree exactly with the
       Astronomical  Almanac  tables  from  1987  onward  (earlier  Almanacs  used  slightly different reduction
       methods).

</pre><h4><b>Initialization</b></h4><pre>
       The following items will be read in automatically from the first of these files to  be  found:  <u>./aa.ini</u>,
       <u><a href="file:~/.aa.ini">~/.aa.ini</a></u>,  <u>/etc/aa.ini</u>.   The  file  contains  one  ASCII string number per line so is easily edited.  A
       sample initialization file is supplied.  The entries are:

       lon    Terrestrial longitude of observer, degrees East of Greenwich

       lat    Geodetic latitude of observer (program calculates geocentric latitude)

       height Height above sea level, meters

       temp   Atmospheric temperature, degrees Centigrade

       pressure
              Atmospheric pressure, millibars

       tflag  Input time type: 1 = TDT, 2 = UT, 0 = TDT set equal to UT

       deltaT Value to use for deltaT, seconds; if 0 then the program will compute it.

</pre><h4><b>Orbit</b> <b>Computations</b></h4><pre>
          Several methods of calculating the positions of the planets have been  provided  for  in  the  program
       source  code.   These  range  in  accuracy  from  a built-in computation using perturbation formulae to a
       solution from precise orbital elements that you supply from an almanac.
          The program uses as a default a set of trigonometric expansions for the  position  of  the  Earth  and
       planets.   These  have been adjusted to match the Jet Propulsion Laboratory's DE404 Long Ephemeris (1995)
       with a precision ranging from about 0.1" for the Earth to 1" for Pluto. The adjustment was carried out on
       the interval from 3000 B.C. to 3000 A.D. for the outer planets.  The adjustment for the inner planets  is
       strictly  valid  only  from  1350  B.C.  to  3000  A.D.,  but  may be used to 3000 B.C. with some loss of
       precision.  See <u>/usr/share/doc/aa/readme.404</u> for additional information.  The true accuracy of  positions
       calculated for prehistoric or future dates is of course unknown.
          The  Moon's  position  is  calculated by a modified version of the lunar theory of Chapront-Touze' and
       Chapront.  This has a precision of 0.5 arc second relative to DE404 for all dates between 1369  B.C.  and
       3000  A.D.   The real position of the Moon in ancient times is not actually known this accurately, due to
       uncertainty in the tidal acceleration of the Moon's orbit.

          In the absence of an interpolated polynomial ephemeris such as the DE200,  the  highest  accuracy  for
       current  planetary positions is achieved by using the heliocentric orbital elements that are published in
       the Astronomical Almanac. If precise orbital elements  are  provided  for  the  desired  epoch  then  the
       apparent place should be found to agree very closely with Almanac tabulations.
          Entering  99 for the planet number generates a prompt for the name of a file containing human-readable
       ASCII strings specifying the elements of orbits. The items in the specification are (see also the example
       file orbit.cat):

                 First line of entry:
              epoch of orbital elements (Julian date)
              inclination
              longitude of the ascending node
              argument of the perihelion
              mean distance (semimajor axis) in au
              daily motion

                 Second line of entry:
              eccentricity
              mean anomaly
              epoch of equinox and ecliptic, Julian date
              visual magnitude B(1,0) at 1au from earth and sun
              equatorial semidiameter at 1au, arc seconds
              name of the object, up to 15 characters

       Angles in the above are in degrees except as noted.  Several sample  orbits  are  supplied  in  the  file
       orbit.cat.   If  you  read  in an orbit named "Earth" the program will install the Earth orbit, then loop
       back and ask for an orbit number again.
         The entry for daily motion is optional.  It will be calculated by the program if it is set equal to 0.0
       in your catalogue.  Almanac values of daily motion recognize the nonzero mass of the orbiting planet; the
       program's calculation will assume the mass is zero.
         Mean distance, for an elliptical orbit, is the length of the semi-major axis of  the  ellipse.  If  the
       eccentricity  is  given to be 1.0, the orbit is parabolic and the "mean distance" item is taken to be the
       perihelion distance.  Similarly a hyperbolic orbit has eccentricity &gt; 1.0 and "mean  distance"  is  again
       interpreted  to  mean  perihelion distance.  In both these cases, the "epoch" is the perihelion date, and
       the mean anomaly is set to 0.0 in your catalogue.
         Elliptical cometary orbits are usually catalogued in terms of perihelion distance also,  but  you  must
       convert this to mean distance to be understood by the program. Use the formula

         mean distance = perihelion distance / (1 - eccentricity)

       to calculate the value to be entered in your catalogue for an elliptical orbit.
         The  epoch  of  the  orbital  elements  refers particularly to the date to which the given mean anomaly
       applies.  Published data for comets often give the time of perihelion passage  as  a  calendar  date  and
       fraction  of a day in Ephemeris Time.  To translate this into a Julian date for your catalogue entry, run
       <b>aa</b>, type in the published date and decimal fraction of a day, and note the displayed Julian date. This is
       the correct Julian Ephemeris Date of the epoch for your catalogue entry.  Example (Sky &amp; Telescope, March
       1991, page 297): Comet Levy 1990c had a perihelion date given as  1990  Oct  24.68664  ET.   As  you  are
       prompted  separately  for  the year, month, and day, enter 1990, 10, 24.68664 into the program. This date
       and fraction translates to JED 2448189.18664.  For comparison purposes, note that  published  ephemerides
       for comets usually give astrometric positions, not apparent positions.

</pre><h4><b>Ephemeris</b> <b>Time</b> <b>and</b> <b>Other</b> <b>Time</b> <b>Scales</b></h4><pre>
          Exercise  care about time scales when comparing results against an almanac.  The orbit program assumes
       input date is Ephemeris Time (ET or TDT).  Topocentric altitude and azimuth are calculated from Universal
       Time (UT).  The program converts between the two as required, but you must indicate  whether  your  input
       entry  is  TDT  or  UT.   This  is done by the entry for input time type in aa.ini.  If you are comparing
       positions against almanac values, you probably want TDT.  If you are looking up at the sky, you  probably
       want  UT.  Ephemeris transit times can be obtained by declaring TDT = UT.  The adjustment for deltaT = ET
       minus UT is accurate for the years 1620 through 2011, as the complete tabulation  from  the  Astronomical
       Almanac  is  included  in  the  program.  Outside  this  range of years, approximate formulas are used to
       estimate deltaT.  These formulas are based on analyses of eclipse records going  back  to  ancient  times
       (Stephenson  and  Houlden,  1986; Borkowski, 1988) but they do not predict future values very accurately.
       For precise calculations, you should update the table in deltat.c from the current year's  Almanac.  Note
       the civil time of day is UTC, which is adjusted by integral leap seconds to be within 0.9 second of UT.

          Updated   deltaT   values   and   predictions   can   be   obtained   from   this   network   archive:
       <a href="http://maia.usno.navy.mil">http://maia.usno.navy.mil</a> .  See the file deltat.c for additional information.  In addition, the IAU  has
       adopted  several  other  definitions  of  time,  but  this  program does not distinguish among them.  The
       International Earth Rotation Service is in charge of UT. Precise data on Earth rotation  and  orientation
       are  published  in the IERS bulletins, available at the IERS computer site www.iers.org as well as at the
       usno site.

</pre><h4><b>Rise</b> <b>and</b> <b>Set</b> <b>Times</b></h4><pre>
          Each calculation of the time of local rising, meridian transit, and setting  includes  a  first  order
       correction for the motion in right ascension and declination of the object between the entered input time
       and  the  time  of the event.  Even so, the calculation has to be iterated, or repeated with successively
       closer estimates of the event time.  In view of the first order correction the iteration  has  a  second-
       order  convergence  characteristic  and  arrives  at a precise result in just two or three steps.  On the
       other hand, the technique used is unstable for nearly-circumpolar objects, such as the Moon  observed  at
       high  latitudes.  Thus a failure to report rise and set times does not necessarily mean that there was no
       rise or set event.

          The program reports the transit that is nearest to the input time.   Rise  and  set  times  ordinarily
       precede  and  follow  the transit.  Check the date displayed next to the rise, set, or transit time to be
       sure the results are for the desired date and not for the previous or next calendar day.  For the Sun and
       Moon, rise and set times are for the upper limb of the  disc;  but  the  indicated  topocentric  altitude
       always  refers  to  the  center  of  the  disc.   The computed event times include the effects of diurnal
       aberration and parallax.

          Age of the Moon, in days from the nearest Quarter, also has a correction for orbital motion, but  does
       not  get  the  benefit  of  iterative improvement and may be off by 0.1 day (the stated Quarter is always
       correct, however). The estimated time can be made much more precise by entering the input date  and  time
       of  day to be near the time of the event.  In other words, the rigorous calculation requires iterating on
       the time; in this case the program does not do so automatically, hence if you want maximum  accuracy  you
       must do the iteration by hand.

</pre><h4><b>Stars</b></h4><pre>
          Positions  and  proper  motions  of  the  57  navigational stars were taken from the Fifth Fundamental
       Catalogue (FK5). They are in the file <u>/usr/share/aa/star.cat</u>.  For all of these, the program's output  of
       astrometric  position agreed with the 1986 AA to the precision of the AA tabulation (an arc second).  The
       same is true for 1950 FK4 positions taken from the SAO catalogue.   The  program  agrees  to  0.01"  with
       worked examples presented in the AA. Spot checks against Apparent Places of Fundamental Stars confirm the
       mean  place agreement to &lt;0.1".  The APFS uses an older nutation series, so direct comparison of apparent
       place is difficult.  The program incorporates the complete IAU Theory of Nutation (1980).  Items for  the
       Messier catalogue, <u>/usr/share/aa/messier.cat</u>, are from either the AA or Sky Catalogue 2000.
          To  compute  a star's apparent position, its motion since the catalogue epoch is taken into account as
       well as the changes due to precession of the equatorial coordinate system.  Star catalogue files have the
       following data structure.  Each star entry occupies one line of ASCII characters.  Numbers can be in  any
       usual decimal computer format and are separated from each other by one or more spaces. From the beginning
       of the line, the parameters are

              Epoch of catalogue coordinates and equinox
              Right ascension, hours
              Right ascension, minutes
              Right ascension, seconds
              Declination, degrees
              Declination, minutes
              Declination, seconds
              Proper motion in R.A., s/century
              Proper motion in Dec., "/century
              Radial velocity, km/s
              Distance, parsecs
              Visual magnitude
              Object name
       For example, the line

       2000 02 31 48.704  89 15 50.72 19.877 -1.52 -17.0 0.0070 2.02 alUMi(Polaris)

       has the following interpretation:

              J2000.0      ;Epoch of coordinates, equator, and equinox
              2h 31m 48.704s    ;Right Ascension
              89deg 15' 50.72"   ;Declination
              19.877       ;proper motion in R.A., s/century
              -1.52        ;proper motion in Dec., "/century
              -17.0        ;radial velocity, km/s
              0.007        ;parallax, "
              2.02         ;magnitude
              alUMi(Polaris)    ;abbreviated name for alpha Ursae Minoris (Polaris)

          Standard  abbreviations for 88 constellation names are expanded into spelled-out form (see constel.c).
       The program accepts two types of catalogue coordinates.  If the epoch is given as 1950, the entire  entry
       is  interpreted as an FK4 item.  The program then automatically converts the data to the FK5 system.  All
       other epochs are interpreted as being in the FK5 system.
          Note that catalogue (and AA) star coordinates are referred to the center of the solar system,  whereas
       the  program  displays the correct geocentric direction of the object.  The maximum difference is 0.8" in
       the case of alpha Centauri.
