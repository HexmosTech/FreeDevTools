</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       hexer - binary file editor

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>hexer</b> [options] [file [...]]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>hexer</b>  is  a multi-buffer editor for viewing and manipulating binary files.  It can't (shouldn't) be used
       for editing block devices, because it tries to load the whole file into a  buffer  (it  should  work  for
       diskettes).   The  most  important  features of <b>hexer</b> are:  multi buffers, multi level undo, command line
       editing with completion, binary regular expressions (see below).  The user interface is kept  similar  to
       <b>vi</b>, so if you know how to use <b>vi</b>, you'll get started easily.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-R,</b> <b>--readonly</b>

       <b>-v,</b> <b>--view</b>
           Edit files in read only mode.

       <b>-r,</b> <b>--recover</b> <u>filename</u>
           Recover the file <u>filename</u> after a crash. (not implemented)

       <b>-c,</b> <b>--command</b> <u>command</u>
           Start  the  editing  session by executing the editor command <u>command</u>.  If <u>command</u> contains spaces, it
           must be surrounded by double quotes.  It is possible to specify  multiple  commands  on  the  command
           line:
           <b>hexer</b> <b>-c</b> <u>command1</u> <b>-c</b> <u>command2</u> <b>...</b>

       <b>-t,</b> <b>--tite</b>
           Turn off the usage of the termcap/terminfo ti/te sequence.

       <b>-h,</b> <b>--help</b>
           Display a short help message and exit.

       <b>-V,</b> <b>--version</b>
           Display program version information and exit.

       <b>-F,</b> <b>--features</b>
           List the features supported by the program and exit.

       <b>+</b><u>command</u>
           This is equivalent to the <b>-c</b> option.

       <b>Note:</b> The long options are not available on all systems.

</pre><h4><b>CUSTOMIZING</b></h4><pre>
       The  editor reads its startup commands from the file <b><a href="file:~/.hexerrc">~/.hexerrc</a></b> (another startup file may be specified by
       setting the environment variable <b>HEXERRC</b>).  Empty lines and lines starting with a  `"'‐character  (double
       quote) are ignored.  It is not possible to have a command and a comment in the same line.

</pre><h4><b>EDITOR</b> <b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       As in <b>vi</b>, there are several editing modes:

       <b>Command</b> <b>Mode</b>
           Some commands in <b>Command</b> <b>Mode</b> can take a numeric argument.  To enter a numeric argument just type the
           (decimal)  number.  The number will be echoed at the bottom line of the screen as you type.  To enter
           an octal number, type a `0' as the first digit.  To enter a hexadecimal number, type  `0x'  (this  is
           not  a  problem,  because the <b>x</b>-command with a zero counter wouldn't make sense anyway).  Some of the
           commands can take a visually selected area as an argument (see subsection <b>Visual</b> <b>Mode</b>).

           <b>b</b>      Move backwards to the beginning of a word.

           <b>e</b>      Move to the end of a word.

           <b>G</b>      If a numeric argument <b>n</b> is given, move the cursor to position <b>n</b>.  If no argument is specified,
                  set the position to the end of the buffer.  The first byte in the buffer is at  position  `0',
                  so the command to move to the beginning of the buffer is `0G'.

           <b>Control-G</b>
                  Display the buffer name, size, status and the current position at the bottom line.

           <b>h</b> <b>j</b> <b>k</b> <b>l</b>
                  Move the cursor.  The arrow keys work as well.  The numeric argument (if specified) determines
                  the  number  rows  or  columns  the  cursor  will  move.  Different from <b>vi</b>: the cursor can be
                  positioned <b>behind</b> the last byte in the buffer.

           <b>i</b>      Enter <b>Insert</b> <b>Mode</b> (see below) at the current position of the point.  If a numeric  argument  <b>n</b>
                  is  given,  the typed text will be inserted <b>n</b> times.  <b>Note:</b> Moving the cursor (using the arrow
                  keys) will discard the numeric argument.

           <b>n</b>      Move to the next match using the current RE.  This is equivalent to typing `/', &lt;Return&gt;.

           <b>N</b>      Move to the previous match using the current RE.  This is equivalent to typing `?', &lt;Return&gt;.

           <b>Control-O</b>
                  Paste over.  Copy the kill buffer to the current position  overwriting  the  contents  of  the
                  current buffer.  If a numeric argument <b>n</b> is given, the kill buffer is pasted <b>n</b> times.

           <b>p</b>      Paste.  Insert the kill buffer at the current position.  If a numeric argument <b>n</b> is given, the
                  kill buffer is pasted <b>n</b> times.

           <b>r</b>      Replace  a  single  byte  using  the  <b>Replace</b>  <b>Mode</b>.  If an area is selected, all bytes in the
                  selected area are replaced.  If a numeric argument is given, the specified number of bytes  is
                  replaced.

           <b>R</b>      Enter  <b>Replace</b>  <b>Mode</b>  (see  below).   If a numeric argument <b>n</b> is given, the replace command is
                  repeated <b>n</b> times.  <b>Note:</b> Moving the cursor (using the arrow keys)  will  discard  the  numeric
                  argument.

           <b>Control-R</b>
                  Redo the last undo.

           <b>u</b>      Undo the last change to the current buffer.

           Whenever  possible  <b>hexer</b>  creates a file <u>name</u><b>.hexer</b> in the current directory (the <b>swapfile</b>) for each
           buffer visited (where <u>name</u> is the name of the buffer).  All changes  made  to  the  buffer  <u>name</u>  are
           stored  in  that  file,  so it is possible to undo (and redo) all changes made to the buffer.  If the
           <b>swapfile</b> can't be created, the undo list is stored in the memory.

           <b>v</b>      Enter <b>Visual</b> <b>Mode</b> (see below).  Visual selection of areas.

           <b>w</b>      Move forward to the beginning of a word.

           <b>x</b>      Delete the byte under the cursor.  If a numeric argument <b>n</b> is given, <b>n</b> bytes are deleted.   In
                  <b>Visual</b>  <b>Mode</b>,  the  selected area is deleted.  <b>Note:</b> The bytes deleted using the <b>x</b>-command are
                  not copied to the kill buffer.

           <b>Control-X</b>
                  The same as the <b>x</b>-command, but the bytes deleted are copied to the kill buffer.

           <b>y</b>      Yank.  Yank the byte under the cursor into the kill buffer.  If a numeric argument <b>n</b> is given,
                  <b>n</b> bytes are yanked into the kill buffer.  In <b>Visual</b> <b>Mode</b>, the selected area is copied  to  the
                  kill buffer.

           <b>zb</b>     Place the cursor in the bottom line of the screen.

           <b>zt</b>     Place the cursor in the top line of the screen.

           <b>zz</b>     Place the cursor in the middle line of the screen.
                  Note  that  the commands <b>zb</b>, <b>zt</b> and <b>zz</b> don't change the position in the file - only the screen
                  is scrolled (if necessary).

           <b>:</b>      Enter <b>Exh</b> <b>Mode</b> (see below).  The <b>Exh</b> <b>Mode</b> is similar to the <b>ex</b>-mode in <b>vi</b>, but not compatible.
                  If an area is selected, the bounds of the selection are copied to the command line.

           <b>/</b>      Search forward through the buffer using a <b>RE</b>(<b>regular</b> <b>expression</b>).  If no <b>RE</b> is specified,  the
                  <b>RE</b> given in the previous <b>/</b>- or <b>?</b>-command is reused.
                  <b>Note:</b>  The <b>RE</b>s in <b>hexer</b> are a little bit different from regular expressions in <b>vi</b> (see section
                  <b>REGULAR</b> <b>EXPRESSIONS</b>).

           <b>?</b>      Search reverse using a regular expression.

           <b>.</b>      Repeat the last change to the buffer <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>position</b>.  This means that if the previous
                  command deleted <b>n</b> bytes and replaced them by <b>m</b> other bytes (<b>n</b> or <b>m</b> may be zero), the <b>.</b>-command
                  will do <b>exactly</b> the same at the current position in the file.

           <b>&lt;</b>      Shift the hex column left <b>n</b> bytes, where <b>n</b> is the (optional) numeric argument.  Note that  the
                  <b>&lt;</b>-command only changes the way the buffer is displayed in the hex column, the buffer itself is
                  kept unchanged.

           <b>&gt;</b>      Shift the hex column right <b>n</b> bytes.

           <b>Control-^</b>
                  Switch to the alternate buffer (see below).

           <b>%</b>      Enter a calculator command (see section <b>CALCULATOR</b>).

       <b>Visual</b> <b>Mode</b>
           Select  an area on the buffer.  You can enter the <b>Visual</b> <b>Mode</b> by using the <b>v</b>-command or by specifying
           an area in <b>Exh</b> <b>Mode</b>.  The selection starts at the cursor position when entering the <b>Visual</b>  <b>Mode</b>  and
           ends  at  the current cursor position.  You can leave the <b>Visual</b> <b>Mode</b> without performing a command on
           the selected area by pressing <b>v</b> or <b>Escape</b>.  To perform a command on the selected  area  simply  enter
           the  command  as if you where in <b>Command</b> <b>Mode</b>.  Commands that can't use the selection will ignore it.
           As in <b>Command</b> <b>Mode</b>, it is possible to specify  a  numeric  argument.   Commands  that  can  take  the
           selection as an argument will ignore the numeric argument.

       <b>Insert</b> <b>Mode</b>
           In  <b>Insert</b>  <b>Mode</b> the bytes you type are inserted at the current position of the cursor.  At any time,
           you can toggle the active column (hex column or text column) by pressing the <b>TAB</b>  key.   If  the  hex
           column  is  active  the bytes are entered as two digit hex numbers, if the text column is active, the
           bytes are entered as ASCII text.  The <b>Delete</b> or <b>BackSpace</b> key deletes the previously  inserted  byte.
           If  the  hex  column  is  active,  the  previously inserted nibble (hex digit) is deleted.  It is not
           possible to delete more bytes than have been inserted in the current insert command.  While in <b>Insert</b>
           <b>Mode</b>, you can move the cursor using the arrow keys.  Note that moving the cursor discards the numeric
           argument given to the insert command.  To leave the <b>Insert</b> <b>Mode</b>, type <b>Escape</b>.  If a numeric  argument
           <b>n</b>  was given to the insert command and is hasn't been discarded by a cursor movement, the typed bytes
           are inserted <b>n</b> times.

       <b>Replace</b> <b>Mode</b>
           In <b>Replace</b> <b>Mode</b> you replace the bytes under the cursor as you type.  Hitting <b>BackSpace</b>  restores  the
           original contents of the buffer.  The effect of a numeric argument is similar to the <b>Insert</b> <b>Mode</b>: the
           typed bytes are replaced <b>n</b> times.  As in <b>Insert</b> <b>Mode</b>, moving the cursor using the arrow keys discards
           the numeric argument.

       <b>Exh</b> <b>Mode</b>
           The <b>Exh</b> <b>Mode</b> in <b>hexer</b> is kept similar to the <b>ex</b>-mode in <b>vi</b>.  Typically, an <b>exh</b> command looks like:

           <b>:</b><u>area</u> <u>command</u> <u>arguments</u>
                  Perform the command <u>command</u> on the area <u>area</u>.

           <b>:</b><u>command</u> <u>arguments</u>
                  Perform the command <b>command</b> at the current position.

           <b>:</b><u>area</u>  Select the area <u>area</u>.

           <b>:</b><u>position</u>
                  Move the cursor to position <u>position</u>.

           An area may be defined as:

           <u>position1,position2</u>
                  The area starts at <u>position1</u> and ends at <u>position2</u> (inclusive).

           <u>position</u>
                  The area selects one byte at <u>position</u>

           <u>%</u>      The area selects the entire buffer.

           A position may be defined as:

           <u>offset</u> A decimal, octal (prefixed with `0') or hex (prefixed with `0x') number.

           <u>.</u>      The beginning of the buffer.

           <u>$</u>      The end of the buffer.

           /<u>regexp</u>/
                  A  regular  expression  (see  section  <b>REGULAR</b>  <b>EXPRESSIONS</b>).   The buffer is searched forward
                  starting at the current position.  If a match was found, the current position is  set  to  the
                  position of the match.

           ?<u>regexp</u>?
                  The buffer is searched reverse.

           Commands  may  be  abbreviated  with a unique prefix of the command, some commands may be abbreviated
           with a single character, even if that character isn't a unique prefix of the command name.  Currently
           the following commands are supported:

           <b>s,</b> <b>substitute</b>
                  <b>Synopsis:</b> <u>area</u> <b>s</b> /<u>regexp</u>/<u>replace</u>/<u>flags</u>
                  Search for the regular expression <u>regexp</u> and replace it  with  <u>replace</u>  (see  section  <b>REGULAR</b>
                  <b>EXPRESSIONS</b>).  <u>replace</u> may contain `\' references to subexpressions of regexp<u>.</u>  <u>flags</u>:

                  <b>g</b>:     global, this flag is ignored (it doesn't make sense in a binary editor).

                  <b>c</b>:     confirm, ask the user to confirm each substitution.

                  (Note  that  the  `/'  character  used  as  separator could be any character, it's just common
                  practice to use `/'.) Trailing separators may be omitted.   If  <u>area</u>  is  omitted,  the  whole
                  buffer is searched.

           <b>w,</b> <b>write</b>
                  <b>Synopsis:</b> <u>area</u> <b>w</b> <u>filename</u>
                  Write <u>area</u> to the file <u>filename</u>.  If <u>area</u> is omitted. the whole buffer is written to the file,
                  if <u>filename</u> is omitted, the filename associated with the buffer is used.

           <b>r,</b> <b>read</b>
                  <b>Synopsis:</b> <u>position</u> <b>r</b> <u>filename</u>
                  Insert  the  contents  of  the file <u>filename</u> at <u>position</u>.  If <u>position</u> is omitted, the current
                  position is used.

           <b>e,</b> <b>edit</b>
                  <b>Synopsis:</b> <b>e</b> <u>name</u> <b>or:</b> <b>e</b> <b>#</b>
                  Change to buffer <u>name</u>.  If there is no such buffer, <b>hexer</b> tries to open a file named <u>name</u>  and
                  load  it into a new buffer.  If <u>name</u> is a hash sign (<b>#</b>), the alternate buffer is selected.  On
                  success the current buffer becomes the alternate buffer.

           <b>b,</b> <b>buffer</b>
                  <b>Synopsis:</b> <b>b</b> <u>name</u>
                  <b>or:</b> <b>b</b>
                  Change to buffer <u>name</u>.  On success the current buffer becomes the alternate buffer.   If  <u>name</u>
                  is omitted, a list of all buffers is displayed.

           <b>n,</b> <b>next</b>
                  Select the next buffer in the buffer list.

           <b>N,</b> <b>previous</b>
                  Select the previous buffer in th buffer list.

           <b>S,</b> <b>skip</b>
                  Select the next unvisited buffer in the buffer list.

           <b>rewind</b> Select the first buffer in the buffer list.

           <b>wall</b>   Write all unsaved buffers.

           <b>c,</b> <b>close</b>
                  <b>Synopsis:</b> <b>c</b> <u>name</u>
                  <b>or:</b> <b>c!</b>  <u>name</u>
                  <b>or:</b> <b>c</b>
                  <b>or:</b> <b>c!</b>
                  Close  the  buffer <u>name</u>.  If <u>name</u> is omitted, the current buffer is closed.  If the buffer has
                  been modified, but not saved, it can't be closed using a <b>:c</b>-command; use <b>:c!</b>  to override.

           <b>h,</b> <b>help</b>
                  View an online help text.

           <b>q,</b> <b>quit</b>
                  <b>Synopsis:</b> <b>q</b> <u>name</u>
                  <b>or:</b> <b>q!</b>  <u>name</u>
                  <b>or:</b> <b>q</b>
                  <b>or:</b> <b>q!</b>
                  Close all buffers and exit the editor.  If an opened buffer has bee modified, but  not  saved,
                  the <b>:q</b>-command can't be performed; use <b>:q!</b>  to override.

           <b>map</b>

           <b>imap</b>

           <b>vmap</b>   <b>Synopsis:</b> <b>map</b> <u>from</u> <u>to</u>

                  <b>or:</b> <b>vmap</b> <u>from</u> <u>to</u>
                  The  key sequence <u>from</u> is mapped to <u>to</u>.  To enter special keys (e.g. function keys), mask them
                  using <b>Control-V</b>.  <b>:map</b> affects the <b>Command</b> <b>Mode</b> only, <b>:imap</b> affects the <b>Insert</b> <b>Mode</b>  only  and
                  <b>:vmap</b> affects the <b>Visual</b> <b>Mode</b> only.  It is not possible to re-map key sequences on the command
                  line editor.

                  <b>or:</b> <b>set</b>
                  There  are  not  too  many  variables  that  could be modified, this might change though.  The
                  following variables can be used: <b>iso</b> (bool):  display  the  whole  ISO-8859/1  character  set;
                  <b>ascii</b>  (bool):   display  ASCII  characters  only;  <b>TERM</b>  (string):  the name of the terminal;
                  <b>maxmatch</b> (number), <b>specialnl</b> (bool): see section <b>REGULAR</b> <b>EXPRESSIONS</b>.  <b>:set</b> called without  an
                  argument lists all variables and values.

                  <b>Synopsis:</b> <u>area</u> <b>d</b>
                  Delete all bytes in <u>area</u>.  The deleted bytes are copied to the kill buffer.

           <b>y,</b> <b>yank</b>
                  <b>Synopsis:</b> <u>area</u> <b>y</b>
                  Copy the bytes in <u>area</u> to the kill buffer.

           <b>version</b>
                  Display the version number of <b>hexer</b>.

           <b>zz</b>     Place  the  cursor  in  the  middle  line of the screen.  Note that the screen is scrolled (if
                  necessary); the cursor position is kept unchanged.

           <b>zt</b>     Place the cursor in the top line of the screen.

           <b>zb</b>     Place the cursor in the bottom line of the screen.

           <b>wq</b>     The same as <b>:x</b>.

           <b>x,</b> <b>exit</b>
                  Save all buffers and exit the editor.

           If a command is called and can't  use  the  given  positions,  areas  or  arguments,  the  additional
           positions, areas, arguments are ignored.
           <b>Conditional</b>  <b>commands:</b> It is possible to specify a list of terminal names for which the given command
           should be executed. The syntax is:
                  <b>:</b><u>terminals</u><b>:</b><u>command</u>
           where <u>terminals</u> is a colon-separated list of terminal names.  The command is executed if and only  if
           the value of <b>TERM</b> is in the list.  I.e. you could have a command like
                  <b>:xterm:set</b> <b>iso</b>
           in your <b>.hexerrc</b>-file (use the ISO character set only if working on an xterm).

       <b>Cursor</b> <b>Motion</b>
           In  <b>Command</b>  <b>Mode</b>, <b>Insert</b> <b>Mode</b>, <b>Replace</b> <b>Mode</b> and <b>Visual</b> <b>Mode</b>, you can use the following cursor motion
           commands:

           <b>Arrow</b> <b>Keys</b>
                  Move the cursor.

           <b>Control-F</b>
                  Move forward one page.

           <b>Control-B</b>
                  Move back one page.

           <b>Control-D</b>
                  Move forward half a page.

           <b>Control-U</b>
                  Move back half a page.

</pre><h4><b>COMMAND</b> <b>LINE</b> <b>EDITING</b></h4><pre>
       On the command line you can use the following commands:

       <b>UpArrow</b> <b>DownArrow</b>
              Move up and down through the history of the current context.

       <b>LeftArrow</b> <b>RightArrow</b>
              Move the cursor.

       <b>Control-A</b>
              Move the cursor to the beginning of the line.

       <b>Control-E</b>
              Move the cursor to the end of the line.

       <b>Control-K</b>
              Delete all characters from the current cursor position up to the end of the line.

       <b>Control-U</b>
              Delete all characters from the beginning of the line up to the current cursor position.

       <b>Delete</b>

       <b>BackSpace</b>
              Delete the character left of the cursor.

       <b>Control-D</b>
              Delete the character under the cursor.

       <b>Enter</b> <b>Return</b>
              Accept the line.

       <b>Escape</b> Discard the line.  <b>Note:</b> This is different from <b>vi</b>.

       <b>TAB</b>    Try to complete currently typed word.  If the completion is not unique, the word is  completed  as
              far  as  unique.   If  the  <b>TAB</b>  key  is  hit  twice on the same position,  a list of all possible
              completions is displayed.

</pre><h4><b>REGULAR</b> <b>EXPRESSIONS</b></h4><pre>
       In this section it is assumed that you are familiar with REs (regular expressions).  In most applications
       (<b>egrep</b>, <b>vi</b>, ...)  REs work on lines, that means it is not possible to use a RE containing  a  line  break
       (newline character).  In <b>hexer</b>, the buffer is not split up into distinct lines and a newline character is
       considered  to  be  a  `normal' character, now here's the problem: imagine searching for "a.*b" in a 5 MB
       file, this would take very long (might be up to several minutes on a slow machine).  That's why there's a
       <b>maxmatch</b> limit (a repeat operator matches at most <b>maxmatch</b> occurrences  of  its  operand).   The  default
       value  of  <b>maxmatch</b>  is  1024,  but  it may be customized using the <b>:set</b>-command.  For simple expressions
       (expressions for which the length of the match can be determined from the expression) it is  possible  to
       override the <b>maxmatch</b> limit by doubling the `*' or `+' operator, e.g. "a.**b" or "foo\(bar\)\+\+".
       Note  that  the  context  specifiers  `^'/`$' (beginning/end of a line) and `\&lt;'/`\&gt;' (beginning/end of a
       word) are available and actually do what you expect.  If you don't want the atoms  `.'  and  `[^...]'  to
       match the newline character you can set the <b>specialnl</b> option using the <b>:set</b>-command.
       To  enter  a  special  character,  you can use the standard C `\'‐escape sequences.  To enter a character
       using its octal code, use a `\o'‐prefix followed by up to three octal digits.  (C-style octal escapes are
       not supported, because `\0', ... `\9' are interpreted as back-references to subexpressions  of  the  RE.)
       To  enter  a  character using it's hex code, type a `\x'-prefix followed by up to two hex digits; decimal
       codes can be entered using a `\d'‐prefix followed by up to three decimal digits.  It is possible to enter
       strings of codes by doubling the base specifier, e.g. "\xxfe ff 5a 7e" or "\oo276  277  132  176".   Note
       that  such  a  string  is treated as an atom, i.e.  the RE "\xxff fe*" matches any number (&lt; <b>maxmatch</b>) of
       repetitions of <b>ff</b> <b>fe</b>.
       It is possible to use all kinds of character `\'‐escapes (escapes representing a single character) within
       `[]'‐ranges.  Within a range, the `o' selecting an octal base for the escape may be omitted, since  back-
       references  within  a  range  don't  make  sense.   When  specifying  a  minimum and/or maximum number of
       repetitions using  the  `\{,}'‐operator,  the  numbers  may  be  given  in  decimal  (no  prefix),  octal
       (`0'-prefix)  or  hex  (`0x'-prefix).   If no maximum number is specified and the operand is not a simple
       expression, at most <b>maxmatch</b> matches will be found.

</pre><h4><b>CALCULATOR</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Hexer</b> provides a simple calculator (<b>myc</b>) capable of all operations  available  in  C.   To  enter  a  <b>myc</b>
       command  just  enter  a  <b>%</b>  (percent)  sign  and  an expression in infix notation.  It is possible to use
       parentheses.  <b>myc</b> understands the following binary infix operators (from highest priority to lowest):  <b>**</b>
       (power),  <b>*</b> (multiply), <b>/</b> (divide), <b>%</b> (modulo), <b>+</b> (add), <b>-</b> (subtract), <b>&lt;&lt;</b> (shift left), <b>&gt;&gt;</b> (shift right),
       <b>&lt;</b> (less), <b>&lt;=</b> (less or equal), <b>&gt;</b> (greater),  <b>&gt;=</b>  (greater  or  equal),  <b>==</b>  (equal),  <b>!=</b>  (not  equal),  <b>&amp;</b>
       (arithmetical  and),  <b>|</b>  (arithmetical  or), <b>^</b> (arithmetical exclusive or), <b>&amp;&amp;</b> (logical and), <b>||</b> (logical
       or), <b>=</b> (assign);  and the following unary prefix operators: <b>-</b> (negate, unary minus), <b>!</b>  (logical not),  <b>~</b>
       (bitwise  complement).   <b>myc</b> knows three data types: <b>boolean</b>, <b>integer</b> (32 bit), <b>float</b> (64 bit, equivalent
       to C double).  On some esoteric platforms the precision of integer and float may be different.  As  in  C
       the  result  of  a  division depends on the data types of the operands.  An integer divided by an integer
       yields an integer.  If you want the result to be a float, make sure one of the operands is a float,  e.g.
       type <u>4/7.</u>  instead of <u>4/7</u> or <u>a/(b+0.)</u>  instead of <u>a/b</u>.  The power operation returns a float if the result
       is too large to fit in an integer.  The result of a calculation is stored in the special variables <b>$$</b> and
       <b>$</b><u>n</u> where <u>n</u> is the number of the command.
