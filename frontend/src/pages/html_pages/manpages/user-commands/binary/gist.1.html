</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       gist - browse binary cgm graphics files

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>gist</b> [[ -in ] <u>cgmfile</u> ] [ <u>page-number-list</u> ] [ <u>options</u> ]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Gist</u> is a binary CGM (Computer Graphics Metafile) browser.  It reads an input <u>cgmfile</u> and produces output
       to the X window system, PostScript files (which can be printed using <a href="../man1/lpr.1.html">lpr</a>(1)), or another binary CGM file.
       The  <u>cgmfile</u>  may be a family of CGMs; a family is recognized whenever the final one or two characters of
       the filenames (excluding an  optional  trailing  ".cgm")  are  digits  in  a  numerical  sequence  (e.g.-
       myfile00.cgm,  myfile01.cgm,  myfile02.cgm, etc.).  In this case, the <u>cgmfile</u> argument should be the name
       of the first file in the family; gist will automatically  hop  back  and  forth  from  file  to  file  as
       necessary.   (A  single page must not be split across files, and each file must be a legal CGM in its own
       right.)  When gist opens a CGM for input, it must catalog the pages in the file by scanning  through  the
       file  to  find  them.  This cataloguing operation takes place in the background while gist waits for your
       input.  Therefore, if you open a large family of CGMs, gist will be able to display the first  few  pages
       immediately,  but if you ask for the last few pages, you will have to wait until the catalog is complete.
       After gist has catalogued the input family, you can render any page without delay.

   <b>Options</b>
       -in <u>cgmfile</u>         The -in is necessary if and only if the cgmfile name begins with a digit or - sign.

       -ps <u>psout</u>           to specify a PostScript output file.

       -cgm <u>cgmout</u>         to specify a binary CGM output file.

       -display <u>host:server.screen</u>
                           to specify an X server connection.  If this option is not given, gist  will  use  the
                           DISPLAY environment variable.

       -75                 create window(s) at 75 dpi (small window)

       -100                create window(s) at 100 dpi (large window, default)

       -geometry <u>WxH</u>       create window(s) with specified width and height (in pixels)

       -gks                create  window(s)  at  8x8 inches (default 6x6).  If your cgm file was NOT created by
                           <a href="../man1/yorick.1.html">yorick</a>(1), this may be a better guess at an appropriate window size.   You  can  also
                           resize the gist window using your window manager or -geometry.

       -nd                 to  suppress  the  automatic  display  of  the  first  picture  when  gist  starts in
                           interactive mode

       -b                  to run in batch mode (either -cgm or -ps must also be specified, implies -nd)

       -f                  to run in filter mode, placing PostScript output on stdout (implies -b)

       -x                  to run as a pure X window program (no keyboard)

       -fmbug              to compensate for a bug in FrameMaker, reverse the EPS preview top-for-bottom in  EPS
                           files.   But  I  recommend  using  <a href="../man1/ghostscript.1.html">ghostscript</a>(1)  from project GNU to convert gist's
                           PostScript output files into EPS files instead of gist's  EPS  command,  which  makes
                           much cruder preview images.

       -bg0fg1             commercial packages which produce CGM files may use color index 0 to mean background,
                           index 1 to mean foreground, despite their own palette -- this switch compensates

       -nowarn             suppress all but first warning message

   <b>Page-number-list</b>
       is any number of space-delimited list elements; each element has one of the following forms:

       <u>m</u>                   just page m

       <u>m-n</u>                 pages m through n, inclusive

       <u>m-n-s</u>               pages  m  through  n  in  steps of s Using m&lt;=0 or n&gt;=total number of pages is legal,
                           causing the loop to terminate at the end-of-file (or end-of-file-family)

       Thus, pages 3, 5, 7, 9, 31, and 17 through 26 (in that order) would be specified as:
        3-9-2 31 17-26

       A page number list on the command line is most useful in conjunction with the -b or -f options.

   <b>Commands</b>
       Unless the -b or -f options were specified, gist expects further commands from the keyboard, or typed  in
       its X window.  Keyboard commands are:

       open <u>cgmfile</u>        open  a  new CGM for input, closing the current input CGM.  This has no effect on any
                           output device.

       quit                finish and close any output files, then exit.  Synonyms for the quit command are exit
                           and end.

       cgm <u>cgmout</u> [<u>size</u>]   create a new output CGM.  If size is specified, the file will be split into a  family
                           whose  members  are  about  that size in bytes as more frames are added.  The default
                           family member size is four megabytes.

       ps <u>psout</u>            create a new output PostScript file.  The <a href="../man1/lpr.1.html">lpr</a>(1) utility can print PostScript files.

       display <u>host:server.screen</u> [<u>dpi</u>]
                           create a new output X window.  The dpi (dots per inch) can  be  either  75  (a  small
                           window), or 100 (a large window, the default).

       draw [<u>page-number-list</u>]
                           render the specified pages on the "drawing" devices (X windows by default).

       send [<u>page-number-list</u>]
                           render  the  specified  pages  on the "sending" devices (PostScript files and CGMs by
                           default).

       info                list current output devices and their states.  Also prints the current input CGM  and
                           page number.

       draw to <u>dev1</u> [<u>dev2</u>...]
                           specify  "drawing"  devices; dev1, dev2, etc., are device numbers printed by the info
                           command.  By default, X windows are the "drawing" devices.

       send to <u>dev1</u> [<u>dev2</u>...]
                           specify "sending" devices; dev1, dev2, etc., are device numbers printed by  the  info
                           command.  By default, PostScript files and CGMs are the "sending" devices.

       free <u>dev1</u> [<u>dev2</u> ...]
                           close  the  output  file or X window; dev1, dev2, etc., are device numbers printed by
                           the info command.

       eps <u>epsout</u>          create an encapsulated PostScript file, render the current page there, then close it.
                           This command is provided only  for  sites  without  the  project  GNU  <a href="../man1/ghostscript.1.html">ghostscript</a>(1)
                           program.  Ghostscript's ps2epsi command produces an infinitely better preview bitmap.
                           If you are interested in this command, get ghostscript; it's free software.

       help [<u>topic</u>]        prints a summary of these commands.  If specified, topic is one of the command names;
                           gist prints a more detailed description of that command.

       Any  of  these  commands  may be abbreviated to the shortest part of their name which is unique -- dr for
       draw, s for send, etc.

       The following commands may be typed either in a gist X window or at the keyboard  prompt.   The  <u>n</u>  is  a
       prefix consisting of zero or more digits; if you do not specify <u>n</u> the default is always 1.

       <u>n</u>f    advance <u>n</u> pages and draw

       <u>n</u>b    back up <u>n</u> pages and draw

       <u>n</u>g    go to page <u>n</u> and draw

       s     send the current page to all "sending" devices

       q     quit

       If  the -x option is specified on the command line, gist can be run in the background like other X window
       programs.  In this case, <u>only</u> the window commands will be recognized.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       To print every page of a CGM file family myfile00.cgm:
        gist myfile00.cgm -f | lpr
       To print only pages 3, 5, 7, 9, 31, and 17 through 26 (in that order):
        gist myfile00.cgm 3-9-2 31 17-26 -f | lpr

       To start gist as a pure X window program, with output to PostScript file myfile.ps:
        gist myfile00.cgm -ps myfile.ps -x &amp;
       Type the f, b or g commands in the gist graphics window to navigate  through  myfile00.cgm.   Use  the  s
       command to write the current page into myfile.ps; the q command quits.

       To use gist on foreign.cgm which was not generated by Yorick, try:
        gist -75 -gks -bg0fg1 foreign.cgm

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       Y_SITE  refers  to  the Yorick site directory; use the help command in <a href="../man1/yorick.1.html">yorick</a>(1) to find its name at your
       site:

       Y_SITE/gist/*            graphics style sheets, palettes, and PostScript template

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Gist is designed to convert <a href="../man1/yorick.1.html">yorick</a>(1) binary CGM  output  files  into  PostScript  perfectly.   That  is,
       running  a yorick binary CGM through gist will produce exactly the same PostScript file (and X window) as
       yorick would have produced directly.

       However, the ANSI CGM standard is not a page description language like PostScript.  Therefore, non-yorick
       CGMs may or may not be acceptably rendered by Gist.  The -gks and -bg0fg1 options may help, but  you  can
       expect  fonts,  polymarkers,  and  line  styles  to look different with Gist than with other CGM browsers
       (.e.g- idt from NCAR graphics).

       If gist cannot find the PostScript template Y_SITE/gist/ps.ps, PostScript output will not work.

       You can't use multiple X windows to compare two different pages (they all display the same page).   Start
       a second copy of gist.

       On  pseudocolor displays, a color image may require you to move the mouse into gist's X window to display
       properly.  Unless your window manager allows you to set colormap focus independently of  keyboard  focus,
       this can be annoying.
