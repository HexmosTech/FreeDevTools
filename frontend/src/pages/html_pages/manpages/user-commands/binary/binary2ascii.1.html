</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       binary2ascii - Convert binary numbers to textual representation

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>binary2ascii</b> <b>[flags]</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>binary2ascii</u>  reads input consisting of binary numbers and converts them to their textual representation.
       Command line flags specify the type and size of the binary numbers and provide control over the format of
       the output. Unsigned integers may be written out  in  binary,  octal,  decimal,  or  hexadecimal.  Signed
       integers may be written out only in binary or decimal.  Floating point numbers may be written out only in
       decimal,  either in standard or scientific notation. (If you want to examine the binary representation of
       floating point numbers, just treat the input as a sequence of unsigned characters.)

</pre><h4><b>COMMAND</b> <b>LINE</b> <b>FLAGS</b></h4><pre>
       Long options may not be available on some systems.

       -b,--base &lt;base&gt;
              Base for integer conversions: b(binary),d(ecimal), h(exadecimal), o(ctal), or 2,8,10, or 16.

       -d,--delimit
              Delimit the output as per the locale. This is the default on systems in which  <u><a href="../man3/printf.3.html">printf</a>(3)</u>  supports
              delimitation. If delimitation is not enabled, floating point numbers will have a decimal point and
              no  separation  of  groups, integers no delimiters at all. With this option, the decimal separator
              will be chosen according to the locale (which, for  example,  may  make  it  a  comma),  and  non-
              fractional  digits  will  be grouped and separated according to the rules for the locale in force.
              For American English, this means groups of three digits separated by commas, whereas for German in
              Germany it means groups of three digits separated by periods.

       -D,--do-not-delimit
              Do not delimit the output as per the <u>-d</u> option.

       -e,--exponential
              Use exponential (scientific) notation.

       -h,--help
              print help message

       -l,--linefeed
              add a linefeed after every 0x0A value if the size is char, short, int, or long, that is, the sizes
              that might represent a character.

       -L,locale &lt;locale&gt;
              Set the LC_NUMERIC facet of the locale to &lt;locale&gt;.

       -n,--number &lt;number&gt;
              number of items to print per line.

       -o,--offset &lt;offset&gt;
              byte offset at which to start.

       -p,--precision &lt;precision&gt;
              the precision to use when printing floating point numbers.

       -s,--sizes
              print sizes of types on current machine and related information

       -t,--type &lt;type&gt;
              set type and size of input

       -x,--no-hex-mark
              do not mark hexadecimal output with the prefix 0x.

       -V,--verbose
              be verbose.

       -v,--version
              print version information.

       -w,--width
              minimum field width.

       -X,--explain-exit-codes
              print a summary of the exit status codes.

       -z,--zero-pad-integers
              zero pad on left.

       -Z,--do-not-zero-pad-integers
              do not zero pad on left

</pre><h4><b>INPUT</b> <b>TYPES</b></h4><pre>
       The following are the possible input types. Note that some types may not be available on some machines.

       d  double

       f  float

       q long double

       sc signed char

       ss signed short

       si signed int

       sl signed long

       sq signed long long

       uc unsigned char

       us unsigned short

       ui unsigned int

       ul unsigned long

       uq unsigned long long

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       The following values are returned on exit:

       0 SUCCESS
              The input was successfully converted.

       1 INFO The user requested information such as the version number or usage  synopsis  and  this  has  been
              provided.

       2 SYSTEM ERROR
              An  error  resulted  from  a  failure of the operating system such as an i/o error or inability to
              allocate storage.

       3 COMMAND LINE ERROR
              The program was called with invalid or inconsistent command line flags.

       5 INPUT ERROR
              This means that the input was ill-formed, that is that it could not be interpreted as a number  of
              the  required type. For example, if the input is 0x2A and a decimal value is called for,  an INPUT
              ERROR will be returned since 0x2A is not a valid representation of a decimal integer.
