</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       sfwbar-bluez - Sfwbar Bluez module

       Filename: bluez.so

       Requires: none

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       The bluez module provides an interface to connect and disconnect bluetooth devices via the bluez server.

</pre><h4><b>EXPRESSION</b> <b>FUNCTIONS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>BluezGet(Property)</b>
       function  BluezGet  fetches a property for a currently advertized bluez device.  The supported properties
       are:

       <b>"Path"</b> an object path of the device, this is used as a unique id to provide notifivations of  changes  or
              destruction of the device.

       <b>"RemovedPath"</b>
              an  object  path  of  the  most  recently  removed  device. This is populated upon emission of the
              "bluez_removed" trigger.

       <b>"Address"</b>
              a bluetooth address of the device

       <b>"Name"</b> a name of the device

       <b>"Icon"</b> an icon for the device type

   <b>BluezState(Property)</b>
       function BluezState fetches a boolean state property  of  the  currently  advertized  bluez  device.  The
       supported properties are:

       <b>"Paired"</b>
              specifies whether the device is paired to the adapter

       <b>"Trusted"</b>
              specifies whether the device is trusted by the adapter

       <b>"Connected"</b>
              specifies whether the device is connected to the adpater

       <b>"Running"</b>
              queries the global state of the bluez module. If the module is connected to the server and sees at
              least one bluetooth adapter, this query will return true. Otherwise it will return false.

</pre><h4><b>ACTIONS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>BluezScan</b> <b>&lt;Duration&gt;</b>
       Initiate scan for the bluetooth devices. The scan will last for the duration specified in milliseconds.

   <b>BluezAck</b>
       Notify the module that all information for the currently advertized device has been processed. The module
       may then emit another bluez_changed event if further device updates are available.

   <b>BluezAckRemoved</b>
       Notify  the  module  that all information for the currently advertized device removal has been processed.
       The module may then emit another bluez_removed event if further device removals are queued.

   <b>BluezConnect</b> <b>&lt;path&gt;</b>
       Attempt to connect to the bluetooth device specified by the path.

   <b>BluezPair</b> <b>&lt;path&gt;</b>
       Attempt to pair and connect to the bluetooth device specified by the path.

   <b>BluezDisconnect</b> <b>&lt;path&gt;</b>
       Attempt to diconnect from the bluetooth device specified by the path.

   <b>BluezRemove</b> <b>&lt;path&gt;</b>
       Attempt to remove  the bluetooth device specified by the path.

</pre><h4><b>TRIGGERS</b></h4><pre>
       The module defines the following triggers:

       <b>"bluez_running"</b>
              this trigger is emitted when connected to the first  bluetooth  adapter  has  been  made  or  when
              connection  to  the  last adapter is lost (i.e.  when the value of BluezState("Running") query has
              changed)

       <b>"bluez_changed"</b>
              this trigger is emitted when a new bluetooth device is discovered or properties of  a  device  are
              changed.  Once  the  trigger is emitted, the information for the relevant device will be available
              via BluezGet and BluezState expression functions. Once the config  finished  handling  the  device
              update,  it  should  call  action  BluezAck.  Upon  receipt  of  this  action, the module may emit
              "bluez_changed" again if further device updates are queued.

       <b>"bluez_removed"</b>
              this trigger is emitted when a bluetooth device is no longer available and should be removed  from
              the  layout.  The  path  of  the removed device is available via BluezGet("RemovedPath"). Once the
              config finished removing the device, it should call action BluezAckRemoved. Upon receipt  of  this
              action, the module may emit another "bluez_removed" trigger if further devices have been removed.

       <b>"bluez_scan"</b>
              this trigger is emitted when scan for bluetooth devices has been initiated.

       <b>"bluez_scan_complete"</b>
              this trigger is emitted when scan for bluetooth devices is complete.
