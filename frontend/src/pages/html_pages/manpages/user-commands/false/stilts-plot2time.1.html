</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>plot2time</u> draws plots where the horizontal axis represents time. The time axis can be labelled in various
       different ways including MJD, decimal year and ISO-8601 form.

       Positional  coordinates are specified as <u>t</u>, <u>y</u> pairs, with an optional <u>ttype</u> specifier to indicate how the
       input value is to be interpreted, e.g.: plot2time in1=series.fits layer1=line t1=EPOCH ttype1=MJD  y1=EN‐
       ERGY

       Time values can be represented in various ways in input data, for instance as Julian Day, Modified Julian
       Date,  decimal  years since 0AD, Unix seconds, ISO-8601, or variants of some of the above with additional
       offsets. In some cases the input format contains enough metadata to determine how the  values  should  be
       mapped to a common timescale (so for instance they can be plotted as MJD or Year/Month/Day), and in other
       cases  they  do  not.  For example CDF files and VOTable 1.4 files with <u>TIMESYS</u> markup contain sufficient
       metadata, and text inputs using the ISO-8601 format can usually be identified and understood, but there's
       no way to tell automatically whether a numeric column in a CSV file represents MJD, seconds since a known
       epoch, decimal years, or anything else. For this reason the <u>ttypeN</u> parameter is provided for all the lay‐
       er types with a <u>tN</u> coordinate, as follows:

       <u>ttypeN</u> <u>=</u> <u>DecYear|MJD|JD|Unix|Iso8601</u>       (TimeMapper) Selects the form in which the Time value for pa‐
       rameter <u>tN</u> is supplied. Options are:

         * <u>DecYear</u>: Years since 0 AD

         * <u>MJD</u>: Modified Julian Date

         * <u>JD</u>: Julian Day

         * <u>Unix</u>: Seconds since midnight 1 Jan 1970

         * <u>Iso8601</u>: ISO 8601 string
        If left blank, a guess will be taken depending on the data type of the value supplied for the <u>tN</u> value.

       This command, unlike the other <u>plot2*</u> commands at time of writing, can be used to draw multi-zone  plots.
       These  are  plots  with different panels stacked vertically so that different datasets can share the same
       horizontal (time) axis, but have separate vertical axes, colour maps, legends etc.  The  horizontal  axes
       are  always  synchronized  between  zones. This is currently controlled with the <u>zoneN</u> parameter. For any
       layer with a layer suffix <u>N</u>, you can specify a zone identifier as an arbitrary string,  <u>Z</u>,  by  supplying
       the  parameter <u>zoneN=Z</u>. Layers with the same value of <u>zoneN</u> are plotted in the same zone, and layers with
       different values are plotted in different zones. If no <u>zoneN</u> is given, the layer is assigned to a  single
       (unnamed)  zone,  so with no zone parameters specified all plots appear in a single zone. Parameters spe‐
       cific to a given zone can then be suffixed with the same <u>Z</u> zone identifier. The examples  section  illus‐
       trates what this looks like in practice.

       <b>Note:</b> The multi-zone feature is experimental. As currently implemented it lacks some features. The inter‐
       face may be changed in a future version.

       Content is added to the plot by specifying one or more plot layers using the <u>layerN</u> parameter. The <u>N</u> part
       is  a  suffix  applied  to  all  the  parameters affecting a given layer; any suffix (including the empty
       string) may be used. Available layers for this plot type are:  <u>line</u>,  <u>linearfit</u>,  <u>mark</u>,  <u>fill</u>,  <u>quantile</u>,
       <u>grid</u>, <u>histogram</u>, <u>kde</u>, <u>knn</u>, <u>densogram</u>, <u>gaussian</u>, <u>yerror</u>, <u>spectrogram</u>, <u>label</u>, <u>function</u>.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>xpix=</b><u>&lt;int-value&gt;</u>
              Size  of  the  output image in the X direction in pixels. This includes space for any axis labels,
              padding and other decoration outside the plot area itself. See also <u>insets</u>.

       <b>ypix=</b><u>&lt;int-value&gt;</u>
              Size of the output image in the Y direction in pixels. This includes space for  any  axis  labels,
              padding and other decoration outside the plot area itself. See also <u>insets</u>.

       <b>insets=</b><u>&lt;top&gt;,&lt;left&gt;,&lt;bottom&gt;,&lt;right&gt;</u>
              Defines the amount of space in pixels around the actual plotting area. This space is used for axis
              labels, and other decorations and any left over forms an empty border.

              The  size and position of the actual plotting area is determined by this parameter along with <u>xpix</u>
              and <u>ypix</u>.

              The value of this parameter is 4 comma separated integers: <u>&lt;top&gt;,&lt;left&gt;,&lt;bottom&gt;,&lt;right&gt;</u>.  Any  or
              all  of  these values may be left blank, in which case the corresponding margin will be calculated
              automatically according to how much space is required.

       <b>omode=</b><u>swing|out|cgi|discard|auto</u>
              Determines how the drawn plot will be output, see SUN/256.

                * <u>swing</u>: Plot will be displayed in a window on the screen. This plot is "live"; it  can  be  re‐
                  sized  and (except for old-style plots) navigated around with mouse actions in the same way as
                  plots in TOPCAT.

                * <u>out</u>: Plot will be written to a file given by <u>out</u> using the graphics format given by <u>ofmt</u>.

                * <u>cgi</u>: Plot will be written in a way suitable for CGI use direct from a web server.  The  output
                  is in the graphics format given by <u>ofmt</u>, preceded by a suitable "Content-type" declaration.

                * <u>discard</u>: Plot is drawn, but discarded. There is no output.

                * <u>auto</u>: Behaves as <u>swing</u> or <u>out</u> mode depending on presence of <u>out</u> parameter

       <b>storage=</b><u>simple|memory|disk|policy|cache|basic-cache|persistent|parallel</u>
              Determines  the  way that data is accessed when constructing the plot. There are two main options,
              cached or not. If no caching is used then rows are read sequentially from the specified input  ta‐
              ble(s)  every  time  they are required. This generally requires a small resource footprint (though
              that can depend on how the table is specified) and makes sense  if  the  data  only  needs  to  be
              scanned  once  or perhaps if the table is very large. If caching is used then the required data is
              read once from the specified input table(s), then prepared and cached before any plotting is  per‐
              formed,  and  plots  are done using this cached data. This may use a significant amount of storage
              for large tables but it's usually more sensible (faster) if the data will need to be scanned  mul‐
              tiple times. There are various options for cache storage.

              The options are:

                * <u>simple</u>: no caching, data read directly from input table

                * <u>memory</u>: cached to memory; OutOfMemoryError possible for very large plots

                * <u>disk</u>: cached to disk

                * <u>policy</u>: cached using application-wide default storage policy, which is usually adaptive (memo‐
                  ry/disk hybrid)

                * <u>persistent</u>:  cached to persistent files on disk, in the system temporary directory (defined by
                  system property <u>java.io.tmpdir</u>). If this is used, plot data will be stored on disk  in  a  way
                  that  means they can be re-used between STILTS invocations, so data preparation can be avoided
                  on subsequent runs. Note however it can leave potentially large files in your temporary direc‐
                  tory.

                * <u>cache</u>: synonym for <u>memory</u> (backward compatibility)

                * <u>basic-cache</u>: dumber version of <u>memory</u> (no optimisation for constant-valued columns)

                * <u>parallel</u>: experimental version of memory-based cache that reads into the cache in parallel for
                  large files. This will make the plot faster to prepare, but interaction is a  bit  slower  and
                  sequence-dependent attributes of the plot may not come out right. This experimental option may
                  be withdrawn or modified in future releases.

              The  default  value  is <u>memory</u> if a live plot is being generated (<u>omode=swing</u>), since in that case
              the plot needs to be redrawn every time the user performs plot navigation actions or  resizes  the
              window,  or  if  animations are being produced. Otherwise (e.g. output to a graphics file) the de‐
              fault is <u>simple</u>.

       <b>seq=</b><u>&lt;suffix&gt;[,...]</u>
              Contains a comma-separated list of layer suffixes to determine the order in which layers are drawn
              on the plot. This can affect which symbol are plotted on top of, and so potentially obscure, which
              other ones.

              When specifying a plot, multiple layers may be specified, each introduced by a parameter <u>layer&lt;N&gt;</u>,
              where <u>&lt;N&gt;</u> is a different (arbitrary) suffix labelling the layer, and is appended to all the  para‐
              meters specific to defining that layer.

              By  default the layers are drawn on the plot in the order in which the <u>layer*</u> parameters appear on
              the command line. However if this parameter is specified, each comma-separated element  is  inter‐
              preted  as  a  layer  suffix, giving the ordered list of layers to plot. Every element of the list
              must be a suffix with a corresponding <u>layer</u> parameter, but missing or repeated  elements  are  al‐
              lowed.

       <b>legend=</b><u>true|false</u>
              Whether  to  draw  a legend or not. If no value is supplied, the decision is made automatically: a
              legend is drawn only if it would have more than one entry.

       <b>legborder=</b><u>true|false</u>
              If true, a line border is drawn around the legend.

       <b>legopaque=</b><u>true|false</u>
              If true, the background of the legend is opaque, and the legend obscures any plot  components  be‐
              hind it. Otherwise, it's transparent.

       <b>legseq=</b><u>&lt;suffix&gt;[,...]</u>
              Determines which layers are represented in the legend (if present) and in which order they appear.
              The legend has a line for each layer label (as determined by the <u>leglabelN</u> parameter). If multiple
              layers have the same label, they will contribute to the same entry in the legend, with style icons
              plotted  over  each other. The value of this parameter is a comma-separated sequence of layer suf‐
              fixes, which determines the order in which the legend entries appear. Layers with suffixes missing
              from this list do not show up in the legend at all.

              If no value is supplied (the default), the sequence is the same as  the  layer  plotting  sequence
              (see <u>seq</u>).

       <b>legpos=</b><u>&lt;xfrac,yfrac&gt;</u>
              Determines the internal position of the legend on the plot. The value is a comma-separated pair of
              values  giving  the  X  and  Y positions of the legend within the plotting bounds, so for instance
              "<u>0.5,0.5</u>" will put the legend right in the middle of the plot. If no value is supplied, the legend
              will appear outside the plot boundary.

              If a zone suffix is appended to the parameter name, only that zone is affected, e.g.  <u>legposZ</u>  af‐
              fects only zone <u>Z</u>.

       <b>title=</b><u>&lt;value&gt;</u>
              Text  of  a  title to be displayed at the top of the plot. If null, the default, no title is shown
              and there's more space for the graphics.

              If a zone suffix is appended to the parameter name, only that zone is affected,  e.g.  <u>titleZ</u>  af‐
              fects only zone <u>Z</u>.

       <b>auxmap=</b><u>&lt;map-name&gt;|&lt;color&gt;-&lt;color&gt;[-&lt;color&gt;...]</u>
              Color map used for Aux axis shading.

              A  mixed  bag of colour ramps are available as listed in SUN/256: <u>inferno</u>, <u>magma</u>, <u>plasma</u>, <u>viridis</u>,
              <u>cividis</u>, <u>cubehelix</u>, <u>sron</u>, <u>rainbow</u>, <u>rainbow2</u>, <u>rainbow3</u>, <u>pastel</u>, <u>cosmic</u>, <u>ember</u>, <u>gothic</u>,  <u>rainforest</u>,
              <u>voltage</u>, <u>bubblegum</u>, <u>gem</u>, <u>chroma</u>, <u>sunset</u>, <u>neon</u>, <u>tropical</u>, <u>accent</u>, <u>gnuplot</u>, <u>gnuplot2</u>, <u>specxby</u>, <u>set1</u>,
              <u>paired</u>,  <u>hotcold</u>,  <u>guppy</u>, <u>iceburn</u>, <u>redshift</u>, <u>pride</u>, <u>rdbu</u>, <u>piyg</u>, <u>brbg</u>, <u>cyan-magenta</u>, <u>red-blue</u>, <u>brg</u>,
              <u>heat</u>, <u>cold</u>, <u>light</u>, <u>greyscale</u>, <u>colour</u>, <u>standard</u>, <u>bugn</u>, <u>bupu</u>, <u>orrd</u>, <u>pubu</u>, <u>purd</u>, <u>painbow</u>, <u>huecl</u>,  <u>in‐</u>
              <u>finity</u>,  <u>hue</u>,  <u>intensity</u>,  <u>rgb_red</u>, <u>rgb_green</u>, <u>rgb_blue</u>, <u>hsv_h</u>, <u>hsv_s</u>, <u>hsv_v</u>, <u>yuv_y</u>, <u>yuv_u</u>, <u>yuv_v</u>,
              <u>scale_hsv_s</u>, <u>scale_hsv_v</u>, <u>scale_yuv_y</u>, <u>mask</u>, <u>blacker</u>, <u>whiter</u>, <u>transparency</u>. Note: many  of  these,
              including rainbow-like ones, are frowned upon by the visualisation community.

              You  can  also construct your own custom colour map by giving a sequence of colour names separated
              by minus sign ("<u>-</u>") characters. In this case the ramp is a linear interpolation between each  pair
              of  colours  named, using the same syntax as when specifying a colour value. So for instance "<u>yel‐</u>
              <u>low-hotpink-#0000ff</u>" would shade from yellow via hot pink to blue.

              If a zone suffix is appended to the parameter name, only that zone is affected, e.g.  <u>auxmapZ</u>  af‐
              fects only zone <u>Z</u>.

       <b>auxclip=</b><u>&lt;lo&gt;,&lt;hi&gt;</u>
              Defines  a  subrange  of  the  colour ramp to be used for Aux shading. The value is specified as a
              (low,high) comma-separated pair of two numbers between 0 and 1.

              If the full range <u>0,1</u> is used, the whole range of colours specified by the selected shader will be
              used. But if for instance a value of <u>0,0.5</u> is given, only those colours at the left  hand  end  of
              the ramp will be seen.

              If  the null (default) value is chosen, a default clip will be used. This generally covers most or
              all of the range 0-1 but for colour maps which fade to white, a small proportion of the lower  end
              may  be  excluded,  to ensure that all the colours are visually distinguishable from a white back‐
              ground. This default is usually a good idea if the colour map is being used with something like  a
              scatter  plot, where markers are plotted against a white background. However, for something like a
              density map when the whole plotting area is tiled with colours from the map, it may be  better  to
              supply the whole range <u>0,1</u> explicitly.

              If  a zone suffix is appended to the parameter name, only that zone is affected, e.g. <u>auxclipZ</u> af‐
              fects only zone <u>Z</u>.

       <b>auxflip=</b><u>true|false</u>
              If true, the colour map on the Aux axis will be reversed.

              If a zone suffix is appended to the parameter name, only that zone is affected, e.g. <u>auxflipZ</u>  af‐
              fects only zone <u>Z</u>.

       <b>auxquant=</b><u>&lt;number&gt;</u>
              Allows  the colour map used for the Aux axis to be quantised. If an integer value N is chosen then
              the colour map will be viewed as N discrete evenly-spaced levels, so that only N different colours
              will appear in the plot. This can be used to generate a contour-like effect, and may make it easi‐
              er to trace the boundaries of regions of interest by eye.

              If left blank, the colour map is nominally continuous (though in practice it may be quantised to a
              medium-sized number like 256).

              If a zone suffix is appended to the parameter name, only that zone is affected, e.g. <u>auxquantZ</u> af‐
              fects only zone <u>Z</u>.

       <b>auxfunc=</b><u>log|linear|histogram|histolog|sqrt|square|acos|cos</u>
              Defines the way that values in the Aux range are mapped to the selected colour ramp.

              The available options are:

                * <u>log</u>: Logarithmic scaling

                * <u>linear</u>: Linear scaling

                * <u>histogram</u>: Scaling follows data distribution, with linear axis

                * <u>histolog</u>: Scaling follows data distribution, with logarithmic axis

                * <u>sqrt</u>: Square root scaling

                * <u>square</u>: Square scaling

                * <u>acos</u>: Arccos Scaling

                * <u>cos</u>: Cos Scaling

              For all these options, the full range of data values is used, and displayed on the colour  bar  if
              applicable. The <u>Linear</u>, <u>Log</u>, <u>Square</u> and <u>Sqrt</u> options just apply the named function to the full da‐
              ta  range.  The histogram options on the other hand use a scaling function that corresponds to the
              actual distribution of the data, so that there are about the same number of points (or pixels,  or
              whatever  is  being scaled) of each colour. The histogram options are somewhat more expensive, but
              can be a good choice if you are exploring data whose distribution is unknown or  not  well-behaved
              over  its  min-max  range.  The <u>Histogram</u> and <u>HistoLog</u> options both assign the colours in the same
              way, but they display the colour ramp with linear or logarithmic annotation respectively; the <u>His‐</u>
              <u>toLog</u> option also ignores non-positive values.

              If a zone suffix is appended to the parameter name, only that zone is affected, e.g. <u>auxfuncZ</u>  af‐
              fects only zone <u>Z</u>.

       <b>auxmin=</b><u>&lt;number&gt;</u>
              Minimum value of the data coordinate on the Aux axis. This sets the value before any subranging is
              applied. If not supplied, the value is determined from the plotted data.

              If  a  zone suffix is appended to the parameter name, only that zone is affected, e.g. <u>auxminZ</u> af‐
              fects only zone <u>Z</u>.

       <b>auxmax=</b><u>&lt;number&gt;</u>
              Maximum value of the data coordinate on the Aux axis. This sets the value before any subranging is
              applied. If not supplied, the value is determined from the plotted data.

              If a zone suffix is appended to the parameter name, only that zone is affected, e.g.  <u>auxmaxZ</u>  af‐
              fects only zone <u>Z</u>.

       <b>auxlabel=</b><u>&lt;text&gt;</u>
              Sets the label used to annotate the aux axis, if it is visible.

              If a zone suffix is appended to the parameter name, only that zone is affected, e.g. <u>auxlabelZ</u> af‐
              fects only zone <u>Z</u>.

       <b>auxcrowd=</b><u>&lt;factor&gt;</u>
              Determines how closely the tick marks are spaced on the Aux axis, if visible. The default value is
              1,  meaning  normal  crowding. Larger values result in more ticks, and smaller values fewer ticks.
              Tick marks will not however be spaced so closely that the labels overlap each  other,  so  to  get
              very closely spaced marks you may need to reduce the font size as well.

              If a zone suffix is appended to the parameter name, only that zone is affected, e.g. <u>auxcrowdZ</u> af‐
              fects only zone <u>Z</u>.

       <b>auxwidth=</b><u>&lt;pixels&gt;</u>
              Determines the lateral size of the aux colour ramp, if visible, in pixels.

              If a zone suffix is appended to the parameter name, only that zone is affected, e.g. <u>auxwidthZ</u> af‐
              fects only zone <u>Z</u>.

       <b>auxvisible=</b><u>true|false</u>
              Determines whether the aux axis colour ramp is displayed alongside the plot.

              If not supplied (the default), the aux axis will be visible when aux shading is used in any of the
              plotted layers.

              If  a  zone suffix is appended to the parameter name, only that zone is affected, e.g. <u>auxvisibleZ</u>
              affects only zone <u>Z</u>.

       <b>forcebitmap=</b><u>true|false</u>
              Affects whether rendering of the data contents of a plot (though not axis labels  etc)  is  always
              done  to  an  intermediate bitmap rather than, where possible, being painted using graphics primi‐
              tives. This is a rather arcane setting that may nevertheless have noticeable effects  on  the  ap‐
              pearance  and  size  of  an output graphics file, as well as plotting time. For some types of plot
              (e.g. <u>shadingN=auto</u> or <u>shadingN=density</u>) it will have no effect, since this kind of rendering hap‐
              pens in any case.

              When writing to vector graphics formats (PDF and PostScript), setting it true will force the  data
              contents to be bitmapped. This may make the output less beautiful (round markers will no longer be
              perfectly round), but it may result in a much smaller file if there are very many data points.

              When  writing to bitmapped output formats (PNG, GIF, JPEG, ...), it fixes shapes to be the same as
              seen on the screen rather than be rendered at the mercy of the graphics  system,  which  sometimes
              introduces small distortions.

       <b>compositor=</b><u>0..1</u>
              Defines  how  multiple  overplotted  partially transparent pixels are combined to form a resulting
              colour. The way this is used depends on the details of the specified plot.

              Currently, this parameter takes a "boost" value in the range 0..1. If the value is  zero,  satura‐
              tion  semantics are used: RGB colours are added in proporition to their associated alpha value un‐
              til the total alpha is saturated (reaches 1), after which additional pixels have  no  further  ef‐
              fect.  For  larger  boost  values,  the effect is similar, but any non-zero alpha in the output is
              boosted to the given minimum value. The effect of this is that even very slightly populated pixels
              can be visually distinguished from unpopulated ones which may not be the case for saturation  com‐
              position.

       <b>animate=</b><u>&lt;table&gt;</u>
              If  not null, this parameter causes the command to create a sequence of plots instead of just one.
              The parameter value is a table with one row for each frame to be produced. Columns  in  the  table
              are  interpreted  as parameters which may take different values for each frame; the column name is
              the parameter name, and the value for a given frame is its value from  that  row.  Animating  like
              this is considerably more efficient than invoking the STILTS command in a loop.

              The location of the animation control table. This may take one of the following forms:

                * A filename.

                * A URL.

                * The special value "<u>-</u>", meaning standard input. In this case the input format must be given ex‐
                  plicitly using the <u>afmt</u> parameter. Note that not all formats can be streamed in this way.

                * A scheme specification of the form <u>:&lt;scheme-name&gt;:&lt;scheme-args&gt;</u>.

                * A  system command line with either a "<u>&lt;</u>" character at the start, or a "<u>|</u>" character at the end
                  ("<u>&lt;syscmd</u>" or "<u>syscmd|</u>"). This executes the given pipeline and reads from its standard output.
                  This will probably only work on unix-like systems.
               In any case, compressed data in one of the supported compression formats (gzip, Unix compress  or
              bzip2) will be decompressed transparently.

       <b>afmt=</b><u>&lt;in-format&gt;</u>
              Specifies  the  format of the animation control table as specified by parameter <u>animate</u>. The known
              formats are listed in SUN/256. This flag can be used if you know what format your table is in.  If
              it  has  the special value <u>(auto)</u> (the default), then an attempt will be made to detect the format
              of the table automatically. This cannot always be done correctly however, in which case  the  pro‐
              gram  will  exit  with an error explaining which formats were attempted. This parameter is ignored
              for scheme-specified tables.

       <b>astream=</b><u>true|false</u>
              If set true, the animation control table specified by the <u>animate</u> parameter  will  be  read  as  a
              stream.  It is necessary to give the <u>afmt</u> parameter in this case. Depending on the required opera‐
              tions and processing mode, this may cause the read to fail (sometimes it is necessary to read  the
              table  more than once). It is not normally necessary to set this flag; in most cases the data will
              be streamed automatically if that is the best thing to do. However it can sometimes result in less
              resource usage when processing large files in certain formats (such as VOTable). This parameter is
              ignored for scheme-specified tables.

       <b>acmd=</b><u>&lt;cmds&gt;</u>
              Specifies processing to be performed on the animation control table as specified by parameter <u>ani‐</u>
              <u>mate</u>, before any other processing has taken place. The value of this parameter is one or  more  of
              the  filter  commands  described  in SUN/256. If more than one is given, they must be separated by
              semicolon characters (";"). This parameter can be repeated multiple times on the same command line
              to build up a list of processing steps. The sequence of commands given in  this  way  defines  the
              processing pipeline which is performed on the table.

              Commands  may  alternatively  be  supplied in an external file, by using the indirection character
              '<u>@</u>'. Thus a value of "<u>@filename</u>" causes the file <u>filename</u> to be read for a list of filter commands
              to execute. The commands in the file may be separated by newline characters and/or semicolons, and
              lines which are blank or which start with a '<u>#</u>' character are ignored. A backslash character '<u>\fR'</u>
              <u>at</u> <u>the</u> <u>end</u> <u>of</u> <u>a</u> <u>line</u> <u>joins</u> <u>it</u> <u>with</u> <u>the</u> <u>following</u> <u>line.</u>

       <b>parallel=</b><u>&lt;int-value&gt;</u>
              Determines how many threads will run in parallel if animation output is being produced. Only  used
              if  the  <u>animate</u>  parameter  is supplied. The default value is the number of processors apparently
              available to the JVM.

       <b>cellgap=</b><u>&lt;int-value&gt;</u>
              Gives the number of pixels between individual members in the stack of plots.

       <b>ylog=</b><u>true|false</u>
              If false (the default), the scale on the Y axis is linear, if true it is logarithmic.

              If a zone suffix is appended to the parameter name, only that zone is affected, e.g. <u>ylogZ</u> affects
              only zone <u>Z</u>.

       <b>yflip=</b><u>true|false</u>
              If true, the scale on the Y axis will increase in the opposite sense from  usual  (e.g.  right  to
              left rather than left to right).

              If  a  zone  suffix is appended to the parameter name, only that zone is affected, e.g. <u>yflipZ</u> af‐
              fects only zone <u>Z</u>.

       <b>tlabel=</b><u>&lt;text&gt;</u>
              Gives a label to be used for annotating the Time axis. If not supplied no label will be drawn.

              If a zone suffix is appended to the parameter name, only that zone is affected, e.g.  <u>tlabelZ</u>  af‐
              fects only zone <u>Z</u>.

       <b>ylabel=</b><u>&lt;text&gt;</u>
              Gives  a  label to be used for annotating axis Y A default value based on the plotted data will be
              used if no value is supplied.

              If a zone suffix is appended to the parameter name, only that zone is affected, e.g.  <u>ylabelZ</u>  af‐
              fects only zone <u>Z</u>.

       <b>t2func=</b><u>&lt;time-expr&gt;</u>
              Defines  a secondary time axis in terms of the primary one. If a secondary axis is defined in this
              way, then the axis opposite the primary one, i.e. the one on the top edge of the plot, will be an‐
              notated with the appropriate tickmarks.

              The value of this parameter is an algebraic expression giving the numeric value to be displayed on
              the secondary axis corresponding to a given time value on the primary axis. The expression may  be
              given in terms of one of the following variables:

                * <u>mjd</u>: Modified Julian Date

                * <u>jd</u>: Julian Day

                * <u>decYear</u>: decimal year CE

                * <u>unixSec</u>: seconds since 1970-01-01T00:00:00

              In  most  cases,  the  value of this parameter will simply be one of those variable names, for in‐
              stance, "<u>mjd</u>" to annotate the secondary axis in Modified Julian Date. However you can apply opera‐
              tions to these values in the usual way if required, for instance to provide a  differently  offset
              date scale.

              The function supplied should be monotonic and reasonably well-behaved, otherwise the secondary ax‐
              is  annotation  may  not work well. Tick marks will always be applied on a linear scale. Currently
              there is no way to annotate the secondary axis with ISO-8601 dates or other non-numeric labels.

              If a zone suffix is appended to the parameter name, only that zone is affected, e.g.  <u>t2funcZ</u>  af‐
              fects only zone <u>Z</u>.

       <b>y2func=</b><u>&lt;function-of-y&gt;</u>
              Defines  a  secondary  Y  axis in terms of the primary one. If a secondary axis is defined in this
              way, then the axis opposite the primary one (i.e. on the right side of the plot) will be annotated
              with the appropriate tickmarks.

              The value of this parameter is an algebraic expression in terms of the variable <u>y</u> giving the value
              on the secondary Y axis corresponding to a given value on the primary Y axis.

              For instance, if the primary Y axis represents flux  in  Jansky,  then  supplying  the  expression
              "<u>2.5*(23-log10(y))-48.6</u>"  (or  "<u>janskyToAb(y)</u>")  would  annotate the secondary Y axis as AB magni‐
              tudes.

              The function supplied should be monotonic and reasonably well-behaved, otherwise the secondary ax‐
              is annotation may not work well. The application will attempt to make a  sensible  decision  about
              whether to use linear or logarithmic tick marks.

              If  a  zone suffix is appended to the parameter name, only that zone is affected, e.g. <u>y2funcZ</u> af‐
              fects only zone <u>Z</u>.

       <b>t2label=</b><u>&lt;text&gt;</u>
              Provides a string that will label the secondary Time axis. This appears on the  opposite  side  of
              the plot to the Time axis itself.

              If  a zone suffix is appended to the parameter name, only that zone is affected, e.g. <u>t2labelZ</u> af‐
              fects only zone <u>Z</u>.

       <b>y2label=</b><u>&lt;text&gt;</u>
              Provides a string that will label the secondary Y axis. This appears on the opposite side  of  the
              plot to the Y axis itself.

              If  a zone suffix is appended to the parameter name, only that zone is affected, e.g. <u>y2labelZ</u> af‐
              fects only zone <u>Z</u>.

       <b>grid=</b><u>true|false</u>
              If true, grid lines are drawn on the plot at positions determined by  the  major  tick  marks.  If
              false, they are absent.

              If a zone suffix is appended to the parameter name, only that zone is affected, e.g. <u>gridZ</u> affects
              only zone <u>Z</u>.

       <b>tcrowd=</b><u>&lt;number&gt;</u>
              Determines how closely the tick marks are spaced on the Time axis. The default value is 1, meaning
              normal  crowding.  Larger  values result in more ticks, and smaller values fewer ticks. Tick marks
              will not however be spaced so closely that the labels overlap each other, so to get  very  closely
              spaced marks you may need to reduce the font size as well.

              If  a  zone suffix is appended to the parameter name, only that zone is affected, e.g. <u>tcrowdZ</u> af‐
              fects only zone <u>Z</u>.

       <b>ycrowd=</b><u>&lt;number&gt;</u>
              Determines how closely the tick marks are spaced on the Y axis. The default value  is  1,  meaning
              normal  crowding.  Larger  values result in more ticks, and smaller values fewer ticks. Tick marks
              will not however be spaced so closely that the labels overlap each other, so to get  very  closely
              spaced marks you may need to reduce the font size as well.

              If  a  zone suffix is appended to the parameter name, only that zone is affected, e.g. <u>ycrowdZ</u> af‐
              fects only zone <u>Z</u>.

       <b>labelangle=</b><u>horizontal|angled|adaptive</u>
              Controls the orientation of numeric labels on the axes. In most cases labels are written  horizon‐
              tally on both horizontal and vertical axes, but this option provides the possibility to write them
              at an angle which may be able to accommodate more labels on the horizontal axis, especially if the
              labels are long or a high crowding factor is requested.

              Note  that the <u>adaptive</u> option is currently not perfect, and can sometimes lead to suboptimal bor‐
              der placement.

              The available options are:

                * <u>horizontal</u>: axis labels are horizontal

                * <u>angled</u>: axis labels are angled

                * <u>adaptive</u>: axis labels are horizontal if possible, but angled if necessary to fit more in

              If a zone suffix is appended to the parameter name, only that zone is affected,  e.g.  <u>labelangleZ</u>
              affects only zone <u>Z</u>.

       <b>tformat=</b><u>iso-8601|year|mjd|unix</u>
              Selects the way in which time values are represented when using them to label the time axis.

              The available options are:

                * <u>iso-8601</u>: ISO 8601 date, of the form yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss.s (e.g. "2012-03-13T04")

                * <u>year</u>: Decimal year (e.g. "2012.197")

                * <u>mjd</u>: Modified Julian Date (e.g. "55999.2")

                * <u>unix</u>: Seconds since midnight of 1 Jan 1970 (e.g. "1331613420")

              If  a zone suffix is appended to the parameter name, only that zone is affected, e.g. <u>tformatZ</u> af‐
              fects only zone <u>Z</u>.

       <b>minor=</b><u>true|false</u>
              If true, minor tick marks are painted along the axes as well as the major tick marks.  Minor  tick
              marks do not have associated grid lines.

              If  a  zone  suffix is appended to the parameter name, only that zone is affected, e.g. <u>minorZ</u> af‐
              fects only zone <u>Z</u>.

       <b>shadow=</b><u>true|false</u>
              If true and no secondary axis is in use, then tick marks without numeric labels are painted  along
              the axis opposite to the primary axis, so that tick marks are visible along all edges not just the
              ones with numeric labels. If a secondary axis is in use, this setting is ignored.

              If  a  zone suffix is appended to the parameter name, only that zone is affected, e.g. <u>shadowZ</u> af‐
              fects only zone <u>Z</u>.

       <b>gridcolor=</b><u>&lt;rrggbb&gt;|red|blue|...</u>
              The color of the plot grid, given by name or as a hexadecimal RGB value.

              The standard plotting colour names are <u>red</u>, <u>blue</u>, <u>green</u>, <u>grey</u>, <u>magenta</u>, <u>cyan</u>, <u>orange</u>,  <u>pink</u>,  <u>yel‐</u>
              <u>low</u>, <u>black</u>, <u>light_grey</u>, <u>white</u>. However, many other common colour names (too many to list here) are
              also  understood.  The list currently contains those colour names understood by most web browsers,
              from <u>AliceBlue</u> to <u>YellowGreen</u>, listed e.g. in the Extended color  keywords  section  of  the  CSS3
              standard.

              Alternatively,  a  six-digit hexadecimal number RRGGBB may be supplied, optionally prefixed by "<u>#</u>"
              or "<u>0x</u>", giving red, green and blue intensities, e.g. "<u>ff00ff</u>", "<u>#ff00ff</u>" or "<u>0xff00ff</u>" for magen‐
              ta.

              If a zone suffix is appended to the parameter name, only that zone is  affected,  e.g.  <u>gridcolorZ</u>
              affects only zone <u>Z</u>.

       <b>gridtrans=</b><u>0..1</u>
              Transparency  of grid lines that may be drawn over the plot. The range is 0 (opaque) to 1 (invisi‐
              ble). This value is 1-alpha.

              If a zone suffix is appended to the parameter name, only that zone is  affected,  e.g.  <u>gridtransZ</u>
              affects only zone <u>Z</u>.

       <b>texttype=</b><u>plain|antialias|latex</u>
              Determines  how  to turn label text into characters on the plot. <u>Plain</u> and <u>Antialias</u> both take the
              text at face value, but <u>Antialias</u> smooths the characters.  <u>LaTeX</u>  interprets  the  text  as  LaTeX
              source code and typesets it accordingly.

              When not using LaTeX, antialiased text usually looks nicer, but can be perceptibly slower to plot.
              At  time of writing, on MacOS antialiased text seems to be required to stop the writing coming out
              upside-down for non-horizontal text (MacOS java bug).

              If a zone suffix is appended to the parameter name, only that zone is affected, e.g. <u>texttypeZ</u> af‐
              fects only zone <u>Z</u>.

       <b>fontsize=</b><u>&lt;int-value&gt;</u>
              Size of the text font in points.

              If a zone suffix is appended to the parameter name, only that zone is affected, e.g. <u>fontsizeZ</u> af‐
              fects only zone <u>Z</u>.

       <b>fontstyle=</b><u>standard|serif|mono</u>
              Font style for text.

              The available options are:

                * <u>standard</u>

                * <u>serif</u>

                * <u>mono</u>

              If a zone suffix is appended to the parameter name, only that zone is  affected,  e.g.  <u>fontstyleZ</u>
              affects only zone <u>Z</u>.

       <b>fontweight=</b><u>plain|bold|italic|bold_italic</u>
              Font weight for text.

              The available options are:

                * <u>plain</u>

                * <u>bold</u>

                * <u>italic</u>

                * <u>bold_italic</u>

              If  a  zone suffix is appended to the parameter name, only that zone is affected, e.g. <u>fontweightZ</u>
              affects only zone <u>Z</u>.

       <b>tmin=</b><u>&lt;year-or-iso8601&gt;</u>
              Minimum value of the time coordinate plotted. This sets the value before  any  subranging  is  ap‐
              plied. If not supplied, the value is determined from the plotted data.

              The  value may be set with a string that can be interpreted as a decimal year (e.g. "<u>2007.521</u>") or
              an ISO-8601 string (e.g. "<u>2007-07-10T03:57:36</u>", "<u>2007-07-10T03</u>"  or  "<u>2007-07-10</u>").  Note  however
              that  the numeric value of this configuration item if accessed programmatically is seconds since 1
              Jan 1970.

              If a zone suffix is appended to the parameter name, only that zone is affected, e.g. <u>tminZ</u> affects
              only zone <u>Z</u>.

       <b>tmax=</b><u>&lt;year-or-iso8601&gt;</u>
              Maximum value of the time coordinate plotted. This sets the value before  any  subranging  is  ap‐
              plied. If not supplied, the value is determined from the plotted data.

              The  value may be set with a string that can be interpreted as a decimal year (e.g. "<u>2007.521</u>") or
              an ISO-8601 string (e.g. "<u>2007-07-10T03:57:36</u>", "<u>2007-07-10T03</u>"  or  "<u>2007-07-10</u>").  Note  however
              that  the numeric value of this configuration item if accessed programmatically is seconds since 1
              Jan 1970.

              If a zone suffix is appended to the parameter name, only that zone is affected, e.g. <u>tmaxZ</u> affects
              only zone <u>Z</u>.

       <b>tsub=</b><u>&lt;lo&gt;,&lt;hi&gt;</u>
              Defines a normalised adjustment to the data range of the Time axis. The value may be specified  as
              a comma-separated pair of two numbers, giving the lower and upper bounds of the range of of inter‐
              est respectively. This sub-range is applied to the data range that would otherwise be used, either
              automatically  calculated  or  explicitly supplied; zero corresponds to the lower bound and one to
              the upper.

              The default value "<u>0,1</u>" therefore has no effect. The range could be restricted to its  lower  half
              with the value <u>0,0.5</u>.

              If a zone suffix is appended to the parameter name, only that zone is affected, e.g. <u>tsubZ</u> affects
              only zone <u>Z</u>.

       <b>ymin=</b><u>&lt;number&gt;</u>
              Minimum  value  of the data coordinate on the Y axis. This sets the value before any subranging is
              applied. If not supplied, the value is determined from the plotted data.

              If a zone suffix is appended to the parameter name, only that zone is affected, e.g. <u>yminZ</u> affects
              only zone <u>Z</u>.

       <b>ymax=</b><u>&lt;number&gt;</u>
              Maximum value of the data coordinate on the Y axis. This sets the value before any  subranging  is
              applied. If not supplied, the value is determined from the plotted data.

              If a zone suffix is appended to the parameter name, only that zone is affected, e.g. <u>ymaxZ</u> affects
              only zone <u>Z</u>.

       <b>ysub=</b><u>&lt;lo&gt;,&lt;hi&gt;</u>
              Defines  a  normalised adjustment to the data range of the Y axis. The value may be specified as a
              comma-separated pair of two numbers, giving the lower and upper bounds of the range of of interest
              respectively. This sub-range is applied to the data range that would otherwise be used, either au‐
              tomatically calculated or explicitly supplied; zero corresponds to the lower bound and one to  the
              upper.

              The  default  value "<u>0,1</u>" therefore has no effect. The range could be restricted to its lower half
              with the value <u>0,0.5</u>.

              If a zone suffix is appended to the parameter name, only that zone is affected, e.g. <u>ysubZ</u> affects
              only zone <u>Z</u>.

       <b>navaxes=</b><u>t|y|ty</u>
              Determines the axes which are affected by the interactive navigation actions (pan and  zoom).  The
              default  is  <u>t</u> which means that the various mouse gestures will provide panning and zooming in the
              Time direction only. However, if it is set to <u>ty</u> mouse actions will affect both the horizontal and
              vertical axes.

       <b>zoomfactor=</b><u>&lt;number&gt;</u>
              Sets the amount by which the plot view zooms in or out for each unit of mouse  wheel  movement.  A
              value of 1 means that mouse wheel zooming has no effect. A higher value means that the mouse wheel
              zooms faster and a value nearer 1 means it zooms slower. Values below 1 are not permitted.

       <b>leglabelN=</b><u>&lt;text&gt;</u>
              Sets the presentation label for the layer with a given suffix. This is the text which is displayed
              in the legend, if present. Multiple layers may use the same label, in which case they will be com‐
              bined to form a single legend entry.

              If no value is supplied (the default), the suffix itself is used as the label.

       <b>layerN=</b><u>&lt;layer-type&gt;</u> <u>&lt;layerN-specific-params&gt;</u>
              Selects  one of the available plot types for layerN. A plot consists of a plotting surface, set up
              using the various unsuffixed parameters of the plotting command, and zero  or  more  plot  layers.
              Each  layer  is introduced by a parameter with the name <u>layer&lt;N&gt;</u> where the suffix "<u>&lt;N&gt;</u>" is a label
              identifying the layer and is appended to all the parameter names which configure that layer.  Suf‐
              fixes may be any string, including the empty string.

              This parameter may take one of the following values, described in more detail in SUN/256:

                * <u>line</u>

                * <u>linearfit</u>

                * <u>mark</u>

                * <u>fill</u>

                * <u>quantile</u>

                * <u>grid</u>

                * <u>histogram</u>

                * <u>kde</u>

                * <u>knn</u>

                * <u>densogram</u>

                * <u>gaussian</u>

                * <u>yerror</u>

                * <u>spectrogram</u>

                * <u>label</u>

                * <u>function</u>

              Each  of  these layer types comes with a list of type-specific parameters to define the details of
              that layer, including some or all of the following groups:

                * input table parameters (e.g. <u>inN</u>, <u>icmdN</u>)

                * coordinate params referring to input table columns (e.g. <u>xN</u>, <u>yN</u>)

                * layer style parameters (e.g. <u>shadingN</u>, <u>colorN</u>)

              Every parameter notionally carries the same suffix <u>N</u>. However, if the suffix is not  present,  the
              application  will  try  looking for a parameter with the same name with no suffix instead. In this
              way, if several layers have the same value for a given parameter (for instance input  table),  you
              can  supply it using one unsuffixed parameter to save having to supply several parameters with the
              same value but different suffixes.

       <b>zoneN=</b><u>&lt;text&gt;</u>
              Defines which plot zone the layer with suffix N will appear in. This only makes sense  for  multi-
              zone  plots.  The actual value of the parameter is not significant, it just serves as a label, but
              different layers will end up in the same plot zone if they give the same values for  this  parame‐
              ter.
