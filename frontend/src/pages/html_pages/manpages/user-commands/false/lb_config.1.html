</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>lb</b> <b>config</b> is a high-level command (porcelain) of <u><a href="../man7/live-build.7.html">live-build</a></u>(7), the Debian Live tool suite.

       <b>lb</b>  <b>config</b>  populates  the  configuration  directory  for live-build. By default, this directory is named
       'config' and is created in the current directory where <b>lb</b> <b>config</b> was executed.

       Note: Currently <b>lb</b> <b>config</b> tries to be smart and sets defaults for some options depending on  the  setting
       of  other  options  (e.g.  which linux packages to be used depending on if a squeeze system gets build or
       not). This means that when generating a new configuration, you should call <b>lb</b> <b>config</b> only once  with  all
       options  specified.  Calling  it  several  times with only a subset of the options each can result in non
       working configurations. This is also caused by the fact that  <b>lb</b>  <b>config</b>  called  with  one  option  only
       changes  that  option,  and  leaves everything else as is unless its not defined. However, <b>lb</b> <b>config</b> does
       warn about know impossible or likely impossible combinations that would lead to non working live systems.
       If unsure, remove config/{binary,bootstrap,chroot,common,source} and call <b>lb</b> <b>config</b> again.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       In addition  to  its  specific  options  <b>lb</b>  <b>config</b>  understands  all  generic  live-build  options.  See
       <u><a href="../man7/live-build.7.html">live-build</a></u>(7) for a complete list of all generic live-build options.

       <b>--apt</b> apt|aptitude
           defines  if  apt-get  or aptitude is used to install packages when building the image. The default is
           apt.

       <b>--apt-ftp-proxy</b> <u>URL</u>
           sets the ftp proxy to be used by apt. By default, this is empty. Note that this variable is only  for
           the proxy that gets used by apt internally within the chroot, it is not used for anything else.

       <b>--apt-http-proxy</b> <u>URL</u>
           sets the http proxy to be used by apt. By default, this is empty. Note that this variable is only for
           the proxy that gets used by apt internally within the chroot, it is not used for anything else.

       <b>--apt-indices</b> true|false|none
           defines  if the resulting images should have apt indices or not and defaults to true. If set to none,
           no indices are included at all.

       <b>--apt-options</b> <u>OPTION</u>|"<u>OPTIONS</u>"
           defines the default options that will be appended to every apt call that is made inside chroot during
           the building of the image. By default, this is set to --yes to allow non-interactive installation  of
           packages.

       <b>--aptitude-options</b> <u>OPTION</u>|"<u>OPTIONS</u>"
           defines  the  default options that will be appended to every aptitude call that is made inside chroot
           during building of the image. By default, this  is  set  to  --assume-yes  to  allow  non-interactive
           installation of packages.

       <b>--apt-pipeline</b> <u>DEPTH</u>
           sets  the  depth of the apt/aptitude pipeline. In cases where the remote server is not RFC conforming
           or buggy (such as Squid 2.0.2) this option can be a value from 0 to 5 indicating how many outstanding
           requests APT should send. A value of zero MUST be specified if the  remote  host  does  not  properly
           linger  on  TCP  connections  - otherwise data corruption will occur. Hosts which require this are in
           violation of RFC 2068. By default, live-build does not set this option.

       <b>--apt-recommends</b> true|false
           defines if apt should install recommended packages automatically. By default, this is true except  in
           emdebian mode.

       <b>--apt-secure</b> true|false
           defines if apt should check repository signatures. This is true by default.

       <b>--apt-source-archives</b> true|false
           defines if deb-src entries should be included in the resulting live image or not, defaults to on.

       -a|<b>--architectures</b> <u>ARCHITECTURE</u>
           defines  the architecture of the to be build image. By default, this is set to the host architecture.
           Note that you cannot crossbuild for another architecture if your host system is not able  to  execute
           binaries  for  the  target architecture natively. For example, building amd64 images on i386 and vice
           versa is possile if you have a 64bit capable i386  processor  and  the  right  kernel.  But  building
           powerpc images on an i386 system is not possible.

       -b|<b>--binary-images</b> iso|iso-hybrid|netboot|tar|hdd
           defines  the  image type to build. By default, for images using syslinux this is set to iso-hybrid to
           build CD/DVD images that may also be used like hdd images, for non-syslinux images,  it  defaults  to
           iso.

       <b>--binary-filesystem</b> fat16|fat32|ext2|ext3|ext4
           defines  the  filesystem to be used in the image type. This only has an effect if the selected binary
           image type does allow to choose a filesystem. For example, when selection iso  the  resulting  CD/DVD
           has always the filesystem ISO9660. When building hdd images for usb sticks, this is active. Note that
           it  defaults  to fat16 on all architectures except sparc where it defaults to ext4. Also note that if
           you choose fat16 and your resulting  binary  image  gets  bigger  than  2GB,  the  binary  filesystem
           automatically gets switched to fat32.

       <b>--bootappend-install</b> <u>PARAMETER</u>|"<u>PARAMETERS</u>"
           sets boot parameters specific to debian-installer, if included.

       <b>--bootappend-live</b> <u>PARAMETER</u>|"<u>PARAMETERS</u>"
           sets  boot parameters specific to debian-live. A complete list of boot parameters can be found in the
           <u><a href="../man7/live-boot.7.html">live-boot</a></u>(7) and <u><a href="../man7/live-config.7.html">live-config</a></u>(7) manual pages.

       <b>--bootloader</b> grub|syslinux|yaboot
           defines which bootloader is beeing used in the generated image.  This  has  only  an  effect  if  the
           selected  binary  image  type  does  allow to choose the bootloader. For example, if you build a iso,
           always syslinux (or more precise, isolinux) is being used. Also note that some combinations of binary
           images types and bootloaders may be possible but live-build does not support them yet. <b>lb</b> <b>config</b> will
           fail to create such a not yet supported configuration and give a explanation about it. For hdd images
           on amd64 and i386, the default is syslinux. yaboot is only used on powerpc.

       <b>--bootstrap</b> cdebootstrap|cdebootstrap-static|debootstrap|copy
           defines which program is used to bootstrap the debian chroot, default is debootstrap.  Note  that  if
           you  set  the  bootstrap  program to copy, then your host system is copied. This can be useful if you
           want to convert/clone your existing host system into a live system, however, make sure  you  do  have
           enough free space as this can, depending on your host system, get quite big.

       -f|<b>--bootstrap-flavour</b> minimal|standard
           defines  if  the  bootstrap  program  should  bootstrap the standard system (all packages of priority
           required and important, which is the  default)  or  a  minimal  system  (only  packages  of  priority
           required, plus apt).

       <b>--bootstrap-keyring</b> <u>PACKAGE</u>
           sets the archive keyring package to be used. Default is debian-archive-keyring.

       <b>--cache</b> true|false
           defines  globally  if  any cache should be used at all. Different caches can be controled through the
           their own options.

       <b>--cache-indices</b> true|false
           defines if downloaded package indices and lists should be cached which is false by default.  Enabling
           it  would  allow  to  rebuild an image completely offline, however, you would not get updates anymore
           then.

       <b>--cache-packages</b> true|false
           defines if downloaded packages files should be cached which is true by  default.  Disabling  it  does
           save  space  consumtion  in  your  build directory, but remember that you will cause much unnecessary
           traffic if you do a couple of rebuilds. In general you should always leave it true, however, in  some
           particular  rare  build  setups,  it  can be faster to refetch packages from the local network mirror
           rather than to utilize the local disk.

       <b>--cache-stages</b> true|false|<u>STAGE</u>|"<u>STAGES</u>"
           sets which stages should be cached. By default set to bootstrap. As an exception to the normal  stage
           names,  also  rootfs  can  be  used  here  which  does  only  cache  the generated root filesystem in
           filesystem.{dir,ext*,squashfs}. This is useful during development if you want to rebuild  the  binary
           stage but not regenerate the root filesystem all the time.

       <b>--checksums</b> md5|sha1|sha256|none
           defines  if  the  binary  image  should  contain  a  file  called  md5sums.txt,  sha1sums.txt  and/or
           sha256sums.txt. These lists all files on the image together with their checksums. This in turn can be
           used by live-boots built-in integrity-check to verify the medium if  specified  at  boot  prompt.  In
           general,  this should not be false and is an important feature of live system released to the public.
           However, during development of very big  images  it  can  save  some  time  by  not  calculating  the
           checksums.

       <b>--compression</b> bzip2|gzip|lzip|none
           defines the compression program to be used to compress tarballs. Defaults to gzip.

       <b>--config</b> <u>GIT_URL</u>::<u>GIT_ID</u>
           allows  to  bootstrap a config tree from a git repositories, optionally appended by a Git Id (branch,
           commit, tag, etc.).

       <b>--build-with-chroot</b> true|false
           defines whetever live-build should use the tools from within the chroot to build the binary image  or
           not  by  using and including the host systems tools. This is a very dangerous option, using the tools
           of the host system can lead to tainted and even non-bootable images if the host  systems  version  of
           the  required  tools  (mainly  these  are  the bootloaders such as syslinux, grub and yaboot, and the
           auxilliary tools such as dosfstools, genisoimage, squashfs-tools and others) do  not  <b>exactely</b>  match
           what is present at build-time in the target distribution. Never do disable this option unless you are
           <b>exactely</b> sure what you are doing and have <b>completely</b> <u>understood</u> <u>its</u> <u>consequences.</u>

       <b>--chroot-filesystem</b> ext2|ext3|ext4|squashfs|jffs2|none
           defines  which filesystem type should be used for the root filesystem image. If you use none, then no
           filesystem image is created and the root filesystem content is copied on the binary image  filesystem
           as  flat files. Depending on what binary filesystem you have choosen, it may not be possible to build
           with such a plain root filesystem, e.g. fat16/fat32 will not work as linux does not  support  to  run
           directly on them.

       <b>--clean</b>
           minimizes config directory by automatically removing unused and thus empty subdirectories.

       -c|<b>--conffile</b> <u>FILE</u>
           using  a  user  specified  alternative configuration file in addition to the normally used one in the
           config directory.

       <b>--debconf-frontend</b> dialog|editor|noninteractive|readline
           defines what value the debconf frontend should be set to inside the chroot. Note that setting  it  to
           anything by noninteractive, which is the default, makes your build asking questions during the build.

       <b>--debconf-nowarnings</b> true|false
           defines  if  warnings of debconf should be displayed or not. Warnings from debconf are generally very
           rare and by default, we skip them,  if  any,  in  order  to  keep  the  build  process  entirely  non
           interactive.

       <b>--debconf-priority</b> low|medium|high|critical
           defines  what value the debconf priority shoul dbe set to inside the chroot. By default, it is set to
           critical, which means that almost no questions are displayed. Note that this only has  an  effect  if
           you use any debconf frontend different from noninteractive.

       <b>--debian-installer</b> true|cdrom|netinst|netboot|businesscard|live|false
           defines which type, if any, of the debian-installer should be included in the resulting binary image.
           By  default,  no  installer  is  included.  All  available  flavours  except  live  are the identical
           configurations used on the installer media produced by regular debian-cd. When live is  choosen,  the
           live-installer  udeb  is included so that debian-installer will behave different than usual - instead
           of installing the debian system from packages from the medium or the network, it  installs  the  live
           system to the disk.

       <b>--debian-installer-distribution</b> daily|<u>CODENAME</u>
           defines  the  distribution  where the debian-installer files should be taken out from. Normally, this
           should be set to the same distribution as the live system. However, some times, one wants  to  use  a
           newer or even daily built installer.

       <b>--debian-installer-preseedfile</b> <u>FILE</u>|<u>URL</u>
           sets the filename or URL for an optionally used and included preseeding file for debian-installer. If
           config/binary_debian-installer/preseed.cfg exists, it will be used by default.

       <b>--debian-installer-gui</b> true|false
           defines if the debian-installer graphical GTK interface should be true or not. In Debian mode and for
           most versions of Ubuntu, this option is true, whereas otherwise false, by default.

       <b>--debug</b>
           turn on debugging informational messages.

       -d|<b>--distribution</b> <u>CODENAME</u>
           defines the distribution of the resulting live system.

       -d|<b>--parent-distribution</b> <u>CODENAME</u>
           defines the parent distribution for derivatives of the resulting live system.

       -d|<b>--parent-debian-installer-distribution</b> <u>CODENAME</u>
           defines the parent debian-installer distribution for derivatives of the resulting live system.

       <b>--dump</b>
           prepares  a  report  of the currently present live system configuration and the version of live-build
           used. This is useful to provide if you submit bug reports, we do get all informations required for us
           to locate and replicate an error.

       <b>--fdisk</b> fdisk|fdisk.dist
           sets the filename of the fdisk binary from the host system that should be used. This is  autodetected
           and does generally not need any customization.

       <b>--force</b>
           forces  re-execution  of already run stages. Use only if you know what you are doing. It is generally
           safer to use <b>lb</b> <b>clean</b> to clean up before re-executing <b>lb</b> <b>build</b>.

       <b>--grub-splash</b> <u>FILE</u>
           defines the name of an optional to be included splash screen graphic for the grub bootloader.

       <b>--gzip-options</b> <u>OPTION</u>|"<u>OPTIONS</u>"
           defines the default options that will be appended to (almost) every gzip call during the building  of
           the  image.  By default, this is set to --best to use highest (but slowest) compression. Dynamically,
           if the host system supports it, also --rsyncable is added.

       <b>--hooks</b> <u>FILE</u>
           defines which hooks available in /usr/share/live/build/examples/hooks should be activated.  Normally,
           there are no hooks executed. Make sure you know and understood the hook before you enable it.

       <b>--ignore-system-defaults</b>
           <b>lb</b>  <b>config</b>  by  default  reads  system  defaults from /etc/live/build.conf and /etc/live/build.d when
           generating a new live system config directory. This is useful if you want  to  set  global  settings,
           such as mirror locations, and don't want to specify them all of the time.

       <b>--initramfs</b> auto|none|live-boot|casper
           sets  the  name of package that contains the live system specific initramfs modification. By default,
           auto is used, which means that at build time of the image rather  than  on  configuration  time,  the
           value  will  be  expanded to casper when building ubuntu systems, to live-boot for all other systems.
           Using 'none' is useful if the resulting system image should not be a live image (experimental).

       <b>--initramfs-compression</b> bzip2|gzip|lzma]
           defines the compression program to be used to compress the initramfs. Defaults to gzip.

       <b>--interactive</b> shell
           defines if after the chroot stage and before the beginning of the binary stage, a  interactive  shell
           login  should  be  spawned  in the chroot in order to allow you to do manual customizations. Once you
           close the shell with logout or exit, the build will  continue  as  usual.  Note  that  it's  strongly
           discouraged  to  use this for anything else than testing. Modifications that should be present in all
           builds of a live system should be properly made through hooks. Everything else destroys the beauty of
           being able to completely automatise the build process and making it non interactive. By default, this
           is of course false.

       <b>--isohybrid-options</b> <u>OPTION</u>|"<u>OPTIONS</u>"
           defines options to pass to isohybrid.

       <b>--iso-application</b> <u>NAME</u>
           sets the APPLICATION field in the header of a resulting CD/DVD image and defaults to "Debian Live" in
           debian mode, and to "Emdebian Live" in emdebian mode, and "Ubuntu Live" in ubuntu mode.

       <b>--iso-preparer</b> <u>NAME</u>
           sets the PREPARER field in the header of a  resulting  CD/DVD  image.  By  default  this  is  set  to
           "live-build  <u>VERSION</u>;  <a href="http://packages.qa.debian.org/live-build">http://packages.qa.debian.org/live-build</a>",  whereas VERSION is expanded to the
           version of live-build that was used to build the image.

       <b>--iso-publisher</b> <u>NAME</u>
           sets the PUBLISHED field in the header of a resulting CD/DVD  image.  By  default,  this  is  set  to
           'Debian  Live project; http:/live.debian.net/; <a href="mailto:debian-live@lists.debian.org">debian-live@lists.debian.org</a>'. Remember to change this
           to the appropriate values at latest when you distributing custom and unofficial images.

       <b>--iso-volume</b> <u>NAME</u>
           sets the VOLUME field in the header of a resulting CD/DVD  and  defaults  to  '(<u>MODE</u>)  (<u>DISTRIBUTION</u>)
           (<u>DATE</u>)'  whereas MODE is expanded to the name of the mode in use, DISTRIBUTION the distribution name,
           and DATE with the current date and time of the generation.

       <b>--jffs2-eraseblock</b> <u>SIZE</u>
           sets the eraseblock size for a JFFS2 (Second Journalling Flash File System) filesystem.  The  default
           is  64  KiB.  If  you  use  an erase block size different than the erase block size of the target MTD
           device, JFFS2 may not perform optimally. If the SIZE specified is below 4096, the units  are  assumed
           to be KiB.

       <b>--keyring-packages</b> <u>PACKAGE|"PACKAGES</u>"
           sets   the   keyring   package   or   additional   keyring  packages.  By  default  this  is  set  to
           debian-archive-keyring.

       -k|<b>--linux-flavours</b> <u>FLAVOUR</u>|"<u>FLAVOURS</u>"
           sets the kernel flavours to be installed. Note that in case you specify more than that the first will
           be configured the default kernel that gets booted.

       <b>--linux-packages</b> "<u>PACKAGES</u>"
           sets the internal name of the kernel packages naming scheme. If you use debian kernel  packages,  you
           will not have to adjust it. If you decide to use custom kernel packages that do not follow the debian
           naming  scheme,  remember  to  set  this  option to the stub of the packages only (for debian this is
           linux-image-2.6),  so  that  <u>STUB</u>-<u>FLAVOUR</u>  results  in  a  valid  package  name  (for   debian   e.g.
           linux-image-2.6-486).  Preferably  you  use the meta package name, if any, for the stub, so that your
           configuration is ABI independent. Also don't forget that you have to  include  stubs  of  the  binary
           modules packages for unionfs or aufs, and squashfs if you built them out-of-tree.

       <b>--losetup</b> losetup|losetup.orig
           sets  the  filename  of  the  losetup  binary  from  the  host  system  that  should be used. This is
           autodetected and does generally not need any customization.

       <b>--memtest</b> memtest86+|memtest86|none
           defines if memtest, memtest86+ or no memory tester at all should be included as secondary  bootloader
           configuration. This is only available on amd64 and i386 and defaults to memtest86+.

       -m|<b>--parent-mirror-bootstrap</b> <u>URL</u>
           sets  the  location of the debian package mirror that should be used to bootstrap from. This defaults
           to <a href="http://ftp.de.debian.org/debian/">http://ftp.de.debian.org/debian/</a> which may not be a good default if you live outside of Europe.

       <b>--parent-mirror-chroot</b> <u>URL</u>
           sets the location of the debian package mirror that will be used to fetch the packages  in  order  to

           sets  the  location  of the debian security package mirror that will be used to fetch the packages in
           order to build the live system. By default, this points to <a href="http://security.debian.org/debian/">http://security.debian.org/debian/</a>.

       <b>--parent-mirror-chroot-volatile</b> <u>URL</u>
           sets the location of the debian volatile package mirror that will be used to fetch packages in  order

       <b>--parent-mirror-binary</b> <u>URL</u>
           sets  the  location of the debian package mirror that should end up configured in the final image and
           which is the one a user would see and use. This has not necessarily to be the same that  is  used  to
           build  the image, e.g. if you use a local mirror but want to have an official mirror in the image. By
           default, '<a href="http://cdn.debian.net/debian/">http://cdn.debian.net/debian/</a>' is used.

       <b>--parent-mirror-binary-security</b> <u>URL</u>
           sets the location of the debian security package mirror that should end up configured  in  the  final
           image. By default, '<a href="http://cdn.debian.net/debian-security/">http://cdn.debian.net/debian-security/</a>' is used.

       <b>--parent-mirror-debian-installer</b> <u>URL</u>
           sets  the  location of the mirror that will be used to fetch the debian installer images. By default,
           this  points  to  the  same  mirror  used  to  build   the   live   system,   i.e.   the   value   of
           --parent-mirror-bootstrap.

       <b>--mirror-bootstrap</b> <u>URL</u>
           sets  the location of the debian package mirror that should be used to bootstrap the derivative from.
           This defaults to <a href="http://ftp.de.debian.org/debian/">http://ftp.de.debian.org/debian/</a> which may not be a good default if you live outside
           of Europe.

       <b>--mirror-chroot</b> <u>URL</u>
           sets the location of the debian package mirror that will  be  used  to  fetch  the  packages  of  the

           sets the location of the derivative package mirror that should end up configured in the  final  image
           and  which  is the one a user would see and use. This has not necessarily to be the same that is used

           sets  the  location  of  the  mirror  that  will  be used to fetch the debian installer images of the
           derivative. By default, this points to the same mirror used to build the live system, i.e. the  value
           of --mirror-bootstrap.

       <b>--mode</b> debian|emdebian|progress|ubuntu
           defines a global mode to load project specific defaults. By default this is set to debian.

       <b>--system</b> live|normal

       <b>--net-root-filesystem</b> nfs|cfs
           defines  the  filesystem  that  will  be  configured in the bootloader configuration for your netboot
           image. This defaults to nfs.

       <b>--net-root-mountoptions</b> <u>OPTIONS</u>
           sets additional options for mounting the root filesystem in netboot images and is by default empty.

       <b>--net-root-path</b> <u>PATH</u>
           sets the file path that will be configured in the bootloader configuration for  your  netboot  image.
           This  defaults  to  /srv/debian-live  in  debian mode and to /srv/emebian-live when being in emdebian
           mode, and /srv/ubuntu-live when in ubuntu mode.

       <b>--net-root-server</b> <u>IP</u>|<u>HOSTNAME</u>
           sets the IP or hostname that will  be  configured  in  the  bootloader  configuration  for  the  root
           filesystem of your netboot image. This defaults to 192.168.1.1.

       <b>--net-cow-filesystem</b> nfs|cfs
           defines the filesystem type for the copy-on-write layer and defaults to nfs.

       <b>--net-cow-mountoptions</b> <u>OPTIONS</u>
           sets  additional  options  for  mounting  the copy-on-write layer in netboot images and is by default
           empty.

       <b>--net-cow-path</b> <u>PATH</u>
           defines the path to client writable filesystem. Anywhere that <u>client_mac_address</u> is specified in  the
           path live-boot will substitute the MAC address of the client delimited with hyphens.

           Example:
           /export/hosts/client_mac_address
           /export/hosts/00-16-D3-33-92-E8

       <b>--net-cow-server</b> <u>IP</u>|<u>HOSTNAME</u>
           sets the IP or hostname that will be configured in the bootloader configuration for the copy-on-write
           filesystem of your netboot image and is by default empty.

       <b>--net-tarball</b> true|false
           defines if a compressed tarball should be created. Disabling this options leads to no tarball at all,
           the plain binary directory is considered the output in this case. Default is true.

       -p|<b>--package-lists</b> <u>LIST</u>|"<u>LISTS</u>"
           defines which lists available in /usr/share/live/build/package-lists should be used. By default, this
           is set to standard. Note that in case you have local package lists, you don't need to list them here.
           Putting  them  into  config/package-lists  is  enough  (the  filename  needs to have the .list suffix
           though).

       <b>--quiet</b>
           reduces the verbosity of messages output by <b>lb</b> <b>build</b>.

       <b>--archives</b> <u>ARCHIVE</u>|"<u>ARCHIVES</u>"
           enables one of available third-party archive configurations in /usr/share/live/build/archives.

       <b>--root-command</b> sudo
           controls if live-build should use sudo internally to build the live image. Note that this is not well
           tested and that you should, when relying on sudo, call the individual live-build  command  with  sudo
           itself.

       <b>--use-fakeroot</b> true|false
           controls  if  live-build  should  utilize  fakeroot  and  fakechroot  to try and avoid requiring root
           privillages where possible. By default, this option is false.

       <b>--archive-areas</b> <u>ARCHIVE_AREA</u>|"<u>ARCHIVE_AREAS</u>"
           defines which package archive areas of a debian packages archive should be used for configured debian
           package mirrors. By default, this is set to main. Remember to check the  licenses  of  each  packages
           with  respect to their redistributability in your juristiction when enabling contrib or non-free with
           this mechanism.

       <b>--parent-archive-areas</b> <u>PARENT_ARCHIVE_AREA</u>|"<u>PARENT_ARCHIVE_AREAS</u>"
           defines the archive areas for derivatives of the resulting live system.

       <b>--security</b> true|false
           defines if the security repositories specified in the security mirror options should be used or not.

       <b>--source</b> true|false
           defines if a corresponding source image to the binary image should be build. By default this is false
           because most people do not require this and would require to download quite a  few  source  packages.
           However, once you start distributing your live image, you should make sure you build it with a source
           image alongside.

       -s|<b>--source-images</b> iso|netboot|tar|hdd
           defines the image type for the source image. Default is tar.

       <b>--firmware-binary</b> true|false
           defines   if   firmware   packages  should  be  automatically  included  into  the  binary  pool  for
           debian-installer. Note that only firmware packages available within the configured archive areas  are
           included,  e.g.  an  image  with packages from main only will not automatically include firmware from
           non-free. This option does not interfere with explicitly listed packages in binary package lists.

       <b>--firmware-chroot</b> true|false
           defines if firmware packages should be automatically included into the live  image.  Note  that  only
           firmware  packages  available  within  the  configured archive areas are included, e.g. an image with
           packages from main only will not automatically include firmware from non-free. This option  does  not
           interfere with explicitly listed packages in chroot package lists.

       <b>--swap-file-path</b> <u>PATH</u>
           defines the path to a swap file to create in the binary image. Default is not to create a swap file.

       <b>--swap-file-size</b> <u>MB</u>
           defines what size in megabytes the swap file should be, if one is to be created. Default is 512MB.

       <b>--syslinux-theme</b> <u>THEME_SUFFIX</u>
           defines   the   syslinux   theme   to   use.  The  theme  suffix  is  the  name  of  a  directory  in
           /usr/share/syslinux/themes/ provided by a package named syslinux-theme- plus the  suffix.  In  debian
           mode, this defaults to debian-squeeze.

       <b>--tasksel</b> apt|aptitude|tasksel
           selects which program is used to install tasks. By default, this is set to tasksel.

       <b>--templates</b> <u>PATH</u>
           sets  the  path  to  the templates that live-build is going to use, e.g. for bootloaders. By default,
           this is set to /usr/share/live/build/templates/.

       <b>--hdd-size</b> MB
           defines what size the hdd image should be. Note that although the default is set to 10000  (=  10GB),
           it will not need 10GB space on your harddisk as the files are created as sparse files.

       <b>--volatile</b> true|false
           defines if debian volatile package archives should be included in the image or not.

       <b>--backports</b> true|false
           defines if debian backports package archives should be included in the image or not.

       <b>--exposed-root</b> true|false
           defines  whether  to expose the root filesystem as read only and not covered by the union filesystem.
           This has useful implications for certain speciality setups such as LTSP. By default, this  option  is
           false.

       <b>--verbose</b>
           increases the verbosity of messages output by <b>lb</b> <b>build</b>.

       <b>--win32-loader</b> <b>true|false</b>
           defines if win32-loader should be included in the binary image or not.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       Currently,  command  line  switches can also be specified through the corresponding environment variable.
       However, this generally should not be relied upon, as it is an implementation detail that is  subject  to
       change  in  future releases. For options applying directly to live-build, environment variables are named
       LB_FOO, meaning, e.g. <b>--apt-ftp-proxy</b> becomes LB_APT_FTP_PROXY (the exception being internal options such
       as <b>--debug</b>). For options passed to another program, as in APT_OPTIONS or GZIP_OPTIONS, no LB_  prefix  is
       used.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>auto/config</b>

       <b>/etc/live/build.conf,</b> <b>/etc/live/build.d</b>
           An  optional, global configuration file for <b>lb</b> <b>config</b> variables. It is useful to specify a few system
           wide defaults,  like  LB_PARENT_MIRROR_BOOTSTRAP.  This  feature  can  be  false  by  specifying  the
           <b>--ignore-system-defaults</b> option.
