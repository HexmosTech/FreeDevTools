</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       cutmp3 - a fast and leightweight mp3 editor

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>cutmp3</b>  [-i  <u>&lt;file&gt;</u>]  [-O <u>&lt;file&gt;</u>] [-a <u>&lt;startpoint&gt;</u>] [-b <u>&lt;endpoint&gt;</u>] [-f <u>&lt;timetable&gt;</u>] [-o <u>&lt;output_prefix&gt;</u>]
       [-I <u>&lt;file&gt;</u> <u>[-F]</u>] [-d 2] [-s <u>&lt;factor&gt;</u>] -c -C -k -q

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Cutmp3 is a small and fast command line MP3 editor. It lets you select sections of an  MP3  interactively
       or  via a timetable and save them to separate files without quality loss. It uses mpg123 for playback and
       works with VBR files and even with files bigger than 2GB. Other features are configurable silence seeking
       and ID3 tag seeking, which are useful for concatenated mp3s.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       -i <u>&lt;file&gt;</u>
              input file to edit

       -O <u>&lt;file&gt;</u>
              forced output filename

       -o <u>&lt;output_prefix&gt;</u>
              prefix of generated output filename
              (e.g. &lt;output_prefix&gt;0001.mp3, &lt;output_prefix&gt;0002.mp3, ...)

       -a <u>&lt;mm:ss.xx&gt;</u>
              starting position of selection to write to new file

       -b <u>&lt;mm:ss.xx&gt;</u>
              end position of selection to write to new file

       -f <u>&lt;timetable_file&gt;</u>
              use a timetable to extract several sequences from a given file.
              The timetable must have the following format:
              "&lt;start_position&gt; &lt;end_position&gt;" e.g.:

              0:01 1:00
              11:15 19:33
              01:01.34 02:39.78
              1:0 -0:05

              Negative values mean distance from the end of file.  Note that the options [-a] and [-b]  override
              a given timetable.

       -q quiet mode
              Switch  on quiet mode, cutmp3 won't make any sound, useful for debugging and commands using a pipe
              like: "echo 7a9bsq | cutmp3 -i file.mp3"

       -c copy metadata
              Copies metadata in non-interactive mode. Useful to keep ID3 tags when using -a -b or -f.

       -C do not copy metadata
              Prevents copying any metadata.

       -k keep old filename
              Keeps old filename and full path and appends 0001.mp3, etc.

       -s maximum silence length factor
              Normally cutmp3 stops when the silence found is longer than 15 times the minimum  silence  length.
              [-s] changes this factor. 0 means infinity.

       -d 2   use the second soundcard (/dev/dsp1)

</pre><h4><b>KEYBOARD</b> <b>CONTROL</b></h4><pre>
       rewind with the following keys [1/2/3/4/5]
       move forward with the following keys [6/7/8/9/0]
       [0]  means  10mins  forward,  [9]  is 1min forward, [8] is 10secs forward, [7] is 1sec forward and [6] is
       1/10sec forward. Keys [1] to [5] go symmetrically back (so [1] means 10mins back). For highest  precision
       [,]  goes  back one frame and [.] goes one frame forward. After any of these keys you will hear the sound
       at this position for one second. When you are at the starting position of your part  of  interest,  press
       the key [a]. When you are at the last position of your part of interest, press the key [b] (What you hear
       after  [b]  will then be the last second inside the new file). By pressing [s] the resulting file will be
       written to result0001.mp3. If it already exists, cutmp3  will  increase  the  number  to  result0002.mp3,
       result0003.mp3 and so on.

       You can change the length of playback by pressing [N] and [M].

       You  can  seek to the end of the next silence by pressing [p] (for pause) or to its beginning by pressing
       [P]. By default the silence should last for 1000 milliseconds, which  is  one  second,  and  the  maximum
       volume during this second is the minimum: 1 (whatever that is in dB).

       You can change:

       - the length of the silence by pressing [n] or [m] and
       - the maximum volume during this silence by pressing [+] or [-].

       These values will be saved to <a href="file:~/.cutmp3rc">~/.cutmp3rc</a> by pressing [S].

       You  can seek to the next ID3 tag by pressing [T]. This is useful in case someone has merged several mp3s
       into one file without removing the ID3-tags.

       For other useful keycodes type [h] in interactive mode.

       Please note that cutmp3 only accepts one inputfile, so using wildcards like [?]  or [*] in filenames will
       result in editing only the first file that matches.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       1) The resulting files will be written to blah0001.mp3, blah0002.mp3, blah0003.mp3 and so on:

           cutmp3 -i file.mp3 -o blah

       2) If you only want to cut a file once and you know the times for start and the end, you type:

           cutmp3 -i file.mp3 -a 0:37 -b 1:25

       and cutmp3 will write the passage of file.mp3 starting at 0:37 and ending at 1:25 to blah01.mp3

       3) If you want to cut a file more often, you need to create a file which contains a  timetable  and  type
       (Please read README.timetable for details):

           cutmp3 -i file.mp3 -f name_of_the_timetablefile

       4)  Only  print  total  number  of  frames, sampling frequency, number of channels, average bitrate, MPEG
       version and total time in milliseconds, in this order:

           cutmp3 -F -I file.mp3

       5) If you want to clean an MP3 from any data that is not sound, just use  (Cutting  in  interactive  mode
       does _not_ remove invalid data!):

           cutmp3 -i infile.mp3 -a 0:0 -b 99999:0
