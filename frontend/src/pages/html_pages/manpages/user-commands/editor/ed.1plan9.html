       ed - text editor

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ed</b> [ <b>-</b> ] [ <b>-o</b> ] [ <u>file</u> ]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Ed</u> is a venerable text editor.

       If  a  <u>file</u>  argument  is  given,  <u>ed</u> simulates an command (see below) on that file: it is read into <u>ed's</u>
       buffer so that it can be edited.  The options are

       <b>-</b>      Suppress the printing of character counts by and commands and of the confirming by commands.

       <b>-o</b>     (for output piping) Write all output to the standard error file except writing by commands.  If no
              <u>file</u> is given, make <b>/dev/stdout</b> the remembered file; see the command below.

       <u>Ed</u> operates on a `buffer', a copy of the file it is editing; changes made in the buffer have no effect on
       the file until a (write) command is given.  The copy of the text being edited resides in a temporary file
       called the <u>buffer</u>.

       Commands to <u>ed</u> have a simple and regular structure: zero, one, or two  <u>addresses</u>  followed  by  a  single
       character  <u>command</u>,  possibly followed by parameters to the command.  These addresses specify one or more
       lines in the buffer.  Missing addresses are supplied by default.

       In general, only one command may appear on a line.  Certain commands allow the addition of  text  to  the
       buffer.   While  <u>ed</u>  is  accepting  text,  it is said to be in <u>input</u> <u>mode.</u>  In this mode, no commands are
       recognized; all input is merely collected.  Input mode is left by typing a period alone at the  beginning
       of a line.

       <u>Ed</u>  supports  the  <u>regular</u>  <u>expression</u>  notation described in <u><a href="../man7/regexp.7.html">regexp</a></u>(7).  Regular expressions are used in
       addresses to specify lines and in one command (see <u>s</u> below) to specify a portion of a line which is to be
       replaced.  If it is desired to use one of the regular expression metacharacters as an ordinary character,
       that character may be preceded by  `<b>\</b>'.   This  also  applies  to  the  character  bounding  the  regular
       expression (often and to itself.

       To  understand  addressing  in  <u>ed</u>  it  is  necessary  to  know that at any time there is a <u>current</u> <u>line.</u>
       Generally, the current line is the last line affected by a command; however,  the  exact  effect  on  the
       current line is discussed under the description of each command.  Addresses are constructed as follows.

       1.     The character customarily called `dot', addresses the current line.

       2.     The character addresses the last line of the buffer.

       3.     A decimal number <u>n</u> addresses the <u>n</u>-th line of the buffer.

       4.     <b>´x</b> addresses the line marked with the name <u>x</u>, which must be a lower-case letter.  Lines are marked
              with the command.

       5.     A  regular expression enclosed in slashes ( addresses the line found by searching forward from the
              current line and stopping at  the  first  line  containing  a  string  that  matches  the  regular
              expression.  If necessary the search wraps around to the beginning of the buffer.

       6.     A  regular  expression enclosed in queries addresses the line found by searching backward from the
              current line and stopping at  the  first  line  containing  a  string  that  matches  the  regular
              expression.  If necessary the search wraps around to the end of the buffer.

       7.     An  address  followed  by  a plus sign or a minus sign followed by a decimal number specifies that
              address plus (resp. minus) the indicated number of lines.  The plus sign may be omitted.

       8.     An address followed by (or followed by a regular expression  enclosed  in  slashes  specifies  the
              first  matching line following (or preceding) that address.  The search wraps around if necessary.
              The may be omitted, so addresses the <u>first</u> line in  the  buffer  with  an  Enclosing  the  regular
              expression in reverses the search direction.

       9.     If  an  address  begins  with  or the addition or subtraction is taken with respect to the current
              line; e.g. is understood to mean

       10.    If an address ends with or then 1 is added (resp. subtracted).  As a consequence of this rule  and
              rule 9, the address refers to the line before the current line.  Moreover, trailing and characters
              have cumulative effect, so refers to the current line less 2.

       11.    To  maintain  compatibility  with  earlier  versions  of the editor, the character in addresses is
              equivalent to

       Commands may require zero, one, or two  addresses.   Commands  which  require  no  addresses  regard  the
       presence  of an address as an error.  Commands which accept one or two addresses assume default addresses
       when insufficient are given.  If more addresses are given than a command requires, the last  one  or  two
       (depending on what is accepted) are used.

       Addresses are separated from each other typically by a comma They may also be separated by a semicolon In
       this  case the current line is set to the previous address before the next address is interpreted.  If no
       address precedes a comma or semicolon, line 1 is assumed; if no address follows, the  last  line  of  the
       buffer  is  assumed.   The second address of any two-address sequence must correspond to a line following
       the line corresponding to the first address.

       In the following list of <u>ed</u> commands, the default addresses are shown in  parentheses.   The  parentheses
       are  not part of the address, but are used to show that the given addresses are the default.  `Dot' means
       the current line.

       (.)<b>a</b>
       &lt;text&gt;
       <b>.</b>      Read the given text and append it after the addressed line.  Dot is left on the last  line  input,
              if  there  were  any, otherwise at the addressed line.  Address is legal for this command; text is
              placed at the beginning of the buffer.

       (.,.)<b>b</b>[<b>+-</b>][<u>pagesize</u>][<b>pln</b>]
              Browse.  Print a `page', normally 20 lines.  The optional (default) or specifies whether the  next
              or  previous  page is to be printed.  The optional <u>pagesize</u> is the number of lines in a page.  The
              optional or causes printing in the specified format, initially Pagesize and format are  remembered
              between commands.  Dot is left at the last line displayed.

       (.,.)<b>c</b>
       &lt;text&gt;
       <b>.</b>      Change.   Delete  the addressed lines, then accept input text to replace these lines.  Dot is left
              at the last line input; if there were none, it is left at the line preceding the deleted lines.

       (.,.)<b>d</b> Delete the addressed lines from the buffer.  Dot is set  to  the  line  following  the  last  line
              deleted, or to the last line of the buffer if the deleted lines had no successor.

       <b>e</b> <u>filename</u>
              Edit.  Delete the entire contents of the buffer; then read the named file into the buffer.  Dot is
              set  to  the  last  line of the buffer.  The number of characters read is typed.  The file name is
              remembered for possible use in later or commands.  If <u>filename</u> is missing, the remembered name  is
              used.

       <b>E</b> <u>filename</u>
              Unconditional see below.

       <b>f</b> <u>filename</u>
              Print  the  currently  remembered  file name.  If <u>filename</u> is given, the currently remembered file
              name is first changed to <u>filename</u>.

       (1,$)<b>g/</b><u>regular</u> <u>expression</u><b>/</b><u>command</u> <u>list</u>
       (1,$)<b>g/</b><u>regular</u> <u>expression</u><b>/</b>
       (1,$)<b>g/</b><u>regular</u> <u>expression</u>
              Global.  First mark every line which matches the given <u>regular</u>expression<u>.</u>   Then  for  every  such
              line, execute the <u>command</u> <u>list</u> with dot initially set to that line.  A single command or the first
              of  multiple commands appears on the same line with the global command.  All lines of a multi-line
              list except the last line must end with The `<b>.</b>' terminating input  mode  for  an  command  may  be
              omitted  if  it would be on the last line of the command list.  The commands and are not permitted
              in the command list.  Any character other than space or newline may be used instead of to  delimit
              the regular expression.  The second and third forms mean <b>g/</b><u>regular</u> <u>expression</u><b>/p</b>.

       (<b>.</b>)<b>i</b>
       &lt;text&gt;
       <b>.</b>      Insert the given text before the addressed line.  Dot is left at the last line input, or, if there
              were none, at the line before the addressed line.  This command differs from the <u>a</u> command only in
              the placement of the text.

       (<b>.,.+1</b>)<b>j</b>
              Join  the  addressed  lines into a single line; intermediate newlines are deleted.  Dot is left at
              the resulting line.

       (.)<b>k</b><u>x</u>  Mark the addressed line with name <u>x</u>, which must be a lower-case letter.  The address form <b>´</b><u>x</u>  then
              addresses this line.

       (.,.)<b>l</b> List.   Print  the  addressed  lines  in  an  unambiguous  way: a tab is printed as a backspace as
              backslashes as and non-printing characters as a backslash, an and four hexadecimal  digits.   Long
              lines  are  folded,  with  the second and subsequent sub-lines indented one tab stop.  If the last
              character in the line is a blank, it is followed by An  may  be  appended,  like  to  any  non-I/O
              command.

       (.,.)<b>m</b><u>a</u>
              Move.   Reposition  the  addressed  lines  after the line addressed by <u>a</u>.  Dot is left at the last
              moved line.

       (.,.)<b>n</b> Number.  Perform prefixing each line with its line number and a tab.  An may be appended, like  to
              any non-I/O command.

       (.,.)<b>p</b> Print  the  addressed  lines.   Dot  is  left at the last line printed.  A appended to any non-I/O
              command causes the then current line to be printed after the command is executed.

       (.,.)<b>P</b> This command is a synonym for

       <b>q</b>      Quit the editor.  No automatic write of a file is done.  A or command is considered to be in error
              if the buffer has been modified since the last or command.

       <b>Q</b>      Quit unconditionally.

       (<b>$</b>)r <u>filename</u>
              Read in the given file after the addressed line.  If no <u>filename</u> is  given,  the  remembered  file
              name  is used.  The file name is remembered if there were no remembered file name already.  If the
              read is successful, the number of characters read is printed.  Dot is left at the last  line  read
              from the file.

       (.,.)<b>s</b><u>n</u><b>/</b><u>regular</u> <u>expression</u><b>/</b><u>replacement</u><b>/</b>
       (.,.)<b>s</b><u>n</u><b>/</b><u>regular</u> <u>expression</u><b>/</b><u>replacement</u><b>/g</b>
       (.,.)<b>s</b><u>n</u><b>/</b><u>regular</u> <u>expression</u><b>/</b><u>replacement</u>
              Substitute.  Search each addressed line for an occurrence of the specified regular expression.  On
              each  line  in  which  <u>n</u> matches are found (<u>n</u> defaults to 1 if missing), the <u>n</u>th matched string is
              replaced by the replacement specified.  If the global  replacement  indicator  appears  after  the
              command,  all  subsequent  matches  on  the  line  are  also  replaced.   It  is  an error for the
              substitution to fail on all addressed lines.  Any character other than space  or  newline  may  be
              used  instead  of  to delimit the regular expression and the replacement.  Dot is left at the last
              line substituted.  The third form means <b>s</b><u>n</u><b>/</b><u>regular</u> <u>expression</u><b>/</b><u>replacement</u><b>/p</b>.  The  second  may  be
              omitted if the replacement is empty.

              An  ampersand  appearing  in  the  replacement  is  replaced  by  the  string matching the regular
              expression.  The characters <b>\</b><u>n</u>, where <u>n</u> is a digit, are replaced by the text matched by  the  <u>n</u>-th
              regular subexpression enclosed between and When nested parenthesized subexpressions are present, <u>n</u>
              is determined by counting occurrences of starting from the left.

              A literal or newline may be included in a replacement by prefixing it with

       (.,.)<b>t</b><u>a</u>
              Transfer.   Copy  the addressed lines after the line addressed by <u>a</u>.  Dot is left at the last line
              of the copy.

       (.,.)<b>u</b> Undo.  Restore the preceding contents of the first addressed line (sic), which must  be  the  last
              line in which a substitution was made (double sic).

       (1,$)<b>v/</b><u>regular</u> <u>expression</u><b>/</b><u>command</u> <u>list</u>
              This  command  is the same as the global command except that the command list is executed with dot
              initially set to every line <u>except</u> those matching the regular expression.

       (1,$)<b>w</b> <u>filename</u>
              Write the addressed lines to the given file.  If the file does not exist, it is created with  mode
              666  (readable  and  writable by everyone).  If no <u>filename</u> is given, the remembered file name, if
              any, is used.  The file name is remembered if there were no remembered file name already.  Dot  is
              unchanged.  If the write is successful, the number of characters written is printed.

       (1,$)<b>W</b> <u>filename</u>
              Perform but append to, instead of overwriting, any existing file contents.

       (<b>$</b>)<b>=</b>   Print the line number of the addressed line.  Dot is unchanged.

       <b>!</b><u>shell</u> <u>command</u>
              Send  the  remainder  of  the  line  after  the  to  <u><a href="../man1/rc.1.html">rc</a></u>(1) to be interpreted as a command.  Dot is
              unchanged.

       (<b>.+1</b>)&lt;newline&gt;
              An address without a command is taken as a command.  A terminal may be omitted from  the  address.
              A blank line alone is equivalent to it is useful for stepping through text.

       If an interrupt signal (DEL) is sent, <u>ed</u> prints a and returns to its command level.

       When reading a file, <u>ed</u> discards NUL characters and all characters after the last newline.
