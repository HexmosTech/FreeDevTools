</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       <b>tweak</b> - efficient hex editor

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>tweak</b> [<b>-l</b> | <b>-f</b>] [<b>-e</b>] [<b>-w</b> <u>width</u>] [<b>-o</b> <u>offset</u>] <u>filename</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>tweak</b> is a hex editor. It allows you to edit a file at very low level, letting you see the full and exact
       binary  contents  of  the  file. It can be useful for modifying binary files such as executables, editing
       disk or CD images, debugging programs that generate binary  file  formats  incorrectly,  and  many  other
       things.

       Unlike  simpler  hex  editors,  <b>tweak</b>  possesses  a fully functional insert mode. This is not useful when
       editing many of the types of file described above, but can be useful in other situations. Also, an insert
       mode makes it easy to use <b>tweak</b> to construct new files from scratch.

       When you open a file in <b>tweak</b>, you can expect to see the screen contents looking something like this:

       00000000   7F 45 4C 46 01 01 01 00   .ELF....
       00000008   00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00   ........
       00000010   02 00 03 00 01 00 00 00   ........
       00000018   D0 8E 04 08 34 00 00 00   ....4...
       00000020   2C EF 01 00 00 00 00 00   ,.......

       The central column shows you the hexadecimal value of each byte in the file you are editing.  The  column
       on  the  right shows the ASCII interpretation of those bytes, where applicable. In the example above, the
       sequence <b>45</b> <b>4C</b> <b>46</b> on the first  line  translates  into  the  ASCII  upper-case  letters  `ELF',  but  the
       subsequent  sequence  <b>01</b>  <b>01</b> <b>01</b> <b>00</b> does not have any printable ASCII representation and so the right-hand
       column simply prints dots.

       The column on the left shows the position within the file of the start of each row.

       In fact, when you start <b>tweak</b>, you will usually see 16 bytes of the file per row, not 8 as  shown  above.
       However,  this  is  configurable if your screen is narrower - or wider - than the usual 80 columns, or if
       the file you are editing consists of fixed-size records of some other size.

       By default, <b>tweak</b> does not load its entire input file into memory. Instead, it loads it  <u>lazily</u>,  reading
       from  the  file  on  disk  when you request a view of a part of the file it doesn't have stored. When you
       modify the file, it stores your modifications in memory, but continues to refer to the original disk file
       for the parts you have not touched. This means you can edit extremely large files (for example, entire CD
       images) without difficulty; opening such a file is instantaneous,  making  modifications  causes  <b>tweak</b>'s
       memory  usage  to grow with the size of the changes rather than the size of the whole file, and only when
       saving the altered version will <b>tweak</b> have to read through the entire input file to write the output.

       However, this mode of operation has a disadvantage, which is that  if  the  input  file  is  modified  by
       another  program  while <b>tweak</b> is running, <b>tweak</b>'s internal data structures will not be sufficient to keep
       track, and it is likely that the file written out will contain a mixture of the old and new  contents  of
       the input file. Therefore, you can disable this lazy loading if you need to; see the <b>-e</b> option below.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       This section lists the command-line options supported by <b>tweak</b>.

       <b>-f</b>     Runs <b>tweak</b> in `fix' mode, i.e. with the insert function entirely disabled. This might be useful if
              you  are  editing  a file in which the insert mode is of no use (executables, for example, tend to
              have strong dependencies on precise file offsets which make it almost impossible to insert data in
              one without rendering it unusable) and you want to avoid turning it on by mistake.

       <b>-l</b>     Runs <b>tweak</b> in `look' mode. In this mode <b>tweak</b> does not allow you to modify the  data  at  all;  it
              becomes simply a tool for examining a file in detail.

       <b>-e</b>     Runs  <b>tweak</b>  in `eager' mode. In this mode <b>tweak</b> will read its entire input file when starting up.
              This causes it to take up more memory, but means that it has  no  dependency  on  the  input  file
              remaining unmodified, and other programs can alter it if they need to without causing trouble.

       <b>-w</b> <u>width</u>
              Specifies the number of bytes <b>tweak</b> will display per line. The default is 16, which fits neatly in
              an 80-column screen.

       <b>-o</b> <u>offset</u>
              If this option is specified, <b>tweak</b> will ensure that the given file offset occurs at the start of a
              line.  For example, if you loaded a file using the options <b>-w</b> <b>8</b> <b>-o</b> <b>0x13</b>, you might see a display a
              bit like this:

              00000000                  7F 45 4C        .EL
              00000003   46 01 01 01 00 00 00 00   F.......
              0000000B   00 00 00 00 00 02 00 03   ........
              00000013   00 01 00 00 00 D0 8E 04   ........
              0000001B   08 34 00 00 00 2C EF 01   .4...,..

              By putting only three bytes of the file on the very first line, <b>tweak</b> has arranged that  the  file
              offset 0x13 (19 in decimal) appears at the beginning of the fourth line.

              You might use this option if you knew you were editing a file in a particular format. For example,
              if your file contained a 53-byte header followed by a series of 22-byte records, you might find it
              useful  to  specify  the  options  <b>-w</b>  <b>22</b>  <b>-o</b>  <b>53</b>.  This would arrange that after the header, each
              individual record of the file would appear on precisely one line of <b>tweak</b>'s display.

       <b>-D</b>     If this option is specified, <b>tweak</b> will not attempt to load and edit  a  file  at  all,  but  will
              simply produce its default <b>.tweakrc</b> file on standard output. This is a useful way to give yourself
              a starting point if you want to begin reconfiguring <b>tweak</b>'s keyboard layout.

</pre><h4><b>KEYS</b></h4><pre>
       This  section  describes all the editing keys supported by <b>tweak</b> by default. The default key bindings for
       <b>tweak</b> are basically Emacs-like.

   <b>Movement</b> <b>keys</b>
       The Emacs cursor movement keys should all work, and their counterparts in ordinary function keys ought to
       work too:

       <b>•</b>      <b>^P</b> and <b>^N</b> go to the previous and next lines; Up and Down should do the same.

       <b>•</b>      <b>^B</b> and <b>^F</b> go back and forward one character; Left and Right should do the same.

       <b>•</b>      <b>M-v</b> and <b>^V</b> go up and down one screenful at a time; Page Up and Page Down should do the same.

       <b>•</b>      <b>^A</b> and <b>^E</b> go to the beginning and end of the line; Home and End should do the same.

       Press <b>M-&lt;</b> and <b>M-&gt;</b> go to the beginning and end of the file.

       Press <b>^X</b> <b>g</b> to go to a particular byte position in the file; you will be asked to type in the position you
       want. You can enter it in decimal, or as a hex number with `<b>0x</b>' before it.

   <b>Editing</b> <b>keys</b>
       Press Return to move the cursor between the hex section of the screen and the ASCII section.

       When in the hex section, you can enter hexadecimal digits to alter data; when in the ASCII  section,  you
       can directly type ASCII text.

       In  ASCII  mode,  you  can also press <b>^Q</b> to literally quote the next input character; for example, if you
       want to insert a Control-V, you can press <b>^Q^V</b> and <b>tweak</b> will automatically insert the byte value 0x16.

       Press <b>^X^I</b>, or the Insert key if you have one, to toggle between  overwrite  mode  and  insert  mode.  In
       insert mode, typing hex or ASCII input will insert new bytes containing the values you provide. Also, you
       can then press Backspace to delete the byte to the left of the cursor, or <b>^D</b> or Delete to delete the byte
       under the cursor.

   <b>Cut</b> <b>and</b> <b>paste</b>
       Press  <b>^@</b>  (this  character  may be generated by the key combination Control-@, or Control-2, or Control-
       Space) to mark the end of a selection region. After you do this, the bytes  between  that  mark  and  the
       cursor will be highlighted. Press <b>^@</b> again to abandon the selection.

       Press <b>M-w</b> while a selection is active to copy the selected region into <b>tweak</b>'s cut buffer.

       In  insert mode, you also have the option of pressing <b>^W</b> to <u>cut</u> the selected region completely out of the
       file and place it in the cut buffer.

       Finally, press <b>^Y</b> to paste the cut buffer contents back into the file  (this  will  overwrite  or  insert
       depending on the current mode).

   <b>Searching</b>
       Press  <b>^S</b> to search for a byte sequence. You will be asked to enter some text to search for on the bottom
       line of the screen. You can type this text in ASCII, or as a sequence of hex byte  values  prefixed  with
       backslashes  (<b>\</b>). For example, if you wanted to search for the byte value 5 followed by the word `hello',
       you might enter <b>\05hello</b>. If you want to specify a literal backslash character, you can either  enter  it
       in hex (as <b>\5C</b>), or simply double it on input (<b>\\</b>).

       Press <b>^R</b> to search backwards instead of forwards from the current cursor position.

       Since <b>tweak</b> deals in pure binary data, searches are always case-sensitive.

   <b>Controlling</b> <b>the</b> <b>display</b>
       If  you  press  <b>^X</b> <b>w</b>, you will be asked to enter a new display width. This has the same effect as passing
       the <b>-w</b> option on the command line. Similarly, pressing <b>^X</b> <b>o</b> allows you to enter  a  new  display  offset,
       equivalent to the <b>-o</b> option.

       By  default,  the current file position and file size are displayed on <b>tweak</b>'s status line in hex. If you
       prefer them in decimal, you can press <b>^X</b> <b>x</b> or <b>^X</b> <b>h</b> to toggle them between hex and decimal.

   <b>Miscellaneous</b>
       Press <b>^L</b> to redraw the screen and recentre the cursor. Press <b>^Z</b> to suspend <b>tweak</b> and  return  temporarily
       to the shell.

       Press <b>^X^S</b> to save the file you are editing.

       Press  <b>^X^C</b>  to  exit  <b>tweak</b>. (If you do this with changes unsaved, you will be asked whether you want to
       save them.)

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>FILE</b></h4><pre>
       <b>tweak</b>'s keyboard bindings are configurable. It will attempt to read  a  file  from  your  home  directory
       called  <b>.tweakrc</b>,  and  if it finds one it will use the keyboard bindings described in it. If it does not
       find one, it will use its internal default bindings.

       Most of the directives in <b>.tweakrc</b> are of the form `<b>bind</b>  <b>command-name</b>  <b>key</b>'.  For  example,  `<b>bind</b>  <b>exit</b>
       <b>^X^C</b>'.  Additionally,  there  are  two other directives, <b>width</b> and <b>offset</b>, which give the default display
       parameters if no <b>-w</b> and <b>-o</b> options are specified.

       The easiest way to learn about the <b>.tweakrc</b> file is to begin by having <b>tweak</b> output its internal  default
       one:

       tweak -D &gt; $HOME/.tweakrc

       Then  you can read the default file, learn the <b>tweak</b> internal command names, and edit the file to do what
       you want.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       This man page probably ought to contain an explicit list of internal command names,  rather  than  simply
       referring you to the default <b>.tweakrc</b>.
