</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       JOE is a powerful ASCII text screen editor.  It has a "mode-less" user interface which is similar to many
       user-friendly  PC  editors.   Users  of  Micro-Pro's WordStar or Borland's "Turbo" languages will feel at
       home.  JOE is a full featured UNIX screen editor though, and has many features for editing  programs  and
       text.

       JOE  also  emulates  several  other  editors.   JSTAR  is  a  close imitation of WordStar with many "JOE"
       extensions.  JPICO is a close imitation  of  the  Pine  mailing  system's  PICO  editor,  but  with  many
       extensions and improvements.  JMACS is a GNU EMACS imitation.  RJOE is a restricted version of JOE, which
       allows you to edit only the files specified on the command line.

       Although  JOE  is actually six different editors, it still requires only one executable, but one with six
       different names.  The name of the editor with an "rc" appended gives the  name  of  JOE's  initialisation
       file, which determines the personality of the editor.

       JUPP  is  free software; you can distribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public
       License, Version 1, as published by the Free Software Foundation.  See  main.c  (contains  more  detailed
       exceptions).   I  have no plans for turning JOE into a commercial or shareware product.  Check the source
       code for  exact  authorship  and  licencing  information.   JOE  is  available  over  the  Internet  from
       <b><a href="http://joe-editor.sf.net/">http://joe-editor.sf.net/</a></b>.  JUPP is available at <b><a href="http://mirbsd.de/jupp">http://mirbsd.de/jupp</a></b>.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       To  start  the editor, type <b>joe</b> followed by zero or more names of files you want to edit.  Each file name
       may be preceded by a local option setting (see the local options  table  which  follows).   Other  global
       options,  which  apply  to  the editor as a whole, may also be placed on the command line (see the global
       options table which follows).  If you are editing a new file, you can either give the  name  of  the  new
       file when you invoke the editor, or in the editor when you save the new file.  A modified syntax for file
       names  is  provided  to  allow you to edit program output, standard input/output, or sections of files or
       devices.  See the section <b>Filenames</b> below for details.

       On cygwin32 systems, the special option <b>-CYGhack</b>  is  replaced  by  anything  that  comes  past  it  (and
       separating  whitespace)  on  the  command  line  as  <u>one</u> option (to work around a Cygwin bug as it cannot
       correctly be passed a UNC pathname with spaces as one argument from Explorer <u>at</u> <u>all</u>).

       Once you are in the editor, you can type in text and use special control character sequences  to  perform
       other  editing  tasks.   To  find out what the control character sequences are, read the rest of this man
       page or type <b>^K</b> <b>H</b> for help in the editor.

       Now for some obscure computer lore:

       The <b>^</b> means that you hold down the <b>Control</b> key while pressing the following key (the same way  the  <b>Shift</b>
       key  works  for  uppercase  letters).  A number of control key sequences are duplicated on other keys, so
       that you don't need to press the control key: <b>ESC</b> will work in place of <b>^[</b>, <b>Del</b> will work in place of <b>^?</b>,
       <b>Backspace</b> will work in place of <b>^H</b>, <b>Tab</b> will work in place of <b>^I</b>, <b>Return</b> or <b>Enter</b> will work in  place  of
       <b>^M</b>  and  <b>Linefeed</b>  will work in place of <b>^J</b>.  Some keyboards may give you trouble with some control keys.
       <b>^_</b>, <b>^^</b> and <b>^@</b> can usually be entered without pressing shift (I.E., try <b>^-</b>, <b>^6</b> and <b>^2</b>).   Other  keyboards
       may  reassign  these  to other keys.  Try: <b>^.</b>, <b>^,</b> and <b>^/</b>.  <b>^SPACE</b> can usually be used in place of <b>^@</b>.  <b>^\</b>
       and <b>^]</b> are interpreted by many communication programs, including telnet and kermit.  Usually you just hit
       the key twice to get it to pass through the communication program.

       Once you have typed <b>^K</b> <b>H</b>, the first help window appears at the top of the screen.  You  can  continue  to
       enter and edit text while the help window is on.  To page through other topics, hit ^[, and ^[. (that is,
       ESC , and ESC .).  Use <b>^K</b> <b>H</b> to dismiss the help window.

       You  can  customise  the  keyboard  layout, the help screens and a number of behavior defaults by copying
       JOE's initialisation file (usually <b>/etc/jupp/joerc</b>)  to  <b>.joerc</b>  in  your  home  directory  and  then  by
       modifying  it.   See the section <b>joerc</b> below.  The filename is actually <b>.</b><u>name</u><b>rc</b> where <u>name</u> is the <b>argv[0]</b>
       the editor is called with.

       Custom syntax files are loaded from <b>.jupp/syntax/</b><u>name</u><b>.jsf</b> in your home directory and  <b>.jupp/charmaps/</b><u>name</u>
       holds custom charmaps (<u>name</u> here is the name of the syntax or charmap).

       To  have  JOE  used  as  your  default  editor  for eMail and News, you need to set the <b>EDITOR</b> and <b>VISUAL</b>
       environment variables in your shell initialisation file (<b>.cshrc</b> or <b>.profile</b>) to refer  to  JOE  (the  joe
       binary usually resides as <b>/usr/bin/joe</b>).

       There  are a number of other obscure invocation parameters which may have to be set, particularly if your
       terminal screen is not updating as you think it should.  See the section <b>Environment</b> <b>variables</b> below.

</pre><h4><b>COMMAND</b> <b>LINE</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The following global options may be specified on the command line:

       -asis  Characters with codes above 127 will be sent to the terminal as-is, instead of as inverse  of  the
              corresponding character below 128.  If this does not work, check your terminal server.

       -backpath path
              If this option is given, backup files will be stored in the specified directory instead of in each
              file's original directory.

       -baud nnn
              Set  the  baud rate for the purposes of terminal screen optimisation.  Joe inserts delays for baud
              rates below 19200, which bypasses tty buffering  so  that  typeahead  will  interrupt  the  screen
              output.   Scrolling  commands  will  not  be  used  for  38400  baud.  This is useful for X-Window
              terminals and other console ttys which really aren't going over a serial line.

       -beep  Joe will beep on command errors and when the cursor goes past extremes.

       -columns nnn
              Sets the number of screen columns.

       -csmode
              Continued search mode: a search immediately following a search will  repeat  the  previous  search
              instead of prompting for new string.  This is useful for the the ^[S and ^[R commands and for when
              joe is trying to be emacs.

       -dopadding
              Joe  usually  assumes  that  there  is some kind of flow control between it and the tty.  If there
              isn't, this option will make joe output extra ^@s to the tty as specified by  the  termcap  entry.
              The extra ^@s allow the terminal to catch up after long terminal commands.

       -exask This option makes ^KX verify the file name that it's about to write.

       -force This option makes sure that the last line of the file has a line feed when it is saved.

       -help  The editor will start with the help screen on if this option is given.

       -keepup
              Normally  the  column number and control-key prefix fields of the status lines are on a one second
              delay to reduce CPU consumption, but with this option they are updated after each keystroke.

       -lightoff
              The block highlighting will go away after any block command if this option is given.

       -lines nnn
              Sets the number of screen lines.

       -marking
              Text between ^KB and the cursor is highlighted (use with -lightoff and a modified  joerc  file  to
              have drop-anchor style block selection).

       -mid   If this option is set and the cursor moves off the window, the window will be scrolled so that the
              cursor  is  in  the  center.   This  option is forced on slow terminals which don't have scrolling
              commands.

       -nobackups
              This option prevents backup files.

       -nonotice
              This option prevent the copyright notice from being displayed when the editor starts.

       -nosta This option eliminates the topmost status line.  It's nice for when you only want to see your text
              on the screen or if you're using a vt52.

       -noxon Attempt to turn off ^S/^Q processing.  This is useful for when joe is trying  to  be  WordStar  or
              EMACS.

       -orphan
              When  this  option  is  active, extra files on the command line will be placed in orphaned buffers
              instead of in extra windows.  This is useful for when joe is trying to be emacs.

       -pg nnn
              This specifies the number of lines to keep after PgUp/PgDn (^U/^V).  If  -1  is  given,  half  the
              window is kept.

       -skiptop nnn
              Don't use the top nnn lines of the screen.  Useful for when joe is used as a BBS editor.

       Each  of  these options may be specified in the joerc file as well.  In addition, the NOXON, BAUD, LINES,
       COLUMNS and DOPADDING options may be specified with environment variables.  See the  section  <b>Environment</b>
       <b>variables</b> below.

       The following options may be specified before each filename on the command line:

       +nnn   The cursor starts on the specified line.

       -crlf  Joe  uses CR-LF as the end of line sequence instead of just LF.  This is for editing MS-DOS or VMS
              files.

       -hex   Sets the buffer to hex edit mode.

       -wordwrap
              Joe wraps the previous word when you type past the right margin.

       -autoindent
              When you hit Return on an indented line, the indentation is duplicated onto the new line.

       -overwrite
              Typing overwrites existing characters instead of inserting before them.

       -lmargin nnn
              Sets the left margin.

       -rmargin nnn
              Sets the right margin.

       -tab nnn
              Sets the tab width.

       -indentc nnn
              Sets the indentation character for ^K, and ^K. (32 for SPACE, 9 for TAB).

       -istep nnn
              Sets the indentation step for ^K, and ^K..

       -linums
              Line numbers are displayed before each line.

       -rdonly
              The file is read only.

       -keymap name
              Use an alternate section of the joerc file for the  key  sequence  bindings.   For  example,  <b>joe,</b>
              <b>jstar,</b>  <b>rjoe</b>  and  <b>jupp</b>  support  <b>-keymap</b>  <b>cua</b>  to  make ^Z, ^X, ^C and ^V do the same thing as in
              contemporary GUI editors.

       These options can also be specified in the joerc file.   They  can  be  set  depending  on  the  filename
       extension.   Programs  (.c,  .h or .p extension) usually have autoindent enabled.  Wordwrap is enabled on
       other files, but rc files have it disabled.

</pre><h4><b>EDITING</b> <b>TASKS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Basic</b> <b>Editing</b>
       When you type characters into the editor, they are normally inserted  into  the  file  being  edited  (or
       appended  to the file if the cursor is at the end of the file).  This is the normal operating mode of the
       editor.  If you want to replace some existing text, you have to delete the old text before or  after  you
       type  in the replacement text.  The <b>Backspace</b> key can be used for deleting text: move the cursor to right
       after the text you want to delete and hit <b>Backspace</b> a number of times.

       Hit the <b>Enter</b> or <b>Return</b> key to insert a line break.  For example, if the cursor was in the  middle  of  a
       line  and  you  hit  <b>Return</b>,  the  line  would  be  split into two lines with the cursor appearing at the
       beginning of the second line.  Hit <b>Backspace</b> at the beginning of a line to eliminate a line break.

       Use the arrow keys to move around the file.  If your keyboard doesn't have arrow keys (or if  they  don't
       work  for  some  reason), use <b>^F</b> to move forwards (right), <b>^B</b> to move backwards (left), <b>^P</b> to move to the
       previous line (up), and <b>^N</b> to move to the next line (down).  The right and left arrow  keys  simply  move
       forwards  or backwards one character at a time through the text: if you're at the beginning of a line and
       you press left-arrow, you will end up at the end of the previous line.  The up and down arrow  keys  move
       forwards  and backwards by enough characters so that the cursor appears in the same column that it was in
       on the original line.

       If you want to indent the text you enter, you can use the  <b>TAB</b>  key.   This  inserts  a  special  control
       character  which  makes  the  characters  which follow it begin at the next TAB STOP.  TAB STOPS normally
       occur every 8 columns, but this can be changed with the <b>^T</b> <b>D</b> command.  Python programmers often  set  TAB
       STOPS on every 4 columns.

       If  for  some  reason your terminal screen gets messed up (for example, if you receive a mail notice from
       biff), you can have the editor refresh the screen by hitting <b>^R</b>.

       There are many other keys for deleting text and moving around the file.  For example, hit  <b>^D</b>  to  delete
       the  character the cursor is on instead of deleting backwards like <b>Backspace</b>.  <b>^D</b> will also delete a line
       break if the cursor is at the end of a line.  Type <b>^Y</b> to delete the entire line the cursor is on or <b>^J</b> to
       delete just from the cursor to the end of the line.

       Hit <b>^A</b> to move the cursor to the beginning of the line it's on.  Hit <b>^E</b> to move the cursor to the end  of
       the line.  Hit <b>^U</b> or <b>^V</b> for scrolling the cursor up or down 1/2 a screen's worth.  "Scrolling" means that
       the text on the screen moves, but the cursor stays at the same place relative to the screen.  Hit <b>^K</b> <b>U</b> or
       <b>^K</b>  <b>V</b> to move the cursor to the beginning or the end of the file.  Look at the help screens in the editor
       to find even more delete and movement commands.

       If you make a mistake, you can hit <b>^_</b> to "undo" it.  On most keyboards you hit just <b>^-</b> to get <b>^_</b>, but  on
       some  you  might  have  to  hold both the <b>Shift</b> and <b>Control</b> keys down at the same time to get it.  If you
       "undo" too much, you can "redo" the changes back into existence by hitting <b>^^</b> (type this with just <b>^6</b>  on
       most keyboards).

       If you were editing in one place within the file, and you then temporarily had to look or edit some other
       place  within  the  file,  you  can get back to the original place by hitting <b>^K-</b>.  This command actually
       returns you to the last place you made a change in the file.  You can step through a  history  of  places
       with <b>^K-</b> and <b>^K</b> <b>=</b>, in the same way you can step through the history of changes with the "undo" and "redo"
       commands.

       When you are done editing the file, hit <b>^K</b> <b>X</b> to exit the editor.  You will be prompted for a file name if
       you hadn't already named the file you were editing.

       When  you  edit  a file, you actually edit only a copy of the file.  So if you decide that you don't want
       the changes you made to a file during a particular edit session, you  can  hit  <b>^C</b>  to  exit  the  editor
       without saving them.

       If  you  edit  a  file  and  save  the  changes,  a  "backup" copy of that file is created in the current
       directory, with a ~ appended to the name, which contains the original version of the file.

   <b>Word</b> <b>wrap</b> <b>and</b> <b>formatting</b>
       If you type past the right edge of the screen in a C language or PASCAL file, the screen will  scroll  to
       the  right  to  follow  the  cursor.  If you type past the right edge of the screen in a normal file (one
       whose name doesn't end in .c, .h or .p), JOE will automatically wrap the last word onto the next line  so
       that  you  don't  have  to hit <b>Return</b>.  This is called word-wrap mode.  Word-wrap can be turned on or off
       with the <b>^T</b> <b>W</b> command.  JOE's initialisation file is usually set up so that this  mode  is  automatically
       turned  on  for  all non-program files.  See the section below on the <b>joerc</b> file to change this and other
       defaults.

       Aside for Word-wrap mode, JOE does not automatically keep paragraphs formatted like some word processors.
       Instead, if you need a paragraph to be reformatted, hit <b>^K</b> <b>J</b>.  This command "fills in" the paragraph that
       the cursor is in, fitting as many words in a line as is possible.  A paragraph, in this case, is a  block
       of  text separated above and below by a blank line or a line beginning with a period (".").  Lines can be
       indented by tab, any of the <b>!#$%&amp;)*+,-./:;=&gt;?@\]^_|}~</b> characters or spaces.

       The margins which JOE uses for paragraph formatting and word-wrap can be set with  the  <b>^T</b>  <b>L</b>  and  <b>^T</b>  <b>R</b>
       commands.  If the left margin is set to a value other than 1, then when you start typing at the beginning
       of a line, the cursor will immediately jump to the left margin.

       If you want to center a line within the margins, use the <b>^K</b> <b>A</b> command.

   <b>Overtype</b> <b>mode</b>
       Sometimes  it's  tiresome  to have to delete old text before or after you insert new text.  This happens,
       for example, when you are changing a table and you want to maintain the column position of the right side
       of the table.  When this occurs, you can put the editor in overtype mode with <b>^T</b> <b>T</b>.  When the  editor  is
       in  this mode, the characters you type in replace existing characters, in the way an idealised typewriter
       would.  Additionally, <b>Backspace</b> simply moves left instead of deleting the character  to  the  left,  when
       it's  not  at  the end or beginning of a line.  Overtype mode is not the natural way of dealing with text
       electronically, so you should go back to insert mode as soon as possible by typing <b>^T</b> <b>T</b> again.

       If you need to insert while you're in overtype mode, hit <b>^@</b>.  This inserts a single SPACE into the text.

   <b>Control</b> <b>and</b> <b>Meta</b> <b>characters</b>
       Each character is represented by a number.  For example, the number for 'A' is 65 and the number for  '1'
       is  49.   All  of  the  characters  which  you  normally see have numbers in the range of 32 to 126 (this
       particular arbitrary assignment between characters and numbers is called the ASCII character  set).   The
       numbers  outside of this range, from 0 to 255, aren't usually displayed, but sometimes have other special
       meanings.  The number 10, for example, is used for the line breaks.  You can enter  these  special,  non-
       displayed <b>control</b> <b>characters</b> by first hitting <b>`</b> and then hitting a character in the range <b>@</b> <b>A</b> <b>B</b> <b>C</b> <b>...</b> <b>X</b> <b>Y</b>
       <b>Z</b>  <b>[</b>  <b>^</b>  <b>]</b> <b>\</b> <b>_</b> to get the number 0 to 31, and ? to get 127.  For example, if you hit <b>`</b> <b>J</b>, you'll insert a
       line break character, or if you hit <b>`</b> <b>I</b>, you'll insert a TAB character (which does the same thing the TAB
       key does).  A useful control character to enter is 12 (<b>`</b> <b>L</b>), which causes most printers to advance to the
       top of the page.  You'll notice that JOE displays this character as an underlined L.  You can  enter  the
       characters  above  127,  the  <b>meta</b>  <b>characters</b>, by first hitting <b>^\</b>.  This adds 128 to the next (possibly
       control) character entered.  JOE displays characters above 128 in inverse video.  Some foreign languages,
       which have more letters than English, use the meta characters for the rest of their alphabet.   You  have
       to put the editor in <b>as-is</b> mode (described later) to have these passed untranslated to the terminal.

   <b>Prompts</b>
       If  you  hit  <b>TAB</b>  at  any file name prompt, joe will attempt to complete the name you entered as much as
       possible.  If it couldn't complete the entire name, because there are more than one possible completions,
       joe beeps.  If you hit <b>TAB</b> again, joe list the completions.  You can use the arrow keys  to  move  around
       this directory menu and press RETURN or SPACE to select an item.  If you press the first letter of one of
       the  directory  entries,  it  will  be selected, or if more than one entry has the same first letter, the
       cursor will jump between those entries.  If you select a  subdirectory  or  ..,  the  directory  name  is
       appended  to  the prompt and the new directory is loaded into the menu.  You can hit Backspace to go back
       to the previous directory.

       Most prompts record a history of the responses you give them.  You can hit up  and  down  arrow  to  step
       through these histories.

       Prompts are actually single line windows with no status line, so you can use any editing command that you
       normally  use  on  text  within the prompts.  The prompt history is actually just other lines of the same
       "prompt file".  Thus you can can search backwards though the prompt history with the normal <b>^K</b> <b>F</b>  command
       if you want.

       Since prompts are windows, you can also switch out of them with <b>^K</b> <b>P</b> and <b>^K</b> <b>N</b>.

   <b>Where</b> <b>am</b> <b>I?</b>
       Hit  <b>^K</b>  <b>SPACE</b> to have JOE report the line number, column number, and byte number on the last line of the
       screen.  The number associated with the character the cursor is on (its ASCII code) is also  shown.   You
       can  have the line number and/or column number always displayed on the status line by setting placing the
       appropriate escape sequences in the status line setup strings.  Edit the joerc file for details.

   <b>File</b> <b>operations</b>
       You can hit <b>^K</b> <b>D</b> to save the current file (possibly under a different name from what the file was  called
       originally).  After the file is saved, you can hit <b>^K</b> <b>E</b> to edit a different file.

       If you want to save only a selected section of the file, see the section on <b>Blocks</b> below.

       If you want to include another file in the file you're editing, use <b>^K</b> <b>R</b> to insert it.

   <b>Temporarily</b> <b>suspending</b> <b>the</b> <b>editor</b>
       If you need to temporarily stop the editor and go back to the shell, hit <b>^K</b> <b>Z</b>.  You might want to do this
       to stop whatever you're editing and answer an eMail message or read this man page, for example.  You have
       to type <b>fg</b> or <b>exit</b> (you'll be told which when you hit <b>^K</b> <b>Z</b>) to return to the editor.

   <b>Searching</b> <b>for</b> <b>text</b>
       Hit  <b>^K</b> <b>F</b> to have the editor search forwards or backwards for a text fragment (<b>string</b>) for you.  You will
       be prompted for the text to search for.  After you hit <b>Return</b>, you are prompted to  enter  options.   You
       can  just  hit <b>Return</b> again to have the editor immediately search forwards for the text, or you can enter
       one or more of these options:

       <b>b</b>      Search backwards instead of forwards.

       <b>i</b>      Treat uppercase and lower case letters  as  the  same  when  searching.   Normally  uppercase  and
              lowercase letters are considered to be different.

       <b>nnn</b>    (where  <b>nnn</b>  is  a number) If you enter a number, JOE searches for the Nth occurrence of the text.
              This is useful for going to specific places in files structured in some regular manner.

       <b>r</b>      Replace text.  If you enter the <b>r</b> option, then you will be further prompted for replacement  text.
              Each time the editor finds the search text, you will be prompted as to whether you want to replace
              the found search text with the replacement text.  You hit: <b>y</b> to replace the text and then find the
              next  occurrence,  <b>n</b>  to not replace this text, but to then find the next occurrence, <b>l</b> to replace
              the text and then stop searching, <b>r</b> to replace all of the remaining occurrences of the search text
              in the remainder of the file without asking for confirmation (subject to the <b>nnn</b> option above), or
              <b>^C</b> to stop searching and replacing.

       You can hit <b>^L</b> to repeat the previous search.

   <b>Regular</b> <b>Expressions</b>
       A number of special character sequences may be entered as search text:

       <b>\*</b>     This finds zero or more characters.  For example, if you give <b>A\*B</b> as the search  text,  JOE  will
              try to find an A followed by any number of characters and then a B.

       <b>\?</b>     This finds exactly one character.  For example, if you give <b>A\?B</b> as the search text, JOE will find
              AXB, but not AB or AXXB.

       <b>\^</b> <b>\$</b>  These  match  the  beginning  and end of a line.  For example, if you give <b>\^test\$</b>, then JOE with
              find <b>test</b> on a line by itself.

       <b>\&lt;</b> <b>\&gt;</b>  These match the beginning and end of a word.  For example, if you give <b>\&lt;\*is\*\&gt;</b>, then  joe  will
              find whole words which have the substring <b>is</b> within them.

       <b>\[...]</b> This  matches any single character which appears within the brackets.  For example, if <b>\[Tt]his</b> is
              entered as the search string, then JOE finds both <b>This</b> and <b>this</b>.   Ranges  of  characters  can  be
              entered  within  the  brackets.   For  example,  <b>\[A-Z]</b>  finds any uppercase letter.  If the first
              character given in the brackets is <b>^</b>, then JOE tries to find any character not given  in  the  the
              brackets.

       <b>\c</b>     This  works like <b>\*</b>, but matches a balanced C-language expression.  For example, if you search for
              <b>malloc(\c)</b>, then JOE will find all function calls to <b>malloc</b>, even if there  was  a  <b>)</b>  within  the
              parenthesis.

       <b>\+</b>     This  finds  zero  or more of the character which immediately follows the <b>\+</b>.  For example, if you
              give <b>\[</b> <b>]\+\[</b> <b>]</b>, where the characters within the brackets are both SPACE and TAB,  then  JOE  will
              find whitespace.

       <b>\\</b>     Matches a single \.

       <b>\n</b>     This finds the special end-of-line or line-break character.

       A number of special character sequences may also be given in the replacement string:

       <b>\&amp;</b>     This gets replaced by the text which matched the search string.  For example, if the search string
              was <b>\&lt;\*\&gt;</b>, which matches words, and you give <b>"\&amp;"</b>, then joe will put quote marks around words.

       <b>\0</b> <b>-</b> <b>\9</b>
              These get replaced with the text which matched the Nth <b>\*</b>, <b>\?</b>, <b>\+</b>, <b>\c</b>, <b>\+</b>, or <b>\[...]</b> in the search
              string.

       <b>\\</b>     Use this if you need to put a <b>\</b> in the replacement string.

       <b>\n</b>     Use this if you need to put a line break in the replacement string.

       Some examples:

       Suppose  you have a list of addresses, each on a separate line, which starts with "Address:" and has each
       element separated by commas.  Like so:

       Address: S. Holmes, 221b Baker St., London, England

       If you wanted to rearrange the list, to get the country first, then the city, then the person's name, and
       then the address, you could do this:

       Type <b>^K</b> <b>F</b> to start the search, and type:

       <b>Address:\*,\*,\*,\*\$</b>

       to match "Address:", the four comma-separated elements, and then the end of the  line.   When  asked  for
       options, you would type <b>r</b> to replace the string, and then type:

       <b>Address:\3,\2,\0,\1</b>

       To  shuffle  the  information  the way you want it. After hitting return, the search would begin, and the
       sample line would be changed to:

       Address: England, London, S. Holmes, 221b Baker St.

   <b>Blocks</b>
       If you want to move, copy, save or delete a specific section of text, you  can  do  it  with  highlighted
       blocks.   First, move the cursor to the start of the section of text you want to work on, and press <b>^K</b> <b>B</b>.
       Then move the cursor to the character just after the end of the text you want to affect and press  <b>^K</b>  <b>K</b>.
       The  text between the <b>^K</b> <b>B</b> and <b>^K</b> <b>K</b> should become highlighted.  Now you can move your cursor to someplace
       else in your document and press <b>^K</b> <b>M</b> to move the highlighted text there.  You can press <b>^K</b> <b>C</b>  to  make  a
       copy  of  the  highlighted  text  and  insert  it to where the cursor is positioned.  <b>^K</b> <b>Y</b> to deletes the
       highlighted text.  <b>^K</b> <b>W</b>, writes the highlighted text to a file.

       A very useful command is <b>^K</b> <b>/</b>, which filters a block of text through a unix command.  For example, if you
       select a list of words with <b>^K</b> <b>B</b> and <b>^K</b> <b>K</b>, and then type <b>^K</b> <b>/</b> <b>sort</b>, the list of  words  will  be  sorted.
       Another useful unix command for <b>^K</b> <b>/</b>, is <b>tr</b>.  If you type <b>^K</b> <b>/</b> <b>tr</b> <b>a-z</b> <b>A-Z</b>, then all of the letters in the
       highlighted block will be converted to uppercase.

       After  you  are  finished with some block operations, you can just leave the highlighting on if you don't
       mind it (of course, if you accidentally hit <b>^K</b>  <b>Y</b>  without  noticing...).   If  it  really  bothers  you,
       however, just hit <b>^K</b> <b>B</b> <b>^K</b> <b>K</b>, to turn the highlighting off.

   <b>Indenting</b> <b>program</b> <b>blocks</b>
       Auto-indent  mode  toggled  with the <b>^T</b> <b>I</b> command.  The <b>joerc</b> is normally set up so that files with names
       ending with .p, .c or .h have auto-indent mode enabled.  When auto-indent mode is  enabled  and  you  hit
       <b>Return</b>, the cursor will be placed in the same column that the first non-SPACE/TAB character was in on the
       original line.

       You can use the <b>^K</b> <b>,</b> and <b>^K</b> <b>.</b> commands to shift a block of text to the left or right.  If no highlighting
       is  set  when  you  give these commands, the program block the cursor is located in will be selected, and
       will be moved by subsequent <b>^K</b> <b>,</b> and <b>^K</b> <b>.</b> commands.  The number of columns these commands shift by can be
       set through a <b>^T</b> option.

   <b>Windows</b>
       You can edit more than one file at the same time or edit two or more different places of the  same  file.
       To do this, hit <b>^K</b> <b>O</b>, to split the screen into two windows.  Use <b>^K</b> <b>P</b> or <b>^K</b> <b>N</b> to move the cursor into the
       top  window  or  the  lower window.  Use <b>^K</b> <b>E</b> to edit a new file in one of the windows.  A window will go
       away when you save the file with <b>^K</b> <b>X</b> or abort the file with <b>^C</b>.  If you abort a file which exists in two
       windows, one of the window goes away, not the file.

       You can hit <b>^K</b> <b>O</b> within a window to create even more windows.  If  you  have  too  many  windows  on  the
       screen,  but  you  don't  want  to  eliminate them, you can hit <b>^K</b> <b>I</b>.  This will show only the window the
       cursor is in, or if there was only one window on the screen to begin with, try to fit all hidden  windows
       on the screen.  If there are more windows than can fit on the screen, you can hit <b>^K</b> <b>N</b> on the bottom-most
       window or <b>^K</b> <b>P</b> on the top-most window to get to them.

       If  you  gave more than one file name to JOE on the command line, each file will be placed in a different
       window.

       You can change the height of the windows with the <b>^K</b> <b>G</b> and <b>^K</b> <b>T</b> commands.

   <b>Keyboard</b> <b>macros</b>
       Macros allow you to record a series of keystrokes and replay them with the press of two  keys.   This  is
       useful  to  automate  repetitive  tasks.   To start a macro recording, hit <b>^K</b> <b>[</b> followed by a number from
       0 to 9.  The status line will display (Macro n recording...).  Now, type in the series of keystrokes that
       you want to be able to repeat.  The commands you type will have their usual effect.  Hit  <b>^K</b>  <b>]</b>  to  stop
       recording the macro.  Hit <b>^K</b> followed by the number you recorded the macro in to execute one iteration of
       the keystrokes.

       For example, if you want to put "**" in front of a number of lines, you can type:

       <b>^K</b> <b>[</b> <b>^A</b> <b>**</b> &lt;down arrow&gt; <b>^K</b> <b>]</b>

       Which  starts the macro recording, moves the cursor to the beginning of the line, inserts "**", moves the
       cursor down one line, and then ends the recording.  Since we included the keystrokes needed  to  position
       the  cursor  on  the  next  line,  we  can  repeatedly  use  this macro without having to move the cursor
       ourselves, something you should always keep in mind when recording a macro.

       If you find that the macro you are recording itself has a repeated set  of  keystrokes  in  it,  you  can
       record  a  macro  within  the  macro,  as long as you use a different macro number.  Also you can execute
       previously recorded macros from within new macros.

   <b>Repeat</b>
       You can use the repeat command, <b>^K</b> <b>\</b>, to repeat a macro, or any other  edit  command  or  even  a  normal
       character,  a  specified  number  of  times.   Hit <b>^K</b> <b>\</b>, type in the number of times you want the command
       repeated and press <b>Return</b>.  The next edit command you now give will be repeated that many times.

       For example, to delete the next 20 lines of text, type:

       <b>^K</b>  <b>20</b>&lt;return&gt;<b>^Y</b>

   <b>Rectangle</b> <b>mode</b>
       Type <b>^T</b> <b>X</b> to have <b>^K</b> <b>B</b> and <b>^K</b> <b>K</b> select rectangular blocks instead of stream-of-text blocks.  This mode is
       useful for moving, copying, deleting or saving columns of text.  You can also filter columns of text with
       the <b>^K</b> <b>/</b> command — if you want to sort a column, for example.  The insert file  command,  <b>^K</b>  <b>R</b>  is  also
       effected.

       When  rectangle  mode  is selected, overtype mode (<b>^T</b> <b>T</b>) is also useful.  When overtype mode is selected,
       rectangles will replace existing text instead of getting inserted  before  it.   Also  the  delete  block
       command  (<b>^K</b>  <b>Y</b>) will clear the selected rectangle with SPACEs and TABs instead of deleting it.  Overtype
       mode is especially useful for the filter block command (<b>^K</b> <b>/</b>), since it will maintain the original  width
       of the selected column.

   <b>Tag</b> <b>search</b>
       If  you are editing a large C program with many source files, you can use the <b>ctags</b> program to generate a
       <b>tags</b> file.  This file contains a list of program symbols and the files and positions  where  the  symbols
       are  defined.  The <b>^K</b> <b>;</b> command can be used to lookup a symbol (functions, defined constants, etc.), load
       the file where the symbol is defined into the current window and position the cursor to where the  symbol
       is  defined.   <b>^K</b>  <b>;</b>  prompts  you  for  the  symbol you want, but uses the symbol the cursor was on as a
       default.  Since <b>^K</b> <b>;</b> loads the definition file into the current window, you probably want  to  split  the
       window first with <b>^K</b> <b>O</b>, to have both the original file and the definition file loaded.

   <b>Shell</b> <b>windows</b>
       Hit <b>^K</b> <b>'</b> to run a command shell in one of JOE's windows.  When the cursor is at the end of a shell window
       (use  <b>^K</b> <b>V</b> if it's not), whatever you type is passed to the shell instead of the window.  Any output from
       the shell or from commands executed in the shell is appended to the shell window (the cursor will  follow
       this output if it's at the end of the shell window).  This command is useful for recording the results of
       shell  commands — for  example the output of <b>make</b>, the result of <b>grep</b>ping a set of files for a string, or
       directory listings from <b>FTP</b> sessions.  Besides typeable characters, the keys ^C, Backspace,  DEL,  Return
       and  ^D  are  passed  to  the shell.  Type the shell <b>exit</b> command to stop recording shell output.  If you
       press <b>^C</b> in a shell window, when the cursor is not at the end of the window, the shell is <b>kill</b>ed.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       For JOE to operate correctly, a number of other environment settings must  be  correct.   The  throughput
       (baud  rate)  of  the  connection between the computer and your terminal must be set correctly for JOE to
       update the screen smoothly and allow typeahead to defer the screen update.  Use the <b>stty</b> <b>nnn</b>  command  to
       set  this.  You want to set it as close as possible to actual throughput of the connection.  For example,
       if you are connected via a 1200 baud modem, you want to use this value for <b>stty</b>.  If  you  are  connected
       via  14.4k  modem, but the terminal server you are connected to connects to the computer a 9600 baud, you
       want to set your speed as 9600 baud.  The special baud rate of 38400 or <b>extb</b> is used to indicate that you
       have a very high-speed connection, such as a memory mapped console or an X-Window terminal emulator.   If
       you  can't  use  <b>stty</b>  to  set  the  actual throughput (perhaps because of a modem communicating with the
       computer at a different rate than it's communicating over the phone line), you can put a numeric value in
       the <b>BAUD</b> environment variable instead (use <b>setenv</b> <b>BAUD</b> <b>9600</b> for csh or <b>BAUD=9600;</b> <b>export</b> <b>BAUD</b> for sh).

       The <b>SHELL</b> or <b>EXECSHELL</b> environment variable must be set to the full pathname of a shell  executable  that
       accepts  the  -i  (interactive) and -c (run a command) arguments of the Korn Shell; otherwise, <b><a href="file:/bin/sh">/bin/sh</a></b> is
       used.

       The <b>TERM</b> environment variable must be set to the type of terminal you're using.  If the size  (number  of
       lines/columns)  of your terminal is different from what is reported in the TERMCAP or TERMINFO entry, you
       can set this with the <b>stty</b> <b>rows</b> <b>nn</b> <b>cols</b> <b>nn</b> command, or by  setting  the  <b>LINES</b>  and  <b>COLUMNS</b>  environment
       variables.

       The <b>xterm-xfree86</b> terminal allows automatic entering and leaving of the bracketed paste mode.

       The  <b>JOETERM</b>  environment  variable  may  be  set  to  override the regular <b>TERM</b> environment variable for
       specifying your terminal type.

       JOE uses two character maps for its operation: the terminal  I/O  character  map,  which  determines  how
       characters  are  sent  to  the  terminal  and  whether the %a/%A message specifiers use UCS, and the file
       encoding, which can be specified per file using the <b>-encoding</b> option and changed with the <b>^T</b>  <b>E</b>  command,
       and  which  defaults  to  the  terminal I/O character map, which, in turn, is determined from the current
       locale, if the system supports such, otherwise the <b>LC_ALL</b>, <b>LC_CTYPE</b> and <b>LANG</b>  environment  variables  (if
       they  contain  a  period,  only  the part after it and before an optional "at sign" is used); on cygwin32
       before 1.7.2, the codepage is used instead if the POSIX  locale  environment  variables  are  empty;  the
       environment variable <b>JOECHARMAP</b> can be used to manually force one overriding all methods described above,
       and can be used together with <b>-encoding</b> to specify a different default file character map.

       JOE  normally  expects  that flow control between the computer and your terminal to use ^S/^Q handshaking
       (I.E., if the computer is sending characters too fast for your terminal, your terminal sends ^S  to  stop
       the  output  and  ^Q  to restart it).  If the flow control uses out-of-band or hardware handshaking or if
       your terminal is fast enough to always keep up with the computer output and you wish to map ^S/^Q to edit
       commands, you can set the environment variable <b>NOXON</b> to have JOE attempt to turn off  ^S/^Q  handshaking.
       If  the  connection  between  the computer and your terminal uses no handshaking and your terminal is not
       fast enough to keep up with the output of the computer, you can set the environment variable <b>DOPADDING</b> to
       have <b>JOE</b> slow down the output  by  interspersing  PAD  characters  between  the  terminal  screen  update
       sequences.

</pre><h4><b>FILENAMES</b></h4><pre>
       Wherever  JOE  expects  you  to  enter  a file name, whether on the command line or in prompts within the
       editor, you may also type:

       <b>!command</b>
              Read or write data to or from a shell command.  For example, use <b>joe</b> <b>'!ls'</b> to get a copy  of  your
              directory  listing  to edit or from within the editor use <b>^K</b> <b>D</b> <b>!mail</b> <b><a href="mailto:jhallen@world.std.com">jhallen@world.std.com</a></b> to send
              the file being edited to me.

       <b>&gt;&gt;filename</b>
              Use this to have JOE append the edited text to the end of the file "filename."

       <b>filename,START,SIZE</b>
              Use this to access a fixed section of a file or device.  <b>START</b> and <b>SIZE</b> may be entered in  decimal
              (ex.:  123)  octal (ex.: 0777) or hexadecimal (ex.: 0xFF).  For example, use <b>joe</b> <b>/dev/fd0,508,2</b> to
              edit bytes 508 and 509 of the first floppy drive in Linux.

       <b>-</b>      Use this to get input from the standard input or to write output  to  the  standard  output.   For
              example,  you  can  put  joe  in  a pipe of commands: <b>quota</b> <b>-v</b> <b>|</b> <b>joe</b> <b>-</b> <b>|</b> <b>mail</b> <b>root</b>, if you want to
              complain about your low quota.

</pre><h4><b>THE</b> <b>JOERC</b> <b>FILE</b></h4><pre>
       <b>^T</b> options, the help screens and the key-sequence to editor command bindings are  all  defined  in  JOE's
       initialisation  file.   If  you  make  a copy of this file (which normally resides in <b>/etc/jupp/joerc</b>) to
       <b>$HOME/.joerc</b>, you can customise these settings to your liking.  The syntax  of  the  initialisation  file
       should be fairly obvious, and there are further instruction in it.

</pre><h4><b>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       JOE   was  written  by  Joseph  H.  Allen.   If  you  have  bug  reports  or  questions,  eMail  them  to
       <a href="mailto:jhallen@world.std.com">jhallen@world.std.com</a>.  Larry Foard (<a href="mailto:entropy@world.std.com">entropy@world.std.com</a>)  and  Gary  Gray  (<a href="mailto:ggray@world.std.com">ggray@world.std.com</a>)  also
       helped  with  the  creation  of  JOE.   Thorsten "mirabilos" Glaser (<a href="mailto:tg@mirbsd.org">tg@mirbsd.org</a>) created JUPP, and the
       16-bit MS-DOS version of JUPP 2.8 was compiled by Andreas Totlis (<a href="mailto:atotlis@t-online.de">atotlis@t-online.de</a>).
