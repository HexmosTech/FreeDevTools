</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       mg — emacs-like text editor

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>mg</b> [<b>-nR</b>] [<b>-b</b> <u>file</u>] [<b>-f</b> <u>mode</u>] [<b>-u</b> <u>file</u>] [+<u>number</u>] [<u>file</u> <u>...</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>mg</b> is intended to be a small, fast, and portable editor for people who can't (or don't want to) run emacs
       for  one  reason  or  another,  or  are  not familiar with the <u><a href="../man1/vi.1.html">vi</a></u>(1) editor.  It is compatible with emacs
       because there shouldn't be any reason to learn more editor types than emacs or <u><a href="../man1/vi.1.html">vi</a></u>(1).

       The options are as follows:

       +<u>number</u>
               Go to the line specified by number (do not insert a space between the ‘+’ sign and  the  number).
               If a negative number is specified, the line number counts backwards from the end of the file i.e.
               +-1 will be the last line of the file, +-2 will be second last, and so on.

       <b>-b</b> <u>file</u>
               Turn on batch mode and execute the <b>mg</b> commands found in the specified <u>file</u> and then terminate.

       <b>-f</b> <u>mode</u>
               Run  the  <u>mode</u>  command for all buffers created from arguments on the command line, including the
               scratch buffer and all files.

       <b>-n</b>      Turn off backup file generation.

       <b>-R</b>      Files specified on the command line will be opened read-only.

       <b>-u</b> <u>file</u>
               Use <u>file</u> as the startup file, instead of the default <u><a href="file:~/.mg">~/.mg</a></u>.

</pre><h4><b>WINDOWS</b> <b>AND</b> <b>BUFFERS</b></h4><pre>
       When a file is loaded into <b>mg</b>, it is stored in a <u>buffer</u>.  This buffer may be displayed on the  screen  in
       more  than  one window.  At present, windows may only be split horizontally, so each window is delineated
       by a modeline at the bottom.  If changes are made to a buffer, it will be reflected in all open windows.

       If a file is changed outside <b>mg</b> and its buffer is about to be changed, <b>mg</b> prompts if the change should go
       ahead (y), not go ahead (n) or if the buffer should be reverted (r) to the latest file on disk.

       If a buffer name begins and ends with an asterisk, the buffer is considered throwaway; i.e. the user will
       not be prompted to save changes when the buffer is killed.

</pre><h4><b>POINT</b> <b>AND</b> <b>MARK</b></h4><pre>
       The current cursor location in <b>mg</b> is called the <u>point</u> (or <u>dot</u>).  It  is  possible  to  define  a  window-
       specific  region  of  text by setting a second location, called the <u>mark</u>.  The <u>region</u> is the text between
       point and mark inclusive.  Deleting the character at the mark position leaves the mark at  the  point  of
       deletion.

       Note: The point and mark are window-specific in <b>mg</b>, not buffer-specific, as in other emacs flavours.

</pre><h4><b>BACKUP</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       Backup  files  have  a  ‘~’  character  appended  to the file name and are created in the current working
       directory by default.  Whether to create backup files or not can be toggled  with  the  <b>make-backup-files</b>
       command.   The backup file location can either be in the current working directory, or all backups can be
       moved to a <u><a href="file:~/.mg.d">~/.mg.d</a></u> directory  where  files  retain  their  path  name  to  retain  uniqueness.   Use  the
       <b>backup-to-home-directory</b>  command  to alternate between these two locations.  Further, if any application
       creates backup files in <u><a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a></u>, these can be left with the <b>leave-tmpdir-backups</b> command.

</pre><h4><b>TAGS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>mg</b> supports tag  files  created  by  <u><a href="../man1/ctags.1.html">ctags</a></u>(1),  allowing  the  user  to  quickly  locate  various  object
       definitions.  Note though that emacs uses etags, not ctags.

</pre><h4><b>CSCOPE</b></h4><pre>
       <b>mg</b>  supports  navigating  source  code  using  cscope.   However,  <b>mg</b>  requires cscope and cscope-indexer
       executables to be present in PATH for it to work.

</pre><h4><b>DEFAULT</b> <b>KEY</b> <b>BINDINGS</b></h4><pre>
       Normal editing commands are very similar to GNU Emacs.  In the following examples, C-x  means  Control-x,
       and  M-x  means  Meta-x,  where  the Meta key may be either a special key on the keyboard or the ALT key;
       otherwise ESC followed by the key X works as well.

       For a complete description of <b>mg</b> commands, see “MG COMMANDS”.  To see the active keybindings at any time,
       type “M-x describe-bindings”.

</pre><h4><b>MG</b> <b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       Commands are invoked by “M-x”, or by binding  to  a  key.   Many  commands  take  an  optional  numerical
       parameter,  <u>n</u>.   This  parameter  is  set  either by M-&lt;n&gt; (where <u>n</u> is the numerical argument) before the
       command, or by one or more invocations of the universal argument, usually bound to C-u.  When invoked  in
       this manner, the value of the numeric parameter to be passed is displayed in the minibuffer before the M-
       x.   One  common  use  of  the parameter is in mode toggles (e.g. make-backup-files).  If no parameter is
       supplied, the mode is toggled to its alternate state.  If a positive parameter is supplied, the  mode  is
       forced to on.  Otherwise, it is forced to off.

       <b>apropos</b>
              Help Apropos.  Prompt the user for a string, open the *help* buffer, and list all <b>mg</b> commands that
              contain that string.

       <b>audible-bell</b>
              Toggle the audible system bell.

       <b>auto-execute</b>
              Register  an  auto-execute  hook;  that  is, specify a filename pattern (conforming to the shell's
              filename globbing rules) and an associated function to execute when a file matching the  specified
              pattern is read into a buffer.

       <b>auto-fill-mode</b>
              Toggle auto-fill mode (sometimes called mail-mode) in the current buffer, where text inserted past
              the   fill   column   is  automatically  wrapped  to  a  new  line.   Can  be  set  globally  with
              <b>set-default-mode</b>.

       <b>auto-indent-mode</b>
              Toggle indent mode in the current buffer, where indentation is preserved after a newline.  Can  be
              set globally with <b>set-default-mode</b>.

       <b>back-to-indentation</b>
              Move the dot to the first non-whitespace character on the current line.

       <b>backup-to-home-directory</b>
              Save   backup   copies   to   a   <u><a href="file:~/.mg.d">~/.mg.d</a></u>   directory  instead  of  working  directory.   Requires
              <b>make-backup-files</b> to be on.

       <b>backward-char</b>
              Move cursor backwards one character.

       <b>backward-kill-word</b>
              Kill text backwards by <u>n</u> words.

       <b>backward-paragraph</b>
              Move cursor backwards <u>n</u>  paragraphs.   Paragraphs  are  delimited  by  &lt;NL&gt;&lt;NL&gt;  or  &lt;NL&gt;&lt;TAB&gt;  or
              &lt;NL&gt;&lt;SPACE&gt;.

       <b>backward-word</b>
              Move cursor backwards by the specified number of words.

       <b>beginning-of-buffer</b>
              Move  cursor  to  the  top  of the buffer.  If set, keep mark's position, otherwise set at current
              position.  A numeric argument <u>n</u> will move n/10th of the way from the top.

       <b>beginning-of-line</b>
              Move cursor to the beginning of the line.

       <b>blink-and-insert</b>
              Self-insert a character, then search backwards and blink its matching delimiter.   For  delimiters
              other  than parenthesis, brackets, and braces, the character itself is used as its own match.  Can
              be used in the startup file with the <b>global-set-key</b> command.

       <b>bsmap-mode</b>
              Toggle bsmap mode, where DEL and C-h are swapped.

       <b>c-mode</b>
              Toggle a KNF-compliant mode for editing C program files.

       <b>call-last-kbd-macro</b>
              Invoke the keyboard macro.

       <b>capitalize-word</b>
              Capitalize <u>n</u> words; i.e. convert the first character of the word to  upper  case,  and  subsequent
              letters to lower case.

       <b>cd</b>     Change the global working directory.  See also <b>global-wd-mode</b>.

       <b>column-number-mode</b>
              Toggle whether the column number is displayed in the modeline.

       <b>copy-region-as-kill</b>
              Copy  all  of the characters in the region to the kill buffer, clearing the mark afterwards.  This
              is a bit like a <b>kill-region</b> followed by a <b>yank</b>.

       <b>count-matches</b>
              Count the number of lines matching the supplied regular expression.

       <b>count-non-matches</b>
              Count the number of lines not matching the supplied regular expression.

       <b>cscope-find-this-symbol</b>
              List the matches for the given symbol.

       <b>cscope-find-global-definition</b>
              List global definitions for the given literal.

       <b>cscope-find-called-functions</b>
              List functions called from the given function.

       <b>cscope-find-functions-calling-this-function</b>
              List functions calling the given function.

       <b>cscope-find-this-text-string</b>
              List locations matching the given text string.

       <b>cscope-find-egrep-pattern</b>
              List locations matching the given extended regular expression pattern.

       <b>cscope-find-this-file</b>
              List filenames matching the given filename.

       <b>cscope-find-files-including-file</b>
              List files that #include the given filename.

       <b>cscope-next-symbol</b>
              Navigate to the next match.

       <b>cscope-prev-symbol</b>
              Navigate to the previous match.

       <b>cscope-next-file</b>
              Navigate to the next file.

       <b>cscope-prev-file</b>
              Navigate to the previous file.

       <b>cscope-create-list-of-files-to-index</b>
              Create cscope's List and Index in the given directory.

       <b>define-key</b>
              Prompts the user for a named keymap (mode), a key, and an <b>mg</b> command, then creates a keybinding in
              the appropriate map.

       <b>delete-backward-char</b>
              Delete backwards <u>n</u> characters.  Like <b>delete-char</b>, this actually does a kill if presented  with  an
              argument.

       <b>delete-blank-lines</b>
              Delete  blank  lines  around dot.  If dot is sitting on a blank line, this command deletes all the
              blank lines above and below the current line.  Otherwise, it deletes all of the blank lines  after
              the current line.

       <b>delete-char</b>
              Delete <u>n</u> characters forward.  If any argument is present, it kills rather than deletes, saving the
              result in the kill buffer.

       <b>delete-horizontal-space</b>
              Delete any whitespace around the dot.

       <b>delete-leading-space</b>
              Delete leading whitespace on the current line.

       <b>delete-trailing-space</b>

       <b>isearch-forward</b>
              Use incremental searching, initially in the  forward  direction.   isearch  ignores  any  explicit
              arguments.   If  invoked during macro definition or evaluation, the non-incremental <b>search-forward</b>

              Kill line.  If called without an argument, it kills from dot to the end of the line, unless it  is
              at the end of the line, when it kills the newline.  If called with an argument of 0, it kills from
              the  start of the line to dot.  If called with a positive argument, it kills from dot forward over
              that number of newlines.  If called with a negative argument it kills any text before dot  on  the
              current line, then it kills back abs(n) lines.

       <b>overwrite-mode</b>
              Toggle overwrite mode in the current buffer, where typing overwrites  existing  characters  rather
              than inserting them.  Can be set globally with <b>set-default-mode</b>.

       <b>prefix-region</b>
              Inserts  a  prefix  string  before  each line of a region.  The prefix string is settable by using

       <b>re-search-forward</b>
              Search  forward  using  a regular expression.  Get a search string from the user and search for it
              starting at dot.  If found, move dot to just after the matched characters.  display does  all  the

       <b>write-file</b>
              Ask for a file name and write the contents of  the  current  buffer  to  that  file.   Update  the
              remembered file name and clear the buffer changed flag.

       <b>yank</b>   Yank  text  from  <b>kill-buffer</b>.   Unlike emacs, the <b>mg</b> kill buffer consists only of the most recent
              kill.  It is not a ring.

       <b>zap-to-char</b>
              Ask for a character and delete text from the current cursor position until the  next  instance  of
              that character, including it.

       <b>zap-up-to-char</b>
              Like <b>zap-to-char</b> but doesn't delete the target character.

</pre><h4><b>MG</b> <b>DIRED</b> <b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       The following are a list of the commands specific to dired mode:

       <b>dired-create-directory</b>
               Create a directory.

       <b>dired-do-copy</b>
               Copy the file listed on the current line of the dired buffer.

       <b>dired-do-flagged-delete</b>
               Delete the files that have been flagged for deletion.

       <b>dired-do-rename</b>
               Rename the file listed on the current line of the dired buffer.

       <b>dired-find-alternate-file</b>
               Replace the current dired buffer with an alternate one as specified by the position of the cursor
               in the dired buffer.

       <b>dired-find-file</b>
               Open  the file on the current line of the dired buffer.  If the cursor is on a directory, it will
               be opened in dired mode.

       <b>dired-flag-file-deletion</b>
               Flag the file listed on the current line for deletion.   This  is  indicated  in  the  buffer  by
               putting   a   D  at  the  left  margin.   No  files  are  actually  deleted  until  the  function
               <b>dired-do-flagged-delete</b> is executed.

       <b>dired-find-file-other-window</b>
               Open the file on the current line of the dired buffer in a different window.

       <b>dired-goto-file</b>
               Move the cursor to a file name in the dired buffer.

       <b>dired-next-line</b>
               Move the cursor to the next line.

       <b>dired-other-window</b>
               This function works just like dired, except that it puts the dired buffer in another window.

       <b>dired-previous-line</b>
               Move the cursor to the previous line.

       <b>dired-revert</b>
               Refresh the dired buffer while retaining any flags.

       <b>dired-scroll-down</b>
               Scroll down the dired buffer.

       <b>dired-scroll-up</b>
               Scroll up the dired buffer.

       <b>dired-shell-command</b>
               Pipe the file under the current cursor position through a shell command.

       <b>dired-unmark</b>
               Remove the deletion flag for the file on the current line.

       <b>dired-unmark-backward</b>
               Remove the deletion flag from the file listed on the previous line of the dired buffer, then move
               up to that line.

       <b>dired-up-directory</b>
               Open a dired buffer in the parent directory.

       <b>quit-window</b>
               Close the current dired buffer.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       There are two configuration files, <u>.mg</u> and <u>.mg-TERM</u>.  Here, TERM represents  the  name  of  the  terminal
       type; e.g. if the terminal type is set to “vt100”, <b>mg</b> will use <u>.mg-vt100</u> as a startup file.  The terminal
       type startup file is used first.

       The startup file format is a list of commands, one per line, as used for interactive evaluation.  Strings
       that  are normally entered by the user at any subsequent prompts may be specified after the command name;
       e.g.:

             global-set-key ")" self-insert-command
             global-set-key "\^x\^f" find-file
             global-set-key "\e[Z" backward-char
             set-default-mode fill
             set-fill-column 72
             auto-execute *.c c-mode

       Comments can be added to the startup files by placing ‘;’ or ‘#’ as the first character of a line.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <u><a href="file:~/.mg">~/.mg</a></u>                       normal startup file
       <u><a href="file:~/.mg-TERM">~/.mg-TERM</a></u>                  terminal-specific startup file
       <u><a href="file:~/.mg.d">~/.mg.d</a></u>                     alternative backup file location
       <u>/usr/share/doc/mg/tutorial</u>  concise tutorial

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       <u><a href="../man1/ctags.1.html">ctags</a></u>(1), <u><a href="../man1/vi.1.html">vi</a></u>(1)

</pre><h4><b>CAVEATS</b></h4><pre>
       Since it is written completely in C, there is currently no language in which extensions can  be  written;
       however, keys can be rebound and certain parameters can be changed in startup files.

       In  order  to  use  8-bit  characters (such as German umlauts), the Meta key needs to be disabled via the
       <b>meta-key-mode</b> command.

       Multi-byte character sets, such as UTF-8, are not supported.
