</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       E3 - A mini text editor

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>e3[ws|em|pi|vi|ne]</b> [filename]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>e3</u>  is  a  complete  mini  application written fully in assembler, with a code size less than 10000 byte.
       There is a status &amp; input line, where you can enter filenames, blocknames, find-texts and  line  numbers.
       The  editor commands are similarly the families of <u>Wordstar</u>-like or <u>Emacs</u> or <u>Pico</u> or <u>vi</u> or <u>Nedit</u> editors.
       For online help press ESC:h in vi mode, else Alt-H.  This man page describes Wordstar key bindings only.

</pre><h4><b>UNDO</b> <b>OPERATION</b> <b>DETAILS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>e3</u> has an UNDO mode starting in v2.2. There is no predefined UNDO level count. You can expect to UNDO  at
       least  <u>one</u>  last  insert-, delete-, overwrite- or sed_pipe-operation, but in most cases there are <u>lots</u> of
       UNDO stages available. e3 has a fixed size undo buffer and will use  an  external  helper  file  if  some
       deleted data is bigger sized than the undo buffer.  This buffer is organized as a ring, overwriting older
       UNDO  information  if necessary. So one never can say exactly how many UNDO operations are possible.  For
       using the UNDO press one of:

       <b>^U</b>     in Wordstar mode

       <b>^QU</b>    in Pico mode

       <b>^_</b>     in Emacs mode

       <b>u</b>      in vi command mode

       <b>^U</b>     in Nedit mode

</pre><h4><b>BUILT</b> <b>IN</b> <b>CALCULATOR</b></h4><pre>
       <u>e3</u> has an arithmetic calculator built in for some simple arithmetic calculations inside your text.  Place
       cursor at begin of the task i.e. something like:  -3.002*-(2--3)= and press one of:

       <b>^KN</b>    in Wordstar mode

       <b>^QC</b>    in Pico mode

       <b>^X^N</b>   in Emacs mode

       <b>#</b>      in vi command mode

       <b>^K</b>     in Nedit mode

       This   will   insert   the   result   into   text.   Use  the  values  between  -999999999999.999999  ...
       999999999999.999999 with up to 6 decimal digits and the  operators  +-*/   and  parenthesis  (  ).   Also
       available are p for constant PI and r for accessing the result of last calculation

</pre><h4><b>RUNTIME</b> <b>MODE</b> <b>SWITCHING</b></h4><pre>
       You can switch to other editor mode by pressing one of:

       <b>^KM</b>    in Wordstar mode

       <b>^QM</b>    in Pico mode

       <b>altX</b>   in Emacs mode

       <b>&lt;ESC&gt;;</b> in vi command mode

       <b>^E</b>     in Nedit mode

       e3  will  set a prompt <u>SET</u> <u>MODE</u> . Now enter one of e3ws, e3em, e3pi, e3vi, e3ne for setting <u>Wordstar</u>-like
       or <u>Emacs</u> or <u>Pico</u> or <u>vi</u> or <u>Nedit</u> style.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       e3 accepts a filename for text editing. Switch the editor mode depending of the binary name, one of <u>e3ws</u>,
       <u>e3em</u>, <u>e3pi</u>, <u>e3vi</u>, <u>e3ne</u>

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>e3</b>     is an assembled executable for Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, BeOS(tm),  QNX(tm).   <u>e3ws</u>,  <u>e3em</u>,
              <u>e3pi</u>, <u>e3vi</u>, <u>e3ne</u> are symbolic links to e3.

       <b>e3.exe</b> is an assembled executable for 32 bit Win versions like 95/98/ME/etc.

       <b>e3c</b>    is  a 'C' compiled executable for some other platforms, optional built, supporting WS key bindings
              only.

       <b>e3arm</b>  is a new experimental (alpha code quality) assembled executable  for  ARM  Linux,  optional  built
              (identical e3, but no arithmetics and no UNDO available).

       <b>e3.hlp</b> help text file (for e3c only)

       <b>e3.res</b> error message text file (for e3c only)

       <b>e3-16</b>  <u>e3-16</u>,  <u>e3-16.com</u>,  <u>e3-16e.exe</u>  are  special  bonus  files  for  16  bit  operating  systems  ELKS
