</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       lpe - Lightweight programmer's editor

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>lpe</b> [ --help | --version ]
       <b>lpe</b> [--mode &lt;mode&gt;] [ -- ] <u>file</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Lpe</u>  is  a  small,  fast,  visual  text  editor  designed  to  make  editing  code  easier.   It provides
       simultaneously all the features that may be required in a good code editor while preserving a  light  and
       intuitive feel that makes it nice to use.

   <b>Options</b>
       <b>--help</b> Prints a brief description of program usage and terminates.  This must be the first option to <b>lpe</b>,
              and all other options are ignored.

       <b>--version</b>
              Prints  a message indication the program version and terminates.  This must be the first option to
              <b>lpe</b>, and all other options are ignored.

       <b>--mode</b> Sets the buffer mode to the one specified, instead of scanning for  a  suitable  mode  from  those
              available.

       <b>--</b>     Treat  future  arguments  as  file  names,  not options.  This allows lpe to be used to edit files
              starting with the - character.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       What follows are the control key functions for lpe.  Arrow keys, home, end,  backspace,  delete  and  the
       like  all  do  as they would be expected to do.  Some control keys are bound to the same function as some
       standard movement keys, such as home or page down.  This is because the more intuitive keys  may  not  be
       available on some systems.

              <b>&lt;interrupt&gt;</b>  refers  to your terminal's interrupt key.  This is often Ctrl-C, but can vary between
              terminals.  Ctrl-Z, on the other hand, is fixed, regardless  of  the  normal  stop  key  for  your
              terminal.

</pre><h4><b>MODULES</b></h4><pre>
       Although  <b>lpe</b>  is  meant to be small, it has the capability of performing more advanced actions through a
       feature known as buffer modes.  Buffer modes allow <b>lpe</b> to act differently according  to  the  programming
       language  in the current buffer.  They are implemented through language modules, which are loaded at run-
       time by lpe to handle buffers that they apply to.

       All language modules should be placed in a module repository directory.  These directories are set by the
       <b>LPE_MODULE_PATH</b> environment variable, which should be a colon-separated list of directories  (similar  to
       PATH).   If  this variable is not set, then lpe scans for modules in the following locations, and in this
       order:

       <b>$HOME/.lpe</b> <b>/usr/local/lib/lpe</b> <b>/usr/lib/lpe</b> <b>/etc/lpe</b>

       Note that the /etc/lpe directory is old, obsolete, and non-standard.  It  should  not  be  used  to  hold
       modules.  As modules are binary files and are specific to the architecture that uses them, they should be
       properly placed in the lib directories listed above.

       These  locations  are  scanned  at  run-time,  and any regular files in them are interpreted as potential
       language modules for use by lpe.  Subdirectories will not be scanned.  A  buffer  will  be  assigned  the
       first  mode  found  that  applies  to  that  file,  so for example a mode in a user's home directory will
       override one in the system-wide lib directory.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Lots of 'em -- see the BUGS file in the distribution for a partial list.  I am not planning  on  updating
       this man page often enough to keep up with the bug list, so I won't even try to list bugs here.
