</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       <b>jEdit</b> - Programmer's Text Editor written in Java

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>jedit</b> [ <b>options</b> ] [ <b>files</b> ]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual page briefly documents <b>jEdit</b>'s command-line parameters.  Complete documentation can be found
       by invoking the Help-&gt;jEdit Help menu item within <b>jEdit</b> or by invoking jedit -usage.

       <b>jEdit</b>  is a cross-platform text editor written in Java. It has an extensive  feature  set  that  includes
       syntax  highlighting,  auto  indent,  folding,  word  wrap,  abbreviation expansion, multiple clipboards,
       powerful search and replace and much more.

       Furthermore, <b>jEdit</b> is extremely  customizable,  and  extensible,  using  either  macros  written  in  the
       BeanShell  scripting  language,  or plugins written in Java. With plugins, you can create a very powerful
       development environment for HTML, XML, C/C++, Python, Perl, Ruby, Lisp, Scheme, and many others.

       <b>jEdit</b> Requires A Java Runtime Environment Version 1.8 or later.

       <b>jEdit</b> is released under the GNU General Public License, which can be found in the online help.

</pre><h4><b>GENERAL</b> <b>COMMAND</b> <b>LINE</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       When opening files from the command line, a line number or  marker  to  position  the  caret  on  can  be
       specified like so:

       $ jedit MyApplet.java +line:10

       $ jedit thesis.tex +marker:c

       Command-line  switches  begin with a "-". Some take a parameter. A file whose name begins with "-" can be
       opened like so:

       $ jedit -- -myfile

</pre><h4><b>MISCELLANEOUS</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-log=level</b>
              Set the minimum log level to an integer between 1 and  9.  Default  is  7.   Has  no  effect  when
              connecting to another instance via the edit server.

       <b>-usage</b> Show  a  brief command line usage message without starting <b>jEdit</b>. This message is also shown if an
              invalid switch was specified.

       <b>-version</b>
              Show the version number without starting <b>jEdit</b>.

       <b>--</b>     Specifies the end of command-line processing. Further parameters are treated as file  names,  even

       <b>-background</b>
              Run <b>jEdit</b> in background mode. In background mode, the edit  server  will  continue  listening  for

              used in combination with the -background switch.  You can use this switch to "pre-load" <b>jEdit</b> when
              you log in to your computer, for example. Has no effect when connecting to  another  instance  via
              the edit server.
