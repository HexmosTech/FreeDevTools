</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       the - <b>T</b>he <b>H</b>essling <b>E</b>ditor.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>the</b>  [-h?nmrsbk]  [-p <u>profile</u>] [-a <u>profile_arg</u>] [-l <u>line_num</u>] [-c <u>col_num</u>] [-w <u>width</u>] [-u <u>display_length</u>]
       [-k<u>[fmt]]</u> [[dir] [file [...]]]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>THE</b> is a text editor that uses both command line commands and key bindings to operate. It is intended  to
       be similar to the VM/CMS System Product Editor, XEDIT and to KEDIT from Mansfield Software.

       THE was originally written to be used by people already familiar with the above editors. For this reason,
       the documentation provides limited information on using THE, and concentrates more on reference material,
       such as command syntax and configuration.

   <b>OPTIONS</b>
       <u>-h,</u> <u>-?</u> Print a usage message on standard error and exit successfully.

       <u>-n</u>     Run  THE  without  any  profile.  Normally  THE  tries  to find a profile file and execute this on
              startup. This switch suppresses that search and execute and runs THE in  its  default  mode.  This
              switch  is  useful  for  determining  if  a  bug  in  THE  occurs  only with certain user-specific
              customizations.

       <u>-m</u>     On ports of THE that support colour, this switch forces THE into monochrome mode. More  a  testing
              feature than a user feature.

       <u>-r</u>     This switch enables <b>THE</b> to be run in read-only mode. In this mode commands that alter the contents
              of a file are invalid.

       <u>-s</u>     On  Unix  platforms, this switch enables the writing of a core file if THE crashes.  Normally, THE
              traps any internal errors and exits gracefully.  This switch is a testing feature  rather  than  a
              user feature.

       <u>-b</u>     When  you  want  to use THE as a non-interactive tool for manipulating the contents of one or more
              files, this switch will disable any display of file contents  and  disable  keyboard  interaction.
              Normally used in conjunction with a specific profile; see -p option.

       <u>-q</u>     Run  quietly in batch mode. This will suppress the introductory informative message displayed when
              errors are encountered running in batch.

       <u>-k[fmt]</u>
              Allows 'soft label keys'. This allows the display of one (or two)  lines  at  the  bottom  of  the
              screen  with 'buttons' intended to be used to represent function keys. These 'soft label keys' can
              be manipulated with the &lt;SET SLK&gt; command.  The 'fmt' optional extra argument is  a  single  digit
              representing the format of the display of the 'buttons'.

               1 - displays 8 'buttons' in a 4-4 layout
               2 - displays 8 'buttons' in a 3-2-3 layout
               3 - displays 12 'buttons' in a 4-4-4 layout
               4 - displays 12 'buttons' in a 4-4-4 layout with an index line
               5 - displays 10 'buttons' in a 5-5 layout

              Not  all  platforms support all 5 format options.  On those ports of THE that are mouse-aware, the
              mouse can be pressed on a 'button', and the command assigned the the corresponding function key is
              executed.

       <u>-l</u> <u>line_num</u>
              This switch specifies the line number to make current when THE starts.

       <u>-c</u> <u>column_num</u>
              This switch specifies the column number to make current when THE starts.

       <u>-p</u> <u>profile</u>
              Specifies the THE profile to run instead of the default profile.

       <u>-a</u> <u>profile_arg</u>
              Specifies the arguments that are passed to the profile specified with the -p switch.

       <u>-w</u> <u>width</u>
              Specifies the maximum line width for a line in the current edit session. Can  be  overridden  with
              the &lt;SET WIDTH&gt; command.

       <u>-u</u> <u>display_length</u>
              THE  can  run as a binary editor. Specifying this switch tells THE to read in the file and display
              it in 'lines' that are ´display_length´ long.  All end-of-line characters in the file are  ignored
              and are treated as other characters in the file.

       <u>-X</u> <u>X11_switches</u>
              With  the  X11 port of THE, standard X11 switches can be specified with this switch to dynamically
              configure the way THE displays or behaves.  You can also specify XCurses-specific switches here as
              well.  For more information on the XCurses switches available, consult the PDCurses documentation.

       <u>-1</u>     Tells THE to run in 'Single Instance Mode'. The first time THE is  run  with  the  -1  switch,  it
              starts  as  normal.  Subsequent executions of THE with the -1 command-line switch will not start a
              new instance of THE, rather it will  edit  the  file(s)  specified  on  the  command-line  in  the
              currently  running instance of THE.  This feature is currently only available with the X11 port of
              the using XCurses 2.5 and greater.  If the first instance of THE with the -1  switch  crashes  for
              any  reason,  subsequent attempts to run THE with the -1 switch will hang.  To fix this remove the
              file (really a FIFO); $HOME/.thefifo and then run THE with the -1 switch again.

       <u>[dir</u> <u>[file</u> <u>[...]]]</u>
              File(s) and/or directory to be edited.
