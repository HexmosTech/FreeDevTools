</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       vis — a highly efficient text editor

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>vis</b> [<b>-v</b>] [<b>+</b><u>command</u>] [<b>--</b>] [<u>files</u> <u>...</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>vis</b>  is  a  highly  efficient  screen-oriented text editor combining the strengths of both <b><a href="../manm/vi.m.html">vi</a>(m)</b> and <b>sam</b>.
       This manual page is intended for users already familiar with <b>vi</b>/<b>sam</b>.  Anyone else should almost certainly
       read a good tutorial on either editor before this manual page.  The following options are available:

       <b>-v</b>      Print version information and exit.

       <b>+</b><u>command</u>
               Execute <u>command</u> after loading file.

       <b>--</b>      Denotes the end of the options.  Arguments after this will be handled as a file name.

       The special file <b>-</b> instructs <b>vis</b> to read from standard input in which case <b>:wq</b>  will  write  to  standard
       output, thereby enabling usage as an interactive filter.

       If  standard  input  is  redirected  and  all input is consumed, <b>vis</b> will open <u>/dev/tty</u> to gather further
       commands.  Failure to do so results in program termination.

   <b>Selections</b>
       <b>vis</b> uses selections as core editing primitives.  A selection is a  non-empty,  directed  range  with  two
       endpoints  called  <u>cursor</u> and <u>anchor</u>.  A selection can be anchored in which case the anchor remains fixed
       while only the position of the cursor is  adjusted.   For  non-anchored  selections  both  endpoints  are
       updated.   A  singleton  selection  covers  one  character on which both cursor and anchor reside.  There
       always exists a primary selection which remains visible (i.e. changes to its  position  will  adjust  the
       viewport).

   <b>Modes</b>
       <b>vis</b> employs the same <u>modal</u> editing approach as <b>vi</b>.  It supports a ‘normal’, ‘operator pending’, ‘insert’,
       ‘replace’  and  ‘visual’  (in both line and character wise variants) mode.  The visual block and ex modes
       are deliberately not implemented, instead <b>vis</b> has  built  in  support  for  multiple  selections  and  an
       <u>interactive</u> variant of the structural regular expression based command language of <b>sam</b>.

       In normal mode all selections are non-anchored and reduced to a single character.

   <b>Undo/Redo</b>
       <b>vis</b>  uses  an  undo  tree to keep track of text revisions.  The <b>u</b> (undo) and ⟨<b>C-r</b>⟩ (redo) commands can be
       used to traverse the tree along the main branch.  <b>g+</b> and <b>g-</b> traverse the history in chronological  order.
       The <b>:earlier</b> and <b>:later</b> commands provide means to restore the text to an arbitrary state.

   <b>Marks</b>
       A  mark  associates  a symbolic name to a set of selections.  A stored selection becomes invalid when its
       delimiting boundaries change in the underlying buffer.  If said changes are later undone the mark becomes
       valid again.  <b>m</b> sets a mark, <b>M</b> restores it.  For example, <b>'</b><u>a</u><b>m</b> sets the mark <u>a</u> while <b>'</b><u>a</u><b>M</b> restores it.  Use
       of <b>m</b> or <b>M</b> without specifying a mark uses the default mark.

       Available marks are:

       <b>''</b>      default mark

       <b>'^</b>      active selections when leaving visual mode

       <b>'a</b>–<b>'z</b>   general purpose marks

       No marks across files are supported.  Marks are not preserved over editing sessions.

   <b>Jump</b> <b>list</b>
       A per window, fixed sized file local jump list exists which stores marks (i.e. set of selections).

       <b>g&lt;</b>      jump backward

       <b>g&gt;</b>      jump forward

       <b>gs</b>      save currently active selections

   <b>Registers</b>
       Registers are named lists of text.  Uninitialized register slots default to the empty string.   Available
       registers are:

       <b>""</b>      default register

       <b>"a</b>–<b>"z</b>   general purpose registers

       <b>"A</b>–<b>"Z</b>   append to corresponding general purpose register

       <b>"*</b>, <b>"+</b>  system clipboard integration via shell script <u><a href="../man1/vis-clipboard.1.html">vis-clipboard</a></u>(1)

       <b>"0</b>      yank register, most recently yanked range

       <b>"1</b>–<b>"9</b>

       <b>"&amp;</b>      sub expression matches of most recent <b>x</b> or <b>y</b> command

       <b>"/</b>      search register, most recently used search pattern

       <b>":</b>      command register, most recently executed command

       <b>"_</b>      black hole (<u>/dev/null</u>) register, ignore content is always empty

       <b>"#</b>      selection number (readonly)

       If no explicit register is specified the default register is used.

   <b>Macros</b>
       The  general  purpose  registers  <b>"a</b>–<b>"z</b>  can  be used to record macros.  Use one of <b>"A</b>–<b>"Z</b> to append to an
       existing macro.  <b>q</b> starts a recording, <b>@</b> plays it back.  <b>@@</b> refers to the most recently  recorded  macro.
       <b>@:</b>  repeats  the  last  <b>:</b>-command. <b>@/</b> is equivalent to <b>n</b> in normal mode.  These operations always use the
       first register slot.

   <b>Encoding,</b> <b>Tab</b> <b>and</b> <b>Newline</b> <b>handling</b>
       <b>vis</b> always assumes the input file to be UTF-8 encoded with <b>\n</b> line endings.  If you wish  to  edit  files
       with  legacy  encodings or non-Unix line endings, use <u><a href="../man1/iconv.1.html">iconv</a></u>(1) and <u><a href="../man1/dos2unix.1.html">dos2unix</a></u>(1) to convert them as needed.
       ⟨<b>Tab</b>⟩ can optionally be expanded to a configurable number of spaces (see “SET OPTIONS”).

   <b>Mouse</b> <b>support</b>
       The mouse is currently not used at all.

</pre><h4><b>SAM</b> <b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>vis</b> supports an  interactive  variant  of  the  structural  regular  expression  based  command  language
       introduced by <u><a href="../man1/sam.1.html">sam</a></u>(1).

   <b>Regular</b> <b>expressions</b>
       <b>vis</b>  currently defers regular expression matching to the underlying C library.  It uses what POSIX refers
       to as “Extended Regular Expressions” as described in <u><a href="../man7/regex.7.html">regex</a></u>(7).  The anchors <b>^</b> and <b>$</b> match the beginning /
       end of the range they are applied to.  Additionally <b>\n</b> and <b>\t</b> may be used to refer to newlines and  tabs,
       respectively.   The <b>.</b> atom matches any character except newline.  The empty regular expression stands for
       the last complete expression encountered.

   <b>Addresses</b>
       An address identifies a substring (or range) in a file.  In the following “character <u>n</u>”  means  the  null
       string  after the <u>n</u>-th character in the file, with 1 the first character in the file.  “Line <u>n</u>” means the
       <u>n</u>-th match, starting at the beginning of the file, of the regular expression “<b>.*\n?</b>”.

       All windows always have at least one current substring which is the default  address.   In  sam  this  is
       referred to as <b>dot</b>.  In <b>vis</b> multiple “dots” (or selections) can exist at the same time.

   <b>Simple</b> <b>addresses</b>
       <b>#</b><u>n</u>      The empty string after character <u>n</u>; <b>#0</b> is the beginning of the file.

       <u>n</u>       Line <u>n</u>.

       <b>/</b><u>regexp</u><b>/</b>

       <b>?</b><u>regexp</u><b>?</b>
               The  substring  that  matches  the  regular  expression,  found by looking towards the end (<b>/</b>) or
               beginning (<b>?</b>) of the file.  The search does not wrap around when hitting the end (start)  of  the
               file.

       <b>0</b>       The  string  before  the  first  full line.  This is not necessarily the null string; see <b>+</b> and <b>-</b>
               below.

       <b>$</b>       The null string at the end of the file.

       <b>.</b>       Dot, the current range.

       <b>'</b><u>m</u>      The mark <u>m</u> in the file.

   <b>Compound</b> <b>addresses</b>
       In the following, <u>a1</u> and <u>a2</u> are addresses.

       <u>a1</u><b>+</b><u>a2</u>   The address <u>a2</u> evaluated starting at the end of <u>a1</u>.

       <u>a1</u><b>-</b><u>a2</u>   The address <u>a2</u> evaluated looking the reverse direction starting at the beginning of <u>a1</u>.

       <u>a1</u><b>,</b><u>a2</u>   The substring from the beginning of <u>a1</u> to the end of <u>a2</u>.  If <u>a1</u> is missing, <b>0</b> is substituted.  If
               <u>a2</u> is missing, <b>$</b> is substituted.

       <u>a1</u><b>;</b><u>a2</u>   Like <u>a1</u><b>,</b><u>a2</u> but with <u>a2</u> evaluated at the end of, and range set to, <u>a1</u>.

       The operators <b>+</b> and <b>-</b> are high precedence, while <b>,</b> and <b>;</b> are low precedence.

       In both <b>+</b> and <b>-</b> forms, if <u>a2</u> is a line or character address with a missing number, the number defaults to
       1.  If <u>a1</u> is missing, <b>.</b> is substituted.  If both <u>a1</u> and <u>a2</u> are present  and  distinguishable,  <b>+</b>  may  be
       elided.   <u>a2</u> may be a regular expression; if it is delimited by <b>?</b> characters, the effect of the <b>+</b> or <b>-</b> is
       reversed.  The <b>%</b> sign is an alias for <b>,</b> and hence <b>0,$</b>.   It  is  an  error  for  a  compound  address  to
       represent a malformed substring.

   <b>Commands</b>
       In  the  following, text demarcated by slashes represents text delimited by any printable ASCII character
       except alphanumerics.  Any number of trailing delimiters may  be  elided,  with  multiple  elisions  then
       representing  null  strings,  but  the  first  delimiter  must always be present.  In any delimited text,
       newline may not appear literally; <b>\n</b> and <b>\t</b> may be typed for newline and tab; <b>\/</b>  quotes  the  delimiter,
       here  <b>/</b>.   An  ampersand  <b>&amp;</b>  and <b>\</b><u>n</u>, where <u>n</u> is a digit (1–9) are replaced by the corresponding register.
       Backslash is otherwise interpreted literally.

       Most commands may be prefixed with an address to indicate their range of operation.  If a  command  takes
       an address and none is supplied, a default address is used.  In normal mode this equates to the character
       the selection is currently over.  If only one selection exists <b>x</b> and <b>y</b> default to the whole file <b>0,$</b>.  In
       normal  mode  the write commands <b>w</b> and <b>wq</b> always apply to the whole file.  Commands are executed once for
       every selection.  In visual mode the commands are applied to every selection as if an implicit <b>x</b> command,
       matching the existing selections, was present.

       In the description, “range” is used to represent whatever address is supplied.

       Many commands create new selections as a side effect when issued from a visual mode.  If so, it is always
       to the “result” of the change: the new text for an insertion,  the  empty  string  for  a  deletion,  the
       command output of a filter etc.  If after a successful command execution no selections remain, the editor
       will  switch to normal mode, otherwise it remains in visual mode.  This allows <u>interactive</u> refinements of
       ranges.

   <b>Text</b> <b>commands</b>
       <b>a</b>[<u>count</u>]/<u>text</u><b>/</b>
               Insert the <u>text</u> <u>count</u> times into the file after the range.

               May also be written as

                      a
                      lines
                      of
                      text
                      .

       <b>c</b> or <b>i</b>  Same as <b>a</b>, but <b>c</b> replaces the text, while <b>i</b> inserts <u>before</u> the range.

       <b>d</b>       Delete the text in range.

   <b>Display</b> <b>commands</b>
       <b>p</b>       Create a new selection for the range.

   <b>I/O</b> <b>commands</b>
       <b>e</b>[<b>!</b>] [<u>file</u> <u>name</u>]
               Replace the file by the contents of the named external file.  If no file name  is  given,  reload
               file from disk.

       <b>r</b> <u>file</u> <u>name</u>
               Replace the text in the range by the contents of the named external file.

       <b>w</b>[<b>!</b>] [<u>file</u> <u>name</u>]
               Write the range (default <b>0,$</b>) to the named external file.

       <b>wq</b>[<b>!</b>] [<u>file</u> <u>name</u>]
               Same as <b>w</b>, but close file afterwards.

       If  the file name argument is absent from any of these, the current file name is used.  <b>e</b> always sets the
       file name, <b>w</b> will do so if the file has no name.  Forcing the <b>e</b> command with <b>!</b> will discard  any  unsaved
       changes.  Forcing <b>w</b> will overwrite the file on disk even if it has been externally modified since loading
       it.   Write  commands with a non-default addresses and no file name are destructive and need always to be
       forced.

       <b>&lt;</b> <u>shell</u> <u>command</u>
               Replace the range by the standard output of the shell command.

       <b>&gt;</b> <u>shell</u> <u>command</u>
               Sends the range to the standard input of the shell command.

       <b>|</b> <u>shell</u> <u>command</u>
               Send the range to the standard input, and replace  it  by  the  standard  output,  of  the  shell
               command.

       <b>!</b> <u>shell</u> <u>command</u>
               Run interactive shell command, redirect keyboard input to it.

       <b>cd</b> <u>directory</u>
               Change working directory.  If no directory is specified, $HOME is used.

       In  any  of  <b>&lt;</b>,  <b>&gt;</b>,  <b>|</b>,  or  <b>!</b>,  if the shell command is omitted, the last shell command (of any type) is
       substituted.  Unless the file being edited is unnamed, all these  external  commands  can  refer  to  its
       absolute path and file name through the vis_filepath and vis_filename environment variables.

   <b>Loops</b> <b>and</b> <b>conditionals</b>
       <b>x/</b><u>regexp</u><b>/</b> [<u>command</u>]
               For  each  match  of  the  regular expression in the range, run the command with range set to the
               match.  If the regular expression and its slashes are omitted, <u><a href="file:/.">/.</a>*\n/</u> is  assumed.   Null  string
               matches potentially occur before every character of the range and at the end of the range.

               The <b>"1</b>–<b>"9</b> and <b>"&amp;</b> registers are updated with the (sub) expression matches of the pattern.

       <b>y/</b><u>regexp</u><b>/</b> [<u>command</u>]
               Like  <b>x</b>,  but  run the command for each substring that lies before, between, or after the matches
               that would be generated by <b>x</b>.  There is no default behavior.  Null substrings  potentially  occur
               before every character in the range.

       <b>X/</b><u>regexp</u><b>/</b> <u>command</u>
               For  each file whose file name matches the regular expression, make that the current file and run
               the command.  If the expression is omitted, the command is run in every file.

       <b>Y/</b><u>regexp</u><b>/</b> <u>command</u>
               Same as <b>X</b>, but for files that do  not  match  the  regular  expression,  and  the  expression  is
               required.

       <b>g</b>[<u>count</u>][<u>/regexp/</u>] <u>command</u>

       <b>v</b>[<u>count</u>][<u>/regexp/</u>] <u>command</u>
               If  the  <u>count</u> range contains (<b>g</b>) or does not contain (<b>v</b>) a match for the expression, run command
               on the range.

               The <u>count</u> specifier has the following format, where <u>n</u> and <u>m</u> are integers denoting the ranges.

               <u>n</u><b>,</b><u>m</u>     The closed interval from <u>n</u> to <u>m</u>.  If <u>n</u> is missing, <b>1</b> is substituted.  If <u>m</u> is missing,  <b>∞</b>
                       is substituted.  Negative values are interpreted relative to the last range.

               <b>%</b><u>n</u>      Matches every <u>n</u>-th range.

       These  may  be nested arbitrarily deeply.  An empty command in an <b>x</b> or <b>y</b> defaults to <b>p</b>.  <b>X</b>, <b>Y</b>, <b>g</b> and <b>v</b> do
       not have defaults.

   <b>Grouping</b> <b>and</b> <b>multiple</b> <b>changes</b>
       Commands may be grouped by enclosing them in curly braces.  Semantically, the opening  brace  is  like  a
       command:  it  takes  an  (optional)  address and runs each sub-command on the range.  Commands within the
       braces are executed sequentially, but changes made by one command are not visible to other commands.

       When a command makes a number of changes to a file, as in <b>x/</b><u>re</u><b>/</b> <b>c/</b><u>text</u><b>/</b>, the addresses of all changes are
       computed based on the initial state.  If the  changes  are  non-overlapping,  they  are  applied  in  the
       specified order.  Conflicting changes are rejected.

       Braces may be nested arbitrarily.

</pre><h4><b>VI(M)</b> <b>KEY</b> <b>BINDINGS</b></h4><pre>
       In  the  following  sections angle brackets are used to denote special keys.  The prefixes <b>C-</b>, <b>S-</b>, and <b>M-</b>
       are used to refer to the ⟨Ctrl⟩, ⟨Shift⟩ and ⟨Alt⟩ modifiers, respectively.

       All active key bindings can be listed at runtime using the <b>:help</b> command.

   <b>Operators</b>
       Operators perform a certain operation on a text range indicated by either a motion, a text object  or  an
       existing selection.

       When  used  in  normal mode, the following operators wait for a motion, putting vis into operator pending
       mode.
       <b>c</b>           change, delete range and enter insert mode
       <b>d</b>           delete, cut range to register
       <b>&lt;</b>           shift-left, decrease indent
       <b>&gt;</b>           shift-right, increase indent
       <b>y</b>           yank, copy range to register

       When used in normal mode, the following actions take effect immediately.
       <b>=</b>           format, filter range through <u><a href="../man1/fmt.1.html">fmt</a></u>(1)
       <b>gu</b>          make lowercase
       <b>gU</b>          make uppercase
       <b>g~</b>          swap case
       <b>J</b>           join lines, insert spaces in between
       <b>gJ</b>          join lines remove any delimiting white spaces
       <b>p</b>           put register content after cursor
       <b>P</b>           put register content before cursor

   <b>Motions</b>
       Motions take an initial file position and transform it to a destination file position, thereby defining a
       range.

       <b>0</b>           start of line
       <b>b</b>           previous start of a word

   <b>Text</b> <b>objects</b>
       Text objects take an initial file position and transform  it  to  a  range  where  the  former  does  not
       necessarily  have to be contained in the latter.  All of the following text objects are implemented in an
       inner variant (prefixed with <b>i</b>) where the surrounding white space or delimiting characters are  not  part
       of the resulting range and a normal variant (prefixed with <b>a</b>) where they are.

       <b>w</b>           word
       <b>W</b>           WORD
       <b>s</b>           sentence
       <b>p</b>           paragraph
       <b>[,</b> <b>],</b> <b>(,</b> <b>),</b> <b>{,</b> <b>},</b> <b>&lt;,</b> <b>&gt;,</b> <b>",</b> <b>',</b> <b>`</b>
                   block enclosed by these symbols

       Further available text objects include:
       <b>gn</b>          matches the last used search term in forward direction
       <b>gN</b>          matches the last used search term in backward direction
       <b>al</b>          current line
       <b>il</b>          current line without leading and trailing white spaces

   <b>Multiple</b> <b>Selections</b>
       <b>vis</b>  supports  multiple  selections  with  immediate  visual  feedback.   There always exists one primary
       selection located within the current view port.  Additional selections can be created as needed.  If more
       than one selection exists, the primary one is styled differently.

       To manipulate selections use in normal mode:

       ⟨<b>C-k</b>⟩       create count new selections on the lines above
       ⟨<b>C-M-k</b>⟩     create count new selections on the lines above the first selection
       ⟨<b>C-j</b>⟩       create count new selections on the lines below
       ⟨<b>C-M-j</b>⟩     create count new selections on the lines below the last selection
       ⟨<b>C-p</b>⟩       remove primary selection
       ⟨<b>C-n</b>⟩       select word the selection is currently over, switch to visual mode
       ⟨<b>C-u</b>⟩       make the count previous selection primary
       ⟨<b>C-d</b>⟩       make the count next selection primary
       ⟨<b>C-c</b>⟩       remove the count selection column
       ⟨<b>C-l</b>⟩       remove all but the count selection column
       ⟨<b>Tab</b>⟩       try to align all selections on the same column
       ⟨<b>Escape</b>⟩    dispose all but the primary selection

       The visual modes were enhanced to recognize:

       <b>I</b>           create a selection at the start of every selected line
       <b>A</b>           create a selection at the end of every selected line
       ⟨<b>Tab</b>⟩       left align selections by inserting spaces
       ⟨<b>S-Tab</b>⟩     right align selections by inserting spaces
       ⟨<b>C-a</b>⟩       create new selections everywhere matching current word or selection
       ⟨<b>C-n</b>⟩       create new selection and select next word matching current selection
       ⟨<b>C-x</b>⟩       clear (skip) current selection, but select next matching word
       ⟨<b>C-p</b>⟩       remove primary selection
       ⟨<b>C-u</b>⟩ ⟨<b>C-k</b>⟩
                   make the count previous selection primary
       ⟨<b>C-d</b>⟩ ⟨<b>C-j</b>⟩
                   make the count next selection primary
       ⟨<b>C-c</b>⟩       remove the count selection column
       ⟨<b>C-l</b>⟩       remove all but the count selection column
       <b>+</b>           rotate selections rightwards count times
       <b>-</b>           rotate selections leftwards count times
       <b>_</b>           trim selections, remove leading and trailing white space
       <b>o</b>           flip selection direction, swap cursor and anchor
       ⟨<b>Escape</b>⟩    clear all selections, switch to normal mode

       In insert and replace mode:

       ⟨<b>S-Tab</b>⟩     align all selections by inserting spaces

       Selections can be manipulated using set operations.  The first operand is the currently active selections
       while the second can be specified as a mark.  For example, <b>'</b><u>a</u><b>|</b> produces the union of the mark <u>a</u>  and  the
       current  selection.   Use  of  set operations without specifying a mark use the default mark as the first
       operand.

       <b>|</b>           set union
       <b>&amp;</b>           set intersection
       <b>\</b>           set minus
       <b>~</b>           set complement

</pre><h4><b>VI(M)</b> <b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       Any unique prefix can be used to abbreviate a command.

   <b>File</b> <b>and</b> <b>Window</b> <b>management</b>
       A file must be opened in at least one window.  If the last window displaying a certain file is closed all
       unsaved changes are discarded.  Windows are equally sized and can be displayed in rows (horizontally)  or
       in  columns  (vertically).   The ⟨<b>C-w</b>⟩ <b>h</b>, ⟨<b>C-w</b>⟩ <b>j</b>, ⟨<b>C-w</b>⟩ <b>k</b> and ⟨<b>C-w</b>⟩ <b>l</b> key mappings can be used to switch
       between windows.

       <b>:new</b>    open an empty window, arranged as a new row (horizontally)

       <b>:vnew</b>   open an empty window, arranged as a new column (vertically)

       <b>:open</b>[<b>!</b>] [<u>file</u> <u>name</u>]
               open a new window, displaying file name if given

       <b>:split</b> [<u>file</u> <u>name</u>]
               split window into rows (horizontally)

       <b>:vsplit</b> [<u>file</u> <u>name</u>]
               split window into columns (vertically)

       <b>:q</b>[<b>!</b>] [<u>exit</u> <u>code</u>]
               close currently focused window

       <b>:qall</b>[<b>!</b>] [<u>exit</u> <u>code</u>]
               close all windows, terminate editor with exit code (defaults to 0)

       Commands taking a file name will invoke the <u><a href="../man1/vis-open.1.html">vis-open</a></u>(1) utility, if given a file pattern or directory.

   <b>Runtime</b> <b>key</b> <b>mappings</b>
       <b>vis</b> supports global as well as window local run time key mappings which are always evaluated recursively.

       <b>:map</b>[<b>!</b>] <u>mode</u> <u>lhs</u> <u>rhs</u>
               add a global key mapping

       <b>:map-window</b>[<b>!</b>] <u>mode</u> <u>lhs</u> <u>rhs</u>
               add a window local key mapping

       <b>:unmap</b> <u>mode</u> <u>lhs</u>
               remove a global key mapping

       <b>:unmap-window</b> <u>mode</u> <u>lhs</u>
               remove a window local key mapping

       In  the  above  <u>mode</u>  refers  to  one  of  ‘normal’,  ‘insert’,  ‘replace’,  ‘visual’,  ‘visual-line’  or
       ‘operator-pending’;  <u>lhs</u>  refers to the key to map and <u>rhs</u> is a key action or alias.  An existing mapping
       may be overridden by forcing the map command by specifying <b>!</b>.

       Because key mappings are always recursive, doing something like:

             <b>:map!</b> <b>normal</b> <b>j</b> <b>2j</b>

       will not work because it would enter an endless loop.  Instead, <b>vis</b> uses pseudo keys referred to  as  key
       actions  which  can  be  used  to  invoke a set of available editor functions.  <b>:help</b> lists all currently
       active key bindings as well as all available symbolic keys.

   <b>Keyboard</b> <b>Layout</b> <b>Specific</b> <b>Mappings</b>
       In order to facilitate usage of non-latin keyboard layouts, <b>vis</b> allows one to map locale specific keys to
       their latin equivalents by means of the

             <b>:langmap</b> <u>locale-keys</u> <u>latin-keys</u>

       command.  As an example, the following maps the movement keys in Russian layout:

             <b>:langmap</b> <b>ролд</b> <b>hjkl</b>

       If the key sequences have not the same length, the remainder of the longer sequence will be discarded.

       The defined mappings take effect in all non-input modes, i.e. everywhere except  in  insert  and  replace
       mode.

   <b>Undo/Redo</b>
       <b>:earlier</b> [<u>count</u>]
               revert to older text state

       <b>:later</b> [<u>count</u>]
               revert to newer text state

       If count is suffixed by either of <b>d</b> (days), <b>h</b> (hours), <b>m</b> (minutes) or <b>s</b> (seconds) it is interpreted as an
       offset from the current system time and the closest available text state is restored.

</pre><h4><b>SET</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       There  are a small number of options that may be set (or unset) to change the editor's behavior using the
       <b>:set</b> command.  This section describes the options, their abbreviations and their default values.  Boolean
       options can be toggled by appending <b>!</b> to the option name.

       In each entry below, the first part of the tag line is the full name  of  the  option,  followed  by  any
       equivalent abbreviations.  The part in square brackets is the default value of the option.

       <b>shell</b> [“<u><a href="file:/bin/sh">/bin/sh</a></u>”]
               User  shell  to  use  for external commands, overrides SHELL and shell field of password database

       <b>theme</b> [“default-16” or “default-256”]
               Color  theme  to  use,  name  without file extension.  Loaded from a <u>themes/</u> sub directory of the
               paths listed in the “FILES” section.

       <b>syntax</b> [<b>auto</b>]
               Syntax highlighting lexer to use, name without file extension.

               falling  back  to  the  latter.   The  rename  method  fails  for symlinks, hardlinks, in case of
               insufficient directory permissions or when either the file owner, group,  POSIX  ACL  or  SELinux
               labels can not be restored.

       <b>loadmethod</b> [<u>auto</u>]
               How  existing  files  should  be loaded, <u>read</u> which copies the file content to an independent in-
               memory buffer, <u>mmap</u> which memory maps the file from disk and  uses  OS  capabilities  as  caching
               layer  or  <u>auto</u>  which tries the former for files smaller than 8Mb and the latter for lager ones.
               WARNING: modifying a memory mapped file in-place will cause data loss.

       <b>layout</b> [“v” or “h”]
               Whether to use vertical or horizontal layout.

</pre><h4><b>COMMAND</b> <b>and</b> <b>SEARCH</b> <b>PROMPT</b></h4><pre>
       The command and search prompt as opened by <b>:</b>, <b>/</b>, or <b>?</b> is implemented as  a  single  line  height  window,
       displaying  a  regular  file  whose  editing  starts in insert mode.  ⟨<b>Escape</b>⟩ switches to normal mode, a
       second ⟨<b>Escape</b>⟩ cancels the prompt.  ⟨<b>Up</b>⟩ enlarges the window, giving  access  to  the  command  history.
       ⟨<b>C-v</b>⟩  ⟨<b>Enter</b>⟩  inserts a literal new line thus enabling multiline commands.  ⟨<b>Enter</b>⟩ executes the visual
       selection if present, or else everything in  the  region  spawned  by  the  selection  position  and  the
       delimiting prompt symbols at the start of adjacent lines.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>vis</b>  uses  Lua  for  configuration  and  scripting  purposes.   During startup <u>visrc.lua</u> (see the “FILES”
       section) is sourced which can be used to set personal configuration options.  As an example the following
       will enable the display of line numbers:

             <b>vis:command('set</b> <b>number')</b>

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       VIS_PATH
               The default path to use to load Lua support files.

       HOME    The home directory used for the <b>cd</b> command if no argument is given.

       TERM    The terminal type to use to initialize the curses interface, defaults to <b>xterm</b> if unset.

       SHELL   The command shell to use for I/O related commands like <b>!</b>, <b>&gt;</b>, <b>&lt;</b> and <b>|</b>.

       XDG_CONFIG_HOME
               The configuration directory to use, defaults to <u>$HOME/.config</u> if unset.

</pre><h4><b>ASYNCHRONOUS</b> <b>EVENTS</b></h4><pre>
       SIGSTOP
               Suspend editor.

       SIGCONT
               Resume editor.

       SIGBUS  An <u><a href="../man2/mmap.2.html">mmap</a></u>(2) ed file got truncated, unsaved file contents will be lost.

       SIGHUP

       SIGTERM
               Restore initial terminal state.  Unsaved file contents will be lost.

       SIGINT  When an interrupt occurs while an external command is being run it is terminated.

       SIGWINCH
               The screen is resized.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       Upon startup <b>vis</b> will source the first <u>visrc.lua</u> configuration file  found  from  these  locations.   All
       actively used paths can be listed at runtime using the <b>:help</b> command.

       <b>•</b>   <u>$VIS_PATH</u>

       <b>•</b>   The location of the <b>vis</b> binary (on systems where <u><a href="file:/proc/self/exe">/proc/self/exe</a></u> is available).

       <b>•</b>   <u>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/vis</u> where XDG_CONFIG_HOME refers to <u>$HOME/.config</u> if unset.

       <b>•</b>   <u>/etc/vis</u> for a system-wide configuration provided by administrator.

       <b>•</b>   <u>/usr/local/share/vis</u> or <u>/usr/share/vis</u> depending on the build configuration.

           When creating a new <u>visrc.lua</u> be sure to copy the structure from here.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>vis</b> utility exits 0 on success, and &gt;0 if an error occurs.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Use <b>vis</b> as an interactive filter.

             <b>$</b> <b>{</b> <b>echo</b> <b>Pick</b> <b>your</b> <b>number;</b> <b>seq</b> <b>1</b> <b>10;</b> <b>}</b> | <b>vis</b> <b>-</b> <b>&gt;</b> <b>choice</b>
