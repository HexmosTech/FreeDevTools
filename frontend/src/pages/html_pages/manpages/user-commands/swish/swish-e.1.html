</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           swish [-e] [-i dir file ... ] [-S system] [-c file] [-f file] [-l] [-v (num)]
           swish -w word1 word2 ... [-f file1 file2 ...] \
                 [-P phrase_delimiter] [-p prop1 ...] [-s sortprop1 [asc⎪desc] ...] \
                 [-m num] [-t str] [-d delim] [-H (num)] [-x output_format]
           swish -k (char⎪*) [-f file1 file2 ...]
           swish -M index1 index2 ... outputfile
           swish -N /path/to/compare/file

       See the the <u><a href="../man1/SWISH-RUN.1.html">SWISH-RUN</a></u>(1) man page for details on run-time options.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Swish-e  is  Simple  Web  Indexing  System  for  Humans  - Enhanced. Swish-e can quickly and easily index
       directories of files or remote web sites and search the generated indexes.

       Swish-e is extremely fast in both indexing and searching, highly  configurable,  and  can  be  seamlessly
       integrated  with existing web sites to maintain a consistent design. Swish-e can index web pages, but can
       just as easily index text files, mailing list archives, or data stored in a relational database.

       Swish is designed to index small to medium sized collection  of  documents,  Although  a  few  users  are
       indexing  over  a  million  documents,  typical  usage is more often in the tens of thousands. Currently,
       Swish-e only indexes eight bit character encodings.

</pre><h4><b>DOCUMENTATION</b></h4><pre>
       Documentation is  provided  as  HTML  pages  installed  in  $prefix/share/doc/swish-e  where  $prefix  is
       <a href="file:/usr/local">/usr/local</a> if building from source, or <a href="file:/usr">/usr</a> if installed as part of a package from your OS vendor.  Under
       Windows $prefix is selected at installation time.
