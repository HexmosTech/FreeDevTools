</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       gong - evaluate process performance

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>gong</b> [<b>-f</b>] [<b>-a</b>] process-id

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Gong</u> is used to evaluate the performance of a process that is in execution.

       The <u>process-id</u> is the process number of the process whose performance is to be evaluated.  The evaluation
       is performed by a set of three ``panelist'' routines, each of which analyzes one aspect (time, space, and
       tonality)  of the performance of the process.  If any of these routines is not amused by the performance,
       the process being analyzed is sent the <u><a href="../man2/gong.2.html">gong</a></u>(2) signal.  In addition,  the  process-id  of  the  evaluated
       process  is  written  on the standard gong, for possible future corrective action.  (It is suggested that
       the standard gong be an audible alarm for proper effect.)  It is expected that after being <u><a href="../man2/gong.2.html">gong</a></u>(2)ed, the
       process will promptly commit suicide.

       The <b>-f</b> keyletter argument indicates that <u>gong</u> is to invoke <u><a href="../man1/flog.1.html">flog</a></u>(1) with the <u>unmerciful</u>  argument  if  the
       process  does  not  respond  to <u><a href="../man2/gong.2.html">gong</a></u>(2)ing.  In the absence of this argument, the process is continuously
       <u><a href="../man2/gong.2.html">gong</a></u>(2)ed, which may lead to the process becoming a deaf zombie.

       The <b>-a</b> keyletter argument indicates that if all three of the panelist routines  <u><a href="../man2/gong.2.html">gong</a></u>(2)  a  process,  the
       process should be unmercifully <u><a href="../man1/flog.1.html">flog</a></u>(1)ged whether or not the <b>-f</b> keyletter is supplied.

       <u>Results</u>, vol. 263, issue 19, pp. 253-307.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       If the named process does not exist, it is possible that <u>gong</u> will attempt an evaluation of itself, which
       may lead to a condition known as compounded double ringing (see <u><a href="../man1/echo.1.html">echo</a></u>(1)).  Therefore, it  is  recommended
       that <u>gong</u> be used with extreme care.
