       udebug - Reports Ubik process status for a database server process

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>udebug</b> <b>-server</b> &lt;<u>server</u> <u>machine</u>&gt; [<b>-port</b> &lt;<u>IP</u> <u>port</u>&gt;]
           [<b>-long</b>] [<b>-help</b>]

       <b>udebug</b> <b>-s</b> &lt;<u>server</u> <u>machine</u>&gt; [<b>-p</b> &lt;<u>IP</u> <u>port</u>&gt;] [<b>-l</b>] [<b>-h</b>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>udebug</b> command displays the status of the lightweight Ubik process for the database server process
       identified by the <b>-port</b> argument that is running on the database server machine named by the <b>-server</b>
       argument. The output identifies the machines where peer database server processes are running, which of
       them is the synchronization site (Ubik coordinator), and the status of the connections between them.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-server</b> &lt;<u>server</u> <u>machine</u>&gt;
           Names  the  database  server  machine  that  is  running  the  process  for  which  to display status
           information. Provide the machine's IP address in dotted decimal format, its fully qualified host name
           (for example, <b>fs1.example.com</b>), or the shortest abbreviated form of its host name that  distinguishes
           it  from  other machines. Successful use of an abbreviated form depends on the availability of a name
           resolution service (such as the Domain Name Service or a local host table) at the time the command is
           issued.

       <b>-port</b> &lt;<u>IP</u> <u>port</u>&gt;
           Identifies the database server process for which to display status information, either by its process
           name or port number. Provide one of the following values:

           •   <b>buserver</b> or 7021 for the Backup Server

           •   <b>kaserver</b> or 7004 for the Authentication Server

           •   <b>ptserver</b> or 7002 for the Protection Server

           •   <b>vlserver</b> or 7003 for the Volume Location Server

       <b>-long</b>
           Reports additional information about each peer of the machine named  by  the  <b>-server</b>  argument.  The
           information appears by default if that machine is the synchronization site.

       <b>-help</b>
           Prints the online help for this command. All other valid options are ignored.

</pre><h4><b>OUTPUT</b></h4><pre>
       Several  of  the  messages  in  the output provide basic status information about the Ubik process on the
       machine specified by the <b>-server</b> argument, and the remaining messages are  useful  mostly  for  debugging
       purposes.

       To check basic Ubik status, issue the command for each database server machine in turn. In the output for
       each, one of the following messages appears in the top third of the output.

          I am sync site . . . (&lt;#_sites&gt; servers)

          I am not sync site

       For the synchronization site, the following message indicates that all sites have the same version of the
       database, which implies that Ubik is functioning correctly. See the following for a description of values
       other than "1f".

          Recovery state 1f

       For  correct  Ubik  operation,  the  database server machine clocks must agree on the time. The following
       messages, which are the second and third lines in the output, report the current date and time  according
       to the database server machine's clock and the clock on the machine where the <b>udebug</b> command is issued.

          Host's &lt;IP_addr&gt; time is &lt;dbserver_date/time&gt;
          Local time is &lt;local_date/time&gt; (time differential &lt;skew&gt; secs)

       The  &lt;skew&gt; is the difference between the database server machine clock and the local clock. Its absolute
       value is not vital for Ubik functioning, but a difference of more than a few  seconds  between  the  <u>skew</u>
       values  for  the  database  server  machines  indicates  that  their clocks are not synchronized and Ubik
       performance is possibly hampered.

       Following is a description of all messages in the output. As noted, it is useful mostly for debugging and
       most meaningful to someone who understands Ubik's implementation.

       The output begins with the following messages. The first  message  reports  the  IP  addresses  that  are
       configured  with  the  operating  system  on the machine specified by the <b>-server</b> argument. As previously
       noted, the second and third messages report the current date and time according  to  the  clocks  on  the
       database  server machine and the machine where the <b>udebug</b> command is issued, respectively. All subsequent
       timestamps in the output are expressed in terms of the  local  clock  rather  than  the  database  server
       machine clock.

          Host's addresses are: &lt;list_of_IP_addrs&gt;
          Host's &lt;IP_addr&gt; time is &lt;dbserver_date/time&gt;
          Local time is &lt;local_date/time&gt; (time differential &lt;skew&gt; secs)

       If  the  &lt;skew&gt;  is  more  than  about  10  seconds, the following message appears. As noted, it does not
       necessarily indicate Ubik malfunction: it denotes clock skew between the database server machine and  the
       local machine, rather than among the database server machines.

          ****clock may be bad

       If the udebug command is issued during the coordinator election process and voting has not yet begun, the
       following message appears next.

          Last yes vote not cast yet

       Otherwise, the output continues with the following messages.

          Last yes vote for &lt;sync_IP_addr&gt; was &lt;last_vote&gt; secs ago (sync site);
          Last vote started &lt;vote_start&gt; secs ago (at &lt;date/time&gt;)
          Local db version is &lt;db_version&gt;

       The  first  indicates which peer this Ubik process last voted for as coordinator (it can vote for itself)
       and how long ago it sent the vote.  The second message  indicates  how  long  ago  the  Ubik  coordinator
       requested confirming votes from the secondary sites. Usually, the &lt;last_vote&gt; and &lt;vote_start&gt; values are
       the  same; a difference between them can indicate clock skew or a slow network connection between the two
       database server machines. A small difference is not  harmful.  The  third  message  reports  the  current
       version  number &lt;db_version&gt; of the database maintained by this Ubik process. It has two fields separated
       by a period. The field before the period is based on a timestamp that reflects when  the  database  first
       changed  after  the most recent coordinator election, and the field after the period indicates the number
       of changes since the election.

       The output continues with messages that differ depending on whether the Ubik process is  the  coordinator
       or not.

       •   If there is only one database server machine, it is always the coordinator (synchronization site), as
           indicated by the following message.

              I am sync site forever (1 server)

       •   If there are multiple database sites, and the <b>-server</b> argument names the coordinator (synchronization
           site), the output continues with the following two messages.

              I am sync site until &lt;expiration&gt; secs from now (at &lt;date/time&gt;)
                  (&lt;#_sites&gt; servers)
              Recovery state &lt;flags&gt;

           The  first  message  (which  is  reported  on  one  line)  reports  how  much longer the site remains
           coordinator even if the next attempt to maintain quorum fails, and how many sites  are  participating
           in  the  quorum.  The  <u>flags</u>  field  in the second message is a hexadecimal number that indicates the
           current state of the quorum. A value of "1f" indicates complete database synchronization,  whereas  a
           value  of  "f"  means  that the coordinator has the correct database but cannot contact all secondary
           sites to determine if they also have it. Lesser values are acceptable if the <b>udebug</b> command is issued
           during coordinator election, but they denote a problem if they persist. The individual flags have the
           following meanings:

           0x1 This machine is the coordinator.

           0x2 The coordinator has determined which site has the database with the highest version number.

           0x4 The coordinator has a copy of the database with the highest version number.

           0x8 The database's version number has been updated correctly.

           0x10
               All sites have the database with the highest version number.

           If the udebug command is issued while the coordinator is writing a  change  into  the  database,  the
           following additional message appears.

              I am currently managing write transaction I&lt;identifier&gt;

       •   If the <b>-server</b> argument names a secondary site, the output continues with the following messages.

              I am not sync site
              Lowest host &lt;lowest_IP_addr&gt; was set &lt;low_time&gt; secs ago
              Sync host &lt;sync_IP_addr&gt; was set &lt;sync_time&gt; secs ago

           The  &lt;lowest_IP_addr&gt; is the lowest IP address of any peer from which the Ubik process has received a
           message recently, whereas the &lt;sync_IP_addr&gt; is the IP address of the current  coordinator.  If  they
           differ,  the  machine  with  the lowest IP address is not currently the coordinator. The Ubik process
           continues voting for the current coordinator as long as they remain in contact,  which  provides  for
           maximum stability. However, in the event of another coordinator election, this Ubik process votes for
           the  &lt;lowest_IP_addr&gt;  site  instead (assuming they are in contact), because it has a bias to vote in
           elections for the site with the lowest IP address.

       For both the synchronization and secondary sites, the output continues with the following  messages.  The
       first  message  reports  the  version  number of the database at the synchronization site, which needs to
       match the &lt;db_version&gt; reported by the preceding "Local db version" message. The second message indicates
       how many VLDB records are currently locked for any operation or for writing in particular. The values are
       nonzero if the <b>udebug</b> command is issued while an operation is in progress.

          Sync site's db version is &lt;db_version&gt;
          &lt;locked&gt; locked pages, &lt;writes&gt; of them for write

       The following messages appear next only if there are any read or write locks on database records:

          There are read locks held
          There are write locks held

       Similarly, one or more of the following messages appear  next  only  if  there  are  any  read  or  write
       transactions in progress when the <b>udebug</b> command is issued:

          There is an active write transaction
          There is at least one active read transaction
          Transaction tid is &lt;tid&gt;

       If  the  machine  named  by  the  <b>-server</b>  argument is the coordinator, the next message reports when the
       current coordinator last updated the database.

           Last time a new db version was labelled was:
                   &lt;last_restart&gt; secs ago (at &lt;date/time&gt;)

       If the machine named by the <b>-server</b> argument is the coordinator, the output concludes with an  entry  for
       each secondary site that is participating in the quorum, in the following format.

          Server (&lt;IP_address&gt;): (db &lt;db_version&gt;)
          last vote rcvd &lt;last_vote&gt; secs ago (at &lt;date/time&gt;),
          last beacon sent &lt;last_beacon&gt; secs ago (at &lt;date/time&gt;),
              last vote was { yes | no }
          dbcurrent={ 0 | 1 }, up={ 0 | 1 } beaconSince={ 0 | 1 }

       The  first  line  reports the site's IP address and the version number of the database it is maintaining.
       The &lt;last_vote&gt; field reports how long ago the coordinator received a vote message from the Ubik  process
       at  the  site, and the &lt;last_beacon&gt; field how long ago the coordinator last requested a vote message. If
       the <b>udebug</b> command is issued during the coordinator election process and voting has not  yet  begun,  the
       following messages appear instead.

          Last vote never rcvd
          Last beacon never sent

       On the final line of each entry, the fields have the following meaning:

       •   "dbcurrent" is 1 if the site has the database with the highest version number, 0 if it does not.

       •   "up" is 1 if the Ubik process at the site is functioning correctly, 0 if it is not.

       •   "beaconSince" is 1 if the site has responded to the coordinator's last request for votes, 0 if it has
           not.

       Including the <b>-long</b> flag produces peer entries even when the <b>-server</b> argument names a secondary site, but
       in  that  case  only  the  <u>IP_address</u>  field  is guaranteed to be accurate. For example, the value in the
       &lt;db_version&gt; field is usually 0.0, because secondary sites do not poll their peers for this  information.
       The  values  in the <u>last_vote</u> and <u>last_beacon</u> fields indicate when this site last received or requested a
       vote as coordinator; they generally indicate the time of the last coordinator election.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       This example checks the status of the Ubik process for the Volume Location Server on the machine  "afs1",
       which is the synchronization site.

              dbcurrent=1, up=1 beaconSince=1

       This example checks the status of the Authentication Server on the machine with IP address 192.12.107.34,
       which is a secondary site. The local clock is about 4 minutes behind the database server machine's clock.
