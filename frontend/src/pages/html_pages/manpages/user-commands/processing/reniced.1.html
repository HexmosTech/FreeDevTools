</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       reniced - renice running processes based on regular expressions

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>reniced</b> [<b>-h</b>] [<b>-v</b>] [<b>-o</b> <u>format</u>] [<u>configfile</u>]

</pre><h4><b>OVERVIEW</b></h4><pre>
       reniced takes a list of regular expressions, looks for processes (and threads) matching them and renices
       the processes to given values.  reniced can also change io priorities.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       On start, reniced reads a configuration file.  It consists of nice values and regular expressions.

       It then scans the process table using the <b><a href="../man1/ps.1.html">ps</a></b>(1) command.  Whenever a process name from the CMD column
       matches a regular expression, that process is reniced to the given value.  If a process matches multiple
       regular expressions, all rule matches are executed in order and the last match wins.

       When run as root, reniced will scan all processes ("`ps H -e`").  When run as a user, renice only scans
       the user's processes ("`ps H --user`").

   <b>Switches</b>
       <b>-h</b>   This prints the version number, a short help text and exits without doing anything.

       <b>-n</b>   This  activates  no-op  mode.   No actions are taken but everything that would be done is written to
            stdout.

       <b>-v</b>   This activates verbose mode.  Error messages, some statistics and all renice actions are printed  to
            stdout.

       <b>-o</b> <u>format</u>
            Set  the  <b><a href="../man1/ps.1.html">ps</a></b>(1)  output format to filter on.  The default format is "comm".  See the <b>-o</b> parameter in
            the <b><a href="../man1/ps.1.html">ps</a></b>(1) manpage for details.

       <u>configfile</u>
            This reads the regular expressions from an alternate configfile.

            The default  location  of  the  configfile  is  "/etc/reniced.conf"  if  reniced  is  run  as  root,
            "<a href="file:~/.reniced">~/.reniced</a>" otherwise.

   <b>Configuration</b> <b>file</b> <b>format</b>
       The configuration file is composed of single lines.  Empty lines and lines starting with a <b>#</b> are ignored.

       Every line must consist of a command followed by a whitespace and a Perl regular expression.

       The  regular  expression  is  matched against the <b><a href="../man1/ps.1.html">ps</a></b>(1) output.  For every matched process the command is
       executed.

       A command generally takes the form of a character followed by a number.  Multiple commands can  be  given
       simultaneously with no spaces inbetween.  Sometimes the number is optional.

       <u>Command</u> <u>characters</u>

       <b>n</b>    Sets  the nice value of a process.  Must be followed by a number, usually within the range of -20 to
            19.

            For backwards compatibility a <b>n</b> at the beginning of the command can be  left  out  (if  the  command
            starts with a number it is treated as a nice value).

       <b>r</b>    Sets the io priority to the realtime scheduling class.  The optional number is treated as class data
            (typically 0-7, lower being higher priority).

       <b>b</b>    Sets  the  io priority to the best-effort scheduling class.  The optional number is treated as class
            data (typically 0-7, lower being higher priority).

       <b>i</b>    Sets the io priority to the idle scheduling class.   No  number  needs  to  be  given  as  the  idle
            scheduling class ignores the class data value.

       <b>o</b>    Sets  the  OOM  killer  adjustment  in  "<a href="file:/proc/">/proc/</a>$PID/oom_adj"  to  the  given  number.   (Internally,
            "<a href="file:/proc/">/proc/</a>$PID/oom_score_adj" will be used when available, but for backwards compatibility  this  value
            is still expected the in old "oom_adj" format and will be converted automatically.)

       <u>Examples</u>

       "5 ^bash"
            gives currently running bash shells a nice value of 5

       "b2 ^tar"
            sets currently running tar-processes to io priority best-effort within class 2

       "i torrent"
            sets currently running torrent-like applications to io priority idle

       "n-10r4 seti"
            gives  currently running seti-processes a nice value of -10 and sets them to realtime io priority in
            class 4

</pre><h4><b>MODULES</b> <b>NEEDED</b></h4><pre>
        use BSD::Resource;

       This module can be obtained from &lt;<a href="http://www.cpan.org">http://www.cpan.org</a>&gt;.

</pre><h4><b>PROGRAMS</b> <b>NEEDED</b></h4><pre>
        ps
        ionice

       ionice  is  only  needed  if  you  want   to   change   io   priority.    It   can   be   obtained   from
       &lt;<a href="http://rlove.org/schedutils/">http://rlove.org/schedutils/</a>&gt;.

       You also need a suitable kernel and scheduler, e.g. Linux 2.6 with CFQ.

</pre><h4><b>LIMITATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The purpose of reniced is to renice long running server processes (hence the <b>d</b> for daemon in it's name).

       Selecting  and  renicing  processes it not atomic: There is a small gap between scanning the process list
       and renicing the processes.  If you target short-lived processes with your regular  expressions,  reniced
       might try to act on a process that is already gone.  In the worst case it might renice a new process that
       got the same process id as the already ended process that was matched.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       reniced  can  run  without  the  BSD::Resource module.  In this case, the PRIO_PROCESS is set to 0.  This
       works on Linux 2.6.11 i686 but it could break on other systems.  Installing BSD::Resource  is  the  safer
       way.

       Be careful using realtime priorities, don't starve other tasks.
