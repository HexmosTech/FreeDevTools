</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       <b>resource_monitor</b> - monitors the cpu, memory, io, and disk usage of a tree of processes.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       resource_monitor [options] -- command [command-options]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>resource_monitor</b>  is  a  tool  to  monitor the computational resources used by the process created by the
       command given as an argument, and all its descendants.  The monitor works while a  process  was  running,
       therefore all the information reported should be considered just as an estimate (this is in contrast with
       direct  methods,  such  as ptrace). It works on Linux, and can be used automatically by makeflow and work
       queue applications.

       Additionally, the user can specify maximum resource limits in the form of a file, or a  string  given  at
       the  command line. If one of the resources goes over the limit specified, then the monitor terminates the
       task, and reports which resource went over the respective limits.

       In systems that support it, <b>resource_monitor</b> wraps some libc functions to obtain a better estimate of the
       resources used.

       Currently, the monitor does not support interactive applications. That is, if a  process  issues  a  read
       call  from  standard  input,  and  standard  input  has  not  been  redirected,  then the tree process is
       terminated. This is likely to change in future versions of the tool.

       <b>resource_monitor</b> generates up to three log files: a summary file encoded as json with the maximum  values
       of  resource  used,  a  time-series  that shows the resources used at given time intervals, and a list of
       files that were opened during execution.

       The summary file is a JSON document with the following fields. Unless indicated, all fields are an  array
       with  two  values,  a  number that describes the measurement, and a string describing the units (e.g.,  [
       measurement).

               command:                  the command line given as an argument
               start:                    time at start of execution, since the epoch
               end:                      time at end of execution, since the epoch
               exit_type:                one of "normal", "signal" or "limit" (a string)
               signal:                   number of the signal that terminated the process
                                         Only present if exit_type is signal
               cores:                    maximum number of cores used
               cores_avg:                number of cores as cpu_time/wall_time
               exit_status:              final status of the parent process
               max_concurrent_processes: the maximum number of processes running concurrently
               total_processes:          count of all of the processes created
               wall_time:                duration of execution, end - start
               cpu_time:                 user+system time of the execution
               virtual_memory:           maximum virtual memory across all processes
               memory:                   maximum resident size across all processes
               swap_memory:              maximum swap usage across all processes
               bytes_read:               amount of data read from disk
               bytes_written:            amount of data written to disk
               bytes_received:           amount of data read from network interfaces
               bytes_sent:               amount of data written to network interfaces
               bandwidth:                maximum bandwidth used
               total_files:              total maximum number of files and directories of
                                         all the working directories in the tree
               disk:                     size of all working directories in the tree
               limits_exceeded:          resources over the limit with -l, -L options (JSON object)
               peak_times:               seconds from start when a maximum occured (JSON object)
               snapshots:                List of intermediate measurements, identified by
                                         snapshot_name (JSON object)

       The time-series log has a row per time sample. For each row, the columns have the following meaning  (all
       columns are integers):

               wall_clock                the sample time, since the epoch, in microseconds

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       •   CCTOOLS_RESOURCE_MONITOR_HELPER Location of the desired helper library to wrap  libc  calls.  If  not
           provided, a version of the helper library is packed with the resource_monitor executable.)

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       •
            0 The command exit status was 0, and the monitor process ran without errors.

       •
            1 The command exit status was non-zero, and the monitor process ran without errors.

       •
            2 The command was terminated because it ran out of resources  (see options -l, -L).

       •
            3 The command did not run succesfully because the monitor process had an error.

           To obtain the exit status of the original command, see the generated file with extension .summary.

</pre><h4><b>SNAPSHOTS</b></h4><pre>
       The resource_monitor  can be directed to take snapshots of the resources used according to the files cre‐
       ated by the processes monitored. The typical use of monitoring snapshots is to set a watch on a log file,
       and  generate a snapshot when a line in the log matches a pattern. To activate the snapshot facility, use
       the command line argument --snapshot-events=file, in which file is a JSON-encoded document with the  fol‐
       lowing format:

                   {
                       "FILENAME": {
                           "from-start":boolean,
                           "from-start-if-truncated":boolean,
                           "delete-if-found":boolean,
                           "events": [
                               {
                                   "label":"EVENT_NAME",
                                   "on-create":boolean,
                                   "on-truncate":boolean,
                                   "on-pattern":"REGEXP",
                                   "count":integer
                               },
                               {
                                   "label":"EVENT_NAME",
                                   ...
                               }
                           ]
                       },
                       "FILENAME": {
                           ...
                   }

       All fields but <b>label</b> are optional.

                   .IP • 4
        FILENAME:                  Name of a file to watch.
                   .IP • 4
        from-start:boolean          If  FILENAME exits when the monitor starts running, process from line 1. De‐
       fault: false, as monitored processes may be appending to already existing files.
                   .IP • 4
        from-start-if-truncated    If FILENAME is truncated, process from line 1. Default: true, to account  for
       log rotations.
                   .IP • 4
        delete-if-found            Delete FILENAME when found. Default: false

                   .IP • 4
        events:

                   .IP • 4
        label        Name that identifies the snapshot. Only alphanumeric, -,
                                and _ characters are allowed.
                   .IP • 4
        on-create    Take a snapshot every time the file is created. Default: false
                   .IP • 4
        on-delete    Take a snapshot every time the file is deleted. Default: false
                   .IP • 4
        on-truncate  Take a snapshot when the file is truncated.    Default: false
                   .IP • 4
        on-pattern   Take a snapshot when a line matches the regexp pattern.    Default: none
                   .IP • 4
        count        Maximum number of snapshots for this label. Default: -1 (no limit)

       The snapshots are recorded both in the main resource summary file under the key <b>snapshots</b>, and as a JSON-
       encoded  document, with the extension are identified with the key "snapshot_name", which is a comma sepa‐
       rated string of <b>label</b>(count) elements. A label corresponds to a name that identifies  the  snapshot,  and
       the  count  is  the  number of times an event was triggered since last check (several events may be trig‐
       gered, for example, when several matching lines are written to the log). Several events may have the same
       label, and exactly one of on-create, on-truncate, and on-pattern should be specified per event.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       To monitor 'sleep 10', at 2 second intervals, with output to sleep-log.summary, and with a monitor  alarm
       at 5 seconds:

               % resource_monitor --interval=2 -L"wall_time: 5" -o sleep-log -- sleep 10

       Execute 'date' and redirect its output to a file:

               % resource_monitor --sh 'date &gt; date.output'

       It can also be run automatically from makeflow, by specifying the '-M' flag:

               % makeflow --monitor=some-log-dir Makeflow

       In  this case, makeflow wraps every command line rule with the monitor, and writes the resulting logs per
       rule in the some-log-dir directory

       Additionally, it can be run automatically from Work Queue:

               q = work_queue_create_monitoring(port);
               work_queue_enable_monitoring(q, some-log-dir, /*kill tasks on exhaustion*/ 1);

       wraps every task with the monitor and writes the resulting summaries in some-log-file.

</pre><h4><b>SNAPSHOTS</b> <b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Generate a snapshot when "my.log" is created:

               {
                   "my.log":
                       {
                           "events":[
                               {
                                   "label":"MY_LOG_STARTED",
                                   "on-create:true
                               }
                           ]
                       }
               }

       Generate snapshots every time a line is added to "my.log":

               {
                   "my.log":
                       {
                           "events":[
                               {
                                   "label":"MY_LOG_LINE",
                                   "on-pattern":"^.*$"
                               }
                           ]
                       }
               }

       Generate snapshots on particular lines of "my.log":

               {
                   "my.log":
                       {
                           "events":[
                               {
                                   "label":"started",
                                   "on-pattern":"^# START"
                               },
                               {
                                   "label":"end-of-start",
                                   "on-pattern":"^# PROCESSING"
                               }
                               {
                                   "label":"end-of-processing",
                                   "on-pattern":"^# ANALYSIS"
                               }
                           ]
                       }
               }

       The monitor can also generate a snapshot when a particular file is created. The monitor can detected this
       file, generate a snapshot, and delete the file to get ready for the next snapshot. In the following exam‐
       ple the monitor takes a snapshot everytime the file please-take-a-snapshot is created:

               {
                   "please-take-a-snapshot":
                       {
                           "delete-if-found":true,
                           "events":[
                               {
                                   "label":"manual-snapshot",
                                   "on-create":true
                               }
                           ]
                       }
               }

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b> <b>AND</b> <b>KNOWN</b> <b>ISSUES</b></h4><pre>
       •   The monitor cannot track the children of statically linked executables.

       •   The option --snapshot-events assumes that the watched files are written by appending  to  them.  File
           truncation  may not be detected if between checks the size of the file is larger or equal to the size
           after truncation. File checks are fixed at intervals of 1 second.
