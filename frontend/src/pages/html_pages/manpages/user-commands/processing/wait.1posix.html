</pre><h4><b>PROLOG</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       wait — await process completion

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       wait <b>[</b><u>pid</u>...<b>]</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       When  an asynchronous list (see <u>Section</u> <u>2.9.3.1</u>, <u>Examples</u>) is started by the shell, the process ID of the
       last command in each element of the asynchronous list shall become known in the current  shell  execution
       environment; see <u>Section</u> <u>2.12</u>, <u>Shell</u> <u>Execution</u> <u>Environment</u>.

       If  the  <u>wait</u>  utility  is  invoked  with  no  operands, it shall wait until all process IDs known to the
       invoking shell have terminated and exit with a zero exit status.

       If one or more <u>pid</u> operands are specified that represent known process IDs, the <u>wait</u> utility  shall  wait
       until  all  of  them  have  terminated.  If one or more <u>pid</u> operands are specified that represent unknown
       process IDs, <u>wait</u> shall treat them as if they were known process IDs that exited with  exit  status  127.
       The  exit  status  returned  by the <u>wait</u> utility shall be the exit status of the process requested by the
       last <u>pid</u> operand.

       The known process IDs are applicable only  for  invocations  of  <u>wait</u>  in  the  current  shell  execution
       environment.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>OPERANDS</b></h4><pre>
       The following operand shall be supported:

       <u>pid</u>       One of the following:

                  1. The  unsigned decimal integer process ID of a command, for which the utility is to wait for
                     the termination.

                  2. A job control job ID (see the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <u>Section</u>  <u>3.204</u>,  <u>Job</u>
                     <u>Control</u>  <u>Job</u>  <u>ID</u>)  that  identifies  a  background  process group to be waited for. The job
                     control job ID notation is applicable only for invocations of <u>wait</u>  in  the  current  shell
                     execution  environment;  see <u>Section</u> <u>2.12</u>, <u>Shell</u> <u>Execution</u> <u>Environment</u>.  The exit status of
                     <u>wait</u> shall be determined by the last command in the pipeline.

                     <b>Note:</b>     The job control job ID type of <u>pid</u> is only available on  systems  supporting  the
                               User Portability Utilities option.

</pre><h4><b>STDIN</b></h4><pre>
       Not used.

</pre><h4><b>INPUT</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of <u>wait</u>:

       <u>LANG</u>      Provide a default value for the internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See the
                 Base  Definitions  volume  of POSIX.1‐2017, <u>Section</u> <u>8.2</u>, <u>Internationalization</u> <u>Variables</u> for the
                 precedence  of  internationalization  variables  used  to  determine  the  values   of   locale
                 categories.)

       <u>LC_ALL</u>    If  set  to a non-empty string value, override the values of all the other internationalization
                 variables.

       <u>LC_CTYPE</u>  Determine the locale for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of text  data  as  characters
                 (for example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments).

       <u>LC_MESSAGES</u>
                 Determine  the  locale  that  should  be  used  to affect the format and contents of diagnostic
                 messages written to standard error.

       <u>NLSPATH</u>   Determine the location of message catalogs for the processing of <u>LC_MESSAGES</u>.

</pre><h4><b>ASYNCHRONOUS</b> <b>EVENTS</b></h4><pre>
       Default.

</pre><h4><b>STDOUT</b></h4><pre>
       Not used.

</pre><h4><b>STDERR</b></h4><pre>
       The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.

</pre><h4><b>OUTPUT</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>EXTENDED</b> <b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       If one or more operands were specified, all of them have terminated or were not  known  by  the  invoking
       shell,  and  the status of the last operand specified is known, then the exit status of <u>wait</u> shall be the
       exit status information of the command indicated by the last operand specified. If the process terminated
       abnormally due to the receipt of a signal, the exit status  shall  be  greater  than  128  and  shall  be
       distinct  from  the  exit status generated by other signals, but the exact value is unspecified. (See the
       <u>kill</u> <b>-l</b> option.) Otherwise, the <u>wait</u> utility shall exit with one of the following values:

           0   The <u>wait</u> utility was invoked with no operands and all process IDs known  by  the  invoking  shell
               have terminated.

       1‐126   The <u>wait</u> utility detected an error.

         127   The command identified by the last <u>pid</u> operand specified is unknown.

</pre><h4><b>CONSEQUENCES</b> <b>OF</b> <b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       Default.

       <u>The</u> <u>following</u> <u>sections</u> <u>are</u> <u>informative.</u>

</pre><h4><b>APPLICATION</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       On  most  implementations,  <u>wait</u>  is  a shell built-in. If it is called in a subshell or separate utility
       execution environment, such as one of the following:

           (wait)
           nohup wait ...
           find . -exec wait ... \;

       it returns immediately because there are no known process IDs to wait for in those environments.

       Historical implementations of interactive shells have discarded the exit status of terminated  background
       processes before each shell prompt. Therefore, the status of background processes was usually lost unless
       it terminated while <u>wait</u> was waiting for it. This could be a serious problem when a job that was expected
       to run for a long time actually terminated quickly with a syntax or initialization error because the exit
       status  returned  was usually zero if the requested process ID was not found. This volume of POSIX.1‐2017
       requires the implementation to keep  the  status  of  terminated  jobs  available  until  the  status  is
       requested, so that scripts like:

           j1&amp;
           p1=$!
           j2&amp;
           wait $p1
           echo Job 1 exited with status $?
           wait $!
           echo Job 2 exited with status $?

       work  without losing status on any of the jobs. The shell is allowed to discard the status of any process
       if it determines that the application cannot get the process ID for that process from the  shell.  It  is
       also required to remember only {CHILD_MAX} number of processes in this way. Since the only way to get the
       process  ID  from  the  shell  is  by using the <b>'!'</b>  shell parameter, the shell is allowed to discard the
       status of an asynchronous list if <b>"$!"</b> was not referenced before another asynchronous list  was  started.
       (This  means  that  the  shell  only  has to keep the status of the last asynchronous list started if the
       application did not reference <b>"$!"</b>.  If the implementation of the shell is smart enough to determine that
       a reference to <b>"$!"</b> was not saved anywhere that the application can retrieve it later, it  can  use  this
       information  to  trim  the  list  of  saved information. Note also that a successful call to <u>wait</u> with no
       operands discards the exit status of all asynchronous lists.)

       If the exit status of <u>wait</u> is greater than 128, there is no way  for  the  application  to  know  if  the
       waited-for  process  exited  with  that  value or was killed by a signal.  Since most utilities exit with
       small values, there is seldom any ambiguity. Even in the ambiguous cases, most applications just need  to
       know  that the asynchronous job failed; it does not matter whether it detected an error and failed or was
       killed and did not complete its job normally.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Although the exact value used when a process is terminated by a signal is unspecified,  if  it  is  known
       that  a  signal terminated a process, a script can still reliably determine which signal by using <u>kill</u> as
       shown by the following script:

           sleep 1000&amp;
           pid=$!
           kill -kill $pid
           wait $pid
           echo $pid was terminated by a SIG$(kill -l $?) signal.

       If the following sequence of commands is run in less than 31 seconds:

           sleep 257 | sleep 31 &amp;
           jobs -l %%

       either of the following commands returns the exit status of the second <u>sleep</u> in the pipeline:

           wait <u>&lt;pid</u> <u>of</u> <u>sleep</u> <u>31&gt;</u>
           wait %%

</pre><h4><b>RATIONALE</b></h4><pre>
       The description of <u>wait</u> does not refer to the <u>waitpid</u>() function from the  System  Interfaces  volume  of
       POSIX.1‐2017  because  that  would needlessly overspecify this interface. However, the wording means that
       <u>wait</u> is required to wait for an explicit process when  it  is  given  an  argument  so  that  the  status
       information  of  other  processes  is  not  consumed.  Historical implementations use the <u>wait</u>() function
       defined in the System Interfaces volume of POSIX.1‐2017 until <u>wait</u>() returns the requested process ID  or
       finds  that  the  requested  process  does  not  exist.  Because this means that a shell script could not
       reliably get the status of all background children if a second background job was ever started before the
       first job finished, it is recommended that the <u>wait</u> utility  use  a  method  such  as  the  functionality
       provided by the <u>waitpid</u>() function.

       The ability to wait for multiple <u>pid</u> operands was adopted from the KornShell.

       This  new  functionality  was added because it is needed to determine the exit status of any asynchronous
       list accurately. The only compatibility problem that this change creates is for a script like

           while sleep 60 do
               job&amp; echo Job started $(date) as $!  done

       which causes the shell to monitor all of the jobs started until the script  terminates  or  runs  out  of
       memory.  This  would  not  be  a  problem  if  the  loop  did  not  reference <b>"$!"</b> or if the script would
       occasionally <u>wait</u> for jobs it started.
