</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       flog — speed up a process

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>flog</b> [<b>-l</b> <u>n</u>] [<b>-a</b> <u>m</u>] [<b>-u</b>] process-id

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Flog</u>  is  used  to stimulate an improvement in the performance of a process that is already in execution.
       The <u>process-id</u> is the process number of the process that is to be disciplined.

       The value <u>n</u> of the <b>-l</b> flag is the flagellation constant, i.e., the number of <u>lashes</u>  to  be  administered
       per minute.  If this argument is omitted, the default is 17, which is the most random random number.

       The  value  <u>m</u> of the <b>-a</b> flag is the number of times the inducement to speed up is to be <u>administered</u>.  If
       this argument is omitted, the default is one, which is based on  the  possibility  that  after  that  the
       process will rectify its behavior of its own volition.

       The  presence  of the <b>-u</b> flag indicates that <u>flog</u> is to be <u>unmerciful</u> in its actions.  This nullifies the
       effects of the other keyletter arguments.  It is recommended that this option be used only  on  extremely
       stubborn processes, as its over-use may have detrimental effects.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Flog</u> will read the file <u>/have/mercy</u> for any entry containing the process-id of the process being speeded-
       up.   The  file  can  contain  whatever supplications are deemed necessary, but, of course, these will be
       ignored if the <b>-u</b> flag is supplied.

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       On Improving Process Performance by the Administration of Corrective Stimulation, <u>CACM</u> <u>,</u>  vol.  4,  1657,
       pp. 356-654.

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       If  a named process does not exist, <u>flog</u> replies ``flog you'' on the standard output.  If <u>flog</u> happens to
       <u><a href="../man2/kill.2.html">kill</a></u>(2) the process, which usually happens when the <b>-u</b> keyletter argument is supplied, it writes ``RIP,''
       followed by the process-id of the deceased, on the standard output.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Spurious supplications for mercy by the process being flogged sometimes wind up on the  standard  output,
       rather than in <u>/shut/up</u>.

                                                                                                      <u><a href="../man1fun/FLOG.1fun.html">FLOG</a></u>(1fun)
