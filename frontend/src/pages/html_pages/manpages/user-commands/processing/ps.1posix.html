</pre><h4><b>PROLOG</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       ps — report process status

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       ps <b>[</b>-aA<b>]</b> <b>[</b>-defl<b>]</b> <b>[</b>-g <u>grouplist</u><b>]</b> <b>[</b>-G <u>grouplist</u><b>]</b>
           <b>[</b>-n <u>namelist</u><b>]</b> <b>[</b>-o <u>format</u><b>]</b>... <b>[</b>-p <u>proclist</u><b>]</b> <b>[</b>-t <u>termlist</u><b>]</b>
           <b>[</b>-u <u>userlist</u><b>]</b> <b>[</b>-U <u>userlist</u><b>]</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>ps</u>  utility  shall  write  information  about processes, subject to having appropriate privileges to
       obtain information about those processes.

       By default, <u>ps</u> shall select all processes with the same effective user ID as the  current  user  and  the
       same controlling terminal as the invoker.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>ps</u> utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <u>Section</u> <u>12.2</u>, <u>Utility</u> <u>Syntax</u>
       <u>Guidelines</u>.

       The following options shall be supported:

       <b>-a</b>        Write  information  for  all  processes  associated  with  terminals.  Implementations may omit
                 session leaders from this list.

       <b>-A</b>        Write information for all processes.

       <b>-d</b>        Write information for all processes, except session leaders.

       <b>-e</b>        Write information for all processes.  (Equivalent to <b>-A</b>.)

       <b>-f</b>        Generate a <b>full</b> listing. (See the STDOUT section for the contents of a <b>full</b> listing.)

       <b>-g</b> <u>grouplist</u>
                 Write information for processes whose session leaders are given in <u>grouplist</u>.  The  application
                 shall  ensure  that  the  <u>grouplist</u>  is  a  single  argument  in  the  form  of  a  &lt;blank&gt;  or
                 &lt;comma&gt;-separated list.

       <b>-G</b> <u>grouplist</u>
                 Write information for processes whose real group  ID  numbers  are  given  in  <u>grouplist</u>.   The
                 application  shall  ensure  that the <u>grouplist</u> is a single argument in the form of a &lt;blank&gt; or
                 &lt;comma&gt;-separated list.

       <b>-l</b>        Generate a <b>long</b> listing. (See STDOUT for the contents of a <b>long</b> listing.)

       <b>-n</b> <u>namelist</u>
                 Specify the name of an alternative system <u>namelist</u> file in place of the default.  The  name  of
                 the default file and the format of a <u>namelist</u> file are unspecified.

       <b>-o</b> <u>format</u> Write  information  according  to  the  format  specification  given  in <u>format</u>.  This is fully
                 described in the STDOUT section. Multiple <b>-o</b> options can be specified; the format specification
                 shall be interpreted as the &lt;space&gt;-separated concatenation of all the <u>format</u> option-arguments.

       <b>-p</b> <u>proclist</u>
                 Write information  for  processes  whose  process  ID  numbers  are  given  in  <u>proclist</u>.   The
                 application  shall  ensure  that  the <u>proclist</u> is a single argument in the form of a &lt;blank&gt; or
                 &lt;comma&gt;-separated list.

       <b>-t</b> <u>termlist</u>
                 Write information for processes associated with terminals given in <u>termlist</u>.   The  application
                 shall   ensure  that  the  <u>termlist</u>  is  a  single  argument  in  the  form  of  a  &lt;blank&gt;  or
                 &lt;comma&gt;-separated list. Terminal  identifiers  shall  be  given  in  an  implementation-defined
                 format.   On  XSI-conformant  systems,  they  shall  be given in one of two forms: the device's
                 filename (for example, <b>tty04</b>) or, if the device's filename starts with <b>tty</b>, just the identifier
                 following the characters <b>tty</b> (for example, <b>"04"</b>).

       <b>-u</b> <u>userlist</u>
                 Write information for processes whose user ID numbers or login names  are  given  in  <u>userlist</u>.
                 The application shall ensure that the <u>userlist</u> is a single argument in the form of a &lt;blank&gt; or
                 &lt;comma&gt;-separated  list.  In  the listing, the numerical user ID shall be written unless the <b>-f</b>
                 option is used, in which case the login name shall be written.

       <b>-U</b> <u>userlist</u>
                 Write information for processes whose real  user  ID  numbers  or  login  names  are  given  in
                 <u>userlist</u>.  The application shall ensure that the <u>userlist</u> is a single argument in the form of a
                 &lt;blank&gt; or &lt;comma&gt;-separated list.

       With  the  exception  of  <b>-f</b>, <b>-l</b>, <b>-n</b> <u>namelist</u>, and <b>-o</b> <u>format</u>, all of the options shown are used to select
       processes. If any are specified, the default list shall be ignored and  <u>ps</u>  shall  select  the  processes
       represented by the inclusive OR of all the selection-criteria options.

</pre><h4><b>OPERANDS</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>STDIN</b></h4><pre>
       Not used.

</pre><h4><b>INPUT</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of <u>ps</u>:

       <u>COLUMNS</u>   Override the system-selected horizontal display line size, used to determine the number of text
                 columns  to  display.  See  the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <u>Chapter</u> <u>8</u>, <u>Environment</u>
                 <u>Variables</u> for valid values and results when it is unset or null.

       <u>LANG</u>      Provide a default value for the internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See the
                 Base Definitions volume  of  POSIX.1‐2017,  <u>Section</u>  <u>8.2</u>,  <u>Internationalization</u>  <u>Variables</u>  the
                 precedence   of   internationalization  variables  used  to  determine  the  values  of  locale
                 categories.)

       <u>LC_ALL</u>    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values of all the  other  internationalization
                 variables.

       <u>LC_CTYPE</u>  Determine  the  locale  for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of text data as characters
                 (for example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments).

       <u>LC_MESSAGES</u>
                 Determine the locale that should be used to  affect  the  format  and  contents  of  diagnostic
                 messages written to standard error and informative messages written to standard output.

       <u>LC_TIME</u>   Determine the format and contents of the date and time strings displayed.

       <u>NLSPATH</u>   Determine the location of message catalogs for the processing of <u>LC_MESSAGES</u>.

       <u>TZ</u>        Determine  the  timezone  used  to calculate date and time strings displayed. If <u>TZ</u> is unset or
                 null, an unspecified default timezone shall be used.

</pre><h4><b>ASYNCHRONOUS</b> <b>EVENTS</b></h4><pre>
       Default.

</pre><h4><b>STDOUT</b></h4><pre>
       When the <b>-o</b> option is not specified, the standard output format is unspecified.

       On XSI-conformant systems, the output format shall be as follows.  The column headings  and  descriptions
       of  the columns in a <u>ps</u> listing are given below. The precise meanings of these fields are implementation-
       defined. The letters <b>'f'</b> and <b>'l'</b> (below) indicate  the  option  (<b>full</b>  or  <b>long</b>)  that  shall  cause  the
       corresponding  heading  to appear; <b>all</b> means that the heading always appears. Note that these two options
       determine only what information is provided for a process; they do  not  determine  which  processes  are
       listed.
       <b>F</b>       (l)     Flags  (octal and additive) associated with
                       the process.
       <b>S</b>       (l)     The state of the process.
       <b>UID</b>     (f,l)   The user ID number of  the  process  owner;
                       the  login  name  is  printed  under the <b>-f</b>
                       option.
       <b>PID</b>     (all)   The  process  ID  of  the  process;  it  is
                       possible to kill a process if this datum is
                       known.
       <b>PPID</b>    (f,l)   The process ID of the parent process.
       <b>C</b>       (f,l)   Processor utilization for scheduling.
       <b>PRI</b>     (l)     The priority of the process; higher numbers
                       mean lower priority.
       <b>NI</b>      (l)     Nice value; used in priority computation.
       <b>ADDR</b>    (l)     The address of the process.
       <b>SZ</b>      (l)     The size in blocks of the core image of the
                       process.
       <b>WCHAN</b>   (l)     The  event for which the process is waiting
                       or  sleeping;  if  blank,  the  process  is
                       running.
       <b>STIME</b>   (f)     Starting time of the process.
       <b>TTY</b>     (all)   The controlling terminal for the process.
       <b>TIME</b>    (all)   The   cumulative  execution  time  for  the
                       process.
       <b>CMD</b>     (all)   The command name; the full command name and
                       its arguments  are  written  under  the  <b>-f</b>
                       option.

       A  process  that  has  exited  and  has a parent, but has not yet been waited for by the parent, shall be
       marked <b>defunct</b>.

       Under the option <b>-f</b>, <u>ps</u> tries to determine the command name and arguments  given  when  the  process  was
       created  by examining memory or the swap area. Failing this, the command name, as it would appear without
       the option <b>-f</b>, is written in square brackets.

       The <b>-o</b> option allows the output format to be specified under user control.

       The application shall ensure that the format specification is a list  of  names  presented  as  a  single
       argument,  &lt;blank&gt;  or  &lt;comma&gt;-separated.  Each variable has a default header. The default header can be
       overridden by appending an &lt;equals-sign&gt; and the new text of the header. The rest of  the  characters  in
       the  argument  shall  be  used  as  the  header  text. The fields specified shall be written in the order
       specified on the command line, and should be arranged in columns in the output. The field widths shall be
       selected by the system to be at least as wide as the header text (default or overridden  value).  If  the
       header  text  is  null, such as <b>-o</b> <u>user</u>=, the field width shall be at least as wide as the default header
       text.  If all header text fields are null, no header line shall be written.

       The following names are recognized in the POSIX locale:

       <b>ruser</b>   The real user ID of the process. This shall be the textual user ID, if it can be obtained and the
               field width permits, or a decimal representation otherwise.

       <b>user</b>    The effective user ID of the process. This shall be the textual user ID, if it  can  be  obtained
               and the field width permits, or a decimal representation otherwise.

       <b>rgroup</b>  The  real  group ID of the process. This shall be the textual group ID, if it can be obtained and
               the field width permits, or a decimal representation otherwise.

       <b>group</b>   The effective group ID of the process. This shall be the textual group ID, if it can be  obtained
               and the field width permits, or a decimal representation otherwise.

       <b>pid</b>     The decimal value of the process ID.

       <b>ppid</b>    The decimal value of the parent process ID.

       <b>pgid</b>    The decimal value of the process group ID.

       <b>pcpu</b>    The  ratio  of  CPU  time  used recently to CPU time available in the same period, expressed as a
               percentage. The meaning of ``recently'' in this context is unspecified. The CPU time available is
               determined in an unspecified manner.

       <b>vsz</b>     The size of the process in (virtual) memory in 1024 byte units as a decimal integer.

       <b>nice</b>    The decimal value of the nice value of the process; see <u>nice</u>.

       <b>etime</b>   In the POSIX locale, the elapsed time since the process was started, in the form:

                   <b>[[</b><u>dd</u>-<b>]</b><u>hh</u>:<b>]</b><u>mm</u>:<u>ss</u>

               where <u>dd</u> shall represent the number of days, <u>hh</u> the number of hours, <u>mm</u> the  number  of  minutes,
               and  <u>ss</u> the number of seconds. The <u>dd</u> field shall be a decimal integer. The <u>hh</u>, <u>mm</u>, and <u>ss</u> fields
               shall be two-digit decimal integers padded on the left with zeros.

       <b>time</b>    In the POSIX locale, the cumulative CPU time of the process in the form:

                   <b>[</b><u>dd</u>-<b>]</b><u>hh</u>:<u>mm</u>:<u>ss</u>

               The <u>dd</u>, <u>hh</u>, <u>mm</u>, and <u>ss</u> fields shall be as described in the <b>etime</b> specifier.

       <b>tty</b>     The name of the controlling terminal of the process (if any) in the same format used by  the  <u>who</u>
               utility.

       <b>comm</b>    The name of the command being executed (<u>argv</u>[0] value) as a string.

       <b>args</b>    The command with all its arguments as a string. The implementation may truncate this value to the
               field  width;  it  is  implementation-defined  whether  any  further  truncation  occurs.  It  is
               unspecified whether the string represented is a version of the argument list as it was passed  to
               the  command  when it started, or is a version of the arguments as they may have been modified by
               the application. Applications cannot depend on being able  to  modify  their  argument  list  and
               having that modification be reflected in the output of <u>ps</u>.

       Any  field need not be meaningful in all implementations. In such a case a &lt;hyphen-minus&gt; (<b>'-'</b>) should be
       output in place of the field value.

       Only <b>comm</b> and  <b>args</b>  shall  be  allowed  to  contain  &lt;blank&gt;  characters;  all  others  shall  not.  Any
       implementation-defined  variables  shall  be specified in the system documentation along with the default
       header and indicating whether the field may contain &lt;blank&gt; characters.

       The following table specifies the default header to be used in the POSIX  locale  corresponding  to  each
       format specifier.

</pre><h4><b>CONSEQUENCES</b> <b>OF</b> <b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       Default.

       <u>The</u> <u>following</u> <u>sections</u> <u>are</u> <u>informative.</u>

</pre><h4><b>APPLICATION</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       Things  can  change while <u>ps</u> is running; the snapshot it gives is only true for an instant, and might not
       be accurate by the time it is displayed.

       The <b>args</b> format specifier is allowed to produce a truncated version of the  command  arguments.  In  some
       implementations, this information is no longer available when the <u>ps</u> utility is executed.

       If the field width is too narrow to display a textual ID, the system may use a numeric version. Normally,
       the  system  would  be expected to choose large enough field widths, but if a large number of fields were
       selected to write, it might squeeze fields to their minimum sizes to fit on one line. One way  to  ensure
       adequate  width  for the textual IDs is to override the default header for a field to make it larger than
       most or all user or group names.

       There is no special quoting mechanism for header text. The header text is the rest of  the  argument.  If
       multiple header changes are needed, multiple <b>-o</b> options can be used, such as:

           ps -o "user=User Name" -o pid=Process\ ID

       On some implementations, especially multi-level secure systems, <u>ps</u> may be severely restricted and produce
       information only about child processes owned by the user.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       The command:

           ps -o user,pid,ppid=MOM -o args

       writes at least the following in the POSIX locale:

             USER   PID   MOM   COMMAND
           helene    34    12   ps -o uid,pid,ppid=MOM -o args

       The  contents  of  the  <b>COMMAND</b>  field  need  not  be  the  same  in all implementations, due to possible
       truncation.

</pre><h4><b>RATIONALE</b></h4><pre>
       There is very little commonality between BSD and System V implementations of <u>ps</u>.  Many  options  conflict
       or  have  subtly  different  usages. The standard developers attempted to select a set of options for the
       base standard that were useful on a wide range of  systems  and  selected  options  that  either  can  be
       implemented  on both BSD and System V-based systems without breaking the current implementations or where
       the options are sufficiently similar that any changes would  not  be  unduly  problematic  for  users  or
       implementors.

       It  is  recognized  that on some implementations, especially multi-level secure systems, <u>ps</u> may be nearly
       useless. The  default  output  has  therefore  been  chosen  such  that  it  does  not  break  historical
       implementations and also is likely to provide at least some useful information on most systems.

       The  major  change  is  the  addition  of  the  format  specification capability. The motivation for this
       invention is to provide a mechanism for users to access a wider  range  of  system  information,  if  the
       system  permits it, in a portable manner. The fields chosen to appear in this volume of POSIX.1‐2017 were
       arrived at after considering what concepts were likely to be both reasonably useful  to  the  ``average''
       user  and had a reasonable chance of being implemented on a wide range of systems. Again it is recognized
       that not all systems are able to provide all the information and, conversely, some may  wish  to  provide
       more.  It  is hoped that the approach adopted will be sufficiently flexible and extensible to accommodate
       most systems. Implementations may be expected to introduce new format specifiers.

       The default output should consist of a short listing containing the process ID, terminal name, cumulative
       execution time, and command name of each process.

       The preference of the standard developers would have been to make the format specification an operand  of
       the <u>ps</u> command. Unfortunately, BSD usage precluded this.

       At  one  time  a  format  was  included to display the environment array of the process. This was deleted
       because there is no portable way to display it.

       The <b>-A</b> option is equivalent to the BSD <b>-g</b> and the SVID <b>-e</b>.  Because the two systems differed, a  mnemonic
       compromise was selected.

       The  <b>-a</b>  option  is described with some optional behavior because the SVID omits session leaders, but BSD
       does not.

       In an early proposal, format specifiers appeared for priority and start time. The former was not  defined
       adequately  in  this  volume  of POSIX.1‐2017 and was removed in deference to the defined nice value; the
       latter because elapsed time was considered to be more useful.

       In a new BSD version of <u>ps</u>, a <b>-O</b> option can be used to write all of the default information, followed  by
       additional  format specifiers. This was not adopted because the default output is implementation-defined.
       Nevertheless, this is a useful option that should be reserved for that purpose. In the <b>-o</b> option for  the
       POSIX  Shell  and Utilities <u>ps</u>, the format is the concatenation of each <b>-o</b>.  Therefore, the user can have
       an alias or function that defines the beginning of their desired format and add more fields to the end of
       the output in certain cases where that would be useful.

       The format of the terminal name is unspecified, but the descriptions of <u>ps</u>, <u>talk</u>, <u>who</u>, and <u>write</u>  require
       that they all use the same format.

       The  <b>pcpu</b>  field  indicates  that  the CPU time available is determined in an unspecified manner. This is
       because it is difficult to express an algorithm that is useful across all possible machine architectures.
       Historical counterparts to this value have attempted to show percentage of use in the recent  past,  such
       as  the  preceding  minute.  Frequently,  these  values  for  all  processes  did  not  add  up  to 100%.
       Implementations are encouraged to provide data in this field  to  users  that  will  help  them  identify
       processes currently affecting the performance of the system.
