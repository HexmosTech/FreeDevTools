</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       qps - Visual Process Manager

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>qps</b> [ <u>options</u> ]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>qps</b>  is  a  monitor that displays the status of the processes currently in existence, much like <a href="../man1/top.1.html">top</a>(1) or
       <a href="../man1/ps.1.html">ps</a>(1).  The user interface uses the Qt toolkit, and most operations should be fairly intuitive.

       The process list is sorted by the highlighted field. Click on another title to  change;  click  again  to
       reverse the sorting order. Rearrange the columns by dragging the titles.

       Left-clicking on a process selects or deselects it. Shift-click to select multiple processes. The PIDs of
       selected processes can be pasted into other applications (this option can be disabled).

       The  right  mouse  button  pops up a context menu, which duplicates some functions from the main menu for
       convenience. It works both on processes and on the column headings.

       Control-clicking in the process table selects  all  processes  with  the  same  displayed  value  in  the
       particular  column  clicked  in.  For  instance,  to select all processes owned by "joshua", keep Control
       pressed while clicking on "joshua". Shift and Control together produces the expected result.

       In Tree mode, the parent-child relations between processes is shown in a more obvious way. Click  on  the
       triangles  to  show or hide an entire subtree.  Sorting only affects siblings; the tree structure imposes
       the global order.

       To change the time-sharing priority of the selected processes, type the new  priority  in  the  <u>Renice...</u>
       dialog. The new nice value should be in the range -20 to 20; 0 is the default. A larger number means that
       the process gets less CPU time.  Only the super-user may decrease the nice value.

       The  <u>Change</u>  <u>Scheduling...</u>   dialog allows the super-user to change the scheduling policy of the selected
       processes (using Posix.1b scheduling control).  Normal processes are set to SCHED_OTHER and  have  static
       priority  0;  (soft)  real-time processes have the policy SCHED_FIFO or SCHED_RR and a static priority in
       the range of 1 to 99. (See <a href="../man2/sched_setscheduler.2.html">sched_setscheduler</a>(2).) Solaris has additional scheduling policies, but  right
       now qps doesn't allow setting these.

       By  default,  the  process  display updates every 5 seconds. To change, type the new update period in the
       <u>Update</u> <u>Period...</u>  dialog. The units min, s and ms may be used (if none, seconds  are  assumed).  You  can
       force  an  update  by pressing the space bar or clicking the <u>Update</u> button. qps will consume a lot of CPU
       time if the update period is short or zero. If iconified, however, qps will use very little CPU.

       The USER field shows the real user ID. If the effective user ID of a process is different from  its  real
       user  ID,  a  plus  sign  (+)  is  appended to the user name; if it is the super-user, an asterisk (*) is
       appended.

       The load, CPU, memory and swap displays in the status  bar  can  be  toggled  between  graphic  and  text
       representations by clicking on them, or by settings in the <u>Preferences...</u>  dialog. The load numbers shown
       are the number of jobs in the run queue averaged over 1, 5 and 15 minutes.

       The  swap  bar  will turn red if free swap space falls below a certain value, which can be changed in the
       <u>Preferences...</u>  dialog. The number can be entered in K, M (megabytes) or % (percent of total swap space).
       The default is 10%.

       On SMP (multi-CPU) machines running Solaris 2.6 or Linux 2.1.x or later, the CPU stats will be shown  for
       each processor in vertical mode, and the average of all CPUs in horizontal mode.

       For  displaying  the WCHAN field as symbols, the kernel symbol file System.map is needed. qps will search
       for it in the following locations:

            /boot/System.map-<u>RELEASE</u>
            /boot/System.map
            <a href="file:/lib/modules/">/lib/modules/</a><u>RELEASE</u>/System.map
            /usr/src/linux-<u>RELEASE</u>/System.map
            /usr/src/linux/System.map
            /usr/local/src/linux-<u>RELEASE</u>/System.map
            /usr/local/src/linux/System.map

       where <u>RELEASE</u> is the kernel release number, for instance "2.0.29". If the System.map file isn't found  or
       unreadable,  hexadecimal  addresses will be displayed instead. The prefixes "sys_" and "do_" are stripped
       from the symbols before they are displayed.  Under Solaris, symbolic names are  currently  not  supported
       and hexadecimal addresses will always be shown.

       The <u>View</u> <u>Details</u> menu item opens a window that shows different aspects of the selected processes. Double-
       clicking  on a process has the same effect. All information is only available to the owner of the process
       (and to the super-user).

       The <u>Sockets</u> table (Linux only) shows the currently used TCP and UDP  sockets.  If  <u>Host</u>  <u>Name</u>  <u>Lookup</u>  is
       checked in the <u>Preferences</u> dialog, a host name lookup will be done for each IP address. This is done by a
       background process but can take a while for difficult cases (but once looked up, addresses are cached).

       The <u>Memory</u> <u>Maps</u> table shows the process's memory mappings. In Linux 2.0.x and Solaris, the file names are
       not given. Anonymous mappings (allocated memory not bound to a file or device) are marked (anonymous).

       The  <u>Files</u>  table  shows  the  process's  open  files.  In  Linux  2.0.x, the files are given on the form
       [<u>AABB</u>]:<u>inode,</u> where <u>AA</u> and <u>BB</u> are the device major/minor numbers in hexadecimal.

       The <u>Environment</u> table shows the process's environment variables. Note that this is the  environment  with
       which  the  process  was started, not necessarily incorporating later changes. Some processes that modify
       their command line, notably <a href="../man8/sendmail.8.html">sendmail</a>(8) and <a href="../man8/ftpd.8.html">ftpd</a>(8), may use the  environment  space  for  this,  showing
       nonsense  in this table. Clicking on the field headings changes sorting order as usual. (On Solaris, only
       the first 8K of the environment are shown. It will be fixed if it turns out to be a limitation.)

       <u>Find</u> <u>Parent</u> and <u>Find</u> <u>Children</u> will select the parent/children of the selected processes, and  center  the
       table  on  the  first  of  them.   <u>Find</u>  <u>Descendants</u> will select the tree of all children of the selected
       processes.

       If <u>Include</u> <u>Child</u> <u>Times</u> is selected in the <u>Options</u> menu, the TIME field will show the sum of the CPU times
       used by the process and all of its children.

       You can specify commands to be run on the selected processes by bringing up the <u>Edit</u> <u>Commands...</u>  dialog.
       The "Description" of each command is what appears in the menu; the "Command  Line"  is  a  shell  command
       (executed with <a href="file:/bin/sh">/bin/sh</a>). Before the command is passed to the shell, the following substitutions are made:

       <b>%p</b>     with the PID (Process ID) of the selected process

       <b>%c</b>     with the short command name of the process

       <b>%C</b>     with the complete command line of the process

       <b>%u</b>     with the name of the (real) owner of the process

       <b>%%</b>     with a literal '%'.

       Any  other % + letter combination is removed. The command line will be run once for each selected process
       (in unspecified order).

       (valid in most contexts)

       <b>Meta-W</b> Close the active window (except the main window)

       <b>Q,</b> <b>Meta-Q</b>
              Quit qps.

       <b>Space</b>  Force an update of the displayed tables.

       <b>Control-Z</b>

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       qps is too big and too slow.

       The %CPU number isn't accurate at very short update intervals due to timer granularity.

       The  %WCPU  field isn't recalculated when qps is iconified, so it might take a while to readjust when the
       window is deiconified again.

       The WCHAN field doesn't show a function name  if  a  process  sleeps  in  a  location  outside  those  in
       System.map  (for  instance, in a kernel module), but a hex address instead. The function name can then be
       found in /proc/ksyms but has to be found by hand right now.

       The CPU indicator in the status bar will display nonsense in SMP systems running Linux  2.0.x  due  to  a
       kernel bug.

       Adding/removing CPUs at runtime will probably confuse qps.
