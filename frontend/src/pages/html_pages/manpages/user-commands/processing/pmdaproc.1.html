</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       <b>pmdaproc</b> - process performance metrics domain agent (PMDA)

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/proc/pmdaproc</b> [<b>-AL</b>] [<b>-d</b> <u>domain</u>] [<b>-l</b> <u>logfile</u>] [<b>-r</b> <u>cgroup</u>] [<b>-U</b> <u>username</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>pmdaproc</b>  is  a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) which extracts performance metrics describing the
       state of the individual processes running on a Linux system.

       The <b>proc</b> PMDA exports metrics that measure the memory, processor and other resource use of each  process,
       as  well  as summary information collated across all of the running processes.  The PMDA uses credentials
       passed from the <b><a href="../man3/PMAPI.3.html">PMAPI</a></b>(3) monitoring tool identifying the user requesting the information, to ensure  that
       only  values  the user is allowed to access are returned by the PMDA.  This involves the PMDA temporarily
       changing its effective user and group identifiers for the duration of requests for instances and  values.
       In other words, system calls to extract information are performed as the user originating the request and
       not  as  a  privileged  user.   The  mechanisms  available for transfer of user credentials are described
       further in the <b><a href="../man1/PCPIntro.1.html">PCPIntro</a></b>(1) page.

       A brief description of the <b>pmdaproc</b> command line options follows:

       <b>-A</b>   Disables use of the credentials provided by <b>PMAPI</b> client tools and simply runs everything under  the
            "root"  account.   Refer  to  the  ACCESS CONFIGURATION section below for finer grained control when
            using <b><a href="../man1/pmcd.1.html">pmcd</a></b>(1) with remote client authentication.  Only enable this  option  if  you  understand  the
            risks  involved,  and  are sure that all remote accesses will be from benevolent users.  If enabled,
            unauthenticated remote <b>PMAPI</b> clients will be able to access potentially sensitive performance metric
            values which an unauthenticated <b>PMAPI</b> client usually would not be able to.  Refer  to  CVE-2011-2495
            and CVE-2012-3419 for additional details.

       <b>-L</b>   Changes the per-process instance domain used by most <b>pmdaproc</b> metrics to include threads as well.

       <b>-d</b>   It  is  absolutely  crucial  that the performance metrics <u>domain</u> number specified here is unique and
            consistent.  That is, <u>domain</u> should be different for every PMDA on the one host, and the same <u>domain</u>
            number should be used for the same PMDA on all hosts.

       <b>-l</b>   Location of the log file.  By default, a log file named <u>proc.log</u> is written in the current directory
            of <b><a href="../man1/pmcd.1.html">pmcd</a></b>(1) when <b>pmdaproc</b> is started, i.e.  <b>$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd</b>.  If the log file cannot be created  or
            is not writable, output is written to the standard error instead.

       <b>-r</b>   Restrict  the  set  of processes exported in the per-process instance domain to only those processes
            that are contained by the specified <u>cgroup</u> resource container.  This  option  provides  an  optional
            finer  granularity  to  the  monitoring,  and  can  also be used to reduce the resources consumed by
            <u>pmdaproc</u> during requests for instances and values.

       <b>-U</b>   User account under which to run the agent.  The default  is  the  privileged  "root"  account,  with
            seteuid (2) and setegid (2) switching for accessing most information.

</pre><h4><b>HOTPROC</b> <b>OVERVIEW</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>pmdaproc</b>  Performance  Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) includes an additional set of per-process metrics
       with an instance domain of processes restricted to an "interesting"  or  "hot"  set.   Unlike  the  stock
       metrics  exported  by  the  <b>proc</b>  PMDA, which have an instance domain equal to the current processes, <b>hot</b>
       metrics have an instance domain which is a subset of this.  This <b>hotproc</b> instance domain is determined by
       a configurable predicate evaluated over some refresh interval.

       As well as the equivalent per-process <b>proc</b> metrics, <b>hotproc</b> provides a <b>cpuburn</b> metric which specifies the
       CPU utilization of the process over the refresh interval, <b>total</b> metrics which indicate how  much  of  the
       available  CPU  time  the "interesting" processes account for, <b>predicate</b> metrics which show the values of
       the reserved variables (see below) that are being used in the hotproc predicate, and <b>control</b> metrics  for
       controlling the agent.

</pre><h4><b>HOTPROC</b> <b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       The  configuration  file  consists  of  one  predicate  used  to  determine if a process should be in the
       interesting set or not.

       An example configuration file may be found at <b>$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/proc/samplehotproc.conf</b>

       This file with any modifications can be copied to <b>$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/proc/hotproc.conf</b> in order to  configure
       the <b>hot</b> metrics. The <b><a href="../man1/pmstore.1.html">pmstore</a></b>(1) and <b><a href="../man3/pmStore.3.html">pmStore</a></b>(3) interfaces can be used as well (described below).

       The  predicate  is  described using the language specified below.  The symbols are based on those used by
       the <b><a href="../man1/C.1.html">C</a></b>(1) and <b><a href="../man1/awk.1.html">awk</a></b>(1) languages.

       Boolean Connectives
              <b>&amp;&amp;</b> (and), <b>||</b> (or), <b>!</b>  (not), <b>()</b> (precedence overriding)

       Number comparators
              <b>&lt;</b> , <b>&lt;=</b> , <b>&gt;</b> , <b>&gt;=</b> , <b>==</b> , <b>!=</b>

       String comparators
              <b>==</b> , <b>!=</b>

       String/Pattern comparators
              <b>~</b> (string matches pattern) , <b>!~</b> (string does not match pattern)

       Reserved variables
              <b>uid</b> (user id; type integer) <b>uname</b> (user name; type string), <b>gid</b> (group  id;  type  integer)  <b>gname</b>
              (group  name; type string), <b>fname</b> (process file name; type string), <b>psargs</b> (process file name with
              args; type string),  <b>cpuburn</b>  (cpu  utilization;  type  float),  <b>iodemand</b>  (I/O  demand  -  Kbytes
              read/written  per  second;  type  float),  <b>ctxswitch</b>  (number of context switches per second; type
              float), <b>syscalls</b> (number of system calls per second; type float),  <b>virtualsize</b>  (virtual  size  in
              Kbytes;  type  float), <b>residentsize</b> (resident size in Kbytes; type float), <b>iowait</b> (blocked and raw
              io wait in secs/sec; type float), <b>schedwait</b> (time waiting in run queue in secs/sec; type float).

       Literal values
              <b>1234</b> (positive integer), <b>0.35</b> (positive float), <b>"foobar"</b> (string; delimited by  <b>"</b>),  <b>/[fF](o)+bar/</b>
              (pattern; delimited by <b>/</b>), <b>true</b> (boolean), <b>false</b> (boolean)

       Comments
              <b>#this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>comment</b> (from <b>#</b> to the end of the line).

       Examples
                cpuburn &gt; 0.2 # cpu utilization of more than 20%
                cpuburn &gt; 0.2 &amp;&amp; uname == "root"
                cpuburn &gt; 0.2 &amp;&amp; (uname == "root" || uname == "hot")
                psargs ~ /pmda/ &amp;&amp; cpuburn &gt; 0.4

       The  <b>hotproc.predicate</b> metrics may be used to see what the values of the reserved variables are that were
       used by the predicate at the last refresh.  They do not cover the reserved variables  which  are  already
       exported  elsewhere.  A  <b>hotproc.predicate</b>  metric  may  not  have a value if it is not referenced in the
       configuration predicate.

</pre><h4><b>DYNAMIC</b> <b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>hot</b> process metrics can also  be  configured  at  runtime  through  the  <b><a href="../man1/pmstore.1.html">pmstore</a></b>(1)  interface  (and,
       implicitly, the <b><a href="../man3/pmStore.3.html">pmStore</a></b>(3) API)

       Examples
                pmstore hotproc.control.config 'fname == "mingetty"'
                pmstore hotproc.control.config 'uid == 0'

       To force the config file to be reloaded:
                pmstore hotproc.control.reload_config "1"

</pre><h4><b>ACCESS</b> <b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       Access to per-process metrics is controlled by several factors.

       When  using automatically authenticating local connections, such as through the "unix:" or "local:" style
       context, then client tools will have full access to these metrics as if sampling the metrics directly  as
       the user running the client tool.

       When using <b>pmcd</b> with remote, authenticated clients it is possible to specify a set of user names that are
       allowed access to the process metrics.

       A  configuration  file  <b>$PCP_SYSCONF_DIR/proc/access.conf</b> can be used to fine-tune this behaviour, and it
       supports two keywords:

       <b>allowed</b>
              A comma-separated list of authenticated user names that will  be  allowed  access  to  per-process
              metrics.  Sampling is performed as the root user.

       <b>mapped</b> A boolean value, when true indicating that authenticated user names will be mapped to local system
              user account names (this requires a one-to-one user name mapping between the account and the SASL-
              based authenticated user name enforced by <b><a href="../man1/pmcd.1.html">pmcd</a></b>(1)).  Sampling is performed as that local user.

</pre><h4><b>INSTALLATION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>proc</b>  PMDA  is  installed  and  available  by default.  If you want to undo the installation, do the
       following as root:

            # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/proc
            # ./Remove

       If you want to establish access to the names, help text and values for the proc performance metrics  once
       more, after removal, do the following as root:

            # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/proc
            # ./Install

       <b>pmdaproc</b>  is  launched  by <b><a href="../man1/pmcd.1.html">pmcd</a></b>(1) and should never be executed directly.  The Install and Remove scripts
       notify <b><a href="../man1/pmcd.1.html">pmcd</a></b>(1) when the agent is installed or removed.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>$PCP_PMCDCONF_PATH</b>
                 command line options used to launch <b>pmdaproc</b>
       <b>$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/proc/help</b>
                 default help text file for the proc metrics
       <b>$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/proc/Install</b>
                 installation script for the <b>pmdaproc</b> agent

</pre><h4><b>PCP</b> <b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       Environment variables with the prefix <b>PCP_</b> are used to parameterize the file and directory names used  by
       PCP.   On  each  installation, the file <u>/etc/pcp.conf</u> contains the local values for these variables.  The
       <b>$PCP_CONF</b> variable may be used to specify an alternative configuration file, as described in <b><a href="../man5/pcp.conf.5.html">pcp.conf</a></b>(5).
