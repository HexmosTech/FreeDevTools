</pre><h4><b>PROLOG</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       renice — set nice values of running processes

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       renice <b>[</b>-g|-p|-u<b>]</b> -n <u>increment</u> <u>ID</u>...

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>renice</u>  utility shall request that the nice values (see the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017,
       <u>Section</u> <u>3.244</u>, <u>Nice</u> <u>Value</u>) of one or more running  processes  be  changed.  By  default,  the  applicable
       processes  are  specified  by  their process IDs. When a process group is specified (see <b>-g</b>), the request
       shall apply to all processes in the process group.

       The nice value shall be bounded in an implementation-defined manner.  If the  requested  <u>increment</u>  would
       raise  or  lower  the  nice  value of the executed utility beyond implementation-defined limits, then the
       limit whose value was exceeded shall be used.

       When a user is <u>renice</u>d, the request applies to all processes whose saved set-user-ID matches the user  ID
       corresponding to the user.

       Regardless  of  which options are supplied or any other factor, <u>renice</u> shall not alter the nice values of
       any process unless the user requesting such a  change  has  appropriate  privileges  to  do  so  for  the
       specified  process. If the user lacks appropriate privileges to perform the requested action, the utility
       shall return an error status.

       The saved set-user-ID of the user's process shall be checked instead of its effective user ID when <u>renice</u>
       attempts to determine the user ID of the process in order to determine whether the user  has  appropriate
       privileges.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>renice</u>  utility  shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <u>Section</u> <u>12.2</u>, <u>Utility</u>
       <u>Syntax</u> <u>Guidelines</u>, except for Guideline 9.

       The following options shall be supported:

       <b>-g</b>        Interpret the following operands as unsigned decimal integer process group IDs.

       <b>-n</b> <u>increment</u>
                 Specify how the nice value of the specified  process  or  processes  is  to  be  adjusted.  The
                 <u>increment</u>  option-argument  is  a  positive  or  negative decimal integer that shall be used to
                 modify the nice value of the specified process or processes.

                 Positive <u>increment</u> values shall cause a lower nice value. Negative <u>increment</u> values may require
                 appropriate privileges and shall cause a higher nice value.

       <b>-p</b>        Interpret the following operands as unsigned decimal integer process IDs. The <b>-p</b> option is  the
                 default if no options are specified.

       <b>-u</b>        Interpret  the  following  operands  as  users.  If a user exists with a user name equal to the
                 operand, then the user ID of that user is used in further processing. Otherwise, if the operand
                 represents an unsigned decimal integer, it shall be used as the numeric user ID of the user.

</pre><h4><b>OPERANDS</b></h4><pre>
       The following operands shall be supported:

       <u>ID</u>        A process ID, process group ID, or user name/user ID, depending on the option selected.

</pre><h4><b>STDIN</b></h4><pre>
       Not used.

</pre><h4><b>INPUT</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of <u>renice</u>:

       <u>LANG</u>      Provide a default value for the internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See the
                 Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <u>Section</u> <u>8.2</u>, <u>Internationalization</u>  <u>Variables</u>  for  the
                 precedence   of   internationalization  variables  used  to  determine  the  values  of  locale
                 categories.)

       <u>LC_ALL</u>    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values of all the  other  internationalization
                 variables.

       <u>LC_CTYPE</u>  Determine  the  locale  for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of text data as characters
                 (for example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments).

       <u>LC_MESSAGES</u>
                 Determine the locale that should be used to  affect  the  format  and  contents  of  diagnostic
                 messages written to standard error.

       <u>NLSPATH</u>   Determine the location of message catalogs for the processing of <u>LC_MESSAGES</u>.

</pre><h4><b>ASYNCHRONOUS</b> <b>EVENTS</b></h4><pre>
       Default.

</pre><h4><b>STDOUT</b></h4><pre>
       Not used.

</pre><h4><b>STDERR</b></h4><pre>
       The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.

</pre><h4><b>OUTPUT</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>EXTENDED</b> <b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       The following exit values shall be returned:

        0    Successful completion.

       &gt;0    An error occurred.

</pre><h4><b>CONSEQUENCES</b> <b>OF</b> <b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       Default.

       <u>The</u> <u>following</u> <u>sections</u> <u>are</u> <u>informative.</u>

</pre><h4><b>APPLICATION</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
        1. Adjust the nice value so that process IDs 987 and 32 would have a lower nice value:

               renice -n 5 -p 987 32

        2. Adjust  the  nice  value so that group IDs 324 and 76 would have a higher nice value, if the user has
           appropriate privileges to do so:

               renice -n -4 -g 324 76

        3. Adjust the nice value so that numeric user ID 8 and user <b>sas</b> would have a lower nice value:

               renice -n 4 -u 8 sas

       Useful nice value increments on historical systems include 19 or 20 (the affected processes run only when
       nothing else in the system attempts to run) and any negative number (to make processes run faster).

</pre><h4><b>RATIONALE</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>gid</u>, <u>pid</u>, and <u>user</u> specifications do not fit either the definition  of  operand  or  option-argument.
       However, for clarity, they have been included in the OPTIONS section, rather than the OPERANDS section.

       The  definition  of  nice value is not intended to suggest that all processes in a system have priorities
       that are comparable. Scheduling  policy  extensions  such  as  the  realtime  priorities  in  the  System
       Interfaces  volume  of  POSIX.1‐2017  make  the notion of a single underlying priority for all scheduling
       policies problematic. Some  implementations  may  implement  the  <u>nice</u>-related  features  to  affect  all
       processes on the system, others to affect just the general time-sharing activities implied by this volume
       of  POSIX.1‐2017,  and others may have no effect at all. Because of the use of ``implementation-defined''
       in <u>nice</u> and <u>renice</u>, a wide range of implementation strategies are possible.

       Originally, this utility was written in the historical manner, using the term ``nice  value''.  This  was
       always  a  point  of  concern with users because it was never intuitively obvious what this meant. With a
       newer version of <u>renice</u>, which used the term ``system scheduling priority'', it  was  hoped  that  novice
       users  could  better  understand  what this utility was meant to do. Also, it would be easier to document
       what the utility was  meant  to  do.  Unfortunately,  the  addition  of  the  POSIX  realtime  scheduling
       capabilities  introduced  the  concepts  of  process  and  thread scheduling priorities that were totally
       unaffected by the <u>nice</u>/<u>renice</u> utilities or the <u>nice</u>()/<u>setpriority</u>() functions. Continuing to use the term
       ``system scheduling priority'' would have incorrectly suggested that these utilities and  functions  were
       indeed  affecting  these  realtime  priorities.  It  was  decided to revert to the historical term ``nice
       value'' to reference this unrelated process attribute.

       Although this utility has use by system administrators (and in fact appears in the system  administration
       portion  of  the  BSD  documentation),  the  standard  developers  considered that it was very useful for
       individual end users to control their own processes.

       Earlier versions of this standard allowed the following forms in the SYNOPSIS:

           renice <u>nice_value</u><b>[</b>-p<b>]</b> <u>pid</u>...<b>[</b>-g <u>gid</u>...<b>][</b>-p <u>pid</u>...<b>][</b>-u <u>user</u>...<b>]</b>
           renice <u>nice_value</u> <u>-g</u> <u>gid</u>...<b>[</b>-g <u>gid</u>...<b>]</b>-p <u>pid</u>...<b>][</b>-u <u>user</u>...<b>]</b>
           renice <u>nice_value</u> <u>-u</u> <u>user</u>...<b>[</b>-g <u>gid</u>...<b>]</b>-p <u>pid</u>...<b>][</b>-u <u>user</u>...<b>]</b>

       These forms are no longer specified by POSIX.1‐2008 but may be present in some implementations.
