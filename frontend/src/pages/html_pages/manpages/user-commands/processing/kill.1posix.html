</pre><h4><b>PROLOG</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       kill — terminate or signal processes

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       kill -s <u>signal_name</u> <u>pid</u>...

       kill -l <b>[</b><u>exit_status</u><b>]</b>

       kill <b>[</b>-<u>signal_name</u><b>]</b> <u>pid</u>...

       kill <b>[</b>-<u>signal_number</u><b>]</b> <u>pid</u>...

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>kill</u> utility shall send a signal to the process or processes specified by each <u>pid</u> operand.

       For each <u>pid</u> operand, the <u>kill</u> utility shall perform actions equivalent to the <u>kill</u>() function defined in
       the System Interfaces volume of POSIX.1‐2017 called with the following arguments:

        *  The value of the <u>pid</u> operand shall be used as the <u>pid</u> argument.

        *  The  <u>sig</u> argument is the value specified by the <b>-s</b> option, <b>-</b><u>signal_number</u> option, or the <b>-</b><u>signal_name</u>
           option, or by SIGTERM, if none of these options is specified.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>kill</u> utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume  of  POSIX.1‐2017,  <u>Section</u>  <u>12.2</u>,  <u>Utility</u>
       <u>Syntax</u>  <u>Guidelines</u>,  except  that  in  the  last  two SYNOPSIS forms, the <b>-</b><u>signal_number</u> and <b>-</b><u>signal_name</u>
       options are usually more than a single character.

       The following options shall be supported:

       <b>-l</b>        (The letter ell.) Write all values of  <u>signal_name</u>  supported  by  the  implementation,  if  no
                 operand  is  given.  If  an  <u>exit_status</u>  operand  is given and it is a value of the <b>'?'</b>  shell
                 special parameter (see <u>Section</u> <u>2.5.2</u>, <u>Special</u> <u>Parameters</u> and <u>wait</u>) corresponding to  a  process
                 that  was  terminated  by a signal, the <u>signal_name</u> corresponding to the signal that terminated
                 the process shall be written. If an <u>exit_status</u> operand is given and it is the unsigned decimal
                 integer value of a signal number, the <u>signal_name</u> (the symbolic constant name without  the  <b>SIG</b>
                 prefix  defined  in  the  Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017) corresponding to that signal
                 shall be written. Otherwise, the results are unspecified.

       <b>-s</b> <u>signal_name</u>
                 Specify the signal to send, using one of the symbolic names defined in the  <u>&lt;signal.h&gt;</u>  header.
                 Values  of  <u>signal_name</u>  shall  be  recognized  in  a case-independent fashion, without the <b>SIG</b>
                 prefix. In addition, the symbolic name 0 shall be recognized,  representing  the  signal  value
                 zero. The corresponding signal shall be sent instead of SIGTERM.

       <b>-</b><u>signal_name</u>
                 Equivalent to <b>-s</b> <u>signal_name</u>.

       <b>-</b><u>signal_number</u>
                 Specify  a  non-negative  decimal  integer,  <u>signal_number</u>,  representing the signal to be used
                 instead of SIGTERM, as the <u>sig</u> argument in the effective call to  <u>kill</u>().   The  correspondence
                 between integer values and the <u>sig</u> value used is shown in the following list.

                 The effects of specifying any <u>signal_number</u> other than those listed below are undefined.

                 0     0

                 1     SIGHUP

                 2     SIGINT

                 3     SIGQUIT

                 6     SIGABRT

                 9     SIGKILL

                 14    SIGALRM

                 15    SIGTERM

                 If  the  first  argument  is  a  negative  integer, it shall be interpreted as a <b>-</b><u>signal_number</u>
                 option, not as a negative <u>pid</u> operand specifying a process group.

</pre><h4><b>OPERANDS</b></h4><pre>
       The following operands shall be supported:

       <u>pid</u>       One of the following:

                  1. A decimal integer specifying a process or process group to be  signaled.   The  process  or
                     processes  selected  by  positive, negative, and zero values of the <u>pid</u> operand shall be as
                     described for the <u>kill</u>() function. If process number 0 is specified, all processes  in  the
                     current  process  group shall be signaled. For the effects of negative <u>pid</u> numbers, see the
                     <u>kill</u>() function defined in the System Interfaces volume of POSIX.1‐2017. If the  first  <u>pid</u>
                     operand  is negative, it should be preceded by <b>"--"</b> to keep it from being interpreted as an
                     option.

                  2. A job control job ID (see the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <u>Section</u>  <u>3.204</u>,  <u>Job</u>
                     <u>Control</u>  <u>Job</u> <u>ID</u>) that identifies a background process group to be signaled. The job control
                     job ID notation is applicable only for invocations of <u>kill</u> in the current  shell  execution
                     environment; see <u>Section</u> <u>2.12</u>, <u>Shell</u> <u>Execution</u> <u>Environment</u>.

       <u>exit_status</u>
                 A  decimal  integer  specifying a signal number or the exit status of a process terminated by a
                 signal.

</pre><h4><b>STDIN</b></h4><pre>
       Not used.

</pre><h4><b>INPUT</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of <u>kill</u>:

       <u>LANG</u>      Provide a default value for the internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See the
                 Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <u>Section</u> <u>8.2</u>, <u>Internationalization</u>  <u>Variables</u>  for  the
                 precedence   of   internationalization  variables  used  to  determine  the  values  of  locale
                 categories.)

       <u>LC_ALL</u>    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values of all the  other  internationalization
                 variables.

       <u>LC_CTYPE</u>  Determine  the  locale  for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of text data as characters
                 (for example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments).

       <u>LC_MESSAGES</u>
                 Determine the locale that should be used to  affect  the  format  and  contents  of  diagnostic
                 messages written to standard error.

       <u>NLSPATH</u>   Determine the location of message catalogs for the processing of <u>LC_MESSAGES</u>.

</pre><h4><b>ASYNCHRONOUS</b> <b>EVENTS</b></h4><pre>
       Default.

</pre><h4><b>STDOUT</b></h4><pre>
       When the <b>-l</b> option is not specified, the standard output shall not be used.

       When  the  <b>-l</b>  option  is  specified,  the symbolic name of each signal shall be written in the following
       format:

           "%s%c", &lt;<u>signal_name</u>&gt;, &lt;<u>separator</u>&gt;

       where the &lt;<u>signal_name</u>&gt; is in uppercase, without the <b>SIG</b> prefix, and the &lt;<u>separator</u>&gt; shall  be  either  a
       &lt;newline&gt; or a &lt;space&gt;.  For the last signal written, &lt;<u>separator</u>&gt; shall be a &lt;newline&gt;.

       When  both  the  <b>-l</b>  option and <u>exit_status</u> operand are specified, the symbolic name of the corresponding
       signal shall be written in the following format:

           "%s\n", &lt;<u>signal_name</u>&gt;

</pre><h4><b>STDERR</b></h4><pre>
       The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.

</pre><h4><b>OUTPUT</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>EXTENDED</b> <b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       The following exit values shall be returned:

        0    At least one matching process was found  for  each  <u>pid</u>  operand,  and  the  specified  signal  was
             successfully processed for at least one matching process.

       &gt;0    An error occurred.

</pre><h4><b>CONSEQUENCES</b> <b>OF</b> <b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       Default.

       <u>The</u> <u>following</u> <u>sections</u> <u>are</u> <u>informative.</u>

</pre><h4><b>APPLICATION</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       Process numbers can be found by using <u>ps</u>.

       The  job  control  job  ID notation is not required to work as expected when <u>kill</u> is operating in its own
       utility execution environment. In either of the following examples:

           nohup kill %1 &amp;
           system("kill %1");

       the <u>kill</u> operates in a different environment and does not share the shell's understanding of job numbers.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Any of the commands:

           kill -9 100 -165
           kill -s kill 100 -165
           kill -s KILL 100 -165

       sends the SIGKILL signal to the process whose process ID is 100 and to all processes whose process  group
       ID  is  165,  assuming the sending process has permission to send that signal to the specified processes,
       and that they exist.

       The System Interfaces volume of POSIX.1‐2017 and this volume of  POSIX.1‐2017  do  not  require  specific
       signal numbers for any <u>signal_names</u>.  Even the <b>-</b><u>signal_number</u> option provides symbolic (although numeric)
       names  for  signals.  If  a  process is terminated by a signal, its exit status indicates the signal that
       killed it, but the exact values are not specified. The <u>kill</u> <b>-l</b>  option,  however,  can  be  used  to  map
       decimal  signal  numbers  and exit status values into the name of a signal. The following example reports
       the status of a terminated job:

           job
           stat=$?
           if [ $stat -eq 0 ]
           then
               echo job completed successfully.
           elif [ $stat -gt 128 ]
           then
               echo job terminated by signal SIG$(kill -l $stat).
           else
               echo job terminated with error code $stat.
           fi

       To send the default signal to a process group (say 123), an application should use a command  similar  to
       one of the following:

           kill -TERM -123
           kill -- -123

</pre><h4><b>RATIONALE</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>-l</b>  option originated from the C shell, and is also implemented in the KornShell. The C shell output
       can consist of multiple output lines because the signal names do not always fit on a single line on  some
       terminal  screens.  The  KornShell output also included the implementation-defined signal numbers and was
       considered by the standard developers to  be  too  difficult  for  scripts  to  parse  conveniently.  The
       specified  output  format  is intended not only to accommodate the historical C shell output, but also to
       permit an entirely vertical or entirely horizontal listing on systems for which this is appropriate.

       An early proposal invented the name SIGNULL as a <u>signal_name</u> for signal 0 (used by the System  Interfaces
       volume  of  POSIX.1‐2017  to  test for the existence of a process without sending it a signal). Since the
       <u>signal_name</u> 0 can be used in this case unambiguously, SIGNULL has been removed.

       An early proposal also required symbolic <u>signal_name</u>s to be recognized with or without  the  <b>SIG</b>  prefix.
       Historical versions of <u>kill</u> have not written the <b>SIG</b> prefix for the <b>-l</b> option and have not recognized the
       <b>SIG</b>  prefix on <u>signal_name</u>s.  Since neither applications portability nor ease-of-use would be improved by
       requiring this extension, it is no longer required.

       To avoid an ambiguity of an initial negative number argument specifying  either  a  signal  number  or  a
       process  group,  POSIX.1‐2008  mandates  that  it is always considered the former by implementations that
       support the XSI option. It also requires  that  conforming  applications  always  use  the  <b>"--"</b>  options
       terminator argument when specifying a process group, unless an option is also specified.

       The  <b>-s</b>  option was added in response to international interest in providing some form of <u>kill</u> that meets
       the Utility Syntax Guidelines.

       The job control job ID notation is not required to work as expected when <u>kill</u> is  operating  in  its  own
       utility execution environment. In either of the following examples:

           nohup kill %1 &amp;
           system("kill %1");

       the  <u>kill</u>  operates  in a different environment and does not understand how the shell has managed its job
       numbers.
