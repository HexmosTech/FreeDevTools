</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       mpitask - Monitor MPI processes under LAM.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>

       mpitask [-cdh] [-gps] [nodes] [processes]

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-c</b>      Print communicator descriptions.  See "Communicators".

       <b>-d</b>      Print datatype descriptions.  See "Datatypes".

       <b>-gps</b>    Print process information in GPS format.

       <b>-h</b>      Print useful information on this command.

       The -c and -d options are mutually exclusive.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>mpitask</u> command displays information on processes which are using MPI.  One line is printed for each
       reported MPI process.  With no processes or nodes explicitly specified  on  the  command  line,  all  MPI
       processes on all nodes are reported.

       % mpitask
       TASK (G/L)    FUNCTION   PEER|ROOT   TAG   COMM    COUNT   DATATYPE
       0/0 trivial   Ssend      1/1         123   WORLD   64      INT
       1/1 trivial   Recv       0/0         456   WORLD   64      INT

       For each process <u>mpitask</u> normally prints the following information:

       TASK      an identification of the process - If the process is currently communicating, a `/' followed by
                 the  process's rank within the current communicator is also displayed.  The executable name, if
                 available, is also displayed.  See "MPI Process Identification".

       FUNCTION  an abbreviated form of the function name if the process is blocked inside  an  MPI  function  -
                 Otherwise one of the following execution states is printed:

                 running   free to run on the underlying OS

                 paused    blocked on <a href="../man2/lam_kpause.2.html">lam_kpause</a>(2)

                 stopped   stopped by the LAM signal, LAM_SIGARREST - See <a href="../man1/doom.1.html">doom</a>(1).

                 blocked   blocked  in  a  LAM function - In general this should be a transitory state.  Further
                           information on a LAM process's state can be obtained with <a href="../man1/state.1.html">state</a>(1).

       PEER|ROOT the source or destination of a point-to-point communication or the root process of certain col‐
                 lective communications, followed by a '/' and the process's rank within the current  communica‐
                 tor -

       TAG       the message tag, if any, which was specified as a parameter to the current MPI function

       COMM      the  communicator  ID, if any, which was specified as a parameter to the current MPI function -
                 Communicators used in collective calls are displayed with a * suffix.  Further  information  on
                 the communicator may be obtained with the -c option.

       COUNT     the element count, if any, which was specified as a parameter to the current MPI function

       DATATYPE  the  element datatype, if any, which was specified as a parameter to the current MPI function -
                 For intrinsic datatypes, a shortened version of the datatype name is  displayed.   For  derived
                 datatypes,  a datatype label is displayed.  Further information on the datatype may be obtained
                 with the -d option.

   <b>MPI</b> <b>Process</b> <b>Identification</b>
       By default, MPI processes are identified by their rank in MPI_COMM_WORLD.  We refer  to  this  rank  more
       concisely  as  the "global" rank (G).  The rank within the currently employed communicator is referred to
       as the "local" rank (L).

       Since processes may be dynamically spawned (see <a href="../man2/MPIL_Spawn.2.html">MPIL_Spawn</a>(2)) and since multiple concurrent MPI applica‐
       tions are allowed, it is possible for multiple MPI_COMM_WORLD communicators to coexist.  In these  situa‐
       tions,  the global rank is no longer globally unique and the identification is ambiguous.  Thus, LAM pro‐
       vides an alternate way of identifying MPI processes, the GPS (Global Positioning  System).   A  process's
       GPS  consists  of  the  nodeid the process is running on and the process's LAM index on that node.  It is
       displayed in <u>mpitask</u> as the pair nnode,iindex.  If the -gps option is given then the GPS  is  substituted
       for the global rank (G).

   <b>Communicators</b>
       If  the  -c  option  is  given then information is no longer displayed in the horizontal format described
       above.  Instead for each selected process currently using a communicator, the information from  the  TASK
       column, described above, is given followed by an expanded description of the communicator.  This descrip‐
       tion  includes  the  size  of  the communicator group(s) and the global identifiers of all members of the
       group(s).

   <b>Datatypes</b>
       If the -d option is given then information is no longer displayed  in  the  horizontal  format  described
       above.   Instead  for each selected process currently using a communicator, the information from the TASK
       column, described above, is given followed by the datatype's type map.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       mpitask
           Display the status of all MPI processes on all nodes.

       mpitask -c n0 i9
           Display the communicator (if any) of process index 9 on node 0.

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       If no MPI processes are found, only the title line is displayed.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Sometimes processes may be shown as blocked inside a non-blocking MPI function.   This  occurs  when  the
       process  is blocked inside the MPI function on some internal LAM event.  Such states are highly transito‐
       ry.
