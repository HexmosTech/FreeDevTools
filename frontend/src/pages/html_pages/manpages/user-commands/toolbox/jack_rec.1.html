       jack_rec - JACK toolkit client for recording audio

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>jack_rec</b> -f filename -d seconds [ -b bitdepth ] port1 [ port2 ... ]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>jack_rec</b>  <b>is</b>  <b>a</b>  <b>basic,</b>  <b>but</b> <b>useful,</b> <b>audio</b> <b>recorder</b> <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>record</b> audio from 1 or more JACK ports to a
       file on disk. The file format is always RIFF/WAV, with samples stored as signed integers. The sample  bit
       depth  can  be  selected  using  the  <u>-b</u>  option.  The file will have as many channels as there are ports
       specified on the command line - each channel will contain the data  recorded  from  one  port.  The  user
       should  generally  specify the duration (in seconds) using the <u>-d</u> option. If not specified, jack_rec will
       record until terminated by a signal (eg. from Ctrl-c).

       This application is not intended to be a heavy duty audio recorder, and originated as an  example  client
       to  show  how to handle threading and disk I/O in a JACK client. However, it is a useful, simple recorder
       and is included in the JACK toolkit as a result.
