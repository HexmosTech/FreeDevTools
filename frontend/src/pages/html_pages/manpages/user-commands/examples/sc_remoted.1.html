       sc_remoted — interact with a collection of remotely controlled scamper instances

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>sc_remoted</b>  [<b>-?46D</b>]  [<b>-O</b>  <u>options</u>] [<b>-P</b> <u>[ip:]port</u>] [<b>-U</b> <u>directory</u>] [<b>-c</b> <u>tls-certificate</u>] [<b>-p</b> <u>tls-privatekey</u>]
                  [<b>-e</b> <u>pidfile</u>] [<b>-Z</b> <u>zombie-time</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>sc_remoted</b> utility provides the ability to connect to a  <u><a href="../man1/scamper.1.html">scamper</a></u>(1)  instance  running  remotely  and
       interact with it by issuing commands and receiving results in warts format.  The options are as follows:

       <b>-</b>?      prints a list of command line options and a synopsis of each.

       <b>-D</b>      causes <b>sc_remoted</b> to operate as a daemon.

       <b>-4</b>      causes <b>sc_remoted</b> to only listen for IPv4-based connections.

       <b>-6</b>      causes <b>sc_remoted</b> to only listen for IPv6-based connections.

       <b>-O</b> <u>options</u>
               allows  the  behavior  of <b>sc_remoted</b> to be further tailored.  The current choices for this option
               are:
                 <b>-</b>  <b>allowgroup:</b> allow members of the unix domain socket's group to access  to  the  unix  domain
                    sockets created by <b>sc_remoted</b>
                 <b>-</b>  <b>allowother:</b>  allow  anyone  on  the  system  access  to  the  unix domain sockets created by
                    <b>sc_remoted</b>
                 <b>-</b>  <b>debug:</b> print debugging messages
                 <b>-</b>  <b>select:</b> use <u><a href="../man2/select.2.html">select</a></u>(2) with all sockets, rather than <u><a href="../man2/epoll.2.html">epoll</a></u>(2) or <u><a href="../man2/kqueue.2.html">kqueue</a></u>(2)

       <b>-P</b> <u>[ip:]port</u>
               specifies the IP address and port on the local host where <b>sc_remoted</b> should listen  for  incoming
               connections.   If  an  IP  address  is  not specified, <b>sc_remoted</b> will listen on all available IP
               addresses for incoming connections.

       <b>-U</b> <u>directory</u>
               specifies the directory on the local host where unix domain sockets corresponding to remote hosts
               should be placed.

       <b>-c</b> <u>tls-certificate</u>
               specifies the server certificate file in PEM format to advertise to remote <u><a href="../man1/scamper.1.html">scamper</a></u>(1) instances.

       <b>-p</b> <u>tls-privatekey</u>
               specifies the private key file in PEM format that corresponds to the certificate file.  This  key
               should have a passphrase.  <b>sc_remoted</b> will prompt for the passphrase when starting up.

       <b>-e</b> <u>pidfile</u>
               specifies the name of a file to write the process ID to.

       <b>-Z</b> <u>zombie-time</u>
               specifies the length of time <b>sc_remoted</b> will retain state for a disconnected <u><a href="../man1/scamper.1.html">scamper</a></u>(1) instance,
               allowing it to resume.  By default <b>sc_remoted</b> retains state for 15 minutes.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       The intended use of the remote control socket built into <u><a href="../man1/scamper.1.html">scamper</a></u>(1) is as follows.  A central server with
       IP  addresses  192.0.2.1 and 2001:db8::1 runs a <b>sc_remoted</b> process listening on a port for remote scamper
       process, placing control sockets in a specified directory:

             <b>sc_remoted</b> <b>-P</b> <b>31337</b> <b>-U</b> <b>scamper-remote-sockets</b>

       Then, a remote host with IP address 198.51.100.55 runs scamper and connects to the remote controller:

             <b>scamper</b> <b>-R</b> <b>192.0.2.1:31337</b>

       The <b>sc_remoted</b> process places a unix domain socket in the directory corresponding to the remote  process.
       The name corresponds to the source IP address and port the remote scamper process connected to controller
       with.  If the scamper process used source port 1025, then the unix domain socket's name will be

             <b>scamper-remote-sockets/198.51.100.55:1025</b>

       If  a  second  remote  host  with  IP  address  2001:db8:1234::1  runs scamper and connects to the remote
       controller:

             <b>scamper</b> <b>-R</b> <b>[2001:db8::1]:31337</b>

       The same <b>sc_remoted</b> process will place another unix domain socket in the directory corresponding  to  the
       remote process.  If the scamper process used source port 1026, then the unix domain socket's name will be

             <b>scamper-remote-sockets/2001:db8:1234::1.1026</b>

</pre><h4><b>USING</b> <b>TRANSPORT</b> <b>LAYER</b> <b>SECURITY</b></h4><pre>
       <b>sc_remoted</b>  and  scamper  support the use of transport layer security (TLS) using OpenSSL to authenticate
       and encrypt communications between <b>sc_remoted</b> and  scamper.   To  use  this  support  requires  a  public
       certificate  signed  by  a  certificate  authority.   Scamper  will  verify  the certificate presented by
       <b>sc_remoted</b> and disconnect if the certificate presented by <b>sc_remoted</b> cannot be validated.

       Generating a certificate that will be accepted by scamper requires you to create  a  certificate  request
       and  pass  it  for signing to a certificate authority.  To generate a private key in file remotepriv.pem,
       and a request to sign the key in remotereq.pem:

             <b>openssl</b> <b>req</b> <b>-new</b> <b>-keyout</b> <b>remotepriv.pem</b> <b>-out</b> <b>remotereq.pem</b>

       and  then  send  the  remotereq.pem  file  to  the  certificate  authority  for  signing.   Do  not  send
       remotepriv.pem;  that  key  must  remain private to you.  When openssl prompts for a passphrase, choose a
       passphrase that is unique and keep the passphrase secret.  When your chosen certificate  authority  signs
       your  private  key,  it  will  return  a file which we will call remotecert.pem.  Both remotecert.pem and
       remotepriv.pem are required parameters to <b>sc_remoted</b> to enable TLS support:

             <b>sc_remoted</b> <b>-P</b> <b>31337</b> <b>-U</b> <b>scamper-remote-sockets</b> <b>-c</b> <b>remotecert.pem</b> <b>-p</b> <b>remotepriv.pem</b>

       and then passing the -O tls option to scamper:

             <b>scamper</b> <b>-R</b> <b>example.com:31337</b> <b>-O</b> <b>tls</b>

</pre><h4><b>SIGNAL</b> <b>HANDLERS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>sc_remoted</b> installs handlers for two signals: SIGINT  and  SIGHUP.   SIGINT  causes  <b>sc_remoted</b>  to  exit
       gracefully.  SIGHUP causes <b>sc_remoted</b> to reload the TLS certificate and private key, without interrupting
       existing TLS connections.
