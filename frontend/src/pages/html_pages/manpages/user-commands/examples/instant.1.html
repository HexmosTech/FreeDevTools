       instant - manipulates ESIS from parsed SGML instance

</pre><h4><b>Synopsis</b></h4><pre>
       <b>instant</b> [ <b>-bhuvxHISW</b> ]  [ <b>-t</b> <u>file</u>]  [ <b>-s</b> <u>file</u>]  [ <b>-c</b> <u>file</u>]  [ <b>-o</b> <u>file</u>]  [ <b>-D</b> <u>variable</u><b>=</b><u>value</u> ...]  [ <b>-i</b>
       <u>id</u>]  [ <b>-l</b> <u>directory</u>]  [<u>file</u>]

</pre><h4><b>Description</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>instant</b>  program  manipulates  an SGML document instance in a variety of ways, including translating
       into a form suitable for a formatting application and printing information about this instance.  Input to
       <b>instant</b> is the output of <b>onsgmls</b>, whose format is called Element Structure Information Set (ESIS).

</pre><h4><b>Flags</b></h4><pre>
       The following are the possible command line options to <b>instant</b>. Output is sent to  the  standard  output,
       except where otherwise noted.

       <b>-t</b> <u>file</u>
              Translate  the  SGML instance to another form, usually suitable for a formatting application.  The
              <u>file</u> is called a translation spec, which  specifies  how  the  tags  are  to  be  translated.  See
              <b><a href="../man5/transpec.5.html">transpec</a></b>(5).  By convention, names for <u>file</u> use the suffix <b>.ts</b>, for <u>translation</u> <u>spec</u>.

       <b>-s</b> <u>file</u>
              Specifies  a  file  of  mappings  for SDATA entities in the instance.  The file is of two columns,
              separated by one or more tabs.  Spaces can <u>not</u>  be  used  as  the  separator  because  spaces  are
              allowable  as  the content of the columns.  The first column is the entity data to map, the second
              is the string that the data is mapped to.  The entity data is typically what is  found  in  public
              ISO  entity sets, such as the General Technical and Publishing sets.  The mappings are specific to
              the formatting application used.  For example, to map  the  em  dash  entity,  <b>[mdash</b>  <b>]</b>,  in  the
              Publishing set to the TeX representation, the first column would be <b>[mdash</b> <b>]</b> and the second column
              <b>---</b>.  Lines beginning with a <b>#</b> are comments, and are ignored. Empty lines are also ignored.

       <b>-c</b> <u>file</u>
              Specifies  a  file of string mappings for characters in the instance.  The file is of two columns,
              separated by white space.  The first is the character to map, the second is the  string  that  the
              character  is  mapped  to.   The  mappings are specific to the formatting application used.  Lines
              beginning with a <b>#</b> are comments, and are ignored. Empty lines are also ignored.

       <b>-d</b>     strip newline at the beginning of data records

       <b>-f</b> <u>length</u>
              Set the threshold for the length, in characters, of an &lt;Entry&gt;, over which it is called a block of
              filled text, to <u>length</u>.

       <b>-o</b> <u>file</u>
              Write all output (except error and warning messages) to file <u>file</u>.  By  default,  output  goes  to
              stdout.

       <b>-h</b>     Print  a  text representation of the hierarchy of the instance elements.  The deeper an element is
              in the tree, the more it is indented. The data content is not printed.

       <b>-u</b>     Print a summary of the usage  of  each  element  in  the  instance.   Information  given  includes
              attributes, number of children, and depth in the hierarchy.

       <b>-S</b>     Print  some  statistics  about  element usage in the instance, including how often each element is
              used and how much PCDATA is contained.

       <b>-x</b>     Print the context of each element in the instance, from each element to the root of  the  document
              tree.

       <b>-v</b>     Validate  the  SGML instance based on the set of constraints or descriptions in the transpec file.
              This flags tells <b>instant</b> to turn off normal output, leaving only diagnostics.

       <b>-l</b> <u>directory</u>
              Try to read the translation specs or other files from in the directory <u>directory</u> if not  found  in
              the  current  directory.   This is called the library directory.  The environment variable <u>TPT_LIB</u>
              may also be used to specify this.

       <b>-b</b>     Interactive browser mode. The user is  prompted  for  actions,  which  include  moving  among  and
              examining  the  various nodes in the hierarchy of the instance, displaying information about them,
              etc.

       <b>-I</b>     List the IDs of all elements in the instance that have an ID.  The format  is  more  suitable  for
              other  programs  than  humans.   Lines  show  the ID, element GI, filename, and line, separated by
              colons.  (This depends on the <b>-l</b> option to <b>onsgmls</b> which provide filenames and line numbers.)

       <b>-i</b> <u>id</u>  When translating the instance, begin processing at the element whose  ID  is  <u>id</u>  instead  of  the
              topmost element.

       <b>-D</b> <u>variable</u><b>=</b><u>value</u>
              Define the variable <u>variable</u> with value <u>value</u>.

       <b>-W</b>     Do not print warning messages.

       <b>-H</b>     Print a help message briefly describing the options.

       <u>file</u>   Read  the  instance from the file <u>file</u>.  This is expected to be the output of the program <b>onsgmls</b>.
              If not specified, <b>instant</b> reads the instance from its standard input.

       In some cases it makes no sense to combine options.  This is especially true if one of the options is  to
       perform a translation. No checking is done for this.

</pre><h4><b>Interactive</b> <b>Browser</b></h4><pre>
       These are the commands to the interactive browser:

       <b>cd</b> <u>args</u> <u>...</u>
              Change  to  a different element in the hierarchy.  <b>cd</b> <b>id</b> <u>id</u> will change to the element whose ID is
              <u>id</u>.  <b>cd</b> <u>N</u> will change to the <u>N</u>th child element of the current element.  Several values of <u>N</u> may be
              specified, so the program will change to successively descending elements in the  hierarchy.   The
              string  <b>..</b> may appear for <u>N</u> to move up a level in the hierarchy (like in a unix file system).  A <b>/</b>
              may be specified for <u>N</u> to change to the top of the hierarchy.

       <b>cont</b>   Print the context of each element.

       <b>data</b> <u>N</u> Show the data content (PCDATA, RCDATA, and DATA) of child node N.

       <b>find</b> <u>spec</u>
              Find paths to elements matching <u>spec</u>, where <u>spec</u> may be one of:

              <b>parent</b> <u>gi</u>
                     Find all elements whose parent element is <u>gi</u>.

              <b>child</b> <u>gi</u>
                     Find all elements which have a child element <u>gi</u>.

              <b>gi</b> <u>gi</u>  Find all elements whose name is <u>gi</u>.

              <b>attr</b> <u>name</u> <u>value</u>
                     Find all elements that have a attribute <u>name</u> that have a value <u>value</u>.

       <b>id</b> <u>ID</u>  Show location of element whose ID is <u>ID</u>.  If <u>ID</u> is <b>?</b>, it will list all IDs with the paths to them.

       <b>ls</b>     List information about the current element in the hierarchy.  This  includes  element  name,  line
              number  in  instance,  context,  attributes and their values, child elements, data directly within
              this element, and the order of the current element among its siblings.

       <b>q</b> <u>relation</u> <u>element</u>
              Report whether or not the current element has the relation <u>relation</u> to the named element  <u>element</u>.
              Values of <u>relation</u> are the same as for <b>_followrel</b> in <b>transpec</b> reference page.

       <b>stat</b>   Show statistics about the hierarchy.

       <b>sum</b>    Show a tag usage summary about the hierarchy.

       <b>tran</b> <u>transpec</u> <u>outfile</u>
              Write  translated  output using trans spec <u>transpec</u> to file <u>outfile</u>.  If <u>outfile</u> is not specified,
              output is sent to stdout.

       <b>tree</b>   Print a textual representation of the  hierarchy  of  the  instance,  where  deeper  elements  are
              indented more.

       <b>where</b>  Show current position in the hierarchy.

       &lt;<b>control-D</b>&gt;
              Exits the program.

       The  <b>stat</b>,  <b>sum</b>,  <b>tree</b>, <b>cont</b> commands take an optional first argument (of any value), which means to only
       consider the entire instance instead of the hierarchy from the current element.
