   <b>1.1.</b> <b>About</b> <b>this</b> <b>Document.</b>
       This  document  is  an  ever  growing  set of questions, statements, ideas and complaints about AfterStep
       version 2.0.

       You can get this FAQ at the following locations: <a href="http://www.afterstep.org/">http://www.afterstep.org/</a>

       The rest of this document assumes you are running  AfterStep  2.0.  If  you  are  running  a  version  of
       AfterStep prior to version 2.0, this document will suggests only one thing: upgrade.

   <b>1.2.</b> <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>AfterStep?</b>
       AfterStep  is  a  Window  Manager for the X Window System (hereafter referred to as X). It was started to
       emulate the look and feel of NeXTSTEP(tm), but has evolved into something that while still being able  to
       emulate  NeXT,  can  do much much more. Without using much memory or cpu time, AfterStep provides all the
       features one could want in a Window Manager.

   <b>1.3.</b> <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>AfterStep's</b> <b>history?</b>
       Original AfterStep was a continuation of the BowMan Window Manager which was originally put  together  by
       Bo  Yang.  BowMan  was based on the fvwm Window Manager, written by Robert Nation. Fvwm was based on code
       from twm. And so on....

       Idea was to emulate some of the look and feel of the NEXTSTEP(tm) user interface, but overtime it evolved
       to include other concepts, as dictated by end user needs. It is that unholy direction that  made  Alfredo
       Kojima  abandon project in 1997 and create a Window Manger of its own - Window Maker, which had a goal of
       strict adherance to NEXTSTEP interface ideas.

       After releasing version 1.8.11 it became aparent for developers that old AfterStep codebase  had  reached
       its  limits  and  required  a substantial redesign. Such redesign began with development of radically new
       image handling library libAfterImage, introducing high quality  image  manipulation,  blending,  TrueType
       fonts, XML image scripting, and more. Building off of libAfterImage and incorporating new developments in
       X  Window  management,  AfterStep  2.0 was born and released in September, 2004. As of now AfterStep code
       base contains none of the original fvwm parts, and association to fvwm, twm and  BowMan  remain  only  in
       history.

   <b>1.4.</b> <b>Fine,</b> <b>what</b> <b>if</b> <b>I'm</b> <b>not</b> <b>running</b> <b>AfterStep</b> <b>2.0?</b> <b>Is</b> <b>there</b> <b>a</b> <b>FAQ</b> <b>for</b> <b>me?</b>
       Yes.  There  should  be  a  version  of  the  AfterStep  FAQ  available  within  your  specific AfterStep
       distribution. If you are using a version earlier than 2.0, it is strongly suggested you upgrade.

   <b>1.5.</b> <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>X?</b> <b>What</b> <b>are</b> <b>these</b> <b>window</b> <b>managers</b> <b>?</b>
       "X" is shorthand for The X Window System. It is a basis for building graphical user interfaces  for  UNIX
       (it  is  available  for  non-UNIX  systems,  but wasn't designed to be as such). "X" is not the interface
       itself, just a foundation for one. For more information, check www.x.org .

       A Window Manager is a program that manages your windows during your X session. AfterStep is one  of  many
       available window managers .

   <b>1.6.</b> <b>What</b> <b>are</b> <b>AfterStep's</b> <b>main</b> <b>features?</b>
       The Wharf
              Similar  to NeXTSTEP's(tm) Dock, it allows applications to be Swallowed, shortcuts with icons, and
              many other things.

       The Pager
              Shows a miniature view of the Afterstep desktops, you can move  between  them,  and  move  windows
              around in the Pager as though it were a miniature desktop.

       The WinList
              A  list  of  all the windows, clicking on the items can show that window, destroy it, shade it, or
              anything you might want.

       Configurability
              Almost anything can be changed.

       XML image scripting
              AfterStep allows XML scripts to be used to assemble complex images for things like buttons,  frame
              sides, etc, from other, simpler images or graphical primitives.

       TrueType fonts support
              Antialised TrueType fonts could be used to render window titles and other labels.

       Unicode, UTF8 and other encodings support
              Most international character encodings are supported as long as fonts provide glyphs.

       ColorSchemes
              AfterStep  can  calculate  a  set  of  about  34  colors  to  create  looks  with harmonious color
              composition.

   <b>1.7.</b> <b>Is</b> <b>AfterStep</b> <b>2.0</b> <b>GNOME</b> <b>and/or</b> <b>KDE</b> <b>compliant?</b>
       AfterStep 2.0 supports Extended Window Manager Hints, ICCCM protocol and Motif hints, thus making  it  as
       compatible as possible with both GNOME and KDE, as well as most other X applications.

   <b>1.8.</b> <b>Can</b> <b>I</b> <b>run</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>Microsoft</b> <b>Windows(tm)?</b>
       AfterStep  2.0  does run under Windows using CYGWIN compatibility layer, while running any X server. Some
       of the X servers available under Windows  allow  so-called  root-less  mode,  where  X  applications  can
       coincide with native applications. See sample screenshot .

   <b>1.9.</b> <b>Who</b> <b>develops</b> <b>AfterStep?</b>
       Sasha Vasko &lt;sasha at aftercode.net&gt;
              coordinator, coder, web designer, carpenter, and everything else ( at the moment ).

</pre><h4><b>3.</b> <b>Getting</b> <b>and</b> <b>Installing</b> <b>AfterStep</b> <b>2.0</b></h4><pre>
   <b>3.1.</b> <b>Where</b> <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>AfterStep</b> <b>2.0?</b>
       You can download AfterStep 2.0 at any of the following locations:
        <a href="ftp://ftp.afterstep.org/stable/">ftp://ftp.afterstep.org/stable/</a>  SourceForge.net  RPM packages

   <b>3.2.</b> <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>compile</b> <b>and</b> <b>install</b> <b>AfterStep?</b>
       Because AfterStep is an X application, you need to have X installed,  and  the  X  development  libraries
       (note,  in  this  case "development" means libraries need to compile things with X, not development level
       code). It's probably a good idea to also have a working C compiler.

       AfterStep includes some image libraries, but it is recommended that you  install  those  libraries  using
       your  distribution's package management system. Note that you will need development libraries in addition
       to run-time libraries. The following are the libraries that AfterStep can take advantage of :  libJPEG  -
       support for JPEG image format

       libPNG - support for PNG image format

       libTIFF - support for TIFF image format

       Freetype - support for TrueType fonts

       Note that following image format do not require any external libraries : XPM, PPM, BMP, ICO, XCF, GIF.

   <b>3.3.</b> <b>Can</b> <b>I</b> <b>install</b> <b>AfterStep</b> <b>without</b> <b>being</b> <b>root?</b>
       Yes, before compiling AfterStep, do this:

           mkdir <a href="file:~/bin">~/bin</a> mkdir -p <a href="file:~/man/man1">~/man/man1</a> ./configure --prefix ~/

       Then follow the normal install directions, allowing you to
           make install
       without being root.

   <b>3.4.</b> <b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>upgrade</b> <b>AfterStep</b> <b>from</b> <b>AfterStep</b> <b>version</b> <b>prior</b> <b>to</b> <b>2.0.0?</b>
       Install  AfterStep  2.0  and then run it. It will start with default configuration that you may or maynot
       like. If you wish to try and reuse your old configuration files,  then  copy  them  over  from  your  old
       <a href="file:~/GNUstep/Library/AfterStep/">~/GNUstep/Library/AfterStep/</a>  directory  and  into  <a href="file:~/.afterstep/.">~/.afterstep/.</a>  Restart  AfterStep  to  make  changes
       effective. If some of the features do not work quite right - feel free to submit bug  report  along  with
       your configuration files.

       It  is recommended though that you start with default configuration and try out all of the supplied looks
       and color schemes. Select whichever is close to what you want and then modify it to  your  liking.  These
       approach will allow you to take advantage of many new features, available in AfterStep 2.0.

   <b>3.4.</b> <b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>upgrade</b> <b>AfterStep</b> <b>from</b> <b>AfterStep</b> <b>version</b> <b>higher</b> <b>then</b> <b>2.0.0?</b>
       Make sure that all configuration files that you ever changed are in your home directory at <a href="file:~/.afterstep/">~/.afterstep/</a>,
       as  installing  afterstep will replace everything in global shared location (/usr/local/share/afterstep).
       Install afterstep and run. You should not have any trouble.

   <b>3.5.</b> <b>What's</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>compile</b> <b>errors?</b>
       Most likely, you don't have the X devel package (should have come with your  operating  system,  if  not,
       check <a href="http://www.x.org/">http://www.x.org/</a> ).

   <b>3.6.</b> <b>How</b> <b>the</b> <b>hell</b> <b>does</b> <b>one</b> <b>configure</b> <b>AfterStep?</b>
       Configuration  files are usually either in <a href="file:/usr">/usr</a>(/local)/share/afterstep for system wide configuration and
       <a href="file:~/.afterstep">~/.afterstep</a> for personal settings.

       Configuration is handled in multiple files: look file (in looks subdirectory) for visual attributes, feel
       file (in feels subdirectory) for the general behaviour; wharf, winlist, banner, pager, animate for module
       specific configuration.

       Just copy any file you want to modify over from <a href="file:/usr">/usr</a>(/local)/share/afterstep to <a href="file:~/.afterstep">~/.afterstep</a> to  override
       system wide defaults retaining subdirectory layout.
