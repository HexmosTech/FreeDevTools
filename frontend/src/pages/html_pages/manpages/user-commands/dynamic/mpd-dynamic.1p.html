</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       mpd-dynamic - a dynamic playlist for mpd

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 2.004

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This program implements a dynamic playlist for MPD, build on top of the Audio::MPD perl module.

       MPD (music player daemon) is a cool music player, but it lacks a dynamic playlist. A dynamic playlist is
       a playlist that will change automatically over time. In particular, it will remove already played songs
       (keeping at most a given number of songs) and add new songs to the playlist so it never fall short of
       songs.

       Note that since mpd is a daemon needing no gui to work, "mpd-dynamic" is also a daemon. That is, it will
       fork and do all its work from the background.  This way, you can fire "mpd" and "mpd-dynamic" and forget
       completely about your music (especially since "mpd-dynamic" is a low-resource program): it will just be
       there! :-)

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
           mpd-dynamic [options]

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>General</b> <b>behaviour</b>
       You can customize the usage of mpd-dynamic with the following options:

       -o[ld] &lt;old&gt;
           Number of old tracks to keep in the backlog. Defaults to 10.

       -n[ew] &lt;new&gt;
           Number of new tracks to keep in the to-be-played playlist. Defaults to 10.

       -s[leep] &lt;sleep&gt;
           Time spent sleeping (in seconds) before checking if playlist should be updated. Default to 5 seconds.

       -d[ebug]
           Run  mpd-dynamic  in  debug  mode.  In  particular, the program will not daemonize itself. Default to
           false.

       -e[ncoding] &lt;encoding&gt;
           Print debug messages with this encoding. Since mpd-dynamic is meant  to  be  a  silent  daemon,  this
           option will not be used outside of debug mode. Default to "utf-8".

       --version
       --usage
       --help
       --man
           Print the usual program information

       Note  however  that  those flags are optional: since "mpd-dynamic" comes with some sane defaults, you can
       fire "mpd-dynamic" as is.

   <b>Ratings</b>
       You can also take advantage of ratings if you want. With those options, songs need to  have  at  least  a
       given rating (or no rating yet) to be inserted: this way, you will only listen to your favorite songs!

       Ratings can be created / updated with "mpd-rate".

       Note  that  if  you  supply  a  non-existant  rating  db-file,  the rating mechanism will be ignored. The
       following options control the rating mechanism:

       -r[atings] &lt;ratings&gt;
           The path of a db file with the ratings per song. The keys are the song path (relative to  MPD  root),
           and the value is an integer (the rating). Default to "<a href="file:~/.mpd/ratings.db">~/.mpd/ratings.db</a>".

       -m[in[imum]] &lt;min&gt;
           The minimum rating for a song to be inserted in the playlist. Default to 4.
