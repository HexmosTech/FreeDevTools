       delta - syntax-highlighting pager for git, diff, and grep output

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>delta</b> [<u>OPTIONS</u>] [<u>MINUS_FILE</u>] [<u>PLUS_FILE</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       A viewer for git and diff output

   <b>Arguments:</b>
              [MINUS_FILE]

              First file to be compared when delta is being used to diff two files.

              `delta file1 file2` is equivalent to `diff <b>-u</b> file1 file2 | delta`.

              [PLUS_FILE]

              Second file to be compared when delta is being used to diff two files

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>

       <b>--blame-code-style</b> &lt;STYLE&gt;

              Style string for the code section of a git blame line.

              By  default the code will be syntax-highlighted with the same background color as the blame format
              section of the line (the background color is  determined  by  blame-palette).  E.g.  setting  this
              option to 'syntax' will syntax-highlight the code with no background color.

       <b>--blame-format</b> &lt;FMT&gt;

              Format string for git blame commit metadata.

              Available placeholders are "{timestamp}", "{author}", and "{commit}".

              [default: "{timestamp:&lt;15} {author:&lt;15.14} {commit:&lt;8}"]

       <b>--blame-palette</b> &lt;COLORS&gt;

              Background colors used for git blame lines (space-separated string).

              Lines added by the same commit are painted with the same color; colors are recycled as needed.

       <b>--blame-separator-format</b> &lt;FMT&gt;

              Separator between the blame format and the code section of a git blame line.

              Contains  the  line  number  by  default.  Possible values are "none" to disable line numbers or a
              format string. This may contain one "{n:}" placeholder and will display the line number  on  every
              line.   A type may be added after all other format specifiers and can be separated by '_': If type
              is set to 'block' (e.g. "{n:^4_block}") the line number will only be shown when a new blame  block
              starts;  or  if  it  is  set  to  'every-N'  the line will be show with every block and every N-th
              (modulo) line.

              [default: ???{n:^4}???]

       <b>--blame-separator-style</b> &lt;STYLE&gt;

              Style string for the blame-separator-format

       <b>--blame-timestamp-format</b> &lt;FMT&gt;

              Format of `git blame` timestamp in raw git output received by delta

              [default: "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S %z"]

       <b>--blame-timestamp-output-format</b> &lt;FMT&gt;

              Format string for git blame timestamp output.

              This string is used for formatting the  timestamps  in  git  blame  output.  It  must  follow  the
              `strftime` format syntax specification.  If it is not present, the timestamps will be formatted in
              a human-friendly but possibly less accurate form.

              See: &lt;https://docs.rs/chrono/latest/chrono/format/strftime/index.html&gt;

       <b>--color-only</b>

              Do not alter the input structurally in any way.

              But  color and highlight hunk lines according to your delta configuration. This is mainly intended
              for other tools that use delta.

       <b>--config</b> &lt;PATH&gt;

              Load the config file at PATH instead of <a href="file:~/.gitconfig">~/.gitconfig</a>

              [default: ]

       <b>--commit-decoration-style</b> &lt;STYLE&gt;

              Style string for the commit hash decoration.

              See STYLES section. The style string should contain one of  the  special  attributes  'box',  'ul'
              (underline), 'ol' (overline), or the combination 'ul ol'.

              [default: ]

       <b>--commit-regex</b> &lt;REGEX&gt;

              Regular expression used to identify the commit line when parsing git output

              [default: "^commit "]

       <b>--commit-style</b> &lt;STYLE&gt;

              Style string for the commit hash line.

              See STYLES section. The style 'omit' can be used to remove the commit hash line from the output.

              [default: raw]

       <b>--dark</b>

              Use default colors appropriate for a dark terminal background.

              For more control, see the style options and <b>--syntax-theme</b>.

       <b>--default-language</b> &lt;LANG&gt;

              Default language used for syntax highlighting.

              Used  as  a  fallback when the language cannot be inferred from a filename. It will typically make
              sense to set this in the per-repository config file '.git/config'.

              [default: txt]

       <b>--detect-dark-light</b> &lt;DETECT_DARK_LIGHT&gt;

              Detect whether or not the terminal is dark or light by querying for its colors.

              Ignored if either `--dark` or `--light` is specified.

              Querying the terminal for its colors requires "exclusive" access since delta reads/writes from the
              terminal and enables/disables raw mode. This causes race conditions with pagers such as less  when
              they are attached to the same terminal as delta.

              This is usually only an issue when the output is manually piped to a pager. For example: `git diff
              | delta | less`. Otherwise, if delta starts the pager itself, then there's no race condition since
              the pager is started *after* the color is detected.

              `auto` tries to account for these situations by testing if the output is redirected.

              The   `--color-only`   option   is   treated   as   an   indicator   that   delta   is   used   as
              `interactive.diffFilter`. In this case the color is queried from  the  terminal  even  though  the
              output is redirected.

              [default: auto]

              Possible values: - auto:   Only query the terminal for its colors if the output is

              not redirected

              -  always:  Always  query  the  terminal for its colors - never:  Never query the terminal for its
              colors

       -@, <b>--diff-args</b> &lt;STRING&gt;

              Extra arguments to pass to `git diff` when using delta to diff two files.

              E.g. `delta <b>--diff-args</b>=<u>-U999</u> file_1 file_2` is equivalent to `git diff <b>--no-index</b>  <b>--color</b>  <b>-U999</b>
              file_1 file_2 | delta`.

              If  you  use process substitution (`delta &lt;(command_1) &lt;(command_2)`) and your git version doesn't
              support it, then delta will fall back to `diff` instead of `git diff`.

              [default: ]

       <b>--diff-highlight</b>

              Emulate diff-highlight.

              &lt;https://github.com/git/git/tree/master/contrib/diff-highlight&gt;

       <b>--diff-so-fancy</b>

              Emulate diff-so-fancy.

              &lt;https://github.com/so-fancy/diff-so-fancy&gt;

       <b>--diff-stat-align-width</b> &lt;N&gt;

              Width allocated for file paths in a diff stat section.

              If a relativized file path exceeds this width then the diff stat will be misaligned.

              [default: 48]

       <b>--features</b> &lt;FEATURES&gt;

              Names of delta features to activate (space-separated).

              A feature is a named collection of delta options  in  <a href="file:~/.gitconfig.">~/.gitconfig.</a>   See  FEATURES  section.  The
              environment variable DELTA_FEATURES can be set to a space-separated list of feature names. If this
              is  preceded with a + character, the features from the environment variable will be added to those
              specified in git config. E.g.  DELTA_FEATURES=+side-by-side can be used to  activate  side-by-side
              temporarily (use DELTA_FEATURES=+ to go back to just the features from git config).

       <b>--file-added-label</b> &lt;STRING&gt;

              Text to display before an added file path.

              Used in the default value of navigate-regex.

              [default: added:]

       <b>--file-copied-label</b> &lt;STRING&gt;

              Text to display before a copied file path

              [default: copied:]

       <b>--file-decoration-style</b> &lt;STYLE&gt;

              Style string for the file decoration.

              See  STYLES  section.  The  style  string should contain one of the special attributes 'box', 'ul'
              (underline), 'ol' (overline), or the combination 'ul ol'.

              [default: "blue ul"]

       <b>--file-modified-label</b> &lt;STRING&gt;

              Text to display before a modified file path.

              Used in the default value of navigate-regex.

       <b>--file-renamed-label</b> &lt;STRING&gt;

              Text to display before a renamed file path.

              Used in the default value of navigate-regex.

              [default: renamed:]

       <b>--file-style</b> &lt;STYLE&gt;

              Style string for the file section.

              See STYLES section. The style 'omit' can be used to remove the file section from the output.

              [default: blue]

       <b>--file-transformation</b> &lt;SED_CMD&gt;

              Sed-style command transforming file paths for display

       <b>--generate-completion</b> &lt;GENERATE_COMPLETION&gt;

              Print completion file for the given shell

              [possible values: bash, elvish, fish, powershell, zsh]

       <b>--grep-context-line-style</b> &lt;STYLE&gt;

              Style string for non-matching lines of grep output.

              See STYLES section. Defaults to zero-style.

       <b>--grep-file-style</b> &lt;STYLE&gt;

              Style string for file paths in grep output.

              See STYLES section.

              [default: magenta]

       <b>--grep-header-decoration-style</b> &lt;STYLE&gt;

              Style string for the header decoration in grep output.

              Default  is  "none"  when  grep-output-type-is  "ripgrep",  otherwise   defaults   to   value   of
              header-decoration-style. See hunk-header-decoration-style.

       <b>--grep-header-file-style</b> &lt;STYLE&gt;

              Style string for the file path part of the header in grep output.

              See hunk_header_file_style.

       <b>--grep-line-number-style</b> &lt;STYLE&gt;

              Style string for line numbers in grep output.

              See STYLES section.

              [default: green]

       <b>--grep-output-type</b> &lt;OUTPUT_TYPE&gt;

              Grep  output  format.  Possible  values:  "ripgrep" - file name printed once, followed by matching
              lines within that file, each preceded by  a  line  number.  "classic"  -  file  name:line  number,
              followed  by  matching  line.  Default  is  "ripgrep" if `rg <b>--json</b>` format is detected, otherwise
              "classic"

              [possible values: ripgrep, classic]

       <b>--grep-match-line-style</b> &lt;STYLE&gt;

              Style string for matching lines of grep output.

              See STYLES section. Defaults to plus-style.

       <b>--grep-match-word-style</b> &lt;STYLE&gt;

              Style string for the matching substrings within a matching line of grep output.

              See STYLES section. Defaults to plus-style.

       <b>--grep-separator-symbol</b> &lt;STRING&gt;

              Separator symbol printed after the file path and line number in grep output.

              Defaults to ":" for both  match  and  context  lines,  since  many  terminal  emulators  recognize
              constructs like "/path/to/file:7:".  However, standard grep output uses "-" for context lines: set
              this option to "keep" to keep the original separator symbols.

              [default: :]

       <b>--hunk-header-decoration-style</b> &lt;STYLE&gt;

              Style string for the hunk-header decoration.

              See  STYLES  section.  The  style  string should contain one of the special attributes 'box', 'ul'
              (underline), 'ol' (overline), or the combination 'ul ol'.

              [default: "blue box"]

       <b>--hunk-header-file-style</b> &lt;STYLE&gt;

              Style string for the file path part of the hunk-header.

              See STYLES section. The file path will only be displayed if hunk-header-style contains the  'file'
              special attribute.

              [default: blue]

       <b>--hunk-header-line-number-style</b> &lt;STYLE&gt;

              Style string for the line number part of the hunk-header.

              See  STYLES  section.  The  line  number  will only be displayed if hunk-header-style contains the
              'line-number' special attribute.

              [default: blue]

       <b>--hunk-header-style</b> &lt;STYLE&gt;

              Style string for the hunk-header.

              See STYLES section. Special attributes 'file' and 'line-number' can be used to  include  the  file
              path,  and  number  of first hunk line, in the hunk header. The style 'omit' can be used to remove
              the hunk header section from the output.

              [default: "line-number syntax"]

       <b>--hunk-label</b> &lt;STRING&gt;

              Text to display before a hunk header.

              Used in the default value of navigate-regex.

              [default: ]

       <b>--hyperlinks</b>

              Render commit hashes, file names, and line numbers as hyperlinks.

              Following        the        hyperlink         spec         for         terminal         emulators:
              &lt;https://gist.github.com/egmontkob/eb114294efbcd5adb1944c9f3cb5feda&gt;.   By default, file names and
              line numbers link to the local file using a file URL, whereas commit hashes link to the commit  in
              GitHub,  if  the remote repository is hosted by GitHub. See <b>--hyperlinks-file-link-format</b> for full
              control over the file URLs emitted. Hyperlinks are supported by several common terminal emulators.
              To make them work, you must use less version &gt;= 581 with the <b>-R</b> flag (or use <b>-r</b>  with  older  less
              versions, but this will break e.g. <b>--navigate</b>). If you use tmux, then you will also need a patched
              fork of tmux (see &lt;https://github.com/dandavison/tmux&gt;).

       <b>--hyperlinks-commit-link-format</b> &lt;FMT&gt;

              Format string for commit hyperlinks (requires <b>--hyperlinks</b>).

              The   placeholder   "{commit}"   will   be   replaced   by   the   commit   hash.   For   example:
              <b>--hyperlinks-commit-link-format=</b>'https://mygitrepo/{commit}/'

       <b>--hyperlinks-file-link-format</b> &lt;FMT&gt;

              Format string for file hyperlinks (requires <b>--hyperlinks</b>).

              The placeholders "{path}" and "{line}" will be replaced by the absolute file  path  and  the  line
              number,  respectively.  The  default  value  of this option creates hyperlinks using standard file
              URLs; your operating system should open these in the application registered for  that  file  type.
              However,  these  do not make use of the line number. In order for the link to open the file at the
              correct line number, you could use a custom URL format  such  as  "file-line://{path}:{line}"  and
              register  an  application  to handle the custom "file-line" URL scheme by opening the file in your
              editor/IDE at the indicated line number. See &lt;https://github.com/dandavison/open-in-editor&gt; for an
              example.

              [default: file://{path}]

       <b>--inline-hint-style</b> &lt;STYLE&gt;

              Style string for short inline hint text.

              This styles certain content added by delta to the original diff  such  as  special  characters  to
              highlight tabs, and the symbols used to indicate wrapped lines. See STYLES section.

              [default: blue]

       <b>--inspect-raw-lines</b> &lt;true|false&gt;

              Kill-switch for <b>--color-moved</b> support.

              Whether  to  examine  ANSI  color escape sequences in raw lines received from Git and handle lines
              colored in certain ways specially. This  is  on  by  default:  it  is  how  Delta  supports  Git's
              <b>--color-moved</b> feature. Set this to "false" to disable this behavior.

              [default: true] [possible values: true, false]

       <b>--keep-plus-minus-markers</b>

              Prefix added/removed lines with a +/- character, as git does.

              By default, delta does not emit any prefix, so code can be copied directly from delta's output.

       <b>--light</b>

              Use default colors appropriate for a light terminal background.

              For more control, see the style options and <b>--syntax-theme</b>.

       <b>--line-buffer-size</b> &lt;N&gt;

              Size of internal line buffer.

              Delta  compares  the  added  and removed versions of nearby lines in order to detect and highlight
              changes at the level  of  individual  words/tokens.  Therefore,  nearby  lines  must  be  buffered
              internally  before  they are painted and emitted. Increasing this value might improve highlighting
              of some large diff hunks. However, setting this to a high  value  will  adversely  affect  delta's
              performance when entire files are added/removed.

              [default: 32]

       <b>--line-fill-method</b> &lt;STRING&gt;

              Line-fill method in side-by-side mode.

              How  to  extend  the  background  color  to  the end of the line in side-by-side mode. Can be ansi
              (default) or spaces (default if output is not to a terminal). Has no effect if <b>--width</b>=<u>variable</u> is
              given.

              [possible values: ansi, spaces]

       <b>-n</b>, <b>--line-numbers</b>

              Display line numbers next to the diff.

              See LINE NUMBERS section.

       <b>--line-numbers-left-format</b> &lt;FMT&gt;

              Format string for the left column of line numbers.

              A typical value would be "{nm:^4}???" which means to display the line numbers of  the  minus  file
              (old  version),  center-aligned,  padded  to  a  width  of  4  characters,  followed by a dividing
              character. See the LINE NUMBERS section.

       <b>--max-line-distance</b> &lt;DIST&gt;

              Maximum line pair distance parameter in within-line diff algorithm.

              This parameter is the maximum distance (0.0 - 1.0) between two lines for them to be inferred to be
              homologous. Homologous line  pairs  are  highlighted  according  to  the  deletion  and  insertion
              operations transforming one into the other.

              [default: 0.6]

       <b>--max-syntax-highlighting-length</b> &lt;N&gt;

              Stop syntax highlighting lines after this many characters.

              To  always  highlight  entire  lines,  set to zero - but note that delta will be slow on very long
              lines (e.g. minified .js).

              [default: 400]

       <b>--max-line-length</b> &lt;N&gt;

              Truncate lines longer than this.

              To prevent any truncation, set to zero. When wrapping lines this does nothing as it is overwritten
              to fit at least all visible characters, see `--wrap-max-lines`.

              [default: 3000]

       <b>--merge-conflict-begin-symbol</b> &lt;STRING&gt;

       <b>--pager</b> &lt;CMD&gt;

              Which pager to use.

              The  default  pager  is  `less`.  You  can  also  change pager by setting the environment variable
              DELTA_PAGER, or PAGER. This option overrides these environment variables.

       <b>--paging</b> &lt;auto|always|never&gt;

              Whether to use a pager when displaying output.

              Options are: auto, always, and never.

              [default: "syntax auto"]

       <b>--raw</b>

              Do not alter the input in any way.

              This is mainly intended for testing delta.

       <b>--relative-paths</b>

              Output all file paths relative to the current directory.

              This means that they will resolve correctly when clicked on or used in shell commands.

       <b>--right-arrow</b> &lt;STRING&gt;

              Text to display with a changed file path.

              For example, a unified diff heading, a rename, or a chmod.

       [default: "???
              "]

       <b>--show-colors</b>

              Show available named colors.

              In  addition  to  named  colors, arbitrary colors can be specified using RGB hex codes. See COLORS
              section.

       <b>--show-config</b>

              Display the active values for all Delta options.

              Style string options are displayed with foreground and background colors.  This  can  be  used  to
              experiment  with  colors  by  combining  this  option  with  other  options such as <b>--minus-style</b>,
              <b>--zero-style</b>, <b>--plus-style</b>, <b>--light</b>, <b>--dark</b>, etc.

       <b>--show-syntax-themes</b>

              Show example diff for available syntax-highlighting themes.

              If diff output is supplied on standard input then this will be used for  the  demo.  For  example:
              `git show | delta <b>--show-syntax-themes</b>`.

       <b>--show-themes</b>

              Show example diff for available delta themes.

              A  delta  theme  is a delta named feature (see <b>--features</b>) that sets either `light` or `dark`. See
              &lt;https://github.com/dandavison/delta#custom-color-themes&gt;. If diff output is supplied on  standard
              input  then  this  will  be  used  for the demo. For example: `git show | delta <b>--show-themes</b>`. By
              default shows dark or light themes only, according to whether delta is in dark or light  mode  (as
              set  by the user or inferred from BAT_THEME).  To control the themes shown, use <b>--dark</b> or <b>--light</b>,
              or both, on the command line together with this option.

       <b>-s</b>, <b>--side-by-side</b>

              Display diffs in side-by-side layout

       <b>--syntax-theme</b> &lt;SYNTAX_THEME&gt;

              The syntax-highlighting theme to use.

              Use <b>--show-syntax-themes</b> to demo  available  themes.  Defaults  to  the  value  of  the  BAT_THEME
              environment variable, if that contains a valid theme name. <b>--syntax-theme</b>=<u>none</u> disables all syntax
              highlighting.

       <b>--tabs</b> &lt;N&gt;

              The number of spaces to replace tab characters with.

              Use  <b>--tabs</b>=<u>0</u>  to  pass  tab  characters  through  directly, but note that in that case delta will
              calculate line widths assuming tabs occupy one character's width on the screen: if  your  terminal
              renders tabs as more than one character wide then delta's output will look incorrect.

              [default: 8]

       <b>--true-color</b> &lt;auto|always|never&gt;

              Whether to emit 24-bit ("true color") RGB color codes.

              Options  are  auto, always, and never. "auto" means that delta will emit 24-bit color codes if the
              environment variable COLORTERM has the value "truecolor" or "24bit". If your terminal  application
              (the  application  you  use  to  enter commands at a shell prompt) supports 24 bit colors, then it
              probably already sets this environment variable, in which case you don't need to do anything.

              [default: auto] [possible values: auto, always, never]

       <b>--whitespace-error-style</b> &lt;STYLE&gt;

              Style string for whitespace errors.

              Defaults to color.diff.whitespace if that is set in git config, or else 'magenta reverse'.

              [default: "auto auto"]

       <b>-w</b>, <b>--width</b> &lt;N&gt;

              The width of underline/overline decorations.

              Examples: "72" (exactly 72 characters), "-2" (auto-detected terminal width minus 2). An expression
              such as "74-2" is also valid (equivalent to 72 but may be useful if  the  caller  has  a  variable
              holding  the  value "74"). Use <b>--width</b>=<u>variable</u> to extend decorations and background colors to the
              end of the text only. Otherwise background colors extend to the full terminal width.

       <b>--word-diff-regex</b> &lt;REGEX&gt;

              Regular expression defining a 'word' in within-line diff algorithm.

              The regular expression used to decide what a word is for the within-line highlight algorithm.  For
              less  fine-grained  matching  than the default try <b>--word-diff-regex=</b>"\S+" <b>--max-line-distance</b>=<u>1</u>.0
              (this is more similar to `git <b>--word-diff</b>`).

              [default: \w+]

       <b>--wrap-left-symbol</b> &lt;STRING&gt;

              End-of-line wrapped content symbol (left-aligned).

              Symbol added to the end of a line indicating that the content has been wrapped onto the next  line
              and continues left-aligned.

              [default: ???]

       <b>--wrap-max-lines</b> &lt;N&gt;

              How often a line should be wrapped if it does not fit.

              Zero means to never wrap. Any content which does not fit after wrapping will be truncated. A value
              of "unlimited" means a line will be wrapped as many times as required.

              [default: 2]

       <b>--wrap-right-percent</b> &lt;PERCENT&gt;

              Threshold for right-aligning wrapped content.

              If  the  length  of  the  remaining  wrapped  content, as a percentage of width, is less than this
              quantity it will be right-aligned.  Otherwise it will be left-aligned.

              [default: 37.0]

       <b>--wrap-right-prefix-symbol</b> &lt;STRING&gt;

              Pre-wrapped content symbol (right-aligned).

              Symbol displayed before right-aligned wrapped content.

              [default: ???]

       <b>--wrap-right-symbol</b> &lt;STRING&gt;

              End-of-line wrapped content symbol (right-aligned).

              Symbol added to the end of a line indicating that the content has been wrapped onto the next  line
              and continues right-aligned.

              [default: ???]

       <b>--zero-style</b> &lt;STYLE&gt;

              Style string for unchanged lines.

              See STYLES section.

              [default: "syntax normal"]

       <b>--24-bit-color</b> &lt;auto|always|never&gt;

              Deprecated: use <b>--true-color</b>

              [possible values: auto, always, never]

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>

              Print help (see a summary with '-h')

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--version</b>

              Print version

       Git config

              By  default,  delta  takes  settings  from  a section named "delta" in git config files, if one is
              present. The git config file to use for delta options will  usually  be  <a href="file:~/.gitconfig">~/.gitconfig</a>,  but  delta
              follows  the rules given in &lt;https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config#FILES&gt;. Most delta options can be
              given in a git config file, using the usual option names but without the initial '--'. An  example
              is

              [delta]

              line-numbers = true zero-style = dim syntax

       Features

              A feature is a named collection of delta options in git config. An example is:

              [delta "my-delta-feature"]

              syntax-theme = Dracula plus-style = bold syntax "#002800"

              To activate those options, you would use:

              delta <b>--features</b> my-delta-feature

              A feature name may not contain whitespace. You can activate multiple features:

              [delta]

              features = my-highlight-styles-colors-feature my-line-number-styles-feature

              If more than one feature sets the same option, the last one wins.

              If an option is present in the [delta] section, then features are not considered at all.

              If  you want an option to be fully overridable by a feature and also have a non default value when
              no features are used, then you need to define a "default" feature and include it in the main delta
              configuration.

              For instance:

              [delta]

              feature = default-feature

              [delta "default-feature"]

              width = 123

              At this point, you can override features set in the command line or in the  environment  variables
              and the "last one wins" rules will apply as expected.

       Styles

              All  options  that  have  a  name  like  <b>--</b>*-style  work  the  same way. It is very similar to how
              colors/styles         are         specified         in         a          gitconfig          file:
              &lt;https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config#Documentation/git-config.txt-color&gt;

              Here is an example:

       <b>--minus-style</b> 'red bold ul "#ffeeee"'

              That  means:  For  removed  lines,  set  the  foreground  (text)  color to 'red', make it bold and
              underlined, and set the background color to '#ffeeee'.

              See the Colors section below for how to specify a color. In addition to real colors, there  are  4
              special color names: 'auto', 'normal', 'raw', and 'syntax'.

              Here is an example of using special color names together with a single attribute:

       <b>--minus-style</b> 'syntax bold auto'

              That  means: For removed lines, syntax-highlight the text, and make it bold, and do whatever delta
              normally does for the background.

              The available attributes are: 'blink', 'bold', 'dim', 'hidden', 'italic', 'reverse', 'strike', and
              'ul' (or 'underline').

              The attribute 'omit' is supported by commit-style, file-style, and hunk-header-style,  meaning  to
              remove the element entirely from the output.

              A complete description of the style string syntax follows:

              - If the input that delta is receiving already has colors, and you want

              delta  to output those colors unchanged, then use the special style string 'raw'. Otherwise, delta
              will strip any colors from its input.

              - A style string consists of 0, 1, or 2 colors, together with an arbitrary

              number of style attributes, all separated by spaces.

              - The first color is the foreground (text) color. The second color is the

              background color. Attributes can go in any position.

              - This means that in order to specify a background color you must also

              specify a foreground (text) color.

              - If you want delta to choose one of the colors automatically, then use the

              special color 'auto'. This can be used for both foreground and background.

              - If you want the foreground/background color to be your terminal's

              foreground/background color, then use the special color 'normal'.

              - If you want the foreground text to be syntax-highlighted according to its

              language, then use the special foreground color 'syntax'. This can only be used for the foreground
              (text).

              - The minimal style specification is the empty string ''. This means: do

              not apply any colors or styling to the element in question.

       Colors

              There are four ways to specify a color (this section applies to foreground and  background  colors
              within a style string):

              1. CSS color name

              Any of the 140 color names used in CSS: &lt;https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_groups.asp&gt;

              2. RGB hex code

              An example of using an RGB hex code is: <b>--file-style=</b>"#0e7c0e"

              3. ANSI color name

              There are 8 ANSI color names: black, red, green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan, white.

              In  addition,  all  of them have a bright form: brightblack, brightred, brightgreen, brightyellow,
              brightblue, brightmagenta, brightcyan, brightwhite.

              An example of using an ANSI color name is: <b>--file-style=</b>"green"

              Unlike RGB hex codes, ANSI color names are just names: you can choose the exact  color  that  each
              name corresponds to in the settings of your terminal application (the application you use to enter
              commands at a shell prompt). This means that if you use ANSI color names, and you change the color
              theme  used  by  your terminal, then delta's colors will respond automatically, without needing to
              change the delta command line.

              "purple" is accepted as a synonym for "magenta". Color names and codes are case-insensitive.

              4. ANSI color number

              An example of using an ANSI color number is: <b>--file-style</b>=<u>28</u>

              There are 256 ANSI color numbers: 0-255. The first 16 are the same as the colors described in  the
              "ANSI  color  name"  section  above.  See  &lt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code#8-bit&gt;.
              Specifying colors like this is useful if your terminal only  supports  256  colors  (i.e.  doesn't
              support 24-bit color).

       Line Numbers

              To display line numbers, use <b>--line-numbers</b>.

              Line numbers are displayed in two columns. Here's what it looks like by default:

       1 ???
              1 ??? unchanged line

       2 ???  ??? removed line

       ???    2 ??? added line

              In  that  output,  the  line  numbers  for  the old (minus) version of the file appear in the left
              column, and the line numbers for the new (plus) version of the file appear in the right column. In
              an unchanged (zero) line, both columns contain a line number.

              The following options allow the line number display to be customized:

       <b>--line-numbers-left-format</b>:
              Change the contents of the left column

       <b>--line-numbers-right-format</b>: Change the contents of the right column

       <b>--line-numbers-left-style</b>:
              Change the style applied to the left column

       <b>--line-numbers-right-style</b>:
              Change the style applied to the right column

       <b>--line-numbers-minus-style</b>:
              Change the style applied to line numbers in

              minus lines <b>--line-numbers-zero-style</b>:   Change the style applied to  line  numbers  in  unchanged
              lines <b>--line-numbers-plus-style</b>:   Change the style applied to line numbers in plus lines

              Options  <b>--line-numbers-left-format</b>  and  <b>--line-numbers-right-format</b>  allow  you  to  change  the
              contents of the line number columns. Their values are arbitrary format strings, which are  allowed
              to  contain  the placeholders {nm} for the line number associated with the old version of the file
              and {np} for the line number associated with the new version of the file. The placeholders support
              a      subset      of      the      string      formatting      syntax      documented       here:
              &lt;https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/fmt/#formatting-parameters&gt;.    Specifically,   you   can  use  the
              alignment and width syntax.

              For example, the default value of <b>--line-numbers-left-format</b> is '{nm:^4}???'.  This means that the
              left column should display the minus line number (nm), center-aligned, padded  with  spaces  to  a
              width of 4 characters, followed by a unicode dividing-line character (???).

              Similarly,  the default value of <b>--line-numbers-right-format</b> is '{np:^4}???'.  This means that the
              right column should display the plus line number (np), center-aligned, padded  with  spaces  to  a
              width of 4 characters, followed by a unicode dividing-line character (???).

              Use '&lt;' for left-align, '^' for center-align, and '&gt;' for right-align.
