</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       ramsgate - Remote AMS gateway daemon

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ramsgate</b> <u>application_name</u> <u>authority_name</u> [<u>bundles_TTL</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ramsgate</b> is a background "daemon" task that functions as a Remote AMS gateway.  <u>application_name</u> and
       <u>authority_name</u> must identify an AMS venture that is known to operate in the local continuum, as noted in
       the MIB for the <b>ramsgate</b> application module.

       <b>ramsgate</b> will register as an application module in the root unit of the indicated venture, so a
       configuration server for the local continuum and a registrar for the root unit of the indicated venture
       (which may both be instantiated in a single <b>amsd</b> daemon task) must be running in order for <b>ramsgate</b> to
       commence operations.

       <b>ramsgate</b> with communicate with other RAMS gateway modules in other continua by means of the RAMS network
       protocol noted in the RAMS gateway endpoint ID for the local continuum, as identified (explicitly or
       implicitly) in the MIB.

       If the RAMS network protocol is "bp" (i.e., the DTN Bundle Protocol), then an ION Bundle Protocol node
       must be operating on the local computer and that node must be registered in the BP endpoint identified by
       the RAMS gateway endpoint ID for the local continuum.  Moreover, in this case the value of <u>bundles_TTL</u> -
       if specified - will be taken as the lifetime in seconds that is to be declared for all "bundles" issued
       by <b>ramsgate</b>; <u>bundles_TTL</u> defaults to 86400 seconds (one day) if omitted.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       "0" <b>ramsgate</b> terminated normally.

       "1" <b>ramsgate</b> failed, for reasons noted in the ion.log file; the task terminated.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       A MIB initialization file with the applicable default name (see <u><a href="../man5/amsrc.5.html">amsrc</a></u>(5)) must be present.

       <b>ramsgate</b> records all "petitions" (requests for data on behalf of AMS modules in other continua) in a file
       named "petition.log".  At startup, the <b>ramsgate</b> daemon automatically reads and processes all petitions in
       the  petition.log  file  just  as  if they were received in real time.  <b>Note</b> that this means that you can
       cause petitions to be, in effect, "pre-received" by simply editing this file prior to startup.  This  can
       be  an  especially effective way to configure a RAMS network in which long signal propagation times would
       otherwise retard real-time petitioning and thus delay the onset of fully functional message exchange.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       No environment variables apply.

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       The following diagnostics may be issued to the <b>ion.log</b> log file:

       ramsgate can't run.
           RAMS gateway functionality failed, for reasons noted in the ion.log file.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Note that the AMS design principle of receiving messages immediately  and  enqueuing  them  for  eventual
       ingestion  by the application module - rather than imposing application-layer flow control on AMS message
       traffic - enables high performance but makes <b>ramsgate</b> vulnerable to message spikes.  Since production and
       transmission of bundles is typically slower than AMS message reception over TCP service, the ION  working
       memory  and/or  heap  space  available  for  AMS  event insertion and/or bundle production can be quickly
       exhausted if a high rate of  application  message  production  is  sustained  for  a  long  enough  time.
       Mechanisms  for  defending against this sort of failure are under study, but for now the best mitigations
       are simply to (a) build with compiler option -DAMS_INDUSTRIAL=1, (b) allocate as much space  as  possible
       to ION working memory and SDR heap (see <u><a href="../man5/ionconfig.5.html">ionconfig</a></u>(5)) and (c) limit the rate of AMS message issuance.
