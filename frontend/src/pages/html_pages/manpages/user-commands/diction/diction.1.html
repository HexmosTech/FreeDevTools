       diction - print wordy and commonly misused phrases in sentences

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>diction</b> [<b>-b</b>] [<b>-d</b>] [<b>-f</b> <u>file</u> [<b>-n</b>|<b>-L</b> <u>language</u>]] [<u>file</u>...]
       <b>diction</b> [<b>--beginner</b>] [<b>--ignore-double-words</b>] [<b>--file</b> <u>file</u> [<b>--no-default-file</b>|<b>--language</b> <u>language</u>]]
       [<u>file</u>...]
       <b>diction</b> <b>-h</b>|<b>--help</b>
       <b>diction</b> <b>--version</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Diction</b> finds all sentences in a document that contain phrases from a database of frequently misused, bad
       or  wordy diction.  It further checks for double words.  If no files are given, the document is read from
       standard input.  Each found phrase is enclosed in <b>[</b> <b>]</b> (brackets).  Suggestions and advice, if any and  if
       asked for, are printed headed by a right arrow <b>-&gt;</b>.  A sentence is a sequence of words, that starts with a
       capitalised  word  and ends with a full stop, double colon, question mark or exclaimation mark.  A single
       letter followed by a dot is considered an abbreviation, so it does not  terminate  a  sentence.   Various
       multi-letter  abbreviations  are  recognized,  they  do  not  terminate  a  sentence  as well, neither do
       fractional numbers.

       <b>Diction</b> understands <u><a href="../man1/cpp.1.html">cpp</a></u>(1) <b>#line</b> lines for being able to give precise locations when printing sentences.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-b</b>, <b>--beginner</b>
              Complain about mistakes typically made by beginners.

       <b>-d</b>, <b>--ignore-double-words</b>
              Ignore double words and do not complain about them.

       <b>-s</b>, <b>--suggest</b>
              Suggest better wording, if any.

       <b>-f</b> <u>file</u>, <b>--file</b> <u>file</u>
              Read the user specified database from the specified <u>file</u> in addition to the default database.

       <b>-n</b>, <b>--no-default-file</b>
              Do not read the default database, so only the user-specified database is used.

       <b>-L</b> <u>language</u>, <b>--language</b> <u>language</u>
              Set the phrase file language (de, <b>en</b>, <b>nl</b>).

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
              Print a short usage message.

       <b>--version</b>
              Print the version.

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       On usage errors, 1 is returned.  Termination caused by lack of memory is signalled by exit code 2.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLE</b></h4><pre>
       The following example first removes all roff constructs and headers from a document and feeds the  result
       to diction with a German database:

              deroff -s file.mm | diction -L de | fmt

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>LC_MESSAGES</b>=<b>de</b>|<b>en</b>|<b>nl</b>
              specifies  the  message language and is also used as default for the phrase language.  The default
              language is <b>en</b>.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       ${prefix}/share/diction/*     databases for various languages

       The file consists of lines, one per entry.  Each line is divided by one or two tabs into two parts:  Left
       is  the text to match and right is the suggestion.  The text to match either starts with a space to match
       a full word or with letters to match suffixes.  If it ends with a tilde, it matches a prefix.

       The suggestion may be empty to mark fill words, contain an  explanation  or  start  with  an  equal  sign
       followed  by  text to match for referring to the explanation of that text.  The right part can consist of
       an exclamation mark to mark exceptions that should not be matched.

       If both parts are separated by two tabs, then this entry concerns mistakes typically made by beginners.

       Empty lines or lines starting with a hash are ignored.

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       There  has  been  a  diction command on old UNIX systems, which is now part of the AT&amp;T DWB package.  The
       original version was bound to roff by enforcing a call to deroff.  This version is a reimplementation and
       must run in a pipe with <b><a href="../man1/deroff.1.html">deroff</a></b>(1) if you want to process roff documents.  Similarly, you can run it in  a
       pipe with <b><a href="../man1/dehtml.1.html">dehtml</a></b>(1) or <b><a href="../man1/detex.1.html">detex</a></b>(1) to process HTML or TeX documents.
