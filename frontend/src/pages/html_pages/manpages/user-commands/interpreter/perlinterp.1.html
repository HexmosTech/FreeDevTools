       perlinterp - An overview of the Perl interpreter

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This document provides an overview of how the Perl interpreter works at the level of C code, along with
       pointers to the relevant C source code files.

</pre><h4><b>ELEMENTS</b> <b>OF</b> <b>THE</b> <b>INTERPRETER</b></h4><pre>
       The work of the interpreter has two main stages: compiling the code into the internal representation, or
       bytecode, and then executing it.  "Compiled code" in perlguts explains exactly how the compilation stage
       happens.

       Here is a short breakdown of perl's operation:

   <b>Startup</b>
       The action begins in <u>perlmain.c</u>. (or <u>miniperlmain.c</u> for miniperl) This is very high-level code, enough to
       fit on a single screen, and it resembles the code found in perlembed; most of the real action takes place
       in <u>perl.c</u>

       <u>perlmain.c</u> is generated by "ExtUtils::Miniperl" from <u>miniperlmain.c</u> at make time, so you should make perl
       to follow this along.

       First, <u>perlmain.c</u> allocates some memory and constructs a Perl interpreter, along these lines:

           1 PERL_SYS_INIT3(&amp;argc,&amp;argv,&amp;env);
           2
           3 if (!PL_do_undump) {
           4     my_perl = perl_alloc();
           5     if (!my_perl)
           6         <a href="../man1/exit.1.html">exit</a>(1);
           7     <a href="../manmy_perl/perl_construct.my_perl.html">perl_construct</a>(my_perl);
           8     PL_perl_destruct_level = 0;
           9 }

       Line 1 is a macro, and its definition is dependent on your operating system. Line 3 references
       "PL_do_undump", a global variable - all global variables in Perl start with "PL_". This tells you whether
       the current running program was created with the "-u" flag to perl and then <u>undump</u>, which means it's
       going to be false in any sane context.

       Line 4 calls a function in <u>perl.c</u> to allocate memory for a Perl interpreter. It's quite a simple
       function, and the guts of it looks like this:

        my_perl = (PerlInterpreter*)PerlMem_malloc(sizeof(PerlInterpreter));

       Here you see an example of Perl's system abstraction, which we'll see later: "PerlMem_malloc" is either
       your system's "malloc", or Perl's own "malloc" as defined in <u>malloc.c</u> if you selected that option at
       configure time.

       Next, in line 7, we construct the interpreter using perl_construct, also in <u>perl.c</u>; this sets up all the
       special variables that Perl needs, the stacks, and so on.

       Now we pass Perl the command line options, and tell it to go:

        if (!perl_parse(my_perl, xs_init, argc, argv, (char **)NULL))
            <a href="../manmy_perl/perl_run.my_perl.html">perl_run</a>(my_perl);

        exitstatus = <a href="../manmy_perl/perl_destruct.my_perl.html">perl_destruct</a>(my_perl);

        <a href="../manmy_perl/perl_free.my_perl.html">perl_free</a>(my_perl);

       "perl_parse" is actually a wrapper around "S_parse_body", as defined in <u>perl.c</u>, which processes the
       command line options, sets up any statically linked XS modules, opens the program and calls "yyparse" to
       parse it.

   <b>Parsing</b>
       The aim of this stage is to take the Perl source, and turn it into an op tree. We'll see what one of
       those looks like later. Strictly speaking, there's three things going on here.

       "yyparse", the parser, lives in <u>perly.c</u>, although you're better off reading the original YACC input in
       <u>perly.y</u>. (Yes, Virginia, there <b>is</b> a YACC grammar for Perl!) The job of the parser is to take your code
       and "understand" it, splitting it into sentences, deciding which operands go with which operators and so
       on.

       The parser is nobly assisted by the lexer, which chunks up your input into tokens, and decides what type
       of thing each token is: a variable name, an operator, a bareword, a subroutine, a core function, and so
       on. The main point of entry to the lexer is "yylex", and that and its associated routines can be found in
       <u>toke.c</u>. Perl isn't much like other computer languages; it's highly context sensitive at times, it can be
       tricky to work out what sort of token something is, or where a token ends. As such, there's a lot of
       interplay between the tokeniser and the parser, which can get pretty frightening if you're not used to
       it.

       As the parser understands a Perl program, it builds up a tree of operations for the interpreter to
       perform during execution. The routines which construct and link together the various operations are to be
       found in <u>op.c</u>, and will be examined later.

   <b>Optimization</b>
       Now the parsing stage is complete, and the finished tree represents the operations that the Perl
       interpreter needs to perform to execute our program. Next, Perl does a dry run over the tree looking for
       optimisations: constant expressions such as "3 + 4" will be computed now, and the optimizer will also see
       if any multiple operations can be replaced with a single one. For instance, to fetch the variable $foo,
       instead of grabbing the glob *foo and looking at the scalar component, the optimizer fiddles the op tree
       to use a function which directly looks up the scalar in question. The main optimizer is "peep" in <u>op.c</u>,
       and many ops have their own optimizing functions.

   <b>Running</b>
       Now we're finally ready to go: we have compiled Perl byte code, and all that's left to do is run it. The
       actual execution is done by the "runops_standard" function in <u>run.c</u>; more specifically, it's done by
       these three innocent looking lines:

           while ((PL_op = PL_op-&gt;op_ppaddr(aTHX))) {
               PERL_ASYNC_CHECK();
           }

       You may be more comfortable with the Perl version of that:

           PERL_ASYNC_CHECK() while $Perl::op = &amp;{$Perl::op-&gt;{function}};

       Well, maybe not. Anyway, each op contains a function pointer, which stipulates the function which will
       actually carry out the operation.  This function will return the next op in the sequence - this allows
       for things like "if" which choose the next op dynamically at run time. The "PERL_ASYNC_CHECK" makes sure
       that things like signals interrupt execution if required.

       The actual functions called are known as PP code, and they're spread between four files: <u>pp_hot.c</u>
       contains the "hot" code, which is most often used and highly optimized, <u>pp_sys.c</u> contains all the system-
       specific functions, <u>pp_ctl.c</u> contains the functions which implement control structures ("if", "while" and
       the like) and <u>pp.c</u> contains everything else. These are, if you like, the C code for Perl's built-in
       functions and operators.

       Note that each "pp_" function is expected to return a pointer to the next op. Calls to perl subs (and
       eval blocks) are handled within the same runops loop, and do not consume extra space on the C stack. For
       example, "pp_entersub" and "pp_entertry" just push a "CXt_SUB" or "CXt_EVAL" block struct onto the
       context stack, which contain the address of the op following the sub call or eval. They then return the
       first op of that sub or eval block, and so execution continues of that sub or block. Later, a
       "pp_leavesub" or "pp_leavetry" op pops the "CXt_SUB" or "CXt_EVAL", retrieves the return op from it, and
       returns it.

   <b>Exception</b> <b>handing</b>
       Perl's exception handing (i.e. "die" etc.) is built on top of the low-level setjmp()/longjmp() C-library
       functions. These basically provide a way to capture the current PC and SP registers of the CPU and later
       restore them: i.e. a longjmp() continues at the point in code where a previous setjmp() was done, with
       anything further up on the C stack being lost. (This is why code should always save values using
       "SAVE_<u>FOO</u>" rather than in auto variables.)

       The perl core wraps setjmp() and longjmp() in the macros "JMPENV_PUSH" and "JMPENV_JUMP". The push
       operation, as well as setting a setjump(), stores some temporary state in a struct local to the current
       function (allocated by "dJMPENV"). In particular, it stores a pointer to the previous "JMPENV" struct,
       and updates "PL_top_env" to point to the newest one, forming a chain of "JMPENV" states. Both the push
       and jump can output debugging information under "perl -Dl".

       A basic rule of the perl internals is that all interpreter exits are achieved via a JMPENV_JUMP(). In
       particular:

       •   level 2: perl-level <b>exit()</b> and internals <b>my_exit()</b>

           These unwind all stacks, then perform a <b><a href="../man2/JMPENV_JUMP.2.html">JMPENV_JUMP</a></b>(2).

       •   level 3: perl-level <b>die()</b> and internals <b>croak()</b>

           If currently within an eval, these pop the context stack back to the nearest "CXt_EVAL" frame, set $@
           as  appropriate, set "PL_restartop" to the op which follows the eval associated with that frame, then
           perform a <b><a href="../man3/JMPENV_JUMP.3.html">JMPENV_JUMP</a></b>(3).

           Otherwise, the error message is printed to "STDERR", then it is treated as an exit: unwind all stacks
           and perform a <b><a href="../man2/JMPENV_JUMP.2.html">JMPENV_JUMP</a></b>(2).

       •   level 1: unused

           <b><a href="../man1/JMPENV_JUMP.1.html">JMPENV_JUMP</a></b>(1) is currently unused except in <b>perl_run()</b>.

       •   level 0: normal return.

           The zero value is for a normal return from <b>JMPENV_PUSH()</b>

       So the perl interpreter expects that, at all times, there is a suitable "JMPENV_PUSH" set up  (and  at  a
       suitable location within the CPU call stack) that can catch and process a 2- or 3-valued jump; and in the
       case  of  a  3,  start  a  new  runops  loop  to execute "PL_restartop" and all remaining ops (as will be
       explained shortly).

       The entry points to the perl  interpreter  all  provide  such  a  facility.  For  example,  <b>perl_parse()</b>,
       <b>perl_run()</b> and  "call_sv(cv, G_EVAL)" all contain something similar in outline to:

           {
               dJMPENV;
               JMPENV_PUSH(ret);
               switch (ret) {
               case 0:                     /* normal return from JMPENV_PUSH() */
                 redo_body:
                   CALLRUNOPS(aTHX);
                   break;
               case 2:                     /* caught <a href="../man2/longjmp.2.html">longjmp</a>(2) - exit / die */
                   break;
               case 3:                     /* caught <a href="../man3/longjmp.3.html">longjmp</a>(3) - eval { die } */
                   PL_op = PL_restartop;
                   goto redo_body;
               }

               JMPENV_POP;
           }

       A runops loop such as <b>Perl_runops_standard()</b> (as set up by <b>CALLRUNOPS()</b>) is, at its heart, just a simple:

           while ((PL_op = PL_op-&gt;op_ppaddr(aTHX))) { 1; }

       which calls the <b>pp()</b> function associated with each op, relying on that to return a pointer to the next op
       to be executed.

       As  well as setting catches at the entry points to the perl interpreter, you might expect perl to also do
       a <b>JMPENV_PUSH()</b> in places like <b>pp_entertry()</b>, just before some trappable ops are executed. In  fact  perl
       doesn't normally do this. The drawback with doing it is that with nested or recursive code such as:

           sub foo { my ($i) = @_; return if $i &lt; 0; eval { foo(--$i) } }

       Then the C stack would quickly overflow with pairs of entries like

           ...
           #N+3 Perl_runops()
           #N+2 Perl_pp_entertry()
           #N+1 Perl_runops()
           #N   Perl_pp_entertry()
           ...

       Instead,  perl  puts  its guards at the <u>callers</u> of runops loops. Then as many nested subroutine calls and
       evals may be called as you like, all within the one runops loop. If an exception occurs,  control  passes
       back  to the caller of the loop, which just immediately restarts a new loop with "PL_restartop" being the
       next op to call.

       So in normal operation where there are several nested evals, there will be  multiple  "CXt_EVAL"  context
       stack  entries,  but  only a single runops loop, guarded by a single "JMPENV_PUSH". Each caught eval will
       pop the next "CXt_EVAL" off the  stack,  set  "PL_restartop",  then  <b>longjmp()</b>  back  to  <b>perl_run()</b>  and
       continue.

       However,  ops  are  sometimes  executed  within an inner runops loop, such as in a tie, sort, or overload
       code. In this case, something like

           sub FETCH { eval { die }; .... }

       would, unless handled specially, cause a <b>longjmp()</b> right back to the guard in  <b>perl_run()</b>,  popping  <u>both</u>
       the  runops  loops  -  which  is  clearly  incorrect.   One way to avoid this is for the tie code to do a
       "JMPENV_PUSH" before executing "FETCH" in the inner runops loop, but for efficiency reasons, perl in fact
       just temporarily sets a flag using CATCH_SET(TRUE). This flag warns any subsequent "require", "entereval"
       or "entertry" ops that the caller is no longer promising to catch any raised exceptions on their behalf.

       These ops check this flag, and if true, they (via <b>docatch()</b>) do a "JMPENV_PUSH" and start  a  new  runops
       loop to execute the code, rather than doing it with the current loop.

       As  a  consequence, on exit from the eval block in the "FETCH" above, execution of the code following the
       block is still carried on in the inner loop (i.e. the one established by  the  <b>pp_entertry()</b>).  To  avoid
       confusion, if a further exception is then raised, <b>docatch()</b> compares the "JMPENV" level of the "CXt_EVAL"
       with  "PL_top_env"  and  if  they  differ,  just re-throws the exception. In this way any inner loops get
       popped, and the exception will be dealt with properly by the level which is expecting it.

       Here's an example.

           1: eval { tie @a, 'A' };
           2: sub A::TIEARRAY {
           3:     eval { die };
           4:     die;
           5: }

       To run this code, <b>perl_run()</b> is called, which does a <b>JMPENV_PUSH()</b>, then enters a runops loop. This  loop
       executes  the  "entereval"  and  "tie"  ops on line 1, with the "entereval" pushing a "CXt_EVAL" onto the
       context stack.

       The <b>pp_tie()</b> does a CATCH_SET(TRUE), then starts a second runops loop to execute the body of  <b>TIEARRAY()</b>.
       When the loop executes the "entertry" op on line 3, <b>CATCH_GET()</b> is true, so <b>pp_entertry()</b> calls <b>docatch()</b>
       which  does  a  "JMPENV_PUSH"  and  starts  a  third  runops loop, which restarts the <b>pp_entertry()</b>, then
       executes the "die" op. At this point the C call stack looks like this:

           #10 Perl_pp_die()
           #9  Perl_runops()      # runops loop 3
           #8  S_docatch()        # JMPENV level 2
           #7  Perl_pp_entertry()
           #6  Perl_runops()      # runops loop 2
           #5  Perl_call_sv()
           #4  Perl_pp_tie()
           #3  Perl_runops()      # runops loop 1
           #2  S_run_body()
           #1  perl_run()         # JMPENV level 1
           #0  main()

       and the context and data stacks, as shown by "perl -Dstv", look like:

           STACK 0: MAIN
             CX 0: BLOCK  =&gt;
             CX 1: EVAL   =&gt; AV()  PV("A"\0)
             retop=leave
           STACK 1: MAGIC
             CX 0: SUB    =&gt;
             retop=(null)
             CX 1: EVAL   =&gt; *
           retop=nextstate

       The <b>die()</b> pops the first  "CXt_EVAL"  off  the  context  stack,  sets  "PL_restartop"  from  it,  does  a
       <a href="../man3/JMPENV_JUMP.3.html">JMPENV_JUMP</a>(3),  and  control  returns  to  the "JMPENV" level set in <b>docatch()</b>. This then starts another
       third-level runops level, which executes the "nextstate", "pushmark" and "die" ops from line  4.  At  the
       point  that the second <b>pp_die()</b> is called, the C call stack looks exactly like that above, even though we
       are no longer within an inner eval. However, the context stack now looks like this,  i.e.  with  the  top
       CXt_EVAL popped:

           STACK 0: MAIN
             CX 0: BLOCK  =&gt;
             CX 1: EVAL   =&gt; AV()  PV("A"\0)
             retop=leave
           STACK 1: MAGIC
             CX 0: SUB    =&gt;
             retop=(null)

       The <b>die()</b> on line 4 pops the context stack back down to the "CXt_EVAL", leaving it as:

           STACK 0: MAIN
             CX 0: BLOCK  =&gt;

       As  usual,  "PL_restartop"  is extracted from the "CXt_EVAL", and a <b><a href="../man3/JMPENV_JUMP.3.html">JMPENV_JUMP</a></b>(3) done, which pops the C
       stack back to the <b>docatch()</b>:

           #8  S_docatch()        # JMPENV level 2
           #7  Perl_pp_entertry()
           #6  Perl_runops()      # runops loop 2
           #5  Perl_call_sv()
           #4  Perl_pp_tie()
           #3  Perl_runops()      # runops loop 1
           #2  S_run_body()
           #1  perl_run()         # JMPENV level 1
           #0  main()

       In  this case, because the "JMPENV" level recorded in  the  "CXt_EVAL"  differs  from  the  current  one,
       <b>docatch()</b> just does a <b><a href="../man3/JMPENV_JUMP.3.html">JMPENV_JUMP</a></b>(3) to re-throw the exception, and the C stack unwinds to:

           #1  perl_run()         # JMPENV level 1
           #0  main()

       Because "PL_restartop" is non-null, <b>run_body()</b> starts a new runops loop, and execution continues.

   <b>INTERNAL</b> <b>VARIABLE</b> <b>TYPES</b>
       You should by now have had a look at perlguts, which tells you about Perl's internal variable types: SVs,
       HVs, AVs and the rest. If not, do that now.

       These  variables are used not only to represent Perl-space variables, but also any constants in the code,
       as well as some structures completely internal to Perl. The symbol table, for instance,  is  an  ordinary
       Perl hash. Your code is represented by an SV as it's read into the parser; any program files you call are
       opened via ordinary Perl filehandles, and so on.

       The  core  Devel::Peek  module lets us examine SVs from a Perl program. Let's see, for instance, how Perl
       treats the constant "hello".

             % perl -MDevel::Peek -e 'Dump("hello")'
           1 SV = <a href="../man0xa041450/PV.0xa041450.html">PV</a>(0xa041450) at 0xa04ecbc
           2   REFCNT = 1
           3   FLAGS = (POK,READONLY,pPOK)
           4   PV = 0xa0484e0 "hello"\0
           5   CUR = 5
           6   LEN = 6

       Reading "Devel::Peek" output takes a bit of practise, so let's go through it line by line.

       Line 1 tells us we're looking at an SV which lives at 0xa04ecbc in memory. SVs themselves are very simple
       structures, but they contain a pointer to a more complex structure. In this case, it's a PV, a  structure
       which  holds  a  string  value,  at location 0xa041450. Line 2 is the reference count; there are no other
       references to this data, so it's 1.

       Line 3 are the flags for this SV - it's OK to use it as a  PV,  it's  a  read-only  SV  (because  it's  a
       constant)  and  the  data  is  a  PV  internally.  Next we've got the contents of the string, starting at
       location 0xa0484e0.

       Line 5 gives us the current length of the string - note that this does <b>not</b> include the  null  terminator.
       Line  6  is not the length of the string, but the length of the currently allocated buffer; as the string
       grows, Perl automatically extends the available storage via a routine called "SvGROW".

       You can get at any of these quantities from C very easily; just add "Sv" to the name of the  field  shown
       in  the snippet, and you've got a macro which will return the value: SvCUR(sv) returns the current length
       of the string, SvREFCOUNT(sv) returns the reference count, "SvPV(sv, len)" returns the string itself with
       its length, and so on.  More macros to manipulate these properties can be found in perlguts.

       Let's take an example of manipulating a PV, from "sv_catpvn", in <u>sv.c</u>

            1  void
            2  Perl_sv_catpvn(pTHX_ SV *sv, const char *ptr, STRLEN len)
            3  {
            4      STRLEN tlen;
            5      char *junk;

            6      junk = SvPV_force(sv, tlen);
            7      SvGROW(sv, tlen + len + 1);
            8      if (ptr == junk)
            9          ptr = SvPVX(sv);
           10      Move(ptr,SvPVX(sv)+tlen,len,char);
           11      SvCUR(sv) += len;
           12      *SvEND(sv) = '\0';
           13      (void)SvPOK_only_UTF8(sv);          /* validate pointer */
           14      SvTAINT(sv);
           15  }

       This is a function which adds a string, "ptr", of length "len" onto the end of the PV stored in "sv". The
       first thing we do in line 6 is make sure that the SV <b>has</b> a valid PV, by calling the "SvPV_force" macro to
       force a PV. As a side effect, "tlen" gets set to the current value of  the  PV,  and  the  PV  itself  is
       returned to "junk".

       In  line  7, we make sure that the SV will have enough room to accommodate the old string, the new string
       and the null terminator. If "LEN" isn't big enough, "SvGROW" will reallocate space for us.

       Now, if "junk" is the same as the string we're trying to add, we can grab the string  directly  from  the
       SV; "SvPVX" is the address of the PV in the SV.

       Line  10  does the actual catenation: the "Move" macro moves a chunk of memory around: we move the string
       "ptr" to the end of the PV - that's the start of the PV plus its current length. We're moving "len" bytes
       of type "char". After doing so, we need to tell Perl we've extended the  string,  by  altering  "CUR"  to
       reflect  the  new  length. "SvEND" is a macro which gives us the end of the string, so that needs to be a
       "\0".

       Line 13 manipulates the flags; since we've changed the PV, any IV or NV values will no longer  be  valid:
       if  we  have  "$x=10;  $x.="6";"  we  don't  want to use the old IV of 10. "SvPOK_only_utf8" is a special
       UTF-8-aware version of "SvPOK_only", a macro which turns off the IOK and NOK flags and turns on POK.  The
       final "SvTAINT" is a macro which launders tainted data if taint mode is turned on.

       AVs  and  HVs are more complicated, but SVs are by far the most common variable type being thrown around.
       Having seen something of how we manipulate these, let's go on and look at how the op tree is constructed.

</pre><h4><b>OP</b> <b>TREES</b></h4><pre>
       First, what is the op tree, anyway? The op tree is the parsed representation of your program, as  we  saw
       in  our  section  on  parsing, and it's the sequence of operations that Perl goes through to execute your
       program, as we saw in "Running".

       An op is a fundamental operation that Perl can perform: all the built-in functions and operators are ops,
       and there are a series of ops which deal with concepts the interpreter needs internally  -  entering  and
       leaving a block, ending a statement, fetching a variable, and so on.

       The  op tree is connected in two ways: you can imagine that there are two "routes" through it, two orders
       in which you can traverse the tree.  First, parse order reflects how the parser understood the code,  and
       secondly, execution order tells perl what order to perform the operations in.

       The  easiest way to examine the op tree is to stop Perl after it has finished parsing, and get it to dump
       out the tree. This is exactly what the compiler backends B::Terse, B::Concise and CPAN  module  &lt;B::Debug
       do.

       Let's have a look at how Perl sees "$x = $y + $z":

            % perl -MO=Terse -e '$x=$y+$z'
            1  LISTOP (0x8179888) leave
            2      OP (0x81798b0) enter
            3      COP (0x8179850) nextstate
            4      BINOP (0x8179828) sassign
            5          BINOP (0x8179800) add [1]
            6              UNOP (0x81796e0) null [15]
            7                  SVOP (0x80fafe0) gvsv  GV (0x80fa4cc) *y
            8              UNOP (0x81797e0) null [15]
            9                  SVOP (0x8179700) gvsv  GV (0x80efeb0) *z
           10          UNOP (0x816b4f0) null [15]
           11              SVOP (0x816dcf0) gvsv  GV (0x80fa460) *x

       Let's start in the middle, at line 4. This is a BINOP, a binary operator, which is at location 0x8179828.
       The  specific  operator  in  question  is "sassign" - scalar assignment - and you can find the code which
       implements it in the function "pp_sassign" in <u>pp_hot.c</u>. As a binary operator, it has  two  children:  the
       add  operator, providing the result of "$y+$z", is uppermost on line 5, and the left hand side is on line
       10.

       Line 10 is the null op: this does exactly nothing. What is that doing there? If you see the null op, it's
       a sign that something has been optimized away after parsing.  As  we  mentioned  in  "Optimization",  the
       optimization  stage  sometimes  converts  two  operations  into  one,  for example when fetching a scalar
       variable. When this happens, instead of rewriting the op tree and cleaning up the dangling pointers, it's
       easier just to replace the redundant operation with the null op.  Originally, the tree would have  looked
       like this:

           10          SVOP (0x816b4f0) rv2sv [15]
           11              SVOP (0x816dcf0) gv  GV (0x80fa460) *x

       That  is,  fetch  the  "a" entry from the main symbol table, and then look at the scalar component of it:
       "gvsv" ("pp_gvsv" in <u>pp_hot.c</u>) happens to do both these things.

       The right hand side, starting at line 5 is similar to  what  we've  just  seen:  we  have  the  "add"  op
       ("pp_add", also in <u>pp_hot.c</u>) add together two "gvsv"s.

       Now, what's this about?

            1  LISTOP (0x8179888) leave
            2      OP (0x81798b0) enter
            3      COP (0x8179850) nextstate

       "enter"  and  "leave"  are scoping ops, and their job is to perform any housekeeping every time you enter
       and leave a block: lexical variables are tidied up, unreferenced variables  are  destroyed,  and  so  on.
       Every  program  will  have  those  first  three  lines:  "leave"  is a list, and its children are all the
       statements in the block. Statements are  delimited  by  "nextstate",  so  a  block  is  a  collection  of
       "nextstate"  ops,  with  the  ops  to  be performed for each statement being the children of "nextstate".
       "enter" is a single op which functions as a marker.

       That's how Perl parsed the program, from top to bottom:

                               Program
                                  |
                              Statement
                                  |
                                  =
                                 / \
                                /   \
                               $x   +
                                   / \
                                 $y   $z

       However, it's impossible to <b>perform</b> the operations in this order: you have to find the values of  $y  and
       $z  before you add them together, for instance. So, the other thread that runs through the op tree is the
       execution order: each op has a field "op_next" which points to the next op to be run, so following  these
       pointers  tells  us  how  perl executes the code. We can traverse the tree in this order using the "exec"
       option to "B::Terse":

            % perl -MO=Terse,exec -e '$x=$y+$z'
            1  OP (0x8179928) enter
            2  COP (0x81798c8) nextstate
            3  SVOP (0x81796c8) gvsv  GV (0x80fa4d4) *y
            4  SVOP (0x8179798) gvsv  GV (0x80efeb0) *z
            5  BINOP (0x8179878) add [1]
            6  SVOP (0x816dd38) gvsv  GV (0x80fa468) *x
            7  BINOP (0x81798a0) sassign
            8  LISTOP (0x8179900) leave

       This probably makes more sense for a human: enter a block, start a statement. Get the values  of  $y  and
       $z, and add them together.  Find $x, and assign one to the other. Then leave.

       The  way  Perl builds up these op trees in the parsing process can be unravelled by examining <u>toke.c</u>, the
       lexer, and <u>perly.y</u>, the YACC grammar. Let's look at the code that constructs the tree for $x = $y + $z.

       First, we'll look at the "Perl_yylex" function in the lexer. We want to look for "case 'x'", where  x  is
       the  first  character  of the operator.  (Incidentally, when looking for the code that handles a keyword,
       you'll want to search for "KEY_foo" where "foo" is the keyword.) Here is the code that handles assignment
       (there are quite a few operators beginning with "=", so most of it is omitted for brevity):

            1    case '=':
            2        s++;
                     ... code that handles == =&gt; etc. and pod ...
            3        pl_yylval.ival = 0;
            4        OPERATOR(ASSIGNOP);

       We can see on line 4 that our token type is "ASSIGNOP" ("OPERATOR" is a macro, defined  in  <u>toke.c</u>,  that
       returns the token type, among other things). And "+":

            1     case '+':
            2         {
            3             const char tmp = *s++;
                          ... code for ++ ...
            4             if (PL_expect == XOPERATOR) {
                              ...
            5                 Aop(OP_ADD);
            6             }
                          ...
            7         }

       Line  4  checks  what  type  of  token  we are expecting. "Aop" returns a token.  If you search for "Aop"
       elsewhere in <u>toke.c</u>, you will see that it returns an "ADDOP" token.

       Now that we know the two token types we want to look for in the parser, let's take the piece  of  <u>perly.y</u>
       we need to construct the tree for "$x = $y + $z"

           1 term    :   term ASSIGNOP term
           2                { $$ = newASSIGNOP(OPf_STACKED, $1, $2, $3); }
           3         |   term ADDOP term
           4                { $$ = newBINOP($2, 0, scalar($1), scalar($3)); }

       If  you're  not  used  to  reading  BNF  grammars, this is how it works: You're fed certain things by the
       tokeniser, which generally end up in upper  case.  "ADDOP"  and  "ASSIGNOP"  are  examples  of  "terminal
       symbols", because you can't get any simpler than them.

       The  grammar,  lines  one  and  three of the snippet above, tells you how to build up more complex forms.
       These complex forms, "non-terminal symbols" are generally placed in lower case. "term"  here  is  a  non-
       terminal symbol, representing a single expression.

       The  grammar gives you the following rule: you can make the thing on the left of the colon if you see all
       the things on the right in sequence.  This is called  a  "reduction",  and  the  aim  of  parsing  is  to
       completely  reduce  the input. There are several different ways you can perform a reduction, separated by
       vertical bars: so, "term" followed by "=" followed by "term" makes a "term", and "term" followed  by  "+"
       followed by "term" can also make a "term".

       So,  if  you  see two terms with an "=" or "+", between them, you can turn them into a single expression.
       When you do this, you execute the code in the block on the next line: if you see "=", you'll do the  code
       in line 2. If you see "+", you'll do the code in line 4. It's this code which contributes to the op tree.

                   |   term ADDOP term
                   { $$ = newBINOP($2, 0, scalar($1), scalar($3)); }

       What this does is creates a new binary op, and feeds it a number of variables. The variables refer to the
       tokens:  $1  is  the  first  token  in  the  input,  $2  the second, and so on - think regular expression
       backreferences. $$ is the op returned from this reduction. So, we call "newBINOP" to create a new  binary
       operator.  The  first  parameter  to  "newBINOP",  a  function  in <u>op.c</u>, is the op type. It's an addition
       operator, so we want the type to be "ADDOP". We could specify this directly, but it's right there as  the
       second  token  in  the  input,  so  we  use  $2. The second parameter is the op's flags: 0 means "nothing
       special". Then the things to add: the left and right hand side of our expression, in scalar context.

       The functions that create ops, which have names like "newUNOP" and "newBINOP", call  a  "check"  function
       associated  with each op type, before returning the op. The check functions can mangle the op as they see
       fit, and even replace it with an entirely new one. These functions  are  defined  in  <u>op.c</u>,  and  have  a
       "Perl_ck_"  prefix.  You can find out which check function is used for a particular op type by looking in
       <u>regen/opcodes</u>.  Take "OP_ADD", for example. ("OP_ADD" is the token value from the Aop(OP_ADD)  in  <u>toke.c</u>
       which the parser passes to "newBINOP" as its first argument.) Here is the relevant line:

           add             addition (+)            ck_null         IfsT2   S S

       The  check function in this case is "Perl_ck_null", which does nothing.  Let's look at a more interesting
       case:

           readline        &lt;HANDLE&gt;                ck_readline     t%      F?

       And here is the function from <u>op.c</u>:

            1 OP *
            2 Perl_ck_readline(pTHX_ OP *o)
            3 {
            4     PERL_ARGS_ASSERT_CK_READLINE;
            5
            6     if (o-&gt;op_flags &amp; OPf_KIDS) {
            7          OP *kid = cLISTOPo-&gt;op_first;
            8          if (kid-&gt;op_type == OP_RV2GV)
            9              kid-&gt;op_private |= OPpALLOW_FAKE;
           10     }
           11     else {
           12         OP * const newop
           13             = newUNOP(OP_READLINE, 0, newGVOP(OP_GV, 0,
           14                                               PL_argvgv));
           15         op_free(o);
           16         return newop;
           17     }
           18     return o;
           19 }

       One particularly interesting aspect is that if the op has no kids (i.e., readline() or "&lt;&gt;")  the  op  is
       freed and replaced with an entirely new one that references *ARGV (lines 12-16).

</pre><h4><b>STACKS</b></h4><pre>
       When perl executes something like "addop", how does it pass on its results to the next op? The answer is,
       through  the  use  of  stacks. Perl has a number of stacks to store things it's currently working on, and
       we'll look at the three most important ones here.

   <b>Argument</b> <b>stack</b>
       Arguments are passed to PP code and returned from PP code using the argument stack, "ST". The typical way
       to handle arguments is to pop them off the stack, deal with them how you wish, and then push  the  result
       back onto the stack. This is how, for instance, the cosine operator works:

             NV value;
             value = POPn;
             value = Perl_cos(value);
             XPUSHn(value);

       We'll  see  a  more  tricky example of this when we consider Perl's macros below. "POPn" gives you the NV
       (floating point value) of the top SV on the stack: the $x in cos($x). Then we  compute  the  cosine,  and
       push the result back as an NV. The "X" in "XPUSHn" means that the stack should be extended if necessary -
       it can't be necessary here, because we know there's room for one more item on the stack, since we've just
       removed one! The "XPUSH*" macros at least guarantee safety.

       Alternatively,  you  can fiddle with the stack directly: "SP" gives you the first element in your portion
       of the stack, and "TOP*" gives you the top SV/IV/NV/etc. on the stack. So,  for  instance,  to  do  unary
       negation of an integer:

            SETi(-TOPi);

       Just set the integer value of the top stack entry to its negation.

       Argument stack manipulation in the core is exactly the same as it is in XSUBs - see perlxstut, perlxs and
       perlguts for a longer description of the macros used in stack manipulation.

   <b>Mark</b> <b>stack</b>
       I  say  "your  portion  of  the  stack"  above because PP code doesn't necessarily get the whole stack to
       itself: if your function calls another function, you'll only want to expose the arguments aimed  for  the
       called  function,  and  not  (necessarily)  let it get at your own data.  The way we do this is to have a
       "virtual" bottom-of-stack, exposed to each function. The mark stack keeps bookmarks to locations  in  the
       argument  stack  usable  by  each function. For instance, when dealing with a tied variable, (internally,
       something with "P" magic) Perl has to call methods for accesses to the tied variables. However,  we  need
       to  separate  the  arguments exposed to the method to the argument exposed to the original function - the
       store or fetch or whatever it may be.  Here's roughly how the tied "push" is implemented;  see  "av_push"
       in <u>av.c</u>:

            1  PUSHMARK(SP);
            2  EXTEND(SP,2);
            3  PUSHs(SvTIED_obj((SV*)av, mg));
            4  PUSHs(val);
            5  PUTBACK;
            6  ENTER;
            7  call_method("PUSH", G_SCALAR|G_DISCARD);
            8  LEAVE;

       Let's examine the whole implementation, for practice:

            1  PUSHMARK(SP);

       Push  the  current  state  of  the stack pointer onto the mark stack. This is so that when we've finished
       adding items to the argument stack, Perl knows how many things we've added recently.

            2  EXTEND(SP,2);
            3  PUSHs(SvTIED_obj((SV*)av, mg));
            4  PUSHs(val);

       We're going to add two more items onto the argument stack:  when  you  have  a  tied  array,  the  "PUSH"
       subroutine  receives  the  object  and the value to be pushed, and that's exactly what we have here - the
       tied object, retrieved with "SvTIED_obj", and the value, the SV "val".

            5  PUTBACK;

       Next we tell Perl to update the global stack pointer from our internal variable: "dSP"  only  gave  us  a
       local copy, not a reference to the global.

            6  ENTER;
            7  call_method("PUSH", G_SCALAR|G_DISCARD);
            8  LEAVE;

       "ENTER"  and  "LEAVE"  localise  a  block  of  code  -  they  make sure that all variables are tidied up,
       everything that has been localised gets its previous value returned, and so on. Think of them as the  "{"
       and "}" of a Perl block.

       To  actually  do  the  magic method call, we have to call a subroutine in Perl space: "call_method" takes
       care of that, and it's described in perlcall. We call the "PUSH" method  in  scalar  context,  and  we're
       going  to discard its return value. The <b>call_method()</b> function removes the top element of the mark stack,
       so there is nothing for the caller to clean up.

   <b>Save</b> <b>stack</b>
       C doesn't have a concept of local scope, so perl provides one. We've seen that "ENTER"  and  "LEAVE"  are
       used as scoping braces; the save stack implements the C equivalent of, for example:

           {
               local $foo = 42;
               ...
           }

       See "Localizing changes" in perlguts for how to use the save stack.

</pre><h4><b>MILLIONS</b> <b>OF</b> <b>MACROS</b></h4><pre>
       One thing you'll notice about the Perl source is that it's full of macros. Some have called the pervasive
       use  of  macros the hardest thing to understand, others find it adds to clarity. Let's take an example, a
       stripped-down version the code which implements the addition operator:

          1  PP(pp_add)
          2  {
          3      dSP; dATARGET;
          4      tryAMAGICbin_MG(add_amg, AMGf_assign|AMGf_numeric);
          5      {
          6        dPOPTOPnnrl_ul;
          7        SETn( left + right );
          8        RETURN;
          9      }
         10  }

       Every line here (apart from the braces, of course) contains a macro.  The first line sets up the function
       declaration as Perl expects for PP code; line 3 sets up variable declarations for the argument stack  and
       the  target,  the  return  value  of  the  operation.  Line  4  tries to see if the addition operation is
       overloaded; if so, the appropriate subroutine is called.

       Line 6 is another variable declaration - all variable declarations start with "d" - which pops  from  the
       top of the argument stack two NVs (hence "nn") and puts them into the variables "right" and "left", hence
       the "rl". These are the two operands to the addition operator.  Next, we call "SETn" to set the NV of the
       return value to the result of adding the two values. This done, we return - the "RETURN" macro makes sure
       that  our  return  value  is  properly handled, and we pass the next operator to run back to the main run
       loop.

       Most of these macros are explained in perlapi, and some of the  more  important  ones  are  explained  in
       perlxs as well. Pay special attention to "Background and MULTIPLICITY" in perlguts for information on the
       "[pad]THX_?" macros.
