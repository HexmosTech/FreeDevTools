       opafabricinfo

       Provides  a brief summary of the components in the fabric, using the first active port on the given local
       host to perform its analysis. opafabricinfo is supplied in both:

       •      Intel(R) Omni-Path Fabric Suite FastFabric Toolset In this situation, the command can manage  more
              than one fabric (subnet).

       •      FastFabric Tools In this situation, the command performs analysis against the first active port on
              the system only. It takes no options and uses no environment variables.

       opafabricinfo can be very useful as a quick assessment of the fabric state. It can be run against a known
       good fabric to identify its components and then later run to see if anything has changed about the fabric
       configuration or state.

       For  more  extensive  fabric analysis, use opareport, opareports, and opatop. These tools can be found in
       the <u>Intel(R)</u> <u>Omni-Path</u> <u>Fabric</u> <u>Suite</u> <u>FastFabric</u> <u>User</u> <u>Guide</u>

</pre><h4><b>Syntax</b></h4><pre>
       opafabricinfo [-t  <u>portsfile</u>] [-p  <u>ports</u>]

</pre><h4><b>Options</b></h4><pre>
       --help

                 Produces full help text.

       -t <u>portsfile</u>

                 Specifies the file with list of local HFI ports used to access fabric(s) for analysis.  Default
                 is /etc/opa/ports file.

       -p <u>ports</u>

                 Specifies the list of local HFI ports used to access fabrics for analysis.

                 Default  is first active port. The first HFI in the system is 1. The first port on an HFI is 1.
                 Uses the format hfi:port,
                 for example:

                 0:0       First active port in system.

                 0:y       Port <u>y</u> within system.

                 x:0       First active port on HFI <u>x</u>.

                 x:y       HFI <u>x</u>, port <u>y</u>.

</pre><h4><b>Environment</b> <b>Variables</b></h4><pre>
       The following environment variables are also used by this command:

       <b>PORTS</b>

                 List of ports, used in absence of -t and -p.

       <b>PORTS_FILE</b>

                 File containing list of ports, used in absence of -t and -p.

                 For simple fabrics, the Intel(R) Omni-Path Fabric Suite FastFabric Toolset host is connected to
                 a single fabric. By default, the first active port on the FastFabric Toolset host  is  used  to
                 analyze  the  fabric.  However,  in  more  complex  fabrics, the FastFabric Toolset host may be
                 connected to more than one fabric or subnet. In this case, you can specify the ports or HFIs to
                 use with one of the following methods:

                 •      On the command line using the -p option.

                 •      In a file specified using the -t option.

                 •      Through the environment variables <b>PORTS</b> or <b>PORTS_FILE</b>.

                 •      Using the ports_file configuration option in opafastfabric.conf.

                 If the specified port does not exist or is empty, the first active port on the local system  is
                 used.  In  more complex configurations, you must specify the exact ports to use for all fabrics
                 to be analyzed.

</pre><h4><b>Example</b></h4><pre>
       opafabricinfo

       opafabricinfo -p '1:1 1:2 2:1 2:2'

       <b>Output</b> <b>example</b>

       # opafabricinfo

       Fabric 0:0 Information:

       SM: hds1fnb6241 hfi1_0 Guid: 0x0011750101575ffe State: Master

       Number of HFIs: 8

       Number of Switches: 1

       Number of Links: 8

       Number of HFI Links: 8              (Internal: 0 External: 8)

       Number of ISLs: 0                   (Internal: 0 External: 0)

       Number of Degraded Links: 0         (HFI Links: 0 ISLs: 0)

</pre><h4><b>Output</b> <b>Definitions</b></h4><pre>
       SM

                 Each subnet manger (SM) running in the fabric is listed along with its node  name,  port  GUID,
                 and present SM state (Master, Standby, etc.).

       Number of HFIs

                 Number of unique host fabric interfaces (HFIs) in the fabric. An FI with two connected ports is
                 counted as a single FI.

              <b>NOTE:</b>
              Fabric Interfaces include HFIs in servers as well as HFIs within I/O Modules, Native Storage, etc.

       Number of Switches

                 Number of connected switches in the fabric.

       Number of Links

                 Number of links in the fabric. Note that a large switch may have internal links.

       Number of HFI Links

                 Number of HFI links (Internal and External) in the fabric.

       Number of ISLs

                 Number of Interswitch Links (Internal and External) in the fabric.

       Number of Degraded Links

                 Number of degraded links (HSI and ISL) in the fabric.

       Number of Omitted Links
