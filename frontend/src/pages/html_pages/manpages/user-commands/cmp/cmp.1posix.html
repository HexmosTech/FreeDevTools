</pre><h4><b>PROLOG</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       cmp — compare two files

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       cmp <b>[</b>-l|-s<b>]</b> <u>file1</u> <u>file2</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>cmp</u> utility shall compare two files. The <u>cmp</u> utility shall write no output if the files are the same.
       Under  default  options,  if  they  differ, it shall write to standard output the byte and line number at
       which the first difference occurred. Bytes and lines shall be numbered beginning with 1.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>cmp</u> utility shall conform to the Base Definitions  volume  of  POSIX.1‐2017,  <u>Section</u>  <u>12.2</u>,  <u>Utility</u>
       <u>Syntax</u> <u>Guidelines</u>.

       The following options shall be supported:

       <b>-l</b>        (Lowercase  ell.)  Write  the  byte  number  (decimal) and the differing bytes (octal) for each
                 difference.

       <b>-s</b>        Write nothing to standard output or standard error when files differ; indicate differing  files
                 through  exit  status  only.   It  is  unspecified  whether  a diagnostic message is written to
                 standard error when an error is encountered;  if  a  message  is  not  written,  the  error  is
                 indicated through exit status only.

</pre><h4><b>OPERANDS</b></h4><pre>
       The following operands shall be supported:

       <u>file1</u>     A pathname of the first file to be compared. If <u>file1</u> is <b>'-'</b>, the standard input shall be used.

       <u>file2</u>     A  pathname  of  the  second  file to be compared. If <u>file2</u> is <b>'-'</b>, the standard input shall be
                 used.

       If both <u>file1</u> and <u>file2</u> refer to standard input or refer to the same  FIFO  special,  block  special,  or
       character special file, the results are undefined.

</pre><h4><b>STDIN</b></h4><pre>
       The  standard  input  shall  be used only if the <u>file1</u> or <u>file2</u> operand refers to standard input. See the
       INPUT FILES section.

</pre><h4><b>INPUT</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       The input files can be any file type.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of <u>cmp</u>:

       <u>LANG</u>      Provide a default value for the internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See the
                 Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <u>Section</u> <u>8.2</u>, <u>Internationalization</u>  <u>Variables</u>  for  the
                 precedence   of   internationalization  variables  used  to  determine  the  values  of  locale
                 categories.)

       <u>LC_ALL</u>    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values of all the  other  internationalization
                 variables.

       <u>LC_CTYPE</u>  Determine  the  locale  for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of text data as characters
                 (for example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments).

       <u>LC_MESSAGES</u>
                 Determine the locale that should be used to  affect  the  format  and  contents  of  diagnostic
                 messages written to standard error and informative messages written to standard output.

       <u>NLSPATH</u>   Determine the location of message catalogs for the processing of <u>LC_MESSAGES</u>.

</pre><h4><b>ASYNCHRONOUS</b> <b>EVENTS</b></h4><pre>
       Default.

</pre><h4><b>STDOUT</b></h4><pre>
       In  the  POSIX locale, results of the comparison shall be written to standard output. When no options are
       used, the format shall be:

           "%s %s differ: char %d, line %d\n", <u>file1</u>, <u>file2</u>,
               &lt;<u>byte</u> <u>number</u>&gt;, &lt;<u>line</u> <u>number</u>&gt;

       When the <b>-l</b> option is used, the format shall be:

           "%d %o %o\n", &lt;<u>byte</u> <u>number</u>&gt;, &lt;<u>differing</u> <u>byte</u>&gt;,
               &lt;<u>differing</u> <u>byte</u>&gt;

       for each byte that differs. The first &lt;<u>differing</u> <u>byte</u>&gt; number is from <u>file1</u>  while  the  second  is  from
       <u>file2</u>.  In both cases, &lt;<u>byte</u> <u>number</u>&gt; shall be relative to the beginning of the file, beginning with 1.

       No output shall be written to standard output when the <b>-s</b> option is used.

</pre><h4><b>STDERR</b></h4><pre>
       The  standard  error  shall  be used only for diagnostic messages. If the <b>-l</b> option is used and <u>file1</u> and
       <u>file2</u> differ in length, or if the <b>-s</b> option is not used and <u>file1</u> and <u>file2</u> are identical for the  entire
       length of the shorter file, in the POSIX locale the following diagnostic message shall be written:

           "cmp: EOF on %s%s\n", &lt;<u>name</u> <u>of</u> <u>shorter</u> <u>file</u>&gt;, &lt;<u>additional</u> <u>info</u>&gt;

       The  &lt;<u>additional</u> <u>info</u>&gt;  field shall either be null or a string that starts with a &lt;blank&gt; and contains no
       &lt;newline&gt; characters. Some implementations report on the number of lines in this case.

       If the <b>-s</b> option is used and an error occurs, it is unspecified whether a diagnostic message  is  written
       to standard error.

</pre><h4><b>OUTPUT</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>EXTENDED</b> <b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       The following exit values shall be returned:

        0    The files are identical.

        1    The  files  are  different; this includes the case where one file is identical to the first part of
             the other.

       &gt;1    An error occurred.

</pre><h4><b>CONSEQUENCES</b> <b>OF</b> <b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       Default.

       <u>The</u> <u>following</u> <u>sections</u> <u>are</u> <u>informative.</u>

</pre><h4><b>APPLICATION</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       Although input files to <u>cmp</u> can be any type, the results might not be what would be expected on character
       special device files or on file types not described by the  System  Interfaces  volume  of  POSIX.1‐2017.
       Since  this  volume of POSIX.1‐2017 does not specify the block size used when doing input, comparisons of
       character special files need not compare all of the data in those files.

       For files which are not text files, line numbers simply reflect the presence of a &lt;newline&gt;, without  any
       implication that the file is organized into lines.

       Since  the  behavior  of <b>-s</b> differs between implementations as to whether error messages are written, the
       only way to ensure consistent behavior of <u>cmp</u> when <b>-s</b> is used is to redirect standard error to <b>/dev/null</b>.

       If error messages are wanted, instead of using <b>-s</b> standard output should be redirected to <b>/dev/null</b>,  and
       anything written to standard error should be discarded if the exit status is 1. For example:

           silent_cmp() {
               # compare files with no output except error messages
               message=$(cmp "$@" 2&gt;&amp;1 &gt;/dev/null)
               status=$?
               case $status in
               (0|1) ;;
               (*) printf '%s\n' "$message" ;;
               esac
               return $status
           }

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>RATIONALE</b></h4><pre>
       The  global  language  in  <u>Section</u>  <u>1.4</u>,  <u>Utility</u> <u>Description</u> <u>Defaults</u> indicates that using two mutually-
       exclusive options together produces unspecified results.  Some  System  V  implementations  consider  the
       option usage:

           cmp -l -s ...

       to be an error. They also treat:

           cmp -s -l ...

       as if no options were specified. Both of these behaviors are considered bugs, but are allowed.

       The  word  <b>char</b>  in  the standard output format comes from historical usage, even though it is actually a
       byte number. When <u>cmp</u> is supported in other locales, implementations are encouraged to use the word  <u>byte</u>
       or  its  equivalent  in another language. Users should not interpret this difference to indicate that the
       functionality of the utility changed between locales.

       Some implementations report on the number of lines  in  the  identical-but-shorter  file  case.  This  is
       allowed  by the inclusion of the &lt;<u>additional</u> <u>info</u>&gt; fields in the output format. The restriction on having
       a leading &lt;blank&gt; and no &lt;newline&gt; characters  is  to  make  parsing  for  the  filename  easier.  It  is
       recognized  that  some filenames containing white-space characters make parsing difficult anyway, but the
       restriction does aid programs used on systems where the names are predominantly well behaved.

</pre><h4><b>FUTURE</b> <b>DIRECTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Future versions of this standard may require that diagnostic messages are written to standard error  when
       the <b>-s</b> option is specified.
