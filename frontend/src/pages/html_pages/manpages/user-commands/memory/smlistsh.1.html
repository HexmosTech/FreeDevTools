       smlistsh - shared-memory linked list test shell

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>smlistsh</b> <u>partition_size</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>smlistsh</b> attaches to a region of system memory (allocating it if necessary, and placing it under PSM
       management as necessary) and offers the user an interactive "shell" for testing various shared-memory
       linked list management functions.

       <b>smlistsh</b> prints a prompt string (": ") to stdout, accepts a command from stdin, executes the command
       (possibly printing a diagnostic message), then prints another prompt string and so on.

       The following commands are supported:

       <b>h</b>   The  <b>help</b>  command.   Causes <b>smlistsh</b> to print a summary of available commands.  Same effect as the <b>?</b>
           command.

       <b>?</b>   Another <b>help</b> command.  Causes <b>smlistsh</b> to print a summary of available commands.  Same effect as  the
           <b>h</b> command.

       <b>k</b>   The <b>key</b> command.  Computes and prints an unused shared-memory key, for possible use in attaching to a
           shared-memory region.

       <b>+</b> <u>key_value</u> <u>size</u>
           The  <b>attach</b>  command.   Attaches  <b>smlistsh</b>  to  a  region  of shared memory.  <u>key_value</u> identifies an
           existing shared-memory region, in the event that you want to  attach  to  an  existing  shared-memory
           region  (possibly  created  by another <b>smlistsh</b> process running on the same computer).  To create and
           attach to a new shared-memory region that other processes can attach to, use a <u>key_value</u> as  returned
           by  the <b>key</b> command and supply the <u>size</u> of the new region.  If you want to create and attach to a new
           shared-memory region that is for strictly private use, use -1 as key and supply the <u>size</u> of  the  new
           region.

       <b>-</b>   The  <b>detach</b>  command.   Detaches <b>smlistsh</b> from the region of shared memory it is currently using, but
           does not free any memory.

       <b>n</b>   The <b>new</b> command.  Creates a new shared-memory list to  operate  on,  within  the  currently  attached
           shared-memory region.  Prints the address of the list.

       <b>s</b> <u>list_address</u>
           The  <b>share</b>  command.   Selects  an  existing  shared-memory  list to operate on, within the currently
           attached shared-memory region.

       <b>a</b> <u>element_value</u>
           The <b>append</b> command.  Appends a new list element, containing  <u>element_value</u>,  to  the  list  on  which
           <b>smlistsh</b> is currently operating.

       <b>p</b> <u>element_value</u>
           The  <b>prepend</b>  command.   Prepends  a new list element, containing <u>element_value</u>, to the list on which
           <b>smlistsh</b> is currently operating.

       <b>w</b>   The <b>walk</b> command.  Prints the addresses and contents of all elements of the list on which <b>smlistsh</b> is
           currently operating.

       <b>f</b> <u>element_value</u>
           The <b>find</b> command.  Finds the list element that contains  <u>element_value</u>,  within  the  list  on  which
           <b>smlistsh</b> is currently operating, and prints the address of that list element.

       <b>d</b> <u>element_address</u>
           The <b>delete</b> command.  Deletes the list element located at <u>element_address</u>.

       <b>r</b>   The <b>report</b> command.  Prints a partition usage report, as per <u><a href="../man3/psm_report.3.html">psm_report</a></u>(3).

       <b>q</b>   The  <b>quit</b> command.  Detaches <b>smlistsh</b> from the region of shared memory it is currently using (without
           freeing any memory) and terminates <b>smlistsh</b>.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       "0" <b>smlistsh</b> has terminated.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       No configuration files are needed.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       No environment variables apply.

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       No diagnostics apply.
