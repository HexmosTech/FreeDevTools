</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       ipmctl-show-goal - Shows the memory allocation goal on one or more PMem modules

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           ipmctl show [OPTIONS] -goal [TARGETS] [PROPERTIES]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Shows the memory allocation goal on one or more PMem modules. Once the goal is successfully applied by
       the platform firmware (BIOS), it is no longer displayed. Use the command [Show Memory Resources] to view
       the system-wide memory resources or the command [Show Persistent Memory] for detailed persistent memory
       information.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       -a, -all
           Shows all attributes.

           <b>Note</b>

           The all and display options are exclusive and may not be used together.

       -d (attributes), -display (attributes)
           Filters the returned attributes by explicitly specifying a comma separated list of any of the
           attributes defined in the Return Data section.

           <b>Note</b>

           The all and display options are exclusive and may not be used together.

       -h, -help
           Displays help for the command.

       -ddrt
           Used to specify DDRT as the desired transport protocol for the current invocation of ipmctl.

       -smbus
           Used to specify SMBUS as the desired transport protocol for the current invocation of ipmctl.

           <b>Note</b>

           The -ddrt and -smbus options are mutually exclusive and may not be used together.

       -o (text|nvmxml), -output (text|nvmxml)
           Changes the output format. One of: "text" (default) or "nvmxml".

       -u (B|MB|MiB|GB|GiB|TB| TiB), -units (B|MB|MiB|GB|GiB|TB| TiB)
           Changes the units that capacities are displayed in for this command. One of: bytes (B), megabytes
           (MB), mebibytes (MiB), gigabytes (GB), gibibytes (GiB), terabytes (TB) or tebibytes (TiB).

</pre><h4><b>TARGETS</b></h4><pre>
       -dimm [DimmIDs]
           Restricts output to specific PMem modules by supplying one or more comma separated PMem module
           identifiers. The default is to display all manageable PMem modules with memory allocation goals.

       -socket [SocketIDs]
           Restricts output to the PMem modules on specific sockets by supplying the socket target and one or
           more comma separated socket identifiers. The default is to display all manageable PMem modules on all
           sockets with memory allocation goals.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Shows the default memory allocation goal attributes for each PMem module.

           ipmctl show -goal

       Shows all the memory allocation goal attributes for the PMem modules on socket 1.

           ipmctl show -a -goal -socket 1

</pre><h4><b>LIMITATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       In order to successfully execute this command:

       •   The caller must have the appropriate privileges.

       •   The specified PMem modules must be manageable by the host software.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>DATA</b></h4><pre>
       The default behavior is to display a table with the default attributes for each PMem module; applying
       options changes the output to a more detailed format.

       SocketID
           (Default) The processor socket identifier where the PMem module is installed.

       DimmID
           (Default) The PMem module identifier

       MemorySize
           (Default) The PMem module capacity that will be configured in Memory Mode.

       AppDirect1Size
           (Default) The PMem module capacity that will be configured as the first App Direct interleave set if
           applicable.

       AppDirect1Index
           Unique identifier of the first App Direct interleave set.

           •   N/A: If no App Direct interleave set

           •   Numeric value if App Direct interleave set is present.

       AppDirect1Settings
           The settings for the first App Direct interleave set in the format: x(Way) [- (Size) iMC] [x (Size)
           Channel]

       AppDirect2Size
           (Default) The PMem module capacity that will be configured as the second App Direct interleave set if
           applicable.

       AppDirect2Index
           Unique identifier of the second App Direct interleave set.

           •   N/A: If no App Direct interleave set

           •   Numeric value if App Direct interleave set is present.

       AppDirect2Settings
           The settings for the second App Direct interleave set in the format: x(Way) [- (Size) iMC] [x (Size)
           Channel]

       Status
           The status of the memory allocation goal. One of:

           •   Unknown: The status cannot be determined.

           •   New: A reboot is required for the memory allocation goal to be processed by the BIOS.

           •   Failed - Bad request: The BIOS failed to process the memory allocation goal because it was
               invalid.

           •   Failed - Not enough resources: There were not enough resources for the BIOS to process the memory
               allocation goal.

           •   Failed - Firmware error: The BIOS failed to process the memory allocation goal due to a firmware
               error.

           •   Failed - Unknown: The BIOS failed to process the memory allocation goal due to an unknown error.

</pre><h4><b>SAMPLE</b> <b>OUTPUT</b></h4><pre>
       If a new memory allocation goal has been created, a prompt to reboot will be presented.

           A reboot is required to process new memory allocation goals.
