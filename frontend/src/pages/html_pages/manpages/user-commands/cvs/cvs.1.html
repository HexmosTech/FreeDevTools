       cvs - Concurrent Versions System

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>cvs</b> [ <u>cvs_options</u> ]
              <u>cvs_command</u> [ <u>command_options</u> ] [ <u>command_args</u> ]

</pre><h4><b>NOTE</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  is  a  summary  of parts of the <b>cvs</b> documentation and automatically generated from an
       appendix of the CVS manual (the <u>Cederqvist</u>), which is also the target of all  cross-references  found  in
       this  manual  page; please refer to the full CVS manual for more in-depth documentation of the Concurrent
       Versions System.

       If you're reading this manual page as part of the MirBSD online (HTML) manual pages archive,  follow  the
       cvs(GNU)  link  to the Cederqvist (and the cvsclient(GNU) link to the client/server protocol description,
       if necessary).

       If you installed <b>cvs</b> via the Debian or MirPorts Framework package management systems,
              <b>/usr/mpkg/share/doc/cvs/cvs.pdf</b> (MirPorts Framework) or
              <b>/usr/share/doc/cvs/cvs.pdf</b> (Debian), respectively,
       are versions of the Cederqvist rendered as books, for printing and reading on screen.

       If you have a Texinfo reader such as <b>info</b> installed (part of the base system on MirBSD; part of the  <u>info</u>
       package on Debian), you can read the Cederqvist by entering:
              <b>info</b> <u>cvs</u>

       Quick introduction to <b>info</b> so you aren't immediately lost:

           <u>arrow</u> <u>keys</u>
              to move on the page

           <u>Tab</u>
              to move to the next hyperlink

           <u>Return</u>
              to activate the hyperlink under the cursor

           <b>l</b> <u>(lowercase</u> <u>ell)</u>
              to go to the previously visited page

           <u>Page</u> <u>Up/</u><b>b,</b> <u>Page</u> <u>Down/Space</u>
              to  move  by  screen pages, including advancing to the previous (or next, respectively) section at
              the first (last) screen page

           <b>p,</b> <b>n</b>
              to go to the previous (next) page on the current navigation hierarchy level

           <b>t</b>  to go to the "Top" page, i.e. the start of the document

           <b>/</b><u>&lt;search-term&gt;Return</u>
              to start a search from the current cursor position and jump to the first result

           <b>/</b><u>Return</u>
              to jump to the next result in an ongoing search

           <b>q</b>  to exit the <b>info</b> viewer

</pre><h4><b>CVS</b> <b>commands</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Guide</b> <b>to</b> <b>CVS</b> <b>commands</b>
       This appendix describes the overall structure of <b>cvs</b> commands, and  describes  some  commands  in  detail
       (others  are  described  elsewhere; for a quick reference to <b>cvs</b> commands, see node 'Invoking CVS' in the
       CVS manual, and for an alphabetical list of all <b>cvs</b> commands, see node 'CVS  command  list'  in  the  CVS
       manual).

</pre><h4><b>Structure</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Overall</b> <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> <b>CVS</b> <b>commands</b>
       The overall format of all <b>cvs</b> commands is:

         cvs [ cvs_options ] cvs_command [ command_options ] [ command_args ]

       <b>cvs</b>

         The name of the <b>cvs</b> program.

       <b>cvs_options</b>

         Some options that affect all sub-commands of <b>cvs</b>.  These are described below.

       <b>cvs_command</b>

         One  of  several  different  sub-commands.  Some of the commands have aliases that can be used instead;
         those aliases are noted in the reference manual for that command.  There are only two situations  where
         you  may  omit  <b>cvs_command</b>:  <b>cvs</b>  <b>-H</b> elicits a list of available commands, and <b>cvs</b> <b>-v</b> displays version
         information on <b>cvs</b> itself.

       <b>command_options</b>

         Options that are specific for the command.

       <b>command_args</b>

         Arguments to the commands.

         There is unfortunately some confusion  between  <b>cvs_options</b>  and  <b>command_options</b>.   When  given  as  a
         <b>cvs_option</b>,  some options only affect some of the commands.  When given as a <b>command_option</b> it may have
         a different meaning, and be accepted by  more  commands.   In  other  words,  do  not  take  the  above
         categorization too seriously.  Look at the documentation instead.

</pre><h4><b>Exit</b> <b>status</b></h4><pre>
   <b>CVS's</b> <b>exit</b> <b>status</b>
       <b>cvs</b>  can  indicate  to the calling environment whether it succeeded or failed by setting its <u>exit</u> <u>status</u>.
       The exact way of testing the exit status will vary from one operating system to another.  For example  in
       a  unix  shell script the <b>$?</b> variable will be 0 if the last command returned a successful exit status, or
       greater than 0 if the exit status indicated failure.

       If <b>cvs</b> is successful, it returns a successful status; if there is an error, it prints  an  error  message
       and  returns  a  failure  status.   The  one exception to this is the <b>cvs</b> <b>diff</b> command.  It will return a
       successful status if it found no differences, or a failure status if there were differences or  if  there
       was  an error.  Because this behavior provides no good way to detect errors, in the future it is possible
       that <b>cvs</b> <b>diff</b> will be changed to behave like the other <b>cvs</b> commands.

</pre><h4><b><a href="file:~/.cvsrc">~/.cvsrc</a></b></h4><pre>
   <b>Default</b> <b>options</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b><a href="file:~/.cvsrc">~/.cvsrc</a></b> <b>file</b>
       There are some <b>command_options</b> that are used so often that you might have set up an alias or  some  other
       means to make sure you always specify that option.  One example (the one that drove the implementation of
       the  <b>.cvsrc</b> support, actually) is that many people find the default output of the <b>diff</b> command to be very
       hard to read, and that either context diffs or unidiffs are much easier to understand.

       The <b><a href="file:~/.cvsrc">~/.cvsrc</a></b> file is a way that you can add default  options  to  <b>cvs_commands</b>  within  cvs,  instead  of
       relying on aliases or other shell scripts.

       The  format  of  the  <b><a href="file:~/.cvsrc">~/.cvsrc</a></b> file is simple.  The file is searched for a line that begins with the same
       name as the <b>cvs_command</b> being executed.  If a match is found, then the remainder of the line is split  up
       (at  whitespace  characters)  into separate options and added to the command arguments <u>before</u> any options
       from the command line.

       If a command has two names (e.g., <b>checkout</b> and <b>co</b>), the official name, not necessarily the  one  used  on
       the  command  line,  will  be  used  to match against the file.  So if this is the contents of the user's
       <b><a href="file:~/.cvsrc">~/.cvsrc</a></b> file:

         log -N
         diff -uN
         rdiff -u
         update -Pd
         checkout -P
         release -d

       the command <b>cvs</b> <b>checkout</b> <b>foo</b> would have the <b>-P</b> option added to the arguments, as well as <b>cvs</b> <b>co</b> <b>foo</b>.

       With the example file above, the output from <b>cvs</b> <b>diff</b> <b>foobar</b> will be in  unidiff  format.   <b>cvs</b>  <b>diff</b>  <b>-c</b>
       <b>foobar</b>  will  provide  context  diffs,  as  usual.   Getting  "old"  format  diffs would be slightly more
       complicated, because <b>diff</b> doesn't have an option to specify use of the "old" format, so  you  would  need
       <b>cvs</b> <b>-f</b> <b>diff</b> <b>foobar</b>.

       In  place of the command name you can use <b>cvs</b> to specify global options (see node 'Global options' in the
       CVS manual).  For example the following line in <b>.cvsrc</b>

         cvs -z6

       causes <b>cvs</b> to use compression level 6.

</pre><h4><b>Global</b> <b>options</b></h4><pre>
       The available <b>cvs_options</b> (that are given to the left of <b>cvs_command</b>) are:

       <b>--allow-root=</b><u>rootdir</u>

         May be invoked multiple times to specify one legal <b>cvsroot</b> directory with each invocation.  Also causes
         CVS to preparse the configuration file for each specified root, which can be  useful  when  configuring
         write  proxies,   See node 'Password authentication server' in the CVS manual &amp; node 'Write proxies' in
         the CVS manual.

       <b>-a</b>

         Authenticate all communication between the client and the server.   Only  has  an  effect  on  the  <b>cvs</b>
         client.   As of this writing, this is only implemented when using a GSSAPI connection (see node 'GSSAPI
         authenticated' in the  CVS  manual).   Authentication  prevents  certain  sorts  of  attacks  involving
         hijacking the active <b>tcp</b> connection.  Enabling authentication does not enable encryption.

       <b>-b</b> <u>bindir</u>

         In  <b>cvs</b>  1.9.18  and  older,  this  specified  that  <b>rcs</b> programs are in the <u>bindir</u> directory.  Current
         versions of <b>cvs</b> do not run <b>rcs</b> programs; for  compatibility  this  option  is  accepted,  but  it  does
         nothing.

       <b>-T</b> <u>tempdir</u>

         Use <u>tempdir</u> as the directory where temporary files are located.

         The  <b>cvs</b>  client and server store temporary files in a temporary directory.  The path to this temporary
         directory is set via, in order of precedence:

       •   The argument to the global <b>-T</b> option.

       •   The value set for <b>TmpDir</b> in the config file (server only - see node 'config' in the CVS manual).

       •   The contents of the <b>$TMPDIR</b> environment  variable  (<b>%TMPDIR%</b>  on  Windows  -  see  node  'Environment
           variables' in the CVS manual).

       •   <a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a>

           Temporary directories should always be specified as an absolute pathname.  When running a CVS client,
           <b>-T</b>  affects only the local process; specifying <b>-T</b> for the client has no effect on the server and vice
           versa.

       <b>-d</b> <u>cvs_root_directory</u>

         Use <u>cvs_root_directory</u> as the root directory pathname of the repository.  Overrides the setting of  the
         <b>$CVSROOT</b> environment variable.  See node 'Repository' in the CVS manual.

       <b>-e</b> <u>editor</u>

         Use  <u>editor</u>  to  enter  revision  log information.  Overrides the setting of the <b>$CVSEDITOR</b> and <b>$EDITOR</b>
         environment variables.  For more information, see node 'Committing your changes' in the CVS manual.

       <b>-f</b>

         Do not read the <b><a href="file:~/.cvsrc">~/.cvsrc</a></b> file.  This option is most often used because of the non-orthogonality of  the
         <b>cvs</b>  option  set.   For  example, the <b>cvs</b> <b>log</b> option <b>-N</b> (turn off display of tag names) does not have a
         corresponding option to turn the display on.  So if you have <b>-N</b> in the <b><a href="file:~/.cvsrc">~/.cvsrc</a></b> entry for <b>log</b>, you  may
         need to use <b>-f</b> to show the tag names.

       <b>-g</b>

         Forges group-writable permissions on files in the working copy.  This option is typically used when you
         have  multiple  users  sharing  a single checked out source tree, allowing them to operate their shells
         with a less dangerous umask at the expense of <b>cvs</b> security.  To use this feature, create a directory to
         hold the checked-out source tree, set it to a private group, and set up the directory such  that  files
         created  under it inherit the gid of the directory.  On BSD systems, this occurs automatically. On SYSV
         systems and GNU/Linux, the sgid bit must be set on the directory for this.  The users who are to  share
         the checked out tree must be placed in that group which owns the directory.

         Note  that  the sharing of a single checked-out source tree is very different from giving several users
         access to a common <b>cvs</b> repository.   Access  to  a  common  <b>cvs</b>  repository  already  maintains  shared
         group-write permissions and does not require this option.

         Due  to  the  security  implications,  setting  this  option  globally  in your <b>.cvsrc</b> file is strongly
         discouraged; if you must, ensure all source checkouts are "firewalled" within  a  private  group  or  a
         private mode 0700 directory.

         This option is a MidnightBSD extension merged into Debian and MirBSD <b>cvs</b>.

       <b>-H</b>

       <b>--help</b>

         Display  usage  information  about the specified <b>cvs_command</b> (but do not actually execute the command).
         If you don't specify a command name, <b>cvs</b> <b>-H</b> displays overall help for <b>cvs</b>, including a  list  of  other
         help options.

       <b>-R</b>

         Turns  on read-only repository mode.  This allows one to check out from a read-only repository, such as
         within an anoncvs server, or from a <b>cd-rom</b> repository.

         Same effect as if the <b>CVSREADONLYFS</b> environment variable is set. Using <b>-R</b> can also  considerably  speed
         up checkouts over NFS.

       <b>-n</b>

         Do not change any files.  Attempt to execute the <b>cvs_command</b>, but only to issue reports; do not remove,
         update, or merge any existing files, or create any new files.

         Note  that  <b>cvs</b>  will not necessarily produce exactly the same output as without <b>-n</b>.  In some cases the
         output will be the same, but in other cases <b>cvs</b> will skip some of the processing that would  have  been
         required to produce the exact same output.

       <b>-Q</b>

         Cause the command to be really quiet; the command will only generate output for serious problems.

       <b>-q</b>

         Cause  the  command  to be somewhat quiet; informational messages, such as reports of recursion through
         subdirectories, are suppressed.

       <b>-r</b>

         Make new working files read-only.  Same effect as if the <b>$CVSREAD</b> environment variable is set (see node
         'Environment variables' in the CVS manual).  The default is to  make  working  files  writable,  unless
         watches are on (see node 'Watches' in the CVS manual).

       <b>-s</b> <u>variable</u><b>=</b><u>value</u>

         Set a user variable (see node 'Variables' in the CVS manual).

       <b>-t</b>

         Trace  program execution; display messages showing the steps of <b>cvs</b> activity.  Particularly useful with
         <b>-n</b> to explore the potential impact of an unfamiliar command.

       <b>-v</b>

       <b>--version</b>

         Display version and copyright information for <b>cvs</b>.

       <b>-w</b>

         Make new working files read-write.  Overrides the setting of the <b>$CVSREAD</b> environment variable.   Files
         are created read-write by default, unless <b>$CVSREAD</b> is set or <b>-r</b> is given.

       <b>-x</b>

         Encrypt all communication between the client and the server.  Only has an effect on the <b>cvs</b> client.  As
         of  this  writing,  this  is  only  implemented  when  using  a  GSSAPI  connection  (see  node 'GSSAPI
         authenticated' in the CVS manual) or a Kerberos connection (see node 'Kerberos  authenticated'  in  the
         CVS  manual).   Enabling  encryption  implies  that  message traffic is also authenticated.  Encryption
         support  is  not  available  by  default;  it  must  be  enabled  using  a  special  configure  option,
         <b>--enable-encryption</b>, when you build <b>cvs</b>.

       <b>-z</b> <u>level</u>

         Request  compression  <u>level</u> for network traffic.  <b>cvs</b> interprets <u>level</u> identically to the <b>gzip</b> program.
         Valid levels are 1 (high speed, low compression) to 9 (low speed, high compression), or  0  to  disable
         compression  (the  default).  Data sent to the server will be compressed at the requested level and the
         client will request the server use the same compression level for data returned.  The server  will  use
         the  closest level allowed by the server administrator to compress returned data.  This option only has
         an effect when passed to the <b>cvs</b> client.

</pre><h4><b>Common</b> <b>options</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Common</b> <b>command</b> <b>options</b>
       This section describes the <b>command_options</b> that are available across several <b>cvs</b> commands.  These options
       are always given to the right of <b>cvs_command</b>. Not all commands support all of these options; each  option
       is  only  supported  for commands where it makes sense.  However, when a command has one of these options
       you can almost always count on the same behavior of the option as  in  other  commands.   (Other  command
       options,  which are listed with the individual commands, may have different behavior from one <b>cvs</b> command
       to the other).

       <u>Note:</u> <u>the</u> <b>history</b> <u>command</u> <u>is</u> <u>an</u> <u>exception;</u> <u>it</u>  <u>supports</u>  <u>many</u>  <u>options</u>  <u>that</u>  <u>conflict</u>  <u>even</u>  <u>with</u>  <u>these</u>
       <u>standard</u> <u>options.</u>

       <b>-D</b> <u>date_spec</u>

         Use  the  most  recent  revision  no  later  than  <u>date_spec</u>.   <u>date_spec</u>  is a single argument, a date
         description specifying a date in the past.

         The specification is <u>sticky</u> when you use it to make a private copy of a source file; that is, when  you
         get  a  working  file using <b>-D</b>, <b>cvs</b> records the date you specified, so that further updates in the same
         directory will use the same date (for more information on sticky tags/dates, see node 'Sticky tags'  in
         the CVS manual).

         <b>-D</b>  is  available  with  the  <b>annotate</b>, <b>checkout</b>, <b>diff</b>, <b>export</b>, <b>history</b>, <b>ls</b>, <b>rdiff</b>, <b>rls</b>, <b>rtag</b>, <b>tag</b>, and
         <b>update</b> commands.  (The <b>history</b> command uses this option in a slightly different way; see node  'history
         options' in the CVS manual).

         For  a  complete  description of the date formats accepted by <b>cvs</b>, see node 'Date input formats' in the
         CVS manual.

         Remember to quote the argument to the <b>-D</b> flag so that your shell doesn't interpret spaces  as  argument
         separators.  A command using the <b>-D</b> flag can look like this:

           $ cvs diff -D "1 hour ago" cvs.texinfo

       <b>-f</b>

         When  you  specify  a  particular  date  or tag to <b>cvs</b> commands, they normally ignore files that do not
         contain the tag (or did not exist prior to the date) that you specified.  Use the <b>-f</b> option if you want
         files retrieved even when there is no match for the tag or date.  (The most recent revision of the file
         will be used).

         Note that even with <b>-f</b>, a tag that you specify must exist (that is, in  some  file,  not  necessary  in
         every file).  This is so that <b>cvs</b> will continue to give an error if you mistype a tag name.

         <b>-f</b> is available with these commands: <b>annotate</b>, <b>checkout</b>, <b>export</b>, <b>rdiff</b>, <b>rtag</b>, and <b>update</b>.

         <u>WARNING:</u>   <u>The</u>  <b>commit</b>  <u>and</u>  <b>remove</b> <u>commands</u> <u>also</u> <u>have</u> <u>a</u> <b>-f</b> <u>option,</u> <u>but</u> <u>it</u> <u>has</u> <u>a</u> <u>different</u> <u>behavior</u> <u>for</u>
         <u>those</u> <u>commands.</u>  <u>See</u> <u>node</u> <u>'commit</u> <u>options'</u> <u>in</u> <u>the</u> <u>CVS</u> <u>manual,</u> <u>and</u> <u>node</u>  <u>'Removing</u>  <u>files'</u>  <u>in</u>  <u>the</u>  <u>CVS</u>
         <u>manual.</u>

       <b>-k</b> <u>kflag</u>

         Override the default processing of RCS keywords other than <b>-kb</b>.  See node 'Keyword substitution' in the
         CVS  manual,  for  the  meaning  of  <u>kflag</u>.   Used  with  the  <b>checkout</b> and <b>update</b> commands, your <u>kflag</u>
         specification is <u>sticky</u>; that is, when you use this option with  a  <b>checkout</b>  or  <b>update</b>  command,  <b>cvs</b>
         associates  your  selected  <u>kflag</u>  with  any files it operates on, and continues to use that <u>kflag</u> with
         future commands on the same files until you specify otherwise.

         The <b>-k</b> option is available with the <b>add</b>, <b>checkout</b>, <b>diff</b>, <b>export</b>, <b>import</b>, <b>rdiff</b>, and <b>update</b> commands.

         <u>WARNING:</u> <u>Prior</u> <u>to</u> <u>CVS</u> <u>version</u> <u>1.12.2,</u> <u>the</u> <b>-k</b> <u>flag</u> <u>overrode</u> <u>the</u> <b>-kb</b> <u>indication</u> <u>for</u> <u>a</u> <u>binary</u> <u>file.</u>   <u>This</u>
         <u>could</u> <u>sometimes</u> <u>corrupt</u> <u>binary</u> <u>files.</u>  <u>See</u> <u>node</u> <u>'Merging</u> <u>and</u> <u>keywords'</u> <u>in</u> <u>the</u> <u>CVS</u> <u>manual,</u> <u>for</u> <u>more.</u>

       <b>-l</b>

         Local; run only in current working directory, rather than recursing through subdirectories.

         Available  with  the  following commands: <b>annotate</b>, <b>checkout</b>, <b>commit</b>, <b>diff</b>, <b>edit</b>, <b>editors</b>, <b>export</b>, <b>log</b>,
         <b>rdiff</b>, <b>remove</b>, <b>rtag</b>, <b>status</b>, <b>tag</b>, <b>unedit</b>, <b>update</b>, <b>watch</b>, and <b>watchers</b>.

       <b>-m</b> <u>message</u>

         Use <u>message</u> as log information, instead of invoking an editor.

         Available with the following commands: <b>add</b>, <b>commit</b> and <b>import</b>.

       <b>-n</b>

         Do not run any tag program.  (A program can be specified to run  in  the  modules  database  (see  node
         'modules' in the CVS manual); this option bypasses it).

         <u>Note:</u>  <u>this</u>  <u>is</u>  <u>not</u>  <u>the</u> <u>same</u> <u>as</u> <u>the</u> <b>cvs</b> <b>-n</b> <u>program</u> <u>option,</u> <u>which</u> <u>you</u> <u>can</u> <u>specify</u> <u>to</u> <u>the</u> <u>left</u> <u>of</u> <u>a</u> <u>cvs</u>
         <u>command!</u>

         Available with the <b>checkout</b>, <b>commit</b>, <b>export</b>, and <b>rtag</b> commands.

       <b>-P</b>

         Prune empty directories.  See node 'Removing directories' in the CVS manual.

       <b>-p</b>

         Pipe the files retrieved from the repository to standard  output,  rather  than  writing  them  in  the
         current directory.  Available with the <b>checkout</b> and <b>update</b> commands.

       <b>-R</b>

         Process  directories recursively.  This is the default for all <b>cvs</b> commands, with the exception of <b>ls</b> &amp;
         <b>rls</b>.

         Available with the following commands: <b>annotate</b>, <b>checkout</b>, <b>commit</b>, <b>diff</b>,  <b>edit</b>,  <b>editors</b>,  <b>export</b>,  <b>ls</b>,
         <b>rdiff</b>, <b>remove</b>, <b>rls</b>, <b>rtag</b>, <b>status</b>, <b>tag</b>, <b>unedit</b>, <b>update</b>, <b>watch</b>, and <b>watchers</b>.

       <b>-r</b> <u>tag</u>

       <b>-r</b> <u>tag</u><b>[:</b><u>date</u><b>]</b>

         Use the revision specified by the <u>tag</u> argument (and the <u>date</u> argument for the commands which accept it)
         instead  of the default <u>head</u> revision.  As well as arbitrary tags defined with the <b>tag</b> or <b>rtag</b> command,
         two special tags are always available: <b>HEAD</b>  refers  to  the  most  recent  version  available  in  the
         repository  (also known as the tip of the <b>MAIN</b> branch, also known as trunk; the name of a branch refers
         to its tip; this version of <b>cvs</b> introduces <b>.bhead</b>, but only for the <b>diff</b> command, for  the  same),  and
         <b>BASE</b> refers to the revision you last checked out into the current working directory.

         The  tag  specification  is sticky when you use this with <b>checkout</b> or <b>update</b> to make your own copy of a
         file: <b>cvs</b> remembers the tag and continues to use it  on  future  update  commands,  until  you  specify
         otherwise (for more information on sticky tags/dates, see node 'Sticky tags' in the CVS manual).

         The  tag can be either a symbolic or numeric tag, as described in node 'Tags' in the CVS manual, or the
         name of a branch, as described in node 'Branching and merging' in the CVS manual.  When <u>tag</u> is the name
         of a branch, some commands accept the optional <u>date</u> argument to specify the revision as  of  the  given
         date on the branch.  When a command expects a specific revision, the name of a branch is interpreted as
         the most recent revision on that branch.

         As  a  Debian  and MirBSD <b>cvs</b> extension, specifying <b>BASE</b> as the <u>date</u> portion of the argument yields the
         <u>base</u> <u>revision</u> of the branch specified by the <u>tag</u> portion of the argument,  i.e.  the  revision  on  the
         parent  branch  the  <u>tag</u>  branch split off, or, where both branches were the same.  This option has not
         received very much testing, beware!

         Specifying the <b>-q</b> global option along with the <b>-r</b> command option  is  often  useful,  to  suppress  the
         warning messages when the <b>rcs</b> file does not contain the specified tag.

         <u>Note:</u>  <u>this</u>  <u>is</u>  <u>not</u>  <u>the</u> <u>same</u> <u>as</u> <u>the</u> <u>overall</u> <b>cvs</b> <b>-r</b> <u>option,</u> <u>which</u> <u>you</u> <u>can</u> <u>specify</u> <u>to</u> <u>the</u> <u>left</u> <u>of</u> <u>a</u> <b>cvs</b>
         <u>command!</u>

         <b>-r</b> <u>tag</u> is available with the <b>commit</b> and <b>history</b> commands.

         <b>-r</b> <u>tag</u><b>[:</b><u>date</u><b>]</b> is available with the <b>annotate</b>, <b>checkout</b>, <b>diff</b>, <b>export</b>, <b>rdiff</b>, <b>rtag</b>, and <b>update</b> commands.

       <b>-W</b>

         Specify file names that should be filtered.  You can use this option repeatedly.  The  spec  can  be  a
         file  name  pattern of the same type that you can specify in the <b>.cvswrappers</b> file.  Available with the
         following commands: <b>import</b>, and <b>update</b>.

   <b>admin—Administration</b> <b>front-end</b> <b>for</b> <b>RCS</b>
       • Requires: repository, working directory.

       • Changes: repository.

       • Synonym: rcs

         This is the <b>cvs</b> interface to assorted  administrative  facilities.   Some  of  them  have  questionable
         usefulness  for  <b>cvs</b> but exist for historical purposes.  Some of the questionable options are likely to
         disappear in the future.  This command <u>does</u> work recursively, so extreme care should be used.

         On unix, if there is a group named <b>cvsadmin</b>, only members of that group can  run  <b>cvs</b>  <b>admin</b>  commands,
         except  for those specified using the <b>UserAdminOptions</b> configuration option in the <b>CVSROOT/config</b> file.
         Options specified using <b>UserAdminOptions</b> can be run by any user.  See node 'config' in the  CVS  manual
         for more on <b>UserAdminOptions</b>.

         The  <b>cvsadmin</b>  group  should  exist on the server, or any system running the non-client/server <b>cvs</b>.  To
         disallow <b>cvs</b> <b>admin</b> for all users, create a group with no users in it.  On NT, the <b>cvsadmin</b> feature does
         not exist and all users can run <b>cvs</b> <b>admin</b>.

</pre><h4><b>admin</b> <b>options</b></h4><pre>
       Some of these options have questionable usefulness for <b>cvs</b> but exist for historical purposes.  Some  even
       make it impossible to use <b>cvs</b> until you undo the effect!

       <b>-A</b><u>oldfile</u>

         Might  not  work  together  with  <b>cvs</b>.  Append the access list of <u>oldfile</u> to the access list of the <b>rcs</b>
         file.

       <b>-a</b><u>logins</u>

         Might not work together with <b>cvs</b>.  Append the login names appearing in the comma-separated list  <u>logins</u>
         to the access list of the <b>rcs</b> file.

       <b>-b[</b><u>rev</u><b>]</b>

         Set  the  default  branch to <u>rev</u>.  In <b>cvs</b>, you normally do not manipulate default branches; sticky tags
         (see node 'Sticky tags' in the CVS manual) are a better way to decide which branch you want to work on.
         There is one reason to run <b>cvs</b> <b>admin</b> <b>-b</b>: to revert to the vendor's version when using  vendor  branches
         (see  node  'Reverting  local  changes'  in  the CVS manual).  There can be no space between <b>-b</b> and its
         argument.

       <b>-c</b><u>string</u>

         Sets the comment leader to <u>string</u>.  The comment leader is not used by current versions of  <b>cvs</b>  or  <b>rcs</b>
         5.7.   Therefore, you can almost surely not worry about it.  See node 'Keyword substitution' in the CVS
         manual.

       <b>-e[</b><u>logins</u><b>]</b>

         Might not work together with <b>cvs</b>.  Erase the login names appearing in the comma-separated  list  <u>logins</u>
         from  the  access list of the RCS file.  If <u>logins</u> is omitted, erase the entire access list.  There can
         be no space between <b>-e</b> and its argument.

       <b>-I</b>

         Run interactively, even if the standard input is not a terminal.  This option does not  work  with  the
         client/server <b>cvs</b> and is likely to disappear in a future release of <b>cvs</b>.

       <b>-i</b>

         Useless  with  <b>cvs</b>.   This creates and initialises a new <b>rcs</b> file, without depositing a revision.  With
         <b>cvs</b>, add files with the <b>cvs</b> <b>add</b> command (see node 'Adding files' in the CVS manual).

       <b>-k</b><u>subst</u>

         Set the default keyword substitution to <u>subst</u>.  See node 'Keyword  substitution'  in  the  CVS  manual.
         Giving an explicit <b>-k</b> option to <b>cvs</b> <b>update</b>, <b>cvs</b> <b>export</b>, or <b>cvs</b> <b>checkout</b> overrides this default.

       <b>-l[</b><u>rev</u><b>]</b>

         Lock  the revision with number <u>rev</u>.  If a branch is given, lock the latest revision on that branch.  If
         <u>rev</u> is omitted, lock the latest revision on the default branch.  There can be no space between  <b>-l</b>  and
         its argument.

         This  can  be used in conjunction with the <b>rcslock.pl</b> script in the <b>contrib</b> directory of the <b>cvs</b> source
         distribution to provide reserved checkouts (where only one user can be editing a given file at a time).
         See the comments in that file for details (and see the <b>README</b> file in that  directory  for  disclaimers
         about  the  unsupported  nature  of  contrib).  According to comments in that file, locking must set to
         strict (which is the default).

       <b>-L</b>

         Set locking to strict.  Strict locking means that the owner of an RCS file is not exempt  from  locking
         for  checkin.   For  use  with  <b>cvs</b>, strict locking must be set; see the discussion under the <b>-l</b> option
         above.

       <b>-m</b><u>rev</u><b>:</b><u>msg</u>

         Replace the log message of revision <u>rev</u> with <u>msg</u>.

       <b>-N</b><u>name</u><b>[:[</b><u>rev</u><b>]]</b>

         Act like <b>-n</b>, except override any previous assignment of <u>name</u>.  For use with magic  branches,  see  node
         'Magic branch numbers' in the CVS manual.

       <b>-n</b><u>name</u><b>[:[</b><u>rev</u><b>]]</b>

         Associate the symbolic name <u>name</u> with the branch or revision <u>rev</u>.  It is normally better to use <b>cvs</b> <b>tag</b>
         or <b>cvs</b> <b>rtag</b> instead.  Delete the symbolic name if both <b>:</b> and <u>rev</u> are omitted; otherwise, print an error
         message  if  <u>name</u> is already associated with another number.  If <u>rev</u> is symbolic, it is expanded before
         association.  A <u>rev</u> consisting of a branch number followed  by  a  <b>.</b>  stands  for  the  current  latest
         revision  in  the  branch.  A <b>:</b> with an empty <u>rev</u> stands for the current latest revision on the default
         branch, normally the trunk.  For example, <b>cvs</b> <b>admin</b> <b>-n</b><u>name</u><b>:</b> associates <u>name</u>  with  the  current  latest
         revision  of  all  the RCS files; this contrasts with <b>cvs</b> <b>admin</b> <b>-n</b><u>name</u><b>:$</b> which associates <u>name</u> with the
         revision numbers extracted from keyword strings in the corresponding working files.

       <b>-o</b><u>range</u>

         Deletes (<u>outdates</u>) the revisions given by <u>range</u>.

         Note that this command can be quite dangerous unless you know <u>exactly</u> what you are doing  (for  example
         see the warnings below about how the <u>rev1</u>:<u>rev2</u> syntax is confusing).

         If  you  are short on disc this option might help you.  But think twice before using it—there is no way
         short of restoring the latest backup to undo this command!  If you delete different revisions than  you
         planned,  either  due  to carelessness or (heaven forbid) a <b>cvs</b> bug, there is no opportunity to correct
         the error before the revisions are deleted.  It probably would be a good idea to experiment on  a  copy
         of the repository first.

         Specify <u>range</u> in one of the following ways:

         <u>rev1</u><b>::</b><u>rev2</u>

           Collapse all revisions between rev1 and rev2, so that <b>cvs</b> only stores the differences associated with
           going  from  rev1  to  rev2, not intermediate steps.  For example, after <b>-o</b> <b>1.3::1.5</b> one can retrieve
           revision 1.3, revision 1.5, or the differences to get from 1.3 to 1.5, but not the revision  1.4,  or
           the  differences  between  1.3  and 1.4.  Other examples: <b>-o</b> <b>1.3::1.4</b> and <b>-o</b> <b>1.3::1.3</b> have no effect,
           because there are no intermediate revisions to remove.

         <b>::</b><u>rev</u>

           Collapse revisions between  the  beginning  of  the  branch  containing  <u>rev</u>  and  <u>rev</u>  itself.   The
           branchpoint  and  <u>rev</u>  are left intact.  For example, <b>-o</b> <b>::1.3.2.6</b> deletes revision 1.3.2.1, revision
           1.3.2.5, and everything in between, but leaves 1.3 and 1.3.2.6 intact.

         <u>rev</u><b>::</b>

           Collapse revisions between <u>rev</u> and the end of the branch containing <u>rev</u>.  Revision <u>rev</u> is left intact
           but the head revision is deleted.

         <u>rev</u>

           Delete the revision <u>rev</u>.  For example, <b>-o</b> <b>1.3</b> is equivalent to <b>-o</b> <b>1.2::1.4</b>.

         <u>rev1</u><b>:</b><u>rev2</u>

           Delete the revisions from <u>rev1</u> to <u>rev2</u>, inclusive, on the same branch.   One  will  not  be  able  to
           retrieve  <u>rev1</u>  or  <u>rev2</u>  or  any  of  the  revisions in between.  For example, the command <b>cvs</b> <b>admin</b>
           <b>-oR_1_01:R_1_02</b> <b>.</b> is rarely useful.  It means to delete revisions  up  to,  and  including,  the  tag
           R_1_02.   But  beware!   If  there are files that have not changed between R_1_02 and R_1_03 the file
           will have <u>the</u> <u>same</u> numerical revision number assigned to the tags R_1_02 and  R_1_03.   So  not  only
           will  it  be  impossible to retrieve R_1_02; R_1_03 will also have to be restored from the tapes!  In
           most cases you want to specify <u>rev1</u>::<u>rev2</u> instead.

         <b>:</b><u>rev</u>

           Delete revisions from the beginning of the branch containing <u>rev</u> up to and including <u>rev</u>.

         <u>rev</u><b>:</b>

           Delete revisions from revision <u>rev</u>, including <u>rev</u> itself, to the end of the branch containing <u>rev</u>.

           None of the revisions to be deleted may have branches or locks.

           If any of the revisions to be deleted have symbolic names, and one specifies one of the <b>::</b>  syntaxes,
           then  <b>cvs</b>  will  give  an  error and not delete any revisions.  If you really want to delete both the
           symbolic names and the revisions, first delete the symbolic names with <b>cvs</b> <b>tag</b> <b>-d</b>, then run <b>cvs</b> <b>admin</b>
           <b>-o</b>.  If one specifies the non-<b>::</b> syntaxes, then <b>cvs</b> will delete the revisions but leave the  symbolic
           names  pointing to nonexistent revisions.  This behavior is preserved for compatibility with previous
           versions of <b>cvs</b>, but because it isn't very useful, in the future it may change  to  be  like  the  <b>::</b>
           case.

           Due to the way <b>cvs</b> handles branches <u>rev</u> cannot be specified symbolically if it is a branch.  See node
           'Magic branch numbers' in the CVS manual, for an explanation.

           Make sure that no-one has checked out a copy of the revision you outdate.  Strange things will happen
           if  he  starts  to edit it and tries to check it back in.  For this reason, this option is not a good
           way to take back a bogus commit; commit a new revision undoing the bogus  change  instead  (see  node
           'Merging two revisions' in the CVS manual).

       <b>-q</b>

         Run quietly; do not print diagnostics.

       <b>-s</b><u>state</u><b>[:</b><u>rev</u><b>]</b>

         Useful  with  <b>cvs</b>.   Set  the state attribute of the revision <u>rev</u> to <u>state</u>.  If <u>rev</u> is a branch number,
         assume the latest revision on that branch.  If <u>rev</u> is  omitted,  assume  the  latest  revision  on  the
         default  branch.   Any  identifier  is  acceptable  for  <u>state</u>.   A  useful  set  of states is <b>Exp</b> (for
         experimental), <b>Stab</b> (for stable), and <b>Rel</b> (for released).  By default, the state of a new  revision  is
         set  to <b>Exp</b> when it is created.  The state is visible in the output from <u>cvs</u> <u>log</u> (see node 'log' in the
         CVS manual), and in the <b>$Log$</b> and <b>$State$</b> keywords (see node 'Keyword substitution' in the CVS manual).
         Note that <b>cvs</b> uses the <b>dead</b> state for its own purposes (see node 'Attic' in the CVS manual); to take  a
         file to or from the <b>dead</b> state use commands like <b>cvs</b> <b>remove</b> and <b>cvs</b> <b>add</b> (see node 'Adding and removing'
         in the CVS manual), not <b>cvs</b> <b>admin</b> <b>-s</b>.

       <b>-t[</b><u>file</u><b>]</b>

         Useful  with  <b>cvs</b>.   Write  descriptive  text  from  the  contents of the named <u>file</u> into the RCS file,
         deleting the existing text.  The <u>file</u> pathname may not begin with <b>-</b>.  The descriptive text can be  seen
         in  the  output  from <b>cvs</b> <b>log</b> (see node 'log' in the CVS manual).  There can be no space between <b>-t</b> and
         its argument.

         If <u>file</u> is omitted, obtain the text from standard  input,  terminated  by  end-of-file  or  by  a  line
         containing <b>.</b> by itself.  Prompt for the text if interaction is possible; see <b>-I</b>.

       <b>-t-</b><u>string</u>

         Similar  to  <b>-t</b><u>file</u>.  Write  descriptive  text from the <u>string</u> into the <b>rcs</b> file, deleting the existing
         text.  There can be no space between <b>-t</b> and its argument.

       <b>-U</b>

         Set locking to non-strict.  Non-strict locking means that the owner of a file need not lock a  revision
         for  checkin.   For  use  with  <b>cvs</b>, strict locking must be set; see the discussion under the <b>-l</b> option
         above.

       <b>-u[</b><u>rev</u><b>]</b>

         See the option <b>-l</b> above, for a discussion of using this option with  <b>cvs</b>.   Unlock  the  revision  with
         number  <u>rev</u>.   If  a  branch  is  given, unlock the latest revision on that branch.  If <u>rev</u> is omitted,
         remove the latest lock held by the caller.  Normally, only the locker of  a  revision  may  unlock  it;
         somebody  else  unlocking  a  revision  breaks  the lock.  This causes the original locker to be sent a
         <b>commit</b> notification (see node 'Getting Notified' in the CVS manual).  There can be no space between  <b>-u</b>
         and its argument.

       <b>-V</b><u>n</u>

         In  previous  versions  of <b>cvs</b>, this option meant to write an <b>rcs</b> file which would be acceptable to <b>rcs</b>
         version <u>n</u>, but it is now obsolete and specifying it will produce an error.

       <b>-x</b><u>suffixes</u>

         In previous versions of <b>cvs</b>, this was documented as a way of specifying the names  of  the  <b>rcs</b>  files.
         However,  <b>cvs</b>  has  always  required that the <b>rcs</b> files used by <b>cvs</b> end in <b>,v</b>, so this option has never
         done anything useful.

       that (see node 'diff' in the CVS manual).

       The  options  to  <b>cvs</b>  <b>annotate</b>  are  listed in node 'Invoking CVS' in the CVS manual, and can be used to
       select the files and revisions to annotate.  The options are described in more detail there and  in  node
       'Common options' in the CVS manual.

   <b>checkout—Check</b> <b>out</b> <b>sources</b> <b>for</b> <b>editing</b>
       • Synopsis: checkout [options] modules...

       • Requires: repository.

       • Changes: working directory.

       • Synonyms: co, get

         Create  or  update a working directory containing copies of the source files specified by <u>modules</u>.  You
         must execute <b>checkout</b> before using most of the other <b>cvs</b> commands, since most of them operate  on  your
         working directory.

         The  <u>modules</u> are either symbolic names for some collection of source directories and files, or paths to
         directories or files in the repository.  The symbolic names are defined in the <b>modules</b> file.  See  node
         'modules' in the CVS manual.

         Depending  on  the  modules  you specify, <b>checkout</b> may recursively create directories and populate them
         with the appropriate source files.  You can then edit these source files at  any  time  (regardless  of
         whether  other software developers are editing their own copies of the sources); update them to include
         new changes applied by others to the source repository; or commit your work as a  permanent  change  to
         the source repository.

         Note  that  <b>checkout</b> is used to create directories.  The top-level directory created is always added to
         the directory where <b>checkout</b> is invoked, and usually has the same name as the specified module.  In the
         case of a module alias, the created sub-directory may have a different name, but you can be  sure  that
         it will be a sub-directory, and that <b>checkout</b> will show the relative path leading to each file as it is
         extracted into your private work area (unless you specify the <b>-Q</b> global option).

         The  files  created  by  <b>checkout</b> are created read-write, unless the <b>-r</b> option to <b>cvs</b> (see node 'Global
         options' in the CVS manual) is specified, the <b>CVSREAD</b>  environment  variable  is  specified  (see  node
         'Environment  variables'  in the CVS manual), or a watch is in effect for that file (see node 'Watches'
         in the CVS manual).

         Note that running <b>checkout</b> on a directory that was already built by a prior <b>checkout</b> is also permitted.
         This is similar to specifying the <b>-d</b> option to the <b>update</b> command in the  sense  that  new  directories
         that  have  been  created  in  the repository will appear in your work area.  However, <b>checkout</b> takes a
         module name whereas <b>update</b> takes a directory name.  Also to use <b>checkout</b> this way it must be  run  from
         the  top level directory (where you originally ran <b>checkout</b> from), so before you run <b>checkout</b> to update
         an existing directory, don't forget to change your directory to the top level directory.

         For the output produced by the <b>checkout</b> command see node 'update output' in the CVS manual.

</pre><h4><b>checkout</b> <b>options</b></h4><pre>
       These standard options are supported by <b>checkout</b> (see node 'Common options' in  the  CVS  manual,  for  a
       complete description of them):

       <b>-D</b> <u>date</u>

         Use  the  most  recent  revision  no later than <u>date</u>.  This option is sticky, and implies <b>-P</b>.  See node
         'Sticky tags' in the CVS manual, for more information on sticky tags/dates.

       <b>-f</b>

         Only useful with the <b>-D</b> or <b>-r</b> flags.  If no matching  revision  is  found,  retrieve  the  most  recent
         revision (instead of ignoring the file).

       <b>-k</b> <u>kflag</u>

         Process  keywords  according to <u>kflag</u>.  See node 'Keyword substitution' in the CVS manual.  This option
         is sticky; future updates of this file in this working directory will use the same <u>kflag</u>.   The  <b>status</b>
         command  can  be viewed to see the sticky options.  See node 'Invoking CVS' in the CVS manual, for more
         information on the <b>status</b> command.

       <b>-l</b>

         Local; run only in current working directory.

       <b>-n</b>

         Do not run any checkout program (as specified with  the  <b>-o</b>  option  in  the  modules  file;  see  node
         'modules' in the CVS manual).

       <b>-P</b>

         Prune empty directories.  See node 'Moving directories' in the CVS manual.

       <b>-p</b>

         Pipe files to the standard output.

       <b>-R</b>

         Checkout directories recursively.  This option is on by default.

       <b>-r</b> <u>tag</u><b>[:</b><u>date</u><b>]</b>

         Checkout  the revision specified by <u>tag</u> or, when <u>date</u> is specified and <u>tag</u> is a branch tag, the version
         from the branch <u>tag</u> as it existed on <u>date</u>.  This option is sticky, and implies <b>-P</b>.   See  node  'Sticky
         tags' in the CVS manual, for more information on sticky tags/dates.  Also, see node 'Common options' in
         the CVS manual.

         In addition to those, you can use these special command options with <b>checkout</b>:

       <b>-A</b>

         Reset  any  sticky  tags,  dates,  or  <b>-k</b>  options.  See node 'Sticky tags' in the CVS manual, for more
         information on sticky tags/dates.

       <b>-c</b>

         Copy the module file, sorted, to the standard output, instead of creating or  modifying  any  files  or
         directories in your working directory.

       <b>-d</b> <u>dir</u>

         Create  a  directory  called  <u>dir</u> for the working files, instead of using the module name.  In general,
         using this flag is equivalent to using <b>mkdir</b> <u>dir</u><b>;</b> <b>cd</b> <u>dir</u> followed by the checkout command  without  the
         <b>-d</b> flag.

         There  is  an  important  exception, however.  It is very convenient when checking out a single item to
         have the output appear in a directory that doesn't contain empty  intermediate  directories.   In  this
         case <u>only</u>, <b>cvs</b> tries to ``shorten'' pathnames to avoid those empty directories.

         For example, given a module <b>foo</b> that contains the file <b>bar.c</b>, the command <b>cvs</b> <b>co</b> <b>-d</b> <b>dir</b> <b>foo</b> will create
         directory <b>dir</b> and place <b>bar.c</b> inside.  Similarly, given a module <b>bar</b> which has subdirectory <b>baz</b> wherein
         there  is  a  file <b>quux.c</b>, the command <b>cvs</b> <b>co</b> <b>-d</b> <b>dir</b> <b>bar/baz</b> will create directory <b>dir</b> and place <b>quux.c</b>
         inside.

         Using the <b>-N</b> flag will defeat this behavior.  Given the same module definitions above, <b>cvs</b> <b>co</b> <b>-N</b> <b>-d</b> <b>dir</b>
         <b>foo</b> will create directories <b>dir/foo</b> and place <b>bar.c</b> inside, while <b>cvs</b> <b>co</b> <b>-N</b> <b>-d</b> <b>dir</b> <b>bar/baz</b> will  create
         directories <b>dir/bar/baz</b> and place <b>quux.c</b> inside.

       <b>-j</b> <u>tag</u>

         With two <b>-j</b> options, merge changes from the revision specified with the first <b>-j</b> option to the revision
         specified with the second <b>j</b> option, into the working directory.

         With  one  <b>-j</b>  option,  merge  changes from the ancestor revision to the revision specified with the <b>-j</b>
         option, into the working directory.  The ancestor revision is the common ancestor of the revision which
         the working directory is based on, and the revision specified in the <b>-j</b> option.

         In addition, each -j option can contain an optional date specification which, when used with  branches,
         can limit the chosen revision to one within a specific date.  An optional date is specified by adding a
         colon (:) to the tag: <b>-j</b><u>Symbolic_Tag</u><b>:</b><u>Date_Specifier</u>.

         See node 'Branching and merging' in the CVS manual.

       <b>-N</b>

         Only  useful  together  with  <b>-d</b>  <u>dir</u>.  With this option, <b>cvs</b> will not ``shorten'' module paths in your
         working directory when you check out a single module.  See the <b>-d</b> flag for examples and a discussion.

       <b>-s</b>

         Like <b>-c</b>, but include the status of all modules, and sort it by the status string.  See  node  'modules'
         in  the CVS manual, for info about the <b>-s</b> option that is used inside the modules file to set the module
         status.

   <b>commit—Check</b> <b>files</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>repository</b>
       • Synopsis: commit [-lnRf] [-m 'log_message' | -F file] [-r revision] [files...]

       • Requires: working directory, repository.

       • Changes: repository.

       • Synonym: ci

         Use <b>commit</b> when you want to incorporate  changes  from  your  working  source  files  into  the  source
         repository.

         If you don't specify particular files to commit, all of the files in your working current directory are
         examined.  <b>commit</b> is careful to change in the repository only those files that you have really changed.
         By  default (or if you explicitly specify the <b>-R</b> option), files in subdirectories are also examined and
         committed if they have changed; you can use the <b>-l</b> option to limit  <b>commit</b>  to  the  current  directory
         only.

         <b>commit</b>  verifies  that  the  selected  files  are  up  to date with the current revisions in the source
         repository; it will notify you, and exit without committing, if any of the specified files must be made
         current first with <b>update</b> (see node 'update' in the CVS manual).   <b>commit</b>  does  not  call  the  <b>update</b>
         command for you, but rather leaves that for you to do when the time is right.

         When  all is well, an editor is invoked to allow you to enter a log message that will be written to one
         or more logging programs (see node 'modules' in the CVS manual, and  see  node  'loginfo'  in  the  CVS
         manual)  and  placed in the <b>rcs</b> file inside the repository.  This log message can be retrieved with the
         <b>log</b> command; see node 'log' in the CVS manual.  You can specify the log message  on  the  command  line
         with  the <b>-m</b> <u>message</u> option, and thus avoid the editor invocation, or use the <b>-F</b> <u>file</u> option to specify
         that the argument file contains the log message.

         At <b>commit</b>, a unique commitid is placed in the <b>rcs</b> file inside the repository. All  files  committed  at
         once  get  the same commitid, a string consisting only of hexadecimal digits (usually 16 in GNU <b>cvs</b>, 19
         in Debian and MirBSD <b>cvs</b>).  FSF GNU <b>cvs</b> 1.11 and OpenBSD OpenCVS do not  support  commitids  yet.   The
         commitid  can  be  retrieved with the <b>log</b> and <b>status</b> command; see node 'log' in the CVS manual and node
         'File status' in the CVS manual.

</pre><h4><b>commit</b> <b>options</b></h4><pre>
       These standard options are supported by <b>commit</b> (see node 'Common  options'  in  the  CVS  manual,  for  a
       complete description of them):

       <b>-l</b>

         Local; run only in current working directory.

       <b>-R</b>

         Commit directories recursively.  This is on by default.

       <b>-r</b> <u>revision</u>

         Commit  to  <u>revision</u>.  <u>revision</u> must be either a branch, or a revision on the main trunk that is higher
         than any existing revision number (see node 'Assigning revisions'  in  the  CVS  manual).   You  cannot
         commit to a specific revision on a branch.

         <b>commit</b> also supports these options:

       <b>-c</b>

         Refuse  to  commit files unless the user has registered a valid edit on the file via <b>cvs</b> <b>edit</b>.  This is
         most useful when <b>commit</b> <b>-c</b> and <b>edit</b> <b>-c</b> have been placed in all <b>.cvsrc</b> files.  A commit  can  be  forced
         anyways  by either regestering an edit retroactively via <b>cvs</b> <b>edit</b> (no changes to the file will be lost)
         or using the <b>-f</b> option to commit.  Support for <b>commit</b> <b>-c</b> requires both client  and  a  server  versions
         1.12.10 or greater.

       <b>-F</b> <u>file</u>

         Read the log message from <u>file</u>, instead of invoking an editor.

       <b>-f</b>

         Note that this is not the standard behavior of the <b>-f</b> option as defined in node 'Common options' in the
         CVS manual.

         Force <b>cvs</b> to commit a new revision even if you haven't made any changes to the file.  As of <b>cvs</b> version
         1.12.10,  it also causes the <b>-c</b> option to be ignored.  If the current revision of <u>file</u> is 1.7, then the
         following two commands are equivalent:

           $ cvs commit -f <u>file</u>
           $ cvs commit -r 1.8 <u>file</u>

         The <b>-f</b> option disables recursion (i.e., it implies <b>-l</b>).  To force <b>cvs</b> to commit a new revision for  all
         files in all subdirectories, you must use <b>-f</b> <b>-R</b>.

       <b>-m</b> <u>message</u>

         Use <u>message</u> as the log message, instead of invoking an editor.

</pre><h4><b>commit</b> <b>examples</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Committing</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>branch</b>
       You  can commit to a branch revision (one that has an even number of dots) with the <b>-r</b> option.  To create
       a branch revision, use the <b>-b</b> option of the <b>rtag</b> or <b>tag</b> commands (see node 'Branching and merging' in the
       CVS manual).  Then, either <b>checkout</b> or <b>update</b> can be used to base  your  sources  on  the  newly  created
       branch.   From  that point on, all <b>commit</b> changes made within these working sources will be automatically
       added to a branch revision, thereby not disturbing main-line development in any way.  For example, if you
       had to create a patch to the 1.2 version of the product, even though the 2.0  version  is  already  under
       development, you might do:

         $ cvs rtag -b -r FCS1_2 FCS1_2_Patch product_module
         $ cvs checkout -r FCS1_2_Patch product_module
         $ cd product_module
         [[ hack away ]]
         $ cvs commit

       This works automatically since the <b>-r</b> option is sticky.

   <b>Creating</b> <b>the</b> <b>branch</b> <b>after</b> <b>editing</b>
       Say  you  have  been  working  on  some  extremely  experimental software, based on whatever revision you
       happened to checkout last week.  If others in your group would like to work on this  software  with  you,
       but  without  disturbing main-line development, you could commit your change to a new branch.  Others can
       then checkout your experimental stuff and utilise the full  benefit  of  <b>cvs</b>  conflict  resolution.   The
       scenario might look like:

         [[ hacked sources are present ]]
         $ cvs tag -b EXPR1
         $ cvs update -r EXPR1
         $ cvs commit

       The  <b>update</b>  command  will  make  the <b>-r</b> <b>EXPR1</b> option sticky on all files.  Note that your changes to the
       files will never be removed by the <b>update</b> command.  The <b>commit</b> will automatically commit to  the  correct
       branch, because the <b>-r</b> is sticky.  You could also do like this:

         [[ hacked sources are present ]]
         $ cvs tag -b EXPR1
         $ cvs commit -r EXPR1

       but  then,  only  those  files  that were changed by you will have the <b>-r</b> <b>EXPR1</b> sticky flag.  If you hack
       away, and commit without specifying the <b>-r</b> <b>EXPR1</b> flag, some files may accidentally end  up  on  the  main
       trunk.

       To work with you on the experimental change, others would simply do

         $ cvs checkout -r EXPR1 whatever_module

</pre><h4><b>diff,</b> <b>export,</b> <b>commit,</b> <b>CVS</b> <b>commands</b></h4><pre>
   <b>diff—Show</b> <b>differences</b> <b>between</b> <b>revisions</b>
       • Synopsis:  diff  [-lR]  [-k kflag] [format_options] [(-r rev1[:date1] | -D date1) [-r rev2[:date2] | -D
         date2]] [files...]

       • Requires: working directory, repository.

       • Changes: nothing.

         The <b>diff</b> command is used to compare different revisions of files.  The default  action  is  to  compare
         your working files with the revisions they were based on, and report any differences that are found.

         If  any  file  names are given, only those files are compared.  If any directories are given, all files
         under them will be compared.

         The exit status for diff is different than for other <b>cvs</b> commands; for details see node  'Exit  status'
         in the CVS manual.

</pre><h4><b>diff</b> <b>options</b></h4><pre>
       These standard options are supported by <b>diff</b> (see node 'Common options' in the CVS manual, for a complete
       description of them):

       <b>-D</b> <u>date</u>

         Use the most recent revision no later than <u>date</u>.  See <b>-r</b> for how this affects the comparison.

       <b>-k</b> <u>kflag</u>

         Process keywords according to <u>kflag</u>.  See node 'Keyword substitution' in the CVS manual.

       <b>-l</b>

         Local; run only in current working directory.

       <b>-R</b>

         Examine directories recursively.  This option is on by default.

       <b>-r</b> <u>tag</u><b>[:</b><u>date</u><b>]</b>

         Compare  with revision specified by <u>tag</u> or, when <u>date</u> is specified and <u>tag</u> is a branch tag, the version
         from the branch <u>tag</u> as it existed on <u>date</u>.  Zero, one or two <b>-r</b> options can be  present.   With  no  <b>-r</b>
         option,  the  working  file  will  be  compared  with  the revision it was based on.  With one <b>-r</b>, that
         revision will be compared to your current working file.  With two <b>-r</b> options those two  revisions  will
         be compared (and your working file will not affect the outcome in any way).

         One or both <b>-r</b> options can be replaced by a <b>-D</b> <u>date</u> option, described above.

         The  following  options  specify  the format of the output.  They have the same meaning as in GNU diff.
         Most options have two equivalent names, one of which is a single letter preceded by <b>-</b>, and the other of
         which is a long name preceded by <b>--</b>.

       <b>-</b><u>lines</u>

         Show <u>lines</u> (an integer) lines of context.  This option does not specify an output format by itself;  it
         has  no  effect  unless  it is combined with <b>-c</b> or <b>-u</b>.  This option is obsolete.  For proper operation,
         <b>patch</b> typically needs at least two lines of context.

       <b>-a</b>

         Treat all files as text and compare them line-by-line, even if they do not seem to be text.

       <b>-b</b>

         Ignore trailing white space and consider all other sequences of one or more white space  characters  to
         be equivalent.

       <b>-B</b>

         Ignore changes that just insert or delete blank lines.

       <b>--binary</b>

         Read and write data in binary mode.

       <b>--brief</b>

         Report only whether the files differ, not the details of the differences.

       <b>-c</b>

         Use the context output format.

       <b>-C</b> <u>lines</u>

       <b>--context</b>[<b>=</b><u>lines</u>]

         Use  the  context  output format, showing <u>lines</u> (an integer) lines of context, or three if <u>lines</u> is not
         given.  For proper operation, <b>patch</b> typically needs at least two lines of context.

       <b>--changed-group-format=</b><u>format</u>

         Use <u>format</u> to output a line group containing differing lines from both files  in  if-then-else  format.
         See node 'Line group formats' in the CVS manual.

       <b>-d</b>

         Change  the algorithm to perhaps find a smaller set of changes.  This makes <b>diff</b> slower (sometimes much
         slower).

       <b>-e</b>

       <b>--ed</b>

         Make output that is a valid <b>ed</b> script.

       <b>--expand-tabs</b>

         Expand tabs to spaces in the output, to preserve the alignment of tabs in the input files.

       <b>-f</b>

         Make output that looks vaguely like an <b>ed</b> script but has changes in the order they appear in the file.

       <b>-F</b> <u>regexp</u>

         In context and unified format, for each hunk of differences, show some of the last preceding line  that
         matches <u>regexp</u>.

       <b>--forward-ed</b>

         Make output that looks vaguely like an <b>ed</b> script but has changes in the order they appear in the file.

       <b>-H</b>

         Use heuristics to speed handling of large files that have numerous scattered small changes.

       <b>--horizon-lines=</b><u>lines</u>

         Do  not  discard  the  last  <u>lines</u>  lines  of the common prefix and the first <u>lines</u> lines of the common
         suffix.

       <b>-i</b>

         Ignore changes in case; consider upper- and lower-case letters equivalent.

       <b>-I</b> <u>regexp</u>

         Ignore changes that just insert or delete lines that match <u>regexp</u>.

       <b>--ifdef=</b><u>name</u>

         Make merged if-then-else output using <u>name</u>.

       <b>--ignore-all-space</b>

         Ignore white space when comparing lines.

       <b>--ignore-blank-lines</b>

         Ignore changes that just insert or delete blank lines.

       <b>--ignore-case</b>

         Ignore changes in case; consider upper- and lower-case to be the same.

       <b>--ignore-matching-lines=</b><u>regexp</u>

         Ignore changes that just insert or delete lines that match <u>regexp</u>.

       <b>--ignore-space-change</b>

         Ignore trailing white space and consider all other sequences of one or more white space  characters  to
         be equivalent.

       <b>--initial-tab</b>

         Output  a  tab  rather than a space before the text of a line in normal or context format.  This causes
         the alignment of tabs in the line to look normal.

       <b>-L</b> <u>label</u>

         Use <u>label</u> instead of the file name in the context format and unified format headers.

       <b>--label=</b><u>label</u>

         Use <u>label</u> instead of the file name in the context format and unified format headers.

       <b>--left-column</b>

         Print only the left column of two common lines in side by side format.

       <b>--line-format=</b><u>format</u>

         Use <u>format</u> to output all input lines in if-then-else format.   See  node  'Line  formats'  in  the  CVS
         manual.

       <b>--minimal</b>

         Change  the algorithm to perhaps find a smaller set of changes.  This makes <b>diff</b> slower (sometimes much
         slower).

       <b>-n</b>

         Output RCS-format diffs; like <b>-f</b> except that each command specifies the number of lines affected.

       <b>-N</b>

       <b>--new-file</b>

         In directory comparison, if a file is found in only one directory, treat it as present but empty in the
         other directory.

       <b>--new-group-format=</b><u>format</u>

         Use <u>format</u> to output a group of lines taken from just the second file in if-then-else format.  See node
         'Line group formats' in the CVS manual.

       <b>--new-line-format=</b><u>format</u>

         Use <u>format</u> to output a line taken from just the second file in if-then-else  format.   See  node  'Line
         formats' in the CVS manual.

       <b>--old-group-format=</b><u>format</u>

         Use  <u>format</u> to output a group of lines taken from just the first file in if-then-else format.  See node
         'Line group formats' in the CVS manual.

       <b>--old-line-format=</b><u>format</u>

         Use <u>format</u> to output a line taken from just the first file in  if-then-else  format.   See  node  'Line
         formats' in the CVS manual.

       <b>-p</b>

         Show which C function each change is in.

       <b>--rcs</b>

         Output RCS-format diffs; like <b>-f</b> except that each command specifies the number of lines affected.

       <b>--report-identical-files</b>

       <b>-s</b>

         Report when two files are the same.

       <b>--show-c-function</b>

         Show which C function each change is in.

       <b>--show-function-line=</b><u>regexp</u>

         In  context and unified format, for each hunk of differences, show some of the last preceding line that
         matches <u>regexp</u>.

       <b>--side-by-side</b>

         Use the side by side output format.

       <b>--speed-large-files</b>

         Use heuristics to speed handling of large files that have numerous scattered small changes.

       <b>--suppress-common-lines</b>

         Do not print common lines in side by side format.

       <b>-t</b>

         Expand tabs to spaces in the output, to preserve the alignment of tabs in the input files.

       <b>-T</b>

         Output a tab rather than a space before the text of a line in normal or context  format.   This  causes
         the alignment of tabs in the line to look normal.

       <b>--text</b>

         Treat all files as text and compare them line-by-line, even if they do not appear to be text.

       <b>-u</b>

         Use the unified output format.

       <b>--unchanged-group-format=</b><u>format</u>

         'Line group formats' in the CVS manual.

       <b>--unchanged-line-format=</b><u>format</u>

         Use <u>format</u> to output a line common to both files in if-then-else format.  See node  'Line  formats'  in
         the CVS manual.

       <b>-U</b> <u>lines</u>

       <b>--unified</b>[<b>=</b><u>lines</u>]

         Use  the  unified  output format, showing <u>lines</u> (an integer) lines of context, or three if <u>lines</u> is not
         given.  For proper operation, <b>patch</b> typically needs at least two lines of context.

       <b>-w</b>

         Ignore white space when comparing lines.

       <b>-W</b> <u>columns</u>

       <b>--width=</b><u>columns</u>

       <b>-y</b>

         Use the side by side output format.

</pre><h4><b>Line</b> <b>group</b> <b>formats</b></h4><pre>
       Line group formats let you specify formats suitable for many applications that allow if-then-else  input,
       including  programming languages and text formatting languages.  A line group format specifies the output
       format for a contiguous group of similar lines.

       For example, the following command compares the TeX file  <b>myfile</b>  with  the  original  version  from  the
       repository,  and  outputs a merged file in which old regions are surrounded by <b>\begin{em}</b>-<b>\end{em}</b> lines,
       and new regions are surrounded by <b>\begin{bf}</b>-<b>\end{bf}</b> lines.

         cvs diff \

            --old-group-format='\begin{em}
         %&lt;\end{em}
         ' \

            --new-group-format='\begin{bf}
         %&gt;\end{bf}
         ' \

            myfile

       The following command is equivalent to the above example, but it is a little  more  verbose,  because  it
       spells out the default line group formats.

         cvs diff \

            --old-group-format='\begin{em}
         %&lt;\end{em}
         ' \

            --new-group-format='\begin{bf}
         %&gt;\end{bf}
         ' \

            --unchanged-group-format='%=' \

            --changed-group-format='\begin{em}
         %&lt;\end{em}
         \begin{bf}
         %&gt;\end{bf}
         ' \

            myfile

       Here  is  a more advanced example, which outputs a diff listing with headers containing line numbers in a
       ``plain English'' style.

         cvs diff \

            --unchanged-group-format='' \

            --old-group-format='-------- %dn line%(n=1?:s) deleted at %df:
         %&lt;' \

            --new-group-format='-------- %dN line%(N=1?:s) added after %de:
         %&gt;' \

            --changed-group-format='-------- %dn line%(n=1?:s) changed at %df:
         %&lt;-------- to:
         %&gt;' \

            myfile

       To specify a line group format, use one of the options listed below.  You can specify  up  to  four  line
       group  formats,  one for each kind of line group.  You should quote <u>format</u>, because it typically contains
       shell metacharacters.

       <b>--old-group-format=</b><u>format</u>

         These line groups are hunks containing only lines from the first file.  The default old group format is
         the same as the changed group format if it is specified; otherwise it is a format that outputs the line
         group as-is.

       <b>--new-group-format=</b><u>format</u>

         These line groups are hunks containing only lines from the second file.  The default new  group  format
         is  same as the changed group format if it is specified; otherwise it is a format that outputs the line
         group as-is.

       <b>--changed-group-format=</b><u>format</u>

         These line groups are hunks containing lines from both files.  The default changed group format is  the
         concatenation of the old and new group formats.

       <b>--unchanged-group-format=</b><u>format</u>

         These  line  groups contain lines common to both files.  The default unchanged group format is a format
         that outputs the line group as-is.

         In a line group format, ordinary characters represent themselves; conversion specifications start  with
         <b>%</b> and have one of the following forms.

       <b>%&lt;</b>

         stands  for  the  lines  from  the  first file, including the trailing newline.  Each line is formatted
         according to the old line format (see node 'Line formats' in the CVS manual).

       <b>%&gt;</b>

         stands for the lines from the second file, including the trailing  newline.   Each  line  is  formatted
         according to the new line format.

       <b>%=</b>

         stands  for  the  lines  common  to both files, including the trailing newline.  Each line is formatted
         according to the unchanged line format.

       <b>%%</b>

         stands for <b>%</b>.

       <b>%c'</b><u>C</u><b>'</b>

         where <u>C</u> is a single character, stands for <u>C</u>.  <u>C</u> may not be a backslash or an apostrophe.  For  example,
         <b>%c':'</b>  stands  for  a  colon,  even inside the then-part of an if-then-else format, which a colon would
         normally terminate.

       <b>%c'\</b><u>O</u><b>'</b>

         where <u>O</u> is a string of 1, 2, or 3 octal digits, stands for  the  character  with  octal  code  <u>O</u>.   For
         example, <b>%c'\0'</b> stands for a null character.

       <u>Fn</u>

         where  <u>F</u>  is  a  <b>printf</b>  conversion specification and <u>n</u> is one of the following letters, stands for <u>n</u>'s
         value formatted with <u>F</u>.

         <b>e</b>

           The line number of the line just before the group in the old file.

         <b>f</b>

           The line number of the first line in the group in the old file; equals <u>e</u> + 1.

         <b>l</b>

           The line number of the last line in the group in the old file.

         <b>m</b>

           The line number of the line just after the group in the old file; equals <u>l</u> + 1.

         <b>n</b>

           The number of lines in the group in the old file; equals <u>l</u> - <u>f</u> + 1.

         <b>E,</b> <b>F,</b> <b>L,</b> <b>M,</b> <b>N</b>

           Likewise, for lines in the new file.

           The <b>printf</b> conversion specification can be <b>%d</b>, <b>%o</b>, <b>%x</b>, or <b>%X</b>, specifying decimal, octal,  lower  case
           hexadecimal,  or  upper  case hexadecimal output respectively.  After the <b>%</b> the following options can
           appear in sequence: a <b>-</b> specifying left-justification; an integer specifying the minimum field width;
           and a period followed by an optional integer specifying the minimum number of digits.   For  example,
           <b>%5dN</b>  prints  the number of new lines in the group in a field of width 5 characters, using the <b>printf</b>
           format <b>"%5d"</b>.

       <b>(</b><u>A</u><b>=</b><u>B</u><b>?</b><u>T</u><b>:</b><u>E</u><b>)</b>

         If <u>A</u> equals <u>B</u> then <u>T</u> else <u>E</u>.  <u>A</u> and <u>B</u> are each either a decimal constant or a single letter interpreted
         as above.  This format spec is equivalent to <u>T</u> if <u>A</u>'s value equals <u>B</u>'s; otherwise it is  equivalent  to
         <u>E</u>.

         For  example,  <b>%(N=0?no:%dN)</b>  <b>line%(N=1?:s)</b>  is equivalent to <b>no</b> <b>lines</b> if <u>N</u> (the number of lines in the
         group in the new file) is 0, to <b>1</b> <b>line</b> if <u>N</u> is 1, and to <b>%dN</b> <b>lines</b> otherwise.

</pre><h4><b>Line</b> <b>formats</b></h4><pre>
       Line formats control how each line taken from an input file  is  output  as  part  of  a  line  group  in
       if-then-else format.

       For  example,  the  following  command outputs text with a one-column change indicator to the left of the
       text.  The first column of output is <b>-</b> for deleted lines, <b>|</b> for added lines, and a  space  for  unchanged
       lines.  The formats contain newline characters where newlines are desired on output.

         cvs diff \

            --old-line-format='-%l
         ' \

            --new-line-format='|%l
         ' \

            --unchanged-line-format=' %l
         ' \

            myfile

       To  specify  a  line  format,  use one of the following options.  You should quote <u>format</u>, since it often
       contains shell metacharacters.

       <b>--old-line-format=</b><u>format</u>

         formats lines just from the first file.

       <b>--new-line-format=</b><u>format</u>

         formats lines just from the second file.

       <b>--unchanged-line-format=</b><u>format</u>

         formats lines common to both files.

       <b>--line-format=</b><u>format</u>

         formats all lines; in effect, it sets all three above options simultaneously.

         In a line format, ordinary characters represent themselves; conversion specifications start with <b>%</b>  and
         have one of the following forms.

       <b>%l</b>

         stands  for  the contents of the line, not counting its trailing newline (if any).  This format ignores
         whether the line is incomplete.

       <b>%L</b>

         stands for the contents of the line, including its trailing newline (if any).  If a line is incomplete,
         this format preserves its incompleteness.

       <b>%%</b>

         stands for <b>%</b>.

       <b>%c'</b><u>C</u><b>'</b>

         where <u>C</u> is a single character, stands for <u>C</u>.  <u>C</u> may not be a backslash or an apostrophe.  For  example,
         <b>%c':'</b> stands for a colon.

       <b>%c'\</b><u>O</u><b>'</b>

         where  <u>O</u>  is  a  string  of  1,  2, or 3 octal digits, stands for the character with octal code <u>O</u>.  For
         example, <b>%c'\0'</b> stands for a null character.

       <u>F</u><b>n</b>

         where <u>F</u> is a <b>printf</b> conversion specification, stands  for  the  line  number  formatted  with  <u>F</u>.   For
         example, <b>%.5dn</b> prints the line number using the <b>printf</b> format <b>"%.5d"</b>.  See node 'Line group formats' in
         the CVS manual, for more about printf conversion specifications.

         The default line format is <b>%l</b> followed by a newline character.

         If the input contains tab characters and it is important that they line up on output, you should ensure
         that  <b>%l</b>  or  <b>%L</b>  in  a  line  format  is  just after a tab stop (e.g. by preceding <b>%l</b> or <b>%L</b> with a tab
         character), or you should use the <b>-t</b> or <b>--expand-tabs</b> option.

         Taken together, the line and line group formats let you specify many different formats.   For  example,
         the  following  command  uses a format similar to <b>diff</b>'s normal format.  You can tailor this command to
         get fine control over <b>diff</b>'s output.

         cvs diff \

            --old-line-format='&lt; %l
         ' \

            --new-line-format='&gt; %l
         ' \

            --old-group-format='%df%(f=l?:,%dl)d%dE
         %&lt;' \

            --new-group-format='%dea%dF%(F=L?:,%dL)
         %&gt;' \

            --changed-group-format='%df%(f=l?:,%dl)c%dF%(F=L?:,%dL)
         %&lt;—
         %&gt;' \

            --unchanged-group-format='' \

            myfile

</pre><h4><b>diff</b> <b>examples</b></h4><pre>
       The following line produces a Unidiff (<b>-u</b> flag) between revision 1.14 and 1.19 of <b>backend.c</b>.  Due to  the
       <b>-kk</b>  flag  no  keywords  are  substituted,  so  differences  that only depend on keyword substitution are
       ignored.

         $ cvs diff -kk -u -r 1.14 -r 1.19 backend.c

       Suppose the experimental branch EXPR1 was based on a set of files tagged RELEASE_1_0.  To  see  what  has
       happened on that branch, the following can be used:

         $ cvs diff -r RELEASE_1_0 -r EXPR1

       A command like this can be used to produce a context diff between two releases:

         $ cvs diff -c -r RELEASE_1_0 -r RELEASE_1_1 &gt; diffs

       If  you  are maintaining ChangeLogs, a command like the following just before you commit your changes may
       help you write the ChangeLog entry.  All local modifications that have not yet  been  committed  will  be
       printed.

         $ cvs diff -u | less

</pre><h4><b>export,</b> <b>history,</b> <b>diff,</b> <b>CVS</b> <b>commands</b></h4><pre>
   <b>export—Export</b> <b>sources</b> <b>from</b> <b>CVS,</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>checkout</b>
       • Synopsis: export [-flNnR] (-r rev[:date] | -D date) [-k subst] [-d dir] module...

       • Requires: repository.

       • Changes: current directory.

         This command is a variant of <b>checkout</b>; use it when you want a copy of the source for module without the
         <b>cvs</b>  administrative  directories.   For  example,  you  might use <b>export</b> to prepare source for shipment
         off-site.  This command requires that you specify a date or tag (with <b>-D</b> or <b>-r</b>), so that you can  count
         on reproducing the source you ship to others (and thus it always prunes empty directories).

         One  often would like to use <b>-kv</b> with <b>cvs</b> <b>export</b>.  This causes any keywords to be expanded such that an
         import done at some other site will not lose the keyword  revision  information.   But  be  aware  that
         doesn't  handle an export containing binary files correctly.  Also be aware that after having used <b>-kv</b>,
         one can no longer use the <b>ident</b> command (which is part of the <b>rcs</b> suite—see <a href="../man1/ident.1.html">ident</a>(1)) which  looks  for
         keyword strings.  If you want to be able to use <b>ident</b> you must not use <b>-kv</b>.

</pre><h4><b>export</b> <b>options</b></h4><pre>
       These  standard  options  are  supported  by  <b>export</b>  (see node 'Common options' in the CVS manual, for a
       complete description of them):

       <b>-D</b> <u>date</u>

         Use the most recent revision no later than <u>date</u>.

       <b>-f</b>

         If no matching revision is found, retrieve the most recent revision (instead of ignoring the file).

       <b>-l</b>

         Local; run only in current working directory.

       <b>-n</b>

         Do not run any checkout program.

       <b>-R</b>

         Export directories recursively.  This is on by default.

       <b>-r</b> <u>tag</u><b>[:</b><u>date</u><b>]</b>

         Export the revision specified by <u>tag</u> or, when <u>date</u> is specified and <u>tag</u> is a branch  tag,  the  version
         from the branch <u>tag</u> as it existed on <u>date</u>.  See node 'Common options' in the CVS manual.

         In addition, these options (that are common to <b>checkout</b> and <b>export</b>) are also supported:

       <b>-d</b> <u>dir</u>

         Create  a  directory  called  <u>dir</u>  for  the  working files, instead of using the module name.  See node
         'checkout options' in the CVS manual, for complete details on how <b>cvs</b> handles this flag.

       <b>-k</b> <u>subst</u>

         Set keyword expansion mode (see node 'Substitution modes' in the CVS manual).

       <b>-N</b>

         Only useful together with <b>-d</b> <u>dir</u>.  See node 'checkout options' in the CVS manual, for complete  details
         on how <b>cvs</b> handles this flag.

</pre><h4><b>history,</b> <b>import,</b> <b>export,</b> <b>CVS</b> <b>commands</b></h4><pre>
   <b>history—Show</b> <b>repository</b> <b>access</b> <b>history</b>
       • Synopsis:     history [-report] [-flags] [-options args] [files...]

       • Requires: the file <b>$CVSROOT/CVSROOT/history</b>

       • Changes: nothing.

         <b>cvs</b>  can  keep a history log that tracks each use of most <b>cvs</b> commands.  You can use <b>history</b> to display
         this information in various formats.

         To enable logging, the <b>LogHistory</b> config option must be set to some value other than the  empty  string
         and  the  history file specified by the <b>HistoryLogPath</b> option must be writable by all users who may run
         the <b>cvs</b> executable (see node 'config' in the CVS manual).

         To enable the <b>history</b> command, logging must be enabled as above and the <b>HistorySearchPath</b> config option
         (see node 'config' in the CVS manual) must be set to specify some number of the  history  logs  created
         thereby and these files must be readable by each user who might run the <b>history</b> command.

         Creating  a  repository via the <b>cvs</b> <b>init</b> command will enable logging of all possible events to a single
         history log file (<b>$CVSROOT/CVSROOT/history</b>) with read and write permissions for  all  users  (see  node
         'Creating a repository' in the CVS manual).

         <u>Note:</u>  <b>history</b>  <u>uses</u>  <b>-f</b><u>,</u> <b>-l</b><u>,</u> <b>-n</b><u>,</u> <u>and</u> <b>-p</b> <u>in</u> <u>ways</u> <u>that</u> <u>conflict</u> <u>with</u> <u>the</u> <u>normal</u> <u>use</u> <u>inside</u> <b>cvs</b> <u>(see</u> <u>node</u>
         <u>'Common</u> <u>options'</u> <u>in</u> <u>the</u> <u>CVS</u> <u>manual).</u>

</pre><h4><b>history</b> <b>options</b></h4><pre>
       Several options (shown above as <b>-report</b>)  control  what kind of report is generated:

       <b>-c</b>

         Report on each time commit was used (i.e., each time the repository was modified).

       <b>-e</b>

         Everything (all record types).  Equivalent to specifying <b>-x</b> with all record types.  Of course, <b>-e</b>  will
         also include record types which are added in a future version of <b>cvs</b>; if you are writing a script which
         can only handle certain record types, you'll want to specify <b>-x</b>.

       <b>-m</b> <u>module</u>

         Report on a particular module.  (You can meaningfully use <b>-m</b> more than once on the command line.)

       <b>-o</b>

         Report on checked-out modules.  This is the default report type.

       <b>-T</b>

         Report on all tags.

       <b>-x</b> <u>type</u>

         Extract  a particular set of record types <u>type</u> from the <b>cvs</b> history.  The types are indicated by single
         letters, which you may specify in combination.

         Certain commands have a single record type:

         <b>F</b>

           release

         <b>O</b>

           checkout

         <b>E</b>

           export

         <b>T</b>

           rtag

           One of five record types may result from an update:

         <b>C</b>

           A merge was necessary but collisions were detected (requiring manual merging).

         <b>G</b>

           A merge was necessary and it succeeded.

         <b>U</b>

           A working file was copied from the repository.

         <b>P</b>

           A working file was patched to match the repository.

         <b>W</b>

           The working copy of a file was deleted during update (because it was gone from the repository).

           One of three record types results from commit:

         <b>A</b>

           A file was added for the first time.

         <b>M</b>

           A file was modified.

         <b>R</b>

           A file was removed.

           The options shown as <b>-flags</b> constrain or expand the report without requiring option arguments:

       <b>-a</b>

         Show data for all users (the default is to show data only for the user executing <b>history</b>).

       <b>-l</b>

         Show last modification only.

       <b>-w</b>

         Show only the records for  modifications  done  from  the  same  working  directory  where  <b>history</b>  is
         executing.

         The options shown as <b>-options</b> <u>args</u> constrain the report based on an argument:

       <b>-b</b> <u>str</u>

         Show  data  back to a record containing  the  string <u>str</u>  in  either the module name, the file name, or
         the repository path.

       <b>-D</b> <u>date</u>

         Show data since <u>date</u>.  This is slightly different from the normal use of <b>-D</b>  <u>date</u>,  which  selects  the
         newest revision older than <u>date</u>.

       <b>-f</b> <u>file</u>

         Show data for a particular file (you can specify several <b>-f</b> options on the same command line).  This is
         equivalent to specifying the file on the command line.

       <b>-n</b> <u>module</u>

         Show data for a particular module (you can specify several <b>-n</b> options on the same command line).

       <b>-p</b> <u>repository</u>

         Show  data  for a particular source repository  (you can specify several <b>-p</b> options on the same command
         line).

       <b>-r</b> <u>rev</u>

         Show records referring to revisions since the revision or tag  named  <u>rev</u>  appears  in  individual  <b>rcs</b>
         files.  Each <b>rcs</b> file is searched for the revision or tag.

       <b>-t</b> <u>tag</u>

         Show  records since tag <u>tag</u> was last added to the history file.  This differs from the <b>-r</b> flag above in
         that it reads only the history file, not the <b>rcs</b> files, and is much faster.

       <b>-u</b> <u>name</u>

         Show records for user <u>name</u>.

       <b>-z</b> <u>timezone</u>

         Show times in the selected records using the specified time zone instead of UTC.

</pre><h4><b>import,</b> <b>log,</b> <b>history,</b> <b>CVS</b> <b>commands</b></h4><pre>
   <b>import—Import</b> <b>sources</b> <b>into</b> <b>CVS,</b> <b>using</b> <b>vendor</b> <b>branches</b>
       • Synopsis: import [-options] repository vendortag releasetag...

       • Requires: Repository, source distribution directory.

       • Changes: repository.

         Use <b>import</b> to incorporate an entire source distribution from an outside source (e.g., a source  vendor)
         into  your  source  repository  directory.   You  can  use  this command both for initial creation of a
         repository, and for wholesale updates to the module  from  the  outside  source.   See  node  'Tracking
         sources' in the CVS manual, for a discussion on this subject.

         The  <u>repository</u> argument gives a directory name (or a path to a directory) under the <b>cvs</b> root directory
         for repositories; if the directory did not exist, import creates it.

         When you use import for updates to source that has been modified in your  source  repository  (since  a
         prior  import),  it  will notify you of any files that conflict in the two branches of development; use
         <b>checkout</b> <b>-j</b> to reconcile the differences, as import instructs you to do.

         If <b>cvs</b> decides a file should be ignored (see node 'cvsignore' in the CVS manual), it does not import it
         and prints <b>I</b>  followed by the filename (see node 'import output' in the  CVS  manual,  for  a  complete
         description of the output).

         If  the file <b>$CVSROOT/CVSROOT/cvswrappers</b> exists, any file whose names match the specifications in that
         file will be treated as packages and the appropriate filtering will be performed on the  file/directory
         before being imported.  See node 'Wrappers' in the CVS manual.

         The  outside  source  is  saved  in a first-level branch, by default 1.1.1.  Updates are leaves of this
         branch; for example, files from the first imported collection of source will be revision 1.1.1.1,  then
         files from the first imported update will be revision 1.1.1.2, and so on.

         At  least  three  arguments  are  required.  <u>repository</u> is needed to identify the collection of source.
         <u>vendortag</u> is a tag for the entire branch (e.g., for  1.1.1).   You  must  also  specify  at  least  one
         <u>releasetag</u>  to  uniquely  identify  the  files at the leaves created each time you execute <b>import</b>.  The
         <u>releasetag</u> should be new, not previously existing in the repository file,  and  uniquely  identify  the
         imported release,

         Note  that <b>import</b> does <u>not</u> change the directory in which you invoke it.  In particular, it does not set
         up that directory as a <b>cvs</b> working directory; if you want to work with the sources  import  them  first
         and then check them out into a different directory (see node 'Getting the source' in the CVS manual).

</pre><h4><b>import</b> <b>options</b></h4><pre>
       This  standard option is supported by <b>import</b> (see node 'Common options' in the CVS manual, for a complete
       description):

       <b>-m</b> <u>message</u>

         Use <u>message</u> as log information, instead of invoking an editor.

         There are the following additional special options.

       <b>-b</b> <u>branch</u>

         See node 'Multiple vendor branches' in the CVS manual.

       <b>-k</b> <u>subst</u>

         Indicate the keyword expansion mode desired.  This setting will apply to all files created  during  the
         import,  but not to any files that previously existed in the repository.  See node 'Substitution modes'
         in the CVS manual, for a list of valid <b>-k</b> settings.

       <b>-I</b> <u>name</u>

         Specify file names that should be ignored during import.  You can use this option repeatedly.  To avoid
         ignoring any files at all (even those ignored by default), specify `-I !'.

         <u>name</u> can be a file name pattern of the same type that you can specify in the <b>.cvsignore</b> file.  See node
         'cvsignore' in the CVS manual.

       <b>-W</b> <u>spec</u>

         Specify file names that should be filtered during import.  You can use this option repeatedly.

         <u>spec</u> can be a file name pattern of the same type that you can specify in  the  <b>.cvswrappers</b>  file.  See
         node 'Wrappers' in the CVS manual.

       <b>-X</b>

         Modify  the  algorithm used by <b>cvs</b> when importing new files so that new files do not immediately appear
         on the main trunk.

         Specifically, this flag causes <b>cvs</b> to mark new files as if they were deleted  on  the  main  trunk,  by
         taking  the following steps for each file in addition to those normally taken on import: creating a new
         revision on the main trunk indicating that the new file is  <b>dead</b>,  resetting  the  new  file's  default
         branch, and placing the file in the Attic (see node 'Attic' in the CVS manual) directory.

         Setting  the  <b>ImportNewFilesToVendorBranchOnly</b>  option  in CVSROOT/config (see node 'config' in the CVS
         manual) forces use of this option on a repository-wide basis.

</pre><h4><b>import</b> <b>output</b></h4><pre>
       <b>import</b> keeps you informed of its progress by printing a line for each file,  preceded  by  one  character
       indicating the status of the file:

       <b>U</b> <u>file</u>

         The  file  already  exists in the repository and has not been locally modified; a new revision has been
         created (if necessary).

       <b>N</b> <u>file</u>

         The file is a new file which has been added to the repository.

       <b>C</b> <u>file</u>

         The file already exists in the repository but has been locally modified; you will  have  to  merge  the
         changes.

       <b>I</b> <u>file</u>

         The file is being ignored (see node 'cvsignore' in the CVS manual).

       <b>L</b> <u>file</u>

         The  file is a symbolic link; <b>cvs</b> <b>import</b> ignores symbolic links.  People periodically suggest that this
         behavior should be changed, but if there is a consensus on what it should be  changed  to,  it  is  not
         apparent.   (Various  options  in  the <b>modules</b> file can be used to recreate symbolic links on checkout,
         update, etc.; see node 'modules' in the CVS manual.)

</pre><h4><b>import</b> <b>examples</b></h4><pre>
       See node 'Tracking sources' in the CVS manual, and node 'From files' in the CVS manual.

</pre><h4><b>log,</b> <b>ls</b> <b>&amp;</b> <b>rls,</b> <b>import,</b> <b>CVS</b> <b>commands</b></h4><pre>
   <b>log—Print</b> <b>out</b> <b>history</b> <b>information</b> <b>for</b> <b>files</b>
       • Synopsis: log [options] [files...]

         rlog [options] [files...]

       • Requires: repository, working directory.

       • Changes: nothing.

         Display log information for files.  <b>log</b> used to call the <b>rcs</b> utility <b>rlog</b>.  Although this is no  longer
         true  in  the  current sources, this history determines the format of the output and the options, which
         are not quite in the style of the other <b>cvs</b> commands.

         The output includes the location of the <b>rcs</b> file, the <u>head</u> revision (the latest revision on the trunk),
         all symbolic names (tags) and some other things.  For each revision, the revision number, the date, the
         author, the number of lines added/deleted, the commitid and the log message are printed.  All dates are
         displayed in local time at the client. This is typically specified in  the  <b>$TZ</b>  environment  variable,
         which can be set to govern how <b>log</b> displays dates.

         <u>Note:</u>  <b>log</b> <u>uses</u> <b>-R</b> <u>in</u> <u>a</u> <u>way</u> <u>that</u> <u>conflicts</u> <u>with</u> <u>the</u> <u>normal</u> <u>use</u> <u>inside</u> <b>cvs</b> <u>(see</u> <u>node</u> <u>'Common</u> <u>options'</u> <u>in</u>
         <u>the</u> <u>CVS</u> <u>manual).</u>

</pre><h4><b>log</b> <b>options</b></h4><pre>
       By default, <b>log</b> prints all information that is available.  All other options restrict the  output.   Note
       that  the  revision  selection options (<b>-d</b>, <b>-r</b>, <b>-s</b>, and <b>-w</b>) have no effect, other than possibly causing a
       search for files in Attic directories, when used in conjunction with the options that restrict the output
       to only <b>log</b> header fields (<b>-b</b>, <b>-h</b>, <b>-R</b>, and <b>-t</b>) unless the <b>-S</b> option is also specified.

       <b>-b</b>

         Print information about the revisions on the default branch, normally the highest branch on the trunk.

       <b>-d</b> <u>dates</u>

         Print  information  about  revisions  with  a  checkin  date/time   in   the   range   given   by   the
         semicolon-separated  list  of  dates.  The date formats accepted are those accepted by the <b>-D</b> option to
         many other <b>cvs</b> commands (see node 'Common options' in the CVS manual).   Dates  can  be  combined  into
         ranges as follows:

         <u>d1</u><b>&lt;</b><u>d2</u>

         <u>d2</u><b>&gt;</b><u>d1</u>

           Select the revisions that were deposited between <u>d1</u> and <u>d2</u>.

         <b>&lt;</b><u>d</u>

         <u>d</u><b>&gt;</b>

           Select all revisions dated <u>d</u> or earlier.

         <u>d</u><b>&lt;</b>

         <b>&gt;</b><u>d</u>

           Select all revisions dated <u>d</u> or later.

         <u>d</u>

           Select the single, latest revision dated <u>d</u> or earlier.

           The  <b>&gt;</b>  or  <b>&lt;</b> characters may be followed by <b>=</b> to indicate an inclusive range rather than an exclusive
           one.

           Note that the separator is a semicolon (;).

       <b>-h</b>

         Print only the name of the <b>rcs</b> file, name of the file in the working directory, head,  default  branch,
         access list, locks, symbolic names, and suffix.

       <b>-l</b>

         Local; run only in current working directory.  (Default is to run recursively).

       <b>-N</b>

         Do  not print the list of tags for this file.  This option can be very useful when your site uses a lot
         of tags, so rather than "more"'ing over 3 pages of tag information, the log  information  is  presented
         without tags at all.

       <b>-R</b>

         Print only the name of the <b>rcs</b> file.

       <b>-r</b><u>revisions</u>

         Print  information about revisions given in the comma-separated list <u>revisions</u> of revisions and ranges.
         The following table explains the available range formats:

         <u>rev1</u><b>:</b><u>rev2</u>

           Revisions <u>rev1</u> to <u>rev2</u> (which must be on the same branch).

         <u>rev1</u><b>::</b><u>rev2</u>

           The same, but excluding <u>rev1</u>.

         <b>:</b><u>rev</u>

         <b>::</b><u>rev</u>

           Revisions from the beginning of the branch up to and including <u>rev</u>.

         <u>rev</u><b>:</b>

           Revisions starting with <u>rev</u> to the end of the branch containing <u>rev</u>.

         <u>rev</u><b>::</b>

           Revisions starting just after <u>rev</u> to the end of the branch containing <u>rev</u>.

         <u>branch</u>

           An argument that is a branch means all revisions on that branch.

         <u>branch1</u><b>:</b><u>branch2</u>

         <u>branch1</u><b>::</b><u>branch2</u>

           A range of branches means all revisions on the branches in that range.

         <u>branch</u><b>.</b>

           The latest revision in <u>branch</u>.

           A bare <b>-r</b> with no revisions means the latest revision on the  default  branch,  normally  the  trunk.
           There can be no space between the <b>-r</b> option and its argument.

       <b>-S</b>

         Suppress the header if no revisions are selected.

       <b>-s</b> <u>states</u>

         Print  information  about  revisions  whose  state  attributes  match  one  of  the states given in the
         comma-separated list <u>states</u>.  Individual states may be any text string, though <b>cvs</b> commonly  only  uses
         two states, <b>Exp</b> and <b>dead</b>.  See node 'admin options' in the CVS manual for more information.

       <b>-t</b>

         Print the same as <b>-h</b>, plus the descriptive text.

       <b>-w</b><u>logins</u>

         Print information about revisions checked in by users with login names appearing in the comma-separated
         list  <u>logins</u>.  If <u>logins</u> is omitted, the user's login is assumed.  There can be no space between the <b>-w</b>
         option and its argument.

         <b>log</b> prints the intersection of the revisions selected with the options <b>-d</b>, <b>-s</b>, and <b>-w</b>, intersected with
         the union of the revisions selected by <b>-b</b> and <b>-r</b>.

</pre><h4><b>log</b> <b>examples</b></h4><pre>
       Since <b>log</b> shows dates in local time, you might want to see them in Coordinated Universal  Time  (UTC)  or
       some other timezone.  To do this you can set your <b>$TZ</b> environment variable before invoking <b>cvs</b>:

         $ TZ=UTC cvs log foo.c
         $ TZ=EST cvs log bar.c

       (If you are using a <b>csh</b>-style shell, like <b>tcsh</b>, you would need to prefix the examples above with <b>env</b>.)

   <b>List</b> <b>files</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>repository</b>

       • Requires: repository for <b>rls</b>, repository &amp; working directory for <b>ls</b>.

       • Changes: nothing.

       • Synonym: <b>dir</b> &amp; <b>list</b> are synonyms for <b>ls</b> and <b>rdir</b> &amp; <b>rlist</b> are synonyms for <b>rls</b>.

         The <b>ls</b> and <b>rls</b> commands are used to list files and directories in the repository.

         By  default  <b>ls</b>  lists  the  files and directories that belong in your working directory, what would be
         there after an <b>update</b>.

         By default <b>rls</b> lists the files and directories on the tip of the trunk in the topmost directory of  the
         repository.

         Both  commands  accept  an optional list of file and directory names, relative to the working directory
         for <b>ls</b> and the topmost directory of the repository for <b>rls</b>.  Neither is recursive by default.

</pre><h4><b>ls</b> <b>&amp;</b> <b>rls</b> <b>options</b></h4><pre>
       These standard options are supported by <b>ls</b> &amp; <b>rls</b>:

       <b>-d</b>

         Show dead revisions (with tag when specified).

       <b>-e</b>

         Display in CVS/Entries format.  This format is meant to remain easily parsable by automation.

       <b>-l</b>

         Display all details.

       <b>-P</b>

         Don't list contents of empty directories when recursing.

       <b>-R</b>

         List recursively.

       <b>-r</b> <u>tag</u><b>[:</b><u>date</u><b>]</b>

         Show files specified by <u>tag</u> or, when <u>date</u> is specified and <u>tag</u> is a branch tag, the  version  from  the
         branch <u>tag</u> as it existed on <u>date</u>.  See node 'Common options' in the CVS manual.

       <b>-D</b> <u>date</u>

         Show files from date.

         Builds  a Larry Wall format <a href="../man1/patch.1.html">patch</a>(1) file between two releases, that can be fed directly into the <b>patch</b>
         program to bring an old release up-to-date with the new release.  (This is one of the few <b>cvs</b>  commands
         that  operates  directly from the repository, and doesn't require a prior checkout.) The diff output is
         sent to the standard output device.

         You can specify (using the standard <b>-r</b> and <b>-D</b> options) any combination  of  one  or  two  revisions  or
         dates.   If  only  one  revision or date is specified, the patch file reflects differences between that
         revision or date and the current head revisions in the <b>rcs</b> file.

         Note that if the software release affected is contained in more than one  directory,  then  it  may  be
         necessary to specify the <b>-p</b> option to the <b>patch</b> command when patching the old sources, so that <b>patch</b> is
         able to find the files that are located in other directories.

</pre><h4><b>rdiff</b> <b>options</b></h4><pre>
       These  standard  options  are  supported  by  <b>rdiff</b>  (see  node 'Common options' in the CVS manual, for a
       complete description of them):

       <b>-D</b> <u>date</u>

         Use the most recent revision no later than <u>date</u>.

       <b>-f</b>

         If no matching revision is found, retrieve the most recent revision (instead of ignoring the file).

       <b>-k</b> <u>kflag</u>

         Process keywords according to <u>kflag</u>.  See node 'Keyword substitution' in the CVS manual.

       <b>-l</b>

         Local; don't descend subdirectories.

       <b>-R</b>

         Examine directories recursively.  This option is on by default.

       <b>-r</b> <u>tag</u>

         Use the revision specified by <u>tag</u>, or when <u>date</u> is specified and <u>tag</u> is a branch tag, the version  from
         the branch <u>tag</u> as it existed on <u>date</u>.  See node 'Common options' in the CVS manual.

         In addition to the above, these options are available:

       <b>-c</b>

         Use the context diff format.  This is the default format.

       <b>-p</b>

         Show which C function each change is in.

       <b>-s</b>

         Create  a  summary change report instead of a patch.  The summary includes information about files that
         were changed or added between the releases.  It is sent to the standard output device.  This is  useful
         for finding out, for example, which files have changed between two dates or revisions.

       <b>-t</b>

         A  diff of the top two revisions is sent to the standard output device.  This is most useful for seeing
         what the last change to a file was.

       <b>-u</b>

         Use the unidiff format for the context diffs.  Remember that old versions of the  <b>patch</b>  program  can't
         handle the unidiff format, so if you plan to post this patch to the net you should probably not use <b>-u</b>.

       <b>-V</b> <u>vn</u>

         Expand keywords according to the rules current in <b>rcs</b> version <u>vn</u> (the expansion format changed with <b>rcs</b>
         version 5).  Note that this option is no longer accepted.  <b>cvs</b> will always expand keywords the way that
         <b>rcs</b> version 5 does.

</pre><h4><b>rdiff</b> <b>examples</b></h4><pre>
       Suppose  you  receive  mail  from  <a href="mailto:foo@example.net">foo@example.net</a> asking for an update from release 1.2 to 1.4 of the tc
       compiler.  You have no such patches on hand, but with <b>cvs</b> that can easily be fixed with a command such as
       this:

         $ cvs rdiff -c -r FOO1_2 -r FOO1_4 tc | \
         $$ Mail -s 'The patches you asked for' <a href="mailto:foo@example.net">foo@example.net</a>

       Suppose you have made release  1.3,  and  forked  a  branch  called  <b>R_1_3fix</b>  for  bug  fixes.   <b>R_1_3_1</b>
       corresponds  to  release  1.3.1, which was made some time ago.  Now, you want to see how much development
       has been done on the branch.  This command can be used:

         $ cvs patch -s -r R_1_3_1 -r R_1_3fix module-name
         cvs rdiff: Diffing module-name
         File ChangeLog,v changed from revision 1.52.2.5 to 1.52.2.6
         File foo.c,v changed from revision 1.52.2.3 to 1.52.2.4
         File bar.h,v changed from revision 1.29.2.1 to 1.2

</pre><h4><b>release,</b> <b>server</b> <b>&amp;</b> <b>pserver,</b> <b>rdiff,</b> <b>CVS</b> <b>commands</b></h4><pre>
   <b>release—Indicate</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>directory</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>in</b> <b>use</b>
       • release [-d] directories...

       • Requires: Working directory.

       • Changes: Working directory, history log.

         This command is meant to safely cancel the effect of <b>cvs</b> <b>checkout</b>.  Since <b>cvs</b> doesn't  lock  files,  it
         isn't  strictly necessary to use this command.  You can always simply delete your working directory, if
         you like; but you risk losing changes you may have forgotten, and you leave no trace in the <b>cvs</b> history
         file (see node 'history file' in the CVS manual) that you've abandoned your checkout.

         Use <b>cvs</b> <b>release</b> to avoid these problems.  This command checks that no uncommitted changes are  present;
         that  you  are  executing  it  from  immediately above a <b>cvs</b> working directory; and that the repository
         recorded for your files is the same as the repository defined in the module database.

         If all these conditions are true, <b>cvs</b> <b>release</b> leaves a record  of  its  execution  (attesting  to  your
         intentionally abandoning your checkout) in the <b>cvs</b> history log.

</pre><h4><b>release</b> <b>options</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>release</b> command supports one command option:

       <b>-d</b>

         Delete  your  working  copy  of the file if the release succeeds.  If this flag is not given your files
         will remain in your working directory.

         <u>WARNING:</u>  <u>The</u> <b>release</b> <u>command</u> <u>deletes</u> <u>all</u> <u>directories</u> <u>and</u> <u>files</u> <u>recursively.</u>  <u>This</u> <u>has</u> <u>the</u> <u>very</u> <u>serious</u>
         <u>side-effect</u> <u>that</u> <u>any</u> <u>directory</u> <u>that</u> <u>you</u> <u>have</u> <u>created</u> <u>inside</u> <u>your</u> <u>checked-out</u> <u>sources,</u> <u>and</u> <u>not</u> <u>added</u>  <u>to</u>
         <u>the</u>  <u>repository</u>  <u>(using</u>  <u>the</u>  <b>add</b>  <u>command;</u> <u>see</u> <u>node</u> <u>'Adding</u> <u>files'</u> <u>in</u> <u>the</u> <u>CVS</u> <u>manual)</u> <u>will</u> <u>be</u> <u>silently</u>
         <u>deleted—even</u> <u>if</u> <u>it</u> <u>is</u> <u>non-empty!</u>

</pre><h4><b>release</b> <b>output</b></h4><pre>
       Before <b>release</b> releases your sources it  will  print  a  one-line  message  for  any  file  that  is  not
       up-to-date.

       <b>U</b> <u>file</u>

       <b>P</b> <u>file</u>

         There exists a newer revision of this file in the repository, and you have not modified your local copy
         of the file (<b>U</b> and <b>P</b> mean the same thing).

       <b>A</b> <u>file</u>

         The  file  has  been  added  to your private copy of the sources, but has not yet been committed to the
         repository.  If you delete your copy of the sources this file will be lost.

       <b>R</b> <u>file</u>

         The file has been removed from your private copy of the sources, but has not yet been removed from  the
         repository, since you have not yet committed the removal.  See node 'commit' in the CVS manual.

       <b>M</b> <u>file</u>

         The  file  is  modified  in  your  working  directory.  There might also be a newer revision inside the
         repository.

       <b>?</b> <u>file</u>

         <u>file</u> is in your working directory, but does not correspond to anything in the source repository, and is
         not in the list of files for <b>cvs</b> to ignore (see  the  description  of  the  <b>-I</b>  option,  and  see  node
         'cvsignore' in the CVS manual).  If you remove your working sources, this file will be lost.

</pre><h4><b>release</b> <b>examples</b></h4><pre>
       Release the <b>tc</b> directory, and delete your local working copy of the files.

         server [-c path]

       • Requires: repository, client conversation on stdin/stdout

       • Changes: Repository or, indirectly, client working directory.

         The  <b>cvs</b> <b>server</b> and <b>pserver</b> commands are used to provide repository access to remote clients and expect
         a client conversation on stdin &amp; stdout.  Typically these commands are launched from <b>inetd</b> or  via  <b>ssh</b>
         (see node 'Remote repositories' in the CVS manual).

         <b>server</b>  expects  that the client has already been authenticated somehow, typically via <b>ssh</b>, and <b>pserver</b>
         attempts to authenticate the client itself.

         Only one option is available with the <b>server</b> and <b>pserver</b> commands:

       <b>-c</b> <b>path</b>

         Load configuration from the given <u>path</u> rather than from the  default  location  <b>$CVSROOT/CVSROOT/config</b>
         (see  node  'config'  in  the  CVS manual).  <u>path</u> must be <b>/etc/cvs.conf</b> or prefixed by <b>/etc/cvs/</b>.  This
         option is supported beginning with <b>cvs</b> release 1.12.13.

         Output consists of the real pathname of the comma-v file, relative to the CVS repository, followed by a

       • update [-ACdflPpR] [-I name] [-j rev [-j rev]] [-k kflag] [-r tag[:date] | -D date] [-W spec] files...

       • Requires: repository, working directory.

       • Changes: working directory.

         After you've run checkout to create your private copy of  source  from  the  common  repository,  other
         developers will continue changing the central source.  From time to time, when it is convenient in your
         development  process,  you  can  use the <b>update</b> command from within your working directory to reconcile
         your work with any revisions applied to the source repository  since  your  last  checkout  or  update.
         Without the <b>-C</b> option, <b>update</b> will also merge any differences between the local copy of files and their
         base revisions into any destination revisions specified with <b>-r</b>, <b>-D</b>, or <b>-A</b>.

</pre><h4><b>update</b> <b>options</b></h4><pre>
       These  standard  options  are  available  with <b>update</b> (see node 'Common options' in the CVS manual, for a
       complete description of them):

       <b>-D</b> <b>date</b>

         Use the most recent revision no later than <u>date</u>.  This option is sticky,  and  implies  <b>-P</b>.   See  node
         'Sticky tags' in the CVS manual, for more information on sticky tags/dates.

       <b>-f</b>

         Only  useful  with  the  <b>-D</b>  or  <b>-r</b>  flags.  If no matching revision is found, retrieve the most recent
         revision (instead of ignoring the file).

       <b>-k</b> <u>kflag</u>

         Process keywords according to <u>kflag</u>.  See node 'Keyword substitution' in the CVS manual.   This  option
         is  sticky;  future updates of this file in this working directory will use the same <u>kflag</u>.  The <b>status</b>
         command can be viewed to see the sticky options.  See node 'Invoking CVS' in the CVS manual,  for  more
         information on the <b>status</b> command.

       <b>-l</b>

         Local; run only in current working directory.  See node 'Recursive behavior' in the CVS manual.

       <b>-P</b>

         Prune empty directories.  See node 'Moving directories' in the CVS manual.

       <b>-p</b>

         Pipe files to the standard output.

       <b>-R</b>

         Update directories recursively (default).  See node 'Recursive behavior' in the CVS manual.

       <b>-r</b> <u>tag</u><b>[:</b><u>date</u><b>]</b>

         Retrieve the revisions specified by <u>tag</u> or, when <u>date</u> is specified and <u>tag</u> is a branch tag, the version
         from  the  branch  <u>tag</u> as it existed on <u>date</u>.  This option is sticky, and implies <b>-P</b>.  See node 'Sticky
         tags' in the CVS manual, for more information on sticky tags/dates. Also see node 'Common  options'  in
         the CVS manual.

         These special options are also available with <b>update</b>.

       <b>-A</b>

         Reset  any  sticky  tags,  dates,  or  <b>-k</b>  options.  See node 'Sticky tags' in the CVS manual, for more
         information on sticky tags/dates.

       <b>-C</b>

         Overwrite locally modified files with clean copies from the repository (the modified file is  saved  in
         <b>.#</b><u>file</u><b>.</b><u>revision</u>, however).

       <b>-d</b>

         Create  any  directories  that  exist  in the repository if they're missing from the working directory.
         Normally, <b>update</b> acts only on directories  and  files  that  were  already  enrolled  in  your  working
         directory.

         This is useful for updating directories that were created in the repository since the initial checkout;
         but  it  has  an  unfortunate  side  effect.   If  you  deliberately avoided certain directories in the
         repository when you created your working directory (either through use of a module name or  by  listing
         explicitly the files and directories you wanted on the command line), then updating with <b>-d</b> will create
         those directories, which may not be what you want.

       <b>-I</b> <u>name</u>

         Ignore  files whose names match <u>name</u> (in your working directory) during the update.  You can specify <b>-I</b>
         more than once on the command line to specify several files to ignore.  Use <b>-I</b> <b>!</b> to avoid ignoring  any
         files at all.  See node 'cvsignore' in the CVS manual, for other ways to make <b>cvs</b> ignore some files.

       <b>-W</b><u>spec</u>

         Specify file names that should be filtered during update.  You can use this option repeatedly.

         <u>spec</u>  can  be  a  file name pattern of the same type that you can specify in the <b>.cvswrappers</b> file. See
         node 'Wrappers' in the CVS manual.

       <b>-j</b><u>revision</u>

         With two <b>-j</b> options, merge changes from the revision specified with the first <b>-j</b> option to the revision
         specified with the second <b>j</b> option, into the working directory.

         With one <b>-j</b> option, merge changes from the ancestor revision to the  revision  specified  with  the  <b>-j</b>
         option, into the working directory.  The ancestor revision is the common ancestor of the revision which
         the working directory is based on, and the revision specified in the <b>-j</b> option.

         Note  that  using  a  single <b>-j</b> <u>tagname</u> option rather than <b>-j</b> <u>branchname</u> to merge changes from a branch
         will often not remove files which were removed on the branch.  See node 'Merging adds and removals'  in
         the CVS manual, for more.

         In  addition, each <b>-j</b> option can contain an optional date specification which, when used with branches,
         can limit the chosen revision to one within a specific date.  An optional date is specified by adding a
         colon (:) to the tag: <b>-j</b><u>Symbolic_Tag</u><b>:</b><u>Date_Specifier</u>.

         See node 'Branching and merging' in the CVS manual.

</pre><h4><b>update</b> <b>output</b></h4><pre>
       <b>update</b> and <b>checkout</b> keep you informed of their progress by printing a line for each file, preceded by one
       character indicating the status of the file:

       <b>U</b> <u>file</u>

         The file was brought up to date with respect to the repository.  This is done for any file that  exists
         in the repository but not in your working directory, and for files that you haven't changed but are not
         the most recent versions available in the repository.

       <b>P</b> <u>file</u>

         Like  <b>U</b>,  but the <b>cvs</b> server sends a patch instead of an entire file.  This accomplishes the same thing
         as <b>U</b> using less bandwidth.

       <b>A</b> <u>file</u>

         The file has been added to your private copy of the sources, and will be added to the source repository
         when you run <b>commit</b> on the file.  This is a reminder to you that the file needs to be committed.

       <b>R</b> <u>file</u>

         The file has been removed from your private copy of the sources, and will be removed  from  the  source
         repository  when  you  run  <b>commit</b>  on  the  file.  This is a reminder to you that the file needs to be
         committed.

       <b>M</b> <u>file</u>

         The file is modified in  your  working  directory.

         <b>M</b> can indicate one of two states for a file you're working on: either there were  no  modifications  to
         the  same  file  in  the  repository,  so  that  your  file  remains  as you last saw it; or there were
         modifications in the repository as well as in your copy, but they  were  merged  successfully,  without
         conflict, in your working directory.

         <b>cvs</b>  will  print  some  messages  if it merges your work, and a backup copy of your working file (as it
         looked before you ran <b>update</b>) will be made.  The exact name of that file is printed while <b>update</b> runs.

       <b>C</b> <u>file</u>

         A conflict was detected while trying to merge your  changes  to  <u>file</u>  with  changes  from  the  source
         repository.  <u>file</u> (the copy in your working directory) is now the result of attempting to merge the two
         revisions;  an  unmodified  copy  of  your  file  is  also  in  your  working  directory, with the name
         <b>.#</b><u>file</u><b>.</b><u>revision</u> where <u>revision</u> is the revision that your  modified  file  started  from.   Resolve  the
         conflict  as  described  in  node  'Conflicts  example'  in  the  CVS  manual.  (Note that some systems
         automatically purge files that begin with <b>.#</b> if they have not been accessed for a  few  days.   If  you
         intend to keep a copy of your original file, it is a very good idea to rename it.)  Under <b>vms</b>, the file
         name starts with <b>__</b> rather than <b>.#</b>.

       <b>?</b> <u>file</u>

         <u>file</u> is in your working directory, but does not correspond to anything in the source repository, and is
         not  in  the  list  of  files  for  <b>cvs</b>  to  ignore (see the description of the <b>-I</b> option, and see node
         'cvsignore' in the CVS manual).
