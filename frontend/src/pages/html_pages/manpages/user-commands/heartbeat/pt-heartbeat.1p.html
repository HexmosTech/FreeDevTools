</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       pt-heartbeat - Monitor MySQL replication delay.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       Usage: pt-heartbeat [OPTIONS] [DSN] --update|--monitor|--check|--stop

       pt-heartbeat measures replication lag on a MySQL or PostgreSQL server.  You can use it to update a master
       or monitor a replica.  If possible, MySQL connection options are read from your .my.cnf file.

       Start daemonized process to update test.heartbeat table on master:

         pt-heartbeat -D test --update -h master-server --daemonize

       Monitor replication lag on slave:

         pt-heartbeat -D test --monitor -h slave-server

         pt-heartbeat -D test --monitor -h slave-server --dbi-driver Pg

       Check slave lag once and exit (using optional DSN to specify slave host):

         pt-heartbeat -D test --check h=slave-server

</pre><h4><b>RISKS</b></h4><pre>
       Percona Toolkit is mature, proven in the real world, and well tested, but all database tools can pose a
       risk to the system and the database server.  Before using this tool, please:

       •   Read the tool's documentation

       •   Review the tool's known "BUGS"

       •   Test the tool on a non-production server

       •   Backup your production server and verify the backups

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       pt-heartbeat  is  a two-part MySQL and PostgreSQL replication delay monitoring system that measures delay
       by looking at actual replicated data.  This avoids reliance on the replication mechanism itself, which is
       unreliable.  (For example, "SHOW SLAVE STATUS" on MySQL).

       The first part is an "--update" instance of  pt-heartbeat  that  connects  to  a  master  and  updates  a
       timestamp ("heartbeat record") every "--interval" seconds.  Since the heartbeat table may contain records
       from  multiple  masters  (see "MULTI-SLAVE HIERARCHY"), the server's ID (@@server_id) is used to identify
       records.

       The second part is a "--monitor" or "--check" instance of pt-heartbeat that connects to a slave, examines
       the replicated heartbeat record from its immediate master  or  the  specified  "--master-server-id",  and
       computes the difference from the current system time.  If replication between the slave and the master is
       delayed  or  broken,  the  computed  difference  will  be  greater  than zero and potentially increase if
       "--monitor" is specified.

       You must either manually create  the  heartbeat  table  on  the  master  or  use  "--create-table".   See
       "--create-table" for the proper heartbeat table structure.  The "MEMORY" storage engine is suggested, but
       not required of course, for MySQL.

       The  heartbeat table must contain a heartbeat row.  By default, a heartbeat row is inserted if it doesn't
       exist.  This feature can be disabled with the "--[no]insert-heartbeat-row" option in  case  the  database
       user does not have INSERT privileges.

       pt-heartbeat  depends  only on the heartbeat record being replicated to the slave, so it works regardless
       of the replication mechanism (built-in replication, a system such as Continuent Tungsten, etc).  It works
       at any depth in the replication hierarchy; for example, it will reliably report how far a slave lags  its
       master's  master's  master.   And  if  replication  is  stopped,  it  will  continue  to  work and report
       (accurately!) that the slave is falling further and further behind the master.

       pt-heartbeat has a maximum resolution of 0.01 second.  The clocks on the master and slave servers must be
       closely synchronized via NTP.  By default, "--update" checks happen on  the  edge  of  the  second  (e.g.
       00:01)  and  "--monitor"  checks  happen halfway between seconds (e.g. 00:01.5).  As long as the servers'
       clocks are closely synchronized and replication events are propagating in less than half  a  second,  pt-
       heartbeat will report zero seconds of delay.

       pt-heartbeat  will  try to reconnect if the connection has an error, but will not retry if it can't get a
       connection when it first starts.

       The "--dbi-driver" option lets you use pt-heartbeat to monitor PostgreSQL as well.   It  is  reported  to
       work well with Slony-1 replication.

</pre><h4><b>MULTI-SLAVE</b> <b>HIERARCHY</b></h4><pre>
       If  the  replication  hierarchy  has  multiple  slaves which are masters of other slaves, like "master -&gt;
       slave1 -&gt; slave2", "--update" instances can be ran on the slaves as well  as  the  master.   The  default
       heartbeat table (see "--create-table") is keyed on the "server_id" column, so each server will update the
       row where "server_id=@@server_id".

       For  "--monitor"  and "--check", if "--master-server-id" is not specified, the tool tries to discover and
       use the slave's immediate master.  If this fails, or if you want monitor lag from  another  master,  then
       you can specify the "--master-server-id" to use.

       For  example,  if the replication hierarchy is "master -&gt; slave1 -&gt; slave2" with corresponding server IDs
       1, 2 and 3, you can:

         pt-heartbeat --daemonize -D test --update -h master
         pt-heartbeat --daemonize -D test --update -h slave1

       Then check (or monitor) the replication delay from master to slave2:

         pt-heartbeat -D test --master-server-id 1 --check slave2

       Or check the replication delay from slave1 to slave2:

         pt-heartbeat -D test --master-server-id 2 --check slave2

       Stopping the "--update" instance one slave1 will not affect the instance on master.

</pre><h4><b>MASTER</b> <b>AND</b> <b>SLAVE</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       The default heartbeat table (see "--create-table") has columns for saving information from  "SHOW  MASTER
       STATUS"  and  "SHOW  SLAVE STATUS".  These columns are optional.  If any are present, their corresponding
       information will be saved.

</pre><h4><b>Percona</b> <b>XtraDB</b> <b>Cluster</b></h4><pre>
       Although pt-heartbeat should work with all  supported  versions  of  Percona  XtraDB  Cluster  (PXC),  we
       recommend using 5.5.28-23.7 and newer.

       If  you  are  setting up heartbeat instances between cluster nodes, keep in mind that, since the speed of
       the cluster is determined by its slowest node, pt-heartbeat will not report how fast the  cluster  itself
       is, but only how fast events are replicating from one node to another.

       You must specify "--master-server-id" for "--monitor" and "--check" instances.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Specify at least one of "--stop", "--update", "--monitor", or "--check".

       "--update", "--monitor", and "--check" are mutually exclusive.

       "--daemonize" and "--check" are mutually exclusive.

       This  tool  accepts additional command-line arguments.  Refer to the "SYNOPSIS" and usage information for
       details.

       --ask-pass
           Prompt for a password when connecting to MySQL.

       --charset
           short form: -A; type: string

           Default character set.  If the value is utf8, sets Perl's binmode  on  STDOUT  to  utf8,  passes  the
           mysql_enable_utf8 option to DBD::mysql, and runs SET NAMES UTF8 after connecting to MySQL.  Any other
           value sets binmode on STDOUT without the utf8 layer, and runs SET NAMES after connecting to MySQL.

       --check
           Check  slave  delay  once  and  exit.  If you also specify "--recurse", the tool will try to discover
           slave's of the given slave and check and print their lag, too.  The hostname or IP and port for  each
           slave is printed before its delay.  "--recurse" only works with MySQL.

       --check-read-only
           Check  if  the  server  has read_only enabled; If it does, the tool skips doing any inserts. See also
           "--read-only-interval"

       --config
           type: Array

           Read this comma-separated list of config files; if specified, this must be the first  option  on  the
           command line.

       --create-table
           Create the heartbeat "--table" if it does not exist.

           This option causes the table specified by "--database" and "--table" to be created with the following
           MAGIC_create_heartbeat table definition:

             CREATE TABLE heartbeat (
               ts                    <a href="../man26/varchar.26.html">varchar</a>(26) NOT NULL,
               server_id             int unsigned NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
               file                  <a href="../man255/varchar.255.html">varchar</a>(255) DEFAULT NULL,    -- SHOW MASTER STATUS
               position              bigint unsigned DEFAULT NULL, -- SHOW MASTER STATUS
               relay_master_log_file <a href="../man255/varchar.255.html">varchar</a>(255) DEFAULT NULL,    -- SHOW SLAVE STATUS
               exec_master_log_pos   bigint unsigned DEFAULT NULL  -- SHOW SLAVE STATUS
             );

           The  heartbeat table requires at least one row.  If you manually create the heartbeat table, then you
           must insert a row by doing:

             INSERT INTO heartbeat (ts, server_id) VALUES (NOW(), N);

           or if using "--utc":

             INSERT INTO heartbeat (ts, server_id) VALUES (UTC_TIMESTAMP(), N);

           where "N" is the server's ID; do not use @@server_id because it will replicate and slaves will insert
           their own server ID instead of the master's server ID.

           This is done automatically by "--create-table".

           A legacy version of the heartbeat table is still supported:

             CREATE TABLE heartbeat (
               id int NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
               ts datetime NOT NULL
             );

           Legacy tables do not support "--update" instances on each  slave  of  a  multi-slave  hierarchy  like
           "master -&gt; slave1 -&gt; slave2".  To manually insert the one required row into a legacy table:

             INSERT INTO heartbeat (id, ts) VALUES (1, NOW());

           or if using "--utc":

             INSERT INTO heartbeat (id, ts) VALUES (1, UTC_TIMESTAMP());

           The tool automatically detects if the heartbeat table is legacy.

           See also "MULTI-SLAVE HIERARCHY".

       --create-table-engine
           type: string

           Sets the engine to be used for the heartbeat table.  The default storage engine is InnoDB as of MySQL
           5.5.5.

       --daemonize
           Fork to the background and detach from the shell.  POSIX operating systems only.

       --database
           short form: -D; type: string

           The database to use for the connection.

       --dbi-driver
           default: mysql; type: string

           Specify a driver for the connection; "mysql" and "Pg" are supported.

       --defaults-file
           short form: -F; type: string

           Only read mysql options from the given file.  You must give an absolute pathname.

       --file
           type: string

           Print latest "--monitor" output to this file.

           When  "--monitor"  is  given,  prints output to the specified file instead of to STDOUT.  The file is
           opened, truncated, and closed every interval, so it will only contain  the  most  recent  statistics.
           Useful when "--daemonize" is given.

       --frames
           type: string; default: 1m,5m,15m

           Timeframes for averages.

           Specifies  the timeframes over which to calculate moving averages when "--monitor" is given.  Specify
           as a comma-separated list of numbers with suffixes.  The suffix can be s for seconds, m for  minutes,
           h for hours, or d for days.  The size of the largest frame determines the maximum memory usage, as up
           to  the specified number of per-second samples are kept in memory to calculate the averages.  You can
           specify as many timeframes as you like.

       --help
           Show help and exit.

       --host
           short form: -h; type: string

           Connect to host.

       --[no]insert-heartbeat-row
           default: yes

           Insert a heartbeat row in the "--table" if one doesn't exist.

           The heartbeat "--table" requires a heartbeat row, else there's nothing to "--update", "--monitor", or
           "--check"!  By default, the tool will insert a heartbeat row if one is not already present.  You  can
           disable  this  feature  by  specifying "--no-insert-heartbeat-row" in case the database user does not
           have INSERT privileges.

       --interval
           type: float; default: 1.0

           How often to update or check the heartbeat "--table".  Updates and checks begin on  the  first  whole
           second  then  repeat  every  "--interval" seconds for "--update" and every "--interval" plus "--skew"
           seconds for "--monitor".

           For example, if at 00:00.4 an "--update" instance is started  at  0.5  second  intervals,  the  first
           update happens at 00:01.0, the next at 00:01.5, etc.  If at 00:10.7 a "--monitor" instance is started
           at  0.05  second  intervals  with  the  default  0.5 second "--skew", then the first check happens at
           00:11.5 (00:11.0 + 0.5) which will be "--skew" seconds after  the  last  update  which,  because  the
           instances are checking at synchronized intervals, happened at 00:11.0.

           The  tool  waits  for  and  begins  on  the first whole second just to make the interval calculations
           simpler.  Therefore, the tool could wait up to 1 second before updating or checking.

           The minimum (fastest) interval is 0.01, and the maximum precision is two  decimal  places,  so  0.015
           will be rounded to 0.02.

           If  a legacy heartbeat table (see "--create-table") is used, then the maximum precision is 1s because
           the "ts" column is type "datetime".

       --log
           type: string

           Print all output to this file when daemonized.

       --master-server-id
           type: string

           Calculate delay from this master server ID for "--monitor" or "--check".  If not given,  pt-heartbeat
           attempts to connect to the server's master and determine its server id.

       --monitor
           Monitor slave delay continuously.

           Specifies  that  pt-heartbeat should check the slave's delay every second and report to STDOUT (or if
           "--file" is given, to the file instead).  The output is the current delay followed by moving averages
           over the timeframe given in "--frames".  For example,

            5s [  0.25s,  0.05s,  0.02s ]

       --fail-successive-errors
           type: int

           If specified, pt-heartbeat will fail after given number of successive DBI errors (failure to  connect
           to server or issue a query).

       --password
           short form: -p; type: string

           Password  to use when connecting.  If password contains commas they must be escaped with a backslash:
           "exam\,ple"

       --pid
           type: string

           Create the given PID file.  The tool won't start if the PID  file  already  exists  and  the  PID  it
           contains  is different than the current PID.  However, if the PID file exists and the PID it contains
           is no longer running, the tool will overwrite the PID file with the current PID.   The  PID  file  is
           removed automatically when the tool exits.

       --port
           short form: -P; type: int

           Port number to use for connection.

       --print-master-server-id
           Print  the  auto-detected  or  given "--master-server-id".  If "--check" or "--monitor" is specified,
           specifying this option will print the auto-detected or given "--master-server-id" at the end of  each
           line.

       --read-only-interval
           type: int

           When  "--check-read-only"  is  specified, the interval to sleep while the server is found to be read-
           only. If unspecified, "--interval" is used.

       --recurse
           type: int

           Check slaves recursively to this depth in "--check" mode.

           Try to discover slave servers recursively, to the specified depth.  After  discovering  servers,  run
           the check on each one of them and print the hostname (if possible), followed by the slave delay.

           This currently works only with MySQL.  See "--recursion-method".

       --recursion-method
           type: array; default: processlist,hosts

           Preferred recursion method used to find slaves.

           Possible methods are:

             METHOD       USES
             ===========  ==================
             processlist  SHOW PROCESSLIST
             hosts        SHOW SLAVE HOSTS
             none         Do not find slaves

           The  processlist  method  is  preferred because SHOW SLAVE HOSTS is not reliable.  However, the hosts
           method is required if the server uses a non-standard port (not 3306).  Usually pt-heartbeat does  the
           right  thing and finds the slaves, but you may give a preferred method and it will be used first.  If
           it doesn't find any slaves, the other methods will be tried.

       --replace
           Use "REPLACE" instead of "UPDATE" for --update.

           When running in "--update" mode, use "REPLACE" instead of  "UPDATE"  to  set  the  heartbeat  table's
           timestamp.   The  "REPLACE"  statement  is  a MySQL extension to SQL.  This option is useful when you
           don't know whether the table contains any rows or not.  It must be used in conjunction with --update.

       --run-time
           type: time

           Time to run before exiting.

       --sentinel
           type: string; default: /tmp/pt-heartbeat-sentinel

           Exit if this file exists.

       --slave-user
           type: string

           Sets the user to be used to connect to the slaves.  This parameter allows you  to  have  a  different
           user with less privileges on the slaves but that user must exist on all slaves.

       --slave-password
           type: string

           Sets  the  password  to  be  used to connect to the slaves.  It can be used with --slave-user and the
           password for the user must be the same on all slaves.

       --set-vars
           type: Array

           Set the MySQL variables in this comma-separated list of "variable=value" pairs.

           By default, the tool sets:

              wait_timeout=10000

           Variables specified on the command line override these defaults.  For example, specifying "--set-vars
           wait_timeout=500" overrides the defaultvalue of 10000.

           The tool prints a warning and continues if a variable cannot be set.

       --skew
           type: float; default: 0.5

           How long to delay checks.

           The default is to delay checks one half second.  Since the update happens as soon as  possible  after
           the  beginning  of  the second on the master, this allows one half second of replication delay before
           reporting that the slave lags the master by one second.  If your clocks are not  completely  accurate
           or  there  is some other reason you'd like to delay the slave more or less, you can tweak this value.
           Try setting the "PTDEBUG" environment variable to see the effect this has.

       --socket
           short form: -S; type: string

           Socket file to use for connection.

       --stop
           Stop running instances by creating the sentinel file.

           This should have the effect of stopping all running instances which are watching  the  same  sentinel
           file.   If  none of "--update", "--monitor" or "--check" is specified, "pt-heartbeat" will exit after
           creating the file.  If one of these is specified, "pt-heartbeat" will  wait  the  interval  given  by
           "--interval", then remove the file and continue working.

           You  might  find  this  handy  to  stop  cron jobs gracefully if necessary, or to replace one running
           instance with another.  For example, if you want to stop and restart "pt-heartbeat" every hour  (just
           to  make  sure that it is restarted every hour, in case of a server crash or some other problem), you
           could use a "crontab" line like this:

            0 * * * * pt-heartbeat --update -D test --stop \
              --sentinel /tmp/pt-heartbeat-hourly

           The non-default "--sentinel" will make sure the hourly "cron" job  stops  only  instances  previously
           started with the same options (that is, from the same "cron" job).

           See also "--sentinel".

       --table
           type: string; default: heartbeat

           The table to use for the heartbeat.

           Don't specify database.table; use "--database" to specify the database.

           See "--create-table".

       --update
           Update a master's heartbeat.

       --user
           short form: -u; type: string

           User for login if not current user.

       --utc
           Ignore  system  time  zones  and  use only UTC.  By default pt-heartbeat does not check or adjust for
           different system or MySQL time zones which can  cause  the  tool  to  compute  the  lag  incorrectly.
           Specifying  this option is a good idea because it ensures that the tool works correctly regardless of
           time zones.

           If used, this option must be used for all pt-heartbeat instances: "--update", "--monitor", "--check",
           etc.  You should probably set the option in a "--config" file.  Mixing this option with  pt-heartbeat
           instances  not  using  this option will cause false-positive lag readings due to different time zones
           (unless all your systems are set to use UTC, in which case this option isn't required).

       --version
           Show version and exit.

       --[no]version-check
           default: yes

           Check for the latest version of Percona Toolkit, MySQL, and other programs.

           This is a standard "check for updates automatically" feature, with two additional  features.   First,
           the  tool  checks  its own version and also the versions of the following software: operating system,
           Percona Monitoring and Management (PMM), MySQL, Perl, MySQL driver for Perl (DBD::mysql), and Percona
           Toolkit. Second, it checks for and warns about versions  with  known  problems.  For  example,  MySQL
           5.5.25 had a critical bug and was re-released as 5.5.25a.

           A  secure connection to Percona’s Version Check database server is done to perform these checks. Each
           request is logged by the server, including software version numbers and  unique  ID  of  the  checked
           system.  The  ID  is  generated  by the Percona Toolkit installation script or when the Version Check
           database call is done for the first time.

           Any updates or known problems are printed to STDOUT before the tool's normal  output.   This  feature
           should never interfere with the normal operation of the tool.

</pre><h4><b>DSN</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       These  DSN  options are used to create a DSN.  Each option is given like "option=value".  The options are
       case-sensitive, so P and p are not the same option.  There cannot be whitespace before or after  the  "="
       and  if  the  value  contains  whitespace  it  must be quoted.  DSN options are comma-separated.  See the
       percona-toolkit manpage for full details.

       •   A

           dsn: charset; copy: yes

           Default character set.

       •   D

           dsn: database; copy: yes

           Default database.

       •   F

           dsn: mysql_read_default_file; copy: yes

           Only read default options from the given file

       •   h

           dsn: host; copy: yes

           Connect to host.

       •   p

           dsn: password; copy: yes

           Password to use when connecting.  If password contains commas they must be escaped with a  backslash:
           "exam\,ple"

       •   P

           dsn: port; copy: yes

           Port number to use for connection.

       •   S

           dsn: mysql_socket; copy: yes

           Socket file to use for connection.

       •   u

           dsn: user; copy: yes

           User for login if not current user.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       The  environment  variable "PTDEBUG" enables verbose debugging output to STDERR.  To enable debugging and
       capture all output to a file, run the tool like:

          PTDEBUG=1 pt-heartbeat ... &gt; FILE 2&gt;&amp;1

       Be careful: debugging output is voluminous and can generate several megabytes of output.

</pre><h4><b>SYSTEM</b> <b>REQUIREMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       You need Perl, DBI, DBD::mysql, and some core packages that ought to be installed in any  reasonably  new
       version of Perl.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       For a list of known bugs, see &lt;<a href="http://www.percona.com/bugs/pt-heartbeat">http://www.percona.com/bugs/pt-heartbeat</a>&gt;.

       Please  report bugs at &lt;https://jira.percona.com/projects/PT&gt;.  Include the following information in your
       bug report:

       •   Complete command-line used to run the tool

       •   Tool "--version"

       •   MySQL version of all servers involved

       •   Output from the tool including STDERR

       •   Input files (log/dump/config files, etc.)

       If possible, include debugging output by running the tool with "PTDEBUG"; see "ENVIRONMENT".
