       <b>beep</b> &lt;<u>-v</u>|<u>-V</u>|<u>--version</u>&gt;

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>beep</b>  allows  the  user  to  control the PC speaker with precision, allowing different sounds to indicate
       different events.  While <b>beep</b> can be run quite happily on the command line, <b>beep</b>'s intended use is within
       shell/perl scripts, notifying the user when something interesting occurs.  Of course, it has no notion of
       what <u>IS</u> interesting, but it is good at the notifying part.

       All options have default values, meaning that just typing '<b>beep</b>' will work.  If an  option  is  specified
       more  than  once on the command line, subsequent options override their predecessors.  So '<b>beep</b> -f 200 -f
       300' will beep at 300Hz.

       All durations are given in a unit of milliseconds, frequencies as Hertz, and the number of repeats  is  a
       dimensionless number.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Global</b> <b>options</b>
       <b>-e</b> <b>DEVICE</b>, <b>--device=</b><u>DEVICE</u>
              Explicitly  set  the  device  <b>beep</b>  shall  use  to  generate  beep tones.  When not given a device
              explicitly, <b>beep</b> runs through an internal list of devices until one appears to work.

       <b>--debug</b>, <b>--verbose</b>
              Make the <b>beep</b> program more verbose.

   <b>Tone</b> <b>options</b>
       <b>-f</b> <u>FREQ</u>
              Beep with a tone frequency of <u>FREQ</u> Hz, where 0 &lt; <u>FREQ</u> &lt; 20000.  As a general ballpark, the regular
              terminal beep is around 750Hz.  For backwards compatibility, you can give <u>FREQ</u> as a floating point
              number, but <b>beep</b> will round that to integer values as the kernel APIs expect them.  Default value:
              440 Hz.

       <b>-l</b> <u>LEN</u> Beep for a tone length of <u>LEN</u> milliseconds. Default value: 200 ms.

       <b>-r</b> <u>REPEATS</u>
              Repeat the tone including delays <u>REPEATS</u> times. Default value: 1 tone, not repeated.

       <b>-d</b> <u>DELAY</u> | <b>-D</b> <u>DELAY</u>
              Specify a delay of <u>DELAY</u> milliseconds between repetitions.  Small letter <b>-d</b>  specifies  that  this
              delay  should  only  occur  <u>between</u> beeps, that is, it should <u>not</u> occur after the last repetition.
              Capital letter <b>-D</b> specifies that the delay should occur after every  repetition,  <u>including</u>  after
              the  last one.  Normally, <b>-d</b> is what you want, but if, for example, you are stringing several <b>beep</b>
              commands together to play the star wars anthem, you may want control  over  every  delay.  Default
              value: 100 ms delay between beeps with no delay after the last beep.

       <b>-n</b>, <b>--new</b>
              The  <b>--new</b> option allows you to chain multiple beeps together on a single command line.  Each time
              the <b>--new</b> <b>is</b> <b>used,</b> <b>beep</b> starts treating all further arguments as though they were for a new  beep.
              So for example:

                  <b>beep</b> -f 1000 -n -f 2000 -n -f 1500

              would  produce  a  sequence  of  three  beeps, the first with a frequency of 1000Hz (and otherwise
              default values), then a second beep with a frequency of 2000Hz (again, with things like delay  and
              reps  being  set  to  their  defaults),  then  a  third  beep,  at 1500Hz.  This is different from
              specifying a <b>-r</b> value, since <b>-r</b> repeats the same beep multiple times, whereas <b>--new</b> allows you  to
              specify  different beeps.  After a <b>--new</b>, the new beep is created with all the default values, and
              any of these can be specified without altering values for preceding (or  later)  beeps.   See  the
              <b>EXAMPLES</b> section if this managed to confuse you.

       <b>-s</b>, <b>-c</b> Both  the <b>-s</b> and the <b>-c</b> option put <b>beep</b> into input processing mode, reading from <u>stdin</u> and copying
              all received data to <u>stdout</u>.  This makes it easy to slip <b>beep</b> into a text processing  pipeline  to
              acoustically monitor the data flow within that pipeline.  See the <b>EXAMPLES</b> section.

              <b>-c</b>     Beep after every character received.

              <b>-s</b>     Beep  after  every  set of data received.  Usually, this means after newlines occur in text
                     processing pipes.

              In a sequence of notes specified with one or more occurrences of <b>-n</b> or <b>--new</b>, it only makes  sense
              to have one single note marked with either <b>-s</b> or <b>-c</b> attached to it.  Then <b>beep</b> will beep all notes
              until it reaches that marked note, then repeat the marked note according to the input it receives,
              and once the input has reached EOF, <b>beep</b> will continue with the remainder of the note sequence.

              The behaviour of <b>beep</b> with more than one note marked with <b>-s</b> or <b>-c</b> is undefined.

   <b>Other</b> <b>Actions</b>
       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b> Display <b>beep</b> usage info and exit.

       <b>-v</b>, <b>-V</b>, <b>--version</b>
              Display <b>beep</b> version information and exit.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       When successful, <b>beep</b> returns with exit code 0.

       Any non-0 exit code means <b>beep</b> has encountered an error and has bailed out.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>BEEP_LOG_LEVEL</b>
              When  set  to  a  number between -999 and 999, <b>BEEP_LOG_LEVEL</b> will be used as the default loglevel
              until overridden by a command line parameter.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       The device files <b>beep</b> uses by default are the following:
           /dev/input/by-path/platform-pcspkr-event-spkr
           /dev/tty0
           /dev/vc/0

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Devices</b> <b>and</b> <b>Permissions</b>
       When you run <b>beep</b> without explicitly giving a device to use, <b>beep</b> tries opening the following devices  in
       sequence until one succeeds:

       <b>/dev/input/by-path/platform-pcspkr-event-spkr</b>
           Uses  the  evdev  API, and system administrator can allow access to any set of users and groups using
           the normal file permissions.

       <b>/dev/tty0</b>
           Uses the console API, and the kernel insists you are root or own the TTY.

       <b>/dev/vc/0</b>
           Uses the console API, and the kernel insists you are root or own the TTY.

       <b>beep</b> does not support running as setuid root or via <b><a href="../man1/sudo.1.html">sudo</a></b>(1)<b>.</b>

       For non-root uses, the system administrator  can  set  up  a  <b><a href="../man7/udev.7.html">udev</a></b>(7)  rule  to  allow  write  access  to
       <b>/dev/input/by-path/platform-pcspkr-event-spkr</b>  for certain users and/or user groups. For details, see the
       <b>beep</b> <b>/usr/share/doc/beep/PERMISSIONS.md</b> file.

   <b>APIs</b>
       evdev
           Uses    the    input    event    device    driver,    which     means     running     <b><a href="../man2/write.2.html">write</a></b>(2)     on
           <b>/dev/input/by-path/platform-pcspkr-event-spkr</b>.

           The  permissions to this device file can be set up such that beep can be run by any non-root user the
           system administrator wants to.

           Opening this device takes on the order of magnitude of 20ms in the Linux kernel for  every  time  you
           start  the <b>beep</b> command. Therefore, if you need to play multiple notes in a rhythmical sequence for a
           melody, use one <b>beep</b> command invocation with multiple notes, not several <b>beep</b> invocations playing one
           note each.

       console
           Uses the ancient console API, which means running  the  <b>KIOCSOUND</b>  <b><a href="../man2/ioctl.2.html">ioctl</a></b>(2)  on  a  tty  device  like
           <b>/dev/tty0</b> or <b>/dev/vc/0.</b>

           This  requires being root, unless the non-root user happens be logged into the virtual console and be
           using that specific virtual console device like e.g. <b>/dev/tty4</b>. This makes the console driver useless
           for non-root users logged in via ssh, and often X11 or Wayland.

           Use the evdev API instead.

   <b>Concurrent</b> <b>Invocations</b>
       Concurrent invocations of <b>beep</b> are not supported. There is only one tone generator in  the  PC  hardware,
       and  we  do  not  manage  access to that shared resource in any way.  So if a first <b>beep</b> <b>-f</b> <b>1000</b> <b>-l</b> <b>10000</b>
       process starts a long 10 second beep with 1000Hz, and 2 seconds later a second quick <b>beep</b> <b>-f</b> <b>2050</b> <b>-l</b>  <b>100</b>
       with  2050Hz  comes  in,  you  will  hear  that 2050Hz beep for 100ms, and then silence as the quick beep
       silences the tone generator. Now you will not hear that the first <b>beep</b> process  is  still  running  after
       having  waited  for  the  first 2100ms of its 10000ms. You will also not hear that the first <b>beep</b> process
       will silence the already silent speaker 7900ms later, i.e. 10000ms after the first <b>beep</b> started.

   <b>Sound</b> <b>Volume</b>
       The PC speaker hardware has no way to explicitly set the volume of a beep.

       If you have a <u>standalone</u> <u>PC</u>, however, chances are you have a piezo beeper connected to the mainboard.  If
       you prioritize a loud beep over a certain frequency beep, you can choose to beep at a frequency close  to
       the  resonance  frequency  of  the piezo beeper.  Typical piezo beepers have a resonance frequency around
       2000Hz, so you can test frequencies around that range.  The author's piezo beeper is the loudest at about
       2050Hz.

       If you have a <u>PC</u> <u>laptop</u>, chances are that your laptop will not have a piezo beeper  hardware  inside  and
       that  it will route the output of the pcspkr circuit to the laptop's internal speakers via the sound card
       mixer.  In that case, you can and/or must change the mixer level for the beeper using a sound card  mixer
       application.

   <b>Frequency</b> <b>Table</b>
       This  frequency  table might come in handy for translating musical notes to frequencies.  The frequencies
       are rounded to integer numbers as the kernel driver only works with integers.  The column for <b>octave</b> <b>4</b> is
       the octave of middle C.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       At its simplest (yet still effective)

           <b>beep</b>

       A more interesting standalone setup

           <b>beep</b> -f 300.7 -r 2 -d 100 -l 400

       As part of a log watching pipeline

           tail -f /var/log/xferlog | grep 'passwd' | <b>beep</b> -f 1000 -r 5 -s

       When using -c mode, I recommend using a short -D, and a shorter  -l,  so  that  the  beeps  do  not  blur
       together.  Something like this will get you a cheesy 1970's style beep-as-you-type-each-letter effect

           cat file | <b>beep</b> -c -f 400 -D 50 -l 10

       A highly contrived example of -n/--new usage

           <b>beep</b> -f 1000 -r 2 -n -r 5 -l 10 --new

       will  produce first two 1000Hz beeps, then 5 beeps at the default tone, but only 10ms long each, followed
       by a third beep using all the default settings (since none are specified).
