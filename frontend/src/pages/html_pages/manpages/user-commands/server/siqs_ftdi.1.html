       siqs_ftdi - Sdr IQ Server

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This  program attempt to mimic the sdrxx server created by Moe WHEATLEY in order to provide SDR-IQ with a
       network interface compatible with that of more sophisticated radio from RFSPACE.

       Alas the sdrxx server source code resulted  unfeasible  to  port  to  Linux,  but  was  invaluable  as  a
       reference.

       A  special  mention  deservers  Ken N9VV that put his radio, Linux computer and Internet connection to my
       disposal in order to develop and test this software.

       The application is compatible with the SDR-IP and NetSDR networked software defined radio receivers  made
       by RFSPACE, Inc. of Atlanta, GA

       Running  with  other  receivers  that  have  USB  interfaces (such as the SDR-IQ) is made possible by the
       siqs_ftdi program.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>siqs_ftdi</b>

       In order to run CuteSDR you have to remove from your system the standard Linux kernel FTDI  driver;  this
       is feasible at run time:

       sudo rmmod usbserial ftdi_sio

       Next check that the radio is correctly linked to the system:

       lsusb

       Bus 006 Device 002: ID 0403:6001 Future Technology Devices International, Ltd FT232 USB-Serial (UART) IC

       If everything is fine, open a terminal window and start the server:

       siqs_ftdi ------

       ------ SDR-IQ server for Cute SDR

       ------

       ------ libftdi version

       ------

       ------ (C) 2012, Ken N9VV &amp;&amp; Andrea IW0HDV

       interfaces = 2:

       lo - 127.0.0.1

       eth0 - 192.168.10.1

       SRXXX STARTED: size 56

       Press q &lt;ENTER&gt; to exit.

       Listening for TCP connections on port 50000 socket: 6

       Last,  run  CuteSDR  from another terminal window, and into the menu Setup-&gt;Network press "Find SDR" push
       button or manually insert the network data.  The auto discovery proceudre works only if the  CuteSDR  and
       the server are placed on the same LAN (broadcast domain).

       Please  not  that  the  server is not yet completed with all the features: e.g. the discovery messages is
       only partially supported.
