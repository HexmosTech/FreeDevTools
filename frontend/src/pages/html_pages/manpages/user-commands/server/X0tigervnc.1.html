</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       X0tigervnc - TigerVNC Server for X displays

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>X0tigervnc</b> [<u>options</u>]
       <b>X0tigervnc</b> <b>-version</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>X0tigervnc</b>  is  a  TigerVNC  Server  which  makes  any X display remotely accessible via VNC, TigerVNC or
       compatible viewers.  Unlike <b><a href="../man1/Xtigervnc.1.html">Xtigervnc</a></b>(1), it does not create a virtual display.  Instead, it just  shares
       an existing X server (typically, that one connected to the physical screen).

       XDamage will be used if the existing X server supports it. Otherwise <b>X0tigervnc</b> will fall back to polling
       the screen for changes.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>X0tigervnc</b>  interprets the command line as a list of parameters with optional values.  Running <b>X0tigervnc</b>
       <b>-h</b> will show a list of all valid parameters with short descriptions.  All parameters  are  optional,  but
       normally you would have to use the <b>PasswordFile</b> parameter (see its description below).

       There  are  several forms of specifying parameters in the command line (here we use `<u>SomeParameter</u>' as an
       example parameter name):

       <b>-</b><u>SomeParameter</u>
              Enable the parameter, turn the feature on.  This form can be  used  with  parameters  that  simply
              enable or disable some feature.

       <b>-</b><u>SomeParameter</u><b>=0</b>
              Disable the parameter, turn the feature off.

       <b>-</b><u>SomeParameter</u><b>=</b><u>value</u>
              Assign  the  specified  <u>value</u>  to  the  parameter.   The leading dash can be omitted, or it can be
              doubled if desired (like in GNU-style long options).

       Parameter names are case-insensitive, their order in the command line can be arbitrary.

</pre><h4><b>PARAMETERS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-desktop</b> <u>desktop-name</u>
              Each desktop has a name which may be displayed by the viewer. It defaults to "&lt;user&gt;@&lt;hostname&gt;".

       <b>-display</b> <u>display</u>
              The X display name.  If not specified, it  defaults  to  the  value  of  the  DISPLAY  environment
              variable.

       <b>-rfbport</b> <u>port</u>
              Specifies the TCP port on which X0tigervnc listens for connections from viewers (the protocol used
              in  VNC is called RFB - "remote framebuffer").  Specify <b>-1</b> to disable listening on a TCP port. The
              default port is 5900 when started directly, and -1 when activated by a systemd socket.

       <b>-UseIPv4</b>
              Use IPv4 for incoming and outgoing connections. Default is on.

       <b>-UseIPv6</b>
              Use IPv6 for incoming and outgoing connections. Default is on.

       <b>-rfbunixpath</b> <u>path</u>
              Specifies the path of a Unix domain socket  on  which  X0tigervnc  listens  for  connections  from
              viewers. Default is to not listen to any Unix domain socket.

       <b>-rfbunixmode</b> <u>mode</u>
              Specifies the mode of the Unix domain socket.  The default is 0600.

       <b>-Log</b> <u>logname</u><b>:</b><u>dest</u><b>:</b><u>level</u>
              Configures  the  debug log settings.  <u>dest</u> can currently be <b>stderr</b>, <b>stdout</b> or <b>syslog</b>, and <u>level</u> is
              between 0 and 100, 100 meaning most verbose output.  <u>logname</u> is usually <b>*</b> meaning all, but you can
              target a specific source file if you know the name of its "LogWriter".  Default is <b>*:stderr:30</b>.

       <b>-HostsFile</b> <u>filename</u>
              This parameter allows to specify a file name with  IP  access  control  rules.   The  file  should
              include  one  rule  per line, and the rule format is one of the following: +<u>address</u>/<u>prefix</u> (accept
              connections  from  the  specified  address  group),  -<u>address</u>/<u>prefix</u>   (reject   connections)   or
              ?<u>address</u>/<u>prefix</u>  (query  the  local  user).  The first rule matching the IP address determines the
              action to be performed.  Rules that include only an action sign (+, - or  ?)  will  match  any  IP
              address.   <u>Prefix</u>  is  optional  and  is  specified as a number of bits (e.g. /24).  Default is to
              accept connections from any IP address.

       <b>-SecurityTypes</b> <u>sec-types</u>
              Specify which security scheme to use for incoming connections.  Valid values are a comma separated
              list of <b>None</b>, <b>VncAuth</b>, <b>Plain</b>, <b>TLSNone</b>, <b>TLSVnc</b>, <b>TLSPlain</b>, <b>X509None</b>, <b>X509Vnc</b>, <b>X509Plain</b>, <b>RA2</b>, <b>RA2ne</b>,
              <b>RA2_256</b> and <b>RA2ne_256</b>.  Default is <b>TLSVnc,VncAuth</b>.

       <b>-rfbauth</b> <u>passwd-file</u><b>,</b> <b>-PasswordFile</b> <u>passwd-file</u>
              Password file for VNC authentication.  There is no default, you should specify the  password  file
              explicitly.   Password  file  should  be  created with the <b><a href="../man1/tigervncpasswd.1.html">tigervncpasswd</a></b>(1) utility.  The file is
              accessed each time a connection comes in, so it can be changed on the fly.

       <b>-Password</b> <u>password</u>
              Obfuscated binary encoding of the password which clients must supply to access the server.   Using
              this parameter is insecure, use <b>PasswordFile</b> parameter instead.

       <b>-PlainUsers</b> <u>user-list</u>
              A  comma  separated  list  of  user  names that are allowed to authenticate via any of the "Plain"
              security types (Plain, TLSPlain, etc.). Specify <b>*</b> to allow any user  to  authenticate  using  this
              security type. Specify <b>%u</b> to allow the user of the server process. Default is to deny all users.

       <b>-pam_service</b> <u>name</u><b>,</b> <b>-PAMService</b> <u>name</u>
              PAM service name to use when authentication users using any of the "Plain" security types. Default
              is <b>vnc</b>.

       <b>-X509Cert</b> <u>path</u>
              Path  to  a X509 certificate in PEM format to be used for all X509 based security types (X509None,
              X509Vnc, etc.).

       <b>-X509Key</b> <u>path</u>
              Private key counter part to the certificate given in <b>X509Cert</b>. Must also be in PEM format.

       <b>-GnuTLSPriority</b> <u>priority</u>
              GnuTLS priority string that controls the TLS  sessionâ€™s  handshake  algorithms.   See  the  GnuTLS
              manual for possible values. Default is <b>NORMAL</b>.

       <b>-RSAKey</b> <u>path</u>
              Path  to  the  RSA  key  for the RSA-AES security types (<b>RA2</b>, <b>RA2ne</b>, <b>RA2_256</b> and <b>RA2ne_256</b>) in PEM
              format.

       <b>-RequireUsername</b>
              Require username for the RSA-AES security types. Default is off.

       <b>-UseBlacklist</b>
              Temporarily reject connections from a host if it repeatedly fails to authenticate. Default is on.

       <b>-BlacklistThreshold</b> <u>count</u>
              The number of unauthenticated connection attempts allowed from any  individual  host  before  that
              host is black-listed.  Default is 5.

       <b>-BlacklistTimeout</b> <u>seconds</u>
              The  initial  timeout  applied  when  a  host is first black-listed.  The host cannot re-attempt a
              connection until the timeout expires.  Default is 10.

       <b>-QueryConnect</b>
              Prompts the user of the desktop to explicitly accept or reject incoming  connections.  Default  is
              off.

       <b>-QueryConnectTimeout</b> <u>seconds</u>
              Number  of  seconds to show the Accept Connection dialog before rejecting the connection.  Default
              is <b>10</b>.

       <b>-localhost</b>
              Only allow connections from the same machine. Useful if you use  SSH  and  want  to  stop  non-SSH
              connections from any other hosts.

       <b>-interface</b> <u>IP</u> <u>address</u>
              Listen on interface. By default X0tigervnc listens on all available interfaces.

       <b>-AlwaysShared</b>
              Always  treat  incoming connections as shared, regardless of the client-specified setting. Default
              is off.

       <b>-NeverShared</b>
              Never treat incoming connections as shared, regardless of the client-specified setting. Default is
              off.

       <b>-DisconnectClients</b>
              Disconnect  existing  clients  if  an  incoming  connection  is  non-shared.  Default  is  on.  If
              <b>DisconnectClients</b>  is  false,  then  a  new non-shared connection will be refused while there is a
              client active.  When combined with <b>NeverShared</b> this means only one client is allowed at a time.

       <b>-AcceptKeyEvents</b>
              Accept key press and release events from clients. Default is on.

       <b>-AcceptPointerEvents</b>
              Accept pointer movement and button events from clients. Default is on.

       <b>-AcceptSetDesktopSize</b>
              Accept requests to resize the size of the desktop. Default is on.

       <b>-RemapKeys</b> <u>mapping</u>
              Sets up a keyboard mapping.  <u>mapping</u> is a comma-separated string of character  mappings,  each  of
              the  form  <u>char</u>-&gt;<u>char</u>, or <u>char</u>&lt;&gt;<u>char</u>, where <u>char</u> is a hexadecimal keysym. For example, to exchange
              the " and @ symbols you would specify the following:

                 RemapKeys=0x22&lt;&gt;0x40

       <b>-RawKeyboard</b>
              Send keyboard events straight through and avoid mapping them to the current keyboard layout.  This
              effectively  makes the keyboard behave according to the layout configured on the server instead of
              the layout configured on the client. Default is off.

       <b>-Protocol3.3</b>
              Always use protocol version 3.3 for backwards compatibility with badly-behaved clients. Default is
              off.

       <b>-Geometry</b> <u>geometry</u>
              This option specifies the screen  area  that  will  be  shown  to  VNC  clients.   The  format  is
              <u>width</u><b>x</b><u>height</u><b>+</b><u>xoffset</u><b>+</b><u>yoffset</u>  ,  where `+' signs can be replaced with `-' signs to specify offsets
              from the right and/or from the bottom of the screen.  Offsets are optional,  +0+0  is  assumed  by
              default (top left corner).  If the argument is empty, full screen is shown to VNC clients (this is
              the default).

       <b>-MaxProcessorUsage</b> <u>percent</u>
              Maximum percentage of CPU time to be consumed when polling the screen.  Default is 35.

       <b>-PollingCycle</b> <u>milliseconds</u>
              Milliseconds  per  one  polling  cycle.   Actual  interval  may be dynamically adjusted to satisfy
              <b>MaxProcessorUsage</b> setting.  Default is 30.

       <b>-FrameRate</b> <u>fps</u>
              The maximum number of updates per second sent to each client. If the  screen  updates  any  faster
              then  those  changes  will be aggregated and sent in a single update to the client. Note that this
              only controls the maximum rate and a client may get a  lower  rate  when  resources  are  limited.
              Default is <b>60</b>.

       <b>-CompareFB</b> <u>mode</u>
              Perform  pixel  comparison  on framebuffer to reduce unnecessary updates. Can be either <b>0</b> (off), <b>1</b>
              (always) or <b>2</b> (auto). Default is <b>2</b>.

       <b>-UseSHM</b>
              Use MIT-SHM extension if available.  Using that extension accelerates reading the screen.  Default
              is on.

       <b>-ImprovedHextile</b>
              Use improved compression algorithm for Hextile encoding which achieves better  compression  ratios
              by the cost of using slightly more CPU time.  Default is on.

       <b>-IdleTimeout</b> <u>seconds</u>
              The  number  of  seconds  after which an idle VNC connection will be dropped.  Default is 0, which
              means that idle connections will never be dropped.

       <b>-MaxDisconnectionTime</b> <u>seconds</u>
              Terminate when no client has been connected for <u>N</u> seconds.  Default is 0.

       <b>-MaxConnectionTime</b> <u>seconds</u>
              Terminate when a client has been connected for <u>N</u> seconds.  Default is 0.

       <b>-MaxIdleTime</b> <u>seconds</u>
              Terminate after <u>N</u> seconds of user inactivity.  Default is 0.

       VNC was originally developed by the RealVNC team while at  Olivetti  Research  Ltd  /  AT&amp;T  Laboratories
       Cambridge.   TightVNC  additions  were  implemented by Constantin Kaplinsky. Many other people have since
       participated in development, testing and support. This manual is part of the TigerVNC software suite.
