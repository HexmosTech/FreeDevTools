</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       mergelogs - merge and consolidate web server logs

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>mergelogs</b> -p penlog [-c] [-d] [-j jitter] [-t seconds] server1:logfile1 [server2:logfile2 ...]

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       mergelogs -p pen.log 10.0.0.1:access_log.1 10.0.0.2:access_log.2

       mergelogs -p pen.log 10.0.18.6:access_log-10.0.18.6 10.0.18.8:access_log-10.0.18.8

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       When  pen  is used to load balance web servers, the web server log file lists all accesses as coming from
       the host running pen. This makes it more difficult to analyze the log file.

       To solve this, pen creates its own log file, which contains the real client  address,  the  time  of  the
       access, the target server address and the first few bytes of the requests.

       Mergelogs  reads  pen's  log file and the log files of all load balanced web servers, compares each entry
       and creates a combined log file that looks as if the web server cluster were a  single  physical  server.
       Client addresses are replaced with the real client addresses.

       In  the  event  that  no  matching client address can be found in the pen log, the server address is used
       instead. This should never happen, and is meant as a debugging tool. A large number  of  these  indicates
       that the server system date needs to be set, or that the jitter value is too small.

       You probably don't want to use this program. Penlog is a much more elegant and functional solution.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       -c     Do not cache pen log entries. The use of this option is not recommended, as it will make mergelogs
              search the entire pen log for every line in the web server logs.

       -d     Debugging (repeat for more).

       -p <u>penlog</u>
              Log file from pen.

       -j <u>jitter</u>
              Jitter  in  seconds (default 600). This is the maximum variation in time stamps in the pen and web
              server log files. A smaller value will result in a smaller pen log cache and faster processing, at
              the risk of missed entries.

       -t <u>seconds</u>
              The difference in seconds between the time on the pen server and UTC.  For example, this  is  7200
              (two hours) in Finland.

       server:logfile
              Web server address and name of log file.
