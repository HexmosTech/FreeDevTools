</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       gbrowse_clean.pl - Clean up sessions and other temporary gbrowse2 files

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       From the command line:

        sudo -u www-data gbrowse_clean.pl

       Replace "www-data" with the web server account name on your system.

       To run automatically under cron, create a crontab file for the web server user that contains a line like
       the following:

        # m h  dom mon dow   command
        5 0  *  *  /usr/bin/gbrowse_clean.pl &gt;&gt;/var/log/gbrowse2/gbrowse_clean.log

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-verbose</b>
           Report actions verbosely, printing out each session, file and directory deleted.

       <b>-help</b>
           Print a brief help message and exits.

       <b>-man</b>
           Prints the manual page and exits.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       GBrowse2  generates  a number of temporary files during its operations. These files include session data,
       data cache files, and temporary image files, as well as user upload data from custom tracks.

       This script expires these temporary files, releasing unneeded space.  The  script  honors  the  following
       options from the GBrowse.conf master configuration file:

        Name                   Default Description
        ----                   ------- -----------
        exire session          1M      How long to keep session data
        expire cache           2h      How long to keep cache data
        expire uploads         6w      How long to keep user track data

       Time intervals are indicated using a count and a unit:

        Suffix     Time Unit
        ------     ---------
         s         seconds
         m         minutes
         h         hours
         d         days
         w         weeks
         M         months
         y         years

       <b>expire</b>  <b>session</b>  controls  how  long before user session data expires. Once a session expires, the user's
       saved settings, such as his preferred data source, track visibility settings, and  custom  track  uploads
       are  purged.  The  expiration  interval is measured since the last time the user <u>accessed</u> his session, so
       simply loading a region in the browser without changing settings is sufficient to prevent a session  from
       expiring.

       <b>expire</b>  <b>cache</b>  controls  how long before cached track data is purged from the system. Caching for up to a
       few hours increases performance because users frequently reload  the  same  region.  Caching  for  longer
       periods increases the time between updating the database and tracks displaying those changes.

       <b>expire</b>  <b>uploads</b> controls how long to keep user uploaded data for custom tracks on disk. It makes sense to
       keep it on disk for as long or longer than the session. Even if the user's session expires, he can  still
       get at the uploaded data if he bookmarked his session or shared the uploaded track at any point.

       This  script  should  be  run  periodically, ideally under cron. Once per day should be adequate for most
       uses, but heavily-used sites may wish to run the script more frequently.  It  is  important  to  run  the
       script  under  the same user account as the web server; otherwise the script will be unable to delete the
       files created by the web server user during gbrowse execution. <b>Do</b> <b>not</b> <b>run</b> <b>this</b> <b>script</b> <b>as</b> <b>root.</b>
