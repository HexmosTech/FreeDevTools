</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       make_method - Turn Perl code into an XML description for RPC::XML::Server

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           make_method --name=system.identification --helptext='System ID string'
               --signature=string --code=ident.pl --output=ident.xpl

           make_method --base=methods/identification

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This is a simple tool to create the XML descriptive files for specifying methods to be published by an
       <b>RPC::XML::Server</b>-based server.

       If a server is written such that the methods it exports (or <u>publishes</u>) are a part of the running code,
       then there is no need for this tool. However, in cases where the server may be separate and distinct from
       the code (such as an Apache-based RPC server), specifying the routines and filling in the supporting
       information can be cumbersome.

       One solution that the <b>RPC::XML::Server</b> package offers is the means to load publishable code from an
       external file. The file is in a simple XML dialect that clearly delinates the externally-visible name,
       the method signatures, the help text and the code itself. These files may be created manually, or this
       tool may be used as an aide.

</pre><h4><b>REQUIRED</b> <b>ARGUMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       There are no required arguments, but if there are not sufficient options passed you will be told by an
       error message.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The tool recognizes the following options:

       --help
           Prints a short summary of the options.

       --name=STRING
           Specifies  the  published  name  of  the  method  being encoded. This is the name by which it will be
           visible to clients of the server.

       --namespace=STRING
           Specifies a namespace that the code of the method will be evaluated in, when the XPL file  is  loaded
           by a server instance.

       --type=STRING
           Specify  the type for the resulting file. "Type" here refers to whether the container tag used in the
           resulting XML will specify a <b>procedure</b> or a <b>method</b>. The default is  <b>method</b>.  The  string  is  treated
           case-independant, and only the first character ("m" or "p") is actually regarded.

       --version=STRING
           Specify a version stamp for the code routine.

       --hidden
           If  this is passe, the resulting file will include a tag that tells the server daemon to not make the
           routine visible through any introspection interfaces.

       --signature=STRING [ --signature=STRING ... ]
           Specify one or more signatures for the method. Signatures should be the type names as laid out in the
           documentation in RPC::XML, with the elements separated by a colon. You may also  separate  them  with
           spaces,  if  you quote the argument. This option may be specified more than once, as some methods may
           have several signatures.

       --helptext=STRING
           Specify the help text for the method as a simple string on the command line.  Not suited for terribly
           long help strings.

       --helpfile=FILE
           Read the help text for the method from the file specified.

       --code=FILE
           Read the actual code for the routine from the file specified. If this option is not given,  the  code
           is read from the standard input file descriptor.

       --output=FILE
           Write  the  resulting XML representation to the specified file. If this option is not given, then the
           output goes to the standard output file descriptor.

       --base=NAME
           This is a special, "all-in-one" option. If passed, all other options are ignored.

           The value is used as the base element for reading information from a file named <b>BASE</b>.base. This  file
           will  contain  specification  of  the  name,  version,  hidden  status,  signatures  and other method
           information. Each line of the file should look like one of the following:

           <b>Name:</b> <u><b>STRING</b></u>
               Specify the name of the routine being published. If this line does not appear, then the value  of
               the <b>--base</b> argument with all directory elements removed will be used.

           <b>Version:</b> <u><b>STRING</b></u>
               Provide a version stamp for the function. If no line matching this pattern is present, no version
               tag will be written.

           <b>Hidden:</b> <u><b>STRING</b></u>
               If present, <u>STRING</u> should be either "yes" or "no" (case not important).  If it is "yes", then the
               method is marked to be hidden from any introspection API.

           <b>Signature:</b> <u><b>STRING</b></u>
               This line may appear more than once, and is treated cumulatively. Other options override previous
               values  if they appear more than once. The portion following the "Signature:" part is taken to be
               a published signature for the method, with elements separated by  whitespace.  Each  method  must
               have at least one signature, so a lack of any will cause an error.

           <b>Helpfile:</b> <u><b>STRING</b></u>
               Specifies  the  file  from  which  to  read  the help text. It is not an error if no help text is
               specified.

           <b>Codefile:</b> <u><b>STRING</b></u>
               Specifies the file from which to read the code. Code is assumed to be Perl, and will be tagged as
               such in the resulting file.

           <b>Codefile[lang]:</b> <u><b>string</b></u>
               Specifies the file from which to read code, while also identifying the language that the code  is
               in. This allows for the creation of a <b>XPL</b> file that includes multiple language implementations of
               the given method or procedure.

           Any other lines than the above patterns are ignored.

           If no code has been read, then the tool will exit with an error message.

           The  output  is  written  to  <b>BASE</b>.xpl, preserving the path information so that the resulting file is
           right alongside the source files. This allows constructs such as:

               make_method --base=methods/introspection

</pre><h4><b>FILE</b> <b>FORMAT</b> <b>AND</b> <b>DTD</b></h4><pre>
       The file format for these published routines is a very simple XML dialect.  This is less due to XML being
       an ideal format than it is the availability of the parser, given that  the  <b>RPC::XML::Server</b>  class  will
       already have the parser code in core. Writing a completely new format would not have gained anything.

       The Document Type Declaration for the format can be summarized by:

           &lt;!ELEMENT  proceduredef (name, namespace?, version?, hidden?,
                                    signature+, help?, code)&gt;
           &lt;!ELEMENT  methoddef  (name, namespace?, version?, hidden?,
                                  signature+, help?, code)&gt;
           &lt;!ELEMENT  functiondef (name, namespace?, version?, hidden?,
                                   signature+, help?, code)&gt;
           &lt;!ELEMENT  name       (#PCDATA)&gt;
           &lt;!ELEMENT  namespace  (#PCDATA)&gt;
           &lt;!ELEMENT  version    (#PCDATA)&gt;
           &lt;!ELEMENT  hidden     EMPTY&gt;
           &lt;!ELEMENT  signature  (#PCDATA)&gt;
           &lt;!ELEMENT  help       (#PCDATA)&gt;
           &lt;!ELEMENT  code       (#PCDATA)&gt;
           &lt;!ATTLIST  code       language (#PCDATA)&gt;

       The  file "rpc-method.dtd" that comes with the distribution has some commentary in addition to the actual
       specification.

       A file is (for now) limited to  one  definition.  This  is  started  by  the  one  of  the  opening  tags
       "&lt;methoddef&gt;",  "&lt;functiondef&gt;"  or  "&lt;proceduredef&gt;". This is followed by exactly one "&lt;name&gt;" container
       specifying the method name, an optional version stamp, an optional hide-from-introspection flag,  one  or
       more  "&lt;signature&gt;"  containers specifying signatures, an optional "&lt;help&gt;" container with the help text,
       then the "&lt;code&gt;" container with the actual program code. All text should use  entity  encoding  for  the
       symbols:

           &amp; C&lt;&amp;amp;&gt; (ampersand)
           E&lt;lt&gt; C&lt;&amp;lt;&gt;  (less-than)
           E&lt;gt&gt; C&lt;&amp;gt;&gt;  (greater-than)

       The  parsing  process  within  the server class will decode the entities. To make things easier, the tool
       scans all text elements and encodes the above entities before writing the file.

   <b>The</b> <b>Specification</b> <b>of</b> <b>Code</b>
       This is not <u>"Programming</u> <u>101"</u>, nor is it <u>"Perl</u> <u>for</u> <u>the</u> <u>Somewhat</u> <u>Dim"</u>.  The code that is passed in via one
       of the "*.xpl" files gets passed to "eval" with next to no modification (see below). Thus,  badly-written
       or malicious code can very well wreak havoc on your server. This is not the fault of the server code. The
       price  of the flexibility this system offers is the responsibility on the part of the developer to ensure
       that the code is tested and safe.

       Code itself is treated as verbatim as possible. Some edits may occur on the server-side, as it  make  the
       code  suitable  for  creating  an  anonymous  subroutine from. The <b>make_method</b> tool will attempt to use a
       "CDATA" section to embed the code within the XML document, so that there is no need to encode entities or
       such. This allows for the resulting <u>*.xpl</u> files to be syntax-testable with "perl -cx". You can  aid  this
       by ensuring that the code does not contain either of the two following character sequences:

           ]]&gt;

           __DATA__

       The  first  is  the  "CDATA" terminator. If it occurs naturally in the code, it would trigger the end-of-
       section in the parser. The second is the familiar Perl token, which is inserted so that the remainder  of
       the XML document does not clutter up the Perl parser.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>RPC::XML</b>  distribution  comes with a number of default methods in a subdirectory called (cryptically
       enough) "methods". Each of these is expressed as a set  of  ("*.base",  "*.code",  "*.help")  files.  The
       Makefile.PL file configures the resulting Makefile such that these are used to create "*.xpl" files using
       this tool, and then install them.

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       Most problems come out in the form of error messages followed by an abrupt exit.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       The tool exits with a status of 0 upon success, and 255 otherwise.

</pre><h4><b>CAVEATS</b></h4><pre>
       I don't much like this approach to specifying the methods, but I liked my other ideas even less.
