</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       wdel - A wget-like program for deleting files on ftp servers

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       wdel [<u>option</u>]... [<u>URL</u> [<u>file</u>]...]...

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Wdel is a free utility that is able to delete files on an ftp server.

       Wdel  is non-interactive and background-capable. It can delete files or whole directories and is meant to
       be a robust client even for unstable connections and will therefore  retry  to  delete  a  file,  if  the
       connection broke.

       Wdel  supports  connections through proxies, allowing you to use it in an environment that can access the
       internet only via a proxy or to  provide  anonymity  by  hiding  your  ip-address  to  the  server.   For
       SOCKSv5-proxies  Wdel  supports  also  listening  mode, allowing you to use port-mode ftp through a proxy
       (useful if the remote ftp is behind a firewall or a gateway).

</pre><h4><b>URL-Input-Handling</b></h4><pre>
       URLs are recognized by the <a href="ftp://-prefix">ftp://-prefix</a>.

       Wdel first reads the URLs from the command line, and associates every file with the last URL until a  new
       URL is found (note that this is different from wput). Then, it reads the --input-file (if any) and parses
       the URLs in the same way.  So you can specify e.g. one URL and read all filenames from a file.

       If  there  are  no explicit filenames given for a singe URL, then the last part of the URL is taken to be
       the file/directory to be deleted. If there are filenames, then the last part of the URL is considered  to
       be  the  directory where these files reside in. Slashes at the end of the URL or the filename (in case it
       is a directory to be deleted) are ignored.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       There are no special options introduced by Wdel. All of Wputâ€™s options may  be  supplied,  although  some
       will not be of any effect because they do not apply for the process of deleting files. Please see <a href="../man1/wput.1.html">wput</a>(1)
       for a description of the options.

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       Many options can be set in a wputrc file. For its documentation consult the sample file provided by Wput.

       <a href="../man1/wput.1.html">wput</a>(1) describes all setable options. Not all apply for wdel too though.
