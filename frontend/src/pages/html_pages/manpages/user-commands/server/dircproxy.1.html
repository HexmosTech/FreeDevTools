</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       <b>dircproxy</b> - Detachable Internal Relay Chat Proxy Server

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>dircproxy</b> [<b>-hvDI</b>] [<b>-f</b> <u>config_file</u>] [<b>-P</b> <u>listen_port</u>] [<b>-p</b> <u>pid_file</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>dircproxy</b>  is  an IRC proxy server designed for people who use IRC from lots of different workstations or
       clients, but wish to remain connected and see what they missed while they were away.

       You connect to IRC through <b>dircproxy</b>, and it keeps you connected to the server,  even  after  you  detach
       your  client  from  it.  While you're detached, it logs channel and private messages as well as important
       events, and when you re-attach it'll let you know what you missed.

       This can be used to give you roughly the same functionality as using ircII and <b><a href="../man8/screen.8.html">screen</a></b>(8) together, except
       you can use whatever IRC client you like, including X ones!

       Authentication is provided by a password, and optional hostname checking.  This links it to a  <u>connection</u>
       <u>class</u>  specified  in  the configuration file.  Only one user may use a connection class at one time, when
       that user detaches, the connection to  the  server  is  kept  open.   When  someone  (usually  the  user)
       subsequently connects to <b>dircproxy</b> and provides the same password, they are reconnected to the connection
       to the server, instead of having a new connection created for them.

       Multiple connection classes can be defined, allowing multiple people to use the same proxy.

       <b>dircproxy</b>  can  use either a <u>.dircproxyrc</u> file in the user's home directory, or a system-wide <u>dircproxyrc</u>
       file.  It will load the first it finds (home directory first, then  system-wide).   If  no  configuration
       file is specified, it will not start.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-f</b> <u>config_file</u>
              Specifies the configuration file to be used, overriding the default search list.

       <b>-h</b>     Displays a brief help message detailing the command-line arguments, then exits.

       <b>-v</b>     Displays the <b>dircproxy</b> version number, then exits.

       <b>-D</b>     Run in the foreground and do not fork into the background.

       <b>-I</b>     Use  to  indicate  <b>dircproxy</b>  is  being  run from the <b><a href="../man8/inetd.8.html">inetd</a></b>(8) daemon.  This implies <b>-D</b>.  For more
              information on running <b>dircproxy</b> under <b><a href="../man8/inetd.8.html">inetd</a></b>(8), see the <u>README.inetd</u> file.

       <b>-P</b> <u>listen_port</u>
              Specifies an alternate port to use,  overriding  the  default  and  any  value  specified  in  the
              configuration file.

       <b>-p</b> <u>pid_file</u>
              Specifies a file to write the process id to, overriding the default and any value specified in the
              configuration file.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       The configuration file has the following format:

       Empty lines and lines starting with '#' are comments.

       Connection  classes  start with 'connection {' and end with '}'.  They obtain default values from all the
       entries above them in the configuration file, and may contain values of their own.

       Otherwise a line is of the format 'keywords arguments'.  If the argument contains  spaces  it  should  be
       contained  in  double  quotes ('"with spaces"').  The possible keywords and their meanings are as follows
       (note that the configuration file is not case-sensitive):

       <b>LOCAL</b> <b>OPTIONS</b>

       These options may not be placed inside a connection class as they affect  the  operation  of  the  entire
       <b>dircproxy</b> server.

       <b>listen_port</b>
              What port should <b>dircproxy</b> listen for connections from IRC clients on?

              This can be a numeric port number, or a service name from <a href="file:/etc/services">/etc/services</a>

       <b>pid_file</b>
              File  to  write  the  <b>dircproxy</b>  process  id to on startup.  If you start this with a "~/" then it
              refers to a file in a directory under your home directory.

               none = Don't write pid file

       <b>client_timeout</b>
              Maxmimum amount of time (in seconds) a client can take to connect to <b>dircproxy</b> and  provide  their
              password and nickname etc.

       <b>connect_timeout</b>
              Maximum  amount  of time (in seconds) a client has to provide a server to connect to after they've
              logged in.  This only applies if '<b>server_autoconnect</b>' is 'no' for that class.

       <b>dns_timeout</b>
              Maximum amount of time (in seconds) to wait for a reply from a DNS server.  If  the  time  exceeds
              this then the lookup is cancelled.

       <b>GLOBAL</b> <b>OPTIONS</b>

       These options may be placed in a connection class, or outside of one.  If they are outside then they only
       affect those connection classes defined afterwards.

       <b>server_port</b>
              What port do we connect to IRC servers on if the server string doesn't explicitly set one

              This can be a numeric port number, or a service name from <a href="file:/etc/services">/etc/services</a>

       <b>server_retry</b>
              How many seconds after disconnection or last connection attempt do we wait before retrying again?

       <b>server_maxattempts</b>
              If  we  are  disconnected from the server, how many times should we iterate the server list before
              giving up and declaring the proxied connection dead?

              0 = iterate forever

       <b>server_maxinitattempts</b>
              On first connection, how many times should we  iterate  the  server  list  before  giving  up  and
              declaring the proxied connection dead?

               0 = iterate forever.  This isn't recommended.

       <b>server_keepalive</b>
              This  checks  whether the <b>dircproxy</b> to server connection is alive at the TCP level.  If no data is
              sent in either direction for a period of time, a TCP keepalive probe is sent.

               yes = send keepalive probes
               no = don't send keepalive probes

       <b>server_pingtimeout</b>
              For some people, <b>dircproxy</b> doesn't notice that the connection  to  the  server  has  been  dropped
              because  the socket remains open.  For example, those behind a NAT'd firewall.  <b>dircproxy</b> can ping
              the server and make sure it gets replies back.  If the time since  the  last  reply  was  received
              exceeds  the number of seconds below the server is assumed to be "stoned" and <b>dircproxy</b> leaves it.
              If you have a high latency connection to the server, it can wrongly assume the  server  is  stoned
              because  the  PINGs  don't  arrive in time.  Either raise the value, or use the '<b>server_keepalive</b>'
              option instead.

               0 = don't send PINGs

       <b>server_throttle</b>
              To prevent you from being flooded off the IRC network, <b>dircproxy</b> can throttle  the  connection  to
              the server to prevent too much being sent within a certain time period.

              For  this  you  specify a number of bytes, then optionally a time period in seconds seperated by a
              colon.  If the time period is ommitted then per second is assmued.

               server_throttle 10        # 10 bytes per second
               server_throttle 10:2      # 10 bytes per 2 seconds (5 per second)

               0 = do not throttle the connection

       <b>server_autoconnect</b>
              Should <b>dircproxy</b> automatically connect to the first server in the list when you connect.   If  you
              set  this  to  'no', then '<b>allow_jump</b>' is automatically set to 'yes'.  If '<b>allow_jump_new</b>' is also
              'yes', then you can create connection classes with no '<b>server</b>' lines.

               yes = Automatically connect to the first server
               no = Wait for a /DIRCPROXY JUMP from the client

       <b>channel_rejoin</b>
              If we are kicked off a channel, how many seconds do we wait before attempting to rejoin.

               -1 = Don't rejoin
               0 = Immediately

       <b>channel_leave_on_detach</b>
              Should <b>dircproxy</b> automatically make you leave all the channels you were on when you detach?

               yes = Leave them
               no = Remain on them

       <b>channel_rejoin_on_attach</b>
              If '<b>channel_leave_on_detach</b>' is '<b>yes</b>' then should <b>dircproxy</b> rejoin those channels when you  attach
              again?

               yes = Rejoin the channels <b>dircproxy</b> automatically left
               no = Leave permanently on detach

       <b>idle_maxtime</b>
              Set  this  to the maximum amount of time you want to appear idle for while on IRC, if you set this
              then <b>dircproxy</b> will reset your idle time if it reaches this limit (in seconds).

               0 = Don't reset idle time

       <b>disconnect_existing_user</b>
              If, when you connect to <b>dircproxy</b>, another client is already using your connection class  (ie,  if
              you  forgot  to  close that one), then this option lets you automatically kill that one off.  Make
              sure you turn any "automatic reconnect to server" options off before using this, otherwise  you'll
              have a fight on your hands.

               yes = Yes, disconnect
               no = No, don't let me on

       <b>disconnect_on_detach</b>
              When  you  detach  from  <b>dircproxy</b>  it usually keeps you connected to the server until you connect
              again.  If you don't want this, and you want it to close your server connection as well, then  set
              this.

               yes = Close session on disconnection
               no = Stay connected to server until reattachment

       <b>initial_modes</b>
              Which user modes should we automatically set when you first connect to a server.  Just in case you
              forget to do it yourself with your irc client.

              Set to "" to not set any modes.

       <b>drop_modes</b>
              Which user modes to drop automatically when you detach, handy to limit the impact that your client
              has while connected, or for extra security if you're an IRCop.

              Set to "" to not drop any modes.

       <b>refuse_modes</b>
              Which  user  modes to refuse to accept from a server.  If the server attempts to set one of these,
              then the connection to it will be dropped and the next server in the list will be tried.

              A good setting for many people would be "+r", as most servers use that to mean your connection  is
              restricted.  Don't set it to this if you're on DALnet however, DALnet uses +r to indicate you have
              registered with NickServ (gee, thanks guys!).

              Set to "" to not refuse any modes.

       <b>local_address</b>
              Local  hostname  to use when connecting to an IRC server.  This provides the same functionality as
              the ircII -H parameter.

               none = Do not bind any specific hostname

       <b>away_message</b>
              If you don't explicitly set an /AWAY message before you detach, <b>dircproxy</b> can for you,  so  people
              don't think you are really at your keyboard when you're not.

               none = Do not set an away message for you

       <b>quit_message</b>
              If  you don't explicitly give a message when you /DIRCPROXY QUIT, this will be used instead.  Also
              used for when you've sent <b>dircproxy</b> not to remain attached to the server on detachment.

               none = Use <b>dircproxy</b> version number as QUIT message

       <b>attach_message</b>
              <b>dircproxy</b> can send an announcement onto every channel you are on when you reattach to it, just  to
              let  everyone  know you are back.  If you start this with "/ME " then it will be sent as an ACTION
              CTCP message (just like the ircII /me command).

               none = Do not announce attachment

       <b>detach_message</b>
              <b>dircproxy</b> can send an announcement onto every channel you are on when you detach from it, just  to
              let  everyone  know you are gone.  If you start this with "/ME " then it will be sent as an ACTION
              CTCP message (just like the ircII /me command).

               none = Do not announce detachment

       <b>detach_nickname</b>
              Nickname to change to automatically after you detach, to indicate you are away  for  example.   If
              this  contains  a  '*'  character, then that character is replaced with whataver your nickname was
              before you detached (ie "*_away" adds "_away" to the end of your nickname);

               none = Leave nickname as it is

       <b>nick_keep</b>
              Whether <b>dircproxy</b> should attempt to keep the nickname you last set using your client.  If this  is
              'yes'  and your nickname is lost while your client is disconnected, then it will keep on trying to
              get it back until a client connects again.

               yes = try to keep my nickname while I'm disconnected
               no = if it changes, leave it

       <b>ctcp_replies</b>
              Whether <b>dircproxy</b> should reply to the standard set of CTCP messages while the client is detached.

               yes = reply to ctcp messages while client is detached
               no = nothing but silence

       <b>chan_log_enabled</b>
              Whether logging of channel text to files should take place.  If this is 'yes', then you'll be able
              to recall channel text when you rejoin and see what you missed.

               yes = Channel text is logged to files
               no = Channel text is NOT logged to files

       <b>chan_log_always</b>
              Channel text will always be logged while you are offline, so when you come back you can  see  what
              you  missed.   You  can also, if you wish, log channel text while online, so if you're only away a
              short time you can get an idea of any context etc.

              This only applies if '<b>chan_log_enabled</b>' is 'yes'.

               yes = Log channel text while offline and online
               no = Log channel text only while offline

       <b>chan_log_maxsize</b>
              To preserve your harddisk space, you can limit the size of a channel log file.  Once the log  file
              reaches this number of lines, every line added will result in a line removed from the top.  If you
              know  you  are  never  going to want all that logged information, this might be a good setting for
              you.

              This only applies if '<b>chan_log_enabled</b>' is 'yes'.

               0 = No limit to log files

       <b>chan_log_recall</b>
              Number of lines from each channel log file to automatically recall to your  IRC  client  when  you
              attach.   If  this is low, you may not get much useful information, if this is high, it may take a
              long time for all the information to arrive.

              This only applies if '<b>chan_log_enabled</b>' is 'yes'.

               -1 = Recall the whole log (not recommended if chan_log_always is yes)
               0 = Don't automatically recall anything

       <b>chan_log_timestamp</b>
              Channel text can have a timestamp added to the front to let you know exactly when  a  message  was
              logged.   These  timestamps  are  displayed  when  you  recall the log files, or when automatially
              dumped.

              This applies to ordinary channel logs if '<b>chan_log_enabled</b>' is 'yes' and  also  to  the  permanent
              copy if '<b>chan_log_copydir</b>' is set to something other than 'none'.

               yes = Include timestamp
               no = Do not include timestamp

       <b>chan_log_relativetime</b>
              If  '<b>chan_log_timestamp</b>'  is  'yes'  then  you  also have the option of using intelligent relative
              timestamps.  If you do, the timestamp shown when log file information is recalled depends  on  how
              old  that  line  is,  making  sure  it  displays enough information (including date if necessary).
              Otherwise <b>dircproxy</b> will just tell you the time in HH:MM format which may not be as useful.

              This does mean that the time itself won't be displayed in the log files themselves, a timestamp is
              in place instead.  This may cause problems if you're doing things with the log files yourself.

               yes = Do fancy relative timestamping
               no = Do normal timestamping

       <b>chan_log_copydir</b>
              As well as <b>dircproxy</b>'s own log files, it can also keep a permanent copy somewhere  for  your  use.
              <b>dircproxy</b> will append all channel text seen to this file, but will not use it itself.

              If you do define it, it'll add to each log as you use it.  If you start with "~/" then it will use
              a directory under your home directory.

              This is done regardless of the '<b>chan_log_enabled</b>' and '<b>chan_log_always</b>' options, although if those
              are  off then you won't get that text recalled to your client, despite it being in this file.  The
              timestamping options do apply however.

               none = Do not make a permanent copy

       <b>chan_log_program</b>
              Program to pipe channel text into.  If given, <b>dircproxy</b> will run this program for  each  log  file
              entry  giving the full source information as the first argument, the destination as the second and
              the text as a single line on standard input.

              The program can be anywhere in your $PATH, or you can start it with "~/" if  its  in  a  directory
              under your home directory.

              This is done regardless of the '<b>chan_log_enabled</b>' and '<b>chan_log_always</b>' options.

               none = Do not pipe log messages to a program

       <b>other_log_enabled</b>
              Whether logging of server and private messages to files should take place.  If this is 'yes', then
              you'll be able to recall server and private messages when you rejoined and see what you missed.

               yes = Server/private messages are logged to files
               no = Server/private messages are NOT logged to files

       <b>other_log_always</b>
              Server and private messages will always be logged while you are offline, so when you come back you
              can see what you missed.  You can also, if you wish, log these messages while online, so if you're
              only away a short time you can get an idea of any context etc.

              This only applies if '<b>other_log_enabled</b>' is 'yes'.

               yes = Log server/private messages while offline and online
               no = Log server/private messages only while offline

       <b>other_log_maxsize</b>
              To  preserve  your  harddisk space, you can limit the size of the server/private message log file.
              Once the log file reaches this number of lines, every line added will result  in  a  line  removed
              from  the top.  If you know you are never going to want all that logged information, this might be
              a good setting for you.

              This only applies if '<b>other_log_enabled</b>' is 'yes'.

               0 = No limit to log file

       <b>other_log_recall</b>
              Number of lines from the server/private message log file  to  automatically  recall  to  your  IRC
              client when you attach.  If this is low, you may not get much useful information, if this is high,
              it may take a long time for all the information to arrive.

              This only applies if '<b>other_log_enabled</b>' is 'yes'.

               -1 = Recall the whole log (not recommended if other_log_always is yes)
               0 = Don't automatically recall anything

       <b>other_log_timestamp</b>
              Server and private messages can have a timestamp added to the front to let you know exactly when a
              message  was  logged.   These  timestamps  are  displayed  when  you recall the log files, or when
              automatially dumped.

              This applies to the server/private message log  if  '<b>other_log_enabled</b>'  is  'yes'  and  also  the
              permanet copy if '<b>other_log_copydir</b>' is set to something other than 'none'.

               yes = Include timestamp
               no = Do not include timestamp

       <b>other_log_relativetime</b>
              If  '<b>other_log_timestamp</b>'  is  'yes'  then  you also have the option of using intelligent relative
              timestamps.  If you do, the timestamp shown when log file information is recalled depends  on  how
              old  that  line  is,  making  sure  it  displays enough information (including date if necessary).
              Otherwise <b>dircproxy</b> will just tell you the time in HH:MM format which may not be as useful.

              This does mean that the time itself won't be displayed in the log files themselves, a timestamp is
              in place instead.  This may cause problems if you're doing things with the log files yourself.

               yes = Do fancy relative timestamping
               no = Do normal timestamping

       <b>other_log_copydir</b>
              As well as <b>dircproxy</b>'s own log file, it  can  keep  a  permanent  copy  somewhere  for  your  use.
              <b>dircproxy</b>  will  append  all  server  and  private messages seen to this file, but will not use it
              itself.

              If you do define it, it'll add to the log as it uses it.  If you start with "~/" then it will  use
              a directory under your home directory.

              This  is  done  regardless  of the '<b>other_log_enabled</b>' and '<b>other_log_always</b>' options, although if
              those are off then won't get that text recalled to your client, despite it  being  in  this  file.
              The timestamping options do apply however.

               none = Do not make a permanent copy

       <b>other_log_program</b>
              Program  to  pipe server and private messages into.  If given, <b>dircproxy</b> will run this program for
              each log file entry giving the full source information as the first argument, the  destination  as
              the second and the text as a single line on standard input.

              The  program  can  be  anywhere in your $PATH, or you can start it with "~/" if its in a directory
              under your home directory.

              This is done regardless of the '<b>other_log_enabled</b>' and '<b>other_log_always</b>' options.

               none = Do not pipe log messages to a program

       <b>log_timeoffset</b>
              Difference in minutes from your IRC client to the <b>dircproxy</b> machine.  So if  you're  in  GMT,  but
              your  <b>dircproxy</b>  machine is in PST (which is 8 hours behind), then this would be -(8 * 60) = -480.
              Used for log file timestamps.

               0 = Don't adjust log timestamps.

       <b>log_events</b>
              Events you want <b>dircproxy</b> to log for you.  This is a comma seperated list of event names, prefixed
              with '+' to add the event to the list or '-' to remove an event.  You can also  specify  'all'  to
              log all events (the default) or 'none' to not log anything.

              Example, to just log text and action's:

               log_events "none,+text,+action"

              Example, to log everything but server messages:

               log_events "all,-server"
               # you don't need to specify 'all'
               log_events -server

              The possible events are:

              <b>text</b>
               Channel text and private messages

              <b>action</b>
               CTCP ACTION events (/me) sent to you or channels

              <b>ctcp</b>
               Whether to record whether a CTCP was sent to you

              <b>join</b>

              <b>quit</b>
               People quit''ing from IRC

              <b>nick</b>
               People (including you) changing nickname

              <b>mode</b>
               Changes in channel modes or your own personal mode

              <b>topic</b>
               Changes to the channel topic

              <b>client</b>
               You detaching and attaching

              <b>server</b>
               Connections and disconnections from servers

              <b>error</b>
               Problems and errors <b>dircproxy</b> encounters (recommended!)

       <b>dcc_proxy_incoming</b>
              Whether <b>dircproxy</b> should proxy DCC chat and send requests sent <b>to</b> you by others on IRC.

               yes = Proxy incoming requests.
               no = Do not proxy incoming requests.

       <b>dcc_proxy_outgoing</b>
              Whether <b>dircproxy</b> should proxy DCC chat and send requests sent <b>by</b> you to others on IRC.

               yes = Proxy outgoing requests.
               no = Do not proxy outgoing requests.

       <b>dcc_proxy_ports</b>
              Ports  that  <b>dircproxy</b> can use to listen for DCC connections on.  This is for when you're behind a
              firewall that only allows certain ports through, or when doing DCC-via-ssh.

              It  is  a  comma  seperated  list  of   port   numbers   or   ranges   of   ports,   for   example
              '57100-57199,57400,57500,57600-57800'

               any = Use any port given to us by the kernel.

       <b>dcc_proxy_timeout</b>
              Maxmimum amount of time (in seconds) to allow for both sides of a DCC proxy to be connected.

       <b>dcc_proxy_sendreject</b>
              Whether  to  send a physical REJECT message via CTCP back to the source of the request in event of
              failure.

               yes = Send reject CTCP message back.
               no = Do not send any message back.

       <b>dcc_send_fast</b>
              Whether to ignore the "acknowledgment" packets from the client and just send the file to  them  as
              fast as possible.  There should be no real danger in doing this.

               yes = Send as fast as possible.
               no = Wait for each packet to be acknowledged.

       <b>dcc_capture_directory</b>
              <b>dircproxy</b>  can  capture  files sent via DCC and store them on the server.  Especially useful while
              you are detached, whether it does it while attached or not depends on '<b>dcc_capture_always</b>'.   This
              is the directory to store those captured files in.

              If start with "~/" then it will use a directory under your home directory.

               none = Do not capture files.

       <b>dcc_capture_always</b>
              If  we're  capturing DCC send's, should we do it while the client is connected as well?  If 'yes',
              then the client will never see the file, it'll be just stored on the server with a notice sent  to
              the client telling them where.

               yes = Capture even when a client is connected.
               no = Capture only when client detached.

       <b>dcc_capture_withnick</b>
              Whether  to  start  the filename of the captured file with the nickname of the sender, so you know
              who it came from.

               yes = Start with nickname.
               no = Do not alter the filename.

       <b>dcc_capture_maxsize</b>
              Maximum size (in kilobytes) that a captured file can be.  If a captured file is larger than  this,
              or  becomes larger than this, then the capture will be aborted and the file removed from the disk.
              Prevents people from filling your disk up while you're detached with a massive file.

               0 = No limit to file size.

       <b>dcc_tunnel_incoming</b>
              Port of a local ssh tunnel leading to another <b>dircproxy</b> client that we should use for incoming DCC
              requests.  This should not be set if '<b>dcc_tunnel_outgoing</b>' is set.

              See the README.dcc-via-ssh file included with the <b>dircproxy</b> distribution for more information.

              This can be a numeric port number, or a service name from <a href="file:/etc/services">/etc/services</a>

               none = There is no tunnel.

       <b>dcc_tunnel_outgoing</b>
              Port of a local ssh tunnel leading to another <b>dircproxy</b> client that we should use for outgoing DCC
              requests.  This should not be set if '<b>dcc_tunnel_incoming</b>' is set.

              See the README.dcc-via-ssh file included with the <b>dircproxy</b> distribution for more information.

              This can be a numeric port number, or a service name from <a href="file:/etc/services">/etc/services</a>

               none = There is no tunnel.

       <b>switch_user</b>
              If you're running <b>dircproxy</b> as root, it can switch to a different "effective user  id"  to  create
              the server connection.  This means that your system ident daemon (and therefore IRC, if it queries
              it) will see your server connection as the user you put here, instead of root.

              This  is  most  useful if you are sysadmin running a <b>dircproxy</b> server for multiple people and want
              them to all appear as different usernames without using a hacked  identd.   Because  <b>dircproxy</b>  is
              still running as root, it will have those privileges for all operations, including the <b><a href="../man2/bind.2.html">bind</a></b>(2) for
              the '<b>local_address</b>' config option if you're using Secure Linux patches.

              This  can  only be used if your system supports <b><a href="../man2/seteuid.2.html">seteuid</a></b>(2) and if you are running <b>dircproxy</b> as the
              root user, and not just setuid.  Attempting otherwise will generate a warning as <b>dircproxy</b> starts.

              This can be a numeric uid or a username from /etc/passwd.

               none = Do not do this.

       <b>motd_logo</b>
              If this is yes, then the <b>dircproxy</b> logo and version number will be included in the message of  the
              day when you connect.  Only the picky would turn this off, its pretty!

               yes = Show me the pretty logo
               no = I don't like logos, I'm boring, I eat llamas.

       <b>motd_file</b>
              Custom message of the day file to send when users connect to <b>dircproxy</b>.  The contents of this file
              will be sent after the logo and before the stats.  If you start this with a "~/" then it refers to
              a file in a directory under your home directory.

               none = No custom motd

       <b>motd_stats</b>
              Display  information  on  what  channels you were on, and log file sizes etc in the message of the
              day.  This is handy, and lets you know how not only much information you missed, but how much will
              be sent to you.

               yes = Show the stats
               no = They don't interest me, don't show them.

       <b>allow_persist</b>
              You can disable the /DIRCPROXY PERSIST command if you do not want people using your  proxy  to  be
              able to do that.

               yes = Command enabled
               no = Command disabled

       <b>allow_jump</b>
              You can disable the /DIRCPROXY JUMP command if you do not want people to do that.

               yes = Command enabled
               no = Command disabled

       <b>allow_jump_new</b>
              If  the  /DIRCPROXY  JUMP  commmand  is  enabled,  then you can disable it being used to jump to a
              server:port not in the list specified in the configuration file.

               yes = Can jump to any server
               no = Only ones in the config file

       <b>allow_host</b>
              You can disable the /DIRCPROXY HOST command if you do not want people to do that.

               yes = Command enabled
               no = Command disabled

       <b>allow_die</b>
              You can enable the /DIRCPROXY DIE command if you want people to be able to kill your proxy.   This
              isn't  recommended  as a global option, instead only enable it for a specific connection class (ie
              yours).

               yes = Command enabled
               no = Command disabled

       <b>allow_users</b>
              You can enable the /DIRCPROXY USERS command if you want people to be able to see who's using  your
              proxy.   This  isn't  recommended  as  a  global  option,  instead  only  enable it for a specific
              connection class (ie yours).

               yes = Command enabled
               no = Command disabled

       <b>allow_kill</b>
              You can enable the /DIRCPROXY KILL command if you want people to  be  able  to  disconnect  anyone
              using your proxy (including you!).  This isn't recommended as a global option, instead only enable
              it for a specific connection class (ie yours).

               yes = Command enabled
               no = Command disabled

       Additionally,  the  following  keywords may go only inside a connection class definition.  One '<b>password</b>'
       and at least one '<b>server</b>' (unless  '<b>server_autoconnect</b>'  is  'no'  and  '<b>allow_jump_new</b>'  is  'yes')  are
       mandatory.

       <b>password</b>
              Password  required  to  use  this  connection class.  This should be encrypted using your system's
              <b><a href="../man3/crypt.3.html">crypt</a></b>(3) function.  It must be the same as the password supplied by the IRC client  on  connection
              for this connection class to be used.

              You can use the included <b><a href="../man1/dircproxy-crypt.1.html">dircproxy-crypt</a></b>(1) utility to generate these passwords.

       <b>server</b> Server  to  connect  to.   Multiple servers can be given, in which case they are iterated when the
              connection to one is dropped.  This has the following format:

              [<b>hostname</b>[:[<b>port</b>][:<b>password</b>]]

       <b>from</b>   The connection hostname must match this mask, multiple masks can be specified to allow more  hosts
              to connect.  The * and ? wildcards may be used.

       <b>join</b>   Channels to join when you first connect.  Multiple channels can be given, either by seperating the
              names with a comma, or by specifying multiple from the channel name with a space.

              Note: You <u>must</u> surround the list of channels with quotes to distinguish from comments.

              For clarification, this is the format of this line:

              join "<b>channel</b>[ <b>key</b>][,<b>channel</b>[ <b>key</b>]]..."

</pre><h4><b>SIGNALS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>dircproxy</b> will reread its configuration file whenever it receives the hangup signal, <u>SIGHUP</u>.

       Sending  an  interrupt  signal,  <u>SIGINT</u>,  or  a  terminate  signal, <u>SIGTERM</u>, will cause <b>dircproxy</b> to exit
       cleanly.
