</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>radclient</b> is a radius client program. It can send arbitrary radius packets to a radius server, then shows
       the  reply.  It can be used to test changes you made in the configuration of the radius server, or it can
       be used to monitor if a radius server is up.

       <b>radclient</b> reads radius attribute/value pairs from it standard input, or from  a  file  specified  on  the
       command  line.  It  then  encodes these attribute/value pairs using the dictionary, and sends them to the
       remote server.

       The <u>User-Password</u> and <u>CHAP-Password</u> attributes are automatically encrypted before the packet is  sent  to
       the server.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       -4     Use IPv4 (default)

       -6     Use IPv6

       -b     Enforce  the Blast RADIUS checks.  All replies to an Access-Request packet must contain a Message-
              Authenticator as the first attribute.

              For compatibility with old servers, this flag is not set by  default.   However,  radclient  still
              checks for the Blast RADIUS signature, and discards packets which match the attack.

       -c <u>count</u>
              Send each packet <u>count</u> times.

       -d <u>raddb_directory</u>
              The directory that contains the user dictionary file. Defaults to <u>/etc/freeradius/3.0</u>.

       -D <u>dictionary_directory</u>
              The directory that contains the main dictionary file. Defaults to <u>/usr/share/freeradius</u>.

       -f <u>file[:file]</u>
              File  to  read the attribute/value pairs from. If this is not specified, they are read from stdin.
              This option can be specified multiple times, in which case packets are sent in order by file,  and
              within each file, by first packet to last packet.  A blank line separates logical packets within a
              file.   If  a  pair  of  files  separated by a colon is specified, the second file will be used to
              filter the responses to requests from the first. The number of requests and filters  must  be  the
              same.  A summary of filter results will be displayed if -s is passed.

       -F     Print the file name, packet number and reply code.

       -h     Print usage help information.

       -i <u>id</u>  Use <u>id</u> as the RADIUS request Id.

       -n <u>num_requests_per_second</u>
              Try  to send <u>num_requests_per_second</u>, evenly spaced.  This option allows you to slow down the rate
              at which radclient sends requests.  When not using -n, the default is to send packets  as  quickly
              as possible, with no inter-packet delays.

              Due  to  limitations  in  radclient,  this option does not accurately send the requested number of
              packets per second.

       -p <u>num_requests_in_parallel</u>
              Send <u>num_requests_in_parallel</u>, without waiting for a response for each one.  By default, radclient
              sends the first request it has read, waits for the response, and once the  response  is  received,
              sends  the  second  request  in  its  list.   This  option  allows  you  to  send many requests at
              simultaneously.  Once <u>num_requests_in_parallel</u> are sent, radclient waits for all of the  responses
              to arrive (or for the requests to time out), before sending any more packets.

              This option permits you to discover the maximum load accepted by a RADIUS server.

       -P <u>proto</u>
              Use  <u>proto</u> transport protocol ("tcp" or "udp").  Only available if FreeRADIUS is compiled with TCP
              transport support.

       -q     Go to quiet mode, and do not print out anything.

       -r <u>num_retries</u>
              Try to send each packet <u>num_retries</u> times, before giving up on it.  The default is 10.

       -s     Print out some summaries of packets sent and received.

       -S <u>shared_secret_file</u>
              Rather than reading the shared secret from the command-line (where it can be seen by others on the
              local system), read it instead from <u>shared_secret_file</u>.

       -t <u>timeout</u>
              Wait <u>timeout</u> seconds before deciding that the NAS has not responded to a request,  and  re-sending
              the packet.  The default timeout is 3.

       -v     Print out version information.

       -x     Print out debugging information.

       server[:port]
              The hostname or IP address of the remote server. Optionally a UDP port can be specified. If no UDP
              port  is  specified,  it is looked up in <u><a href="file:/etc/services">/etc/services</a></u>. The service name looked for is <b>radacct</b> for
              accounting packets, and <b>radius</b> for all other requests. If a service is not found in <u><a href="file:/etc/services">/etc/services</a></u>,
              1813 and 1812 are used respectively.  For coa and disconnect packets, port 3799 is used.

              If a host name is specified, then radclient will do a DNS lookup, and use the A record to find the
              IP address of the RADIUS server.  If there is no A record, then radclient will look  for  an  AAAA
              record.  If there is no AAAA record, an error will be produced.

              IPv6   addresses   may   be  specified  by  surrounding  it  in  square  brackets.   For  example,
              [2002:c000:0201:0:0:0:0:0], or with a port, [2002:c000:0201:0:0:0:0:0]:18120.

              The RADIUS attributes read by <u>radclient</u> can contain the special  attribute  <b>Packet-Dst-IP-Address</b>.
              If  this  attribute  exists,  then  that  IP  address  is where the packet is sent, and the <b>server</b>
              specified on the command-line is ignored.

              If the RADIUS attribute list always contains the <b>Packet-Dst-IP-Address</b> attribute, then the  <b>server</b>
              parameter can be given as <b>-</b>.

              The  RADIUS  attributes  read  by <u>radclient</u> can contain the special attribute <b>Packet-Dst-Port</b>.  If
              this attribute exists, then that UDP port is where the packet is sent, and the <b>:port</b> specified  on
              the command-line is ignored.

       acct | auth | status | coa | disconnect | auto
              Use  <b>auth</b>  to  send  an  authentication packet (Access-Request), <b>acct</b> to send an accounting packet
              (Accounting-Request), <b>status</b> to send a status packet  (Status-Server),  or  <b>coa</b>  to  send  a  CoA-
              Request,  or <b>disconnect</b> to send a disconnection request. Instead of these values, you can also use
              a decimal code here. For example, code 12 is also <b>Status-Server</b>.

              The RADIUS attributes read by <u>radclient</u> can contain the special attribute  <b>Packet-Type</b>.   If  this
              attribute  exists, then that type of packet is sent, and the <u>type</u> specified on the command-line is
              ignored.

              If the RADIUS attribute list always contains the <b>Packet-Type</b> attribute, then  the  <b>type</b>  parameter
              can be given as <b>auto</b>.

       secret The  shared secret for this client.  It needs to be defined on the radius server side too, for the
              IP address you are sending the radius packets from.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLE</b></h4><pre>
       A sample session that queries the remote server for <u>Status-Server</u> (not  all  servers  support  this,  but
       FreeRADIUS has configurable support for it).

              $ echo "Message-Authenticator = 0x00" | radclient 192.0.2.42 status s3cr3t
              Sending request to server 192.0.2.42, port 1812.
              radrecv: Packet from host 192.0.2.42 code=2, id=140, length=54
                  Reply-Message = "FreeRADIUS up 21 days, 02:05"
