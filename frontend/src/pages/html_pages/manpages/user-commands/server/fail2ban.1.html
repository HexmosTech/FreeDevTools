</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       fail2ban - a set of server and client programs to limit brute force authentication attempts.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Fail2Ban  consists  of  a  client,  server  and  configuration  files to limit brute force authentication
       attempts.

       The server program <b>fail2ban-server</b>  is  responsible  for  monitoring  log  files  and  issuing  ban/unban
       commands.   It  gets  configured  through  a  simple  protocol  by  <b>fail2ban-client</b>,  which can also read
       configuration files and issue corresponding configuration commands to the server.

       For details on the configuration of fail2ban see the <a href="../man5/jail.conf.5.html">jail.conf</a>(5) manual page.  A jail (as  specified  in
       jail.conf) couples filters and actions definitions for any given list of files to get monitored.

       For details on the command-line options of fail2ban-server see the <a href="../man1/fail2ban-server.1.html">fail2ban-server</a>(1) manual page.

       For  details  on the command-line options and commands for configuring the server via fail2ban-client see
       the <a href="../man1/fail2ban-client.1.html">fail2ban-client</a>(1) manual page.

       For testing regular expressions specified in a filter using the fail2ban-regex program may be of use  and
       its manual page is <a href="../man1/fail2ban-regex.1.html">fail2ban-regex</a>(1).

</pre><h4><b>LIMITATION</b></h4><pre>
       Fail2Ban is able to reduce the rate of incorrect authentications attempts however it cannot eliminate the
       risk  that  weak  authentication  presents.   Configure services to use only two factor or public/private
       authentication mechanisms if you really want to protect services.

       A local user is able to inject messages into syslog and using a Fail2Ban jail  that  reads  from  syslog,
       they  can  effectively  trigger  a DoS attack against any IP. Know this risk and configure Fail2Ban/grant
       shell access accordingly.
