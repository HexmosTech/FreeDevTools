</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Xserver - X Window System display server

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>X</b> [option ...]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>X</u>  is  the generic name for the X Window System display server.  It is frequently a link or a copy of the
       appropriate server binary for driving the most frequently used server on a given machine.

</pre><h4><b>STARTING</b> <b>THE</b> <b>SERVER</b></h4><pre>
       The X server is usually started from the X Display Manager program <u><a href="../man1/xdm.1.html">xdm</a></u>(1) or a  similar  display  manager
       program.   This  utility  is run from the system boot files and takes care of keeping the server running,
       prompting for usernames and passwords, and starting up the user sessions.

       Installations that run more than one window system may need to use the  <u><a href="../man1/xinit.1.html">xinit</a></u>(1)  utility  instead  of  a
       display  manager.   However,  <u>xinit</u>  is  to  be considered a tool for building startup scripts and is not
       intended for use by end users.  Site administrators are <b>strongly</b> urged to use a display manager, or build
       other interfaces for novice users.

       The X server may also be started directly by the user, though this method is usually reserved for testing
       and is not recommended for normal operation.  On some platforms, the user must have special permission to
       start the X server, often because access to certain  devices  (e.g.  <u>/dev/mouse</u>)  is  restricted.   Where
       applicable, the X server notifies systemd when it is ready to process requests.

       When  the  X  server starts up, it typically takes over the display.  If you are running on a workstation
       whose console is the display, you may not be able to log into the console while the server is running.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Many X servers have device-specific command line options.   See  the  manual  pages  for  the  individual
       servers  for  more  details;  a  list of server-specific manual pages is provided in the SEE ALSO section
       below.

       All of the X servers accept  the  command  line  options  described  below.   Some  X  servers  may  have
       alternative ways of providing the parameters described here, but the values provided via the command line
       options should override values specified via other mechanisms.

       <b>:</b><u>displaynumber</u>
               The  X  server runs as the given <u>displaynumber</u>, which by default is 0.  If multiple X servers are
               to run simultaneously on a host, each must have a unique display number.  See the  DISPLAY  NAMES
               section  of  the <u><a href="../man7/X.7.html">X</a></u>(7) manual page to learn how to specify which display number clients should try
               to use.

       <b>-a</b> <u>number</u>
               sets pointer acceleration (i.e. the ratio of how much is reported to how much the  user  actually
               moved the pointer).

       <b>-ac</b>     disables  host-based access control mechanisms.  Enables access by any host, and permits any host
               to modify the access control list.  Use with extreme caution.  This option exists  primarily  for
               running test suites remotely.

       <b>-audit</b> <u>level</u>
               sets  the  audit  trail  level.   The  default level is 1, meaning only connection rejections are
               reported.  Level 2 additionally reports all successful  connections  and  disconnects.   Level  4
               enables  messages from the SECURITY extension, if present, including generation and revocation of
               authorizations and violations of the security policy.  Level 0 turns off the audit trail.   Audit
               lines are sent as standard error output.

       <b>-auth</b> <u>authorization-file</u>
               specifies  a  file  which  contains  a  collection  of authorization records used to authenticate
               access.  See also the <u><a href="../man1/xdm.1.html">xdm</a></u>(1) and <u><a href="../man7/Xsecurity.7.html">Xsecurity</a></u>(7) manual pages.

       <b>-background</b> <b>none</b>
               Asks the driver not to clear the background on startup, if the  driver  supports  that.   May  be
               useful for smooth transition with eg. fbdev driver.  For security reasons this is not the default
               as the screen contents might show a previous user session.

       <b>-br</b>     sets the default root window to solid black instead of the standard root weave pattern.   This is
               the default unless -retro or -wr is specified.

       <b>-bs</b>     disables backing store support on all screens.

       <b>+byteswappedclients</b>
               Allow  connections  from  clients with an endianess different to that of the server.  This is the
               default unless <b>-byteswappedclients</b> is specified.

       <b>-byteswappedclients</b>
               Prohibit connections from clients with an endianess different to that of the server.

       <b>-c</b>      turns off key-click.

       <b>c</b> <u>volume</u>
               sets key-click volume (allowable range: 0-100).

       <b>-cc</b> <u>class</u>
               sets the visual class for the root window of color screens.  The class numbers are  as  specified
               in the X protocol.  Not obeyed by all servers.

       <b>-core</b>   causes the server to generate a core dump on fatal errors.

       <b>-displayfd</b> <u>fd</u>
               specifies  a file descriptor in the launching process.  Rather than specify a display number, the
               X server will attempt to listen on successively higher display numbers, and upon finding  a  free
               one,  will  write the display number back on this file descriptor as a newline-terminated string.
               The -pn option is ignored when using -displayfd.

       <b>-deferglyphs</b> <u>whichfonts</u>
               specifies the types of fonts for which the server should attempt to use deferred  glyph  loading.
               <u>whichfonts</u> can be all (all fonts), none (no fonts), or 16 (16 bit fonts only).

       <b>-dpi</b> <u>resolution</u>
               sets  the  resolution  for  all  screens,  in  dots  per inch.  To be used when the server cannot
               determine the screen size(s) from the hardware.

       <b>dpms</b>    enables DPMS (display power management services), where supported.  The default state is platform
               and configuration specific.

       <b>-dpms</b>   disables  DPMS  (display  power  management  services).   The  default  state  is  platform   and
               configuration specific.

       <b>-extension</b><u>extensionName</u>
               disables  named  extension.    If  an  unknown  extension  name  is specified, a list of accepted
               extension names is printed.

       <b>+extension</b><u>extensionName</u>
               enables named extension.   If an  unknown  extension  name  is  specified,  a  list  of  accepted
               extension names is printed.

       <b>-f</b> <u>volume</u>
               sets beep (bell) volume (allowable range: 0-100).

       <b>-fakescreenfps</b> <b>ps</b>
               sets fake presenter screen default fps (allowable range: 1-600).

       <b>-fp</b> <u>fontPath</u>
               sets  the  search path for fonts.  This path is a comma separated list of directories which the X
               server searches for font databases.   See  the  FONTS  section  of  this  manual  page  for  more
               information and the default list.

       <b>-help</b>   prints a usage message.

       <b>-I</b>      causes all remaining command line arguments to be ignored.

       <b>-iglx</b>   Prohibit  creating indirect GLX contexts.  Indirect GLX is of limited use, since it lacks support
               for many modern OpenGL features and extensions; it's slower than direct contexts; and it opens  a
               large attack surface for protocol parsing errors.  This is the default unless +iglx is specified.

       <b>+iglx</b>   Allow creating indirect GLX contexts.

       <b>-maxbigreqsize</b> <u>size</u>
               sets the maximum big request to <u>size</u> MB.

       <b>-nocursor</b>
               disable the display of the pointer cursor.

       <b>-nolisten</b> <u>trans-type</u>
               disables  a  transport type.  For example, TCP/IP connections can be disabled with <b>-nolisten</b> <b>tcp</b>.
               This option may be issued multiple times to  disable  listening  to  different  transport  types.
               Supported transport types are platform dependent, but commonly include:
               tcp     TCP over IPv4 or IPv6
               inet    TCP over IPv4 only
               inet6   TCP over IPv6 only
               unix    UNIX Domain Sockets
               local   Platform preferred local connection method

       <b>-listen</b> <u>trans-type</u>
               enables a transport type.  For example, TCP/IP connections can be enabled with <b>-listen</b> <b>tcp</b>.  This
               option may be issued multiple times to enable listening to different transport types.

       <b>-noreset</b>
               prevents  a  server  reset  when the last client connection is closed.  This overrides a previous
               <b>-terminate</b> command line option.

       <b>-p</b> <u>minutes</u>
               sets screen-saver pattern cycle time in minutes.

       <b>-pn</b>     permits the server to continue running if it fails to establish all  of  its  well-known  sockets
               (connection points for clients), but establishes at least one.  This option is set by default.

       <b>-nopn</b>   causes  the  server  to  exit  if it fails to establish all of its well-known sockets (connection
               points for clients).

       <b>-r</b>      turns off auto-repeat.

       <b>r</b>       turns on auto-repeat.

       <b>-retro</b>  starts the server with the classic stipple and cursor visible.  The default is to  start  with  a
               black  root  window,  and  to  suppress display of the cursor until the first time an application
               calls XDefineCursor(). For kdrive servers, this implies -zap.

       <b>-s</b> <u>minutes</u>
               sets screen-saver timeout time in minutes.

       <b>-su</b>     disables save under support on all screens.

       <b>-seat</b> <u>seat</u>
               seat to run on. Takes a string identifying a seat in a platform  specific  syntax.  On  platforms
               which  support this feature this may be used to limit the server to expose only a specific subset
               of devices connected to the system.

       <b>-t</b> <u>number</u>
               sets pointer acceleration threshold in pixels (i.e. after how many  pixels  pointer  acceleration
               should take effect).

       <b>-terminate</b> <u>[delay]</u>
               causes  the  server to terminate at server reset, instead of continuing to run.  This overrides a
               previous <b>-noreset</b> command line option.  If a delay in seconds is specified, the server waits  for
               at  least  the  delay.  At  the  end  of  this grace period if no client is connected, the server
               terminates immediately.

       <b>-tst</b>    disables all testing extensions (e.g., XTEST, XTrap, XTestExtension1, RECORD).

       <b>tty</b><u>xx</u>   ignored, for servers started the ancient way (from init).

       <b>v</b>       sets video-off screen-saver preference.

       <b>-v</b>      sets video-on screen-saver preference.

       <b>-wr</b>     sets the default root window to solid white instead of the standard root weave pattern.

       <b>-x</b> <u>extension</u>
               loads the specified extension at init.  This is a no-op for most implementations.

       <b>[+-]xinerama</b>
               enables(+)  or  disables(-)  the  XINERAMA  extension.   The  default  state  is   platform   and
               configuration specific.

</pre><h4><b>SERVER</b> <b>DEPENDENT</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Some X servers accept the following options:

       <b>-ld</b> <u>kilobytes</u>
               sets  the  data  space limit of the server to the specified number of kilobytes.  A value of zero
               makes the data size as large as possible.  The default value of -1 leaves the  data  space  limit
               unchanged.

       <b>-lf</b> <u>files</u>
               sets the number-of-open-files limit of the server to the specified number.  A value of zero makes
               the limit as large as possible.  The default value of -1 leaves the limit unchanged.

       <b>-ls</b> <u>kilobytes</u>
               sets  the  stack space limit of the server to the specified number of kilobytes.  A value of zero
               makes the stack size as large as possible.  The default value of -1 leaves the stack space  limit
               unchanged.

       <b>-maxclients</b>
               <b>64</b>|<b>128</b>|<b>256</b>|<b>512</b>  Set the maximum number of clients allowed to connect to the X server.  Acceptable
               values are 64, 128, 256 or 512.

       <b>-render</b> <b>default</b>|<b>mono</b>|<b>gray</b>|<b>color</b> sets the color  allocation  policy  that  will  be  used  by  the  render
               extension.

               <u>default</u> selects the default policy defined for the display depth of the X server.

               <u>mono</u>    don't use any color cell.

               <u>gray</u>    use a gray map of 13 color cells for the X render extension.

               <u>color</u>   use a color cube of at most 4*4*4 colors (that is 64 color cells).

       <b>-dumbSched</b>
               disables smart scheduling on platforms that support the smart scheduler.

       <b>-schedInterval</b> <u>interval</u>
               sets the smart scheduler's scheduling interval to <u>interval</u> milliseconds.

</pre><h4><b>XDMCP</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       X  servers  that  support  XDMCP  have the following options.  See the <u>X</u> <u>Display</u> <u>Manager</u> <u>Control</u> <u>Protocol</u>
       specification for more information.

       <b>-query</b> <u>hostname</u>
               enables XDMCP and sends Query packets to the specified <u>hostname</u>.

       <b>-broadcast</b>
               enable XDMCP and broadcasts BroadcastQuery packets to the network.  The first responding  display
               manager will be chosen for the session.

       <b>-multicast</b> <b>[</b><u>address</u> <b>[</b><u>hop</u> <u>count</u><b>]]</b>
               Enable  XDMCP and multicast BroadcastQuery packets to the  network.  The first responding display
               manager is chosen for the session.  If an address is specified, the multicast  is  sent  to  that
               address.   If  no address is specified, the multicast is sent to the default XDMCP IPv6 multicast
               group.  If a hop count is specified, it is used as the maximum hop count for the  multicast.   If
               no  hop  count is specified, the multicast is set to a maximum of 1 hop, to prevent the multicast
               from being routed beyond the local network.

       <b>-indirect</b> <u>hostname</u>
               enables XDMCP and send IndirectQuery packets to the specified <u>hostname</u>.

       <b>-port</b> <u>port-number</u>
               uses the specified <u>port-number</u> for XDMCP packets, instead of the default.  This  option  must  be
               specified before any -query, -broadcast, -multicast, or -indirect options.

       <b>-from</b> <u>local-address</u>
               specifies  the  local address to connect from (useful if the connecting host has multiple network
               interfaces).  The <u>local-address</u> may be expressed in any form acceptable to  the  host  platform's
               <u><a href="../man3/gethostbyname.3.html">gethostbyname</a></u>(3) implementation.

       <b>-once</b>   causes the server to terminate (rather than reset) when the XDMCP session ends.

       <b>-class</b> <u>display-class</u>
               XDMCP  has  an additional display qualifier used in resource lookup for display-specific options.
               This option sets that value, by default it is "MIT-unspecified" (not a very useful value).

       <b>-cookie</b> <u>xdm-auth-bits</u>
               When testing XDM-AUTHENTICATION-1, a private key is shared between the server  and  the  manager.
               This  option  sets  the  value  of  that  private data (not that it is very private, being on the
               command line!).

       <b>-displayID</b> <u>display-id</u>
               Yet another XDMCP specific value, this one allows the display manager to identify each display so
               that it can locate the shared key.

</pre><h4><b>XKEYBOARD</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       X servers that support the XKEYBOARD (a.k.a. "XKB") extension accept the following options.   All  layout
       files  specified  on  the  command  line must be located in the XKB base directory or a subdirectory, and
       specified as the relative path  from  the  XKB  base  directory.   The  default  XKB  base  directory  is
       <u>/usr/lib/X11/xkb</u>.

       <b>[+-]accessx</b> [ <u>timeout</u> [ <u>timeout_mask</u> [ <u>feedback</u> [ <u>options_mask</u> ] ] ] ]
               enables(+) or disables(-) AccessX key sequences.

       <b>-xkbdir</b> <u>directory</u>
               base  directory  for  keyboard  layout  files.  This option is not available for setuid X servers
               (i.e., when the X server's real and effective uids are different).

       <b>-ardelay</b> <u>milliseconds</u>
               sets the autorepeat delay (length of time in milliseconds that a key  must  be  depressed  before
               autorepeat starts).

       <b>-arinterval</b> <u>milliseconds</u>
               sets  the  autorepeat  interval  (length  of  time  in  milliseconds  that  should elapse between
               autorepeat-generated keystrokes).

       <b>-xkbmap</b> <u>filename</u>
               loads keyboard description in <u>filename</u> on server startup.

</pre><h4><b>NETWORK</b> <b>CONNECTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The X server supports client connections via a  platform-dependent  subset  of  the  following  transport
       types:  TCP/IP,  Unix  Domain  sockets, and several varieties of SVR4 local connections.  See the DISPLAY
       NAMES section of the <u><a href="../man7/X.7.html">X</a></u>(7) manual page to learn how to specify which transport type clients should try  to
       use.

</pre><h4><b>GRANTING</b> <b>ACCESS</b></h4><pre>
       The  X server implements a platform-dependent subset of the following authorization protocols: MIT-MAGIC-
       COOKIE-1, XDM-AUTHORIZATION-1, XDM-AUTHORIZATION-2, SUN-DES-1, and MIT-KERBEROS-5.  See the  <u><a href="../man7/Xsecurity.7.html">Xsecurity</a></u>(7)
       manual page for information on the operation of these protocols.

       Authorization  data  required by the above protocols is passed to the server in a private file named with
       the <b>-auth</b> command line option.  Each time the server is about to accept  the  first  connection  after  a
       reset  (or  when  the  server  is starting), it reads this file.  If this file contains any authorization
       records, the local host is not automatically allowed access to the server, and only  clients  which  send
       one  of  the  authorization  records  contained  in  the file in the connection setup information will be
       allowed access.  See the <u>Xau</u> manual page for a description of  the  binary  format  of  this  file.   See
       <u><a href="../man1/xauth.1.html">xauth</a></u>(1) for maintenance of this file, and distribution of its contents to remote hosts.

       The X server also uses a host-based access control list for deciding whether or not to accept connections
       from  clients  on  a  particular  machine.   If no other authorization mechanism is being used, this list
       initially consists of the host on which the server is running as well as any machines listed in the  file
       <u>/etc/X</u><b>n</b><u>.hosts</u>,  where <b>n</b> is the display number of the server.  Each line of the file should contain either
       an Internet hostname (e.g. expo.lcs.mit.edu) or a complete name in the format <u>family</u>:<u>name</u> as described in
       the <u><a href="../man1/xhost.1.html">xhost</a></u>(1) manual page.  There should be no leading or trailing spaces on any lines.  For example:

               joesworkstation
               corporate.company.com
               inet:bigcpu
               local:

       Users can add or remove hosts from this list and enable or disable access control using the <u>xhost</u> command
       from the same machine as the server.

       If the X FireWall Proxy (<u>xfwp</u>) is being used without  a  sitepolicy,  host-based  authorization  must  be
       turned  on  for  clients  to  be  able to connect to the X server via the <u>xfwp</u>.  If <u>xfwp</u> is run without a
       configuration file and thus no sitepolicy is defined, if <u>xfwp</u> is using an X server where xhost + has been
       run to turn off host-based authorization checks, when a client tries to connect  to  this  X  server  via
       <u>xfwp</u>, the X server will deny the connection.  See <u><a href="../man1/xfwp.1.html">xfwp</a></u>(1) for more information about this proxy.

       The  X  protocol  intrinsically  does  not  have  any notion of window operation permissions or place any
       restrictions on what a client can do; if a program can connect to a display,  it  has  full  run  of  the
       screen.   X  servers  that  support  the SECURITY extension fare better because clients can be designated
       untrusted via the authorization  they  use  to  connect;  see  the  <u><a href="../man1/xauth.1.html">xauth</a></u>(1)  manual  page  for  details.
       Restrictions  are  imposed  on untrusted clients that curtail the mischief they can do.  See the SECURITY
       extension specification for a complete list of these restrictions.

       Sites that have better authentication and authorization systems might wish to make use of  the  hooks  in
       the libraries and the server to provide additional security models.

</pre><h4><b>SIGNALS</b></h4><pre>
       The X server attaches special meaning to the following signals:

       <u>SIGHUP</u>  This  signal causes the server to close all existing connections, free all resources, and restore
               all defaults.  It is sent by the display  manager  whenever  the  main  user's  main  application
               (usually  an  <u>xterm</u>  or window manager) exits to force the server to clean up and prepare for the
               next user.

       <u>SIGTERM</u> This signal causes the server to exit cleanly.

       <u>SIGUSR1</u> This signal is used quite differently from either of the  above.   When  the  server  starts,  it
               checks to see if it has inherited SIGUSR1 as SIG_IGN instead of the usual SIG_DFL.  In this case,
               the  server  sends  a  SIGUSR1  to  its parent process after it has set up the various connection
               schemes.  <u>Xdm</u> uses this feature to recognize when connecting to the server is possible.

</pre><h4><b>FONTS</b></h4><pre>
       The X server can obtain fonts from directories and/or from font servers.  The  list  of  directories  and
       font servers the X server uses when trying to open a font is controlled by the <u>font</u> <u>path</u>.

       The                      default                     font                     path                     is
       /usr/share/fonts/X11/misc,/usr/share/fonts/X11/cyrillic,/usr/share/fonts/X11/100dpi/:unscaled,/usr/share/fonts/X11/75dpi/:unscaled,/usr/share/fonts/X11/Type1,/usr/share/fonts/X11/100dpi,/usr/share/fonts/X11/75dpi,built-
       ins .

       A special kind of directory can be specified using the <b>catalogue</b>: prefix. Directories specified this  way
       can contain symlinks pointing to the real font directories. See the FONTPATH.D section for details.

       The font path can be set with the <b>-fp</b> option or by <u><a href="../man1/xset.1.html">xset</a></u>(1) after the server has started.

</pre><h4><b>FONTPATH.D</b></h4><pre>
       You  can  specify a special kind of font path in the form <b>catalogue:&lt;dir&gt;</b>.  The directory specified after
       the catalogue: prefix will be scanned for symlinks and each symlink destination will be added as a  local
       fontfile FPE.

       The  symlink  can  be  suffixed  by  attributes  such  as '<b>unscaled</b>', which will be passed through to the
       underlying fontfile FPE. The only exception is the newly introduced '<b>pri</b>' attribute, which will  be  used
       for ordering the font paths specified by the symlinks.

       An example configuration:

           75dpi:unscaled:pri=20 -&gt; /usr/share/X11/fonts/75dpi
           ghostscript:pri=60 -&gt; /usr/share/fonts/default/ghostscript
           misc:unscaled:pri=10 -&gt; /usr/share/X11/fonts/misc
           type1:pri=40 -&gt; /usr/share/X11/fonts/Type1
           type1:pri=50 -&gt; /usr/share/fonts/default/Type1

       This  will  add /usr/share/X11/fonts/misc as the first FPE with the attribute 'unscaled', second FPE will
       be /usr/share/X11/fonts/75dpi, also with the attribute 'unscaled' etc. This is functionally equivalent to
       setting the following font path:

           /usr/share/X11/fonts/misc:unscaled,
           /usr/share/X11/fonts/75dpi:unscaled,
           /usr/share/X11/fonts/Type1,
           /usr/share/fonts/default/Type1,
           /usr/share/fonts/default/ghostscript

</pre><h4><b>AUTHORS</b></h4><pre>
       The  sample  server was originally written by Susan Angebranndt, Raymond Drewry, Philip Karlton, and Todd
       Newman, from Digital Equipment  Corporation,  with  support  from  a  large  cast.   It  has  since  been
       extensively  rewritten  by Keith Packard and Bob Scheifler, from MIT.  Dave Wiggins took over post-R5 and
       made substantial improvements.
