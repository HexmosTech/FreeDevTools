       vos_status - Reports a Volume Server's status

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>vos</b> <b>status</b> <b>-server</b> &lt;<u>machine</u> <u>name</u>&gt;
           [<b>-cell</b> &lt;<u>cell</u> <u>name</u>&gt;]
           [<b>-noauth</b>] [<b>-localauth</b>]
           [<b>-verbose</b>] [<b>-encrypt</b>] [<b>-noresolve</b>]
           [<b>-config</b> &lt;<u>config</u> <u>directory</u>&gt;]
           [<b>-help</b>]

       <b>vos</b> <b>st</b> <b>-s</b> &lt;<u>machine</u> <u>name</u>&gt;
           [<b>-c</b> &lt;<u>cell</u> <u>name</u>&gt;]
           [<b>-noa</b>] [<b>-l</b>] [<b>-v</b>] [<b>-e</b>] [<b>-nor</b>]
           [<b>-co</b> &lt;<u>config</u> <u>directory</u>&gt;]
           [<b>-h</b>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>vos</b> <b>status</b> command reports on what the Volume Server on a certain file server machine is doing at the
       moment the command is issued. If there is no activity, the following message appears:

          No active transactions on &lt;machine_name&gt;

       This command is useful mainly if there is concern that the Volume Server is not performing requested
       actions.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-server</b> &lt;<u>server</u> <u>name</u>&gt;
           Identifies the file server machine running the Volume Server for which to display status information.
           Provide  the  machine's  IP  address or its host name (either fully qualified or using an unambiguous
           abbreviation). For details, see <b><a href="../man1/vos.1.html">vos</a></b>(1).

       <b>-cell</b> &lt;<u>cell</u> <u>name</u>&gt;
           Names the cell in which to run the command. Do not combine this argument with  the  <b>-localauth</b>  flag.
           For more details, see <b><a href="../man1/vos.1.html">vos</a></b>(1).

       <b>-noauth</b>
           Assigns  the  unprivileged  identity  "anonymous"  to  the  issuer. Do not combine this flag with the
           <b>-localauth</b> flag. For more details, see <b><a href="../man1/vos.1.html">vos</a></b>(1).

       <b>-localauth</b>
           Constructs a server ticket using a key from  the  local  <u>/etc/openafs/server/KeyFile</u>  file.  The  <b>vos</b>
           command  interpreter  presents  it  to  the  Volume  Server  and Volume Location Server during mutual
           authentication. Do not combine this flag with the <b>-cell</b> argument or <b>-noauth</b> flag. For  more  details,
           see <b><a href="../man1/vos.1.html">vos</a></b>(1).

       <b>-verbose</b>
           Produces  on the standard output stream a detailed trace of the command's execution. If this argument
           is omitted, only warnings and error messages appear.

       <b>-encrypt</b>
           Encrypts the command so that the operation's results are not transmitted across the network in  clear
           text. This option is available in OpenAFS versions 1.4.11 or later and 1.5.60 or later.

       <b>-noresolve</b>
           Shows  all  servers  as  IP  addresses  instead  of the DNS name. This is very useful when the server
           address is registered as 127.0.0.1 or when dealing with multi-homed servers. This option is available
           in OpenAFS versions 1.4.8 or later and 1.5.35 or later.

       <b>-config</b> &lt;<u>configuration</u> <u>directory</u>&gt;
           Set the location of the configuration directory to be used. This defaults to <u>/etc/openafs</u>, except  if
           <b>-localauth</b> is specified, in which case the default is <u>/etc/openafs/server</u>. This option allows the use
           of alternative configuration locations for testing purposes.

       <b>-help</b>
           Prints the online help for this command. All other valid options are ignored.

</pre><h4><b>OUTPUT</b></h4><pre>
       There are two possible types of output.

       The following message indicates that the Volume Server is not currently performing any actions.

          No active transactions on I&lt;machine name&gt;

       The  other  possible  output is a set of information which is probably more useful to programmers than to
       system administrators. A full understanding of all the fields requires familiarity with the code for  the
       Volume  Server,  as  many of the fields report ID numbers and flag values that the Volume Server sets for
       internal use.

       Among the fields of possible interest to an administrator are:

       •   "created" on the first line, which indicates the time at which this transaction started

       •   In OpenAFS 1.5.75 and later, "lastActiveTime" on the second line, which indicates the  last  time  an
           RPC interacted with this transaction

       •   "attachFlags"  on  the  third  line,  where  a  value  of  "offline" indicates that the volume is not
           available for other read or write operations during this transaction

       •   "volume" on the fourth line, which specifies the affected volume's ID number

       •   "partition" on the fourth line, which indicates where the affected volume resides (at  the  beginning
           of the transaction if this is a move)

       •   "procedure" on the fourth line, which indicates the internal subprocedure being executed

       A fifth line can appear during certain transactions, and includes the following fields:

       •   "packetRead"  tracks  whether  information  is  being read into the volume. Its absolute value is not
           informative, but the way it changes shows whether the <b>vos</b> <b>restore</b> command is executing properly.   As
           the  <b>vos</b>  <b>status</b> command is issued repeatedly during a restore, "readNext" increases monotonically to
           indicate that information is being read into the volume.

       •   "packetSend" tracks whether information is being sent out of the volume. Its absolute  value  is  not
           informative,  but the way it changes shows whether the <b>vos</b> <b>dump</b> command is executing properly. As the
           <b>vos</b> <b>status</b> command is issued repeatedly during a  dump,  "transmitNext"  increases  monotonically  to
           indicate that information is being transferred from the volume into the dump file.

       The "lastReceiveTime" and "lastSendTime" are for internal use.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       The  following  example  illustrates  the kind of output that sometimes appears when the Volume Server on
       "fs1.example.com" is executing a dump at the time this command is issued.

          % vos status fs1.example.com
          --------------------------------------------
          transaction: 575  created: Tue Jan 2 8:34:56 1990
          attachFlags: offline
          volume: 536871080 partition: /vicepb procedure: Dump
          packetRead: 2 lastReceiveTime: 113313 packetSend: 24588
              lastSendTime: 113317
