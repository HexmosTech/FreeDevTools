</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       nasd - Network Audio System server

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>nasd</b> [:listen port offset] [-option ...]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>nasd</u>  is  the generic name for the Network Audio System server.  It is frequently a link or a copy of the
       appropriate server binary for driving the most frequently used server on a given machine.

</pre><h4><b>STARTING</b> <b>THE</b> <b>SERVER</b></h4><pre>
       The server is usually started from /etc/rc or a user's startup script.

       When the Network Audio System server starts up, it takes over /dev/audio.  Note, that if ReleaseDevice is
       set to TRUE [default] in the nasd.conf file, nasd will relinquish control of the audio device whenever it
       has finished playing a sound.  This means you can use other non-NAS applications when nasd is running, as
       long as nasd isn't currently playing a song.  If ReleaseDevice is set to FALSE  in  the  nasd.conf  file,
       applications that attempt to access /dev/audio themselves will fail while nasd is running.

</pre><h4><b>NETWORK</b> <b>CONNECTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The Network Audio System server supports connections made using the following reliable byte-streams:

       <u>TCPIP</u>
           The server listens on port 8000+<u>n</u>, where <u>n</u> is the listen port offset.

       <u>Unix</u> <u>Domain</u>
           The X server uses <u>/tmp/.sockets/audio</u><b>n</b> as the filename for the socket, where <u>n</u> is the display number.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       All  of  the  Network  Audio  System  servers accept the following generic command line options.  Options
       specific to a particular server may also be available, and are not listed here.  Try 'nasd -?' for a list
       of those options, if available.

       <b>-aa</b>     Allows any client to connect.  By default, access is allowed only to authenticated clients.

       <b>-local</b>  Allows only clients on the local host to connect.  By default, access is  allowed  to  local  and
               remote hosts.

       <b>-v</b>      Enable verbose messages.  This option overrides the nasd.conf file setting.

       <b>-V</b>      Print version information and exit (ignoring other options).

       <b>-b</b>      Fork  a  child  to  run  in  the  background and exit (daemon mode).  Messages are sent to syslog
               instead of stderr.

       <b>-d</b> <u>n</u>    Enable debugging output at level <u>n</u>, where <u>n</u> is a positive integer.  The  higher  the  level,  the
               more  output  you  will  get.   A  value  of  0 [default] disables debugging output.  This option
               overrides the nasd.conf file setting.

       <b>-pn</b>

       <b>-nopn</b> <b>[default]</b>
               Enables or disables Partial Networking.  Enabling Partial Networking allows the server to  start,
               even  if  the  server  cannot  establish  all  of  its  well-known sockets (connection points for
               clients), but establishes at least one.

       <b>-config</b> <u>file</u>
               Use the config file <u>file</u>, instead of the default (/etc/nasd/nasd.conf).

</pre><h4><b>SIGNALS</b></h4><pre>
       The Network Audio System server attaches special meaning to the following signals:

       <u>SIGHUP</u>  This signal causes the server to close all existing connections, free all resources, and  restore
               all defaults.

       <u>SIGTERM</u> This signal causes the server to exit cleanly.

       <u>SIGUSR1</u> This  signal  is  used  quite  differently  from either of the above.  When the server starts, it
               checks to see if it has inherited SIGUSR1 as SIG_IGN instead of the usual SIG_DFL.  In this case,
               the server sends a SIGUSR1 to its parent process after it  has  set  up  the  various  connection
               schemes.

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       Too numerous to list them all.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       /tmp/.sockets/audio*          Unix domain socket

       /usr/adm/audio*msgs

       /dev/audio                    Audio device

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       If  <u>au</u>  dies before its clients, new clients won't be able to connect until all existing connections have
       their TCP TIME_WAIT timers expire.

       The current access control support is weak at best.

       The Network Audio System server was originally written by Greg Renda and Dave Lemke, with  large  amounts
       of code borrowed from the sample X server.

       The sample X server was originally written by Susan Angebranndt, Raymond Drewry, Philip Karlton, and Todd
       Newman,  from  Digital  Equipment  Corporation,  with  support  from  a  large  cast.   It has since been
       extensively rewritten by Keith Packard and Bob Scheifler, from MIT.
