</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--exclude</b>
           Specify  the name of an exclude file. Before WebDeploy scans a directory for files to upload, it will
           read the exclude file.  Any directories listed in the exclude file will not  be  scanned,  any  other
           file in the directory that are listed in the exclude file will not be uploaded.  This happens in each
           directory  that  is  scanned. An exclude file is uniqe to the directory.  All exclude files must have
           the same name however. By default, WebDeploy looks for a file called '.exclude'. If the file  doesn't
           exist then nothing will be excluded.  See exclude files section below for more details.

       <b>--globalexclude</b>
           This  is  much  the same as the normal exclude file.  The difference is that this file is only looked
           for in the root directory (where you ran webdeploy) and all exclusions in this file  are  applied  to
           every directory scanned.  See exclude files section below for more details.

       <b>--server-root</b>
           This specifies the root directory on the server that will be used for upload.  Any files in your root
           working  direct when you run webdeploy will be uploaded to this folder.  If you set this option, make
           sure you specify a directory without a trailing slash.

           For example, if you want your files uploaded to '<a href="file:/var/www/">/var/www/</a>'  on  the  server,  then  use  the  option
           '--server-root <a href="file:/var/www">/var/www</a>'

       <b>--dry-run</b>
           Print  the  list  of  local  files  that will be checked for upload, exit without uploading.  This is
           useful for checking that you have set up the exclude files correctly.

       <b>--ftp-dry-run</b>
           Log in to the FTP server to check which local files are new or  out  of  date  on  the  server,  exit
           without  uploading.   This  is  useful for checking which files you have updated or created since the
           last deploy.  This also shows the directory on the server that will be used as the root directory for
           upload.  The root directory can be set with --server-root

       Note that all options can be specified using any unique abbreviation.  (--conf is the same  as  --config,
       however --ser is invalid because it is the start of --server and --server-root)

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>WebDeploy</b>  will  upload files from the current local directory to an FTP server.  Files are only uploaded
       if the local version is newer than the server version.  Files can be excluded  using  the  'exclude'  and
       'globalexclue' options.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIG</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       By  default, WebDeploy will look for a file called .webdeploy_conf in the current directory. If this file
       is found then it will load the options from this file.  You can specify a different config  file  on  the
       command line using the --config option.

       All  of  the  options  that  are  available  on  the command line (except for the --config option) can be
       specified in a config file.

       A config file must consist only of blank lines, comment lines (that start with a '#' symbol)  and  option
       lines  (which  are  key-value-pairs).  Option lines take the form of 'KEY = VALUE'.  All characters after
       the first equals sign (sans leading and trailing blanks) are considered to be part of the value.  A value
       can therefore contain an equals sign without any special escaping.

       Note that no warnings will be issued if an option is specified on both the command line  and  the  config
       file. In this case, the config file has priority.

       Also  note  that  option  names  (keys)  in  configuration  files cannot be abbreviated like command line
       options.

       Here is an example configuration file:

           # Server connection details
           server = ftp.example.com
           port   = 1234

           # Login user name
           user = daniel

           # Server's public html folder
           server-root = var/www

</pre><h4><b>EXCLUDE</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       An exclude file will consist only of blank lines, comment lines  (that  start  with  a  '#'  symbol)  and
       patterns to match files to exclude.

       To exclude a file called 'foo' you could use a config file like this:

           # Exclude the file 'foo'
           foo

       To exclude all files that end with '.foo' you can use a wildcard pattern like this:

           # Exclude all files with the foo extension.
           *.foo

       You can also match against a class of characters:

           # Exclude a.foo and b.foo but not c.foo
           [ab].foo

       To exclude a directory, simply name the directory without any leading or trailing slashes:

           # Exclude the 'src' directory
           src

       Gotcha: a directory could match a pattern you intended to only apply to regular files

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Upload files via a plain ftp connection to ftp.example.com, port 1234 as user '<a href="mailto:user@example.com">user@example.com</a>'

           webdeploy --server=ftp.example.com --user=<a href="mailto:user@example.com">user@example.com</a> --port=1234 --no-tls

       See   which   files  need  uploading  (have  changed  since  the  last  upload)  using  the  settings  in
       'my_config.conf'

           webdeploy --config my_config.conf --ftp-dry-run

       See what files will be uploaded (perhaps to test a .exclude rule)

           webdeploy --dry-run

</pre><h4><b>LIMITATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       WebDeploy currently doesn't support SFTP (FTP via SSH)

       WebDeploy can only be used for uploading content in the current directory. It is not possible  to  upload
       content from a different directory without first changing to that directory.
