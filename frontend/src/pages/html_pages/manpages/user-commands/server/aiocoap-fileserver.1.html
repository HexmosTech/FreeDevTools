       usage: aiocoap-fileserver [-h] [--version] [-v] [--register [RD-URI]]

       A  simple  file  server  that serves the contents of a given directory in a readonly fashion via CoAP. It
       provides directory listings, and guesses the media type of files it serves. It  follows  the  conventions
       set  out  for the [kitchensink fileserver], optionally with write support, with some caveats: * There are
       some time-of-check / time-of-use race conditions around the handling of ETags, which could probably  only
       be  resolved if heavy file system locking were used. Some of these races are a consequence of this server
       implementing atomic writes through renames. As long as no other processes access the  working  area,  and
       aiocoap  is  run  single threaded, the races should not be visible to CoAP users. * ETags are constructed
       based on information in the file's (or directory's) `stat` output <b>--</b> this avoids reaing the whole file on
       overwrites etc. This means that forcing the MTime to stay constant across a change would confuse clients.
       * While GET requests on files are served block by block (reading  only  what  is  being  requested),  PUT
       operations are spooled in memory rather than on the file system. * Directory creation and deletion is not
       supported            at            the            moment.            [kitchen-sink           fileserver]:
