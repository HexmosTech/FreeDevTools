</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       directvnc - a vnc client for the linux framebuffer device

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       directvnc server:display [options]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>DirectVNC</b> is a client implementing the remote framebuffer protocol (rfb) which is used by VNC servers. If
       a VNC server is running on a machine you can connect to it using this client and have the contents of its
       display  shown  on  your  screen.  Keyboard and mouse events are sent to the server, so you can basically
       control a VNC server remotely. There are servers (and other clients) freely available for  all  operating
       systems.

       What  makes  DirectVNC different from other unix vnc clients is that it uses the linux framebuffer device
       through the DirectFB library which enables it to run on anything that has a framebuffer without the  need
       for  a  running  X  server.  This includes embedded devices.  DirectFB even uses acceleration features of
       certain graphics cards. Thus a lot of  configuration  can  be  done  by  creating  the  library  specific
       configuration  file /etc/directfbrc or the program-specific configuration file /etc/directfbrc.directvnc.
       See <a href="../man5/directfbrc.5.html">directfbrc</a>(5) or find out all about DirectFB here:

           www.directfb.org

       DirectVNC basically provides a very thin VNC client for unix framebuffer systems.

</pre><h4><b>QUITTING</b></h4><pre>
       Hitting &lt;ctrl-q&gt; exits the viewer.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-h,</b> <b>--help</b>
            display help output and exit

       <b>-v,</b> <b>--version</b>
            output version information and exit

       <b>-p,</b> <b>--password</b>
            password string to be passed to the server for authentication. Use this with care!

       <b>-b,</b> <b>--bpp</b>
            the bits per pixel to be used by the client. Currently only 16 and 24 bpp are available.

       <b>-e</b> <b>--encodings</b>
            DirectVNC supports several different compression methods  to  encode  screen  updates;  this  option
            specifies  a  set  of  them  to  use  in order of preference. Encodings are specified separated with
            spaces, and must thus be enclosed in quotes if more than one is specified. Available  encodings,  in
            default  order for a remote connection, are "copyrect tight hextile zlib corre rre raw". For a local
            connection (to the same machine), the default order to try is "raw copyrect tight hextile zlib corre
            rre". Raw encoding is always assumed as a last option if no other encoding  can  be  used  for  some
            reason.

       <b>-f</b> <b>--pollfrequency</b>
            time in ms to wait between polls for screen updates when no events are to be processed. This reduces
            cpu and network load. Default is 50 ms.

       <b>-s,</b> <b>--shared</b> <b>(default)</b>
            Don't disconnect already connected clients.

       <b>-n,</b> <b>--noshared</b>
            Disconnect already connected clients.

       <b>-n,</b> <b>--nolocalcursor</b>
            Disable  local  cursor tracking By default, and if the server is capable of the SoftCursor encoding,
            mouse movements do not generate framebuffer updates and the  cursor  state  is  kept  locally.  This
            removes mouse pointer lag and lets the connection appear faster.

       <b>-c</b> <b>--compresslevel</b> <b>level</b>
            Use  specified  compression  level (0..9) for "tight" and "zlib" encodings (only usable with servers
            capable of those encodings).  Level 1 uses minimum of CPU time and achieves weak compression ratios,
            while level 9 offers best compression but is slow in terms of CPU time  consumption  on  the  server
            side.  Use  high  levels  with  very  slow  network  connections,  and  low levels when working over
            high-speed LANs. It's not recommended to use compression level 0, reasonable choices start from  the
            level 1.

       <b>-q</b> <b>--quality</b> <b>level</b>
            Use  the specified image quality level (0..9) for "tight" encoding (only usable with servers capable
            of those encodings).  Specifying this option allows "tight" encoder to use lossy  JPEG  compression.
            Quality  level  0  denotes  bad  image quality but very impressive compression ratios, while level 9
            offers very good image quality at lower compression ratios. Note that "tight" encoder uses  JPEG  to
            encode only those screen areas that look suitable for lossy compression, so quality level 0 does not
            always mean unacceptable image quality.

       <b>-m</b> <b>--modmap</b> <b>PATH</b>
            Path  to  the  modmap  (subset  of X-style) file to load. With this option, it is possible to set an
            alternative keyboard layout, with ability to support non-latin characters such as Cyrillic. A  plain
            text file, containing a subset of <a href="../man1/xmodmap.1.html">xmodmap</a>(1) syntax (only keycode expressions are recognized with up
            to  four KEYSYMNAMEs) can be converted into the format that directvnc understands, and can be loaded
            upon directvnc startup with this option. See <a href="../man7/directvnc-kbmapping.7.html">directvnc-kbmapping</a>(7).

</pre><h4><b>LIMITATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       At the moment, it is still necessary to use the --bpp command  line  option  to  set  color  depth.  When
       negotiating  with  the  remote  VNC  server  side, color depth supplied by the server will be used. It is
       therefore necessary to make sure (at least in the present) that screen color depth (default,  or  set  in
       the  DirectFB  configuration file), color depth supplied at the command line, and remote VNC server color
       depth all match.
