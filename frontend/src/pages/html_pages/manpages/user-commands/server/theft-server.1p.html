       theft-server - CLC-INTERCAL networking

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>theft-server</b> --port=<u>port</u> [options]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>theft-server</b> mediates the communication between two CLC-INTERCAL programs with the <u>internet</u>
       extension. It keeps a list of process IDs running on the current computer so it can provide lists of
       processes which can be engaged in INTERcal NETworking; it also responds to broadcasts allowing other CLC-
       INTERCAL programs on the LAN to know there is something happening on this computer.

       Under normal conditions, the <b>theft-server</b> is started automatically by a CLC-INTERCAL programs with the
       <u>internet</u> extension (unless one is already running, of course!) because the extension cannot operate
       without a server on the local computer. However, it is possible to start one manually, for example from a
       <u><a href="file:/etc/init.d">/etc/init.d</a></u> or <u>/etc/rc.d</u>.

       If the program is started automatically, it uses defaults for all its configuration; when started
       manually, it accepts the following options:

       <b>-p</b><u>port</u> / <b>--port</b>=<u>port</u>
           Uses  the  given  <u>port</u>  (number or service name) for communications, instead of using the default one
           from a configuration file.

       <b>-l</b><u>seconds</u> / <b>--linger</b>=<u>seconds</u>
           Waits the specified time for a connection, then exit.  The  default  is  15  (seconds).  The  timeout
           applies  when  the  program starts and also when all existing connections are closed. This allows the
           program to be started on demand by CLC-INTERCAL programs, and to automatically exit  when  no  longer
           required (unless more programs start up during the timeout).

           This function is disabled by setting the timeout to 0 (i.e. <b>-l</b><u>0</u>); for example, if starting the server
           from <u><a href="file:/etc/init.d">/etc/init.d</a></u> or equivalent one would disable the timeout.

       <b>-d</b> / <b>--debug</b>
           Tells  everything  it's doing (on Standard Error). Also, prevents the program from detaching from the
           current terminal and going into the background.
