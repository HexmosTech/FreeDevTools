</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       <u>rdesktop</u> - Remote Desktop Protocol client

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>rdesktop</b> <b>[options]</b> <b>server[:port]</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>rdesktop</u>  is  a  client for Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), used in a number of Microsoft products.  It is
       known to work with Microsoft Windows server versions ranging from NT 4 terminal server to Windows  Server
       2012 R2.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-u</b> <b>&lt;username&gt;</b>
              Username for authentication on the server.

       <b>-d</b> <b>&lt;domain&gt;</b>
              Domain for authentication.

       <b>-s</b> <b>&lt;shell&gt;</b>
              Startup  shell for the user - starts a specific application instead of Explore.  If SeamlessRDP is
              enabled this is the application which is started in seamless mode.

       <b>-c</b> <b>&lt;directory&gt;</b>
              The initial working directory for the user.  Often used in combination with -s to set up  a  fixed
              login environment.

       <b>-p</b> <b>&lt;password&gt;</b>
              The  password  to  authenticate  with.   Note  that  this may have no effect if "Always prompt for
              password" is enabled on the server.  WARNING: if you specify a password on the command line it may
              be visible to other users when they use tools like ps.  Use  -p  -  to  make  rdesktop  request  a
              password at startup (from standard input).

       <b>-n</b> <b>&lt;hostname&gt;</b>
              Client hostname.  Normally rdesktop automatically obtains the hostname of the client.

       <b>-k</b> <b>&lt;keyboard-map&gt;</b>
              Keyboard  layout  to  emulate.   This  requires  a corresponding keymap file to be installed.  The
              standard keymaps provided with rdesktop follow the RFC1766 naming scheme: a language code followed
              by a country code if necessary - e.g.  en-us, en-gb, de, fr, sv, etc.

              The default keyboard map depends on the current locale (LC_* and LANG environment  variables).  If
              the current locale is unknown, the default keyboard map is en-us (a US English keyboard).

              The  keyboard  maps are file names, which means that they are case sensitive. The standard keymaps
              are all in lowercase.

              The keyboard maps are searched relative to the  directories  $HOME/.rdesktop/keymaps,  KEYMAP_PATH
              (specified  at build time), and $CWD/keymaps, in this order. The keyboard-map argument can also be
              an absolute filename.

              The special value `none' can be used instead of a keyboard map.  In this case, rdesktop will guess
              the scancodes from the X11 event key codes using an internal  mapping  method.  This  method  only
              supports  the  basic  alphanumeric  keys  and may not work properly on all platforms so its use is
              discouraged.

       <b>-g</b> <b>&lt;geometry&gt;</b>
              Desktop geometry (WxH[@DPI][+X[+Y]]). If geometry is the special  word  "workarea",  the  geometry
              will  be  fetched  from  the  extended  window manager hints property _NET_WORKAREA, from the root
              window. The geometry can also be specified as a percentage of the whole screen, e.g. "-g 80%", "-g
              80%x70%".

              If the specified geometry depends on the screen size, and the screen  size  is  changed,  rdesktop
              will  automatically  reconnect  using  the  new  screen size. This requires that rdesktop has been
              compiled with RandR support.

              The optional DPI parameter should be specified if the screen rdesktop is being displayed on is too
              far from 96 DPI for unscaled Windows to be readable. Windows currently accepts values from  96  to
              480.

              Offset  placement  of  window  is optional. Starting point is upper left corner of screen.  Window
              manager might push  into  visible  area,  if  a  panel  would  be  covered.   The  schema  is  "-g
              &lt;value&gt;+&lt;xoff&gt;+&lt;yoff&gt;, f.e. "-g 30%+200+600".

       <b>-i</b>     Use  password  as  smartcard  pin. If a valid user certificate is matched in smart card reader the
              password passed with p argument is used as pin for the smart card.   This  feature  also  requires
              that smart card redirection is used using r scard argument.

       <b>-f</b>     Enable fullscreen mode.  This overrides the window manager and causes the rdesktop window to fully
              cover the current screen.  Fullscreen mode can be toggled at any time using Ctrl-Alt-Enter.

       <b>-b</b>     Force  the  server  to  send  screen  updates  as  bitmaps  rather than using higher-level drawing
              operations.

       <b>-t</b>     Disable use of remote control. This will disable features like seamless connection sharing.

       <b>-A</b> <b>&lt;seamlessrdpshell&gt;</b>
              Enable SeamlessRDP by specifying the path to seamless rdp shell.  In this mode, rdesktop creates a
              X11 window for each window on the server side.  This mode requires  the  SeamlessRDP  server  side
              component, which is available from <u><a href="http://www.cendio.com/seamlessrdp/">http://www.cendio.com/seamlessrdp/</a></u>.

              When  using  this  option,  you should normally specify a startup shell which launches the desired
              application through SeamlessRDP.

              Example: rdesktop -A 'c:\seamlessrdp\seamlessrdpshell.exe' -s 'notepad' mywts.domain.com

              Any subsequential call to the above command line example will make use of the seamless  connection
              sharing feature which spawns another notepad in the current connection to the specified server and
              then exit.

       <b>-V</b> <b>&lt;tls</b> <b>version&gt;</b>
              Set the Transport Level Security (also known as SSL) Version used.  Should be one of the following
              values: 1.0, 1.1, 1.2. By default all versions are supported.

       <b>-B</b>     Use the BackingStore of the Xserver instead of the integrated one in rdesktop.

       <b>-e</b>     Disable  encryption.  This option is only needed (and will only work) if you have a French version
              of NT TSE.

       <b>-E</b>     Disable encryption from client to server.  This sends an encrypted login  packet,  but  everything
              after this is unencrypted (including interactive logins).

       <b>-m</b>     Do  not  send  mouse  motion events.  This saves bandwidth, although some Windows applications may
              rely on receiving mouse motion.

       <b>-M</b>     Use local X cursor inherited from window manager instead of server cursor. This is  mostly  useful
              with -m, but is also useful if the server is sending bogus mouse cursors.

       <b>-C</b>     Use  private  colourmap.  This will improve colour accuracy on an 8-bit display, but rdesktop will
              appear in false colour when not focused.

       <b>-D</b>     Hide window manager decorations, by using MWM hints.

       <b>-K</b>     Do not override window manager key bindings.  By default rdesktop attempts to  grab  all  keyboard
              input when it is in focus.

       <b>-S</b> <b>&lt;button</b> <b>size&gt;</b>
              Enable  single  application  mode.  This  option  can  be  used  when  running a single, maximized
              application (via -s). When the minimize button of the windows application is pressed, the rdesktop
              window is minimized instead of the remote application. The maximize/restore  button  is  disabled.
              For this to work, you must specify the correct button size, in pixels. The special word "standard"
              means 18 pixels.

       <b>-T</b> <b>&lt;title&gt;</b>
              Sets the window title. The title must be specified using an UTF-8 string.

       <b>-N</b>     Enable  numlock  synchronization  between  the Xserver and the remote RDP session.  This is useful
              with applications that looks at the numlock state, but might cause  problems  with  some  Xservers
              like Xvnc.

       <b>-X</b> <b>&lt;windowid&gt;</b>
              Embed  rdesktop-window  in  another  window. The windowid is expected to be decimal or hexadecimal
              (prefixed by 0x).

       <b>-a</b> <b>&lt;bpp&gt;</b>
              Sets the colour depth for the connection (8, 15, 16,  24  or  32).   More  than  8  bpp  are  only
              supported  when  connecting to Windows XP (up to 16 bpp) or newer.  Note that the colour depth may
              also be limited by the server configuration. The default value is the depth of the root window.

       <b>-z</b>     Enable compression of the RDP datastream.

       <b>-x</b> <b>&lt;experience&gt;</b>
              Changes default bandwidth performance behaviour for RDP5. By default only theming is enabled,  and
              all  other  options  are  disabled  (corresponding  to  modem  (56  Kbps)).  Setting experience to
              b[roadband] enables menu animations and full window dragging. Setting  experience  to  l[an]  will
              also  enable the desktop wallpaper. Setting experience to m[odem] disables all (including themes).
              Experience can also be a hexadecimal number containing the flags.

       <b>-P</b>     Enable caching of bitmaps to disk (persistent bitmap caching). This generally improves performance
              (especially on low bandwidth connections) and reduces network traffic  at  the  cost  of  slightly
              longer  startup  and some disk space.  (10MB for 8-bit colour, 20MB for 15/16-bit colour, 30MB for
              24-bit colour and 40MB for 32-bit colour sessions)

       <b>-r</b> <b>&lt;device&gt;</b>
              Enable redirection of the specified device on the client, such that it appears on the server. Note
              that the allowed redirections may be restricted by the server configuration.

              Following devices are currently supported:

       <b>-r</b> <b>comport:&lt;comport&gt;=&lt;device&gt;,...</b>
              Redirects serial devices on your client to the server.  Note  that  if  you  need  to  change  any
              settings on the serial device(s), do so with an appropriate tool before starting rdesktop. In most
              OSes you would use stty. Bidirectional/Read support requires Windows XP or newer.  In Windows 2000
              it will create a port, but it's not seamless, most shell programs will not work with it.

       <b>-r</b> <b>disk:&lt;sharename&gt;=&lt;path&gt;,...</b>
              Redirects a path to the share \\tsclient\&lt;sharename&gt; on the server (requires Windows XP or newer).
              The share name is limited to 8 characters.

       <b>-r</b> <b>lptport:&lt;lptport&gt;=&lt;device&gt;,...</b>
              Redirects  parallel  devices  on  your  client to the server.  Bidirectional/Read support requires
              Windows XP or newer. In Windows 2000 it will create a port, but  it's  not  seamless,  most  shell
              programs will not work with it.

       <b>-r</b> <b>printer:&lt;printername&gt;[=&lt;driver&gt;],...</b>
              Redirects  a printer queue on the client to the server. The &lt;printername&gt; is the name of the queue
              in your local system. &lt;driver&gt; defaults to a simple PS-driver unless you specify one. Keep in mind
              that you need a 100% match in the server environment, or the driver will fail. The  first  printer
              on the command line will be set as your default printer.

       <b>-r</b> <b>sound:[local|off|remote]</b>
              Redirects  sound  generated  on  the  server  to the client. "remote" only has any effect when you
              connect to the console with the -0 option. (Requires Windows XP or newer).

       <b>-r</b> <b>lspci</b>
              Activates the lspci channel, which allows the server to enumerate the clients PCI devices. See the
              file lspci-channel.txt in the documentation for more information.

       <b>-r</b> <b>scard[:&lt;Scard</b> <b>Name&gt;=&lt;Alias</b> <b>Name&gt;[;&lt;Vendor</b> <b>Name&gt;][,...]]</b>
              Enables redirection of one or more smart-cards.  You  can  provide  static  name  binding  between
              GNU/Linux  and  Windows.  To  do this you can use optional parameters as described: &lt;Scard Name&gt; -
              device name in GNU/Linux and UNIX environment,  &lt;Alias  Name&gt;  -  device  name  shown  in  Windows
              environment &lt;Vendor Name&gt; - optional device vendor name. For list of examples run rdesktop without
              parameters.

       <b>-r</b> <b>clipboard:[off|PRIMARYCLIPBOARD|CLIPBOARD]</b>
              Enable  clipboard redirection. 'PRIMARYCLIPBOARD' looks at both PRIMARY and CLIPBOARD when sending
              data to server. 'CLIPBOARD' looks at only 'CLIPBOARD'.

       <b>-0</b>     Attach to the console of the server (requires Windows Server 2003 or newer).

       <b>-4</b>     Use RDP version 4.

       <b>-5</b>     Use RDP version 5 (default).

       <b>-v</b>     Enable verbose output

</pre><h4><b>CredSSP</b> <b>Smartcard</b> <b>options</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--sc-csp-name</b> <b>&lt;name&gt;</b>
              Specify the CSP  (Crypto  Service  Provider)  to  use  on  the  windows  side  for  the  smartcard
              authentication.  CSP  is  the  driver  for your smartcard and it seems like this is required to be
              specified for CredSSP authentication. For Swedish NetID the following CSP name is used; "Net iD  -
              CSP".

       <b>--sc-container-name</b> <b>&lt;name&gt;</b>
              Specify  the  container name, usually this is the username for default container and it seems like
              this is required to be specified for CredSSP authentication.

       <b>--sc-reader-name</b> <b>&lt;name&gt;</b>
              Specify the reader name to be used to prevent the pin code being sent to wrong card if  there  are
              several readers.

       <b>--sc-card-name</b> <b>&lt;name&gt;</b>
              Specify the card name for example; "Telia EID IP5a".
