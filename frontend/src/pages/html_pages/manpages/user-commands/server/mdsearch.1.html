</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This tool is part of the <b><a href="../man1/samba.1.html">samba</a></b>(1) suite.

       mdsearch is a simple utility to run Spotlight searches against an SMB server that runs the Spotlight
       <u>mdssvc</u> RPC service.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       server
           The SMB server name or IP address to connect to.

       sharename
           The name of a share on the server.

       query
           The query expression syntax is a simplified form of filename globbing familiar to shell users.
           Queries have the following format:

           attribute=="value"

           For queries against a Samba server with Spotlight enabled using the Elasticsearch backend, the list
           of supported metadata attributes is given by the JSON attribute mapping file, typically installed at
           /usr/share/samba/mdssvc/elasticsearch_mappings.json

       -p PATH, --path=PATH
           Server side path to search, defaults to <u>"/"</u>

       -L, --live
           Query remains running.

       -?|--help
           Print a summary of command line options.

       --usage
           Display brief usage message.

       -d|--debuglevel=DEBUGLEVEL
           <u>level</u> is an integer from 0 to 10. The default value if this parameter is not specified is 1 for
           client applications.

           The higher this value, the more detail will be logged to the log files about the activities of the
           server. At level 0, only critical errors and serious warnings will be logged. Level 1 is a reasonable
           level for day-to-day running - it generates a small amount of information about operations carried
           out.

           Levels above 1 will generate considerable amounts of log data, and should only be used when
           investigating a problem. Levels above 3 are designed for use only by developers and generate HUGE
           amounts of log data, most of which is extremely cryptic.

           Note that specifying this parameter here will override the <b>log</b> <b>level</b> parameter in the
           /etc/samba/smb.conf file.

       --debug-stdout
           This will redirect debug output to STDOUT. By default all clients are logging to STDERR.

       --configfile=&lt;configuration file&gt;
           The file specified contains the configuration details required by the client. The information in this
           file can be general for client and server or only provide client specific like options such as <b>client</b>
           <b>smb</b> <b>encrypt</b>. See /etc/samba/smb.conf for more information. The default configuration file name is
           determined at compile time.

       --option=&lt;name&gt;=&lt;value&gt;
           Set the <b><a href="../man5/smb.conf.5.html">smb.conf</a></b>(5) option "&lt;name&gt;" to value "&lt;value&gt;" from the command line. This overrides
           compiled-in defaults and options read from the configuration file. If a name or a value includes a
           space, wrap whole --option=name=value into quotes.

       -l|--log-basename=logdirectory
           Base directory name for log/debug files. The extension <b>".progname"</b> will be appended (e.g.
           log.smbclient, log.smbd, etc...). The log file is never removed by the client.

       --leak-report
           Enable talloc leak reporting on exit.

       --leak-report-full
           Enable full talloc leak reporting on exit.

       -V|--version
           Prints the program version number.

       -U|--user=[DOMAIN\]USERNAME[%PASSWORD]
           Sets the SMB username or username and password.

           If %PASSWORD is not specified, the user will be prompted. The client will first check the <b>USER</b>
           environment variable (which is also permitted to also contain the password separated by a %), then
           the <b>LOGNAME</b> variable (which is not permitted to contain a password) and if either exists, the value
           is used. If these environmental variables are not found, the username found in a Kerberos Credentials
           cache may be used.

           A third option is to use a credentials file which contains the plaintext of the username and
           password. This option is mainly provided for scripts where the admin does not wish to pass the
           credentials on the command line or via environment variables. If this method is used, make certain
           that the permissions on the file restrict access from unwanted users. See the <u>-A</u> for more details.

           Be cautious about including passwords in scripts or passing user-supplied values onto the command
           line. For security it is better to let the Samba client tool ask for the password if needed, or
           obtain the password once with kinit.

           While Samba will attempt to scrub the password from the process title (as seen in ps), this is after
           startup and so is subject to a race.

       -N|--no-pass
           If specified, this parameter suppresses the normal password prompt from the client to the user. This
           is useful when accessing a service that does not require a password.

           Unless a password is specified on the command line or this parameter is specified, the client will
           request a password.

           If a password is specified on the command line and this option is also defined the password on the
           command line will be silently ignored and no password will be used.

       --password
           Specify the password on the commandline.

           Be cautious about including passwords in scripts or passing user-supplied values onto the command
           line. For security it is better to let the Samba client tool ask for the password if needed, or
           obtain the password once with kinit.

           If --password is not specified, the tool will check the <b>PASSWD</b> environment variable, followed by
           <b>PASSWD_FD</b> which is expected to contain an open file descriptor (FD) number.

           Finally it will check <b>PASSWD_FILE</b> (containing a file path to be opened). The file should only contain
           the password. Make certain that the permissions on the file restrict access from unwanted users!

           While Samba will attempt to scrub the password from the process title (as seen in ps), this is after
           startup and so is subject to a race.

       --pw-nt-hash
           The supplied password is the NT hash.

       -A|--authentication-file=filename
           This option allows you to specify a file from which to read the username and password used in the
           connection. The format of the file is:

                                   username = &lt;value&gt;
                                   password = &lt;value&gt;
                                   domain   = &lt;value&gt;

           Make certain that the permissions on the file restrict access from unwanted users!

       -P|--machine-pass
           Use stored machine account password.

       --simple-bind-dn=DN
           DN to use for a simple bind.

       --use-kerberos=desired|required|off
           This parameter determines whether Samba client tools will try to authenticate using Kerberos. For
           Kerberos authentication you need to use dns names instead of IP addresses when connecting to a
           service.

           Note that specifying this parameter here will override the <b>client</b> <b>use</b> <b>kerberos</b> parameter in the
           /etc/samba/smb.conf file.

       --use-krb5-ccache=CCACHE
           Specifies the credential cache location for Kerberos authentication.

           This will set --use-kerberos=required too.

       --use-winbind-ccache
           Try to use the credential cache by winbind.

       --client-protection=sign|encrypt|off
           Sets the connection protection the client tool should use.

           Note that specifying this parameter here will override the <b>client</b> <b>protection</b> parameter in the
           /etc/samba/smb.conf file.

           In case you need more fine grained control you can use: --option=clientsmbencrypt=OPTION,
           --option=clientipcsigning=OPTION, --option=clientsigning=OPTION.
