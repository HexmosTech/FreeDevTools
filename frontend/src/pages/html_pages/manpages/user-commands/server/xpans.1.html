</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The xpans name server is an XPA-enabled program that is used to manage the names and ports of XPA access
       points. It is started automatically when an XPA access point is registered. You can access the name
       server using xpaget to get a list of registered access points.

       The <u>xpans</u> name server provides a crucial link between XPA clients and servers.  When an XPA server
       defines an access point using <u>XPANew()</u>, <u>XPACmdNew()</u>, or <u>XPAInfoNew()</u>, the name of the access point is
       registered in the name service, along with connection information.  The name server then matches
       class:name templates passed to it by XPA clients with these registered entries, so that the clients can
       communicate with the appropriate servers.

       The socket connection between an XPA-enabled program and <u>xpans</u> is kept open until the former exits (or
       explicitly closes the connection). Apparently, some Internet equipment (e.g. DSL modems) can cause such a
       connection to time-out after a period of inactivity. To prevent this from happening, you can use the -k
       [sec] switch to send a short keep-alive message to each open connection after the specified time delay.
       (Note that this application level use of keep-alive is necessary only if you are serving XPA-enabled
       clients over the Internet and have to deal with long-term connections involving DSL or similar equipment.
       XPA uses the ordinary socket-level keep-alive, which works for all other cases.)  NB (12/2/2009): Out-of-
       band (URG) TCP data, used by xpans keep-alive, is changed by some Cisco routers into in-band data.
       Encountering such a router will break the keep-alive function and may break your XPA server as well.
       Proceed with caution!

       The <u>xpans</u> program will be started automatically (assuming it can be found in the user's path) when the
       first XPA access point is registered.  It therefore need not be started explicitly.  However, when
       started automatically, the <u>-e</u> switch is used, so that the name server will exit when there are no more
       XPA access points registered. If you wish to keep the name server running continually, simply start it
       manually without the <u>-e</u> switch.

       The name server will keep a log of registered access points if the <u>-l</u> <u>[log]</u> switch is used on the command
       line (this is the case for automatic start-up).  The log contains enough name and connection information
       to allow you to re-register all XPA access points in case the name server process is terminated
       prematurely. For example, after the ds9 access point is registered,the log will contain the entry:

         add 838e2f67:1863 ds9 ds9 gs eric

       If <u>xpans</u> is terminated but ds9 still is running, you can re-register both access points for the ds9
       process by running:

         xpaset -p 838e2f67:1863 -nsconnect

       Notice that the ip:port specifier is used with <u>xpaset</u> to bypass the need for contacting the name server
       (which does not have the name registered yet!)

       The name server will keep a log of security information if the -s [security log] switch is used on the
       command line. For each accepted connection, (including connections via the <u>xpaget</u> command), information
       will be logged about the host issuing the command and the parameters passed into the program. This is
       most useful when <u>xpans</u> is accepting connections from untrusted machines.

       When an XPA access point is removed by a server using <u>XPAFree()</u>, the access information is removed from
       the name server.  If an XPA-enabled process is terminated, all names registered by that process will be
       removed automatically.  The log file is always updated to reflect the currently registered access points.

       The name server itself has an XPA access point names <u>xpans</u> registered through which you can find out
       information about currently registered access points (assuming you have access to the name server; see
       XPA Access Control for more information).  For each registered access point, the following information is
       returned:

         class         # class of the access point
         name          # name of the access point
         access        # allowed access (g=xpaget,s=xpaset,i=xpainfo)
         id            # socket access method (host:port for inet, file for local/unix)
         user          # user name of access point owner

       For example, to display all currently registered access points, simply execute:

         xpaget xpans

       Continuing the example of ds9 above, this will return:

         DS9 ds9 gs 838e2f67:1863 eric

       If the same program has been started with different XPA access names, you can look up only names matching
       a specified template. For example, assume that ds9 has been started up using:

         ds9 &amp;
         ds9 -title ds9-1-eric &amp;
         ds9 -title ds9-2-eric &amp;

       To lookup all ds9 access points which end in ".eric" and which can be accessed using <u>xpaset</u>, use:

         xpaget xpans "DS9:*.eric" "s" "*"

       This will return:

         DS9 ds9-2-eric gs 838e29d3:42102 eric
         DS9 ds9-1-eric gs 838e29d3:42105 eric

       The third argument "*" requests all access points from all users.  You also can specify a specific user
       name and only access points registered by that user will be returned.

       The name server uses the <u>XPA_METHOD</u> environment variable to determine whether it should listen for
       requests on INET or LOCAL sockets.  Since XPA access points also use this environment variable, the
       choice of socket method will be consistent.  Note that, when INET sockets are used, a local server can be
       accessed from remote machines if the <u>XPA_NSINET</u> environment variable is set to point to the local
       machine.  See XPA Environment Variables for more information.

       An experimental feature of xpans is its ability to act as a proxy to XPA servers behind firewalls that
       want to communicate with external processes.  The basic idea is the following: an XPA server (call it
       "foo") on host1, possibly behind a firewall, makes a remote connection to a proxy-enabled xpans program
       on host2 (specifying host2's XPA method).  For example:

         xpaset -p foo -remote 'host2:28571' + -proxy   # on host1

       When this is done, host2 can use xpaset, xpaget, and xpainfo calls to communicate with the XPA server
       foo. All command communication is performed via the xpans socket connection between foo on host1 and
       xpans on host2 (which was initiated by foo from inside the firewall).  Data communication is similarly
       performed using a socket connection initiated on host1 (usually with a port value two greater than the
       port value of the main xpans socket connection). An xpaset or xpaget call on host2 contacts xpans, which
       performs an <u>XPASet()</u> or <u>XPAGet()</u> call to foo, passing commands and data back and forth between the two
       programs.

       By default, proxy connections are not allowed by xpans. If the -P switch is specified with a value of 1,
       proxy connection are allowed, but all proxy communication is performed in the same thread as xpans
       processing. If a value of 2 is specified, the proxy processing is performed in a separate thread
       (assuming pthreads are supported on your system).  Because xpa callback processing of any type can take a
       long time and therefore can interfere with normal xpans processing, threaded proxy connections (-P 2) are
       recommended.  When using proxy connections, it might also be useful to set the XPA_IOCALLSXPA environment
       variable, so that multiple proxy requests can be handled at the same time, instead of serially.

       Note that this proxy interface to xpans is experimental. It is used to provide remote data analysis
       capabilities on the Chandra-Ed system using ds9.  (See <a href="http://chandra-ed.cfa.harvard.edu">http://chandra-ed.cfa.harvard.edu</a> and
       <a href="http://hea-www.harvard.edu/saord/ds9">http://hea-www.harvard.edu/saord/ds9</a> for more details). As always, please contact us if you have problems
       or questions.
