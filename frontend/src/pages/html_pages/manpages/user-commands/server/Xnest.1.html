</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Xnest - a nested X server

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Xnest</b> [ <u>options</u> ]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Xnest</b>  is  both  an X client and an X server.  <b>Xnest</b> is a client of the real server which manages windows
       and graphics requests on its behalf.  <b>Xnest</b> is a server to its own clients.  <b>Xnest</b>  manages  windows  and
       graphics requests on their behalf.  To these clients, <b>Xnest</b> appears to be a conventional server.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Xnest</b>  supports  all  standard options of the sample server implementation.  For more details, please see
       <b><a href="../man1/Xserver.1.html">Xserver</a></b>(1).  The following additional arguments are supported as well.

       <b>-display</b> <u>string</u>
              This option specifies the display name of the real server that <b>Xnest</b> should try to connect to.  If
              it is not provided on the command line, <b>Xnest</b> will read the <u>DISPLAY</u> environment variable in  order
              to find out this information.

       <b>-sync</b>  This  option  tells  <b>Xnest</b> to synchronize its window and graphics operations with the real server.
              This is a useful option for debugging, but it will slow down <b>Xnest</b>'s performance considerably.  It
              should not be used unless absolutely necessary.

       <b>-full</b>  This option tells <b>Xnest</b> to utilize full regeneration of real  server  objects  and  reopen  a  new
              connection  to  the  real  server  each  time  the  nested  server regenerates.  The sample server
              implementation regenerates all objects  in  the  server  when  the  last  client  of  this  server
              terminates.   When this happens, <b>Xnest</b> by default maintains the same top-level window and the same
              real server connection in each new generation.  If the user selects full  regeneration,  even  the
              top-level  window  and  the  connection  to  the  real  server will be regenerated for each server
              generation.

       <b>-class</b> <u>string</u>
              This option specifies the default visual class of the nested server.  It is  similar  to  the  <b>-cc</b>
              option  from  the set of standard options except that it will accept a string rather than a number
              for the visual class specification.   The  <u>string</u>  must  be  one  of  the  following  six  values:
              <b>StaticGray</b>,  <b>GrayScale</b>,  <b>StaticColor</b>,  <b>PseudoColor</b>, <b>TrueColor</b>, or <b>DirectColor</b>.  If both the <b>-class</b>
              and <b>-cc</b> options are specified, the last instance of either option takes precedence.  The class  of
              the default visual of the nested server need not be the same as the class of the default visual of
              the real server, but it must be supported by the real server.  Use <b><a href="../man1/xdpyinfo.1.html">xdpyinfo</a></b>(1) to obtain a list of
              supported  visual  classes on the real server before starting <b>Xnest</b>.  If the user chooses a static
              class, all the colors in the default color map will  be  preallocated.   If  the  user  chooses  a
              dynamic  class,  colors  in  the  default  color  map  will be available to individual clients for
              allocation.

       <b>-depth</b> <u>int</u>
              This option specifies the default visual depth of the nested server.  The  depth  of  the  default
              visual  of  the  nested server need not be the same as the depth of the default visual of the real
              server, but it must be supported by the  real  server.   Use  <b><a href="../man1/xdpyinfo.1.html">xdpyinfo</a></b>(1)  to  obtain  a  list  of
              supported visual depths on the real server before starting <b>Xnest</b>.

       <b>-sss</b>   This  option  tells <b>Xnest</b> to use the software screen saver.  By default, <b>Xnest</b> will use the screen
              saver that corresponds to the hardware screen saver in the real  server.   Of  course,  even  this
              screen  saver is software-generated since <b>Xnest</b> does not control any actual hardware.  However, it
              is treated as a hardware screen saver within the sample server code.

       <b>-geometry</b> <u>W</u><b>x</b><u>H</u><b>+</b><u>X</u><b>+</b><u>Y</u>
              This option specifies the geometry parameters for  the  top-level  <b>Xnest</b>  window.   See  “GEOMETRY
              SPECIFICATIONS”  in <b><a href="../man7/X.7.html">X</a></b>(7) for a discussion of this option's syntax.  This window corresponds to the
              root window of the nested server.  The width <u>W</u> and height <u>H</u> specified with this option will be the
              maximum width and height of each top-level <b>Xnest</b> window.  <b>Xnest</b> will allow the user  to  make  any
              top-level  window  smaller,  but  it  will  not actually change the size of the nested server root
              window.  <b>Xnest</b> does not yet support the RANDR extension for resizing, rotation, and reflection  of
              the  root  window.   If  this  option is not specified, <b>Xnest</b> will choose <u>W</u> and <u>H</u> to be 3/4ths the
              dimensions of the root window of the real server.

       <b>-bw</b> <u>int</u>
              This option specifies the border width of the top-level <b>Xnest</b> window.  The integer  parameter  <u>int</u>
              must be positive.  The default border width is 1.

       <b>-name</b> <u>string</u>
              This  option specifies the name of the top-level <b>Xnest</b> window as <u>string</u>.  The default value is the
              program name.

       <b>-scrns</b> <u>int</u>
              This option specifies the number of screens to create in the  nested  server.   For  each  screen,
              <b>Xnest</b>  will create a separate top-level window.  Each screen is referenced by the number after the
              dot in the client display name specification.  For example,  <b>xterm</b>  <b>-display</b>  <b>:1.1</b>  will  open  an
              <b><a href="../man1/xterm.1.html">xterm</a></b>(1)  client in the nested server with the display number <b>:1</b> on the second screen.  The number
              of screens is limited by the hard-coded constant in the server sample code, which is usually 3.

       <b>-install</b>
              This option tells <b>Xnest</b> to do its own color map installation by bypassing the real window manager.
              For it to work properly, the user will probably have to temporarily quit the real window  manager.
              By  default,  <b>Xnest</b>  will keep the nested client window whose color map should be installed in the
              real server in the <u>WM_COLORMAP_WINDOWS</u> property of the top-level <b>Xnest</b> window.  If this color  map
              is  of  the  same  visual  type as the root window of the nested server, <b>Xnest</b> will associate this
              color map with the top-level <b>Xnest</b> window as well.  Since this does  not  have  to  be  the  case,
              window  managers  should  look primarily at the <u>WM_COLORMAP_WINDOWS</u> property rather than the color
              map associated with the top-level <b>Xnest</b> window.  Unfortunately, window managers are not very  good
              at doing that yet so this option might come in handy.

       <b>-parent</b> <u>window_id</u>
              This option tells <b>Xnest</b> to use <u>window_id</u> as the root window instead of creating a window.

</pre><h4><b>EXTENDED</b> <b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Starting  up <b>Xnest</b> is just as simple as starting up <b><a href="../man1/xclock.1.html">xclock</a></b>(1) from a terminal emulator.  If a user wishes
       to run <b>Xnest</b> on the same workstation as the real server, it is important that the nested server is  given
       its  own  listening  socket  address.   Therefore,  if  there  is  a server already running on the user's
       workstation, <b>Xnest</b> will have to be started up with a new display number.  Since there is usually no  more
       than  one  server  running on a workstation, specifying ‘<b>Xnest</b> <b>:1</b>’ on the command line will be sufficient
       for most users.  For each server running on the workstation, the display number needs to  be  incremented
       by one.  Thus, if you wish to start another <b>Xnest</b>, you will need to type ‘<b>Xnest</b> <b>:2</b>’ on the command line.

       To  run clients in the nested server, each client needs to be given the same display number as the nested
       server.  For example, ‘<b>xterm</b> <b>-display</b> <b>:1</b>’ will start up an <b>xterm</b> process in the first nested  server  and
       ‘<b>xterm</b>  <b>-display</b>  <b>:2</b>’ will start an <b>xterm</b> in the second nested server from the example above.  Additional
       clients can be started from these <b>xterm</b>s in each nested server.

   <b>Xnest</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>client</b>
       <b>Xnest</b> behaves and looks to the real server and other real clients as another real client.  It is a rather
       demanding client, however, since almost any window or graphics request from a nested client  will  result
       in a window or graphics request from <b>Xnest</b> to the real server.  Therefore, it is desirable that <b>Xnest</b> and
       the real server are on a local network, or even better, on the same machine.  <b>Xnest</b> assumes that the real
       server supports the SHAPE extension.  There is no way to turn off this assumption dynamically.  <b>Xnest</b> can
       be  compiled  without  the  SHAPE  extension built in, in which case the real server need not support it.
       Dynamic SHAPE extension selection support may be considered in further development of <b>Xnest</b>.

       Since <b>Xnest</b> need not use the same default visual as the the real server,  the  top-level  window  of  the
       <b>Xnest</b> client always has its own color map.  This implies that other windows' colors will not be displayed
       properly  while  the keyboard or pointer focus is in the <b>Xnest</b> window, unless the real server has support
       for more than one installed color map at any time.  The color map associated with the top window  of  the
       <b>Xnest</b>  client  need  not  be the appropriate color map that the nested server wants installed in the real
       server.  In the case that a nested client attempts to install a color map of a different visual from  the
       default  visual  of  the nested server, <b>Xnest</b> will put the top window of this nested client and all other
       top windows of the nested clients that use the same color map into the  <u>WM_COLORMAP_WINDOWS</u>  property  of
       the  top-level  <b>Xnest</b> window on the real server.  Thus, it is important that the real window manager that
       manages the <b>Xnest</b> top-level window looks at the <u>WM_COLORMAP_WINDOWS</u> property rather than  the  color  map
       associated  with  the  top-level  <b>Xnest</b> window.  Since most window managers don't yet appear to implement
       this convention properly, <b>Xnest</b> can optionally do direct installation of color maps into the real  server
       bypassing  the  real  window  manager.   If  the  user  chooses  this  option, it is usually necessary to
       temporarily disable the real window manager since it will interfere with the <b>Xnest</b> scheme  of  color  map
       installation.

       Keyboard  and  pointer  control  procedures  of the nested server change the keyboard and pointer control
       parameters of the real server.  Therefore, after <b>Xnest</b> is started up, it will  change  the  keyboard  and
       pointer controls of the real server to its own internal defaults.

   <b>Xnest</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>server</b>
       <b>Xnest</b>  as a server looks exactly like a real server to its own clients.  For the clients, there is no way
       of telling if they are running on a real or a nested server.

       As already mentioned, <b>Xnest</b> is a very user-friendly server when it comes to  customization.   <b>Xnest</b>  will
       pick  up a number of command-line arguments that can configure its default visual class and depth, number
       of screens, etc.

       The only apparent intricacy from the users' perspective about using <b>Xnest</b> as a server is the selection of
       fonts.  <b>Xnest</b> manages fonts by loading them locally and then passing the font name to the real server and
       asking it to load that font remotely.  This approach avoids the overload of sending the glyph bits across
       the network for every text operation, although it is really a bug.  The consequence of this  approach  is
       that the user will have to worry about two different font paths — a local one for the nested server and a
       remote  one  for  the real server — since <b>Xnest</b> does not propagate its font path to the real server.  The
       reason for this is because real and nested servers need not run on the same file system which  makes  the
       two  font  paths  mutually  incompatible.   Thus, if there is a font in the local font path of the nested
       server, there is no guarantee that this font exists in the remote font path  of  the  real  server.   The
       <b><a href="../man1/xlsfonts.1.html">xlsfonts</a></b>(1)  client,  if  run on the nested server, will list fonts in the local font path and, if run on
       the real server, will list fonts in the remote font path.  Before a font can be  successfully  opened  by
       the  nested  server,  it has to exist in local and remote font paths.  It is the users' responsibility to
       make sure that this is the case.

</pre><h4><b>FUTURE</b> <b>DIRECTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Make dynamic the requirement for the SHAPE extension in the real server, rather than having to  recompile
       <b>Xnest</b> to turn this requirement on and off.

       Perhaps  there  should be a command-line option to tell <b>Xnest</b> to inherit the keyboard and pointer control
       parameters from the real server rather than imposing its own.

       <b>Xnest</b> should read a customization input file to provide even greater freedom and simplicity in  selecting
       the desired layout.

       There is no support for backing store and save unders, but this should also be considered.

       The proper implementation of fonts should be moved into the <u>os</u> layer.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Doesn't run well on servers supporting different visual depths.

       Still crashes randomly.

       Probably has some memory leaks.
