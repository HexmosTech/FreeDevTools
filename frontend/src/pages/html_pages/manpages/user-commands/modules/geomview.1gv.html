       Geomview - interactive geometry viewer

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       geomview [-b <u>r</u> <u>g</u> <u>b</u>] [-c <u>commandfile</u>] [-wins <u>#windows</u>] [-noinit] [-nopanels] [-noopengl]
            [-wpos <u>xmin</u> <u>ymin</u> <u>xsize</u> <u>ysize</u>] [-wpos <u>xsize,ysize</u>[@<u>xmin,ymin</u>]] [-e <u>external-module-name</u>]
            [-M[cg][sp] <u>pipename</u>] [-start <u>external-module-name</u> [<u>arg</u> ...] --] [-run <u>external-module-</u>
            <u>path</u> [<u>arg</u> ...] --] [<u>file</u> ...]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Geomview  is  an  interactive geometry viewer written at the Geometry Center.  It displays the objects in
       the files given on the command line and allows the user to view and manipulate them interactively.

       The present version (1.7) of geomview runs on Silicon Graphics Irises, and X Window System  workstations.
       We  are very interested in hearing about any problems you may have using it; see below for information on
       how to contact us.

       In addition to providing interactive control over a world of objects via the mouse and keyboard, geomview
       has an interpreted language of commands for controlling almost every aspect of its display.  It can  exe‐
       cute  files  containing statements in this language, and it can communicate with other programs using the
       language.  See <a href="../man5/geomview.5.html">geomview</a>(5), e.g. the file man/cat5/geomview.5 in the geomview distribution, for more  de‐
       tails of the language.

</pre><h4><b>TUTORIAL</b></h4><pre>
       This manual page serves only as a (very) terse reference manual for geomview.  For a gentler introduction
       to  the  program and the format of the data files it can read, see "overview" and "oogltour" in the "doc"
       directory of the geomview distribution, or better, see the full manual: "geomview.tex" or  "geomview.ps",
       also  in the "doc" directory.  The source distribution also includes a tutorial for how to write external
       modules in the "src/bin/example" directory.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       -b     Set the window background color to the given r g b values.

       -c     Interpret the commands in commandfile, which may be ``-'' for standard input.   The  command  lan‐
              guage is described in <a href="../man5/geomview.5.html">geomview</a>(5).  Commands may be supplied literally, as in ``-c "(ui-panel main
              off)"''; since they include parentheses, they must be quoted.

       -wins  Causes geomview to initially display #windows camera windows.

       -wpos  Specifies  the initial location and size of the first camera window.  With ``-'', you are prompted
              for window placement.

       -M <u>objname</u>
               Display (possibly dynamically changing) geometry (or commands) sent via ``<b>togeomview</b>  <b>-g</b>  <u>objname</u>
              [<u>geomview-shell-command</u>]''  or ``<b>geomstuff</b> <u>objname</u> <u>file</u> ...''.  The data appears as a geomview ob‐
              ject named <u>objname</u>.

              Actually listens to the named pipe ``/tmp/geomview/<u>objname</u>''; you can achieve the same effect with
              the shell commands:
                  mkdir /tmp/geomview;
                  mknod /tmp/geomview/<u>objname</u> p
              (assuming the directory and named pipe don't already exist), then executing the geomview command:
                  (geometry <u>objname</u>  &lt; /tmp/geomview/<u>objname</u>)

       -M[cg][ps[un|in|in6]] <u>PIPENAME|TCPPORT</u>

              The <b>-M</b> option accepts modifiers: a '<b>g</b>' suffix expects geometry data (the  default),  while  a  '<b>c</b>'
              suffix expects GCL commands.  A '<b>p</b>' implies the connection should use a named pipe (the default on
              everything  except  on the NeXT), while '<b>s</b>' implies using a UNIX-domain socket (the default on the
              NeXT). Since version 1.9 of Geomview internet domain sockets are also supported; use '<b>sin</b>' to make
              Geomview listen on the IPv4 port given by <b>TCPPORT</b>, or use '<b>sin6</b>' to make  Geomview  listen  on  an
              IPv6  port  (also  as  specified by <b>TCPPORT</b>). '<b>sun</b>' is a synonym for '<b>s</b>', i.e. use the Unix domain
              socket with the name <b>PIPENAME</b>. If <b>PIPENAME</b> starts with a slash ('/'), then it is assumed to be  an
              absolute pathname, otherwise the named pipe or socket is created below <b>${TMPDIR}/geomview/</b>.

              So <b>-Mcs</b> <b>fred</b> selects reading commands from the UNIX-domain socket named <b>/tmp/geomview/fred</b>, <b>-Mcsin</b>
              <b>40000</b> selects reading commands from the IPv4 port '40000'.

       -noopengl
              Disable  the use of OpenGL for (possibly) hardware accelerated rendering, even if the Geomview bi‐
              nary has support for OpenGL compiled in. This also disables the support for transparency  and  and
              textures

       -nopanels
              Start  up  displaying no panels, only graphics windows.  Panels may be invoked later as usual with
              the "Px" keyboard shortcuts or "(ui-panel ...)"  command.

       -noinit
              Read no initialization files.  By default, geomview reads the system-wide ".geomview"  file,  fol‐
              lowed by those in $HOME/.geomview and ./.geomview.

       -e <u>modulename</u>
              Start an external module; <u>modulename</u> is the name associated with the module, appearing in the main
              panel's  Applications  browser,  as defined by the emodule-define command (see <a href="../man5/geomview.5.html">geomview</a>(5) for de‐
              tails).

       -start <u>modulename</u> <u>arguments</u> ... --
              Like -e but allows you to pass arguments to the external module.  "--" signals the end of the  ar‐
              gument  list;  the  "--"  may  be omitted if it would be the last argument on the geomview command
              line.

       -run <u>shell-command</u> <u>arguments</u> ...
              Like -start but takes the pathname of executable of the external module instead  of  the  module's
              name.

</pre><h4><b>GEOMETRY</b> <b>FILE</b> <b>FORMATS</b></h4><pre>
       The  format  of  the  files  read by geomview is described in <a href="../man5/oogl.5.html">oogl</a>(5); type "man 5 oogl", or see the file
       man/cat5/oogl.5 in the geomview distribution, for details.

       Note to users of MinneView (the precursor to geomview): geomview can read MinneView files, but  MinneView
       cannot read all geomview files.

</pre><h4><b>STARTUP</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       Immediately  upon  starting up geomview reads and executes the commands in the system-wide .geomview file
       in the "data" subdirectory of the geomview directory.  Then, if there is a file named  .geomview  in  the
       current  directory,  it executes the commands in that file.  If no in the user's home directory, and exe‐
       cutes it if found. The startup file of an individual user overrides the systemwide defaults, since  later
       commands take precedence over earlier ones.

</pre><h4><b>EXTERNAL</b> <b>MODULES</b></h4><pre>
       Geomview  has the ability to interact via its command language with other programs, called "external mod‐
       ules".  Many such modules have been written and appear in the "Application" browser in the main  geomview
       panel.   To  invoke  a module you click the mouse on the module's entry in this browser.  This starts the
       module and adds an additional entry to the browser, beginning with a number  in  square  brackets  as  in
       ``[1]  Crayola'',  which represents the running instance of that module.  You can terminate the module by
       clicking on the numbered entry.  Modules are documented separately from geomview.  See  the  manual  page
       for each module for details.

</pre><h4><b>INSTALLING</b> <b>AN</b> <b>EXTERNAL</b> <b>MODULE</b></h4><pre>
       Geomview  looks  for  external  modules in a special directory for modules.  In the geomview distribution
       tree this is the "bin/$MACHTYPE" subdirectory.  A module consists of two files: the  executable  program,
       and  a "module init file", which is a whose name is ".geomview-" followed by the module name.  The module
       init file tells geomview how to run that program.  Be sure to always keep these two files  together;  ge‐
       omview  needs  both of them in order to run the module.  To install a new module, simply put the module's
       executable file and its init file in your geomview's module directory.  The next time you  run  geomview,
       it will know about that module.

       Geomview can actually looks for modules in a list of directories; by default only the "bin/$MACHTYPE" di‐
       rectory is on this list.  See the set-emodule-path command in <a href="../man5/geomview.5.html">geomview</a>(5) for details.

       There is a tutorial for how to write external modules in the "src/bin/example" directory.

</pre><h4><b>EXTERNAL</b> <b>MODULE</b> <b>INIT</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       An  external  module  init file is the file that tells geomview how to run that module.  Its name must be
       ".geomview-" followed by the name of the module, e.g. ".geomview-foo".   It should contain geomview  com‐
       mands;  typically it will contain a single emodule-define command which enters the module into geomview's
       application browser:

               (emodule-define "Foo" "foo")

       The first string is the name that appears in the browser.  The second string is the command to invoke the
       module.  It may contain arguments; in fact it can be an arbitrary shell command.

</pre><h4><b>KEYBOARD</b> <b>SHORTCUTS</b></h4><pre>
       Many geomview operations are available from the keyboard.  Hitting the "?" button on the main  panel,  or
       typing  "?"  with the cursor in any window, causes geomview to print a message on standard output listing
       all the keyboard shortcuts.

       Keyboard commands apply while cursor is in any graphics window and most
       control panels. Most commands allow one of the following selection prefixes
       (if none is provided the command applies to the current object):
          g  world geom  g#  #'th geom  g*  All geoms
          c  current camera   c#  #'th camera     c*  All cameras
       Many allow a numeric prefix:  if none they toggle or reset current value.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       The "geomview" command is actually a shell script that sets various environment variables which tell  ge‐
       omview about your local setup, and then invokes the geomview executable program "gvx" (or "gvx.OGL").  Do
       not run "gvx" by itself; always invoke geomview with the "geomview" shell script.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       data/.geomview - default initialization file in geomview command language
       data/geom - sample data files

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       The ``geomview'' shell script sets these internally by default; if you set them before invoking geomview,
       the values you set will be used instead of the built-in defaults.
       GEOMVIEW_GVX - geomview executable
       GEOMVIEW_DATA_DIR - default directory for data files
       GEOMVIEW_LOAD_PATH - colon-separated search path for data files
       GEOMVIEW_EMODULE_DIR - default directory for external emodules
       GEOMVIEW_EMODULE_PATH - colon-separated search path for external modules
       GEOMVIEW_SYSTEM_INITFILE - system-wide GCL initialization script
       GEOMDATA - top directory of the default data tree, used by some modules
       GEOMVIEW_DOC_DIR - path to the user manual
       WEBBROWSER - executable for viewing the HTML version of the manual when invoking the `Manual (HTML)' menu
            item
       PDFVIEWER  -  executable  for viewing the PDF version of the manual when invoking the `Manual (PDF)' menu
