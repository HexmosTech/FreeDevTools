</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       FvwmPager - the FVWM Pager module

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       FvwmPager  is  spawned  by  fvwm, so no command line invocation will work.  From within the .fvwmrc file,
       FvwmPager is spawned as follows:

       Module FvwmPager 0 3

       or from within an fvwm pop-up menu:

       Popup "Module-Popup"
            Title     "Modules"
            Module    "GoodStuff"    GoodStuff
            Module    "NoClutter"    FvwmClean
            Module    "FvwmIdentify" FvwmIdent
            Module  "Banner"        FvwmBanner
            Module    "Debug"        FvwmDebug
            Module  "SaveDesktop"   FvwmSave
            Module  "Pager"         FvwmPager 0 3
       EndPopup

       where "0" is the first desktop to show, and "3" is the last.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The FvwmPager module shows a miniature view of the Fvwm desktops which are specified in the command line.
       This is a useful reminder of where your active windows are. Windows in the pager are shown  in  the  same
       color as their fvwm decorations.

       The  pager  can  be used to change your viewport into the current desktop, to change desktops, or to move
       windows around.

       Pressing mouse button 1 in the pager will cause you viewport to  change  to  the  selected  page  of  the
       selected  desk.  If  you  click with button 1 in the desk-label area, you will switch desks but not pages
       within the desk.

       Dragging mouse button 2 on a miniature view of a window will cause that window to be move to the location
       where you release the mouse button, but your viewport will not change. If you drag the window out of  the
       pager  and  onto  your desktop, a full size image of the window will appear for you to place. There is no
       way to pick up a full size image of the window and move it into the pager, however. Since  some  mice  do
       not  have  button  2,  I  have  made provisions to drag windows in the pager by using pressing modifier-1
       (usually Alt) and dragging with button 3.

       Clicking mouse button 3 on a location within the current desktop will cause the viewport to move  to  the
       selected  location,  but will not align the viewport to a page boundary. Dragging button 3 will cause the
       viewport to move as you drag. Button 3 operations are limited to the current desktop only.

       When iconified, the pager will work as a fully functional current page only pager. Windows and  viewports
       can  be  moved within the icon of the pager. Users will want to make sure that they have no lines similar
       to

       Icon "Fvwm Pager" whatever

       in their .fvwmrc files.

</pre><h4><b>COPYRIGHTS</b></h4><pre>
       The FvwmClean program, and the concept for interfacing  this  module  to  the  Window  Manager,  are  all
       original work by Robert Nation.

       Copyright 1994, Robert Nation. No guarantees or warranties or anything are provided or implied in any way
       whatsoever.  Use  this program at your own risk. Permission to use this program for any purpose is given,
       as long as the copyright is kept intact.

</pre><h4><b>INITIALIZATION</b></h4><pre>
       During initialization, <u>FvwmPager</u> will eventually search a configuration file which  describes  the  time-
       outs and actions to take.  The configuration file is the same file that fvwm used during initialization.

       If the FvwmPager executable is linked to another name, ie ln -s FvwmPager OtherPager, then another module
       called  OtherPager  can  be  started, with a completely different configuration than FvwmPager, simply by
       changing the keyword  FvwmPager to OtherPager. This way multiple pager programs can be used.

</pre><h4><b>KEYBOARD</b> <b>FOCUS</b> <b>CONTROL</b></h4><pre>
       You can direct the keyboard focus to any window on the current desktop by clicking with button 2  on  its
       image in the pager. The window does not need to be visible, but it does need to be on the current page.

</pre><h4><b>INVOCATION</b></h4><pre>
       The invocation method was shown in the synopsis section

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       FvwmPager  reads  the  same  .fvwmrc  file  as  fvwm  reads  when  it  starts  up,  and looks for certain
       configuration options:

       *FvwmPagerGeometry <u>geometry</u>
              Completely or partially specifies the  pager  windows  location  and  geometry,  in  standard  X11
              notation.   In  order  to maintain an undistorted aspect ratio, you might want to leave out either
              the width or height dimension of the geometry specification

       *FvwmPagerRows <u>rows</u>
              Tells fvwm how many rows of desks to use when laying out the pager window.

       *FvwmPagerColumns <u>columns</u>
              Tells fvwm how many columnss of desks to use when laying out the pager window.

       *FvwmPagerIconGeometry <u>geometry</u>
              Specifies a size (optional) and location (optional) for the pager's icon window. Since there is no
              easy way for FvwmPager to determine the height of the icon's label,  you  will  have  to  make  an
              allowance  for  the  icon   label  height  when  using negative y-coordinates in the icon location
              specification (used to specify a location relative to  the  bottom  instead  of  the  top  of  the
              screen).

       *FvwmPagerStartIconic
              Causes the pager to start iconified.

       *FvwmPagerFont <u>font-name</u>
              Specified  a font to use to label the desktops. If <u>font_name</u> is "none" then no desktop labels will
              be displayed.

       *FvwmPagerSmallFont <u>font-name</u>
              Specified a font to use to label the window names in the  pager.  If  not  specified,  the  window
              labels  will  be  omitted.  Window  labels  seem  to be fairly useless for desktop scales of 32 or
              greater.

       *FvwmPagerFore <u>color</u>
              Specifies the color to use to write the desktop labels, and to draw the page-grid lines.

       *FvwmPagerBack <u>color</u>
              Specifies the background color for the window.

       *FvwmPagerHilight <u>color</u>
              The active page and desk label will be highlighted by using this background pattern instead of the
              normal background.

       *FvwmPagerLabel <u>desk</u> <u>label</u>
              Assigns the text <u>label</u> to desk <u>desk</u> in the pager window.  Useful for assigning symbolic  names  to
              desktops, ie

              *FvwmPagerLabel 1 Mail
              *FvwmPagerLabel 2 Maker
              *FvwmPagerLabel 2 Matlab

       DeskTopScale <u>number</u>
              If the geometry is not specified, then a desktop reduction factor is used to calculate the pager's
              size. Things in the pager window are shown at 1/<u>number</u> of the actual size.
