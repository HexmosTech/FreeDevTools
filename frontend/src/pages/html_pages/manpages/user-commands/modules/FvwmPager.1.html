</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       FvwmPager - the Fvwm Pager module

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>FvwmPager</b>  [  <u>-transient</u>  ]  [  <u>name</u>  ]  [ <u>first</u> <u>desk</u> [ <u>last</u> <u>desk</u> ] ] FvwmPager is spawned by fvwm, so no
       command line invocation will work.

       All desks with desk numbers between <u>first</u> <u>desk</u> and <u>last</u> <u>desk</u> are displayed. If <u>last</u> <u>desk</u> is omitted  only
       the  <u>first</u>  <u>desk</u> is shown. If both desk numbers are omitted, the current desk is used instead. If you use
       an asterisk '*' in place of <u>first</u> <u>desk</u> the pager will always show the  current  desktop,  even  when  you
       switch desks.

       Example lines to put in your .fvwm2rc:

       Module FvwmPager 0 3

       or

       Module FvwmPager *

       or from within an fvwm pop-up menu:

       AddToMenu Module-Popup Modules Title
       + Audio        Module FvwmAudio
       + Auto         Module FvwmAuto 200
       + Buttons      Module FvwmButtons
       + Console      Module FvwmConsole
       + Ident        Module FvwmIdent
       + Banner       Module FvwmBanner
       + Pager        Module FvwmPager 0 3

       or

       + Pager        Module FvwmPager *

       If  the  pager  is  started  with  the <u>-transient</u> option, the next time a button is released the pager is
       closed. Note that this option does only work if the window style of the pager window is 'sticky' (see the
       fvwm man page). You should use the 'StaysOnTop' style too.

       Example:

       Style FvwmPager Sticky, StaysOnTop
       *FvwmPager: Rows       1
       *FvwmPager: Columns    1
       Mouse 3 R C Module FvwmPager -transient

       With this in your .fvwm2rc, if you press control and button 3 in the root window the pager pops up  under
       the mouse and while the viewport moves with the mouse.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The FvwmPager module shows a miniature view of the Fvwm desktops which are specified in the command line.
       This  is  a  useful reminder of where your active windows are. Windows in the pager are shown in the same
       color as their fvwm decorations.

       The pager can be used to change your viewport into the current desktop, to change desktops,  or  to  move
       windows around.

       Pressing  mouse  button  1  in  the  pager  will cause you viewport to change to the selected page of the
       selected desk. If you click with button 1 in the desk-label area, you will switch  desks  but  not  pages
       within the desk.

       Dragging mouse button 2 on a miniature view of a window will cause that window to be move to the location
       where  you release the mouse button, but your viewport will not change. If you drag the window out of the
       pager and onto your desktop, a full size image of the window will appear for you to place.  There  is  no
       way  to  pick  up a full size image of the window and move it into the pager, however. Since some mice do
       not have button 2, I have made provisions to drag windows in  the  pager  by  using  pressing  modifier-1
       (usually Alt) and dragging with button 3.

       Clicking mouse button 3 on a location will cause the viewport to move to the selected location and switch
       desks  if necessary, but will not align the viewport to a page boundary. Dragging button 3 will cause the
       viewport to move as you drag but not switch desktops, even if the pointer moves to another desktop.

       With the <u>*FvwmPager:</u> <u>SloppyFocus</u> option the focus is transferred to the window pointed at with the  mouse
       when the pointer is inside the pager.

       When  iconified, the pager will work as a fully functional current desk only pager. Windows and viewports
       can be moved within the icon of the pager. Users will want to make sure that they have no  lines  similar
       to

       Icon "Fvwm Pager" whatever

       in their .fvwm2rc files.

</pre><h4><b>COPYRIGHTS</b></h4><pre>
       The  FvwmPager  program,  and  the  concept  for  interfacing  this module to the Window Manager, are all
       original work by Robert Nation.

       Copyright 1994, Robert Nation. No guarantees or warranties or anything are provided or implied in any way
       whatsoever. Use this program at your own risk. Permission to use this program for any purpose  is  given,
       as long as the copyright is kept intact.

</pre><h4><b>INITIALIZATION</b></h4><pre>
       During initialization, <u>FvwmPager</u> gets config info from <b>fvwm</b>'s module configuration database (see <u><a href="../man1/fvwm.1.html">fvwm</a></u>(1),
       section <b>MODULE</b> <b>COMMANDS</b>).

       To  use  FvwmPager  with  several  different  configurations,  you  can invoke FvwmPager with an optional
       parameter, which it will use as its <u>name</u> instead (e.g "Module  FvwmPager  OtherPager").  OtherPager  will
       then  read  only  the  lines  in  the  configuration  file starting with "*OtherPager", and not the lines
       belonging to FvwmPager. This way multiple pager instances may be used.

       Note: the old way to use the FvwmPager with several different configurations is to link the executable to
       another name, i.e.

       ln -s FvwmPager OtherPager

       This may work, but this method is not supported.

</pre><h4><b>KEYBOARD</b> <b>FOCUS</b> <b>CONTROL</b></h4><pre>
       You can direct the keyboard focus to any window on the current desktop by clicking with button 2  on  its
       image in the pager. The window does not need to be visible, but it does need to be on the current page.

</pre><h4><b>INVOCATION</b></h4><pre>
       The invocation method was shown in the synopsis section

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       *FvwmPager: Geometry <u>geometry</u>
              Completely  or  partially  specifies  the  pager  windows  location  and geometry, in standard X11
              notation. In order to maintain an undistorted aspect ratio, you might want to leave out either the
              width or height dimension of the geometry specification.

       *FvwmPager: Rows <u>rows</u>
              Tells fvwm how many rows of desks to use when laying out the pager window.

       *FvwmPager: Columns <u>columns</u>
              Tells fvwm how many columns of desks to use when laying out the pager window.

       *FvwmPager: IconGeometry <u>geometry</u>
              Specifies a size (optional) and location (optional) for the pager's icon window. Since there is no
              easy way for FvwmPager to determine the height of the icon's label,  you  will  have  to  make  an
              allowance  for  the  icon   label  height  when  using negative y-coordinates in the icon location
              specification (used to specify a location relative to  the  bottom  instead  of  the  top  of  the
              screen).

       *FvwmPager: StartIconic
              Causes the pager to start iconified.

       *FvwmPager: NoStartIconic
              Causes the pager to start normally.  Useful for canceling the effect of the <u>StartIconic</u> option.

       *FvwmPager: LabelsBelow
              Causes the pager to draw desk labels below the corresponding desk.

       *FvwmPager: LabelsAbove
              Causes the pager to draw desk labels above the corresponding desk. Useful for canceling the effect
              of the <u>LabelsBelow</u> option.

       *FvwmPager: ShapeLabels
              Causes the pager to hide the labels of all but the current desk. This turns off label hilighting.

       *FvwmPager: NoShapeLabels
              Causes  the  pager to show the labels of all visible desks. Useful for canceling the effect of the
              <u>ShapeLabels</u> option.

       *FvwmPager: Font <u>font-name</u>
              Specified a font to use to label the desktops.  If <u>font_name</u> is "none" then no desktop labels will
              be displayed.

       *FvwmPager: SmallFont <u>font-name</u>
              Specified a font to use to label the window names in the  pager.  If  not  specified,  the  window
              labels  will  be  omitted.  Window  labels  seem  to be fairly useless for desktop scales of 32 or
              greater.  If <u>font_name</u> is "none" then no window names will be displayed.

       *FvwmPager: Fore <u>color</u>
              Specifies the color to use to write the desktop labels, and to draw the page-grid lines.

       *FvwmPager: Back <u>color</u>
              Specifies the background color for the window.

       *FvwmPager: Hilight <u>color</u>
              The active page and desk label will be highlighted by using this background pattern instead of the
              normal background.

       *FvwmPager: HilightPixmap <u>pixmap</u>
              The active page will be highlighted by  using  this  background  pattern  instead  of  the  normal
              background.

       *FvwmPager: DeskHilight
              Hilight  the active page with the current hilight color/pixmap. Useful for canceling the effect of
              the <u>NoDeskHilight</u> option.

       *FvwmPager: NoDeskHilight
              Don't hilight the active page.

       *FvwmPager: WindowColors <u>fore</u> <u>back</u> <u>hiFore</u> <u>hiBack</u>
              Change the normal/highlight colors of the windows. <u>fore</u> and <u>hiFore</u> specify the colors as used  for
              the font inside the windows. <u>back</u> and <u>hiBack</u> are used to fill the windows with.

       *FvwmPager: WindowLabelFormat <u>format</u>
              This  specifies  a printf() like format for the labels in the mini window. Possible flags are: %t,
              %i, %c, and %r for the window's title, icon title, class, or  resource  name,  respectively.   The
              default is "%i".

       *FvwmPager: Label <u>desk</u> <u>label</u>
              Assigns  the  text  <u>label</u>  to  desk <u>desk</u> (or the current desk if desk is "*") in the pager window.
              Useful for assigning symbolic names to desktops, i.e.

              *FvwmPager: Label 1 Mail
              *FvwmPager: Label 2 Maker
              *FvwmPager: Label * Matlab

              <b>Note</b>: There is currently a much better way to  specify  desk  names  globally  (and  not  just  in
              FvwmPager) using <b>DesktopName</b> command, so you should not use this option anymore.

       *FvwmPager: DeskColor <u>desk</u> <u>color</u>
              Assigns  the  color  <u>color</u>  to desk <u>desk</u> (or the current desk if desk is "*") in the pager window.
              This replaces the background color for the particular <u>desk</u>.  This only works  when  the  pager  is
              full sized. When Iconified, the pager uses the color specified by *FvwmPager: Back.

              <b>TIP:</b>  Try  using  *FvwmPager:  DeskColor in conjunction with FvwmCpp (or FvwmM4) and FvwmBacker to
              assign identical colors to your various desktops and the pager representations.

       *FvwmPager: Pixmap <u>pixmap</u>
              Use <u>pixmap</u> as background for the pager.

       *FvwmPager: DeskPixmap <u>desk</u> <u>pixmap</u>
              Assigns the pixmap <u>color</u> to desk <u>desk</u> (or the current desk if desk is "*") in  the  pager  window.
              This replaces the background pixmap for the particular <u>desk</u>.

              <b>TIP:</b>  Try  using  *FvwmPager: DeskPixmap in conjunction with FvwmCpp (or FvwmM4) and FvwmBacker to
              assign identical pixmaps to your various desktops and the pager representations.

       *FvwmPager: DeskTopScale <u>number</u>
              If the geometry is not specified, then a desktop reduction factor is used to calculate the pager's
              size. Things in the pager window are shown at 1/<u>number</u> of the actual size.

       *FvwmPager: MiniIcons
              Allow the pager to display a window's mini icon in the pager, if it has one,  instead  of  showing
              the window's name.

       *FvwmPager: MoveThreshold <u>pixels</u>
              Defines  the  distance  the pointer has to be moved before a window being dragged with button 2 is
              actually moved. The default value is three pixels. If the pointer moved less that this amount  the
              window  snaps  back  to  its original position when the button is released. If <u>pixels</u> is less than
              zero the default value is used. The value set with the <u>MoveThreshold</u> command in fvwm is  inherited
              by FvwmPager but can be overridden with this option.

       *FvwmPager: SloppyFocus
              If  the  SloppyFocus option is used, you do not need to click into the mini window in the pager to
              give the real window the focus. Simply putting the pointer over the window  inside  the  pager  is
              enough.

              Note:  This  option  interferes  slightly  with  the  MouseFocus  and  SloppyFocus styles of fvwm.
              Sometimes, if you click into the pager  window  to  change  pages  or  desks  and  then  move  the
              pointer  to a place on the screen where a window of the new page will appear, this new window does
              not  get the input focus.  This may happen if you drag the pointer over one of the mini windows in
              the pager.  There is nothing that can be done about this - except not  using  SloppyFocus  in  the
              pager.

       *FvwmPager: SolidSeparators
              By  default  the  pages  of the virtual desktop are separated by dashed lines in the pager window.
              This option causes FvwmPager to use solid lines instead.

       *FvwmPager: NoSeparators
              Turns off the lines separating the pages of the virtual desktop.

       *FvwmPager: Balloons [<u>type</u>]
              Show a balloon describing the window when the pointer is moved into a window  in  the  pager.  The
              default format (the window's icon name) can be changed using BalloonStringFormat. If <u>type</u> is <u>Pager</u>
              balloons  are just shown for an un-iconified pager; if <u>type</u> is <u>Icon</u> balloons are just shown for an
              iconified pager. If <u>type</u> is anything else (or null) balloons are always shown.

       *FvwmPager: BalloonFore <u>color</u>
              Specifies the color for text in the balloon window. If omitted it defaults to the foreground color
              for the window being described.

       *FvwmPager: BalloonBack <u>color</u>
              Specifies the background color for the balloon window. If omitted it defaults  to  the  background
              color for the window being described.

       *FvwmPager: BalloonFont <u>font-name</u>
              Specifies a font to use for the balloon text. Defaults to <u>fixed</u>.

       *FvwmPager: BalloonBorderWidth <u>number</u>
              Sets the width of the balloon window's border. Defaults to 1.

       *FvwmPager: BalloonBorderColor <u>color</u>
              Sets the color of the balloon window's border. Defaults to black.

       *FvwmPager: BalloonYOffset <u>number</u>
              The  balloon  window  is  positioned  to  be  horizontally centered against the pager window it is
              describing. The vertical position may be set as an offset. Negative offsets of  <u>-n</u>  are  placed  <u>n</u>
              pixels above the pager window, positive offsets of <u>+n</u> are placed <u>n</u> pixels below. Offsets of -1 and
              1  represent  the  balloon window close to the original window without a gap. Offsets of 0 are not
              permitted, as this would permit direct transit from pager window to  balloon  window,  causing  an
              event  loop.  Defaults  to  +3.  The offset will change sign automatically, as needed, to keep the
              balloon on the screen.

       *FvwmPager: BalloonStringFormat format
              The same as <u>*FvwmPager:</u> <u>WindowLabelFormat</u>,  it  just  specifies  the  string  to  display  in  the
              balloons. The default is "%i".

       *FvwmPager: Colorset <u>desk</u> <u>colorset</u>
              Tells  the  module to use colorset <u>colorset</u> for <u>desk</u>. If you use an asterisk '*' in place of <u>desk</u>,
              the colorset is used on all desks.

       *FvwmPager: BalloonColorset <u>desk</u> <u>colorset</u>
              Tells the module to use colorset <u>colorset</u> for balloons on <u>desk</u>. If you  use  an  asterisk  '*'  in
              place of <u>desk</u>, the colorset is used on all desks.

       *FvwmPager: HilightColorset <u>desk</u> <u>colorset</u>
              Tells  the  module  to use colorset <u>colorset</u> for hilighting on <u>desk</u>. If you use an asterisk '*' in
              place of <u>desk</u>, the colorset is used on all desks.

       *FvwmPager: WindowColorsets <u>colorset</u> <u>activecolorset</u>
              Uses colorsets in the same way as *FvwmPager: WindowColors.  The shadow and hilight colors of  the
              colorset are only used for the window borders if the *FvwmPager: Window3DBorders is specified too.

       *FvwmPager: WindowBorderWidth <u>n</u>
              Specifies  the  width of the border drawn around the mini windows. This also sets the minimum size
              of the mini windows to (2 * <u>n</u> + 1). The default is 1.

       *FvwmPager: Window3DBorders
              Specifies that the mini windows should have a 3d borders based on the mini window background. This
              option only works if *FvwmPager: WindowColorsets is specified.

       *FvwmPager: UseSkipList
              Tells FvwmPager to not show the windows that are using the WindowListSkip style.
