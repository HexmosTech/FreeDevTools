</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       <b>FvwmAnimate</b> - the fvwm animate module

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       Module FvwmAnimate [ModuleAlias]

       <b>FvwmAnimate</b>  can  only  be  invoked  by fvwm.  Command line invocation of the FvwmAnimate module will not
       work.

       From within the .fvwm2rc file, <b>FvwmAnimate</b> is spawned as follows:

       Module FvwmAnimate

       or from within an fvwm pop-up menu:

       DestroyMenu Module-Popup
       AddToMenu   Module-Popup "Modules" Title
       + "Fvwm Animate Icons" Module FvwmAnimate ModuleAlias

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>FvwmAnimate</b> module animates iconification and de-iconification or on command.  There are currently  6
       different animation effects.

</pre><h4><b>INVOCATION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>FvwmAnimate</b> must be invoked by the <b>fvwm</b> window manager.  When invoked with the <u>OptionalName</u> argument, the
       <u>ModuleAlias</u>  is  used  to  find  configuration  commands,  configuration  files,  and name the internally
       generated menus and forms instead of "FvwmAnimate".  During startup, FvwmAnimate defines menus and  forms
       for  configuring  and  controlling  FvwmAnimate.  The default menu name is "MenuFvwmAnimate" and the form
       name is "FormFvwmAnimate".  If the optional name is used, the menu would be "Menu&lt;ModuleAlias&gt;"  and  the
       form would be "Form&lt;ModuleAlias&gt;".

       Assuming  you  already had a builtin menu called "Module-Popup", you could use FvwmAnimate by configuring
       it like this:

       AddToFunc "StartFunction" "I" Module FvwmAnimate
       AddToMenu "Module-Popup" "Control Animation" Popup MenuFvwmAnimate

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Since the pop up menu "MenuFvwmAnimate" allows complete control of  the  <b>FvwmAnimate</b>  module,  you  don't
       really have to know what any of the configuration commands are.  This section describes them anyway.

       <b>FvwmAnimate</b>  gets  configuration  info  from  <b>fvwm</b>'s  module configuration database (see <u><a href="../man1/fvwm.1.html">fvwm</a></u>(1), section
       <b>MODULE</b> <b>COMMANDS</b>).  In addition, <b>FvwmAnimate</b> reads the file $HOME/.FvwmAnimate, and accepts commands  from
       fvwm and its modules as it runs.

       If <u>ModuleAlias</u> is used to  start FvwmAnimate, the optional name is used in all commands,  messages, menus
       and  forms  generated  by   FvwmAnimate  and in the configuration file name.   Unlike other fvwm modules,
       there is little reason to use the optional name.

       *FvwmAnimate: Color <b>color</b>
              Tells <b>FvwmAnimate</b> what color to draw with.  The  color  is  "XOR'ed"  (exclusive  ORed)  onto  the
              background.   Depending  on  the  display  type  you are using,  the effect this causes will vary.
              Especially on 8-bit displays, it helps if the background is a solid color.  You have to experiment
              with this to see how it works.

              The default color is not really a color and can  be  entered  as  "Black^White",  or  more  simply
              "None".  This is the same as the default XOR mask used by fvwm for move and resize frames.

              Other  colors can be specified using standard X color notation.  Ie. color names like "LightBlue",
              or RGB values like "#FFFFFF".

       *FvwmAnimate: Pixmap <b>pixmap</b>
              Tells <b>FvwmAnimate</b> to use <b>pixmap</b> to draw with. This can be useful if <b>*FvwmAnimate:</b> <b>Color</b> gives poor
              results.

       *FvwmAnimate: Delay <b>msecs</b>
              Tells <b>FvwmAnimate</b> how many milliseconds to sleep between frames of animation.

       *FvwmAnimate: Iterations <b>iterations</b>
              Tells <b>FvwmAnimate</b> how many steps to break the animation into.

       *FvwmAnimate: Twist <b>twist</b>
              Tells <b>FvwmAnimate</b> how many revolutions to twist the iconification frame.

       *FvwmAnimate: Width <b>width</b>
              Tells <b>FvwmAnimate</b> how wide a line to draw with.  The default width of 0 (zero) is a fast  line  of
              Width 1.

       *FvwmAnimate: Effect <b>mode</b>
              Tells  <b>FvwmAnimate</b>  which animation effect to use.  Currently the effects are: <u>Frame</u>, <u>Lines</u>, <u>Flip</u>,
              <u>Turn</u>, <u>Zoom3D</u>, <u>Twist</u> <u>Random</u>, and <u>None</u>.  <u>None</u> is normally set in  the  configuration  file,  in-case
              FvwmAnimate is started automatically, but an individual user doesn't want it running.

       *FvwmAnimate: Stop
              Tells <b>FvwmAnimate</b> to stop.

       *FvwmAnimate: Save
              Tells  <b>FvwmAnimate</b>  to  save the current configuration in a file named ".FvwmAnimate" in the users
              home directory.  This same file is read automatically by FvwmAnimate during startup.

</pre><h4><b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>FvwmAnimate</b> can be asked to produce an animation thru the "SendToModule"  command.   The  format  of  the
       command is:

            SendToModule FvwmAnimate animate sx sy sw sh dx dy dw dh

       The  second  word  must  match  the name <b>FvwmAnimate</b> is started with.  The 8 fields after <u>animate</u> must be
       numbers.  The first 4 are for the source (or starting) location of the animation.  The last 4 are for the
       destination of the animation.  The 2 pairs of 4 numbers, represent rectangles.  The first 2  numbers  are
       the  x  and  y  location of the upper right corner.  The next 2 numbers are the width and height.  One or
       more spaces can separate the fields in the command.

       Modules can use the "SendToModule" command to animate "NoIcon" windows, or you can think up your own ways
       to have all kinds of fun with this command.

       Additional available commands are: <u>pause</u>, <u>play</u>, <u>push</u>, <u>pop</u> and <u>reset</u>.  These may be space separated.

       <u>pause</u> causes a module to not temporarily produce any animations.  <u>play</u> causes  a  module  to  produce  an
       animation  again.  <u>push</u> stores the current playing state for a future and <u>pop</u> restores it.  <u>reset</u> removes
       all stored states and sets playing on.

       Suppose, we don't want to wait for all 40 xterms to be animated:

            SendToModule FvwmAnimate pause
            All (XTerm) Iconify on

       And if we don't want to damage the current playing state, then:

            SendToModule FvwmAnimate push pause
            All (XTerm) Iconify on
            SendToModule FvwmAnimate pop
