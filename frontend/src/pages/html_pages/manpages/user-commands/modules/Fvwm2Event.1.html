</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       <u>FvwmEvent</u> - the fvwm event module

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>FvwmEvent</u>  is  a  more  versatile  replacement for <u>FvwmAudio</u>.  It can in general be used to hook any <u>fvwm</u>
       function or program to any window manager event. E.g: Delete unwanted Netscape  Pop  ups  or  application
       error  pop ups as they appear, play sounds, log events to a file and the like. Be creative, you'll find a
       use for it.

       <u>FvwmEvent</u> is spawned by <u>fvwm</u>, so no command line invocation will work.  From within  the  <u>.fvwm2rc</u>  file,
       <u>FvwmEvent</u> is spawned as follows:

       Module FvwmEvent

       or from within an <u>fvwm</u> pop-up menu:

       DestroyMenu Module-Popup
       AddToMenu Module-Popup "Modules" Title
       + "Event"        Module FvwmEvent
       + "Auto"         Module FvwmAuto 200
       + "Buttons"      Module FvwmButtons
       + "Console"      Module FvwmConsole
       + "Ident"        Module FvwmIdent
       + "Banner"       Module FvwmBanner
       + "Pager"        Module FvwmPager 0 3

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>FvwmEvent</u> module communicates with the <u>fvwm</u> window manager to bind <u>actions</u> to window manager <u>events</u>.
       Different actions may be assigned to distinct window manager events.

       <u>FvwmEvent</u> can be used to bind sound files to events like <u>FvwmAudio</u> (RiP) did. It can be used for  logging
       event traces to a log file, while debugging <u>fvwm</u>.

       <u>FvwmEvent</u> can also have builtin support for the rplay library.  (heritage of FvwmAudio)

</pre><h4><b>INVOCATION</b></h4><pre>
       The  invocation  method  was  shown  in  the  synopsis  section.  No command line invocation is possible.
       <u>FvwmEvent</u> must be invoked by the <u>fvwm</u> window manager. <u>FvwmEvent</u> accepts a single argument:

       -audio Enables FvwmAudio compatibility mode.

       alias  Makes FvwmEvent use <u>alias</u> as its name. This affects which lines from the user's configuration file
              are used.

              Invoking FvwmEvent as <u>FvwmAudio</u> (either by using an alias or creating a symlink) enables FvwmAudio
              compatibility mode.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>FvwmEvent</u> gets config info from  <b>fvwm</b>'s  module  configuration  database  (see  <u><a href="../man1/fvwm.1.html">fvwm</a></u>(1),  section  <b>MODULE</b>
       <b>COMMANDS</b>), and looks for certain configuration options:

       *FvwmEvent: Cmd <u>command</u>
              This  determines  the <u>fvwm</u> function that is to be called with the event parameters. You might want
              to do one of the following (details below):

                   # play sounds
                   *FvwmEvent: Cmd <u>builtin-rplay</u>

                   # execute distinct fvwm functions
                   *FvwmEvent: Cmd

                   # execute distinct external programs
                   *FvwmEvent: Cmd exec

              This version of <u>FvwmEvent</u> has builtin <u>rplay</u> support which does not  need  to  invoke  an  external
              audio  player  to  play  sounds.   The  rplay  support  is enabled when <u>FvwmEvent</u> is compiled with
              <u>HAVE_RPLAY</u> defined and when <u>FvwmEvent:</u> <u>Cmd</u> is set to <u>builtin-rplay</u>. See remarks below if <u>FvwmEvent</u>
              is invoked in FvwmAudio compatibility mode.

              For example:

                   *FvwmEvent: Cmd <u>builtin-rplay</u>
                   *FvwmEvent: add_window drip.au

              rplay can be obtained via anonymous ftp at

                   &lt;URL:<a href="ftp://ftp.sdsu.edu/pub/rplay">ftp://ftp.sdsu.edu/pub/rplay</a>&gt; or
                   &lt;URL:<a href="ftp://ftp.x.org/contrib/Event/audio/rplay">ftp://ftp.x.org/contrib/Event/audio/rplay</a>&gt;

              <u>FvwmEvent</u> also has support for any other external program.  e.g: the rsynth 'say' command:

                   *FvwmEvent: Cmd "Exec /rsynth/say"
                   *FvwmEvent: destroy_window "window closed"

              You can also use <u>fvwm</u>'s builtin <u>Echo</u> command as <u>FvwmEvent:</u> <u>Cmd</u> to obtain  debug  output  for  <u>fvwm</u>
              events quietly.  I used this setup to debug FvwmAuto:

                   *FvwmEvent: Cmd <u>Echo</u>
                   *FvwmEvent: focus_change "focus change"
                   *FvwmEvent: raise_window "raise window"

              You can even call different shell commands for each event just by setting

                   *FvwmEvent: Cmd exec
                   *FvwmEvent: add_window 'killname "APPL ERROR"'

       *FvwmEvent: PassId
              Specifies  that  the  event action will have an ID parameter added to the end of the command line.
              Most events will have the windowID of the window that the event refers to, new_desk will have  the
              new desk number. The windowID is a hexadecimal string preceded by 0x, desk numbers are decimal.

       *FvwmEvent: <u>window-manager-event</u> <u>action-or-filename</u>
              Binds particular actions to window manager events.

              e.g. for audio-events:

                   *FvwmEvent: startup TaDa.au
                   *FvwmEvent: shutdown Elvis_Left.au
                   *FvwmEvent: unknown doh.au

                   *FvwmEvent: new_page beam_trek.au
                   *FvwmEvent: new_desk beam_trek.au
                   *FvwmEvent: old_add_window drip.au
                   *FvwmEvent: raise_window swoosh.au
                   *FvwmEvent: lower_window swoosh.au
                   *FvwmEvent: old_configure_window hammer.au
                   *FvwmEvent: focus_change boing.au
                   *FvwmEvent: enter_window boing.au
                   *FvwmEvent: leave_window boing.au
                   *FvwmEvent: destroy_window explosion.au
                   *FvwmEvent: iconify ploop.au
                   *FvwmEvent: deiconify ploop.au
                   *FvwmEvent: window_name huh.au
                   *FvwmEvent: icon_name beep.au
                   *FvwmEvent: visible_icon_name beep.au
                   *FvwmEvent: res_class beep.au
                   *FvwmEvent: res_name beep.au
                   *FvwmEvent: end_windowlist twang.au

                   *FvwmEvent: icon_location beep.au
                   *FvwmEvent: map beep.au
                   *FvwmEvent: error beep.au
                   *FvwmEvent: config_info beep.au
                   *FvwmEvent: end_config_info beep.au
                   *FvwmEvent: icon_file beep.au
                   *FvwmEvent: default_icon beep.au
                   *FvwmEvent: string plapper.au
                   *FvwmEvent: mini_icon beep.au
                   *FvwmEvent: windowshade beep.au
                   *FvwmEvent: dewindowshade beep.au

                   *FvwmEvent: visible_name beep.au
                   *FvwmEvent: sendconfig beep.au
                   *FvwmEvent: restack beep.au
                   *FvwmEvent: add_window beep.au
                   *FvwmEvent: configure_window beep.au

                   *FvwmEvent: visible_icon_name beep.au
                   *FvwmEvent: enter_window beep.au
                   *FvwmEvent: leave_window beep.au
                   *FvwmEvent: property_change beep.au

              The  window  related  event  handlers are executed within a window context.  Previously PassId was
              used for this purpose, but now using PassId is not needed.

              Note: The enter_window event is generated when the pointer enters  a  window.   With  the  -passid
              option,  that  window's  id  is  passed  to fvwm.  An enter_window event is generated too when the
              pointer leaves a window and moves into the root window.  In this case, the id passed is 0.

              Note: When the shutdown event  arrives,  FvwmEvent  may  be  killed  before  it  can  trigger  the
              associated action.

              Provided  <u>fvwm</u> supports it (not yet), there's an additional event to replace all <u>fvwm</u> beeps with a
              sound:

                   *FvwmEvent: beep beep.au

       *FvwmEvent: Delay <u>5</u>
              Specifies that an event-action will only be executed if it occurs at least  5  seconds  after  the
              previous  event.  Events that occur during the delay period are ignored.  This option is useful if
              you don't want several sounds playing at the same time.  The default delay is 0 which disables the
              Event delay.

       *FvwmEvent: StartDelay <u>delay</u>
              Specifies that an event-action will only be executed if it occurs at least <u>delay</u> seconds after the
              startup event. Events that occur during the delay period are ignored.  This option is useful  when
              <u>fvwm</u> starts and restarts using an audio player.  The default delay is 0.

</pre><h4><b>RPLAY</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The  following  options are only valid with builtin rplay support.  i.e: when <u>FvwmEvent</u> was compiled with
       <u>HAVE_RPLAY</u> defined.  They are used only if <u>FvwmEvent:</u> <u>Cmd</u> is set to <u>builtin-rplay</u>.

       *FvwmEvent: RplayHost <u>hostname</u>
              Specifies what host the rplay sounds will play on.   The  <u>hostname</u>  can  also  be  an  environment
              variable such as $HOSTDISPLAY.

       *FvwmEvent: RplayPriority <u>0</u>
              Specifies what priority will be assigned to the rplay sounds when they are played.

       *FvwmEvent: RplayVolume <u>127</u>
              Specifies what volume will be assigned to the sounds when they are played.

</pre><h4><b>FvwmAudio</b> <b>Compatibility</b> <b>Mode</b></h4><pre>
       When  invoked  in  FvwmAudio  compatibility  mode (see above), FvwmEvent accepts the following options to
       provide backwards compatibility for FvwmAudio:

       *FvwmEvent: PlayCmd <u>command</u>
              This is equivalent to using *FvwmEvent: Cmd to Exec  commands.  This  determines  the  independent
              audio  player  program  that will actually play the sounds. If the play command is set to <u>builtin-</u>
              <u>rplay</u> then the builtin rplay support will be used.

       *FvwmAudio: Dir <u>directory</u>
              Specifies the directory to look for the audio files.  This option is ignored when rplay is used.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       It's REALLY noisy when <u>fvwm</u> starts and restarts using an audio player.  You can use FvwmEvent: StartDelay
       to fix this problem.

</pre><h4><b>COPYRIGHTS</b></h4><pre>
       This module has evolved of <u>FvwmAudio</u>, which in term is heavily based on  a  similar  Fvwm  module  called
       <u>FvwmSound</u> by Mark Boyns. <u>FvwmAudio</u> simply took Mark's original program and extended it to make it generic
       enough to work with any audio player. Due to different requests to do specific things on specific events,
       <u>FvwmEvent</u>  took  this  one step further and now calls any <u>fvwm</u> function, or builtin-rplay. If <u>fvwm</u>'s Exec
       function is used, any external program can be called with any parameter.

       The concept for interfacing this module to the Window Manager, is original work by Robert Nation.
