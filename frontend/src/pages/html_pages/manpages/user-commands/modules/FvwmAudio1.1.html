</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       <b>FvwmAudio</b> - the FVWM Audio module

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>FvwmAudio</b>  is  spawned  by  <b>fvwm</b>, so no command line invocation will work.  From within the <u>.fvwmrc</u> file,
       <b>FvwmAudio</b> is spawned as follows:

       Module FvwmAudio

       or from within an fvwm pop-up menu:

       Popup "Module-Popup"
            Title     "Modules"
            Module    "GoodStuff"    GoodStuff
            Module    "NoClutter"    FvwmClean
            Module    "FvwmIdentify" FvwmIdent
            Module  "Banner"        FvwmBanner
            Module    "Debug"        FvwmDebug
            Module  "Audio"          FvwmAudio
            Module  "Pager"         FvwmPager 0 3
       EndPopup

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>FvwmAudio</b> module communicates with the Fvwm window manager to bind audio  sounds  to  window  manager
       actions.  Different audio queues may be assigned to any window manager action. <b>FvwmAudio</b> can be used with
       any independent audio player, and therefore requires no special audio library APIs of its own. Simple  in
       its  design,  it  merely  binds  the audio filenames to particular actions and forks off the audio player
       program with the appropriate filename when that action occurs.

       <b>FvwmAudio</b> can also have builtin support for the rplay library.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>FvwmAudio</b> reads the same <u>.fvwmrc</u> file as  <b><a href="../man1/fvwm.1.html">fvwm</a>(1)</b>  reads  when  it  starts  up,  and  looks  for  certain
       configuration options:

       *FvwmAudioPlayCmd <u>/usr/bin/X11/demos/auplay</u>
              This  determines  the independent audio player program that will actually play the sounds.  If the
              play command is set to <u>builtin-rplay</u> then the builtin rplay support will be used.  For example:

              *FvwmAudioPlayCmd <u>builtin-rplay</u>

       *FvwmAudioDir <u>/usr/lib/sounds</u>
              Specifies the directory to look for the audio files.  This option is ignored when rplay is used.

       *FvwmAudioDelay <u>5</u>
              Specifies that sound events will only be played if  they  occur  at  least  5  seconds  after  the
              previous  event.   Sounds  events  that occur during the delay period are ignored.  This option is
              useful if you don't want several sounds playing at the same time.  The default delay  is  0  which
              disables the audio delay.

       *FvwmAudioRplayHost <u>hostname</u>
              Specifies  what  host  the  sounds will play on.  The <u>hostname</u> can also be an environment variable
              such as $HOSTDISPLAY.  This option is only valid with builtin rplay support.

       *FvwmAudioRplayPriority <u>0</u>
              Specifies what priority will be assigned to the sounds when they are played.  This option is  only
              valid with builtin rplay support.

       *FvwmAudioRplayVolume <u>127</u>
              Specifies  what  volume  will be assigned to the sounds when they are played.  This option is only
              valid with builtin rplay support.

       *FvwmAudio <u>window-manager_action</u> <u>audio_filename</u>
              Binds particular window manager actions to sound queues.

              *FvwmAudio startup TaDa.au
              *FvwmAudio shutdown Elvis_Left.au

</pre><h4><b>INVOCATION</b></h4><pre>
       The invocation method was shown in  the  synopsis  section.  No  command  line  invocation  is  possible.
       <b>FvwmAudio</b> must be invoked by the <b>fvwm</b> window manager.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       It's REALLY noisy when fvwm starts and restarts.

</pre><h4><b>COPYRIGHTS</b></h4><pre>
       This  module  is  heavily based on a similar Fvwm module called <b>FvwmSound</b> by Mark Boyns. <b>FvwmAudio</b> simply
       takes Mark's original program and extends it to make it generic enough to work with any audio player. The
       concept for interfacing this module to the Window Manager, is original work by Robert Nation.
