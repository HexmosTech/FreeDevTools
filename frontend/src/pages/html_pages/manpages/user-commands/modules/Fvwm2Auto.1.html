</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       <u>FvwmAuto</u> - the fvwm auto-raise module

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       Module FvwmAuto Timeout [-passid] [-menter|-menterleave|-mfocus] [EnterCommand [LeaveCommand]]
       <u>FvwmAuto</u> can only be invoked by fvwm.  Command line invocation of the <u>FvwmAuto</u> will not work.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>FvwmAuto</u> module is most often used to automatically raise focused windows.

</pre><h4><b>INVOCATION</b></h4><pre>
       The correct syntax is:
       Module FvwmAuto Timeout [-passid] [-menter|-menterleave|-mfocus] [EnterCommand [LeaveCommand]]

       AddToMenu Modules
       + "Auto Raise (300 ms)"  Module FvwmAuto 300
       + "Auto Raise/Lower"     Module FvwmAuto 300 "Silent Raise" "Silent Lower"
       The  <u>Timeout</u>  argument  is  required. It specifies how long a window must retain the keyboard input focus
       before the command is executed. The delay is measured in milliseconds, and any integer greater than  zero
       is valid.

       If  the  literal option <u>-passid</u> is given, the window id of the window just entered or left is appended to
       the command that is sent to fvwm.  This can be used with the <b>WindowId</b> command of fvwm.

       The options <u>-menter</u>, <u>-menterleave</u> and <u>-mfocus</u> influence the actions FvwmAuto reacts to.  No more than one
       of the options can be chosen.  In <u>-mfocus</u> mode, FvwmAuto raises  the  window  that  has  the  focus.   In
       <u>-menter</u>  mode,  FvwmAuto  raises  the  window  under  the  pointer when the pointer enters a window.  The
       <u>LeaveCommand</u> is executed on the window that was below the pointer before it entered the new window.  When
       the pointer leaves a window and enters the root window, the <u>EnterCommand</u> is executed too, but  without  a
       window  to  operate  on.   In  <u>-menterleave</u>  mode,  FvwmAuto  works  just  like  in <u>-menter</u> mode, but the
       <u>LeaveCommand</u> is also executed if the pointer moves out of a window but does not enter a new window.   The
       latter two modes of operation are useful with windows that do not accept the focus.

       Note:  -menterleave  mode can interfere with popup windows of some applications.  One example is the zoom
       menu of Ghostview.  Please do not complain about this to us - it is a bug in Ghostview.

       <u>EnterCommand</u> and <u>LeaveCommand</u> are optional.  <u>EnterCommand</u> is executed <u>Timeout</u> milliseconds after a window
       gets the input focus, <u>LeaveCommand</u> is executed <u>Timeout</u> milliseconds after  the  window  has  lost  focus.
       Note  that  you  always  should  use  the  'Silent' keyword before the command itself.  FvwmAuto prepends
       "Silent " to the command string on its own if yor forget this.  Without this prefix fvwm  would  ask  you
       for  a  window to act on if the window has died before the command sent by FvwmAuto has been processed by
       fvwm.  This can for example happen with popup menus.

       "Silent Raise" is the default for <u>EnterCommand</u>, but any fvwm function is allowed. I would not use "Close"
       or "Destroy" with a low timeout, though.  The <u>LeaveCommand</u> can be handy for a tidy  desktop.   Experiment
       with:
       Module FvwmAuto 0 Nop "Silent Lower"
       Module FvwmAuto 0 Nop "Silent Iconify"

       An example for auto raising windows with ClickToFocus:
       Style * ClickToFocus
       FvwmAuto 0 -menter "Silent Raise"

       An example for auto raising and lowering only some windows:
       To start FvwmAuto:
       FvwmAuto 0 -passid -menter \
       "Silent selective_raiselower raise" \
       "Silent selective_raiselower lower"
       And put this in your .fvwm2rc:
       AddToFunc selective_raiselower
       + I WindowId $1 (FvwmIconMan) $0
       + I WindowId $1 (FvwmButtons) $0
       + I WindowId $1 (xclock) $0
       ...

       More complex example (three FvwmAuto's are running):
       DestroyFunc RestoreIconified
       AddToFunc   RestoreIconified
       + I Current (Iconic) Iconify false

       DestroyFunc RegisterFocus
       AddToFunc   RegisterFocus
       + I Exec date +"%T $n focused" &gt;&gt;/tmp/focus-stats.txt

       DestroyFunc RegisterUnfocus
       AddToFunc   RegisterUnfocus
       + I Exec date +"%T $n unfocused" &gt;&gt;/tmp/focus-stats.txt

       KillModule FvwmAuto
       Module FvwmAuto 250 Raise Nop
       Module FvwmAuto 800 RestoreIconified Nop
       Module FvwmAuto   0 RegisterFocus RegisterUnfocus

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       There  is a special Raise/Lower support in FvwmAuto. It was added to improve Raise/Lower callbacks, since
       most of  FvwmAuto  usages  is  auto-raising  or  auto-lowering.  This  improvement  includes  locking  on
       M_RAISE_WINDOW  and  M_LOWER_WINDOW  packets  and  not  raising/lowering  explicitly raised windows.  The
       special Raise/Lower support is enabled only when either <u>EnterCommand</u> or  <u>LeaveCommand</u>  contain  substring
       "Raise"  or  "Lower".  You  can  use  this  fact  to enable/disable any special support by renaming these
       commands, if FvwmAuto does not automatically do want you expect it to do.

       Using <u>FvwmAuto</u> in conjunction with <u>EdgeCommand</u> can be even more powerful. There is a short example in the
       <u>fvwm</u> man page.

</pre><h4><b>AUTHOR</b></h4><pre>
       FvwmAuto just appeared one day, nobody knows how.
       FvwmAuto was simply rewritten 09/96, nobody knows by whom.
