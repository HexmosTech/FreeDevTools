</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       <b>libvdeplug_vlan</b> - vdeplug nested module: VLAN (802.1Q)

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       libvdeplug_vlan.so

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This is a libvdeplug module implementing VLANs (IEEE 802.1Q).

       With  this  plugin  VLANs  are  implemented  in a distributed fashion. The tagging (and untagging) of the
       packets is done, not by the switch, but by the plugin (attached to the VM).

       This module of libvdeplug4 can be used in any program supporting vde like  <b>vde_plug</b>,  <b>vdens</b>,  <b>kvm</b>,  <b>qemu</b>,
       <b>user-mode-linux</b> and <b>virtualbox</b>.

       The vde_plug_url syntax of this module is the following:

       <b>vlan://</b>[<u>untagged_vlan</u>][<b>[</b>OPTION[<b>/</b>OPTION]...<b>]</b>]<b>{</b><u>vde</u> <u>nested</u> <u>url</u><b>}</b>

       <b>untagged_vlan</b>  is  the number of the VLAN to which the virtual machine is connected in untagged mode. The
       traffic on this VLAN will be seen by the VM as untagged. If omitted the default value is  0,  an  invalid
       VLAN number meaning that the VM is not connected to any VLAN in untagged mode.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>u</b>, <b>untag</b>
              Untagged  traffic  on  the  network  will  be  seen by the VM as traffic tagged with this tag. The
              default value is 0, an invalid VLAN number meaning untagged traffic will not be tagged.

              If we are sure that the traffic going by over the virtual link will only be tagged, untag argument
              is useless. If untagged traffic is expected and untag is 0, \fIuntagged_vlan\fR should be  0  too;
              otherwise  there  would  not  be  a  method  to  tell untagged traffic from traffic tagged for the
              untagged VLAN, and errors during send or receive may occur.

       <b>t</b>, <b>tag</b> A string used to specify the VLANs to which the VM is connected in tagged mode. The string is made
              up of a list of tokens separated by ":" or ".". These tokens can have two forms:

              (1) A single vlan tag number meaning that the VM is connected to that VLAN in tagged mode.

              (2) Two numbers separated by "-", meaning that the tagged packets sent out  by  the  VM  with  the
              first  number  as  VLAN  tag  are  remapped on the VLAN with the second tag number and the packets
              received by the VM on the VLAN with the second number are remapped on  the  VLAN  with  the  first
              number.

       <b>x</b>, <b>trunk</b>
              A boolean argument to be used only if the connection uses trunking. If used the VM will be able to
              send and receive packets from VLANs not listed in the tag string.

       <b>q</b>, <b>qinq</b>, <b>ad</b>
              Use the ethernet type 0x88A8 for the double tagging protool 802.1ad (also known as QinQ).

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>vlan://3{tap://mytap}</b>

       The VM is connected to vlan 3 and receives only traffic from here.

       <b>vlan://3[untag=4/trunk/tag=10:11-12:12-11]{vde:///tmp/myswitch}</b>

       The  VM  is  connected  to vlan 3 in untagged mode and receive untagged traffic with vlan tag 4. The vlan
       also receives traffic from VLANs 10, 11 and 12. VLANs 11 and 12 are switched.

       <b>vdens</b> <b>vlan://4{vlan://5/qinq{vxvde://234.1.2.3}}</b>

       This example uses 802.1ad: the VDE client is connected to the VLAN 4 of the QinQ VLAN 5.
