       kyua list — Lists test cases and their metadata

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>kyua</b> <b>list</b> [<b>--build-root</b> <u>path</u>] [<b>--kyuafile</b> <u>file</u>] [<b>--verbose</b>] <u>test_case1</u> [<u>..</u> <u>test_caseN</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>kyua</b>  <b>list</b>  command  scans  all  the  test  programs and test cases in a test suite (as defined by a
       <u><a href="../man5/kyuafile.5.html">kyuafile</a></u>(5)) and prints a list of all their names, optionally accompanied by any metadata properties they
       have.

       The optional arguments to <b>kyua</b> <b>list</b> are used to select which test programs or test cases to  run.   These
       are filters and are described below in “Test filters”.

       This command must be run within a test suite or a test suite must be provided with the <b>--kyuafile</b> flag.

       The following subcommand options are recognized:

       <b>--build-root</b> <u>path</u>
           Specifies  the build root in which to find the test programs referenced by the Kyuafile, if different
           from the Kyuafile's directory.  See “Build directories” below for more information.

       <b>--kyuafile</b> <u>path</u>, <b>-k</b> <u>path</u>
           Specifies the Kyuafile to process.  Defaults to a <u>Kyuafile</u> file in the current directory.

       <b>--verbose</b>, <b>-v</b>
           Prints metadata properties for every test case.

   <b>Build</b> <b>directories</b>
       <u>Build</u> <u>directories</u> (or object directories, target directories, product directories, etc.) is  the  concept
       that  allows  a developer to keep the source tree clean from build products by asking the build system to
       place such build products under a separate subtree.

       Most build systems today support build directories.  For example, the GNU Automake/Autoconf build  system
       exposes such concept when invoked as follows:

             $ cd my-project-1.0
             $ mkdir build
             $ cd build
             $ ../configure
             $ make

       Under  such  invocation,  all the results of the build are left in the <u>my-project-1.0/build/</u> subdirectory
       while maintaining the contents of <u>my-project-1.0/</u> intact.

       Because build directories are an integral part of most build systems, and because they are  a  tool  that
       developers  use frequently, <b>kyua</b> <b>list</b> supports build directories too.  This manifests in the form of <b>kyua</b>
       <b>list</b> being able to run tests from build directories  while  reading  the  (often  immutable)  test  suite
       definition from the source tree.

       One important property of build directories is that they follow (or need to follow) the exact same layout
       as the source tree.  For example, consider the following directory listings:

             src/Kyuafile
             src/bin/ls/
             src/bin/ls/Kyuafile
             src/bin/ls/ls.c
             src/bin/ls/ls_test.c
             src/sbin/su/
             src/sbin/su/Kyuafile
             src/sbin/su/su.c
             src/sbin/su/su_test.c

             obj/bin/ls/
             obj/bin/ls/ls*
             obj/bin/ls/ls_test*
             obj/sbin/su/
             obj/sbin/su/su*
             obj/sbin/su/su_test*

       Note  how the directory layout within <u>src/</u> matches that of <u>obj/</u>.  The <u>src/</u> directory contains only source
       files and the definition of the test suite (the Kyuafiles), while the <u>obj/</u> directory  contains  only  the
       binaries generated during a build.

       All  commands  that  deal  with  the workspace support the <b>--build-root</b> <u>path</u> option.  When this option is
       provided, the directory specified by the option is considered to be the root of the build directory.  For
       example, considering our previous fake tree layout, we could invoke <b>kyua</b> <b>list</b> as any of the following:

             $ kyua list --kyuafile=src/Kyuafile --build-root=obj
             $ cd src &amp;&amp; kyua list --build-root=../obj

   <b>Test</b> <b>filters</b>
       A <u>test</u> <u>filter</u> is a string that is used to match test cases or test programs in  a  test  suite.   Filters
       have the following form:

             test_program_name[:test_case_name]

       Where  ‘test_program_name’  is  the  name  of  a  test  program  or a subdirectory in the test suite, and
       ‘test_case_name’ is the name of a test case.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>kyua</b> <b>list</b> command returns 0 on success or 1 if any of the given test case filters does not match  any
       test case.

       Additional exit codes may be returned as described in <u><a href="../man1/kyua.1.html">kyua</a></u>(1).
