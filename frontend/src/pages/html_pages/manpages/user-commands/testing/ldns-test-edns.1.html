</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       ldns-test-edns - test if dns cache supports EDNS and DNSSEC.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ldns-test-edns</b> [ <u>-i</u> ] { <u>ip</u> }

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ldns-test-edns</b>  tests a DNS cache and checks if it supports EDNS0 and DNSSEC types so that it can be used
       as a dnssec-enabled DNS cache.  It sends two queries to the cache, one for the root key and one for a  DS
       record.  These must succeed, the answer must have EDNS, that type and signatures.

       If  the  IP address is good for DNSSEC, it is printed with 'OK'.  Otherwise short description is given of
       the failure.  If OK is given, the cache should be good to use as a cache for a  local  configured  DNSSEC
       validator.

       The  tool  assumes the root is signed and Sweden is signed.  Also, the queries are sent with the CD flag,
       the tool does not check that the results are validated, but that they <b>can</b> be validated.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-i</b> option enables a mode where the working  IP  addresses  are  printed  after  another,  with  no  other
       explanations, and if none work or no IP addresses are on the input, 'off' is printed.

       <b>ldns-test-edns</b>  takes  one  or more IP addresses, it checks them in turn.  IPv4 and IPv6 addresses can be
       given.  The exit value is for the last checked IP address: 0 is OK, 1 is  failure,  2  is  some  sort  of
       network failure.
