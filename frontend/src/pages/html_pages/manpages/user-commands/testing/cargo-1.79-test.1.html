       cargo-test — Execute unit and integration tests of a package

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>cargo</b> <b>test</b> [<u>options</u>] [<u>testname</u>] [<b>--</b> <u>test-options</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Compile and execute unit, integration, and documentation tests.

       The test filtering argument <b>TESTNAME</b> and all the arguments following the two dashes (<b>--</b>) are passed to
       the test binaries and thus to <u>libtest</u> (rustc’s built in unit-test and micro-benchmarking framework). If
       you’re passing arguments to both Cargo and the binary, the ones after <b>--</b> go to the binary, the ones
       before go to Cargo. For details about libtest’s arguments see the output of <b>cargo</b> <b>test</b> <b>--</b> <b>--help</b> and
       check out the rustc book’s chapter on how tests work at
       &lt;https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/tests/index.html&gt;.

       As an example, this will filter for tests with <b>foo</b> in their name and run them on 3 threads in parallel:

           cargo test foo -- --test-threads 3

       Tests are built with the <b>--test</b> option to <b>rustc</b> which creates a special executable by linking your code
       with libtest. The executable automatically runs all functions annotated with the <b>#[test]</b> attribute in
       multiple threads. <b>#[bench]</b> annotated functions will also be run with one iteration to verify that they
       are functional.

       If the package contains multiple test targets, each target compiles to a special executable as
       aforementioned, and then is run serially.

       The libtest harness may be disabled by setting <b>harness</b> <b>=</b> <b>false</b> in the target manifest settings, in which
       case your code will need to provide its own <b>main</b> function to handle running tests.

   <b>Documentation</b> <b>tests</b>
       Documentation tests are also run by default, which is handled by <b>rustdoc</b>. It extracts code samples from
       documentation comments of the library target, and then executes them.

       Different from normal test targets, each code block compiles to a doctest executable on the fly with
       <b>rustc</b>. These executables run in parallel in separate processes. The compilation of a code block is in
       fact a part of test function controlled by libtest, so some options such as <b>--jobs</b> might not take effect.
       Note that this execution model of doctests is not guaranteed and may change in the future; beware of
       depending on it.

       See the <u>rustdoc</u> <u>book</u> &lt;https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustdoc/&gt; for more information on writing doc tests.

   <b>Working</b> <b>directory</b> <b>of</b> <b>tests</b>
       The working directory when running each unit and integration test is set to the root directory of the
       package the test belongs to. Setting the working directory of tests to the package’s root directory makes
       it possible for tests to reliably access the package’s files using relative paths, regardless from where
       <b>cargo</b> <b>test</b> was executed from.

       For documentation tests, the working directory when invoking <b>rustdoc</b> is set to the workspace root
       directory, and is also the directory <b>rustdoc</b> uses as the compilation directory of each documentation
       test. The working directory when running each documentation test is set to the root directory of the
       package the test belongs to, and is controlled via <b>rustdoc</b>’s <b>--test-run-directory</b> option.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Test</b> <b>Options</b>
       <b>--no-run</b>
           Compile, but don’t run tests.

       <b>--no-fail-fast</b>
           Run all tests regardless of failure. Without this flag, Cargo will exit after the first executable
           fails. The Rust test harness will run all tests within the executable to completion, this flag only
           applies to the executable as a whole.

   <b>Package</b> <b>Selection</b>
       By default, when no package selection options are given, the packages selected depend on the selected
       manifest file (based on the current working directory if <b>--manifest-path</b> is not given). If the manifest
       is the root of a workspace then the workspaces default members are selected, otherwise only the package
       defined by the manifest will be selected.

       The default members of a workspace can be set explicitly with the <b>workspace.default-members</b> key in the
       root manifest. If this is not set, a virtual workspace will include all workspace members (equivalent to
       passing <b>--workspace</b>), and a non-virtual workspace will include only the root crate itself.

       <b>-p</b> <u>spec</u>…, <b>--package</b> <u>spec</u>…
           Test only the specified packages. See <b><a href="../man1/cargo-pkgid.1.html">cargo-pkgid</a></b>(1) for the SPEC format. This flag may be specified
           multiple times and supports common Unix glob patterns like <b>*</b>, <b>?</b> and <b>[]</b>. However, to avoid your shell
           accidentally expanding glob patterns before Cargo handles them, you must use single quotes or double
           quotes around each pattern.

       <b>--workspace</b>
           Test all members in the workspace.

       <b>--all</b>
           Deprecated alias for <b>--workspace</b>.

       <b>--exclude</b> <u>SPEC</u>…
           Exclude the specified packages. Must be used in conjunction with the <b>--workspace</b> flag. This flag may
           be specified multiple times and supports common Unix glob patterns like <b>*</b>, <b>?</b> and <b>[]</b>. However, to
           avoid your shell accidentally expanding glob patterns before Cargo handles them, you must use single
           quotes or double quotes around each pattern.

   <b>Target</b> <b>Selection</b>
       When no target selection options are given, <b>cargo</b> <b>test</b> will build the following targets of the selected
       packages:

       •  lib — used to link with binaries, examples, integration tests, and doc tests

       •  bins (only if integration tests are built and required features are available)

       •  examples — to ensure they compile

       •  lib as a unit test

       •  bins as unit tests

       •  integration tests

       •  doc tests for the lib target

       The default behavior can be changed by setting the <b>test</b> flag for the target in the manifest settings.
       Setting examples to <b>test</b> <b>=</b> <b>true</b> will build and run the example as a test, replacing the example’s <b>main</b>
       function with the libtest harness. If you don’t want the <b>main</b> function replaced, also include <b>harness</b> <b>=</b>
       <b>false</b>, in which case the example will be built and executed as-is.

       Setting targets to <b>test</b> <b>=</b> <b>false</b> will stop them from being tested by default. Target selection options
       that take a target by name (such as <b>--example</b> <b>foo</b>) ignore the <b>test</b> flag and will always test the given
       target.

       Doc tests for libraries may be disabled by setting <b>doctest</b> <b>=</b> <b>false</b> for the library in the manifest.

       See <u>Configuring</u> <u>a</u> <u>target</u>
       &lt;https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/cargo-targets.html#configuring-a-target&gt; for more information
       on per-target settings.

       Binary targets are automatically built if there is an integration test or benchmark being selected to
       test. This allows an integration test to execute the binary to exercise and test its behavior. The
       <b>CARGO_BIN_EXE_&lt;name&gt;</b> <u>environment</u> <u>variable</u>
       &lt;https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/environment-variables.html#environment-variables-cargo-sets-for-crates&gt;
       is set when the integration test is built so that it can use the <u><b>env</b></u> <u>macro</u>
       &lt;https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.env.html&gt; to locate the executable.

       Passing target selection flags will test only the specified targets.

       Note that <b>--bin</b>, <b>--example</b>, <b>--test</b> and <b>--bench</b> flags also support common Unix glob patterns like <b>*</b>, <b>?</b> and
       <b>[]</b>. However, to avoid your shell accidentally expanding glob patterns before Cargo handles them, you must
       use single quotes or double quotes around each glob pattern.

       <b>--lib</b>
           Test the package’s library.

       <b>--bin</b> <u>name</u>…
           Test the specified binary. This flag may be specified multiple times and supports common Unix glob
           patterns.

       <b>--bins</b>
           Test all binary targets.

       <b>--example</b> <u>name</u>…
           Test the specified example. This flag may be specified multiple times and supports common Unix glob
           patterns.

       <b>--examples</b>
           Test all example targets.

       <b>--test</b> <u>name</u>…
           Test the specified integration test. This flag may be specified multiple times and supports common
           Unix glob patterns.

       <b>--tests</b>
           Test all targets in test mode that have the <b>test</b> <b>=</b> <b>true</b> manifest flag set. By default this includes
           the library and binaries built as unittests, and integration tests. Be aware that this will also
           build any required dependencies, so the lib target may be built twice (once as a unittest, and once
           as a dependency for binaries, integration tests, etc.). Targets may be enabled or disabled by setting
           the <b>test</b> flag in the manifest settings for the target.

       <b>--bench</b> <u>name</u>…
           Test the specified benchmark. This flag may be specified multiple times and supports common Unix glob
           patterns.

       <b>--benches</b>
           Test all targets in benchmark mode that have the <b>bench</b> <b>=</b> <b>true</b> manifest flag set. By default this
           includes the library and binaries built as benchmarks, and bench targets. Be aware that this will
           also build any required dependencies, so the lib target may be built twice (once as a benchmark, and
           once as a dependency for binaries, benchmarks, etc.). Targets may be enabled or disabled by setting
           the <b>bench</b> flag in the manifest settings for the target.

       <b>--all-targets</b>
           Test all targets. This is equivalent to specifying <b>--lib</b> <b>--bins</b> <b>--tests</b> <b>--benches</b> <b>--examples</b>.

       <b>--doc</b>
           Test only the library’s documentation. This cannot be mixed with other target options.

   <b>Feature</b> <b>Selection</b>
       The feature flags allow you to control which features are enabled. When no feature options are given, the
       <b>default</b> feature is activated for every selected package.

       See <u>the</u> <u>features</u> <u>documentation</u>
       &lt;https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/features.html#command-line-feature-options&gt; for more details.

       <b>-F</b> <u>features</u>, <b>--features</b> <u>features</u>
           Space or comma separated list of features to activate. Features of workspace members may be enabled
           with <b>package-name/feature-name</b> syntax. This flag may be specified multiple times, which enables all
           specified features.

       <b>--all-features</b>
           Activate all available features of all selected packages.

       <b>--no-default-features</b>
           Do not activate the <b>default</b> feature of the selected packages.

   <b>Compilation</b> <b>Options</b>
       <b>--target</b> <u>triple</u>
           Test for the given architecture. The default is the host architecture. The general format of the
           triple is <b>&lt;arch&gt;&lt;sub&gt;-&lt;vendor&gt;-&lt;sys&gt;-&lt;abi&gt;</b>. Run <b>rustc</b> <b>--print</b> <b>target-list</b> for a list of supported
           targets. This flag may be specified multiple times.

           This may also be specified with the <b>build.target</b> <u>config</u> <u>value</u>
           &lt;https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html&gt;.

           Note that specifying this flag makes Cargo run in a different mode where the target artifacts are
           placed in a separate directory. See the <u>build</u> <u>cache</u>
           &lt;https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/guide/build-cache.html&gt; documentation for more details.

       <b>-r</b>, <b>--release</b>
           Test optimized artifacts with the <b>release</b> profile. See also the <b>--profile</b> option for choosing a
           specific profile by name.

       <b>--profile</b> <u>name</u>
           Test with the given profile. See <u>the</u> <u>reference</u>
           &lt;https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/profiles.html&gt; for more details on profiles.

       <b>--timings=</b><u>fmts</u>
           Output information how long each compilation takes, and track concurrency information over time.
           Accepts an optional comma-separated list of output formats; <b>--timings</b> without an argument will
           default to <b>--timings=html</b>. Specifying an output format (rather than the default) is unstable and
           requires <b>-Zunstable-options</b>. Valid output formats:

           •  <b>html</b> (unstable, requires <b>-Zunstable-options</b>): Write a human-readable file <b>cargo-timing.html</b> to the
               <b>target/cargo-timings</b> directory with a report of the compilation. Also write a report to the same
               directory with a timestamp in the filename if you want to look at older runs. HTML output is
               suitable for human consumption only, and does not provide machine-readable timing data.

           •  <b>json</b> (unstable, requires <b>-Zunstable-options</b>): Emit machine-readable JSON information about timing
               information.

   <b>Output</b> <b>Options</b>
       <b>--target-dir</b> <u>directory</u>
           Directory for all generated artifacts and intermediate files. May also be specified with the
           <b>CARGO_TARGET_DIR</b> environment variable, or the <b>build.target-dir</b> <u>config</u> <u>value</u>
           &lt;https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html&gt;. Defaults to <b>target</b> in the root of the
           workspace.

   <b>Display</b> <b>Options</b>
       By default the Rust test harness hides output from test execution to keep results readable. Test output
       can be recovered (e.g., for debugging) by passing <b>--nocapture</b> to the test binaries:

           cargo test -- --nocapture

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b>
           Use verbose output. May be specified twice for “very verbose” output which includes extra output such
           as dependency warnings and build script output. May also be specified with the <b>term.verbose</b> <u>config</u>
           <u>value</u> &lt;https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html&gt;.

       <b>-q</b>, <b>--quiet</b>
           Do not print cargo log messages. May also be specified with the <b>term.quiet</b> <u>config</u> <u>value</u>
           &lt;https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html&gt;.

       <b>--color</b> <u>when</u>
           Control when colored output is used. Valid values:

           •  <b>auto</b> (default): Automatically detect if color support is available on the terminal.

           •  <b>always</b>: Always display colors.

           •  <b>never</b>: Never display colors.

           May also be specified with the <b>term.color</b> <u>config</u> <u>value</u>
           &lt;https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html&gt;.

       <b>--message-format</b> <u>fmt</u>
           The output format for diagnostic messages. Can be specified multiple times and consists of
           comma-separated values. Valid values:

           •  <b>human</b> (default): Display in a human-readable text format. Conflicts with <b>short</b> and <b>json</b>.

           •  <b>short</b>: Emit shorter, human-readable text messages. Conflicts with <b>human</b> and <b>json</b>.

           •  <b>json</b>: Emit JSON messages to stdout. See <u>the</u> <u>reference</u>
               &lt;https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/external-tools.html#json-messages&gt; for more details.
               Conflicts with <b>human</b> and <b>short</b>.

           •  <b>json-diagnostic-short</b>: Ensure the <b>rendered</b> field of JSON messages contains the “short” rendering
               from rustc. Cannot be used with <b>human</b> or <b>short</b>.

           •  <b>json-diagnostic-rendered-ansi</b>: Ensure the <b>rendered</b> field of JSON messages contains embedded ANSI
               color codes for respecting rustc’s default color scheme. Cannot be used with <b>human</b> or <b>short</b>.

           •  <b>json-render-diagnostics</b>: Instruct Cargo to not include rustc diagnostics in JSON messages printed,
               but instead Cargo itself should render the JSON diagnostics coming from rustc. Cargo’s own JSON
               diagnostics and others coming from rustc are still emitted. Cannot be used with <b>human</b> or <b>short</b>.

   <b>Manifest</b> <b>Options</b>
       <b>--manifest-path</b> <u>path</u>
           Path to the <b>Cargo.toml</b> file. By default, Cargo searches for the <b>Cargo.toml</b> file in the current
           directory or any parent directory.

       <b>--ignore-rust-version</b>
           Ignore <b>rust-version</b> specification in packages.

       <b>--locked</b>
           Asserts that the exact same dependencies and versions are used as when the existing <b>Cargo.lock</b> file
           was originally generated. Cargo will exit with an error when either of the following scenarios
           arises:

           •  The lock file is missing.

           •  Cargo attempted to change the lock file due to a different dependency resolution.

           It may be used in environments where deterministic builds are desired, such as in CI pipelines.

       <b>--offline</b>
           Prevents Cargo from accessing the network for any reason. Without this flag, Cargo will stop with an
           error if it needs to access the network and the network is not available. With this flag, Cargo will
           attempt to proceed without the network if possible.

           Beware that this may result in different dependency resolution than online mode. Cargo will restrict
           itself to crates that are downloaded locally, even if there might be a newer version as indicated in
           the local copy of the index. See the <b><a href="../man1/cargo-fetch.1.html">cargo-fetch</a></b>(1) command to download dependencies before going
           offline.

           May also be specified with the <b>net.offline</b> <u>config</u> <u>value</u>
           &lt;https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html&gt;.

       <b>--frozen</b>
           Equivalent to specifying both <b>--locked</b> and <b>--offline</b>.

   <b>Common</b> <b>Options</b>
       <b>+</b><u>toolchain</u>
           If Cargo has been installed with rustup, and the first argument to <b>cargo</b> begins with <b>+</b>, it will be
           interpreted as a rustup toolchain name (such as <b>+stable</b> or <b>+nightly</b>). See the <u>rustup</u> <u>documentation</u>
           &lt;https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/overrides.html&gt; for more information about how toolchain
           overrides work.

       <b>--config</b> <u>KEY=VALUE</u> or <u>PATH</u>
           Overrides a Cargo configuration value. The argument should be in TOML syntax of <b>KEY=VALUE</b>, or
           provided as a path to an extra configuration file. This flag may be specified multiple times. See the
           <u>command-line</u> <u>overrides</u> <u>section</u>
           &lt;https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html#command-line-overrides&gt; for more information.

       <b>-C</b> <u>PATH</u>
           Changes the current working directory before executing any specified operations. This affects things
           like where cargo looks by default for the project manifest (<b>Cargo.toml</b>), as well as the directories
           searched for discovering <b>.cargo/config.toml</b>, for example. This option must appear before the command
           name, for example <b>cargo</b> <b>-C</b> <b>path/to/my-project</b> <b>build</b>.

           This option is only available on the <u>nightly</u> <u>channel</u>
           &lt;https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/appendix-07-nightly-rust.html&gt; and requires the <b>-Z</b> <b>unstable-options</b>
           flag to enable (see <u>#10098</u> &lt;https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/10098&gt;).

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
           Prints help information.

       <b>-Z</b> <u>flag</u>
           Unstable (nightly-only) flags to Cargo. Run <b>cargo</b> <b>-Z</b> <b>help</b> for details.

   <b>Miscellaneous</b> <b>Options</b>
       The <b>--jobs</b> argument affects the building of the test executable but does not affect how many threads are
       used when running the tests. The Rust test harness includes an option to control the number of threads
       used:

           cargo test -j 2 -- --test-threads=2

       <b>-j</b> <u>N</u>, <b>--jobs</b> <u>N</u>
           Number of parallel jobs to run. May also be specified with the <b>build.jobs</b> <u>config</u> <u>value</u>
           &lt;https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html&gt;. Defaults to the number of logical CPUs. If
           negative, it sets the maximum number of parallel jobs to the number of logical CPUs plus provided
           value. If a string <b>default</b> is provided, it sets the value back to defaults. Should not be 0.

       <b>--future-incompat-report</b>
           Displays a future-incompat report for any future-incompatible warnings produced during execution of
           this command

           See <b><a href="../man1/cargo-report.1.html">cargo-report</a></b>(1)

       While <b>cargo</b> <b>test</b> involves compilation, it does not provide a <b>--keep-going</b> flag. Use <b>--no-fail-fast</b> to run
       as many tests as possible without stopping at the first failure. To “compile” as many tests as possible,
       use <b>--tests</b> to build test binaries separately. For example:

           cargo build --tests --keep-going
           cargo test --tests --no-fail-fast

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       See <u>the</u> <u>reference</u> &lt;https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/environment-variables.html&gt; for details on
       environment variables that Cargo reads.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       •  <b>0</b>: Cargo succeeded.

       •  <b>101</b>: Cargo failed to complete.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
        1. Execute all the unit and integration tests of the current package:

               cargo test
