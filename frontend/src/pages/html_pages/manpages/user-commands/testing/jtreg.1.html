   <b>Usage:</b>
              jtreg options... tests...

       Tests  can  be given as files or folders containing test files, or by means of test groups. Long lists of
       options and tests may be encapsulated in "at-files".

       Verbose Options

              These options control the amount of output written to the console while running tests

       <b>-v</b> | <b>--v</b>:&lt;value&gt; | <b>-verbose</b> | <b>--verbose</b>:&lt;value&gt;
              Increase the amount of output written to the console. A value, or selected combinations of  values
              separated by commas, may be given to select the type of output desired.

       default
              Three lines of output per test: start, end, status

       summary
              One line of output per test: status, test name

       all    Selected contents of JTR file for all tests (includes stdout/stderr)

       pass   Selected contents of JTR file for passed tests

       fail   Selected contents of JTR file for failed tests

       error  Selected contents of JTR file for errored tests

       nopass Suppress output for tests that passed

       time   Elapsed time per action

       multirun
              Updates for each testsuite when tests from more than one are being executed.

       <b>-v1</b>    Short for <b>-verbose</b>:summary

       <b>-va</b>    Short for <b>-verbose</b>:all

       <b>-ve</b>    Short for <b>-verbose</b>:error

              Specify  additional environment variables to be passed to each test. If a value is not given for a
              name, the current value of the environment variable will be used. Standard environment  variables,
              like DISPLAY, LANG, windir, SystemRoot, etc, will automatically be given to each test, if they are
              set in the current environment.

              Specify how to handle tests containing an @ignore tag.

       quiet  Completely ignore such tests.

       error  (Default.) Execute the actions up to the @ignore tag, then give an "Error" result.

       run    Run the test, as though the @ignore tag were not present.

       <b>-l</b> | <b>-listtests</b>
              List the tests that would be executed instead of executing them.

       <b>-lock</b>:&lt;file&gt;
              Lock  file  to  use  for  tests  in  "exclusive access" directories when running tests in multiple
              concurrent instances of jtreg.

       <b>-noignore</b>
              suppress the effect of any @ignore tags, allowing the test to proceed as if the @ignore tags  were
              not present.  Deprecated: see the <b>-ignore</b> option.

       <b>-nr</b> | <b>-noreport</b>
              Do not generate a final report.

       <b>-o</b>:&lt;classname&gt; | <b>-observer</b>:&lt;classname&gt;
              Specifies  the  class to observe the progress of a test suite; the class must implement a specific
              interface; contact a developer for details. For example, <b>-o</b>:SampleRegressionObserver

       <b>-od</b>:&lt;path&gt; | <b>-observerDir</b>:&lt;path&gt; | <b>-op</b>:&lt;path&gt; | <b>-observerPath</b>:&lt;path&gt;
              Specifies the pathname of a directory or .jar file in which the observer  class  is  located.  The
              given  pathname  is simply appended to the CLASSPATH used for the tests, thus care should be taken
              when naming an observer not to collide with the names of classes internal to the JavaTest  harness
              or the JRE. For example, put the observer class in its own named package.

       <b>-r</b>:&lt;directory&gt; | <b>-reportDir</b>:&lt;directory&gt;
              All report files placed here; "./JTreport" is default

       <b>-report</b>:&lt;value&gt;
              Configure the report generated after tests are run.

       none   Do not generate a report; equivalent to <b>-noreport</b>.

       executed
              Include tests executed in the latest run

       files  Include all tests specified by groups and paths on the command line, ignoring filters like status,
              exclude lists, and keywords.

       all-executed
              Include all tests that have been executed in current work directory

       all    Include all tests that are present in the test suite, whether they have been executed

       <b>-retain</b> | <b>--retain</b>:&lt;none,lastRun,pass,fail,error,all,file-pattern&gt;,...
              Specify  files  to be retained after each test completes executing. If <b>-retain</b> is not specified or
              is specified with lastRun, only the files from the last test executed will  be  retained,  in  the
              test's scratch directory. For all other uses of <b>-retain</b>, files will be retained in a test-specific
              directory  in  the  work-directory.  If  <b>-retain</b>  is specified with no argument, all files will be
              retained. Otherwise, the files may be described by one or more of the following values:

       none   Do not retain any of the files generated by each test

       lastRun
              Retain files generated by the last test that was run (default)

       pass   Retain files generated by tests that pass

       fail   Retain files generated by tests that fail

       error  Retain files generated by tests that caused an error

       all    Retain all files generated by each test

       file-pattern
              Retain files that match a specific filename. The name may contain '*' to  match  any  sequence  of
              characters. For example, result.* or *.err.

       <b>-ro</b> | <b>-reportOnly</b>
              Generate  report  for  previously executed tests. This does not re-run any tests. A work directory
              containing the results of the executed tests must be provided. The default location is "./JTwork".
              To specify an alternate directory, use <b>-workDir</b>.

       <b>-show</b>:[&lt;section-name&gt;/]&lt;stream-name&gt;
              Show the contents of a stream in a specific section or in all sections of the results file  for  a
              test.  The  content  is  shown  as  originally  written to the stream: that is, without the escape
              encoding used in the .jtr file. If no section name is given, the output for the  named  stream  in
              all sections is shown.  For example, <b>-show</b>:rerun <b>-show</b>:main/System.out

       <b>-showGroups</b>
              Show  the expansion (to files and directories) of the groups given on the command line. To see the
              expansion of all the groups in a test suite, specify the name of the test suite.

       <b>-startHttpd</b>
              Start the http server to view test results

       <b>-ttf</b>:&lt;classname&gt; | <b>-testThreadFactory</b>:&lt;classname&gt;
              Specifies the class to create thread factory for test execution. The class  should  implement  the
              java.util.concurrent.ThreadFactory interface.

       <b>-ttfp</b>:&lt;path&gt; | <b>-testThreadFactoryPath</b>:&lt;path&gt;
              Specifies  classspath  for  custom  test  thread  factory  implementation.  The  classes from this
              classpath are loaded by tested JDK only using URLClassLoader.

       <b>-w</b>:&lt;directory&gt; | <b>-workDir</b>:&lt;directory&gt;
              Location for .class files, .jtr files, etc. "./JTwork" is default

       <b>-wsl</b>   (Windows only) Use the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) to run shell tests

       <b>-xml</b> | <b>--xml</b>:verify
              Create ant/junit xml files into the workDir. Optionally verify if the file is well-formed.

       Timeout Options

              These options control the behavior when tests run longer than their specified timeout value.

       <b>-th</b>:&lt;classname&gt; | <b>-timeoutHandler</b>:&lt;classname&gt;
              Specifies     the     class     to     handle     timeouts.     The     class     must      extend
              com.sun.javatest.regtest.TimeoutHandler. For example, <b>-th</b>:MyHandler

       <b>-thd</b>:&lt;path&gt; | <b>-timeoutHandlerDir</b>:&lt;path&gt;
              Specifies  the pathname of a directory or .jar file in which the timeout handler class is located.
              The given pathname is simply appended to the CLASSPATH used for the tests,  thus  care  should  be
              taken  when  naming  a  timeout  handler  not to collide with the names of classes internal to the
              JavaTest harness or the JRE. For example, put the timeout handler class in its own named package.

       <b>-thtimeout</b>:&lt;#seconds&gt; | <b>-timeoutHandlerTimeout</b>:&lt;#seconds&gt;
              Specifies execution time limitation for the timeout handler.  If  the  timeout  handler  does  not
              finish  its  actions  within  the  specified period of time, it will be interrupted.  Non-positive
              values mean no limitation. The default value is 5 minutes (300 seconds).

       <b>-timeout</b>:&lt;number&gt; | <b>-timeoutFactor</b>:&lt;number&gt;
              A scaling factor to extend the default timeout of all tests.  Typically used when running tests on
              slow systems or systems with slow file systems.

       <b>-tl</b>:&lt;#seconds&gt; | <b>-timelimit</b>:&lt;#seconds&gt;
              Do not run tests which specify a timeout longer than a given value. The comparison is done against
              any values specified in the test, before any timeout factor is applied.

       Agent Pool Options

              Options to configure the size of the pool of VMs used to execute tests in agent mode.

       <b>--agent-attempts</b> &lt;number&gt;
              The number of attempts jtreg will make to access an agent with the desired characteristics, either
              by creating a new one, or obtaining one from the pool of reusable VMs. The minimum value, and  the
              default value, is 1.

       <b>--max-pool-size</b> &lt;number&gt;
              The  maximum  number  of  VMs  to  keep  available in the agent pool. The default is either 2x the
              concurrency.

       <b>--pool-idle-timeout</b> &lt;number&gt;
              The time, in seconds, before an idle VM in the pool is automatically closed.

       Test Selection Options

              These options can be used to refine the set of tests to be executed.

       <b>-a</b> | <b>-automatic</b> | <b>-automagic</b>
              Any test with <u>/manual</u> will not be run

       <b>-bug</b>:&lt;bugid&gt;
              Run only those tests which apply to the given bugid.

       <b>-exclude</b>:&lt;file&gt; | <b>-Xexclude</b>:&lt;file&gt;
              Provide a file specifying tests that should not be run

       <b>-k</b>:&lt;keywordExpr&gt; | <b>-keywords</b>:&lt;keywordExpr&gt;
              A keyword boolean expression for  test  selection.  The  expression  can  contain  keyword  names,
              combined with &amp; (and), | (or), ! (not) and parentheses.

       <b>-m</b> | <b>-manual</b>
              Only tests with <u>/manual</u> will be run

       <b>-match</b>:&lt;file&gt;
              Provide a file specifying tests that can be run (inverse of <b>-exclude</b>)

       <b>-noshell</b>
              Any tests which contain shell actions will not be run

       <b>-shell</b> Only tests which contain shell actions will be run

       <b>-status</b>:&lt;value&gt;,...
              Select  tests  according  to  their result in an earlier run.  The value can be one or more of the
              following values, separated by commas.

       pass   Tests that passed

       fail   Tests that failed

       notRun Tests that have not been run

       error  Tests that could not be run because of errors, or tests that were ignored

       Test Mode Options

              Each test consists of a series of steps, called actions.  The  jtreg  harness  provides  different
              modes, which determine the JVM to use to execute each action. The default is to run each action in
              a new JVM.

       <b>-avm</b> | <b>-agentvm</b> | <b>-s</b> | <b>-svm</b> | <b>-samevm</b>
              Execute  each  action using a pool of reusable JVMs, except when an action specifies otherwise. It
              provides good performance, and reasonable isolation between actions: if a JVM can be  reset  to  a
              standard  state  after  it has been used, it will be returned to the pool for reuse; otherwise, it
              will be discarded and replaced if and when necessary. This mode is generally recommended  for  all
              use.   The  JDK  to use can be specified with <b>-testjdk</b> or <b>-jdk</b>, except for @compile actions, which
              use <b>-compilejdk</b> or <b>-jdk</b>.  If values are not provided, the environment variable JAVA_HOME is used.

       <b>-ovm</b> | <b>-othervm</b>
              Execute every action in a new JVM. This is the default. It provides the maximum isolation  between
              actions,  at  a significant cost in performance.  The JDK to use can be specified with <b>-testjdk</b> or
              <b>-jdk</b>, except for @compile actions, which use <b>-compilejdk</b> or <b>-jdk</b>.  If values are not provided, the
              environment variable JAVA_HOME is used.

       JDK-related Options

              By default, tests will be run using the default JVM in the test JDK. You can pass  all  applicable
              JVM options via using <b>-vmoption</b>; in addition, many common JVM options are also supported directly.
              For  full  details  of  any  option, consult the documentation for that version of the JDK, or try
              using "java <b>-help</b>" or "java <b>-X</b>". If an option is not applicable to a particular  platform  or  JDK
              release, it will be rejected.

       <b>--add-modules</b> &lt;module&gt;(,&lt;module&gt;)*
              root modules to resolve in addition to the initial module

       <b>-agentlib</b>:&lt;libname&gt;&lt;[=&lt;options&gt;]
              Load native agent library

       <b>-agentpath</b>:&lt;pathname&gt;&lt;[=&lt;options&gt;]
              Load native agent library by full pathname

       <b>-classic</b> | <b>-green</b> | <b>-native</b> | <b>-hotspot</b> | <b>-client</b> | <b>-server</b> | <b>-d32</b> | <b>-d64</b>
              VM Options

       <b>-compilejdk</b>:&lt;java.home&gt;
              Compile  all  tests using specified JDK. If not specified, tests are compiled with the JDK used to
              run the tests. See also <b>-jdk</b>. For example, <b>-jdk</b>:/usr/local/java/jdk1.5/solaris-sparc

       <b>-cpa</b>:&lt;path&gt; | <b>-classpathappend</b>:&lt;path&gt;
              Append the provided classPath to the CLASSPATH  of  every  test.  This  is  designed  to  be  used
              primarily for tests which require non-core JDK functionality. For example, to test Swing, which is
              not   part  of  core  JDK1.1,  the  following  addition  to  the  CLASSPATH  would  be  necessary:
              <b>-cpa</b>:/usr/local/java/swing-1.0.3/swingall.jar

       <b>-D</b>&lt;name&gt;=&lt;value&gt;
              Define a system property

       <b>-debug</b>:&lt;option&gt;...
              Use this to specify VM options to attach a debugger to a VM running  a  test.  It  is  similar  to
              <b>-vmoptions</b>  except  that it is not used when starting VMs used to query the properties of that VM.
              Any timeout for a test is automatically disabled when this option is used. See  also  <b>-javaoptions</b>
              and <b>-vmoptions</b>.

       <b>-enableassertions</b> | <b>--enableassertions</b>:* | <b>-ea</b> | <b>--ea</b>:* | <b>-disableassertions</b>

       | <b>--disableassertions</b>:* | <b>-da</b> | <b>--da</b>:*
              Enable or disable assertions

       <b>-enablesystemassertions</b> | <b>-esa</b> | <b>-disablesystemassertions</b> | <b>-dsa</b>
              Enable or disable system assertions

       <b>-javaagent</b>:&lt;jarpath&gt;&lt;[=&lt;options&gt;]
              Load Java programming language agent

       <b>-javacoption</b>:&lt;option&gt;
              Additional  compiler  option. You can give this option multiple times. Any embedded filenames must
              be given with absolute paths.

       <b>-javacoptions</b>:&lt;option&gt;...
              Additional compiler options. You can  give  this  option  multiple  times,  or  give  many  values
              together,  separated  by  spaces.  If  you  give  multiple values, you may need to enclose them in
              quotes, depending on the shell you use. Any embedded filenames must be given with absolute  paths.
              Warning:  do not use this form if any of the options has an argument such as a filename that might
              contain spaces. In that case, use one or more <b>-javacoption</b> options instead.

       <b>-javaoption</b>:&lt;option&gt;
              Additional java option for running test classes. You can give  this  option  multiple  times.  Any
              embedded filenames must be given with absolute paths. See also <b>-vmoption</b>.

       <b>-javaoptions</b>:&lt;option&gt;...
              Additional java options for running test classes. You can give this option multiple times, or give
              many  values  together,  separated by spaces. If you give multiple values, you may need to enclose
              them in quotes, depending on the shell you use. Any embedded filenames must be given with absolute
              paths. Warning: do not use this form if any of the options has an argument such as a filename that
              might contain spaces. In that case,  use  one  or  more  <b>-javaoption</b>  options  instead.  See  also

              depending on the shell you use. Any embedded filenames must be given with absolute paths. Warning:
              do not use this form if any of the options has an argument such as a filename that  might  contain
              spaces.  In  that  case,  use  one or more <b>-vmption</b> options instead. This option will be used when

       Tests  Specifying collections of tests.

       at-files
              Long lists of options and tests may be encapsulated in "at-files". Place the options and/or  tests
              in  a  file and specify the name of the file on the command line with @file. Options or tests that
              include white space should be enclosed within either single or double quote  characters.  Comments
              may be included in the file by prefixing them with '#'. To specify an option beginning with '@' on
              the command line, use "@@" to avoid @file expansion.

       Tests  Specifying collections of tests.

       Groups A  test  suite  may  define  named groups of tests. To specify the name of a group of tests on the
              command line, use test-suite-dir:group-name, where test-suite-dir is a path to the root  directory
              of  the test suite (that is, the directory containing the TEST.ROOT file), and where group-name is
              the name of the group of tests defined in the test suite. If test-suite-dir is omitted it defaults
              to the value of the <b>-dir</b> option, if given, or to  the  current  directory  otherwise.   (Note:  on
              Windows,   to  avoid  confusion  with  absolute  path  names  including  a  drive  specifier,  the
              test-suite-dir must not be specified with a relative path consisting of a single letter.)

       Groups are defined in a test suite using one or more
              Java properties files. The names of these files must be listed in the "groups" entry in TEST.ROOT.
              If the filename is enclosed in square brackets, no error message will be given if the file  cannot
              be  found.   Within the property files, each entry specifies items to be included or excluded from
              the group. To include a test or directory of tests,  simply  specify  the  name  of  the  test  or
              directory.  To  exclude  a test or directory of tests, use '-' followed by the name of the test or
              directory. To include the contents of another group, use ':' followed by the name  of  the  group.
              There must be no spaces between the "-" or ":" and the name that follows.

       Summary
              The  following  kinds  of arguments can be used to specify tests to be executed.In these examples,
              square brackets are used to indicate optional parts.

       directory
              All tests found in and under the given directory.

       file[#id][?string]
              Either all tests in the given file if no id is given, or the specified test if an id is  given.  A
              file  contains multiple tests if there are multiple test descriptions, in separate comment blocks.
              If '?string' is specified, the string will be passed to the test so that it may filter  the  parts
              of  the test to be executed. The string will typically be the name of a method to be executed.  If
              conflicting values for the string are given for a specific test, the last one given will be used.

       [path]:group-name
              A group of tests, as defined in the TEST.groups file in the testsuite root  directory.  If  given,
              path  specifies  the  testsuite root directory. If not given, it defaults to the one enclosing the
              current directory.

       @file  A file containing values to be treated as if on the command-line.
