</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       lit - LLVM Integrated Tester

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>lit</b> [<u>options</u>] [<u>tests</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>lit</b>  is  a  portable  tool for executing LLVM and Clang style test suites, summarizing their results, and
       providing indication of failures.  <b>lit</b> is designed to be a lightweight testing tool with as simple a user
       interface as possible.

       <b>lit</b> should be run with one or more <u>tests</u> to run specified on the  command  line.   Tests  can  be  either
       individual test files or directories to search for tests (see <u>TEST</u> <u>DISCOVERY</u>).

       Each specified test will be executed (potentially concurrently) and once all tests have been run <b>lit</b> will
       print  summary  information on the number of tests which passed or failed (see <u>TEST</u> <u>STATUS</u> <u>RESULTS</u>).  The
       <b>lit</b> program will execute with a non-zero exit code if any tests fail.

       By default <b>lit</b> will use a succinct progress display and will only  print  summary  information  for  test
       failures.  See <u>OUTPUT</u> <u>OPTIONS</u> for options controlling the <b>lit</b> progress display and output.

       <b>lit</b>  also  includes  a  number  of  options for controlling how tests are executed (specific features may
       depend on the particular test format).  See <u>EXECUTION</u> <u>OPTIONS</u> for more information.

       Finally, <b>lit</b> also supports additional options for only running a subset of the options specified  on  the
       command line, see <u>SELECTION</u> <u>OPTIONS</u> for more information.

       <b>lit</b>  parses  options  from the environment variable <b>LIT_OPTS</b> after parsing options from the command line.
       <b>LIT_OPTS</b> is primarily useful for supplementing or overriding the command-line options supplied to <b>lit</b>  by
       <b>check</b> targets defined by a project’s build system.

       Users  interested  in  the  <b>lit</b>  architecture  or  designing  a <b>lit</b> testing implementation should see <u>LIT</u>
       <u>INFRASTRUCTURE</u>.

</pre><h4><b>GENERAL</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-h,</b> <b>--help</b>
              Show the <b>lit</b> help message.

       <b>-j</b> <b>N,</b> <b>--workers=N</b>
              Run <b>N</b> tests in parallel.  By default, this is automatically chosen to match the number of detected
              available CPUs.

       <b>--config-prefix=NAME</b>
              Search for <u>NAME</u><b>.cfg</b> and <u>NAME</u><b>.site.cfg</b> when searching for  test  suites,  instead  of  <b>lit.cfg</b>  and
              <b>lit.site.cfg</b>.

       <b>-D</b> <b>NAME[=VALUE],</b> <b>--param</b> <b>NAME[=VALUE]</b>
              Add  a  user  defined parameter <b>NAME</b> with the given <b>VALUE</b> (or the empty string if not given).  The
              meaning and use of these parameters is test suite dependent.

</pre><h4><b>OUTPUT</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-q,</b> <b>--quiet</b>
              Suppress any output except for test failures.

       <b>-s,</b> <b>--succinct</b>
              Show less output, for example don’t show information on tests that pass.   Also  show  a  progress
              bar, unless <b>--no-progress-bar</b> is specified.

       <b>-v,</b> <b>--verbose</b>
              Show  more  information  on  test failures, for example the entire test output instead of just the
              test result.

       <b>-vv,</b> <b>--echo-all-commands</b>
              Echo all commands to stdout, as they are being executed.  This can be valuable for debugging  test
              failures,  as  the  last  echoed command will be the one which has failed.  <b>lit</b> normally inserts a
              no-op command (<b>:</b> in the case of bash) with argument <b>'RUN:</b> <b>at</b> <b>line</b> <b>N'</b> before each command pipeline,
              and this option also causes those no-op commands to be echoed to stdout to  help  you  locate  the
              source line of the failed command.  This option implies <b>--verbose</b>.

       <b>-a,</b> <b>--show-all</b>
              Show more information about all tests, for example the entire test commandline and output.

       <b>--no-progress-bar</b>
              Do not use curses based progress bar.

       <b>--show-unsupported</b>
              Show the names of unsupported tests.

       <b>--show-xfail</b>
              Show the names of tests that were expected to fail.

</pre><h4><b>EXECUTION</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--path=PATH</b>
              Specify an additional <b>PATH</b> to use when searching for executables in tests.

       <b>--vg</b>   Run  individual tests under valgrind (using the memcheck tool).  The <b>--error-exitcode</b> argument for
              valgrind is used so that valgrind failures will cause the program to exit with a non-zero status.

              When this option is enabled, <b>lit</b> will also automatically provide a “<b>valgrind</b>” feature that can  be
              used to conditionally disable (or expect failure in) certain tests.

       <b>--vg-arg=ARG</b>
              When <u>--vg</u> is used, specify an additional argument to pass to <b>valgrind</b> itself.

       <b>--vg-leak</b>
              When  <u>--vg</u>  is  used,  enable  memory  leak  checks.   When  this option is enabled, <b>lit</b> will also
              automatically provide a “<b>vg_leak</b>” feature that can be used to  conditionally  disable  (or  expect
              failure in) certain tests.

       <b>--time-tests</b>
              Track  the  wall  time  individual  tests  take to execute and includes the results in the summary
              output.  This is useful for determining which tests in a test suite take the most time to execute.

       <b>--ignore-fail</b>
              Exit with status zero even if some tests fail.

       <b>--no-indirectly-run-check</b>
              Do not error if a test would not be run if the user had specified the containing directory instead
              of naming the test directly.

</pre><h4><b>SELECTION</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       By default, <u>lit</u> will run failing tests first, then run  tests  in  descending  execution  time  order  to
       optimize concurrency.  The execution order can be changed using the <u>--order</u> option.

       The  timing  data  is stored in the <u>test_exec_root</u> in a file named <u>.lit_test_times.txt</u>. If this file does
       not exist, then <u>lit</u> checks the <u>test_source_root</u> for the file to optionally accelerate clean builds.

       <b>--shuffle</b>
              Run the tests in a random order, not failing/slowest first. Deprecated, use <u>--order</u> instead.

       <b>--max-failures</b> <b>N</b>
              Stop execution after the given number <b>N</b> of failures.  An integer argument should be passed on  the
              command line prior to execution.

       <b>--max-tests=N</b>
              Run at most <b>N</b> tests and then terminate.

       <b>--max-time=N</b>
              Spend  at  most <b>N</b> seconds (approximately) running tests and then terminate.  Note that this is not
              an alias for <u>--timeout</u>; the two are different kinds of maximums.

       <b>--num-shards=M</b>
              Divide the set of selected tests into <b>M</b> equal-sized subsets or “shards”, and run only one of them.
              Must be used with the <b>--run-shard=N</b> option, which  selects  the  shard  to  run.  The  environment
              variable  <b>LIT_NUM_SHARDS</b>  can  also  be  used in place of this option. These two options provide a
              coarse mechanism for partitioning large testsuites, for parallel execution  on  separate  machines
              (say in a large testing farm).

       <b>--order={lexical,random,smart}</b>
              Define the order in which tests are run. The supported values are:

              • lexical  -  tests  will  be run in lexical order according to the test file path. This option is
                useful when predictable test order is desired.

              • random - tests will be run in random order.

              • smart - tests that failed previously will be  run  first,  then  the  remaining  tests,  all  in
                descending execution time order. This is the default as it optimizes concurrency.

       <b>--run-shard=N</b>
              Select  which  shard to run, assuming the <b>--num-shards=M</b> option was provided. The two options must
              be used together, and the value of  <b>N</b>  must  be  in  the  range  <b>1..M</b>.  The  environment  variable
              <b>LIT_RUN_SHARD</b> can also be used in place of this option.

       <b>--timeout=N</b>
              Spend  at most <b>N</b> seconds (approximately) running each individual test.  <b>0</b> means no time limit, and
              <b>0</b> is the default. Note that this is not an alias for <u>--max-time</u>; the two are  different  kinds  of
              maximums.

       <b>--filter=REGEXP</b>
              Run  only  those  tests  whose  name  matches  the  regular  expression  specified  in <b>REGEXP</b>. The
              environment variable <b>LIT_FILTER</b> can be also used in place of  this  option,  which  is  especially
              useful in environments where the call to <b>lit</b> is issued indirectly.

       <b>--filter-out=REGEXP</b>
              Filter  out  those  tests  whose  name  matches  the  regular  expression specified in <b>REGEXP</b>. The
              environment variable <b>LIT_FILTER_OUT</b> can be also used in place of this option, which is  especially
              useful in environments where the call to <b>lit</b> is issued indirectly.

       <b>--xfail=LIST</b>
              Treat those tests whose name is in the semicolon separated list <b>LIST</b> as <b>XFAIL</b>. This can be helpful
              when  one  does  not want to modify the test suite. The environment variable <b>LIT_XFAIL</b> can be also
              used in place of this option, which is especially useful in environments where the call to <b>lit</b>  is
              issued indirectly.

              A test name can specified as a file name relative to the test suite directory.  For example:

                 LIT_XFAIL="affinity/kmp-hw-subset.c;offloading/memory_manager.cpp"

              In this case, all of the following tests are treated as <b>XFAIL</b>:

                 libomp :: affinity/kmp-hw-subset.c
                 libomptarget :: nvptx64-nvidia-cuda :: offloading/memory_manager.cpp
                 libomptarget :: x86_64-pc-linux-gnu :: offloading/memory_manager.cpp

              Alternatively,  a  test  name  can be specified as the full test name reported in LIT output.  For
              example, we can adjust the previous example  not  to  treat  the  <b>nvptx64-nvidia-cuda</b>  version  of
              <b>offloading/memory_manager.cpp</b> as XFAIL:

                 LIT_XFAIL="affinity/kmp-hw-subset.c;libomptarget :: x86_64-pc-linux-gnu :: offloading/memory_manager.cpp"

       <b>--xfail-not=LIST</b>
              Do  not  treat  the  specified tests as <b>XFAIL</b>.  The environment variable <b>LIT_XFAIL_NOT</b> can also be
              used in place of this option.  The syntax is the same as for <u>--xfail</u> and  <b>LIT_XFAIL</b>.   <u>--xfail-not</u>
              and  <b>LIT_XFAIL_NOT</b>  always override all other <b>XFAIL</b> specifications, including an <u>--xfail</u> appearing
              later on the command line.  The primary purpose is to suppress an <b>XPASS</b> result without modifying a
              test case that uses the <b>XFAIL</b> directive.

</pre><h4><b>ADDITIONAL</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--debug</b>
              Run <b>lit</b> in debug mode, for debugging configuration issues and <b>lit</b> itself.

       <b>--show-suites</b>
              List the discovered test suites and exit.

       <b>--show-tests</b>
              List all of the discovered tests and exit.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>lit</b> will exit with an exit code of 1 if there are any FAIL or XPASS results.   Otherwise,  it  will  exit
       with  the status 0.  Other exit codes are used for non-test related failures (for example a user error or
       an internal program error).

</pre><h4><b>TEST</b> <b>DISCOVERY</b></h4><pre>
       The inputs passed to <b>lit</b> can be either individual tests, or entire directories or hierarchies of tests to
       run.  When <b>lit</b> starts up, the first thing it does is convert the inputs into a complete list of tests  to
       run as part of <u>test</u> <u>discovery</u>.

       In the <b>lit</b> model, every test must exist inside some <u>test</u> <u>suite</u>.  <b>lit</b> resolves the inputs specified on the
       command  line  to  test  suites  by  searching  upwards  from  the input path until it finds a <b>lit.cfg</b> or
       <b>lit.site.cfg</b> file.  These files serve as both a marker of test suites and as  configuration  files  which
       <b>lit</b> loads in order to understand how to find and run the tests inside the test suite.

       Once  <b>lit</b>  has  mapped  the  inputs  into  test  suites  it traverses the list of inputs adding tests for
       individual files and recursively searching for tests in directories.

       This behavior makes it easy to specify a subset of tests to run, while  still  allowing  the  test  suite
       configuration  to control exactly how tests are interpreted.  In addition, <b>lit</b> always identifies tests by
       the test suite they are in, and their relative path inside the test suite.  For appropriately  configured
       projects, this allows <b>lit</b> to provide convenient and flexible support for out-of-tree builds.

</pre><h4><b>TEST</b> <b>STATUS</b> <b>RESULTS</b></h4><pre>
       Each test ultimately produces one of the following eight results:

       <b>PASS</b>
          The test succeeded.

       <b>FLAKYPASS</b>
          The  test  succeeded  after  being  re-run  more  than  once. This only applies to tests containing an
          <b>ALLOW_RETRIES:</b> annotation.

       <b>XFAIL</b>
          The test failed, but that is expected.  This is used for test formats which allow  specifying  that  a
          test does not currently work, but wish to leave it in the test suite.

       <b>XPASS</b>
          The  test  succeeded,  but  it  was  expected to fail.  This is used for tests which were specified as
          expected to fail, but are now succeeding (generally because the feature they test was broken  and  has
          been fixed).

       <b>FAIL</b>
          The test failed.

       <b>UNRESOLVED</b>
          The test result could not be determined.  For example, this occurs when the test could not be run, the
          test itself is invalid, or the test was interrupted.

       <b>UNSUPPORTED</b>
          The  test  is  not  supported  in  this  environment.   This  is used by test formats which can report
          unsupported tests.

       <b>TIMEOUT</b>
          The test was run, but it timed out before it was able to complete. This is considered a failure.

       Depending on the test format tests may produce additional information about their status (generally  only
       for failures).  See the <u>OUTPUT</u> <u>OPTIONS</u> section for more information.

</pre><h4><b>LIT</b> <b>INFRASTRUCTURE</b></h4><pre>
       This  section  describes  the <b>lit</b> testing architecture for users interested in creating a new <b>lit</b> testing
       implementation, or extending an existing one.

       <b>lit</b> proper is primarily an infrastructure for discovering and running arbitrary tests, and  to  expose  a
       single  convenient  interface to these tests. <b>lit</b> itself doesn’t know how to run tests, rather this logic
       is defined by <u>test</u> <u>suites</u>.

   <b>TEST</b> <b>SUITES</b>
       As described in <u>TEST</u> <u>DISCOVERY</u>, tests are always located inside a  <u>test</u>  <u>suite</u>.   Test  suites  serve  to
       define  the  format  of  the  tests  they  contain, the logic for finding those tests, and any additional
       information to run the tests.

       <b>lit</b>  identifies  test  suites  as  directories  containing  <b>lit.cfg</b>  or  <b>lit.site.cfg</b>  files  (see   also
       <u>--config-prefix</u>).   Test  suites  are  initially  discovered  by  recursively  searching up the directory
       hierarchy for all the input files passed on the command line.  You can use <u>--show-suites</u> to  display  the
       discovered test suites at startup.

       Once  a  test suite is discovered, its config file is loaded.  Config files themselves are Python modules
       which will be executed.  When the config file is executed, two important global variables are predefined:

       <b>lit_config</b>
          The global <b>lit</b> configuration object (a <u>LitConfig</u> instance), which defines the  builtin  test  formats,
          global configuration parameters, and other helper routines for implementing test configurations.

       <b>config</b>
          This  is  the  config  object  (a <u>TestingConfig</u> instance) for the test suite, which the config file is
          expected to populate.  The following variables are also available on the <u>config</u> object, some of  which
          must be set by the config and others are optional or predefined:

          <b>name</b> <u>[required]</u> The name of the test suite, for use in reports and diagnostics.

          <b>test_format</b> <u>[required]</u> The test format object which will be used to discover and run tests in the test
          suite.  Generally this will be a builtin test format available from the <u>lit.formats</u> module.

          <b>test_source_root</b>  The  filesystem  path  to  the  test  suite root.  For out-of-dir builds this is the
          directory that will be scanned for tests.

          <b>test_exec_root</b> For out-of-dir builds, the path to the test suite root  inside  the  object  directory.
          This is where tests will be run and temporary output files placed.

          <b>environment</b> A dictionary representing the environment to use when executing tests in the suite.

          <b>standalone_tests</b>  When true, mark a directory with tests expected to be run standalone. Test discovery
          is  disabled  for  that  directory  and  <u>–no-indirectly-run-check</u>  is  in  effect.  <u>lit.suffixes</u>   and
          <u>lit.excludes</u> must be empty when this variable is true.

          <b>suffixes</b> For <b>lit</b> test formats which scan directories for tests, this variable is a list of suffixes to
          identify test files.  Used by: <u>ShTest</u>.

          <b>substitutions</b>  For  <b>lit</b>  test  formats  which  substitute  variables  into  a test script, the list of
          substitutions to perform.  Used by: <u>ShTest</u>.

          <b>unsupported</b> Mark an unsupported directory, all tests within it will be reported as unsupported.   Used
          by: <u>ShTest</u>.

          <b>parent</b>  The  parent  configuration,  this  is  the config object for the directory containing the test
          suite, or None.

          <b>root</b> The root configuration.  This is the top-most <b>lit</b> configuration in the project.

          <b>pipefail</b> Normally a test using a shell pipe fails if any of the commands on the pipe fail. If this  is
          not  desired,  setting this variable to false makes the test fail only if the last command in the pipe
          fails.

          <b>available_features</b> A set of features that can be used in <u>XFAIL</u>, <u>REQUIRES</u>, and <u>UNSUPPORTED</u> directives.

   <b>TEST</b> <b>DISCOVERY</b>
       Once test suites are located, <b>lit</b> recursively traverses the source directory (following <u>test_source_root</u>)
       looking for tests.  When <b>lit</b> enters a sub-directory, it first checks to see if a  nested  test  suite  is
       defined  in  that  directory.   If  so, it loads that test suite recursively, otherwise it instantiates a
       local test config for the directory (see <u>LOCAL</u> <u>CONFIGURATION</u> <u>FILES</u>).

       Tests are identified by the test suite they are contained within,  and  the  relative  path  inside  that
       suite.   Note  that the relative path may not refer to an actual file on disk; some test formats (such as
       <u>GoogleTest</u>) define “virtual tests” which have a path that contains both the path to the actual test  file
       and a subpath to identify the virtual test.

   <b>LOCAL</b> <b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>FILES</b>
       When  <b>lit</b> loads a subdirectory in a test suite, it instantiates a local test configuration by cloning the
       configuration for the parent directory — the root of this configuration  chain  will  always  be  a  test
       suite.   Once  the  test configuration is cloned <b>lit</b> checks for a <u>lit.local.cfg</u> file in the subdirectory.
       If present, this file will be loaded and can be used to specialize the configuration for each  individual
       directory.   This  facility  can  be  used to define subdirectories of optional tests, or to change other
       configuration parameters — for example, to change the test format, or the suffixes  which  identify  test
       files.

   <b>SUBSTITUTIONS</b>
       <b>lit</b>  allows  patterns  to  be substituted inside RUN commands. It also provides the following base set of
       substitutions, which are defined in TestRunner.py:
                           ┌─────────────────────────┬───────────────────────────────────────┐
                           │ Macro                   │ Substitution                          │

       Other  substitutions  are provided that are variations on this base set and further substitution patterns
       can be defined by each test module. See the modules <u>LOCAL</u> <u>CONFIGURATION</u> <u>FILES</u>.

       By default, substitutions are expanded exactly once, so that if e.g. a substitution <b>%build</b> is defined  in
       top  of  another  substitution  <b>%cxx</b>,  <b>%build</b> will expand to <b>%cxx</b> textually, not to what <b>%cxx</b> expands to.
       However, if the <b>recursiveExpansionLimit</b> property of the <b>TestingConfig</b> is set to a  non-negative  integer,
       substitutions  will  be  expanded recursively until that limit is reached. It is an error if the limit is
       reached and expanding substitutions again would yield a different result.

       More detailed information on substitutions can be found in the <u>LLVM</u> <u>Testing</u> <u>Infrastructure</u> <u>Guide</u>.

   <b>TEST</b> <b>RUN</b> <b>OUTPUT</b> <b>FORMAT</b>
       The <b>lit</b> output for a test run conforms to the following schema, in both short and verbose modes (although
       in short mode no PASS lines will be shown).  This schema  has  been  chosen  to  be  relatively  easy  to
       reliably parse by a machine (for example in buildbot log scraping), and for other tools to generate.

       Each test result is expected to appear on a line that matches:

          &lt;result code&gt;: &lt;test name&gt; (&lt;progress info&gt;)

       where  <b>&lt;result-code&gt;</b>  is  a  standard  test  result  such  as  PASS,  FAIL,  XFAIL, XPASS, UNRESOLVED, or
       UNSUPPORTED.  The performance result codes of IMPROVED and REGRESSED are also allowed.

       The <b>&lt;test</b> <b>name&gt;</b> field can consist of an arbitrary string containing no newline.

       The <b>&lt;progress</b> <b>info&gt;</b> field can be used to report progress information such as (1/300) or can be empty, but
       even when empty the parentheses are required.

       Each test result may include additional (multiline) log information in the following format:

          &lt;log delineator&gt; TEST '(&lt;test name&gt;)' &lt;trailing delineator&gt;
          ... log message ...
          &lt;log delineator&gt;

       where <b>&lt;test</b> <b>name&gt;</b> should be the name of a preceding reported test, <b>&lt;log</b> <b>delineator&gt;</b> is a  string  of  “*”
       characters  <u>at</u> <u>least</u> four characters long (the recommended length is 20), and <b>&lt;trailing</b> <b>delineator&gt;</b> is an
       arbitrary (unparsed) string.

       The following is an example of a test run output which consists of four tests A, B, C, and D, and  a  log
       message for the failing test C:

          PASS: A (1 of 4)
          PASS: B (2 of 4)
          FAIL: C (3 of 4)
          ******************** TEST 'C' FAILED ********************
          Test 'C' failed as a result of exit code 1.
          ********************
          PASS: D (4 of 4)
