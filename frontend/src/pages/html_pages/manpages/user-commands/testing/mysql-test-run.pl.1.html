<b>MARIADB-TEST-RUN</b>(1)                          MariaDB Database System                         <b>MARIADB-TEST-RUN</b>(1)

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       mariadb-test-run.pl - run MariaDB test suite

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>

       <b>mariadb-test-run.pl</b> <b>[</b><u>options</u><b>]</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>mariadb-test-run.pl</b> Perl script is the main application used to run the MariaDB test suite. It
       invokes <b>mariadb-test</b> to run individual test cases.

       Invoke <b>mariadb-test-run.pl</b> in the mariadb-test directory like this:

           shell&gt; <b>mariadb-test-run.pl</b> <b>[</b><u>options</u><b>]</b> <b>[</b><u>test_name</u><b>]</b> <b>...</b>

       Each <u>test_name</u> argument names a test case. The test case file that corresponds to the test name is
       t/<u>test_name</u>.test.

       For each <u>test_name</u> argument, <b>mariadb-test-run.pl</b> runs the named test case. With no <u>test_name</u> arguments,
       <b>mariadb-test-run.pl</b> runs all .test files in the t subdirectory.

       If no suffix is given for the test name, a suffix of .test is assumed. Any leading path name is ignored.
       These commands are equivalent:

           shell&gt; <b>mariadb-test-run.pl</b> <b>mytest</b>
           shell&gt; <b>mariadb-test-run.pl</b> <b>mytest.test</b>
           shell&gt; <b>mariadb-test-run.pl</b> <b>t/mytest.test</b>

       A suite name can be given as part of the test name. That is, the syntax for naming a test is:

           [<u>suite_name</u>.]<u>test_name</u>[.<u>suffix</u>]

       If a suite name is given, <b>mariadb-test-run.pl</b> looks in that suite for the test. The test file
       corresponding to a test named <u>suite_name.test_name</u> is found in suite/<u>suite_name</u>/t/<u>test_name</u>.test. There
       is also an implicit suite name main for the tests in the top t directory. With no suite name,
       <b>mariadb-test-run.pl</b> looks in the default list of suites for a match and runs the test in any suites where
       it finds the test. Suppose that the default suite list is main, binlog, rpl, and that a test mytest.test
       exists in the main and rpl suites. With an argument of mytest or mytest.test, <b>mariadb-test-run.pl</b> will
       run mytest.test from the main and rpl suites.

       To run a family of test cases for which the names share a common prefix, use the <b>--do-test=</b><u>prefix</u> option.
       For example, <b>--do-test=rpl</b> runs the replication tests (test cases that have names beginning with rpl).
       <b>--skip-test</b> has the opposite effect of skipping test cases for which the names share a common prefix.

       The argument for the <b>--do-test</b> and <b>--skip-test</b> options also allows more flexible specification of which
       tests to perform or skip. If the argument contains a pattern metacharacter other than a lone period, it
       is interpreted as a Perl regular expression and applies to test names that match the pattern. If the
       argument contains a lone period or does not contain any pattern metacharacters, it is interpreted the
       same way as previously and matches test names that begin with the argument value. For example,
       <b>--do-test=testa</b> matches tests that begin with testa, <b>--do-test=main.testa</b> matches tests in the main test
       suite that begin with testa, and <b>--do-test=main.*testa</b> matches test names that contain main followed by
       testa with anything in between. In the latter case, the pattern match is not anchored to the beginning of
       the test name, so it also matches names such as xmainytesta.

       To perform setup prior to running tests, <b>mariadb-test-run.pl</b> needs to invoke <b>mariadbd</b> with the
       <b>--bootstrap</b> and <b>--skip-grant-tables</b> options. If MariaDB was configured with the <b>--disable-grant-options</b>
       option, <b>--bootstrap</b>, <b>--skip-grant-tables</b>, and <b>--init-file</b> will be disabled. To handle this, set the
       MYSQLD_BOOTSTRAP environment variable to the full path name of a server that has all options enabled.
       <b>mariadb-test-run.pl</b> will use that server to perform setup; it is not used to run the tests.

       The init_file test will fail if <b>--init-file</b> is disabled. This is an expected failure that can be handled
       as follows:

           shell&gt; <b>export</b> <b>MYSQLD_BOOTSTRAP</b>
           shell&gt; <b>MYSQLD_BOOTSTRAP=/full/path/to/mariadbd</b>
           shell&gt; <b>make</b> <b>test</b> <b>force="--skip-test=init_file"</b>

       To run <b>mariadb-test-run.pl</b> on Windows, you'll need either Cygwin or ActiveState Perl to run it. You may
       also need to install the modules required by the script. To run the test script, change location into the
       mariadb-test directory, set the MTR_VS_CONFIG environment variable to the configuration you selected
       earlier (or use the <b>--vs-config</b> option), and invoke <b>mariadb-test-run.pl</b>. For example (using Cygwin and
       the <b>bash</b> shell):

           shell&gt; <b>cd</b> <b>mariadb-test</b>
           shell&gt; <b>export</b> <b>MTR_VS_CONFIG=debug</b>
           shell&gt; <b>./mariadb-test-run.pl</b> <b>--force</b> <b>--timer</b>
           shell&gt; <b>./mariadb-test-run.pl</b> <b>--force</b> <b>--timer</b> <b>--ps-protocol</b>

       <b>mariadb-test-run.pl</b> uses several environment variables. Some of them are listed in the following table.
       Some of these are set from the outside and used by <b>mariadb-test-run.pl</b>, others are set by
       <b>mariadb-test-run.pl</b> instead, and may be referred to in tests.

       The variable MTR_PORT_BASE was added in MySQL 5.1.45 as a more logical replacement for MTR_BUILD_THREAD.
       It gives the actual port number directly (will be rounded down to a multiple of 10). If you use
       MTR_BUILD_THREAD, the port number is found by multiplying this by 10 and adding 10000.

       Tests sometimes rely on certain environment variables being defined. For example, certain tests assume
       that MARIADB-TEST is defined so that <b>mariadb-test</b> can invoke itself with exec $MYSQL_TEST.

       Other tests may refer to the last three variables listed in the preceding table, to locate files to read
       or write. For example, tests that need to create files will typically put them in
       $MYSQL_TMP_DIR/<u>file_name</u>.

       If you are running <b>mariadb-test-run.pl</b> version 1 by setting MTR_VERSION, note that this only affects the
       test driver, not the test client (and its language) or the tests themselves.

       A few tests might not run with version 1 because they depend on some feature of version 2. You may have
       those tests skipped by adding the test name to the file lib/v1/incompatible.tests. This feature is
       available from MySQL 5.1.40.

       <b>mariadb-test-run.pl</b> supports the options in the following list. An argument of <b>--</b> tells
       <b>mariadb-test-run.pl</b> not to process any following arguments as options.

       •   <b>--help</b>, <b>-h</b>

           Display a help message and exit.

       •   <b>--big-test</b>

           Allow tests marked as "big" to run. Tests can be thus marked by including the line <b>--source</b>
           <b>include/big_test.inc</b>, and they will only be run if this option is given, or if the environment
           variable BIG_TEST is set to 1. Repeat this option twice to run only "big" tests.

           This is typically used for tests that take a very long to run, or that use many resources, so that
           they are not suitable for running as part of a normal test suite run.

       •   <b>--boot-dbx</b>

           Run the mariadbd server used for bootstrapping the database through the dbx debugger.

       •   <b>--boot-ddd</b>

           Run the mariadbd server used for bootstrapping the database through the ddd debugger.

       •   <b>--boot-gdb</b>

           Run the mariadbd server used for bootstrapping the database through the gdb debugger.

       •   <b>--[mtr-]build-thread=</b><u>number</u>

           Specify a number to calculate port numbers from. The formula is 10 * <u>build_thread</u> + 10000. Instead of
           a number, it can be set to auto, which is also the default value, in which case <b>mariadb-test-run.pl</b>
           will allocate a number unique to this host.

           The value (number or auto) can also be set with the MTR_BUILD_THREAD environment variable.

           The more logical <b>--port-base</b> is supported as an alternative.

       •   <b>--callgrind</b>

           Instructs <b>valgrind</b> to use <b>callgrind</b>.

       •   <b>--check-testcases</b>

           Check test cases for side effects. This is done by checking system state before and after each test
           case; if there is any difference, a warning to that effect will be written, but the test case will
           not be marked as failed because of it. This check is enabled by default.

       •   <b>--client-bindir=</b><u>path</u>

           The path to the directory where client binaries are located.

       •   <b>--client-dbx</b>

           Start <b>mariadb-test</b> in the <b>dbx</b> debugger.

       •   <b>--client-ddd</b>

           Start <b>mariadb-test</b> in the <b>ddd</b> debugger.

       •   <b>--client-debugger=</b><u>debugger</u>

           Start <b>mariadb-test</b> in the named debugger.

       •   <b>--client-gdb</b>

           Start <b>mariadb-test</b> in the <b>gdb</b> debugger.

       •   <b>--client-libdir=</b><u>path</u>

           The path to the directory where client libraries are located.

       •   <b>--combination=</b><u>value</u>

           Extra options to pass to <b>mariadbd</b>. The value should consist of one or more comma-separated <b>mariadbd</b>
           options. This option is similar to <b>--mariadbd</b> but should be given two or more times.
           <b>mariadb-test-run.pl</b> executes multiple test runs, using the options for each instance of <b>--combination</b>
           in successive runs. If <b>--combination</b> is given only once, it has no effect. For test runs specific to
           a given test suite, an alternative to the use of <b>--combination</b> is to create a combinations file in
           the suite directory. The file should contain a section of options for each test run.

       •   <b>--comment=</b><u>str</u>

           Write <u>str</u> to the output within lines filled with #, as a form of banner.

       •   <b>--compress</b>

           Compress all information sent between the client and the server if both support compression.

       •   <b>--cursor-protocol</b>

           Use the cursor protocol between client and server (implies <b>--ps-protocol</b>).

       •   <b>--dbx</b>

           Start the <b>mariadbd(s)</b> in the <b>dbx</b> debugger.

       •   <b>--ddd</b>

           Start the <b>mariadbd(s)</b> in the <b>ddd</b> debugger.

       •   <b>--debug</b>

           Dump trace output for all clients and servers.

       •   <b>--debug-common</b>

           Same as <b>--debug</b>, but sets the 'd' debug flags to "query,info,error,enter,exit".

       •   <b>--debug-server</b>

           Use debug version of server, but without turning on tracing.

       •   <b>--debugger=</b><u>debugger</u>

           Start <b>mariadbd</b> using the named debugger.

       •   <b>--debug-sync-timeout=</b><u>N</u>

           Controls whether the Debug Sync facility for testing and debugging is enabled. The option value is a
           timeout in seconds. The default value is 300. A value of 0 disables Debug Sync. The value of this
           option also becomes the default timeout for individual synchronization points.

           <b>mariadb-test-run.pl</b> passes <b>--loose-debug-sync-timeout=</b><u>N</u> to <b>mariadbd</b>. The <b>--loose</b> prefix is used so
           that <b>mariadbd</b> does not fail if Debug Sync is not compiled in.

       •   <b>--defaults-file=</b><u>file_name</u>

           Use the named file as fixed config file template for all tests.

       •   <b>--defaults_extra_file=</b><u>file_name</u>

           Add setting from the named file to all generated configs.

       •   <b>--do-test=</b><u>prefix</u>|<u>regex</u>

           Run all test cases having a name that begins with the given <u>prefix</u> value, or fulfils the <u>regex</u>. This
           option provides a convenient way to run a family of similarly named tests.

           The argument for the <b>--do-test</b> option also allows more flexible specification of which tests to
           perform. If the argument contains a pattern metacharacter other than a lone period, it is interpreted
           as a Perl regular expression and applies to test names that match the pattern. If the argument
           contains a lone period or does not contain any pattern metacharacters, it is interpreted the same way
           as previously and matches test names that begin with the argument value. For example, <b>--do-test=testa</b>
           matches tests that begin with testa, <b>--do-test=main.testa</b> matches tests in the main test suite that
           begin with testa, and <b>--do-test=main.*testa</b> matches test names that contain main followed by testa
           with anything in between. In the latter case, the pattern match is not anchored to the beginning of
           the test name, so it also matches names such as xmainytestz.

       •   <b>--dry-run</b>

           Don't run any tests, print the list of tests that were selected for execution.

       •   <b>--embedded-server</b>

           Use a version of <b>mariadb-test</b> built with the embedded server.

       •   <b>--enable-disabled</b>

           Ignore any disabled.def file, and also run tests marked as disabled. Success or failure of those
           tests will be reported the same way as other tests.

       •   <b>--experimental=</b><u>file_name</u>

           Specify a file that contains a list of test cases that should be displayed with the [ exp-fail ] code
           rather than [ fail ] if they fail.

           For an example of a file that might be specified via this option, see
           mariadb-test/collections/default.experimental.

       •   <b>--extern</b> <u>option</u>=<u>value</u>

           Use an already running server. The option/value pair is what is needed by the <b>mariadb</b> client to
           connect to the server. Each <b>--extern</b> option can only take one option/value pair as an argument, so
           you need to repeat <b>--extern</b> for each pair needed. Example:

                     ./mariadb-test-run.pl --extern socket=var/tmp/mariadbd.1.sock alias

           Note: If a test case has an .opt file that requires the server to be restarted with specific options,
           the file will not be used. The test case likely will fail as a result.

       •   <b>--fast</b>

           Do not perform controlled shutdown when servers need to be restarted or at the end of the test run.
           This is equivalent to using --shutdown-timeout=0.

       •   <b>--force-restart</b>

           Always restart servers between tests.

       •   <b>--force</b>

           Normally, <b>mariadb-test-run.pl</b> exits if a test case fails.  <b>--force</b> causes execution to continue
           regardless of test case failure.

       •   <b>--gcov</b>

           Collect coverage information after the test. The result is a <b>gcov</b> file per source and header file.

       •   <b>--gcov-src-dir</b>

           Colllect coverage only within the given subdirectory. For example, if you're only developing the SQL
           layer, it makes sense to use <b>--gcov-src-dir=sql</b>.

       •   <b>--gdb</b>

           Start the <b>mariadbd(s)</b> in the <b>gdb</b> debugger.

       •   <b>--gprof</b>

           Collect profiling information using the <b>gprof</b> profiling tool.

       •   <b>--manual-dbx</b>

           Use a server that has already been started by the user in the <b>dbx</b> debugger.

       •   <b>--manual-ddd</b>

           Use a server that has already been started by the user in the <b>ddd</b> debugger.

       •   <b>--manual-debug</b>

           Use a server that has already been started by the user in a debugger.

       •   <b>--manual-gdb</b>

           Use a server that has already been started by the user in the <b>gdb</b> debugger.

       •   <b>--manual-lldb</b>

           Use a server that has already been started by the user in the <b>lldb</b> debugger.

       •   <b>--mark-progress</b>

           Marks progress with timing (in milliseconds) and line number in var/log/<u>testname</u>.progress.

       •   <b>--max-connections=</b><u>num</u>

           The maximum number of simultaneous server connections that may be used per test. If not set, the
           maximum is 128. Minimum allowed limit is 8, maximum is 5120. Corresponds to the same option for
           <b>mariadb-test</b>.

       •   <b>--max-save-core=</b><u>N</u>

           Limit the number of core files saved, to avoid filling up disks in case of a frequently crashing
           server. Defaults to 5, set to 0 for no limit. May also be set with the environment variable
           MTR_MAX_SAVE_CORE

       •   <b>--max-save-datadir=</b><u>N</u>

           Limit the number of data directories saved after failed tests, to avoid filling up disks in case of
           frequent failures. Defaults to 20, set to 0 for no limit. May also be set with the environment
           variable MTR_MAX_SAVE_DATADIR

       •   <b>--max-test-fail=</b><u>N</u>

           Stop execution after the specified number of tests have failed, to avoid using up resources (and
           time) in case of massive failures. retries are not counted, nor are failures of tests marked
           experimental. Defaults to 10, set to 0 for no limit. May also be set with the environment variable
           MTR_MAX_TEST_FAIL

       •   <b>--mem</b>

           This option is not supported on Windows.

           Run the test suite in memory, using tmpfs or ramdisk. This can decrease test times significantly, in
           particular if you would otherwise be running over a remote file system.  <b>mariadb-test-run.pl</b> attempts
           to find a suitable location using a built-in list of standard locations for tmpfs and puts the var
           directory there. This option also affects placement of temporary files, which are created in var/tmp.

           The default list includes /dev/shm. You can also enable this option by setting the environment
           variable MTR_MEM[=<u>dir_name</u>]. If <u>dir_name</u> is given, it is added to the beginning of the list of
           locations to search, so it takes precedence over any built-in locations.

           Once you have run tests with <b>--mem</b> within a mariadb-testdirectory, a soflink var will have been set
           up to the temporary directory, and this will be re-used the next time, until the soflink is deleted.
           Thus, you do not have to repeat the <b>--mem</b> option next time.

       •   <b>--mariadbd=</b><u>value</u>

           Extra options to pass to <b>mariadbd</b>. The value should consist of one or more comma-separated <b>mariadbd</b>
           options.

       •   <b>--mariadbd-env=</b><u>VAR=VAL</u>

           Specify additional environment settings for "mariadbd". Use additional <b>--mariadbd-env</b> options to set
           more than one variable.

       •   <b>--nocheck-testcases</b>

           Disable the check for test case side effects; see <b>--check-testcases</b> for a description.

       •   <b>--noreorder</b>

           Do not reorder tests to reduce number of restarts, but run them in exactly the order given. If a
           whole suite is to be run, the tests are run in alphabetical order, though similar combinations will
           be grouped together. If more than one suite is listed, the tests are run one suite at a time, in the
           order listed.

       •   <b>--notimer</b>

           Cause <b>mariadb-test</b> not to generate a timing file. The effect of this is that the report from each
           test case does not include the timing in milliseconds as it normally does.

       •   <b>--nowarnings</b>

           Do not look for and report errors and warning in the server logs.

       •   <b>--parallel={</b><u>N</u><b>|auto}</b>

           Run tests using <u>N</u> parallel threads. By default, 1 thread is used. Use <b>--parallel=auto</b> for
           auto-setting of <u>N</u>.

       •   <b>--[mtr-]port-base=</b><u>P</u>

           Specify base of port numbers to be used; a block of 10 will be allocated.  <u>P</u> should be divisible by
           10; if it is not, it will be rounded down. If running with more than one parallel test thread, thread
           2 will use the next block of 10 and so on.

           If the port number is given as auto, which is also the default, <b>mariadb-test-run.pl</b> will allocate a
           number unique to this host. The value may also be given with the environment variable MTR_PORT_BASE.

           If both <b>--build-thread</b> and <b>--port-base</b> are used, <b>--port-base</b> takes precedence.

       •   <b>--print-testcases</b>

           Do not run any tests, but print details about all tests, in the order they would have been run.

       •   <b>--ps-protocol</b>

           Use the binary protocol between client and server.

       •   <b>--record</b>

           Pass the <b>--record</b> option to <b>mariadb-test</b>. This option requires a specific test case to be named on
           the command line.

       •   <b>--reorder</b>

           Reorder tests to minimize the number of server restarts needed. This is the default behavior. There
           is no guarantee that a particular set of tests will always end up in the same order.

       •   <b>--repeat=</b><u>N</u>

           Run each test <u>N</u> number of times.

       •   <b>--report-features</b>

           First run a "test" that reports MariaDB features, displaying the output of SHOW ENGINES and SHOW
           VARIABLES. This can be used to verify that binaries are built with all required features.

       •   <b>--report-times</b>

           Report how much time has been spent on different phases of test execution.

       •   <b>--retry=</b><u>N</u>

           If a test fails, it is retried up to a maximum of <u>N</u> runs (default 1). Retries are also limited by the
           maximum number of failures before stopping, set with the <b>--retry-failure</b> option. This option has no
           effect unless <b>--force</b> is also used; without it, test execution will terminate after the first
           failure.

           The <b>--retry</b> and <b>--retry-failure</b> options do not affect how many times a test repeated with <b>--repeat</b>
           may fail in total, as each repetition is considered a new test case, which may in turn be retried if
           it fails.

       •   <b>--retry-failure=</b><u>N</u>

           When using the <b>--retry</b> option to retry failed tests, stop when N failures have occurred (default 2).
           Setting it to 0 or 1 effectively turns off retries.

       •   <b>--shutdown-timeout=</b><u>SECONDS</u>

           Max number of seconds to wait for servers to do controlled shutdown before killing them. Default is
           10.

       •   <b>--skip-combinations</b>

           Do not apply combinations; ignore combinations file or option.

       •   <b>--skip-rpl</b>

           Skip replication test cases.

       •   <b>--skip-ssl</b>

           Do not start <b>mariadbd</b> with support for SSL connections.

       •   <b>--skip-test=</b><u>regex</u>|<u>regex</u>

           Specify a regular expression to be applied to test case names. Cases with names that match the
           expression are skipped. tests to skip.

           The argument for the <b>--skip-test</b> option allows more flexible specification of which tests to skip. If
           the argument contains a pattern metacharacter other than a lone period, it is interpreted as a Perl
           regular expression and applies to test names that match the pattern. See the description of the
           <b>--do-test</b> option for details.

       •   <b>--skip-test-list=</b><u>FILE</u>

           Skip the tests listed in FILE. Each line in the file is an entry and should be formatted as:
           &lt;TESTNAME&gt; : &lt;COMMENT&gt;

       •   <b>--skip-*</b>

           <b>--skip-*</b> options not otherwise recognized by <b>mariadb-test-run.pl</b> are passed to the master server.

       •   <b>--sleep=</b><u>N</u>

           Pass <b>--sleep=</b><u>N</u> to <b>mariadb-test</b>.

       •   <b>--sp-protocol</b>

           Create a stored procedure to execute all queries.

       •   <b>--ssl</b>

           If <b>mariadb-test-run.pl</b> is started with the <b>--ssl</b> option, it sets up a secure connection for all test
           cases. In this case, if <b>mariadbd</b> does not support SSL, <b>mariadb-test-run.pl</b> exits with an error
           message: Couldn't find support for SSL

       •   <b>--staging-run</b>

           Run a limited number of tests (no slow tests). Used for running staging trees with valgrind.

       •   <b>--start</b>

           Initialize and start servers with the startup settings for the specified test case. You can use this
           option to start a server to which you can connect later. For example, after building a source
           distribution you can start a server and connect to it with the <b>mariadb</b> client like this:

               shell&gt; <b>cd</b> <b>mariadb-test</b>
               shell&gt; <b>./mariadb-test-run.pl</b> <b>--start</b> <b>alias</b> <b>&amp;</b>
               shell&gt; <b>../mariadb</b> <b>-S</b> <b>./var/tmp/master.sock</b> <b>-h</b> <b>localhost</b> <b>-u</b> <b>root</b>

           If no tests are named on the command line, the server(s) will be started with settings for the first
           test that would have been run without the <b>--start</b> option.

           <b>mariadb-test-run.pl</b> will stop once the server has been started, but will terminate if the server
           dies. If killed, it will also shut down the server.

       •   <b>--start-and-exit</b>

           Same <b>--start</b>, but mariadb-test-run terminates and leaves just the server running.

       •   <b>--start-dirty</b>

           This is similar to <b>--start</b>, but will skip the database initialization phase and assume that database
           files are already available. Usually this means you must have run another test first.

       •   <b>--start-from=</b><u>test_name</u>

           <b>mariadb-test-run.pl</b> sorts the list of names of the test cases to be run, and then begins with
           <u>test_name</u>.

       •   <b>--strace</b>

           Run the "mariadbd" executables using strace. Default options are <b>-f</b> <b>-o</b> <b>var/log/'mariadbd-</b>
           <b>name'.strace</b>.

       •   <b>--strace-client</b>

           Create <b>strace</b> output for <b>mariadb-test</b>, optionally specifying name and path to the trace program to
           use.

           Example: ./mariadb-test-run.pl --strace-client=ktrace

       •   <b>--strace-option</b>=<u>ARGS</u>

           Option to give <b>strace</b>, replaces default option(s).

       •   <b>--stress=</b><u>ARGS</u>

           Run stress test, providing options to mariadb-stress-test.pl. Options are separated by comma.

       •   <b>--suite[s]=</b><u>suite_name...</u>

           Comma separated list of suite names to run. The default is:
           "main-,archive-,binlog-,csv-,federated-,funcs_1-,funcs_2-,
           handler-,heap-,innodb-,innodb_fts-,innodb_zip-,maria-,
           multi_source-,optimizer_unfixed_bugs-,parts-,perfschema-,
           plugins-,roles-,rpl-,sys_vars-,unit-,vcol-".

       •   <b>--stop-file=</b><u>file</u>

           If this file is detected, mariadb-test will not start new tests until the file is removed (also
           MTR_STOP_FILE environment variable).

       •   <b>--stop-keep-alive=</b><u>sec</u>

           Works with <b>--stop-file</b>, print messages every <u>sec</u> seconds when mariadb-test is waiting to remove the
           file (for buildbot) (also MTR_STOP_KEEP_ALIVE environment variable).

       •   <b>--suite-timeout=</b><u>minutes</u>

           Specify the maximum test suite runtime in minutes. The default is 360.

       •   <b>--testcase-timeout</b>

           Specify the maximum test case runtime in minutes. The default is 15.

       •   <b>--timediff</b>

           Used with <b>--timestamp</b>, also print time passed since the previous test started.

       •   <b>--timer</b>

           Cause <b>mariadb-test</b> to generate a timing file. The default file is named ./var/log/timer.

       •   <b>--timestamp</b>

           Prints a timestamp before the test case name in each test report line, showing when the test ended.

       •   <b>--tmpdir=</b><u>path</u>

           The directory where temporary file are stored. The default location is ./var/tmp. The environment
           variable MYSQL_TMP_DIR will be set to the path for this directory, whether it has the default value
           or has been set explicitly. This may be referred to in tests.

       •   <b>--user=</b><u>user_name</u>

           The MariaDB user name to use when connecting to the server (default root).

       •   <b>--user-args</b>

           In combination with <b>start*</b> and no test name, drops arguments to mariadbd except those specified with
           <b>--mariadbd</b> (if any).

       •   <b>--valgrind[-all]</b>

           Run <b>mariadb-test</b> and <b>mariadbd</b> with <b>valgrind</b>. This and the following <b>--valgrind</b> options require that
           the executables have been built with <b>valgrind</b> support.

       •   <b>--valgrind-mariadbd</b>

           Run the <b>mariadbd</b> server with <b>valgrind</b>.

       •   <b>--valgrind-mariadb-test</b>

       •   <b>--valgrind-option=</b><u>str</u>

           Option to give <b>valgrind</b>. Replaces default option(s). Can be specified more then once&amp;.

       •   <b>--valgrind-path=</b><u>path</u>

           Path to the <b>valgrind</b> executable.

       •   <b>--vardir=</b><u>path</u>

           Specify the path where files generated during the test run are stored. The default location is ./var.
           The environment variable MYSQLTEST_VARDIR will be set to the path for this directory, whether it has
           the default value or has been set explicitly. This may be referred to in tests.

       •   <b>--verbose</b>

           Give more verbose output regarding test execution. Use the option twice to get even more output. Note
           that the output generated within each test case is not affected.

       •   <b>--verbose-restart</b>

           Write when and why servers are restarted between test cases.

       •   <b>--view-protocol</b>

           Create a view to execute all non updating queries.

       •   <b>--vs-config=</b><u>config_val</u>

           Visual Studio configuration used to create executables (default: MTR_VS_CONFIG environment variable)
           This option is for Windows only.

       •   <b>--wait-all</b>

           If <b>--start</b> or <b>--start-dirty</b> is used, wait for all servers to exit before termination. Otherwise, it
           will terminate if one (of several) servers is restarted.

       •   <b>--warnings</b>

           Search the server log for errors or warning after each test and report any suspicious ones; if any
           are found, the test will be marked as failed. This is the default behavior, it may be turned off with
           <b>--nowarnings</b>.
