</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  program  <u>atop</u>  is an interactive monitor to view the load on a Linux system.  Every <u>interval</u> seconds
       (default: 10 seconds) information is gathered about the resource occupation on system level of  the  most
       critical  hardware  resources  (from  a  performance point of view), i.e. CPUs, memory, disks and network
       interfaces. Besides, information is gathered about the processes (or threads) that  are  responsible  for
       the  utilization  of the CPUs, memory and disks.  Network load per process is shown only when the <u>netatop</u>
       kernel module or the <u>netatop-bpf</u> BPF module has been installed.

</pre><h4><b>BAR</b> <b>GRAPH</b> <b>MODE</b></h4><pre>
       When running <u>atop</u> you can choose to view the system load in bar graph mode or in text mode.  In bar graph
       mode the resource utilization of CPUs, memory, disks and network  interfaces  is  shown  via  (character-
       based)  bar  graphs, but only on system level.  When you want to view more detailed information on system
       level or when you want to view the resource consumption on process or thread level,  you  can  switch  to
       text  mode  by  pressing  the 'B' key. Alternatively, you can use the 'B' key (again) to switch from text
       mode to bar graph mode.
       By default, <u>atop</u> starts in text mode unless the <u>-B</u> flag is used or unless 'B' has been  configured  as  a
       default  flag  in  the <u>.atoprc</u> file (for further information about default flags, refer to the <b>atoprc</b> man
       page).

       In bar graph mode the terminal will be subdivided into four character-based windows, i.e. one window  for
       each hardware resource:

       <b>Processors</b>
            The  first  bar  shows  the  average  busy percentage of all CPUs with the bar label 'Avg' (might be
            abbreviated to 'Av' or even just 'A').  The subsequent bars show  the  busy  percentages  of  single
            CPUs.
            When  there is not enough horizontal space to show all CPUs, only the most busy CPUs per sample will
            be shown after the width of each bar has been reduced to a minimum.

            By default, the categories of CPU consumption are shown by different colors in the bars, marked with
            a character 'S' (system mode), 'U' (user mode),  'I'  (interrupt  handling),  's'  (steal)  and  'G'
            (guest, i.e. consumed by virtual machines).
            The  top  of  the  bar might consist of an unmarked color representing a 'neutral' category. Suppose
            that the scale unit is 5% per line and the total busy percentage is 54% consisting of two categories
            of 27%.  The two categories will be rounded to  25%  (5  lines  of  5%  each)  but  the  total  busy
            percentage  will  be  rounded to 55% (11 lines of 5%).  Then the top line will represent a 'neutral'
            category.
            By pressing the 'H' key or by starting <u>atop</u> with the '-H' flag, no categories are shown.

            A red line is drawn in the bar graph as critical threshold.  By default this value is 90% and can be
            modified by the 'cpucritperc' option in the configuration file (see separate <b>atoprc</b> man page).  When
            this value is set to zero, no threshold line will be drawn.

       <b>Memory</b> <b>and</b> <b>swap</b> <b>space</b>
            Memory  is  presented  as a column in which the specific categories of memory consumption are shown.
            These categories are (code, data and  stack of)  processes/kernel,  slab  caches  (i.e.  dynamically
            allocated kernel memory), shared memory, tmpfs, static huge pages, page cache and free memory.
            Swap  space  (if  present)  is  also  presented as a column in which the categories processes/tmpfs,
            shared memory and free space are shown.

            At the right side memory-related event counters are shown.
            The bottom three counters are colored green when there is no  memory  pressure.   When  considerable
            activity is noticed such counter might be colored orange and with high activity red.
            When  memory  pressure  starts,  usually memory page scanning will be activated first. When pressure
            increases, memory pages of processes might be swapped out to swap space (if present).
            The 'oomkills' counter (Out Of Memory killing) is most serious: it reflects the number of  processes
            that  are  killed due to lack of memory (and swap). Therefore this counter shows the absolute number
            (not per second) of processes being killed during the last interval and will immediately be  colored
            red  when  it  is  1  or  more.   Besides, after <u>atop</u> has noticed OOM killing the 'oomkills' counter
            remains orange for the next 15 minutes, just in case that you have  missed  the  OOM  killing  event
            itself.
            When  there is enough vertical space in the memory window, event counters are shown about the number
            of memory pages being swapped in, the number of memory pages paged out  to  block  devices  and  the
            number of memory pages paged in from block devices.

            Memory  and  swap  space  consumption  will  preferably  be  shown  in a character-based window that
            vertically uses the entire screen for optimal granularity. However, when there are a  lot  of  disks
            and/or  network  interfaces the memory and swap space consumption will be shown in a character-based
            window that only uses the upper half of the screen.

       <b>Disks</b>
            For each disk the busy percentage is shown as a bar.
            When there is not enough horizontal space to show all disks, only the most  busy  disks  per  sample
            will be shown.

            By  default, categories of disk consumption are shown by different colors in the bars, marked with a
            character 'R' (read) and 'W' (write).
            The top of the bar might consist of an unmarked color representing  a  'neutral'  category.  Suppose
            that the scale unit is 5% per line and the total busy percentage is 54% consisting of two categories
            of  27%.   The  two  categories  will  be  rounded  to  25%  (5 lines of 5% each) but the total busy
            percentage will be rounded to 55% (11 lines of 5%).  Then the top line will  represent  a  'neutral'
            category.
            By pressing the 'H' key or by starting <u>atop</u> with the '-H' flag, no categories are shown.

            A red line is drawn in the bar graph as critical threshold.  By default this value is 90% and can be
            modified  by the 'dskcritperc' option in the configuration file (see separate <b>atoprc</b> man page). When
            this value is set to zero, no threshold line will be drawn.

       <b>Interfaces</b>
            For each non-virtual network interface a double bar graph is  shown  with  a  dedicated  scale  that
            reflects  the  traffic  rate.  One  of the bars shows the transmit rate ('TX') and the other bar the
            receive rate ('RX').  The traffic scale of each network interface remains at its highest level.  All
            interface scales can be reset during the measurement by pressing the 'L' key.

            Most often the real speed (maximum bandwidth) of network interfaces is not known, e.g.  in  case  of
            the  network  interfaces  of  virtual  machines.  Therefore it is not possible to show the interface
            utilization as a percentage. However, when the real speed of an interface is known it will be  shown
            underneath the concerning bar graph.

            When  there  is  not  enough  horizontal  space  to  show all network interfaces, only the most busy
            interfaces per sample will be shown.

       Usually the bar graphs will not be sorted on busy percentage  when  there  is  enough  horizontal  space.
       However,  after  switching from text mode to bar graph mode the bar graphs might have been sorted because
       this was needed for the presentation in text mode. The next interval in bar graph  mode  shows  the  bars
       unsorted again unless the window width is unsufficient for all bars.

       The remaining part of this manual page mainly describes the information shown in text mode.  When certain
       descriptions also apply to bar graph mode it will be mentioned explicitly.

</pre><h4><b>TEXT</b> <b>MODE</b> <b>IN</b> <b>GENERAL</b></h4><pre>
       The  initial  screen  in  text  mode  shows  if  <u>atop</u>  runs  with  restricted view (unprivileged user) or
       unrestricted view (privileged user).  In case of restricted view <u>atop</u> does not have  the  privileges  (no
       root  identity  nor  the  necessary  capabilities)  to retrieve all counter values on system level and on
       process level.

       With every interval information is shown about the resource occupation  on  system  level  (CPU,  memory,
       disks  and  network  layers),  followed  by  a  list  of processes which have been active during the last
       interval.  Notice that all processes that were unchanged during the last interval are not  shown,  unless
       the  key 'a' has been pressed or unless sorting on memory occupation is done (then inactive processes are
       relevant as well).  If the list of active processes does not entirely fit on the screen, only the top  of
       the list is shown (sorted in order of activity).
       The intervals are repeated till the number of <u>samples</u> (specified as command argument) is reached, or till
       the key 'q' is pressed in interactive mode.

       When  <u>atop</u>  is  started,  it checks whether the standard output channel is connected to a screen, or to a
       file/pipe. In the first case it produces screen control codes  (via  the  ncurses  library)  and  behaves
       interactively; in the second case it produces flat text output.

       In  interactive  mode,  the  output  of  <u>atop</u>  scales  dynamically  to  the  current  dimensions  of  the
       screen/window.
       If the window is resized horizontally, columns will be added or removed automatically. For this  purpose,
       every  column  has  a particular weight. The columns with the highest weights that fit within the current
       width will be shown.
       If the window is resized  vertically,  lines  of  the  process/thread  list  will  be  added  or  removed
       automatically.

       In interactive mode the output of <u>atop</u> can be controlled by pressing particular keys.  However it is also
       possible  to  specify  such  key as <b>flag</b> on the command line. In that case <u>atop</u> switches to the indicated
       mode on beforehand. This mode can be modified  again  interactively.  Specifying  such  key  as  flag  is
       especially  useful  when running <u>atop</u> with output to a pipe or file (non-interactively).  These flags are
       the same as the keys that can be pressed in interactive mode (see section INTERACTIVE COMMANDS).
       Additional flags are available to support storage of atop-data  in  raw  format  (see  section  RAW  DATA
       STORAGE).

</pre><h4><b>PROCESS</b> <b>ACCOUNTING</b></h4><pre>
       With  every  interval,  <u>atop</u>  reads  the  kernel  administration  to obtain information about all running
       processes.  However, it is likely that processes have terminated during the  interval.   These  processes
       might  have consumed system resources during this interval before they terminated.  Therefore, <u>atop</u> tries
       to read the process accounting records that contain the accounting information  of  terminated  processes
       and  report  these processes too.  Only when the process accounting mechanism in the kernel is activated,
       the kernel writes such process accounting record to a file for every process that terminates.

       There are various ways for <u>atop</u> to get access to the process accounting records (tried in this order):

       1.  When the environment variable ATOPACCT is set, it specifies the name of the process accounting  file.
           In  that  case,  process  accounting  for this file should have been activated on beforehand.  Before
           opening this file for reading, <u>atop</u> drops its root privileges (if any).
           When this environment variable is present but its contents is empty, process accounting will  not  be
           used at all.

       2.  <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>preferred</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>handling</b> <b>process</b> <b>accounting</b> <b>records!</b>
           When  the <u>atopacctd</u> daemon is active, it has activated the process accounting mechanism in the kernel
           and transfers to original accounting records to shadow files.  In that  case,  <u>atop</u>  drops  its  root
           privileges and opens the current shadow file for reading.
           This  way  is  preferred,  because  the  <u>atopacctd</u>  daemon  maintains full control of the size of the
           original process accounting file written by the  kernel  and  the  shadow  files  read  by  the  <u>atop</u>
           process(es).

           The  <u>atopacct</u> service will be activated before the <u>atop</u> service to enable <u>atop</u> to detect that process
           accounting is managed by the <u>atopacctd</u> daemon. As a forking service, <u>atopacctd</u> takes  care  that  all
           directories  and files are initialized before the parent process dies. The child process continues as
           the daemon process.

           For further information, refer to the <b>atopacctd</b> man page.

       3.  When the <u>atopacctd</u> daemon is not active, <u>atop</u> verifies if the process accounting mechanism  has  been
           switched  on  via the separate <b>psacct</b> or <b>acct</b> package (the package name depends on the Linux distro).
           In that case, one of the files <b>/var/log/pacct,</b> <b>/var/account/pacct</b> or <b>/var/log/account/pacct</b> is in use
           as process accounting file and <u>atop</u> opens this file for reading.

       4.  As a last possibility, <u>atop</u> itself tries to activate the process accounting mechanism (requires  root
           privileges)  using  the  file <b>/var/cache/atop.d/atop.acct</b> (to be written by the kernel, to be read by
           <u>atop</u> itself). Process accounting remains active as long as  at  least  one  <u>atop</u>  process  is  alive.
           Whenever  the  last  <u>atop</u> process stops (either by pressing 'q' or by 'kill -15'), it deactivates the
           process accounting mechanism again. Therefore you should never terminate <u>atop</u> by 'kill  -9',  because
           then it has no chance to stop process accounting.  As a result, the accounting file may consume a lot
           of disk space after a while.
           To  avoid  that the process accounting file consumes too much disk space, <u>atop</u> verifies at the end of
           every sample if the size of the process accounting file exceeds 200 MiB and if this <u>atop</u>  process  is
           the only one that is currently using the file.  In that case the file is truncated to a size of zero.

           Notice  that  root-privileges are required to switch on/off process accounting in the kernel. You can
           start <u>atop</u> as a root user or specify setuid-root privileges to the executable file.   In  the  latter
           case, <u>atop</u> switches on process accounting and drops the root-privileges again.
           If <u>atop</u> does not run with root-privileges, it does not show information about finished processes.  It
           indicates  this  situation  with  the  message  'no procacct' in the top-right corner (instead of the
           counter that shows the number of exited processes).

       When during one interval a lot of processes have finished, <u>atop</u> might grow tremendously  in  memory  when
       reading  all  process  accounting records at the end of the interval. To avoid such excessive growth <u>atop</u>
       will never read more than 50 MiB with process information from the process accounting file  per  interval
       (approx.  54000 finished processes).  In interactive mode a warning is given whenever processes have been
       skipped for this reason.

</pre><h4><b>COLORS</b></h4><pre>
       For the resource consumption on system level, <u>atop</u> uses colors in text mode to indicate that  a  critical
       occupation  percentage  has been (almost) reached.  A critical occupation percentage means that is likely
       that this load causes a noticeable negative performance influence for applications using  this  resource.
       The  critical percentage depends on the type of resource: e.g. the performance influence of a disk with a
       busy percentage of 80% might be more noticeable for applications/users than a CPU with a busy  percentage
       of 90%.
       Currently <u>atop</u> uses the following default values to calculate a weighted percentage per resource:

        <b>Processor</b>
            A busy percentage of 90% or higher is considered 'critical' (also in bar graph mode).

        <b>Disk</b>
            A busy percentage of 90% or higher is considered 'critical'.

        <b>Network</b>
            A busy percentage of 90% or higher for the load of an interface is considered 'critical'.

        <b>Memory</b>
            An occupation percentage of 90% is considered 'critical'.  Notice that this occupation percentage is
            the  accumulated memory consumption of the kernel (including slab) and all processes. The memory for
            the page cache ('cache' and 'buff' in the MEM-line) and the reclaimable part of the  slab  ('slrec')
            is not implied!
            If  the  number  of  pages  swapped  out ('swout' in the PAG-line) is larger than 10 per second, the
            memory resource is considered 'critical'.  A value of at least 1 per second  is  considered  'almost
            critical'.
            If  the  committed  virtual memory exceeds the limit ('vmcom' and 'vmlim' in the SWP-line), the SWP-
            line is colored due to overcommitting the system.

        <b>Swap</b>
            An occupation percentage of 80% is considered 'critical' because  swap  space  might  be  completely
            exhausted in the near future.  It is not critical from a performance point-of-view.

       These default values can be modified in the configuration file (see separate <b>atoprc</b> man page).

       When  a resource exceeds its critical occupation percentage, the concerning values in the screen line are
       colored red by default.
       When a resource exceeds (by default) 80% of its critical percentage  (so  it  is  almost  critical),  the
       concerning  values in the screen line are colored cyan by default. This 'almost critical percentage' (one
       value for all resources) can be also modified in the configuration file (see separate <b>atoprc</b> man page).
       The default colors red and cyan can be modified in the configuration file as well  (see  separate  <b>atoprc</b>
       man page).

       With  the  key  'x'  (or flag -x), the use of colors can be suppressed in text mode. The use of colors is
       however mandatory in case of bar graph mode.

</pre><h4><b>NETATOP</b> <b>OR</b> <b>NETATOP-BPF</b> <b>MODULE</b></h4><pre>
       Per-process and per-thread network activity can be measured by the <u>netatop</u> kernel module or the  <u>netatop-</u>
       <u>bpf</u> BPF module that can be separately installed.
       When  <u>atop</u>  gathers  counters  for  a  new  interval, it verifies if the <u>netatop</u> or <u>netatop-bpf</u> module is
       currently active. If so, <u>atop</u> obtains the relevant network counters from this module and shows the number
       of sent and received packets per process/thread in the generic screen. Besides, detailed counters can  be
       requested by pressing the 'n' key.
       When  the  <u>netatopd</u> daemon is running in combination with the <u>netatop</u> module, <u>atop</u> also reads the network
       counters of exited processes that are logged by this daemon (comparable with process accounting).

       More information about the optional <u>netatop</u> kernel module and the <u>netatopd</u> daemon can  be  found  in  the
       concerning man-pages and on the website mentioned at the end of this manual page.

</pre><h4><b>GPU</b> <b>STATISTICS</b> <b>GATHERING</b></h4><pre>
       GPU  statistics  can  be  gathered  by  <u>atopgpud</u>  which is a separate data collection daemon process.  It
       gathers cumulative utilization counters of every Nvidia  GPU  in  the  system,  as  well  as  utilization
       counters  of  every process that uses a GPU.  When <u>atop</u> notices that the daemon is active, it reads these
       GPU utilization counters with every interval.

       The <u>atopgpud</u> daemon is written in Python, so a Python interpreter  should  be  installed  on  the  target
       system.   For the gathering of the statistics, the <u>pynvml</u> module is used by the daemon. Be sure that this
       module is installed on the target system before activating the daemon, by running the command <u>pip</u> as root
       user:

         <b>pip</b> <b>install</b> <b>nvidia-ml-py</b>

       The <u>atopgpud</u> daemon is installed by default as part of the <b>atop</b> package,  but  it  is  <u>not</u>  automatically
       enabled.  The daemon can be enabled and started now by running the following commands (as root):

         <b>systemctl</b> <b>enable</b> <b>atopgpu</b>
         <b>systemctl</b> <b>start</b> <b>atopgpu</b>

       Find a description about the utilization counters in the section OUTPUT DESCRIPTION.

</pre><h4><b>INTERACTIVE</b> <b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       When  running  <u>atop</u>  interactively (no output redirection), keys can be pressed to control the output. In
       general, lower case keys can be used to show other information for the  active  processes  while  certain
       upper  case keys can be used to influence the sort order of the active process/thread list. Some of these
       keys can also be used to switch from bar graph mode to particular detailed process  information  in  text
       mode.

       <b>g</b>    Show generic output (default).

            Per  process  the  following fields are shown in case of a window-width of 80 positions: process-id,
            CPU consumption during the last interval in system and user mode, the virtual  and  resident  memory
            growth of the process.
            The  data  transfer  per  process  for read/write on disk can only be shown when <u>atop</u> runs with root
            privileges.
            When the optional module <u>netatop</u> or <u>netatop-bpf</u> is loaded, the data  transfer  for  send/receive  of
            network packets is shown for each process.
            The last columns contain the state, the occupation percentage for the chosen resource (default: CPU)
            and the process name.

            When more than 80 positions are available, other information is added.

       <b>m</b>    Show memory related output.

            Per  process  the  following fields are shown in case of a window width of 80 positions: process-id,
            minor and major memory faults, size of virtual  shared  text,  total  virtual  process  size,  total
            resident  process  size,  virtual  and  resident  growth  during  last  interval,  memory occupation
            percentage and process name.

            When more than 80 positions are available, other information is added.

            For memory consumption, always all processes are shown (also the  processes  that  were  not  active
            during the interval).

       <b>d</b>    Show disk-related output.

            When <u>atop</u> runs with root privileges, the following fields are shown: process-id, amount of data read
            from  disk,  amount  of data written to disk, amount of data that was written but has been withdrawn
            again (WCANCL), disk occupation percentage and process name.

       <b>n</b>    Show network related output.

            Per process the following fields are shown in case of a window width of  80  positions:  process-id,
            thread-id,  total  bandwidth  for  received  packets,  total  bandwidth  for sent packets, number of
            received TCP packets with the average size per packet (in bytes), number of sent  TCP  packets  with
            the  average  size  per  packet (in bytes), number of received UDP packets with the average size per
            packet (in bytes), number of sent UDP packets with the average  size  per  packet  (in  bytes),  the
            network occupation percentage and process name.
            This information can only be shown when the optional module <u>netatop</u> or <u>netatop-bpf</u> is installed.

            When more than 80 positions are available, other information is added.

       <b>s</b>    Show scheduling characteristics.

            Per  process  the  following fields are shown in case of a window width of 80 positions: process-id,
            number of threads in state 'running' (R), number of threads in state 'interruptible  sleeping'  (S),
            number  of  threads  in state 'uninterruptible sleeping' (D), number of threads in state 'idle' (I),
            scheduling policy (normal timesharing, realtime round-robin, realtime fifo), nice  value,  priority,
            realtime  priority,  current  processor, status, exit code, state, the occupation percentage for the
            chosen resource and the process name.

            When more than 80 positions are available, other information is added.

       <b>v</b>    Show various process characteristics.

            Per process the following fields are shown in case of a window width of  80  positions:  process-id,
            user  name  and  group,  start  date  and time, status (e.g. exit code if the process has finished),
            state, the occupation percentage for the chosen resource and the process name.

            When more than 80 positions are available, other information is added.

       <b>c</b>    Show the command line of the process.

            Per process the following fields are shown: process-id, the occupation  percentage  for  the  chosen
            resource and the command line including arguments.

       <b>X</b>    Show cgroup v2 information.

            Per  process  the  following  fields  are  shown: process-id, 'cpu.weight' of the cgroup the process
            belongs to, 'cpu.max' value (recalculated as percentage) of the cgroup the process belongs to,  most
            restrictive  'cpu.max'  value  found  in the upper directories, 'memory.max' value of the cgroup the
            process  belongs  to,  most  restrictive  'memory.max'  value  found  in  the   upper   directories,
            'memory.swap.max'  value  of  the  cgroup the process belongs to, most restrictive 'memory.swap.max'
            value found in the upper directories, the command name,  and  the  cgroup  path  name  (horizontally
            scrollable).

       <b>e</b>    Show GPU utilization.

            Per  process  at least the following fields are shown: process-id, range of GPU numbers on which the
            process currently runs, GPU busy percentage on all GPUs, memory busy percentage (i.e. read and write
            accesses on memory) on all GPUs, memory occupation at the  moment  of  the  sample,  average  memory
            occupation during the sample, and GPU percentage.

            When  the  <u>atopgpud</u> daemon does not run with root privileges, the GPU busy percentage and the memory
            busy percentage are not available on process level.  In that case, the  GPU  percentage  on  process
            level reflects the GPU memory occupation instead of the GPU busy percentage (which is preferred).

       <b>o</b>    Show the user-defined line of the process.

            In  the  configuration file the keyword <u>ownprocline</u> can be specified with the description of a user-
            defined output-line.
            Refer to the man-page of <b>atoprc</b> for a detailed description.

       <b>y</b>    Show the individual threads within a process (toggle).

            Single-threaded processes are still shown as one line.
            For multi-threaded processes, one line represents  the  process  while  additional  lines  show  the
            activity  per  individual  thread (in a different color). Depending on the option 'a' (all or active
            toggle), all threads are shown or only the threads  that  were  active  during  the  last  interval.
            Depending  on  the  option  'Y' (sort threads), the threads per process will be sorted on the chosen
            sort criterium or not.
            Whether this key is active or not can be seen in the header line.

       <b>Y</b>    Sort the threads per process when combined with option 'y' (toggle).

       <b>u</b>    Show the process activity accumulated per user.

            Per user the following fields are shown: number  of  processes  active  or  terminated  during  last
            interval  (or  in  total  if  combined  with  command  'a'), accumulated CPU consumption during last
            interval in system and user mode, the current virtual and resident memory space consumed  by  active
            processes (or all processes of the user if combined with command 'a').
            When  <u>atop</u>  runs  with  root privileges, the accumulated read and write throughput on disk is shown.
            When the optional module <u>netatop</u> or <u>netatop-bpf</u>  has  been  installed,  the  accumulated  number  of
            received and sent network packets is shown.
            The  last  columns  contain  the accumulated occupation percentage for the chosen resource (default:
            CPU) and the user name.

       <b>p</b>    Show the process activity accumulated per program (i.e. process name).

            Per program the following fields are shown: number of processes active  or  terminated  during  last
            interval  (or  in  total  if  combined  with  command  'a'), accumulated CPU consumption during last
            interval in system and user mode, the current virtual and resident memory space consumed  by  active
            processes (or all processes of the user if combined with command 'a').
            When  <u>atop</u>  runs  with  root privileges, the accumulated read and write throughput on disk is shown.
            When the optional module <u>netatop</u> or <u>netatop-bpf</u>  has  been  installed,  the  accumulated  number  of
            received and sent network packets is shown.
            The  last  columns  contain  the accumulated occupation percentage for the chosen resource (default:
            CPU) and the program name.

       <b>j</b>    Show the process activity accumulated per container/pod.

            Per container (e.g. Docker/Podman) or pod (e.g. Kubernetes) the following fields are  shown:  number
            of  processes  active or terminated during last interval (or in total if combined with command 'a'),
            accumulated CPU consumption during last interval in system and user mode, the  current  virtual  and
            resident  memory  space  consumed by active processes (or all processes of the user if combined with
            command 'a').
            When <u>atop</u> runs with root privileges, the accumulated read and write throughput  on  disk  is  shown.
            When  the  optional  module  <u>netatop</u>  or  <u>netatop-bpf</u>  has been installed, the accumulated number of
            received and sent network packets is shown.
            The last columns contain the accumulated occupation percentage for  the  chosen  resource  (default:
            CPU) and the container/pod name (CID/POD).

       <b>C</b>    Sort the current list in the order of CPU consumption (default).  The one-but-last column changes to
            'CPU'.

       <b>E</b>    Sort  the  current  list  in  the  order of GPU utilization (preferred, but only applicable when the
            <u>atopgpud</u> daemon runs under root privileges) or the order of GPU memory  occupation).   The  one-but-
            last column changes to 'GPU'.

       <b>M</b>    Sort  the current list in the order of resident memory consumption.  The one-but-last column changes
            to 'MEM'. In case of sorting on memory, the full process list will be shown  (not  only  the  active
            processes).

       <b>D</b>    Sort  the  current  list  in  the order of disk accesses issued.  The one-but-last column changes to
            'DSK'.

       <b>N</b>    Sort the current list in the order of network bandwidth (received and  transmitted).   The  one-but-
            last column changes to 'NET'.

       <b>A</b>    Sort  the  current  list  automatically  in  the  order of the most busy system resource during this
            interval.  The one-but-last column shows either 'ACPU', 'AMEM', 'ADSK' or 'ANET' (the preceding  'A'
            indicates  automatic sorting-order).  The most busy resource is determined by comparing the weighted
            busy-percentages of the system resources, as described earlier in the section COLORS.
            This option remains valid until another sorting-order is explicitly selected again.
            A sorting order for disk is only possible when <u>atop</u> runs with root privileges.
            A sorting order for network is only possible when the optional  module  <u>netatop</u>  or  <u>netatop-bpf</u>  is
            loaded.

       Miscellaneous interactive commands:

       <b>?</b>    Request for help information (also the key 'h' can be pressed).

       <b>V</b>    Request for version information (version number and date).

       <b>R</b>    Gather  and calculate the proportional set size of processes (toggle).  Gathering of all values that
            are needed to calculate the PSIZE of a process is a very time-consuming task,  so  this  key  should
            only be active when analyzing the resident memory consumption of processes.

       <b>W</b>    Get  the  WCHAN per thread (toggle).  Gathering of the WCHAN string per thread is a relatively time-
            consuming task, so this key should only be made active when analyzing the reason for threads  to  be
            in sleep state.

       <b>x</b>    Suppress colors to highlight critical resources (toggle).
            Whether this key is active or not can be seen in the header line.

       <b>z</b>    The  pause key can be used to freeze the current situation in order to investigate the output on the
            screen. While <u>atop</u> is paused, the keys described above can be  pressed  to  show  other  information
            about  the  current  list of processes.  Whenever the pause key is pressed again, atop will continue
            with a next sample.
            The pause key can be used in text mode and bar graph mode.

       <b>i</b>    Modify the interval timer (default: 10 seconds). If an interval timer of 0 is entered, the  interval
            timer  is switched off. In that case a new sample can only be triggered manually by pressing the key
            't'.
            The interval can be modified in text mode and bar graph mode.

       <b>t</b>    Trigger a new sample manually. This key can be pressed if the  current  sample  should  be  finished
            before  the  timer  has exceeded, or if no timer is set at all (interval timer defined as 0). In the
            latter case <u>atop</u> can be used as a stopwatch to  measure  the  load  being  caused  by  a  particular
            application transaction, without knowing on beforehand how many seconds this transaction will last.
            This key can be used in text mode and bar graph mode.

            When  viewing the contents of a raw file this key can be used to show the next sample from the file.
            This key can also be used when viewing raw data via a pipe.

       <b>T</b>    When viewing the contents of a raw file this key can be used to show the previous  sample  from  the
            file, however not when reading raw data from a pipe.
            This key can be used in text mode and bar graph mode.

       <b>b</b>    When  viewing  the  contents  of  a  raw file, this key can be used to branch to a certain timestamp
            within the file either forward or backward.  When viewing raw data from a pipe only forward branches
            are possible.
            This key can be used in text mode and bar graph mode.

       <b>r</b>    Reset all counters to zero to see the system and process activity since boot again.
            This key can be used in text mode and bar graph mode.

            When viewing the contents of a raw file, this key can be used to rewind to the beginning of the file
            again (except when reading raw data from a pipe).

       <b>U</b>    Specify a search string for specific user names as a regular expression.  From now on, only (active)
            processes will be shown from a user which matches the regular expression.  The system statistics are
            still system wide.  If the Enter-key is pressed without specifying a name, (active) processes of all
            users will be shown again.
            Whether this key is active or not can be seen in the header line.

       <b>I</b>    Specify a list with one or more PIDs to be selected.  From now on, only processes will be shown with
            a PID which matches one of the given list.  The system statistics are still  system  wide.   If  the
            Enter-key is pressed without specifying a PID, all (active) processes will be shown again.
            Whether this key is active or not can be seen in the header line.

       <b>P</b>    Specify  a  search  string  for  specific  process names as a regular expression.  From now on, only
            processes will be shown with a name which matches the regular expression.  The system statistics are
            still system wide.  If the Enter-key is pressed without specifying a name,  all  (active)  processes
            will be shown again.
            Whether this key is active or not can be seen in the header line.

       <b>/</b>    Specify  a specific command line search string as a regular expression.  From now on, only processes
            will be shown with a command line which matches the regular expression.  The system  statistics  are
            still  system wide.  If the Enter-key is pressed without specifying a string, all (active) processes
            will be shown again.
            Whether this key is active or not can be seen in the header line.

       <b>J</b>    Specify a container id (e.g. Docker  or  Podman)  or  pod  name  (e.g.  Kubernetes)  of  maximum  15
            characters.  In  case  the  name  is longer, the last 15 characters are expected.  From now on, only
            processes will be shown that run in that specific container or pod.  The system statistics are still
            system wide.  If the Enter-key is pressed without  specifying  a  container  id  or  pod  name,  all
            (active) processes will be shown again.
            Whether this key is active or not can be seen in the header line.

       <b>Q</b>    Specify   a   comma-separated   list   of  process/thread  state  characters.   From  now  on,  only
            processes/threads will be shown  that  are  in  those  specific  states.   Accepted  states  are:  R
            (running),  S  (sleeping),  D  (disk  sleep),  I  (idle), T (stopped), t (tracing stop), X (dead), Z
            (zombie) and P (parked).  The system statistics are still system wide.  If the Enter-key is  pressed
            without specifying a state, all (active) processes/threads will be shown again.
            Whether this key is active or not can be seen in the header line.

       <b>S</b>    Specify  search  strings for specific logical volume names, specific disk names and specific network
            interface names. All search strings are interpreted as a regular expressions.   From  now  on,  only
            those  system resources are shown that match the concerning regular expression.  If the Enter-key is
            pressed without specifying a search string, all (active) system resources of that type will be shown
            again.
            Whether this key is active or not can be seen in the header line.

       <b>a</b>    The 'all/active' key can be used to toggle between only showing/accumulating the processes that were
            active during the last interval (default) or showing/accumulating all processes.
            Whether this key is active or not can be seen in the header line.

       <b>G</b>    By default, <u>atop</u> shows/accumulates the processes that are alive and the processes  that  are  exited
            during the last interval. With this key (toggle), showing/accumulating the processes that are exited
            can be suppressed.
            Whether this key is active or not can be seen in the header line.

       <b>f</b>    Show  a  fixed  (maximum) number of header lines for system resources (toggle).  By default only the
            lines are shown about system resources (CPUs, paging, logical volumes,  disks,  network  interfaces)
            that  really  have  been  active during the last interval.  With this key you can force <u>atop</u> to show
            lines of inactive resources as well.
            Whether this key is active or not can be seen in the header line.

       <b>F</b>    Suppress sorting of system resources (toggle).  By default system resources (CPUs, logical  volumes,
            disks, network interfaces) are sorted on utilization.
            Whether this key is active or not can be seen in the header line.

       <b>1</b>    Show  relevant  counters  as  an  average  per second (in the format '..../s') instead of as a total
            during the interval (toggle).
            Whether this key is active or not can be seen in the header line.

       <b>l</b>    Limit the number of system level lines for the counters per-cpu, the active disks  and  the  network
            interfaces.   By  default  lines are shown of all CPUs, disks and network interfaces which have been
            active during the last interval.  Limiting these lines can be useful on  systems  with  huge  number
            CPUs,  disks  or  interfaces  in  order  to be able to run <u>atop</u> on a screen/window with e.g. only 24
            lines.
            For all mentioned resources the maximum number of lines can be specified interactively.  When  using
            the  flag  <b>-l</b> the maximum number of per-cpu lines is set to 0, the maximum number of disk lines to 5
            and the maximum number of interface lines to 3.  These values can be modified again  in  interactive
            mode.

       <b>k</b>    Send a signal to an active process (a.k.a. kill a process).

       <b>q</b>    Quit the program.
            This key can be used in text mode and bar graph mode.

       <b>PgDn</b> Show the next page of the process/thread list.
            With the arrow-down key the list can be scrolled downwards with single lines.

       <b>^F</b>   Show the next page of the process/thread list (forward).
            With the arrow-down key the list can be scrolled downwards with single lines.

       <b>PgUp</b> Show the previous page of the process/thread list.
            With the arrow-up key the list can be scrolled upwards with single lines.

       <b>^B</b>   Show the previous page of the process/thread list (backward).
            With the arrow-up key the list can be scrolled upwards with single lines.

       <b>^L</b>   Redraw the screen.

</pre><h4><b>RAW</b> <b>DATA</b> <b>STORAGE</b></h4><pre>
       In  order  to  store system and process level statistics for long-term analysis (e.g. to check the system
       load and the active processes running yesterday between 3:00 and 4:00 PM), <u>atop</u> can store the system  and
       process  level  statistics  in  compressed  binary  format in a raw file with the flag <b>-w</b> followed by the
       filename.  If this file already exists and is recognized as a raw data file, <u>atop</u> will append new samples
       to the file (starting with a sample which reflects the activity since boot). If the file does not  exist,
       it will be created.
       All information about system, processes and thread activity is stored in the raw file.
       The  interval  (default:  10  seconds)  and  number  of samples (default: infinite) can be passed as last
       arguments. Instead of the number of samples, the flag <b>-S</b> can be used to indicate that <u>atop</u> should  finish
       anyhow before midnight.

       A  raw file can be read and visualized again with the flag <b>-r</b> followed by the filename. If no filename is
       specified,  the  file  <b>/var/log/atop/atop_</b><u>YYYYMMDD</u>  is  opened  for  input  (where  <u>YYYYMMDD</u>  are  digits
       representing  the  current  date).   If  a filename is specified in the format YYYYMMDD (representing any
       valid date), the file <b>/var/log/atop/atop_</b><u>YYYYMMDD</u> is opened.  If a filename with the symbolic name  <b>y</b>  is
       specified,  yesterday's  daily logfile is opened (this can be repeated so 'yyyy' indicates the logfile of
       four days ago).  If the filename <b>-</b> is used, stdin will be read.
       The samples from the file can be viewed interactively by using the key 't' to show the next  sample,  the
       key  'T' to show the previous sample, the key 'b' to branch to a particular time or the key 'r' to rewind
       to the begin of the file. These keys can be used in text mode as well as in bar graph mode.
       When output is redirected to a file or pipe, <b>atop</b> prints all samples in plain  ASCII.  The  default  line
       length  is  80  characters  in that case. With the flag <b>-L</b> followed by an alternate line length, more (or
       less) columns will be shown.
       With the flag  <b>-b</b>  (begin  time)  and/or  <b>-e</b>  (end  time)  followed  by  a  time  argument  of  the  form
       [YYYYMMDD]hhmm[ss], a certain time period within the raw file can be selected.

       Every  day  at midnight <b>atop</b> is restarted by the <b>atop-rotate.timer</b> and <b>atop-rotate.service</b> unit files, to
       write compressed binary data to the file <b>/var/log/atop/atop_</b><u>YYYYMMDD</u> with an interval of  10  minutes  by
       default.
       Furthermore all raw files are removed that are older than 28 days (by default).
       The  mentioned  default  values  can  be overruled in the file <b>/etc/default/atop</b> that might contain other
       values  for  <b>LOGOPTS</b>  (by  default  without  any  flag),  <b>LOGINTERVAL</b>  (in  seconds,  by  default   600),
       <b>LOGGENERATIONS</b> (in days, by default 28), and <b>LOGPATH</b> (directory in which logfiles are stored).

       Unfortunately, it is not always possible to keep the format of the raw files compatible in newer versions
       of  <b>atop</b>  especially when many new counters have to be maintained.  Therefore, the program <b>atopconvert</b> is
       installed to convert a raw file created by an older version of <b>atop</b> to a raw file that can be read  by  a
       newer version of <b>atop</b> (see the man page of <b>atopconvert</b> for more details).

</pre><h4><b>OUTPUT</b> <b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  first  sample  shows  the system level activity since boot (the elapsed time in the header shows the
       time since boot).

       In text mode, <u>atop</u> first shows the lines related to  system  level  activity  for  every  sample.   If  a
       particular  system  resource  has  not  been  used  during  the interval, the entire line related to this
       resource is suppressed. So the number of system level lines may vary for each sample.
       After that a list is shown of processes which have been active during the last  interval.  This  list  is
       sorted  on  CPU  consumption  by  default, but this order can be changed by the keys which are previously
       described.

       If values have to be shown by <u>atop</u> which do not fit in the column width, another format is used. If  e.g.
       a CPU consumption of 233216 milliseconds should be shown in a column width of 4 positions, it is shown as
       '233s'  (in  seconds).   For  large  memory figures, another unit is chosen if the value does not fit (Mb
       instead of Kb, Gb instead of Mb, Tb instead of Gb, etcetera).  For  other  values,  a  kind  of  exponent
       notation is used (value 123456789 shown in a column of 5 positions gives 123e6).

</pre><h4><b>OUTPUT</b> <b>DESCRIPTION</b> <b>-</b> <b>SYSTEM</b> <b>LEVEL</b></h4><pre>
       The system level information in text mode consists of the following output lines:

       <b>PRC</b>  Process and thread level totals.
            This line contains the total CPU time consumed in system mode ('sys') and in user mode ('user'), the
            total  number  of processes present at this moment ('#proc'), the total number of threads present at
            this  moment  in  state  'running'  ('#trun'),  'sleeping   interruptible'   ('#tslpi'),   'sleeping
            uninterruptible'  ('#tslpu')  and 'idle' ('#tidle'), the number of zombie processes ('#zombie'), the
            number of clone system calls ('clones'), and the number of processes that ended during the  interval
            ('#exit')  when  process  accounting  is  used. Instead of '#exit' the last column may indicate that
            process accounting could not be activated ('no procacct').
            If the screen-width does not allow all of these counters, only a relevant subset is shown.

       <b>CPU</b>  CPU utilization.
            At least one line is shown for the total occupation of all CPUs together.
            In case of a multi-processor system, an additional line is  shown  for  every  individual  processor
            (with  'cpu'  in  lower  case), sorted on activity. Inactive CPUs will not be shown by default.  The
            lines showing the per-cpu occupation contain the CPU number in the  field  combined  with  the  wait
            percentage.

            Every line contains the percentage of CPU time spent in kernel mode by all active processes ('sys'),
            the  percentage  of  CPU  time  consumed  in  user mode ('user') for all active processes (including
            processes running with a nice value larger  than  zero),  the  percentage  of  CPU  time  spent  for
            interrupt  handling  ('irq') including softirq, the percentage of unused CPU time while no processes
            were waiting for disk I/O ('idle'), and the percentage of unused CPU time while at least one process
            was waiting for disk I/O ('wait').
            In case of per-cpu occupation, the CPU number and the wait  percentage  ('w')  for  that  CPU.   The
            number of lines showing the per-cpu occupation can be limited.

            For  virtual  machines,  the  steal-percentage  ('steal') shows the percentage of CPU time stolen by
            other virtual machines running on the same hardware.
            For physical machines hosting one or more virtual machines, the guest percentage ('guest') shows the
            percentage of CPU time used by the virtual machines. Notice that this percentage overlaps  the  user
            percentage!

            When PMC performance monitoring counters are supported by the CPU and the kernel (and <u>atop</u> runs with
            root  privileges),  the  number  of  instructions  per CPU cycle ('ipc') is shown.  The first sample
            always shows the value 'initial', because the counters are just activated at the moment that <u>atop</u> is
            started.
            When the <u>CPU</u> <u>busy</u> <u>percentage</u> <u>is</u> <u>high</u> and the IPC is less than 1.0, it is  likely  that  the  CPU  is
            frequently  waiting  for  memory  access  during  instruction execution (larger CPU caches or faster
            memory might be helpful to improve performance).  When the <u>CPU</u> <u>busy</u> <u>percentage</u> <u>is</u> <u>high</u> and  the  IPC
            is  greater  than  1.0,  it  is likely that the CPU is instruction-bound (more/faster cores might be
            helpful to improve performance).
            Furthermore, per CPU the effective number of cycles ('cycl') is shown.  This  value  can  reach  the
            current CPU frequency if such CPU is 100% busy.  When an idle CPU is halted, the number of effective
            cycles can be (considerably) lower than the current frequency.
            Notice that the <u>average</u> instructions per cycle and number of cycles is shown in the CPU line for all
            CPUs.
            Beware  that  reading  the  cycle  counter  in virtual machines (guests) might introduce performance
            delays. Therefore this metric is by default disabled in virtual machines. However, with the  keyword
            'perfevents'  in  the  atoprc  file  this metric can be explicitly set to 'enable' or 'disable' (see
            separate man-page of atoprc).

            In case of frequency scaling, all previously mentioned CPU percentages  are  relative  to  the  used
            scaling  of  the CPU during the interval.  If a CPU has been active for e.g. 50% in user mode during
            the interval while the frequency scaling of that CPU was 40%, only 20% of the full capacity  of  the
            CPU has been used in user mode.
            In  case  that the kernel module 'cpufreq_stats' is active (after issuing 'modprobe cpufreq_stats'),
            the <u>average</u> frequency ('avgf') and the <u>average</u> scaling percentage ('avgscal')  is  shown.  Otherwise
            the <u>current</u> frequency ('curf') and the <u>current</u> scaling percentage ('curscal') is shown at the moment
            that the sample is taken.  Notice that <u>average</u> values for frequency and scaling are shown in the CPU
            line for every CPU.
            Frequency  scaling  statistics are only gathered for systems with maximum 8 CPUs, since gathering of
            these values per CPU is very time consuming.

            If the screen-width does not allow all of these counters, only a relevant subset is shown.

       <b>CPL</b>  CPU load information.
            This line contains the load average figures reflecting the number of threads that are  available  to
            run  on  a  CPU  (i.e.  part  of  the  runqueue) or that are waiting for disk I/O. These figures are
            averaged over 1 ('avg1'), 5 ('avg5') and 15 ('avg15') minutes.
            Furthermore the number of context switches ('csw'), the number of serviced interrupts  ('intr')  and
            the number of available CPUs are shown.

            If the screen-width does not allow all of these counters, only a relevant subset is shown.

       <b>GPU</b>  GPU utilization (Nvidia).
            Read  the section GPU STATISTICS GATHERING in this document to find the details about the activation
            of the <u>atopgpud</u> daemon.

            In the first column of every line, the bus-id (last nine characters) and the GPU number  are  shown.
            The  subsequent  columns  show the percentage of time that one or more kernels were executing on the
            GPU ('gpubusy'), the percentage of time that global  (device)  memory  was  being  read  or  written
            ('membusy'),  the occupation percentage of memory ('memocc'), the total memory ('total'), the memory
            being in use at the moment of the sample ('used'), the average memory being in use during the sample
            time ('usavg'), the number of processes being active  on  the  GPU  at  the  moment  of  the  sample
            ('#proc'), and the type of GPU.

            If the screen-width does not allow all of these counters, only a relevant subset is shown.
            The number of lines showing the GPUs can be limited.

       <b>MEM</b>  Memory occupation (two lines).
            These  lines  contain  the  total  amount  of physical memory ('tot'), the amount of memory which is
            currently free ('free'), the amount of memory that is available for new  workloads  without  pushing
            the  system  into  swap  ('avail'),  the  amount  of memory in use as page cache including the total
            resident shared memory ('cache'), the amount of memory within the page cache that has to be  flushed
            to disk ('dirty'), the amount of memory used for filesystem meta data ('buff'), the amount of memory
            being used for kernel mallocs ('slab'), the amount of slab memory that is reclaimable ('slrec'), the
            resident  size  of SYSV shared memory including tmpfs but excluding static huge pages ('shmem'), the
            resident size of SYSV shared memory including static huge pages ('shrss'), the amount of SYSV shared
            memory that is currently swapped ('shswp'), the amount of memory that is  currently  used  for  page
            tables  ('pgtab'), the number of NUMA nodes in this system ('numnode'), the amount of memory that is
            currently claimed by vmware's balloon driver ('vmbal'), the  amount  of  memory  that  is  currently
            claimed  by  the ARC (cache) of ZFSonlinux ('zfarc'), the amount of memory for anonymous transparent
            huge pages ('anthp'), the amount of memory that is claimed for huge pages ('hptot'), the  amount  of
            huge  page memory that is really in use ('hpuse'), the amount of memory that is used for TCP sockets
            ('tcps'), and the amount of memory that is used for UDP sockets ('udps').

            If the screen-width does not allow all of these counters, only a relevant subset is shown.

       <b>SWP</b>  Swap occupation and overcommit info.
            This line contains the total amount of swap space on disk ('tot'), the amount  of  free  swap  space
            ('free'),  the  size  of  the  swap  cache  ('swcac'), the size of compressed storage used for zswap
            ('zswap'), the real (decompressed) size of the pages stored in zswap ('zstor'), the  total  size  of
            the  memory used for KSM ('ksuse', i.e. shared), and the total size of the memory saved (deduped) by
            KSM ('kssav', i.e. sharing).
            Furthermore the committed virtual memory space ('vmcom') and the  maximum  limit  of  the  committed
            space  ('vmlim',  which  is  by  default swap size plus 50% of memory size) is shown.  The committed
            space is the reserved virtual space for all allocations of private memory space for  processes.  The
            kernel  only verifies whether the committed space exceeds the limit if strict overcommit handling is
            configured (vm.overcommit_memory is 2).

       <b>LLC</b>  Last-Level Cache of CPU info.
            This line contains the total memory bandwidth of LLC ('tot'), the bandwidth of the local  NUMA  node
            ('loc'), and the percentage of LLC in use ('LLCXX YY%').

            Note that this feature depends on the 'resctrl' pseudo filesystem.  Be sure that the kernel is built
            with the relevant config and take care that the pseudo-filesystem is mounted:

              <b>mount</b> <b>-t</b> <b>resctrl</b> <b>resctrl</b> <b>-o</b> <b>mba_MBps</b> <b>/sys/fs/resctrl</b> (on Intel)
              <b>mount</b> <b>-t</b> <b>resctrl</b> <b>resctrl</b> <b>-o</b> <b>cdp</b>      <b>/sys/fs/resctrl</b> (on AMD)

       <b>NUM</b>  Memory utilization per NUMA node (not shown for single NUMA node).
            This  line shows the total amount of physical memory of this node ('tot'), the amount of free memory
            ('free'), the amount of memory for cached file data ('file'), modified cached file  data  ('dirty'),
            recently  used  memory  ('activ'), less recently used memory ('inact'), memory being used for kernel
            mallocs ('slab'), the amount of slab memory that is reclaimable ('slrec'), shared  memory  including
            tmpfs  ('shmem'),  total  huge  pages  ('hptot'),  used  huge  pages('hpuse'), and the fragmentation
            percentage ('frag').

       <b>NUC</b>  CPU utilization per NUMA node (not shown for single NUMA node).
            This line shows the utilization percentages of all CPUs related to this NUMA node,  categorized  for
            system  mode  ('sys'),  user  mode  ('user'),  user  mode  for  niced processes ('niced'), idle mode
            ('idle'), wait mode ('w' preceded by the node number), irq  mode  ('irq'),  softirq  mode  ('sirq'),
            steal mode ('steal'), and guest mode ('guest') overlapping user mode.

       <b>PAG</b>  Paging frequency.
            This line contains the number of scanned pages ('scan') due to the fact that free memory drops below
            a  particular  threshold,  the  number  of reclaimed pages('steal') due to the fact that free memory
            drops below a particular threshold, the number times that the kernel tries to reclaim pages  due  to
            an  urgent  need  ('stall'),the  number  of process stalls to run memory compaction to allocate huge
            pages ('compact'), the number of NUMA pages migrated ('numamig'), and the  total  number  of  memory
            pages migrated successfully e.g. between NUMA nodes or for compaction ('migrate') are shown.
            Also  the  number  of memory pages the system read from block devices ('pgin'), the number of memory
            pages the system wrote to block devices ('pgout'), the number of memory pages swapped in from  zswap
            ('zswin'),  the  number  of memory pages swapped out to zswap ('zswout'), the number of memory pages
            the system read from swap space ('swin'), the number of memory pages the system wrote to swap  space
            ('swout'), and the number of out-of-memory kills ('oomkill').

       <b>PSI</b>  Pressure Stall Information.
            This  line  contains  percentages  about  resource  pressure related to CPU, memory and I/O. Certain
            percentages refer to 'some' meaning  that  some  processes/threads  were  delayed  due  to  resource
            overload.  Other  percentages  refer  to 'full' meaning a loss of overall throughput due to resource
            overload.
            The values 'cpusome', 'memsome', 'memfull', 'iosome'  and  'iofull'  show  the  pressure  percentage
            during the entire interval.
            The  values  'cs'  (cpu some), 'ms' (memory some), 'mf' (memory full), 'is' (I/O some) and 'if' (I/O
            full) each show three percentages separated by slashes: pressure percentage over the last 10, 60 and
            300 seconds.

       <b>LVM/MDD/DSK</b>
            Logical volume/multiple device/disk utilization.
            Per active unit one line is produced, sorted on unit activity.   Such  line  shows  the  name  (e.g.
            VolGroup00-lvtmp for a logical volume or sda for a hard disk), the percentage of elapsed time during
            which  I/O  requests  were  issued to the device ('busy') (note that for devices serving requests in
            parallel, such as RAID arrays, SSD and NVMe, this number does not reflect their performance limits),
            the number of read requests issued ('read'), the number of  write  requests  issued  ('write'),  the
            number  of  discard requests issued ('discrd') if supported by kernel version, the number of KiBytes
            per read ('KiB/r'), the number of KiBytes per write ('KiB/w'), the number  of  KiBytes  per  discard
            ('KiB/d')  if  supported  by  kernel  version, the number of MiBytes per second throughput for reads
            ('MBr/s'), the number of MiBytes per second throughput for writes ('MBw/s'), requests issued to  the
            device  driver  but  not  completed  ('inflt'),  the  average queue depth while busy ('avq') and the
            average number of milliseconds needed by a request ('avio') for seek, latency and data transfer.
            If the screen-width does not allow all of these counters, only a relevant subset is shown.

            The number of lines showing the units can be limited per class (LVM, MDD or DSK) with the 'l' key or
            statically (see separate man-page of atoprc).  By specifying the value 0 for a particular class,  no
            lines will be shown any more for that class.

       <b>NFM</b>  Network Filesystem (NFS) mount at the client side.
            For  each  NFS-mounted  filesystem,  a line is shown that contains the mounted server directory, the
            name of the server ('srv'), the total number of bytes physically read from the server  ('read')  and
            the  total  number of bytes physically written to the server ('write').  Data transfer is subdivided
            in the number of bytes read via normal read() system calls ('nread'), the number  of  bytes  written
            via  normal  read()  system  calls ('nwrit'), the number of bytes read via direct I/O ('dread'), the

            ('badfmt') or a bad authorization ('badaut'), and a counter indicating the  number  of  bad  clients
            ('badcln').

       <b>NET</b>  Network utilization (TCP/IP).
            One  line  is shown for activity of the transport layer (TCP and UDP), one line for the IP layer and
            one line per active interface.
            For the transport layer, counters are shown concerning the number of received TCP segments including
            those received in error ('tcpi'), the number of transmitted  TCP  segments  excluding  &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;  HEAD

            protocols  ('deliv'), the number of received ICMP datagrams ('icmpi'), and the number of transmitted
            ICMP datagrams ('icmpo').
            If the screen-width does not allow all of these counters, only a relevant subset is shown.
            These counters are related to IPv4 and IPv6 combined.

            For every active network interface one line is shown, sorted on the interface activity.   Such  line
            shows  the  name  of the interface and its busy percentage in the first column.  The busy percentage
            for half duplex is determined by comparing the interface speed with the number of  bits  transmitted
            and  received per second; for full duplex the interface speed is compared with the highest of either
            the transmitted or the received bits.  When the interface speed can not be determined (e.g. for  the
            loopback interface), '---' is shown instead of the percentage.
            Furthermore the number of received packets ('pcki'), the number of transmitted packets ('pcko'), the
            line  speed  of  the  interface ('sp'), the effective amount of bits received per second ('si'), the
            effective amount of bits transmitted per second ('so'),  the  number  of  collisions  ('coll'),  the
            number  of  received  multicast  packets  ('mlti'),  the  number  of errors while receiving a packet
            ('erri'), the number of errors while transmitting a packet ('erro'), the number of received  packets
            dropped ('drpi'), and the number of transmitted packets dropped ('drpo').
            If the screen-width does not allow all of these counters, only a relevant subset is shown.
            The number of lines showing the network interfaces can be limited.

       <b>IFB</b>  Infiniband utilization.
            For every active Infiniband port one line is shown, sorted on activity.  Such line shows the name of
            the  port  and its busy percentage in the first column.  The busy percentage is determined by taking
            the highest of either the transmitted or the received bits during  the  interval,  multiplying  that
            value by the number of lanes and comparing it against the maximum port speed.
            Furthermore  the  number  of received packets divided by the number of lanes ('pcki'), the number of
            transmitted packets divided by the number of lanes ('pcko'), the  maximum  line  speed  ('sp'),  the
            effective  amount  of  bits received per second ('si'), the effective amount of bits transmitted per
            second ('so'), and the number of lanes ('lanes').
            If the screen-width does not allow all of these counters, only a relevant subset is shown.
            The number of lines showing the Infiniband ports can be limited.

</pre><h4><b>OUTPUT</b> <b>DESCRIPTION</b> <b>-</b> <b>PROCESS</b> <b>LEVEL</b></h4><pre>
       Following the system level information, a list of processes is shown in text mode from which the resource
       utilization has changed during the last interval. These processes might have used CPU time or might  have
       issued disk or network requests.  However a process is also shown if part of it has been paged out due to
       lack of memory (while the process itself was in sleep state).

       Per  process  the  following fields may be shown (in alphabetical order), depending on the current output
       mode as described in the section INTERACTIVE COMMANDS and depending on the current width of your window:

       <b>AVGRSZ</b>   The average size of one read-action on disk.

       <b>AVGWSZ</b>   The average size of one write-action on disk.

       <b>BANDWI</b>   Total bandwidth for received TCP and UDP packets consumed  by  this  process  (bits-per-second).
                This  value  can  be  compared  with  the  value  'si'  on  interface  level (used bandwidth per
                interface).
                This information will only be shown when the optional module <u>netatop</u> or <u>netatop-bpf</u> is loaded.

       <b>BANDWO</b>   Total bandwidth for sent TCP and UDP packets consumed by this process  (bits-per-second).   This
                value can be compared with the value 'so' on interface level (used bandwidth per interface).
                This information will only be shown when the optional module <u>netatop</u> or <u>netatop-bpf</u> is loaded.

       <b>BDELAY</b>   Aggregated block I/O delay, i.e. time waiting for disk I/O.

       <b>CGROUP</b>   Path  name  of the cgroup (version 2) to which this process belongs.  This path name is relative
                to the cgroup root directory, which is usually '<a href="file:/sys/fs/cgroup">/sys/fs/cgroup</a>'.

       <b>CID/POD</b>  Container  id  (e.g.  Docker  or  Podman)  or  pod  name  (e.g.  Kubernetes)  referring  to  the
                container/pod  in  which  the  process/thread  is  running.   When  a pod name is longer than 15
                characters, only the last 15 characters are shown.

                If a process has been started and finished during the last interval, a '?' is shown because  the
                container id or pod name is not part of the standard process accounting record.

                This  column  will  only be shown when <u>atop</u> runs with superuser privileges and when at least one
                containerized process is detected.

       <b>CMD</b>      The name of the process.  This name can be surrounded by "less/greater  than"  signs  ('&lt;name&gt;')
                which  means  that the process has finished during the last interval. A single accounting record
                is written for the entire process on termination of the last thread in  the  process.  When  the
                main thread exits, the process name is changed to the thread name.
                Behind  the  abbreviation 'CMD' in the header line, the current page number and the total number
                of pages of the process/thread list are shown.

       <b>COMMAND-LINE</b>
                The full command line of the process (including arguments). If the length of  the  command  line
                exceeds  the  length  of  the  screen  line, the arrow keys -&gt; and &lt;- can be used for horizontal
                scroll.

                The '-z &lt;regex&gt;' command line option can be used to prepend matching  environment  variables  to
                the  displayed  command  line. POSIX Extended Regular Expression syntax are used (see <a href="../man3/regex.3.html">regex</a>(3)).
                When a matching environment variable is too long (exceeding the buffer that should  contain  the
                command line), it will be truncated.
                Behind  the verb 'COMMAND-LINE' in the header line, the current page number and the total number
                of pages of the process/thread list are shown.

       <b>CPU</b>      The occupation percentage of this process related to the available capacity for this resource on
                system level.

       <b>CPUMAX</b>   The 'cpu.max' value of the cgroup (version 2) to  which  this  process  belongs,  calculated  as
                percentage of one CPU.

       <b>CPUMAXR</b>  The  most  restrictive  (i.e. effective) 'cpu.max' value defined by the upper directories of the
                cgroup (version 2) to which this process belongs, calculated as percentage of one CPU.

       <b>CPUNR</b>    The identification of the CPU the (main) thread is running on or has recently been running on.

       <b>CPUWGT</b>   The 'cpu.weight' value of the cgroup (version 2) to which this process belongs.

       <b>CTID</b>     Container ID (OpenVZ).  If a process has been started and finished during the last  interval,  a
                '?' is shown because the container ID is not part of the standard process accounting record.

       <b>DSK</b>      The  occupation  percentage  of  this  process related to the total load that is produced by all
                processes (i.e. total disk accesses by all processes during the last interval).
                This information is shown when per process "storage accounting" is active in the kernel.

       <b>EGID</b>     Effective group-id under which this process executes.

       <b>ENDATE</b>   Date that the process has been finished. If the process  is  still  running,  this  field  shows
                'active'.

       <b>ENTIME</b>   Time  that  the  process  has  been  finished. If the process is still running, this field shows
                'active'.

       <b>FSGID</b>    Filesystem group-id under which this process executes.

       <b>FSUID</b>    Filesystem user-id under which this process executes.

       <b>GPU</b>      When  the <u>atopgpud</u> daemon does not run with root privileges, the GPU percentage reflects the GPU
                memory occupation percentage (memory of all GPUs is 100%).
                When the <u>atopgpud</u> daemon runs with root privileges, the GPU percentage  reflects  the  GPU  busy
                percentage.

       <b>GPUBUSY</b>  Busy percentage on all GPUs (one GPU is 100%).
                When the <u>atopgpud</u> daemon does not run with root privileges, this value is not available.

       <b>GPUNUMS</b>  Comma-separated  list  of GPUs used by the process during the interval. When the comma-separated
                list exceeds the width of the column, a hexadecimal value is shown.

       <b>MAJFLT</b>   The number of page faults issued by this process that have been solved by  creating/loading  the
                requested memory page.

       <b>MEM</b>      The occupation percentage of this process related to the available capacity for this resource on
                system level.

       <b>MEMAVG</b>   Average memory occupation during the interval on all used GPUs.

       <b>MEMBUSY</b>  Busy  percentage  of  memory  on  all GPUs (one GPU is 100%), i.e.  the time needed for read and
                write accesses on memory.
                When the <u>atopgpud</u> daemon does not run with root privileges, this value is not available.

       <b>MEMMAX</b>   The 'memory.max' value of the cgroup (version 2) to which this process belongs.

       <b>MEMNOW</b>   Memory occupation at the moment of the sample on all used GPUs.

       <b>MMMAXR</b>   The most restrictive (i.e. effective) 'memory.max' value defined by the upper directories of the

       <b>MINFLT</b>   The number of page faults issued by this  process  that  have  been  solved  by  reclaiming  the
                requested memory page from the free list of pages.

       <b>NET</b>      The  occupation  percentage  of  this  process related to the total load that is produced by all
                processes (i.e. consumed network bandwidth of all processes during the last interval).
                This information will only be shown when the optional module <u>netatop</u> or <u>netatop-bpf</u> is loaded.

       <b>NICE</b>     The more or less static priority that can be given to a  process  on  a  scale  from  -20  (high
                priority) to +19 (low priority).

       <b>NIVCSW</b>   Number  of  times  the  process/thread was context-switched involuntarily, in case that the time
                slice expired.

       <b>NPROCS</b>   The number of active and terminated processes accumulated for this user or program.

       <b>NVCSW</b>    Number of times that the process/thread was context-switched voluntarily in case of  a  blocking
                system call, e.g. to wait for an I/O operation to complete.

       <b>PID</b>      Process-id.  If a process has been started and finished during the last interval, a '?' is shown
                because the process-id is not part of the standard process accounting record.

       <b>POLI</b>     The  policies  'norm'  (normal,  which  is  SCHED_OTHER),  'btch'  (batch)  and  'idle' refer to
                timesharing processes.  The policies  'fifo'  (SCHED_FIFO)  and  'rr'  (round  robin,  which  is
                SCHED_RR) refer to realtime processes.

       <b>PPID</b>     Parent process-id.  If a process has been started and finished during the last interval, value 0
                is shown because the parent process-id is not part of the standard process accounting record.

       <b>PRI</b>      The  process'  priority ranges from 0 (highest priority) to 139 (lowest priority). Priority 0 to
                99 are used for realtime processes (fixed priority independent of their behavior)  and  priority
                100  to  139  for  timesharing  processes  (variable  priority  depending  on  their  recent CPU
                consumption and the nice value).

       <b>PSIZE</b>    The proportional memory size of this process (or user).
                Every process shares resident memory with other processes. E.g. when  a  particular  program  is
                started  several  times,  the code pages (text) are only loaded once in memory and shared by all
                incarnations. Also the code of shared libraries is shared by all  processes  using  that  shared
                library,  as  well  as  shared  memory  and memory-mapped files.  For the PSIZE calculation of a
                process, the resident memory of a process that is shared with other processes is divided by  the
                number  of sharers.  This means, that every process is accounted for a proportional part of that
                memory. Accumulating the PSIZE values of all processes in the system gives a reliable impression
                of the total resident memory consumed by all processes.
                Since gathering of all values that are needed to calculate the PSIZE is  a  very  time-consuming
                task,  the  'R'  key  (or  '-R'  flag)  should  be  active. Gathering these values also requires
                superuser privileges (otherwise '?K' is shown in the output).
                If a process has finished during the last interval, no value is  shown  since  the  proportional
                memory size is not part of the standard process accounting record.

       <b>RDDSK</b>    The  read  data  transfer  issued  physically  on  disk  (so  reading from the disk cache is not
                accounted for).
                Unfortunately, the kernel aggregates the data transfer of a process to the data transfer of  its
                parent  process  when  terminating, so you might see transfers for (parent) processes like cron,
                bash or init, that are not really issued by them.

       <b>RDELAY</b>   Runqueue delay, i.e. time spent waiting on a runqueue.

       <b>RGID</b>     The real group-id under which the process executes.

       <b>RGROW</b>    The amount of resident memory that the process has grown during the last  interval.  A  resident
                growth  can  be  caused by touching memory pages which were not physically created/loaded before
                (load-on-demand).  Note that a resident growth can also  be  negative  e.g.  when  part  of  the
                process  is  paged  out  due  to  lack of memory or when the process frees dynamically allocated
                memory.  For a process which started during the last interval, the resident growth reflects  the
                total resident size of the process at that moment.
                If  a  process  has  finished  during the last interval, no value is shown since resident memory
                occupation is not part of the standard process accounting record.

       <b>RNET</b>     The number of TCP- and UDP packets received by this process.   This  information  will  only  be
                shown when the optional module <u>netatop</u> or <u>netatop-bpf</u> is installed.
                If a process has finished during the last interval, no value is shown since network counters are
                not part of the standard process accounting record.

       <b>RSIZE</b>    The  total resident memory usage consumed by this process (or user).  Notice that the RSIZE of a
                process includes all resident memory used by that process, even  if  certain  memory  parts  are
                shared with other processes (see also the explanation of PSIZE).
                If  a  process  has  finished  during the last interval, no value is shown since resident memory
                occupation is not part of the standard process accounting record.

       <b>RTPR</b>     Realtime priority according the POSIX standard.  Value  can  be  0  for  a  timesharing  process
                (policy  'norm',  'btch'  or  'idle') or ranges from 1 (lowest) till 99 (highest) for a realtime
                process (policy 'rr' or 'fifo').

       <b>RUID</b>     The real user-id under which the process executes.

       <b>S</b>        The current state of the (main)  thread:  'R'  for  running  (currently  processing  or  in  the
                runqueue),  'S'  for  sleeping interruptible (wait for an event to occur), 'D' for sleeping non-
                interruptible, 'Z' for zombie (waiting to be synchronized with  its  parent  process),  'T'  for
                stopped  (suspended  or  traced),  'W'  for  swapping,  and  'E' (exit) for processes which have
                finished during the last interval.

       <b>SGID</b>     The saved group-id of the process.

       <b>SNET</b>     The number of TCP and UDP packets transmitted by this process.  This information  will  only  be
                shown when the optional module <u>netatop</u> or <u>netatop-bpf</u> is installed.

       <b>ST</b>       The status of a process.
                The first position indicates if the process has been started during the last interval (the value
                <u>N</u> means 'new process').

                The second position indicates if the process has been finished during the last interval.
                The  value  <u>E</u>  means  'exit'  on  the process' own initiative; the exit code is displayed in the
                column 'EXC'.
                The value <u>S</u> means that the process has been terminated unvoluntarily by  a  signal;  the  signal
                number is displayed in the in the column 'EXC'.
                The  value  <u>C</u>  means that the process has been terminated unvoluntarily by a signal, producing a
                core dump in its current directory; the signal number is displayed in the column 'EXC'.

       <b>STDATE</b>   The start date of the process.

       <b>STTIME</b>   The start time of the process.

       <b>SUID</b>     The saved user-id of the process.

       <b>SWPMAX</b>   The 'memory.swap.max' value of the cgroup (version 2) to which this process belongs.

       <b>SWAPSZ</b>   The swap space consumed by this process (or user).

       <b>SWMAXR</b>   The most restrictive (i.e. effective) 'memory.swap.max' value defined by the  upper  directories
                of the cgroup (version 2) to which this process belongs.

       <b>SYSCPU</b>   CPU  time  consumption  of this process in system mode (kernel mode), usually due to system call
                handling.

       <b>TCPRASZ</b>  The average size of a received TCP buffer in bytes.  This information will only  be  shown  when
                the optional module <u>netatop</u> or <u>netatop-bpf</u> is installed.

       <b>TCPRCV</b>   The  number  of TCP packets received for this process.  This information will only be shown when
                the optional module <u>netatop</u> or <u>netatop-bpf</u> is installed.

       <b>TCPSASZ</b>  The average size of a transmitted TCP buffer in bytes.  This information will only be shown when
                the optional module <u>netatop</u> or <u>netatop-bpf</u> is installed.

       <b>THR</b>      Total  number  of  threads  within  this process.  All related threads are contained in a thread
                group, represented by <u>atop</u> as one line or as a separate line when the 'y' key (or  -y  flag)  is
                active.

                On  Linux  2.4  systems  it  is  hardly possible to determine which threads (i.e. processes) are
                related to the same thread group.  Every thread is represented by <u>atop</u> as a separate line.

       <b>TID</b>      Thread-id.  All threads within a process run with the same PID but with a  different  TID.  This
                value is shown for individual threads in multi-threaded processes (when using the key 'y').

       <b>TIDLE</b>    Number  of  threads  within  this process that are in the state 'idle' (I), i.e. uninterruptible
                sleeping threads that do not count for the load average.

                the optional module <u>netatop</u> or <u>netatop-bpf</u> is installed.

       <b>USRCPU</b>   CPU time consumption of this process in user mode, due to processing the own program text.

       <b>VDATA</b>    The  virtual  memory  size  of  the private data used by this process (including heap and shared
                library data).

       <b>VGROW</b>    The amount of virtual memory that the process has grown during  the  last  interval.  A  virtual
                growth  can be caused by e.g. issuing a malloc() or attaching a shared memory segment. Note that
                a virtual growth can also be negative by e.g. issuing a free()  or  detaching  a  shared  memory
                segment.   For a process which started during the last interval, the virtual growth reflects the
                total virtual size of the process at that moment.
                If a process has finished during the last interval, no  value  is  shown  since  virtual  memory
                occupation is not part of the standard process accounting record.

       <b>VPID</b>     Virtual  process-id  (within  an  OpenVZ container).  If a process has been started and finished
                during the last interval, a '?' is shown because the virtual  process-id  is  not  part  of  the
                standard process accounting record.

       <b>VSIZE</b>    The total virtual memory usage consumed by this process (or user).
                If  a  process  has  finished  during  the last interval, no value is shown since virtual memory
                occupation is not part of the standard process accounting record.

       <b>VSLIBS</b>   The virtual memory size of the (shared) text of all shared libraries used by this process.

       <b>VSTACK</b>   The virtual memory size of the (private) stack used by this process

       <b>VSTEXT</b>   The virtual memory size of the (shared) text of the executable program.

       <b>WCHAN</b>    Wait channel of thread in sleep state, i.e. the name of the kernel function in which the  thread
                has been put asleep.
                Since  determining  the  name string of the kernel function is a relatively time-consuming task,
                the 'W' key (or '-W' flag) should be active.

       <b>WRDSK</b>    The write data transfer issued physically on disk (so writing to the disk cache is not accounted
                for).  This counter is maintained for the application process that writes its data to the  cache
                (assuming  that  this  data  is  physically  transferred to disk later on). Notice that disk I/O
                needed for swapping is not taken into account.
                Unfortunately, the kernel aggregates the data transfer of a process to the data transfer of  its
                parent  process  when  terminating, so you might see transfers for (parent) processes like cron,
                bash or init, that are not really issued by them.

       <b>WCANCL</b>   The write data transfer previously accounted for this process or another process that  has  been
                cancelled.   Suppose  that  a  process  writes new data to a file and that data is removed again
                before the cache buffers have been flushed to disk.  Then the original process shows the written
                data as WRDSK, while the process that removes/truncates the file  shows  the  unflushed  removed
                data as WCANCL.

</pre><h4><b>PARSABLE</b> <b>OUTPUT</b></h4><pre>
       With  the flag <b>-P</b> followed by a list of one or more labels (comma-separated), parsable output is produced
       for each sample.  The labels that can be specified for system-level statistics correspond to  the  labels
       (first verb of each line) that can be found in the interactive output: "CPU", "cpu", "CPL", "GPU", "MEM",
       "SWP", "PAG", "PSI", "LVM", "MDD", "DSK", "NFM", "NFC", "NFS", "NET", "IFB", "LLC", "NUM" and "NUC".
       For  process-level  statistics  special  labels are available: "PRG" (general), "PRC" (CPU), "PRE" (GPU),
       "PRM" (memory), "PRD" (disk, only if "storage accounting" is active) and  "PRN"  (network,  only  if  the
       optional module <u>netatop</u> or <u>netatop-bpf</u> is installed).
       With the label "ALL", all system and process level statistics are shown.

       The  command  and  command  line in the parsable output might contain spaces and are therefore by default
       surrounded by parenthesis. However, since a space is often  used  as  separator  between  the  fields  by
       parsing tools, with the additional flag <b>-Z</b> it is possible to exchange the spaces in the command (line) by
       underscores and omit the parenthesis.

       For  every  interval all requested lines are shown whereafter <b>atop</b> shows a line just containing the label
       "SEP" as a separator before the lines for the next sample are generated.
       When a sample contains the values since boot, <b>atop</b> shows a line just containing the label "RESET"  before
       the lines for this sample are generated.

       The  first  part of each output-line consists of the following six fields: <b>label</b> (the name of the label),

                transmitted,  number of UDP-packets received, cumulative size of UDP-packets transmitted, number
                of raw packets transmitted (obsolete, always 0),  number  of  raw  packets  received  (obsolete,
                always 0), TGID (group number of related tasks/threads) and is_process (y/n).
                If the kernel module is not active, the network I/O counters per process are not relevant.

</pre><h4><b>JSON</b> <b>OUTPUT</b></h4><pre>
       With  the flag <b>-J</b> followed by a list of one or more labels (comma-separated), JSON output is produced for
       each sample. The syntax and name of JSON labels are the same as for the parsable output.

</pre><h4><b>SIGNALS</b></h4><pre>
       By sending the SIGUSR1 signal to <u>atop</u> a new sample will be forced, even if the current timer interval has
       not exceeded yet. The behavior is similar to pressing the 't' key in an interactive session.

       By sending the SIGUSR2 signal to <u>atop</u> a final sample will be forced after which <u>atop</u> will terminate.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       To monitor the current system load in text mode with an interval of (default) 10 seconds:

         <b>atop</b>

       To monitor the current system load as bar graphs with an interval of 5 seconds:

         <b>atop</b> <b>-B</b> <b>5</b>

       Store information about the system and process activity in binary compressed  form  to  a  file  with  an
       interval of ten minutes during an hour:

         <b>atop</b> <b>-w</b> <b>/tmp/atop.raw</b> <b>600</b> <b>6</b>

       View the contents of this file interactively:

         <b>atop</b> <b>-r</b> <b>/tmp/atop.raw</b>

       View the processor and disk utilization of this file in parsable format:

         <b>atop</b> <b>-PCPU,DSK</b> <b>-r</b> <b>/tmp/atop.raw</b>

       View the contents of today's standard logfile interactively:

         <b>atop</b> <b>-r</b>

       View the contents of the standard logfile of the day before yesterday interactively:

         <b>atop</b> <b>-r</b> <b>yy</b>

       View the contents of the standard logfile of 2023, April 15 from 02:00 PM onwards interactively:

         <b>atop</b> <b>-r</b> <b>20230415</b> <b>-b</b> <b>1400</b>

       Concatenate all raw log files of March 2023 and generate parsable output about the CPU utilization:

         <b>atopcat</b> <b>/var/log/atop/atop_202303??</b> <b>|</b> <b>atop</b> <b>-r</b> <b>-</b> <b>-PCPU</b>

       To  monitor the system load and write it to a file (in plain ASCII) with an interval of one minute during
       half an hour with active processes sorted on memory consumption:

         <b>atop</b> <b>-M</b> <b>60</b> <b>30</b> <b>&gt;</b> <b>/log/atop.mem</b>

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>/run/pacct_shadow.d/</b>
            Directory containing the process accounting shadow files that are used by <u>atop</u>  when  the  <u>atopacctd</u>
            daemon is active.

       <b>/var/cache/atop.d/atop.acct</b>
            File  in  which  the kernel writes the accounting records when <u>atop</u> itself has activated the process
            accounting mechanism.

       <b>/etc/atoprc</b>
            Configuration file containing system-wide default values.  For further information about the default
            values, refer to the <b>atoprc</b> man page).

       <b><a href="file:~/.atoprc">~/.atoprc</a></b>
            Configuration file containing personal default values.  For further information  about  the  default
            values, refer to the <b>atoprc</b> man page).

       <b>/etc/default/atop</b>
            Configuration  file to overrule the settings of <u>atop</u> that runs in the background to create the daily
            logfile.  This file is created when <u>atop</u> is installed.  The default settings are:

       LOGOPTS=""
               LOGINTERVAL=600
               LOGGENERATIONS=28

       <b>/var/log/atop/atop_</b><u>YYYYMMDD</u>
            Raw file, where <u>YYYYMMDD</u> are digits representing the current  date.   This  name  is  used  by  <b>atop</b>
            running  in  the background as default name for the output file, and by <b>atop</b> as default name for the
            input file when using the <b>-r</b> flag.
            All binary system and process level data in this file has been stored in compressed format.

       <b>/run/netatop.log</b>
            File that contains the netpertask structs containing the network counters of exited processes. These
            structs are written by the <u>netatopd</u> daemon (which is related to the <u>netatop</u> module) and read by <u>atop</u>
            after reading the standard process accounting records.
