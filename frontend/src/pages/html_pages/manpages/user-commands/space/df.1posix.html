</pre><h4><b>PROLOG</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       df — report free disk space

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       df <b>[</b>-k<b>]</b> <b>[</b>-P|-t<b>]</b> <b>[</b><u>file</u>...<b>]</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>df</u>  utility  shall  write the amount of available space and file slots for file systems on which the
       invoking user has appropriate read access. File systems shall be specified by  the  <u>file</u>  operands;  when
       none  are  specified, information shall be written for all file systems. The format of the default output
       from <u>df</u> is unspecified, but all space figures are reported in 512-byte units, unless  the  <b>-k</b>  option  is
       specified. This output shall contain at least the file system names, amount of available space on each of
       these  file  systems,  and,  if no options other than <b>-t</b> are specified, the number of free file slots, or
       <u>inode</u>s, available; when <b>-t</b> is specified, the output shall contain the total allocated space as well.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>df</u> utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <u>Section</u> <u>12.2</u>, <u>Utility</u> <u>Syntax</u>
       <u>Guidelines</u>.

       The following options shall be supported:

       <b>-k</b>        Use 1024-byte units, instead of the default 512-byte units, when writing space figures.

       <b>-P</b>        Produce output in the format described in the STDOUT section.

       <b>-t</b>        Include total allocated-space figures in the output.

</pre><h4><b>OPERANDS</b></h4><pre>
       The following operand shall be supported:

       <u>file</u>      A pathname of a file within the hierarchy of the desired file system.  If a file other  than  a
                 FIFO,  a  regular  file,  a directory, or a special file representing the device containing the
                 file system (for example, <b>/dev/dsk/0s1</b>) is specified, the results are unspecified. If the  <u>file</u>
                 operand  names  a  file  other than a special file containing a file system, <u>df</u> shall write the
                 amount of free space in the file system containing the specified <u>file</u> operand.   Otherwise,  <u>df</u>
                 shall write the amount of free space in that file system.

</pre><h4><b>STDIN</b></h4><pre>
       Not used.

</pre><h4><b>INPUT</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of <u>df</u>:

       <u>LANG</u>      Provide a default value for the internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See the
                 Base  Definitions  volume  of POSIX.1‐2017, <u>Section</u> <u>8.2</u>, <u>Internationalization</u> <u>Variables</u> for the
                 precedence  of  internationalization  variables  used  to  determine  the  values   of   locale
                 categories.)

       <u>LC_ALL</u>    If  set  to a non-empty string value, override the values of all the other internationalization
                 variables.

       <u>LC_CTYPE</u>  Determine the locale for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of text  data  as  characters
                 (for example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments).

       <u>LC_MESSAGES</u>
                 Determine  the  locale  that  should  be  used  to affect the format and contents of diagnostic
                 messages written to standard error and informative messages written to standard output.

       <u>NLSPATH</u>   Determine the location of message catalogs for the processing of <u>LC_MESSAGES</u>.

</pre><h4><b>ASYNCHRONOUS</b> <b>EVENTS</b></h4><pre>
       Default.

</pre><h4><b>STDOUT</b></h4><pre>
       When both the <b>-k</b> and <b>-P</b> options are specified, the following header line shall be written (in  the  POSIX
       locale):

           "Filesystem 1024-blocks Used Available Capacity Mounted on\n"

       When the <b>-P</b> option is specified without the <b>-k</b> option, the following header line shall be written (in the
       POSIX locale):

           "Filesystem 512-blocks Used Available Capacity Mounted on\n"

       The  implementation  may  adjust the spacing of the header line and the individual data lines so that the
       information is presented in orderly columns.

       The remaining output with <b>-P</b> shall consist of one line of information for  each  specified  file  system.
       These lines shall be formatted as follows:

           "%s %d %d %d %d%% %s\n", &lt;<u>file</u> <u>system</u> <u>name</u>&gt;, &lt;<u>total</u> <u>space</u>&gt;,
               &lt;<u>space</u> <u>used</u>&gt;, &lt;<u>space</u> <u>free</u>&gt;, &lt;<u>percentage</u> <u>used</u>&gt;,
               &lt;<u>file</u> <u>system</u> <u>root</u>&gt;

       In  the following list, all quantities expressed in 512-byte units (1024-byte when <b>-k</b> is specified) shall
       be rounded up to the next higher unit. The fields are:

       &lt;<u>file</u> <u>system</u> <u>name</u>&gt;
                 The name of the file system, in an implementation-defined format.

       &lt;<u>total</u> <u>space</u>&gt;
                 The total size of the file system in 512-byte units.  The  exact  meaning  of  this  figure  is
                 implementation-defined,  but should include &lt;<u>space</u> <u>used</u>&gt;, &lt;<u>space</u> <u>free</u>&gt;, plus any space reserved
                 by the system not normally available to a user.

       &lt;<u>space</u> <u>used</u>&gt;
                 The total amount of space allocated to existing files in the file system, in 512-byte units.

       &lt;<u>space</u> <u>free</u>&gt;
                 The total amount of space available within the file system for the creation  of  new  files  by
                 unprivileged users, in 512-byte units. When this figure is less than or equal to zero, it shall
                 not  be  possible  to  create  any  new files on the file system without first deleting others,
                 unless the process has appropriate privileges. The figure written may be less than zero.

       &lt;<u>percentage</u> <u>used</u>&gt;
                 The percentage of the normally available space that is currently allocated to all files on  the
                 file system. This shall be calculated using the fraction:

                     &lt;<u>space</u> <u>used</u>&gt;/( &lt;<u>space</u> <u>used</u>&gt;+ &lt;<u>space</u> <u>free</u>&gt;)

                 expressed as a percentage. This percentage may be greater than 100 if &lt;<u>space</u> <u>free</u>&gt; is less than
                 zero. The percentage value shall be expressed as a positive integer, with any fractional result
                 causing it to be rounded to the next highest integer.

       &lt;<u>file</u> <u>system</u> <u>root</u>&gt;
                 The directory below which the file system hierarchy appears.

       The output format is unspecified when <b>-t</b> is used.

</pre><h4><b>STDERR</b></h4><pre>
       The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.

</pre><h4><b>OUTPUT</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>EXTENDED</b> <b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       The following exit values shall be returned:

        0    Successful completion.

       &gt;0    An error occurred.

</pre><h4><b>CONSEQUENCES</b> <b>OF</b> <b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       Default.

       <u>The</u> <u>following</u> <u>sections</u> <u>are</u> <u>informative.</u>

</pre><h4><b>APPLICATION</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       On most systems, the ``name of the file system, in an implementation-defined format'' is the special file
       on which the file system is mounted.

       On large file systems, the calculation specified for percentage used can create huge rounding errors.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
        1. The following example writes portable information about the <b><a href="file:/usr">/usr</a></b> file system:

               df -P <a href="file:/usr">/usr</a>

        2. Assuming that <b><a href="file:/usr/src">/usr/src</a></b> is part of the <b><a href="file:/usr">/usr</a></b> file system, the following produces the same output as the
           previous example:

               df -P <a href="file:/usr/src">/usr/src</a>

</pre><h4><b>RATIONALE</b></h4><pre>
       The  behavior  of <u>df</u> with the <b>-P</b> option is the default action of the 4.2 BSD <u>df</u> utility. The uppercase <b>-P</b>
       was selected to avoid collision with a known industry extension using <b>-p</b>.

       Historical <u>df</u> implementations vary considerably in their default output. It was  therefore  necessary  to
       describe  the default output in a loose manner to accommodate all known historical implementations and to
       add a portable option (<b>-P</b>) to provide information in a portable format.

       The use of 512-byte units is historical practice and maintains compatibility with <u>ls</u> and other  utilities
       in  this  volume  of POSIX.1‐2017. This does not mandate that the file system itself be based on 512-byte
       blocks. The <b>-k</b> option was added as a compromise measure. It was agreed by the  standard  developers  that
       512  bytes  was  the best default unit because of its complete historical consistency on System V (<u>versus</u>
       the mixed 512/1024-byte usage on BSD systems), and that a <b>-k</b> option to switch to 1024-byte  units  was  a
       good  compromise.  Users  who  prefer  the  more  logical 1024-byte quantity can easily alias <u>df</u> to <u>df</u> <b>-k</b>
       without breaking many historical scripts relying on the 512-byte units.

       It was suggested that <u>df</u> and the various related utilities be modified to access a <u>BLOCKSIZE</u>  environment
       variable to achieve consistency and user acceptance. Since this is not historical practice on any system,
       it is left as a possible area for system extensions and will be re-evaluated in a future version if it is
       widely implemented.
