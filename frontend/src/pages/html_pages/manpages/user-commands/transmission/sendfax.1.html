       sendfax - submit a facsimile job for transmission

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>sendfax</b> [ <u>options</u> ] [ <u>files</u>...  ]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>sendfax</u>  submits one or more facsimile transmission requests to a <u>HylaFAX</u> facsimile server.  Requests are
       normally processed immediately, although they may also be queued for transmission at a later time using a
       syntax identical to the <u><a href="../man1/at.1.html">at</a></u>(1) command.  For each job that is queued, <u>sendfax</u> prints a <u>job</u> <u>identifier</u>  and
       a  <u>job</u>  <u>group</u>  <u>identifier</u>  on  the  standard  output.   A  job  identifier is the token by which jobs are
       identified within <u>HylaFAX</u>; job group identifiers are used to reference a  set  of  jobs  that  have  been
       submitted  at  the  same  time.  Job and job group identifiers can be supplied to the <u><a href="../man1/faxrm.1.html">faxrm</a></u>(1) command to
       remove the jobs or to the <u><a href="../man1/faxalter.1.html">faxalter</a></u>(1) command to alter job parameters.

       Facsimile are made from the concatenation of a cover page (see below) and one or more files specified  on
       the command line.  If no files are supplied on the command line, <u>sendfax</u> will read data from the standard
       input  unless  polling  is  requested.   Cover  pages  are  distinguished  for  the purpose of generating
       ``<u>continuation</u> <u>cover</u> <u>pages</u>'' on the server; these are makeup cover pages that are automatically generated
       if a job fails after sending the original user-specified cover page.

       <u>sendfax</u> passes POSTSCRIPT® and TIFF documents directly through to the fax server  for  transmission,  and
       attempts  to  convert  other  file  formats  to  either  POSTSCRIPT or TIFF.  In normal operation <u>sendfax</u>
       automatically converts ASCII-text, <u><a href="../man1/troff.1.html">troff</a></u>(1) output, Portable Document Format (PDF), and Silicon  Graphics
       format images for transmission.  Support for other file formats can be easily added through an extensible
       file  typing  and  conversion  facility;  see  <u><a href="../man5/typerules.5.html">typerules</a></u>(5).   Note that since TIFF Class F documents are
       processed directly it is simple to forward a received facsimile.

       By default <u>sendfax</u> will generate a cover page for each facsimile that is to be transmitted.   This  cover
       page  is  created  by  the  ancillary  <u><a href="../man1/faxcover.1.html">faxcover</a></u>(1)  program  using  information deduced by <u>sendfax</u> and by
       information supplied on the command line.  Automatic cover page generation may be suppressed with the  <b>-n</b>
       option.

       In  addition  to  sending  documents,  <u>sendfax</u> can be used to poll a remote facsimile machine to retrieve
       waiting documents.  If the <b>-p</b>  option  is  specified,  a  polling  request  will  be  submitted  to  each
       destination.   If  a  poll  request  is  made in conjunction with the transmission of documents, the poll
       request will take place after the documents are transmitted.  Documents retrieved by polling are returned
       to the requestor by electronic mail and may be viewed with a suitable viewer program.

       One or more destinations must be specified on the command line using the <b>-d</b> option.  A destination is the
       dialing string to use to contact the remote fax machine.   Phone  numbers  may  include  non-alphanumeric
       characters  for  readability—only  alphanumerics,  ``+''  (for  denoting  a country code), and ``#'' (for
       denoting a subaddress) are significant in placing a call.  Alphabetic characters are automatically mapped
       to their numeric key equivalents: ``abcABC'' to ``2'', ``defDEF'' to ``3'', etc.  Dialing prefixes,  such
       as  ``1''  and  ``011''  (for  long  distance  calling  in  the United States) need not be included if an
       unambiguous number is specified.  Examples of unambiguous phone numbers are:
              +31.77.594.131      <u>to</u> <u>call</u> <u>the</u> <u>Netherlands</u>
              +14159657824        <u>to</u> <u>call</u> <u>California</u>
              9657824             <u>to</u> <u>make</u> <u>a</u> <u>local</u> <u>call</u>
              1-215-356-1666      <u>to</u> <u>call</u> <u>Pennsylvania</u> <u>from</u> <u>within</u> <u>the</u> <u>US</u>
       Non-numeric strings, such as ``*70'' (to defeat call waiting), may be included in the  destination  phone
       number.   Whether  or  not  they are stripped from the string used to dial the destination fax machine is
       dependent on the dialstring  rules  configured  for  use  on  the  server;  c.f.   <u><a href="../man5/hylafax-config.5.html">hylafax-config</a></u>(5)  and
       <u><a href="../man5/dialrules.5.html">dialrules</a></u>(5).

       A  destination  may also be specified as <u>user@fax-number</u>.  In this case the <u>user</u> string will be passed to
       <u>faxcover</u> as the identity of the recipient.  Note that multi-word names must be enclosed in  quote  marks;
       for example, ``Sam Leffler@+1.415.555.1212''.

       The  order  of  options  on  the command line is significant.  Each fax to be transmitted is assigned the
       current value of parameters specified on the command line; e.g. whether or not to generate a cover  page.
       This  means that options that specify parameters for a particular destination must precede the dialstring
       specified with the <b>-d</b> option.  For example,

              sendfax -n -d 5551212 <a href="file:/etc/passwd">/etc/passwd</a>

       submits a fax to 5551212 that has no cover page while

              sendfax -d 5551212 -n <a href="file:/etc/passwd">/etc/passwd</a>

       submits the same fax but with the default cover page handling.  Note also that parameter  values  persist
       across <b>-d</b> options so the following

              sendfax -n -d 5551212 -d 5551313 <a href="file:/etc/network">/etc/network</a>

       submits two facsimile, both of which have no cover page.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-1</b>          Transmit  facsimile  documents  using  1-D  MH  compression.  By default <u>HylaFAX</u> will use the
                   optimal compression scheme supported  by  the  transmitting  modem  and  receiving  facsimile
                   device.

       <b>-2</b>          Transmit  facsimile documents using 2-D MR compression, if possible.  By default <u>HylaFAX</u> will
                   use the optimal  compression  scheme  supported  by  the  transmitting  modem  and  receiving
                   facsimile device.

       <b>-3</b>          Transmit facsimile documents using 2-D MMR compression, if possible.  By default <u>HylaFAX</u> will
                   use  the  optimal  compression  scheme  supported  by  the  transmitting  modem and receiving
                   facsimile device.

       <b>-a</b> <u>time</u>     Schedule transmission up to one year in advance at the indicated <u>time</u>.  <u>Time</u> is specified  in
                   the  format:  ``HH:MM [AM|PM] | now [+ N <u>period</u> | <u>month</u> DD | <u>dayofweek</u> ]´´ where <u>month</u> can be
                   Jan(uary),  Feb(ruary),  Mar(ch),  Apr(il),  May,  Jun(e),  Jul(y),  Aug(ust),   Sep(tember),
                   Oct(ober),  Nov(ember),  or Dec(ember); <u>period</u> can be minute(s), hour(s), day(s), week(s), or
                   month(s);  <u>dayofweek</u>  can  be  Mon(day),  Tue(sday),   Wed(nesday),   Thu(rsday),   Fri(day),
                   Sat(urday),  Sun(day);  e.g.  ``now + 30 minutes´´ to schedule transmission 30 minutes in the
                   future.  Trailing information in the <u>time</u> field (such  as  YYYY)  is  ignored.   By  default,
                   <u>sendfax</u> schedules facsimile for immediate delivery.  Time should be given in the user's local
                   time.

       <b>-A</b>          Archive the job on the server according to the bin/archive script when the job is done.

       <b>-b</b> <u>speed</u>    Transmit facsimile documents using a signalling rate that is constrained to be at least <u>speed</u>
                   bits/second.   If  the  specified speed is greater than the transmitting modem or receiver is
                   capable of, it is reduced  to  the  highest  possible  speed  both  devices  support.   If  a
                   negotiated  signalling  rate greater than or equal to <u>speed</u> cannot be negotiated then the job
                   is aborted.  Possible speeds are: 2400, 4800, 7200, 9600, 12000, 14400, 16800, 19200,  21600,
                   24000, 26400, 28800, 31200, and 33600.  By default <u>HylaFAX</u> will use the fastest possible rate
                   supported by the transmitting modem and receiving facsimile device.

       <b>-B</b> <u>speed</u>    Try  to transmit facsimile documents using the desired signalling rate.  Possible speeds are:
                   2400, 4800, 7200, 9600, 12000, 14400, 16800, 19200, 21600, 24000, 26400,  28800,  31200,  and
                   33600.   If the specified speed is greater than the transmitting modem or receiver is capable
                   of, it is reduced to the highest possible speed both devices  support.   By  default  <u>HylaFAX</u>
                   will  use  the  fastest  possible  rate  supported  by  the  transmitting modem and receiving
                   facsimile device (unless restricted by other server configuration); this option can  be  used
                   to  reduce  the  speed.   Note  that  international  calls  are frequently more reliable when
                   transmissions are restricted to 9600 bits/second.  For Class 1/1.0 devices, if the  specified
                   speed  is  not greater than 14400 then V.34 will not be attempted, and if the specified speed
                   is 9600 or 7200 then V.29 will be assumed in lieu of V.17.

       <b>-c</b> <u>comments</u> Pass <u>comments</u> to the <u><a href="../man1/faxcover.1.html">faxcover</a></u>(1) program for inclusion in the comments field of any generated
                   cover page.

       <b>-C</b> <u>file</u>     Pass <u>file</u> to the <u><a href="../man1/faxcover.1.html">faxcover</a></u>(1) program for use as the cover page template.

       <b>-D</b>          Enable notification by electronic mail when the facsimile has  been  delivered.   By  default
                   <u>HylaFAX</u> will notify the submitter only if there is a problem with a job.

       <b>-d</b> <u>destination</u>
                   Create  a  job  to  transmit  the  supplied documents to a facsimile machine at the indicated
                   <u>destination</u>.  If the <u>destination</u> is of the  form  ``<u>user</u>@<u>phone-number</u>#<u>subaddress</u>''  then  any
                   cover  page  will show <u>user</u> as the intended recipient, and the remote system will be supplied
                   the subaddress value (i.e. for routing) provided that the sending  modem  and  the  receiving
                   system support it.

       <b>-E</b>          Disable  use  of  the Error Correction Mode (ECM) when transmitting page data. Setting ECM to
                   false will limit the maximum speed to 14400 bps.  By default <u>HylaFAX</u> will attempt to use  ECM
                   when  both  the  transmitting modem and receiving device support it.  Note that international
                   calls are sometimes faster when ECM  is  disabled.   Beware  also  that  some  modems  and/or
                   facsimile devices do not properly implement ECM causing transmission failures.

       <b>-f</b> <u>from</u>     Use  <u>from</u>  as  the  identity  of the facsimile sender.  Otherwise the sender is the user that
                   invoked <u>sendfax</u>.  The sender is an account name to which the <u>HylaFAX</u> software  should  direct
                   notification messages.  The <u>from</u> identity may be a fullblown ``From:'' line, e.g.  e.g. ``Joe
                   Blow  &lt;<a href="mailto:joe@foo.com">joe@foo.com</a>&gt;''  and  ``<a href="mailto:joe@foo.com">joe@foo.com</a>  (Joe  Blow)''  are acceptable.  If no host-part is
                   specified in the <u>from</u> string the local hostname is used.  This option is useful when  <u>sendfax</u>
                   is  invoked on behalf of another user, such as in the implementation of an electronic mail to
                   fax gateway.

       <b>-F</b> <u>format</u>   Use the specified <u>format</u> when imaging tag lines on outgoing pages.  Consult  the  description
                   of  the <b>TagLineFormat</b> parameter in <u><a href="../man5/hylafax-config.5.html">hylafax-config</a></u>(5) for an explanation of how to construct a
                   format string.

                   <u>Note</u> <u>that</u>  <u>many</u>  <u>locales</u>  <u>require</u>  <u>that</u>  <u>proper</u>  <u>identification</u>  <u>appear</u>  <u>on</u>  <u>all</u>  <u>transmitted</u>
                   <u>facsimile;</u>  <u>when</u>  <u>using</u> <u>this</u> <u>facility</u> <u>one</u> <u>should</u> <u>always</u> <u>include</u> <u>proper</u> <u>identification</u> <u>(e.g.</u> <u>a</u>
                   <u>phone</u> <u>number)</u> <u>in</u> <u>the</u> <u>imaged</u> <u>taglines.</u>

       <b>-G</b>          Enable usage of any extended resolutions supported by the receiver.  <b>-G</b> supersedes the  usage
                   of any <b>-l</b> or <b>-m</b> options.  Beware that increased resolution will increase transmission time.

       <b>-h</b> [<u>modem</u>@]<u>host</u>[<u>:port</u>]
                   Force  the jobs to be processed on a specific <u>host</u> and, optionally, using a particular <u>modem</u>.
                   The <u>host</u> may be either a symbolic name or a network address.  If no <b>-h</b>  option  is  supplied,
                   <u>sendfax</u>  uses  the FAXSERVER environment variable to identify the <u>HylaFAX</u> server to which the
                   jobs should be directed.  If no server is specified then <u>sendfax</u> attempts to contact a server
                   on the local host.  If no modem is specified, the job will  be  submitted  to  any  available
                   modem.

       <b>-i</b> <u>identifier</u>
                   Use  the  <u>identifier</u>  string in any notification messages instead of the usual job identifier
                   number.  This option is useful for applications that cross  reference  notification  messages
                   against job submissions.

       <b>-I</b> <u>time</u>     If  a job must be requeued because of a communication failure schedule the retry according to
                   the specified <u>time</u>.  Times are given in seconds.  Minutes, hours, and days can  be  specified
                   with  ``<u>min</u>'',  ``<u>hour</u>'', and ``<u>day</u>'' suffixes, respectively.  By default <u>HylaFAX</u> reschedules
                   jobs using retry times that depend on the manner in which  the  job  failed;  this  interface
                   permits  a  user  to  override  this  algorithm and specify a single fixed retry time for all
                   communication failures.

       <b>-k</b> <u>time</u>     Kill the job if it does not complete in the indicated <u>time</u>.   The  <u>time</u>  is  specified  using
                   notation  identical  to  the  <b>-a</b>  option.   Note that the <u>time</u> is relative to the time of the
                   initial time-to-send.  The default kill time is ``now + 3 hours'' (three hours from the  time
                   the job is first processed).  To retry for an hour, ``now +1 hour'' could be used.

       <b>-l</b>          Transmit  the  facsimile  at  a  vertical resolution of 98 lines/inch; otherwise known as <u>low</u>
                   <u>resolution</u>.

       <b>-m</b>          Transmit the facsimile at a vertical resolution of 196 lines/inch; otherwise known as  <u>medium</u>
                   <u>resolution</u> or <u>fine</u> <u>mode</u>.

       <b>-M</b> <u>mst</u>      Transmit  facsimile documents using the specified minimum scanline time.  Possible times are:
                   0ms, 5ms, 10ms2, 10ms, 20ms2, 20ms, 40ms2, and 40ms.  If the specified time is less than  the
                   transmitting  modem  or  receiver  is capable of, it is increased to the lowest possible time
                   both devices support.  By default <u>HylaFAX</u> will use the lowest possible time supported by  the
                   transmitting  modem  and  receiving  facsimile  device  (unless  restricted  by  other server
                   configuration).  This option is mostly useful for debugging.

       <b>-n</b>          Suppress the automatic generation of a  cover  page  for  subsequent  facsimile.   Note  that
                   polling  requests  do not receive a cover page unless they are combined with the transmission
                   of one or more files.

       <b>-N</b>          Do not notify the sender by  electronic  mail  when  the  facsimile  has  been  delivered  or
                   requeued.

       <b>-o</b> <u>owner</u>    Specify  the fax owner login name, replacing any <b>FAXUSER</b> environment variable that may be set
                   for the same purpose.  If neither is specified, the user's current login name is used.

       <b>-p</b>          Poll each destination for any available documents.  If a poll request is made  together  with
                   document  transmission,  the  poll  operation  is  done  after the documents are transmitted.
                   Documents received by polling are returned to the sender by electronic mail.

       <b>-P</b> <u>priority</u> Assign the specified scheduling <u>priority</u> to subsequent jobs.  A priority is an integer  value
                   in  the  range [0-255].  Lower values result in higher priority processing.  By default, each
                   job is assigned 127 for an initial scheduling priority.  If a job's priority is greater  than
                   bulk faxes then the job's priority is raised (numerically lowered) for each failed attempt to
                   transmit  so that retransmit attempts are done ahead of newly submitted jobs.  In the case of
                   bulk faxes (numerically higher than 190), then the job's  priority  is  lowered  (numerically
                   raised) for each failed attempt to transmit so that the whole of the bulk-queued jobs will be
                   attempted before any are retried.  The <u>priority</u> may also be specified as one of the following
                   symbolic names: <u>default</u> or <u>normal</u> (127), <u>bulk</u> or <u>junk</u> (191), <u>low</u> (190), or <u>high</u> (63).

       <b>-R</b>          Enable  notification  by electronic mail when the facsimile has been delivered and when it is
                   requeued for retransmission.  By default <u>HylaFAX</u> will notify the submitter only if there is a
                   problem with a job.

       <b>-r</b> <u>regarding</u>
                   Pass <u>regarding</u> to the <u><a href="../man1/faxcover.1.html">faxcover</a></u>(1) program as the value of the ``Re:'' field of any  generated
                   cover page.

       <b>-s</b> <u>size</u>     Set the page size to use for the transmitted facsimile.  Facsimile are normally imaged with a
                   system-default  page  size  (usually  letter-size  pages,  8.5"  by  11",  for sites in North
                   America).  Alternate  page  sizes  are  specified  symbolically  using  either  the  name  or
                   abbreviation  of  an  entry  in the <u><a href="../man5/pagesizes.5.html">pagesizes</a></u>(5) database; e.g.  <u>a3</u> (ISO A3), <u>a4</u> (ISO A4), <u>a5</u>
                   (ISO A5), <u>a6</u> (ISO A6), <u>b4</u> (ISO B4), <u>na-let</u> (North American Letter), <u>us-leg</u> (American  Legal),
                   <u>us-led</u>  (American  Ledger), <u>us-exe</u> (American Executive), <u>jp-let</u> (Japanese Letter), and <u>jp-leg</u>
                   (Japanese Legal).  Comparisons are case-insensitive and any match of a substring of the  full
                   page-size name is sufficient; e.g. ``legal'' would match ``American Legal''.

                   Note  that  it  may  not  be  permissible  to  image  into the full page area; the guaranteed
                   reproducible area for a page is typically inset.  Also, note that while arbitrary page  sizes
                   can  be  specified  through the page size database, only a limited set of page dimensions are
                   supported by the Group 3 facsimile protocol.  Thus if an odd-size facsimile is submitted  for
                   transmission  it  may  not  be  possible  to determine if it can be sent until the fax server
                   establishes communication with the remote facsimile machine.

       <b>-S</b> <u>tsi</u>      Pass tsi to the server as the suggested sender identification to be  used,  for  example,  in
                   tagline imaging and fax protocol.

       <b>-t</b> <u>tries</u>    Make no more than <u>tries</u> attempts to send the facsimile.  By default, <u>HylaFAX</u> will terminate a
                   job  if  3 consecutive attempts to send a particular page fail, or it appears the receiver is
                   not a facsimile machine.  Otherwise <u>HylaFAX</u> places no limit on the <u>number</u> of attempts to send
                   a facsimile, instead terminating a job if it is not completed  within  a  <u>kill</u>  <u>time</u>  timeout
                   interval.   Note  that  a  try  is  a  call in which carrier is established and the facsimile
                   protocol is commenced; this is contrasted with a call attempt that might have failed  because
                   the  line  was  busy.   Use ``-1'' to indicate that no <u>tries</u> value should be specified to the
                   server.

       <b>-T</b> <u>maxdials</u> Make no more than <u>maxdials</u> calls in attempting to send the facsimile.   By  default,  HylaFAX
                   will  redial  12  times  before killing a job.  Use ``-1'' to indicate that no <u>maxdials</u> value
                   should be specified to the server.

       <b>-U</b> <u>voice-no</u> Pass <u>voice-no</u> to the <u><a href="../man1/faxcover.1.html">faxcover</a></u>(1) program as the sender's voice number.

       <b>-V</b> <u>voice-no</u> Pass <u>voice-no</u> to the <u><a href="../man1/faxcover.1.html">faxcover</a></u>(1) program as the destination person's voice number.

       <b>-w</b>          Wait for the job to complete before ending the sendfax session.  If this option is used,  the
                   sendfax process will not terminate until the job is completed.

       <b>-W</b> <u>fax-no</u>   Pass <u>fax-no</u> to the <u><a href="../man1/faxcover.1.html">faxcover</a></u>(1) program as the sender's fax number.

       <b>-x</b> <u>company</u>  Pass <u>company</u> to the <u><a href="../man1/faxcover.1.html">faxcover</a></u>(1) program as the destination company name.

       <b>-X</b> <u>company</u>  Pass <u>company</u> to the <u><a href="../man1/faxcover.1.html">faxcover</a></u>(1) program as the sender's company name.

       <b>-y</b> <u>location</u> Pass <u>location</u> to the <u><a href="../man1/faxcover.1.html">faxcover</a></u>(1) program as the destination company's location.

       <b>-Y</b> <u>location</u> Pass <u>location</u> to the <u><a href="../man1/faxcover.1.html">faxcover</a></u>(1) program as the sender's company location.

       <b>-z</b> <u>filename</u> Read  destinations  from  <u>filename</u>  which  contains  a  list  of  the  destinations formatted
                   identically as destinations for the <b>-d</b> option, one per line.  Usage of this option is similar
                   to the <b>-d</b> option and may be done in conjunction with other <b>-d</b> and <b>-z</b> options.

       <b>-v</b>          Print information on the standard output about each conversion  and  cover  sheet  generation
                   operation  it  does.   If  <b>-v</b>  is specified twice, the protocol between <u>sendfax</u> and the <u>hfaxd</u>
                   server process that does the submission work on the remote machine is also displayed.

       <b>-Z</b> <u>range</u>    Specify that only certain pages of the fax should actually be transmitted.  The range is in a
                   comma-seperated list of ranges in the form of A[-B][,....].  The range is  specified  against
                   the  resulting document to be faxed, excluding any cover pages.  So if you have more than one
                   document, make sure  to  account  for  them,  and  exclude  the  cover  pages  in  the  range
                   specification.   Cover  pages  will  always  be faxed, so a fax with a coverpage and 2 5 page
                   documents with a range specified of of 1,3,10 will fax the cover page, and pages 1, 3, and 10
                   of the combined documents (page 1 and 3 from the first document, and page  5  of  the  second
                   document).

                       last  page  chopped;  respectively.   Page  chopping  is  controlled by the <b>ChopThreshold</b>
                       parameter.

       <b>PageLength</b>      Set the transmitted page length in millimeters.

       <b>PageSize</b>        Set the page dimensions according to an entry in the <u><a href="../man5/pagesizes.5.html">pagesizes</a></u>(5) database.   (Equivalent

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       The following messages are generated because of problems encountered on the local machine.

       <b>Could</b> <b>not</b> <b>call</b> <b>server.</b>  The facsimile server on the remote machine did not respond.

       <b>No</b>  <b>input</b>  <b>data;</b>  <b>transmission</b>  <b>aborted.</b>   No  data  was  supplied (typically on the standard input).  No
       facsimile will be sent.

       <b>Error</b> <b>converting</b> <b>data;</b> <b>command</b> <b>was</b>  <b>%s."</b>  A data conversion operation failed; the shell command that  was
       used is printed.

       <b>Can</b>  <b>not</b>  <b>convert</b> <b>%s.</b>  Data needed to be converted for transmission, but the required conversion rule was
       not located.  This may indicate that the <u>HylaFAX</u> software was incorrectly installed; or perhaps  that  an
       NFS-mounted directory is temporarily unavailable.

       <b>%s:</b> <b>Can</b> <b>not</b> <b>determine</b> <b>file</b> <b>type.</b>  <u>sendfax</u> was unable to deduce the type of the file.

       <b>%s:</b> <b>Not</b> <b>a</b> <b>regular</b> <b>file.</b>  The file is something other than a regular file; for example, a directory.

       The  following  messages  may be printed by <u>sendfax</u>.  These messages describe problems encountered by the
       server process on the remote machine.  This list is incomplete; other messages may be  generated  by  the
       server under unusual circumstances.
