</pre><h4><b>WARNING</b></h4><pre>
       This man page is not a complete set of documentation - the complexity of the atlc project makes man pages
       not an ideal way to document it, although  out  of  completeness,  man  pages  are  produced.   The  best
       documentation that was current at the time the version was produced may be found in
       /usr/share/doc/atlc/html-docs/index.html
       Sometimes,  errors are corrected in the documentation and placed at <a href="http://atlc.sourceforge.net/">http://atlc.sourceforge.net/</a> before a
       new release of atlc is released.  Please, if you notice a problem with the documentation - even  spelling
       errors and typos, please let me know.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>atlc</b>  is  a  finite  difference  program  that  is  used  to  calculate the properties of a two-conductor
       electrical transmission line of arbitrary cross section. It is used  whenever  there  are  no  analytical
       formula known, yet you still require an answer. It can calculate:
          The impedance Zo  (in Ohms)
          The capacitance per unit length (pF/m)
          The inductance per unit length (nF/m)
          The velocity of propagation v (m/s)
          The velocity factor, v/c, which is dimensionless.

       A  bitmap  file  (usually  with  the  extension .bmp or .BMP) is drawn in a graphics package such as <b>Gimp</b>
       available from <a href="http://www.gimp.org">http://www.gimp.org</a>. The bitmap file  <b>must</b>  be  saved  as  a  24-bit  (16,777,216  colour)
       uncompqessed  file.  The colours used in the bitmap indicate whether the region is a conductor (pure red,
       pure green or pure blue) or a  dielectric  (anything  else).  Pure  white  is  assumed  to  be  a  vacuum
       dielectric,  but other colours have different meanings.  See COLOURS below for precise definitions of the
       colours.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-C</b>
       print copyright, licensing and copying information.
       <b>-s</b>
       Skip writing the Ex, Ey, E, V, U and Er bitmap (.bmp) files <b>-S</b>
       Skip writing the Ex, Ey, E, V, U and Er binary (.bin) files
       <b>-v</b>
       makes the output more verbose/talkative.
       <b>-c</b> <b>cutoff</b>
       Sets the convergence criteria of the finite difference  program.  The  default  is  0.0001,  meaning  two
       separate  iterations  must be within 01% for the program to stop iterating. Setting to a smaller positive
       number gives more accuracy, but takes longer.

       <b>-d</b> <b>rrggbb=Er</b>
       is used to indicate the colour 0xrrggbb in the bitmap is used to represent a material  with  permittivity
       Er. See also COLOURS below

       <b>-i</b> <b>factor</b>
       is  used  to lighten or darken the .bmp electric field profile images produced by atlc. Set factor &gt; 2 to
       lighten or between 1 and 2 to darken.

       <b>-r</b> <b>ratemultiplier</b>
       Sets the parameter 'r' used internally when computing the voltage at a point w,h.  The default, which  is
       (as  of version 3.0.0) 1.95, results in what is believed to be optimal results. Setting to 1.0 will avoid
       the use of the fast convergence method, which is generally not a good idea.

       <b>-p</b> <b>prefix</b>
       Adds 'prefix', which is usually a directory name, in front of the output files.

</pre><h4><b>COLOURS</b></h4><pre>
       The 24-bitmaps that atlc uses have 8 bits assigned to represent the amount of red, 8 for blue and  8  for
       green. Hence there are 256 levels of red, green and blue, making a total of 256*256*256=16777216 colours.
       Every  one  of  the possible 16777216 colours can be defined precisely by the stating the exact amount of
       red, green and blue, as in:

       red         = 255,000,000 or 0xff0000
       green       = 000,255,000 or 0x00ff00
       blue        = 000,000,255 or 0x0000ff
       black       = 000,000,000 or 0x000000
       white       = 255,255,255 or 0xffffff
       Brown       = 255,000,255 or 0xff00ff
       gray        = 142,142,142 or 0x8e8e8e

       Some colours, such as pink, turquiose, sandy, brown, gray etc  may  mean  slightly  different  things  to
       different  people.  This  is  not  so  with  atlc, as the program expects the colours below to be exactly
       defined as given. Whether you feel the colour is sandy or yellow is up to you, but if you use it in  your
       bitmap,  then it either needs to be a colour reconised by atlc, <b>or</b> you <b>must</b> define it with a command line
       option (see OPTIONS).
       red    = 255,000,000 or 0xFF0000 is the live conductor.
       green  = 000,255,000 or 0x00FF00 is the grounded conductor.
       blue   = 000,000,255 or 0x0000FF is the negative conductor

       All bitmaps <b>must</b> have the live (red) and grounded (green)  conductor.  The  blue  conductor  is  used  to
       indicate a negative conductor, is needed when the program is used to analyse directional couplers.

       The following dielectrics are reconised by atlc<b>:</b>

       white     255,255,255 or 0xFFFFFF as Er=1.0    (vacuum)
       pink      255,202,202 or 0xFFCACA as Er=1.0006 (air)
       L. blue   130,052,255 or 0x8235EF as Er=2.1    (PTFE)
       Mid gray  142,242,142 or 0x8E8E8E as Er=2.2    (duroid 5880)
       mauve     255.000,255 or 0xFF00FF as Er=2.33  (polyethylene)
       yellow    255,255,000 or 0xFFFF00 as Er=2.5    (polystyrene)
       sandy     239,203,027 or 0xEFCC1A as Er=3.3    (PVC)
       brown     188,127,096 or 0xBC7F60 as Er=3.335  (epoxy resin)
       L. yellow 223,247,136 or 0xDFF788 as Er=3.7    (FR4 PCB)
       Turquoise 026,239,179 or 0x1AEFB3 as Er=4.8    (glass PCB)
       Dark gray 142,142,142 or 0x696969 as Er=6.15   (duroid 6006)
       L. gray   240,240,240 or 0xDCDCDC as Er=10.2  (duroid 6010)
       D. orange 213,160,067 or 0xD5A04D as Er=100.0 (mainly for test purposes)

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Here are a few examples of the use of atlc. Again, see the html documentation in atlc-X.Y.Zocsl-docs, the
       documentation  on your system (normally at /usr/local/share/atlc/docs/html-docs/index.html ) or online at
       <a href="http://atlc.sourceforge.net">http://atlc.sourceforge.net</a> for examples.

       <b>ex_1</b> <b>%</b> <b>atlc</b> <b>coax2.bmp</b>
       This is a simple example (ex_1), in which the geometry of a transmission line is defined in coax2.bmp. In
       this example, only the predefined dielectrics (Er =1.0, 1.0006, 2.1, 2.2, 2.33,  2.5,  3.3,  3.335,  3.7,
       4.8,  6.15  or  10.2)  could  have  been  used  in  the bitmap, which would have been done with one of 13
       different colours. white (0xFFFFFF) for  Er=1.0,  pink  (0xFFCACA)  for  1.0006  etc.   No  other  colour
       (dielectric) could have been used, since it was not specified with the -d option.

       <b>ex_2</b> <b>%</b> <b>atlc</b> <b>-d</b> <b>f9e77d=2.43</b> <b>somefile.bmp</b>
       In  ex_2, a dielectric with Er=2.43 was wanted. A colour with the RGB values of 0xF9E7&amp;d was used. The -d
       option tells atlc what Er this colour refers to.

       <b>ex_3</b> <b>%</b> <b>atlc</b> <b>-v</b> <b>coax2.bmp</b>
       In ex_3, atlc has been instructed to print the results of intermediate calculations to stdout.  Normally,
       only the final result is printed. Using -vv even more information may be produced, but this is really  of
       only use to the developer of the project.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       bitmapfile.bmp
          Original bitmap file. Must be 24-bit colour uncompressed.
       bitmapfile.Ex.bmp
          X-component of E-field as a bitmap. Red=+dV/dx, blue =-dV/dx
       bitmapfile.Ey.bmp
          y-component of E-field as a bitmap. Red=+y, blue =-y
       bitmapfile.E.bmp
          E-field, as E=sqrt(Ex^2+Ey^2).
       bitmapfile.V.bin
          Voltage as a bitmap, red= positive, blue =negative.
       bitmapfile.Er.bin
          Bitmap showing the permittivity as a grayscale. Lighter is a higher
          permittivity.
       bitmapfile.U.bmp
          Energy.

       In addition to the bitmaps, the data is also saved in binary files.

       All  the  saved  binary files (.bin's) are saved as a double precision number for each of the pixels. The
       first double is the top left, the last the bottom right. If the original image has width W and height  H,
       the saved binary files will be W-1 by H-1.

       All the saved bitmap files are 24-bit uncompressed, just like the input files.
