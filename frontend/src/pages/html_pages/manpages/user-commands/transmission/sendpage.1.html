</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       sendpage - submit a pager job for transmission

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>sendpage</b> [ <u>options</u> ] [ <u>message</u>...  ]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>sendpage</u> submits a pager transmission request to a server using the Simple Network Paging Protocol (SNPP)
       described  in  RFC  1861.   Pager  requests  specified  with <u>sendpage</u> are normally processed immediately,
       although they may also be queued for transmission at a later time using a syntax identical to  the  <u><a href="../man1/at.1.html">at</a></u>(1)
       command.   For  each  job that is queued, <u>sendpage</u> prints a <u>job</u> <u>identifier</u> on the standard output.  A job
       identifier is the token by which jobs are identified within <u>HylaFAX</u>.  Job identifiers can be supplied  to
       the <u><a href="../man1/faxrm.1.html">faxrm</a></u>(1) command to remove the jobs or to the <u><a href="../man1/faxalter.1.html">faxalter</a></u>(1) command to alter job parameters.

       Pages  may  be  sent  to one or more destination paging terminals and, optionally, include a text message
       (depending on the capability of the receiving  device).   Each  destination  is  identified  by  a  Pager
       Identification  Number (PIN) specified with the <b>-p</b> option; for example, sendpage -p 12345 ``Help, the fax
       machine is on fire!''.  A PIN is typically a numeric string though it may also be an alpha-numeric  alias
       depending on the capabilities of the SNPP server.

       Text  messages  can be specified on the command line or taken from standard input.  The <b>-n</b> option must be
       used if no text message is to be supplied with the  page  requestâ€”as  for  a  numeric-only  pager.   Text
       supplied  to  the  paging  system is sent exactly as submitted including any newline, carriage return, or
       non-ASCII data.  Message preparation including filtering and formatting must be done prior to  submitting
       the  data  to  <u>sendpage</u>.  Note that text supplied on the command line does not include a trailing newline
       character.

       The order of options on the command line is significant.  Each page to be  transmitted  is  assigned  the
       current  value  of  parameters  specified  on the command line; e.g. whether or not to queue the request.
       This means that options that specify parameters for a particular destination must precede  the  pager  ID
       specified with the <b>-p</b> option.  For example,

              sendpage -l 2 -p sam Your network is hosed

       submits a page to ``sam'' that has service level 2 while

              sendpage -p sam -l 2 Your network is hosed

       submits  the  same  page but with the default service level (1).  Note also that parameter values persist
       across <b>-p</b> options so the following

              sendpage -l 0 -p sam -p 5551212 Your network is hosed

       submits two pages, both of which have service level 0.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-a</b> <u>time</u>     Schedule transmission at the indicated <u>time</u>.  Times are specified using  the  syntax  of  the
                   <u><a href="../man1/at.1.html">at</a></u>(1)  command;  e.g. ``now + 30 minutes'' to schedule transmission 30 minutes in the future.
                   By default, <u>sendpage</u> schedules pages for ``now''.  (In SNPP parlance  this  option  specifies
                   the  ``hold  time''  for  the  page; and may result in the page being delivered to the paging
                   terminal but not delivered to the user until the specified time.)

       <b>-D</b>          Enable notification by electronic mail when the  page  has  been  delivered  to  the  service
                   provider.  This option is meaningful only when communicating with a <u>HylaFAX</u> server.

       <b>-f</b> <u>from</u>     Use  <u>from</u>  as  the  identity  of  the  message sender.  Otherwise the sender is the user that
                   invoked <u>sendpage</u>.  The sender is an account name to which the <u>HylaFAX</u> software should  direct
                   email notification messages.  The <u>from</u> identity may be a fullblown ``From:'' line, e.g.  e.g.
                   ``Joe Blow &lt;<a href="mailto:joe@foo.com">joe@foo.com</a>&gt;'' and ``<a href="mailto:joe@foo.com">joe@foo.com</a> (Joe Blow)'' are acceptable.  If no host-part is
                   specified in the <u>from</u> string the local hostname is used.  This option is useful when <u>sendpage</u>
                   is  invoked on behalf of another user, such as in the implementation of an electronic mail to
                   pager gateway.

       <b>-h</b> [<u>modem</u>@]<u>host</u>[<u>:port</u>]
                   Force the jobs to be processed on a specific <u>host</u> and, optionally, using a particular  <u>modem</u>.
                   The  <u>host</u>  may  be either a symbolic name or a network address.  If no <b>-h</b> option is supplied,
                   <u>sendpage</u> uses the SNPPSERVER environment variable to identify the SNPP server  to  which  the
                   pages  should  be  directed.   If  no server is specified then <u>sendpage</u> attempts to contact a
                   server on the local host.  If no modem is  specified,  the  job  will  be  submitted  to  any
                   available modem.

       <b>-I</b> time     If  a job must be requeued because of a communication failure schedule the retry according to
                   the specified <u>time</u>.  Times are given in seconds.  Minutes, hours, and days can  be  specified
                   with  ``<u>min</u>'',  ``<u>hour</u>'', and ``<u>day</u>'' suffixes, respectively.  By default <u>HylaFAX</u> reschedules
                   jobs using retry times that depend on the manner in which  the  job  failed;  this  interface
                   permits  a  user  to  override  this  algorithm and specify a single fixed retry time for all
                   communication failures.  This option is meaningful only when  communicating  with  a  <u>HylaFAX</u>
                   server.

       <b>-l</b> level    Specify a particular service <u>level</u> to use in delivering a page.  A service level defines both
                   a  scheduling  priority and the time that a client is willing to wait to find out if delivery
                   is successful or not.  Normal  delivery  is  obtained  with  level  1  (default).   The  SNPP
                   specification  identifies level 0 as the highest priority service level with levels 1-7 lower
                   priority and levels 8-11 vendor/server-specific.  For <u>HylaFAX</u>  server  machines  the  mapping
                   between  service  level  and  scheduling priority is defined by the configuration of the SNPP
                   server process; see the <b>PriorityMap</b> parameter in <u><a href="../man8/hfaxd.8.html">hfaxd</a></u>(8)

       <b>-n</b>          Send to a numeric-only paging device; i.e. do not send a text message in the paging request.

       <b>-N</b>          Do not notify the sender by electronic mail when the page has been delivered to  the  service
                   provider (default).  This option is meaningful only when communicating with a <u>HylaFAX</u> server.

       <b>-p</b> <u>PIN</u>      The  Pager  Identification  Number  (PIN)  for  a terminal that is to receive the message.  A
                   message can be sent to multiple destinations by specifying multiple <b>-p</b> options.

       <b>-q</b>          Mark pages to be queued on the server and  do  not  wait  for  their  delivery.   By  default
                   <u>sendpage</u>  conforms  to  the SNPP spec by synchronously waiting for each page to be delivered.
                   This option instructs <u>sendpage</u> to submit one or pages and then terminate immediately  without
                   waiting  for  their  completion.   When  pages  are  queued  it  is advisable to enable email
                   notification with the <b>-D</b> or <b>-R</b> options.  Job queueing is a non-standard function of the  SNPP
                   implementation in <u>HylaFAX</u> and is not available when submitting pages to non-<u>HylaFAX</u> servers.

       <b>-R</b>          Enable  notification  by  electronic  mail when the message has been delivered and when it is
                   requeued for retransmission.  <u>HylaFAX</u> will always notify the sender  by  electronic  mail  if
                   there  is  problem  delivering a page (irregardless of the email notification setting).  This
                   option is meaningful only when communicating with a <u>HylaFAX</u> server.

       <b>-s</b> <u>subject</u>  Set the ``subject'' for the specified pages according to <u>subject</u>.   For  <u>HylaFAX</u>  <u>subject</u>  is
                   used  as  the  identifier  string returned in any email notification messages (instead of the
                   usual job identifier number).  This option is useful for applications  that  cross  reference
                   notification messages against job submissions.

       <b>-t</b> <u>tries</u>    Make  no more than <u>tries</u> attempts to send the page.  By default, <u>HylaFAX</u> will terminate a job
                   if: 3 consecutive attempts to send a particular message fail, or it appears the  receiver  is
                   not  a service provider.  Otherwise <u>HylaFAX</u> places no limit on the <u>number</u> of attempts to send
                   a page, instead terminating a job if it is not  completed  within  a  fixed  period  of  time
                   specified  by  the  service  level.   Note  that  a  try  is a phone call in which carrier is
                   established and the IXO/TAP or UCP protocol is commenced; this  is  contrasted  with  a  call
                   attempt  that  might  have  failed because the line was busy.  This option is meaningful only
                   when communicating with a <u>HylaFAX</u> server.

       <b>-T</b> <u>dials</u>    Make no more than <u>dials</u> phone calls when attempting to send a page.  By default, <u>HylaFAX</u> will
                   terminate a job if: 12 attempts to reach a service provider fail, or it appears the  receiver
                   is  not a service provider.  Otherwise <u>HylaFAX</u> terminates a job if it is not completed within
                   a fixed period of time specified by the <u>service</u> <u>level</u>.  This option is meaningful  only  when
                   communicating with a <u>HylaFAX</u> server.

       <b>-v</b>          Trace  the  protocol between <u>sendpage</u> and the SNPP server process that does the delivery work
                   on the remote machine.  This information is directed to the standard output.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>PARAMETERS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>sendpage</u>    reads    configuration     information     from     the     files     <b>/etc/hylafax/hyla.conf</b>,
       <b>/etc/hylafax/sendpage.conf</b>,  and  <b><a href="file:~/.hylarc">~/.hylarc</a></b>;  in  that order.  Configuration files follow the conventions
       described in <u><a href="../man1/hylafax-client.1.html">hylafax-client</a></u>(1).  The following configuration parameters are recognized:
       <b>Tag</b>             <b>Type</b>       <b>Default</b>      <b>Description</b>
       HoldTime        string     -            hold time to assign to pages
       Host            string     localhost    host to contact for service
       MailAddr        string     -            mail address for notification messages
       MaxDials        integer    12           times to retry dialing
       MaxTries        integer    3            times to retry transmission
       Notify          string     none         control email notification
       Port            integer    444          port to use in contacting server
       Protocol        string     tcp          protocol to use in contacting server
       QueueSend       boolean    No           whether or not to queue pages
       RetryTime       string     -            delay between failed attempts to send
       ServiceLevel    integer                 SNPP service level for pages
       Verbose         boolean    No           whether or not to enable protocol tracing

       The configuration parameters are explained below:

       <b>HoldTime</b>       The hold time to assign to pages.  (Equivalent to the <b>-a</b> option.)

       <b>Host</b>           The host to contact for service.  (Equivalent to the <b>-h</b> option.)

       <b>MailAddr</b>       The electronic mail address to direct notification messages  from  the  server.   If  this
                      string   is  specified  without  an  ``@hostname''  part  then  the  local  hostname  will
                      automatically be appended.  (Equivalent to the <b>-f</b> option.)

       <b>MaxDials</b>       The maximum number of times to dial the  phone  for  each  job.   (Equivalent  to  the  <b>-T</b>
                      option.)

       <b>MaxTries</b>       The maximum number of times to retry sending a job.  (Equivalent to the <b>-t</b> option.)

       <b>Notify</b>         Control  the  email  notification  messages  from  the  server.  This string may be one of
                      ``done'', ``none'', ``requeued'' or ``default'' with an  optionally  preceding  ``when  ''
                      (e.g.  ``when done'').  Note that ``when requeued'' implies ``when done''.  (Equivalent to
                      the <b>-D</b>, <b>-R</b>, and <b>-N</b> options.)

       <b>Port</b>           The network port to contact for service.  (Equivalent to the <b>-h</b> option.)

       <b>Protocol</b>       The name of the communication protocol to use when contacting a  server.   (Equivalent  to
                      the <b>SNPPSERVICE</b> environment variable.)

       <b>QueueSend</b>      Control  whether  or  not  to  wait  for the pages to be delivered.  (Equivalent to the <b>-q</b>
                      option.)

       <b>RetryTime</b>      The time to delay between job retries due to a communication failure.  (Equivalent to  the
                      <b>-I</b> option.)

       <b>ServiceLevel</b>   The SNPP service level to assign to each page.  (Equivalent to the <b>-l</b> option.)

       <b>Verbose</b>        Control protocol tracing.  (Equivalent to the <b>-v</b> option.)

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       The following environment variables are used by <u>sendpage</u>:

       <b>SNPPSERVER</b>     The  identity  of  the  SNPP  server  to  contact for service.  This value is specified as
                      ``[<u>modem</u>@]<u>host</u>[:<u>port</u>]'' where <u>host</u> is either a host  name  or  the  Internet  ``.''  (dot)
                      address  of  the  host;  <u>port</u>  is  the  TCP port number or service name to use (default is
                      ``snpp'' or 444); and <u>modem</u> is an optional modem name or class on the  server  machine  to
                      use  in  processing  the  requests  (this  is  meaningful  only when the server is running
                      <u>HylaFAX</u>).

       <b>SNPPSERVICE</b>    The communication service specification for communicating  with  the  SNPP  server.   This
                      value is specified as ``<u>port</u>[/<u>protocol</u>]''; by default ``444/tcp''.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       /var/spool/hylafax/tmp/sndpageXXXXXX    temporary files

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       The  phone  number  of the pager service provider is stored on the server machine and is not specified by
       the user; this is a departure from pager support that was supplied with <u>HylaFAX</u> version 3.0.

       <u>HylaFAX</u> version 3.0 used to recognize a null text message and assume the destination  paging  device  was
       numeric-only.   This  is  no longer true; if a null text message is submitted then a null message will be
       included in the paging request.  This may cause paging requests submitted to ``real SNPP'' servers to  be
       rejected  if the paging device is in fact numeric-only.  When sending to a numeric-only paging device the
       <b>-n</b> option should be used.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       It is not possible to page text- and non-text devices together; <u>sendpage</u> must be run twice, once to  send
       to text-capable devices and once to send to non-text devices.
