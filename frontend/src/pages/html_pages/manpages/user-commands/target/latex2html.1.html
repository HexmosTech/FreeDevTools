</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       latex2html - translate LaTeX files to HTML (HyperText Markup Language)

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>latex2html</b> <u>[options]</u> [target [target ...]]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual page explains the <b>LaTeX2HTML</b> utility, which is a <b>Perl</b> program that translates <b>LaTeX</b> document
       into <b>HTML</b> format. For each source file given as an  argument  the  translator  will  create  a  directory
       containing  the  corresponding  HTML  files.  For  details  and  examples, please consult the online html
       documentation,  a  copy  of  which  should  be  available  in  <u>/usr/share/doc/latex2html/manual.ps.gz</u>  or
       <u>/usr/share/doc/latex2html/html/</u>

</pre><h4><b>CAVEAT</b></h4><pre>
       This  documentation  has been derived from the TeX manual, and may not be up to date. Please refer to the
       online manual for authoritative documentation.

</pre><h4><b>Options</b> <b>controlling</b> <b>Titles,</b> <b>File-Names</b> <b>and</b> <b>Sectioning</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-t</b> <b>&lt;top-page-title&gt;</b>
              Same as setting: <u>$TITLE</u> <u>=</u> <u>&lt;top-page-title&gt;</u> <u>;</u> Name the document using this title.

       <b>-short_extn</b>
              Same as setting: <u>$SHORTEXTN</u> <u>=</u> <u>1;</u> Use a filename prefix of .htm for the produced <b>HTML</b>  files.  This
              is  particularly  useful for creating pages to be stored on CD-ROM or other media, to be used with
              operating systems that require a 3-character extension.

       <b>-long_titles</b> <b>&lt;num&gt;</b>
              Same as setting: <u>$LONG_TITLES</u> <u>=</u> <u>&lt;num&gt;;</u> Instead of the standard names:  node1.html,  node2.html,...
              the filenames for each <b>HTML</b> page are constructed from the first &lt;num&gt; words of the section heading
              for  that  page, separated by the `_' character.  Commas and common short words (a an to by of and
              for the) are omitted from both title and word-count.  When duplication of constructed filenames is
              detected (see also the <b>-unicase_titles</b> option), an incremented number starting from 2 is  appended
              to each duplicated filename.

       <b>-unicase_titles</b>
              Same  as setting: <u>$UNICASE_TITLES</u> <u>=</u> <u>1;</u> If set, and the <b>-long_titles</b> option is used, duplication of
              generated filenames is  checked  in  case  insensitive  manner.   Useful  under  case  insensitive
              filesystems such as NTFS or FAT.

       <b>-custom_titles</b>
              Same  as  setting:  <u>$CUSTOM_TITLES</u> <u>=</u> <u>1;</u> Instead of the standard names: node1.html, node2.html, ...
              the filenames for each <b>HTML</b> page are constructed using a <b>Perl</b> subroutine named custom_title_hook .
              The user may define his/her own version of this subroutine, within a .latex2html-init file say, to
              override the default (which uses the standard names). This subroutine takes the section-heading as
              a parameter and must return the required name, or the empty string (default).

       <b>-dir</b> <b>&lt;output-directory&gt;</b>
              Same as setting: <u>$DESTDIR</u> <u>=</u> <u>&lt;output-directory&gt;</u> <u>;</u> Redirect the output to the  specified  directory.
              The  default  behaviour  is to create (or reuse) a directory having the same name as the prefix of
              the document being processed.

       <b>-no_subdir</b>
              Same as setting: <u>$NO_SUBDIR</u> <u>=</u> <u>1;</u> Place the generated <b>HTML</b> files into the current  directory.  This
              overrides any <u>$DESTDIR</u> setting.

       <b>-prefix</b> <b>&lt;filename-prefix&gt;</b>
              Same  as  setting:  <u>$PREFIX</u>  <u>=</u>  <u>&lt;filename-prefix&gt;</u> <u>;</u> The &lt;filename-prefix&gt; will be prepended to all
              .gif, .pl and .html files produced, except  for  the  top-level  .html  file;  it  may  include  a
              (relative)  directory path. This will enable multiple products of <b>LaTeX2HTML</b> to peacefully coexist
              in the same directory. However, do  not  attempt  to  simultaneously  run  multiple  instances  of
              <b>LaTeX2HTML</b>  using  the  same  output  directory,  else various temporary files will overwrite each
              other.

       <b>-auto_prefix</b>
              Same as setting: <u>$AUTO_PREFIX</u> <u>=</u> <u>1;</u> Constructs the prefix as `&lt;title&gt;-' to be prepended to all  the
              files  produced,  where  &lt;title&gt;  is the name of the <b>LaTeX</b> file being processed.  (Note the `-' in
              this prefix.)  This overrides any <u>$PREFIX</u> setting.

       <b>-no_auto_link</b>
              Same as setting: <u>$NO_AUTO_LINK</u> <u>=</u> <u>1;</u>  If  $NO_AUTO_LINK  is  empty  and  variables  <u>$LINKPOINT</u>  and
              <u>$LINKNAME</u> are defined appropriately (as is the default in the latex2html.config file), then a hard
              link  to  the main <b>HTML</b> page is produced, using the name supplied in <u>$LINKNAME.</u>  Typically this is
              index.html; on many systems a file of this name will be used, if it exists, when a  browser  tries
              to view a URL which points to a directory. On other systems a different value for <u>$LINKNAME</u> may be
              appropriate.  Typically  <u>$LINKPOINT</u>  has  value  <u>$FILE.html,</u> but this may also be changed to match
              whichever HTML page is to become the target of the  automatic  link.   Use  of  the  -no_auto_link
              switch cancels this automatic linking facility, when not required for a particular document.

       <b>-split</b> <b>&lt;num&gt;</b>
              Same  as  setting:  <u>$MAX_SPLIT_DEPTH</u> <u>=</u> <u>&lt;num&gt;;</u> <u>(default</u> <u>is</u> <u>8)</u> Stop splitting sections into separate
              files at this depth. Specifying -split 0 will put the entire document into a single <b>HTML</b> file. See
              below for the different levels of sectioning. Also see the next item for how to set a ``relative''
              depth for splitting.

       <b>-split</b> <b>+&lt;num&gt;</b>
              Same as setting: <u>$MAX_SPLIT_DEPTH</u> <u>=</u> <u>-&lt;num&gt;;</u> <u>(default</u> <u>is</u> <u>8)</u> The level at which  to  stop  splitting
              sections  is  calculated ``relative to'' the shallowest level of sectioning that occurs within the
              document. For example, if the document contains  \section  commands,  but  no  \part  or  \chapter
              commands,  then  -split  +1  will  cause  splitting  at each \section but not at any deeper level;
              whereas -split +2 or -split  +3  also  split  down  to  \subsection  and  \subsubsection  commands
              respectively. Specifying -split +0 puts the entire document into a single <b>HTML</b> file.

       <b>-link</b> <b>&lt;num&gt;</b>
              Same  as  setting:  <u>$MAX_LINK_DEPTH</u>  <u>=</u>  <u>&lt;num&gt;;</u> <u>(default</u> <u>is</u> <u>4)</u> For each node, create links to child
              nodes down to this much deeper than the node's sectioning-level.  Specifying -link 0 will show  no
              links  to  child  nodes  from that page, -link 1 will show only the immediate descendants, etc.  A
              value at least as big as that of the -split &lt;num&gt; depth  will  produce  a  mini  table-of-contents
              (when  not  empty)  on each page, for the tree structure rooted at that node.  When the page has a
              sectioning-level less than the -split depth, so that the a mini  table-of-contents  has  links  to
              other  <b>HTML</b>  pages, this table is located at the bottom of the page, unless placed elsewhere using
              the \tableofchildlinks command.  On pages having a sectioning-level  just  less  than  the  -split
              depth  the  mini  table-of-contents  contains links to subsections etc. occurring on the same <b>HTML</b>
              page. Now the table is located at the  top  of  this  page,  unless  placed  elsewhere  using  the
              \tableofchildlinks command.

       <b>-toc_depth</b> <b>&lt;num&gt;</b>
              Same  as  setting:  <u>$TOC_DEPTH</u>  <u>=</u>  <u>&lt;num&gt;;</u> <u>(default</u> <u>is</u> <u>4)</u> Sectioning levels down to &lt;num&gt; are to be
              included within the Table-of-Contents tree.

       <b>-toc_stars</b>
              Same as setting: <u>$TOC_STARS</u> <u>=</u> <u>1;</u> Sections created using the starred-form  of  sectioning  commands
              are included within the Table-of-Contents. As with <b>LaTeX,</b> normally such sections are not listed.

       <b>-show_section_numbers</b>
              Same  as  setting: <u>$SHOW_SECTION_NUMBERS</u> <u>=</u> <u>1;</u> Show section numbers. By default section numbers are
              not shown, so as to encourage the use of particular sections as stand-alone documents.   In  order
              to be shown, section titles must be unique and must not contain inlined graphics.

       <b>-add_ref_name</b>
              Same  as setting: <u>$ADD_REF_NAME</u> <u>=</u> <u>1;</u> Usually cross reference text contains only the caption number
              as a hyperlink to the corresponding <b>LaTeX</b> label. However, it could be handy to see the name of the
              object referenced, if the reference text would contain both the caption  number  and  the  caption
              name.  With -add_ref_name the caption name is shown additionally when available.

       <b>-cut_ref_num</b>
              Same  as  setting: <u>$CUT_REF_NUM</u> <u>=</u> <u>1;</u> Usually cross reference text contains only the caption number
              as a hyperlink to the corresponding <b>LaTeX</b> label. With -add_ref_name the caption name can be  shown
              additionally.  If  the  caption  number  is  not  desired, it can be cut out with -cut_ref_num. If
              -cut_ref_num is given and -add_ref_name is not,  then  the  cross  reference  text  is  suppressed
              completely and a cross reference button shown instead.

       <b>-unsegment</b>
              Same  as  setting:  <u>$UNSEGMENT</u>  <u>=</u>  <u>1;</u>  Treat  a segmented document (see the section about document
              segmentation) like it were not segmented. This  will  cause  the  translator  to  concatenate  all
              segments and process them as a whole. You might find this useful to check a segmented document for
              consistency.  For all documents the sectioning levels referred to above are:
               0  document
               1  part
               2  chapter
               3  section
               4  subsection
               5  subsubsection
               6  paragraph
               7  subparagraph
               8  subsubparagraph

       These  levels apply even when the document contains no sectioning for the shallower levels; e.g. no \part
       or \chapter commands is most common, especially when using <b>LaTeX's</b> article document-class.

</pre><h4><b>Options</b> <b>controlling</b> <b>Extensions</b> <b>and</b> <b>Special</b> <b>Features</b></h4><pre>
       The switches described here govern the type of <b>HTML</b> code that can be generated, and how to choose between
       the available options when there are alternative strategies for implementing portions of <b>LaTeX</b> code.

       <b>-html_version</b> <b>(2.0|3.2|4.0|5.0)[,(math|i18n)]*</b>
              Same as setting: <u>$HTML_VERSION</u> <u>=</u> <u>...</u>  <u>;</u> This specifies both the <b>HTML</b> version to generate, and  any
              extra  (non-standard)  <b>HTML</b>  features  that  may be required.  The version number corresponds to a
              published DTD for an <b>HTML</b> standard. A corresponding <b>Perl</b> file in  the  versions/  subdirectory  is
              loaded;  these  files  are  named `html&lt;num&gt;.pl'.  Following the version number, a comma-separated
              list of extensions can be given. Each corresponds to  a  file  `&lt;name&gt;.pl'  also  located  in  the
              versions/  subdirectory.  When  such  a  file  is  loaded the resulting HTML code can no longer be
              expected to validate with the specified DTD. An exception is math when the -no_math switch is also
              used, which should still validate.  Currently, versions 2.0, 3.2, 4.0 and 5.0 are available.   The
              default version is usually set to be `5.0', within latex2html.config.

       <b>-no_tex_defs</b>
              Same as setting: <u>$TEXDEFS</u> <u>=</u> <u>0;</u> <u>(default</u> <u>is</u> <u>1)</u> When <u>$TEXDEFS</u> is set (default) the file texdefs.perl
              will  be  read.  This provides code to allow common TEX commands like \def, \newbox, \newdimen and
              others, to be recognised, especially within the document  preamble.  In  the  case  of  \def,  the
              definition  may  even  be  fully interpreted, but this requires the pattern-matching to be not too
              complicated.  If <u>$TEXDEFS</u> is `0' or empty, then texdefs.perl will not be  loaded;  the  translator
              will  make  no  attempt  to  interpret  any  raw  TEX commands. This feature is intended to enable
              sophisticated authors the ability to insert  arbitrary  TEX  commands  in  environments  that  are
              destined  to  be  processed  by <b>LaTeX</b> anyway; e.g. figures, theorems, pictures, etc.  However this
              should rarely be needed, as now there is better support for these types of environment. There  are
              now  other  methods  to specify which chunks of code are to be passed to <b>LaTeX</b> for explicit image-
              generation; see the discussion of the makeimage environment.

       <b>-external_file</b> <b>&lt;filename&gt;</b>
              Same as setting: <u>$EXTERNAL_FILE</u> <u>=</u> <u>&lt;filename&gt;</u> <u>;</u> Specifies the prefix of the  .aux  file  that  this
              document  should  read.   The  .aux  extension will be appended to this prefix to get the complete
              filename, with directory path if needed.  This file could contain necessary information  regarding
              citations, figure, table and section numbers from <b>LaTeX</b> and perhaps other information also. Use of
              this  switch  is  vital  for  document  segments,  processed separately and linked to appear as if
              generated from a single LaTeX document.

       <b>-font_size</b> <b>&lt;size&gt;</b>
              Same as setting: <u>$FONT_SIZE</u> <u>=</u> <u>&lt;size&gt;</u> <u>;</u> This option provides better control over the font  size  of
              environments  made  into  images  using  <b>LaTeX.</b>   &lt;size&gt;  must be one of the font sizes that <b>LaTeX</b>
              recognizes; i.e. `10pt', `11pt', `12pt', etc. Default is `10pt', or whatever option may have  been
              specified  on  the  \documentclass  or \documentstyle line.  Whatever size is selected, it will be
              magnified   by   the   installation   variables   <u>$MATH_SCALE_FACTOR,</u>   <u>$FIGURE_SCALE_FACTOR</u>   and
              <u>$DISP_SCALE_FACTOR</u> as appropriate.  Note: This switch provides no control over the size of text on
              the HTML pages. Such control is subject entirely to the user's choices of settings for the browser
              windows.

       <b>-scalable_fonts</b>
              Same  as  setting:  <u>$SCALABLE_FONTS</u>  <u>=</u>  <u>1;</u>  This  is  used when scalable fonts, such as PostScript
              versions of the TEX fonts, are available for image-generation.   It  has  the  effect  of  setting
              <u>$PK_GENERATION</u>  to  `1',  and  <u>$DVIPS_MODE</u> to be empty, overriding any previous settings for these
              variables.

       <b>-no_math</b>
              Same as setting: <u>$NO_SIMPLE_MATH</u> <u>=</u> <u>1;</u> Ordinarily simple mathematical expressions are set using the
              ordinary text font, but italicized. When part of the expression can not be represented  this  way,
              an  image  is  made  of the whole formula. This is called ``simple math''. When <u>$NO_SIMPLE_MATH</u> is
              set, then all mathematics is made into images, whether  simple  or  not.   However,  if  the  math
              extension  is  loaded,  using the -html_version switch described earlier, then specifying -no_math
              produces a quite different effect. Now it is the  special  &lt;MATH&gt;  tags  and  entities  which  are
              canceled.  In  their  place  a  sophisticated scheme for parsing mathematical expressions is used.
              Images are made of those sub-parts of  a  formula  which  cannot  be  adequately  expressed  using
              (italicized)  text characters and &lt;SUB&gt; and &lt;SUP&gt; tags. See the subsection on mathematics for more
              details.

       <b>-local_icons</b>
              Same as setting: <u>$LOCAL_ICONS</u> <u>=</u> <u>1;</u> A copy of each of the icons actually used within  the  document
              is  placed  in the directory along with the <b>HTML</b> files and generated images. This allows the whole
              document to be fully self-contained, within this directory; otherwise the icons must be  retrieved
              from  a  (perhaps remote) server.  It is also the default behavior if $ICONSERVER is not set.  The
              icons are normally copied from a subdirectory of the

              <b>$LATEX2HTMLDIR,</b>
               set within latex2html.config. An alternative set of icons can be used by specifying a  (relative)
              directory path in $ALTERNATIVE_ICONS to where the customised images can be found.

       <b>-init_file</b> <b>&lt;file&gt;</b>
              Load   the   specified   initialisation  file.  This  <b>Perl</b>  file  will  be  loaded  after  loading
              <u>$HOME/.latex2html-init,</u> or .latex2html-init in the local directory, if either file exists.  It  is
              read at the time the switch is processed, so the contents of the file may change any of the values
              of  any  of  the  variables that were previously established, as well as any default options. More
              than one initialisation file can be read in this way.

       <b>-no_fork</b>
              Same as setting: <u>$NOFORK</u> <u>=</u> <u>1;</u> When set this disables a feature in the early part of the processing
              whereby some memory-intensive operations are performed by `forked' child processes.  Some  single-
              task  operating systems, such as DOS, do not support this feature. Having <u>$NOFORK</u> set then ensures
              that unnecessary file-handles that  are  needed  with  the  forked  processes,  are  not  consumed
              unnecessarily, perhaps resulting in a fatal <b>Perl</b> error.

       <b>-iso_language</b> <b>&lt;type&gt;</b>
              This  enables  you to specify a different language type than 'EN' to be used in the lang attribute
              of the <b>HTML</b> document, e.g. 'en-US'.

       <b>-short_index</b>
              Same as setting: <u>$SHORT_INDEX</u> <u>=</u> <u>1;</u> Creates shorter Index listings, using codified links;  this  is
              fully compatible with the makeidx package.

       <b>-no_footnode</b>
              Same  as setting: <u>$NO_FOOTNODE</u> <u>=</u> <u>1;</u> Suppresses use of a separate file for footnotes; instead these
              are placed at the bottom of the <b>HTML</b> pages where the references occur.  When this option is  used,
              it  is  frequently  desirable to change the style of the marker used to indicate the presence of a
              footnote.    This    is    done    as    in    <b>LaTeX,</b>    using    code    such     as     follows.
              \renewcommand{\thefootnote}{\arabic{footnote}}  All  the  styles \arabic, \alph, \roman, \Alph and
              \Roman are available.

       <b>-numbered_footnotes</b>
              Same as setting: <u>$NUMBERED_FOOTNOTES</u> <u>=</u> <u>1;</u> If this is set you will get every footnote applied  with
              a subsequent number, to ease readability.

       <b>-address</b> <b>&lt;author-address&gt;</b>
              Same  as  setting:  <u>$ADDRESS</u>  <u>=</u>  <u>&lt;author-address&gt;</u>  <u>;</u>  Sign  each  page  with  this  address.   See
              latex2html.config for an example using <b>Perl</b> code to  automatically  include  the  date.   A  user-
              defined <b>Perl</b> subroutine called &amp;custom_address can be used instead, if defined; it takes the value
              of  <u>$ADDRESS</u>  as  a  parameter,  which  may  be  used or ignored as desired. At the time when this
              subroutine will be called, variables named $depth, <u>$title,</u> <u>$file</u> hold the sectioning-level,  title
              and  filename of the <b>HTML</b> page being produced; <u>$FILE</u> holds the name of the filename for the title-
              page of the whole document.

       <b>-info</b> <b>&lt;string&gt;</b>
              Same as setting: <u>$INFO</u> <u>=</u> <u>&lt;string&gt;</u> <u>;</u> Generate a new  section  ``About  this  document''  containing
              information  about  the  document being translated. The default is to generate such a section with
              information on the original document, the date, the user and the translator. An empty  string  (or
              the  value  `0')  disables the creation of this extra section.  If a non-empty string is given, it
              will be placed as the contents of  the  ``About  this  document''  page  instead  of  the  default
              information.

</pre><h4><b>Switches</b> <b>controlling</b> <b>Image</b> <b>Generation</b></h4><pre>
       These switches affect whether images are created at all, whether old images are reused on subsequent runs
       or new ones created afresh, and whether anti-aliasing effects are used within the images themselves.

       <b>-use_dvipng</b>
              Use  the  dvipng  program  to  generate  png images, rather than using dvips followed by gs.  This
              method produces better alignment of math formulas which extend significantly above  or  below  the
              line of text in which they are contained.

       <b>-nouse_pdftex</b>
              Generate  intermediate  images  with plain latex instead of pdflatex.  If your document is written
              for pdflatex, run ``pdflatex'' first and then ``latex2html''.  If your  document  is  written  for
              plain, dvi-producing latex, run ``latex'' first and then ``latex2html -nouse_pdftex''.

       <b>-use_luatex</b>
              Generate  intermediate images with lualatex instead of plain latex.  Produced PDF output will then
              be translated into images with  GhostScript.   Useful  for  lualatex  documents  which  cannot  be
              translated by latex or pdflatex.

       <b>-use_luadvi</b>
              Generate  intermediate  images  with  dvilualatex  instead of plain latex.  Useful for dvilualatex
              documents which cannot be translated by latex.

       <b>-use_hilite</b>
              Additional support for the listings and minted packages: generate colorized syntax highlighting of
              lstlisting environments and lstinline snippets via the  external  pygmentize  or  source-highlight
              tool. For this option to work, either Pygments or GNU source-highlight package must be installed.

       <b>-hilite_opts</b> <b>&lt;string&gt;</b>
              Additional options to pygmentize or GNU source-highlight. See the appropriate manpage for the list
              of  possible  options,  and  the  console  output for the actual source highlighting command lines
              generated by latex2html.

       <b>-ascii_mode</b>
              Same as setting: <u>$ASCII_MODE</u> <u>=</u> <u>$EXTERNAL_IMAGES</u> <u>=</u> <u>1;</u> Use only ASCII characters and do not  include
              any  images  in  the  final  output.  With -ascii_mode the output of the translator can be used on
              character-based browsers, such as lynx, which do not support inlined images (via the &lt;IMG&gt; tag).

       <b>-nolatex</b>
              Same as setting: <u>$NOLATEX</u> <u>=</u> <u>1;</u> Disable the mechanism for passing unknown environments to <b>LaTeX</b> for
              processing. This can be thought of as ``draft mode'' which allows faster translation of the  basic
              document  structure  and  text, without fancy figures, equations or tables.  (This option has been
              superseded by the -no_images option, see below.)

       <b>-external_images</b>
              Same as setting: <u>$EXTERNAL_IMAGES</u> <u>=</u> <u>1;</u> Instead  of  including  any  generated  images  inside  the
              document, leave them outside the document and provide hypertext links to them.

       <b>-ps_images</b>
              Same  as setting: <u>$PS_IMAGES</u> <u>=</u> <u>$EXTERNAL_IMAGES</u> <u>=</u> <u>1;</u> Use links to external PostScript files rather
              than inlined images in the chosen graphics format.

       <b>-discard</b>
              Same as setting: <u>$DISCARD_PS</u> <u>=</u> <u>1;</u> The temporary PostScript files are discarded  immediately  after
              they have been used to create the image in the desired graphics format.

       <b>-no_images</b>
              Same  as setting: <u>$NO_IMAGES</u> <u>=</u> <u>1;</u> Do not attempt to produce any inlined images. The missing images
              can be generated ``off-line'' by restarting <b>LaTeX2HTML</b> with the option -images_only .

       <b>-images_only</b>
              Same as setting: <u>$IMAGES_ONLY</u> <u>=</u> <u>1;</u> Try to convert any inlined images  that  were  left  over  from
              previous runs of <b>LaTeX2HTML.</b>

       <b>-reuse</b> <b>&lt;reuse_option&gt;</b>
              Same  as  setting:  <u>$REUSE</u> <u>=</u> <u>&lt;reuse_option&gt;;</u> This switch specifies the extent to which image files
              are to be shared or recycled.  There are three valid options: [*] 0 Do not ever share  or  recycle
              image  files.  This choice also invokes an interactive session prompting the user about what to do
              about a pre-existing <b>HTML</b> directory, if it exists.  [*] 1 Recycle image files from a previous  run
              if  they are available, but do not share identical images that must be created in this run.  [*] 2
              Recycle image files from a previous run and share identical images from this  run.   This  is  the
              default.  A later section provides additional information about image-reuse.

       <b>-no_reuse</b>
              Same  as  setting:  <u>$REUSE</u>  <u>=</u>  <u>0;</u>  Do  not  share  or  recycle  images  generated  during previous
              translations.  This is equivalent to -reuse 0 . (This will enable the initial interactive  session
              during which the user is asked whether to reuse the old directory, delete its contents or quit.)

       <b>-antialias</b>
              Same  as  setting:  <u>$ANTI_ALIAS</u>  <u>=</u> <u>1;</u> <u>(Default</u> <u>is</u> <u>0.)</u>  Generated images of figure environments and
              external PostScript files should use anti-aliasing. By default  anti-aliasing  is  not  used  with
              these images, since this may interfere with the contents of the images themselves.

       <b>-antialias_text</b>
              Same  as setting: <u>$ANTI_ALIAS_TEXT</u> <u>=</u> <u>1;</u> <u>(Default</u> <u>is</u> <u>1.)</u>  Generated images of typeset material such
              as text, mathematical formulas, tables and the content of makeimage environments, should use anti-
              aliasing effects.  The default is normally to use anti-aliasing  for  text,  since  the  resulting
              images are much clearer on-screen. However the default may have been changed locally.

       <b>-no_antialias</b>
              Same  as  setting:  <u>$ANTI_ALIAS</u>  <u>=</u> <u>0;</u> <u>(Default</u> <u>is</u> <u>0.)</u>  Generated images of figure environments and
              external PostScript files should not use anti-aliasing with images, though the local  default  may
              have been changed to use it.

       <b>-no_antialias_text</b>
              Same  as  setting:  <u>$ANTI_ALIAS_TEXT</u>  <u>=</u>  <u>0;</u>  <u>(Default</u> <u>is</u> <u>1.)</u>  Generated images of typeset material
              should not use anti-aliasing effects. Although on-screen images of text  are  definitely  improved
              using  anti-aliasing,  printed  images  can  be  badly  blurred, even at 300dpi. Higher resolution
              printers do a much better job with the resulting grey-scale images.

       <b>-white</b> Same as  setting:  <u>$WHITE_BACKGROUND</u>  <u>=</u>  <u>1;</u>  <u>(Default</u>  <u>is</u>  <u>1.)</u>   Ensures  that  images  of  figure
              environments have a white background.  Otherwise transparency effects may not work correctly.

       <b>-no_white</b>
              Same  as  setting:  <u>$WHITE_BACKGROUND</u>  <u>=</u>  <u>'';</u> <u>(Default</u> <u>is</u> <u>1.)</u>  Cancels the requirement that figure
              environments have a white background.

       <b>-ldump</b> Same as setting: <u>$LATEX_DUMP</u> <u>=</u> <u>1;</u> <u>(Default</u> <u>is</u> <u>0.)</u>   Use  this  if  you  want  to  speed  up  image
              processing  during  the 2nd and subsequent runs of <b>LaTeX2HTML</b> on the same document. The translator
              now produces a <b>LaTeX</b> format-dump of the preamble to images.tex which is used on  subsequent  runs.
              This  significantly  reduces  the  startup  time  when  <b>LaTeX</b> reads the images.tex file for image-
              generation.  This process actually consumes additional time on  the  first  run,  since  <b>LaTeX</b>  is
              called  twice  -- once to create the format-dump, then again to load and use it. The pay-off comes
              with the faster loading on subsequent runs. Approximately 1 Meg of disk space is consumed  by  the
              dump file.

</pre><h4><b>Switches</b> <b>controlling</b> <b>Navigation</b> <b>Panels</b></h4><pre>
       The  following  switches  govern whether to include one or more navigation panels on each <b>HTML</b> page, also
       which buttons to include within such a panel.

       <b>-no_navigation</b>
              Same as setting: <u>$NO_NAVIGATION</u> <u>=</u> <u>1;</u> Disable the mechanism for putting navigation  links  in  each
              page.  This overrides any settings of the <u>$TOP_NAVIGATION,</u> <u>$BOTTOM_NAVIGATION</u> and <u>$AUTO_NAVIGATION</u>
              variables.

       <b>-top_navigation</b>
              Same as setting: <u>$TOP_NAVIGATION</u> <u>=</u> <u>1;</u> Put navigation links at the top of each page.

       <b>-bottom_navigation</b>
              Same  as  setting: <u>$BOTTOM_NAVIGATION</u> <u>=</u> <u>1;</u> Put navigation links at the bottom of each page as well
              as the top.

       <b>-auto_navigation</b>
              Same as setting: <u>$AUTO_NAVIGATION</u> <u>=</u> <u>1;</u> Put navigation links at the top of each page. Also put  one
              at the bottom of the page, if the page exceeds <u>$WORDS_IN_PAGE</u> number of words (default = 450).

       <b>-next_page_in_navigation</b>
              Same  as  setting:  <u>$NEXT_PAGE_IN_NAVIGATION</u>  <u>=</u>  <u>1;</u>  Put  a  link  to the next logical page in the
              navigation panel.

       <b>-previous_page_in_navigation</b>
              Same as setting: <u>$PREVIOUS_PAGE_IN_NAVIGATION</u> <u>=</u> <u>1;</u> Put a link to the previous logical page in  the
              navigation panel.

       <b>-contents_in_navigation</b>
              Same  as  setting:  <u>$CONTENTS_IN_NAVIGATION</u>  <u>=</u>  <u>1;</u>  Put  a  link  to  the table-of-contents in the
              navigation panel if there is one.

       <b>-index_in_navigation</b>
              Same as setting: <u>$INDEX_IN_NAVIGATION</u> <u>=</u> <u>1;</u> Put a link to the index-page in the navigation panel if
              there is an index.

</pre><h4><b>Switches</b> <b>for</b> <b>Linking</b> <b>to</b> <b>other</b> <b>documents</b></h4><pre>
       When processing a single stand-alone document, the switches described  in  this  section  should  not  be
       needed at all, since the automatically generated navigation panels, described on the previous page should
       generate  all  the  required  navigation links. However if a document is to be regarded as part of a much
       larger document, then links from its first and final pages, to locations in other  parts  of  the  larger
       (virtual)  document, need to be provided explicitly for some of the buttons in the navigation panel.  The
       following switches allow for such links to other documents, by providing the title and URL for navigation
       panel hyperlinks. In particular, the ``Document Segmentation'' feature necessarily  makes  great  use  of
       these  switches.  It is usual for the text and targets of these navigation hyperlinks to be recorded in a
       Makefile, to avoid tedious typing of long command-lines having many switches.

       <b>-up_url</b> <b>&lt;URL&gt;</b>
              Same as setting: <u>$EXTERNAL_UP_LINK</u> <u>=</u> <u>&lt;URL&gt;</u> <u>;</u> Specifies  a  universal  resource  locator  (URL)  to
              associate with the ``UP'' button in the navigation panel(s).

       <b>-up_title</b> <b>&lt;string&gt;</b>
              Same as setting: <u>$EXTERNAL_UP_TITLE</u> <u>=</u> <u>&lt;string&gt;</u> <u>;</u> Specifies a title associated with this URL.

       <b>-prev_url</b> <b>&lt;URL&gt;</b>
              Same  as setting: <u>$EXTERNAL_PREV_LINK</u> <u>=</u> <u>&lt;URL&gt;</u> <u>;</u> Specifies a URL to associate with the ``PREVIOUS''
              button in the navigation panel(s).

       <b>-prev_title</b> <b>&lt;string&gt;</b>
              Same as setting: <u>$EXTERNAL_PREV_TITLE</u> <u>=</u> <u>&lt;string&gt;</u> <u>;</u> Specifies a title associated with this URL.

       <b>-down_url</b> <b>&lt;URL&gt;</b>
              Same as setting: <u>$EXTERNAL_DOWN_LINK</u> <u>=</u> <u>&lt;URL&gt;</u> <u>;</u> Specifies a URL for  the  ``NEXT''  button  in  the
              navigation panel(s).

       <b>-down_title</b> <b>&lt;string&gt;</b>
              Same as setting: <u>$EXTERNAL_DOWN_TITLE</u> <u>=</u> <u>&lt;string&gt;</u> <u>;</u> Specifies a title associated with this URL.

       <b>-contents</b> <b>&lt;URL&gt;</b>
              Same  as  setting:  <u>$EXTERNAL_CONTENTS</u>  <u>=</u> <u>&lt;URL&gt;</u> <u>;</u> Specifies a URL for the ``CONTENTS'' button, for
              document segments that would not otherwise have one.

       <b>-index</b> <b>&lt;URL&gt;</b>
              Same as setting: <u>$EXTERNAL_INDEX</u> <u>=</u> <u>&lt;URL&gt;</u> <u>;</u> Specifies a URL for the ``INDEX'' button, for  document
              segments that otherwise would not have an index.

       <b>-biblio</b> <b>&lt;URL&gt;</b>
              Same  as  setting:  <u>$EXTERNAL_BIBLIO</u>  <u>=</u>  <u>&lt;URL&gt;</u> <u>;</u> Specifies the URL for the bibliography page to be
              used, when not explicitly part of the document itself.  Warning: On some systems it  is  difficult
              to  give text-strings &lt;string&gt; containing space characters, on the command-line or via a Makefile.
              One way to overcome this is to use the corresponding variable.  Another  way  is  to  replace  the
              spaces with underscores (_).

</pre><h4><b>Switches</b> <b>for</b> <b>Help</b> <b>and</b> <b>Tracing</b></h4><pre>
       The  first  two  of  the  following  switches  are  self-explanatory. When problems arise in processing a
       document, the switches -debug and -verbosity will each cause <b>LaTeX2HTML</b> to generate more  output  to  the
       screen. These extra messages should help to locate the cause of the problem.

       <b>-tmp</b> <b>&lt;path&gt;</b>
              Define  a  temporary directory to use for image generation. If &lt;path&gt; is 0, the standard temporary
              directory <a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a> is used.

       <b>-h(elp)</b>
              Print out the list of all command-line options.

       <b>-v</b>     Print the current version of <b>LaTeX2HTML.</b>

       <b>-debug</b> Same as setting: <u>$DEBUG</u> <u>=</u> <u>1;</u> Run in debug-mode, displaying messages and/or diagnostic  information
              about files read, and utilities called by <b>LaTeX2HTML.</b>  Shows any messages produced by these calls.
              More  extensive diagnostics, from the <b>Perl</b> debugger, can be obtained by appending the string `-w-'
              to the 1st line of the latex2html (and other) <b>Perl</b> script(s).

       <b>-verbosity</b> <b>&lt;num&gt;</b>
              Same as setting: <u>$VERBOSITY</u> <u>=</u> <u>&lt;num&gt;;</u> Display messages revealing certain aspects of the  processing
              performed  by  <b>LaTeX2HTML</b>  on the provided input file(s). The &lt;num&gt; parameter can be an integer in
              the range 0 to 8. Each higher value adds to the messages produced.

       0.     No special tracing; as for versions of <b>LaTeX2HTML</b> prior to V97.1.

       1.     (This is the default.) Show section-headings and the corresponding HTML file names, and indicators
              that major stages in the processing have been completed.

       2.     Print environment names and identifier numbers, and  new  theorem-types.  Show  warnings  as  they
              occur,  and  indicators  for more stages of processing. Print names of files for storing auxiliary
              data arrays.

       3.     Print command names as they are encountered and processed; also any unknown  commands  encountered
              while  pre-processing.  Show  names of new commands, environments, theorems, counters and counter-
              dependencies, for each document partition.

       4.     Indicate command-substitution the pre-process of math-environments. Print the contents of  unknown
              environments  for  processing  in <b>LaTeX,</b> both before and after reverting to <b>LaTeX</b> source. Show all
              operations affecting the values of counters. Also show links, labels and sectioning keys,  at  the
              stages of processing.

       5.     Detail  the  processing in the document preamble. Show substitutions of new environments. Show the
              contents of all recognised environments, both before and after processing. Show the cached/encoded
              information for the image keys, allowing two images to be tested for equality.

       6.     Show replacements of new commands, accents and wrapped commands.

       7.     Trace the processing of commands in math mode; both before and after.

       8.     Trace the processing of all commands, both before and after.   The  command-line  option  sets  an
              initial  value  only.  During  processing the value of <u>$VERBOSITY</u> can be set dynamically using the
              \htmltracing{...} command, whose argument is the desired value,  or  by  using  the  more  general
              \HTMLset command as follows: \HTMLset{VERBOSITY}{&lt;num&gt;}.

</pre><h4><b>Other</b> <b>Configuration</b> <b>Variables,</b> <b>without</b> <b>switches</b></h4><pre>
       The  configuration variables described here do not warrant having a command-line switch to assign values.
       Either they represent aspects of <b>LaTeX2HTML</b>  that  are  specific  to  the  local  site,  or  they  govern
       properties  that should apply to all documents, rather than something that typically would change for the
       different documents within a particular sub-directory.  Normally these variables  have  their  value  set
       within  the latex2html.config file. In the following listing the defaults are shown, as the lines of Perl
       code used to establish these values. If a different value is required, then these can be assigned from  a
       local  .latex2html-init initialisation file, without affecting the defaults for other users, or documents
       processed from other directories.

       <b>$dd</b>    holds the string to be used in file-names to delimit directories; it is  set  internally  to  `/',
              unless  the  variable  has already been given a value within latex2html.config .  Note: This value
              cannot be set within a .latex2html-init initialisation file, since its value needs to be known  in
              order to find such a file.

       <b>$LATEX2HTMLDIR</b>
              Read  by the install-test script from latex2html.config, its value is inserted into the latex2html
              <b>Perl</b> script as part of the installation process.

       <b>$LATEX2HTMLSTYLES</b> <b>=</b> <b>$LATEX2HTMLDIR/styles</b> <b>;</b>
              Read from the latex2html.config file by install-test, its value is checked to locate  the  styles/
              directory.

       <b>$LATEX2HTMLVERSIONS</b> <b>=</b> <b>$LATEX2HTMLDIR/versions</b> <b>;</b>
              The  value  of  this variable should be set within latex2html.config to specify the directory path
              where the version and extension files can be found.

       <b>$ALTERNATIVE_ICONS</b> <b>=</b> <b>'';</b>
              This may contain the (relative) directory path to  a  set  of  customised  icons  to  be  used  in
              conjunction with the -local_icons switch.

       <b>$TEXEXPAND</b> <b>=</b> <b>$LATEX2HTMLDIR/texexpand</b> <b>;</b>
              Read  by  the  install-test  <b>Perl</b>  script  from latex2html.config, its value is used to locate the
              texexpand <b>Perl</b> script.

       <b>$PSTOIMG</b> <b>=</b> <b>$LATEX2HTMLDIR/pstoimg</b> <b>;</b>
              Read by the install-test <b>Perl</b> script from latex2html.config, its  value  is  used  to  locate  the
              pstoimg <b>Perl</b> script.

       <b>$IMAGE_TYPE</b> <b>=</b> <b>'&lt;image-type&gt;';</b>
              Set  in  latex2html.config,  the  currently supported &lt;image-type&gt;s are: svg, png and gif.  Vector
              formats such as svg look better at high resolution, while bitmap formats such as png  or  gif  are
              generally faster to download and to render.

       <b>$DVIPS</b> <b>=</b> <b>'dvips';</b>
              Read  from  latex2html.config by install-test, its value is checked to locate the dvips program or
              script.  There could be several reasons to change the value here:

                     add a switch -P&lt;printer&gt; to load a specific configuration-file; e.g. to use a specific  set
                     of PostScript fonts, for improved image-generation.

                     to  prepend  a  path  to a different version of dvips than normally available as the system
                     default (e.g. the printing requirements are different).

                     to append debugging switches, in case of poor quality images; one can see which  paths  are
                     being searched for fonts and other resources.

                     to prepend commands for setting path variables that dvips may need in order to locate fonts
                     or other resources.

              If  automatic  generation  of  fonts  is  required,  using  Metafont,  the following configuration
              variables are important.

              <b>$PK_GENERATION</b> <b>=</b> <b>1;</b>
                     This variable must be set, to initiate font-generation; otherwise fonts will be scaled from
                     existing resources on the local system.  In particular this variable must not  be  set,  if
                     one   wishes   to   use  PostScript  fonts  or  other  scalable  font  resources  (see  the
                     -scalable_fonts switch).

              <b>$DVIPS_MODE</b> <b>=</b> <b>'toshiba';</b>
                     The mode given here must be available in the  modes.mf  file,  located  with  the  Metafont
                     resource files, perhaps in the misc/ subdirectory.

              <b>$METAFONT_DPI</b> <b>=</b> <b>180;</b>
                     The  required  resolution,  in  dots-per-inch,  should  be  listed  specifically within the
                     MakeTeXPK script, called by dvips to invoke Metafont with the correct  parameters  for  the
                     required fonts.

       <b>$LATEX</b> <b>=</b> <b>'latex';</b>
              Read  from  latex2html.config by install-test, its value is checked to locate the latex program or
              script.  If <b>LaTeX</b> is having trouble finding style-files and/or packages, then the default  command
              can  be  prepended  with  other  commands  to  set environment variables intended to resolve these
              difficulties; e.g.  <u>$LATEX</u> <u>=</u> <u>'setenv</u> <u>TEXINPUTS</u> <u>&lt;path</u> <u>to</u> <u>search&gt;</u> <u>;</u>  <u>latex'</u>  <u>.</u>   There  are  several
              variables  to help control exactly which files are read by <b>LaTeX2HTML</b> and by <b>LaTeX</b> when processing
              images:

              <b>$TEXINPUTS</b>
                     This is normally set from the environment variable of the same name. If difficulties  occur
                     so that styles and packages are not being found, then extra paths can be specified here, to
                     resolve these difficulties.

              <b>$DONT_INCLUDE</b>
                     This provides a list of filenames and extensions to not include, even if requested to do so
                     by an \input or \include command.  (Consult latex2html.config for the default list.)

              <b>$DO_INCLUDE</b> <b>=</b> <b>'';</b>
                     List  of  exceptions within the <u>$DONT_INCLUDE</u> list. These files are to be read if requested
                     by an \input or \include command.

       <b>$ICONSERVER</b> <b>=</b> <b>'&lt;URL&gt;';</b>
              This is used to specify a URL to find the standard icons, as  used  for  the  navigation  buttons.
              Names   for   the   specific   images  size,  as  well  as  size  information,  can  be  found  in
              latex2html.config. The icons themselves can be replaced  by  customised  versions,  provided  this
              information  is correctly updated and the location of the customised images specified as the value
              of $ICONSERVER.  When the -local_icons switch is used, so that a copy of the icons is placed  with
              the  <b>HTML</b> files and other generated images, the value of $ICONSERVER is not needed within the <b>HTML</b>
              files themselves.

       <b>$NAV_BORDER</b> <b>=</b> <b>&lt;num&gt;;</b>
              The value given here results in a border, measured in points, around each icon.  A value of `0' is
              common, to maintain strict alignment of inactive and active buttons in the control panels.

       <b>$LINKNAME</b> <b>=</b> <b>'"index.$EXTN"';</b>
              This is used when the <u>$NO_AUTO_LINK</u> variable is empty, to allow a URL to the working directory  to
              be  sufficient to reach the main page of the completed document. It specifies the name of the <b>HTML</b>
              file which will be automatically linked to the directory name.  The value of <u>$EXTN</u> is .html unless
              <u>$SHORTEXTN</u> is set, in which case it is .htm .

       <b>$LINKPOINT</b> <b>=</b> <b>'"$FILE$EXTN"';</b>
              This specifies the name of the <b>HTML</b> file to be duplicated, or symbolically linked, with  the  name
              specified  in  <u>$LINKNAME.</u>   At the appropriate time the value of <u>$FILE</u> is the document name, which
              usually coincides with the name of the working directory.

       <b>$CHARSET</b> <b>=</b> <b>'utf-8';</b>
              This specifies the character set used within the <b>HTML</b> pages produced by <b>LaTeX2HTML.</b>  If  no  value
              is set in a configuration or initialisation file, the default value will be assumed. The lowercase
              form <u>$charset</u> is also recognised, but this is overridden by the uppercase form.

       <b>$ACCENT_IMAGES</b> <b>=</b> <b>'large';</b>
              Accented  characters  that are not part of the ISO-Latin fonts can be generated by making an image
              using <b>LaTeX.</b>  This variable contains a (comma-separated) list of <b>LaTeX</b> commands  for  setting  the
              style  to  be  used  when  these  images are made. If the value of this variable is empty then the
              accent is simply ignored, using an un-accented font character (not an image) instead.

       Within the color.perl package, the following two variables are  used  to  identify  the  names  of  files
       containing   specifications   for   named   colors.  Files  having  these  names  are  provided,  in  the
       <u>$LATEX2HTMLSTYLES</u> directory, but they could be moved elsewhere, or replaced by alternative  files  having
       different names.  In such a case the values of these variables should be altered accordingly.

       <b>$RGBCOLORFILE</b> <b>=</b> <b>'rgb.txt';</b>

       <b>$CRAYOLAFILE</b> <b>=</b> <b>'crayola.txt';</b>

       The following variables may well be altered from the system defaults, but this is best done using a local
       .latex2html-init  initialisation  file,  for overall consistency of style within documents located at the
       same site, or sites in close proximity.

       <b>$default_language</b> <b>=</b> <b>'english';</b>
              This establishes which language code is to be placed within the  &lt;!DOCTYPE  ...  &gt;  tag  that  may
              appear  at the beginning of the <b>HTML</b> pages produced. Loading a package for an alternative language
              can be expected to change the value of this variable.  See  also  the  <u>$TITLES_LANGUAGE</u>  variable,
              described next.

       <b>$TITLES_LANGUAGE</b> <b>=</b> <b>'english';</b>
              This  variable  is used to specify the actual strings used for standard document sections, such as
              ``Contents'', ``References'', ``Table of Contents'', etc.  Support for French and German titles is
              available in corresponding packages. Loading such a package will normally alter the value of  this
              variable, as well as the <u>$default_language</u> variable described above.

       <b>$WORDS_IN_NAVIGATION_PANEL_TITLES</b> <b>=</b> <b>4;</b>
              Specifies how many words to use from section titles, within the textual hyperlinks which accompany
              the navigation buttons.

       <b>$WORDS_IN_PAGE</b> <b>=</b> <b>450;</b>
              Specifies  the minimum page length required before a navigation panel is placed at the bottom of a
              page, when the <u>$AUTO_NAVIGATION</u> variable is set.

       <b>$CHILDLINE</b> <b>=</b> <b>"&lt;BR&gt;&lt;HR&gt;\n";</b>
              This gives the <b>HTML</b> code to be placed between the child-links table and the ordinary  contents  of
              the page on which it occurs.

       <b>$NETSCAPE_HTML</b> <b>=</b> <b>0;</b>
              When  set,  this  variable  specifies  that <b>HTML</b> code may be present which does not conform to any
              official standard. This restricts the contents of any &lt;!DOCTYPE ... &gt; tag which may be  placed  at
              the beginning of the HTML pages produced.

       <b>$BODYTEXT</b> <b>=</b> <b>'';</b>
              The  value of this variable is used within the &lt;BODY ... &gt; tag; e.g. to set text and/or background
              colors.  It's value is overridden by the \bodytext command, and can be added-to or  parts  changed
              using the \htmlbody command or \color and \pagecolor from the color package.

       <b>$INTERLACE</b> <b>=</b> <b>1;</b>
              When  set, interlaced images should be produced.  This requires graphics utilities to be available
              to perform the interlacing operation.

       <b>$TRANSPARENT_FIGURES</b> <b>=</b> <b>1;</b>
              When set, the background of images should be  made  transparent;  otherwise  it  is  white.   This
              requires graphics utilities to be available which can specify the color to be made transparent.

       <b>$FIGURE_SCALE_FACTOR</b> <b>=</b> <b>1;</b>
              Scale  factor  applied  to  all  images  of figure and other environments, when being made into an
              image.  Note that this does not apply to recognised mathematics environments,  which  instead  use
              the contents of <u>$MATH_SCALE_FACTOR</u> and $DISP_SCALE_FACTOR to specify scaling.

       <b>$MATH_SCALE_FACTOR</b> <b>=</b> <b>1;</b>
              Scale  factor applied to all images of mathematics, both inline and displayed. A value of 1.4 is a
              good alternative, with anti-aliased images.

       <b>$DISP_SCALE_FACTOR</b> <b>=</b> <b>1;</b>
              Extra scale factor applied to images  of  displayed  math  environments.   When  set,  this  value
              multiplies  <u>$MATH_SCALE_FACTOR</u>  to  give  the  total scaling. A value of `1.2' is a good choice to
              accompany $MATH_SCALE_FACTOR = 1.4;.

       <b>$EXTRA_IMAGE_SCALE</b>
              This may hold an extra scale factor that can be applied to all generated  images.   When  set,  it
              specifies  that  a  scaling  of <u>$EXTRA_IMAGE_SCALE</u> be applied when images are created, but to have
              their height and width recorded as the un-scaled size. This is to coax browsers into  scaling  the
              (usually  larger)  images  to fit the desired size; when printed a better quality can be obtained.
              Values of `1.5' and `2' give good print quality at 600dpi.

       <b>$PAPERSIZE</b> <b>=</b> <b>'a5';</b>
              Specifies the size of a page for typesetting figures or displayed math, when an  image  is  to  be
              generated.   This  affects  the  lengths  of  lines of text within images. Since images of text or
              mathematics should use larger sizes than when printed, else clarity is lost at screen resolutions,
              then  a  smaller  paper-size  is  generally  advisable.  This  is  especially  so  if   both   the
              $MATH_SCALE_FACTOR  and  <u>$DISP_SCALE_FACTOR</u>  scaling  factors are being used, else some images may
              become excessively large, including a lot of blank space.

       <b>$LINE_WIDTH</b> <b>=</b> <b>500;</b>
              Formerly specified the width of an image, when the contents were to be right- or center-justified.
              (No longer used.)

       The following variables are used to access the  utilities  required  during  image-generation.  File  and
       program  locations  on  the  local system are established by the configure-pstoimg <b>Perl</b> script and stored
       within <u>$LATEX2HTMLDIR/local.pm</u> as <b>Perl</b> code, to be read by pstoimg  when  required.   After  running  the
       configure-pstoimg  Perl script it should not be necessary to alter the values obtained. Those shown below
       are what happens on the author's system; they are for illustration only  and  do  not  represent  default
       values.

        $GS_LIB = '/usr/local/share/ghostscript/4.02';
        $PNMCAT = '/usr/local/bin/pnmcat';
        $PNMQUANT = '/usr/local/bin/pnmquant';
        $PNMFLIP = '/usr/local/bin/pnmflip';
        $PPMTOGIF = '/usr/local/bin/ppmtogif';
        $HOWTO_TRANSPARENT_GIF = 'netpbm';
        $GS_DEVICE = 'pnmraw';
        $GS = '/usr/local/bin/gs';
        $PNMFILE = '/usr/local/bin/pnmfile';
        $HOWTO_INTERLACE_GIF = 'netpbm';
        $PBMMAKE = '/usr/local/bin/pbmmake';
        $PNMCROP = '/usr/local/bin/pnmcrop';
        $TMP  =  '/usr/var/tmp';  The following variables are no longer needed, having been replaced by the more
       specific information obtained using the Perl script configure-pstoimg.
        $USENETPBM = 1;
        $PBMPLUSDIR = '<a href="file:/usr/local/bin">/usr/local/bin</a>';
