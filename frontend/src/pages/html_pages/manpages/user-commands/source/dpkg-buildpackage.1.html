</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       dpkg-buildpackage - build binary or source packages from sources

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>dpkg-buildpackage</b> [<u>option</u>...] [<b>--</b>] [<u>filename</u>.dsc|<u>directory</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>dpkg-buildpackage</b> is a program that automates the process of building a Debian package.

       The <u>filename</u>.dsc and <u>directory</u> arguments are supported since dpkg 1.22.7.  Their semantics are
       experimental.

       It consists of the following steps:

       <b>1.</b>  It  runs  the  <b>preinit</b>  hook  before  reading  any source file.  If a <b>.dsc</b> file has been specified it
           unpacks it anew and changes directory to it, if a <u>directory</u> has been specified it  changes  directory
           to  it, otherwise it expects the current directory to contain the source tree.  It prepares the build
           environment by setting various environment variables (see <b>ENVIRONMENT</b>), runs the <b>init</b> hook, and calls
           <b>dpkg-source</b> <b>--before-build</b> (unless <b>-T</b> or <b>--target</b> has been used).

       <b>2.</b>  It  checks  that  the  build-dependencies  and  build-conflicts   are   satisfied   (unless   <b>-d</b>   or
           <b>--no-check-builddeps</b> is specified).

       <b>3.</b>  If  one  or  more  specific targets have been selected with the <b>-T</b> or <b>--target</b> option, it calls those
           targets and stops here.  Otherwise it runs the <b>preclean</b> hook and calls <b>fakeroot</b> <b>debian/rules</b> <b>clean</b> to
           clean the build-tree (unless <b>-nc</b> or <b>--no-pre-clean</b> is specified).

       <b>4.</b>  It runs the <b>source</b> hook and calls <b>dpkg-source</b> <b>-b</b> to generate the source package (if  a  <b>source</b>  build
           has been requested with <b>--build</b> or equivalent options, and if no <b>.dsc</b> has been specified).

       <b>5.</b>  It  runs  the  <b>build</b>  hook and calls <b>debian/rules</b> <u>build-target</u>, then runs the <b>binary</b> hook followed by
           <b>fakeroot</b>  <b>debian/rules</b>  <u>binary-target</u>  (unless  a  source-only  build   has   been   requested   with
           <b>--build=source</b> or equivalent options).  Note that <u>build-target</u> and <u>binary-target</u> are either <b>build</b> and
           <b>binary</b>  (default  case,  or  if  an  <b>any</b>  and <b>all</b> build has been requested with <b>--build</b> or equivalent
           options), or <b>build-arch</b> and <b>binary-arch</b> (if an <b>any</b> and not <b>all</b> build has been requested with  <b>--build</b>
           or  equivalent  options),  or  <b>build-indep</b>  and  <b>binary-indep</b>  (if  an <b>all</b> and not <b>any</b> build has been
           requested with <b>--build</b> or equivalent options).

       <b>6.</b>  It runs the <b>buildinfo</b> hook and calls <b>dpkg-genbuildinfo</b> to generate a <b>.buildinfo</b> file.  Several  <b>dpkg-</b>
           <b>buildpackage</b>  options are forwarded to <b>dpkg-genbuildinfo</b>.  If a <u>.dsc</u> has been specified, then it will
           be referenced in the generated <b>.buildinfo</b> file, as we can ascertain  the  provenance  of  the  source
           tree.

       <b>7.</b>  It  runs  the  <b>changes</b>  hook  and calls <b>dpkg-genchanges</b> to generate a <b>.changes</b> file.  The name of the
           <b>.changes</b> file will depend on the type of build and will be as specific as necessary but not more; the
           name will be:

           <u>source-name_binary-version_arch</u><b>.changes</b>
               for a build that includes <b>any</b>

           <u>source-name_binary-version</u><b>_all.changes</b>
               otherwise for a build that includes <b>all</b>

           <u>source-name_source-version</u><b>_source.changes</b>.
               otherwise for a build that includes <b>source</b>

           Many <b>dpkg-buildpackage</b> options are forwarded to <b>dpkg-genchanges</b>.

       <b>8.</b>  It runs the <b>postclean</b>  hook  and  if  <b>-tc</b>  or  <b>--post-clean</b>  is  specified,  it  will  call  <b>fakeroot</b>
           <b>debian/rules</b> <b>clean</b> again.

       <b>9.</b>  It calls <b>dpkg-source</b> <b>--after-build</b>.

       <b>10.</b> It  runs  the <b>check</b> hook and calls a package checker for the <b>.changes</b> file (if a command is specified
           in <b>DEB_CHECK_COMMAND</b> or with <b>--check-command</b>).

       <b>11.</b> It runs the <b>sign</b> hook and signs using the OpenPGP backend (as long as it is not an UNRELEASED  build,
           or  <b>--no-sign</b>  is  specified)  to  sign  the  <b>.dsc</b>  file  (if any, unless <b>-us</b> or <b>--unsigned-source</b> is
           specified), the <b>.buildinfo</b> file (unless  <b>-ui</b>,  <b>--unsigned-buildinfo</b>,  <b>-uc</b>  or  <b>--unsigned-changes</b>  is
           specified) and the <b>.changes</b> file (unless <b>-uc</b> or <b>--unsigned-changes</b> is specified).

       <b>12.</b> If a <b>.dsc</b> file has been specified, it removes the extracted source directory.

       <b>13.</b> It runs the <b>done</b> hook.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       All  long  options can be specified both on the command line and in the <b>dpkg-buildpackage</b> system and user
       configuration files.  Each line in the configuration file is either an option (exactly the  same  as  the
       command line option but without leading hyphens) or a comment (if it starts with a ‘<b>#</b>’).

       <b>--build=</b><u>type</u>
           Specifies  the  build  <u>type</u>  from  a comma-separated list of components (since dpkg 1.18.5).  All the
           specified components get combined to select the single build type to  use,  which  implies  a  single
           build run with a single <u>.changes</u> file generated.  Passed to <b>dpkg-genchanges</b>.

           The allowed values are:

           <b>source</b>
               Builds the source package.

               <b>Note</b>:  When  using  this value standalone and if what you want is simply to (re-)build the source
               package from a clean source tree, using <b>dpkg-source</b> directly is always a better option as it does
               not require any build dependencies to be installed which are otherwise needed to be able to  call
               the <b>clean</b> target.

           <b>any</b> Builds the architecture specific binary packages.

           <b>all</b> Builds the architecture independent binary packages.

           <b>binary</b>
               Builds the architecture specific and independent binary packages.  This is an alias for <b>any,all</b>.

           <b>full</b>
               Builds everything.  This is an alias for <b>source,any,all</b>, and the same as the default case when no
               build option is specified.

       <b>-g</b>  Equivalent to <b>--build=source,all</b> (since dpkg 1.17.11).

       <b>-G</b>  Equivalent to <b>--build=source,any</b> (since dpkg 1.17.11).

       <b>-b</b>  Equivalent to <b>--build=binary</b> or <b>--build=any,all</b>.

       <b>-B</b>  Equivalent to <b>--build=any</b>.

       <b>-A</b>  Equivalent to <b>--build=all</b>.

       <b>-S</b>  Equivalent to <b>--build=source</b>.

       <b>-F</b>  Equivalent to <b>--build=full</b>, <b>--build=source,binary</b> or <b>--build=source,any,all</b> (since dpkg 1.15.8).

       <b>--target=</b><u>target</u>[,...]
       <b>--target</b> <u>target</u>[,...]
       <b>-T</b>, <b>--rules-target=</b><u>target</u>[,...]
           Calls <b>debian/rules</b> <u>target</u> once per target specified, after having setup the build environment (except
           for calling <b>dpkg-source</b> <b>--before-build</b>), and stops the package build process here (since dpkg 1.15.0,
           long option since dpkg 1.18.8, multi-target support since dpkg 1.18.16).  If <b>--as-root</b> is also given,
           then the command is executed as root (see <b>--root-command</b>).  Note that known targets that are required
           to  be  run  as  root  do  not need this option (i.e. the <b>clean</b>, <b>binary</b>, <b>binary-arch</b> and <b>binary-indep</b>
           targets).

       <b>--as-root</b>
           Only meaningful together with <b>--target</b> (since dpkg 1.15.0).  Requires that the  target  be  run  with
           root rights.

       <b>-si</b>
       <b>-sa</b>
       <b>-sd</b>
       <b>-v</b><u>version</u>
       <b>-C</b><u>changes-description</u>
       <b>-m</b><u>maintainer-address</u>
       <b>-e</b><u>maintainer-address</u>
           Passed unchanged to <b>dpkg-genchanges</b>.  See its manual page.

       <b>--build-by=</b><u>maintainer-address</u>
       <b>--source-by=</b><u>maintainer-address</u> (since dpkg 1.21.10)
           Pass as <b>-m</b> to <b>dpkg-genchanges</b>.  See its manual page.

       <b>--release-by=</b><u>maintainer-address</u>
       <b>--changed-by=</b><u>maintainer-address</u> (since dpkg 1.21.10)
           Pass as <b>-e</b> to <b>dpkg-genchanges</b>.  See its manual page.

       <b>-a</b>, <b>--host-arch</b> <u>architecture</u>
           Specify  the  Debian architecture we build for (long option since dpkg 1.17.17).  The architecture of
           the machine we build on is determined automatically, and is also the default for the host machine.

       <b>-t</b>, <b>--host-type</b> <u>gnu-system-type</u>
           Specify the GNU system type we build for (long option since dpkg 1.17.17).  It can be used  in  place
           of  <b>--host-arch</b>  or  as  a  complement  to  override  the  default GNU system type of the host Debian
           architecture.

       <b>--target-arch</b> <u>architecture</u>
           Specify the Debian architecture the binaries built will build for (since dpkg 1.17.17).  The  default
           value is the host machine.

       <b>--target-type</b> <u>gnu-system-type</u>
           Specify  the  GNU system type the binaries built will build for (since dpkg 1.17.17).  It can be used
           in place of <b>--target-arch</b> or as a complement to override the default GNU system type  of  the  target
           Debian architecture.

       <b>-P</b>, <b>--build-profiles=</b><u>profile</u>[<b>,</b>...]
           Specify the profile(s) we build, as a comma-separated list (since dpkg 1.17.2, long option since dpkg
           1.18.8).   The  default  behavior  is  to  build for no specific profile.  Also sets them (as a space
           separated  list)  as  the  <b>DEB_BUILD_PROFILES</b>  environment  variable  which  allows,   for   example,
           <b>debian/rules</b> files to use this information for conditional builds.

       <b>-j</b>, <b>--jobs</b>[=<u>jobs</u>|<b>auto</b>]
           Specifies  the  number of jobs allowed to be run simultaneously (since dpkg 1.14.7, long option since
           dpkg 1.18.8).  The number of jobs matching the number of  online  processors  if  <b>auto</b>  is  specified
           (since  dpkg  1.17.10),  or  unlimited number if <u>jobs</u> is not specified.  The default behavior is <b>auto</b>
           (since dpkg 1.18.11) in non-forced mode (since dpkg 1.21.10), and as such it is always safer  to  use
           with  any  package including those that are not parallel-build safe.  Setting the number of jobs to <b>1</b>
           will restore serial execution.

           Will add <b>parallel=</b><u>jobs</u> or  <b>parallel</b>  to  the  <b>DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS</b>  environment  variable  which  allows
           debian/rules  files  to  opt-in  to use this information for their own purposes.  The <u>jobs</u> value will
           override the <b>parallel=</b><u>jobs</u> or <b>parallel</b> option in the <b>DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS</b>  environment  variable.   Note
           that  the  <b>auto</b>  value  will get replaced by the actual number of currently active processors, and as
           such will not get propagated to any child process.  If the number  of  online  processors  cannot  be
           inferred  then  the  code will fallback to using serial execution (since dpkg 1.18.15), although this
           should only happen on exotic and unsupported systems.

       <b>-J</b>, <b>--jobs-try</b>[=<u>jobs</u>|<b>auto</b>]
           This option (since dpkg 1.18.2, long option since dpkg 1.18.8) is equivalent to the <b>-j</b> above.

           Since the behavior for <b>-j</b> changed in dpkg 1.21.10 to the opt-in mode, you can use this option instead
           if you need to guarantee semantics across dpkg release series.

       <b>--jobs-force</b>[=<u>jobs</u>|<b>auto</b>]
           This option (since dpkg 1.21.10) is equivalent to the <b>--jobs</b> option except that it will enable forced
           parallel mode, by adding the <b>make</b> <b>-j</b> option  with  the  computed  number  of  parallel  jobs  to  the
           <b>MAKEFLAGS</b> environment variable.

           This  should  cause  all subsequent make invocations to inherit the option, thus forcing the parallel
           setting on the packaging (and possibly the upstream build system if that uses <b><a href="../man1/make.1.html">make</a></b>(1)) regardless  of
           their support for parallel builds, which might cause build failures.

           <b>Note</b>:  Any  Makefile that is not parallel-safe should be considered to be buggy.  These should either
           be made parallel-safe, or marked as not being safe with the <b><a href="../man1/make.1.html">make</a></b>(1) <b>.NOTPARALLEL</b> target.

       <b>-D</b>, <b>--check-builddeps</b>
           Check build dependencies and conflicts; abort if unsatisfied (long option since dpkg  1.18.8).   This
           is the default behavior.

       <b>-d</b>, <b>--no-check-builddeps</b>
           Do not check build dependencies and conflicts (long option since dpkg 1.18.8).

       <b>--ignore-builtin-builddeps</b>
           Do  not  check  built-in  build  dependencies  and  conflicts  (since  dpkg  1.18.2).   These are the
           distribution specific implicit build dependencies usually required in a  build  environment,  the  so
           called Build-Essential package set.

       <b>--rules-requires-root</b>
           Do  not  honor the <b>Rules-Requires-Root</b> field, falling back to its legacy default value <b>binary-targets</b>
           (since dpkg 1.19.1).

       <b>-nc</b>, <b>--no-pre-clean</b>
           Do not clean the source tree before building (long option since dpkg 1.18.8).  Implies <b>-b</b> if  nothing
           else has been selected among <b>-F</b>, <b>-g</b>, <b>-G</b>, <b>-B</b>, <b>-A</b> or <b>-S</b>.  Implies <b>-d</b> with <b>-S</b> (since dpkg 1.18.0).

       <b>--pre-clean</b>
           Clean the source tree before building (since dpkg 1.18.8).  This is the default behavior.

       <b>-tc</b>, <b>--post-clean</b>
           Clean  the  source tree (using <u>gain-root-command</u> <b>debian/rules</b> <b>clean</b>) after the package has been built
           (long option since dpkg 1.18.8).

       <b>--no-post-clean</b>
           Do not clean the source tree after the package has been built  (since  dpkg  1.19.1).   This  is  the
           default behavior.

       <b>--sanitize-env</b>
           Sanitize the build environment (since dpkg 1.20.0).  This will reset or remove environment variables,
           umask,  and any other process attributes that might otherwise adversely affect the build of packages.
           Because the official entry point to build packages is <b>debian/rules</b>, packages  cannot  rely  on  these
           settings  being  in  place,  and thus should work even when they are not.  What to sanitize is vendor
           specific.

       <b>-r</b>, <b>--root-command=</b><u>gain-root-command</u>
           When <b>dpkg-buildpackage</b> needs to execute part of the build process as root, it prefixes the command it
           executes with  <u>gain-root-command</u>  if  one  has  been  specified  (long  option  since  dpkg  1.18.8).
           Otherwise,  if  none has been specified, <b>fakeroot</b> will be used by default, if the command is present.
           <u>gain-root-command</u> should start with the name of a program on the <b>PATH</b> and will get as  arguments  the
           name  of  the  real  command  to run and the arguments it should take.  <u>gain-root-command</u> can include
           parameters (they must be space-separated)  but  no  shell  metacharacters.   <u>gain-root-command</u>  might
           typically  be  <b>fakeroot</b>,  <b>sudo</b>,  <b>super</b>  or  <b>really</b>.  <b>su</b> is not suitable, since it can only invoke the
           user's shell with <b>-c</b> instead of passing arguments individually to the command to be run.

       <b>-R</b>, <b>--rules-file=</b><u>rules-file</u>
           Building a Debian package usually involves invoking <b>debian/rules</b> as a command with  several  standard
           parameters  (since  dpkg  1.14.17, long option since dpkg 1.18.8).  With this option it's possible to
           use another program invocation to build the package (it  can  include  space  separated  parameters).
           Alternatively  it  can  be  used  to  execute  the standard rules file with another make program (for
           example by using <b>/usr/local/bin/make</b> <b>-f</b> <b>debian/rules</b> as <u>rules-file</u>).

       <b>--check-command=</b><u>check-command</u>
           Command used to check the <b>.changes</b> file itself and any artifact built referenced in the  file  (since
           dpkg  1.17.6).   The  command  should  take  the <b>.changes</b> pathname as an argument.  This command will
           usually be <b>lintian</b>.

       <b>--check-option=</b><u>opt</u>
           Pass option <u>opt</u> to the <u>check-command</u> specified with <b>DEB_CHECK_COMMAND</b> or <b>--check-command</b> (since  dpkg
           1.17.6).  Can be used multiple times.

       <b>--hook-</b><u>hook-name</u><b>=</b><u>hook-command</u>
           Set  the  specified  shell  code  <u>hook-command</u>  as  the  hook  <u>hook-name</u>, which will run at the times
           specified in the run steps (since dpkg 1.17.6).  The hooks  will  always  be  executed  even  if  the
           following  action  is  not  performed  (except  for  the <b>binary</b> hook).  All the hooks will run in the
           unpacked source directory.

           Some hooks can receive addition information through environment variables (since dpkg  1.22.0).   All
           hooks get the hook name in the <b>DPKG_BUILDPACKAGE_HOOK_NAME</b> environment variable (since dpkg 1.22.0).

           <b>Note</b>:  Hooks  can affect the build process, and cause build failures if their commands fail, so watch
           out for unintended consequences.

           The current <u>hook-name</u> supported are:

           <b>preinit</b>
           <b>init</b>
           <b>preclean</b>
           <b>source</b>
               Gets <b>DPKG_BUILDPACKAGE_HOOK_SOURCE_OPTIONS</b> with the space-separated lists of  options  that  will
               passed to the <b>dpkg-source</b> call.

           <b>build</b>
               Gets  <b>DPKG_BUILDPACKAGE_HOOK_BUILD_TARGET</b>  with the name of the <b>debian/rules</b> build target called.
               Before dpkg 1.22.7 the variable was only set if the target was called.

           <b>binary</b>
               Gets <b>DPKG_BUILDPACKAGE_HOOK_BINARY_TARGET</b> with the name of the <b>debian/rules</b> binary target called,
               but only if called.

           <b>buildinfo</b>
               Gets <b>DPKG_BUILDPACKAGE_HOOK_BUILDINFO_OPTIONS</b> with the space-separated lists of options that will
               passed to the <b>dpkg-genbuildinfo</b> call.

           <b>changes</b>
               Gets <b>DPKG_BUILDPACKAGE_HOOK_CHANGES_OPTIONS</b> with the space-separated lists of options  that  will
               passed to the <b>dpkg-genchanges</b> call.

           <b>postclean</b>
           <b>check</b>
               Gets  <b>DPKG_BUILDPACKAGE_HOOK_CHECK_OPTIONS</b>  with  the  space-separated lists of options that will
               passed to the check command call.

           <b>done</b>

           The <u>hook-command</u> supports the following substitution format string, which  will  get  applied  to  it
           before execution:

           <b>%%</b>  A single % character.

           <b>%a</b>  A boolean value (0 or 1), representing whether the following action is being performed.

           <b>%p</b>  The source package name.

           <b>%v</b>  The source package version.

           <b>%s</b>  The source package version (without the epoch).

           <b>%u</b>  The upstream version.

       <b>--buildinfo-file=</b><u>filename</u>
           Set the <u>filename</u> for the generated <b>.buildinfo</b> file (since dpkg 1.21.0).

       <b>--buildinfo-option=</b><u>opt</u>
           Pass option <u>opt</u> to <b>dpkg-genbuildinfo</b> (since dpkg 1.18.11).  Can be used multiple times.

       <b>--sign-backend=</b><u>sign-backend</u>
           Specify an OpenPGP backend interface to use when invoking the <u>sign-command</u> (since dpkg 1.21.10).

           The  default  is  <b>auto</b>,  where the best current backend available will be used.  The specific OpenPGP
           backends supported in order of preference are:

           <b>sop</b> (any conforming Stateless OpenPGP implementation)

           <b>sq</b>  (from Sequoia-PGP)

           <b>gpg</b> (from GnuPG)

       <b>-p</b>, <b>--sign-command=</b><u>sign-command</u>
           When <b>dpkg-buildpackage</b> needs to execute an OpenPGP backend command to sign a  source  control  (<b>.dsc</b>)
           file, a <b>.buildinfo</b> file or a <b>.changes</b> file it will run <u>sign-command</u> (searching the <b>PATH</b> if necessary)
           instead  of  the  default  or  auto-detected  backend command (long option since dpkg 1.18.8).  <u>sign-</u>
           <u>command</u> will get all the backend specific arguments according to the <b>--sign-backend</b> selected.   <u>sign-</u>
           <u>command</u> should not contain spaces or any other shell metacharacters.

       <b>-k</b>, <b>--sign-keyid=</b><u>key-id</u>
       <b>--sign-key=</b><u>key-id</u>
           Specify  an OpenPGP key-ID (either a fingerprint or a user-ID) for the secret key to use when signing
           packages (<b>--sign-key</b> since dpkg 1.18.8, <b>--sign-keyid</b> since dpkg 1.21.10).

       <b>--sign-keyfile=</b><u>key-file</u>
           Specify an OpenPGP <u>key-file</u> containing the secret key  to  use  when  signing  packages  (since  dpkg
           1.21.10).

           <b>Note</b>: For security reasons the <u>key-file</u> is best kept locked with a password.

       <b>-us</b>, <b>--unsigned-source</b>
           Do not sign the source package (long option since dpkg 1.18.8).

       <b>-ui</b>, <b>--unsigned-buildinfo</b>

       <b>-uc</b>, <b>--unsigned-changes</b>
           Do not sign the <b>.buildinfo</b> and <b>.changes</b> files (long option since dpkg 1.18.8).

       <b>--no-sign</b>
           Do  not  sign  any  file, this includes the source package, the <b>.buildinfo</b> file and the <b>.changes</b> file
           (since dpkg 1.18.20).

       <b>--force-sign</b>
           Force the signing of the resulting files (since dpkg 1.17.0), regardless of  <b>-us</b>,  <b>--unsigned-source</b>,
           <b>-ui</b>, <b>--unsigned-buildinfo</b>, <b>-uc</b>, <b>--unsigned-changes</b> or other internal heuristics.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
   <b>External</b> <b>environment</b>
       <b>DEB_CHECK_COMMAND</b>
           If set, it will be used as the command to check the <b>.changes</b> file (since dpkg 1.17.6).  Overridden by
           the <b>--check-command</b> option.

       <b>DEB_SIGN_KEYID</b>
           If  set,  it  will  be  used  to  sign  the  <b>.changes</b>, <b>.buildinfo</b> and <b>.dsc</b> files (since dpkg 1.17.2).
           Overridden by the <b>--sign-keyid</b> option.

       <b>DEB_SIGN_KEYFILE</b>
           If set, it will be used to sign the  <b>.changes</b>,  <b>.buildinfo</b>  and  <b>.dsc</b>  files  (since  dpkg  1.21.10).
           Overridden by the <b>--sign-keyfile</b> option.

       <b>DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS</b>
           If set, it will contain a space-separated list of options that affect the behavior of some dpkg tools
           involved  in package building, and might affect the package build process if the code in <u>debian/rules</u>
           honors them.  These options can have parameters specified immediately after an equal sign (‘<b>=</b>‘).  For
           options that support multiple parameters, these will  not  be  separated  by  spaces,  as  these  are
           reserved to separate options.

           The  following  are  the  options  known  and  supported  by  dpkg  tools,  other  options honored by
           <u>debian/rules</u> might be defined by distribution specific policies.

           <b>parallel=</b><u>N</u>
               The <u>debian/rules</u> in the packaging might use this option to set up the  build  process  to  use  <u>N</u>
               parallel jobs.  It is overridden by the <b>--jobs</b> and <b>--jobs-force</b> options.

           <b>nocheck</b>
               <b>dpkg-buildpackage</b>  will ignore the <b>DEB_CHECK_COMMAND</b> variable.  The <u>debian/rules</u> in the packaging
               is not expected to run test suites during the build.

           <b>noopt</b>
               If <u>debian/rules</u> calls <b>dpkg-buildflags</b> to set up the build flags, those will be set to not  enable
               any optimizations.

           <b>nostrip</b>
               The <u>debian/rules</u> in the packaging should ensure that objects do not get the debugging information
               stripped.   If  <u>debian/rules</u>  includes the <b>mk/buildtools.mk</b> make fragment the <b>STRIP</b> make variable
               will respect this option.

           <b>terse</b>
               <b>dpkg-buildpackage</b> will append the <b>--no-print-directory</b> <b><a href="../man1/make.1.html">make</a></b>(1) flag to the <b>MAKEFLAGS</b>  environment
               variable.   The <u>debian/rules</u> in the packaging should reduce verbosity, while not being completely
               quiet.

           <b>hardening=</b><u>feature-spec</u>
           <b>reproducible=</b><u>feature-spec</u>
           <b>abi=</b><u>feature-spec</u>
           <b>future=</b><u>feature-spec</u>
           <b>qa=</b><u>feature-spec</u>
           <b>optimize=</b><u>feature-spec</u>
           <b>sanitize=</b><u>feature-spec</u>
               These are feature areas that control build flag features.   See  <b><a href="../man1/dpkg-buildflags.1.html">dpkg-buildflags</a></b>(1)  for  further
               details.

       <b>DEB_BUILD_PROFILES</b>
           If  set,  it  will  be  used  as  the active build profile(s) for the package being built (since dpkg
           1.17.2).  It is a space separated list of profile names.  Overridden by the <b>-P</b> option.

       <b>DPKG_COLORS</b>
           Sets the color mode (since dpkg 1.18.5).  The currently accepted values are: <b>auto</b>  (default),  <b>always</b>
           and <b>never</b>.

       <b>DPKG_NLS</b>
           If  set,  it  will  be  used  to  decide  whether  to activate Native Language Support, also known as
           internationalization (or i18n) support (since dpkg  1.19.0).   The  accepted  values  are:  <b>0</b>  and  <b>1</b>
           (default).

   <b>Internal</b> <b>environment</b>
       Even  if  <b>dpkg-buildpackage</b>  exports  some  variables, <b>debian/rules</b> should not rely on their presence and
       should instead use the respective interface to retrieve the needed values, because that file is the  main
       entry point to build packages and running it standalone should be supported.

       <b>DEB_BUILD_*</b>
       <b>DEB_HOST_*</b>
       <b>DEB_TARGET_*</b>
           <b>dpkg-architecture</b>  is called with the <b>-a</b> and <b>-t</b> parameters forwarded.  Any variable that is output by
           its <b>-s</b> option is integrated in the build environment.

       <b>DEB_RULES_REQUIRES_ROOT</b>
           This variable is set to the value obtained from the  <b>Rules-Requires-Root</b>  field,  the  dpkg-build-api
           level  or  from  the  command-line.   When  set, it will be a valid value for the <b>Rules-Requires-Root</b>
           field.  It is used to notify <b>debian/rules</b> whether the <b>rootless-builds.txt</b> specification is supported.

       <b>DEB_GAIN_ROOT_CMD</b>
           This variable is set to <u>gain-root-command</u> when the  field  <b>Rules-Requires-Root</b>  is  set  to  a  value
           different to <b>no</b> and <b>binary-targets</b>.

       <b>SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH</b>
           This  variable  is set to the Unix timestamp since the epoch of the latest entry in <u>debian/changelog</u>,
           if it is not already defined.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <u>/etc/dpkg/buildpackage.conf</u>
           System wide configuration file

       <u>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/dpkg/buildpackage.conf</u> or
       <u>$HOME/.config/dpkg/buildpackage.conf</u>
           User configuration file.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Compiler</b> <b>flags</b> <b>are</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>exported</b>
       Between dpkg 1.14.17 and 1.16.1, <b>dpkg-buildpackage</b> exported compiler  flags  (<b>CFLAGS</b>,  <b>CXXFLAGS</b>,  <b>FFLAGS</b>,
       <b>CPPFLAGS</b> and <b>LDFLAGS</b>) with values as returned by <b>dpkg-buildflags</b>.  This is no longer the case.

   <b>Default</b> <b>build</b> <b>targets</b>
       <b>dpkg-buildpackage</b> is using the <b>build-arch</b> and <b>build-indep</b> targets since dpkg 1.16.2.  Before dpkg 1.22.7,
       there  was code to try to detect the missing targets and fallback on the <b>build</b> target.  Those targets are
       thus mandatory.

</pre><h4><b>SECURITY</b></h4><pre>
       Building binary or source packages should only be performed over trusted source data.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       It should be possible to specify spaces and shell metacharacters and  initial  arguments  for  <u>gain-root-</u>
       <u>command</u> and <u>sign-command</u>.
