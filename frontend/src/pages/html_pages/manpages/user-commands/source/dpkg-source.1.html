</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       dpkg-source - Debian source package (.dsc) manipulation tool

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>dpkg-source</b> [<u>option</u>...] <u>command</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>dpkg-source</b> packs and unpacks Debian source archives.

       None of these commands allow multiple options to be combined into one, and they do not allow the value
       for an option to be specified in a separate argument.

</pre><h4><b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-x</b>, <b>--extract</b> <u>filename</u>.dsc [<u>output-directory</u>]
           Extract  a  source package (<b>--extract</b> since dpkg 1.17.14).  One non-option argument must be supplied,
           the name of the Debian source control file (<b>.dsc</b>).  An optional second  non-option  argument  may  be
           supplied  to  specify  the  directory  to  extract the source package to, this must not exist.  If no
           output directory is specified, the source package is extracted into a directory named  <u>source</u>-<u>version</u>
           under the current working directory.

           <b>dpkg-source</b>  will  read  the names of the other file(s) making up the source package from the control
           file; they are assumed to be in the same directory as the <b>.dsc</b>.

           The files in the extracted package will have their permissions and  ownerships  set  to  those  which
           would  have  been  expected  if  the  files and directories had simply been created - directories and
           executable files will be 0777 and plain files will be 0666, both modified by the  extractors'  umask;
           if  the  parent directory is setgid then the extracted directories will be too, and all the files and
           directories will inherit its group ownership.

           If the source package uses a non-standard format (currently this means all formats except “1.0”), its
           name will be stored in <b>debian/source/format</b> so that the following builds of the  source  package  use
           the same format by default.

       <b>-b</b>, <b>--build</b> <u>directory</u> [<u>format-specific-parameters</u>]
           Build  a  source package (<b>--build</b> since dpkg 1.17.14).  The first non-option argument is taken as the
           name of the directory containing the debianized source tree (i.e. with  a  debian  sub-directory  and
           maybe  changes  to  the  original  files).   Depending on the source package format used to build the
           package, additional parameters might be accepted.

           <b>dpkg-source</b> will build the source package with the first format  found  in  this  ordered  list:  the
           format indicated with the <u>--format</u> command line option, the format indicated in <b>debian/source/format</b>,
           “1.0”.   The  fallback  to  “1.0”  is deprecated and will be removed at some point in the future, you
           should always document the desired  source  format  in  <b>debian/source/format</b>.   See  section  "SOURCE
           PACKAGE FORMATS" for an extensive description of the various source package formats.

       <b>--print-format</b> <u>directory</u>
           Print  the  source  format  that  would  be  used  to build the source package if <b>dpkg-source</b> <b>--build</b>
           <u>directory</u> was called (in the same conditions and with the same parameters; since dpkg 1.15.5).

       <b>--before-build</b> <u>directory</u>
           Run the corresponding hook of the source package format (since dpkg 1.15.8).   This  hook  is  called
           before  any  build  of  the  package  (<b>dpkg-buildpackage</b> calls it very early even before <b>debian/rules</b>
           <b>clean</b>).  This command is idempotent and can  be  called  multiple  times.   Not  all  source  formats
           implement something in this hook, and those that do usually prepare the source tree for the build for
           example by ensuring that the Debian patches are applied.

       <b>--after-build</b> <u>directory</u>
           Run  the  corresponding  hook  of the source package format (since dpkg 1.15.8).  This hook is called
           after any build of the package (<b>dpkg-buildpackage</b> calls it last).  This command is idempotent and can
           be called multiple times.  Not all source formats implement something in this hook, and those that do
           usually use it to undo what <b>--before-build</b> has done.

       <b>--commit</b> [<u>directory</u>] ...
           Record changes in the source tree unpacked in <u>directory</u> (since dpkg 1.16.1).  This command  can  take
           supplementary  parameters  depending  on the source format.  It will error out for formats where this
           operation doesn't mean anything.

       <b>-?</b>, <b>--help</b>
           Show the usage message and exit.  The format specific build and extract options can be shown by using
           the <b>--format</b> option.

       <b>--version</b>
           Show the version and exit.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Generic</b> <b>build</b> <b>options</b>
       <b>-c</b><u>control-file</u>
           Specifies the main source control file to read information from.  The default is <b>debian/control</b>.   If
           given with relative pathname this is interpreted starting at the source tree's top level directory.

       <b>-l</b><u>changelog-file</u>
           Specifies  the  changelog  file to read information from.  The default is <b>debian/changelog</b>.  If given
           with relative pathname this is interpreted starting at the source tree's top level directory.

       <b>-F</b><u>changelog-format</u>
           Specifies the format of the changelog.  See <b><a href="../man1/dpkg-parsechangelog.1.html">dpkg-parsechangelog</a></b>(1) for information about  alternative
           formats.

       <b>--format=</b><u>value</u>
           Use  the  given  format  for  building the source package (since dpkg 1.14.17).  It does override any
           format given in <b>debian/source/format</b>.

       <b>-V</b><u>name</u><b>=</b><u>value</u>
           Set an output substitution variable.  See <b><a href="../man5/deb-substvars.5.html">deb-substvars</a></b>(5) for a discussion of output substitution.

       <b>-T</b><u>substvars-file</u>
           Read substitution variables in <u>substvars-file</u>; the default is to not read any file.  This option  can
           be used multiple times to read substitution variables from multiple files (since dpkg 1.15.6).

       <b>-D</b><u>field</u><b>=</b><u>value</u>
           Override or add an output control file field.

       <b>-U</b><u>field</u>
           Remove an output control file field.

       <b>-Z</b><u>compression</u>, <b>--compression</b>=<u>compression</u>
           Specify the compression to use for created tarballs and diff files (<b>--compression</b> since dpkg 1.15.5).
           Note that this option will not cause existing tarballs to be recompressed, it only affects new files.
           Supported  values  are:  <u>gzip</u>,  <u>bzip2</u>, <u>lzma</u> and <u>xz</u>.  The default is <u>xz</u> for formats 2.0 and newer, and
           <u>gzip</u> for format 1.0.  <u>xz</u> is only supported since dpkg 1.15.5.

       <b>-z</b><u>level</u>, <b>--compression-level</b>=<u>level</u>
           Compression level to use (<b>--compression-level</b> since dpkg 1.15.5).  As with <b>-Z</b> it only  affects  newly
           created files.  Supported values are: <u>1</u> to <u>9</u>, <u>best</u>, and <u>fast</u>.  The default is <u>9</u> for gzip and bzip2, <u>6</u>
           for xz and lzma.

       <b>-i</b>[<u>regex</u>], <b>--diff-ignore</b>[=<u>regex</u>]
           You  may  specify a perl regular expression to match files you want filtered out of the list of files
           for the diff (<b>--diff-ignore</b> since dpkg 1.15.6).  (This list is generated by a find command.) (If  the
           source  package  is being built as a version 3 source package using a VCS, this can be used to ignore
           uncommitted changes on specific files.  Using -i.* will ignore all of them.)

           The <b>-i</b> option by itself enables this setting with a default regex (preserving any modification to the
           default regex done by a previous use of <b>--extend-diff-ignore</b>) that will filter out control files  and
           directories  of  the  most  common  revision control systems, backup and swap files and Libtool build
           output directories.  There can only be one active regex, of multiple <b>-i</b> options  only  the  last  one
           will take effect.

           This  is  very  helpful in cutting out extraneous files that get included in the diff, for example if
           you maintain your source in a revision control system and want to use a checkout to  build  a  source
           package  without  including  the  additional files and directories that it will usually contain (e.g.
           CVS/, .cvsignore, .svn/).  The default regex is already very exhaustive, but if you need  to  replace
           it, please note that by default it can match any part of a path, so if you want to match the begin of
           a  filename  or  only  full  filenames, you will need to provide the necessary anchors (e.g. ‘(^|/)’,
           ‘($|/)’) yourself.

       <b>--extend-diff-ignore</b>=<u>regex</u>
           The perl regular expression specified will extend the default value used  by  <b>--diff-ignore</b>  and  its
           current  value,  if  set (since dpkg 1.15.6).  It does this by concatenating “<b>|</b><u>regex</u>” to the existing
           value.  This option is convenient to use in  <b>debian/source/options</b>  to  exclude  some  auto-generated
           files from the automatic patch generation.

       <b>-I</b>[<u>file-pattern</u>], <b>--tar-ignore</b>[=<u>file-pattern</u>]
           If  this  option  is  specified,  the  pattern will be passed to <b><a href="../man1/tar.1.html">tar</a></b>(1)'s <b>--exclude</b> option when it is
           called to generate a .orig.tar or .tar file (<b>--tar-ignore</b> since dpkg  1.15.6).   For  example,  <b>-I</b>CVS
           will  make  tar skip over CVS directories when generating a .tar.gz file.  The option may be repeated
           multiple times to list multiple patterns to exclude.

           <b>-I</b> by itself adds default <b>--exclude</b> options that will filter out control files and directories of the
           most common revision control systems, backup and swap files and Libtool build output directories.

       <b>Note</b>: While they have similar purposes, <b>-i</b> and <b>-I</b> have very different syntax and semantics.  <b>-i</b> can  only
       be  specified  once  and  takes  a  perl  compatible regular expression which is matched against the full
       relative path of each file.  <b>-I</b> can specified multiple times and takes  a  filename  pattern  with  shell
       wildcards.   The  pattern  is  applied  to  the  full  relative  path  but  also to each part of the path
       individually.   The  exact  semantic  of  tar's   <b>--exclude</b>   option   is   somewhat   complicated,   see
       &lt;https://www.gnu.org/software/tar/manual/tar.html#wildcards&gt; for a full documentation.

       The default regex and patterns for both options can be seen in the output of the <b>--help</b> command.

   <b>Generic</b> <b>extract</b> <b>options</b>
       <b>--no-copy</b>
           Do not copy original tarballs near the extracted source package (since dpkg 1.14.17).

       <b>--no-check</b>
           Do not check signatures and checksums before unpacking (since dpkg 1.14.17).

       <b>--no-overwrite-dir</b>
           Do not overwrite the extraction directory if it already exists (since dpkg 1.18.8).

       <b>--require-valid-signature</b>
           Refuse  to  unpack the source package if it doesn't contain an OpenPGP signature that can be verified
           (since dpkg 1.15.0) either with the  user's  <u>trustedkeys.gpg</u>  keyring,  one  of  the  vendor-specific
           keyrings,   or   one   of   the  official  Debian  keyrings  (<u>/usr/share/keyrings/debian-keyring.gpg</u>,
           <u>/usr/share/keyrings/debian-nonupload.gpg</u> and <u>/usr/share/keyrings/debian-maintainers.gpg</u>).

       <b>--require-strong-checksums</b>
           Refuse to unpack the source package if it does not contain any strong checksums (since dpkg  1.18.7).
           Currently the only known checksum considered strong is <b>SHA-256</b>.

       <b>--ignore-bad-version</b>
           Turns the bad source package version check into a non-fatal warning (since dpkg 1.17.7).  This option
           should  only  be  necessary  when  extracting  ancient source packages with broken versions, just for
           backwards compatibility.

   <b>Generic</b> <b>general</b> <b>options</b>
       <b>--threads-max=</b><u>threads</u>
           Sets the maximum number of threads allowed for compressors  that  support  multi-threaded  operations
           (since dpkg 1.21.14).

       <b>-q</b>  Sets quiet mode to suppress warnings.

</pre><h4><b>SOURCE</b> <b>PACKAGE</b> <b>FORMATS</b></h4><pre>
       If  you  don't  know  what  source  format  to use, you should probably pick either “3.0 (quilt)” or “3.0
       (native)”.  See &lt;https://wiki.debian.org/Projects/DebSrc3.0&gt; for information on the deployment  of  those
       formats within Debian.

   <b>Format:</b> <b>1.0</b>
       A  source  package  in this format consists either of a <b>.orig.tar.gz</b> associated to a <b>.diff.gz</b> or a single
       <b>.tar.gz</b> (in that case the package is said to be  <u>native</u>).   Optionally  the  original  tarball  might  be
       accompanied by a detached upstream signature <b>.orig.tar.gz.asc</b>, extraction supported since dpkg 1.18.5.

       <b>Extracting</b>

       Extracting  a  native  package  is  a  simple  extraction  of the single tarball in the target directory.
       Extracting a non-native package is done by first unpacking the <b>.orig.tar.gz</b> and then applying  the  patch
       contained  in  the  <b>.diff.gz</b> file.  The timestamp of all patched files is reset to the extraction time of
       the source package (this avoids  timestamp  skews  leading  to  problems  when  autogenerated  files  are
       patched).   The  diff  can  create  new files (the whole debian directory is created that way) but cannot
       remove files (empty files will be left over) and cannot create or change symlinks.

       <b>Building</b>

       Building a native package is just creating a single tarball with the source directory.  Building  a  non-
       native  package involves extracting the original tarball in a separate “.orig” directory and regenerating
       the <b>.diff.gz</b> by comparing the source package <u>directory</u> with the .orig directory.

       <b>Build</b> <b>options</b> <b>(with</b> <b>--build):</b>

       If a second non-option argument is supplied it should be the name of the  original  source  directory  or
       tarfile  or  the  empty string if the package is a Debian-specific one and so has no debianization diffs.
       If no  second  argument  is  supplied  then  <b>dpkg-source</b>  will  look  for  the  original  source  tarfile
       <u>package_upstream-version</u><b>.orig.tar.gz</b> or the original source directory <u>directory</u><b>.orig</b> depending on the <b>-sX</b>
       arguments.

       <b>-sa</b>,  <b>-sp</b>, <b>-sk</b>, <b>-su</b> and <b>-sr</b> will not overwrite existing tarfiles or directories.  If this is desired then
       <b>-sA</b>, <b>-sP</b>, <b>-sK</b>, <b>-sU</b> and <b>-sR</b> should be used instead.

       <b>-sk</b> Specifies  to  expect  the   original   source   as   a   tarfile,   by   default   <u>package_upstream-</u>
           <u>version</u><b>.orig.tar.</b><u>extension</u>.   It will leave this original source in place as a tarfile, or copy it to
           the current directory if it isn't already there.  The tarball will be  unpacked  into  <u>directory</u><b>.orig</b>
           for the generation of the diff.

       <b>-sp</b> Like <b>-sk</b> but will remove the directory again afterwards.

       <b>-su</b> Specifies  that  the  original  source  is  expected  as  a  directory,  by default <u>package</u><b>-</b><u>upstream-</u>
           <u>version</u><b>.orig</b> and <b>dpkg-source</b> will create a new original source archive from it.

       <b>-sr</b> Like <b>-su</b> but will remove that directory after it has been used.

       <b>-ss</b> Specifies that the original source is available both as a directory and as  a  tarfile.   <b>dpkg-source</b>
           will  use  the directory to create the diff, but the tarfile to create the <b>.dsc</b>.  This option must be
           used with care - if the directory and tarfile do not match a bad source archive will be generated.

       <b>-sn</b> Specifies to not look for any original source, and to not generate a diff.  The second  argument,  if
           supplied,  must  be  the empty string.  This is used for Debian-specific packages which do not have a
           separate upstream source and therefore have no debianization diffs.

       <b>-sa</b> or <b>-sA</b>
           Specifies to look for the original source archive as a  tarfile  or  as  a  directory  -  the  second
           argument, if any, may be either, or the empty string (this is equivalent to using <b>-sn</b>).  If a tarfile
           is  found  it will unpack it to create the diff and remove it afterwards (this is equivalent to <b>-sp</b>);
           if a directory is found it will pack it to create the original source and remove it afterwards  (this
           is  equivalent  to  <b>-sr</b>);  if  neither  is found it will assume that the package has no debianization
           diffs, only a straightforward source archive (this is equivalent to <b>-sn</b>).  If  both  are  found  then
           <b>dpkg-source</b>  will  ignore  the directory, overwriting it, if <b>-sA</b> was specified (this is equivalent to
           <b>-sP</b>) or raise an error if <b>-sa</b> was specified.  <b>-sa</b> is the default.

       <b>--abort-on-upstream-changes</b>
           The process fails if the generated diff contains changes to files outside of the debian sub-directory
           (since dpkg 1.15.8).  This option is  not  allowed  in  <b>debian/source/options</b>  but  can  be  used  in
           <b>debian/source/local-options</b>.

       <b>Extract</b> <b>options</b> <b>(with</b> <b>--extract):</b>

       In all cases any existing original source tree will be removed.

       <b>-sp</b> Used  when  extracting  then  the  original  source (if any) will be left as a tarfile.  If it is not
           already located in the current directory or if an existing but different file is  there  it  will  be
           copied there.  (<b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>default</b>).

       <b>-su</b> Unpacks the original source tree.

       <b>-sn</b> Ensures  that  the  original  source  is  neither  copied to the current directory nor unpacked.  Any
           original source tree that was in the current directory is still removed.

       All the <b>-s</b><u>X</u> options are mutually exclusive.  If you specify more than one only the last one will be used.

       <b>--skip-debianization</b>
           Skips application of the debian diff on top of the upstream sources (since dpkg 1.15.1).

   <b>Format:</b> <b>2.0</b>
       Extraction supported since dpkg 1.13.9, building supported since dpkg 1.14.8.   Also  known  as  wig&amp;pen.
       This  format is not recommended for wide-spread usage, the format “3.0 (quilt)” replaces it.  Wig&amp;pen was
       the first specification of a new-generation source package format.

       The behavior of this format is the same as the “3.0  (quilt)”  format  except  that  it  doesn't  use  an
       explicit  list of patches.  All files in <b>debian/patches/</b> matching the perl regular expression <b>[\w-]+</b> must
       be valid patches: they are applied at extraction time.

       When building a new source package, any change to  the  upstream  source  is  stored  in  a  patch  named
       <b>zz_debian-diff-auto</b>.

   <b>Format:</b> <b>3.0</b> <b>(native)</b>
       Supported since dpkg 1.14.17.  This format is an extension of the native package format as defined in the
       1.0  format.   It  supports all compression methods and will ignore by default any VCS specific files and
       directories as well as many temporary files (see default value associated to  <b>-I</b>  option  in  the  <b>--help</b>
       output).

   <b>Format:</b> <b>3.0</b> <b>(quilt)</b>
       Supported  since  dpkg  1.14.17.   A  source package in this format contains at least an original tarball
       (<b>.orig.tar.</b><u>ext</u> where <u>ext</u> can be <b>gz</b>, <b>bz2</b>, <b>lzma</b> and <b>xz</b>) and a debian  tarball  (<b>.debian.tar.</b><u>ext</u>).   It  can
       also  contain  additional  original  tarballs  (<b>.orig-</b><u>component</u><b>.tar.</b><u>ext</u>).   <u>component</u>  can  only  contain
       alphanumeric (‘a-zA-Z0-9’) characters and  hyphens  (‘-’).   Optionally  each  original  tarball  can  be
       accompanied  by  a  detached  upstream  signature  (<b>.orig.tar.</b><u>ext</u><b>.asc</b>  and  <b>.orig-</b><u>component</u><b>.tar.</b><u>ext</u><b>.asc</b>),
       extraction supported since dpkg 1.17.20, building supported since dpkg 1.18.5.

       <b>Extracting</b>

       The main original tarball is extracted first, then all additional  original  tarballs  are  extracted  in
       subdirectories named after the <u>component</u> part of their filename (any pre-existing directory is replaced).
       The  debian  tarball  is extracted on top of the source directory after prior removal of any pre-existing
       <b>debian</b> directory.  Note that the debian tarball must contain a  <b>debian</b>  sub-directory  but  it  can  also
       contain binary files outside of that directory (see <b>--include-binaries</b> option).

       All  patches  listed  in  <b>debian/patches/</b><u>vendor</u><b>.series</b>  or  <b>debian/patches/series</b> are then applied, where
       <u>vendor</u> will be the lowercase name of the current vendor, or <b>debian</b> if there is no vendor defined.  If the
       former file is used and the latter one doesn't exist (or is a symlink), then the latter is replaced  with
       a symlink to the former.  This is meant to simplify usage of <b>quilt</b> to manage the set of patches.  Vendor-
       specific  series  files are intended to make it possible to serialize multiple development branches based
       on the vendor, in a declarative way, in preference to open-coding this handling in <b>debian/rules</b>.  This is
       particularly useful when the source would need to be patched conditionally because the affected files  do
       not  have  built-in  conditional occlusion support.  Note however that while <b>dpkg-source</b> parses correctly
       series files with explicit options used for patch application  (stored  on  each  line  after  the  patch
       filename  and  one  or  more spaces), it does ignore those options and always expects patches that can be
       applied with the <b>-p1</b> option of <b>patch</b>.  It will thus emit a warning when it encounters such  options,  and
       the build is likely to fail.

       Note  that  <b><a href="../man1/lintian.1.html">lintian</a></b>(1)  will  emit unconditional warnings when using vendor series due to a controversial
       Debian specific ruling, which should not affect any external usage; to silence these,  the  dpkg  lintian
       profile can be used by passing «<b>--profile</b> <b>dpkg</b>» to <b><a href="../man1/lintian.1.html">lintian</a></b>(1).

       The  timestamp  of  all  patched files is reset to the extraction time of the source package (this avoids
       timestamp skews leading to problems when autogenerated files are patched).

       Contrary to <b>quilt</b>'s default behavior, patches are expected to apply without any fuzz.  When that  is  not
       the case, you should refresh such patches with <b>quilt</b>, or <b>dpkg-source</b> will error out while trying to apply
       them.

       Similarly to <b>quilt</b>'s default behavior, the patches can remove files too.

       The file <b>.pc/applied-patches</b> is created if some patches have been applied during the extraction.

       <b>Building</b>

       All  original tarballs found in the current directory are extracted in a temporary directory by following
       the same logic as for the unpack, the debian directory is copied over in the temporary directory, and all
       patches  except  the  automatic   patch   (<b>debian-changes-</b><u>version</u>   or   <b>debian-changes</b>,   depending   on
       <b>--single-debian-patch</b>) are applied.  The temporary directory is compared to the source package directory.
       When  the diff is non-empty, the build fails unless <b>--single-debian-patch</b> or <b>--auto-commit</b> has been used,
       in which case the diff is stored in the automatic patch.  If the automatic patch is created/deleted, it's
       added/removed from the series file and from the <b>quilt</b> metadata.

       Any change on a binary file is not representable in a diff and will thus lead to  a  failure  unless  the
       maintainer deliberately decided to include that modified binary file in the debian tarball (by listing it
       in <b>debian/source/include-binaries</b>).  The build will also fail if it finds binary files in the debian sub-
       directory unless they have been allowed through <b>debian/source/include-binaries</b>.

       The  updated  debian  directory  and  the  list  of modified binaries is then used to generate the debian
       tarball.

       The automatically generated diff doesn't include changes on VCS specific files as well as many  temporary
       files (see default value associated to <b>-i</b> option in the <b>--help</b> output).  In particular, the <b>.pc</b> directory
       used by <b>quilt</b> is ignored during generation of the automatic patch.

       <b>Note</b>: <b>dpkg-source</b> <b>--before-build</b> (and <b>--build</b>) will ensure that all patches listed in the series file are
       applied  so  that  a  package  build  always  has all patches applied.  It does this by finding unapplied
       patches (they are listed in the <b>series</b> file but not in <b>.pc/applied-patches</b>), and if the  first  patch  in
       that  set can be applied without errors, it will apply them all.  The option <b>--no-preparation</b> can be used
       to disable this behavior.

       <b>Recording</b> <b>changes</b>

       <b>--commit</b> [<u>directory</u>] [<u>patch-name</u>] [<u>patch-file</u>]
           Generates a patch corresponding to the local changes that are not managed by the <b>quilt</b>  patch  system
           and  integrates it in the patch system under the name <u>patch-name</u>.  If the name is missing, it will be
           asked interactively.  If <u>patch-file</u> is given, it is used as the  patch  corresponding  to  the  local
           changes to integrate.  Once integrated, an editor (the first one found from <b>sensible-editor</b>, $VISUAL,
           $EDITOR, <b>vi</b>) is launched so that you can edit the meta-information in the patch header.

           Passing  <u>patch-file</u>  is mainly useful after a build failure that pre-generated this file, and on this
           ground the given file is removed after integration.  Note also that  the  changes  contained  in  the
           patch file must already be applied on the tree and that the files modified by the patch must not have
           supplementary unrecorded changes.

           If  the  patch  generation  detects  modified  binary  files,  they  will  be  automatically added to
           <b>debian/source/include-binaries</b> so that they end up in the debian tarball  (exactly  like  <b>dpkg-source</b>
           <b>--include-binaries</b> <b>--build</b> would do).

       <b>Build</b> <b>options</b>

       <b>--allow-version-of-quilt-db=</b><u>version</u>
           Allow  <b>dpkg-source</b>  to  build  the  source  package  if  the version of the <b>quilt</b> metadata is the one
           specified, even if <b>dpkg-source</b> doesn't know about it (since dpkg 1.15.5.4).   Effectively  this  says
           that  the  given  version  of  the  <b>quilt</b>  metadata is compatible with the version 2 that <b>dpkg-source</b>
           currently supports.  The version of the <b>quilt</b> metadata is stored in <b>.pc/.version</b>.

       <b>--include-removal</b>
           Do not ignore removed files and include them in the automatically generated patch.

       <b>--include-timestamp</b>
           Include timestamp in the automatically generated patch.

       <b>--include-binaries</b>
           Add all modified binaries in the debian tarball.  Also add  them  to  <b>debian/source/include-binaries</b>:
           they will be added by default in subsequent builds and this option is thus no more needed.

       <b>--no-preparation</b>
           Do  not  try to prepare the build tree by applying patches which are apparently unapplied (since dpkg
           1.14.18).

       <b>--single-debian-patch</b>
           Use <b>debian/patches/debian-changes</b> instead of <b>debian/patches/debian-changes-</b><u>version</u> for  the  name  of
           the automatic patch generated during build (since dpkg 1.15.5.4).  This option is particularly useful
           when  the  package  is  maintained in a VCS and a patch set can't reliably be generated.  Instead the
           current diff with upstream should be  stored  in  a  single  patch.   The  option  would  be  put  in
           <b>debian/source/local-options</b>  and  would  be  accompanied  by  a <b>debian/source/local-patch-header</b> file
           explaining how the Debian changes can be best reviewed, for example in the VCS that is used.

       <b>--create-empty-orig</b>
           Automatically create  the  main  original  tarball  as  empty  if  it's  missing  and  if  there  are
           supplementary original tarballs (since dpkg 1.15.6).  This option is meant to be used when the source
           package is just a bundle of multiple upstream software and where there's no “main” software.

       <b>--no-unapply-patches,</b> <b>--unapply-patches</b>
           By  default,  <b>dpkg-source</b>  will automatically unapply the patches in the <b>--after-build</b> hook if it did
           apply them during <b>--before-build</b> (<b>--unapply-patches</b> since  dpkg  1.15.8,  <b>--no-unapply-patches</b>  since
           dpkg  1.16.5).   Those  options  allow  you  to  forcefully disable or enable the patch unapplication
           process.  Those options are only allowed in <b>debian/source/local-options</b> so that all generated  source
           packages have the same behavior by default.

       <b>--abort-on-upstream-changes</b>
           The  process  fails if an automatic patch has been generated (since dpkg 1.15.8).  This option can be
           used to ensure that all changes were properly recorded in separate <b>quilt</b> patches prior to the  source
           package   build.    This  option  is  not  allowed  in  <b>debian/source/options</b>  but  can  be  used  in
           <b>debian/source/local-options</b>.

       <b>--auto-commit</b>
           The process doesn't fail if an automatic patch has been generated, instead it's immediately  recorded
           in the <b>quilt</b> series.

       <b>Extract</b> <b>options</b>

       <b>--skip-debianization</b>
           Skips extraction of the debian tarball on top of the upstream sources (since dpkg 1.15.1).

       <b>--skip-patches</b>
           Do not apply patches at the end of the extraction (since dpkg 1.14.18).

   <b>Format:</b> <b>3.0</b> <b>(custom)</b>
       Supported since dpkg 1.14.17.  This format is special.  It doesn't represent a real source package format
       but can be used to create source packages with arbitrary files.

       <b>Build</b> <b>options</b>

       All  non-option  arguments  are  taken  as files to integrate in the generated source package.  They must
       exist and are preferably in the current directory.  At least one file must be given.

       <b>--target-format=</b><u>value</u>
           <b>Required</b>.  Defines the real format of the generated source package.  The  generated  .dsc  file  will
           contain this value in its <b>Format</b> field and not “3.0 (custom)”.

   <b>Format:</b> <b>3.0</b> <b>(git)</b>
       Supported since dpkg 1.14.17.  This format is experimental.

       A  source  package in this format consists of a single bundle of a git repository <b>.git</b> to hold the source
       of a package.  There may also be a <b>.gitshallow</b> file listing revisions for a shallow git clone.

       <b>Extracting</b>

       The bundle is cloned as a git repository to the target directory.  If there is a gitshallow file,  it  is
       installed as <u>.git/shallow</u> inside the cloned git repository.

       Note that by default the new repository will have the same branch checked out that was checked out in the
       original  source.   (Typically  “main”,  but it could be anything.)  Any other branches will be available
       under <u>remotes/origin/</u>.

       <b>Building</b>

       Before going any further, some checks are done to ensure that we don't have any  non-ignored  uncommitted
       changes.

       <b><a href="../man1/git-bundle.1.html">git-bundle</a></b>(1)  is  used to generate a bundle of the git repository.  By default, all branches and tags in
       the repository are included in the bundle.

       <b>Build</b> <b>options</b>

       <b>--git-ref=</b><u>ref</u>
           Allows specifying a git ref to include in the git bundle.   Use  disables  the  default  behavior  of
           including  all  branches  and  tags.   May be specified multiple times.  The <u>ref</u> can be the name of a
           branch or tag to include.  It may also be any parameter that can be passed to  <b><a href="../man1/git-rev-list.1.html">git-rev-list</a></b>(1).   For
           example,  to  include  only  the  main branch, use <b>--git-ref=</b>main.  To include all tags and branches,
           except for the private branch, use <b>--git-ref=</b>--all <b>--git-ref=</b>^private

       <b>--git-depth=</b><u>number</u>
           Creates a shallow clone with a history truncated to the specified number of revisions.

   <b>Format:</b> <b>3.0</b> <b>(bzr)</b>
       Supported since dpkg 1.14.17.  This format is experimental.  It generates a single tarball containing the
       bzr repository.

       <b>Extracting</b>

       The tarball is unpacked and then bzr is used to checkout the current branch.

       <b>Building</b>

       Before going any further, some checks are done to ensure that we don't have any  non-ignored  uncommitted
       changes.

       Then  the VCS specific part of the source directory is copied over to a temporary directory.  Before this
       temporary directory is packed in a tarball, various cleanup are done to save space.

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>no</b> <b>source</b> <b>format</b> <b>specified</b> <b>in</b> <b>debian/source/format</b>
       The file <b>debian/source/format</b> should always exist and indicate the desired source format.  For  backwards
       compatibility,  format  “1.0”  is assumed when the file doesn't exist but you should not rely on this: at
       some point in the future <b>dpkg-source</b> will be modified to fail when that file doesn't exist.

       The rationale is that format “1.0” is no longer the recommended format, you should usually  pick  one  of
       the newer formats (“3.0 (quilt)”, “3.0 (native)”) but <b>dpkg-source</b> will not do this automatically for you.
       If  you  want  to  continue  using  the  old  format,  you  should  be explicit about it and put “1.0” in
       <b>debian/source/format</b>.

   <b>the</b> <b>diff</b> <b>modifies</b> <b>the</b> <b>following</b> <b>upstream</b> <b>files</b>
       When using source format “1.0” it is usually a bad idea to modify upstream files directly as the  changes
       end  up  hidden  and  mostly undocumented in the .diff.gz file.  Instead you should store your changes as
       patches in the debian directory and apply them at build-time.  To avoid this complexity you can also  use
       the format “3.0 (quilt)” that offers this natively.

   <b>cannot</b> <b>represent</b> <b>change</b> <b>to</b> <u><b>file</b></u>
       Changes  to  upstream sources are usually stored with patch files, but not all changes can be represented
       with patches: they can only alter the content of plain text files.  If you  try  replacing  a  file  with
       something  of  a  different  type (for example replacing a plain file with a symlink or a directory), you
       will get this error message.

   <b>newly</b> <b>created</b> <b>empty</b> <b>file</b> <u><b>file</b></u> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>represented</b> <b>in</b> <b>diff</b>
       Empty files can't be created with patch files.  Thus this change is not recorded in  the  source  package
       and you are warned about it.

   <b>executable</b> <b>mode</b> <u><b>perms</b></u> <b>of</b> <u><b>file</b></u> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>represented</b> <b>in</b> <b>diff</b>
       Patch  files  do  not  record  permissions of files and thus executable permissions are not stored in the
       source package.  This warning reminds you of that fact.

   <b>special</b> <b>mode</b> <u><b>perms</b></u> <b>of</b> <u><b>file</b></u> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>represented</b> <b>in</b> <b>diff</b>
       Patch files do not record permissions of files and thus modified permissions are not stored in the source
       package.  This warning reminds you of that fact.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>DPKG_COLORS</b>
           Sets the color mode (since dpkg 1.18.5).  The currently accepted values are: <b>auto</b>  (default),  <b>always</b>
           and <b>never</b>.

       <b>DPKG_NLS</b>
           If  set,  it  will  be  used  to  decide  whether  to activate Native Language Support, also known as
           internationalization (or i18n) support (since dpkg  1.19.0).   The  accepted  values  are:  <b>0</b>  and  <b>1</b>
           (default).

       <b>SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH</b>
           If  set,  it  will  be  used  as the timestamp (as seconds since the epoch) to clamp the mtime in the
           <b><a href="../man5/tar.5.html">tar</a></b>(5) file entries.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>debian/source/format</b>
       This file contains on a single line the format that should be used to build the source package  (possible
       formats are described above).  No leading or trailing spaces are allowed.

   <b>debian/source/include-binaries</b>
       This  file  contains  a  list  of  pathnames  of  binary files (one per line) relative to the source root
       directory that should be included in the debian tarball.   Leading  and  trailing  spaces  are  stripped.
       Lines starting with ‘<b>#</b>’ are comments and are skipped.  Empty lines are ignored.

   <b>debian/source/options</b>
       This  file  contains  a list of long options that should be automatically prepended to the set of command
       line options of a <b>dpkg-source</b> <b>--build</b> or <b>dpkg-source</b> <b>--print-format</b> call.  Options like <b>--compression</b> and
       <b>--compression-level</b> are well suited for this file.

       Each option should be put on a separate line.  Empty lines and lines starting with ‘<b>#</b>’ are ignored.   The
       leading  ‘<b>--</b>’  should  be stripped and short options are not allowed.  Optional spaces are allowed around
       the ‘<b>=</b>’ symbol and optional quotes are allowed around the value.  Here's an example of such a file:

        # let dpkg-source create a debian.tar.bz2 with maximal compression
        compression = "bzip2"
        compression-level = 9
        # use debian/patches/debian-changes as automatic patch
        single-debian-patch
        # ignore changes on config.{sub,guess}
        extend-diff-ignore = "(^|/)(config.sub|config.guess)$"

       <b>Note</b>: <b>format</b> options are not accepted in this file, you should use <b>debian/source/format</b> instead.

   <b>debian/source/local-options</b>
       Exactly like <b>debian/source/options</b> except that the file is not included in the generated source  package.
       It  can  be useful to store a preference tied to the maintainer or to the VCS repository where the source
       package is maintained.

   <b>debian/source/local-patch-header</b>
   <b>debian/source/patch-header</b>
       Free form text that is put on top of the automatic patch generated in formats  “2.0”  or  “3.0  (quilt)”.
       <b>local-patch-header</b> is not included in the generated source package while <b>patch-header</b> is.

   <b>debian/patches/</b><u><b>vendor</b></u><b>.series</b>
   <b>debian/patches/series</b>
       This  file  lists  all patches that have to be applied (in the given order) on top of the upstream source
       package.  Leading and trailing spaces are stripped.  The <u>vendor</u> will be the lowercase name of the current
       vendor, or <b>debian</b> if there is no vendor defined.  If the vendor-specific series file does not exist,  the
       vendor-less series file will be used.  Lines starting with ‘<b>#</b>’ are comments and are skipped.  Empty lines
       are  ignored.  Remaining lines start with a patch filename (relative to the <b>debian/patches/</b> directory) up
       to the first space character or the end of line.  Optional <b>quilt</b> options can follow up to the end of line
       or the first ‘<b>#</b>’ preceded by one or more spaces (which marks the start of a comment  up  to  the  end  of
       line).

</pre><h4><b>SECURITY</b></h4><pre>
       Examining  untrusted  source  packages or extracting them into staging directories should be considered a
       security boundary, and any breakage of that boundary stemming from these operations should be  considered
       a  security  vulnerability.   But  handling  untrusted source packages should not be done lightly, as the
       surface area includes any compression command supported, commands to handle specific data  formats  (such
       as  <b><a href="../man1/tar.1.html">tar</a></b>(1)  or  <b><a href="../man1/patch.1.html">patch</a></b>(1))  in  addition  to  the  source  package  formats  and control files themselves.
       Performing these operations over untrusted data as root is strongly discouraged.

       Building source packages should only be performed over trusted data.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       The point at which field overriding occurs compared to certain standard output field settings  is  rather
       confused.
