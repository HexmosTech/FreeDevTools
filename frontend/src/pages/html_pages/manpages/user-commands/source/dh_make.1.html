</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       dh_make - prepare upstream source for Debian packaging

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>dh_make</b> [<u>option</u>]...

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>dh_make</b>  is  a  tool  that  adds  necessary  files  for making Debian source package from upstream source
       according to the requirements of  the  Debian  Policy.   <b>dh_make</b>  must  be  invoked  within  a  directory
       containing  the  source code, which must be named &lt;packagename&gt;-&lt;version&gt;.  The &lt;packagename&gt; must be all
       lowercase, The &lt;packagename&gt; and &lt;version&gt; must be all lowercase, digits and dashes.  The  &lt;version&gt;  can
       also  contain  digits,  and  the symbols plus, dot, tilde. The &lt;version&gt; must start with a digit.  If the
       directory name does not conform to this scheme, you must rename it before using <b>dh_make.</b>   Alternatively,
       you may be able to use the <b>--packagename</b> option to force the package name.

   <b>PACKAGE</b> <b>CLASSES</b>
       Classes  can be set with the single direct options (such as --s for single) or with the -C,--packageclass
       option (-C=s for single).

       <b>Single</b> <b>binary</b> <b>(s)</b>
              The package will generate a single binary .deb package. It is the standard case, so if  you  don't
              know what to do, choose this.

       <b>Arch-Independent</b> <b>(i)</b>
              The package will generate a single package that is arch-independent.

       <b>Library</b> <b>(l)</b>
              The  package  will  generate at least two binaries. One library package containing just the lib in
              <u><a href="file:/usr/lib">/usr/lib</a></u> and another *-dev_*.deb package containing documentation and C headers.

          <b>ACTIONS</b> <b>PERFORMED</b>
              Unless   <b>--native</b>   was   given,    <b>dh_make</b>    makes    sure    a    original    source    archive
              (&lt;packagename&gt;_&lt;version&gt;.orig.tar.gz)  exists.  The  archive can either end with .gz or one of the
              other supported compression extensions such as bz2 or lzma.  If no  such  file  exists,  the  file
              specified  with  <b>-f</b>  is  copied  in  place.   If no <b>-f</b> is supplied either but <b>--createorig</b> is, the
              current directory  is  created  into  a  new  archive  <u>../&lt;packagename&gt;-&lt;version&gt;.orig.tar.gz</u>  The
              original  archive  is  needed for other Debian tools to generate the diffs to the original sources
              required by the Debian packaging format.  Unless there are reasons against it, this file should be
              the pristine upstream archive.

       Then <b>dh_make</b> proceeds to generate a "debian" subdirectory and the necessary control files in the  program
       source  directory. Those control files are customized with the packagename and version extracted from the
       directory name.

       <b>dh_make</b> makes several attempts to obtain the username. It first  checks  for  the  environment  variables
       <b>$DEBFULLNAME</b>, <b>$LOGNAME</b> is used to find a name in the <u><a href="file:/etc/passwd">/etc/passwd</a></u> file, and through NIS, YP and LDAP.

       The e-mail address can either be specified with the -fB--email option or <b>dh_make</b> will attempt to find it.
       It will first check the environment variables <b>$DEBEMAIL</b> and then <b>$EMAIL.</b> <b>If</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>set</b> <b>then</b> <b>dh_make</b>
       will  search  an  available LDAP directory using <b><a href="../man1/ldapsearch.1.html">ldapsearch</a></b>(1) using <b>$LOGNAME</b> as the uid to search under.
       Finally it will use <b>$LOGNAME</b> and <u>/etc/mailname</u> to generate an email address.

       <b>dh_make</b> will also generate example files that are also customized for  the  package  generated.  You  can
       remove  all  files  with  *.ex  if you wish. You can also delete the README.Debian file if you don't have
       anything to put in it.  Renaming the example files to their name without the .ex at the end (and  editing
       them if necessary) will activate that feature of debhelper.

       If  the  <b>--templates</b>  or  <b>-o</b>  (<b>--overlay</b>) option is used <b>dh_make</b> will apply a customizing template to the
       "debian" directory. See the templates described in the FILES section of this manpage for samples.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-c</b>, <b>--copyright</b> <u>license</u>
              Use <u>license</u> type in copyright file.  <u>license</u> can be apache, artistic, bsd, expat, gpl, gpl2, gpl3,
              isc, lgpl, lgpl2, lgpl3, or custom.  If this field is not specified the copyright file has a space
              to fill in which sort of license is used. The field is case-insensitive so -c GPL works as well as
              -c gpl. gpl and lgpl will give you version 3 of the corresponding license, apache  implies  Apache
              v2.0.  If  you  need  a  different version, change the license file afterwards or use the gpl2 and
              lgpl2 options.  If you select custom here you will need to use the <b>--copyrightfile</b> option as well.

       <b>--copyrightfile</b> <u>filename</u>
              When using the custom <b>--copyright</b> option this is the  location  of  your  custom  copyright  file.
              <b>dh_make</b> will process this file just like the standard copyright files. It is suggested you use one
              of the existing license files as a starting point.

       <b>--createorig</b>
              Create  new  archive  <u>../&lt;packagename&gt;-&lt;version&gt;.orig.tar.gz</u>  from  the  contents  of  the current
              directory. Can not be used together with <b>--native</b> nor <b>-f</b>.

       <b>--docs</b> Create a separate <u>PACKAGE-doc</u> binary package. All found documents in the source  package  will  be
              installed here.

       <b>-e</b>, <b>--email</b> <u>address</u>
              Use <u>address</u> as the e-mail address in the Maintainer: field of debian/control file.

       <b>-n</b>, <b>--native</b>
              Create  a native Debian packages, i.e. do not generate a .orig archive, since it will be generated
              when building with dpkg-buildpackage.  The version number will not have a Debian  revision  number
              (e.g. -1) appended to it.

       <b>-f</b>, <b>--file</b> <u>file</u>
              Use  <u>file</u>  as  the  original  source  archive, and skip the copying of the current program tree to
              program.orig.

       <b>-l</b>, <b>--library</b>
              Automatically set the package class to Library, skipping the question.

       <b>-s</b>, <b>--single</b>
              Automatically set the package class to Single binary, skipping the question.

       <b>-i</b>, <b>--indep</b>
              Automatically set the package class to arch-independent binary, skipping the question.

       <b>-a</b>, <b>--addmissing</b>
              Adds missing example and control files on an existing debian source directory.

       <b>-t</b>, <b>--templates</b> <u>directory</u>
              Applies the customizing templates in <u>directory</u> to the debian directory.

       <b>-o</b>, <b>--overlay</b> <u>directory</u>
              Applies a customization template to an existing debian directory.

       <b>-p</b>, <b>--packagename</b> <u>name</u>
              Force the package name to be <u>name</u>,  good  for  packages  with  hyphens  in  their  name  or  other
              strangeness. You can also make the parameter <u>name</u>_<u>version</u> which will set both the package name and
              version and bypass and directory checking.

       <b>-d</b>, <b>--defaultless</b>
              Skips applying the default templates to the target debian directory. Generally used in conjunction
              with either the <b>--overlay</b> or <b>--templates</b> options.

       <b>--with-emacs</b>
              Add files for emacsen.

       <b>--python</b>
              Set package class to Python to generate additional Python packaging specific definitions.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
              Display the name, version, available options and authors, and exit successfully.

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--version</b>
              Show the program name and version, and exit successfully.

       <b>-y</b>, <b>--yes</b>
              Automatic yes to prompts and run non-interactively.  The package class needs to be set for <b>dh_make</b>
              to run fully automatically.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       The following environment settings are used by <b>dh_make</b>:

       <b>DEBEMAIL</b>
              Email address to use in control and changelog entries.

       <b>DEBFULLNAME</b>
              You full name, eg "John Doe" which will appear in the control and changelog entries.

       <b>EMAIL</b>  Email address to use in control and changelog entries, only used if <b>DEBEMAIL</b> is no set.

       <b>LOGNAME</b>
              Default username used for looking up email and full name in other directories.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <u>/usr/share/debhelper/dh_make</u>
              Directory that contains all the template files, separated in six directories:

       <u>debian/</u>
              with files for all package classes,

       <u>debians/</u>
              with files specific to the Single binary class,

       <u>debianl/</u>
              with files specific to the Library class, and finally,

       <u>native/</u>
              with files specific to the native Debian packages.

       <u>licenses/</u>
              template files for the more common licenses used in Debian packages

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       To get <b>dh_make</b> to use the defaults and ask you various questions about the package

           dh_make

       Create your single class package using the with the GPL license:

           dh_make -s -c gpl

       A  more  involved  example  where  you set your name in the environment, contact email and license in the
       options and specify the upstream file:

           DEBFULLNAME="John Doe"
           dh_make --email <a href="mailto:contact@example.com">contact@example.com</a> --copyright=bsd \
            --file ../foo.tar.gz

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>dh_make</b> may not detect your username and email address correctly when using sudo.
