</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       db5.3_recover - Restore the database to a consistent state

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>db5.3_recover</b> [-ceVv] [-h home] [-P password] [-t [[CC]YY]MMDDhhmm[.SS]]]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  db5.3_recover utility must be run after an unexpected application, Berkeley DB, or system failure to
       restore the database to a consistent state. All committed transactions are  guaranteed  to  appear  after
       db5.3_recover has run, and all uncommitted transactions will be completely undone.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-c</b>     Perform catastrophic recovery instead of normal recovery.

       <b>-e</b>     Retain the environment after running recovery.  This option will rarely be used unless a DB_CONFIG
              file  is present in the home directory.  If a DB_CONFIG file is not present, then the regions will
              be created with default parameter values.

       <b>-h</b>     Specify a home directory for the database environment; by default, the current  working  directory
              is used.

       <b>-P</b>     Specify  an  environment  password.   Although Berkeley DB utilities overwrite password strings as
              soon as possible, be aware there may be a window of vulnerability on  systems  where  unprivileged
              users  can  see  command-line  arguments  or  where utilities are not able to overwrite the memory
              containing the command-line arguments.

       <b>-t</b>     Recover to the time specified rather than to  the  most  current  possible  date.   The  timestamp
              argument  should  be  in  the form [[CC]YY]MMDDhhmm[.SS] where each pair of letters represents the
              following:

              CC     The first two digits of the year (the century).

              YY     The second two digits of the year.  If "YY" is specified, but "CC" is not, a value for "YY"
                     between 69 and 99 results in a "CC" value of 19.  Otherwise, a "YY" value of 20 is used.

              MM     The month of the year, from 1 to 12.

              DD     The day of the month, from 1 to 31.

              hh     The hour of the day, from 0 to 23.

              mm     The minute of the hour, from 0 to 59.

              SS     The second of the minute, from 0 to 61.

              If the "CC" and "YY" letter pairs are not specified, the values default to the current  year.   If
              the "SS" letter pair is not specified, the value defaults to 0.

       <b>-V</b>     Write the library version number to the standard output, and exit.

       <b>-v</b>     Run in verbose mode.

       In  the  case  of  catastrophic  recovery, an archival copy - or <u>snapshot</u> - of all database files must be
       restored along with all of the log files written since the database file snapshot  was  made.   (If  disk
       space is a problem, log files may be referenced by symbolic links).

       If  the  failure  was  not  catastrophic,  the  files  present  on  the system at the time of failure are
       sufficient to perform recovery.

       If log files are missing, db5.3_recover will identify the missing log file(s) and fail, in which case the
       missing log files need to be restored and recovery performed again.

       The db5.3_recover utility uses a Berkeley DB environment (as described for the <b>-h</b> option, the environment
       variable <b>DB_HOME</b>, or because the utility was run in a directory containing a  Berkeley  DB  environment).
       In  order  to  avoid  environment  corruption  when using a Berkeley DB environment, db5.3_recover should
       always be given the chance to detach from the environment and exit gracefully.  To cause db5.3_recover to
       release all environment resources and exit cleanly, send it an interrupt signal (SIGINT).

       The db5.3_recover utility exits 0 on success, and &gt;0 if an error occurs.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>DB_HOME</b>
              If the <b>-h</b> option is not specified and the environment variable DB_HOME is set, it is used  as  the
              path of the database home, as described in DB_ENV-&gt;open.
