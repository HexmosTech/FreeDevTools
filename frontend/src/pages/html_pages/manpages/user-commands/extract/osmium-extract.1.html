       osmium-extract - create geographical extracts from an OSM file

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>osmium</b> <b>extract</b> --config <u>CONFIG-FILE</u> [<u>OPTIONS</u>] <u>OSM-FILE</u>
       <b>osmium</b> <b>extract</b> --bbox <u>LEFT</u>,<u>BOTTOM</u>,<u>RIGHT</u>,<u>TOP</u> [<u>OPTIONS</u>] <u>OSM-FILE</u>
       <b>osmium</b> <b>extract</b> --polygon <u>POLYGON-FILE</u> [<u>OPTIONS</u>] <u>OSM-FILE</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Create  geographical  extracts  from  an  OSM data file or an OSM history file.  The region (geographical
       extent) can be given as a bounding box or as a (multi)polygon.

       There are three ways of calling this command:

       • Specify a config file with the <b>--config/-c</b> option.  It can define any number of regions you want to cut
         out.  See the <b>CONFIG</b> <b>FILE</b> section for details.

       • Specify a bounding box to cut out with the <b>--bbox/-b</b> option.

       • Specify a (multi)polygon to cut out with the <b>--polygon/-p</b> option.

       The input file is assumed to be ordered in the usual order: nodes first, then ways, then relations.

       If the <b>--with-history/-H</b> option is used, the  command  will  work  correctly  for  history  files.   This
       currently  works  for  the  <b>complete_ways</b> strategy only.  The <b>simple</b> or <b>smart</b> strategies do not work with
       history files.  A history extract will contain every version of all objects with at least one version  in
       the region.  Generating a history extract is somewhat slower than a normal data extract.

       Osmium  will  make  sure  that  all  nodes  on  the vertices of the boundary of the region will be in the
       extract, but nodes that happen to be directly on the boundary, but between those vertices, might  end  up
       in the extract or not.  In almost all cases this will be good enough, but if you want to make really sure
       you got everything, use a small buffer around your region.

       By  default  no  <b>bounds</b> will be set in the header of the output file.  Use the <b>--set-bounds</b> option if you
       need this.

       Note that <b>osmium</b> <b>extract</b> will never clip any OSM objects, ie.  it will not remove node references outside
       the region from ways or unused relation members from relations.  This means you might  get  objects  that
       are not reference-complete.  It has the advantage that you can use <b>osmium</b> <b>merge</b> to merge several extracts
       without problems.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       -b, --bbox=LONG1,LAT1,LONG2,LAT2
              Set  the  bounding  box  to  cut  out.   Can  not  be  used  with  <b>--polygon/-p</b>,  <b>--config/-c</b>,  or
              <b>--directory/-d</b>.  The coordinates  LONG1,LAT1  are  from  one  arbitrary  corner,  the  coordinates
              LONG2,LAT2 are from the opposite corner.

       -c, --config=FILE
              Set  the  name of the config file.  Can not be used with the <b>--bbox/-b</b> or <b>--polygon/-p</b> option.  If
              this is set, the <b>--output/-o</b> and <b>--output-format/-f</b> options are ignored, because they are  set  in
              the config file.

       --clean=ATTR
              Clean  the  attribute  (<u>version</u>, <u>timestamp</u>, <u>changeset</u>, <u>uid</u>, <u>user</u>), from the data before writing it
              out again.  The attribute will be set to 0 (the user will be  set  to  the  empty  string).   This
              option can be given multiple times.  Depending on the output format these attributes might show up
              as 0 or not show up at all.

       -d, --directory=DIRECTORY
              Output  directory.   Output  file  names  in  the  config  file  are  relative  to this directory.
              Overwrites the setting of the same name in the config file.   This  option  is  ignored  when  the
              <b>--bbox/-b</b> or <b>--polygon/-p</b> options are used, set the output directory and name with the <b>--output/-o</b>
              option in that case.

       -H, --with-history
              Specify that the input file is a history file.  The output file(s) will also be history file(s).

       -p, --polygon=POLYGON_FILE
              Set the polygon to cut out based on the contents of the file.  The file has to be a GeoJSON, poly,
              or  OSM  file  as  described in the <b>(MULTI)POLYGON</b> <b>FILE</b> <b>FORMATS</b> section.  It has to have the right
              suffix to be detected correctly.  Can not be used with <b>--bbox/-b</b>, <b>--config/-c</b>, or <b>--directory/-d</b>.

       -s, --strategy=STRATEGY
              Use the given strategy to extract the region.  For possible values and details see the  <b>STRATEGIES</b>
              section.  Default is “complete_ways”.

       -S, --option=OPTION=VALUE
              Set  a named option for the strategy.  If needed you can specify this option multiple times to set
              several options.

       --set-bounds
              Set the bounds field in the header.  The bounds are set to the bbox or  envelope  of  the  polygon
              specified  for  the extract.  Note that strategies other than “simple” can put nodes outside those
              bounds into the output file.

</pre><h4><b>COMMON</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       -h, --help
              Show usage help.

       -v, --verbose
              Set verbose mode.  The program will output information about what it is doing to STDERR.

</pre><h4><b>INPUT</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       -F, --input-format=FORMAT
              The format of the input file(s).  Can be used to set the input format if it can’t be  autodetected
              from  the  file name(s).  This will set the format for all input files, there is no way to set the
              format for some input files only.  See <b><a href="../man5/osmium-file-formats.5.html">osmium-file-formats</a></b>(5) or the libosmium manual for details.

</pre><h4><b>OUTPUT</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       -f, --output-format=FORMAT
              The format of the output file.  Can be used  to  set  the  output  file  format  if  it  can’t  be
              autodetected  from  the  output file name.  See <b><a href="../man5/osmium-file-formats.5.html">osmium-file-formats</a></b>(5) or the libosmium manual for
              details.

       --fsync
              Call fsync after writing the output file to force flushing buffers to disk.

       --generator=NAME
              The name and version of the program generating the output file.  It will be added to the header of
              the output file.  Default is “<u>osmium/</u>” and the version of osmium.

       -o, --output=FILE
              Name of the output file.  Default is `-' (STDOUT).

       -O, --overwrite
              Allow an existing output file to be overwritten.  Normally <b>osmium</b> will refuse  to  write  over  an
              existing file.

       --output-header=OPTION=VALUE
              Add  output  header  option.   This  command  line option can be used multiple times for different
              OPTIONs.  See the <u><a href="../man5/osmium-output-headers.5.html">osmium-output-headers</a>(5)</u> man page for a list of available header  options.   For
              some  commands you can use the special format “OPTION!” (ie.  an exclamation mark after the OPTION
              and no value set) to set the value to the same as in the input file.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIG</b> <b>FILE</b></h4><pre>
       The config file mainly specifies the file names and the regions of the extracts that should be created.

       The config file is in JSON format.  The top-level is an object which  contains  at  least  an  “extracts”
       array.  It can also contain a “directory” entry which names the directory where all the output files will
       be created:

              {
                  "extracts": [...],
                  "directory": "<a href="file:/tmp/">/tmp/</a>"
              }

       The  extracts  array  specifies the extracts that should be created.  Each item in the array is an object
       with at least a name “output” naming the output file and a region  defined  in  a  “bbox”,  “polygon”  or
       “multipolygon”  name.  An optional “description” can be added, it will not be used by the program but can
       help with documenting the file contents.  You can add an optional “output_format” if the format  can  not
       be  detected from the “output” file name.  Run “osmium help file-formats” to get a description of allowed
       formats.

       The optional “output_header” allows  you  to  set  additional  OSM  file  header  settings  such  as  the
       “generator”.  If you set the value of a file header setting to null, the output header will be set to the
       same header from the input file.

              "extracts": [
                  {
                      "output": "hamburg.osm.pbf",
                      "output_format": "pbf",
                      "description": "optional description",
                      "bbox": ...
                  },
                  {
                      "output": "berlin.osm.pbf",
                      "description": "optional description",
                      "polygon": ...
                  },
                  {
                      "output": "munich.osm.pbf",
                      "output_header": {
                          "generator": "MyExtractor/1.0",
                          "osmosis_replication_timestamp": null
                      },
                      "description": "optional description",
                      "multipolygon": ...
                  }
              ]

       There are several formats for specifying the regions:

       <b>bbox</b>:

       A  bounding box in one of two formats.  The first is a simple array with four real numbers, the first two
       specifying the coordinates of an arbitrary corner, the second  two  specifying  the  coordinates  of  the
       opposite corner.

              {
                  "output": "munich.osm.pbf",
                  "description": "Bounding box specified in array format",
                  "bbox": [11.35, 48.05, 11.73, 48.25]
              }

       The second format uses an object instead of an array:

              {
                  "output": "dresden.osm.pbf",
                  "description": "Bounding box specified in object format",
                  "bbox": {
                      "left": 13.57,
                      "right": 13.97,
                      "top": 51.18,
                      "bottom": 50.97
                  }
              }

       <b>polygon</b>:

       A  polygon,  either  specified  inline  in  the  config  file  or  read  from  an external file.  See the
       <b>(MULTI)POLYGON</b> <b>FILE</b> <b>FORMATS</b> section for external files.  If specified inline this is a nested array,  the
       outer  array  defining  the  polygon,  the next array the rings and the innermost arrays the coordinates.
       This format is the same as in GeoJSON files.

       In this example there is only one outer ring:

              "polygon": [[
                  [9.613465, 53.58071],
                  [9.647599, 53.59655],
                  [9.649288, 53.61059],
                  [9.613465, 53.58071]
              ]]

       In each ring, the last set of coordinates should be the same as the first set, closing the ring.

       <b>multipolygon</b>:

       A multipolygon, either specified inline in the config file or  read  from  an  external  file.   See  the
       <b>(MULTI)POLYGON</b>  <b>FILE</b> <b>FORMATS</b> section for external files.  If specified inline this is a nested array, the
       outer array defining the multipolygon, the next array the polygons, the next the rings and the  innermost
       arrays the coordinates.  This format is the same as in GeoJSON files.

       In this example there is one outer and one inner ring:

              "multipolygon": [[[
                  [6.847, 50.987],
                  [6.910, 51.007],
                  [7.037, 50.953],
                  [6.967, 50.880],
                  [6.842, 50.925],
                  [6.847, 50.987]
              ],[
                  [6.967, 50.954],
                  [6.969, 50.920],
                  [6.932, 50.928],
                  [6.934, 50.950],
                  [6.967, 50.954]
              ]]]

       In each ring, the last set of coordinates should be the same as the first set, closing the ring.

       Osmium  must  check  each  and  every  node  in  the  input  data and find out in which bounding boxes or
       (multi)polygons this  node  is.   This  is  very  cheap  for  bounding  boxes,  but  more  expensive  for
       (multi)polygons.   And  it  becomes more expensive the more vertices the (multi)polyon has.  Use bounding
       boxes or simplified polygons where possible.

       Note that bounding boxes or (multi)polygons are not allowed to span the -180/180  degree  line.   If  you
       need this, cut out the regions on each side and use <b>osmium</b> <b>merge</b> to join the resulting files.

</pre><h4><b>(MULTI)POLYGON</b> <b>FILE</b> <b>FORMATS</b></h4><pre>
       External  files  describing  a  (multi)polygon are specified in the config file using the “file_name” and
       “file_type” properties on the “polygon” or “multipolygon” object:

              "polygon": {
                  "file_name": "berlin.geojson",
                  "file_type": "geojson"
              }

       If file names don’t start with a slash (/), they are interpreted relative  to  the  directory  where  the
       config  file  is.  If the “file_type” is missing, Osmium will try to autodetect it from the suffix of the
       “file_name”.

       The following file types are supported:

       geojson
              GeoJSON  file  containing  exactly  one  Feature  of  type   Polygon   or   MultiPolygon,   or   a
              FeatureCollection  with  the first Feature of type Polygon or MultiPolygon.  Everything except the
              actual geometry (of the first Feature) is ignored.

       poly   A poly file as described in https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Osmosis/Polygon_Filter_File_Format
              .  This wiki page also mentions several sources for such poly files.

       osm    An OSM file containing one or more multipolygon or boundary relation together with all  the  nodes
              and  ways  needed.  Any OSM file format (XML, PBF, ...)  supported by Osmium can be used here, but
              the correct suffix must be used, so the file format is detected correctly.   Files  for  this  can
              easily be obtained by searching for the area on OSM and then downloading the full relation using a
              URL  like https://www.openstreetmap.org/api/0.6/relation/RELATION-ID/full .  Or you can use <b>osmium</b>
              <b>getid</b> <b>-r</b> to get a specific relation from an OSM file.  Note that both these approaches can get you
              very detailed boundaries which can take quite a  while  to  cut  out.   Consider  simplifying  the
              boundary before use.

       If  there  are  several  (multi)polygons  in  a  poly  file  or  OSM  file,  they  will  be  merged.  The
       (multi)polygons must not overlap, otherwise the result is undefined.

</pre><h4><b>STRATEGIES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>osmium</b> <b>extract</b> can use different strategies  for  creating  the  extracts.   Depending  on  the  strategy
       different  objects  will  end up in the extracts.  The strategies differ in how much memory they need and
       how often they need to read the input file.  The choice of strategy depends on how you want  to  use  the
       generated extracts and how much memory and time you have.

       The default strategy is <b>complete_ways</b>.

       Strategy <b>simple</b>
              Runs  in  a  single  pass.   The  extract  will  contain  all nodes inside the region and all ways
              referencing those nodes as well as all relations referencing any nodes or ways  already  included.
              Ways  crossing  the  region  boundary  will  not  be  reference-complete.   Relations  will not be
              reference-complete.  This strategy is fast, because it reads the input only once, but  the  result
              is  not  enough  for  most  use cases.  It is the only strategy that will work when reading from a
              socket or pipe.  This strategy will not work for history files.

       Strategy <b>complete_ways</b>
              Runs in two passes.  The extract will contain all nodes inside the region and all ways referencing
              those nodes as well as all nodes referenced by those ways.  The  extract  will  also  contain  all
              relations  referenced  by nodes inside the region or ways already included and, recursively, their
              parent relations.  The ways are reference-complete, but the relations are not.

       Strategy <b>smart</b>
              Runs in three passes.  The extract  will  contain  all  nodes  inside  the  region  and  all  ways
              referencing  those  nodes  as  well  as all nodes referenced by those ways.  The extract will also
              contain all relations referenced by  nodes  inside  the  region  or  ways  already  included  and,
              recursively,  their  parent  relations.  The extract will also contain all nodes and ways (and the
              nodes they reference) referenced by relations tagged “type=multipolygon” directly referencing  any
              nodes in the region or ways referencing nodes in the region.  The ways are reference-complete, and
              all  multipolygon relations referencing nodes in the regions or ways that have nodes in the region
              are reference-complete.  Other relations are not reference-complete.

       For the <b>complete_ways</b> strategy you can set the option “-S relations=false” in  which  case  no  relations
       will be written to the output file.

       The <b>smart</b> strategy allows the following strategy options:

       Use  “-S  types=TYPE,...” to change the types of relations that should be reference-complete.  Instead of
       just relations tagged “type=multipolygon”, you can either get all relations (use “-S types=any”) or  give
       a list of types to the -S option: “-S types=multipolygon,route”.  Note that especially boundary relations
       can be huge, so if you include them, be aware your result might be huge.

       Use “-S complete-partial-relations=X” to force completion of partly completed relations.  If this is set,
       all  relations that have more than X percent of their members already in the extract will have their full
       set of members in the extract.  So this allows completing almost complete relations.  It  can  be  useful
       for  instance to make sure a boundary relation is complete even if some of it is outside the polygon used
       for extraction.

       Use “-S tags=PATTERN,...” to only complete relations that have a tag matching one of  the  PATTERNs.   So
       for  example  if  you  use  “-S  tags=landuse,natural=wood,natural=water”  everything tagged landuse=* or
       natural=wood or natural=water is added to the result, but no other relations.

       You can combine the “-S types”, “-S complete-partial-relations”, and “-S tags” options.  The options will

       <b>osmium</b> <b>extract</b> exits with exit code

       0      if everything went alright,

       1      if there was an error processing the data, or

       2      if there was a problem with the command line arguments, config file or polygon files.

</pre><h4><b>MEMORY</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       Memory usage of <b>osmium</b> <b>extract</b> depends on the number of extracts and  on  the  strategy  used.   For  the
       <u>simple</u>  strategy  it will at least be the number of extracts times the highest node ID used divided by 8.
       For the <u>complete_ways</u> twice that and for the <u>smart</u> strategy a bit more.

       If you want to split a large file into many extracts, do this in several  steps.   First  create  several
       larger extracts and then split them again and again into smaller pieces.

</pre><h4><b>LIMITS</b></h4><pre>
       You  can  not  have  more than 500 extracts.  Although chances are that you will be running out of memory
       long before that.  See MEMORY USAGE.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       See the example config files in the <u>extract-example-config</u> directory.  To try it:

              osmium extract -v -c extract-example-config/extracts.json \
                  germany-latest.osm.pbf

       Extract the city of Karlsruhe using a boundary polygon:

              osmium extract -p karlsruhe-boundary.osm.bz2 germany-latest.osm.pbf \
                  -o karlsruhe.osm.pbf

       Extract the city of Munich using a bounding box:

              osmium extract -b 11.35,48.05,11.73,48.25 germany-latest.osm.pbf \
                  -o munich.osm.pbf
