</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       botch-extract-scc - extract all strongly connected components

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>botch-extract-scc</b> [options] <u>graph.xml</u> [<u>prefix</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Extract strongly connected components (SCC) from an input graph in GraphML or dot format.

       The  strongly  connected  components  are  stored as one file each in either the current directory or the
       directory given by the <b>--outdir</b> option.

       The file names that were generated for them are printed on standard output.

       By default that filename is of the format PREFIX_VERTEX_SIZE.EXT where PREFIX can be set on  the  command
       line,  while  VERTEX  defaults to the vertex ID chosen by network, SIZE is the size of the SCC and EXT is
       xml by default but can be set using the <b>--extension</b> option. This is to reduce the  possibility  that  two
       output  graph  files  happen  to  have  the  same  name.  You  can  make  them  more  unique by using the
       <b>--outfnamevert</b> and <b>--outfnameattr</b> options which refine the string that will be printed for VERTEX.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-h,</b> <b>--help</b>
           Show help.

       <b>--outdir=</b><u>DIR</u>
           output directory. Default is current directory

       <b>--outfnamevert=</b><u>VERT</u>
           This option picks the set of vertices from which the  smallest  one  (by  string  comparison  of  the
           attribute  determined by the <b>--outfnameattr</b> option) will be chosen to be stored in place of VERTEX in
           the output file name.  The VERT argument is a key/value pair  (separated  by  a  colon)  of  a  graph
           attribute and its value. By default (without this option), all vertices of the graph are considered.

           The special key "__ID__" allows one to select the unique vertex identifier.

           This  option  can  be  specified  more  than  once. The final set of vertices is chosen such that all
           vertices match all key/value pairs. Multiple <b>--outfnamevert</b> options thus form a  logical  conjunction
           (they are AND-ed together).

       <b>--outfnameattr=</b><u>attribute</u>
           This option picks the vertex attribute that is to be printed in VERTEX in the output file name.

       <b>--extension=</b><u>EXT</u>
           Output  files have extension <u>EXT</u>. Default is xml. This option also governs the output format. The xml
           extension saves in GraphML format while the dot extension saves in the dot format.

       <b>-v,</b> <b>--verbose</b>
           Be verbose.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLE</b></h4><pre>
       Extract the strongly connected components of  a  buildgraph  and  store  them  in  the  directory  "out",
       prefixing  each  filename with "cyclic" and let the VERTEX value be the cudfname field of source packages
       only.

        botch-extract-scc --verbose --outdir=out --outfnameattr=cudfname --outfnamevert type:src buildgraph.xml cyclic
