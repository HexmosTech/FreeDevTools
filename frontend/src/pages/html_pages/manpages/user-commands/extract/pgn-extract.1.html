</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       pgn-extract - a Portable Game Notation (PGN) extractor

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>pgn-extract</b> [flags] file.pgn [file.pgn ...]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>pgn-extract</b>  is  a  free,  open-source  program pgn-extract, which is designed to support the processing,
       searching and extraction of chess games from files written in PGN  format.  There  are  several  ways  to
       specify  the  criteria on which to extract: textual move sequences, the position reached after a sequence
       of moves, information in the tag fields, and material balance in the ending. Full ANSI  C  source  and  a
       32-bit  Windows  binary  for the program are available under the terms of the GNU General Public License.
       The program includes a semantic analyser which will report errors in game scores and it is also  able  to
       detect duplicate games found in one or more of its input files.

       The  range  of  input  move  formats accepted is fairly wide and includes recognition of lower-case piece
       letters for English and upper-case piece letters for Dutch and German. The default output is  in  English
       Standard Algebraic Notation (SAN), although there is some support for output in different notations.

       Extracted  games  may  be written out either including or excluding comments, NAGs, and variations. Games
       may be given ECO classifications derived from the accompanying file  eco.pgn,  or  a  customised  version
       provided by the user.

       Plus,  lots  of other useful features that have gradually found their way into what was once a relatively
       simple program!

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Run <b>pgn-extract</b> <b>-h</b> to get all the options.

       A complete description of each option can be found in <b>/usr/share/doc/pgn-extract/help.html</b>
