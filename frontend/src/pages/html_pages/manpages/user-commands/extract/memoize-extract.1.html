</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       memoize-extract.pl, memoize-extract.py - Extract extern pages out of the PDF

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>memoize-extract.pl</b> [<u>OPTIONS</u>] <u>document.mmz</u>

       <b>memoize-extract.py</b> [<u>OPTIONS</u>] <u>document.mmz</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>memoize-extract</b>  is  a  script  accompanying  Memoize, a TeX package which allows the author to reuse the
       results of compilation-intensive code such as TikZ pictures.

       Memoize dumps the created externs (boxes containing the typeset material to be  reused)  onto  their  own
       pages  in  the  produced  PDF  file.  It is the job of <b>memoize-extract</b> to extract these extern pages into
       separate PDF files.  At subsequent compilations,  Memoize  will  include  those  extern  files  into  the
       document, without compiling their source again.

       Memoize  communicates  with  <b>memoize-extract</b> through file <u>document.mmz</u>.  When <u>document.tex</u> is compiled to
       produce <u>document.pdf</u>, Memoize produces <u>document.mmz</u>, which records which pages in the  produced  document
       are  extern  pages  and  to  which  extern  files  they  should be extracted.  Therefore, after compiling
       <u>document.tex</u>, the externs should be extracted by <b>memoize-extract</b> <u>document.mmz</u>.

       <u>document.mmz</u>  may  also  be  given   as   document*   or   <u>document.tex</u>.    When   environment   variable
       <u>TEXMF_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY</u>  is  set,  this  filename  is  relative  to the output directory specified by this
       variable.

       <u>document.mmz</u> also records the expected width  and  height  of  each  extern.   In  case  of  a  mismatch,
       <b>memoize-extract</b> refuses to extract the page and removes the extern file if it already exist, and prints a
       warning  message  to  the  standard  error.   The  script also refuses to extract the page if a (c)c-memo
       associated to the extern does not exist.  See also section SECURITY.

       The Perl (.pl) and the Python (.py) version of the script are functionally equivalent.  The  Perl  script
       requires library PDF::API2, and the Python script requires library pdfrw2.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-P,</b> <b>--pdf</b> <u>filename.pdf</u>
              The   externs  will  be  extracted  from  <u>filename.pdf</u>.   By  default,  they  are  extracted  from
              <u>document.pdf</u>.

       <b>-p,</b> <b>--prune</b>
              Remove the extern pages from the PDF after extraction.

       <b>-k,</b> <b>--keep</b>
              Do not modify the <u>document.mmz</u> to mark the externs as extracted.  By default, they  are  commented
              out to prevent double extraction.

       <b>-F,</b> <b>--format</b> <u>latex</u>|<u>plain</u>|<u>context</u>
              When  this option is given, the script assumes that it was called from within a TeX compilation of
              a document in the given format: it prefixes all output by the script name, and creates a log  file
              <u>document.mmz.log</u>, which receives any extraction-related warnings and errors.

       <b>-f,</b> <b>--force</b>
              Extract the extern even if the size-check fails.

       <b>-q,</b> <b>--quiet</b>
              Don’t describe what’s happening.

       <b>-m,</b> <b>--mkdir</b>
              A  paranoid  <u>mkdir</u>  <u>-p</u>.   (No  extraction occurs, <u>document.mmz</u> is interpreted as a directory name,
              which may end in any suffix; no suffix mangling is performed.)

       <b>-V,</b> <b>--version</b>
              Show the Memoize version number and exit.

       <b>-h,</b> <b>--help</b>
              Show help and exit.

</pre><h4><b>SECURITY</b></h4><pre>
       This script respects the restrictions on file input and output imposed by  the  TeX  configuration,  more
       precisely,  the  variables <u>openin_any</u> and <u>openout_any</u> of the <b>kpathsea</b> library (https://tug.org/kpathsea).
       You can inspect the values of these variables by executing kpsewhich -var-value=openin_any and  kpsewhich
       -var-value=openout_any.  The interpretation is as follows:

       <b>a</b> (or <b>y</b> or <b>1</b>) any
              Allows any file to be opened.

       <b>r</b> (or <b>n</b> or <b>0</b>) restricted
              Means disallowing special file names.

       <b>p</b> (or any other value) paranoid
              Means  being really paranoid: disallowing special file names and restricting input/output files to
              be  in  or  below  the  working  directory  or  the  directory   specified   by   <u>TEXMFOUTPUT</u>   or
              <u>TEXMF_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY</u>.   <u>TEXMFOUTPUT</u>  may  be  set  either  in <u>texmf.cnf</u> (e.g. by <b>tlmgr</b>) or as an
              environment variable.  <u>TEXMF_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY</u> may only be set as an environment variables;  it  is
              automatically set by TeX when called by <u>-output-directory</u> option (starting in TeXLive 2024).

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>0</b>      The externs were successfully extracted.  This exit code is returned even if no externs need to be
              extracted, or if <u>document.mmz</u> does not exist.

       <b>10</b>     A  warning  also  reported back to the compilation when given option <b>--format</b>.  Currently, either:
              (i) size-mismatch; (ii) a non-existing associated (c)c-memo file; or (iii) unavailable <u>kpsewhich</u>.

       <b>11</b>     An error also reported back to the compilation when given option <b>--format</b>.  Currently, either: (i)
              a corrupted document PDF, or (ii) a kpathsea permission error.

       Other exit codes are as produced by the underlying scripting language (Perl of Python).
