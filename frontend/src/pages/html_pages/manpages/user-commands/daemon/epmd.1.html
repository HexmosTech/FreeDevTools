       epmd - Erlang Port Mapper Daemon

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>epmd</u> command be used to start the port mapper daemon:

              epmd [-d|-debug] [DbgExtra...] [-address Addresses]
                  [-port No] [-daemon] [-relaxed_command_check]

       It can also be used to communicate with a running port mapper daemon:

              epmd [-d|-debug] [-port No] [-names|-kill|-stop Name]

       This  daemon  acts  as  a  name  server on all hosts involved in distributed Erlang computations. When an
       Erlang node starts, the node has a name and it obtains an address from the host OS kernel. The  name  and
       address  are  sent  to  the  <u>epmd</u>  daemon running on the local host. In a TCP/IP environment, the address
       consists of the IP address and a port number. The node name is an atom on the form of <u>Name@Node</u>. The  job
       of  the  <u>epmd</u>  daemon  is  to  keep  track  of which node name listens on which address. Hence, <u>epmd</u> maps
       symbolic node names to machine addresses.

       The TCP/IP <u>epmd</u> daemon only keeps track of the <u>Name</u> (first) part of an Erlang node name.  The  <u>Host</u>  part
       (whatever  is after the <u>@</u>) is implicit in the node name where the <u>epmd</u> daemon was contacted, as is the IP
       address where the Erlang node can be reached. Consistent and correct TCP naming  services  are  therefore
       required for an Erlang network to function correctly.

       <b>NOTE:</b>  On  Windows  the  maximum  number  of nodes allowed in one epmd instance is 60. This is because of
       limitations in the current implementation. If you need more nodes, you should look into using and  erlang
       based epmd implementation such as Erlang EPMD.

       Starting the port mapper daemon
         The  daemon  is started automatically by command <u><a href="../man1/erl.1.html">erl</a>(1)</u> if the node is to be distributed and no running
         instance is present. If automatically launched  environment  variables  must  be  used  to  change  the
         behavior of the daemon; see section Environment Variables.

         If  argument  <u>-daemon</u>  is not specified, <u>epmd</u> runs as a normal program with the controlling terminal of
         the shell in which it is started. Normally, it is to be run as a daemon.

         Regular startup options are described in section Regular Options.

         The <u>DbgExtra</u> options are described in section DbgExtra Options.

       Communicating with a running port mapper daemon
         Communicating with the running <u>epmd</u> daemon  by  the  <u>epmd</u>  program  is  done  primarily  for  debugging
         purposes.

         The different queries are described in section Interactive options.

   <b>Regular</b> <b>Options</b>
       These  options  are  available  when  starting  the  name  server.  The  name  server is normally started
       automatically by command <u><a href="../man1/erl.1.html">erl</a>(1)</u> (if not already available), but it can also be started at system startup.

       -address List
         Lets this instance of <u>epmd</u> listen only on the comma-separated list of IP addresses and on the  loopback
         address  (which  is  implicitly  added  to the list if it has not been specified). This can also be set
         using environment variable <u>ERL_EPMD_ADDRESS</u>; see section Environment Variables.

       -port No
         Lets this instance of <u>epmd</u> listen to another TCP port than default 4369. This can  also  be  set  using
         environment variable <u>ERL_EPMD_PORT</u>; see section Environment Variables.

       -d | -debug
         Enables  debug  output.  The  more <u>-d</u> flags specified, the more debug output you will get (to a certain
         limit). This option is most useful when the <u>epmd</u> daemon is not started as a daemon.

       -daemon
         Starts <u>epmd</u> detached from the controlling terminal. Logging  ends  up  in  syslog  when  available  and
         correctly  configured.  If the <u>epmd</u> daemon is started at boot, this option is definitely to be used. It
         is also used when command <u>erl</u> automatically starts <u>epmd</u>.

       -relaxed_command_check
         Starts the <u>epmd</u> program with relaxed command checking (mostly for backward compatibility). This affects
         the following:

         •   With relaxed command checking, the <u>epmd</u> daemon can be killed from the local host with, for example,
             command <u>epmd</u> <u>-kill</u> even if active nodes are registered. Normally only daemons with  an  empty  node
             database can be killed with <u>epmd</u> <u>-kill</u>.

         •   Command   <u>epmd</u>  <u>-stop</u>  (and  the  corresponding  messages  to  <u>epmd</u>,  as  can  be  specified  using
             <u>erl_interface:<a href="../man3/ei.3.html">ei</a>(3)</u>) is normally always ignored. This because it  can  cause  a  strange  situation
             where  two  nodes of the same name can be alive at the same time. A node unregisters itself by only
             closing the connection to <u>epmd</u>, which is why command <u>stop</u> was only intended for  use  in  debugging
             situations.

             With relaxed command checking enabled, you can forcibly unregister live nodes.

         Relaxed    command    checking    can    also    be    enabled    by   setting   environment   variable
         <u>ERL_EPMD_RELAXED_COMMAND_CHECK</u> before starting <u>epmd</u>.

         Use relaxed command checking only on systems with very limited interactive usage.

   <b>DbgExtra</b> <b>Options</b>
       <b>NOTE:</b> These options are only for debugging and testing <u>epmd</u> clients. They are not to be  used  in  normal
       operation.

       -packet_timeout Seconds
         Sets  the  number  of  seconds  a  connection  can  be  inactive  before  <u>epmd</u> times out and closes the
         connection. Defaults to 60.

       -delay_accept Seconds
         To simulate a busy server, you can insert a delay between when <u>epmd</u> gets notified that a new connection
         is requested and when the connection gets accepted.

       -delay_write Seconds
         Also a simulation of a busy server. Inserts a delay before a reply is sent.

   <b>Interactive</b> <b>Options</b>
       These options make <u>epmd</u> run as an interactive command, displaying the results of sending  queries  to  an
       already running instance of <u>epmd</u>. The <u>epmd</u> contacted is always on the local node, but option <u>-port</u> can be
       used to select between instances if several are running using different ports on the host.

       -port No
         Contacts the <u>epmd</u> listening on the specified TCP port number (default 4369). This can also be set using
         environment variable <u>ERL_EPMD_PORT</u>; see section Environment Variables.

       -names
         Lists names registered with the currently running <u>epmd</u>.

       -kill
         Kills the currently running <u>epmd</u>.

         Killing   the   running   <u>epmd</u>  is  only  allowed  if  <u>epmd</u>  <u>-names</u>  shows  an  empty  database  or  if
         <u>-relaxed_command_check</u> was specified when the running instance of <u>epmd</u> was started.

         Notice that <u>-relaxed_command_check</u> is specified when starting the daemon that is to accept killing when
         it has live nodes registered. When running <u>epmd</u> interactively, <u>-relaxed_command_check</u> has no effect.  A
         daemon  that  is started without relaxed command checking must be killed using, for example, signals or
         some other OS-specific method if it has active clients registered.

       -stop Name
         Forcibly unregisters a live node from the <u>epmd</u> database.

         This command can only be used when contacting <u>epmd</u> instances started with flag <u>-relaxed_command_check</u>.

         Notice that relaxed command checking must enabled for the <u>epmd</u>  daemon  contacted.  When  running  <u>epmd</u>
         interactively, <u>-relaxed_command_check</u> has no effect.

   <b>Environment</b> <b>Variables</b>
       ERL_EPMD_ADDRESS
         Can be set to a comma-separated list of IP addresses, in which case the <u>epmd</u> daemon will listen only on
         the  specified address(es) and on the loopback address (which is implicitly added to the list if it has
         not been specified). The default behavior is to listen on all available IP addresses.

       ERL_EPMD_PORT
         Can contain the port number <u>epmd</u> will use. The default port will work fine in most cases.  A  different
         port  can  be specified to allow several instances of <u>epmd</u>, representing independent clusters of nodes,
         to co-exist on the same host. All nodes in a cluster must use the same <u>epmd</u> port number.

       ERL_EPMD_RELAXED_COMMAND_CHECK
         If set before start, the <u>epmd</u> daemon behaves as  if  option  <u>-relaxed_command_check</u>  was  specified  at
         startup.  Consequently,  if  this  option  is  set  before  starting  the  Erlang  virtual machine, the
         automatically started <u>epmd</u> accepts the <u>-kill</u> and <u>-stop</u> commands without restrictions.

   <b>Logging</b>
       On some operating systems <u>syslog</u> will be used for error reporting when <u>epmd</u> runs as a daemon.  To  enable
       the error logging, you must edit the /etc/syslog.conf file and add an entry:

                !epmd
                *.*&lt;TABs&gt;/var/log/epmd.log

       where <u>&lt;TABs&gt;</u> are at least one real tab character. Spaces are silently ignored.

   <b>Access</b> <b>Restrictions</b>
       The  <u>epmd</u>  daemon  accepts  messages  from  both the local host and remote hosts. However, only the query
       commands are answered (and acted upon) if the query comes from a remote host. It is always  an  error  to
       try  to  register  a  node  name  if the client is not a process on the same host as the <u>epmd</u> instance is
       running on. Such requests are considered hostile and the connection is closed immediately.

       The following queries are accepted from remote nodes:

       •   Port queries, that is, on which port the node with a specified name listens

       •   Name listing, that is, gives a list of all names registered on the host

       To restrict access further, firewall software must be used.
