</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       mpstore - store and transfer mpd state between daemons

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       mpstore [host] &gt; file

       mpload [host] &lt; file

       mpcp [src] dest

       mpmv [src] dest

       mpswap [A] B

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       These commands allow saving, loading, and transferring state between mpd daemons running on different
       hosts.

       <b>mpstore</b> dumps a daemon's state to stdout.

       <b>mpload</b> loads a state dump from stdin and sends it to a daemon.

       <b>mpcp</b> copies the state from the src daemon to the dest daemon, causing it to begin to play the same song
       as the src daemon, at the same position.

       <b>mpmv</b> moves the state, so the dest daemon is left playing what the src daemon was playing, and the src
       daemon is paused.

       <b>mpswap</b> exchanges the state of daemons A and B, swapping what they're playing.

       The first hostname passed to each command can be omitted, if it is then the MPD_HOST environment variable
       will be used. Like the MPD_HOST variable, the hostname can be of the form "password@hostname" to specify
       a password.  If any hostname is "-", the MPD_HOST setting will be used.

       The full list of state that is handled is:

       the contents of the playlist
       the playback state (playing, paused, stopped)
       the currently playing song
       the position within the playing song
       the volume control
       the repeat, random, and cross fade settings

</pre><h4><b>LIMITATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The  host that state is transferred to must have the playing song available in its library, with the same
       filename. It's ok if some other songs in the playlist are not available; such songs will be skipped.

       <b>mpcp</b> cannot perfectly synchronise playback between the two daemons.  Network latency and  timing  prevent
       this.  It  should  manage  better  than  0.5 second accuracy. If you need better accuracy of synchronised
       playback, you should probably use Pulse Audio.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       The file format is not the same that mpd uses for saving its own state, which would be nice.
