</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       qping - check application status of Grid Engine daemons.

</pre><h4><b>SYNTAX</b></h4><pre>
       <b>qping</b>  [<b>-help</b>]  [<b>-noalias</b>]  [<b>-ssl</b>|<b>-tcp</b>] [[[<b>-i</b> <u>interval</u>] [<b>-info</b>] [<b>-f</b>]] | [[ <b>-dump_tag</b> <u>tag</u> [<u>param</u>]] [<b>-dump</b>]
       [<b>-nonewline</b>]]] <u>host</u> <u>port</u> <u>name</u> <u>id</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Qping</u> is used to validate the runtime status of a Grid Engine service daemon.  The  current  Grid  Engine
       implementation  allows  one to query the SGE_QMASTER daemon and any running SGE_EXECD daemon. The command
       is used to send a SIM (Status Information Message) to the destination daemon. The communication layer  of
       the specified daemon will respond with a SIRM (Status Information Response Message) which contains status
       information  about  that daemon.  It also has options allow an administrator to observe the communication
       protocol data flow of a Grid Engine service daemon.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>-f</b>
       Show full status information on each ping interval.

       <u>First</u> <u>output</u> <u>line:</u> The first output line shows the date and time of the request.

       <u>SIRM</u> <u>version:</u> Internal version number of the SIRM (Status Information Response Message)

       <u>SIRM</u> <u>message</u> <u>id:</u> Current message id for this connection

       <u>start</u> <u>time:</u> Start time of daemon. The format is as follows:

       MM/DD/YYYY HH:MM:SS (seconds since 01.01.1970)

       <u>run</u> <u>time</u> <u>[s]:</u> Run time in seconds since start time

       <u>messages</u> <u>in</u> <u>read</u> <u>buffer:</u> Number of buffered messages in the communication read buffer. The  messages  are
       buffered  for the application (daemon). When this number grows too large the daemon is not able to handle
       all messages sent to it.

       <u>messages</u> <u>in</u> <u>write</u> <u>buffer:</u> Number of buffered messages in the communication write buffer. The messages are
       sent from the application (daemon) to the connected clients, but the communication layer wasn't  able  to
       send the messages yet. If this number grows too large, the communication layer isn't able to send them as
       fast as the application (daemon) wants the messages to be sent.

       <u>number</u>  <u>of</u>  <u>connected</u> <u>clients:</u> This is the number of clients actually connected to this daemon, including
       the current qping connection.

       <u>status:</u> The status value of the daemon. This value depends on the application which replies to the  qping
       request.   If  the  application  does  not  provide  any  information, the status is 99999.  Here are the
       possible status information values for the Grid Engine daemons:

          qmaster:

             <u>0</u> There is no unusual timing situation.

             <u>1</u> One or more threads has reached warning timeout. This may happen when at least  one  thread  does
             not  increment  its  time  stamp  for  an  usually  long time. A possible reason for this is a high
             workload for this thread.

             <u>2</u> One or more threads has reached error timeout. This may happen when at least one thread  has  not
             incremented its time stamp for longer than 10 minutes.

             <u>3</u> The time measurement is not initialized.

          execd:

             <u>0</u> There is no unusual timing situation.

             <u>1</u>  Dispatcher  has  reached warning timeout. This may happen when the dispatcher does not increment
             its time stamp for an unusually long time. A possible reason for this is a high workload.

             <u>2</u> Dispatcher has reached error timeout. This may happen when the dispatcher has not incremented its
             time stamp for longer than 10 minutes.

             <u>3</u> The time measurement is not initialized.

       <u>info:</u> Status message of the daemon. This value depends on the application  which  replies  to  the  qping
       request.   If the application does not provide any information the info message is "not available".  Here
       are the possible status information values for the Grid Engine daemons:

          qmaster:

             The info message contains information about the qmaster threads, followed by  a  thread  state  and
             time  information.  Each  time  one  of  the  known  threads  passes through its main loop the time
             information is updated. Since the qmaster has two message threads, every message thread updates the
             time. This means the timeout for the message thread (MT) can only occur when no message  thread  is
             active anymore:

                THREAD_NAME: THREAD_STATE (THREAD_TIME)

                THREAD_NAME:
                   MAIN: Main thread
                   signaler: Signal thread
                   event_master: Event master thread
                   timer: Timer thread
                   worker: Worker thread
                   listener: Listener thread
                   scheduler: Scheduler thread
                   jvm: Java thread
                The thread names above (other than MAIN) will be followed by a 3 digit number.

                THREAD_STATE:
                   R: Running
                   W: Warning
                   E: Error

                THREAD_TIME:
                   Time since last timestamp updating.

             After  the  dispatcher  information  comes  an  additional  information  string which describes the
             complete application status.

          execd:

             The info message contains information for the execd job dispatcher:
                dispatcher: STATE (TIME)

             STATE:
                R: Running
                W: Warning
                E: Error

             TIME:
                Time since last timestamp updating.

          After the thread information comes statistics  on  the  <u><a href="../man3/malloc.3.html">malloc</a></u>(3)  state,  if  available,  e.g.  using
          <u><a href="../man3/mallinfo.3.html">mallinfo</a></u>(3).   If  Grid Engine is built with the <u><a href="../man3/jemalloc.3.html">jemalloc</a></u>(3) allocator, the statistics are not printed
          by default because they are in a different, verbose format.  See <b>print_malloc_info</b> in <u><a href="../man5/sge_conf.5.html">sge_conf</a></u>(5).

    <u>Monitor:</u> If available (see <b>MONITOR_TIME</b> In <b>qmaster_params</b> in <u><a href="../man5/sge_conf.5.html">sge_conf</a></u>(5)), displays statistics  on  threads.
    The data for each thread are displayed in one line. The format of this line can be changed at any time. Only
    the master implements monitoring.

   <b>-help</b>
       Prints a list of all options.

   <b>-i</b> <b>interval</b>
       Set  qping  interval.   The  default  interval  is  one second. Qping will send a SIM (Status Information
       Message) after each interval.

   <b>-info</b>
       Show full status information (see <b>-f</b> for more information) and exit. The exit value 0 indicates no error.
       On errors qping returns with 1.

   <b>-noalias</b>
       Ignore host_aliases file, which is located at <u>&lt;sge_root&gt;/&lt;cell&gt;/common/host_aliases.</u>  If this  option  is
       used it is not necessary to set any Grid Engine environment variable.

   <b>-ssl</b>
       This  option  can  be  used  to  specify  an  SSL (Secure Socket Layer) configuration. qping will use the
       configuration to connect to services running SSL. If the Grid Engine settings file is  not  sourced,  you
       have  to use the <b>-noalias</b> option to bypass the need for the SGE_ROOT environment variable.  The following
       environment variables are used to specify your certificates:
         SSL_CA_CERT_FILE - CA certificate file
         SSL_CERT_FILE    - certificates file
         SSL_KEY_FILE     - key file
         SSL_RAND_FILE    - rand file

   <b>-tcp</b>
       This option is used to select TCP/IP as the protocol used to connect to other services.

   <b>-nonewline</b>
       Dump output will not have a linebreak within a message, and binary messages are not unpacked.

   <b>-dump</b>
       This option allows an administrator to observe the communication protocol data  flow  of  a  Grid  Engine
       service  daemon.  The command must be started as root, and on the host where the daemon to be observed is
       running.

       The output is written to stdout. The environment variable "SGE_QPING_OUTPUT_FORMAT" can be  set  to  hide
       columns,  set  a  default  column width, or to set a hostname output format. The value of the environment
       variable can be set to any combination of the following specifiers separated by a space character:
              "h:X"   -&gt; hide column X
              "s:X"   -&gt; show column X
              "w:X:Y" -&gt; set width of column X to Y
              "hn:X"  -&gt; set hostname output parameter X.
                         X values are "long" or "short"
       Run <b>qping</b> <b>-help</b> to see which columns are available.

   <b>-dump_tag</b> <u><b>tag</b></u> [<u><b>param</b></u>]
       This option has the same meaning as -dump, but can provide more information by specifying the debug level
       and message types <u>qping</u> should print:
          <b>-dump_tag</b> <b>ALL</b> <u>debug</u> <u>level</u>
             This option shows all possible debug messages (APP+MSG) for the debug levels, ERROR, WARNING, INFO,
             DEBUG and DPRINTF. The contacted service must support this kind of debugging.  This option  is  not
             currently implemented.
          <b>-dump_tag</b> <b>APP</b> <u>debug</u> <u>level</u>
             This option shows only application debug messages for the debug levels, ERROR, WARNING, INFO, DEBUG
             and  DPRINTF.  The  contacted  service  must  support  this  kind of debugging.  This option is not
             currently implemented.
          <b>-dump_tag</b> <b>MSG</b>
             This option has the same behavior as the <b>-dump</b> option.

   <u><b>host</b></u>
       Host where daemon is running.

   <u><b>port</b></u>
       Port which daemon has bound (used sge_qmaster/sge_execd port number).

   <u><b>name</b></u>
       Name of communication endpoint  ("qmaster"  or  "execd").  A  communication  endpoint  is  a  triplet  of
       hostname/endpoint name/endpoint id (e.g. hostA/qmaster/1 or subhost/qstat/4).

   <b>id</b>
       Id of communication endpoint ("1" for daemons)
