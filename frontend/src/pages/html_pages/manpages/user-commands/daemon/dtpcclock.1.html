</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       dtpcclock - DTPC daemon task for managing scheduled events

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>dtpcclock</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>dtpcclock</b> is a background "daemon" task that periodically performs scheduled DTPC activities.  It is
       spawned automatically by <b>dtpcadmin</b> in response to the 's' command that starts operation of the DTPC
       protocol, and it is terminated by <b>dtpcadmin</b> in response to an 'x' (STOP) command.

       Once per second, <b>dtpcclock</b> takes the following action:

           First it executes all DTPC events scheduled to occur at any time up to the current moment:

               DTPC ADUs for which an expected positive acknowledgment has not yet arrived are retransmitted.

               Received DTPC ADUs whose time to live has elapsed are deleted.

           Then <b>dtpcclock</b> increases the ages of all DTPC ADUs pending transmission and initiates transmission of
           each such ADU whose age now equals or exceeds its aggregation time limit.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       0   <b>dtpcclock</b>  terminated, for reasons noted in the <b>ion.log</b> file.  If this termination was not commanded,
           investigate and solve the problem identified in the log file and use <b>dtpcadmin</b> to restart <b>dtpcclock</b>.

       1   <b>dtpcclock</b> was unable to attach to DTPC protocol operations, probably because <b>dtpcadmin</b>  has  not  yet
           been run.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       No configuration files are needed.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       No environment variables apply.

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       The following diagnostics may be issued to the <b>ion.log</b> log file:

       dtpcclock can't initialize DTPC.
           <b>dtpcadmin</b> has not yet initialized DTPC protocol operations.

       Can't send finished adu.
           An unrecoverable database error was encountered.  <b>dtpcclock</b> terminates.

       Can't stop aggregation for adu.
           An unrecoverable database error was encountered.  <b>dtpcclock</b> terminates.

       Could not scan outbound Adus
           An unrecoverable database error was encountered.  <b>dtpcclock</b> terminates.
