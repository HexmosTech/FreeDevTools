</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       git-fsmonitor--daemon - A Built-in Filesystem Monitor

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>git</u> <u>fsmonitor--daemon</u> start
       <u>git</u> <u>fsmonitor--daemon</u> run
       <u>git</u> <u>fsmonitor--daemon</u> stop
       <u>git</u> <u>fsmonitor--daemon</u> status

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       A daemon to watch the working directory for file and directory changes using platform-specific filesystem
       notification facilities.

       This daemon communicates directly with commands like <b>git</b> <b>status</b> using the <b>simple</b> <b>IPC</b>[1] interface instead
       of the slower <b><a href="../man5/githooks.5.html">githooks</a></b>(5) interface.

       This daemon is built into Git so that no third-party tools are required.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       start
           Starts a daemon in the background.

       run
           Runs a daemon in the foreground.

       stop
           Stops the daemon running in the current working directory, if present.

       status
           Exits with zero status if a daemon is watching the current working directory.

</pre><h4><b>REMARKS</b></h4><pre>
       This daemon is a long running process used to watch a single working directory and maintain a list of the
       recently changed files and directories. Performance of commands such as <b>git</b> <b>status</b> can be increased if
       they just ask for a summary of changes to the working directory and can avoid scanning the disk.

       When <b>core.fsmonitor</b> is set to <b>true</b> (see <b><a href="../man1/git-config.1.html">git-config</a></b>(1)) commands, such as <b>git</b> <b>status</b>, will ask the daemon
       for changes and automatically start it (if necessary).

       For more information see the "File System Monitor" section in <b><a href="../man1/git-update-index.1.html">git-update-index</a></b>(1).

</pre><h4><b>CAVEATS</b></h4><pre>
       The fsmonitor daemon does not currently know about submodules and does not know to filter out filesystem
       events that happen within a submodule. If fsmonitor daemon is watching a super repo and a file is
       modified within the working directory of a submodule, it will report the change (as happening against the
       super repo). However, the client will properly ignore these extra events, so performance may be affected
       but it will not cause an incorrect result.

       By default, the fsmonitor daemon refuses to work with network-mounted repositories; this may be
       overridden by setting <b>fsmonitor.allowRemote</b> to <b>true</b>. Note, however, that the fsmonitor daemon is not
       guaranteed to work correctly with all network-mounted repositories, so such use is considered
       experimental.

       On Mac OS, the inter-process communication (IPC) between various Git commands and the fsmonitor daemon is
       done via a Unix domain socket (UDS) — a special type of file — which is supported by native Mac OS
       filesystems, but not on network-mounted filesystems, NTFS, or FAT32. Other filesystems may or may not
       have the needed support; the fsmonitor daemon is not guaranteed to work with these filesystems and such
       use is considered experimental.

       By default, the socket is created in the <b>.git</b> directory. However, if the <b>.git</b> directory is on a
       network-mounted filesystem, it will instead be created at <b>$HOME/.git-fsmonitor-</b>* unless <b>$HOME</b> itself is
       on a network-mounted filesystem, in which case you must set the configuration variable
       <b>fsmonitor.socketDir</b> to the path of a directory on a Mac OS native filesystem in which to create the
       socket file.

       If none of the above directories (<b>.git</b>, <b>$HOME</b>, or <b>fsmonitor.socketDir</b>) is on a native Mac OS file
       filesystem the fsmonitor daemon will report an error that will cause the daemon and the currently running
       command to exit.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       Everything below this line in this section is selectively included from the <b><a href="../man1/git-config.1.html">git-config</a></b>(1) documentation.
       The content is the same as what’s found there:

       fsmonitor.allowRemote
           By default, the fsmonitor daemon refuses to work with network-mounted repositories. Setting
           <b>fsmonitor.allowRemote</b> to <b>true</b> overrides this behavior. Only respected when <b>core.fsmonitor</b> is set to
           <b>true</b>.

       fsmonitor.socketDir
           This Mac OS-specific option, if set, specifies the directory in which to create the Unix domain
           socket used for communication between the fsmonitor daemon and various Git commands. The directory
           must reside on a native Mac OS filesystem. Only respected when <b>core.fsmonitor</b> is set to <b>true</b>.
