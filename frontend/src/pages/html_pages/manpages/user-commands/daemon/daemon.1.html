</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u><b><a href="../man1/daemon.1.html">daemon</a></b>(1)</u> turns other processes into daemons. There are many tasks that need to be performed to correctly
       set up a daemon process. This can be tedious. <u>daemon</u> performs these tasks for other processes.

       The preparatory tasks that <u>daemon</u> performs for other processes are:

       •   First,  revoke  any  setuid  or setgid privileges that <u>daemon</u> may have been installed with (by system
           administrators who laugh in the face of danger).

       •   Process command line options.

       •   Change the root directory if the --chroot option was supplied.

       •   Change the process uid and gid if the --user option was supplied. Only <u>root</u> can use this option. Note
           that the uid of <u>daemon</u> itself is changed, rather than just changing the uid of the client process.

       •   Read the system configuration file(s)  (/etc/daemon.conf  and  /etc/daemon.conf.d/*  by  default,  or
           specified  by  the  --config option), unless the --noconfig option was supplied. Then read the user's
           personal configuration file(s) (<a href="file:~/.daemonrc">~/.daemonrc</a> and <a href="file:~/.daemonrc.d/">~/.daemonrc.d/</a>*), if any.  Generic options that apply
           to all daemons are processed first, then options that are specific to the daemon with the given name.
           <b>Note:</b> <b>The</b> <b>root</b> <b>directory</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>user</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>set</b> <b>before</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>configuration</b> <b>file(s)</b>  <b>can</b>  <b>be</b>
           <b>attempted,</b> <b>so</b> <b>neither</b> <b>the</b> <b>--chroot</b> <b>nor</b> <b>--user</b> <b>options</b> <b>may</b> <b>appear</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>configuration</b> <b>file.</b>

           On  <u>BSD</u>  systems  (except <u>macOS</u>), the system configuration file(s) are /usr/local/etc/daemon.conf and
           /usr/local/etc/daemon.conf.d/* by default.

           On   <u>macOS</u>,   when   installed   via    <u>macports</u>,    the    system    configuration    file(s)    are
           /opt/local/etc/daemon.conf and /opt/local/etc/daemon.conf.d/*.

       •   Disable core file generation to prevent leaking potentially sensitive information in daemons that are
           run by <u>root</u> (unless the --core option was supplied).

       •   Become a daemon process:

           •   If  <u>daemon</u>  was  not  invoked  by <u><b><a href="../man8/init.8.html">init</a></b>(8)</u> (i.e. parent process id 1) or <u><b><a href="../man8/inetd.8.html">inetd</a></b>(8)</u> (i.e. stdin is a
               socket):

               •   Ignore SIGHUP signals in case the current process session leader terminates while attached to
                   a controlling terminal, causing us to receive a SIGHUP signal before we start our own process
                   session below.

                   This can happen when <u>daemon</u> was invoked interactively via the shell builtin exec.  When  this
                   initial  process  terminates  below,  the  terminal  emulator  that  invoked  the  shell also
                   terminates, so <u>daemon</u> need to protect itself from that.

               •   Background the process to lose process group leadership.

               •   Start a new process session.

               •   Background the process again to lose process session leadership. Under  <u>SVR4</u>,  this  prevents
                   the process from ever gaining a controlling terminal.  This is only necessary under <u>SVR4</u>, but
                   is always done for simplicity.  Note that ignoring SIGHUP signals earlier means that when the
                   newly  created  process session leader terminates, then even if it has a controlling terminal
                   open, the newly backgrounded process won't receive the corresponding SIGHUP  signal  that  is
                   sent to all processes in the process session's foreground process group, because it inherited
                   signal dispositions from the initial process.

           •   Change the current directory to the root directory so as not to hamper umounts.

           •   Clear the <u>umask</u> to enable explicit file creation modes.

           •   Close  all open file descriptors. If <u>daemon</u> was invoked by <u><b><a href="../man8/inetd.8.html">inetd</a></b>(8)</u>, stdin, stdout and stderr are
               left open, because they are open to a socket.

           •   Open stdin, stdout and stderr to /dev/null, in case  something  requires  them  to  be  open.  Of
               course, this is not done if <u>daemon</u> was invoked by <u><b><a href="../man8/inetd.8.html">inetd</a></b>(8)</u>.

           •   If the --name option was supplied, create and lock a file containing the process id of the <u>daemon</u>
               process.  The  presence of this locked file prevents two instances of a daemon with the same name
               from running at the same time. The default location of the pidfile is <a href="file:/var/run">/var/run</a> for <u>root</u> (<a href="file:/etc">/etc</a>  on
               <u>Solaris</u>,  /opt/local/var/run on <u>macOS</u> when installed via <u>macports</u>), and <a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a> for normal users. If
               the --pidfiles option was supplied, its argument specifies the directory  in  which  the  pidfile
               will  be  placed.  If  the  --pidfile option was supplied, its argument specifies the name of the
               pidfile and the directory in which it will be placed.

       •   If the --umask option was supplied, set the <u>umask</u> to its argument, which must be a valid  three-digit
           octal  mode. Otherwise, set the umask to 022, to prevent clients from accidentally creating group- or
           world-writable files.

       •   Set the current directory if the --chdir option was supplied.

       •   Spawn the client command and wait for it to terminate. The client command can be specified as command
           line arguments, or as the argument of the --command option. If both the --command option and  command
           line  arguments are present, the client command is the result of appending the command line arguments
           to the argument of the --command option.

       •   If the --output, --stdout and/or --stderr options were supplied, the client's standard output  and/or
           standard error are captured by <u>daemon</u>, and are sent to the respective <u>syslog</u> destinations.

       •   When  the  client  terminates, <u>daemon</u> respawns it if the --respawn option was supplied. If the client
           ran for less than 300 seconds (or the value of the --acceptable option), then <u>daemon</u> sees this  as  a
           failure.  It  will  attempt  to  restart  the client up to five times (or the value of the --attempts
           option), before waiting for 300 seconds (or the value of the --delay option). This gives  the  system
           administrator  the  chance  to  correct  whatever  is preventing the client from running successfully
           without overloading system resources. If the --limit option was supplied, <u>daemon</u> terminates after the
           specified number of respawn attempt bursts.  The default is zero, which means never  give  up,  never
           surrender.

           When the client terminates, and the --respawn option wasn't supplied, <u>daemon</u> terminates as well.

       •   If  <u>daemon</u>  receives  a  SIGTERM  signal  (e.g.  from a separate invocation of <u>daemon</u> with the --stop
           option), it propagates the signal to the client and then terminates.

       •   If <u>daemon</u> receives a SIGUSR1 signal (from a separate invocation of <u>daemon</u> with the --restart option),
           it sends a SIGTERM signal to the client. If it was started with  the  --respawn  option,  the  client
           process will be restarted after it is terminated by the SIGTERM signal.

       •   If  the  --foreground  option was supplied, the client process is run as a foreground process, and is
           not turned into a daemon at all. If <u>daemon</u> is connected to a terminal, then the client  process  will
           also  be  connected  to  it.  If  <u>daemon</u>  is  not connected to a terminal, but the client needs to be
           connected to a terminal, use the --pty option.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       -h, --help
           Display a help message and exit.

       -V, --version
           Display a version message and exit.

       -v<u>[level]</u>, --verbose<u>[=level]</u>
           Set the message verbosity level to <u>level</u> (or 1 if <u>level</u> is  not  supplied).  This  only  effects  the
           --running and --list options.

       -d<u>[level]</u>, --debug<u>[=level]</u>
           Set  the  debug  message  level  to <u>level</u> (or 1 if <u>level</u> is not supplied).  Level 1 traces high-level
           function calls. Level 2 traces lower-level function calls and shows configuration information.  Level
           3 adds environment variables. Level 9 adds every return value from <u><b><a href="../man2/select.2.html">select</a></b>(2)</u>. Debug messages are sent
           to   the  destination  specified  by  the  --dbglog  option  (by  default,  the  <u><b><a href="../man3/syslog.3.html">syslog</a></b>(3)</u>  facility,
           daemon.debug).

       -C <u>path</u>, --config=<u>path</u>
           Specify  the  system  configuration  file  to  use.  By  default,  /etc/daemon.conf  is  the   system
           configuration  file, if it exists and is not group- or world-writable, and does not exist in a group-
           or world-writable directory. The configuration file lets you predefine  options  that  apply  to  all
           clients, and to specifically named clients.

           As  well  as  the  system  configuration  file,  additional configuration files will be read from the
           directory whose  path  matches  the  system  configuration  file  with  ".d"  appended  to  it  (e.g.
           /etc/daemon.conf.d).  Any  file  in  that  directory  whose name starts with a dot character (".") is
           ignored.  The same checks as described above apply to these files as well.

           On <u>BSD</u> systems (except <u>macOS</u>), the system configuration file(s)  are  /usr/local/etc/daemon.conf  and
           /usr/local/etc/daemon.conf.d/* by default.

           On    <u>macOS</u>,    when    installed    via    <u>macports</u>,    the   system   configuration   file(s)   are
           /opt/local/etc/daemon.conf and /opt/local/etc/daemon.conf.d/*.

       -N, --noconfig
           Bypass the system configuration files, /etc/daemon.conf and  /etc/daemon.conf.d/*.  Only  the  user's
           <a href="file:~/.daemonrc">~/.daemonrc</a> and <a href="file:~/.daemonrc.d/">~/.daemonrc.d/</a>* configuration files will be read (if they exist).

       -n <u>name</u>, --name=<u>name</u>
           Create  and lock a pidfile (<u>name</u>.pid), ensuring that only one daemon with the given <u>name</u> is active at
           the same time. The standard  location  of  the  pidfile  is  <a href="file:/var/run">/var/run</a>  for  root  (<a href="file:/etc">/etc</a>  on  <u>Solaris</u>,
           /opt/local/var/run  on  <u>macOS</u>  when installed via <u>macports</u>), and <a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a> for normal users. This location
           can be overridden with the <u>--pidfiles</u> option.

           The name may only consist of the following characters:

               -._abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789

           While a named daemon's client process is running, there will also be a separate pidfile to record the
           process id of the client process. Its filename will be the same as the <u>daemon</u> pidfile's, except  that
           the  filename  extension  will be .clientpid rather than .pid. The only reason that there should be a
           .pid file, with no .clientpid file, is during the delay between respawn attempts bursts.

       -X <u>"cmd"</u>, --command=<u>"cmd"</u>
           Specify the client command as an option. If a command  is  specified  along  with  its  name  in  the
           configuration file, then a daemon can be invoked merely by mentioning its name:

               daemon --name ftumch

           <b>Note:</b> If the client command is specified with the --command option, either in the configuration file,
           or  on  the  command  line, then any additional command line arguments on the <u>daemon</u> command line are
           appended to the client command that is specified with the --command option.

       -P <u>/dir</u>, --pidfiles=<u>/dir</u>
           Override the standard pidfile location. The standard pidfile location is <a href="file:/var/run">/var/run</a> for root  (<a href="file:/etc">/etc</a>  on
           <u>Solaris</u>, /opt/local/var/run on <u>macOS</u> when installed via <u>macports</u>), and <a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a> for normal users.

           This  option  only affects the --name and --list options. Use this option if these standard locations
           are unacceptable, but make sure that you don't forget where you put your  pidfiles.  This  option  is
           best used in configuration files, or in shell scripts, rather than on an interactive command line.

           The pidfile location will be created automatically only if it is within the user's home directory.

       -F <u>/path</u>, --pidfile=<u>/path</u>
           Override  the  standard  pidfile  name  and  location.  The  standard  pidfile  location is described
           immediately above. The standard pidfile name is the argument of the --name option followed  by  .pid.
           Use  this  option  if the standard pidfile name and location are unacceptable, but make sure that you
           don't forget where you put your pidfile. This option is best used in configuration files, or in shell
           scripts, rather than on an interactive command line.

           The pidfile location will be created automatically only if it is within the user's home directory.

       -u <u>user[:[group]]</u>, --user=<u>user[:[group]]</u>
           Run the client as a different user (and group). This only works for <u>root</u>.  If the argument includes a
           <u>:group</u> specifier, <u>daemon</u> will assume the specified group and no other. Otherwise, <u>daemon</u> will  assume
           all groups that the specified user is in. For backwards compatibility, "." may be used instead of ":"
           to  separate  the  user  and  group but since "." can appear in user and group names, ambiguities can
           arise such as using --user=<u>u.g</u> when users <u>u</u> and <u>u.g</u> and group <u>g</u> all exist. With  such  an  ambiguity,
           <u>daemon</u> will assume the user <u>u</u> and group <u>g</u>. Use --user=<u>u.g:</u> instead for the other interpretation.

       -R <u>path</u>, --chroot=<u>path</u>
           Change  the root directory to <u>path</u> before running the client. On some systems, only <u>root</u> can do this.
           Note that the path to the client program and to the configuration file (if any) must be  relative  to
           the new root path.

       -D <u>path</u>, --chdir=<u>path</u>
           Change  the current directory to <u>path</u> before running the client. The default current directory is the
           root directory (possibly after <u>chroot</u>).

       -m <u>umask</u>, --umask=<u>umask</u>
           Change the umask to <u>umask</u> before running the client. <u>umask</u> must be a valid octal  mode.  The  default
           umask is 022.

       -e <u>"var=val"</u>, --env=<u>"var=val"</u>
           Set  an  environment variable for the client process. This option can be used any number of times. If
           it is used, only the supplied environment variables are passed to the client process. Otherwise,  the
           client process inherits the current set of environment variables.

       -i, --inherit
           Explicitly  inherit  environment  variables.  This is only needed when the --env option is used. When
           this option is used, the --env option adds to the inherited environment, rather than replacing it.

       -U, --unsafe
           Allow reading an unsafe configuration file, and allow  the  execution  of  an  unsafe  executable.  A
           configuration  file  or executable is considered to be unsafe if it is group- or world-writable or is
           in a directory that is group- or world-writable (following symbolic links). If  an  executable  is  a
           script  that  is  interpreted  by  another  executable,  then  it  is  considered to be unsafe if the
           interpreter is unsafe. If the interpreter is <a href="file:///usr/lib/w3m/cgi-bin/w3mman2html.cgi?env">/usr/bin/env</a> (with an argument that is a command name to
           be searched for in $PATH), then that command must be safe. By default, <u><b><a href="../man1/daemon.1.html">daemon</a></b>(1)</u> will refuse to  read
           an  unsafe  configuration  file  or  to  execute  an  unsafe executable when run by <u>root</u>. This option
           overrides that behaviour and hence should never be used.

       -S, --safe
           Disallow reading an unsafe configuration file, and disallow the execution of an unsafe executable. By
           default, <u><b><a href="../man1/daemon.1.html">daemon</a></b>(1)</u> will allow reading an unsafe configuration file, and allow  the  execution  of  an
           unsafe executable, when run by normal users. This option overrides that behaviour.

       -c, --core
           Allow  the  client to create a core file. This should only be used for debugging, as it could lead to
           security-related information disclosures by daemons run by <u>root</u>.

       --nocore
           By default, clients are prevented from creating a core file. If the --core option has been used in  a
           configuration file to apply to all named daemons, then this option can be used to restore the default
           behaviour for specific named daemons.

       -r, --respawn
           Respawn  the  client  when  it  terminates.  Without this option, the termination of a client process
           causes <u>daemon</u> itself to terminate as well.

       -a <u>#</u>, --acceptable=<u>#</u>
           Specify the minimum acceptable duration of a client process, in seconds.  This  option  can  only  be
           used with the --respawn option. If a client process terminates before this threshold is reached, then
           it  is  considered to have failed. The default value is 300 seconds. It cannot be set to less than 10
           seconds, except by <u>root</u> when used in conjunction with the --idiot option.

       -A <u>#</u>, --attempts=<u>#</u>
           Specify the number of attempts to respawn before delaying. This option can  only  be  used  with  the
           --respawn  option. The default value is 5. It cannot be set to more than 100 attempts, except by <u>root</u>
           when used in conjunction with the --idiot option.

       -L <u>#</u>, --delay=<u>#</u>
           Specify the delay in seconds between each burst of respawn attempts. This option  can  only  be  used
           with the --respawn option. The default value is 300 seconds. It cannot be set to less than 10 seconds
           except by <u>root</u> when used in conjunction with the --idiot option.

       -M <u>#</u>, --limit=<u>#</u>
           Specify  a  limit  to  the  number  of  respawn attempt bursts. This option can only be used with the
           --respawn option. The default value is 0, which means no limit.

       --idiot
           Turn on idiot mode in which <u>daemon</u> will not enforce the minimum or maximum values normally imposed on
           the --acceptable, --attempts and --delay options. The --idiot option must appear before any of  these
           options. Only the <u>root</u> user may use this option, because it can turn a slight misconfiguration into a
           lot of wasted CPU energy and log messages, somewhat akin to a self-inflicted denial of service.

           Idiot  mode  also allows the <u>root</u> user to expand environment variable notation (e.g. $VAR and ${VAR})
           in command line option arguments, and  in  configuration  files.  By  default,  internal  environment
           variable  expansion  is  only  performed  for  normal users. Note that this doesn't apply to any such
           expansion performed earlier by the shell that invokes <u><b><a href="../man1/daemon.1.html">daemon</a></b>(1)</u>. See the EXPANSION section below  for
           more details.

       -f, --foreground
           Run the client in the foreground. The client is not turned into a daemon.

       -p<u>[noecho]</u>, --pty<u>[=noecho]</u>
           Connect  the  client to a pseudo terminal. This option can only be used with the --foreground option.
           This is the default when the --foreground option is supplied and <u>daemon</u>'s standard input is connected
           to a terminal. This option is only  necessary  when  the  client  process  must  be  connected  to  a
           controlling  terminal,  but  <u>daemon</u>  itself  has  been  run without a controlling terminal (e.g. from
           <u><b><a href="../man8/cron.8.html">cron</a></b>(8)</u> or a pipeline).

           If the noecho argument is supplied with this option, the client's side of the pseudo terminal will be
           set to noecho mode. Use this only if there really is a terminal involved and input  is  being  echoed
           twice.

       -B, --bind
           Automatically  terminate  the  client  process  (and  <u><b><a href="../man1/daemon.1.html">daemon</a></b>(1)</u>  itself)  as  soon as the user has no
           <u><b><a href="../man8/systemd-logind.8.html">systemd-logind</a></b>(8)</u> (or <u><b><a href="../man8/elogind.8.html">elogind</a></b>(8)</u>) user sessions. In other words,  automatically  terminate  when  the
           user  logs  out.  If  the  user  has no sessions to start with, the client process will be terminated
           immediately.

           This option is only available  on  <u>Linux</u>  systems  that  have  either  <u><b><a href="../man1/systemd.1.html">systemd</a></b>(1)</u>  (e.g.  <u>Debian</u>)  or
           <u><b><a href="../man8/elogind.8.html">elogind</a></b>(8)</u>  (e.g.  <u>Slackware</u>).  On  systems  with  <u><b><a href="../man1/systemd.1.html">systemd</a></b>(1)</u>,  you  could instead use a <u>systemd</u> user
           service, particularly if your user account is not allowed to have user services that <u>linger</u>.

       -l <u>spec</u>, --errlog=<u>spec</u>
           Send <u>daemon</u>'s standard output and standard error to the syslog destination or file that is  specified
           by  <u>spec</u>.  If  <u>spec</u>  is  a syslog destination of the form "facility.priority", then output is sent to
           <u><b><a href="../man3/syslog.3.html">syslog</a></b>(3)</u>. Otherwise, output is appended to the file whose path is given in <u>spec</u>. By default,  output
           is sent to the syslog destination, daemon.err. See the MESSAGING section below for more details.

       -b <u>spec</u>, --dbglog=<u>spec</u>
           Send  <u>daemon</u>'s debug output to the syslog destination or file that is specified by <u>spec</u>. If <u>spec</u> is a
           syslog destination of the form "facility.priority", then output  is  sent  to  <u><b><a href="../man3/syslog.3.html">syslog</a></b>(3)</u>.  Otherwise,
           output  is appended to the file whose path is given in <u>spec</u>. By default, output is sent to the syslog
           destination daemon.debug. See the MESSAGING section below for more details.

       -o <u>spec</u>, --output=<u>spec</u>
           Capture the client's standard output and standard error, and send it to  the  syslog  destination  or
           file that is specified by <u>spec</u>. If <u>spec</u> is a syslog destination of the form "facility.priority", then
           output  is  sent to <u><b><a href="../man3/syslog.3.html">syslog</a></b>(3)</u>. Otherwise, output is appended to the file whose path is given in <u>spec</u>.
           By default, output is discarded unless the  --foreground  option  is  present,  in  which  case,  the
           client's  stdout  and  stderr  are  propagated  to  <u>daemon</u>'s stdout and stderr, respectively. See the
           MESSAGING section below for more details.

       -O <u>spec</u>, --stdout=<u>spec</u>
           Capture the client's standard output, and send it to the syslog destination or file that is specified
           by <u>spec</u>. If <u>spec</u> is a syslog destination of the form "facility.priority",  then  output  is  sent  to
           <u><b><a href="../man3/syslog.3.html">syslog</a></b>(3)</u>.  Otherwise, stdout is appended to the file whose path is given in <u>spec</u>. By default, stdout
           is  discarded  unless  the  --foreground  option  is  present,  in which case, the client's stdout is
           propagated to <u>daemon</u>'s stdout. See the MESSAGING section below for more details.

       -E <u>spec</u>, --stderr=<u>spec</u>
           Capture the client's standard error, and send it to the syslog destination or file that is  specified
           by  <u>spec</u>.  If  <u>spec</u>  is  a syslog destination of the form "facility.priority", then stderr is sent to
           <u><b><a href="../man3/syslog.3.html">syslog</a></b>(3)</u>.  Otherwise, stderr is appended to the file whose path is given in <u>spec</u>. By default, stderr
           is discarded unless the --foreground option is  present,  in  which  case,  the  client's  stderr  is
           propagated to <u>daemon</u>'s stderr. See the MESSAGING section below for more details.

       --ignore-eof
           After  receiving  a SIGCHLD signal due to a stopped or restarted client process, don't bother reading
           the client's output until the end-of-file is reached before reaping the client process's  termination
           status  with  <u><b><a href="../man2/wait.2.html">wait</a></b>(2)</u>.  Normally, there will be little or no output after the SIGCHLD signal, because
           the client process has just terminated.  However,  the  client  process  might  have  its  own  child
           processes  keeping its output open long after its own termination. When this happens, by default, the
           client process remains as a zombie process until its child processes terminate and close the  output.
           Waiting  for  the  client's  child  processes to terminate before considering the client stopped, and
           before restarting a new invocation, might be desirable. If not, this option can be used  to  consider
           the  client  process as being terminated as soon as the SIGCHLD signal has been received, and reaping
           its termination status with <u><b><a href="../man2/wait.2.html">wait</a></b>(2)</u> immediately.

       --read-eof
           After receiving a SIGCHLD signal due to a stopped or restarted client process, continue  reading  the
           client's  output  until  the  end-of-file  is reached before reaping the client process's termination
           status with <u><b><a href="../man2/wait.2.html">wait</a></b>(2)</u>. This is the default behaviour. Normally, there will be little or no output after
           the SIGCHLD signal, because the client process has just terminated. However, the client process might
           have its own child processes keeping its output open  long  after  its  own  termination.  When  this
           happens, the client process remains as a zombie process until its child processes terminate and close
           the  output.  Waiting  for  the  client's  child processes to terminate before considering the client
           stopped, and before restarting a new invocation, might be desirable.  If  so,  but  the  --ignore-eof
           option  has  been used in a configuration file to apply to all named daemons, then this option can be
           used to restore the default behaviour for specific named daemons.

       --running
           Check whether or not a named daemon is running, then <u><b><a href="../man3/exit.3.html">exit</a></b>(3)</u> with EXIT_SUCCESS if the named daemon is
           running or EXIT_FAILURE if it isn't.

           If the --verbose option is supplied, print a message before exiting. If both the named daemon and its
           client process are running, the output will look like this, showing both process IDs:

               daemon:  name is running (pid 7455) (clientpid 7457)

           If the named daemon is running but its client process is not (there might be a delay between  respawn
           attempt bursts), the output will look like this, showing only the daemon process's ID:

               daemon:  name is running (pid 7455) (client is not running)

           If the named daemon is not running at all, the output will look like this:

               daemon:  name is not running

           This  option  can  only  be  used  with  the  --name  option. Note that the --chroot, --user, --name,
           --pidfiles and --pidfile (and possibly --config) options must be the same as for the target daemon.

       --restart
           Instruct a named daemon to terminate and restart its client process, by sending it a SIGUSR1  signal.
           This will cause the named daemon to send its client process a SIGTERM signal to stop it. If the named
           daemon  had  been  started  with  the --restart option, the named daemon will then restart its client
           process. Otherwise, this has the same effect as the --stop option,  and  the  named  daemon's  client
           process is not restarted.

           This  option  can  only  be  used  with  the  --name  option. Note that the --chroot, --user, --name,
           --pidfiles and --pidfile (and possibly --config) options must be the same as for the target daemon.

       --stop
           Stop a named daemon by sending it a SIGTERM signal. This will cause the  named  daemon  to  send  its
           client process a SIGTERM option and then exit.

           This  option  can  only  be  used  with  the  --name  option. Note that the --chroot, --user, --name,
           --pidfiles and --pidfile (and possibly --config) options must be the same as for the target daemon.

       --signal=<u>signame</u>
           Send the given signal to a named daemon's client process. The  signal  can  be  specified  either  by
           number  or  by  name  (with or without the "sig" prefix).  Any signal may be sent. However, the named
           daemon's client process might be ignoring some signals.  For  example,  SIGHUP  will  be  ignored  by
           default unless the client process has installed a signal handler for it.

           The  known  list  of  signals  are: hup, int, quit, ill, trap, abrt, iot, bus, fpe, kill, usr1, segv,
           usr2, pipe, alrm, term, stkflt, cld, chld, cont, stop, tstp, ttin, ttou,  urg,  xcpu,  xfsz,  vtalrm,
           prof, winch, poll, io, pwr, sys, emt and info. Not all of them are available on all platforms.

       --list
           Print  a  list  of  the  currently running named daemons whose pidfiles are in the applicable pidfile
           directory  which  will  either  be  the  default  (i.e.   <a href="file:/var/run">/var/run</a>  for  <u>root</u>   (<a href="file:/etc">/etc</a>   on   <u>Solaris</u>,
           /opt/local/var/run  on  <u>macOS</u> when installed via <u>macports</u>), and <a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a> for normal users), or it will be
           specified by the --pidfiles option. Then exit.

           Without the --verbose option, this will only list the names of daemons whose pidfiles are locked,  as
           this implies that the corresponding daemon must still be running. Note that pidfiles for daemons that
           were  not started by <u><b><a href="../man1/daemon.1.html">daemon</a></b>(1)</u> might not be locked. An unlocked pidfile might indicate that <u><b><a href="../man1/daemon.1.html">daemon</a></b>(1)</u>
           has died unexpectedly, or it might just be a pidfile for a daemon that was not started by  <u><b><a href="../man1/daemon.1.html">daemon</a></b>(1)</u>.
           If  this might lead to confusion, you might want to consider using a dedicated pidfiles directory for
           named daemons started by <u><b><a href="../man1/daemon.1.html">daemon</a></b>(1)</u>, and leave the default pidfiles directories for other daemons that
           were started independently of <u><b><a href="../man1/daemon.1.html">daemon</a></b>(1)</u>.

           With the --verbose option, the items in the list will look like the output of  the  --running  option
           with --verbose, but with more detail.

           If there are no pidfiles at all, the output will look like this:

               No named daemons are running

           If  a  pidfile  is locked, and there is a corresponding client pidfile, that indicates that the named
           daemon and its client are both running, and the output will look like this, showing both process IDs:

               name is running (pid ####) (client pid ####)

           If a pidfile is locked, but there is no client pidfile, that  indicates  that  the  named  daemon  is
           running, but its client is not (e.g. during a delay between respawn attempt bursts when the client is
           failing to start successfully), and the output will look like one of the following three options:

           When we can tell that the pidfile is for a process whose executable name is <u>daemon</u>:

               name is running (pid ####) (client is not running)

           When  we  can  tell  that  the pidfile is for a process whose executable name is something other than
           <u>daemon</u> (i.e. is independent of <u><b><a href="../man1/daemon.1.html">daemon</a></b>(1)</u>):

               name is running (pid ####) (independent)

           When it's not possible to determine the name of the executable associated with the <u>pidfile</u>  (i.e.  On
           systems other than <u>Linux</u> without a <a href="file:/proc">/proc</a> file system):

               name is running (pid ####) (client is not running or is independent)

           If  a  pidfile  is  not  locked, and the applicable pidfiles directory is the default, that indicates
           either that the daemon has unexpectedly terminated, or just that the pidfile is for a daemon that was
           not started by <u><b><a href="../man1/daemon.1.html">daemon</a></b>(1)</u>, and the output will look like this:

               name is not running (or is independent)

           If a pidfile is not locked, and the applicable pidfiles directory is not  the  default,  then  it  is
           assumed  that  all  pidfiles are for daemons that were started by <u><b><a href="../man1/daemon.1.html">daemon</a></b>(1)</u>, and the output will look
           like this:

               name is not running

       As with all other programs, a -- argument signifies the end of options.  Any options that appear  on  the
       command line after -- are part of the client command.

</pre><h4><b>EXPANSION</b></h4><pre>
       Some  simple  shell-like  expansion  is performed internally on the arguments of the command line options
       with a text argument (but not the options with a numeric argument).

       Environment variable notation, such as $VAR or ${VAR}, is expanded.  Then user home  directory  notation,
       such  as  ~  or  ~user,  is  expanded.   File name expansion (i.e. globbing) is NOT performed internally.
       Neither are any of your login shell's other wonderful expansions. This is very basic.

       This might not be of much use on the command line, since <u>daemon</u> is normally invoked via  a  shell,  which
       will  first  perform  all  of  its  usual  expansions.  It might even be undesirable to perform expansion
       internally after the shell has already done so (e.g. if you refer to any directory  names  that  actually
       contain  the  '$'  character,  or  if  you  use  any  environment  variables whose values contain the '$'
       character, which is unlikely).

       But it can be useful in configuration files. See the FILES section below for more details. It can also be
       useful when <u>daemon</u> is invoked directly by another program without the use of a shell.

       By default, environment variable expansion is not performed for the <u>root</u> user, even  if  the  environment
       variable was defined in the configuration files. The --idiot option can be used to change this behaviour,
       and  allow the expansion of environment variables for the <u>root</u> user. Home directory notation expansion is
       performed for all users.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       /etc/daemon.conf, /etc/daemon.conf.d/* - system-wide default options

       /usr/local/etc/daemon.conf, /usr/local/etc/daemon.conf.d/* - system-wide default options on  <u>BSD</u>  systems
       (except <u>macOS</u>).

       /opt/local/etc/daemon.conf,  /opt/local/etc/daemon.conf.d/*  -  system-wide default options on <u>macOS</u> when
       installed via <u>macports</u>.

       <a href="file:~/.daemonrc">~/.daemonrc</a>, <a href="file:~/.daemonrc.d/">~/.daemonrc.d/</a>* - user-specific default options

       Each line of the configuration file is either an environment  variable  definition,  or  a  configuration
       directive.

       Environment  variable definitions consist of the variable name, followed immediately by '=' and the value
       of the variable. They look like they do in shell, except that there is no quoting or other shell  syntax.
       Environment  variable values can include simple environment variable notation (e.g.  $VAR or ${VAR}), and
       user home directory notation (e.g. ~ or ~user). These will be expanded  internally  by  <u>daemon</u>.  See  the
       EXPANSION section above for more details.

       Note  that  any  environment variables that are defined in the configuration file, which are subsequently
       used explicitly in another environment variable definition or in an  option  argument,  will  have  these
       expansions  performed  multiple  times.  Avoid  environment  variables  whose  values can change again if
       expansion is performed multiple times.

       Example:

           PATH=<a href="file:/usr/bin">/usr/bin</a>:<a href="file:/usr/sbin">/usr/sbin</a>:$HOME/bin:~app/bin
           PIDFILES=<a href="file:~/.run">~/.run</a>

       Configuration directives consist of a client name (for options that apply to a  single  client),  or  '*'
       (for  generic  options  that  apply to all clients), followed by spaces and/or tabs, followed by a comma-
       separated list of options. Any option arguments must not contain any commas.  The  commas  that  separate
       options  can have spaces and tabs before and after them. Option arguments that are text (but not numbers)
       can include simple environment variable notation (e.g. $VAR or ${VAR}), and user home directory  notation
       (e.g.  ~ or ~user). These will be expanded internally by <u>daemon</u>. See the EXPANSION section above for more
       details.

       Blank lines and comments ('#' to end of the line)  are  ignored.  Lines  can  be  continued  with  a  '\'
       character at the end of the line.

       Example:

           *       errlog=daemon.err,output=local0.err,core
           test1   syslog=local0.debug,debug=9,verbose=9,respawn
           test2   syslog=local0.debug,debug=9, \
                   verbose=9,respawn, \
                   pidfiles=$PIDFILES

       The  command  line  options are processed first, to look for a --config option. If no --config option was
       supplied, the default configuration files, /etc/daemon.conf and /etc/daemon.conf.d/*, are  used.  On  <u>BSD</u>
       systems   (except   <u>macOS</u>),   the   default   configuration   files  are  /usr/local/etc/daemon.conf  and
       /usr/local/etc/daemon.conf.d/*. On <u>macOS</u> when installed via <u>macports</u>, the default configuration files are
       /opt/local/etc/daemon.conf and /opt/local/etc/daemon.conf.d/*.  If the user has their  own  configuration
       files, <a href="file:~/.daemonrc">~/.daemonrc</a> and <a href="file:~/.daemonrc.d/">~/.daemonrc.d/</a>*, they are also used.

       If  the  configuration  files  contain  any  generic ('*') entries, their options are applied in order of
       appearance. If the --name option was supplied, and the configuration files contain any  entries  for  the
       given name, those options are then applied in order of appearance.

       Finally,  the  command line options are applied again. This ensures that any generic options apply to all
       clients by default. Client-specific options override generic options. User options  override  system-wide
       options. Command line options override everything else.

       Note  that the configuration files are not opened and read until after any --chroot and/or --user command
       line options are processed. This means that the configuration file paths and the client's file path  must
       be  relative  to  the  --chroot  argument.  It  also  means  that  the configuration files and the client
       executable must be readable/executable by the user specified by the --user argument. It also  means  that
       the  --chroot  and  --user  options  must not appear in the configuration file. Also note that the --name
       option must not appear on the right hand side in the configuration file either.

</pre><h4><b>MESSAGING</b></h4><pre>
       The --errlog, --dbglog, --output, --stdout and --stderr options all take an argument that can be either a
       syslog destination of the form "facility.priority" or the path to a file. Here are the  lists  of  syslog
       facilities and priorities:

         Facilities:
         kern, user, mail, daemon, auth, syslog, lpr, news, uucp, cron,
         local0, local1, local2, local3, local4, local5, local6, local7.

         Priorities:
         emerg, alert, crit, err, warning, notice (on some systems), info, debug.

       If  the  path  to  a  file  is supplied instead, bear in mind the fact that <u><b><a href="../man1/daemon.1.html">daemon</a></b>(1)</u> changes to the root
       directory by default, and so the file path should be an absolute path (or relative to the --chroot and/or
       --chdir option argument). Otherwise, <u><b><a href="../man1/daemon.1.html">daemon</a></b>(1)</u> will attempt to create the file relative  to  its  current
       directory. You might not have permissions to do that, or want to even if you do.

</pre><h4><b>CAVEAT</b></h4><pre>
       Clients  can  only be restarted if they were started with the --respawn option. Using --restart on a non-
       respawning daemon client is equivalent to using --stop. If you try to restart  a  named  daemon,  and  it
       stops instead, then it probably wasn't started with the --respawn option.

       Clients  that  are  run  in  the  foreground  with  a  pseudo terminal don't respond to job control (i.e.
       suspending with Control-Z doesn't work). This is because the client belongs to an orphaned process  group
       (it  starts  in  its  own process session), so the kernel won't send it SIGSTOP signals.  However, if the
       client is a shell that supports job control, then its subprocesses can be suspended.

       In KDE, if you use "exec daemon" (or just "exec" without daemon) in a shell, to run  a  KDE  application,
       you  might  find  that  the  KDE  application sometimes doesn't run. This problem has only been seen with
       <u><b><a href="../man1/konsole.1.html">konsole</a></b>(1)</u>, but it might happen with other KDE applications as well. Capturing the standard error of  the
       KDE application might show something like:

         unnamed <a href="../man9697/app.9697.html">app</a>(9697): KUniqueApplication: Registering failed!
         unnamed <a href="../man9697/app.9697.html">app</a>(9697): Communication problem with  "konsole" , it probably crashed.
         Error message was:  "org.freedesktop.DBus.Error.ServiceUnknown" : " "The name
                             org.kde.konsole was not provided by any .service files"

       A  workaround  seems  to  be  to  delay  the termination of the initial <u><b><a href="../man1/daemon.1.html">daemon</a></b>(1)</u> process by at least 0.4
       seconds. To make this happen, set the environment variable DAEMON_INIT_EXIT_DELAY_MSEC to the  number  of
       milliseconds  by  which  to  delay. For example: DAEMON_INIT_EXIT_DELAY_MSEC=400. Or you could just avoid
       using exec when starting <u>KDE</u> applications.

       On <u>Linux</u> systems that have <u><b><a href="../man1/systemd.1.html">systemd</a></b>(1)</u> or <u><b><a href="../man8/elogind.8.html">elogind</a></b>(8)</u>, you might find that your <u>daemon</u> processes and  their
       client processes are terminated when you logout, even though they are in a different process session, and
       so  should be unaffected. This is because <u>systemd</u> has the ability to terminate all of your processes when
       you logout. Luckily, this feature is turned off by default in some <u>Linux</u> distributions. However, if it is
       on,  you  can  turn  it  off   by   adding   the   following   line   to   <a href="file:/etc/systemd/logind.conf">/etc/systemd/logind.conf</a>   (or
       /etc/elogind/logind.conf):

         KillUserProcesses=no
