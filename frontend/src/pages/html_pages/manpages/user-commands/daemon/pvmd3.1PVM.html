</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       pvmd, pvmd3 - PVM daemon

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>pvmd</b> <b>[</b> <b>-options</b> <b>]</b> <b>[</b> <b>hostfile</b> <b>]</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Pvmd3</u>  is a daemon process which coordinates unix hosts in a virtual machine.  One <u>pvmd3</u> must run on each
       host in the group.  They provide the communication and process control functions needed by the user's PVM
       processes.  The daemon can be started manually with a host file argument that  will  automatically  start
       the remote pvmds.  The local and remote pvmds can also be started from the PVM console program <u>pvm</u>.

       The name of the daemon executable is <u>pvmd3</u>.  It is usually started by a shell script, <u>$PVM_ROOT/lib/pvmd</u>.

       [v3.4  and  later]  Before  running  pvmd3,  pvmd  sources any commands in <u>$HOME/.pvmprofile</u> if this file
       exists.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The following options may be specified on the command line when starting the master pvmd or PVM console:

       -d<u>mask</u>  Set pvmd debug mask.  Used to debug the pvmd  or  libpvm  (not  intended  to  be  used  to  debug
               application programs).  <u>Mask</u> is the <u>sum</u> of the following bits and can be specified in hexadecimal
               (0x...), octal (0...) or decimal:
                   Bit     Information
                   0x1     Packet routing
                   0x2     Message routing and entry points
                   0x4     Task state
                   0x8     Slave pvmd startup
                   0x10    Host table updates
                   0x20    Select loop (below packet layer)
                   0x40    IP network
                   0x80    Multiprocessor nodes
                   0x100   Resource manager interface
                   0x200   Application (messages with no destination, etc.)
                   0x400   Wait contexts
                   0x800   Shared memory operations
                   0x1000  Semaphores
                   0x2000  Locks
                   0x4000  Message route control

       -n<u>name</u>  Specify  an  alternate  hostname for the master pvmd to use.  Useful when <u>gethostname()</u> returns a
               name not assigned to any network interface.

       The following options are used by the master pvmd when starting  slaves  and  are  only  of  interest  to
       someone writing a <u>hoster</u>.  Don't just go using them, now.

       -s     Start  pvmd  in slave mode.  Hostfile cannot be used, five additional parameters must be supplied:
              master pvmd index, master IP, master MTU, slave pvmd index, and slave IP.

       -S     Same as -s, but slave pvmd doesn't wait for its <u>stdin</u> to be closed after printing its  parameters.
              Used for manual startup.

       -f     Slave  doesn't  fork  after configuration (useful if the slave is to be controlled or monitored by
              some process).

</pre><h4><b>HOST</b> <b>FILE</b> <b>FORMAT</b></h4><pre>
       Each host in the virtual machine must have an entry in the host file.  Lines beginning with a splat  (  #
       ), optionally preceded by whitespace, are ignored.

       A simple host file might look like:

            # my first host file
            thud
            fred
            wilma
            barney
            betty

       This specifies the names of five hosts to be configured in the virtual machine.

       The  master  <u>pvmd</u>  for  a  group is started by hand on the localhost, and it starts slaves on each of the
       remaining hosts using the <u>rsh</u> or <u>rexec</u> command.  The master host may appear on any line of the host file.
       Host names cannot be numeric (IP) addresses, because they are passed to rsh and  rexec(),  which  usually
       don't accept addresses.

       The  simple  format above works fine if you have the same login name on all five machines and the name of
       the master host in your .rhosts files on the other four.

       There are several host file options available:

              lo=NAME   Specifies an alternate login name (NAME) to use.

              so=pw     This is necessary when the remote host cannot trust the master.  Causes the master  pvmd
                        to  prompt  for  a  password  for the remote host in the tty of the pvmd (note you can't
                        start the master using the console or background it when using  this  option)  you  will
                        see:
                             Password (honk.cs.utk.edu:manchek):
                        you  should  type  your password for the remote host.  The startup will then continue as
                        normal.

              dx=FILE   Specifies the path of the pvmd executable.  FILE may be a simple filename,  an  absolute
                        pathname,  or  a path relative to the user's home directory on the remote host.  This is
                        mainly useful to aid in debugging new versions of PVM, but may have other uses.

              ep=PATH   Specifies a path for the <u>pvmd</u> to search for executable program components when  spawning
                        a new process.  The path may have multiple elements, separated by colons ( : ).

              wd=PATH   Specifies a working directory in which all spawned tasks on this host will execute.

              sp=VALUE  Specifies  the  relative computational speed of this host compared to other hosts in the
                        configuration.  VALUE is an integer in the range [1 - 1000000]

              bx=PATH   Specifies the debugger program path.  Note: the environment  variable  PVM_DEBUGGER  can
                        also be set.

              ip=NAME   Specifies  an alternate IP address to use for the host.  As with host names (when ip= is
                        not used), the address must be a host name, not a numeric address, because it is  passed
                        to  rsh  and rexec().  This option allows one to pick a specific network interface for a
                        machine without using the interface's name.  It can also be used  to  create  a  virtual
                        machine using symbolic (instead of actual) host names.

              so=ms     Rarely  used.  Causes the master pvmd to request user to manually perform the startup of
                        a pvmd on a slave host  when  rsh  and  rexec  network  services  are  disabled  but  IP
                        connectivity exists.  See section "MANUAL STARTUP".

              id=VMID   A  new  feature  in PVM 3.4.4 is the concept of a "Virtual Machine ID".  You can now set
                        the VMID to an arbitrary string and this will distinguish  and  allow  multiple  virtual
                        machines  to  run  on  the  same  set of hosts under the same userid.  (This feature was
                        originally introduced by  SGI  in  their  commercial  PVM  product,  and  has  now  been
                        generalized  for the public PVM system.)  This feature seems to be something that people
                        often want, and the "id=" hostfile option (or $PVM_VMID  environment  variable)  is  the
                        cleanest  way  to  provide  this  functionality,  rather  than overloading the SHAREDTMP
                        compiler flag and other internals.

                        *** Make Sure *** that you appropriately set the $PVM_VMID environment variable  in  any
                        shells  from  which PVM application tasks or the "pvm" console will be run, or else they
                        won't know <u>which</u> virtual machine to attach to!

                        By default, all hosts which are added to the virtual machine will inherit the same VMID.
                        If hosts are added to the virtual machine which are running older versions of PVM (prior
                        to 3.4.4), then the VMID will be ignored for those hosts, and hence these  machines  can
                        only  be  added  to  one  virtual  machine  for  the  given  user.  The VMID need not be
                        consistent on every host  in  a  virtual  machine  (although  this  is  not  necessarily
                        advisable).

       A  dollar  sign ( $ ) in an option introduces a variable name, for example <u>$PVM_ARCH</u>.  Names are expanded
       from environment variables by each pvmd.

       Each of the flags above has a default value.  These are:
              lo      The loginname on the master host.
              so      Nothing
              dx      $PVM_ROOT/lib/pvmd (or environment variable PVM_DPATH)
              ep      $HOME/pvm3/bin/$PVM_ARCH:$PVM_ROOT/bin/$PVM_ARCH
              wd      $HOME
              sp      1000
              bx      $PVM_ROOT/lib/debugger

       You can change these by adding a line with a star ( * ) in the first field followed by the  options,  for
       example:

            * lo=afriend so=pw

       This  sets new default values for 'lo' and 'so' for the remainder of the host file, or until the next '*'
       line.  Options set on the last '*' line also apply to hosts added dynamically using <u>pvm_addhosts()</u>.

       Host options can be set without starting  the  hosts  automatically.   Information  on  host  file  lines
       beginning with '&amp;' is stored, but the hosts are not started until added using <u>pvm_addhosts()</u>.

       Example host file:
            # host file for testing on various platforms
            fonebone
            refuge
            # installed in <a href="file:/usr/local">/usr/local</a> here
            sigi.cs            dx=/usr/local/pvm3/lib/pvmd
            # borrowed accts, "guest", don't trust fonebone
            *                  lo=guest  so=pw
            sn666.jrandom.com
            cubie.misc.edu
            # really painful one, must start it by hand and share a homedir
            &amp; igor.firewall.com  lo=guest2  so=ms  ep=bob/pvm3/bin/$PVM_ARCH

</pre><h4><b>MANUAL</b> <b>STARTUP</b></h4><pre>
       When adding a host with this option set you will see on the tty of the pvmd:
            *** Manual startup ***
            Login to "honk" and type:
            $PVM_ROOT/lib/pvmd -S -d0 -nhonk 1 80a9ca95:0cb6 4096 2 80a95c43:0000
            Type response:

       after typing the given command on host <u>honk</u>, you should see a line like:
            ddpro&lt;2312&gt; arch&lt;ALPHA&gt; ip&lt;80a95c43:0a8e&gt; mtu&lt;4096&gt;

       type this line on the tty of the master pvmd.  You should then see:
            Thanks

       and the two pvmds should be able to communicate.

       Note you can't start the master using the console or background it when using this option.

</pre><h4><b>OVERLOADING</b> <b>HOSTS</b></h4><pre>
       You  can  force  PVM to overload a host (start more than one pvmd on it) by putting a '$' before the host
       name in the host file.  This is not recommended unless you know what you're doing and have a good  reason
       for it.  You must build the PVM source with option OVERLOADHOST defined for it to work.

       You  may  also  need to use the ip= hostfile option to define several names with the same IP address.  If
       two or more hosts in a PVM have the same name, they cannot be identified uniquely.

</pre><h4><b>STOPPING</b> <b>PVMD3</b></h4><pre>
       The preferred method of stopping all the pvmds is to give the <u>halt</u> command in the PVM console. This kills
       all PVM tasks, all the remote daemons, the local daemon, and finally the console itself.  If  the  master
       pvmd is killed manually it should be sent a SIGTERM signal to allow it to kill the remote pvmds and clean
       up various files.

       The  pvmd  can be killed in a manner that leaves the file /tmp/pvmd.<u>uid</u> behind on one or more hosts.  <u>Uid</u>
       is the numeric user ID (from <a href="file:/etc/passwd">/etc/passwd</a>) of the user.  This will prevent PVM  from  restarting  on  that
       host.  Deletion of this file will fix this problem:

           rm `( grep $user <a href="file:/etc/passwd">/etc/passwd</a> || ypmatch $user passwd )
                | awk -F: '{print "/tmp/pvmd."$3; exit}'`

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
         $PVM_ROOT/lib/pvmd  PVM daemon startup script
         $PVM_ROOT/lib/$PVM_ARCH/pvmd3 PVM daemon executable
         $HOME/.pvmprofile Shell commands read by pvmd before
           running pvmd3
         $HOME/pvm3/bin/$PVM_ARCH  Private PVM executable directory
         $PVM_ROOT/pvm3/bin/$PVM_ARCH  System PVM executable directory
         /tmp/pvmd.<u>uid</u> Pvmd local socket address
         /tmp/pvml.<u>uid</u> Pvmd runtime error log
