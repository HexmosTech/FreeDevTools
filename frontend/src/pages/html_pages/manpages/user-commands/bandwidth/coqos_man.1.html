</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       coqos_man - Set and monitor bandwidth

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>coqos_man</b> [<u>options</u>] <b>limit</b> [<u>device</u>] [...]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>This</b> <b>page</b> <b>is</b> <b>under</b> <b>construction.</b>

       Monitors the bandwidth being used and sets a bandwidth limit.  If the bandwidth limit is exceeded it will
       suspend  the  lower  priority  streams  in priority order until the bandwidth being used is less than the
       limit.

       This program is part of the Qualcomm Atheros Powerline Toolkit.  See the <b>plc</b> man page for an overview and
       installation instructions.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       -<b>e</b>     Redirects stderr messages to stdout.  By convention  progress  messages  and  error  messages  are
              printed  on  stderr  while  primary  program  output is printed on stdout.  This option prints all
              output on stdout in cases where this is desired.

       -<b>i</b> <u>interface</u>
              Select the host Ethernet interface.  All requests are  sent  via  this  host  interface  and  only
              reponses  received  via this host interface are recognized.  The default interface is <b>eth1</b> because
              most people use <b>eth0</b> as their principle network connection; however, if environment  string  "PLC"
              is defined then it takes precedence over the default interface.  This option then takes precedence
              over either default.

       -<b>q</b>     Suppresses status messages on stderr.

       -<b>r</b>     Display relative memory offsets on output.  This option is the default.

       -<b>v</b>     Prints  additional  information  on  stdout.   In  particular, this option dumps outgoing Ethernet
              packets on stdout.

       -<b>?</b>,--<b>help</b>
              Displays program help information on stderr.  This option takes precedence over all other  options
              on the command line except version information.

       -<b>!</b>,--<b>version</b>
              Displays  program  version  information  on  stderr.   This option takes precedence over all other
              options on the command line except help information.  Use this option when sending screen dumps to
              Atheros technical staff.

</pre><h4><b>ARGUMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>limit</u>  The bandwidth limit, in kbps, expressed as a decimal integer.  This  argument  is  required.   The
              range is 10 through 90000.

       <u>device</u> The  MAC  address of some powerline device.  More than one address may be specified on the command
              line.  If more than one address is specified then operations are performed on each device in turn.
              The default address is "<b>local</b>".  See <b>DEVICES</b> for more information.

</pre><h4><b>DEVICES</b></h4><pre>
       Ethernet MAC addresses are expressed as six  hexadecimal  octets  optionally  separated  by  colon.   For
       example,  the  Qualcomm  Atheros  Local Management Address (LMA) of "00b052000001" may also be entered as
       "00:b0:52:00:00:01" or "00b052:000001".  Addresses are case insensitive  and  quotes  are  optional.   In
       addition,  some  special  addresses  may  be  entered  by  name  rather  than number where names are case
       sensitive.

       <b>all</b>    A synonym for the "broadcast" address, described next.

       <b>broadcast</b>
              A synonym for the Ethernet broadcast address,  <b>FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF</b>.   All  devices,  whether  local,
              remote or foreign will respond to this address.

       <b>local</b>  A   synonym   for   the   Qualcomm   Atheros  vendor  specific  Local  Management  Address  (LMA),
              <b>00:B0:52:00:00:01</b>.  All local Atheros devices  recognize  this  address  but  remote  and  foreign
              devices  do  not.   A  remote  device  is  any device at the far end of a powerline connection.  A
              foreign device is any device not manufactured by Atheros.

</pre><h4><b>REFERENCES</b></h4><pre>

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       The following example suspends streams if the bandwidth used exceeds 20mbps.
