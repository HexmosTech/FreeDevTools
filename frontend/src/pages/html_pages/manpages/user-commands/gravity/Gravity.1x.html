       Center

              when  window  decorations  are  added  to  client  window  - window is moved so that center of the
              resulting framed window will be in the same location as the center of mapped client window without
              decorations.

       East

              Decorated window is moved so that its right side is located at same  position  as  right  side  of
              undecorated client window.

       North

              Decorated  window  is  moved  so  that  its  top  side  is located at same position as top side of
              undecorated client window.

       NorthEast

              Decorated window is moved so that its right-top corner is located at same  position  as  right-top
              corner of undecorated client window.

       NorthWest

              Decorated  window  is  moved  so  that its left-top corner is located at same position as left-top
              corner of undecorated client window.

       South

              Decorated window is moved so that its bottom side is located at same position as  bottom  side  of
              undecorated client window.

       SouthEast

              Decorated  window  is  moved  so  that  its  right-bottom  corner  is  located at same position as
              right-bottom corner of undecorated client window.

       SouthWest

              Decorated window is moved  so  that  its  left-bottom  corner  is  located  at  same  position  as
              left-bottom corner of undecorated client window.

       Static

              when  window  decorations are added to client window - frame window is moved so that client window
              remains in exact position it was mapped at.

       West

              Decorated window is moved so that its left side is located  at  same  position  as  left  side  of
              undecorated client window.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       When  client  window is mapped on screen - Window Manager draws some frame decorations around it, such as
       Titlebar, resize handles, etc. As such decorations take additional space, it is nesseccary to specify  if
       resulting  larger window should be moved on screen in any particular direction in order to compensate for
       discrepancy in size. This is determined by Gravity hint.

       Usually Gravity is set by client itself, depending  on  geometry  specified  by  the  user.  For  example
       geometry  -10+100  will  set gravity to NorthEast, while +10+100 will set gravity to NorthWest. Sometimes
       this gravity setting requested by application is incorrect  though,  due  to  longstanding  tradition  of
       misinterpretation  of  its  meaning. In this cases it may be desired to override gravity. AfterStep users
       can accomplish that using database file, and definig new Style  for  specific  application  with  Gravity
       attribute  set. For example it is recommended to set gravity of popular image viewver XV to be Static, as
       it tends to move self assuming that it knows everything.

       Below are the list of possible gravity values with explanation of its meaning.
