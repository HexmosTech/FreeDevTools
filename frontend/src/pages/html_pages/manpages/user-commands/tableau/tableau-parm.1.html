</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       tableau-parm - Tableau Write-blocking Bridge Query/Command Utility

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>tableau-parm</b> <b>[-r]</b> <u>device</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>tableau-parm</b>  is  designed to interact with write-blocking forensics bridges produced by Tableau, LLC. It
       can be used to query bridges for various bridge and device data, as well as to disable DCO regions.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>tableau-parm</b> accepts the following parameters:

       <b>-r</b>     Directs <b>tableau-parm</b> to permanently remove a DCO, if it exists.  THIS WILL MODIFY THE STATE OF THE
              DRIVE. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!  (It is recommended for forensics investigations, that a  full  drive
              image  be  taken  before  this  command  is  run,  and  then again afterward if a DCO was detected
              originally.) Note: after running this, you'll need  to  restart  the  Tableau  bridge  for  it  to
              correctly detect the changes.

       <u>device</u> Required  argument.  Specifies  the device file for the bridge/drive to be queried. This must be a
              device presenting SCSI emulation.  Under Linux, all USB and FireWire mass storage  devices  behave
              like  SCSI  devices. Once a bridge and drive are plugged in and powered on, one can generally find
              out what the device was dynamically mapped to by running: <b>dmesg</b> <b>|</b> <b>tail</b> <b>-20</b>

</pre><h4><b>OUTPUT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>tableau-parm</b> generates simple output with one data value per line,  interspersed  with  blank  lines  and
       section headers.  This output format is subject to change.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       To query a bridge which is mapped to <b>/dev/sda</b>:

            tableau-parm /dev/sda

       To remove a DCO from the hard drive on <b>/dev/sda</b>:

            tableau-parm -r /dev/sda

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Older  versions  of  ATA  and  SATA Tableau firmwares didn't properly handle HPA and DCO on some types of
       drives. Be sure to upgrade your blockers' firmwares using the firmware update  utility,  version  4.2  or
       later, which was released on July 5, 2007.

       This  is  not  really a bug, but something to note: when a drive has both an HPA and DCO section, and the
       DCO is removed, the HPA is removed with it. This is how the bridge firmware works,  and  isn't  something
       controlled by <b>tableau-parm</b>. Just something to be aware of.
