       ccenergy - Coupled cluster singles and doubles energy program

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  program <b>ccenergy</b> solves the coupled cluster singles and doubles amplitude equations.  This code will
       work for spin-restricted closed-shell Hartree-Fock (RHF), spin-restricted open-shell Hartree-Fock (ROHF),
       spin-unrestricted Hartree-Fock (UHF), and Brueckner references.   The  algorithm  makes  use  of  spatial
       symmetry  (D2h and its subgroups) and matrix algebra techniques for efficiency.  In addition, the program
       can be used to simulate local correlation methods.

</pre><h4><b>INPUT</b> <b>FORMAT</b></h4><pre>
       Input for this program is read from the file input.dat.  The following keywords are valid:

       <b>WFN</b> <b>=</b> <u>string</u>
              Specifies  the  type  of  coupled cluster calculation desired.  Valid entries at present are <u>CCSD</u>,
              <u>CCSD_T</u>, <u>BCCD</u>, and <u>BCCD_T</u>.  There is no default.

       <b>REFERENCE</b> <b>=</b> <u>string</u>
              Specifies the type of orbitals used for the single-determinant reference function.  Valied entries
              at present are <u>RHF</u>, <u>UHF</u>, and <u>ROHF</u>.  There is no default.

       <b>MEMORY</b> <b>=</b> (<u>real</u> MB)
              The maximum amount of core memory to be used, in megabytes.  See also the <b>CACHETYPE</b>  and  <b>CACHELEV</b>
              keywords below.

       <b>CONVERGENCE</b> <b>=</b> <u>integer</u>
              Convergence  desired  on  the CC amplitudes.  Convergence is achieved when the RMS of the error in
              the CC wave function is less than 10**(-n).  The default is 7.

       <b>BRUECKNER_CONV</b> <b>=</b> <u>integer</u>
              Convergence desired for the orbitals in Brueckner-CC calculations.  Convergence is  achieved  when
              the largest absolute value of a single T1 ampltiudes is is less than 10**(-n).  The default is 5.

       <b>MAXITER</b> <b>=</b> <u>integer</u>
              Maximum number of iterations to solve the coupled cluster equations.  Defaults to 50.

       <b>FREEZE_CORE</b> <b>=</b> <u>string</u>
              Specifes  whether  core  orbitals should be automatically frozen in the CC wave function.  If this
              option is set (preferably in the "default" section of input), then the <b>cscf</b> program will  identify
              the  core orbitals.  Subsequent codes starting with <b>transqt</b> will freeze these orbitals.  Note that
              this keyword usually makes the additional specification of FROZEN_DOCC  unnecessary,  but  it  may
              still be required in some special cases.  Allowed values are true, false, yes, no, 1, 0, large and
              small.

       <b>FROZEN_DOCC</b> <b>=</b> <u>integer_array</u>
              The number of lowest energy doubly occupied orbitals in each irreducible representation from which
              there  will  be  no  excitations.  The Cotton ordering of the irredicible representations is used.
              The default is the zero vector.  <b>NB:</b> This keyword is actually read by the integral  transformation
              program <b>transqt</b> and the integral sorting program <b>ccsort.</b>  See also the FREEZE_CORE keyword.

       <b>FROZEN_UOCC</b> <b>=</b> <u>integer_vector</u>
              The  number  of  highest  energy unoccupied orbitals in each irreducible representation into which
              there will be no excitations.  The default is the zero vector.  <b>NB:</b> This keyword is actually  read
              by the integral transformation program <b>transqt</b> and the integral sorting program <b>ccsort.</b>

       <b>PRINT</b> <b>=</b> <u>integer</u>
              Determines the verbosity of the output.  A value of 0 (the default) specifies minimal printing and
              a  value  of  2  will  give output updates as each term of the CC equations is complete.  No other
              values have yet been used.

       <b>NUM_AMPS</b> <b>=</b> <u>integer</u>
              Specifies the number of largest T1 and T2 amplitudes to print at the  end  of  the  CC  procedure.
              Default is 10.

       <b>PRINT_MP2_AMPS</b> <b>=</b> <u>boolean</u>
              Indicates  if  the MP2 amplitudes (which are starting guesses for RHF and UHF reference functions)
              should be printed.  Default is false.

       <b>RESTART</b> <b>=</b> <u>boolean</u>
              Allows the program to use old T1 and T2 vectors from previous calculations as the initial  guesses
              for  a  new  calculation.  This is particularly useful for geometry optimizations.  The default is
              <u>TRUE</u>.  <b>NB:</b> The ability to restart a calculation is also controlled by the phases of the  molecular
              orbitals.   If  the  parameter  <b>PHASE</b> from the chkpt file (cf. libchkpt) is set to <u>FALSE</u>, then the
              user's <b>RESTART</b> input will  be  ignored.   This  behavior  can  be  overridden,  however  with  the
              <b>FORCE_RESTART</b> option.

       <b>FORCE_RESTART=</b> <u>boolean</u>
              Forces  possible  restart  of  the  CC  equations from previous T1 and T2 amplitudes.  This option
              should be used only by experts.

       <b>AO_BASIS=</b> <u>string</u>
              Compute contributions from four virtual-index integrals, &lt;ab|cd&gt;, from  the  atomic-orbital  basis
              integrals.    This   option  slows  the  calculation  somewhat,  but  greatly  reduces  disk-space
              requirements.  Allowed values are NONE (default), DISK  (use  the  AO-basis  integrals  stored  on
              disk),  or  DIRECT  (use  <b>cints</b> to compute the AO-integrals on the fly in each CC iteration).  The
              DIRECT option is still experimental and should be used only by experts.

       <b>CACHETYPE=</b> <u>string</u>
              Selects the priority type for maintaining the automatic memory cache used by the DPD codes.   (See
              libdpd.html for further details.)  A value of <u>LOW</u> (the default) selects a "low priority" scheme in
              which  the deletion of items from the cache is based on pre-programmed priorities.  A value of <u>LRU</u>
              selects a "least recently used" scheme in which the oldest item in the cache will be the first one
              deleted.

       <b>CACHELEV=</b> <u>integer</u>
              Selects the level of automatic cacheing desired in the storage of various  amplitudes,  integrals,
              and  intermediates in the coupled cluster procedure.  A value of 0 retains no quantities in cache,
              while a  level  of  6  attempts  to  store  all  quantities  in  cache.   For  particularly  large
              calculations,  a  value  of  0  may help with certain types of memory problems.  The default is 2,
              which means that all four-index quantites with up to two virtual-orbital  indices  (e.g.,  &lt;ij|ab&gt;
              integrals) may be held in the cache.

       <b>DIIS=</b> <u>boolean</u>
              Selects  the  use  of the direct-inversion in the iterative subspace (DIIS) technique of Pulay for
              convergence acceleration.  The default is <u>TRUE</u>.

       <b>LOCAL=</b> <u>boolean</u>
              Simluate the effects of local correlation techniques.  The default is <u>FALSE</u>.

       <b>LOCAL_CUTOFF=</b> <u>real</u>
              The tolerance value (always between one and zero) for the Broughton-Pulay completeness check  used
              to contruct orbital domains for local-CC calculations.  The default is 0.02.  See J. Broughton and
              P.  Pulay,  J.  Comp. Chem. <b>14</b>, 736-740 (1993) and C. Hampel and H.-J. Werner, J. Chem. Phys. <b>104</b>,
              6286-6297 (1996).

       <b>LOCAL_METHOD=</b> <u>string</u>
              Selects the type of local-CCSD scheme to be simulated.  Valid entries are <u>WERNER</u>  for  the  method
              develop  by  H.-J.  Werner and co-workers or <u>AOBASIS</u> for the method developed by G.E. Scuseria and
              co-workers (currently inoperative).  The default is <u>WERNER</u>.

       <b>LOCAL_WEAKP=</b> <u>string</u>
              Selects the desired treatment of "weak pairs" in  the  local-CCSD  method.   A  value  of  <u>NEGLECT</u>
              ignores  weak  pairs  entirely.   A  value  of <u>NONE</u> treats weak pairs in the same manner as strong
              pairs.  A value of <u>MP2</u> (the default) uses second-order perturbation theory to correct  the  local-
              CCSD energy computed with weak pairs ignored.

       <b>PRINT_PAIR_ENERGIES</b> <b>=</b> <u>boolean</u>
              Indicates  if  the  MP2  and  CCSD  pair energies should be printed. This is only possible for RHF
              references. Default is false.

       <b>SPINADAPT_ENERGIES</b> <b>=</b> <u>boolean</u>
              Indicates if spin-adapted pair energies should be printed.  Default is false.

                                                  18 June, 2002                                      <u><a href="../man1/ccenergy.1.html">ccenergy</a></u>(1)
