       pj_dump - dumps a paje trace file in a CSV-like textual format

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>pj_dump</b> [<u>OPTIONS</u>] [<u>FILE</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <a href="../man1/pj_dump.1.html">pj_dump</a>(1) command translates the paje trace file <u>FILE</u> to a CSV-like textual format (described
       below). It is a useful program to analyze the behavior of parallel and distributed applications that were
       traced using some library that generates trace files in the Paje file format. Once you dump the contents
       of the Paje trace file in a CSV-like manner, you are free to analyze the contents of the trace the way
       you want. You can use R for example to draw scatter plots and gantt charts. If <u>FILE</u> is not provided, then
       the standard input is used.

       By default, <b>pj_dump</b> will read the trace file from the beginning until the end of file is found. During
       this process, <b>pj_dump</b> relies on the Paje library to recreate in memory the behavior that is registered in
       the trace files. This means that <b>pj_dump</b> will put in memory all the contents of the trace file, even if
       the input is very large. Once all the contents of the trace file are simulated, <b>pj_dump</b> dumps the
       information in the CSV-like textual format described below in the OUTPUT DESCRIPTION section.

       You can change the default behavior of <b>pj_dump</b> by providing the parameters <b>--start=START</b> and <b>--end=END</b>
       where START and END are valid timestamps of the input trace. If provided, it dumps only the contents of
       the trace between START and END. Note that even if used, <b>pj_dump</b> will simulate the whole trace file to
       keep the same semantic of behavior. Another way to change the default behavior is through the
       <b>--stop-at=TIME</b> parameter. If provided, <b>pj_dump</b> will read the trace file up to timestamp TIME (considering
       that the trace file is completely time ordered) and dumps what has been simulated until then. The
       <b>--no-strict</b> switch should be avoided and can be used only with old Paje trace files with old field names
       in event definitions. The <b>--ignore-incomplete-links</b> switch make <b>pj_dump</b> ignore incomplete links silently.
       More details on this switch below, in the OUTPUT DESCRIPTION section.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>pj_dump</b> accepts the following options:

       <b>-a,</b> <b>--stop-at</b>=<u>TIME</u>
           Stop the trace simulation at TIME.

       <b>-s,</b> <b>--start</b>=START
           Dump starts at timestamp START (instead of timestamp 0).

       <b>-e,</b> <b>--end</b>=<u>END</u>
           Dump ends timestamp END (instead of End Of File).

       <b>-n,</b> <b>--no-strict</b>
           Support old field names in event definitions.

       <b>-z,</b> <b>--ignore-incomplete-links</b>
           Ignore incomplete links without warnings.

       <b>-u,</b> <b>--user-defined</b>
           Dump user-defined fields. See USER-DEFINED FIELDS section below.

       <b>--type-hierarchy</b>=<u>FILE</u>
           Dump the type hierarchy in CSV format to FILE.

       <b>--entity-hierarchy</b>=<u>FILE</u>
           Dump the entity hierarchy in CSV format to FILE.

       <b>-f,</b> <b>--flex</b>
           Use alternative file reader based on flex/bison (experimental).

       <b>-?,</b> <b>--help</b>
           Show all the available options.

       <b>--usage</b>
           Give a short usage message.

</pre><h4><b>INPUT</b> <b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <a href="../man1/pj_dump.1.html">pj_dump</a>(1) command expects an input that follows the Paje file format (as described in the PDF
       document listed in the RESOURCES section of this page). If FILE is not provided, <a href="../man1/pj_dump.1.html">pj_dump</a>(1) will try to
       read from the standard input.

</pre><h4><b>OUTPUT</b> <b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       It’s easier to understand what is written here if you are acquainted to the Paje terminology (Container,
       State, Variable, Link, Event and the information attached to each of these). Take a look to the
       description of the Paje File Format (link below in the RESOURCES section) for further details.

       The contents of the lines generated by the <a href="../man1/pj_dump.1.html">pj_dump</a>(1) command are separated by commas, defining the
       columns. So, a line like this:

           Container, 0, LINK, 0, 4.48514, 4.48514, 9

       has seven columns. The first column is always one of: Container, State, Variable, Event or Link. The
       remaining columns of the line have specific information depending on the first column. Here’s a synthetic
       description of the five different types of lines you’ll find as output of <a href="../man1/pj_dump.1.html">pj_dump</a>(1):

           Container, parentContainer, containerType, startTime, endTime, duration, name
           State, container, stateType, startTime, endTime, duration, imbrication, value
           Variable, container, variableType, startTime, endTime, duration, value
           Event, container, eventType, time, value
           Link, container, linkType, startTime, endTime, duration, value, startContainer, endContainer

       See below a detailed description with examples for each of them.

        9. "9" - The ending container

       10. "mpi_123" - The unique key

       <b>Incomplete</b> <b>Links</b>

           According to the description of the Paje File Format, a link is formed by two events: PajeStartLink
           and PajeEndLink. These events are matched by the Paje Simulator using a key that is provided in the
           trace file. If one of these two events are missing for some arbitrary reason and the trace file ends
           (or the container is destroyed), you’ll have a simulation with <b>incomplete</b> <b>links</b>. Generally, the Paje
           Simulator, and by consequence <b>pj_dump</b>, consider these links as errors, and list them in the following
           manner:

               $ pj_dump  <a href="file:~/tracefile.paje">~/tracefile.paje</a>
               List of incomplete links in container '0':
               Link, 0, MSG_PROCESS_TASK_LINK, 0, -1, 0, SR, broadcaster-12, NULL
               Link, 0, MSG_PROCESS_TASK_LINK, 0.00013, -1, 0, SR, broadcaster-13, NULL
               Link, 0, MSG_PROCESS_TASK_LINK, 0.002868, -1, 0, SR, broadcaster-13, NULL
               (...)
               PajeLinkException: Incomplete links at the end of container with name '0'

           The best action when this happens is to fix the tracer or the converter that generated the trace,
           since it indicates probably some error during the execution. If you think that this error is
           acceptable, you can provide the <b>-z</b> switch to <b>pj_dump</b> to tell the Paje Simulator to ignore incomplete
           links. All the trace file will be dumped and all errors concerning incomplete links will be silently
           ignored. Use with caution.

</pre><h4><b>USER-DEFINED</b> <b>FIELDS</b></h4><pre>
       User-defined fields is a feature of the Paje trace file format to add additional information in the trace
       that does not belong to the traditional fields of each event definition. An event definition with four
       user-defined fields (Size, Params, Footprint and Tag) looks like this:

           %EventDef PajeSetState 20
           %  Time      date
           %  Container string
           %  Type      string
           %  Value     string
           %  Size      string
           %  Params    string
           %  Footprint string
           %  Tag       string
           %EndEventDef

       The dump of user-defined fields are disable by default in pj_dump. The user can activate them by passing
       <b>-u</b> (or <b>--user-defined</b>) as argument. When doing so, the CSV-like output of pj_dump will be altered from
       the definition above (see OUTPUT DESCRIPTION). Besides dumping the default fields for each entity and
       container of the trace, the CSV will have additional fields that correspond to user-defined fields. The
       order in which they appear in the output obeys the order of the corresponding event definition. So a
       <b>State</b> defined with the event definition 20 above will have four additional fields in the CSV-like output.
