</pre><h4><b>PROLOG</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       tail — copy the last part of a file

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       tail <b>[</b>-f<b>]</b> <b>[</b>-c <u>number</u>|-n <u>number</u><b>]</b> <b>[</b><u>file</u><b>]</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>tail</u> utility shall copy its input file to the standard output beginning at a designated place.

       Copying shall begin at the point in the file indicated by the <b>-c</b> <u>number</u> or <b>-n</b> <u>number</u> options. The option-
       argument  <u>number</u>  shall  be counted in units of lines or bytes, according to the options <b>-n</b> and <b>-c</b>.  Both
       line and byte counts start from 1.

       Tails relative to the end of the file may be saved in an internal buffer, and  thus  may  be  limited  in
       length. Such a buffer, if any, shall be no smaller than {LINE_MAX}*10 bytes.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>tail</u>  utility  shall  conform  to the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <u>Section</u> <u>12.2</u>, <u>Utility</u>
       <u>Syntax</u> <u>Guidelines</u>, except that <b>'+'</b> may be recognized as an option delimiter as well as <b>'-'</b>.

       The following options shall be supported:

       <b>-c</b> <u>number</u> The application shall ensure that the <u>number</u> option-argument is a decimal  integer,  optionally
                 including  a sign.  The sign shall affect the location in the file, measured in bytes, to begin
                 the copying:
                                       ┌──────┬────────────────────────────────────────┐
                                       │ <b>Sign</b> │             <b>Copying</b> <b>Starts</b>             │
                                       ├──────┼────────────────────────────────────────┤
                                       │  +   │ Relative to the beginning of the file. │
                                       │  -   │ Relative to the end of the file.       │
                                       │ <u>none</u> │ Relative to the end of the file.       │
                                       └──────┴────────────────────────────────────────┘

                 The application shall ensure that if the sign of the <u>number</u> option-argument is <b>'+'</b>, the  <u>number</u>
                 option-argument is a non-zero decimal integer.

                 The origin for counting shall be 1; that is, <b>-c</b> +1 represents the first byte of the file, <b>-c</b> -1
                 the last.

       <b>-f</b>        If  the  input file is a regular file or if the <u>file</u> operand specifies a FIFO, do not terminate
                 after the last line of the input file has been copied, but read and copy further bytes from the
                 input file when they become available. If no <u>file</u> operand is specified and standard input is  a
                 pipe or FIFO, the <b>-f</b> option shall be ignored. If the input file is not a FIFO, pipe, or regular
                 file, it is unspecified whether or not the <b>-f</b> option shall be ignored.

       <b>-n</b> <u>number</u> This option shall be equivalent to <b>-c</b> <u>number</u>, except the starting location in the file shall be
                 measured  in  lines  instead  of  bytes.  The  origin  for  counting shall be 1; that is, <b>-n</b> +1
                 represents the first line of the file, <b>-n</b> -1 the last.

       If neither <b>-c</b> nor <b>-n</b> is specified, <b>-n</b> 10 shall be assumed.

</pre><h4><b>OPERANDS</b></h4><pre>
       The following operand shall be supported:

       <u>file</u>      A pathname of an input file. If no <u>file</u> operand is specified, the standard input shall be used.

</pre><h4><b>STDIN</b></h4><pre>
       The standard input shall be used if no <u>file</u> operand is specified, and shall be used if the  <u>file</u>  operand
       is  <b>'-'</b>  and  the implementation treats the <b>'-'</b> as meaning standard input.  Otherwise, the standard input
       shall not be used.  See the INPUT FILES section.

</pre><h4><b>INPUT</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       If the <b>-c</b> option is specified, the input file can contain arbitrary data; otherwise, the input file shall
       be a text file.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of <u>tail</u>:

       <u>LANG</u>      Provide a default value for the internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See the
                 Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <u>Section</u> <u>8.2</u>, <u>Internationalization</u>  <u>Variables</u>  for  the
                 precedence   of   internationalization  variables  used  to  determine  the  values  of  locale
                 categories.)

       <u>LC_ALL</u>    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values of all the  other  internationalization
                 variables.

       <u>LC_CTYPE</u>  Determine  the  locale  for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of text data as characters
                 (for example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments and input files).

       <u>LC_MESSAGES</u>
                 Determine the locale that should be used to  affect  the  format  and  contents  of  diagnostic
                 messages written to standard error.

       <u>NLSPATH</u>   Determine the location of message catalogs for the processing of <u>LC_MESSAGES</u>.

</pre><h4><b>ASYNCHRONOUS</b> <b>EVENTS</b></h4><pre>
       Default.

</pre><h4><b>STDOUT</b></h4><pre>
       The designated portion of the input file shall be written to standard output.

</pre><h4><b>STDERR</b></h4><pre>
       The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.

</pre><h4><b>OUTPUT</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>EXTENDED</b> <b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       The following exit values shall be returned:

        0    Successful completion.

       &gt;0    An error occurred.

</pre><h4><b>CONSEQUENCES</b> <b>OF</b> <b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       Default.

       <u>The</u> <u>following</u> <u>sections</u> <u>are</u> <u>informative.</u>

</pre><h4><b>APPLICATION</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>-c</b> option should be used with caution when the input is a text file containing multi-byte characters;
       it may produce output that does not start on a character boundary.

       Although  the input file to <u>tail</u> can be any type, the results might not be what would be expected on some
       character special device files or on file  types  not  described  by  the  System  Interfaces  volume  of
       POSIX.1‐2017.  Since  this  volume of POSIX.1‐2017 does not specify the block size used when doing input,
       <u>tail</u> need not read all of the data from devices that only perform block transfers.

       When using <u>tail</u> to process pathnames, and the <b>-c</b> option is not specified, it is recommended that  LC_ALL,
       or  at  least  LC_CTYPE  and  LC_COLLATE,  are  set to POSIX or C in the environment, since pathnames can
       contain byte sequences that do not form valid characters in some locales, in  which  case  the  utility's
       behavior  would  be  undefined.  In  the  POSIX  locale  each  byte is a valid single-byte character, and
       therefore this problem is avoided.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>-f</b> option can be used to monitor the growth of a file that is being written by  some  other  process.
       For example, the command:

           tail -f fred

       prints  the  last ten lines of the file <b>fred</b>, followed by any lines that are appended to <b>fred</b> between the
       time <u>tail</u> is initiated and killed. As another example, the command:

           tail -f -c 15 fred

       prints the last 15 bytes of the file <b>fred</b>, followed by any bytes that are appended to  <b>fred</b>  between  the
       time <u>tail</u> is initiated and killed.

</pre><h4><b>RATIONALE</b></h4><pre>
       This version of <u>tail</u> was created to allow conformance to the Utility Syntax Guidelines. The historical <b>-b</b>
       option  was  omitted  because  of the general non-portability of block-sized units of text. The <b>-c</b> option
       historically meant ``characters'', but this volume of POSIX.1‐2017 indicates  that  it  means  ``bytes''.
       This was selected to allow reasonable implementations when multi-byte characters are possible; it was not
       named <b>-b</b> to avoid confusion with the historical <b>-b</b>.

       The  origin  of  counting  both lines and bytes is 1, matching all widespread historical implementations.
       Hence <u>tail</u> <b>-n</b> +0 is not conforming usage because it attempts to output line zero; but note that <u>tail</u> <b>-n</b> 0
       does conform, and outputs nothing.

       Earlier versions of this standard allowed the following forms in the SYNOPSIS:

           tail -<b>[</b>number<b>][</b>b|c|l<b>][</b>f<b>]</b> <b>[</b><u>file</u><b>]</b>
           tail +<b>[</b>number<b>][</b>b|c|l<b>][</b>f<b>]</b> <b>[</b><u>file</u><b>]</b>

       These forms are no longer specified by POSIX.1‐2008, but may be present in some implementations.

       The restriction on the internal buffer is a compromise between the historical System V implementation  of
       4096 bytes and the BSD 32768 bytes.

       The  <b>-f</b>  option  has  been  implemented  as a loop that sleeps for 1 second and copies any bytes that are
       available. This is sufficient, but if more efficient methods of determining when new data  are  available
       are developed, implementations are encouraged to use them.

       Historical  documentation indicates that <u>tail</u> ignores the <b>-f</b> option if the input file is a pipe (pipe and
       FIFO on systems that support FIFOs). On BSD-based systems, this has been true; on System V-based systems,
       this was true when input was taken from standard input, but it did not ignore the <b>-f</b> flag if a  FIFO  was
       named  as the <u>file</u> operand. Since the <b>-f</b> option is not useful on pipes and all historical implementations
       ignore <b>-f</b> if no <u>file</u> operand is specified and standard input is  a  pipe,  this  volume  of  POSIX.1‐2017
       requires  this  behavior.  However,  since the <b>-f</b> option is useful on a FIFO, this volume of POSIX.1‐2017
       also requires that if a FIFO is named, the <b>-f</b> option shall not  be  ignored.  Earlier  versions  of  this
       standard did not state any requirement for the case where no <u>file</u> operand is specified and standard input
       is a FIFO. The standard has been updated to reflect current practice which is to treat this case the same
       as  a  pipe on standard input.  Although historical behavior does not ignore the <b>-f</b> option for other file
       types, this is unspecified so that implementations are allowed to ignore the <b>-f</b> option  if  it  is  known
       that the file cannot be extended.
