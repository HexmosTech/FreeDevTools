</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       dccpcli - DCCP-based BP convergence layer input task

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>dccpcli</b> <u>local_hostname</u>[:<u>local_port_nbr</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>dccpcli</b> is a background "daemon" task that receives DCCP datagrams via a DCCP socket bound to
       <u>local_hostname</u> and <u>local_port_nbr</u>, extracts bundles from those datagrams, and passes them to the bundle
       protocol agent on the local ION node.

       If not specified, port number defaults to 4556.

       Note that <b>dccpcli</b> has no fragmentation support at all. Therefore, the largest bundle that can be sent via
       this convergence layer is limited to just under the link's MTU (typically 1500 bytes).

       The convergence layer input task is spawned automatically by <b>bpadmin</b> in response to the 's' (START)
       command that starts operation of the Bundle Protocol; the text of the command that is used to spawn the
       task must be provided at the time the "dccp" convergence layer protocol is added to the BP database.  The
       convergence layer input task is terminated by <b>bpadmin</b> in response to an 'x' (STOP) command.  <b>dccpcli</b> can
       also be spawned and terminated in response to START and STOP commands that pertain specifically to the
       DCCP convergence layer protocol.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       "0" <b>dccpcli</b>  terminated  normally,  for  reasons  noted in the <b>ion.log</b> file.  If this termination was not
           commanded, investigate and solve the problem identified in the log file and use  <b>bpadmin</b>  to  restart
           <b>dccpcli</b>.

       "1" <b>dccpcli</b>  terminated  abnormally,  for  reasons  noted in the <b>ion.log</b> file.  Investigate and solve the
           problem identified in the log file, then use <b>bpadmin</b> to restart <b>dccpcli</b>.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       No configuration files are needed.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       No environment variables apply.

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       The following diagnostics may be issued to the <b>ion.log</b> log file:

       dccpcli can't attach to BP.
           <b>bpadmin</b> has not yet initialized Bundle Protocol operations.

       No such dccp duct.
           No DCCP induct matching <u>local_hostname</u> and <u>local_port_nbr</u> has been added to  the  BP  database.   Use
           <b>bpadmin</b>  to  stop  the  DCCP  convergence-layer  protocol,  add the induct, and then restart the DCCP
           protocol.

       CLI task is already started for this duct.
           Redundant initiation of <b>dccpcli</b>.

       dccpcli can't get IP address for host.
           Operating system error.  Check errtext, correct problem, and restart <b>dccpcli</b>.

       CLI can't open DCCP socket. This probably means DCCP is not supported on your system.
           Operating system error. This probably means that you are not using an operating system that  supports
           DCCP.  Make  sure  that  you  are  using  a  current Linux kernel and that the DCCP modules are being
           compiled. Check errtext, correct problem, and restart <b>dccpcli</b>.

       CLI can't initialize socket.
           Operating system error.  Check errtext, correct problem, and restart <b>dccpcli</b>.

       dccpcli can't get acquisition work area.
           ION system error.  Check errtext, correct problem, and restart <b>dccpcli</b>.

       dccpcli can't create new thread.
           Operating system error.  Check errtext, correct problem, and restart <b>dccpcli</b>.
