</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       tsp - task spooler. A simple unix batch system

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>tsp</b> <b>[</b><u>actions</u><b>]</b> <b>[</b><u>options</u><b>]</b> <b>[</b><u>command...</u><b>]</b>

       Actions:  <b>[-KClhV]</b>  <b>[-t</b>  <b>[</b><u>id</u><b>]]</b>  <b>[-c</b> <b>[</b><u>id</u><b>]]</b> <b>[-p</b> <b>[</b><u>id</u><b>]]</b> <b>[-o</b> <b>[</b><u>id</u><b>]]</b> <b>[-s</b> <b>[</b><u>id</u><b>]]</b> <b>[-r</b> <b>[</b><u>id</u><b>]]</b> <b>[-w</b> <b>[</b><u>id</u><b>]]</b> <b>[-k</b> <b>[</b><u>id</u><b>]]</b> <b>[-u</b>
       <b>[</b><u>id</u><b>]]</b> <b>[-i</b> <b>[</b><u>id</u><b>]]</b> <b>[-U</b> <b>&lt;</b><u>id</u><b>-</b><u>id</u><b>&gt;]</b> <b>[-S</b> <b>[</b><u>num</u><b>]]</b>

       Options: <b>[-nfgmd]</b> <b>[-L</b> <b>&lt;</b><u>label</u><b>&gt;]</b> <b>[-D</b> <b>&lt;</b><u>id</u><b>&gt;]</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>tsp</b> will run by default a per user unix task queue. The user can add commands to the  queue,  watch  that
       queue at any moment, and look at the task results (actually, standard output and exit error).

</pre><h4><b>SIMPLE</b> <b>USE</b></h4><pre>
       Calling  <b>tsp</b>  with  a  command  will  add  that  command to the queue, and calling it without commands or
       parameters will show the task list.

</pre><h4><b>COMMAND</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       When adding a job to ts, we can specify how it will be run and how will the results be collected:

       <b>-n</b>     Do not store the standard output/error in a file at <b>$TMPDIR</b> - let  it  use  the  file  descriptors
              decided  by the calling process. If it is not used, the <b>jobid</b> for the new task will be outputed to
              stdout.

       <b>-g</b>     Pass the output through gzip (only if <b>-n</b> ). Note that  the  output  files  will  not  have  a  .gz
              extension.

       <b>-f</b>     Don  not put the task into background. Wait the queue and the command run without getting detached
              of the terminal. The exit code will be that of the command, and  if  used  together  with  -n,  no
              result will be stored in the queue.

       <b>-m</b>     Mail  the  results  of  the  command  (output and exit code) to <b>$TS_MAILTO</b> , or to the <b>$USER</b> using
              <b>/usr/sbin/sendmail.</b>  Look at <b>ENVIRONMENT.</b>

       <b>-L</b> <b>&lt;label&gt;</b>
              Add a label to the task, which will appear next to its command when listing the  queue.  It  makes
              more comfortable distinguishing similar commands with different goals.

       <b>-d</b>     Run  the command only if the command before finished well (errorlevel = 0). This new task enqueued
              depends on the result of the previous command. If the task is not run, it is considered as  failed
              for further dependencies.

       <b>-D</b> <b>&lt;id&gt;</b>
              Run the command only if the job of given id finished well (errorlevel = 0). This new task enqueued
              depends  on the result of the previous command. If the task is not run, it is considered as failed
              for further dependencies.  If the server doesn't  have  the  job  id  in  its  list,  it  will  be
              considered as if the job failed.

       <b>-B</b>     In  the  case the queue is full (due to <b>TS_MAXCONN</b> or system limits), by default ts will block the
              enqueuing command. Using <b>-B</b>, if the queue is full it will exit returning the value  2  instead  of
              blocking.

       <b>-E</b>     Keep  two  different  output  files  for  the  command  stdout and stderr. stdout goes to the file
              announced by ts (look at <b>-o</b>), and stderr goes to the stdout file  with  an  additional  ".e".  For
              example,  /tmp/ts-out.SKsDw8  and  /tmp/ts-out.SKsDw8.e.   Only  the stdout file gets created with
              <b>mkstemp</b>, ensuring it does not overwrite any other; the ".e" will be overwritten if it existed.

       <b>-N</b> <b>&lt;num&gt;</b>
              Run the command only if there are num slots free in the queue. Without it, the  job  will  run  if
              there  is  one slot free. For example, if you use the queue to feed cpu cores, and you know that a
              job will take two cores, with <b>-N</b> you can let ts know that.

</pre><h4><b>ACTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Instead of giving a new command, we can use the parameters for other purposes:

       <b>-K</b>     Kill the <b>tsp</b> server for the calling client. This will remove the  unix  socket  and  all  the  <b>tsp</b>
              processes related to the queue. This will not kill the command being run at that time.

              It is not reliable to think that <b>tsp</b> <b>-K</b> will finish when the server is really killed. By now it is
              a race condition.

       <b>-C</b>     Clear the results of finished jobs from the queue.

       <b>-l</b>     Show  the  list  of  jobs  - to be run, running and finished - for the current queue.  This is the
              default behaviour if <b>tsp</b> is called without options.

       <b>-t</b> <b>[id]</b>
              Show the last ten lines of the output file of the named  job,  or  the  last  running/run  if  not
              specified.  If  the  job is still running, it will keep on showing the additional output until the
              job finishes. On exit, it returns the errorlevel of the job, as in <b>-c</b>.

       <b>-c</b> <b>[id]</b>
              Run the system's cat to the output file  of  the  named  job,  or  the  last  running/run  if  not
              specified.  It  will block until all the output can be sent to standard output, and will exit with
              the job errorlevel as in <b>-c</b>.

       <b>-p</b> <b>[id]</b>
              Show the pid of the named job, or the last running/run if not specified.

       <b>-o</b> <b>[id]</b>
              Show the output file name of the named job, or the last running/run if not specified.

       <b>-s</b> <b>[id]</b>
              Show the job state of the named job, or the last in the queue.

       <b>-r</b> <b>[id]</b>
              Remove the named job, or the last in the queue.

       <b>-w</b> <b>[id]</b>
              Wait for the named job, or for the last in the queue.

       <b>-k</b> <b>[id]</b>
              Kill the process group of the named job (SIGTERM), or the last running/run job if  not  specified.
              Equivalent to <b>kill</b> <b>--</b> <b>-`ts</b> <b>-p`</b>

       <b>-u</b> <b>[id]</b>
              Make  the  named  job  (or  the last in the queue) urgent - this means that it goes forward in the
              queue so it can run as soon as possible.

       <b>-i</b> <b>[id]</b>
              Show information about the named job (or the last run). It will show the command line, some  times
              related to the task, and also any information resulting from <b>TS_ENV</b> (Look at <b>ENVIRONMENT</b>).

       <b>-U</b> <b>&lt;id-id&gt;</b>
              Interchange the queue positions of the named jobs (separated by a hyphen and no spaces).

       <b>-h</b>     Show help on standard output.

       <b>-V</b>     Show the program version.

</pre><h4><b>MULTI-SLOT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>tsp</b>  by  default  offers a queue where each job runs only after the previous finished.  Nevertheless, you
       can change the maximum number of jobs running at once with the <b>-S</b> <b>[num]</b> parameter. We  call  that  number
       the <u>amount</u> <u>of</u> <u>slots</u>. You can also set the initial number of jobs with the environment variable <b>TS_SLOTS</b> <b>.</b>
       When  increasing  this  setting,  queued waiting jobs will be run at once until reaching the maximum set.
       When decreasing this setting, no other job will be run until it can meet the amount of running jobs  set.
       When  using an amount of slots greater than 1, the action of some commands may change a bit. For example,
       <b>-t</b> without <u>jobid</u> will tail the first job running, and <b>-d</b> will try to set the dependency with the last job
       added.

       <b>-S</b> <b>[num]</b>
              Set the maximum amount of running jobs at once. If you  don't  specify  <b>num</b>  it  will  return  the
              maximum amount of running jobs set.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>TS_MAXFINISHED</b>
              Limit the number of job results (finished tasks) you want in the queue. Use this option if you are
              tired of <b>-C.</b>

       <b>TS_MAXCONN</b>
              The  maximum number of ts server connections to clients. This will make the ts clients block until
              connections are freed. This helps, for example, on systems with a  limited  number  of  processes,
              because  each job waiting in the queue remains as a process. This variable has to be set at server
              start, and cannot be modified later.

       <b>TS_ONFINISH</b>
              If the variable exists pointing to an executable, it will be run by the client  after  the  queued
              job.  It  uses  execlp,  so  <b>PATH</b>  is  used  if  there are no slashes in the variable content. The
              executable is run with four parameters: <b>jobid</b> <b>errorlevel</b> <b>output_filename</b> and <b>command.</b>

       <b>TMPDIR</b> As the program output and the unix socket are thought to  be  stored  in  a  temporary  directory,
              <b>TMPDIR</b> will be used if defined, or <b><a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a></b> otherwise.

       <b>TS_SOCKET</b>
              Each  queue  has  a  related  unix  socket.  You can specify the socket path with this environment
              variable. This way, you can have a queue for your heavy disk operations, another for heavy use  of
              ram.,  and  have  a  simple  script/alias  wrapper  over ts for those special queues. If it is not
              specified, it will be <b>$TMPDIR/socket-ts.[uid].</b>

       <b>TS_SLOTS</b>
              Set the number of slots at the start of the server,  similar  to  <b>-S,</b>  but  the  contents  of  the
              variable are read only when running the first instance of <b>tsp.</b>

       <b>TS_MAILTO</b>
              Send  the letters with job results to the address specified in this variable.  Otherwise, they are
              sent to <b>$USER</b> or if not defined, <b>nobody.</b>  The system <b>/usr/sbin/sendmail</b> is used. The  job  outputs
              are not sent as an attachment, so understand the consequences if you use the <b>-gm</b> flags together.

       <b>USER</b>   As seen above, it is used for the mail destination if <b>TS_MAILTO</b> is not specified.

       <b>TS_SAVELIST</b>
              If  it  is defined when starting the queue server (probably the first <b>tsp</b> command run), on SIGTERM
              the queue status will be saved to the file pointed by this environment variable - for example,  at
              system shutdown.

       <b>TS_ENV</b> This  has  a  command to be run at enqueue time through <b><a href="file:/bin/sh">/bin/sh</a></b>. The output of the command will be
              readable through the option <b>-i</b>. You can use a command which shows  relevant  environment  for  the
              command run.  For example, you may use <b>TS_ENV='pwd;set;mount'</b>.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>/tmp/ts.error</b>
              if <b>tsp</b> finds any internal problem, you should find an error report there.  Please send this to the
              author as part of the bug report.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>tsp</b>  expects  a  simple command line. It does not start a shell parser.  If you want to run complex shell
       commands, you may want to run them through <b>sh</b> <b>-c</b> <b>'commands...'</b>  Also, remember  that  stdin/stdout/stderr
       will  be  detached,  so do not use your shell's redirection operators when you put a job into background.
       You can use them inside the <b>sh</b> <b>-c</b> in order to set redirections to the command run.

       If an internal problem is found in runtime, a file <b>/tmp/ts.error</b> is created, which you can submit to  the
       developer in order to fix the bug.
