</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       task - A command line todo manager.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>task</b> <b>&lt;filter&gt;</b> <b>&lt;command&gt;</b> <b>[</b> <b>&lt;mods&gt;</b> <b>|</b> <b>&lt;args&gt;</b> <b>]</b>
       <b>task</b> <b>--version</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Taskwarrior  is  a  command  line  todo  list  manager. It maintains a list of tasks that you want to do,
       allowing you to add/remove, and otherwise manipulate them.  Taskwarrior has a  rich  set  of  subcommands
       that allow you to do various things with it.

       At the core, Taskwarrior is a list processing program. You add text and additional related parameters and
       redisplay  the  information  in a nice way.  It turns into a todo list program when you add due dates and
       recurrence. It turns into an organized todo  list  program  when  you  add  priorities,  tags  (one  word
       descriptors), project groups, etc.

</pre><h4><b>FILTER</b></h4><pre>
       The  &lt;filter&gt;  consists  of  zero  or  more  search criteria that select tasks.  For example, to list all
       pending tasks belonging to the 'Home' project:

         task project:Home list

       You can specify multiple filter terms, each of which further restricts the result:

         task project:Home +weekend garden list

       This example applies three filters: the 'Home'  project,  the  'weekend'  tag,  and  the  description  or
       annotations  must  contain  the  character  sequence  'garden'.   In this example, 'garden' is translated
       internally to:

         description.contains:garden

       as a convenient shortcut.  The 'contains' here is an attribute modifier, which  is  used  to  exert  more
       control over the filter than simply absence or presence.  See the section 'ATTRIBUTE MODIFIERS' below for
       a complete list of modifiers.

       Note  that  a  filter  may have zero terms, which means that all tasks apply to the command.  This can be
       dangerous, and this special case is confirmed, and cannot be overridden.  For example, this command:

         task modify +work
         This command has no filter, and will modify all tasks.  Are you sure? (yes/no)

       will add the 'work' tag to all tasks, but only after confirmation.

       More filter examples:

         task                                      &lt;command&gt; &lt;mods&gt;
         task 28                                   &lt;command&gt; &lt;mods&gt;
         task +weekend                             &lt;command&gt; &lt;mods&gt;
         task +bills due.by:eom                    &lt;command&gt; &lt;mods&gt;
         task project:Home due.before:today        &lt;command&gt; &lt;mods&gt;
         task ebeeab00-ccf8-464b-8b58-f7f2d606edfb &lt;command&gt; &lt;mods&gt;

       By default filter elements are combined with an implicit 'and' operator, but 'or' and 'xor' may  also  be
       used, provided parentheses are included:

         task '( /[Cc]at|[Dd]og/ or /[0-9]+/ )'      &lt;command&gt; &lt;mods&gt;

       The  parentheses isolate the logical term from any default command filter or implicit report filter which
       would be combined with an implicit 'and'.

       A filter may target specific tasks using ID or UUID numbers.  To specify multiple tasks use one of  these
       forms (space-separated list of ID numbers, UUID numbers or ID ranges):

         task 1 2 3                                    delete
         task 1-3                                      info
         task 1 2-5 19                                 modify pri:H
         task 4-7 ebeeab00-ccf8-464b-8b58-f7f2d606edfb info

       Note  that  it may be necessary to properly escape special characters as well as quotes in order to avoid
       their special meanings in the shell. See also the section 'SPECIFYING DESCRIPTIONS' for more information.

</pre><h4><b>MODIFICATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The &lt;mods&gt; consist of zero or more changes to apply to the selected tasks, such as:

         task &lt;filter&gt; &lt;command&gt; project:Home
         task &lt;filter&gt; &lt;command&gt; +weekend +garden due:tomorrow
         task &lt;filter&gt; &lt;command&gt; Description/annotation text
         task &lt;filter&gt; &lt;command&gt; /from/to/     &lt;- replace first match
         task &lt;filter&gt; &lt;command&gt; /from/to/g    &lt;- replace all matches

</pre><h4><b>SUBCOMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       Taskwarrior supports different kinds of commands.  There are read commands, write commands, miscellaneous
       commands and script helper commands.  Read commands do not allow modification of tasks.   Write  commands
       can  alter  almost  any  aspect  of a task.  Script helper commands are provided to help you write add-on
       scripts, for example, shell completion (only minimal output is generated, as with verbose=nothing). Those
       commands which are explicitly affected by the <u>context</u> are denoted as such.

</pre><h4><b>READ</b> <b>SUBCOMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       Reports are read subcommands. There are several reports currently predefined in Taskwarrior.  The  output
       and  sort  behavior  of  these reports can be configured in the configuration file. See also the man page
       <a href="../man5/taskrc.5.html">taskrc</a>(5).  There are also other read subcommands that are not reports.

       <b>task</b> <b>--version</b>
              This is the only conventional command line argument that Taskwarrior supports, and is intended for
              add-on scripts to verify the version number of  an  installed  Taskwarrior  without  invoking  the
              mechanisms that create default files.

       <b>task</b> <b>&lt;filter&gt;</b>
              With no command specified, the default command is run, and the filter applied.

       <b>task</b> <b>&lt;filter&gt;</b> <b>active</b>
              Shows all tasks matching the filter that are started but not completed.

       <b>task</b> <b>&lt;filter&gt;</b> <b>all</b>
              Shows all tasks matching the filter, including parents of recurring tasks.

       <b>task</b> <b>&lt;filter&gt;</b> <b>blocked</b>
              Shows all tasks matching the filter, that are currently blocked by other tasks.

       <b>task</b> <b>&lt;filter&gt;</b> <b>blocking</b>
              Shows all tasks matching the filter, that block other tasks.

       <b>task</b> <b>&lt;filter&gt;</b> <b>burndown.daily</b>

       <b>task</b> <b>&lt;filter&gt;</b> <b>burndown.weekly</b>
              Shows   a  graphical  burndown  chart,  by  week.   Note  that  'burndown'  is  an  alias  to  the
              'burndown.weekly' report. Is affected by the context.

       <b>task</b> <b>&lt;filter&gt;</b> <b>burndown.monthly</b>

              argument  is  provided,  will  show  at  least  one complete year.  If a year is provided, such as
              '2015', then that full year is shown.  If both a month and a year are specified  ('6  2015')  then
              the  months  displayed  begin at the specified month and year.  If the 'due' argument is provided,
              will show the starting month of the earliest due task.

       <b>task</b> <b>colors</b> <b>[&lt;sample&gt;</b> <b>|</b> <b>legend]</b>
              Displays all possible colors, a named sample, or a legend containing all currently defined colors.

       <b>task</b> <b>columns</b> <b>[&lt;substring&gt;]</b>

              Exports  all  tasks in the JSON format.  Redirect the output to a file, if you wish to save it, or
              pipe it to another command or script to convert it to another format. You'll  find  these  example
              scripts online at &lt;https://taskwarrior.org/tools/&gt;:

                export-csv.pl
                export-sql.py
                export-xml.py

       <b>task</b> <b>&lt;filter&gt;</b> <b>ghistory.annual</b>
              Shows a graphical report of task status by year.

       <b>task</b> <b>&lt;filter&gt;</b> <b>ghistory.monthly</b>
              Shows  a  graphical  report  of  task  status  by  month.   Note  that  'ghistory'  is an alias to
              'ghistory.monthly'.

       <b>task</b> <b>&lt;filter&gt;</b> <b>ghistory.weekly</b>
              Shows a graphical report of task status by week.

       <b>task</b> <b>&lt;filter&gt;</b> <b>ghistory.daily</b>
              Shows a graphical report of task status by day.

       <b>task</b> <b>help</b>
              Shows the long usage text.

       <b>task</b> <b>&lt;filter&gt;</b> <b>history.annual</b>
              Shows a report of task history by year. Is affected by the context.

       <b>task</b> <b>&lt;filter&gt;</b> <b>history.monthly</b>
              Shows a report of task history by month.  Note that 'history' is an alias to 'history.monthly'. Is
              affected by the context.

       <b>task</b> <b>&lt;filter&gt;</b> <b>history.weekly</b>
              Shows a report of task history by week. Is affected by the context.

       <b>task</b> <b>&lt;filter&gt;</b> <b>history.daily</b>
              Shows a report of task history by day. Is affected by the context.

       <b>task</b> <b>&lt;filter&gt;</b> <b>ids</b>
              Applies the filter then extracts only the task IDs and presents them as  a  space-separated  list.
              This is useful as input to a task command, to achieve this:

                task $(task project:Home ids) modify priority:H

              This  example first gets the IDs for the project:Home filter, then sets the priority to H for each
              of those tasks.  This can also be achieved directly:

                task project:Home modify priority:H

              This command is mainly of use to external scripts.

       <b>task</b> <b>&lt;filter&gt;</b> <b>uuids</b>
              Applies the filter on all tasks (even deleted and completed tasks) then  extracts  only  the  task
              UUIDs  and presents them as a space-separated list.  This is useful as input to a task command, to
              achieve this:

                task $(task project:Home status:completed uuids) modify status:pending

              This example first gets the UUIDs for the project:Home and status:completed  filters,  then  makes
              each of those tasks pending again.

              This command is mainly of use to external scripts.

       <b>task</b> <b>udas</b>
              Shows a list of UDAs that are defined, including their name, type, label and allowed values.  Also
              shows UDA usage and any orphan UDAs.

       <b>task</b> <b>&lt;filter&gt;</b> <b>information</b>
              Shows  all  data  and  metadata for the specified tasks.  This is the only means of displaying all
              aspects of a given task, including the change history.

       <b>task</b> <b>&lt;filter&gt;</b> <b>list</b>
              Provides a standard listing of tasks matching the filter.

       <b>task</b> <b>&lt;filter&gt;</b> <b>long</b>
              Provides the most detailed listing of tasks matching the filter.

       <b>task</b> <b>&lt;filter&gt;</b> <b>ls</b>
              Provides a short listing of tasks matching the filter.

       <b>task</b> <b>&lt;filter&gt;</b> <b>minimal</b>
              Provides a minimal listing of tasks matching the filter.

       <b>task</b> <b>&lt;filter&gt;</b> <b>newest</b>
              Shows the newest tasks matching the filter.

       <b>task</b> <b>&lt;filter&gt;</b> <b>next</b>
              Shows a page of the most urgent tasks, sorted by urgency, which is a calculated value.

       <b>task</b> <b>&lt;filter&gt;</b> <b>ready</b>
              Shows a page of the most urgent ready tasks, sorted by urgency with started tasks first.  A  ready
              task is one that is either unscheduled, or has a scheduled date that is past and is not waiting.

       <b>task</b> <b>&lt;filter&gt;</b> <b>oldest</b>
              Shows the oldest tasks matching the filter.

       <b>task</b> <b>&lt;filter&gt;</b> <b>overdue</b>

       <b>task</b> <b>&lt;filter&gt;</b> <b>projects</b>
              Lists  all  project  names  that  are currently used by pending tasks, and the number of tasks for
              each. Is affected by the context.

       <b>task</b> <b>&lt;filter&gt;</b> <b>recurring</b>
              Shows all recurring tasks matching the filter.

       <b>task</b> <b>&lt;filter&gt;</b> <b>unblocked</b>
              Shows all tasks that are not currently blocked by other tasks, matching the filter.

       <b>task</b> <b>&lt;filter&gt;</b> <b>waiting</b>
              Shows all waiting tasks matching the filter.

</pre><h4><b>WRITE</b> <b>SUBCOMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>task</b> <b>add</b> <b>&lt;mods&gt;</b>
              Adds a new pending task to the task list. It is affected by the currently set context.

       <b>task</b> <b>&lt;filter&gt;</b> <b>annotate</b> <b>&lt;mods&gt;</b>
              Adds an annotation to an existing task.

       <b>task</b> <b>&lt;filter&gt;</b> <b>append</b> <b>&lt;mods&gt;</b>
              Appends description text to an existing task.

       <b>task</b> <b>&lt;filter&gt;</b> <b>delete</b> <b>&lt;mods&gt;</b>
              Deletes the specified task from task list. Is affected by the context.

       <b>task</b> <b>&lt;filter&gt;</b> <b>denotate</b> <b>&lt;mods&gt;</b>
              Deletes an annotation for the specified task. If the provided description  matches  an  annotation
              exactly,  the corresponding annotation is deleted. If the provided description matches annotations
              partly, the first partly matched annotation is deleted. Is affected by the context.

       <b>task</b> <b>&lt;filter&gt;</b> <b>done</b> <b>&lt;mods&gt;</b>
              Marks the specified task as done. Is affected by the context.

       <b>task</b> <b>&lt;filter&gt;</b> <b>duplicate</b> <b>&lt;mods&gt;</b>
              Duplicates the specified task and allows modifications. Is affected by the context.

       <b>task</b> <b>&lt;filter&gt;</b> <b>edit</b>
              Launches a text editor to let you modify all aspects of a task directly.  In general, this is  not
              the  recommended  method  of  modifying tasks, but is provided for exceptional circumstances.  Use
              carefully. Is affected by the context.

       <b>task</b> <b>import</b> <b>[&lt;file&gt;</b> <b>...]</b>
              Imports tasks in the JSON format.  Can be used to add new tasks, or update existing  ones.   Tasks
              are identified by their UUID.

              If no file or "-" is specified, import tasks from STDIN.

              Setting  rc.recurrence.confirmation to an appropriate level is recommended if import is to be used
              in automated workflows.  See <a href="../man5/taskrc.5.html">taskrc</a>(5).

              For importing other file formats, the standard task release comes with a few example scripts, such
              as:

                import-todo.sh.pl
                import-yaml.pl

       <b>task</b> <b>log</b> <b>&lt;mods&gt;</b>
              Adds a new task that is already completed, to the task list. It is affected by the  currently  set
              context.

              Modifies the existing task with provided information.

       <b>task</b> <b>&lt;filter&gt;</b> <b>prepend</b> <b>&lt;mods&gt;</b>
              Prepends description text to an existing task. Is affected by the context.

       <b>task</b> <b>&lt;filter&gt;</b> <b>purge</b>
              Permanently  removes  the specified tasks from the data files. Only tasks that are already deleted
              can be purged. This command has a local-only effect and changes introduced by it are  not  synced.
              Is affected by the context.

              Warning: causes permanent, non-revertible loss of data.

       <b>task</b> <b>&lt;filter&gt;</b> <b>start</b> <b>&lt;mods&gt;</b>
              Marks the specified tasks as started. Is affected by the context.

       <b>task</b> <b>&lt;filter&gt;</b> <b>stop</b> <b>&lt;mods&gt;</b>
              Removes the <u>start</u> time from the specified task. Is affected by the context.

</pre><h4><b>MISCELLANEOUS</b> <b>SUBCOMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       Miscellaneous subcommands either accept no command line arguments, or accept non-standard arguments.

       <b>task</b> <b>calc</b> <b>&lt;expression&gt;</b>
              Evaluates  an  algebraic  expression. Can be used to test how Taskwarrior parses and evaluates the
              expression given on the command line.

              Examples:

                  task calc 1 + 1
                  2

                  task calc now + 8d
                  2015-03-26T18:06:57

                  task calc eom
                  2015-03-31T23:59:59

       <b>task</b> <b>config</b> <b>[&lt;name&gt;</b> <b>[&lt;value&gt;</b> <b>|</b> <b>'']]</b>
              Add, modify and remove settings directly in the Taskwarrior configuration.   This  command  either
              modifies the 'name' setting with a new value of 'value', or adds a new entry that is equivalent to
              'name=value':

                  task config name value

              This command sets a blank value.  This has the effect of suppressing any default value:

                  task config name ''

              Finally, this command removes any 'name=...' entry from the .taskrc file:

                  task config name

       <b>task</b> <b>context</b> <b>&lt;name&gt;</b>
              Sets the currently active context. See the CONTEXT section.

              Example:

                  task context work

       <b>task</b> <b>context</b> <b>delete</b> <b>&lt;name&gt;</b>
              Deletes the context with the name &lt;name&gt;. If the context being deleted is currently set as active,
              it will be unset.

              Example:

                  task context delete work

       <b>task</b> <b>context</b> <b>define</b> <b>&lt;name&gt;</b> <b>&lt;filter&gt;</b>
              Defines  a  new context with name &lt;name&gt; and definition &lt;filter&gt;. This command does not affect the
              currently set context, just adds a new context definition.

              Examples:

                  task context define work project:Work
                  task context define home project:Home or +home
                  task context define superurgent due:today and +urgent

       <b>task</b> <b>context</b> <b>list</b>
              Outputs a list of available contexts along with their definitions.

       <b>task</b> <b>context</b> <b>none</b>
              Clears the currently active context, if any was set.

       <b>task</b> <b>context</b> <b>show</b>
              Shows the currently active context, along with its definition.

       <b>task</b> <b>diagnostics</b>
              Shows diagnostic information, of the kind needed when reporting a problem.  When you report a bug,
              it is likely that the platform, version, and environment  are  important.   Running  this  command
              generates a summary of similar information that should accompany a bug report.

              It  includes  compiler,  library  and  software  information.   It  does  not include any personal
              information, other than the location and size of your task data files.

              This command also performs a diagnostic scan of your data files looking for common problems,  such
              as duplicate UUIDs.

       <b>task</b> <b>execute</b> <b>&lt;external</b> <b>command&gt;</b>
              Executes  the  specified command.  Not useful by itself, but when used in conjunction with aliases
              and extensions can provide seamless integration.

       <b>task</b> <b>logo</b>
              Displays the Taskwarrior logo.

       <b>task</b> <b>news</b>
              Guides the user through important release notes anytime a new version of Taskwarrior is installed.
              It provides personalized feedback, deprecation warnings and usage advice, where applicable.

       <b>task</b> <b>reports</b>
              Lists all supported reports.  This includes the built-in reports, and any custom reports you  have
              defined.

       <b>task</b> <b>show</b> <b>[all</b> <b>|</b> <b>&lt;substring&gt;]</b>
              Shows  all  the  current  settings.  If a substring is specified just the settings containing that
              substring will be displayed.

       <b>task</b> <b>&lt;filter&gt;</b> <b>stats</b>
              Shows statistics of the tasks defined by the filter. Is affected by the context.

       <b>task</b> <b>&lt;filter&gt;</b> <b>summary</b>
              Shows a report of aggregated task status by project. Is affected by the context.

       <b>task</b> <b>sync</b> <b>[init]</b>
              The sync command synchronizes data with the Taskserver, if configured.

              The init subcommand should only ever be run once, and only on one client,  because  it  sends  all
              data to the Taskserver. This allows all the subsequent sync commands to only send small deltas.

              Note:  If  you use multiple sync clients, make sure this setting (which is the default) is on your
              primary client:

                recurrence=on

              and on all other clients (this is not the default):

                recurrence=off

              This is a workaround to avoid a recurrence bug that duplicates recurring tasks.

       <b>task</b> <b>&lt;filter&gt;</b> <b>tags</b>
              Show a list of all tags used. Any special tags used are highlighted. Note that  virtual  tags  are
              not  listed - they don't really exist, and are just a convenient notation for other task metadata.
              It is an error to attempt to add or remove a virtual tag. Is affected by the context.

       <b>task</b> <b>timesheet</b> <b>[&lt;weeks&gt;]</b>
              Shows a weekly report of tasks completed and started.

       <b>task</b> <b>undo</b>
              Reverts the most recent action.  Obeys the confirmation setting.

       <b>task</b> <b>version</b>
              Shows the Taskwarrior version number.

       <b>task</b> <b>_get</b> <b>&lt;DOM&gt;</b> <b>[&lt;DOM&gt;</b> <b>...]</b>
              Accesses and displays the DOM reference(s).  Used to extract individual values from tasks, or  the
              system.  Supported DOM references are:

                rc.&lt;name&gt;
                tw.syncneeded
                tw.program
                tw.args
                tw.width
                tw.height
                tw.version
                context.program    (Deprecated in 2.6.0)
                context.args       (Deprecated in 2.6.0)
                context.width      (Deprecated in 2.6.0)
                context.height     (Deprecated in 2.6.0)
                system.version
                system.os
                &lt;id&gt;.&lt;attribute&gt;
                &lt;uuid&gt;.&lt;attribute&gt;

              Note  that  the  'rc.&lt;name&gt;'  reference may need to be escaped using '--' to prevent the reference
              from being interpreted as an override.

              Note that if the DOM reference is not valid, or the reference evaluates to a  missing  value,  the
              command exits with 1.

              Additionally,  some  components  of  the  attributes  of  particular types may be extracted by DOM
              references.

                $ task _get 2.due.year
                2015

              For a full list of supported attribute-specific DOM references, consult the  online  documentation
              at: &lt;https://taskwarrior.org/docs/dom.html&gt;

</pre><h4><b>ATTRIBUTES</b> <b>AND</b> <b>METADATA</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ID</b>     Tasks  can  be  specified  uniquely  by IDs, which are simply the indexes of the tasks in the data
              file.  The ID of a task may therefore change, but only when a command is run  that  displays  IDs.
              When  modifying  tasks, it is safe to rely on the last displayed ID.  Always run a report to check
              you have the right ID for a task. IDs can be given to task as a sequence, for example,
              <b>task</b> <b>1,4-10,19</b> <b>delete</b>

       <b>+tag|-tag</b>
              Tags are arbitrary words associated with a task. Use + to add a tag and - to remove a tag  from  a
              task. A task can have any quantity of tags.

              Certain  tags  (called  'special  tags'),  can  be  used to affect the way tasks are treated.  For
              example, if a task has the special tag 'nocolor', then it is exempt from  all  color  rules.   The
              supported special tags are:

                  +nocolor     Disable color rules processing for this task
                  +nonag       Completion of this task suppresses all nag messages
                  +nocal       This task will not appear on the calendar
                  +next        Elevates task so it appears on 'next' report

              There  are also virtual tags, which represent task metadata in tag form.  These tags do not exist,
              but can be used to filter tasks.  The supported virtual tags are:

                  ACTIVE       Matches if the task is started
                  ANNOTATED    Matches if the task has annotations
                  BLOCKED      Matches if the task is blocked
                  BLOCKING     Matches if the task is blocking
                  CHILD        Matches if the task has a parent (deprecated in 2.6.0)
                  COMPLETED    Matches if the task has completed status
                  DELETED      Matches if the task has deleted status
                  DUE          Matches if the task is due
                  INSTANCE     Matches if the task is a recurrent instance
                  LATEST       Matches if the task is the newest added task
                  MONTH        Matches if the task is due this month
                  ORPHAN       Matches if the task has any orphaned UDA values
                  OVERDUE      Matches if the task is overdue
                  PARENT       Matches if the task is a parent (deprecated in 2.6.0)
                  PENDING      Matches if the task has pending status
                  PRIORITY     Matches if the task has a priority
                  PROJECT      Matches if the task has a project
                  QUARTER      Matches if the task is due this quarter
                  READY        Matches if the task is actionable
                  SCHEDULED    Matches if the task is scheduled
                  TAGGED       Matches if the task has tags
                  TEMPLATE     Matches if the task is a recurrence template
                  TODAY        Matches if the task is due today
                  TOMORROW     Matches if the task is due sometime tomorrow
                  UDA          Matches if the task has any UDA values
                  UNBLOCKED    Matches if the task is not blocked
                  UNTIL        Matches if the task expires
                  WAITING      Matches if the task is waiting
                  WEEK         Matches if the task is due this week
                  YEAR         Matches if the task is due this year
                  YESTERDAY    Matches if the task was due sometime yesterday

              You can use +BLOCKED to filter  blocked  tasks,  or  -BLOCKED  for  unblocked  tasks.   Similarly,
              -BLOCKED is equivalent to +UNBLOCKED. It is an error to attempt to add or remove a virtual tag.

       <b>project:&lt;project-name&gt;</b>
              Specifies the project to which a task is related to.

       <b>priority:H|M|L</b> <b>or</b> <b>priority:</b>
              Specifies High, Medium, Low and no priority for a task.

       <b>due:&lt;due-date&gt;</b>
              Specifies the due-date of a task.

       <b>recur:&lt;frequency&gt;</b>
              Specifies the frequency of a recurrence of a task.

       <b>scheduled:&lt;ready-date&gt;</b>
              Specifies the date after which a task can be accomplished.

       <b>until:&lt;expiration</b> <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>task&gt;</b>
              Specifies the expiration date of a task, after which it will be deleted.

       <b>limit:&lt;number-of-rows&gt;</b>
              Specifies  the  desired number of tasks a report should show, if a positive integer is given.  The
              value 'page' may also be used, and will limit the report output to as many lines of text  as  will
              fit on screen.  This defaults to 25 lines.

       <b>wait:&lt;wait-date&gt;</b>
              When a task is given a wait date, it is hidden from most built-in reports, which exclude +WAITING.
              When  the  date  is  in  the past, the task is not considered +WAITING, and again becomes visible.
              Note that, for compatibilty, such tasks are shown as having status "waiting", but this will change
              in a future release.

       <b>depends:&lt;id1,id2</b> <b>...&gt;</b>
              Declares this task to be dependent on id1 and id2.  This means that the tasks id1 and  id2  should
              be completed before this task.  Consequently, this task will then show up on the 'blocked' report.
              It  accepts  a comma-separated list of ID numbers, UUID numbers and ID ranges.  When prefixing any
              element of this list by '-', the specified tasks are removed from the dependency list.

       <b>entry:&lt;entry-date&gt;</b>
              For report purposes, specifies the date that a task was created.

</pre><h4><b>ATTRIBUTE</b> <b>MODIFIERS</b></h4><pre>
       Attribute modifiers improve filters.  Supported modifiers are:

              <b>before</b> <b>(synonyms</b> <b>under,</b> <b>below)</b>
              <b>after</b> <b>(synonyms</b> <b>over,</b> <b>above)</b>
              <b>by</b>
              <b>none</b>
              <b>any</b>
              <b>is</b> <b>(synonym</b> <b>equals)</b>
              <b>isnt</b> <b>(synonym</b> <b>not)</b>
              <b>has</b> <b>(synonym</b> <b>contains)</b>
              <b>hasnt</b>
              <b>startswith</b> <b>(synonym</b> <b>left)</b>
              <b>endswith</b> <b>(synonym</b> <b>right)</b>
              <b>word</b>
              <b>noword</b>

       They can be applied to all regular attributes (see above) and the following calculated attributes:

              <b>urgency</b> (or short <b>urg</b>)

       For example:

              task due.before:eom priority.not:L list

       The <u>before</u> modifier is used to  compare  values,  preserving  semantics,  so  project.before:B  list  all
       projects  that  begin with 'A'.  Priority 'L' is before 'M', and due:2011-01-01 is before due:2011-01-02.
       The synonyms 'under' and 'below' are included to allow filters that read more naturally.

       The <u>after</u> modifier is the inverse of the <u>before</u> modifier.

       The <u>by</u> modifier is the same as 'before', except it also includes the moment in question.  For example:

           task add test due:eoy

       will be found when using the inclusive filter 'by':

           task due.by:eoy

       but not when the non-inclusive filter 'before' is used:

           task due.before:eoy

       this applies equally to other named dates such as 'eom', 'eod', etc; the  modifier  compares  using  '&lt;='
       rather than '&lt;' like 'before' does.

       The <u>none</u> modifier requires that the attribute does not have a value.  For example:

           task priority:      list
           task priority.none: list

       are equivalent, and list tasks that do not have a priority.

       The <u>any</u> modifier requires that the attribute has a value, but any value will suffice.

       The <u>is</u> modifier requires an exact match with the value.

       The <u>isnt</u> modifier is the inverse of the <u>is</u> modifier.

       The <u>has</u> modifier is used to search for a substring, such as:

           task description.has:foo list
           task foo                 list

       These are equivalent and will return any task that has 'foo' in the description or annotations.

       The <u>hasnt</u> modifier is the inverse of the <u>has</u> modifier.

       The <u>startswith</u> modifier matches against the left, or beginning of an attribute, such that:

           task project.startswith:H list
           task project:H            list

       are equivalent and will match any project starting with 'H'.  Matching all projects not starting with 'H'
       is done with:

           task project.not:H         list

       The <u>endswith</u> modifier matches against the right, or end of an attribute.

       The <u>word</u> modifier requires that the attribute contain the whole word specified, such that this:

           task description.word:bar list

       Will match the description 'foo bar baz' but does not match 'dog food'.

       The <u>noword</u> modifier is the inverse of the <u>word</u> modifier.

</pre><h4><b>EXPRESSIONS</b> <b>AND</b> <b>OPERATORS</b></h4><pre>
       You can use the following operators in filter expressions:

         and  or  xor  !               Logical operators
         &lt;  &lt;=  =  ==  !=  !==  &gt;=  &gt;  Relational operators
         (  )                          Precedence

       For example:

         task due.before:eom priority.not:L list
         task '( due &lt; eom or priority != L )' list
         task '! ( project:Home or project:Garden )' list

       The <u>=</u> operator tests for approximate equality.  Dates compare equal if they are on the same day (hour and
       minutes  are  ignored).  Strings compare equal if the left operand starts with the right operand.  The <u>==</u>
       operator tests for exact equality.  The <u>!=</u> and <u>!==</u> operators are the negation of <u>=</u> and  <u>==</u>  respectively.
       The negation operator is <u>!</u>.

       Note  that the parentheses are required when using a logical operator other than the 'and' operator.  The
       reason is that some reports contain filters that must be combined with the command line.   Consider  this
       example:

         task project:Home or project:Garden list

       While this looks correct, it is not.  The 'list' report contains a filter of:

         task show report.list.filter

         Config Variable    Value
         -----------------  --------------
         report.list.filter status:pending

       Which means the example is really:

         task status:pending project:Home or project:Garden list

       The implied 'and' operator makes it:

         task status:pending and project:Home or project:Garden list

       This is a precedence error - the 'and' and 'or' need to be grouped using parentheses, like this:

         task status:pending and ( project:Home or project:Garden ) list

       The original example therefore must be entered as:

         task '( project:Home or project:Garden )' list

       This  includes  quotes  to escape the parentheses, so that the shell doesn't interpret them and hide them
       from Taskwarrior.

       There is redundancy between operators, attribute modifiers and other syntactic sugar.  For  example,  the
       following are all equivalent:

</pre><h4><b>CONTEXT</b></h4><pre>
       Context is a user-defined query, which is automatically applied to all commands that filter the task list
       and to commands that create new tasks (add, log). For example, any report command will  have  its  result
       affected by the current active context.  Here is a list of the commands that are affected:

                  add
                  burndown
                  count
                  delete
                  denotate
                  done
                  duplicate
                  edit
                  history
                  log
                  prepend
                  projects
                  purge
                  start
                  stats
                  stop
                  summary
                  tags

              All other commands are NOT affected by the context.

                  $ task list
                  ID Age Project  Description        Urg
                  1  2d  Sport    Run 5 miles        1.42
                  2  1d  Home     Clean the dishes   1.14

                  $ task context home
                  Context 'home' set. Use 'task context none' to remove.

                  $ task list
                  ID Age Project  Description        Urg
                  2  1d  Home     Clean the dishes   1.14
                  Context 'home' set. Use 'task context none' to remove.

              Task list got automatically filtered for project:Home.

                  $ task add Vaccuum the carpet
                  Created task 3.
                  Context 'home' set. Use 'task context none' to remove.

                  $ task list
                  ID Age Project  Description         Urg
                  2  1d  Home     Clean the dishes    1.14
                  3  5s  Home     Vaccuum the carpet  1.14
                  Context 'home' set. Use 'task context none' to remove.

              Note that the newly added task "Vaccuum the carpet" has "project:Home" set automatically.

              As  seen in the example above, context is applied by specifying its name to the "context" command.
              To change the currently applied context, just  pass  the  new  context's  name  to  the  'context'
              command.

              To unset any context, use the 'none' subcommand.

                  $ task context none
                  Context unset.

                  $ task list
                  ID Age Project  Description         Urg
                  1  2d  Sport    Run 5 miles         1.42
                  2  1d  Home     Clean the dishes    1.14
                  3  7s  Home     Vaccuum the carpet  1.14

              Context can be defined using the 'define' subcommand, specifying both the name of the new context,
              and it's assigned filter.

                  $ task context define home project:Home
                  Are you sure you want to add 'context.home.read' with a value of 'project:Home'? (yes/no) yes
                  Are you sure you want to add 'context.home.write' with a value of 'project:Home'? (yes/no) yes
                  Context 'home' successfully defined.

              Note  that you were separately prompted to set the 'read' and 'write' context.  This allows you to
              specify contexts that only work for reporting commands or only for commands that create tasks.

              To remove the definition, use the 'delete' subcommand.

                  $ task context delete home
                  Are you sure you want to remove 'context.home.read'? (yes/no) yes
                  Are you sure you want to remove 'context.home.write'? (yes/no) yes
                  Context 'home' deleted.

              To check what is the currently active context, use the 'show' subcommand.

                  $ task context show
                  Context 'home' with

                  * read filter: '+home'
                  * write filter: '+home'

                  is currently applied.

              Contexts can store arbitrarily complex filters.

                  $ task context define family project:Family or +paul or +nancy
                  Are you sure you want to add 'context.family.read' with a value of 'project:Family or +paul or
              +nancy'? (yes/no) yes
                  Are you sure you want to add 'context.family.write' with a value of 'project:Family  or  +paul
              or +nancy'? (yes/no) no
                  Context 'family' successfully defined.

              Contexts  are  permanent,  and  the  currently  set  context  name  is  stored  in  the  "context"
              configuration  variable.  The  context  definition  is   stored   in   the   "context.&lt;name&gt;.read"
              configuration  variable (for reporting commands) and "context.&lt;name&gt;.write" configuration variable
              (for task additions, i.e. task add/log).

              Note that in the example above, the user decided not to define the  complex  filter  as  writeable
              context.  The reason for this decision is that the complex filter in the example does not directly
              translate to a modification. In fact, if such a context  is  used  as  a  writeable  context,  the
              following happens:

                  $ task add Call Paul
                  Created task 4.
                  Context 'family' set. Use 'task context none' to remove.

                  $ task 4 list
                  ID Age  Project Tags       Description      Urg
                   4 9min Family  nancy paul or or Call Paul    0

              There  is  no clear mapping between the complex filter used and the modifications (should only the
              project be set? only the tags? both?). Additionally note the 'or' operators being present  in  the
              description.  Taskwarrior  does not try to guess the user intention here, and instead, the user is
              expected to set the "context.&lt;name&gt;.write" variable to make their intention explicit, for example:

                  $ task config context.family.write project:Family
                  Are you sure you want to change the value of 'context.family.write'  from  'project:Family  or
              +paul or +nancy' to 'project:Family'? (yes/no) yes
                  Config file /home/tbabej/.config/task/taskrc modified.

                  $ task context
                  Name   Type  Definition                        Active
                  family read  project:Family or +paul or +nancy yes
                         write project:Family                    yes
                  home   read  +home                             no
                         write +home                             no

              Note  how  read and write contexts differ for context "family", while for context "home" they stay
              the same.

              In addition, every  configuration  parameter  can  be  overridden  for  the  current  context,  by
              specifying  context.&lt;name&gt;.rc.&lt;parameter&gt;.  For  example,  if  the  default command for the family
              context should be displaying the family_report:

                  $ task config context.family.rc.default.command family_report

</pre><h4><b>COMMAND</b> <b>ABBREVIATION</b></h4><pre>
       All Taskwarrior commands may be abbreviated as long as a unique prefix is used, for example:

              $ task li

       is an unambiguous abbreviation for

              $ task list

       but

              $ task l

       could be list, ls or long.

       Note that you can restrict the minimum abbreviation size using the configuration setting:

              abbreviation.minimum=3

</pre><h4><b>SPECIFYING</b> <b>DESCRIPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Some task descriptions need to be escaped because of the shell and the special meaning of some characters
       to the shell. This can be done either by adding  quotes  to  the  description  or  escaping  the  special
       character:

              $ task add "quoted ' quote"
              $ task add escaped \' quote

       The argument -- (a double dash) tells Taskwarrior to treat all other args as description:

              $ task add -- project:Home needs scheduling

       In other situations, the shell sees spaces and breaks up arguments.  For example, this command:

              $ task 123 modify /from this/to that/

       is broken up into several arguments, which is corrected with quotes:

              $ task 123 modify "/from this/to that/"

       It is sometimes necessary to force the shell to pass quotes to Taskwarrior intact, so you can use:

              $ task add project:\'Three Word Project\' description

       Taskwarrior supports Unicode using only the UTF8 encoding, with no Byte Order Marks in the data files.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>FILE</b> <b>AND</b> <b>OVERRIDE</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Taskwarrior  stores  its  configuration  in  a  file in the user's home directory: <a href="file:~/.taskrc.">~/.taskrc.</a> The default
       configuration file can be overridden with:

       <b>task</b> <b>rc:&lt;path-to-alternate-file&gt;</b> <b>...</b>
              Specifies an alternate configuration file with highest priority.

       <b>TASKRC=&lt;path-to-alternate-file&gt;</b> <b>task</b> <b>..</b>
              The environment variable specifies an alternate configuration file to use.

       <b>XDG_CONFIG_HOME=&lt;path-to-alternate-config-home&gt;</b> <b>task</b> <b>..</b>
              The environment variable specifies an alternate configuration file to use.

       <b>task</b> <b>rc.&lt;name&gt;:&lt;value&gt;</b> <b>...</b>
              <b>task</b> <b>rc.&lt;name&gt;=&lt;value&gt;</b> <b>...</b>  Specifies individual configuration file overrides.

       <b>TASKDATA=/tmp/.task</b> <b>task</b> <b>...</b>
              The environment variable overrides the default, and the 'data.location' configuration  setting  of
              the task data directory.

</pre><h4><b>MORE</b> <b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       For examples please see the online documentation starting at

              &lt;https://taskwarrior.org/docs&gt;

       Note that the online documentation can be more detailed and more current than this man page.

       <a href="file:~/.task">~/.task</a>
              The  default  directory  where  task  stores its data files. The location can be configured in the
              configuration variable 'data.location', or overridden with the TASKDATA environment variable..

       <a href="file:~/.task/pending.data">~/.task/pending.data</a>
              The file that contains the tasks that are not yet done.

       <a href="file:~/.task/completed.data">~/.task/completed.data</a>
              The file that contains the completed ("done") tasks.

       <a href="file:~/.task/undo.data">~/.task/undo.data</a>
              The file that contains information needed by the "undo" command.
