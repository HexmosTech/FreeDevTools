</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       tcpcli - DTN TCPCL-compliant convergence layer input task

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>tcpcli</b> <u>local_hostname</u>[:<u>local_port_nbr</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>tcpcli</b> is a background "daemon" task comprising 1 + N threads: one that handles TCP connections from
       remote <b>tcpclo</b> tasks, spawning sockets for data reception from those tasks, plus one input thread for each
       spawned socket to handle data reception over that socket.

       The connection thread simply accepts connections on a TCP socket bound to <u>local_hostname</u> and
       <u>local_port_nbr</u> and spawns reception threads.  The default value for <u>local_port_nbr</u>, if omitted, is 4556.

       Each time a connection is established, the end-points will first exchange contact headers, because
       connection parameters need to be negotiated.  <b>tcpcli</b> records the acknowledgement flags, reactive
       fragmentation flag and negative acknowledgements flag in the contact header it receives from its peer
       <b>tcpclo</b> task.

       Each reception thread receives bundles over the associated connected socket.  Each bundle received on the
       connection is preceded by message type, fragmentation flags, and size represented as an SDNV.  The
       received bundles are passed to the bundle protocol agent on the local ION node.

       <b>tcpcli</b> is spawned automatically by <b>bpadmin</b> in response to the 's' (START) command that starts operation
       of the Bundle Protocol; the text of the command that is used to spawn the task must be provided at the
       time the "tcp" convergence layer protocol is added to the BP database.  The convergence layer input task
       is terminated by <b>bpadmin</b> in response to an 'x' (STOP) command.  <b>tcpcli</b> can also be spawned and terminated
       in response to START and STOP commands that pertain specifically to the TCP convergence layer protocol.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       "0" <b>tcpcli</b>  terminated  normally,  for  reasons  noted  in the <b>ion.log</b> file.  If this termination was not
           commanded, investigate and solve the problem identified in the log file and use  <b>bpadmin</b>  to  restart
           <b>tcpcli</b>.

       "1" <b>tcpcli</b>  terminated  abnormally,  for  reasons  noted  in the <b>ion.log</b> file.  Investigate and solve the
           problem identified in the log file, then use <b>bpadmin</b> to restart <b>tcpcli</b>.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       No configuration files are needed.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       No environment variables apply.

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       The following diagnostics may be issued to the <b>ion.log</b> log file:

       tcpcli can't attach to BP.
           <b>bpadmin</b> has not yet initialized Bundle Protocol operations.

       No such tcp duct.
           No TCP induct matching <u>local_hostname</u> and <u>local_port_nbr</u> has been added  to  the  BP  database.   Use
           <b>bpadmin</b>  to  stop  the  TCP  convergence-layer  protocol,  add  the  induct, and then restart the TCP
           protocol.

       CLI task is already started for this duct.
           Redundant initiation of <b>tcpcli</b>.

       Can't get IP address for host
           Operating system error.  Check errtext, correct problem, and restart TCP.

       Can't open TCP socket
           Operating system error.  Check errtext, correct problem, and restart TCP.

       Can't initialize socket
           Operating system error.  Check errtext, correct problem, and restart TCP.

       tcpcli can't create access thread
           Operating system error.  Check errtext, correct problem, and restart TCP.
