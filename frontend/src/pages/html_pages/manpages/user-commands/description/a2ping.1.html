</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
  a2ping.pl  --  convert  between  PS,  EPS  and PDF and other page description
  formats

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>a2ping.pl</b> [<b>--</b>]<b>help</b>
   <b>a2ping.pl</b> [<b>--</b>]<b>doc</b>
   <b>a2ping.pl</b> [<u>options</u>] &lt;<u>inputfile</u>&gt; [[<u>outformat</u>:] <u>outputfile</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
  <b>a2ping</b> is a UNIX command line utility written  in  Perl  that  converts  many
  raster  image  and  vector  graphics  formats  to  EPS  or PDF and other page
  description formats. Accepted input file formats are: PS  (PostScript),  EPS,
  PDF,  PNG,  JPEG,  TIFF,  PNM,  BMP, GIF, LBM, XPM, PCX, TGA. Accepted output
  formats are: EPS, PCL5, PDF, PDF1, PBM, PGM, PPM,  PS,  markedEPS,  markedPS,
  PNG,  XWD, BMP, TIFF, JPEG, GIF, XPM.  <b>a2ping</b> delegates the low-level work to
  Ghostscript (GS), <b>pdftops</b> and <b>sam2p</b>. <b>a2ping</b> fixes many  glitches  during  the
  EPS  to  EPS  conversion,  so  its output is often more compatible and better
  embeddable than its input.

  Without  the  "--below"  option,  it  is  guarenteed  to  start  at  the  0,0
  coordinate. "--below", "--hires" and "-v" are recommended options.

  The  page  size  is set exactly corresponding to the BoundingBox.  This means
  that when Ghostscript renders it, the result needs no cropping, and  the  PDF
  MediaBox is correct.

  If  the  bounding box is not right, of course, you have problems. If you feed
  crap in, you get crap. But you can supply the <b>--bboxfrom=compute-gs</b> option to
  make GS recompute the bounding box.

  The name of the input file doesn't matter -- <b>a2ping</b> detects the  file  format
  based on the first few bytes of the file. The name of the output file matters
  if  <u>outformat</u>  is  missing  from  the command line: then the extension of the
  output file determines the FileFormat (<u>outformat</u>).

</pre><h4><b>EXTERNAL</b> <b>PROGRAMS</b></h4><pre>
  The internal file format of <b>a2ping.pl</b> is PS/EPS.  Everything  read  is  first
  converted  to  PS  or EPS, then processed by <b>a2ping.pl</b>, then converted to the
  output format.

  To analyse the bounding box and other properties of non-EPS PS files (and EPS
  files with option <b>--bboxfrom</b> other than <b>=guess</b>), GS is used. Converting PS to
  EPS involves this analysis.

  To write PDF files, GS is used.

  To read PDF files, <b>pdftops</b> from the <b>xpdf</b> package is used.

  Sampled input formats are PNG, JPEG, TIFF, PNM, BMP, GIF, LBM, XPM,  PCX  and
  TGA.  To  read  sampled input formats, <b>sam2p</b> is used. <b>sam2p</b> is a raster image
  converter written in C++ by the author of <b>a2ping.pl</b>.

  Extra output formats are PNG, XWD, BMP, TIFF, JPEG, GIF  and  XPM.  To  write
  extra output formats, <b>sam2p</b> and GS are used.

  PNM  output  formats are PGM, PGM and PPM. To write PNM output formats, GS is
  used.

</pre><h4><b>TIPS</b> <b>AND</b> <b>TRICKS</b></h4><pre>
  • If your EPS contains a wrong bounding  box,  you  can  fix  it  by  running
    "a2ping.pl -v --bboxfrom=compute-gs thefile.eps --"

  • You  can  specify  <b>-</b>  as  <u>inputfile</u>  to  get stdin and as <u>outputfile</u> to get
    stdout. This works even for PDF files (which  must  be  seekable),  because
    <b>a2ping</b> copies them to a temporary file automatically.

  • If  <u>inputfile</u> and <u>outputfile</u> are the same, <b>a2ping</b> copies the <u>inputfile</u> to a
    temporary location first. However, this usage is recommended only if  there
    is  a  backup of the file to be restored in case <b>a2ping</b> doesn't produce the
    desired result.

  • If you specify <b>--</b> as <u>outputfile</u>, it will be the same as <u>inputfile</u>.

  • <b>a2ping</b> respects <b>--Duplex</b> for FileFormat PCL5, even though GS doesn't.

  • If you have an incompatible PS that GS can read  but  your  printer  cannot
    print, just run "a2ping.pl foo.ps PDF: - | a2ping.pl - PS: foo.ps"

  • If  you  have  a PS coming from Win32 (often with extension ".prn"), run it
    through <b>a2ping</b>. It will remove the resolution changes and the progress text
    printed to the terminal (which confuses <b><a href="../man1/gv.1.html">gv</a></b>(1) and makes some filters in the
    print queue emit incorrect output).

  • <b>a2ping</b> does antialiasing (<b>--antialias=scale3no</b>) of glyphs and  curves  when
    emitting  a sampled image (FileFormats such as PGM and PPM).  This improves
    readability of the glyphs. <b>=yes</b> instructs GS to do  internal  antialiasing,
    but  it  usually  doesn't  improve  much.  <b>=scale3no</b>  turns off GS internal
    antialiasing, but makes it render everything 3x3 as big, and then scales it
    back  down.  <b>=scale3no</b>  turns  on  both  3x3  scaling   and   GS   internal
    antialiasing, which results in thicker lines and worse quality in general.

  • When creating a PBM file, antialiasing usually doesn't improve the quality,
    so  it  is  switched off by default. But if you set <b>--antialias=scale3no</b> or
    <b>--antialias=scale3yes</b>, GS  will  render  a  PGM  file,  and  the  value  of
    <b>--threshold</b> determines the minimum intensity for white in the final PBM.

  • If  you  need  a bigger sampled output file, specify a larger <b>--Resolution</b>.
    The default is <b>--Resolution=72</b>. If your sampled output file is going to  be
    really  big,  you  should  specify  <b>--AntiAlias=yes</b>  instead of the default
    <b>--AntiAlias=scale3no</b> to speed up conversion.

  • To make sure fonts are included in a  PDF  file  generated  from  eps,  use
    <b>--gsextra='-dEmbedAllFonts=true</b> <b>-dPDFSETTINGS=/printer'</b>.

</pre><h4><b>MISC</b></h4><pre>
  • Doesn't depend on the filename or extension of the input file.

  • Conversion from EPS to PDF: fixes glitches etc., calls gs -sDEVICE=pdfwrite

  • Conversion  from  EPS  to  EPS:  fixes various glitches, moves (llx,lly) to
    (0,0), removes binary junk from the beginning of the EPS etc.

  • Conversion from PDF to PDF: keeps the file intact

  • Conversion from PDF to EPS: calls pdftops -eps (of the xpdf package)

  • Conversion from PS to EPS: keeps 1st page only, removes setpagedevice etc.
