</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       gpg-remailer - forward re-encrypted/signed PGP/GPG encrypted/signed mail to a group

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>gpg-remailer</b> [OPTIONS]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Gpg-remailer  decrypts  received  PGP/GPG  messages, verifies the received signature, and re-encrypts the
       e-mail for a well defined group of recipients. Gpg-remailer can also  be  configured  so  as  to  process
       clear-text e-mail.

       Using  gpg-remailer  the  list  of  members  of  a  group  of  people  who want to exchange encrypted and
       authenticated e-mails (and maybe also clear-text messages) can be maintained at  one  location,  allowing
       the  members  of  the  group  to specify just one e-mail address to send PGP/GPG signed and encrypted (or
       optionally clear-text) e-mail to.

       Gpg-remailer reads incoming e-mail from its standard input stream.

       If the incoming e-mail is clear-text, it resends the e-mail to one or more configurable e-mail addresses.

       If the incoming e-mail  is  PGP/GPG  encrypted  (and  optionally  signed)  it  re-encrypts  the  received
       information  for  every  member  of a configurable group, and send the re-encrypted information to one or
       more configurable e-mail addresses.

       By itself, gpg-remailer is not a mailing list. However, the configured recipient address could be,  e.g.,
       a  mailing list address, for further distribution of the processed e-mail. Gpg-remailer is a <u>remailer</u>: it
       uses the message’s data, but not its headers. Having received an e-mail it resends, rather than forwards,
       the received e-mail. The e-mail that is received via gpg-remailer therefore contains a completely new set
       of e-mail headers.

       A configuration file as well as command line options can be used to fine-tune gpg-remailer’s behavior.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       Gpg-remailer always returns 0 to the operating system to prevent <u>unknown</u> <u>mailer</u>  <u>error</u>  messages  in  the
       MTA’s logs. However, when gpg-remailer ends prematurely an error message is written to the standard error
       stream.

</pre><h4><b>REQUIREMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       In order to use gpg-remailer the following requirements must be met (all commands should be issued by the
       <u>root</u> user):

       o      Since  multiple  groups  may use gpg-remailer it is advised to define functional accounts handling
              e-mail to be processed by gpg-remailer. A functional  account  <u>secmail</u>  can  be  defined  using  a
              command like this:

                  adduser --home /var/lib/secmail --disabled-password secmail

       o      All  locations  used  by  the gpg-remailer must be given highly restrictive permissions. E.g., the
              functional accounts should set <u>umask</u> <u>077</u>. It is the responsibility of the user to make  sure  that
              the access rights are correctly configured.

       o      Consider   making  all  functional  gpg-remailer  accounts  members  of  a  special  group  (e.g.,
              <u>gpg-remailer</u>) and allow execution of <u>/usr/sbin/gpg-remailer</u> only my members of that group:

                  addgroup gpg-remailer
                  adduser secmail gpg-remailer
                  chown root.gpg-remailer /usr/sbin/gpg-remailer
                  chmod o-rx /usr/bin/gpg-remailer

       o      To allow the functional account to handle incoming  e-mail  <b><a href="../man1/sudo.1.html">sudo</a></b>(1)  can  be  used.  In  the  file
              <u><a href="file:/etc/sudoers">/etc/sudoers</a></u>  the following lines can be entered (<u>REMAILERS</u> can be given a comma separated list of
              functional account names, <u>mailhost.org</u> should be  replaced  by  the  name  of  the  host  handling
              incoming e-mail):

              Runas_Alias REMAILERS = secmail

              mail    mailhost.org=(REMAILERS) NOPASSWD:  /usr/sbin/gpg-remailer

              E.g.,  if  gpg-remailer  runs  on a computer named <u>remailer.mydomain.nl</u> which may receive incoming
              e-mails, then specify <u>remailer.mydomain.nl</u> for <u>mailhost.org</u>.

       o      An e-mail address must be defined to where the mail to reencrypt must  be  sent  to.  This  e-mail
              address  must  be  known  by  the  members  of the group who want to use the gpg-remailer. Such an
              account could be, e.g., <u><a href="mailto:secmail@mailhost.org">secmail@mailhost.org</a></u>, appearing  as  a  defined  mail  address  in,  e.g.,
              <u>/etc/mail/aliases</u>.  The  address  for  this example would be entered in the <u>/etc/mail/aliases</u> file
              (some installations use <u>/etc/aliases</u>) in this way:

                  secmail:         "|sudo -u secmail /usr/sbin/gpg-remailer"

</pre><h4><b>THE</b> <b>PSEUDO</b> <b>USER’S</b> <b>PGP</b> <b>KEY</b> <b>RINGS</b></h4><pre>
       o      The functional account must be provided with a GPG/PGP keypair. Its public key must be distributed
              over the people who are allowed to send mail to the gpg-remailer (which may be the  world  if  the
              public  key  is  published at a PGP key server). Since the gpg-remailer must be able to act on its
              own, the secret key must not require a passphrase. The key can be created as  follows  (after  the
              initial command, which is specified by <u>root</u>, the remaining commands through the final <u>exit</u> command
              at the end of this section are executed by the pseudo-user <u>secmail</u>):

                  su - secmail

                  gpg --gen-key

              At the <u>gpg</u> <u>--gen-key</u> command the <u>gpg</u> program asks for some details. Accept the defaults unless you
              have  reason  not to, but make sure you do not require a pass-phrase: press <u>Enter</u> twice when asked
              for one.

       <b>Some</b> <b>additional</b> <b>suggestions:</b>

       o      Details for defining a PGP key without password:

              define default  RSA key, size 2048, never to expire
              real name: secmail gpg-remailer functional account
              email address: <a href="mailto:secmail@mailhost.org">secmail@mailhost.org</a>
              No passphrase required: press Enter twice.

       o      Specify the key-id of the just created gpg-key as the default key in  the  file  <u><a href="file:~/.gnupg/gpg.conf">~/.gnupg/gpg.conf</a></u>
              (or <u><a href="file:~/.gnupg/options">~/.gnupg/options</a></u>, whichever is used). E.g.,

              default-key 1234ABCD

       o      Also add a line containing

              force-mdc

              to <u><a href="file:~/.gnupg/gpg.conf">~/.gnupg/gpg.conf</a></u>.  This prevents the warning

              WARNING: message was not integrity protected

       o      If  you  want  to allow non-group members to send e-mail to the gpg-remailer consider adding a key
              server specification to <u><a href="file:~/.gnupg/gpg.conf">~/.gnupg/gpg.conf</a></u> as well, to allow the  automatic  retrieval  of  missing
              public keys. E.g., add a line like

              keyserver keys.gnupg.net

              to <u><a href="file:~/.gnupg/gpg.conf">~/.gnupg/gpg.conf</a></u>.

       o      Next  use  <u>gpg</u>  <u>--search-keys</u>,  <u>gpg</u>  <u>--recv-keys</u>  or <u>gpg</u> <u>--import</u> (see the <b><a href="../man1/gpg.1.html">gpg</a></b>(1) man-page for the
              required formats of these commands) to already add the public keys of all the members of the group
              who will be using gpg-remailer to the pseudo user’s public key ring.

       o      If a group member exists who has signed the GPG/PGP keys of all other members,  then  consider  to
              trust this member fully, to prevent warnings resulting from using untrusted keys.

       o      Once  the  gpg-remailer’s  GPG key pair has been created, provide the remailer’s public key to the
              members of the group. These members should import the public key and they  should  be  advised  to
              sign  the  remailer’s  public  key  to  prevent warnings about using an unverified public key. The
              remailer’s public key can be be exported to file using

                  gpg --armor --export secmail &gt; secmail.pub

              and the members of the group can import the remailer’s public key using:

                  gpg --import secmail.pub

       o      When a new member is added to the group he/she should add the remailer’s  public  key  to  his/her
              public key ring and provide his/her public key for import into the functional account’s public key
              ring.

       o      Gpg-remailer  requires  the  existence  of  a  configuration  file and of a directory to store its
              temporary files in. See the section <b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>FILE</b> below.

       o      Having prepared the pseudo user’s PGP key rings, the command <u>exit</u>  takes  you  back  to  the  <u>root</u>
              user’s session.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       If available, single letter options are listed between parentheses following their associated long-option
       variants.  Single  letter options require arguments if their associated long options require arguments as
       well.

       o      <b>--debug</b> (<b>-d</b>)
              When specified, debug messages are logged to the  log-file  (see  below).   When  this  option  is
              specified  the  files  written by gpg-remailer are not removed after gpg-remailer has processed an
              incoming e-mail.

       o      <b>--help</b> (<b>-h</b>)
              A short summary of the usage  is  displayed  to  the  standard  output  after  which  gpg-remailer
              terminates.

       o      <b>--logfile</b>=<u>filename</u> (<b>-l</b>)
              Specifies   the   file   on   which   gpg-remailer’s   log   messages   are  written  (by  default
              <u><a href="file:~/etc/gpg-remailer.log">~/etc/gpg-remailer.log</a></u>).

       o      <b>--loglevel</b>=<u>level</u> (<b>-L</b>)
              LogLevel 0 provides extensive debug output as well as all other logmessages;
              LogLevel 1 logs the executed commands and the default messages;
              LogLevel 2 logs the default messages (characteristics of incoming and outgoing e-mail) (default);
              Higher levels will suppress logging.

       o      <b>--member</b>=<u>PGP</u> <u>e-mail</u> <u>address</u> (<b>-m</b>)
              The PGP-key e-mail address to re-encrypt the message for. Overrides the member(s)  listed  in  the
              configuration  file.  This  option  may  be specified multiple times when multiple members must be
              specified on the command line. With each <u>--member</u> option only provide one  e-mail  address  (e.g.,
              <u><a href="mailto:member@domain.iso">member@domain.iso</a></u>.  This format is not checked by <b>gpg-remailer</b>, but a failure to comply may result
              in <b>gpg-remailer</b> being unable to re-encrypt or e-mail messages.  The  <u>--member</u>  specifications  can
              also  be  used  to  specify  a  set  of  e-mail envelope addresses from where clear-text e-mail is
              accepted, using the <u>envelope:</u> <u>members</u> and <u>clear-text:</u> <u>envelope</u> configuration file specifications.

       o      <b>--noMail</b>
              When specified no mail is sent.

       o      <b>--nr</b>=<u>file-number</u> (<b>-n</b>)
              Files created by the gpg-remailer while processing incoming e-mails are kept, and  receive  suffix
              <u>file-number</u>, which should be a number.

       o      <b>--recipient</b>=<u>e-mail</u> <u>address</u> (<b>-r</b>)
              The recipient address(es) of the (re-encrypted or plain) resent e-mail. Overrides the recipient(s)
              listed  in  the  configuration  file.  As  with  the  <u>--members</u> option, multiple recipients may be
              specified by providing multiple <u>--recipient</u> options. These addresses may or may not be unique.  If
              multiple identical addresses are specified gpg-remailer will send e-mail to each of these multiply
              specified addresses.

              Each   <u>--recipient</u>   option   should   normally  only  define  one  plain  e-mail  address  (e.g.,
              <u><a href="mailto:recipient@domain.iso">recipient@domain.iso</a></u>, but multiple <u>--recipient</u> options are also accepted. The format of the e-mail
              addresses is not checked by  <b>gpg-remailer</b>,  but  providing  any  information  in  addition  to  or
              differing  from  a  plain  e-mail address may result in <b>gpg-remailer</b> being unable to re-encrypt or
              resend e-mail messages.

              In addition to plain e-mail addresses, the  specification  <u>--recipient</u>  <u>members</u>  can  be  used  to
              indicate  that  the  re-encrypted mail must be sent to all e-mail addresses specified using <u>member</u>
              specifications.

       o      <b>--step</b>=<u>name</u>
              Perform the indicated step of the remailing process. Step names are:

              <u>hdrs</u> (write the mail headers),
              <u>org</u> (write the mail data),
              <u>dec</u> (only for PGP encrypted e-mail: write the decrypted info),
              <u>doc</u> (only for PGP encrypted e-mail: create the info to send),
              <u>enc</u> (only for PGP encrypted e-mail: encrypt the info to send),
              <u>clearmail</u> (send clear-text mail),
              <u>clearmail:address</u>  (send  mail  only  to  the  provided  address,  ignore  recipient(s)  specified
              otherwise).  <u>pgpmail</u> (send pgp-encrypted mail),
              <u>pgpmail:address</u>  (send  pgp-encrypted  mail  only  to  the  provided  address, ignore recipient(s)
              specified otherwise).

              Step <u>hdrs</u> is completely optional. Later steps depend on earlier steps. E.g., <u>--step</u> <u>doc</u>  can  only
              be requested after having specified <u>--step</u> <u>dec</u> in a previous run.

              With clear-text e-mail steps <u>dec,</u> <u>doc,</u> <u>enc</u> and <u>pgpmail</u> should not be provided.

              With PGP encrypted mail step <u>clearmail</u> should not be provided.

       o      <b>--tmp</b>=<u>path</u> (<b>-t</b>)
              The  path  of  the  directory  where the temporary files are written (by default: <u>$HOME/tmp</u>). This
              should be an absolute path.

       o      <b>--umask</b>=<u>octalValue</u>
              By default, gpg-remailer uses umask 077 for all files it creates: only the  pseudo-user  has  read
              and  write  permissions. In normal circumstances there should be no reason for changing this umask
              value, but if necessary the <u>--umask</u> option can be used, providing an octal value,  to  specify  an
              alternative umask value.

       o      <b>--version</b> (<b>-v</b>)
              Gpg-remailer’s version number is is written to the standard output stream after which gpg-remailer
              terminates.

       o      <b>--x-headers</b> (<b>-x</b>)
              Add `X-GPG-remailer-from’ and `X-GPG-remailer-From’ headers containing, respectively, the original
              sender’s  From  and  From:  headers, as well as (in `X-GPG-remailer-envelope’ headers) all headers
              containing `envelope’ to the distributed e-mail.  )

</pre><h4><b>CONFGURATION</b> <b>FILE</b></h4><pre>
              The default configuration file is <u><a href="file:~/etc/gpg-remailer.rc">~/etc/gpg-remailer.rc</a></u> under the pseudo  user’s  home  directory.
              Its path may be altered using a program option.

              Empty  lines  are ignored. Information at and beyond <u>#</u>-characters is interpreted as comment and is
              ignored as well.

              All directives in the configuration file obey the pattern

                  directive: value

              A line may at most contain one directive, but white space (including comment at  the  end  of  the
              line) is OK. Several directives may be specified multiple times; otherwise the first occurrence of
              a  directive is used. All directives are interpreted <u>case</u> <u>insensitively</u>, but their values are used
              as specified. E.g., <u>DeBUG:</u> <u>true</u> is as good as <u>debug:</u> <u>true</u>, but  <u>debug:</u>  <u>TRUE</u>  is  not  recognized.
              Non-empty lines not starting with a recognized directive are silently ignored.

              The following directives are supported (default values are shown between parentheses; when none is
              specified  there  is no default). When equivalent command line options are used then they overrule
              the configuration file specifications.

       o      <b>debug:</b> <u>logic</u> (false)
              When <u>logic</u> is specified as <u>true</u> debug messages will be logged to the log-file (see below). Command
              line options: <u>--debug,</u> <u>-d</u>. When this option is specified the files written  by  gpg-remailer  will
              not be removed when gpg-remailer terminates.

       o      <b>clear-text:</b> <u>specification</u> (rejected)
              By  default,  the gpg-remailer does not accept clear-text e-mail. This can explicitly be indicated
              in the configuration file using the

              <u>clear-text:</u> <u>rejected</u>

              specification. If clear-text e-mail should be allowed specify

              <u>clear-text:</u> <u>accepted</u>

              It is also possible to specify the envelope addresses that are accepted  for  received  clear-text
              e-mail. If this is required, specify

              <u>clear-text:</u> <u>envelope</u>

              and define the accepted envelope e-mail addresses using the <u>envelope:</u> configuration option.

       o      <b>envelope:</b> <u>e-mail</u> <u>address</u>
              The  <u>envelope</u>  specifications  are  only interpreted when <u>clear-text:</u> <u>envelope</u> has been specified.
              When <u>clear-text:</u> <u>envelope</u> was specified  only  clear-text  e-mail  using  one  of  the  configured
              <u>envelope</u>  addresses  will  be  re-mailed  to  the  configured  recipients.  The  special  envelope
              specification

              <u>envelope:</u> <u>members</u>

              may be used to indicate that envelope addresses which are equal to the addresses  specified  using
              <u>member</u> specifications are all accepted.

              All   envelope   addresses   are  interpreted  case-insensitively.  By  default  (if  no  <u>envelope</u>
              specification has  been  provided)  all  envelope  addresses  are  accepted,  in  which  case  the
              specification <u>clear-text:</u> <u>envelope</u> reduces to <u>clear-text:</u> <u>accepted</u>.

       o      <b>keepFiles:</b> <u>nr</u>
              When  a number is specified all files written by gpg-remailer use the specified number and are not
              removed when gpg-remailer terminates. When this option is not specified the files receive a random
              numeric extension resulting in the creation of new, as yet non-existing <u>*.&lt;nr&gt;</u> files.

       o      <b>logfile:</b> <u>filename</u> (etc/gpg-remailer.log)
              The file on which gpg-remailer’s log messages are written.

       o      <b>loglevel:</b> <u>value</u> (2)
              LogLevel 0 provides extensive debug output as well as all other logmessages;
              LogLevel 1 logs the executed commands and the default messages;
              LogLevel 2 logs the default messages (characteristics of incoming and outgoing e-mail);
              With higher levels  logging is suppressed.

       o      <b>member:</b> <u>address</u>
              Multiple members may be specified. Each <u>member</u> specification specifies a PGP-key e-mail address to
              re-encrypt  the  message  for.  The  addresses   should   be   plain   e-mail   addresses   (e.g.,
              <u><a href="mailto:member@domain.iso">member@domain.iso</a></u>),  and  should not contain other elements (like the name of the person using the
              address). This format is not checked by <b>gpg-remailer</b>, but  a  failure  to  comply  may  result  in
              <b>gpg-remailer</b>  being unable to re-encrypt or e-mail messages. The <u>member</u> specifications can also be
              used to specify a set of e-mail envelope addresses from where clear-text e-mail is accepted, using
              the <u>envelope:</u> <u>members</u> and <u>clear-text:</u> <u>envelope</u> specifications.

       o      <b>noMail:</b> <u>logic</u> (false)
              When specified as <u>true</u> no mail is sent.

       o      <b>recipient:</b> <u>e-mail</u> <u>address</u>
              The recipient address(es) of the (re-encrypted or plain) resent e-mail. Multiple recipients may be
              specified. These addresses may or may not be unique. If multiple identical addresses are specified
              gpg-remailer will send e-mail to each of these multiply specified addresses. Recipients should  be
              specified using plain e-mail addresses (e.g., <u><a href="mailto:destination@some.host.org">destination@some.host.org</a></u>). The re-encrypted mail is
              sent to each recipient in turn. The specification

              <u>recipient:</u> <u>members</u>

              can  be used to indicate that the re-encrypted mail must be sent to all e-mail addresses specified
              using <u>member</u> specifications.

       o      <b>replyTo:</b> <u>full</u> <u>address</u>
              The reply to address may be any e-mail reply-to address. The reply-to becomes  the  default  reply
              address  for  the  recipient receiving gpg-remailer’s e-mail message. Quotes and double quotes are
              removed from the reply to address. A reply-to specification could be, e.g.,

                  SECMAIL signed AND encrypted &lt;<a href="mailto:secmail@mailhost.org">secmail@mailhost.org</a>&gt;

              This specification should be according to the requirements defined in RFC 822: <u>Standard</u>  <u>for</u>  <u>ARPA</u>
              <u>Internet</u>  <u>Text</u>  <u>Messages</u>.  Failing to comply with RFC 822 may result in the e-mail sending program
              rejecting the e-mail that is submitted by the gpg-remailer.

       o      <b>signature:</b> <u>requirement</u> (required)
              This option is used to control signature checking. Recognized values are:
              <u>none</u> (or not specified): no signature checking is performed;
              <u>required</u>: a PGP signature must have been provided;
              <u>good</u>: the PGP signature must be recognized as a a `good signature’.

       o      <b>tmp</b> <u>directory</u> (tmp/)
              The directory into which gpg-remailer writes its temporary files.  )

</pre><h4><b>FORMATS</b></h4><pre>
              Although using PGP/GPG in e-mail is established technology, various  formats  of  the  e-mail  are
              possible. Currently gpg-remailer recognizes the following formats:

       o      Simple encrypted messages, consisting of an encrypted e-mail body;

       o      Multi-part encrypted messages;

       o      Encrypted messages containing detached signatures.

              Below a description is given of the actual contents of PGP encrypted en decrypted files.

              All  PGP  encrypted  e-mail  shows  the  following  headers  (the boundary values will differ over
              different e-mail messages):

              Content-Type: multipart/encrypted; protocol="application/pgp-encrypted";
                      boundary="+QahgC5+KEYLbs62"
              Content-Disposition: inline

              All PGP encrypted e-mail shows the following organization (the lines  are  used  to  separate  the
              e-mail  organization  from the text of this man-page and are not actually present in the e-mail or
              in the decrypted information; empty lines, where shown, are required):

              ----------------------------------------------------------------------
                  mail headers

              --+QahgC5+KEYLbs62
              Content-Type: application/pgp-encrypted
              Content-Disposition: attachment

              Version: 1

              --+QahgC5+KEYLbs62
              Content-Type: application/octet-stream
              Content-Disposition: inline; filename="msg.asc"

              -----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE-----
              ...

              -----END PGP MESSAGE-----
              --+QahgC5+KEYLbs62--
              ----------------------------------------------------------------------

              Note that boundaries consist of

       o      a new line character

       o      two dashes followed by the boundary text

       o      the last boundary is followed by two dashes

       o      a new line character

              The various  PGP  encrypted  e-mail  formats  differ  in  the  way  they  organize  the  decrypted
              information.

              <b>Simple</b> <b>Encrypted</b> <b>Messages.</b>

              During  decryption the signature is verified, and the result of the verification is written to the
              standard error stream. The decrypted  message  itself  contains  but  one  message,  organized  as
              follows:

              ----------------------------------------------------------------------
              Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
              Content-Disposition: inline
              Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable

              decrypted text of the message
              ----------------------------------------------------------------------

              <b>Multi-part</b> <b>Encrypted</b> <b>Messages.</b>

              During  decryption the signature is verified, and the result of the verification is written to the
              standard error stream. The decrypted message  itself  contains  multiple  messages,  organized  as
              follows:

              ----------------------------------------------------------------------
              Content-Type: multipart/mixed; boundary="f+W+jCU1fRNres8c"
              Content-Disposition: inline

              --f+W+jCU1fRNres8c
              Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
              Content-Disposition: inline
              Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable

              Text of the first attachment

              --f+W+jCU1fRNres8c
              Content-Type: application/pdf
              Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="attachment.pdf"
              Content-Transfer-Encoding: base64

              text of the attachment.pdf in base64 encoding

              --f+W+jCU1fRNres8c--
              ----------------------------------------------------------------------

              Multiple attachments might follow in the same way.

              <b>Encrypted</b> <b>Messages</b> <b>Containing</b> <b>Detached</b> <b>Signatures.</b>

              During  decryption  the  signature  is  <u>not</u> verified (but the recipient(s) is (are) shown) and the
              decrypted file is organized as follows:

              ----------------------------------------------------------------------
              Content-Type: multipart/signed; micalg=pgp-sha1; protocol="application/pgp-signature";
                      boundary="=-TNwuMvq+TfajHhvqBuO7"

              --=-TNwuMvq+TfajHhvqBuO7
              Content-Type: text/plain
              Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable

              Text of the message

              --=-TNwuMvq+TfajHhvqBuO7
              Content-Type: application/pgp-signature; name=signature.asc
              Content-Description: This is a digitally signed message part

              -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----
              ... signature text

              -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----
              --=-TNwuMvq+TfajHhvqBuO7--
              ----------------------------------------------------------------------

              The last part represents the detached signature, The contents section must be separated  from  the
              decrypted  file  (named,  e.g., <u>decrypted</u>) (creating, e.g., the file <u>contents</u>). That latter file’s
              signature may then be verified using the command

                  gpg --verify decrypted contents

              resulting in the signature verification written to the standard error  (as  usual).  The  contents
              start  immediately  following  the first boundary, and continues up to, but not including, the new
              line just before the next boundary.
