</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>tcp6</b> tool allows the assessment of IPv6 implementations with respect to a variety of attack vectors based
       on  TCP/IPv6  segments.  This tool is part of the SI6 Networks' IPv6 Toolkit: a security assessment suite
       for the IPv6 protocols.

       <b>tcp6</b> can  be  employed  to  perform  specific  TCP  connection-establishment  and  connection-termination
       sequences.  For  example,  it  can  be  employed  to simulate a TCP "simultaneous open" scenario (see the
       "--open-mode" option) or to simulate a TCP "simultaneous close" scenario (see the "--close-mode" option).
       It can be employed to perform a number of resource-exhaustion attacks against TCP, such  as  SYN-flooding
       attacks,  connection-flooding  attacks  (see  the  "--flood-sources"  and  "--flood-ports" options), etc.
       Additionally, it can be employed to exploit attack vectors based on the TCP window  (see  the  "--window"
       option).

       <b>tcp6</b>  tool  has two modes of operation: active and listening. In active mode, the tool attacks a specific
       target, while in listening mode the tool listens to TCP traffic on the local  network,  and  launches  an
       attack  in response to such traffic. Active mode is employed if an IPv6 Destination Address is specified.
       Listening mode is employed if the "-L" option (or its long counterpart "--listen") is  set.  If  both  an
       attack target and the "-L" option are specified, the attack is launched against the specified target, and
       then the tool enters listening mode to respond incoming packets with TCP segments.

       <b>tcp6</b>  supports  filtering  of  incoming  packets  based  on  the  Ethernet  Source  Address, the Ethernet
       Destination Address, the IPv6 Source Address, and the IPv6 Destination Address.  There are two  types  of
       filters:  "block  filters"  and  "accept  filters".  If any "block filter" is specified, and the incoming
       packet matches any of those filters, the message is discarded (and thus  no  TCP  segments  are  sent  in
       response).  If  any  "accept  filter"  is specified, incoming packets must match the specified filters in
       order for the tool to respond with TCP segments.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>tcp6</b> takes itS parameters as command-line options. Each of the options can be specified with a short name
       (one character preceded with the hyphen character, as e.g. "-i") or with a long name (a  string  preceded
       with two hyphen characters, as e.g. "--interface").

       If  the  tool  is  instructed  to  e.g.  flood  the  victim  with  TCP  segments  from  different sources
       ("--flood-sources" option), multiple packets may need to be generated.

       tcp6 supports IPv6 Extension Headers, including the IPv6 Fragmentation Header, which might be of  use  to
       circumvent  layer-2  filtering and/or Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS). However, IPv6 extension
       headers are not employed by default, and must be explicitly enabled with the corresponding options.

       <b>-i</b> <u>INTERFACE</u><b>,</b> <b>--interface</b> <u>INTERFACE</u>
              This option specifies the network interface that the tool will use. The network interface must  be
              specified (i.e., the tool does not select any network interface "by default").

       <b>-S</b> <u>SRC_LINK_ADDR</u><b>,</b> <b>--src-link-address</b> <u>SRC_LINK_ADDR</u>

              This option specifies the link-layer Source Address of the probe packets. If left unspecified, the
              link-layer  Source  Address  of  the  packets is set to the real link-layer address of the network
              interface. Note: this option is meaningful only  when  the  underlying  link-layer  technology  is
              Ethernet.

       <b>-D</b> <u>DST_LINK_ADDR</u><b>,</b> <b>--dst-link-address</b> <u>DST_LINK_ADDR</u>

              This  option  specifies  the  link-layer Destination Address of the probe packets. By default, the
              link-layer Destination Address is automatically set to the link-layer address of  the  destination
              host  (for  on-link destinations) or to the link-layer address of the first-hop router. Note: this
              option is meaningful only when the underlying link-layer technology is Ethernet.

       <b>-s</b> <u>SRC_ADDR</u><b>,</b> <b>--src-address</b> <u>SRC_ADDR</u>

              This option specifies the IPv6 source address (or IPv6 prefix) to be used for the  Source  Address
              of  the  attack packets. If the "-F" ("--flood-sources") option is specified, this option includes
              an IPv6 prefix, from which random addresses are selected. See the description of the  "-F"  option
              for further information on how the "-s" option is processed in that specific case.

              Note:  When  operating  in  "listening"  mode,  the  Source  Address  is  automatically set to the
              Destination Address of the incoming packet.

       <b>-d</b> <u>DST_ADDR</u><b>,</b> <b>--dst-address</b> <u>DST_ADDR</u>

              This option specifies the IPv6 Destination Address of the victim. It can be left unspecified  only
              if the "-L" option is selected (i.e., if the tool is to operate in "listening" mode).

              Note:  When  operating  in  "listening"  mode, the Destination Address is automatically set to the
              Source Address of the incoming packet.

       <b>-A</b> <u>HOP_LIMIT</u><b>,</b> <b>--hop-limit</b> <u>HOP_LIMIT</u>

              This option specifies the Hop Limit to be used for the IPv6 packets. It defaults to 255.

       <b>-u</b> <u>HDR_SIZE</u><b>,</b> <b>--dst-opt-hdr</b> <u>HDR_SIZE</u>

              This option specifies that a Destination  Options  header  is  to  be  included  in  the  outgoing
              packet(s).  The  extension header size must be specified as an argument to this option (the header
              is filled with padding options). Multiple Destination Options headers may be specified by means of
              multiple "-u" options.

       <b>-U</b> <u>HDR_SIZE</u><b>,</b> <b>--dst-opt-u-hdr</b> <u>HDR_SIZE</u>

              This option specifies a Destination Options header to be included in the "unfragmentable part"  of
              the  outgoing  packet(s).  The  header  size  must be specified as an argument to this option (the
              header is filled with padding options). Multiple Destination Options headers may be  specified  by
              means of multiple "-U" options.

       <b>-H</b> <u>HDR_SIZE</u><b>,</b> <b>--hbh-opt-hdr</b> <u>HDR_SIZE</u>

              This  option  specifies  that  a  Hop-by-Hop  Options  header  is  to  be included in the outgoing
              packet(s). The header size must be specified as an argument to this option (the header  is  filled
              with  padding  options). Multiple Hop-by-Hop Options headers may be specified by means of multiple
              "-H" options.

       <b>-y</b> <u>FRAG_SIZE</u><b>,</b> <b>--frag-hdr</b> <u>FRAG_SIZE</u>

              This option specifies that the resulting packet must be fragmented.  The  fragment  size  must  be
              specified as an argument to this option.

       <b>-P</b> <u>PAYLOAD_SIZE</u><b>,</b> <b>--payload-size</b> <u>PAYLOAD_SIZE</u>

              This options specifies the size of the TCP payload. It defaults to 0 (i.e., empty TCP segments).

       <b>-o</b> <u>SRC_PORT</u><b>,</b> <b>--src-port</b> <u>SRC_PORT</u>

              This option specifies the TCP Source Port.

       <b>-a</b> <u>DST_PORT</u><b>,</b> <b>--dst-port</b> <u>DST_PORT</u>

              This option specifies the TCP/UDP Destination Port.

       <b>-X</b> <u>TCP_FLAGS</u><b>,</b> <b>--tcp-flags</b> <u>TCP_FLAGS</u>

              his option is used to set specific the TCP flags. The flags are specified as "F" (FIN), "S" (SYN),
              "R" (RST), "P" (PSH), "A" (ACK), "U" (URG), "X" (no flags).

              If this option is not set, and the tool operates in listening mode, the flags of the generated TCP
              segments are automatically set as follows: TCP segments elicited by SYNs have both the SYN and ACK
              flags set. All other TCP segments have the ACK bit set.

       <b>-q</b> <u>SEQ_NUMBER</u><b>,</b> <b>--tcp-seq</b> <u>SEQ_NUMBER</u>

              This  option  specifies  the  Sequence Number of the TCP header. If left unspecified, the Sequence
              Number is randomized.

              If this option is left unspecified and the tool is operating in listening mode, the  TCP  Sequence
              Number is set to the Acknowledgement Number of the packet that elicited the TCP segment.

       <b>-Q</b> <u>ACK_NUMBER</u><b>,</b> <b>--tcp-ack</b> <u>ACK_NUMBER</u>

              This  option  specifies  the  Acknowledgment  Number  of the TCP segment. If left unspecified, the
              Acknowledgment Number is randomized.

              If this option is left unspecified and the tool is operating in listening mode, the  TCP  Sequence
              Number is set to the Acknowledgement Number of the packet that elicited the TCP segment.

       <b>-V</b> <u>URG_POINTER</u><b>,</b> <b>--tcp-urg</b> <u>URG_POINTER</u>

              This  option  specifies  the  Urgent  Pointer  of the TCP segment. If left unspecified, the Urgent
              Pointer is set to 0.

       <b>-w</b> <u>TCP_WINDOW</u><b>,</b> <b>--tcp-win</b> <u>TCP_WINDOW</u>

              This option specifies the value of the TCP Window. If left unspecified, the Window is randomized.

       <b>-W</b> <u>WIN_MODE</u><b>,</b> <b>--window-mode</b> <u>WIN_MODE</u>

              This option specifies how to operate the TCP window by means of the WIN_MODE parameter. Two  modes
              are supported:

                 + closed
                 + modulated

              When  the  "closed"  mode is selected, the TCP window will be set to 0 (i.e., "closed window"). If
              the tool estabishes new TCP connections, the initial window advertised during  the  TCP  three-way
              handshake  will  be  that  specified  with  the '-w' option. However, once the connection has been
              established, the TCP window will be set to 0. This allows for the implementation of the  so-called
              Netkill  attack,  discussed  in  Section  7.1.1  of  the  document  "Security  Assessment  of  the
              Transmission          Control          Protocol          (TCP)"           (available           at:
              &lt;<a href="http://www.gont.com.ar/papers/tn-03-09-security-assessment-TCP.pdf">http://www.gont.com.ar/papers/tn-03-09-security-assessment-TCP.pdf</a>&gt;).

              When the "modulated" mode is selected, the TCP window will oscillate between alternate between two
              different  values.  These  values,  along the amount of time that each of them is "active", can be
              specified by means of the '-M' ("--win-modulate") option. The first of the  aforementioned  values
              is  meant to close the window (hence it will typically be zero), while the second is meant to open
              the window. The goal of alternating between these two values is to circumvent a trivial mitigation
              against Zero-Window attacks implemented by some stacks where they enforce a limit on  the  maximum
              amount  of time that the TCP advertised by a remote peer remains fully-closed (i.e., set to 0). By
              changing the advertised window to some other (small) value every now  and  then,  such  a  trivial
              "counter-measure" can be easily circumvented.

       <b>-M</b> <u>WIN_MOD_MODE</u><b>,</b> <b>--win-modulation</b> <u>WIN_MOD_MODE</u>

              This  option  specifies  the  two values (and their respective duration) over which the TCP window
              will alternate. The value WIN_MOD_MODE hast the syntax "WIN1:TIME1:WIN2:TIME2", where the WIN1 and
              WIN2 parameters specify the window size for each of these  periods,  while  the  TIME1  and  TIME2
              parameters   specify  their  respective  time  lengths.  For  example,  setting  "--win-modulation
              0:60:10:30" will cause <b>tcp6</b> to alternate between advertising a  TCP  window  of  0  bytes  for  60
              seconds, and advertising a TCP window of 10 bytes for 30 seconds.

              This  option  will be typically employed along with one of the flooding options ("--flood-sources"
              an/or  "--flood-ports")  and  the  "--data"  option,  such  that  multiple  TCP  connections   are
              established,  and the target TCPs keep their retransmission buffer full. In this scenario, the TCP
              window "modulation" option can be leveraged to evade trivial counter-measures implemented by  some
              TCP  stacks that try to mitigate Zero-Window attacks by enforcing a limit on the maximum amount of
              time the TCP window can be in the "closed state".

       <b>-c</b> <u>OPEN_MODE</u><b>,</b> <b>--open-mode</b> <u>OPEN_MODE</u>

              This option specifies the connection-establishment mode. The following modes are available:

                 + simultaneous
                 + passive
                 + abort

              When the "simultaneous" mode is selected, <b>tcp6</b> will respond to incoming SYN  segments  with  other
              SYN segments, thus simulating a "simultaneous open" scenario. When the "passive" mode is selected,
              <b>tcp6</b>  will respond to incoming SYN segments with the typical SYN/ACK segments, thus leading to the
              traditional "three-way handshake". Finally, when the "abort" mode si selected, <b>tcp6</b> wil respond to
              incoming SYN segments with RST segments, thus aborting the incoming connections.

              For the most part, this option is useful for assessing the correct behavior of TCP implementations
              (e.g., support for "simultaneous opens").

       <b>-C</b> <u>CLOSE_MODE</u><b>,</b> <b>--close-mode</b> <u>CLOSE_MODE</u>

              This option specifies the the connection-termination mode. The following modes are available:

                 + simultaneous
                 + passive
                 + abort
                 + active
                 + FIN-WAIT-1
                 + FIN-WAIT-2
                 + LAST-ACK

              When the "simultaneous" mode is selected, <b>tcp6</b> will respond to  incoming  FIN  segments  with  FIN
              segments,  thus  simulating  a "simultaneous close" scenario. When the "passive" mode is selected,
              <b>tcp6</b> will respond to incoming FIN segments with the typical FIN/ACK segments, thus leading to  the
              traditional  TCP  connection-termination  sequence.  When  the  "abort" mode is selected, <b>tcp6</b> wil
              respond to incoming FIN segments with RST segments, thus aborting the  corresponding  connections.
              When the "active" mode is selected, <b>tcp6</b> will start the connection-termination sequence by sending
              a FIN segment.

              The  FIN-WAIT-1,  FIN-WAIT-2,  and  LAST-ACK  modes  will result in connections in the FIN-WAIT-1,
              FIN-WAIT-2, and LAST-ACK, respectively. It should be noted that in order for the  remote  TCPs  to
              transition  to  the  FIN-WAIT-1  or  FIN-WAIT-2  states,  the remote TCPs must perform the "active
              close". This can be trivially triggered for application protocols such as HTTP, but might  not  be
              feasible for other protocols.

       <b>-Z</b> <u>DATA</u><b>,</b> <b>--data</b> <u>DATA</u>

              This  option is used to specify a payload that should be sent as the first data segment once a TCP
              connection has been established. It will typically include an application-layer request. Note: the
              string used for the DATA parameter can contain the "\r" and "\n"  C-style  escape  senquenced  for
              representing "carriage return" and "line feed" (respectively).

              As  an  example,  this  option  could be employed to send an HTTP request if set as '--data "GET /
              HTTP/1.0\r\n\r\n"'.

       <b>-N</b>, <b>--not-ack-data</b>

              This option instructs <b>tcp6</b> not to acknowledge the TCP payload of incoming segments (when operating
              in listening mode).

              Note: By default, tcp6 will acknowledge both the  payload  and  the  flags  of  the  incoming  TCP
              segments.

       <b>-n</b>, <b>--not-ack-flags</b>

              This  option instructs tcp6 not to acknowledge the TCP flags (SYN and/or FIN) of incoming segments
              (when operating in listening mode).

              Note: By default, tcp6 will acknowledge both the  payload  and  the  flags  of  the  incoming  TCP
              segments.

       <b>-j</b> <u>SRC_ADDR</u><b>,</b> <b>--block-src</b> <u>SRC_ADDR</u>

              This  option  sets a block filter for the incoming packets, based on their IPv6 Source Address. It
              allows the specification of an IPv6 prefix in the form "-j prefix/prefixlen". If the prefix length
              is not specified, a prefix length of "/128" is selected (i.e., the option assumes  that  a  single
              IPv6 address, rather than an IPv6 prefix, has been specified).

       <b>-k</b> <u>DST_ADDR</u><b>,</b> <b>--block-dst</b> <u>DST_ADDR</u>

              This option sets a block filter for the incoming packets, based on their IPv6 Destination Address.
              It  allows  the  specification  of an IPv6 prefix in the form "-k prefix/prefixlen". If the prefix
              length is not specified, a prefix length of "/128" is selected (i.e., the option  assumes  that  a
              single IPv6 address, rather than an IPv6 prefix, has been specified).

       <b>-J</b> <u>LINK_ADDR</u><b>,</b> <b>--block-link-src</b> <u>LINK_ADDR</u>

              This  option  sets  a  block  filter  for  the  incoming packets, based on their link-layer Source
              Address. The option must be  followed  by  a  link-layer  address  (currently,  only  Ethernet  is
              supported).

       <b>-K</b> <u>LINK_ADDR</u><b>,</b> <b>--block-link-dst</b> <u>LINK_ADDR</u>

              This  option  sets  a block filter for the incoming packets, based on their link-layer Destination
              Address. The option must be  followed  by  a  link-layer  address  (currently,  only  Ethernet  is
              supported).

       <b>-b</b> <u>SRC_ADDR</u><b>,</b> <b>--accept-src</b> <u>SRC_ADDR</u>

              This option sets an accept filter for the incoming packets, based on their IPv6 Source Address. It
              allows the specification of an IPv6 prefix in the form "-b prefix/prefixlen". If the prefix length
              is  not  specified,  a prefix length of "/128" is selected (i.e., the option assumes that a single
              IPv6 address, rather than an IPv6 prefix, has been specified).

       <b>-g</b> <u>DST_ADDR</u><b>,</b> <b>--accept-dst</b> <u>DST_ADDR</u>

              This option sets a accept filter for  the  incoming  packets,  based  on  their  IPv6  Destination
              Address.  It  allows the specification of an IPv6 prefix in the form "-g prefix/prefixlen". If the
              prefix length is not specified, a prefix length of "/128" is selected (i.e.,  the  option  assumes
              that a single IPv6 address, rather than an IPv6 prefix, has been specified).

       <b>-B</b> <u>LINK_ADDR</u><b>,</b> <b>--accept-link-src</b> <u>LINK_ADDR</u>

              This  option  sets  an  accept  filter  for the incoming packets, based on their link-layer Source
              Address. The option must be  followed  by  a  link-layer  address  (currently,  only  Ethernet  is
              supported).

       <b>-G</b> <u>LINK_ADDR</u><b>,</b> <b>--accept-link-dst</b> <u>LINK_ADDR</u>

              This  option sets an accept filter for the incoming packets, based on their link-layer Destination
              Address. The option must be  followed  by  a  link-layer  address  (currently,  only  Ethernet  is
              supported).

       <b>-F</b> <u>N_SOURCES</u><b>,</b> <b>--flood-sources</b> <u>N_SOURCES</u>

              This  option instructs the tool to send multiple TCP segments with different Source Addresses. The
              number of different source addresses is specified as "-F number". The Source Address of  each  TCP
              segment  is  randomly selected from the prefix specified by the "-s" option. If the "-F" option is
              specified but the "-s" option is left unspecified, the Source Address of the packets  is  randomly
              selected from the prefix ::/0.

       <b>-T</b> <u>N_PORTS</u><b>,</b> <b>--flood-ports</b> <u>N_PORTS</u>

              This  option  instructs  the  tool  to send multiple TCP segments with different Source Ports. The
              Source Port of each TCP segment is randomly selected from the whole port number space (0-65535).

       <b>-l</b>, <b>--loop</b>

              This option instructs the tcp6 tool to send periodic TCP segments to the victim node.  The  amount
              of  time  to  pause between sending TCP segments can be specified by means of the "-z" option, and
              defaults to 1 second.  Note  that  this  option  cannot  be  set  in  conjunction  with  the  "-L"
              ("--listen") option.

       <b>-z</b>, <b>--sleep</b>

              This  option specifies the amount of time to pause between sending TCP segments (when the "--loop"
              option is set). If left unspecified, it defaults to 1 second.

       <b>-r</b> <u>RATE</u><b>,</b> <b>--rate-limit</b> <u>RATE</u>

              This option specifies the rate limit to use when performing a remote address scan.  "RATE"  should
              be specified as "xbps" or "xpps" (with "x" being an unsigned integer), for rate-limits in bits per
              second or packets per second, respectively.

       <b>-L</b>, <b>--listen</b>

              This instructs the tcp6 tool to operate in listening mode (possibly after attacking a given node).
              Note that this option cannot be used in conjunction with the "-l" ("--loop") option.

       <b>-p</b> <u>PROBE_MODE</u><b>,</b> <b>--probe-mode</b> <u>PROBE_MODE</u>

              This  option  instructs  tcp6 to operate in probe mode. The specific probe mode is specified as an
              argument to this option (currently, only "script" mode is supported). In probe  mode,  <b>tcp6</b>  sends
              probe  segments,  and  waits  for  response packets. The response packets are decoded based on the
              selected probe mode.

              In the "script" probe mode, the tool decodes TCP segments as follows:

                   RESPONSE:RESPONSE_TYPE:RESPONSE_DECODE...

              Where the string RESPONSE is fixed, and RESPONSE_TYPE indicates the response received. As of  this
              version of the tool, the following RESPONSE_TYPE values are supported:

                 + TCP6: Indicates that the tool received a TCP/IPv6 packet
                 + TIMEOUT: Indicates that the tool received no response

              If RESPONSE_TYPE is TCP6, RESPONSE code contains the TCP flags set in the receive TCP segment. The
              TCP flags are encoded as "F" (FIN), "S" (SYN), "R" (RST), "P" (PSH), "A" (ACK), and "U" (URG).

              Possibe output lines of the tool are:

                  RESPONSE:TIMEOUT:
                  RESPONSE:TCP6:RA:

              Note:  Future  versions  of  the  tool  will  also  decode ICMPv6 error messages, and will include
              additional data regarding the incoming TCP segments (e.g., ACK value, payload size, etc.).

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b>

              This option instructs the tcp6 tool to be verbose.  When the option is  set  twice,  the  tool  is
              "very  verbose",  and  the  tool  also  informs which packets have been accepted or discarded as a
              result of applying the specified filters.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>

              Print help information for the <b>tcp6</b> tool.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       The following sections illustrate typical use cases of the <b>tcp6</b> tool.

       <b>Example</b> <b>#1</b>

       # tcp6 -s fc00:1::/64 -d fc00:1::1 -a 22 -X S -F 100 -l -z 1 -v

       In this example the <b>tcp6</b> tool is essentially employed to perform a SYN-flood attack against  port  number
       22  of  the host fc00:1::1. The tool uses the network interface "eth0" (as specified by the "-i" option),
       and sends SYN segments (as specified by the "-X" option) from the prefix fc00:1::/64 (as specified by the
       "-s" option) to port 22 (specified by the "-a" option) at the destination address fc00:1::1 (specified by
       the "-d" option). The tool sends TCP segments from 100 different addresses  (as  specified  by  the  "-F"
       option)  every  one  second  (as  specified  by  the "-l" and "-z" options). The tool will be verbose (as
       specified by the "-v" option).

       <b>Example</b> <b>#2</b>

       # tcp6 -i eth0 -L -X RA -v

       In this example, the <b>tcp6</b> tool is employed to perform a TCP connection-reset attack against  all   active
       TCP  connections  in  the  local  network. The tool listens ("-L") on the interface eth0 ("-i eth0"), and
       responds to any TCP segments with a RST packet (with both the RST and ACK bits set).  The  tool  will  be
       verbose.

       <b>Example</b> <b>#3</b>

       #  tcp6  -i  eth0  -d  fc00:1::1  -a  80 -L -s fc00:1::/112 -l -r 1pps -v --data "GET / HTTP/1.0\r\n\r\n"
       --close-mode last-ack --flood-ports 10

       Flood the target system (fc00:1::1) with connections that stay  in  the  LAST-ACK  state  (on  port  80),
       sending  packets at a rate of one packet per second. For each forged address, 10 different (forged) ports
       are used. For each connection, <b>tcp6</b> will send an HTTP application request.

       <b>Example</b> <b>#4</b>

       # tcp6 -i eth0 -d fc00:1::1 -a 80 -L -s fc00:1::/112 -l -r 1000pps --tcp-flags  auto  -v  --data  "GET  /
       HTTP/1.0\r\n\r\n" --flood-ports 10 --window-mode close

       Flood  the  target  node  (fc00:1::1)  with  TCP  connections  (on  port  80). On each connection that is
       established, an HTTP request is sent, and the TCP window is immediately  closed.  For  each  forged  IPv6
       source  address  ten different TCP source ports are randomized. The bandwidth of the attack is limited to
       1000 pps.

       <b>Example</b> <b>#5</b>

       # tcp6 -d fc00:1::1 -a 80 --tcp-flags A --dst-opt-hdr 8 --payload-size 50 --probe-mode script

       Send a probe TCP segment to TCP port 80 at fc00:1::1. The probe packet consists of an IPv6 packet with  a
       Destination  Options  header of 8 bytes, and an IPv6 payload consisting of a TCP segment with the ACK bit
       set, and 50 data bytes. The probe mode is "script".
