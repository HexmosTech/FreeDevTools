</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       A command-line frontend for Sequoia, an implementation of OpenPGP.

       Functionality  is  grouped  and available using subcommands.  This interface is not completely stateless.
       In  particular,  the  user's  default  certificate  store  is  used.   This   can   be   disabled   using
       `--cert-store=none`.  Similarly, a key store is used to manage and protect secret key material.  This can
       be disabled using `--key-store=none`.

       OpenPGP  data  can  be  provided  in  binary  or ASCII armored form.  This will be handled automatically.
       Emitted OpenPGP data is ASCII armored by default.

       We use the term "certificate", or "cert" for short, to refer to OpenPGP keys that do not contain secrets.
       Conversely, we use the term "key" to refer to OpenPGP keys that do contain secrets.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Global</b> <b>options</b>
       <b>--batch</b>
              Prevents any kind of prompting

              Enables batch mode.  In batch mode, sq will never ask  for  user  input,  such  as  prompting  for
              passwords.

       <b>--cert-store</b>=<u>PATH</u>
              Specify the location of the certificate store

              By  default,  `sq`  uses  the  OpenPGP  certificate  directory  in  Sequoia's  home directory (see
              `--home`), $HOME/.local/share/pgp.cert.d.  This can be  overridden  by  setting  the  `PGP_CERT_D`
              environment variable.

              Use 'default' to explicitly use the default cert store, use 'none' to not use a cert store.

       <b>--cli-version</b>=<u>CLI_VERSION</u>
              Select a CLI version

              `sq`'s  CLI  is versioned using a semantic versioning scheme.  Setting this options causes `sq` to
              error out if it does not implement an interface that is compatible  with  the  specified  version.
              For  instance,  if  you set this to 1.1.0 and `sq` only implements version 1.0.0 of the interface,
              then `sq` will error out.

              `sq` may implement multiple interfaces (e.g., 1.1.4, and  2.0.5).   By  default,  it  selects  the
              newest  version.   As such, if you require a particular interface, you need to set this option for
              every call to `sq`.

              This option must be the first option on the command line.

              This version of `sq` implements version 1.2.0 of the CLI interface.

              Stable since 1.2.0.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
              Print help (see a summary with '-h')

       <b>--home</b>=<u>PATH</u>
              Set the home directory

              Sequoia's default home directory is `$HOME`.  When using the default location,  files  are  placed
              according  to  the  local standard, e.g., the XDG Base Directory Specification.  When an alternate
              location is specified, the user data, configuration files, and  cache  data  are  placed  under  a
              single, unified directory.  This is a lightweight way to partially isolate `sq`.

              Use 'default' to explicitly use the default location, use 'none' to not use a home directory.

       <b>--key-store</b>=<u>PATH</u>
              Override the key store server and its data

              A key store server manages and protects secret key material.  By default, `sq` connects to the key
              store      server     for     Sequoia's     default     home     directory     (see     `--home`),
              $HOME/.local/share/sequoia/keystore.  If no key store server is running, one is started.

              This option causes `sq` to use an alternate key store server.  If necessary, a key store server is
              started, and configured to look for its data in the specified location.

              Use 'default' to explicitly use the default server, use 'none' to not use a key store.

       <b>--keyring</b>=<u>PATH</u>
              Specify the location of a keyring to use

              Keyrings are used in addition to any certificate  store.   The  content  of  the  keyring  is  not
              imported  into  the  certificate  store.   When a certificate is looked up, it is looked up in all
              keyrings and any certificate store, and the results are merged together.

       <b>--known-notation</b>=<u>NOTATION</u>
              Add NOTATION to the list of known notations

              This is used when validating signatures. Signatures that have unknown notations with the  critical
              bit set are considered invalid.

       <b>--overwrite</b>
              Overwrite existing files

       <b>--password-file</b>=<u>FILE</u>
              Seed the password cache with the specified password

              The  password  is  added to the password cache.  When decrypting secret key material, the password
              cache is only used if the key is not protected by a retry counter, which automatically  locks  the
              key if a wrong password is entered too many times.

              Note  that  the entire key file will be used as the password, including any surrounding whitespace
              like a trailing newline.

       <b>--policy-as-of</b>=<u>TIME</u>
              Select the cryptographic policy as of the specified time

              The  time  is  expressed  as  an  ISO  8601  formatted  timestamp.   The  policy  determines  what
              cryptographic constructs are allowed.

              If  you  are  working  with  a  message  that sq rejects, because it is protected by cryptographic
              constructs that are now considered  broken,  you  can  use  this  option  to  select  a  different
              cryptographic  policy.   If  you  are  relying  on  the  cryptography,  e.g.,  you are verifying a
              signature, then you should only do this if you are confident that the message hasn't been tampered
              with.

              TIME is interpreted as an ISO 8601 timestamp.  To set the  policy  time  to  January  1,  2007  at
              midnight UTC, you can do:

              $ sq --policy-as-of 20070101 verify msg.pgp

              Defaults to the reference time, which can be set using --time.

       <b>-q</b>, <b>--quiet</b>
              Be more quiet

              The default can be changed in the configuration file using the setting `ui.quiet`.

       <b>--time</b>=<u>TIME</u>
              Set the reference time as an ISO 8601 formatted timestamp

              Normally,  commands  use the current time as the reference time.  This argument allows the user to
              use a difference reference time.  For instance, when creating a key using `sq key  generate`,  the
              creation  time  is  normally  set  to  the  current time, but can be overridden using this option.
              Similarly, when verifying a message, the message is verified with respect  to  the  current  time.
              This option allows the user to use a different time.

              TIME  is  interpreted as an ISO 8601 timestamp.  To set the certification time to July 21, 2013 at
              midnight UTC, you can do:

              $ sq --time 20130721 verify msg.pgp

              To include a time, say 5:50 AM, add a T,  the  time  and  optionally  the  timezone  (the  default
              timezone is UTC):

              $ sq --time 20130721T0550+0200 verify msg.pgp

       <b>--trust-root</b>=<u>FINGERPRINT|KEYID</u>
              Consider the specified certificate to be a trust root

              Trust  roots  are  used  by trust models, e.g., the Web of Trust, to authenticate certificates and
              User IDs.

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b>
              Be more verbose

              The default can be changed in the configuration file using the setting `ui.verbose`.

</pre><h4><b>SUBCOMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>sq</b> <b>encrypt</b>
       Encrypt a message.

       Encrypt a message for any number of recipients and with any number of passwords, optionally  signing  the
       message in the process.

       The converse operation is `sq decrypt`.

       `sq  encrypt`  respects the reference time set by the top-level `--time` argument.  It uses the reference
       time when selecting encryption keys, and it sets the signature's creation time to the reference time.

   <b>sq</b> <b>decrypt</b>
       Decrypt a message.

       Decrypt a message using either supplied keys, or by prompting for a password.  If  message  tampering  is
       detected, an error is returned. See below for details.

       If  certificates are supplied using the `--signer-file` option, any signatures that are found are checked
       using these certificates. Verification is only successful if there is no bad signature, and the number of
       successfully verified signatures reaches the threshold configured with the `--signatures` parameter.

       If the signature verification fails, or if message tampering is detected, the program terminates with  an
       exit  status indicating failure.  and the output file is deleted.  If the output was sent to stdout, then
       the last 25 MiB of the message are withheld (consequently, if the message is  smaller  than  25  MiB,  no
       output is produced).

       The converse operation is `sq encrypt`.

   <b>sq</b> <b>sign</b>
       Sign messages or data files.

       Creates  signed  messages  or  detached  signatures.  Detached signatures are often used to sign software
       packages.

       The converse operation is `sq verify`.

       `sq sign` respects the reference time set by the top-level `--time` argument.   When  set,  it  uses  the
       specified  time  instead  of  the  current  time,  when  determining what keys are valid, and it sets the
       signature's creation time to the reference time instead of the current time.

   <b>sq</b> <b>verify</b>
       Verify signed messages or detached signatures.

       When verifying signed messages, the message is written to stdout or the file given to `--output`.

       When a detached message is verified, no output is produced.  Detached signatures are often used  to  sign
       software packages.

       Verification  is  only  successful  if there is no bad signature, and the number of successfully verified
       signatures reaches the threshold configured with  the  `--signatures`  parameter.   If  the  verification
       fails, the program terminates with an exit status indicating failure, and the output file is deleted.  If
       the  output  was  sent  to stdout, then the last 25 MiB of the message are withheld (consequently, if the
       message is smaller than 25 MiB, no output is produced).

       A signature is considered to have been authenticated if the signer can be authenticated.  If  the  signer
       is  provided  via `--signer-file`, then the signer is considered authenticated.  Otherwise, the signer is
       looked up and authenticated using the Web of Trust.  If at least one User ID can be fully  authenticated,
       then  the signature is considered to have been authenticated.  If the signature includes a Signer User ID
       subpacket, then only that User ID is considered.  Note: the User ID need not be self signed.

       The converse operation is `sq sign`.

       If you are looking for a standalone program to verify detached signatures, consider using sequoia-sqv.

       `sq verify` respects the reference time set by the top-level `--time` argument.  When  set,  it  verifies
       the message as of the reference time instead of the current time.

   <b>sq</b> <b>download</b>
       Download and authenticate the data.

       This  command downloads the data from the specified URL, checks the signature, and then authenticates the
       signer.  If the signer cannot be authenticated, the data is deleted, if possible.

   <b>sq</b> <b>inspect</b>
       Inspect data, like <a href="../man1/file.1.html">file</a>(1).

       It is often difficult to tell from cursory inspection using <a href="../man1/cat.1.html">cat</a>(1) or <a href="../man1/file.1.html">file</a>(1) what kind of OpenPGP one is
       looking at.  This subcommand inspects the data and provides a meaningful  human-readable  description  of
       it.

       `sq  inspect`  respects the reference time set by the top-level `--time` argument.  It uses the reference
       time when determining what binding signatures are active.

   <b>sq</b> <b>cert</b>
       Manage certificates.

       We use the term "certificate", or "cert" for short, to refer to OpenPGP keys that do not contain secrets.
       This subcommand provides primitives to generate and otherwise manipulate certs.

       Conversely, we use the term "key" to refer to OpenPGP keys that do contain secrets.   See  `sq  key`  for
       operations on keys.

   <b>sq</b> <b>key</b>
       Manage keys.

       We  use  the  term  "key"  to  refer  to  OpenPGP keys that do contain secrets.  This subcommand provides
       primitives to generate and otherwise manipulate keys.

       Conversely, we use the term "certificate", or "cert" for short, to refer to  OpenPGP  keys  that  do  not
       contain secrets.  See `sq cert` for operations on certificates.

   <b>sq</b> <b>pki</b>
       Authenticate certs using the Web of Trust.

       The "Web of Trust" is a decentralized trust model popularized by PGP. It is a superset of X.509, which is
       a hierarchical trust model, and is the most popular trust model on the public internet today.  As used on
       the  public  internet,  however,  X.509 relies on a handful of global certification authorities (CAs) who
       often undermine its security.

       The Web of Trust is more nuanced than X.509.  Using the Web of Trust, require multiple, independent paths
       to authenticate a binding by only partially  trusting  CAs.   This  prevents  a  single  bad  actor  from
       compromising  their security.  And those who have stronger security requirements can use the Web of Trust
       in a completely decentralized manner where only the individuals they select –  who  are  not  necessarily
       institutions – act as trusted introducers.

   <b>sq</b> <b>network</b>
       Retrieve and publish certificates over the network.

       OpenPGP  certificates  can  be discovered and updated from, and published on services accessible over the
       network.  This is a collection of commands to interact with these services.

   <b>sq</b> <b>keyring</b>
       Manage collections of keys or certs.

       Collections of keys or certificates (also known as "keyrings" when they contain secret key material,  and
       "certrings" when they don't) are any number of concatenated certificates.  This subcommand provides tools
       to list, split, merge, and filter keyrings.

       Note: In the documentation of this subcommand, we sometimes use the terms keys and certs interchangeably.

   <b>sq</b> <b>packet</b>
       Low-level packet manipulation.

       An  OpenPGP  data  stream  consists of packets.  These tools allow working with packet streams.  They are
       mostly of interest to developers, but `sq packet dump` may be helpful to a wider audience both to provide
       valuable information in bug reports to OpenPGP-related software, and as a learning tool.

   <b>sq</b> <b>config</b>
       Get configuration options.

       This   subcommand   can   be   used   to   inspect   the   configuration    file    (default    location:
       $HOME/.config/sequoia/sq/config.toml), and to create a template that can be edited to your liking.

       Configuration file: $HOME/.config/sequoia/sq/config.toml

   <b>sq</b> <b>version</b>
       Detailed version and output version information.

       With  no  further  options, this command lists the version of `sq`, the version of the underlying OpenPGP
       implementation `sequoia-openpgp`, and which cryptographic library is used.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>SEQUOIA_CERT_STORE</b>=<u>PATH</u>
              Specify the location of the certificate store

              By default, `sq`  uses  the  OpenPGP  certificate  directory  in  Sequoia's  home  directory  (see
              `--home`),  $HOME/.local/share/pgp.cert.d.   This  can  be  overridden by setting the `PGP_CERT_D`
              environment variable.

              Use 'default' to explicitly use the default cert store, use 'none' to not use a cert store.

       <b>SEQUOIA_HOME</b>=<u>PATH</u>
              Set the home directory

              Sequoia's default home directory is `$HOME`.  When using the default location,  files  are  placed
              according  to  the  local standard, e.g., the XDG Base Directory Specification.  When an alternate
              location is specified, the user data, configuration files, and  cache  data  are  placed  under  a
              single, unified directory.  This is a lightweight way to partially isolate `sq`.

              Use 'default' to explicitly use the default location, use 'none' to not use a home directory.

       <b>SEQUOIA_KEY_STORE</b>=<u>PATH</u>
              Override the key store server and its data

              A key store server manages and protects secret key material.  By default, `sq` connects to the key
              store      server     for     Sequoia's     default     home     directory     (see     `--home`),
              $HOME/.local/share/sequoia/keystore.  If no key store server is running, one is started.

              This option causes `sq` to use an alternate key store server.  If necessary, a key store server is
              started, and configured to look for its data in the specified location.

              Use 'default' to explicitly use the default server, use 'none' to not use a key store.
