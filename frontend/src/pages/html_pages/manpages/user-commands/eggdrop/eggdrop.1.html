</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       eggdrop - an IRC bot

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>eggdrop</b> [<b>options</b>] [<b>config-file</b>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Eggdrop</b>  is  the World's most popular Internet Relay Chat (IRC) bot; it is freely distributable under the
       GNU General Public License (GPL). Eggdrop is a feature rich  program  designed  to  be  easily  used  and
       expanded upon by both novice and advanced IRC users on a variety of hardware and software platforms.

       An  IRC bot is a program that sits on an IRC channel and performs automated tasks while looking just like
       a normal user on the channel. Some of these functions include protecting the channel from abuse, allowing
       privileged users to gain op or voice status,  logging  channel  events,  providing  information,  hosting
       games, etc.

       One  of  the  features  that makes Eggdrop stand out from other bots is module and Tcl scripting support.
       With scripts and modules, you can make the bot perform almost any task you want.  They  can  do  anything
       from preventing floods to greeting users and banning advertisers from channels.

       You  can  also link multiple Eggdrop bots together to form a botnet. This can allow bots to op each other
       securely, control floods efficiently, and even link channels across multiple IRC networks. It also allows
       the Eggdrops share user lists, ban lists, exempt/invite lists,  and  ignore  lists  with  other  bots  if
       userfile  sharing  is  enabled. This allows users to have the same access on every bot on your botnet. It
       also allows the bots to distribute tasks such as opping and banning users. See doc/BOTNET for information
       on setting up a botnet.

       Eggdrop needs a config file to run. For an example, have a look at <b>eggdrop.conf</b> which is distributed with
       Eggdrop.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-h</b>     Display a list of command-line options.

       <b>-n</b>     Don't background. Normally, Eggdrop will move itself into the background when  you  start  it  up,
              meaning  you'll  get  another  shell prompt, and you can do other things while the bot is running.
              With -n, you won't return to the shell prompt until the bot exits  (which  won't  normally  happen
              until it's killed). By default, -n will send all log entries to the console.

       <b>-nt</b>    Don't  background,  use terminal. This is just like -n, except that instead of seeing log entries,
              your console will simulate a DCC chat with the bot.

       <b>-nc</b>    Don't background, show channel info. This is just like -n,  except  that  instead  of  seeing  log
              entries, every 10 seconds your screen will clear and you will see the current channel status, sort
              of like "top".

       <b>-m</b>     Create  userfile.  If  you don't have a userfile, this will make Eggdrop create one and give owner
              status to the first person that introduces himself or herself to it. You'll need to do  this  when
              you first set up your bot.

       <b>-v</b>     Show version info, then quit.

</pre><h4><b>SIGNALS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>SIGCHLD</b>
              This signal is ignored by Eggdrop and can be used to determine whether it's running or not.

       <b>SIGTERM</b>
              By  default Eggdrop will save its user and channel file and die. A script can override the default
              handler by registering with the EVNT bind and returning 1.

       <b>SIGHUP</b> By default Eggdrop will rehash (reload its config file). A script can override the default handler
              by registering with the EVNT bind and returning 1.

       <b>SIGQUIT</b>
              By default Eggdrop will restart. A script can override the default handler by registering with the
              EVNT bind and returning 1.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>EGG_LANG</b>
              This variable can be set to the language in which you want Eggdrop to speak
               to you. It defaults to English, but German, French, Finnish, and Danish are supported, too.

       <b>EGG_LANGDIR</b>
              Specifies the directory where all your language files are stored.  The default is ./language.

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       <a href="../man1/tclsh.1.html">tclsh</a>(1), <a href="../man1/irc.1.html">irc</a>(1), <a href="../man1/ircII.1.html">ircII</a>(1), <a href="../man8/ircd.8.html">ircd</a>(8)

       There is extensive <b>online</b> <b>documentation.</b>  Once you get the bot running, open a  DCC  chat  with  it,  and
       type: <b>.help</b>

       In addition, the files in the <b>doc/</b> directory provide <b>detailed</b> <b>information</b> about how Eggdrop works and how
       to use it.
