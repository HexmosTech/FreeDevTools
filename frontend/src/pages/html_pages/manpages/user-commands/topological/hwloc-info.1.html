</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       hwloc-info - Show some information about some objects, a topology or supported features

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>hwloc-info</b> [ <u>options</u> ]...  <u>&lt;object&gt;</u>...

       <b>hwloc-info</b> [ <u>options</u> ] root <b>hwloc-info</b> [ <u>options</u> ] [ topology | levels | support ]

       <u>&lt;object&gt;</u>...  may  be  a  space-separated  list  of  target  objects  to  query.   The program reports all
       information about one object before looking at the next one:

           $ hwloc-info core:2 package:1 pu:all
           Core L#2
            type = Core
            ...
           Package L#1
            ...
           PU L#0
            ...
           PU L#1
            ...

       The list may also contain special keywords such as:

           <b>root</b> for the topology root object.

           <b>levels</b> for information about topology levels (default if no target  object  is  given,  identical  to
       <b>--topology</b>).

           <b>topology</b>  for  topology  info  attributes  stored  in the root object (for forward compatibility with
       topology info attrs in hwloc 3.0).

           <b>support</b> for information about supported features (identical to <b>--support</b>).

       Real targets and special keywords may be combined:

           $ hwloc-info core:2 topology pu:3 levels

       Note that <a href="../man7/hwloc.7.html">hwloc</a>(7) provides a detailed explanation of the hwloc system and of valid &lt;object&gt; formats;  it
       should be read before reading this man page.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--objects</b>
              Report  information  specific  objects.   This  is  the  default  if some objects are given on the
              command-line.

       <b>--topology</b>
              Report a summary of the topology instead of about some specific objects.  This  is  equivalent  to
              passing  <u>levels</u> as a target object on the command-line.  This is the default if no object is given
              on the command-line.

       <b>--support</b>
              Report the features that are supported by hwloc on the topology.  The features are those available
              through the <b>hwloc_topology_get_support()</b> function.  This is useful  for  verifying  which  CPU  or
              memory  binding  options  are  supported by the current hwloc installation.  This is equivalent to
              passing <u>support</u> as a target object on the command-line.

       <b>-i</b> &lt;path&gt;, <b>--input</b> &lt;path&gt;
              Read the topology from &lt;path&gt; instead of discovering the topology of the local machine.

              If &lt;path&gt; is a file, it may be a XML file exported by a previous hwloc program.  If &lt;path&gt; is "-",
              the standard input may be used as a XML file.

              On Linux, &lt;path&gt; may be a directory containing the topology files gathered  from  another  machine
              topology with hwloc-gather-topology.

              On x86, &lt;path&gt; may be a directory containing a cpuid dump gathered with hwloc-gather-cpuid.

              When  the archivemount program is available, &lt;path&gt; may also be a tarball containing such Linux or
              x86 topology files.

       <b>-i</b> &lt;specification&gt;, <b>--input</b> &lt;specification&gt;
              Simulate a fake hierarchy  (instead  of  discovering  the  topology  on  the  local  machine).  If
              &lt;specification&gt; is "node:2 pu:3", the topology will contain two NUMA nodes with 3 processing units
              in each of them.  The &lt;specification&gt; string must end with a number of PUs.

       <b>--if</b> &lt;format&gt;, <b>--input-format</b> &lt;format&gt;
              Enforce the input in the given format, among <b>xml</b>, <b>fsroot</b>, <b>cpuid</b> and <b>synthetic</b>.

       <b>-v</b> <b>--verbose</b>
              Include additional detail.

       <b>-q</b> <b>--quiet</b> <b>-s</b> <b>--silent</b>
              Reduce the amount of details to show.  A single summary line per object is displayed.

       <b>--get-attr</b> &lt;name&gt;
              Only  report  the  attribute of name &lt;name&gt; for each object (instead of all attributes).  The name
              must exactly match what is usually reported by the program,  for  instance  "complete  cpuset"  in
              "0.1: complete cpuset = %0x00ffff00".

              Only  the  value  is  reported, any other prefix or object name is ignored, so that the output may
              easily be used by other tools.

              This option also works on topology information but it is ignored for <b>levels</b> and <b>support</b> keywords.

       <b>--ancestors</b>
              Display information about the object as well as about all its ancestors up  to  the  root  of  the
              topology.  This is identical to <b>--ancestor</b> <b>all</b>

       <b>--ancestor</b> &lt;type&gt;
              Only display the object ancestors that match the given type.

              Some special values matching multiple types may also be given: <u>kind=normal</u> (CPU objects, including
              caches),  <u>kind=cpu</u>  (CPU objects, excluding caches), <u>kind=cache</u> (all caches, including memory-side
              caches), <u>kind=memory</u> (NUMA nodes or memory-side  caches),  <u>kind=io</u>  (IO  objects),  <u>kind=all</u>  (all
              objects).   See  also <u>Object</u> <u>Kind</u> in Terms and Definitions in the documentation.  The prefix <u>kind=</u>
              may be omitted if there is no ambiguity.

              If multiple ancestors match, they are reported from the deepest to the highest  in  the  topology.
              Adding <b>--first</b> will only show the first one.

       <b>--children</b>
              Display information about the object children.

       <b>--descendants</b> &lt;type&gt;
              Display information about the object descendants that match the given type.

              Some special values matching multiple types may also be given: <u>kind=normal</u> (CPU objects, including
              caches),  <u>kind=cpu</u>  (CPU objects, excluding caches), <u>kind=cache</u> (all caches, including memory-side
              caches), <u>kind=memory</u> (NUMA nodes or memory-side  caches),  <u>kind=io</u>  (IO  objects),  <u>kind=all</u>  (all
              objects).   See  also <u>Object</u> <u>Kind</u> in Terms and Definitions in the documentation.  The prefix <u>kind=</u>
              may be omitted if there is no ambiguity.

              If multiple objects match, they are reported  in  a  depth-first  order  (first  child,  then  its
              children, etc., then second child, etc.).  Adding <b>--first</b> will only show the first one.

       <b>--local-memory</b>
              Display information about the NUMA nodes that are local to the given object.

       <b>--local-memory-flags</b>
              Change  the  flags  used to select local NUMA nodes.  Flags may be given as numeric values or as a
              comma-separated list of flag names that  are  passed  to  <u>hwloc_get_local_numanode_objs()</u>.   Those
              names  may  be  substrings of actual flag names as long as a single one matches.  The default is <b>3</b>
              (or <b>smaller,larger</b>) which means NUMA nodes are displayed if their locality either contains  or  is
              contained in the locality of the given object.

              This option enables <b>--local-memory</b>.

       <b>--best-memattr</b> &lt;name&gt;
              Enable  the  listing  of  local memory nodes with <b>--local-memory</b>, but only display the local nodes
              that have the best value for the memory attribute given by <u>&lt;name&gt;</u> (or as an index).  If the memory
              attribute values depend on the initiator, the object given to hwloc-info is used as the initiator.

              <u>&lt;name&gt;</u> may be suffixed  with  flags  to  tune  the  selection  of  best  nodes,  for  instance  as
              <b>bandwidth,strict,default</b>.   <b>default</b>  means  that  all local nodes are reported if no best could be
              found.  <b>strict</b> means that nodes are selected only if their performance is the  best  for  all  the
              input  CPUs.  On  a  dual-socket machine with HBM in each socket, both HBMs are the best for their
              local socket, but not for the remote socket.  Hence both HBM are  also  considered  best  for  the
              entire machine by default, but none if <b>strict</b>.

       <b>--first</b>
              For  each input object, only report the first matching output object (first ancestor, first child,
              etc.).

       <b>-n</b>     When outputting object information, prefix each line with  the  index  of  the  considered  object
              within  the  input.   For  instance,  if three cores were given in input, the output lines will be
              prefixed with "0: ", "1: " or "2: ".  If <b>--ancestor</b> is also used, the prefix will be "X.Y: " where
              X is the index of the considered object within the input, and Y is the parent  index  (0  for  the
              object itself, increasing towards the root of the topology).

       <b>--disallowed</b>
              Include objects disallowed by administrative limitations.

       <b>--restrict</b> &lt;cpuset&gt;
              Restrict  the  topology  to  the  given  cpuset.   This  removes some PUs and their now-child-less
              parents.

              Beware that restricting the PUs in a topology may change the  logical  indexes  of  many  objects,
              including NUMA nodes.

       <b>--restrict</b> nodeset=&lt;nodeset&gt;
              Restrict   the  topology  to  the  given  nodeset  (unless  <b>--restrict-flags</b>  specifies  something
              different).  This removes some NUMA nodes and their now-child-less parents.

              Beware that restricting the NUMA nodes in a topology  may  change  the  logical  indexes  of  many
              objects, including PUs.

       <b>--restrict</b> binding
              Restrict  the topology to the current process binding.  This option requires the use of the actual
              current machine topology (or any other topology with <b>--thissystem</b> or with HWLOC_THISSYSTEM set  to
              1 in the environment).

              Beware that restricting the topology may change the logical indexes of many objects, including PUs
              and NUMA nodes.

       <b>--restrict-flags</b> &lt;flags&gt;
              Enforce  flags when restricting the topology.  Flags may be given as numeric values or as a comma-
              separated list of flag names that are passed to <u>hwloc_topology_restrict()</u>.   Those  names  may  be
              substrings  of  actual flag names as long as a single one matches, for instance <b>bynodeset,memless</b>.
              The default is <b>0</b> (or <b>none</b>).

       <b>--filter</b> &lt;type&gt;:&lt;kind&gt;, <b>--filter</b> &lt;type&gt;
              Filter objects of type &lt;type&gt;, or of any type if &lt;type&gt; is "all".  "io", "cache" and "icache"  are
              also supported.

              &lt;kind&gt;  specifies  the  filtering  behavior.  If "none" or not specified, all objects of the given
              type are removed.  If "all", all objects are kept as usual.  If "structure", objects are kept when
              they bring structure to the topology.  If "important" (only applicable  to  I/O  and  Misc),  only
              important objects are kept.  See hwloc_topology_set_type_filter() for more details.

       <b>--no-icaches</b>
              Do not show Instruction caches, only Data and Unified caches are considered.  This is identical to
              <b>--filter</b> <b>icache:none</b>.

       <b>--no-io</b>
              Do  not show any I/O device or bridge.  This is identical to <b>--filter</b> <b>io:none</b>.  By default, common
              devices (GPUs, NICs, block devices, ...) and interesting bridges are shown.

       <b>--no-bridges</b>
              Do not show any I/O bridge except hostbridges.  This is identical  to  <b>--filter</b>  <b>bridge:none</b>.   By
              default, common devices (GPUs, NICs, block devices, ...) and interesting bridges are shown.

       <b>--whole-io</b>
              Show  all I/O devices and bridges.  This is identical to <b>--filter</b> <b>io:all</b>.  By default, only common
              devices (GPUs, NICs, block devices, ...) and interesting bridges are shown.

       <b>--thissystem</b>
              Assume that the selected backend provides the topology for the system on  which  we  are  running.
              This is useful when using <b>--restrict</b> binding and loading a custom topology such as an XML file.

       <b>--pid</b> &lt;pid&gt;
              Detect topology as seen by process &lt;pid&gt;, i.e. as if process &lt;pid&gt; did the discovery itself.  Note
              that  this  can for instance change the set of allowed processors.  Also show this process current
              CPU binding by marking the corresponding PUs (in Green in the graphical  output,  see  the  COLORS
              section  below,  or by appending <u>(binding)</u> to the verbose text output).  If 0 is given as pid, the
              current binding for the lstopo process will be shown.

       <b>-p</b> <b>--physical</b>
              Use OS/physical indexes instead of logical indexes for input.

       <b>-l</b> <b>--logical</b>
              Use logical indexes instead of physical/OS indexes for input (default).

       <b>--version</b>
              Report version and exit.

       <b>-h</b> <b>--help</b>
              Display help message and exit.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       hwloc-info displays information about the specified objects.  It is intended to be used with  tools  such
       as  grep  for  filtering  certain  attribute  lines.   When no object is specified, or when <b>--topology</b> is
       passed, hwloc-info prints a summary of the topology.  When <b>--support</b>  is  passed,  hwloc-info  lists  the
       supported features for the topology.

       Objects  may be specified as location tuples, as explained in <a href="../man7/hwloc.7.html">hwloc</a>(7).  However hexadecimal bitmasks are
       not accepted since they may correspond to multiple objects.

       <b>NOTE:</b> It is highly recommended that you read the <a href="../man7/hwloc.7.html">hwloc</a>(7) overview page before  reading  this  man  page.
       Most of the concepts described in <a href="../man7/hwloc.7.html">hwloc</a>(7) directly apply to the hwloc-calc utility.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       To display information about each package:

           $ hwloc-info package:all
           Package L#0
            logical index = 0
           ...

       To display information about the core whose physical index is 2:

           $ hwloc-info -p core:2
           Core L#1
            logical index = 1
            os index = 2
           ...

       To list the OS devices that are of subtype OpenCL:

           $ hwloc-info -s "os[OpenCL]:all"
           CoProc:6
           CoProc:8

       To find the PCI bus ID of PCI devices containing OpenCL devices:

           $ hwloc-info --ancestor PCI --get-attr "attr PCI bus id" 'os[opencl]:all'
           0000:05:00.0
           0000:42:00.0

       To list the NUMA nodes that are local a PU:

           $ hwloc-info --local-memory pu:25
           NUMANode L#6 = local memory #0 of PU L#25
            type = NUMANode
           ...
           NUMANode L#7 = local memory #1 of PU L#25
            type = NUMANode
           ...

       To show the best-bandwidth node(s) among NUMA nodes local to a PU:

           $ hwloc-info --local-memory --best-memattr bandwidth pu:25
           NUMANode L#7 = local memory #1 of PU L#25
            type = NUMANode
           ...

       to find where a NUMA node is attached in the hierarchy of CPU cores:

           $ hwloc-info --ancestor kind=normal --first -s numa:1
           Package:0

       To see levels and topology info attributes stored in the root object:

           $ hwloc-info levels topology
           depth 0:           1 Machine (type #0)
            depth 1:          1 Package (type #1)
             depth 2:         2 Core (type #2)
              depth 3:        4 PU (type #3)
           Special depth -3:  1 NUMANode (type #13)
           info Backend = Linux
           info LinuxCgroup = /user/622
           info Architecture = x86_64
           info hwlocVersion = 3.0.0a1-git
