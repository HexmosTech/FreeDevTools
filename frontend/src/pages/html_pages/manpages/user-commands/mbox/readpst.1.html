</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>readpst</b> is a program that can read an Outlook PST (Personal Folders) file and convert it into an mbox
       file, a format suitable for KMail, a recursive mbox structure, or separate emails.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       -C <u>default-charset</u>
           Set the character set to be used for items with an unspecified character set.

       -D
           Include deleted items in the output.

       -M
           Output messages in MH (rfc822) format as separate files. This will create folders as named in the PST
           file, and will put each email together with any attachments into its own file. These files will be
           numbered from 1 to n with no leading zeros. This format has no from quoting.

       -S
           Output messages into separate files. This will create folders as named in the PST file, and will put
           each email in its own file. These files will be numbered from 1 to n with no leading zeros.
           Attachments will also be saved in the same folder as the email message. The attachments for message
           $m are saved as $m-$name where $name is (the original name of the attachment, or 'attach$n' if the
           attachment had no name), where $n is another sequential index with no leading zeros. This format has
           no from quoting.

       -V
           Show program version and exit.

       -a <u>attachment-extension-list</u>
           Set the list of acceptable attachment extensions. Any attachment that does not have an extension on
           this list will be discarded. All attachments are acceptable if the list is empty, or this option is
           not specified.

       -b
           Do not save the attachments for the RTF format of the email body.

       -c <u>format</u>
           Set the Contact output mode. Use -cv for vcard format or -cl for an email list.

       -d <u>debug-file</u>
           Specify name of debug log file. The log file is now an ascii file, instead of the binary file used in
           previous versions.

       -e
           Same as the M option, but each output file will include an extension from (.eml, .ics, .vcf). This
           format has no from quoting.

       -h
           Show summary of options and exit.

       -j <u>jobs</u>
           Specifies the maximum number of parallel jobs. Specify 0 to suppress running parallel jobs. Folders
           may be processed in parallel. Output formats that place each mail message in a separate file (-M, -S,
           -e) may process the contents of individual folders in parallel.

       -k
           Changes the output format to KMail. This format uses mboxrd from quoting.

       -m
           Same as the e option, but write .msg files also

       -o <u>output-directory</u>
           Specifies the output directory. The directory must already exist, and is entered after the PST file
           is opened, but before any processing of files commences.

       -q
           Changes to silent mode. No feedback is printed to the screen, except for error messages.

       -r
           Changes the output format to Recursive. This will create folders as named in the PST file, and will
           put all emails in a file called "mbox" inside each folder. Appointments go into a file called
           "calendar", address book entries go into a file called "contacts", and journal entries go into a file
           called "journal". These files are then compatible with all mbox-compatible email clients. This format
           uses mboxrd from quoting.

       -t <u>output-type-codes</u>
           Specifies the item types that are processed. The argument is a sequence of single letters from
           (e,a,j,c) for (email, appointment, journal, contact) types. The default is to process all item types.

       -u
           Sets Thunderbird mode, a submode of recursive mode. This causes two extra .type and .size meta files
           to be created. This format uses mboxrd from quoting.

       -w
           Overwrite any previous output files. Beware: When used with the -S switch, this will remove all files
           from the target folder before writing. This is to keep the count of emails and attachments correct.

       -8
           Output bodies in UTF-8, rather than original encoding, if a UTF-8 version is available.

</pre><h4><b>FROM</b> <b>QUOTING</b></h4><pre>
       Output formats that place each mail message in a separate file (-M, -S, -e, -m) don't do any from
       quoting. Output formats that place multiple email messages in a single file (-k, -r, -u) now use mboxrd
       from quoting rules. If none of those switches are specified, the default output format uses mboxrd from
       quoting rules, since it produces multiple email messages in a single file. Earlier versions used mboxo
       from quoting rules for all output formats.
