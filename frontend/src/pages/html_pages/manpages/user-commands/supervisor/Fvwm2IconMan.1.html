</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       FvwmIconMan - an fvwm icon manager

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       FvwmIconMan is spawned by fvwm, so no command line invocation will work.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       FvwmIconMan  is  an  icon  manager  modeled  after the TWM icon manager.  The user may have multiple icon
       managers, each of which armed with a list of window types which it manages. For  example,  the  user  may
       have  one  manager  which lists only emacs windows, and another which lists everything else. You may also
       specify what resolution each icon manager uses, for example, one icon manager may manage windows  on  all
       desks, and another may manage only those on the current desk, page or screen. FvwmIconMan can display the
       miniature  icons  provided  by  fvwm  for  its managed windows. The managers may have a maximum number of
       columns (and so grows vertically), a maximum number of rows (and then grows horizontally), or stay  at  a
       fixed size, and adjust the size of the window buttons to fit (think win95's Taskbar). And when support is
       compiled in for the X Shape extension, then the manager windows may be shaped.

       You can specify actions to be run when mouse, or key events are received. For example, you could bind the
       first  mouse  button to iconify the selected window, and make bindings for the arrow keys to navigate the
       manager window without the mouse.

       FvwmIconMan can be set to display which window currently has the  keyboard  focus,  and  by  binding  the
       select event (see below) to the fvwm Focus function, you can emulate the TWM icon manager's behavior.

</pre><h4><b>INITIALIZATION</b></h4><pre>
       During  initialization, FvwmIconMan searches though the fvwm configuration file for the options which are
       described below. It is highly recommended that you make FvwmIconMan be a sticky window. And if  you  want
       to  make  use  of  the  followfocus  option,  and/or  binding  an  action  to Focus, then you should make
       FvwmIconMan clicktofocus. Also, when using the Shape option, it's recommended that the FvwmIconMan window
       not be decorated at all by fvwm.

</pre><h4><b>INVOCATION</b></h4><pre>
       FvwmIconMan can be invoked by  inserting  the  line  'Module  FvwmIconMan'  in  the  .fvwm2rc  file.   If
       FvwmIconMan  is  to  be  spawned  during  fvwm's  initialization,  then this line should be placed in the
       StartFunction declarations, or it can be bound to a menu, mouse button, or keystroke to invoke it later.

       If you wish to run FvwmIconMan in a transient mode, such as with the built  in  window  list,  then  pass
       "-Transient" as an argument. The invocation "Module FvwmIconMan -Transient" will do nicely. In this mode,
       FvwmIconMan  will pop up one manager window directly under the cursor. When the mouse button is released,
       it will execute the appropriate action, and then exit.  Things are somewhat complicated by the fact  that
       you  can  specify  that  FvwmIconMan  creates multiple manager windows, behavior which is unsuitable when
       running transiently. So, when running transiently, FvwmIconMan will only create one manager  window.  Use
       the manager id 'transient' to specify options for this manager window.

       FvwmIconMan  may  accept  an  alias  name  as an argument.  For example, "Module FvwmIconMan FvwmIconMan-
       Variant2".

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>OPTIONS</b> <b>REFERENCE</b> <b>CHART</b></h4><pre>
       FvwmIconMan has acquired quite a few options. I assume others share my dislike of paging  though  a  long
       man page, so here is a terse reference chart describing the available options. They are described in more
       detail in the next section.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       With  the  exception of the nummanagers option, all of the options may be defined on a per-manager basis.
       So, for example, the user may have his emacs manager with a red foreground, and his xterm manager with  a
       blue one. A configuration line may therefore have one of two forms:

       *FvwmIconMan: OptionName OptionValue
              To specify that the <u>OptionName</u> takes the value <u>OptionValue</u> for all managers.

       *FvwmIconMan: ManagerId OptionName OptionValue
              To specify that the option <u>OptionName</u> takes the value <u>OptionValue</u> for manager <u>ManagerId</u>. <u>ManagerId</u>
              may  either  be  a  positive  integer, or the string "transient". An integer id refers to managers
              which FvwmIconMan creates when running normally, and an id of "transient"  refers  to  the  single
              manager which FvwmIconMan creates when running transiently.

              The  old syntax, that uses an asterisk instead of white spaces before <u>ManagerId</u> and <u>OptionName</u>, is
              supported too, but it is obsolete now.

       The following options may be specified:

       *FvwmIconMan: NumManagers <u>num</u>
              <u>num</u> is a positive integer specifying the total number of icon managers.  Since  FvwmIconMan  would
              like to know how many managers there are before handling any manager specific options, this should
              come first. The default is 1.

       *FvwmIconMan: [id] Action <u>type</u> <u>binding</u>
              Binds  an  FvwmIconMan  command to an event. <u>Type</u> may be one of the values: Key, Mouse, or Select.
              Actions are described in the following section ACTIONS.

       *FvwmIconMan: [id] Background <u>background</u>
              Specifies the default background color.

       *FvwmIconMan: [id] ButtonGeometry <u>geometry</u>
              Specifies the initial geometry of an individual button in pixels. If the specified  height  is  0,
              then the button height is determined from the font size. X and Y coordinates are ignored.

       *FvwmIconMan: [id] Colorset <u>colorset</u>
              The default colorset used. Overrides background and foreground.

       *FvwmIconMan: [id] DrawIcons <u>value</u>
              If your version of fvwm is capable of using mini icons, then this option determines if FvwmIconMan
              displays  the  mini icons. Otherwise, it generates an error message.  "true" means that mini icons
              are shown for iconified windows, "false" that mini icons are never shown, and "always"  that  mini
              icons are shown for all windows.

       *FvwmIconMan: [id] FocusAndSelectButton <u>style</u> [<u>forecolor</u> <u>backcolor</u>]
              Same  as  the  plainbutton  option, but specifies the look of buttons which are both selected, and
              have the keyboard focus.

       *FvwmIconMan: [id] FocusAndSelectColorset <u>colorset</u>
              Works like focusandselectbutton but uses colorsets instead.  The style setting can still  only  be
              applied with focusandselectbutton.

       *FvwmIconMan: [id] FocusButton <u>style</u> [<u>forecolor</u> <u>backcolor</u>]
              Same  as the plainbutton option, but specifies the look of buttons whose windows have the keyboard
              focus.

       *FvwmIconMan: [id] FocusColorset <u>colorset</u>
              Works like focusbutton but uses colorsets instead.  The style setting can still  only  be  applied
              with focusbutton.

       *FvwmIconMan: [id] FollowFocus <u>boolean</u>
              If <u>true</u>, then the button appearance reflects which window currently has focus.  Default is false.

       *FvwmIconMan: [id] Font <u>font</u>
              Specifies the font to be used for labeling the buttons. The default is 8x13.

       *FvwmIconMan: [id] Foreground <u>foreground</u>
              Specifies the default foreground color.

       *FvwmIconMan: [id] Format <u>formatstring</u>
              A  printf  like  format  string which describes the string to be printed in the manager window for
              each managed window. Possible flags are: %t, %i, %c, and %r for the window's  title,  icon  title,
              class,  or  resource  name,  respectively.  The default is "%c: %i". <b>Warning</b>: m4 reserves the word
              <u>format</u>, so if you use m4, take appropriate action.

       *FvwmIconMan: [id] IconName <u>iconstring</u>
              Specifies the window icon name for that manager window. <u>Iconstring</u> may either be a single word, or
              a string enclosed in quotes. The default is "FvwmIconMan".

       *FvwmIconMan: [id] IconAndSelectButton <u>style</u> [<u>forecolor</u> <u>backcolor</u>]
              Same as the plainbutton option, but specifies the look of buttons whose windows are iconified  and
              the button is selected.

       *FvwmIconMan: [id] IconButton <u>style</u> [<u>forecolor</u> <u>backcolor</u>]
              Same as the plainbutton option, but specifies the look of buttons whose windows are iconified.

       *FvwmIconMan: [id] IconAndSelectColorset <u>colorset</u>
              Works  like  IconAndSelectButton  but uses colorsets instead.  The style setting can still only be
              applied with iconbutton.

       *FvwmIconMan: [id] IconColorset <u>colorset</u>
              Works like iconbutton but uses colorsets instead.  The style setting can  still  only  be  applied
              with iconbutton.

       *FvwmIconMan: [id] ManagerGeometry <u>geometry</u>
              Specifies  the  initial  geometry  of  the  manager, in units of buttons. If <u>height</u> is 0, then the
              manager will use <u>width</u> columns, and will grow vertically once it  has  more  than  <u>width</u>  windows.
              Likewise,  if  <u>width</u>  is  0, it will use <u>height</u> rows, and grow horizontally.  If both are nonzero,
              then the manager window will be exactly that size, and stay that way. As columns are created,  the
              buttons  will  narrow  to accommodate.  If the geometry is specified with a negative y coordinate,
              then the window manager will grow upwards. Otherwise, it will grow downwards.

       *FvwmIconMan: [id] MaxButtonWidth <u>width</u>
              Defines a maximum for the width of a button (in pixels). By default there is no maximum.  A  value
              of  0 resets the default. The maximum is only used with a non growing manager (the ManagerGeometry
              option specifies non zero width and height).

       *FvwmIconMan: [id] MaxButtonWidthByColumns <u>col</u>
              This is another way to set the button width.  col is the number of columns of icons.   The  button
              width  is  determined  by  dividing  the total width of FvwmIconMan by the number of columns.  For
              example  if  the  width  of  FvwmIconMan  manager  is  1024,  MaxButtonWidthByColumns  is  4  then
              MaxButtonWidth  is  256.   This  is  useful when you do not know, at config time, the width of the
              manager, for example, for a swallowed FvwmIconMan.

       *FvwmIconMan: [id] NoIconAction  <u>action</u>
              Tells FvwmIconMan to do <u>action</u> when a NoIcon style window is iconified or  de-iconified.  Relevant
              coordinates  are  appended  to  <u>action</u> so that the icon can be traced to an FvwmIconMan button. An
              example action is "*FvwwmIconMan: NoIconAction SendToModule FvwmAnimate animate". A blank or  null
              action turns this feature off.

       *FvwmIconMan: [id] PlainButton <u>style</u> [<u>forecolor</u> <u>backcolor</u>]
              Specifies  how  normal  buttons look. <u>style</u> may be one of <u>flat</u>, <u>up</u>, <u>down</u>, <u>raisededge</u>, or <u>sunkedge</u>,
              and describes how the button is drawn. The color options are both optional, and if not  set,  then
              the default colors are used. If on a monochrome screen, then the <u>style</u> option is ignored, but must
              still be set.

       *FvwmIconMan: [id] PlainColorset <u>colorset</u>
              Works  like  plainbutton  but uses colorsets instead.  The style setting can still only be applied
              with plainbutton.

       *FvwmIconMan: [id] ReliefThickness <u>num</u>
              <u>num</u> is an integer specifying the number of pixels thick that the relief at the  edge  of  non-flat
              buttons  should  be.   Setting  this  to  0  will  produce  flat  buttons,  as  if  the values for
              <u>FocusAndSelectButton</u>, <u>FocusButton</u>, <u>IconAndSelectButton</u>, <u>IconButton</u>, <u>PlainButton</u>, <u>SelectButton</u>, and
              <u>TitleButton</u> were all set to <u>flat</u>.  If <u>num</u> is negative, the button will be inverted as if  you  had
              used <u>Reverse</u> for all classes.

       *FvwmIconMan: [id] Resolution <u>resolution</u>
              Specifies  when the manager will display an entry for a certain window. <u>resolution</u> may take one of
              the following values: global, desk, page, screen, !desk, !page, or !screen. If  global,  then  all
              windows  of the appropriate type (see the show and dontshow options below) will be shown. If desk,
              then only those windows on the current desk are shown. If page, then only  those  windows  on  the
              current  page  are  shown.  If  screen, then only those windows on the current Xinerama screen are
              shown. !desk reverses the sense of desk, displaying only those windows not on  the  current  desk.
              Likewise,  !page  shows  only  those  windows not on the current page and !screen shows only those
              windows not on the current Xinerama screen. The default is page. If Xinerama is not active or only
              a single screen is used, page and screen are equivalent.

              This configuration line is respected when FvwmIconMan  is  running  as  well,  the  resolution  is
              changed dynamically.

       *FvwmIconMan: [id] Reverse <u>class</u>
              Causes  certain  classes of buttons to have their relief lines reversed so that up and down styles
              are reversed. This has no affect on flat buttons. The class can  be  icon,  normal  or  none.  The
              default is none.

       *FvwmIconMan: [id] SelectButton <u>style</u> [<u>forecolor</u> <u>backcolor</u>]
              Same as the plainbutton option, but specifies the look of buttons when the mouse is over them.

       *FvwmIconMan: [id] SelectColorset <u>colorset</u>
              Works  like  selectbutton but uses colorsets instead.  The style setting can still only be applied
              with selectbutton.

       *FvwmIconMan: [id] Shape <u>boolean</u>
              If <u>True</u>, then use make the window shaped. Probably only useful if you  have  multiple  columns  or
              rows.  If  FvwmIconMan  wasn't  compiled  to  support the Shape extension, this generates an error
              message. When using shaped windows, it's recommended that a fvwm style  is  made  for  FvwmIconMan
              that has no borders.  Otherwise, fvwm will get confused.

       *FvwmIconMan: [id] Sort <u>value</u>
              If  <u>name</u>,  then  the  manager  list  is sorted by name. If <u>namewithcase</u>, then it is sorted by name
              sensitive to case. If <u>id</u>, then the manager list is sorted by the window id,  which  never  changes
              after  the  window  is  created.  If  <u>weighted</u>, then the manager list is sorted by weight (see the
              description of <u>sortweight</u> below). Or it can be set to <u>none</u>, which results in no  sorting.  Default
              is <u>name</u>.

       *FvwmIconMan: [id] SortWeight <u>weight</u> <u>pattern-list</u>
              Assigns  the specified <u>weight</u> to windows that match <u>pattern-list</u>.  The list is made up of patterns
              of the form <u>type=pattern</u>, where type is one of <u>class</u>, <u>resource</u>, <u>title</u>, or <u>icon</u>, and pattern is  an
              expression  of  the  same  format  used  in  the  fvwm  style  command (minimalistic shell pattern
              matching). Multiple sort weights can be given.  Each window is matched against the  list  of  sort
              weights, in order, and is given the weight from the first match. Lower-weighted windows are placed
              first in the manager list. For example:
              *FvwmIconMan: Sort       weighted
              *FvwmIconMan: SortWeight 1 class=XTerm title=special*
              *FvwmIconMan: SortWeight 10 class=XTerm
              *FvwmIconMan: SortWeight 5
              In  this  example,  xterm  windows  whose titles start with "special" (weight 1) are listed first,
              followed by everything but other xterms (weight 5), and the other xterms (weight  10)  are  listed
              last.  If  no default weight (empty pattern list) is given, the default weight is 0. Only relevant
              if the sort type is set to <u>weighted</u>.

       *FvwmIconMan: [id] Title <u>title-string</u>
              Specifies the window title string for that manager window. <u>Titlestring</u>  may  either  be  a  single
              word,  or  a  string  enclosed  in quotes. The default is "FvwmIconMan". This will be drawn in the
              title bar of the manager window, if any, and in the title button, which is the button  drawn  when
              the manager is empty.

       *FvwmIconMan: [id] TitleButton <u>style</u> [<u>forecolor</u> <u>backcolor</u>]
              Same  as the plainbutton option, but specifies the look of the title button (the button drawn when
              the manager is empty). The manager's title is drawn in the title button.

       *FvwmIconMan: [id] UseWinList <u>boolean</u>
              If <u>true</u>, then honor the WinListSkip style flag. Otherwise, all windows  are  subject  to  possible
              management according to the show and dontshow lists.

       The  two  following  options  control  which windows get handled by which managers. A manager can get two
       lists, one of windows to show, and one of windows to ignore. If only the <u>show</u> list is  given,  then  that
       manager will show only the windows in the list. If only the <u>DontShow</u> list is given, then the manager will
       show  all windows except those in the list. If both lists are given, then a window will be shown if it is
       not in the <u>DontShow</u> list, and in the <u>Show</u> list. And finally, if neither list is given, then  the  manager
       will  handle all windows. Each list is made up of patterns of the form <u>type=pattern</u>, where type is one of
       <u>class</u>, <u>resource</u>, <u>title</u>, or <u>icon</u>, and pattern is an expression of the same format used in the  fvwm  style
       command  (minimalistic  shell  pattern  matching). Quotes around the pattern will be taken as part of the
       expression. If a window could be handled by more than one manager, then the manager with  the  lowest  id
       gets it.

       *FvwmIconMan: [id] Show <u>pattern</u> <u>list</u>
              If a window matches one of the patterns in the list, then it may be handled by this manager.

       *FvwmIconMan: [id] DontShow <u>pattern</u> <u>list</u>
              If a window matches one of the patterns in the list, then it may not be handled by this manager.

       *FvwmIconMan: [id] ShowTransient <u>boolean</u>
              Show transient windows in the list (default false).

       *FvwmIconMan: [id] ShowOnlyIcons <u>boolean</u>
              Only iconified windows are shown if <u>boolean</u> is true.

       *FvwmIconMan: [id] ShowNoIcons <u>boolean</u>
              Only windows that are not iconified are shown if <u>boolean</u> is true.

       *FvwmIconMan: [id] ShowOnlyFocused <u>boolean</u>
              Only window with the focus is shown if <u>boolean</u> is true.

       The following two options control tips.

       *FvwmIconMan: [id] Tips <u>value</u>
              where  <u>value</u> can be always, needed or false. Default is false, no tips are displayed. With always,
              tips are enabled. With needed, a tip is displayed only if either the button string is truncated or
              the tip string is not equal to the button string.   This  configuration  line  is  respected  when
              FvwmIconMan is running as well.

       *FvwmIconMan: [id] TipsDelays <u>delay</u> [<u>mappeddelay</u>]
              where <u>delay</u> and <u>mappeddelay</u> are time out values in milliseconds.  If no <u>mappeddelay</u> is given <u>delay</u>
              is  assumed.  Default  is  1000  300.  When  the  cursor  is  on  a button, FvwmIconMan wait <u>delay</u>
              milliseconds before displaying the tip. In the case where a tip is already mapped and  the  cursor
              goes to another button, FvwmIconMan waits <u>mappeddelay</u> milliseconds before displaying the new tip.

       *FvwmIconMan: [id] TipsFont <u>fontname</u>
              Specifies the font to be used for tips. Default is the default fvwm font.

       *FvwmIconMan: [id] TipsColorset <u>colorset</u>
              Specifies the colors for tips window. Default is colorset 0.

       *FvwmIconMan: [id] TipsFormat <u>formatstring</u>
              Similar  to  the  Format option but for the tips window. The default is the format string from the
              Format option.

       *FvwmIconMan: [id] TipsBorderWidth <u>pixels</u>
              Specifies the border width (in pixels) of the tips window. Default is 1.

       *FvwmIconMan: [id] TipsPlacement <u>value</u>
              where <u>value</u> can be up, down, right, left, updown or leftright. This value specifies  the  position
              of the tips window relative to its button.  Default is updown where buttons on the top half of the
              screen get tips below the button, otherwise the tips are above the button.

       *FvwmIconMan: [id] TipsJustification <u>value</u>
              where  <u>value</u>  can  be leftup, rightdown or center.  Specifies the justification (direction) of the
              tips window relative to its button after the tips window has been placed.  Default is leftup which
              means that if a tip is placed above or below its button, then the left border of the  tip  and  of
              the  button  are  aligned.  If the tip is placed on the left or on the right of its button, leftup
              aligns the top borders. rightdown and center work like leftup but in  different  directions.   The
              alignment is adjusted by the TipsOffset option.  See next option.

       *FvwmIconMan: [id] TipsOffsets <u>placementoffset</u> <u>justoffset</u>
              where   <u>placementoffset</u>   and   <u>justoffset</u>  are  offsets  in  pixels  for  the  TipsPlacement  and
              TipsJustification configuration option.  Default is 3 2.

</pre><h4><b>ACTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Actions are commands which may be bound to an event of the type: a key press, a mouse click, or the mouse
       entering a window manager button - denoted by the action types <u>Key</u>, <u>Mouse</u>, and <u>Select</u>.

       Normally, actions bound to a mouse click are executed when the button is pressed. In transient mode,  the
       action  is  executed  when the button is released, since it is assumed that FvwmIconMan was bound to some
       mouse event. A tip/warning: FvwmIconMan still keeps track of the mouse button and any  modifier  keys  in
       this  case,  so  if  you  bind FvwmIconMan to say, meta-button3, then it would be wise to ensure that the
       action you want to execute will be executed when the meta-button3 event occurs (which would be the button
       release, assuming you kept your finger on the meta key).

       The syntax for actions are:

       <b>Key</b> <b>actions</b>: Key <u>Keysym</u> <u>Modifiers</u> <u>FunctionList</u>
              <u>Keysym</u> and <u>Modifiers</u> are exactly the same as for the fvwm <u>Key</u> command.

       <b>Mouse</b> <b>actions</b>: Mouse <u>Button</u> <u>Modifiers</u> <u>FunctionList</u>
              <u>Button</u> and <u>Modifiers</u> are exactly the same as for the fvwm <u>Mouse</u> command.

       <b>Select</b> <b>actions</b>: Select <u>FunctionList</u>

       A <u>FunctionList</u> is a sequence of commands separated by commas. They are executed in left to  right  order,
       in  one  shared context - which currently only contains a pointer to the "current" button. If a button is
       selected (typically by the mouse pointer sitting on it) when the action is  executed,  then  the  current
       button is initialized to that button. Otherwise, it points to nothing.

       Most  of  the available commands then modify this "current" button, either by moving it around, making it
       become the selected button, or sending commands to fvwm acting on the window represented by that  button.
       Note  that  while  this current button is initialized to be the selected button, the selected button does
       not implicitly follow it around. This way, the  user  can  send  commands  to  various  windows,  without
       changing which button is selected.

       Commands take five types of arguments: <u>Integer</u>, <u>Manager</u>, <u>Window</u>, <u>Button</u>, and <u>String</u>. A <u>String</u> is a string
       specified exactly as for fvwm - either in quotes or as a single word not in quotes. Again, you may bind a
       sequence of commands to an event, by listing them separated by commas.

       <u>Window</u>  and  <u>Button</u>  types  look  exactly  the  same  in the .fvwm2rc file, but are interpreted as either
       specifying a managed window, or a FvwmIconMan button representing a window. They can either be an integer
       (which is interpreted module N where N is the number of buttons - so 0 is the first and -1 is the  last),
       or  one  of  the strings: <u>Select</u>, <u>Focus</u>, <u>Up</u>, <u>Down</u>, <u>Right</u>, <u>Left</u>, <u>Next</u>, <u>Prev</u>. <u>Select</u> and <u>Focus</u> refer to the
       currently selected or focused button or window. <u>Up</u>, <u>Down</u>, <u>Right</u>, and <u>Left</u> refer to the button  or  window
       above,  below,  to  the  right  of,  or to the left of the current button in the manager window, allowing
       navigation around the manager window. <u>Next</u> and <u>Prev</u> designates the window, button, or  manager  after  or
       before  the  current button, allowing navigation of the one dimensional list of windows which is drawn in
       the manager window. If the manager is sorted, <u>Next</u> and <u>Prev</u> move through the windows in the sorted order.

       The <u>Manager</u> type can either be an integer, <u>Next</u>, or <u>Prev</u>.  The meaning is analogous to that of the <u>Button</u>
       type, but in terms of the integral index of the managers, restricted to managers which are nonempty.

       The following functions are currently defined:

       bif <u>Button</u> <u>Integer/String</u>
              A relative branch instruction. If <u>Button</u> is <u>Select</u> or <u>Focus</u>, then take the branch if  there  is  a
              selected button or a focused button. If <u>Button</u> is an integer, then branch if nonzero. If it is one
              of <u>Up</u>, <u>Down</u>, <u>Right</u>, <u>Left</u>, <u>Next</u>, <u>Prev</u>, then the branch is taken when the current button can move in
              that  direction.  If the branch is taken, then <u>Integer</u> commands are skipped. No backwards branches
              are allowed.

       bifn <u>Button</u> <u>Integer/String</u>
              The complement of bif. The branch is taken if <u>Button</u> evaluates to false, by  the  criteria  listed
              for bif.

       gotobutton <u>Button</u>
              Sets  current  button to <u>Button</u>. If <u>Button</u> is an integer, then the current button is set to <u>Button</u>
              modulo the number of buttons, in the whichever manager contains the selected button, if any.

       gotomanager <u>Manager</u>
              Sets button to button 0 of <u>Manager</u>. This will only go  to  a  visible,  nonempty  manager.  So  an
              integral argument is taken modulo the number of such managers.

       jmp <u>Integer/String</u>
              Executes  a  relative  jump  of <u>Integer</u> instructions. Backwards jumps are not allowed. The jump is
              computed relative to the instruction following the jmp.

       label <u>String</u>
              Provides a label that previous instructions can jump to. It will not be visible to subsequent jump
              instructions, and the same label can be used multiple times in the same instruction  list  (though
              it would be perverse to do so.)

       print <u>String</u>
              Prints <u>String</u> to the console. Useful for debugging actions.

       printdebug
              Prints defined actions to the console. Should only be used by developers.  To enable this command,
              set  CONFIG  and  FUNCTIONS variables to '1' in the modules/FvwmIconMan/debug.h and recompile this
              module.

       quit   Quits FvwmIconMan.

       refresh
              Causes all manager windows to redraw themselves.

       ret    Stop executing the entire action.

       searchback <u>String</u>
              Sets button to button before the current one whose printed string in the  manager  window  matches
              specified <u>String</u>, which may contain wildcards.

       searchforward <u>String</u>
              Sets  button  to  button  after the current one whose printed string in the manager window matches
              specified <u>String</u>, which may contain wildcards.

       select Selects the current button, if any. If a select action has been specified, it will  then  be  run.
              Therefore, it is considered unwise to set the select button in the select action.

       sendcommand <u>Command</u>
              Sends the fvwm command <u>Command</u> to the window represented by the current button, if any.

       warp   Warps cursor to current button, if any.

       <b>Examples:</b>
       gotobutton select, gotobutton Down, select
       Selects  the  button below the currently selected button. Since the current button is already initialized
       to the selected button, this may be shortened to "gotobutton Down, select".

       gotobutton Up, select
       Selects the button above the currently selected button.

       gotobutton 0, select
       Selects the first button of the current manager. If there is no current manager, which is the  case  when
       no button is selected, then this does nothing.

       gotobutton -1, select
       Selects the last button of the current manager.

       gotobutton focus, select
       Selects the button corresponding to the focused window.

       gotobutton focus, Iconify
       Sends the fvwm command Iconify to the focused window. Note that this does not change the selected button.

       bif Next 3, gotobutton 0, select, ret, gotobutton Next, select
       If a button is selected, and it's the last button, go to button 0. If it's not the last button, go to the
       next  button.  Otherwise,  do  nothing.  Basically, this action cycles through all buttons in the current
       manager.

       bif select 7, bif focus 3, gotomanager 0, select, ret, gotobutton focus, \
         select, ret, gotobutton down, select
       This is good for sending to FvwmIconMan with a SendToModule command. If there is a  selected  button,  it
       moves  down.  Otherwise,  if  there is a focused button, it is selected. Otherwise, button 0 of manager 0
       gets selected.

       bif select Select, bif focus Focus, gotomanager 0, select, ret, label Focus, \
         gotobutton focus, select, ret, label Select, gotobutton down, select
       Same as previous, but using the label instruction.

       In addition to being bound to keys and mice, actions can  be  sent  from  fvwm  to  FvwmIconMan  via  the
       SendToModule  command. Don't quote the command when using SendToModule. Also, due to a bug in the current
       version of fvwm, don't quote FvwmIconMan either.

</pre><h4><b>SAMPLE</b> <b>CONFIGURATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       This first example is of a the simplest invocation of  FvwmIconMan,  which  only  has  one  manager,  and
       handles all windows:

</pre><h4><b>UNFINISHED</b> <b>BUSINESS</b></h4><pre>
       There is one bug that I know of. A honest to goodness solution to this would be appreciated. When an icon
       manager is set to grow upwards or leftwards, on some machines it may wander occasionally.

       It doesn't handle windows without resource names as gracefully as it should.
