       pidproxy - Supervisor pidproxy Documentation

       Supervisor  is  a client/server system that allows its users to monitor and control a number of processes
       on UNIX-like operating systems.

       It shares some of the same goals of programs like launchd, daemontools, and runit. Unlike some  of  these
       programs, it is not meant to be run as a substitute for <b>init</b> as "process id 1". Instead it is meant to be
       used  to  control  processes  related  to  a  project or a customer, and is meant to start like any other
       program at boot time.

</pre><h4><b>OVERVIEW</b></h4><pre>
   <b>pidproxy</b> <b>Program</b>
       Some processes (like <b>mysqld</b>) ignore signals sent to the actual process which is spawned  by  <b>supervisord</b>.
       Instead,  a  "special"  thread/process  is  created  by  these kinds of programs which is responsible for
       handling signals.  This is problematic because <b>supervisord</b> can only  kill  a  process  which  it  creates
       itself.   If  a  process  created by <b>supervisord</b> creates its own child processes, <b>supervisord</b> cannot kill
       them.

       Fortunately, these types of programs typically write a "pidfile" which contains  the  "special"  process'
       PID,  and  is  meant  to be read and used in order to kill the process.  As a workaround for this case, a
       special <b>pidproxy</b> program can handle startup of these kinds of processes.  The <b>pidproxy</b> program is a small
       shim that starts a process, and upon the receipt of a signal, sends the signal to the pid provided  in  a
       pidfile.  A sample configuration program entry for a pidproxy-enabled program is provided below.

          [program:mysql]
          command=/path/to/pidproxy /path/to/pidfile /path/to/mysqld_safe

       The  <b>pidproxy</b>  program  is  put  into  your configuration's <b>$BINDIR</b> when supervisor is installed (it is a
       "console script").
