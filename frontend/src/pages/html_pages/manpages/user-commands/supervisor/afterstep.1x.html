              AfterStep  has  been  almost entirely rewritten in this new incarnation. Here is the short list of
              new architectural changes:

              1.1. New high performance and high quality image handling engine has been developed to fulfill GUI
              needs. It includes different image transformations, such as scaling, tiling,  cropping,  blurring,
              blending of arbitrary number of layers, in-memory image compression, support for 12 different file
              formats,  including  its  own  parser/writer  of  XPM  files,  capable  of  achieving  much better
              performance then default libXpm. Supported image formats are :

              XPM, PNG, JPEG, XCF(GIMP image format), PPM, PNM, BMP, ICO, CUR, GIF, TIFF, and XML scripts. Where
              XML scripts allow for user to create script of transformations to be performed on the image at the
              time when it gets loaded./para&gt;  libAfterImage  also  provides  support  for  TTF  fonts  (  using
              libfreetype ) and smoothed standard X raster fonts.

              1.2.  Window  hints handling has been rewritten and reorganized, and most of the Extended WM specs
              has been incorporated, as well, as better support for Motif, ICCCM and old GNOME  hints  has  been
              implemented.

              1.3. All the GUI rendering code has been aggregated into libAfterStep and now all the GUI elements
              are  rendered  using  consistent  approach in every module and every part of the AfterStep proper.
              From now on interface is build from so  called  TBars.  TBar  is  rectangular  area  that  may  be
              focused(hilited) or unfocused and pressed or unpressed. Each TBar has the following structure :

              -  the  background  of  the TBar, which is defined by MyStyle and state of the bar - there are two
              MyStyles assigned to each TBar - one for focused and one for unfocused state.

              - tiles of the TBar. Tiles are smaller features that gets arranged inside the bar according to its
              size, alignment, position and order. Tiles could be static icons ( cannot be pressed ); blocks  of
              buttons - each having two shapes - pressed and normal; Text labels; Empty space tiles.

              There  could  be  up  to 256 tiles, each residing on one of the cells in 16x16 grid. Several tiles
              could reside in single cell, in which case they get superimposed on top of each other.

              - bevel of the TBar. When TBar is rendered all of  its  tiles  are  superimposed  on  top  of  its
              background,  and  resulting image will have a 3D bevel drawn on it, using colors from same MyStyle
              as  used  for  background.  Bevel  could  be  switched  off  partially  or  entirely.   Respective
              configuration  options  has  been  added  where  appropriate.  When TBar is pressed - its bevel is
              inverted.

              When TBar is rendered all of its elements gets superimposed on top of each other using one  of  13
              blending  methods supported by libAfterImage, with default being simple alphablending. See MyFrame
              configuration for more details. This is refrred to as "Composition Method".

              1.4. Due to the fact that AfterStep is using compression to store images in memory - there  is  no
              need to have separate root background handler, and so asetroot has been discontinued and afterstep
              proper  now  does  all  the root background loading. You could simply copy-and-paste your asteroot
              config into your look file. This has an added advantage  of  simplifing  theme  support  for  root
              backgrounds.

              1.5.  Significant  work has been done to create libAfterConf which provides easy means for reading
              configuration options, and facilitates implementation of any configuration tool.

              1.6. Some work has been done to improve support for themes. AfterStep proper and modules now  load
              configuration files is this order :

              #1 - base config; #2 - look, feel, menu, database, autoexec and module specific config; #3 - theme
              file; #4 - theme override file;

              Theme  override  file  is needed so that user may have a list of critical options that he/she does
              not want to be changed by any theme. What is missing here is a comprehensive theme building tool.

              1.7. AfterStep now make extensive use of X shaped extensions ( where available ) Everything  could
              be  shaped  now  -  titlebars,  Pager,  Wharf,  etc.  To  make  some element shaped - MyStyle with
              BackPixmap type 125 or 126 should be used.

              1.8. Menus are now treated same as regular windows. They could  be  configured  in  database  file
              using  preset  Style  "ASMenu"  to have different titlebar buttons, frame decorations, stickiness,
              etc. MenuPinOn has been changed to be just another titlebar button, with PinMenu function assigned
              to it.

              1.9. AfterStep no longer uses fixed scheme of 5 titlebar  buttons  on  each  side,  and  order  of
              buttons  could  be  configured  in look. There is still limitation to have no more then 10 buttons
              total.
