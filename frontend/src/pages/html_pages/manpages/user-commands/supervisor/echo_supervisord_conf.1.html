       echo_supervisord_conf - Supervisor Configuration Documentation

       Supervisor  is  a client/server system that allows its users to monitor and control a number of processes
       on UNIX-like operating systems.

       It shares some of the same goals of programs like launchd, daemontools, and runit. Unlike some  of  these
       programs, it is not meant to be run as a substitute for <b>init</b> as "process id 1". Instead it is meant to be
       used  to  control  processes  related  to  a  project or a customer, and is meant to start like any other
       program at boot time.

</pre><h4><b>DOCUMENTATION</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Creating</b> <b>a</b> <b>Configuration</b> <b>File</b>
       Once the Supervisor installation has completed, run <b>echo_supervisord_conf</b>.  This will  print  a  "sample"
       Supervisor configuration file to your terminal's stdout.

       Once  you  see  the  file  echoed  to  your  terminal,  reinvoke  the  command as <b>echo_supervisord_conf</b> <b>&gt;</b>
       <b>/etc/supervisord.conf</b>. This won't work if you do not have root access.

       If  you  don't  have  root  access,  or   you'd   rather   not   put   the   <b>supervisord.conf</b>   file   in
       <b>/etc/supervisord.conf`</b>,   you   can   place   it   in  the  current  directory  (<b>echo_supervisord_conf</b>  <b>&gt;</b>
       <b>supervisord.conf</b>) and start <b>supervisord</b> with the <b>-c</b> flag in  order  to  specify  the  configuration  file
       location.

       For  example,  <b>supervisord</b>  <b>-c</b>  <b>supervisord.conf</b>.   Using the <b>-c</b> flag actually is redundant in this case,
       because <b>supervisord</b> searches the current directory for a <b>supervisord.conf</b> before it  searches  any  other
       locations for the file, but it will work.

       Once you have a configuration file on your filesystem, you can begin modifying it to your liking.

   <b>Configuration</b> <b>File</b>
       The  Supervisor  configuration  file  is  conventionally  named  <b>supervisord.conf</b>.   It  is  used by both
       <b>supervisord</b> and <b>supervisorctl</b>.  If either application is started without the <b>-c</b> option (the option  which
       is  used  to tell the application the configuration filename explicitly), the application will look for a
       file named <b>supervisord.conf</b> within the following locations, in the specified  order.   It  will  use  the
       first file it finds.

       1. <b>$CWD/supervisord.conf</b>

       2. <b>$CWD/etc/supervisord.conf</b>

       3. <b>/etc/supervisord.conf</b>

       4. <b>../etc/supervisord.conf</b> (Relative to the executable)

       5. <b>../supervisord.conf</b> (Relative to the executable)

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          Some distributions have packaged Supervisor with their own customizations.  These modified versions of
          Supervisor  may  load the configuration file from locations other than those described here.  Notably,
          Ubuntu packages have been found that use <b>/etc/supervisor/supervisord.conf</b>.

   <b>File</b> <b>Format</b>
       <b>supervisord.conf</b> is a Windows-INI-style (Python ConfigParser) file.  It has sections (each denoted  by  a
       <b>[header]</b>)  and  key  /  value  pairs  within  the  sections.  The sections and their allowable values are
       described below.

   <b>Environment</b> <b>Variables</b>
       Environment variables that are present in the environment at the time that <b>supervisord</b> is started can  be
       used in the configuration file using the Python string expression syntax <b>%(ENV_X)s</b>:

          [program:example]
          command=/usr/bin/example --loglevel=%(ENV_LOGLEVEL)s

       In  the  example above, the expression <b>%(ENV_LOGLEVEL)s</b> would be expanded to the value of the environment
       variable <b>LOGLEVEL</b>.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          In Supervisor 3.2 and later, <b>%(ENV_X)s</b> expressions are supported in all options.  In  prior  versions,
          some options support them, but most do not.  See the documentation for each option below.

   <b>[unix_http_server]</b> <b>Section</b> <b>Settings</b>
       The  <b>supervisord.conf</b>  file  contains  a  section  named  <b>[unix_http_server]</b>  under  which  configuration
       parameters for an HTTP server that  listens  on  a  UNIX  domain  socket  should  be  inserted.   If  the
       configuration  file  has  no  <b>[unix_http_server]</b>  section,  a  UNIX domain socket HTTP server will not be
       started.  The allowable configuration values are as follows.

   <b>[unix_http_server]</b> <b>Section</b> <b>Values</b>
       <b>file</b>
          A path to a UNIX domain socket (e.g.  <b>/tmp/supervisord.sock</b>)  on  which  supervisor  will  listen  for
          HTTP/XML-RPC  requests.   <b>supervisorctl</b>  uses  XML-RPC to communicate with <b>supervisord</b> over this port.
          This option can include the value <b>%(here)s</b>, which expands to the directory in  which  the  <b>supervisord</b>
          configuration file was found.

          <u>Default</u>:  None.

          <u>Required</u>:  No.

          <u>Introduced</u>: 3.0

       <b>chmod</b>
          Change the UNIX permission mode bits of the UNIX domain socket to this value at startup.

          <u>Default</u>: <b>0700</b>

          <u>Required</u>:  No.

          <u>Introduced</u>: 3.0

       <b>chown</b>
          Change the user and group of the socket file to this value.  May be a UNIX username (e.g. <b>chrism</b>) or a
          UNIX username and group separated by a colon (e.g. <b>chrism:wheel</b>).

          <u>Default</u>:  Use the username and group of the user who starts supervisord.

          <u>Required</u>:  No.

          <u>Introduced</u>: 3.0

       <b>username</b>
          The username required for authentication to this HTTP server.

          <u>Introduced</u>: 3.0

       <b>password</b>
          The  password  required  for authentication to this HTTP server.  This can be a cleartext password, or
          can  be  specified  as  a  SHA-1   hash   if   prefixed   by   the   string   <b>{SHA}</b>.    For   example,
          <b>{SHA}82ab876d1387bfafe46cc1c8a2ef074eae50cb1d</b> is the SHA-stored version of the password "thepassword".

          Note that hashed password must be in hex format.

          <u>Default</u>:  No password required.

          <u>Required</u>:  No.

          <u>Introduced</u>: 3.0

   <b>[unix_http_server]</b> <b>Section</b> <b>Example</b>

          file = /tmp/supervisor.sock
          chmod = 0777
          chown= nobody:nogroup
          username = user
          password = 123

   <b>[inet_http_server]</b> <b>Section</b> <b>Settings</b>
       The  <b>supervisord.conf</b>  file  contains  a  section  named  <b>[inet_http_server]</b>  under  which  configuration
       parameters for an HTTP server that listens on a  TCP  (internet)  socket  should  be  inserted.   If  the
       configuration  file  has  no  <b>[inet_http_server]</b>  section,  an inet HTTP server will not be started.  The
       allowable configuration values are as follows.

   <b>[inet_http_server]</b> <b>Section</b> <b>Values</b>
       <b>port</b>
          A TCP host:port value or (e.g. <b>127.0.0.1:9001</b>)  on  which  supervisor  will  listen  for  HTTP/XML-RPC
          requests.   <b>supervisorctl</b>  will use XML-RPC to communicate with <b>supervisord</b> over this port.  To listen
          on all interfaces in the machine, use <b>:9001</b> or <b>*:9001</b>.

          <u>Default</u>:  No default.

          <u>Required</u>:  Yes.

          <u>Introduced</u>: 3.0

       <b>username</b>

          <u>Introduced</u>: 3.0

       <b>password</b>
          The password required for authentication to this HTTP server.  This can be a  cleartext  password,  or
          can   be   specified   as   a   SHA-1   hash   if   prefixed   by  the  string  <b>{SHA}</b>.   For  example,
          <b>{SHA}82ab876d1387bfafe46cc1c8a2ef074eae50cb1d</b> is the SHA-stored version of the password "thepassword".

          Note that hashed password must be in hex format.

          <u>Default</u>:  No password required.

          <u>Required</u>:  No.

          <u>Introduced</u>: 3.0

   <b>[inet_http_server]</b> <b>Section</b> <b>Example</b>
          [inet_http_server]
          port = 127.0.0.1:9001
          username = user
          password = 123

   <b>[supervisord]</b> <b>Section</b> <b>Settings</b>
       The <b>supervisord.conf</b> file contains a section named <b>[supervisord]</b> in which global settings related to  the
       <b>supervisord</b> process should be inserted.  These are as follows.

   <b>[supervisord]</b> <b>Section</b> <b>Values</b>
       <b>logfile</b>
          The  path to the activity log of the supervisord process.  This option can include the value <b>%(here)s</b>,
          which expands to the directory in which the supervisord configuration file was found.

          <u>Default</u>:  <b>$CWD/supervisord.log</b>

          <u>Required</u>:  No.

          <u>Introduced</u>: 3.0

       <b>logfile_maxbytes</b>
          The maximum number of bytes that may be consumed by the activity log file before it is rotated (suffix
          multipliers like "KB", "MB", and "GB" can be used in the value).  Set this value to 0 to  indicate  an
          unlimited log size.

          <u>Default</u>:  50MB

          <u>Required</u>:  No.

          <u>Introduced</u>: 3.0

       <b>logfile_backups</b>
          The  number  of  backups  to  keep  around resulting from activity log file rotation.  If set to 0, no
          backups will be kept.

          <u>Default</u>:  10

          <u>Required</u>:  No.

          <u>Introduced</u>: 3.0

       <b>loglevel</b>
          The logging level, dictating what is written to the supervisord activity log.  One of <b>critical</b>, <b>error</b>,
          <b>warn</b>, <b>info</b>, <b>debug</b>, <b>trace</b>, or <b>blather</b>.  Note that at log level <b>debug</b>, the  supervisord  log  file  will
          record  the  stderr/stdout  output  of  its child processes and extended info info about process state
          changes, which  is  useful  for  debugging  a  process  which  isn't  starting  properly.   See  also:
          activity_log_levels.

          <u>Default</u>:  info

          <u>Required</u>:  No.

          <u>Introduced</u>: 3.0

       <b>pidfile</b>
          The  location  in  which  supervisord keeps its pid file.  This option can include the value <b>%(here)s</b>,
          which expands to the directory in which the supervisord configuration file was found.

          <u>Default</u>:  <b>$CWD/supervisord.pid</b>

          <u>Required</u>:  No.

          <u>Introduced</u>: 3.0

       <b>umask</b>
          The umask of the supervisord process.

          <u>Default</u>:  <b>022</b>

          <u>Required</u>:  No.

          <u>Introduced</u>: 3.0

       <b>nodaemon</b>
          If true, supervisord will start in the foreground instead of daemonizing.

          <u>Default</u>:  false

          <u>Required</u>:  No.

          <u>Introduced</u>: 3.0

       <b>minfds</b>
          The minimum number  of  file  descriptors  that  must  be  available  before  supervisord  will  start
          successfully.   A  call  to setrlimit will be made to attempt to raise the soft and hard limits of the
          supervisord process to satisfy <b>minfds</b>.  The hard limit may only be raised if  supervisord  is  run  as
          root.   supervisord  uses file descriptors liberally, and will enter a failure mode when one cannot be
          obtained from the OS, so it's useful to be able to specify a minimum value to ensure  it  doesn't  run
          out  of  them  during  execution.  This  option  is  particularly  useful  on Solaris, which has a low
          per-process fd limit by default.

          <u>Default</u>:  1024

          <u>Required</u>:  No.

          <u>Introduced</u>: 3.0

       <b>minprocs</b>
          The minimum number of process descriptors  that  must  be  available  before  supervisord  will  start
          successfully.   A  call  to setrlimit will be made to attempt to raise the soft and hard limits of the
          supervisord process to satisfy <b>minprocs</b>.  The hard limit may only be raised if supervisord is  run  as
          root.   supervisord  will  enter  a  failure mode when the OS runs out of process descriptors, so it's
          useful to ensure that enough process descriptors are available upon <b>supervisord</b> startup.

          <u>Default</u>:  200

          <u>Required</u>:  No.

          <u>Introduced</u>: 3.0

       <b>nocleanup</b>
          Prevent supervisord from clearing any existing <b>AUTO</b> child log  files  at  startup  time.   Useful  for
          debugging.

          <u>Default</u>:  false

          <u>Required</u>:  No.

          <u>Introduced</u>: 3.0

       <b>childlogdir</b>
          The  directory  used  for  <b>AUTO</b>  child  log  files.  This option can include the value <b>%(here)s</b>, which
          expands to the directory in which the <b>supervisord</b> configuration file was found.

          <u>Default</u>: value of Python's <b>tempfile.get_tempdir()</b>

          <u>Required</u>:  No.

          <u>Introduced</u>: 3.0

       <b>user</b>
          Instruct <b>supervisord</b> to switch users to this UNIX user account before doing any meaningful processing.
          The user can only be switched if <b>supervisord</b> is started as the root user.  If <b>supervisord</b> can't switch
          users, it will still continue but will write a log message at the <b>critical</b> level saying that it  can't
          drop privileges.

          <u>Default</u>: do not switch users

          <u>Required</u>:  No.

          <u>Introduced</u>: 3.0

       <b>directory</b>
          When  <b>supervisord</b>  daemonizes,  switch to this directory.  This option can include the value <b>%(here)s</b>,
          which expands to the directory in which the <b>supervisord</b> configuration file was found.

          <u>Default</u>: do not cd

          <u>Required</u>:  No.

          <u>Introduced</u>: 3.0

       <b>strip_ansi</b>
          Strip all ANSI escape sequences from child log files.

          <u>Default</u>: false

          <u>Required</u>:  No.

          <u>Introduced</u>: 3.0

       <b>environment</b>
          A list of key/value pairs in the form <b>KEY="val",KEY2="val2"</b> that will be  placed  in  the  <b>supervisord</b>
          process'  environment  (and  as  a result in all of its child process' environments).  This option can
          include the value <b>%(here)s</b>, which expands to the directory in which the supervisord configuration file
          was   found.    Values   containing   non-alphanumeric   characters    should    be    quoted    (e.g.
          <b>KEY="val:123",KEY2="val,456"</b>).   Otherwise, quoting the values is optional but recommended.  To escape
          percent characters, simply use two. (e.g. <b>URI="/first%%20name"</b>) <b>Note</b> that  subprocesses  will  inherit
          the  environment  variables of the shell used to start <b>supervisord</b> except for the ones overridden here
          and within the program's <b>environment</b> option.  See subprocess_environment.

          <u>Default</u>: no values

          <u>Required</u>:  No.

          <u>Introduced</u>: 3.0

       <b>identifier</b>
          The identifier string for this supervisor process, used by the RPC interface.

          <u>Default</u>: supervisor

   <b>[supervisorctl]</b> <b>Section</b> <b>Settings</b>
          The configuration file may contain settings for the <b>supervisorctl</b> interactive  shell  program.   These
          options are listed below.

   <b>[supervisorctl]</b> <b>Section</b> <b>Values</b>
       <b>serverurl</b>
          The  URL  that  should be used to access the supervisord server, e.g. <b><a href="http://localhost">http://localhost</a>:9001</b>.  For UNIX
          domain sockets, use <b>unix:///absolute/path/to/file.sock</b>.

          <u>Default</u>: <b><a href="http://localhost">http://localhost</a>:9001</b>

          <u>Required</u>:  No.

          <u>Introduced</u>: 3.0

       <b>username</b>
          The username to pass to the supervisord server for use in authentication.   This  should  be  same  as
          <b>username</b>  from  the  supervisord  server  configuration  for  the  port  or  UNIX domain socket you're
          attempting to access.

          <u>Default</u>: No username

          <u>Required</u>:  No.

          <u>Introduced</u>: 3.0

       <b>password</b>
          The password to pass to the supervisord server for use in authentication. This should be the cleartext
          version of <b>password</b> from the supervisord server configuration for  the  port  or  UNIX  domain  socket
          you're  attempting  to  access.   This  value  cannot be passed as a SHA hash.  Unlike other passwords
          specified in this file, it must be provided in cleartext.

          <u>Default</u>: No password

          <u>Required</u>:  No.

          <u>Introduced</u>: 3.0

       <b>prompt</b>
          String used as supervisorctl prompt.

          <u>Default</u>: <b>supervisor</b>

          <u>Required</u>:  No.

          <u>Introduced</u>: 3.0

       <b>history_file</b>
          A path to use as the <b>readline</b> persistent history file.  If you enable this feature by choosing a path,
          your supervisorctl commands will be kept in the file, and you can  use  readline  (e.g.  arrow-up)  to
          invoke commands you performed in your last supervisorctl session.

          <u>Default</u>: No file

          <u>Required</u>:  No.

          <u>Introduced</u>: 3.0a5

          prompt = mysupervisor

   <b>[program:x]</b> <b>Section</b> <b>Settings</b>
       The  configuration  file must contain one or more <b>program</b> sections in order for supervisord to know which
       programs it should start and control.  The header value is composite value.  It is  the  word  "program",
       followed directly by a colon, then the program name.  A header value of <b>[program:foo]</b> describes a program
       with  the name of "foo".  The name is used within client applications that control the processes that are
       created as a result of this configuration.  It is an error to create a <b>program</b> section that does not have
       a name.  The name must not include a colon character or a bracket character.  The value of  the  name  is
       used  as  the  value  for  the  <b>%(program_name)s</b>  string  expression  expansion within other values where
       specified.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          A <b>[program:x]</b> section actually represents a "homogeneous process group" to  supervisor  (as  of  3.0).
          The members of the group are defined by the combination of the <b>numprocs</b> and <b>process_name</b> parameters in
          the  configuration.   By default, if numprocs and process_name are left unchanged from their defaults,
          the group represented by <b>[program:x]</b> will be named <b>x</b> and will have a single process  named  <b>x</b>  in  it.
          This provides a modicum of backwards compatibility with older supervisor releases, which did not treat
          program sections as homogeneous process group definitions.

          But  for  instance,  if  you  have  a  <b>[program:foo]</b>  section  with a <b>numprocs</b> of 3 and a <b>process_name</b>
          expression of <b>%(program_name)s_%(process_num)02d</b>, the "foo" group will contain three processes,  named
          <b>foo_00</b>,  <b>foo_01</b>, and <b>foo_02</b>.  This makes it possible to start a number of very similar processes using
          a single <b>[program:x]</b> section.  All logfile names, all environment strings, and the command of programs
          can also contain similar Python string expressions, to pass  slightly  different  parameters  to  each
          process.

   <b>[program:x]</b> <b>Section</b> <b>Values</b>
       <b>command</b>
          The  command  that will be run when this program is started.  The command can be either absolute (e.g.
          <b>/path/to/programname</b>)  or  relative  (e.g.  <b>programname</b>).   If  it  is  relative,  the   supervisord's
          environment  <b>$PATH</b>  will  be  searched  for  the  executable.   Programs  can  accept  arguments, e.g.
          <b>/path/to/program</b> <b>foo</b> <b>bar</b>.  The command line can use double quotes to group arguments  with  spaces  in
          them  to pass to the program, e.g. <b>/path/to/program/name</b> <b>-p</b> <b>"foo</b> <b>bar"</b>.  Note that the value of <b>command</b>
          may include Python string  expressions,  e.g.  <b>/path/to/programname</b>  <b>--port=80%(process_num)02d</b>  might
          expand  to  <b>/path/to/programname</b>  <b>--port=8000</b>  at runtime.  String expressions are evaluated against a
          dictionary containing the  keys  <b>group_name</b>,  <b>host_node_name</b>,  <b>process_num</b>,  <b>program_name</b>,  <b>here</b>  (the
          directory  of  the supervisord config file), and all supervisord's environment variables prefixed with
          <b>ENV_</b>.  Controlled programs should themselves not be daemons, as supervisord assumes it is  responsible
          for daemonizing its subprocesses (see nondaemonizing_of_subprocesses).

          <u>Default</u>: No default.

          <u>Required</u>:  Yes.

          <u>Introduced</u>: 3.0

       <b>process_name</b>
          A  Python string expression that is used to compose the supervisor process name for this process.  You
          usually don't need to worry about setting this unless you change <b>numprocs</b>.  The string  expression  is
          evaluated  against  a  dictionary that includes <b>group_name</b>, <b>host_node_name</b>, <b>process_num</b>, <b>program_name</b>,
          and <b>here</b> (the directory of the supervisord config file).

          <u>Default</u>: <b>%(program_name)s</b>

          <u>Required</u>:  No.

          <u>Introduced</u>: 3.0

       <b>numprocs</b>
          Supervisor will start as many instances of this program as named by numprocs.  Note that if numprocs &gt;
          1, the <b>process_name</b> expression  must  include  <b>%(process_num)s</b>  (or  any  other  valid  Python  string
          expression that includes <b>process_num</b>) within it.

          <u>Default</u>: 1

          <u>Required</u>:  No.

          <u>Introduced</u>: 3.0

       <b>numprocs_start</b>
          An integer offset that is used to compute the number at which <b>numprocs</b> starts.

          <u>Default</u>: 0

          <u>Required</u>:  No.

          <u>Introduced</u>: 3.0

       <b>priority</b>
          The  relative  priority  of the program in the start and shutdown ordering.  Lower priorities indicate
          programs that start first and shut down last at startup  and  when  aggregate  commands  are  used  in
          various  clients  (e.g.  "start all"/"stop all").  Higher priorities indicate programs that start last
          and shut down first.

          <u>Default</u>: 999

          <u>Required</u>:  No.

          <u>Introduced</u>: 3.0

       <b>autostart</b>
          If true, this program will start automatically when supervisord is started.

          <u>Default</u>: true

          <u>Required</u>:  No.

          <u>Introduced</u>: 3.0

       <b>startsecs</b>
          The total number of seconds which the program needs to stay running after a startup  to  consider  the
          start  successful  (moving  the  process  from  the <b>STARTING</b> state to the <b>RUNNING</b> state).  Set to <b>0</b> to
          indicate that the program needn't stay running for any particular amount of time.

          <b>NOTE:</b>
              Even if a process exits with an "expected" exit code (see <b>exitcodes</b>),  the  start  will  still  be
              considered a failure if the process exits quicker than <b>startsecs</b>.

          <u>Default</u>: 1

          <u>Required</u>:  No.

          <u>Introduced</u>: 3.0

       <b>startretries</b>
          The number of serial failure attempts that <b>supervisord</b> will allow when attempting to start the program
          before  giving  up and putting the process into an <b>FATAL</b> state.  See process_states for explanation of
          the <b>FATAL</b> state.

          <u>Default</u>: 3

          <u>Required</u>:  No.

          <u>Introduced</u>: 3.0

       <b>autorestart</b>
          Specifies if <b>supervisord</b> should automatically restart a process if it exits when it is in the  <b>RUNNING</b>
          state.   May  be  one of <b>false</b>, <b>unexpected</b>, or <b>true</b>.  If <b>false</b>, the process will not be autorestarted.
          If <b>unexpected</b>, the process will be restarted when the program exits with an exit code that is not  one
          of  the  exit codes associated with this process' configuration (see <b>exitcodes</b>).  If <b>true</b>, the process
          will be unconditionally restarted when it exits, without regard to its exit code.

          <b>NOTE:</b>
              <b>autorestart</b> controls whether <b>supervisord</b> will autorestart a program  if  it  exits  after  it  has
              successfully started up (the process is in the <b>RUNNING</b> state).

              <b>supervisord</b>  has a different restart mechanism for when the process is starting up (the process is
              in the  <b>STARTING</b>  state).   Retries  during  process  startup  are  controlled  by  <b>startsecs</b>  and
              <b>startretries</b>.

          <u>Default</u>: unexpected

          <u>Required</u>:  No.

          <u>Introduced</u>: 3.0

       <b>exitcodes</b>
          The  list  of  "expected"  exit  codes  for  this  program  used with <b>autorestart</b>.  If the <b>autorestart</b>
          parameter is set to <b>unexpected</b>, and the process exits  in  any  other  way  than  as  a  result  of  a
          supervisor  stop  request,  <b>supervisord</b> will restart the process if it exits with an exit code that is
          not defined in this list.

          <u>Default</u>: 0,2

          <u>Required</u>:  No.

          <u>Introduced</u>: 3.0

       <b>stopsignal</b>
          The signal used to kill the program when a stop is requested.  This can be  any  of  TERM,  HUP,  INT,
          QUIT, KILL, USR1, or USR2.

          <u>Default</u>: TERM

          <u>Required</u>:  No.

          <u>Introduced</u>: 3.0

       <b>stopwaitsecs</b>
          The  number  of  seconds  to wait for the OS to return a SIGCHILD to <b>supervisord</b> after the program has
          been sent a stopsignal.  If this number of seconds elapses before <b>supervisord</b> receives a SIGCHILD from
          the process, <b>supervisord</b> will attempt to kill it with a final SIGKILL.

          <u>Default</u>: 10

          <u>Required</u>:  No.

          <u>Introduced</u>: 3.0

       <b>stopasgroup</b>
          If true, the flag causes supervisor to send the stop signal to the whole  process  group  and  implies
          <b>killasgroup</b>  is true.  This is useful for programs, such as Flask in debug mode, that do not propagate
          stop signals to their children, leaving them orphaned.

          <u>Default</u>: false

          <u>Required</u>:  No.

          <u>Introduced</u>: 3.0b1

       <b>killasgroup</b>
          If true, when resorting to send SIGKILL to the program to terminate it send it to  its  whole  process
          group  instead,  taking  care  of  its  children  as  well,  useful  e.g  with  Python  programs using
          <b>multiprocessing</b>.

          <u>Default</u>: false

          <u>Required</u>:  No.

          <u>Introduced</u>: 3.0a11

       <b>user</b>
          Instruct <b>supervisord</b> to use this UNIX user account as the account which runs the  program.   The  user
          can  only  be  switched  if  <b>supervisord</b>  is run as the root user.  If <b>supervisord</b> can't switch to the
          specified user, the program will not be started.

          <b>NOTE:</b>
              The user will be changed using <b>setuid</b> only.  This does not start a login shell and does not change
              environment variables like <b>USER</b> or <b>HOME</b>.  See subprocess_environment for details.

          <u>Default</u>: Do not switch users

          <u>Required</u>:  No.

          <u>Introduced</u>: 3.0

       <b>redirect_stderr</b>
          If true, cause the process' stderr output to be sent back to <b>supervisord</b> on its stdout file descriptor
          (in UNIX shell terms, this is the equivalent of executing <b>/the/program</b> <b>2&gt;&amp;1</b>).

          <b>NOTE:</b>
              Do not set <b>redirect_stderr=true</b> in an <b>[eventlistener:x]</b> section.  Eventlisteners  use  <b>stdout</b>  and
              <b>stdin</b> to communicate with <b>supervisord</b>.  If <b>stderr</b> is redirected, output from <b>stderr</b> will interfere
              with the eventlistener protocol.

          <u>Default</u>: false

          <u>Required</u>:  No.

          <u>Introduced</u>: 3.0, replaces 2.0's <b>log_stdout</b> and <b>log_stderr</b>

       <b>stdout_logfile</b>
          Put  process  stdout  output in this file (and if redirect_stderr is true, also place stderr output in
          this file).  If <b>stdout_logfile</b> is unset or set to <b>AUTO</b>, supervisor will automatically  choose  a  file
          location.   If  this  is  set  to <b>NONE</b>, supervisord will create no log file.  <b>AUTO</b> log files and their
          backups will be deleted when <b>supervisord</b> restarts.  The <b>stdout_logfile</b> value can contain Python string
          expressions  that  will  evaluated  against  a  dictionary  that   contains   the   keys   <b>group_name</b>,
          <b>host_node_name</b>, <b>process_num</b>, <b>program_name</b>, and <b>here</b> (the directory of the supervisord config file).

          <b>NOTE:</b>
              It  is  not  possible  for two processes to share a single log file (<b>stdout_logfile</b>) when rotation
              (<b>stdout_logfile_maxbytes</b>) is enabled.  This will result in the file being corrupted.

          <u>Default</u>: <b>AUTO</b>

          <u>Required</u>:  No.

          <u>Introduced</u>: 3.0, replaces 2.0's <b>logfile</b>

       <b>stdout_logfile_maxbytes</b>
          The maximum number of bytes that may be consumed  by  <b>stdout_logfile</b>  before  it  is  rotated  (suffix
          multipliers  like  "KB", "MB", and "GB" can be used in the value).  Set this value to 0 to indicate an
          unlimited log size.

          <u>Default</u>: 50MB

          <u>Required</u>:  No.

          <u>Introduced</u>: 3.0, replaces 2.0's <b>logfile_maxbytes</b>

       <b>stdout_logfile_backups</b>
          The number of <b>stdout_logfile</b> backups to keep around resulting from process stdout log  file  rotation.
          If set to 0, no backups will be kept.

          <u>Default</u>: 10

          <u>Required</u>:  No.

          <u>Introduced</u>: 3.0, replaces 2.0's <b>logfile_backups</b>

       <b>stdout_capture_maxbytes</b>
          Max  number  of  bytes  written  to  capture  FIFO  when  process  is  in  "stdout  capture mode" (see
          capture_mode).  Should be an integer (suffix multipliers like "KB", "MB" and  "GB"  can  used  in  the
          value).  If this value is 0, process capture mode will be off.

          <u>Default</u>: 0

          <u>Required</u>:  No.

          <u>Introduced</u>: 3.0, replaces 2.0's <b>logfile_backups</b>

       <b>stdout_events_enabled</b>
          If  true,  PROCESS_LOG_STDOUT  events  will  be  emitted  when  the  process writes to its stdout file
          descriptor.  The events will only be emitted if the file descriptor is not in capture mode at the time
          the data is received (see capture_mode).

          <u>Default</u>: 0

          <u>Required</u>:  No.

          <u>Introduced</u>: 3.0a7

       <b>stderr_logfile</b>
          Put process stderr output in this file unless <b>redirect_stderr</b> is true.  Accepts the same  value  types
          as <b>stdout_logfile</b> and may contain the same Python string expressions.

          <b>NOTE:</b>
              It  is  not  possible  for two processes to share a single log file (<b>stderr_logfile</b>) when rotation
              (<b>stderr_logfile_maxbytes</b>) is enabled.  This will result in the file being corrupted.

          <u>Required</u>:  No.

          <u>Introduced</u>: 3.0

       <b>stderr_events_enabled</b>
          If  true,  PROCESS_LOG_STDERR  events  will  be  emitted  when  the  process writes to its stderr file
          descriptor.  The events will only be emitted if the file descriptor is not in capture mode at the time

       <b>environment</b>
          A list of key/value pairs in the form <b>KEY="val",KEY2="val2"</b> that will be placed in the child  process'
          environment.   The  environment  string  may  contain Python string expressions that will be evaluated
          against a dictionary containing <b>group_name</b>, <b>host_node_name</b>, <b>process_num</b>, <b>program_name</b>, and  <b>here</b>  (the
          directory  of  the  supervisord config file).  Values containing non-alphanumeric characters should be
          quoted  (e.g.  <b>KEY="val:123",KEY2="val,456"</b>).   Otherwise,  quoting  the  values   is   optional   but
          recommended.   <b>Note</b>  that  the  subprocess will inherit the environment variables of the shell used to
          start "supervisord" except for the ones overridden here.  See subprocess_environment.

          <u>Default</u>: No extra environment

          <u>Required</u>:  No.

          <u>Introduced</u>: 3.0

       <b>directory</b>
          A file path representing a directory to which <b>supervisord</b> should temporarily chdir before exec'ing the

          <u>Default</u>: No chdir (inherit supervisor's)

          <u>Required</u>:  No.

          <u>Introduced</u>: 3.0

       <b>umask</b>
          An octal number (e.g. 002, 022) representing the umask of the process.

          <u>Default</u>: No special umask (inherit supervisor's)

          <u>Required</u>:  No.

          <u>Introduced</u>: 3.0

       <b>serverurl</b>
          The  URL  passed  in  the  environment  to  the  subprocess  process  as  <b>SUPERVISOR_SERVER_URL</b>   (see
          <b>supervisor.childutils</b>)  to  allow  the subprocess to easily communicate with the internal HTTP server.
          If provided, it should have the same syntax and structure as the <b>[supervisorctl]</b> section option of the
          same name.  If this is set to AUTO, or is unset, supervisor will automatically construct a server URL,
          giving preference to a server that listens on UNIX domain sockets over one that listens on an internet
          socket.

          <u>Default</u>: AUTO

   <b>[include]</b> <b>Section</b> <b>Settings</b>
       The <b>supervisord.conf</b> file may contain a section named <b>[include]</b>.  If the configuration file  contains  an
       <b>[include]</b>  section,  it  must  contain  a single key named "files".  The values in this key specify other
       configuration files to be included within the configuration.

   <b>[include]</b> <b>Section</b> <b>Values</b>
       <b>files</b>
          A space-separated sequence of file globs.  Each file glob may be absolute or relative.   If  the  file
          glob  is  relative, it is considered relative to the location of the configuration file which includes
          it.  A "glob" is a file pattern which matches a specified pattern according to the rules used  by  the
          Unix  shell.  No  tilde  expansion  is  done, but <b>*</b>, <b>?</b>, and character ranges expressed with <b>[]</b> will be
          correctly matched.  Recursive includes from included files are not supported.

          <u>Default</u>: No default (required)

   <b>[group:x]</b> <b>Section</b> <b>Settings</b>
       It is often useful to group "homogeneous" process groups (aka "programs") together into a "heterogeneous"
       process group so they can be controlled as a unit from Supervisor's various controller interfaces.

       To place programs into a group so you can treat them as a  unit,  define  a  <b>[group:x]</b>  section  in  your
       configuration file.  The group header value is a composite.  It is the word "group", followed directly by
       a  colon,  then  the group name.  A header value of <b>[group:foo]</b> describes a group with the name of "foo".
       The name is used within client applications that control the processes that are created as  a  result  of
       this  configuration.   It is an error to create a <b>group</b> section that does not have a name.  The name must
       not include a colon character or a bracket character.

       For a <b>[group:x]</b>, there must be one or more <b>[program:x]</b> sections elsewhere in your configuration file, and
       the group must refer to them by name in the <b>programs</b> value.

       If "homogeneous" process groups (represented by program sections) are placed into a "heterogeneous" group
       via <b>[group:x]</b> section's <b>programs</b> line, the homogeneous groups that are implied  by  the  program  section
       will  not  exist  at  runtime in supervisor.  Instead, all processes belonging to each of the homogeneous
       groups  will  be  placed  into  the  heterogeneous  group.   For  example,  given  the  following   group
       configuration:

          [group:foo]
          programs=bar,baz
          priority=999

       Given  the  above,  at  supervisord  startup,  the <b>bar</b> and <b>baz</b> homogeneous groups will not exist, and the
       processes that would have been under them will now be moved into the <b>foo</b> group.

   <b>[group:x]</b> <b>Section</b> <b>Values</b>
       <b>programs</b>
          A comma-separated list of program names.  The programs which are listed become members of the group.

          <u>Default</u>: No default (required)

          <u>Required</u>:  Yes.

          <u>Introduced</u>: 3.0

       <b>priority</b>
          A priority number analogous to a <b>[program:x]</b> priority value assigned to the group.

          <u>Default</u>: 999

          <u>Required</u>:  No.

          <u>Introduced</u>: 3.0

   <b>[group:x]</b> <b>Section</b> <b>Example</b>
          [group:foo]
          programs=bar,baz
          priority=999

   <b>[fcgi-program:x]</b> <b>Section</b> <b>Settings</b>
       Supervisor can manage groups of <u>FastCGI</u> processes that  all  listen  on  the  same  socket.   Until  now,
       deployment  flexibility  for  FastCGI  was  limited.   To  get  full  process  management,  you could use
       mod_fastcgi under Apache but then you were stuck with  Apache's  inefficient  concurrency  model  of  one
       process  or  thread  per  connection.   In  addition  to  requiring  more  CPU  and memory resources, the
       process/thread per connection model can be  quickly  saturated  by  a  slow  resource,  preventing  other
       resources  from  being  served.   In  order  to  take advantage of newer event-driven web servers such as
       lighttpd or nginx which don't include a built-in process manager, you had to use scripts like cgi-fcgi or
       spawn-fcgi.  These can be used in conjunction with a process manager such as supervisord  or  daemontools
       but  require  each  FastCGI  child  process  to  bind  to its own socket.  The disadvantages of this are:
       unnecessarily complicated web server configuration, ungraceful restarts,  and  reduced  fault  tolerance.
       With  fewer  sockets  to  configure,  web  server  configurations  are  much smaller if groups of FastCGI
       processes can share sockets.  Shared sockets allow for graceful restarts because the socket remains bound
       by the parent process while any of the child processes are being restarted.  Finally, shared sockets  are
       more  fault  tolerant  because  if  a  given process fails, other processes can continue to serve inbound
       connections.

       With integrated FastCGI spawning support, Supervisor  gives  you  the  best  of  both  worlds.   You  get
       full-featured process management with groups of FastCGI processes sharing sockets without being tied to a
       particular  web  server.   It's  a  clean separation of concerns, allowing the web server and the process
       manager to each do what they do best.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          The socket manager in Supervisor was originally developed to support FastCGI processes but it  is  not
          limited  to  FastCGI.  Other protocols may be used as well with no special configuration.  Any program
          that can access an open socket from a file descriptor (e.g. with <u>socket.fromfd</u> in Python) can use  the
          socket  manager.  Supervisor will automatically create the socket, bind, and listen before forking the
          first child in a group.  The socket will be passed to each child on file descriptor number  <b>0</b>  (zero).
          When the last child in the group exits, Supervisor will close the socket.

       All the options available to <b>[program:x]</b> sections are also respected by <b>fcgi-program</b> sections.

   <b>[fcgi-program:x]</b> <b>Section</b> <b>Values</b>
       <b>[fcgi-program:x]</b> sections have a single key which <b>[program:x]</b> sections do not have.

       <b>socket</b>
          The  FastCGI  socket  for  this  program,  either TCP or UNIX domain socket. For TCP sockets, use this
          format:  <b>tcp://localhost:9002</b>.   For  UNIX  domain  sockets,  use  <b>unix:///absolute/path/to/file.sock</b>.
          String  expressions  are  evaluated against a dictionary containing the keys "program_name" and "here"
          (the directory of the supervisord config file).

          <u>Default</u>: No default.

          <u>Required</u>:  Yes.

          <u>Introduced</u>: 3.0

       <b>socket_owner</b>
          For UNIX domain sockets, this parameter can be used to specify the user  and  group  for  the  FastCGI
          socket.  May  be a UNIX username (e.g. chrism) or a UNIX username and group separated by a colon (e.g.
          chrism:wheel).

          <u>Default</u>: Uses the user and group set for the fcgi-program

          <u>Required</u>:  No.

          <u>Introduced</u>: 3.0

       <b>socket_mode</b>
          For UNIX domain sockets, this parameter can be used to specify the permission mode.

          <u>Default</u>: 0700

          <u>Required</u>:  No.

   <b>[eventlistener:x]</b> <b>Section</b> <b>Settings</b>
       Supervisor allows specialized homogeneous process groups ("event listener pools") to  be  defined  within
       the  configuration  file.   These  pools contain processes that are meant to receive and respond to event
       notifications from supervisor's event system.  See events for an explanation of how events work  and  how
       to implement programs that can be declared as event listeners.

       Note  that  all  the  options  available  to <b>[program:x]</b> sections are respected by eventlistener sections
       <u>except</u> for <b>stdout_capture_maxbytes</b> and  <b>stderr_capture_maxbytes</b>  (event  listeners  cannot  emit  process
       communication events, see capture_mode).

   <b>[eventlistener:x]</b> <b>Section</b> <b>Values</b>
       <b>[eventlistener:x]</b> sections have a few keys which <b>[program:x]</b> sections do not have.

       <b>buffer_size</b>
          The  event listener pool's event queue buffer size.  When a listener pool's event buffer is overflowed
          (as can happen when an event listener pool cannot keep up with all of the  events  sent  to  it),  the
          oldest event in the buffer is discarded.

       <b>events</b>
          A  comma-separated  list  of  event  type  names  that  this  listener  is  "interested"  in receiving
          notifications for (see event_types for a list of valid event type names).

       <b>result_handler</b>
          A <u>pkg_resources</u> <u>entry</u> <u>point</u> <u>string</u>  that  resolves  to  a  Python  callable.   The  default  value  is
          <b>supervisor.dispatchers:default_handler</b>.   Specifying  an  alternate  result handler is a very uncommon
          thing to need to do, and as a result, how to create one is not documented.

   <b>[rpcinterface:x]</b> <b>Section</b> <b>Settings</b>
       Adding <b>rpcinterface:x</b> settings in the configuration file is only useful for people  who  wish  to  extend
       supervisor with additional custom behavior.

       In  the  sample  config file, there is a section which is named <b>[rpcinterface:supervisor]</b>.  By default it
       looks like the following.

          [rpcinterface:supervisor]
          supervisor.rpcinterface_factory = supervisor.rpcinterface:make_main_rpcinterface

       The <b>[rpcinterface:supervisor]</b> section <u>must</u>  remain  in  the  configuration  for  the  standard  setup  of
       supervisor  to  work  properly.  If you don't want supervisor to do anything it doesn't already do out of
       the box, this is all you need to know about this type of section.

       However, if you wish to add rpc interface namespaces in  order  to  customize  supervisor,  you  may  add
       additional  <b>[rpcinterface:foo]</b>  sections, where "foo" represents the namespace of the interface (from the
       web root), and the value named by <b>supervisor.rpcinterface_factory</b> is a factory callable which should have
       a function signature that accepts a single positional argument <b>supervisord</b> and as many keyword  arguments
       as  required  to  perform  configuration.   Any extra key/value pairs defined within the <b>[rpcinterface:x]</b>
       section will be passed as keyword arguments to the factory.

       Here's an example of a  factory  function,  created  in  the  <b>__init__.py</b>  file  of  the  Python  package
       <b>my.package</b>.

          from my.package.rpcinterface import AnotherRPCInterface

          def make_another_rpcinterface(supervisord, **config):
              retries = int(config.get('retries', 0))
              another_rpc_interface = AnotherRPCInterface(supervisord, retries)
              return another_rpc_interface

       And a section in the config file meant to configure it.

          [rpcinterface:another]
          supervisor.rpcinterface_factory = my.package:make_another_rpcinterface
          retries = 1

   <b>[rpcinterface:x]</b> <b>Section</b> <b>Values</b>
       <b>supervisor.rpcinterface_factory</b>
          <b>pkg_resources</b> "entry point" dotted name to your RPC interface's factory function.

          <u>Default</u>: N/A

          <u>Required</u>:  No.

          <u>Introduced</u>: 3.0
