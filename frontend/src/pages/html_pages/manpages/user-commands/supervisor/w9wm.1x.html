       w9wm - 8-1/2-like Window Manager for X

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>w9wm</b>  [  <b>-grey</b>  ]  [  <b>-version</b>  ] [ <b>-font</b> <u>fname</u> ] [ <b>-nokeys</b> ] [ <b>-nostalgia</b> ] [ <b>-debug</b> ] [ <b>-pass</b> ] [ <b>-term</b>
       <u>termprog</u> ] [ <b>-virtuals</b> <u>n</u> ] [ <b>exit</b> <b>|</b> <b>restart</b> ]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>w9wm</u> is a window manager for X which attempts to emulate the window management policies of Plan 9's <u>8-1/2</u>
       window manager but adds some candy stuff like virtual screens and keyboard shortcuts.

       The <b>-grey</b> option makes  the  background  light  grey,  as  does  8-1/2.   Use  this  option  for  maximum
       authenticity.  <b>-font</b> <u>fname</u> sets the font in <u>w9wm</u>'s menu to <u>fname</u>, overriding the default.  <b>-nokeys</b> option
       inhibits  keyboard  shortcups (Ctrl+Tab and Shift+Ctrl+Tab) <b>-nostalgia</b> applies some useless modifications
       to w9wm look &amp; feel (windows border and cursor appearance) <b>-debug</b> triggers debug mode <b>-pass</b>  uses  click-
       to-focus-passes-through-click, which means that clicking on a nonactive window with whatever mouse button
       activates it and follows click to this window <b>-term</b> <u>termprog</u> specifies an alternative program to run when
       the  <u>New</u>  menu  item is selected.  <b>-virtuals</b> <u>n</u> set the number of virtual screens used <b>-version</b> prints the
       current version on standard error, then exits.

       To make <u>w9wm</u> exit, you have to run <b>w9wm</b> <b>exit</b> on the command line.  There is no ``exit'' menu item.

       <u>w9wm</u> is click-to-type: it has a notion of the current window, which is usually on top, and always has its
       border darkened.  Characters typed at the keyboard go to the current window, and mouse clicks outside the
       current window are swallowed up by <u>w9wm</u>.  To make another window the current one, click on it with button
       1 or type Ctrl+Tab (this shortcut is not ``stable'', which means that I could change it in case it  would
       eventually be annoying).  Unlike other X window managers, w9wm implements `mouse focus': mouse events are
       sent only to the current window.

       A  menu  of window operations is available by pressing button 3 outside the current window.  The first of
       these, <u>New</u>, attempts to spawn a <u>9term</u> process (or <u>xterm</u> if <u>9term</u> is not available).  The new  <u>9term</u>  will
       request  that  its outline be swept using button 3 of the mouse, by changing the cursor.  (<u>xterm</u> defaults
       to a fixed size, and thus wants to be dragged; pressing button 3 places it.)

       The next four menu items are <u>Reshape</u>, <u>Move</u>, <u>Delete</u>, and <u>Hide</u>.  All of the operations  change  the  cursor
       into a target, prompting the user to click button 3 on one of the windows to select it for the operation.
       At  this stage, clicking button 1 or 2 will abort the operation.  Otherwise, if the operation was <u>Resize</u>,
       the user is prompted to sweep out the new outline with button 3.  If it was <u>Move</u>, the  user  should  keep
       the  button  held down after the initial click that selected the window, and drag the window to the right
       place before releasing.  In either case, button 1 or 2 will abort the operation.

       If the <u>Delete</u> operation is selected, the window will be  deleted  when  the  button  is  released.   This
       typically  kills  the  client  that owns the window.  The <u>Hide</u> operation just makes the window invisible.
       While hidden, the window's name appears on the bottom of the button 3 menu.  Selecting that  item  brings
       the window back (unhides it).  This operation replaces the iconification feature provided by other window
       managers.

       A  menu  is  provided  to  switch from a virtual screen to another.  This popup is triggered by using the
       button 2, which displays a menu looking like the previous one but with four entries, <u>One</u>, <u>Two</u>, <u>Three</u>, and
       <u>Four</u>.  Selecting one of these entries will switch to another virtual screen.

       There is also a menu to run programs using button 1.  Hold both "shift" and "left ctrl"  keys  and  press
       button  1.  w9wm will then display a menu that allows you to exec programs specified in the <u>$HOME/.w9wmrc</u>
       file.  Put each command in one line.  w9wm does not yet support args for these commands, write a one-line
       shell script if you need this.q

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b> <b>AND</b> <b>LIMITATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Is not completely compatible with 8-1/2.

       There is a currently a compiled-in limit of 32 hidden windows.

       Also, you cannot put more than 32 commands in your <u>.w9wmrc</u> file
