</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       dh_coq - computes Coq packages provides, and partial dependencies

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>dh_coq</b> [<u>debhelper</u> <u>options</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       dh_coq is a debhelper program that is responsible for filling the ${coq:Provides} and ${coq:Depends}
       substitutions and adding them to substvars files.

       It only acts on a single type of binary packages: those shipping Coq theories. Those are usually names
       libcoq-XXXX, but neither libcoq-XXX-ocaml nor libcoq-XXX-ocaml-dev: those are OCaml library packages and
       managed by dh_ocaml.

       On those packages it takes responsibility for, it will look of the Coq compiled files and compute a
       checksum. This checksum is stored in the registry in /var/lib/coq/md5sums/, and already allows to say the
       current package provides a checksummed-versioned virtual package. The build-depends are then scanned, and
       their checksums are retrieved, so the current package depends also on checksummed virtual packages.

       The reason for this setup is that without the checksum, with just dependencies on libcoq-XXX, ABI
       breakage can happen, because a new libcoq-XXX won't be seen as incompatible, be installed and trigger
       incoherent assumptions errors. With fully checksummed packages, apt-get will not upgrade anything until
       all packages have migrated to the new ABI.

       The dependencies aren't extracted automatically from the compiled project, but from the build-depends of
       the built package, so it's crucial that those are accurate.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <u>debian/libcoq-XXX.volist</u>
           By  default, the list of Coq compiled files shipped by your package is automatically computed, but if
           you need to override this, this files makes it  possible  to  fix  the  list.  Files  are  considered
           relative to the package build directory.
