       coq-tex - process Coq phrases embedded in LaTeX files

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>coq-tex</b>  [  <b>-o</b> <u>output-file</u>  ]  [  <b>-n</b> <u>line-width</u> ] [ <b>-image</b> <u>coq-image</u> ] [ <b>-w</b> ] [ <b>-v</b> ] [ <b>-sl</b> ] [ <b>-hrule</b> ] [
       <b>-small</b> ] <u>input-file</u> <u>...</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>coq-tex</b> filter extracts Coq phrases embedded in LaTeX files, evaluates them, and insert  the  outcome
       of the evaluation after each phrase.

       Three LaTeX environments are provided to include Coq code in the input files:

       <b>coq_example</b>
              The  phrases  between  \begin{coq_example} and \end{coq_example} are evaluated and copied into the
              output file.  Each phrase is followed by the response of the toplevel loop.

       <b>coq_example*</b>
              The phrases between \begin{coq_example*} and \end{coq_example*} are evaluated and copied into  the
              output file.  The responses of the toplevel loop are discarded.

       <b>coq_eval</b>
              The  phrases  between  \begin{coq_eval}  and  \end{coq_eval} are silently evaluated.  They are not
              copied into the output file, and the responses of the toplevel loop are discarded.

       The resulting LaTeX code is stored in the file <u>file</u>.v.tex if the input  file  has  a  name  of  the  form
       <u>file</u>.tex, otherwise the name of the output file is the name of the input file with `.v.tex' appended.

       The  files produced by <b>coq-tex</b> can be directly processed by LaTeX.  Both the Coq phrases and the toplevel
       output are typeset in typewriter font.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-o</b> <u>output-file</u>
              Specify the name of a file where the LaTeX output is to be stored.  A dash `-'  causes  the  LaTeX
              output to be printed on standard output.

       <b>-n</b> <u>line-width</u>
              Set  the line width.  The default is 72 characters.  The responses of the toplevel loop are folded
              if they are longer than the line width.  No folding is performed on the Coq input text.

       <b>-image</b> <u>coq-image</u>
              Cause the file <u>coq-image</u> to be executed to evaluate the Coq phrases.   By  default,  this  is  the
              command <u>coqtop</u> without specifying any path which is used to evaluate the Coq phrases.

       <b>-w</b>     Cause lines to be folded on a space character whenever possible, avoiding word cuts in the output.
              By default, folding occurs at the line width, regardless of word cuts.

       <b>-v</b>     Verbose  mode.   Prints  the  Coq  answers on the standard output.  Useful to detect errors in Coq
              phrases.

       <b>-sl</b>    Slanted mode.  The Coq answers are written in a slanted font.

       <b>-hrule</b> Horizontal lines mode.  The Coq parts are written between two horizontal lines.

       <b>-small</b> Small font mode.  The Coq parts are written in a smaller font.

</pre><h4><b>CAVEATS</b></h4><pre>
       The \begin... and \end... phrases must sit on a  line  by  themselves,  with  no  characters  before  the
       backslash  or  after  the closing brace.  Each Coq phrase must be terminated by `.' at the end of a line.
       Blank space is accepted between `.' and the newline, but any other character will cause <b>coq-tex</b> to ignore
       the end of the phrase, resulting in an incorrect shuffling of  the  responses  into  the  phrases.   (The
       responses ``lag behind''.)
