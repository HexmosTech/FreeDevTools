</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The scout command displays statistics gathered from the File Server process running on each machine
       specified with the <b>-server</b> argument. "OUTPUT" explains the meaning of the statistics and describes how
       they appear in the command shell, which is preferably a window managed by a window manager program.

</pre><h4><b>CAUTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>scout</b> program must be able to access the curses graphics package, which it uses to display
       statistics. Most UNIX distributions include curses as a standard utility.

       Both dumb terminals and windowing systems that emulate terminals can display the <b>scout</b> program's
       statistics. The display makes use of reverse video and cursor addressing, so the display environment must
       support those features for it to look its best (most windowing systems do, most dumb terminals do not).
       Also, set the TERM environment variable to the correct terminal type, or one with characteristics similar
       to the actual ones. For machines running the AIX operating system, the recommended setting for TERM is
       "vt100", as long as the terminal is similar to that. For other operating systems, the wider range of
       acceptable values includes "xterm", "xterms", "vt100", "vt200", and "wyse85".

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>initcmd</b>
           Accommodates the command's use of the AFS command parser, and is optional.

       <b>-server</b> &lt;<u>servers</u> <u>to</u> <u>monitor</u>&gt;+
           Specifies  each  file server machine running a File Server process to monitor. Provide each machine's
           fully qualified hostname unless the <b>-basename</b> argument is used. In that case, specify only the unique
           initial part of each machine name, omitting the domain name suffix (the basename) common to  all  the
           names.  It  is also acceptable to use the shortest abbreviated form of a host name that distinguishes
           it from other machines, but successful resolution depends on the availability of  a  name  resolution
           service (such as the Domain Name Service or a local host table) at the time the command is issued.

       <b>-basename</b> &lt;<u>base</u> <u>server</u> <u>name</u>&gt;
           Specifies  the basename (domain name) suffix common to all of the file server machine names specified
           with the <b>-server</b> argument, and is automatically appended to them. This argument is normally the  name
           of  the  cell to which the machines belong. Do not include the period that separates this suffix from
           the distinguishing part of each file server machine name, but  do  include  any  periods  that  occur
           within  the  suffix  itself.   For  example,  in  the  Example  Corporation cell, the proper value is
           "example.com" rather than ".example.com".

       <b>-frequency</b> &lt;<u>poll</u> <u>frequency</u>&gt;
           Indicates how often to probe the File Server processes. Specify a number of seconds  greater  than  0
           (zero). The default is 60 seconds.

       <b>-host</b>
           Displays the name of the machine that is running the scout program, in the banner line of the display
           screen.

       <b>-attention</b> &lt;<u>attention</u> <u>level</u>&gt;+
           Defines  a  list of entries, each of which pairs a statistic and a threshold value. When the value of
           the statistic exceeds the indicated threshold value, it is highlighted  (in  reverse  video)  in  the
           display. List the pairs in any order. The acceptable values are the following:

           conn &lt;<u>connections</u>&gt;
               Indicates the number of open connections to client processes at which to highlight the statistic.
               The  statistic  returns to regular display when the value goes back below the threshold. There is
               no default threshold.

               An example of an acceptable value is conn 300.

           disk &lt;<u>blocks_free</u>&gt;
               Indicates the number of remaining free kilobyte blocks at which to highlight the  statistic.  The
               statistic  returns  to  regular  display  when the value again exceeds the threshold. There is no
               default threshold.

               An example of an acceptable value is disk 5000.

           disk &lt;<u>percent_full</u>&gt;%
               Indicates the percentage of disk usage at which to highlight the statistic. The statistic returns
               to regular display when the value goes back below the threshold. The default  threshold  is  95%.
               Acceptable  values are the integers in the range from 0 to 99, followed by the percent sign ("%")
               to distinguish this type of value from the one described just previously.

               An example is disk 90%.

           fetch &lt;<u>fetch</u> <u>RPCs</u>&gt;
               Indicates the cumulative number of fetch RPCs from client processes at  which  to  highlight  the
               statistic.  The  statistic  does  not  return  to  regular  display until the File Server process
               restarts, at which time the value returns to zero.  There is no default threshold.

               Example of a legal value: fetch 6000000

           store &lt;<u>store</u> <u>RPCs</u>&gt;
               Indicates the cumulative number of store RPCs from client processes at  which  to  highlight  the
               statistic.  The  statistic  does  not  return  to  regular  display until the File Server process
               restarts, at which time the value returns to zero.  There is no default threshold.

               Example of an acceptable value: store 200000

           ws &lt;<u>active</u> <u>client</u> <u>machines</u>&gt;
               Indicates the number of client machines with active open connections at which  to  highlight  the
               statistic.  An  active  connection  is  defined as one over which the File Server and client have
               communicated in the last 15 minutes. The statistic returns to regular display when the value goes
               back below the threshold. There is no default threshold.

               Example of an acceptable value: ws 65

       <b>-columnwidths</b> &lt;<u>number</u> <u>of</u> <u>characters</u>&gt;+
           Specifies the number of characters to display in each column of the <b>scout</b> statistics display  region.
           Specify  one  to  six  numbers separated by spaces to set the number of characters to be displayed in
           each column.  The values specify the widths of  the  columns  in  the  same  order  the  columns  are
           displayed from left to right.  Use 0 as a placeholder to specify a default column width.

       <b>-debug</b> &lt;<u>debugging</u> <u>trace</u> <u>file</u>&gt;
           Specifies  the  pathname  of  the  file  into which to write a debugging trace. Partial pathnames are
           interpreted relative to the current working directory.

       <b>-help</b>
           Prints the online help for this command. All other valid options are ignored.

       <b>-version</b>
           Prints the program version and then exits. All other valid options are ignored.

</pre><h4><b>OUTPUT</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>scout</b> program can display statistics either in a dedicated window or on a plain screen if a windowing
       environment is not available. For best results, the window or  screen  needs  the  ability  to  print  in
       reverse video.

       The  <b>scout</b>  screen  has  three  main  parts:  the  banner  line,  the  statistics  display region and the
       message/probe line.

   <b>The</b> <b>Banner</b> <b>Line</b>
       By default, the string "Scout" appears in the banner line at  the  top  of  the  window  or  screen.  Two
       optional arguments place additional information in the banner line:

       •   The  <b>-host</b>  flag  displays  the  name of the machine where the <b>scout</b> program is running. As mentioned
           previously, this is useful when running the <b>scout</b> program on  several  machines  but  displaying  the
           results on a single machine.

           For  example,  when  the  <b>-host</b>  flag  is  included  and  the <b>scout</b> program is running on the machine
           "client1.example.com", the banner line reads as follows:

              [client1.example.com] Scout

       •   The <b>-basename</b> argument displays the indicated basename on the banner line. For example, including the
           argument "-basename example.com" argument results in the following banner line:

              Scout for example.com

   <b>The</b> <b>Statistics</b> <b>Display</b> <b>Region</b>
       In this region, which occupies the majority of the window, the  <b>scout</b>  process  displays  the  statistics
       gathered for each File Server process. Each process appears on its own line.

       The region is divided into six columns, labeled as indicated and displaying the following information:

       Conn
           The  first  column  displays  the  number of RPC connections open between the File Server process and
           client machines.  This number equals or exceeds the number in the "Ws" column (see the  fourth  entry
           below),  because each user on the machine can have several separate connections open at once, and one
           client machine can handle several users.

       Fetch
           The second column displays the number of fetch-type RPCs (fetch data, fetch access  list,  and  fetch
           status)  that  client  machines  have made to the File Server process since the latter started.  This
           number is reset to zero each time the File Server process restarts.

       Store
           The third column displays the number of store-type RPCs (store data, store  access  list,  and  store
           status)  that  client  machines  have  made to the File Server process since the latter started. This
           number is reset to zero each time the File Server process restarts.

       Ws  The fourth column displays the number of client machines ("Ws" stands  for  workstations)  that  have
           communicated  with  the  File  Server  process  within  the last 15 minutes. Such machines are termed
           <u>active</u>). This number is likely to be smaller than the number in the first ("Conn") column  because  a
           single client machine can have several connections open to one File Server.

       server name
           The  fifth,  unlabeled,  column displays the name of the file server machine on which the File Server
           process is running. Names of 12 characters or less are displayed in full; longer names are  truncated
           and  an  asterisk  ("*") appears as the last character in the name. Using the <b>-basename</b> argument is a
           good way to avoid truncation, but only if all machine names end in a common string.

       Disk attn
           The sixth column displays the number of available kilobyte blocks on each AFS disk partition  on  the
           file server machine.

           The display for each partition has the following form:

              x:&lt;free_blocks&gt;

           where  "x"  indicates  the partition name. For example, "a:8949" specifies that the <u>/vicepa</u> partition
           has 8,949 1-KB blocks free. Available space can be displayed for up to 26 partitions. If  the  window
           is  not  wide  enough  for  all  partition  entries  to  appear  on  a single line, the <b>scout</b> process
           automatically creates multiple lines, stacking the partition  entries  into  sub-columns  within  the
           sixth column.

           The  label  on  the  "Disk  attn" column indicates the threshold value at which entries in the column
           become highlighted. By default, the label is

              Disk attn: &gt; 95% used

           because by default the scout program highlights the entry for any partition that is over 95% full.

       For all columns except the fifth (file server machine name), the optional <b>-attention</b>  argument  sets  the
       value  at which entries in the column are highlighted to indicate that a certain value has been exceeded.
       Only values in the fifth and "Disk attn" columns ever become highlighted by default.

       If the scout program is unable to access or otherwise obtain information about a partition, it  generates
       a message similar to the following example:

          Could not get information on server fs1.example.com partition /vicepa

   <b>The</b> <b>Message/Probe</b> <b>Line</b>
       The bottom line of the scout screen indicates how many times the <b>scout</b> program has probed the File Server
       processes  for  statistics.  The statistics gathered in the latest probe appear in the statistics display
       region. The <b>-frequency</b> argument overrides the default probe frequency of 60 seconds.
