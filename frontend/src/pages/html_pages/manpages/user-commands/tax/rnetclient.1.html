</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       rnetclient - Submit the Brazilian Income Tax Report to the Brazilian Tax Authority

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>rnetclient</b> [-d|--declaration] &lt;FILE&gt; [-o &lt;DIRECTORY&gt;|--output-dir=&lt;DIRECTORY&gt;]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>rnetclient</b>  is used to send Brazilian tax income reports to Receita Federal, Braziliam Tax Authority.  It
       communicates with the official server from Receita Federal, ensures a secure connection  is  established,
       and  submits  the  file.   It is the product of reverse-engineering ReceitaNet, which is the proprietary,
       non-free version of the software that does the same thing as <b>rnetclient</b>.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-d</b> <b>&lt;FILE&gt;,</b> <b>--declaration=&lt;FILE&gt;</b>
              Provide the declaration (report) filename to  be  sent  to  Receita  Federal.   This  argument  is
              mandatory.   For  historical  reasons,  the user can also provide the declaration filename without
              specifying the <b>-d</b> modifier.

       <b>-o</b> <b>&lt;DIRECTORY&gt;,</b> <b>--output-dir=&lt;DIRECTORY&gt;</b>
              Specify the output directory where the receipt will be saved.  This argument is  optional;  if  no
              output  directory  is  specified,  then the receipt will be saved in the current working directory
              (CWD).

       <b>-V,</b> <b>--version</b>
              Print the program version and exit.

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b> <b>AND</b> <b>MOTIVATION</b></h4><pre>
       There is no way to talk about rnetclient without mentioning IRPF-Livre, which is an older project started
       and maintained by Alexandre Oliva.  This project  exists  because  Receita  Federal,  the  Brazilian  Tax
       Authority,  does  not  release  the  source  code  for the software used to fill the Brazilian Tax Income
       Report.  Alexandre still fights to make Receita Federal release this program as  Free  Software,  but  he
       also  decided  to  produce  and  release a Free version of the program.  However, there was still another
       closed source software needed to fully be able to do your  duties  with  the  Brazilian  government:  the
       program used to submit the report to Receita Federal.  That is how rnetclient was born.

       The  program  began as a personal project from Thadeu Lima de Souza Cascardo.  He had to reverse engineer
       the proprietary software in order to replicate the functionality, and made the first release on 2013.  In
       2014, Alexandre Oliva and Sergio Durigan Junior joined efforts and helped in the release  of  the  second
       version.
