</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       tcpbug - TCP/IP connection bugging device

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>tcpbug</b> [<b>-cx</b>] [<b>-btT</b>] <u>local-port</u> <u>remote-host</u> <u>remote-port</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>tcpbug</b>  forwards  a  TCP/IP connection to port <u>local-port</u> on the local machine to the port <u>remote-port</u> on
       <u>remote-host</u> while spying on the connection and writing all data passing through to standard output.   All
       data  coming  from  the  client  is printed with a greater than sign (<b>&gt;</b>) first on each line, and all data
       coming from the server is printed with a less than sign (<b>&lt;</b>) first on each line.   Any  byte  offsets  and
       time-stamps are printed before the greater than or less than sign, and are separated from each other by a
       colon (<b>:</b>).

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-b</b>     Print the offset of the first byte in the stream for each line.

       <b>-c</b>     Display bytes as individual characters.  Printable characters are displayed directly, some control
              characters  appear  as  C-language escapes (<b>\n</b>, <b>\r</b>, <b>\t</b> et.c), while others appear as 3-digit octal
              numbers.  This should be similar to the -c switch of <b><a href="../man1/od.1.html">od</a></b>(1).

       <b>-t</b>     Print the time at which the data was received for each line.  The time is the  number  of  seconds
              and  microseconds, separated by a decimal point (<b>.</b>), since 00:00 UTC, January 1, 1970, as reported
              by gettimeofday().

       <b>-T</b>     Print the time at which the data was received for each line.  The time is the  number  of  seconds
              and microseconds, separated by a decimal point (<b>.</b>), since the connections were established.

       <b>-x</b>     Display each byte as a two digit hexadecimal number.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       The names of the options are not yet finalized, and may change at a future release.
