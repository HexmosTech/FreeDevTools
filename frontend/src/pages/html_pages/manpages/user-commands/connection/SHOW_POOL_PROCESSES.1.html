       SHOW_POOL_PROCESSES - sends back a list of all Pgpool-II processes waiting for connections and dealing
       with a connection

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
          SHOW POOL_PROCESSES

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>SHOW</b> <b>POOL_PROCESSES</b> sends back a list of all Pgpool-II processes waiting for connections and dealing with
       a connection.

       It has 8 columns:

       •   pool_pid is the PID of the displayed Pgpool-II process.

       •   start_time is the timestamp of when this process was launched.

           •   If child_life_time is set not 0, the time before process restarting is displayed.

       •   client_connection_count counts the number of times this process has been used by clients.

       •   database is the database name of the currently active backend for this process.

       •   username is the user name used in the connection of the currently active backend for this process.

       •   backend_connection_time is the creation time and date of the connection.

       •   pool_counter counts the number of times this pool of connections (process) has been used by clients.

       •   status is current status of this process. Possible values are:

           •   Execute command: Executing a command.

           •   Idle: The process is waiting for a new client command.

           •   Idle: The process is waiting for a new client command in a transaction.

           •   Wait for connection: The process is waiting for a new client connection.

       Here is an example session:

           test=# show pool_processes;
            pool_pid |                      start_time                      | client_connection_count | database | username | backend_connection_time | pool_counter |       status
