</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       <b>plink</b> - PuTTY link, command line network connection tool

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>plink</b> [<u>options</u>] [<u>user</u><b>@</b>]<u>host</u> [<u>command</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>plink</b> is a network connection tool supporting several protocols.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The command-line options supported by <b>plink</b> are:

       <b>-V</b>     Show version information and exit.

       <b>-pgpfp</b> Display  the  fingerprints  of  the  PuTTY PGP Master Keys and exit, to aid in verifying new files
              released by the PuTTY team.

       <b>-v</b>     Show verbose messages.

       <b>-load</b> <u>session</u>
              Load settings from saved session.

       <b>-ssh</b>   Force use of SSH protocol (default).

       <b>-telnet</b>
              Force use of Telnet protocol.

       <b>-rlogin</b>
              Force use of rlogin protocol.

       <b>-raw</b>   Force raw mode.

       <b>-serial</b>
              Force serial mode.

       <b>-ssh-connection</b>
              Force use of the `bare <b>ssh-connection</b>' protocol. This is only likely to be useful when  connecting
              to a <b>psusan</b>(<u>1</u>) server, most likely with an absolute path to a Unix-domain socket in place of <u>host</u>.

       <b>-proxycmd</b> <u>command</u>
              Instead  of making a TCP connection, use <u>command</u> as a proxy; network traffic will be redirected to
              the standard input and output of <u>command</u>. <u>command</u> must be a single word,  so  is  likely  to  need
              quoting by the shell.

              The  special  strings  <b>%host</b> and <b>%port</b> in <u>command</u> will be replaced by the hostname and port number
              you want to connect to; to get a literal <b>%</b> sign, enter <b>%%</b>.

              Backslash escapes are also supported, such as sequences  like  <b>\n</b>  being  replaced  by  a  literal
              newline; to get a literal backslash, enter <b>\\</b>. (Further escaping may be required by the shell.)

              (See  the  main  PuTTY manual for full details of the supported <b>%</b>- and backslash-delimited tokens,
              although most of them are probably not very useful in this context.)

       <b>-P</b> <u>port</u>
              Connect to port <u>port</u>.

       <b>-l</b> <u>user</u>
              Set remote username to <u>user</u>.

       <b>-m</b> <u>path</u>
              Read remote command(s) from local file <u>path</u>.

       <b>-batch</b> Disable interactive prompts.

       <b>-sanitise-stderr</b>

       <b>-sanitise-stdout</b>

       <b>-no-sanitise-stderr</b>

       <b>-no-sanitise-stdout</b>
              By default, Plink can choose to filter control characters if that seems  appropriate,  to  prevent
              remote  processes  sending  confusing  escape  sequences.  These  options override Plink's default
              behaviour to enable or disabling  such  filtering  on  the  standard  error  and  standard  output
              channels.

       <b>-pwfile</b> <u>filename</u>
              Open the specified file, and use the first line of text read from it as the remote password.

       <b>-pw</b> <u>password</u>
              Set  remote  password  to  <u>password</u>.  <u>CAUTION:</u> this will likely make the password visible to other
              users of the local machine (via commands such as `<b>ps</b>' or `<b>w</b>'). Use <b>-pwfile</b> instead.

       <b>-L</b> <b>[</b><u>srcaddr</u><b>:]</b><u>srcport</u><b>:</b><u>desthost</u><b>:</b><u>destport</u>
              Set up a local port forwarding: listen on <u>srcport</u> (or <u>srcaddr</u>:<u>srcport</u> if specified),  and  forward
              any  connections  over the SSH connection to the destination address <u>desthost</u>:<u>destport</u>. Only works
              in SSH.

       <b>-R</b> <b>[</b><u>srcaddr</u><b>:]</b><u>srcport</u><b>:</b><u>desthost</u><b>:</b><u>destport</u>
              Set up a remote port forwarding: ask the SSH server to listen on <u>srcport</u>  (or  <u>srcaddr</u>:<u>srcport</u>  if
              specified), and to forward any connections back over the SSH connection where the client will pass
              them on to the destination address <u>desthost</u>:<u>destport</u>. Only works in SSH.

       <b>-D</b> [<u>srcaddr</u>:]<u>srcport</u>
              Set  up  dynamic port forwarding. The client listens on <u>srcport</u> (or <u>srcaddr</u>:<u>srcport</u> if specified),
              and implements a SOCKS server. So you can point SOCKS-aware applications at  this  port  and  they
              will automatically use the SSH connection to tunnel all their connections. Only works in SSH.

       <b>-X</b>     Enable X11 forwarding.

       <b>-x</b>     Disable X11 forwarding (default).

       <b>-A</b>     Enable agent forwarding.

       <b>-a</b>     Disable agent forwarding (default).

       <b>-t</b>     Enable pty allocation (default if a command is NOT specified).

       <b>-T</b>     Disable pty allocation (default if a command is specified).

       <b>-1</b>     Force use of SSH protocol version 1.

       <b>-2</b>     Force use of SSH protocol version 2.

       <b>-4</b>, <b>-6</b> Force use of IPv4 or IPv6 for network connections.

       <b>-C</b>     Enable SSH compression.

       <b>-i</b> <u>keyfile</u>
              Private  key  file  for  user authentication. For SSH-2 keys, this key file must be in PuTTY's PPK
              format, not OpenSSH's format or anyone else's.

              If you are using an authentication agent, you can also specify a <u>public</u> key here (in RFC  4716  or
              OpenSSH format), to identify which of the agent's keys to use.

       <b>-noagent</b>
              Don't  try  to  use  an  authentication agent for local authentication. (This doesn't affect agent
              forwarding.)

       <b>-agent</b> Allow use of an authentication agent. (This option is only necessary to override a  setting  in  a
              saved session.)

       <b>-no-trivial-auth</b>
              Disconnect from any SSH server which accepts authentication without ever having asked for any kind
              of  password  or signature or token. (You might want to enable this for a server you always expect
              to challenge you, for instance to ensure you don't accidentally type your  key  file's  passphrase
              into a compromised server spoofing Plink's passphrase prompt.)

       <b>-noshare</b>
              Don't test and try to share an existing connection, always make a new connection.

       <b>-share</b> Test and try to share an existing connection.

       <b>-hostkey</b> <u>key</u>
              Specify  an  acceptable host public key. This option may be specified multiple times; each key can
              be either a fingerprint (<b>SHA256:AbCdE...</b>, <b>99:aa:bb:...</b>, etc) or a base64-encoded blob in OpenSSH's
              one-line format.

              Specifying this option overrides automated host key management; <u>only</u> the key(s) specified  on  the
              command-line  will  be  accepted  (unless  a saved session also overrides host keys, in which case
              those will be added to), and the host key cache will not be written.

       <b>-s</b>     Remote command is SSH subsystem (SSH-2 only).

       <b>-N</b>     Don't start a remote command or shell at all (SSH-2 only).

       <b>-nc</b> <u>host</u>:<u>port</u>
              Make a remote network connection from the server instead of starting a shell or command.

       <b>-sercfg</b> <u>configuration-string</u>
              Specify the configuration parameters for the serial port, in  <b>-serial</b>  mode.  <u>configuration-string</u>
              should be a comma-separated list of configuration parameters as follows:

              <b>•</b>      Any single digit from 5 to 9 sets the number of data bits.

              <b>•</b>      `<b>1</b>', `<b>1.5</b>' or `<b>2</b>' sets the number of stop bits.

              <b>•</b>      Any other numeric string is interpreted as a baud rate.

              <b>•</b>      A  single  lower-case letter specifies the parity: `<b>n</b>' for none, `<b>o</b>' for odd, `<b>e</b>' for even,
                     `<b>m</b>' for mark and `<b>s</b>' for space.

              <b>•</b>      A single upper-case letter specifies the flow control: `<b>N</b>' for none, `<b>X</b>' for XON/XOFF,  `<b>R</b>'
                     for RTS/CTS and `<b>D</b>' for DSR/DTR.

       <b>-sshlog</b> <u>logfile</u>

       <b>-sshrawlog</b> <u>logfile</u>
              For  SSH  connections, these options make <b>plink</b> log protocol details to a file. (Some of these may
              be sensitive, although by default an effort is made to suppress obvious passwords.)

              <b>-sshlog</b> logs decoded SSH packets  and  other  events  (those  that  <b>-v</b>  would  print).  <b>-sshrawlog</b>
              additionally logs the raw encrypted packet data.

       <b>-logoverwrite</b>
              If Plink is configured to write to a log file that already exists, discard the existing file.

       <b>-logappend</b>
              If  Plink  is  configured  to  write to a log file that already exists, append new log data to the
              existing file.

       <b>-shareexists</b>
              Instead of making a new connection, test for the presence of an existing connection  that  can  be
              shared. The desired session can be specified in any of the usual ways.

              Returns immediately with a zero exit status if a suitable `upstream' exists, nonzero otherwise.
