</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       perl589delta - what is new for perl v5.8.9

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This document describes differences between the 5.8.8 release and the 5.8.9 release.

</pre><h4><b>Notice</b></h4><pre>
       The 5.8.9 release will be the last significant release of the 5.8.x series. Any future releases of 5.8.x
       will likely only be to deal with security issues, and platform build failures. Hence you should look to
       migrating to 5.10.x, if you have not started already.  See "Known Problems" for more information.

</pre><h4><b>Incompatible</b> <b>Changes</b></h4><pre>
       A particular construction in the source code of extensions written in C++ may need changing. See "Changed
       Internals" for more details. All extensions written in C, most written in C++, and all existing compiled
       extensions are unaffected. This was necessary to improve C++ support.

       Other than this, there are no changes intentionally incompatible with 5.8.8.  If any exist, they are bugs
       and reports are welcome.

</pre><h4><b>Core</b> <b>Enhancements</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Unicode</b> <b>Character</b> <b>Database</b> <b>5.1.0</b>
       The copy of the Unicode Character Database included in Perl 5.8 has been updated to 5.1.0 from 4.1.0. See
       &lt;<a href="http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode5.1.0/">http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode5.1.0/</a>#NotableChanges&gt; for the notable changes.

   <b>stat</b> <b>and</b> <b>-X</b> <b>on</b> <b>directory</b> <b>handles</b>
       It is now possible to call "stat" and the "-X" filestat operators on directory handles. As both directory
       and file handles are barewords, there can be ambiguities over which was intended. In these situations the
       file handle semantics are preferred. Both also treat *FILE{IO} filehandles like *FILE filehandles.

   <b>Source</b> <b>filters</b> <b>in</b> <b>@INC</b>
       It's possible to enhance the mechanism of subroutine hooks in @INC by adding a source filter on top of
       the filehandle opened and returned by the hook. This feature was planned a long time ago, but wasn't
       quite working until now. See "require" in perlfunc for details. (Nicholas Clark)

   <b>Exceptions</b> <b>in</b> <b>constant</b> <b>folding</b>
       The constant folding routine is now wrapped in an exception handler, and if folding throws an exception
       (such as attempting to evaluate 0/0), perl now retains the current optree, rather than aborting the whole
       program.  Without this change, programs would not compile if they had expressions that happened to
       generate exceptions, even though those expressions were in code that could never be reached at runtime.
       (Nicholas Clark, Dave Mitchell)

   <b>"no</b> <b>VERSION"</b>
       You can now use "no" followed by a version number to specify that you want to use a version of perl older
       than the specified one.

   <b>Improved</b> <b>internal</b> <b>UTF-8</b> <b>caching</b> <b>code</b>
       The code that caches calculated UTF-8 byte offsets for character offsets for a string has been re-
       written. Several bugs have been located and eliminated, and the code now makes better use of the
       information it has, so should be faster. In particular, it doesn't scan to the end of a string before
       calculating an offset within the string, which should speed up some operations on long strings. It is now
       possible to disable the caching code at run time, to verify that it is not the cause of suspected
       problems.

   <b>Runtime</b> <b>relocatable</b> <b>installations</b>
       There is now <u>Configure</u> support for creating a perl tree that is relocatable at run time. see "Relocatable
       installations".

   <b>New</b> <b>internal</b> <b>variables</b>
       "${^CHILD_ERROR_NATIVE}"
           This  variable  gives the native status returned by the last pipe close, backtick command, successful
           call to "wait" or "waitpid", or from the "system" operator. See perlvar for details. (Contributed  by
           Gisle Aas.)

       "${^UTF8CACHE}"
           This  variable controls the state of the internal UTF-8 offset caching code.  1 for on (the default),
           0 for off, -1 to debug the caching code by  checking  all  its  results  against  linear  scans,  and
           panicking on any discrepancy.

   <b>"readpipe"</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>overridable</b>
       The  built-in function "readpipe" is now overridable. Overriding it permits also to override its operator
       counterpart, "qx//" (also known as ``).

   <b>simple</b> <b>exception</b> <b>handling</b> <b>macros</b>
       Perl 5.8.9 (and 5.10.0 onwards) now provides a couple of macros to do very basic exception handling in XS
       modules. You can use these macros if you call code that may "croak", but you  need  to  do  some  cleanup
       before giving control back to Perl. See "Exception Handling" in perlguts for more details.

   <b>-D</b> <b>option</b> <b>enhancements</b>
       •   "-Dq" suppresses the <u>EXECUTING...</u> message when running under "-D"

       •   "-Dl" logs runops loop entry and exit, and jump level popping.

       •   "-Dv" displays the process id as part of the trace output.

   <b>XS-assisted</b> <b>SWASHGET</b>
       Some  pure-perl  code that the regexp engine was using to retrieve Unicode properties and transliteration
       mappings has been reimplemented in XS for faster execution.  (SADAHIRO Tomoyuki)

   <b>Constant</b> <b>subroutines</b>
       The interpreter internals now support a far more memory efficient form of inlineable constants. Storing a
       reference to a constant value in a symbol table is equivalent to a full typeglob referencing  a  constant
       subroutine,  but  using  about  400  bytes  less  memory. This proxy constant subroutine is automatically
       upgraded to a real typeglob with subroutine if  necessary.   The  approach  taken  is  analogous  to  the
       existing  space optimisation for subroutine stub declarations, which are stored as plain scalars in place
       of the full typeglob.

       However, to aid backwards compatibility of existing code, which (wrongly) does not expect anything  other
       than typeglobs in symbol tables, nothing in core uses this feature, other than the regression tests.

       Stubs  for  prototyped  subroutines  have  been  stored  in symbol tables as plain strings, and stubs for
       unprototyped subroutines as the number -1, since 5.005, so code which assumes that the core  only  places
       typeglobs in symbol tables has been making incorrect assumptions for over 10 years.

       •   "Win32" upgraded to version 0.38

           •   added  new function "GetCurrentProcessId" which returns the regular Windows process identifier of
               the current process, even when called from within a fork.

       •   "XSLoader" upgraded to version 0.10

       •   "XS::APItest" and "XS::Typemap" are for internal use only and hence no longer  installed.  Many  more

</pre><h4><b>Performance</b> <b>Enhancements</b></h4><pre>
       •   The default since perl 5.000 has been for perl to create an empty scalar with every new typeglob. The
           increased use of lexical variables means that  most  are  now  unused.  Thanks  to  Nicholas  Clark's
           efforts,  Perl  can  now  be  compiled  with  "-DPERL_DONT_CREATE_GVSV" to avoid creating these empty
           scalars.  This will significantly decrease the number of scalars allocated  for  all  configurations,
           and  the  number of scalars that need to be copied for ithread creation. Whilst this option is binary
           compatible with existing perl installations, it does change  a  long-standing  assumption  about  the
           internals,  hence  it  is  not  enabled  by  default,  as  some  third party code may rely on the old
           behaviour.

           We would recommend testing with this configuration on  new  deployments  of  perl,  particularly  for
           multi-threaded  servers,  to  see  whether  all  third  party  code  is  compatible  with it, as this
           configuration may give useful performance improvements.  For  existing  installations  we  would  not
           recommend changing to this configuration unless thorough testing is performed before deployment.

       •   "diagnostics"  no  longer  uses  $&amp;,  which results in large speedups for regexp matching in all code
           using it.

       •   Regular expressions classes of a single character are now treated the same as if  the  character  had
           been  used as a literal, meaning that code that uses char-classes as an escaping mechanism will see a
           speedup. (Yves Orton)

       •   Creating anonymous array and hash references (ie. "[]" and "{}") now incurs  no  more  overhead  than
           creating  an anonymous list or hash. Nicholas Clark provided changes with a saving of two ops and one
           stack push, which was measured as a slightly better than 5% improvement for these operations.

       •   Many calls to strlen() have been eliminated, either because the  length  was  already  known,  or  by
           adopting  or  enhancing APIs that pass lengths. This has been aided by the adoption of a my_sprintf()
           wrapper, which returns the correct C89 value - the length of  the  formatted  string.  Previously  we
           could  not  rely  on  the  return value of sprintf(), because on some ancient but extant platforms it
           still returns "char *".

       •   "index" is now faster if the search string is stored in UTF-8 but only  contains  characters  in  the
           Latin-1 range.

       •   The  Unicode  swatch  cache  inside  the  regexp  engine is now used. (the lookup had a key mismatch,
           present since the initial implementation). [RT #42839]

</pre><h4><b>Installation</b> <b>and</b> <b>Configuration</b> <b>Improvements</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Relocatable</b> <b>installations</b>
       There  is  now  <u>Configure</u>  support  for  creating  a  relocatable  perl  tree.  If  you  <u>Configure</u>   with
       "-Duserelocatableinc",  then the paths in @INC (and everything else in %Config) can be optionally located
       via the path of the <u>perl</u> executable.

       At start time, if any paths in @INC or "Config" that <u>Configure</u> marked as relocatable  (by  starting  them
       with  ".../"),  then they are prefixed the directory of $^X. This allows the relocation can be configured
       on a per-directory  basis,  although  the  default  with  "-Duserelocatableinc"  is  that  everything  is
       relocated. The initial install is done to the original configured prefix.

   <b>Configuration</b> <b>improvements</b>
       <u>Configure</u>  is now better at removing temporary files. Tom Callaway (from RedHat) also contributed patches
       that complete the set of flags passed to the compiler and the linker, in particular that "-fPIC"  is  now
       enabled on Linux. It will also croak when your <u>/dev/null</u> isn't a device.

       A   new   configuration   variable   "d_pseudofork"   has   been   to  <u>Configure</u>,  and  is  available  as
       $Config{d_pseudofork} in the "Config" module. This distinguishes real "fork" support from the  pseudofork
       emulation used on Windows platforms.

       <u>Config.pod</u> and <u>config.sh</u> are now placed correctly for cross-compilation.

       $Config{useshrplib} is now 'true' rather than 'yes' when using a shared perl library.

   <b>Compilation</b> <b>improvements</b>
       Parallel  makes  should  work  properly  now,  although  there  may  still  be problems if "make test" is
       instructed to run in parallel.

       Many compilation warnings have been cleaned up. A very stubborn compiler warning  in  S_emulate_eaccess()
       was killed after six attempts.  <u>g++</u> support has been tuned, especially for FreeBSD.

       <u>mkppport</u>  has been integrated, and all <u>ppport.h</u> files in the core will now be autogenerated at build time
       (and removed during cleanup).

   <b>Installation</b> <b>improvements</b>
       <u>installman</u> now works with "-Duserelocatableinc" and "DESTDIR".

       <u>installperl</u> no longer installs:

       •   static library files of statically linked extensions when a shared perl library is being used.  (They
           are not needed. See "Windows" below).

       •   <u>SIGNATURE</u> and <u>PAUSE*.pub</u> (CPAN files)

       •   <u>NOTES</u> and <u>PATCHING</u> (ExtUtils files)

       •   <u>perlld</u> and <u>ld2</u> (Cygwin files)

   <b>Platform</b> <b>Specific</b> <b>Changes</b>
       There are improved hints for AIX, Cygwin, DEC/OSF, FreeBSD, HP/UX, Irix 6 Linux, MachTen, NetBSD, OS/390,
       QNX, SCO, Solaris, SunOS, System V Release 5.x (UnixWare 7, OpenUNIX 8), Ultrix, UMIPS, uts and VOS.

       <u>FreeBSD</u>

       •   Drop  "-std=c89" and "-ansi" if using "long long" as the main integral type, else in FreeBSD 6.2 (and
           perhaps other releases), system headers do not declare some functions required by perl.

       <u>Solaris</u>

       •   Starting with Solaris 10, we do not want versioned shared libraries, because those often  indicate  a
           private  use  only  library.  These  problems could often be triggered when SUNWbdb (Berkeley DB) was
           installed. Hence if Solaris 10 is detected set "ignore_versioned_solibs=y".

       <u>VMS</u>

       •   Allow IEEE math to be deselected on OpenVMS I64 (but it remains the default).

       •   Record IEEE usage in "config.h"

       •   Help older VMS compilers by using "ccflags" when building "munchconfig.exe".

       •   Don't try to build old "Thread" extension on VMS when "-Duseithreads" has been chosen.

       •   Passing a raw string of "NaN" to <u>nawk</u> causes a core dump - so the string has been changed to "*NaN*"

       •   <u>t/op/stat.t</u> tests will now test hard links on VMS if they are supported.

       <u>Windows</u>

       •   When using a shared perl library <u>installperl</u> no longer installs static library files, import  library
           files  and  export  library  files  (of  statically  linked extensions) and empty bootstrap files (of
           dynamically linked extensions). This fixes a problem building PAR-Packer on Win32 with a debug  build
           of perl.

       •   Various  improvements  to  the  win32  build  process,  including support for Visual C++ 2005 Express
           Edition (aka Visual C++ 8.x).

       •   <u>perl.exe</u> will now have an icon if built with MinGW or Borland.

       •   Improvements to the perl-static.exe build process.

       •   Add Win32 makefile option to link all extensions statically.

       •   The <u>WinCE</u> directory has been merged into the <u>Win32</u> directory.

       •   "setlocale" tests have been re-enabled for Windows XP onwards.

</pre><h4><b>Selected</b> <b>Bug</b> <b>Fixes</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Unicode</b>
       Many many bugs related to the internal Unicode implementation (UTF-8) have  been  fixed.  In  particular,
       long  standing bugs related to returning Unicode via "tie", overloading or $@ are now gone, some of which
       were never reported.

       "unpack" will internally convert the string back from UTF-8 on  numeric  types.   This  is  a  compromise
       between  the  full consistency now in 5.10, and the current behaviour, which is often used as a "feature"
       on string types.

       Using ":crlf" and "UTF-16" IO layers together will now work.

       Fixed problems with "split", Unicode "/\s+/" and "/ \0/".

       Fixed bug RT #40641 - encoding of Unicode characters in regular expressions.

       Fixed a bug where using certain patterns in a regexp led to a panic.  [RT #45337]

       Perl no longer segfaults (due to infinite internal recursion) if the locale's character is not UTF-8  [RT
       #41442]:

           use open ':locale';
           print STDERR "\x{201e}"; # &amp;bdquo;

   <b>PerlIO</b>
       Inconsistencies  have  been  fixed  in  the  reference  counting  PerlIO  uses to keep track of Unix file
       descriptors, and the API used by XS code to manage getting and releasing "FILE *"s

   <b>Magic</b>
       Several bugs have been fixed in Magic, the internal system used to  implement  features  such  as  "tie",
       tainting and threads sharing.

       "undef @array" on a tied array now correctly calls the "CLEAR" method.

       Some  of  the  bitwise  ops were not checking whether their arguments were magical before using them. [RT
       #24816]

       Magic is no longer invoked twice by the expression "\&amp;$x"

       A bug with assigning large numbers and tainting has been resolved.  [RT #40708]

       A new entry has been added to the MAGIC vtable - "svt_local". This is used when copying magic to the  new
       value during "local", allowing certain problems with localising shared variables to be resolved.

       For the implementation details, see "Magic Virtual Tables" in perlguts.

   <b>Reblessing</b> <b>overloaded</b> <b>objects</b> <b>now</b> <b>works</b>
       Internally,  perl  object-ness  is  on  the  referent, not the reference, even though methods can only be
       called via a reference. However, the original implementation  of  overloading  stored  flags  related  to
       overloading  on the reference, relying on the flags being copied when the reference was copied, or set at
       the creation of a new reference. This manifests in a bug - if you rebless an object from a class that has
       overloading, into one that does not, then any other existing references think that they (still) point  to
       an  overloaded  object,  choose these C code paths, and then throw errors.  Analogously, blessing into an
       overloaded class when other references exist will result in them not using overloading.

       The implementation has been fixed for 5.10, but this fix changes the semantics of flag bits,  so  is  not
       binary  compatible,  so  can't be applied to 5.8.9.  However, 5.8.9 has a work-around that implements the
       same bug fix. If the referent has multiple references, then all the  other  references  are  located  and
       corrected.  A  full  search  is  avoided whenever possible by scanning lexicals outwards from the current
       subroutine, and the argument stack.

       A certain well known Linux vendor applied incomplete versions of this bug fix to their <u><a href="file:///usr/lib/w3m/cgi-bin/w3mman2html.cgi?perl">/usr/bin/perl</a></u>  and
       then  prematurely  closed bug reports about performance issues without consulting back upstream. This not
       being enough, they then proceeded to ignore the necessary  fixes  to  these  unreleased  changes  for  11
       months,  until  massive  pressure  was applied by their long-suffering paying customers, catalysed by the
       failings being featured on a prominent blog and Slashdot.

   <b>"strict"</b> <b>now</b> <b>propagates</b> <b>correctly</b> <b>into</b> <b>string</b> <b>evals</b>
       Under 5.8.8 and earlier:

           $ perl5.8.8 -e 'use strict; eval "use foo bar" or die $@'
           Can't locate foo.pm in @INC (@INC contains: ... .) at (eval 1) line 2.
           BEGIN failed--compilation aborted at (eval 1) line 2.

       Under 5.8.9 and later:

           $ perl5.8.9 -e 'use strict; eval "use foo bar" or die $@'
           Bareword "bar" not allowed while "strict subs" in use at (eval 1) line 1.

       This may cause problems with programs that parse the error message and rely on the buggy behaviour.

   <b>Other</b> <b>fixes</b>
       •   The tokenizer no longer treats "=cute" (and other words beginning  with  "=cut")  as  a  synonym  for
           "=cut".

       •   Calling "CORE::require"

           "CORE::require"  and  "CORE::do"  were always parsed as "require" and "do" when they were overridden.
           This is now fixed.

       •   Stopped memory leak on long <u>/etc/groups</u> entries.

       •   "while (my $x ...) { ...; redo }" shouldn't "undef $x".

           In the presence of "my" in the conditional of a while(), until(), or for(;;)  loop,  we  now  add  an
           extra scope to the body so that "redo" doesn't "undef" the lexical.

       •   The  "encoding"  pragma now correctly ignores anything following an "@" character in the "LC_ALL" and
           "LANG" environment variables. [RT # 49646]

       •   A segfault observed with some <u>gcc</u> 3.3 optimisations is resolved.

       •   A possible segfault when "unpack" used in scalar context with "()" groups is resolved. [RT #50256]

       •   Resolved issue where $! could be changed by a signal handler interrupting a "system" call.

       •   Fixed bug RT #37886, symbolic dereferencing was allowed in the argument of "defined" even  under  the
           influence of "use strict 'refs'".

       •   Fixed bug RT #43207, where "lc"/"uc" inside "sort" affected the return value.

       •   Fixed bug RT #45607, where "*{"BONK"} = \&amp;{"BONK"}" didn't work correctly.

       •   Fixed bug RT #35878, croaking from a XSUB called via "goto &amp;xsub" corrupts perl internals.

       •   Fixed  bug  RT  #32539,  <u>DynaLoader.o</u>  is  moved into <u>libperl.so</u> to avoid the need to statically link
           DynaLoader into the stub perl executable. With this <u>libperl.so</u> provides everything needed  to  get  a
           functional embedded perl interpreter to run.

       •   Fix bug RT #36267 so that assigning to a tied hash doesn't change the underlying hash.

       •   Fix  bug RT #6006, regexp replaces using large replacement variables fail some of the time, <u>i.e.</u> when
           substitution contains something like "${10}" (note the bracket) instead of just $10.

       •   Fix bug RT #45053, Perl_newCONSTSUB() is now thread safe.

   <b>Platform</b> <b>Specific</b> <b>Fixes</b>

       •   Various improvements to 64 bit builds.

       •   Mutex protection added in  PerlIOStdio_close()  to  avoid  race  conditions.   Hopefully  this  fixes

       <u>Windows</u>

       •   "File::Find"  used  to fail when the target directory is a bare drive letter and "no_chdir" is 1 (the
           default is 0). [RT #41555]

       •   A build problem with specifying "USE_MULTI" and "USE_ITHREADS" but  without  "USE_IMP_SYS"  has  been
           fixed.

       •   The   process   id   is   no   longer   truncated   to   16   bits   on   some  Windows  platforms  (
           <a href="http://bugs.activestate.com/show_bug.cgi">http://bugs.activestate.com/show_bug.cgi</a>?id=72443 )

       •   Fixed bug RT #54828 in <u>perlio.c</u> where calling "binmode" on Win32 and Cygwin may cause a  segmentation
           fault.

       •   On VMS, escaped dots will be preserved when converted to Unix syntax.

       •   "keys %+" no longer throws an 'ambiguous' warning.

       •   Using "#!perl -d" could trigger an assertion, which has been fixed.

       •   Don't stringify tied code references in @INC when calling "require".

       •   Code references in @INC report the correct file name when "__FILE__" is used.

       •   Width and precision in sprintf didn't handle characters above 255 correctly.  [RT #40473]

       •   List slices with indices out of range now work more consistently.  [RT #39882]

       •   A  change  introduced  with perl 5.8.1 broke the parsing of arguments of the form "-foo=bar" with the
           "-s" on the &lt;#!&gt; line. This has been fixed. See <a href="http://bugs.activestate.com/show_bug.cgi">http://bugs.activestate.com/show_bug.cgi</a>?id=43483

       •   "tr///" is now threadsafe. Previously it was storing a swash inside its OP, rather than in a pad.

       •   <u>pod2html</u> labels anchors more consistently and handles nested definition lists better.

       •   "threads" cleanup veto has been extended to include perl_free() and perl_destruct()

       •   On some systems, changes to $ENV{TZ} would not  always  be  respected  by  the  underlying  calls  to
           localtime_r().  Perl now forces the inspection of the environment on these systems.

       •   The  special  variable  $^R  is now more consistently set when executing regexps using the "(?{...})"
           construct.  In particular, it will still be set  even  if  backreferences  or  optional  sub-patterns
           "(?:...)?" are used.

</pre><h4><b>New</b> <b>or</b> <b>Changed</b> <b>Diagnostics</b></h4><pre>
   <b>panic:</b> <b>sv_chop</b> <b>%s</b>
       This  new  fatal  error occurs when the C routine Perl_sv_chop() was passed a position that is not within
       the scalar's string buffer. This is caused by buggy XS code, and at this point recovery is not possible.

   <b>Maximal</b> <b>count</b> <b>of</b> <b>pending</b> <b>signals</b> <b>(%s)</b> <b>exceeded</b>
       This new fatal error occurs when the perl process has to abort due to too many pending signals, which  is
       bound to prevent perl from being able to handle further incoming signals safely.

   <b>panic:</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>%s</b> <b>in</b> <b>%s</b>
       This  new fatal error occurs when the ACL version file test operator is used where it is not available on
       the current platform. Earlier checks mean that it should never be possible to get this.

   <b>FETCHSIZE</b> <b>returned</b> <b>a</b> <b>negative</b> <b>value</b>
       New error indicating that a tied array has claimed to have a negative number of elements.

   <b>Can't</b> <b>upgrade</b> <b>%s</b> <b>(%d)</b> <b>to</b> <b>%d</b>
       Previously the internal error from the SV upgrade code was the less informative <u>Can't</u> <u>upgrade</u>  <u>that</u>  <u>kind</u>
       <u>of</u> <u>scalar</u>. It now reports the current internal type, and the new type requested.

   <b>%s</b> <b>argument</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>HASH</b> <b>or</b> <b>ARRAY</b> <b>element</b> <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>subroutine</b>
       This  error,  thrown  if  an  invalid  argument  is  provided  to  "exists"  now correctly includes "or a
       subroutine". [RT #38955]

   <b>Cannot</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>non-overridable</b> <b>builtin</b> <b>%s</b> <b>fatal</b>
       This error in "Fatal" previously did not show the name of the builtin in question (now represented by  %s
       above).

   <b>Unrecognized</b> <b>character</b> <b>'%s'</b> <b>in</b> <b>column</b> <b>%d</b>
       This error previously did not state the column.

   <b>Offset</b> <b>outside</b> <b>string</b>
       This can now also be generated by a "seek" on a file handle using "PerlIO::scalar".

   <b>Invalid</b> <b>escape</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>specified</b> <b>encoding</b> <b>in</b> <b>regexp;</b> <b>marked</b> <b>by</b> <b>&lt;--</b> <b>HERE</b> <b>in</b> <b>m/%s/</b>
       New error, introduced as part of the fix to RT #40641 to handle encoding of Unicode characters in regular
       expression comments.

   <b>Your</b> <b>machine</b> <b>doesn't</b> <b>support</b> <b>dump/undump</b>
       A more informative fatal error issued when calling "dump" on Win32 and Cygwin. (Given that the purpose of
       "dump"  is  to  abort with a core dump, and core dumps can't be produced on these platforms, this is more
       useful than silently exiting.)

</pre><h4><b>Changed</b> <b>Internals</b></h4><pre>
       The perl sources can now be  compiled  with  a  C++  compiler  instead  of  a  C  compiler.  A  necessary
       implementation  details  is  that  under C++, the macro "XS" used to define XSUBs now includes an "extern
       "C"" definition. A side effect of this is that <b>C++</b> code that used the construction

           typedef XS(SwigPerlWrapper);

       now needs to be written

           typedef XSPROTO(SwigPerlWrapper);

       using the new "XSPROTO" macro, in order to compile. C extensions are unaffected,  although  C  extensions
       are  encouraged  to  use  "XSPROTO"  too.   This change was present in the 5.10.0 release of perl, so any
       actively maintained code that happened to use this construction should already have  been  adapted.  Code
       that needs changing will fail with a compilation error.

       "set"  magic on localizing/assigning to a magic variable will now only trigger for <u>container</u> <u>magics</u>, i.e.
       it will for %ENV or %SIG but not for $#array.

       The new API macro newSVpvs() can be used in place of constructions such as "newSVpvn("ISA", 3)". It takes
       a single string constant, and at C compile time determines its length.

       The new API function Perl_newSV_type() can be used as a more efficient replacement of the common idiom

           sv = <a href="../man0/newSV.0.html">newSV</a>(0);
           sv_upgrade(sv, type);

       Similarly Perl_newSVpvn_flags() can be used to  combine  Perl_newSVpv()  with  Perl_sv_2mortal()  or  the
       equivalent Perl_sv_newmortal() with Perl_sv_setpvn()

       Two  new  macros  mPUSHs()  and mXPUSHs() are added, to make it easier to push mortal SVs onto the stack.
       They were then used to fix several bugs where values on the stack had not been mortalised.

       A Perl_signbit() function was added to test the sign  of  an  "NV".  It  maps  to  the  system  one  when
       available.

       Perl_av_reify(),   Perl_lex_end(),   Perl_mod(),   Perl_op_clear(),   Perl_pop_return(),   Perl_qerror(),
       Perl_setdefout(), Perl_vivify_defelem() and  Perl_yylex()  are  now  visible  to  extensions.   This  was
       required to allow "Data::Alias" to work on Windows.

       Perl_find_runcv()  is  now  visible to perl core extensions. This was required to allow "Sub::Current" to
       work on Windows.

       "ptr_table*" functions are now available in unthreaded perl. "Storable" takes advantage of this.

       There have been many small cleanups made to the internals.  In  particular,  Perl_sv_upgrade()  has  been
       simplified  considerably, with a straight-through code path that uses memset() and memcpy() to initialise
       the new body, rather than assignment via  multiple  temporary  variables.  It  has  also  benefited  from
       simplification and de-duplication of the arena management code.

       A  lot  of  small  improvements  in  the code base were made due to reports from the Coverity static code
       analyzer.

       Corrected use and documentation of  Perl_gv_stashpv(),  Perl_gv_stashpvn(),  Perl_gv_stashsv()  functions
       (last parameter is a bitmask, not boolean).

       "PERL_SYS_INIT", "PERL_SYS_INIT3" and "PERL_SYS_TERM" macros have been changed into functions.

       "PERLSYS_TERM"  no  longer  requires  a  context.  PerlIO_teardown() is now called without a context, and
       debugging output in this function has been  disabled  because  that  required  that  an  interpreter  was
       present, an invalid assumption at termination time.

       All  compile  time  options  which  affect  binary compatibility have been grouped together into a global
       variable ("PL_bincompat_options").

       The values of "PERL_REVISION", "PERL_VERSION" and "PERL_SUBVERSION" are now baked into  global  variables
       (and  hence  into  any  shared perl library).  Additionally under "MULTIPLICITY", the perl executable now
       records  the  size  of  the  interpreter  structure  (total,  and  for  this   version).   Coupled   with
       "PL_bincompat_options"  this  will allow 5.8.10 (and later), when compiled with a shared perl library, to
       perform sanity checks in main() to verify that the shared library is indeed binary compatible.

       Symbolic references can now have embedded NULs. The new public function Perl_get_cvn_flags() can be  used
       in extensions if you have to handle them.

   <b>Macro</b> <b>cleanups</b>
       The  core  code,  and  XS  code in <u>ext</u> that is not dual-lived on CPAN, no longer uses the macros "PL_na",
       NEWSV(), Null(), "Nullav", "Nullcv", "Nullhv", "Nullhv" <u>etc</u>.  Their  use  is  discouraged  in  new  code,
       particularly "PL_na", which is a small performance hit.

</pre><h4><b>New</b> <b>Tests</b></h4><pre>
       Many modules updated from CPAN incorporate new tests. Some core specific tests have been added:

       ext/DynaLoader/t/DynaLoader.t
           Tests for the "DynaLoader" module.

</pre><h4><b>Known</b> <b>Problems</b></h4><pre>
       There are no known new bugs.

       However, programs that rely on bugs that have been fixed  will  have  problems.   Also,  many  bug  fixes
       present  in 5.10.0 can't be back-ported to the 5.8.x branch, because they require changes that are binary
       incompatible, or because the code changes are too large and hence too risky to incorporate.

       We have only limited volunteer labour, and the maintenance burden is getting increasingly complex.  Hence
       this  will  be the last significant release of the 5.8.x series. Any future releases of 5.8.x will likely
       only be to deal with security issues, and platform build failures. Hence you should look to migrating  to
       5.10.x,  if  you  have  not  started  already.  Alternatively,  if business requirements constrain you to
       continue to use 5.8.x, you may wish to consider commercial support from firms such as ActiveState.

</pre><h4><b>Platform</b> <b>Specific</b> <b>Notes</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Win32</b>
       readdir(), cwd(), $^X and @INC now use the alternate (short) filename if the long  name  is  outside  the
       current codepage (Jan Dubois).

</pre><h4><b>Obituary</b></h4><pre>
       Nick  Ing-Simmons,  long time Perl hacker, author of the "Tk" and "Encode" modules, <u>perlio.c</u> in the core,
       and 5.003_02 pumpking, died of a heart attack on 25th September 2006. He will be missed.

</pre><h4><b>Acknowledgements</b></h4><pre>
       Some of the work in this release was funded by a TPF grant.

       Steve Hay worked behind the scenes working out the causes of the differences between core modules,  their
       CPAN  releases,  and  previous  core releases, and the best way to rectify them. He doesn't want to do it
       again. I know this feeling, and I'm very glad he did it this time, instead of me.

       Paul Fenwick assembled a team of 18  volunteers,  who  broke  the  back  of  writing  this  document.  In
       particular, Bradley Dean, Eddy Tan, and Vincent Pit provided half the team's contribution.

       Schwern  verified the list of updated module versions, correcting quite a few errors that I (and everyone
       else) had missed, both wrongly stated module versions, and changed modules that had not been listed.

       The crack Berlin-based QA team of Andreas König and Slaven Rezic tirelessly  re-built  snapshots,  tested
       most  everything  CPAN  against  them,  and  then  identified  the  changes  responsible  for  any module
       regressions, ensuring that several show-stopper bugs were stomped before the first release candidate  was
       cut.

       The other core committers contributed most of the changes, and applied most of the patches sent in by the
       hundreds of contributors listed in <u>AUTHORS</u>.

       And obviously, Larry Wall, without whom we wouldn't have Perl.

       If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the <b>perlbug</b> program included with your release.  Be
       sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of
       "perl  -V", will be sent off to <a href="mailto:perlbug@perl.org">perlbug@perl.org</a> to be analysed by the Perl porting team.  You can browse
       and search the Perl 5 bugs at <a href="http://bugs.perl.org/">http://bugs.perl.org/</a>

       If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make it inappropriate to send to a publicly
       archived mailing list, then please send it to <a href="mailto:perl5-security-report@perl.org">perl5-security-report@perl.org</a>. This  points  to  a  closed
       subscription  unarchived  mailing  list, which includes all the core committers, who will be able to help
       assess the impact of issues, figure out a resolution, and help co-ordinate  the  release  of  patches  to
       mitigate or fix the problem across all platforms on which Perl is supported. Please only use this address
       for security issues in the Perl core, not for modules independently distributed on CPAN.
