</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       perl586delta - what is new for perl v5.8.6

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This document describes differences between the 5.8.5 release and the 5.8.6 release.

</pre><h4><b>Incompatible</b> <b>Changes</b></h4><pre>
       There are no changes incompatible with 5.8.5.

</pre><h4><b>Core</b> <b>Enhancements</b></h4><pre>
       The perl interpreter is now more tolerant of UTF-16-encoded scripts.

       On Win32, Perl can now use non-IFS compatible LSPs, which allows Perl to work in conjunction with
       firewalls such as McAfee Guardian. For full details see the file <u>README.win32</u>, particularly if you're
       running Win95.

</pre><h4><b>Modules</b> <b>and</b> <b>Pragmata</b></h4><pre>
       •   With  the "base" pragma, an intermediate class with no fields used to messes up private fields in the
           base class. This has been fixed.

       •   Cwd upgraded to version 3.01 (as part of the new PathTools distribution)

       •   Devel::PPPort upgraded to version 3.03

       •   File::Spec upgraded to version 3.01 (as part of the new PathTools distribution)

       •   Encode upgraded to version 2.08

       •   ExtUtils::MakeMaker remains at version 6.17, as later stable releases  currently  available  on  CPAN
           have some issues with core modules on some core platforms.

       •   I18N::LangTags upgraded to version 0.35

       •   Math::BigInt upgraded to version 1.73

       •   Math::BigRat upgraded to version 0.13

       •   MIME::Base64 upgraded to version 3.05

       •   POSIX::sigprocmask function can now retrieve the current signal mask without also setting it.

       •   Time::HiRes upgraded to version 1.65

</pre><h4><b>Utility</b> <b>Changes</b></h4><pre>
       Perl has a new -dt command-line flag, which enables threads support in the debugger.

</pre><h4><b>Performance</b> <b>Enhancements</b></h4><pre>
       "reverse  sort  ..."  is  now  optimized  to  sort  in  reverse,  avoiding  the generation of a temporary
       intermediate list.

       "for (reverse @foo)" now iterates in reverse, avoiding the generation of a temporary reversed list.

</pre><h4><b>Selected</b> <b>Bug</b> <b>Fixes</b></h4><pre>
       The regexp engine is now more robust when given invalid utf8 input, as is sometimes generated by buggy XS
       modules.

       "foreach" on threads::shared array used to be able to crash Perl. This bug has now been fixed.

       A regexp in "STDOUT"'s destructor used to coredump, because the regexp pad was already  freed.  This  has
       been fixed.

       "goto &amp;" is now more robust - bugs in deep recursion and chained "goto &amp;" have been fixed.

       Using  "delete"  on  an array no longer leaks memory. A "pop" of an item from a shared array reference no
       longer causes a leak.

       eval_sv() failing a taint test could corrupt the stack - this has been fixed.

       On platforms with 64 bit pointers numeric comparison operators used to erroneously compare the  addresses
       of references that are overloaded, rather than using the overloaded values. This has been fixed.

       "read"  into  a  UTF8-encoded  buffer  with  an offset off the end of the buffer no longer mis-calculates
       buffer lengths.

       Although Perl has promised since version 5.8 that sort() would be stable, the two  cases  "sort  {$b  cmp
       $a}" and "sort {$b &lt;=&gt; $a}" could produce non-stable sorts.   This is corrected in perl5.8.6.

       Localising $^D no longer generates a diagnostic message about valid -D flags.

</pre><h4><b>New</b> <b>or</b> <b>Changed</b> <b>Diagnostics</b></h4><pre>
       For -t and -T,
          Too late for "-T" option has been changed to the more informative
          "-T" is on the #! line, it must also be used on the command line

</pre><h4><b>Changed</b> <b>Internals</b></h4><pre>
       From   now   on   all   applications   embedding   perl  will  behave  as  if  perl  were  compiled  with
       -DPERL_USE_SAFE_PUTENV.  See "Environment access" in the <u>INSTALL</u> file for details.

       Most "C" source files now have comments at the top explaining their purpose,  which  should  help  anyone
       wishing to get an overview of the implementation.

</pre><h4><b>New</b> <b>Tests</b></h4><pre>
       There are significantly more tests for the "B" suite of modules.

</pre><h4><b>Reporting</b> <b>Bugs</b></h4><pre>
       If  you  find  what  you  think  is  a  bug,  you  might  check  the  articles  recently  posted  to  the
       comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug database  at  <a href="http://bugs.perl.org">http://bugs.perl.org</a>.   There  may  also  be
       information at <a href="http://www.perl.org">http://www.perl.org</a>, the Perl Home Page.

       If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the <b>perlbug</b> program included with your release.  Be
       sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of
       "perl  -V", will be sent off to <a href="mailto:perlbug@perl.org">perlbug@perl.org</a> to be analysed by the Perl porting team.  You can browse
       and search the Perl 5 bugs at <a href="http://bugs.perl.org/">http://bugs.perl.org/</a>
