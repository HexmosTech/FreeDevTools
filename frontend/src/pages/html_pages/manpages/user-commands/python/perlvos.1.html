       perlvos - Perl for Stratus OpenVOS

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       This file contains notes for building perl on the Stratus OpenVOS operating system.  Perl is a scripting
       or macro language that is popular on many systems.  See perlbook for a number of good books on Perl.

       These are instructions for building Perl from source.  This version of Perl requires the dynamic linking
       support that is found in OpenVOS Release 17.1 and thus is not supported on OpenVOS Release 17.0 or
       earlier releases.

       If you are running VOS Release 14.4.1 or later, you can obtain a pre-compiled, supported copy of perl by
       purchasing the GNU Tools product from Stratus Technologies.

</pre><h4><b>BUILDING</b> <b>PERL</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>OPENVOS</b></h4><pre>
       To build perl from its source code on the Stratus V Series platform you must have OpenVOS Release 17.1.0
       or later, GNU Tools Release 3.5 or later, and the C/POSIX Runtime Libraries.

       Follow the normal instructions for building perl; e.g, enter bash, run the Configure script, then use
       "gmake" to build perl.

</pre><h4><b>INSTALLING</b> <b>PERL</b> <b>IN</b> <b>OPENVOS</b></h4><pre>
       1.  After  you  have built perl using the Configure script, ensure that you have modify and default write
           permission to "&gt;system&gt;ported" and all subdirectories.  Then type

                gmake install

       2.  While there are currently no architecture-specific extensions or modules distributed with  perl,  the
           following  directories  can be used to hold such files (replace the string VERSION by the appropriate
           version number):

                &gt;system&gt;ported&gt;lib&gt;perl5&gt;VERSION&gt;i786

       3.  Site-specific perl extensions and modules can be installed in one of two places.   Put  architecture-
           independent files into:

                &gt;system&gt;ported&gt;lib&gt;perl5&gt;site_perl&gt;VERSION

           Put site-specific architecture-dependent files into one of the following directories:

                &gt;system&gt;ported&gt;lib&gt;perl5&gt;site_perl&gt;VERSION&gt;i786

       4.  You  can examine the @INC variable from within a perl program to see the order in which Perl searches
           these directories.

</pre><h4><b>USING</b> <b>PERL</b> <b>IN</b> <b>OPENVOS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Restrictions</b> <b>of</b> <b>Perl</b> <b>on</b> <b>OpenVOS</b>
       This port of Perl version 5 prefers Unix-style, slash-separated  pathnames  over  OpenVOS-style  greater-
       than-separated pathnames.  OpenVOS-style pathnames should work in most contexts, but if you have trouble,
       replace  all  greater-than  characters  by  slash  characters.   Because the slash character is used as a
       pathname delimiter, Perl cannot process OpenVOS pathnames containing a slash character in a directory  or
       file name; these must be renamed.

       This  port  of  Perl  also uses Unix-epoch date values internally.  As long as you are dealing with ASCII
       character string representations of dates, this should not be an issue.  The supported epoch  is  January
       1, 1980 to January 17, 2038.

       See the file pod/perlport.pod for more information about the OpenVOS port of Perl.

</pre><h4><b>TEST</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       A  number  of  the perl self-tests fails for various reasons; generally these are minor and due to subtle
       differences between common POSIX-based environments and the OpenVOS POSIX environment.  Ensure  that  you
       conduct sufficient testing of your code to guarantee that it works properly in the OpenVOS environment.

</pre><h4><b>SUPPORT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       I'm  offering  this port "as is".  You can ask me questions, but I can't guarantee I'll be able to answer
       them.  There are some excellent books available on the Perl language; consult a book seller.

       If you want a supported version of perl for OpenVOS, purchase the OpenVOS GNU Tools product from  Stratus
       Technologies, along with a support contract (or from anyone else who will sell you support).
