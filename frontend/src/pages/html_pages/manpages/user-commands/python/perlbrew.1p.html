</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       PERLBREW_ROOT
           By  default,  perlbrew builds and installs perls into "$ENV{HOME}/perl5/perlbrew" directory. To use a
           different directory, set this environment variable in your "bashrc" to the directory in your shell RC
           before sourcing perlbrew's RC.

           It is possible to share one perlbrew root with multiple user account on the same  machine.  Therefore
           people  do  not  have to install the same version of perl over an over. Let's say "/opt/perl5" is the
           directory we want to share. All users should be able append this snippet to their bashrc to  make  it
           effective:

               export PERLBREW_ROOT=/opt/perl5
               source ${PERLBREW_ROOT}/etc/bashrc

           After      doing      so,     everyone's     PATH     should     include     "/opt/perl5/bin"     and
           "/opt/perl5/perls/${PERLBREW_PERL}<a href="file:/bin">/bin</a>". Each user can invoke "perlbrew switch" and "perlbrew use" to
           independently switch to different perl environment of their choice. However, only the user with write
           permission to $PERLBREW_ROOT may install CPAN modules. This is both good and  bad  depending  on  the
           working convention of your team.

           If  you wish to install CPAN modules only for yourself, you should use the "lib" command to construct
           a personal local::lib environment. local::lib environments are personal, and are not  shared  between
           different users. For more detail, read "perlbrew help lib" and the documentation of local::lib.

           If  you  want  even  a  cooler  module  isolation  and wish to install CPAN modules used for just one
           project, you should use carton for this purpose.

           It is also possible to set this variable before installing perlbrew to make perlbrew  install  itself
           under the given PERLBREW_ROOT:

               export PERLBREW_ROOT=/opt/perl5
               curl -L https://install.perlbrew.pl | bash

           After doing this, the perlbrew executable is installed as "/opt/perl5/bin/perlbrew"

       PERLBREW_HOME
           By  default, perlbrew stores per-user setting to "$ENV{HOME}/.perlbrew" directory. To use a different
           directory, set this environment variable in your shell RC before sourcing perlbrew's RC.

           In some cases, say, your home directory is on NFS and shared across multiple machines, you  may  wish
           to  have  several  different  perlbrew setting per-machine. To do so, you can use the "PERLBREW_HOME"
           environment variable to tell perlbrew where to look for the initialization file. Here's a brief  bash
           snippet for the given scenario.

               if [ "$(hostname)" == "machine-a" ]; then
                   export PERLBREW_HOME=<a href="file:~/.perlbrew-a">~/.perlbrew-a</a>
               elif [ "$(hostname)" == "machine-b" ]; then
                   export PERLBREW_HOME=<a href="file:~/.perlbrew-b">~/.perlbrew-b</a>
               fi

               source <a href="file:~/perl5/perlbrew/etc/bashrc">~/perl5/perlbrew/etc/bashrc</a>

       PERLBREW_CONFIGURE_FLAGS
           This  environment  variable specify the list of command like flags to pass through to 'sh Configure'.
           By default it is '-de'.

       PERLBREW_CPAN_MIRROR
           The CPAN mirror url of your choice. By default, "https://cpan.metacpan.org" is used.

</pre><h4><b>COMMAND:</b> <b>INIT</b></h4><pre>
       Usage: perlbrew init

       The "init" command should be manually invoked whenever you  (the  perlbrew  user)  upgrade  or  reinstall
       perlbrew.

       If  the  upgrade is done with "self-upgrade" command, or by running the one-line installer manually, this
       command is invoked automatically.

</pre><h4><b>COMMAND:</b> <b>INFO</b></h4><pre>
       <b>info</b> [module]
           Usage: perlbrew info [ &lt;module&gt; ]

           Display useful information about the perlbrew installation.

           If a module is given the version and location of the module is displayed.

</pre><h4><b>COMMAND:</b> <b>INSTALL</b></h4><pre>
       Usage:

           perlbrew install [options] &lt;perl-release&gt;
           perlbrew install [options] /path/to/perl-5.14.0.tar.gz
           perlbrew install [options] /path/to/perl/git/checkout/dir
           perlbrew install [options] https://example.com/mirror/perl-5.12.3.tar.gz

       Build and install the wanted perl. The last argument can be a short string designating a specific version
       which can be known from the output of "perlbrew available", a path to a pre-downloaded tarball, a path to
       a git-checkout of perl5 repo, or a URL to a tarball.

       The format of &lt;perl-release&gt; looks like:

       perl-&lt;version&gt;
       perl-stable
       perl-blead
       &lt;version&gt;
       stable
       blead

       Version numbers usually look like "5.x.xx", or "perl-5.xx.x-RCx" for release candidates.

       Version "stable" is a special token that means whatever the latest stable version is at the moment.

       Version "blead" is also a special token that means whatever the latest version in the  repository,  which
       is downloaded from this specific URL regardless of mirror settings:

           https://github.com/Perl/perl5/archive/blead.tar.gz

       The  specified  perl  is  downloaded  from  the  official CPAN website or from the mirror site configured
       before.

       Version number alone without the "perl-" prefix means the official release provided by perl5 porters.

       Options for "install" command:

           -f --force     Force installation
           -j $n          Parallel building and testing. ex. C&lt;perlbrew install -j 5 perl-5.14.2&gt;
           -n --notest    Skip testing

              --switch    Automatically switch to this Perl once successfully
                          installed, as if with `perlbrew switch &lt;version&gt;`

              --as        Install the given version of perl by a name.
                          ex. C&lt;perlbrew install perl-5.6.2 --as legacy-perl&gt;

              --noman     Skip installation of manpages

              --thread    Build perl with usethreads enabled
              --multi     Build perl with usemultiplicity enabled
              --64int     Build perl with use64bitint enabled
              --64all     Build perl with use64bitall enabled
              --ld        Build perl with uselongdouble enabled
              --debug     Build perl with DEBUGGING enabled
              --clang     Build perl using the clang compiler
              --no-patchperl
                          Skip calling patchperl

           -D,-U,-A       Switches passed to perl Configure script.
                          ex. C&lt;perlbrew install perl-5.10.1 -D usemymalloc -U versiononly&gt;

           --destdir $path
                          Install perl as per 'make install DESTDIR=$path'

           --sitecustomize $filename
                          Specify a file to be installed as sitecustomize.pl

           --mirror $URL
               Specify a CPAN-mirror URL. The default value of this is "https://www.cpan.org"

       By default, all installations are configured after their name like this:

           sh Configure -de -Dprefix=$PERLBREW_ROOT/perls/&lt;name&gt;

</pre><h4><b>COMMAND:</b> <b>INSTALL-MULTIPLE</b></h4><pre>
       Usage: perlbrew install-multiple [options] &lt;perl-version-1&gt; &lt;perl-version-2&gt; ...

       Build and install the given versions of perl.

       "install-multiple" accepts the same set of options as the command "install" plus the following ones:

           --both $flavor       Where $flavor is one of C&lt;thread&gt;, C&lt;multi&gt;, C&lt;ld&gt;,
                                C&lt;64int&gt;, C&lt;64all&gt;, C&lt;debug&gt; and C&lt;clang&gt;.

                                For every given perl version, install two
                                flavors, one with the flag C&lt;--$flavor&gt; set
                                and the other with out. C&lt;--both&gt; can be
                                passed multiple times with different values
                                and in that case, all the possible
                                combinations are generated.

           --common-variations  equivalent to C&lt;--both thread --both ld --both 64int&gt;

           --all-variations     generates all the possible flavor combinations

           --append $string     Appends the given string to the generated names

       For instance:

           perlbrew install-multiple 5.18.0 blead --both thread --both debug

       Installs the following perls:

           perl-blead
           perl-blead-debug
           perl-blead-thread-multi
           perl-blead-thread-multi-debug
           perl-5.18.0
           perl-5.18.0-debug
           perl-5.18.0-thread-multi
           perl-5.18.0-thread-multi-debug

       (note that the "multi" flavor is selected automatically because "thread" requires it)

       Another example using custom compilation flags:

           perlbrew install-multiple 5.18.0 --both thread -Doptimize='-O3' --append='-O3'

</pre><h4><b>COMMAND:</b> <b>UNINSTALL</b></h4><pre>
       Usage: perlbrew uninstall &lt;name&gt;

       Uninstalls the given perl installation. The name is the installation name as in the output  of  `perlbrew
       list`. This effectively deletes the specified perl installation, and all libs associated with it.

</pre><h4><b>COMMAND:</b> <b>USE</b></h4><pre>
       Usage: perlbrew <b>use</b> [perl-&lt;version&gt; | &lt;version&gt; | &lt;name&gt;]

       Use the given version perl in current shell. This will not effect newly opened shells.

       Without a parameter, shows the version of perl currently in use.

</pre><h4><b>COMMAND:</b> <b>SWITCH</b></h4><pre>
       Usage: perlbrew switch [ &lt;name&gt; ]

       Switch to the given version, and makes it the default for this and all future terminal sessions.

       Without a parameter, shows the version of perl currently selected.

</pre><h4><b>COMMAND:</b> <b>LIST</b></h4><pre>
       Usage: perlbrew list

       List  all  perl  installations  inside perlbrew root specified by $PERLBREW_ROOT environment variable. By
       default, the value is "<a href="file:~/perl5/perlbrew">~/perl5/perlbrew</a>".

       If there are libs associated to some perl installations, they will be included as part of the  name.  The
       output items in this list can be the argument in various other commands.

</pre><h4><b>COMMAND:</b> <b>AVAILABLE</b></h4><pre>
       Usage: perlbrew available [--all]

       List the recently available versions of perl on CPAN.

       By default, the latest sub-version of each stable versions are listed.

       To  get  a  list  of all perls ever released, inculding development and RC versions, run the command with
       "--all" option.

</pre><h4><b>COMMAND:</b> <b>OFF</b></h4><pre>
       Usage: perlbrew off

       Temporarily disable perlbrew in the current  shell.  Effectively  re-enables  the  default  system  Perl,
       whatever that is.

       This  command  works  only  if  you add the statement of `source $PERLBREW_ROOT/etc/bashrc` in your shell
       initialization (bashrc / zshrc).

</pre><h4><b>COMMAND:</b> <b>SWITCH-OFF</b></h4><pre>
       Usage: perlbrew switch-off

       Permananently disable perlbrew. Use "switch" command to re-enable it. Invoke "use" command to  enable  it
       only in the current shell.

       Re-enables the default system Perl, whatever that is.

</pre><h4><b>COMMAND:</b> <b>ALIAS</b></h4><pre>
       Usage: perlbrew alias [-f] create &lt;name&gt; &lt;alias&gt;

           Create an alias for the installation named &lt;name&gt;.

       Usage: perlbrew alias [-f] rename &lt;old_alias&gt; &lt;new_alias&gt;

           Rename the alias to a new name.

       Usage: perlbrew alias delete &lt;alias&gt;

           Delete the given alias.

</pre><h4><b>COMMAND:</b> <b>EXEC</b></h4><pre>
       Usage: perlbrew exec [options] &lt;command&gt; &lt;args...&gt;

       Options for "exec" command:

           --with perl-version,... - only use these versions
           --min n.nnnnn           - minimum perl version
                                     (format is the same as in 'use 5.012')
           --max n.nnnnn           - maximum perl version
           --halt-on-error         - stop on first nonzero exit status

       Execute command for each perl installations, one by one.

       For example, run a Hello program:

           perlbrew exec perl -e 'print "Hello from $]\n"'

       The output looks like this:

           perl-5.12.2
           ==========
           Hello word from perl-5.012002

           perl-5.13.10
           ==========
           Hello word from perl-5.013010

           perl-5.14.0
           ==========
           Hello word from perl-5.014000

       Notice that the command is not executed in parallel.

       When  "--with"  argument  is  provided,  the  command  will  be  only  executed  with  the specified perl
       installations. The following command install Moose module into perl-5.12, regardless the current perl:

           perlbrew exec --with perl-5.12 cpanm Moose

       Multiple installation names can be provided:

           perlbrew exec --with perl-5.12,perl-5.12-debug,perl-5.14.2 cpanm Moo

       They are split by either spaces or commas. When spaces are used,  it  is  required  to  quote  the  whole
       specification as one argument, but then commas can be used in the installation names:

           perlbrew exec --with '5.12 5.12,debug 5.14.2@nobita @shizuka' cpanm Moo

       As  demonstrated  above, "perl-" prefix can be omitted, and lib names can be specified too. Lib names can
       appear without a perl installation name, in such cases it is assumed to be "current perl".

       At the moment, any specified names that fails to be resolved as a real installation  names  are  silently
       ignored in the output. Also, the command exit status are not populated back.

</pre><h4><b>COMMAND:</b> <b>ENV</b></h4><pre>
       Usage: perlbrew env [ &lt;name&gt; ]

       Low-level  command.  Invoke  this  command  to  see  the  list  of  environment variables that are set by
       "perlbrew" itself for shell integration.

       The output is something similar to this (if your shell is bash/zsh):

           export PERLBREW_ROOT=/Users/gugod/perl5/perlbrew
           export PERLBREW_VERSION=0.31
           export PERLBREW_PATH=/Users/gugod/perl5/perlbrew/bin:/Users/gugod/perl5/perlbrew/perls/current/bin
           export PERLBREW_PERL=perl-5.14.1

       tcsh / csh users should see 'setenv' statements instead of `export`.

</pre><h4><b>COMMAND:</b> <b>SYMLINK-EXECUTABLES</b></h4><pre>
       Usage: perlbrew symlink-executables [ &lt;name&gt; ]

       Low-level command. This command  is  used  to  create  the  "perl"  executable  symbolic  link  to,  say,
       "perl5.13.6". This is only required for development version of perls.

       You don't need to do this unless you have been using old perlbrew to install perls, and you find yourself
       confused because the perl that you just installed appears to be missing after invoking `use` or `switch`.
       perlbrew changes its installation layout since version 0.11, which generates symlinks to executables in a
       better way.

       If  you just upgraded perlbrew (from 0.11 or earlier versions) and "perlbrew switch" failed to work after
       you switch to a development release of perl, say, perl-5.13.6, run this command:

           perlbrew symlink-executables perl-5.13.6

       This essentially creates this symlink:

          ${PERLBREW_ROOT}/perls/perl-5.13.6/bin/perl
          -&gt; ${PERLBREW_ROOT}/perls/perl-5.13.6/bin/perl5.13.6

       Newly installed perls, whether they are development versions or not, does  not  need  manually  treatment
       with this command.

</pre><h4><b>COMMAND:</b> <b>INSTALL-CPANM</b></h4><pre>
       Usage: perlbrew install-cpanm

       Install the "cpanm" standalone executable in "$PERLBREW_ROOT/bin".

       For      more      rationale      about      the      existence      of      this      command,      read
       &lt;https://perlbrew.pl/Perlbrew-and-Friends.html&gt;

       Usage: perlbrew install-cpm

       Install the "cpm" standalone executable in "$PERLBREW_ROOT/bin".

</pre><h4><b>COMMAND:</b> <b>INSTALL-PATCHPERL</b></h4><pre>
       Usage: perlbrew install-patchperl

       Install the "patchperl" standalone executable in "$PERLBREW_ROOT/bin".  This is automatically invoked  if
       your perlbrew installation is done with the installer, but not with cpan.

       For      more      rationale      about      the      existence      of      this      command,      read
       &lt;https://perlbrew.pl/Perlbrew-and-Friends.html&gt;

</pre><h4><b>COMMAND:</b> <b>SELF-UPGRADE</b></h4><pre>
       Usage: perlbrew self-upgrade

       This command upgrades Perlbrew to its latest version.

</pre><h4><b>COMMAND:</b> <b>SELF-INSTALL</b></h4><pre>
       Usage: perlbrew self-install

       NOTICE: You should not need to run this command in your daily routine.

       This command installs perlbrew itself to "$PERLBREW_ROOT/bin". It is intended to be used by the  perlbrew
       installer. However, you could manually do the following to re-install only the "perlbrew" executable:

           curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gugod/App-perlbrew/master/perlbrew -o perlbrew
           perl ./perlbrew self-install

       It is slightly different from running the perlbrew installer because "patchperl" is not installed in this
       case.

</pre><h4><b>COMMAND:</b> <b>CLEAN</b></h4><pre>
       Usage: perlbrew clean

       Removes all previously downloaded Perl tarballs and build directories.

</pre><h4><b>COMMAND:</b> <b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       Usage: perlbrew version

       Show the version of perlbrew.

</pre><h4><b>COMMAND:</b> <b>LIB</b></h4><pre>
       Usage: perlbrew lib &lt;action&gt; &lt;lib-name&gt;

           perlbrew lib list
           perlbrew lib create &lt;lib-name&gt;
           perlbrew lib delete &lt;lib-name&gt;

       The  `lib`  command  is  used to manipulate local::lib roots inside perl installations. Effectively it is
       similar to `perl -Mlocal::lib=/path/to/lib-name`, but a little bit more than just that.

       A lib name can be a short name, containing alphanumeric, like 'awesome', or a full name,  prefixed  by  a
       perl installation name and a '@' sign, for example, 'perl-5.14.2@awesome'.

       Here are some a brief examples to invoke the `lib` command:

           # Create lib perl-5.12.3@shizuka
           perlbrew lib create perl-5.12.3@shizuka

           # Create lib perl-5.14.2@nobita and perl-5.14.2@shizuka
           perlbrew use perl-5.14.2
           perlbrew lib create nobita
           perlbrew lib create shizuka

           # See the list of use/switch targets
           perlbrew list

           # Activate a lib in current shell
           perlbrew use perl-5.12.3@shizuka
           perlbrew use perl-5.14.2@nobita
           perlbrew use perl-5.14.2@shizuka

           # Activate a lib as default
           perlbrew switch perl-5.12.3@shizuka
           perlbrew switch perl-5.14.2@nobita
           perlbrew switch perl-5.14.2@shizuka

           # Delete lib perl-5.14.2@nobita and perl-5.14.2@shizuka
           perlbrew use perl-5.14.2
           perlbrew lib delete nobita
           perlbrew lib delete shizuka

           # Delete lib perl-5.12.3@shizuka
           perlbrew lib delete perl-5.12.3@shizuka

       Short  lib  names  are  local  to  current perl. A lib name 'nobita' can refer to 'perl-5.12.3@nobita' or
       'perl-5.14.2@nobita', whichever is activated in the current shell.

       When "use"ing or "switch"ing to a lib, always provide the long name. A simple rule: the argument to "use"
       or "switch" command should appear in the output of "perlbrew list".

</pre><h4><b>COMMAND:</b> <b>UPGRADE-PERL</b></h4><pre>
       Usage: perlbrew upgrade-perl

       Running this command upgrades the currently activated perl to its latest released brothers. If you have a
       shell with 5.32.0 activated, it upgrades it to 5.32.1.

       Minor Perl releases (ex. 5.x.*) are binary compatible with one another, so this command  offers  you  the
       ability to upgrade older perlbrew environments in place.

</pre><h4><b>COMMAND:</b> <b>DOWNLOAD</b></h4><pre>
       Usage:
           perlbrew download &lt;perl-release&gt;

       Examples:
           perlbrew download perl-5.14.2
           perlbrew download perl-5.16.1
           perlbrew download perl-5.17.3

       Download the specified version of perl distribution tarball under the directory "$PERLBREW_ROOT/dists/".

       The argument "perl-release" should be one of the items from "perlbrew available" command.

</pre><h4><b>COMMAND:</b> <b>LIST-MODULES</b></h4><pre>
       Usage:
           perlbrew list-modules

       List all installed cpan modules for the current perl.

       This  command  can  be  used  in  conjunction with `perlbrew exec` to migrate your module installation to
       different perl. The following command re-installs all modules under perl-5.16.0:

           perlbrew list-modules | perlbrew exec --with perl-5.16.0 cpanm

       Note that this installs the <u>latest</u> versions  of  the  Perl  modules  on  the  new  perl,  which  are  not
       necessarily the <u>same</u> module versions you had installed previously.

</pre><h4><b>COMMAND:</b> <b>CLONE-MODULES</b></h4><pre>
       Usage:

           perlbrew clone-modules [options] &lt;destination&gt;
           perlbrew clone-modules [options] &lt;source&gt; &lt;destination&gt;

       Options:

           --notest    Skip all module tests

       This command re-installs all CPAN modules found from one installation to another. For example, this lists
       all modules under '5.26.1' and re-installs them under '5.27.7':

           perlbrew clone-modules 5.26.1 5.27.7

       The  argument  "source"  is  optional  and  defaults  to  the currently activated one. However if none is
       activated (perlbrew is switched off), it is an error.

       Note that this does not guarantee that the versions of modules stay the same in the destination.

</pre><h4><b>COMMAND:</b> <b>MAKE-SHIM</b></h4><pre>
       Usage:

           perlbrew make-shim &lt;program&gt;
           perlbrew make-shim -o &lt;shim-name&gt; &lt;program&gt;
           perlbrew make-shim --output &lt;shim-name&gt; &lt;program&gt;

       This commands produce an executable file under current directory named "program", or "shim-name" if given
       after "--output" (or "-o" for short). The output is a shell-wrapper, a shim, of the named program  inside
       current perlbrew environment.

       When the shim is executed, the original "program" is then executed with all relevant environment variable
       set  to  the  perlbrew environment it is installed in, regardless which perlbrew environment is currently
       activated. The  shim  can  also  be  moved  to  different  directories  and,  such  as  the  conventional
       "<a href="file:~/.local/bin">~/.local/bin</a>", so it is always available.

       For  example,  you may find "tldr" from App::tldr a handy tool and decide to install it inside your daily
       working environment:

           perlbrew use perl-5.36.1
           cpm install -g App::tldr

       But when you occasionally have to switch to a different environment, "PATH"  would  be  tweaked  and  the
       command "tldr" would went missing, and that is the expected outcome:

           perlbrew use perl-5.18.4
           tldr perl  #=&gt; error: command not found

       It  would  be  nice  if  "tldr"  can  be made universally available. One way to mitigate such needs is to
       prepare install the "tldr" program outside of "PERLBREW_ROOT", while still utilize  perlbrew  environment
       to run it.

       For example, prepare a conventional directory "<a href="file:~/.local/bin">~/.local/bin</a>" and put that in "PATH", then:

           perlbrew use perl-5.36.1

           cd <a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a>
           perlbrew make-shim tldr
           mv /tmp/tldr <a href="file:~/.local/bin/tldr">~/.local/bin/tldr</a>

       This "<a href="file:~/.local/bin/tldr">~/.local/bin/tldr</a>" is a shell-wrapper of the actual "tldr" program, and it internally activates the
       perlbrew  environment  "perl-5.36.1".  Running  the  tldr shim will then always run the actual "tldr", no
       matter which perlbrew environment is activated, or even if perlbrew is turned off. The only  requirements
       is that the perlbrew environment "perl-5.36.1" and the installation of "App::tldr" has to remain.

</pre><h4><b>COMMAND:</b> <b>MAKE-PP</b></h4><pre>
       Usage:

           perlbrew make-pp -i &lt;path&gt; -o &lt;path&gt;
           perlbrew make-pp --input &lt;path&gt; --output &lt;path&gt;

       This command takes a path of a perl program (the input), and produce a PAR-packed version of that program
       to  the  specified  path  (the output). Essentially this is a wrapper of "pp" from PAR::Packer, hence the
       name.

       This requires the current perlbrew environment to have PAR and  PAR::Packer  installed  first.  Otherwise
       "make-pp"  bails  out.  In  addition, if the current perl is not a perlbrew-managed perl, or if the given
       output path is already occupied, &lt;make-pp&gt; also bails out.

       The produced file is a standalone binary executable containing these content:

           1. The input perl program
           2. perl runtime
           3. all core perl libs of current perl
           4. the entire site lib
           5. the entire local lib (managed by `perlbrew lib` command), if active.

       It is expected that the executable can then be running on a different machine of the same OS and arch.

       Noted that this approach is the maximum overkill for packing one program as it'll be definitely  packaing
       a  lot  more  then  the exact list of runtime dependencies of the named program. "make-pp" is meant for a
       lazy solution for a non-trivial problem of perfectly determing the runtime dependencies of an  arbitarary
       program.
