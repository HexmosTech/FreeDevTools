</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       perlamiga - Perl under AmigaOS 4.1

</pre><h4><b>NOTE</b></h4><pre>
       This is a port of Perl 5.22.1, it is a fresh port and not in any way compatible with my previous ports of
       Perl 5.8 and 5.16.3. This means you will need to reinstall / rebuild any third party modules you have
       installed.

       newlib.library version 53.28 or greater is required.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       Once perl is installed you can read this document in the following way

               sh -c "perldoc perlamiga"

       or you may read <u>as</u> <u>is</u>: either as <u>README.amiga</u>, or <u>pod/perlamiga.pod</u>.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Prerequisites</b> <b>for</b> <b>running</b> <b>Perl</b> <b>5.22.1</b> <b>under</b> <b>AmigaOS</b> <b>4.1</b>
       <b>AmigaOS</b> <b>4.1</b> <b>update</b> <b>6</b> <b>with</b> <b>all</b> <b>updates</b> <b>applied</b> <b>as</b> <b>of</b> <b>9th</b> <b>October</b> <b>2013</b>
             The most important of which is:

       <b>newlib.library</b> <b>version</b> <b>53.28</b> <b>or</b> <b>greater</b>
       <b>AmigaOS</b> <b>SDK</b>
             Perl  installs  into the SDK directory structure and expects many of the build tools present in the
             SDK to be available. So for the best results install the SDK first.

       <b>abc-shell</b>
             If you do not have the SDK installed you must at least  have  abc-shell  installed  or  some  other
             suitable sh port. This is required to run external commands and should be available as 'sh' in your
             path.

   <b>Starting</b> <b>Perl</b> <b>programs</b> <b>under</b> <b>AmigaOS</b> <b>4.1</b>
       Perl  may  be  run from the AmigaOS shell but for best results should be run under abc-shell.  (abc-shell
       handles file globbing, pattern expansion, and sets up environment variables in the UN*Xy  way  that  Perl
       expects.)

       For example:

               New Shell process 10
               10.AmigaOS4:&gt; sh
               /AmigaOS4&gt;perl path:to/myprog arg1 arrg2 arg3

       Abc-shell  can also launch programs via the #! syntax at the start of the program file, it's best use the
       form #!SDK:Local/C/perl so that the AmigaOS shell may also find perl in the same  way.  AmigaOS  requires
       the script bit to be set for this to work

               10.AmigaOS4:&gt; sh
               /AmigaOS4&gt;myprog arg1 arrg2 arg3

   <b>Limitations</b> <b>of</b> <b>Perl</b> <b>under</b> <b>AmigaOS</b> <b>4.1</b>
       <b>Nested</b> <b>Piped</b> <b>programs</b> <b>can</b> <b>crash</b> <b>when</b> <b>run</b> <b>from</b> <b>older</b> <b>abc-shells</b>
             abc-shell  version  53.2  has  a  bug  that can cause crashes in the subprocesses used to run piped
             programs, if a later version is available you should install it instead.

       <b>Incorrect</b> <b>or</b> <b>unexpected</b> <b>command</b> <b>line</b> <b>unescaping</b>
             newlib.library 53.30 and earlier incorrectly unescape slashed escape sequences e.g. \"  \n  \t  etc
             requiring unusual extra escaping.

       <b>Starting</b> <b>subprocesses</b> <b>via</b> <b>open</b> <b>has</b> <b>limitations</b>
                     open FH, "command |"

             Subprocesses  started with open use a minimal <b>popen()</b> routine and therefore they do not return pids
             usable with waitpid etc.

       If you find any other limitations or bugs then let me know.
             Please report bugs in this version of perl to <a href="mailto:andy@broad.ology.org.uk">andy@broad.ology.org.uk</a> in the first instance.

</pre><h4><b>INSTALLATION</b></h4><pre>
       This guide assumes you have obtained a prebuilt archive from os4depot.net.

       Unpack the main archive to a temporary location (RAM: is fine).

       Execute the provided install script from shell or via its icon.

       You <b>must</b> <b>not</b> attempt to install by hand.

       Once installed you may delete the temporary archive.

       This approach will preserve links in the installation without creating duplicate binaries.

       If you have the earlier ports perl 5.16 or 5.8 installed you may like to rename your perl  executable  to
       perl516 or perl58 or something similar before the installation of 5.22.1, this will allow you to use both
       versions at the same time.

</pre><h4><b>Amiga</b> <b>Specific</b> <b>Modules</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Amiga::ARexx</b>
       The  Amiga::ARexx module allows you to easily create a perl based ARexx host or to send ARexx commands to
       other programs.

       Try "perldoc Amiga::ARexx" for more info.

   <b>Amiga::Exec</b>
       The Amiga::Exec module introduces support for <b>Wait()</b>.

       Try "perldoc Amiga::Exec" for more info.

</pre><h4><b>BUILDING</b></h4><pre>
       To build perl under AmigaOS from the patched sources you will need to have a recent version of  the  SDK.
       Version 53.29 is recommended, earlier versions will probably work too.

       With  the  help  of Jarkko Hietaniemi the Configure system has been tweaked to run under abc-shell so the
       recommend build process is as follows.

               stack 2000000
               sh Configure -de
               gmake

       This will build the default setup that installs under SDK:local/newlib/lib/

</pre><h4><b>CHANGES</b></h4><pre>

             Fix exec, and exit in "forked" subprocesses.
             Fix issue with newlib's unlink, which could cause infinite loops.
             Add <b>flock()</b> emulation using IDOS-&gt;LockRecord thanks to Tony Cook for the suggestion.

       <b>27th</b> <b>November</b> <b>2013</b>
             Create new installation system based on installperl links and Amiga protection bits now set
             correctly.
             Pod now defaults to text.
             File::Spec should now recognise an Amiga style absolute path as well as an Unix style one. Relative
             paths must always be Unix style.
