</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The normal way to run a Perl program is by making it directly executable, or else by passing the name of
       the source file as an argument on the command line.  (An interactive Perl environment is also
       possible--see perldebug for details on how to do that.)  Upon startup, Perl looks for your program in one
       of the following places:

       1.  Specified line by line via -e or -E switches on the command line.

       2.  Contained  in  the  file  specified  by  the  first filename on the command line.  (Note that systems
           supporting the "#!" notation invoke interpreters this way. See "Location of Perl".)

       3.  Passed in implicitly via standard input.  This works only if there are no filename arguments--to pass
           arguments to a STDIN-read program you must explicitly specify a "-" for the program name.

       With methods 2 and 3, Perl starts parsing the input file from the beginning, unless  you've  specified  a
       "-x" switch, in which case it scans for the first line starting with "#!" and containing the word "perl",
       and  starts  there instead.  This is useful for running a program embedded in a larger message.  (In this
       case you would indicate the end of the program using the "__END__" token.)

       The "#!" line is always examined for switches as the line is being parsed.  Thus, if you're on a  machine
       that  allows  only  one  argument with the "#!" line, or worse, doesn't even recognize the "#!" line, you
       still can get consistent switch behaviour regardless of how Perl was invoked, even if "-x"  was  used  to
       find the beginning of the program.

       Because  historically  some operating systems silently chopped off kernel interpretation of the "#!" line
       after 32 characters, some switches may be passed in on the command line, and some may not; you could even
       get a "-" without its letter, if you're not careful.  You probably  want  to  make  sure  that  all  your
       switches  fall  either  before or after that 32-character boundary.  Most switches don't actually care if
       they're processed redundantly, but getting a "-" instead of a complete switch could cause Perl to try  to
       execute standard input instead of your program.  And a partial -I switch could also cause odd results.

       Some  switches  do  care if they are processed twice, for instance combinations of -l and -0.  Either put
       all the switches after the 32-character boundary (if applicable), or  replace  the  use  of  <b>-0</b><u>digits</u>  by
       "BEGIN{ $/ = "\0digits"; }".

       Parsing  of the "#!" switches starts wherever "perl" is mentioned in the line.  The sequences "-*" and "-
       " are specifically ignored so that you could, if you were so inclined, say

           #!<a href="file:/bin/sh">/bin/sh</a>
           #! -*- perl -*- -p
           eval 'exec perl -x -wS $0 ${1+"$@"}'
               if 0;

       to let Perl see the "-p" switch.

       A similar trick involves the <u>env</u> program, if you have it.

           #!<a href="file:///usr/lib/w3m/cgi-bin/w3mman2html.cgi?env">/usr/bin/env</a> perl

       The examples above use a relative path to the perl interpreter, getting whatever version is first in  the
       user's  path.  If you want a specific version of Perl, say, perl5.14.1, you should place that directly in
       the "#!" line's path.

       If the "#!" line does not contain the word "perl" nor the word "indir", the program named after the  "#!"
       is  executed  instead of the Perl interpreter.  This is slightly bizarre, but it helps people on machines
       that don't do "#!", because they can tell a program that their SHELL is <u><a href="file:///usr/lib/w3m/cgi-bin/w3mman2html.cgi?perl">/usr/bin/perl</a></u>, and Perl will then
       dispatch the program to the correct interpreter for them.

       After locating your program, Perl compiles the entire program to an internal  form.   If  there  are  any
       compilation errors, execution of the program is not attempted.  (This is unlike the typical shell script,
       which might run part-way through before finding a syntax error.)

       If the program is syntactically correct, it is executed.  If the program runs off the end without hitting
       an <b>exit()</b> or <b>die()</b> operator, an implicit <a href="../man0/exit.0.html">exit</a>(0) is provided to indicate successful completion.

   <b>#!</b> <b>and</b> <b>quoting</b> <b>on</b> <b>non-Unix</b> <b>systems</b>
       Unix's "#!" technique can be simulated on other systems:

       OS/2
           Put

               extproc perl -S -your_switches

           as the first line in "*.cmd" file ("-S" due to a bug in cmd.exe's `extproc' handling).

       MS-DOS
           Create  a batch file to run your program, and codify it in "ALTERNATE_SHEBANG" (see the <u>dosish.h</u> file
           in the source distribution for more information).

       Win95/NT
           The Win95/NT installation, when using the ActiveState installer for Perl, will modify the Registry to
           associate the <u>.pl</u> extension with the perl interpreter.  If you install Perl by other means (including
           building from the sources), you may have to modify the Registry yourself.  Note that this  means  you
           can no longer tell the difference between an executable Perl program and a Perl library file.

       VMS Put

            $ perl -mysw 'f$env("procedure")' 'p1' 'p2' 'p3' 'p4' 'p5' 'p6' 'p7' 'p8' !
            $ exit++ + ++$status != 0 and $exit = $status = undef;

           at  the top of your program, where <b>-mysw</b> are any command line switches you want to pass to Perl.  You
           can now invoke the program directly, by saying "perl program", or  as  a  DCL  procedure,  by  saying
           @program (or implicitly via <u>DCL$PATH</u> by just using the name of the program).

           This  incantation  is  a  bit  much  to  remember,  but Perl will display it for you if you say "perl
           "-V:startperl"".

       Command-interpreters on non-Unix systems have rather different ideas on quoting than Unix shells.  You'll
       need to learn the special characters in your command-interpreter ("*", "\" and """ are common) and how to
       protect whitespace and these characters to run one-liners (see -e below).

       On some systems, you may have to change single-quotes to double ones, which you must <u>not</u> do  on  Unix  or
       Plan 9 systems.  You might also have to change a single % to a %%.

       For example:

           # Unix
           perl -e 'print "Hello world\n"'

           # MS-DOS, etc.
           perl -e "print \"Hello world\n\""

           # VMS
           perl -e "print ""Hello world\n"""

       The  problem  is  that  none  of  this is reliable: it depends on the command and it is entirely possible
       neither works.  If <u>4DOS</u> were the command shell, this would probably work better:

           perl -e "print &lt;Ctrl-x&gt;"Hello world\n&lt;Ctrl-x&gt;""

       <b>CMD.EXE</b> in Windows NT slipped a lot of standard Unix functionality in when nobody was looking,  but  just
       try to find documentation for its quoting rules.

       There is no general solution to all of this.  It's just a mess.

   <b>Location</b> <b>of</b> <b>Perl</b>
       It  may  seem obvious to say, but Perl is useful only when users can easily find it.  When possible, it's
       good for both <u><a href="file:///usr/lib/w3m/cgi-bin/w3mman2html.cgi?perl">/usr/bin/perl</a></u> and <u>/usr/local/bin/perl</u> to be symlinks to the actual binary.  If  that  can't
       be  done,  system  administrators  are strongly encouraged to put (symlinks to) perl and its accompanying
       utilities into a directory typically found along a user's PATH, or in some other obvious  and  convenient
       place.

       In  this  documentation,  "#!<a href="file:///usr/lib/w3m/cgi-bin/w3mman2html.cgi?perl">/usr/bin/perl</a>"  on  the first line of the program will stand in for whatever
       method works on your system.  You are advised to use a  specific  path  if  you  care  about  a  specific
       version.

           #!/usr/local/bin/perl5.14

       or  if  you  just  want  to  be  running at least version, place a statement like this at the top of your
       program:

           use v5.14;

   <b>Command</b> <b>Switches</b>
       As with all standard commands, a single-character switch may be clustered with the following  switch,  if
       any.

           #!<a href="file:///usr/lib/w3m/cgi-bin/w3mman2html.cgi?perl">/usr/bin/perl</a> -spi.orig   # same as -s -p -i.orig

       A  "--"  signals  the end of options and disables further option processing. Any arguments after the "--"
       are treated as filenames and arguments.

       Switches include:

       <b>-0</b>[<u>octal/hexadecimal</u>]
            specifies the input record separator ($/) as an octal  or  hexadecimal  number.   If  there  are  no
            digits,  the null character is the separator.  Other switches may precede or follow the digits.  For
            example, if you have a version of <u>find</u> which can print filenames terminated by the  null  character,
            you can say this:

                find . -name '*.orig' -print0 | perl -n0e unlink

            The special value 00 will cause Perl to slurp files in paragraph mode.

            Any  value  0400  or above will cause Perl to slurp files whole, but by convention the value 0777 is
            the one normally used for this purpose. The "-g" flag is a simpler alias for it.

            You can also specify the separator character using hexadecimal notation: <b>-0x</b><u><b>HHH...</b></u>,  where  the  "<u>H</u>"
            are  valid  hexadecimal  digits.  Unlike the octal form, this one may be used to specify any Unicode
            character, even those beyond 0xFF.  So if you <u>really</u> want a record separator of 0777, specify it  as
            <b>-0x1FF</b>.   (This  means  that  you  cannot use the "-x" option with a directory name that consists of
            hexadecimal digits, or else Perl will think you have specified a hex number to <b>-0</b>.)

       <b>-a</b>   turns on autosplit mode when used with a "-n" or "-p".  An implicit split command to the @F array is
            done as the first thing inside the implicit while loop produced by the "-n" or "-p".

                perl -ane 'print pop(@F), "\n";'

            is equivalent to

                while (&lt;&gt;) {
                    @F = split(' ');
                    print pop(@F), "\n";
                }

            An alternate delimiter may be specified using -F.

            <b>-a</b> implicitly sets "-n".

       <b>-C</b> <b>[</b><u><b>number/list</b></u><b>]</b>
            The <b>-C</b> flag controls some of the Perl Unicode features.

            As of 5.8.1, the <b>-C</b> can be followed either by a number or a list of option  letters.   The  letters,
            their  numeric  values,  and  effects  are  as  follows; listing the letters is equal to summing the
            numbers.

                I     1   STDIN is assumed to be in UTF-8
                O     2   STDOUT will be in UTF-8
                E     4   STDERR will be in UTF-8
                S     7   I + O + E
                i     8   UTF-8 is the default PerlIO layer for input streams
                o    16   UTF-8 is the default PerlIO layer for output streams
                D    24   i + o
                A    32   the @ARGV elements are expected to be strings encoded
                          in UTF-8
                L    64   normally the "IOEioA" are unconditional, the L makes
                          them conditional on the locale environment variables
                          (the LC_ALL, LC_CTYPE, and LANG, in the order of
                          decreasing precedence) -- if the variables indicate
                          UTF-8, then the selected "IOEioA" are in effect
                a   256   Set ${^UTF8CACHE} to -1, to run the UTF-8 caching
                          code in debugging mode.

            For example, <b>-COE</b> and <b>-C6</b> will both turn on UTF-8-ness on both STDOUT and STDERR.  Repeating letters
            is just redundant, not cumulative nor toggling.

            The "io" options mean that any subsequent <b>open()</b> (or similar I/O operations) in main  program  scope
            will  have  the  ":utf8"  PerlIO layer implicitly applied to them, in other words, UTF-8 is expected
            from any input stream, and UTF-8 is produced to any output stream.  This is just the default set via
            "${^OPEN}", with explicit layers in <b>open()</b> and with <b>binmode()</b> one can manipulate streams  as  usual.
            This has no effect on code run in modules.

            <b>-C</b>  on  its  own  (not  followed  by  any  number  or  option  list), or the empty string "" for the
            "PERL_UNICODE" environment variable, has the same effect as <b>-CSDL</b>.  In other words, the standard I/O
            handles and the default open() layer are UTF-8-fied <u>but</u> only if  the  locale  environment  variables
            indicate  a  UTF-8 locale.  This behaviour follows the <u>implicit</u> (and problematic) UTF-8 behaviour of
            Perl 5.8.0.  (See "UTF-8 no longer default under UTF-8 locales" in perl581delta.)

            You can use <b>-C0</b> (or "0" for "PERL_UNICODE") to explicitly disable all the above Unicode features.

            The read-only magic variable "${^UNICODE}"  reflects  the  numeric  value  of  this  setting.   This
            variable  is  set during Perl startup and is thereafter read-only.  If you want runtime effects, use
            the three-arg <b>open()</b> (see "open" in perlfunc), the two-arg <b>binmode()</b> (see  "binmode"  in  perlfunc),
            and the "open" pragma (see open).

            (In  Perls earlier than 5.8.1 the <b>-C</b> switch was a Win32-only switch that enabled the use of Unicode-
            aware "wide system call" Win32 APIs.  This feature was practically unused, however, and the  command
            line switch was therefore "recycled".)

            <b>Note:</b>  Since  perl  5.10.1,  if  the <b>-C</b> option is used on the "#!" line, it must be specified on the
            command line as well, since the standard streams are already set up at this point in  the  execution
            of the perl interpreter.  You can also use <b>binmode()</b> to set the encoding of an I/O stream.

       <b>-c</b>   causes  Perl  to  check  the syntax of the program and then exit without executing it.  Actually, it
            <u>will</u> execute any "BEGIN", "UNITCHECK", or  "CHECK"  blocks  and  any  "use"  statements:  these  are
            considered  as  occurring  outside the execution of your program.  "INIT" and "END" blocks, however,
            will be skipped.

            If the syntax check is successful perl will exit with a  status  of  zero  and  report  "<u>yourprogram</u>
            syntax OK".  On failure perl will print any detected errors and exit with a non-zero status.

       <b>-d</b>
       <b>-dt</b>  runs  the  program  under the Perl debugger.  See perldebug.  If <b>t</b> is specified, it indicates to the
            debugger that threads will be used in the code being debugged.

       <b>-d:</b><u>MOD[=bar,baz]</u>
       <b>-dt:</b><u>MOD[=bar,baz]</u>
            runs the program under the control of  a  debugging,  profiling,  or  tracing  module  installed  as
            "Devel::<u>MOD</u>". E.g., <b>-d:DProf</b> executes the program using the "Devel::DProf" profiler.  As with the -M
            flag,  options may be passed to the "Devel::<u>MOD</u>" package where they will be received and interpreted
            by the "Devel::<u>MOD</u>::import" routine.  Again, like <b>-M</b>, use -<b>-d:-</b><u><b>MOD</b></u>  to  call  "Devel::<u>MOD</u>::unimport"
            instead  of  import.   The  comma-separated  list  of  options must follow a "=" character.  If <b>t</b> is
            specified, it indicates to the debugger that threads will be used in the code being  debugged.   See
            perldebug.

       <b>-D</b><u>letters</u>
       <b>-D</b><u>number</u>
            sets  debugging flags. This switch is enabled only if your perl binary has been built with debugging
            enabled: normal production perls won't have been.

            For example, to watch how perl executes your program, use <b>-Dtls</b>.  Another nice value is  <b>-Dx</b>,  which
            lists  your  compiled  syntax tree, and <b>-Dr</b> displays compiled regular expressions; the format of the
            output is explained in perldebguts.

            As an alternative, specify a number instead of list of letters (e.g., <b>-D14</b> is equivalent to <b>-Dtls</b>):

            All these flags require <b>-DDEBUGGING</b> when  you  compile  the  Perl  executable  (but  see  ":opd"  in
            Devel::Peek or "'debug' mode" in re which may change this).  See the INSTALL file in the Perl source
            distribution for how to do this.

            If  you're just trying to get a print out of each line of Perl code as it executes, the way that "sh
            -x" provides for shell scripts, you can't use Perl's <b>-D</b> switch.  Instead do this

              # If you have "env" utility
              env PERLDB_OPTS="NonStop=1 AutoTrace=1 frame=2" perl -dS program

              # Bourne shell syntax
              $ PERLDB_OPTS="NonStop=1 AutoTrace=1 frame=2" perl -dS program

              # csh syntax
              % (setenv PERLDB_OPTS "NonStop=1 AutoTrace=1 frame=2"; perl -dS program)

            See perldebug for details and variations.

       <b>-e</b> <u>commandline</u>
            may be used to enter one line of program.  If <b>-e</b> is given, Perl will not look for a filename in  the
            argument list.  Multiple <b>-e</b> commands may be given to build up a multi-line script.  Make sure to use
            semicolons where you would in a normal program.

       <b>-E</b> <u>commandline</u>
            behaves  just like -e, except that it implicitly enables all optional features and builtin functions
            (in the main compilation unit). See feature and builtin.

       <b>-f</b>   Disable executing <u>$Config{sitelib}/sitecustomize.pl</u> at startup.

            Perl can be built so that it by default will try  to  execute  <u>$Config{sitelib}/sitecustomize.pl</u>  at
            startup  (in a BEGIN block).  This is a hook that allows the sysadmin to customize how Perl behaves.
            It can for instance be used to add entries to the @INC array to  make  Perl  find  modules  in  non-
            standard locations.

            Perl actually inserts the following code:

                BEGIN {
                    do { local $!; -f "$Config{sitelib}/sitecustomize.pl"; }
                        &amp;&amp; do "$Config{sitelib}/sitecustomize.pl";
                }

            Since  it is an actual "do" (not a "require"), <u>sitecustomize.pl</u> doesn't need to return a true value.
            The code is run in package "main", in its own lexical scope. However, if the script  dies,  $@  will
            not be set.

            The  value  of $Config{sitelib} is also determined in C code and not read from "Config.pm", which is
            not loaded.

            The code is executed <u>very</u> early. For example, any changes made to @INC will show up in the output of
            `perl -V`. Of course, "END" blocks will be likewise executed very late.

            To determine at runtime if this capability has been compiled in your perl, you can check  the  value
            of $Config{usesitecustomize}.

       <b>-F</b><u>pattern</u>
            specifies  the  pattern  to  split  on  for  "-a". The pattern may be surrounded by "//", "", or '',
            otherwise it will be put in single quotes. You can't use literal whitespace or NUL characters in the
            pattern.

            <b>-F</b> implicitly sets both "-a" and "-n".

       <b>-g</b>   undefines the input record separator ($/) and thus enables the slurp mode. In other words, it causes
            Perl to read whole files at once, instead of line by line.

            This flag is a simpler alias for -0777.

            Mnemonics: gobble, grab, gulp.

       <b>-h</b>   prints a summary of the options.

       <b>-?</b>   synonym for <b>-h</b>: prints a summary of the options.

       <b>-i</b>[<u>extension</u>]
            specifies that files processed by the "&lt;&gt;" construct are to be edited in-place.   It  does  this  by
            renaming  the  input  file,  opening the output file by the original name, and selecting that output
            file as the default for <b>print()</b> statements.  The extension, if supplied, is used to modify the  name
            of the old file to make a backup copy, following these rules:

            If  no  extension is supplied, and your system supports it, the original <u>file</u> is kept open without a
            name while the output is redirected to a new file with the  original  <u>filename</u>.   When  perl  exits,
            cleanly or not, the original <u>file</u> is unlinked.

            If  the extension doesn't contain a "*", then it is appended to the end of the current filename as a
            suffix.  If the extension does contain one or more "*" characters, then each "*"  is  replaced  with
            the current filename.  In Perl terms, you could think of this as:

                ($backup = $extension) =~ s/\*/$file_name/g;

            This allows you to add a prefix to the backup file, instead of (or in addition to) a suffix:

             $ perl -pi'orig_*' -e 's/bar/baz/' fileA  # backup to
                                                       # 'orig_fileA'

            Or  even to place backup copies of the original files into another directory (provided the directory
            already exists):

             $ perl -pi'old/*.orig' -e 's/bar/baz/' fileA  # backup to
                                                           # 'old/fileA.orig'

            These sets of one-liners are equivalent:

             $ perl -pi -e 's/bar/baz/' fileA          # overwrite current file
             $ perl -pi'*' -e 's/bar/baz/' fileA       # overwrite current file

             $ perl -pi'.orig' -e 's/bar/baz/' fileA   # backup to 'fileA.orig'
             $ perl -pi'*.orig' -e 's/bar/baz/' fileA  # backup to 'fileA.orig'

            From the shell, saying

                $ perl -p -i.orig -e "s/foo/bar/; ... "

            is the same as using the program:

                #!<a href="file:///usr/lib/w3m/cgi-bin/w3mman2html.cgi?perl">/usr/bin/perl</a> -pi.orig
                s/foo/bar/;

            which is equivalent to

                #!<a href="file:///usr/lib/w3m/cgi-bin/w3mman2html.cgi?perl">/usr/bin/perl</a>
                $extension = '.orig';
                LINE: while (&lt;&gt;) {
                    if ($ARGV ne $oldargv) {
                        if ($extension !~ /\*/) {
                            $backup = $ARGV . $extension;
                        }
                        else {
                            ($backup = $extension) =~ s/\*/$ARGV/g;
                        }
                        rename($ARGV, $backup);
                        open(ARGVOUT, "&gt;$ARGV");
                        select(ARGVOUT);
                        $oldargv = $ARGV;
                    }
                    s/foo/bar/;
                }
                continue {
                    print;  # this prints to original filename
                }
                select(STDOUT);

            except that the <b>-i</b> form doesn't need to compare $ARGV to $oldargv to  know  when  the  filename  has
            changed.   It  does, however, use ARGVOUT for the selected filehandle.  Note that STDOUT is restored
            as the default output filehandle after the loop.

            As shown above, Perl creates the backup file whether or not any output is actually changed.  So this
            is just a fancy way to copy files:

                $ perl -p -i'/some/file/path/*' -e 1 file1 file2 file3...
            or
                $ perl -p -i'.orig' -e 1 file1 file2 file3...

            You can use "eof" without parentheses to locate the end of each input file,  in  case  you  want  to
            append to each file, or reset line numbering (see example in "eof" in perlfunc).

            If, for a given file, Perl is unable to create the backup file as specified in the extension then it
            will skip that file and continue on with the next one (if it exists).

            For  a  discussion  of  issues surrounding file permissions and <b>-i</b>, see "Why does Perl let me delete
            read-only files?  Why does -i clobber protected files?  Isn't this a bug in Perl?" in perlfaq5.

            You cannot use <b>-i</b> to create directories or to strip extensions from files.

            Perl does not expand "~" in filenames, which is good, since some  folks  use  it  for  their  backup
            files:

                $ perl -pi~ -e 's/foo/bar/' file1 file2 file3...

            Note  that  because  <b>-i</b>  renames or deletes the original file before creating a new file of the same
            name, Unix-style soft and hard links will not be preserved.

            Finally, the <b>-i</b> switch does not impede execution when no files are given on the  command  line.   In
            this  case,  no  backup  is made (the original file cannot, of course, be determined) and processing
            proceeds from STDIN to STDOUT as might be expected.

       <b>-I</b><u>directory</u>
            Directories specified by <b>-I</b> are prepended to the search path for modules (@INC).

       <b>-l</b>[<u>octnum</u>]
            enables automatic line-ending processing.  It has two separate  effects.   First,  it  automatically
            chomps  $/  (the  input record separator) when used with "-n" or "-p".  Second, it assigns "$\" (the
            output record separator) to have the value of <u>octnum</u> so that any print  statements  will  have  that
            separator added back on.  If <u>octnum</u> is omitted, sets "$\" to the current value of $<a href="file:/.">/.</a>  For instance,
            to trim lines to 80 columns:

                perl -lpe 'substr($_, 80) = ""'

            Note  that  the  assignment  "$\  =  $/"  is  done when the switch is processed, so the input record
            separator can be different than the output record separator if the <b>-l</b> switch is  followed  by  a  -0
            switch:

                gnufind / -print0 | perl -ln0e 'print "found $_" if -p'

            This sets "$\" to newline and then sets $/ to the null character.

       <b>-m</b>[<b>-</b>]<u>module</u>
       <b>-M</b>[<b>-</b>]<u>module</u>
       <b>-M</b>[<b>-</b>]<u>'module</u> <u>...'</u>
       <b>-[mM]</b>[<b>-</b>]<u>module=arg[,arg]...</u>
            <b>-m</b><u>module</u> executes "use" <u>module</u> "();" before executing your program.  This loads the module, but does
            not call its "import" method, so does not import subroutines and does not give effect to a pragma.

            <b>-M</b><u>module</u>  executes  "use" <u>module</u> ";" before executing your program.  This loads the module and calls
            its "import" method, causing the module to have its default effect, typically importing  subroutines
            or  giving  effect  to  a pragma.  You can use quotes to add extra code after the module name, e.g.,
            '-M<u>MODULE</u> qw(foo bar)'.

            If the first character after the <b>-M</b> or <b>-m</b> is a dash (<b>-</b>) then the 'use' is replaced with 'no'.   This
            makes no difference for <b>-m</b>.

            Since  Perl  version  5.39.8,  the  "-M"  switch  and  the module name can now be passed in separate
            command-line arguments:

              perl -M MODULE ...            # like perl -MMODULE ...
              perl -M MODULE=arg1,arg2,...  # like perl -MMODULE=arg1,arg2,...

            A little builtin syntactic sugar means you can also say <b>-m</b><u><b>MODULE</b></u><b>=foo,bar</b> or  <b>-M</b><u><b>MODULE</b></u><b>=foo,bar</b>  as  a
            shortcut  for  <b>'-M</b><u><b>MODULE</b></u>  <b>qw(foo</b>  <b>bar)'</b>.  This avoids the need to use quotes when importing symbols.
            The actual code generated by <b>-M</b><u><b>MODULE</b></u><b>=foo,bar</b> is "use module split(/,/,q{foo,bar})".  Note that  the
            "="  form  removes  the  distinction  between  <b>-m</b>  and  <b>-M</b>; that is, <b>-m</b><u><b>MODULE</b></u><b>=foo,bar</b> is the same as
            <b>-M</b><u><b>MODULE</b></u><b>=foo,bar</b>.

            A consequence of the "split" formulation is that <b>-M</b><u><b>MODULE</b></u><b>=number</b> never does a version check,  unless
            "<u>MODULE</u>::import()"  itself is set up to do a version check, which could happen for example if <u>MODULE</u>
            inherits from Exporter.

       <b>-n</b>   causes Perl to assume the following loop around your program, which makes it iterate  over  filename
            arguments somewhat like <u>sed</u> <u>-n</u> or <u>awk</u>:

              LINE:
                while (&lt;&gt;) {
                    ...             # your program goes here
                }

            Note that the lines are not printed by default.  See "-p" to have lines printed.  If a file named by
            an argument cannot be opened for some reason, Perl warns you about it and moves on to the next file.

            Also  note  that "&lt;&gt;" passes command line arguments to "open" in perlfunc, which doesn't necessarily
            interpret them as file names.  See  perlop for possible security implications.

            Here is an efficient way to delete all files that haven't been modified for at least a week:

                find . -mtime +7 -print | perl -nle unlink

            This is faster than using the <b>-exec</b> switch of <u>find</u> because you don't have  to  start  a  process  on
            every  filename found (but it's not faster than using the <b>-delete</b> switch available in newer versions
            of <u>find</u>.  It does suffer from the bug of mishandling newlines in pathnames, which you can fix if you
            follow the example under -0.

            "BEGIN" and "END" blocks may be used to capture control before or after the implicit  program  loop,
            just as in <u>awk</u>.

       <b>-p</b>   causes  Perl  to assume the following loop around your program, which makes it iterate over filename
            arguments somewhat like <u>sed</u>:

              LINE:
                while (&lt;&gt;) {
                    ...             # your program goes here
                } continue {
                    print or die "-p destination: $!\n";
                }

            If a file named by an argument cannot be opened for some reason, Perl warns you about it, and  moves
            on  to  the  next  file.   Note that the lines are printed automatically.  An error occurring during
            printing is treated as fatal.  To suppress printing use the  "-n"  switch.   A  <b>-p</b>  overrides  a  <b>-n</b>
            switch.

            "BEGIN"  and  "END" blocks may be used to capture control before or after the implicit loop, just as
            in <u>awk</u>.

       <b>-s</b>   enables rudimentary switch parsing for switches on the command  line  after  the  program  name  but
            before any filename arguments (or before an argument of <b>--</b>).  Any switch found there is removed from
            @ARGV  and  sets the corresponding variable in the Perl program, in the main package.  The following
            program prints "1" if the program is invoked with a <b>-xyz</b> switch, and "abc" if  it  is  invoked  with
            <b>-xyz=abc</b>.

                #!<a href="file:///usr/lib/w3m/cgi-bin/w3mman2html.cgi?perl">/usr/bin/perl</a> -s
                if ($xyz) { print "$xyz\n" }

            Do  note that a switch like <b>--help</b> creates the variable "${-help}", which is not compliant with "use
            strict "refs"".  Also, when using this option on a script with warnings enabled you may get a lot of
            spurious "used only once" warnings. For these reasons, use of <b>-s</b> is  discouraged.  See  Getopt::Long
            for much more flexible switch parsing.

       <b>-S</b>   makes  Perl  use  the  "PATH"  environment variable to search for the program unless the name of the
            program contains path separators.

            On some platforms, this also makes Perl append suffixes to the filename while searching for it.  For
            example, on Win32 platforms, the ".bat" and ".cmd"  suffixes  are  appended  if  a  lookup  for  the
            original  name  fails,  and if the name does not already end in one of those suffixes.  If your Perl
            was compiled with "DEBUGGING" turned on,  using  the  -Dp  switch  to  Perl  shows  how  the  search
            progresses.

            Typically  this  is  used  to  emulate "#!" startup on platforms that don't support "#!".  It's also
            convenient when debugging a script that uses "#!", and is thus normally found by the  shell's  $PATH
            search mechanism.

            This example works on many platforms that have a shell compatible with Bourne shell:

                #!<a href="file:///usr/lib/w3m/cgi-bin/w3mman2html.cgi?perl">/usr/bin/perl</a>
                eval 'exec <a href="file:///usr/lib/w3m/cgi-bin/w3mman2html.cgi?perl">/usr/bin/perl</a> -wS $0 ${1+"$@"}'
                        if 0; # ^ Run only under a shell

            The system ignores the first line and feeds the program to <u><a href="file:/bin/sh">/bin/sh</a></u>, which proceeds to try to execute
            the  Perl  program as a shell script.  The shell executes the second line as a normal shell command,
            and thus starts up the Perl interpreter.  On  some  systems  $0  doesn't  always  contain  the  full
            pathname,  so  the  "-S"  tells Perl to search for the program if necessary.  After Perl locates the
            program, it parses the lines and ignores them because the check  'if  0'  is  never  true.   If  the
            program  will  be interpreted by csh, you will need to replace "${1+"$@"}" with $*, even though that
            doesn't understand embedded spaces (and such) in the argument list.  To start up <u>sh</u> rather than <u>csh</u>,
            some systems may have to replace the "#!" line with a line containing just a colon,  which  will  be
            politely  ignored  by  Perl.  Other systems can't control that, and need a totally devious construct
            that will work under any of <u>csh</u>, <u>sh</u>, or Perl, such as the following:

                    eval '(exit $?0)' &amp;&amp; eval 'exec perl -wS $0 ${1+"$@"}'
                    &amp; eval 'exec <a href="file:///usr/lib/w3m/cgi-bin/w3mman2html.cgi?perl">/usr/bin/perl</a> -wS $0 $argv:q'
                            if 0; # ^ Run only under a shell

            If the filename supplied contains directory separators (and so is an absolute or relative pathname),
            and if that file is not found, platforms that append file extensions will do so and try to look  for
            the file with those extensions added, one by one.

            On  DOS-like  platforms,  if  the  program  does  not contain directory separators, it will first be
            searched for in the current directory before being searched for on the PATH.  On Unix platforms, the
            program will be searched for strictly on the PATH.

       <b>-t</b>   Like "-T", but taint checks will issue warnings rather than fatal errors.  These warnings can now be
            controlled normally with no warnings qw(taint).

            <b>Note:</b> <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>substitute</b> <b>for</b> <b>"-T"!</b> This is meant to be used <u>only</u> as  a  temporary  development
            aid  while  securing  legacy  code:  for  real  production code and for new secure code written from
            scratch, always use the real "-T".

            This has no effect if your perl was built without taint support.

       <b>-T</b>   turns on "taint" so you can test them.  Ordinarily these checks are done only when running setuid or
            setgid.  It's a good idea to turn them on explicitly for programs that run on behalf of someone else
            whom you might not necessarily trust, such as CGI programs or any internet servers you  might  write
            in  Perl.   See  perlsec  for details.  For security reasons, this option must be seen by Perl quite
            early; usually this means it must appear early on the command line or in the "#!" line  for  systems
            which support that construct.

       <b>-u</b>   This switch causes Perl to dump core after compiling your program.  You can then in theory take this
            core  dump  and  turn  it  into an executable file by using the <u>undump</u> program (not supplied).  This
            speeds startup at the expense  of  some  disk  space  (which  you  can  minimize  by  stripping  the
            executable).   (Still,  a  "hello  world" executable comes out to about 200K on my machine.)  If you
            want to execute a portion of your program before dumping, use  the  CORE::dump()  function  instead.
            Note:  availability  of  <u>undump</u> is platform specific and may not be available for a specific port of
            Perl.

       <b>-U</b>   allows Perl to do unsafe operations.  Currently the  only  "unsafe"  operations  are  attempting  to
            unlink  directories  while  running as superuser and running setuid programs with fatal taint checks
            turned into warnings.  Note that warnings must  be  enabled  along  with  this  option  to  actually
            <u>generate</u> the taint-check warnings.

       <b>-v</b>   prints the version and patchlevel of your perl executable.

       <b>-V</b>   prints summary of the major perl configuration values and the current values of @INC.

       <b>-V:</b><u>configvar</u>
            Prints  to  STDOUT  the  value  of  the  named  configuration  variable(s), with multiples when your
            "<u>configvar</u>" argument looks like a regex (has non-letters).  For example:

                $ perl -V:libc
                    libc='/lib/libc-2.2.4.so';
                $ perl -V:lib.
                    libs='-lnsl -lgdbm -ldb -ldl -lm -lcrypt -lutil -lc';
                    libc='/lib/libc-2.2.4.so';
                $ perl -V:lib.*
                    libpth='<a href="file:/usr/local/lib">/usr/local/lib</a> <a href="file:/lib">/lib</a> <a href="file:/usr/lib">/usr/lib</a>';
                    libs='-lnsl -lgdbm -ldb -ldl -lm -lcrypt -lutil -lc';
                    lib_ext='.a';
                    libc='/lib/libc-2.2.4.so';
                    libperl='libperl.a';
                    ....

            Additionally, extra colons can be used to control  formatting.   A  trailing  colon  suppresses  the
            linefeed  and  terminator  ";",  allowing you to embed queries into shell commands.  (mnemonic: PATH
            separator ":".)

                $ echo "compression-vars: " `perl -V:z.*: ` " are here !"
                compression-vars:  zcat='' zip='zip'  are here !

            A leading colon removes the "name=" part of the response, this allows you to map  to  the  name  you
            need.  (mnemonic: empty label)

                $ echo "goodvfork="`./perl -Ilib -V::usevfork`
                goodvfork=false;

            Leading and trailing colons can be used together if you need positional parameter values without the
            names.  Note that in the case below, the "PERL_API" params are returned in alphabetical order.

                $ echo building_on `perl -V::osname: -V::PERL_API_.*:` now
                building_on 'linux' '5' '1' '9' now

       <b>-w</b>   prints  warnings  about  dubious  constructs,  such as variable names mentioned only once and scalar
            variables used before  being  set;  redefined  subroutines;  references  to  undefined  filehandles;
            filehandles opened read-only that you are attempting to write on; values used as a number that don't
            <u>look</u>  like numbers; using an array as though it were a scalar; if your subroutines recurse more than
            100 deep; and innumerable other things.

            This switch really just enables the  global  $^W  variable;  normally,  the  lexically  scoped  "use
            warnings"  pragma is preferred. You can disable or promote into fatal errors specific warnings using
            "__WARN__" hooks, as described in perlvar and "warn" in perlfunc.  See also perldiag  and  perltrap.
            A  fine-grained  warning  facility  is  also  available  if you want to manipulate entire classes of
            warnings; see warnings.

       <b>-W</b>   Enables all warnings regardless of "no warnings" or $^W.  See warnings.

       <b>-X</b>   Disables all warnings regardless of "use warnings" or $^W.  See warnings.

            Forbidden in "PERL5OPT".

       <b>-x</b>
       <b>-x</b><u>directory</u>
            tells Perl that the program is embedded in a larger chunk of unrelated  text,  such  as  in  a  mail
            message.   Leading garbage will be discarded until the first line that starts with "#!" and contains
            the string "perl".  Any meaningful switches on that line will be applied.

            All references to line numbers by the program (warnings, errors, ...)  will treat the "#!"  line  as
            the  first  line.   Thus a warning on the 2nd line of the program, which is on the 100th line in the
            file will be reported as line 2, not as line 100.  This can  be  overridden  by  using  the  "#line"
            directive.  (See "Plain Old Comments (Not!)" in perlsyn)

            If  a  directory  name  is specified, Perl will switch to that directory before running the program.
            The <b>-x</b> switch controls only the disposal of leading garbage.  The program must  be  terminated  with
            "__END__"  if  there  is  trailing garbage to be ignored;  the program can process any or all of the
            trailing garbage via the "DATA" filehandle if desired.

            The directory,  if  specified,  must  appear  immediately  following  the  <b>-x</b>  with  no  intervening
            whitespace.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       HOME        Used if "chdir" has no argument.

       LOGDIR      Used if "chdir" has no argument and "HOME" is not set.

       PATH        Used in executing subprocesses, and in finding the program if "-S" is used.

       PERL5LIB    A  list of directories in which to look for Perl library files before looking in the standard
                   library.    Any   architecture-specific   and   version-specific   directories,    such    as
                   <u>version/archname/</u>,  <u>version/</u>,  or  <u>archname/</u>  under the specified locations are automatically
                   included if they exist, with this lookup done at interpreter startup time.  In addition,  any
                   directories  matching  the  entries in $Config{inc_version_list} are added.  (These typically
                   would be for older compatible perl versions installed in the same directory tree.)

                   If PERL5LIB is not defined, "PERLLIB" is used.  Directories are separated (like in PATH) by a
                   colon on Unixish platforms and by a semicolon on Windows (the  proper  path  separator  being
                   given by the command "perl -V:<u>path_sep</u>").

                   When  running  taint  checks, either because the program was running setuid or setgid, or the
                   "-T" or "-t" switch was specified, neither PERL5LIB nor "PERLLIB" is consulted.  The  program
                   should instead say:

                       use lib "/my/directory";

       PERL5OPT    Command-line  options  (switches).   Switches in this variable are treated as if they were on
                   every Perl command line.  Only the <b>-[CDIMTUWdmtw]</b> switches are allowed.  When  running  taint
                   checks  (either because the program was running setuid or setgid, or because the "-T" or "-t"
                   switch was used), this variable is ignored.  If PERL5OPT begins with  <b>-T</b>,  tainting  will  be
                   enabled  and  subsequent  options  ignored.   If  PERL5OPT  begins  with <b>-t</b>, tainting will be
                   enabled, a writable dot removed from @INC, and subsequent options honored.

       PERLIO      A space (or colon) separated list of PerlIO layers. If perl is built to use PerlIO system for
                   IO (the default) these layers affect Perl's IO.

                   It is conventional to start layer names with a colon (for example,  ":perlio")  to  emphasize
                   their  similarity  to  variable  "attributes".  But  the code that parses layer specification
                   strings, which is also used to decode the PERLIO environment variable, treats the colon as  a
                   separator.

                   An  unset  or  empty PERLIO is equivalent to the default set of layers for your platform; for
                   example, ":unix:perlio" on Unix-like systems and ":unix:crlf" on Windows and  other  DOS-like
                   systems.

                   The  list becomes the default for <u>all</u> Perl's IO. Consequently only built-in layers can appear
                   in this list, as external layers (such as :encoding()) need IO in order to  load  them!   See
                   "open pragma" for how to add external encodings as defaults.

                   Layers  it  makes  sense to include in the PERLIO environment variable are briefly summarized
                   below. For more details see PerlIO.

                   :crlf   A layer which does CRLF to "\n" translation distinguishing "text" and "binary"  files
                           in  the  manner  of MS-DOS and similar operating systems, and also provides buffering
                           similar to ":perlio" on these architectures.

                   :perlio This is a re-implementation of stdio-like buffering written as a  PerlIO  layer.   As
                           such it will call whatever layer is below it for its operations, typically ":unix".

                   :stdio  This  layer  provides  a PerlIO interface by wrapping system's ANSI C "stdio" library
                           calls. The layer provides both buffering and IO.  Note that the ":stdio"  layer  does
                           <u>not</u>  do  CRLF  translation  even if that is the platform's normal behaviour. You will
                           need a ":crlf" layer above it to do that.

                   :unix   Low-level layer that calls "read", "write", "lseek", etc.

                   The default set of layers should give acceptable results on all platforms.

                   For Unix platforms that will be the equivalent of ":unix:perlio" or ":stdio".   Configure  is
                   set up to prefer the ":stdio" implementation if the system's library provides for fast access
                   to  the  buffer  (not  common on modern architectures); otherwise, it uses the ":unix:perlio"
                   implementation.

                   On Win32 the default in this release (5.30) is ":unix:crlf". Win32's ":stdio" has a number of
                   bugs/mis-features for Perl IO which are somewhat depending on the version and vendor of the C
                   compiler. Using our own ":crlf" layer as the buffer avoids those issues and makes things more
                   uniform.

                   This release (5.30) uses ":unix" as the bottom layer on  Win32,  and  so  still  uses  the  C
                   compiler's numeric file descriptor routines.

                   The PERLIO environment variable is completely ignored when Perl is run in taint mode.

       PERLIO_DEBUG
                   If set to the name of a file or device when Perl is run with the -Di command-line switch, the
                   logging  of  certain  operations  of the PerlIO subsystem will be redirected to the specified
                   file rather than going to stderr, which is the default. The file is opened  in  append  mode.
                   Typical uses are in Unix:

                      % env PERLIO_DEBUG=/tmp/perlio.log perl -Di script ...

                   and under Win32, the approximately equivalent:

                      &gt; set PERLIO_DEBUG=CON
                      perl -Di script ...

                   This functionality is disabled for setuid scripts, for scripts run with "-T", and for scripts
                   run on a Perl built without "-DDEBUGGING" support.

       PERLLIB     A  list of directories in which to look for Perl library files before looking in the standard
                   library.  If "PERL5LIB" is defined, PERLLIB is not used.

                   The PERLLIB environment variable is completely ignored when Perl is run in taint mode.

       PERL5DB     The command used to load the debugger code.  The default is:

                           BEGIN { require "perl5db.pl" }

                   The PERL5DB environment variable is only used when Perl is started with a bare "-d" switch.

       PERL5DB_THREADED
                   If set to a true value, indicates to the debugger that the code being debugged uses threads.

       PERL5SHELL (specific to the Win32 port)
                   On Win32 ports only, may be set to an alternative shell that Perl  must  use  internally  for
                   executing  "backtick"  commands  or  <b>system()</b>.   Default is "cmd.exe /x/d/c" on WindowsNT and
                   "command.com /c" on  Windows95.   The  value  is  considered  space-separated.   Precede  any
                   character that needs to be protected, like a space or backslash, with another backslash.

                   Note  that  Perl  doesn't  use  COMSPEC for this purpose because COMSPEC has a high degree of
                   variability among users, leading to portability concerns.  Besides, Perl can use a shell that
                   may not be fit for interactive use, and setting COMSPEC to such a shell  may  interfere  with
                   the  proper  functioning of other programs (which usually look in COMSPEC to find a shell fit
                   for interactive use).

                   Before Perl 5.10.0 and  5.8.8,  PERL5SHELL  was  not  taint  checked  when  running  external
                   commands.   It  is  recommended  that  you  explicitly  set (or delete) $ENV{PERL5SHELL} when
                   running in taint mode under Windows.

       PERL_ALLOW_NON_IFS_LSP (specific to the Win32 port)
                   Set to 1 to allow the use of non-IFS  compatible  LSPs  (Layered  Service  Providers).   Perl
                   normally  searches  for  an  IFS-compatible LSP because this is required for its emulation of
                   Windows sockets as real filehandles.  However, this may cause problems if you have a firewall
                   such as <u>McAfee</u> <u>Guardian</u>, which requires that all applications use its LSP but  which  is  not
                   IFS-compatible, because clearly Perl will normally avoid using such an LSP.

                   Setting this environment variable to 1 means that Perl will simply use the first suitable LSP
                   enumerated  in  the  catalog,  which keeps <u>McAfee</u> <u>Guardian</u> happy--and in that particular case
                   Perl still works too because <u>McAfee</u> <u>Guardian</u>'s LSP actually plays  other  games  which  allow
                   applications requiring IFS compatibility to work.

       PERL_DEBUG_MSTATS
                   Relevant only if Perl is compiled with the "malloc" included with the Perl distribution; that
                   is, if "perl -V:d_mymalloc" is "define".

                   If  set, this dumps out memory statistics after execution.  If set to an integer greater than
                   one, also dumps out memory statistics after compilation.

       PERL_DESTRUCT_LEVEL
                   Controls  the  behaviour  of  global  destruction  of  objects  and  other  references.   See
                   "PERL_DESTRUCT_LEVEL" in perlhacktips for more information.

       PERL_DL_NONLAZY
                   Set  to  "1" to have Perl resolve <u>all</u> undefined symbols when it loads a dynamic library.  The
                   default behaviour is to resolve symbols when they are used.  Setting this variable is  useful
                   during  testing  of  extensions,  as  it ensures that you get an error on misspelled function
                   names even if the test suite doesn't call them.

       PERL_ENCODING
                   If using the "use encoding" pragma without  an  explicit  encoding  name,  the  PERL_ENCODING
                   environment variable is consulted for an encoding name.

       PERL_HASH_SEED
                   (Since  Perl  5.8.1,  new  semantics  in  Perl 5.18.0)  Used to override the randomization of
                   Perl's internal hash function. The value is expressed  in  hexadecimal,  and  may  include  a
                   leading 0x. Truncated patterns are treated as though they are suffixed with sufficient 0's as
                   required.

                   If  the  option  is provided, and "PERL_PERTURB_KEYS" is NOT set, then a value of '0' implies
                   "PERL_PERTURB_KEYS=0"/"PERL_PERTURB_KEYS=NO"     and     any     other     value      implies
                   "PERL_PERTURB_KEYS=2"/"PERL_PERTURB_KEYS=DETERMINISTIC".    See    the    documentation   for
                   PERL_PERTURB_KEYS for important caveats regarding the "DETERMINISTIC" mode.

                   <b>PLEASE</b> <b>NOTE:</b> <b>The</b> <b>hash</b> <b>seed</b> <b>is</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>information</b>. Hashes are randomized to protect against
                   local and remote attacks against Perl code. By manually setting a seed, this  protection  may
                   be partially or completely lost.

                   See    "Algorithmic    Complexity    Attacks"    in    perlsec,    "PERL_PERTURB_KEYS",   and
                   "PERL_HASH_SEED_DEBUG" for more information.

       PERL_PERTURB_KEYS
                   (Since Perl 5.18.0)  Set to "0" or "NO" then traversing keys will be repeatable from  run  to
                   run  for  the same "PERL_HASH_SEED".  Insertion into a hash will not change the order, except
                   to provide for more space in the hash. When combined with setting PERL_HASH_SEED this mode is
                   as close to pre 5.18 behavior as you can get.

                   When set to "1" or "RANDOM" then traversing keys will be randomized.  Every time  a  hash  is
                   inserted  into the key order will change in a random fashion. The order may not be repeatable
                   in a following program run even if the PERL_HASH_SEED has been specified. This is the default
                   mode for perl when no PERL_HASH_SEED has been explicitly provided.

                   When set to "2" or "DETERMINISTIC" then inserting keys into a hash will cause the  key  order
                   to change, but in a way that is repeatable from program run to program run, provided that the
                   same  hash  seed  is  used,  and  that the code does not itself perform any non-deterministic
                   operations and also provided exactly the same environment context.   Adding  or  removing  an
                   environment variable may and likely will change the key order. If any part of the code builds
                   a  hash using non- deterministic keys, for instance a hash keyed by the stringified form of a
                   reference, or the address of the objects it contains, then this may and likely  will  have  a
                   global  effect on the key order of *every* hash in the process. To work properly this setting
                   MUST be coupled with the PERL_HASH_SEED to produce deterministic results, and in fact, if you
                   do set the "PERL_HASH_SEED" explicitly you do not need to  set  this  as  well,  it  will  be
                   automatically set to this mode.

                   <b>NOTE:</b>  Use  of  this  option  is considered insecure, and is intended only for debugging non-
                   deterministic behavior in Perl's hash function. Do not use it in production.

                   See   "Algorithmic   Complexity   Attacks"    in    perlsec    and    "PERL_HASH_SEED"    and
                   "PERL_HASH_SEED_DEBUG" for more information. You can get and set the key traversal mask for a
                   specific hash by using the hash_traversal_mask() function from Hash::Util.

       PERL_HASH_SEED_DEBUG
                   (Since  Perl  5.8.1.)  Set to "1" to display (to STDERR) information about the hash function,
                   seed, and what type of  key  traversal  randomization  is  in  effect  at  the  beginning  of
                   execution.   This,  combined with "PERL_HASH_SEED" and "PERL_PERTURB_KEYS" is intended to aid
                   in debugging nondeterministic behaviour caused by hash randomization.

                   <b>Note</b> that any information about the hash function, especially  the  hash  seed  is  <b>sensitive</b>
                   <b>information</b>:  by knowing it, one can craft a denial-of-service attack against Perl code, even
                   remotely; see "Algorithmic Complexity Attacks"  in  perlsec  for  more  information.  <b>Do</b>  <b>not</b>
                   <b>disclose</b>  <b>the</b>  <b>hash</b>  <b>seed</b>  to  people  who  don't  need  to know it. See also hash_seed() and
                   hash_traversal_mask().

                   An example output might be:

                    HASH_FUNCTION = ONE_AT_A_TIME_HARD HASH_SEED = 0x652e9b9349a7a032 PERTURB_KEYS = 1 (RANDOM)

       PERL_MEM_LOG
                   If your Perl was configured with <b>-Accflags=-DPERL_MEM_LOG</b>, setting the  environment  variable
                   "PERL_MEM_LOG"  enables  logging  debug messages. The value has the form "&lt;<u>number</u>&gt;[m][s][t]",
                   where "<u>number</u>" is the file descriptor number you want to write to (2  is  default),  and  the
                   combination  of  letters  specifies  that  you  want  information about (m)emory and/or (s)v,
                   optionally with (t)imestamps.  For  example,  "PERL_MEM_LOG=1mst"  logs  all  information  to
                   stdout. You can write to other opened file descriptors in a variety of ways:

                     $ 3&gt;foo3 PERL_MEM_LOG=3m perl ...

       PERL_ROOT (specific to the VMS port)
                   A translation-concealed rooted logical name that contains Perl and the logical device for the
                   @INC  path  on  VMS  only.   Other  logical  names  that  affect Perl on VMS include PERLSHR,
                   PERL_ENV_TABLES, and SYS$TIMEZONE_DIFFERENTIAL, but are optional  and  discussed  further  in
                   perlvms and in <u>README.vms</u> in the Perl source distribution.

       PERL_SIGNALS
                   Available  in Perls 5.8.1 and later.  If set to "unsafe", the pre-Perl-5.8.0 signal behaviour
                   (which is immediate but unsafe) is restored.  If set to  "safe",  then  safe  (but  deferred)
                   signals are used.  See "Deferred Signals (Safe Signals)" in perlipc.

       PERL_UNICODE
                   Equivalent  to the -C command-line switch.  Note that this is not a boolean variable. Setting
                   this to "1" is not the right way to "enable Unicode" (whatever that would mean).  You can use
                   "0" to "disable Unicode", though (or alternatively unset PERL_UNICODE in  your  shell  before
                   starting Perl).  See the description of the -C switch for more information.

       PERL_USE_UNSAFE_INC
                   If  perl  has  been  configured  to  not  have the current directory in @INC by default, this
                   variable can be set to "1" to reinstate it.  It's primarily intended for use  while  building
                   and  testing modules that have not been updated to deal with "." not being in @INC and should
                   not be set in the environment for day-to-day use.

       SYS$LOGIN (specific to the VMS port)
                   Used if chdir has no argument and "HOME" and "LOGDIR" are not set.

       PERL_INTERNAL_RAND_SEED
                   Set to a non-negative integer to seed the random number generator used internally by perl for
                   a variety of purposes.

                   Ignored if perl is run setuid or setgid.  Used only for some  limited  startup  randomization
                   (hash keys) if "-T" or "-t" perl is started with tainting enabled.

                   Perl may be built to ignore this variable.

       PERL_RAND_SEED
                   When  set to an integer value this value will be used to seed the perl internal random number
                   generator used for rand() when it is used without an explicit srand() call  or  for  when  an
                   explicit no-argument srand() call is made.

                   Normally  calling  rand()  prior  to  calling  srand()  or calling srand() explicitly with no
                   arguments should result in the random number generator  using  "best  efforts"  to  seed  the
                   generator state with a relatively high quality random seed. When this environment variable is
                   set then the seeds used will be deterministically computed from the value provided in the env
                   var  in  such  a way that the application process and any forks or threads should continue to
                   have their own unique seed but that the program may be run twice with  identical  results  as
                   far as rand() goes (assuming all else is equal).

                   PERL_RAND_SEED  is  intended for performance measurements and debugging and is explicitly NOT
                   intended for stable testing. The only guarantee is  that  a  specific  perl  executable  will
                   produce  the  same results twice in a row, there is no guarantee that the results will be the
                   same between perl releases or on different architectures.

                   Ignored if perl is run setuid or setgid.

       Perl also has environment variables that control how Perl handles data  specific  to  particular  natural
       languages; see perllocale.

       Perl  and  its  various  modules and components, including its test frameworks, may sometimes make use of
       certain other environment variables.  Some of these  are  specific  to  a  particular  platform.   Please
       consult  the  appropriate module documentation and any documentation for your platform (like perlsolaris,
       perllinux, perlmacosx, perlwin32, etc) for variables peculiar to those specific situations.

       Perl makes all environment variables available to the program being executed, and passes these  along  to
       any  child  processes it starts.  However, programs running setuid would do well to execute the following
       lines before doing anything else, just to keep people honest:

           $ENV{PATH}  = "<a href="file:/bin">/bin</a>:<a href="file:/usr/bin">/usr/bin</a>";    # or whatever you need
           $ENV{SHELL} = "<a href="file:/bin/sh">/bin/sh</a>" if exists $ENV{SHELL};
           delete @ENV{qw(IFS CDPATH ENV BASH_ENV)};

</pre><h4><b>ORDER</b> <b>OF</b> <b>APPLICATION</b></h4><pre>
       Some options, in particular "-I", "-M", "PERL5LIB" and "PERL5OPT" can interact, and the  order  in  which
       they are applied is important.

       Note  that this section does not document what <u>actually</u> happens inside the perl interpreter, it documents
       what <u>effectively</u> happens.

       -I  The effect of multiple "-I" options is to "unshift" them  onto  @INC  from  right  to  left.  So  for
           example:

               perl -I 1 -I 2 -I 3

           will  first  prepend 3 onto the front of @INC, then prepend 2, and then prepend 1. The result is that
           @INC begins with:

               qw(1 2 3)

       -M  Multiple "-M" options are processed from left to right. So this:

               perl -Mlib=1 -Mlib=2 -Mlib=3

           will first use the lib pragma to prepend 1 to @INC, then it will prepend 2, then it will  prepend  3,
           resulting in an @INC that begins with:

               qw(3 2 1)

       the PERL5LIB environment variable
           This contains a list of directories, separated by colons. The entire list is prepended to @INC in one
           go. This:

               PERL5LIB=1:2:3 perl

           will result in an @INC that begins with:

               qw(1 2 3)

       combinations of -I, -M and PERL5LIB
           "PERL5LIB" is applied first, then all the "-I" arguments, then all the "-M" arguments. This:

               PERL5LIB=e1:e2 perl -I i1 -Mlib=m1 -I i2 -Mlib=m2

           will result in an @INC that begins with:

               qw(m2 m1 i1 i2 e1 e2)

       the PERL5OPT environment variable
           This  contains  a  space separated list of switches. We only consider the effects of "-M" and "-I" in
           this section.

           After normal processing of "-I" switches from the command line, all the "-I" switches  in  "PERL5OPT"
           are  extracted.  They  are processed from left to right instead of from right to left. Also note that
           while whitespace is allowed between a "-I" and its directory on the command line, it is  not  allowed
           in "PERL5OPT".

           After  normal  processing of "-M" switches from the command line, all the "-M" switches in "PERL5OPT"
           are extracted. They are processed from left to right, <u>i.e.</u> the same as those on the command line.

           An example may make this clearer:

               export PERL5OPT="-Mlib=optm1 -Iopti1 -Mlib=optm2 -Iopti2"
               export PERL5LIB=e1:e2
               perl -I i1 -Mlib=m1 -I i2 -Mlib=m2

           will result in an @INC that begins with:

               qw(
                   optm2
                   optm1

                   m2
                   m1

                   opti2
                   opti1

                   i1
                   i2

                   e1
                   e2
               )

       Other complications
           There are some complications that are ignored in the examples above:

           arch and version subdirs
               All of "-I", "PERL5LIB" and "use lib" will also prepend arch and  version  subdirs  if  they  are
               present
