</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       perl585delta - what is new for perl v5.8.5

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This document describes differences between the 5.8.4 release and the 5.8.5 release.

</pre><h4><b>Incompatible</b> <b>Changes</b></h4><pre>
       There are no changes incompatible with 5.8.4.

</pre><h4><b>Core</b> <b>Enhancements</b></h4><pre>
       Perl's regular expression engine now contains support for matching on the intersection of two Unicode
       character classes. You can also now refer to user-defined character classes from within other user
       defined character classes.

</pre><h4><b>Modules</b> <b>and</b> <b>Pragmata</b></h4><pre>
       •   Carp improved to work nicely with Safe. Carp's message reporting should now be anomaly free - it will
           always print out line number information.

       •   CGI upgraded to version 3.05

       •   charnames now avoids clobbering $_

       •   Digest upgraded to version 1.08

       •   Encode upgraded to version 2.01

       •   FileCache upgraded to version 1.04

       •   libnet upgraded to version 1.19

       •   Pod::Parser upgraded to version 1.28

       •   Pod::Perldoc upgraded to version 3.13

       •   Pod::LaTeX upgraded to version 0.57

       •   Safe now works properly with Carp

       •   Scalar-List-Utils upgraded to version 1.14

       •   Shell's  documentation  has  been  re-written,  and  its  historical  partial auto-quoting of command
           arguments can now be disabled.

       •   Test upgraded to version 1.25

       •   Test::Harness upgraded to version 2.42

       •   Time::Local upgraded to version 1.10

       •   Unicode::Collate upgraded to version 0.40

       •   Unicode::Normalize upgraded to version 0.30

</pre><h4><b>Utility</b> <b>Changes</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Perl's</b> <b>debugger</b>
       The debugger can now emulate stepping backwards, by restarting and rerunning all  bar  the  last  command
       from a saved command history.

   <b>h2ph</b>
       <u>h2ph</u>  is  now  able  to  understand  a  very  limited  set of C inline functions -- basically, the inline
       functions that look like CPP macros. This has been introduced to deal with some of  the  headers  of  the
       newest  versions of the glibc. The standard warning still applies; to quote <u>h2ph</u>'s documentation, <u>you</u> <u>may</u>
       <u>need</u> <u>to</u> <u>dicker</u> <u>with</u> <u>the</u> <u>files</u> <u>produced</u>.

</pre><h4><b>Installation</b> <b>and</b> <b>Configuration</b> <b>Improvements</b></h4><pre>
       Perl 5.8.5 should build cleanly from source on LynxOS.

</pre><h4><b>Selected</b> <b>Bug</b> <b>Fixes</b></h4><pre>
       •   The in-place sort optimisation introduced in 5.8.4 had a bug. For example, in code such as

               @a = sort ($b, @a)

           the result would omit the value $b. This is now fixed.

       •   The optimisation for unnecessary assignments introduced in 5.8.4 could give spurious  warnings.  This
           has been fixed.

       •   Perl  should  now  correctly  detect  and  read  BOM-marked  and  (BOMless)  UTF-16 scripts of either
           endianness.

       •   Creating a new thread when weak references exist  was  buggy,  and  would  often  cause  warnings  at
           interpreter destruction time. The known bug is now fixed.

       •   Several obscure bugs involving manipulating Unicode strings with "substr" have been fixed.

       •   Previously  if  Perl's file globbing function encountered a directory that it did not have permission
           to open it would return immediately, leading to unexpected truncation of the list  of  results.  This
           has been fixed, to be consistent with Unix shells' globbing behaviour.

       •   Thread  creation  time  could  vary  wildly between identical runs. This was caused by a poor hashing
           algorithm in the thread cloning routines, which has now been fixed.

       •   The internals of the ithreads implementation were  not  checking  if  OS-level  thread  creation  had
           failed. threads-&gt;<b>create()</b> now returns "undef" in if thread creation fails instead of crashing perl.

</pre><h4><b>New</b> <b>or</b> <b>Changed</b> <b>Diagnostics</b></h4><pre>
       •   Perl -V has several improvements

           •   correctly  outputs local patch names that contain embedded code snippets or other characters that
               used to confuse it.

           •   arguments to -V that look like regexps will give multiple lines of output.

           •   a trailing colon suppresses the linefeed and ';'  terminator, allowing embedding of queries  into
               shell commands.

           •   a leading colon removes the 'name=' part of the response, allowing mapping to any name.

       •   When  perl  fails to find the specified script, it now outputs a second line suggesting that the user
           use the "-S" flag:

               $ perl5.8.5 missing.pl
               Can't open perl script "missing.pl": No such file or directory.
               Use -S to search $PATH for it.

</pre><h4><b>Changed</b> <b>Internals</b></h4><pre>
       The Unicode character class files used by the regular expression engine are now built at build time  from
       the  supplied Unicode consortium data files, instead of being shipped prebuilt. This makes the compressed
       Perl source tarball about 200K smaller. A side effect is that the layout of files inside lib/unicore  has
       changed.

</pre><h4><b>Known</b> <b>Problems</b></h4><pre>
       The regression test <u>t/uni/class.t</u> is now performing considerably more tests, and can take several minutes
       to run even on a fast machine.

</pre><h4><b>Platform</b> <b>Specific</b> <b>Problems</b></h4><pre>
       This release is known not to build on Windows 95.

</pre><h4><b>Reporting</b> <b>Bugs</b></h4><pre>
       If  you  find  what  you  think  is  a  bug,  you  might  check  the  articles  recently  posted  to  the
       comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug database  at  <a href="http://bugs.perl.org">http://bugs.perl.org</a>.   There  may  also  be
       information at <a href="http://www.perl.org">http://www.perl.org</a>, the Perl Home Page.

       If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the <b>perlbug</b> program included with your release.  Be
       sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of
       "perl  -V", will be sent off to <a href="mailto:perlbug@perl.org">perlbug@perl.org</a> to be analysed by the Perl porting team.  You can browse
       and search the Perl 5 bugs at <a href="http://bugs.perl.org/">http://bugs.perl.org/</a>
