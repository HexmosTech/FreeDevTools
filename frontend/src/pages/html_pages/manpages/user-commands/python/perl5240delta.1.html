</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       perl5240delta - what is new for perl v5.24.0

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This document describes the differences between the 5.22.0 release and the 5.24.0 release.

</pre><h4><b>Core</b> <b>Enhancements</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Postfix</b> <b>dereferencing</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>experimental</b>
       Using the "postderef" and "postderef_qq" features no longer emits a warning. Existing code that disables
       the "experimental::postderef" warning category that they previously used will continue to work. The
       "postderef" feature has no effect; all Perl code can use postfix dereferencing, regardless of what
       feature declarations are in scope. The 5.24 feature bundle now includes the "postderef_qq" feature.

   <b>Unicode</b> <b>8.0</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>supported</b>
       For details on what is in this release, see &lt;<a href="http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode8.0.0/">http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode8.0.0/</a>&gt;.

   <b>perl</b> <b>will</b> <b>now</b> <b>croak</b> <b>when</b> <b>closing</b> <b>an</b> <b>in-place</b> <b>output</b> <b>file</b> <b>fails</b>
       Until now, failure to close the output file for an in-place edit was not detected, meaning that the input
       file could be clobbered without the edit being successfully completed.  Now, when the output file cannot
       be closed successfully, an exception is raised.

   <b>New</b> <b>"\b{lb}"</b> <b>boundary</b> <b>in</b> <b>regular</b> <b>expressions</b>
       "lb" stands for Line Break.  It is a Unicode property that determines where a line of text is suitable to
       break (typically so that it can be output without overflowing the available horizontal space).  This
       capability has long been furnished by the Unicode::LineBreak module, but now a light-weight, non-
       customizable version that is suitable for many purposes is in core Perl.

   <b>"qr/(?[</b> <b>])/"</b> <b>now</b> <b>works</b> <b>in</b> <b>UTF-8</b> <b>locales</b>
       Extended Bracketed Character Classes now will successfully compile when "use locale" is in effect.  The
       compiled pattern will use standard Unicode rules.  If the runtime locale is not a UTF-8 one, a warning is
       raised and standard Unicode rules are used anyway.  No tainting is done since the outcome does not
       actually depend on the locale.

   <b>Integer</b> <b>shift</b> <b>("&lt;&lt;"</b> <b>and</b> <b>"&gt;&gt;")</b> <b>now</b> <b>more</b> <b>explicitly</b> <b>defined</b>
       Negative shifts are reverse shifts: left shift becomes right shift, and right shift becomes left shift.

       Shifting by the number of bits in a native integer (or more) is zero, except when the "overshift" is
       right shifting a negative value under "use integer", in which case the result is -1 (arithmetic shift).

       Until now negative shifting and overshifting have been undefined because they have relied on whatever the
       C implementation happens to do.  For example, for the overshift a common C behavior is "modulo shift":

         1 &gt;&gt; 64 == 1 &gt;&gt; (64 % 64) == 1 &gt;&gt; 0 == 1  # Common C behavior.

         # And the same for &lt;&lt;, while Perl now produces 0 for both.

       Now these behaviors are well-defined under Perl, regardless of what the underlying C implementation does.
       Note, however, that you are still constrained by the native integer width: you need to know how far left
       you can go.  You can use for example:

         use Config;
         my $wordbits = $Config{uvsize} * 8;  # Or $Config{uvsize} &lt;&lt; 3.

       If you need a more bits on the left shift, you can use for example the "bigint" pragma, or the
       "Bit::Vector" module from CPAN.

   <b>printf</b> <b>and</b> <b>sprintf</b> <b>now</b> <b>allow</b> <b>reordered</b> <b>precision</b> <b>arguments</b>
       That is, "sprintf '|%.*2$d|', 2, 3" now returns "|002|". This extends the existing reordering mechanism
       (which allows reordering for arguments that are used as format fields, widths, and vector separators).

   <b>More</b> <b>fields</b> <b>provided</b> <b>to</b> <b>"sigaction"</b> <b>callback</b> <b>with</b> <b>"SA_SIGINFO"</b>
       When passing the "SA_SIGINFO" flag to sigaction, the "errno", "status", "uid", "pid", "addr" and "band"
       fields are now included in the hash passed to the handler, if supported by the platform.

   <b>Hashbang</b> <b>redirection</b> <b>to</b> <b>Perl</b> <b>6</b>
       Previously perl would redirect to another interpreter if it found a hashbang path unless the path
       contains "perl" (see perlrun). To improve compatibility with Perl 6 this behavior has been extended to
       also redirect if "perl" is followed by "6".

</pre><h4><b>Security</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Set</b> <b>proper</b> <b>umask</b> <b>before</b> <b>calling</b> <b><a href="../man3/mkstemp.3.html">mkstemp</a>(3)</b>
       In 5.22 perl started setting umask to 0600 before calling <a href="../man3/mkstemp.3.html">mkstemp</a>(3) and restoring it afterwards. This
       wrongfully tells <a href="../man2/open.2.html">open</a>(2) to strip the owner read and write bits from the given mode before applying it,
       rather than the intended negation of leaving only those bits in place.

       Systems that use mode 0666 in <a href="../man3/mkstemp.3.html">mkstemp</a>(3) (like old versions of glibc) create a file with permissions
       0066, leaving world read and write permissions regardless of current umask.

       This has been fixed by using umask 0177 instead. [perl #127322]

   <b>Fix</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>boundary</b> <b>access</b> <b>in</b> <b>Win32</b> <b>path</b> <b>handling</b>
       This is CVE-2015-8608.  For more information see [GH #15067] &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/15067&gt;

   <b>Fix</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>taint</b> <b>in</b> <b>canonpath</b>
       This is CVE-2015-8607.  For more information see [GH #15084] &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/15084&gt;

   <b>Avoid</b> <b>accessing</b> <b>uninitialized</b> <b>memory</b> <b>in</b> <b>win32</b> <b>crypt()</b>
       Added validation that will detect both a short salt and invalid characters in the salt.  [GH #15091]
       &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/15091&gt;

   <b>Remove</b> <b>duplicate</b> <b>environment</b> <b>variables</b> <b>from</b> <b>"environ"</b>
       Previously, if an environment variable appeared more than once in "environ[]", %ENV would contain the
       last entry for that name, while a typical getenv() would return the first entry. We now make sure %ENV
       contains the same as what "getenv" returns.

       Second, we remove duplicates from "environ[]", so if a setting with that name is set in %ENV, we won't
       pass an unsafe value to a child process.

       [CVE-2016-2381]

</pre><h4><b>Incompatible</b> <b>Changes</b></h4><pre>
   <b>The</b> <b>"autoderef"</b> <b>feature</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>removed</b>
       The experimental "autoderef" feature (which allowed calling "push", "pop", "shift", "unshift", "splice",
       "keys", "values", and "each" on a scalar argument) has been deemed unsuccessful. It has now been removed;
       trying to use the feature (or to disable the "experimental::autoderef" warning it previously triggered)
       now yields an exception.

   <b>Lexical</b> <b>$_</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>removed</b>
       "my $_" was introduced in Perl 5.10, and subsequently caused much confusion with no obvious solution.  In
       Perl 5.18.0, it was made experimental on the theory that it would either be removed or redesigned in a
       less confusing (but backward-incompatible) way.  Over the following years, no alternatives were proposed.
       The feature has now been removed and will fail to compile.

   <b>"qr/\b{wb}/"</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>tailored</b> <b>to</b> <b>Perl</b> <b>expectations</b>
       This is now more suited to be a drop-in replacement for plain "\b", but giving better results for parsing
       natural language.  Previously it strictly followed the current Unicode rules which calls for it to match
       between each white space character.  Now it doesn't generally match within spans of white space, behaving
       like "\b" does.  See "\b{wb}" in perlrebackslash

   <b>Regular</b> <b>expression</b> <b>compilation</b> <b>errors</b>
       Some regular expression patterns that had runtime errors now don't compile at all.

       Almost all Unicode properties using the "\p{}" and "\P{}" regular expression pattern constructs are now
       checked for validity at pattern compilation time, and invalid ones will cause the program to not compile.
       In earlier releases, this check was often deferred until run time.  Whenever an error check is moved from
       run- to compile time, erroneous code is caught 100% of the time, whereas before it would only get caught
       if and when the offending portion actually gets executed, which for unreachable code might be never.

   <b>"qr/\N{}/"</b> <b>now</b> <b>disallowed</b> <b>under</b> <b>"use</b> <b>re</b> <b>"strict""</b>
       An empty "\N{}" makes no sense, but for backwards compatibility is accepted as doing nothing, though a
       deprecation warning is raised by default.  But now this is a fatal error under the experimental feature
       "'strict' mode" in re.

   <b>Nested</b> <b>declarations</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> <b>disallowed</b>
       A "my", "our", or "state" declaration is no longer allowed inside of another "my", "our", or "state"
       declaration.

       For example, these are now fatal:

          my ($x, my($y));
          our (my $x);

       [GH #14799] &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/14799&gt;

       [GH #13548] &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/13548&gt;

   <b>The</b> <b>"/\C/"</b> <b>character</b> <b>class</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>removed</b>
       This regular expression character class was deprecated in v5.20.0 and has produced a deprecation warning
       since v5.22.0. It is now a compile-time error. If you need to examine the individual bytes that make up a
       UTF8-encoded character, then use utf8::encode() on the string (or a copy) first.

   <b>chdir('')</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>chdirs</b> <b>home</b>
       Using chdir('') or chdir(undef) to chdir home has been deprecated since perl v5.8, and will now fail.
       Use chdir() instead.

   <b>ASCII</b> <b>characters</b> <b>in</b> <b>variable</b> <b>names</b> <b>must</b> <b>now</b> <b>be</b> <b>all</b> <b>visible</b>
       It was legal until now on ASCII platforms for variable names to contain non-graphical ASCII control
       characters (ordinals 0 through 31, and 127, which are the C0 controls and "DELETE").  This usage has been
       deprecated since v5.20, and as of now causes a syntax error.  The variables these names referred to are
       special, reserved by Perl for whatever use it may choose, now, or in the future.  Each such variable has
       an alternative way of spelling it.  Instead of the single non-graphic control character, a two character
       sequence beginning with a caret is used, like $^] and "${^GLOBAL_PHASE}".  Details are at perlvar.   It
       remains legal, though unwise and deprecated (raising a deprecation warning), to use certain non-graphic
       non-ASCII characters in variables names when not under "use utf8".  No code should do this, as all such
       variables are reserved by Perl, and Perl doesn't currently define any of them (but could at any time,
       without notice).

   <b>An</b> <b>off</b> <b>by</b> <b>one</b> <b>issue</b> <b>in</b> <b>$Carp::MaxArgNums</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>fixed</b>
       $Carp::MaxArgNums is supposed to be the number of arguments to display.  Prior to this version, it was
       instead showing $Carp::MaxArgNums + 1 arguments, contrary to the documentation.

   <b>Only</b> <b>blanks</b> <b>and</b> <b>tabs</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>within</b> <b>"[...]"</b> <b>within</b> <b>"(?[...])"</b>
       The experimental Extended Bracketed Character Classes can contain regular bracketed character classes
       within them.  These differ from regular ones in that white space is generally ignored, unless escaped by
       preceding it with a backslash.  The white space that is ignored is now limited to just tab "\t" and SPACE
       characters.  Previously, it was any white space.  See "Extended Bracketed Character Classes" in
       perlrecharclass.

</pre><h4><b>Deprecations</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Using</b> <b>code</b> <b>points</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>platform's</b> <b>"IV_MAX"</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>deprecated</b>
       Unicode defines code points in the range "0..0x10FFFF".  Some standards at one time defined them up to
       2**31 - 1, but Perl has allowed them to be as high as anything that will fit in a word on the platform
       being used.  However, use of those above the platform's "IV_MAX" is broken in some constructs, notably
       "tr///", regular expression patterns involving quantifiers, and in some arithmetic and comparison
       operations, such as being the upper limit of a loop.  Now the use of such code points raises a
       deprecation warning, unless that warning category is turned off.  "IV_MAX" is typically 2**31 -1 on
       32-bit platforms, and 2**63-1 on 64-bit ones.

   <b>Doing</b> <b>bitwise</b> <b>operations</b> <b>on</b> <b>strings</b> <b>containing</b> <b>code</b> <b>points</b> <b>above</b> <b>0xFF</b> <b>is</b> <b>deprecated</b>
       The string bitwise operators treat their operands as strings of bytes, and values beyond 0xFF are
       nonsensical in this context.  To operate on encoded bytes, first encode the strings.  To operate on code
       points' numeric values, use "split" and "map ord".  In the future, this warning will be replaced by an
       exception.

   <b>sysread(),</b> <b>syswrite(),</b> <b>recv()</b> <b>and</b> <b>send()</b> <b>are</b> <b>deprecated</b> <b>on</b> <b>:utf8</b> <b>handles</b>
       The sysread(), recv(), syswrite() and send() operators are deprecated on handles that have the ":utf8"
       layer, either explicitly, or implicitly, eg., with the :encoding(UTF-16LE) layer.

       Both sysread() and recv() currently use only the ":utf8" flag for the stream, ignoring the actual layers.
       Since sysread() and recv() do no UTF-8 validation they can end up creating invalidly encoded scalars.

       Similarly, syswrite() and send() use only the ":utf8" flag, otherwise ignoring any layers.  If the flag
       is set, both write the value UTF-8 encoded, even if the layer is some different encoding, such as the
       example above.

       Ideally, all of these operators would completely ignore the ":utf8" state, working only with bytes, but
       this would result in silently breaking existing code.  To avoid this a future version of perl will throw
       an exception when any of sysread(), recv(), syswrite() or send() are called on handle with the ":utf8"
       layer.

</pre><h4><b>Performance</b> <b>Enhancements</b></h4><pre>
       •   The  overhead of scope entry and exit has been considerably reduced, so for example subroutine calls,
           loops and basic blocks are all faster now.  This empty function call now takes  about  a  third  less
           time to execute:

               sub f{} f();

       •   Many languages, such as Chinese, are caseless.  Perl now knows about most common ones, and skips much
           of  the  work  when  a  program  tries  to  change  case in them (like ucfirst()) or match caselessly
           ("qr//i").  This will speed up a program, such  as  a  web  server,  that  can  operate  on  multiple
           languages, while it is operating on a caseless one.

       •   "/fixed-substr/" has been made much faster.

           On platforms with a libc memchr() implementation which makes good use of underlying hardware support,
           patterns  which  include  fixed substrings will now often be much faster; for example with glibc on a
           recent x86_64 CPU, this:

               $s = "a" x 1000 . "wxyz";
               $s =~ /wxyz/ for 1..30000

           is now about 7 times faster.  On systems with slow memchr(), e.g. 32-bit ARM Raspberry Pi, there will
           be a small or little speedup.  Conversely, some pathological cases, such as ""ab"  x  1000  =~  /aa/"
           will be slower now; up to 3 times slower on the rPi, 1.5x slower on x86_64.

       •   Faster addition, subtraction and multiplication.

           Since 5.8.0, arithmetic became slower due to the need to support 64-bit integers. To deal with 64-bit
           integers,  a  lot  more  corner cases need to be checked, which adds time. We now detect common cases
           where there is no need to check for those corner cases, and special-case them.

       •   Preincrement, predecrement, postincrement, and postdecrement have  been  made  faster  by  internally
           splitting the functions which handled multiple cases into different functions.

       •   Creating  Perl debugger data structures (see "Debugger Internals" in perldebguts) for XSUBs and const
           subs has been removed.  This removed one glob/scalar combo for each unique ".c" file that  XSUBs  and
           const  subs came from.  On startup ("perl -e"0"") about half a dozen glob/scalar debugger combos were
           created.  Loading XS modules created more  glob/scalar  combos.   These  things  were  being  created
           regardless  of  whether  the perl debugger was being used, and despite the fact that it can't debug C
           code anyway

       •   On Win32, "stat"ing or "-X"ing a path, if the file or directory does not exist, is  now  3.5x  faster
           than before.

       •   Single arguments in list assign are now slightly faster:

             ($x) = (...);
             (...) = ($x);

       •   Less peak memory is now used when compiling regular expression patterns.

</pre><h4><b>Documentation</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Changes</b> <b>to</b> <b>Existing</b> <b>Documentation</b>
       <u>perlapi</u>

       •   The  process of using undocumented globals has been documented, namely, that one should send email to
           <a href="mailto:perl5-porters@perl.org">perl5-porters@perl.org</a> &lt;<a href="mailto:perl5-porters@perl.org">mailto:perl5-porters@perl.org</a>&gt; first to get the go-ahead for documenting  and
           using an undocumented function or global variable.

       <u>perlcall</u>

       •   A number of cleanups have been made to perlcall, including:

           •   use "EXTEND(SP, n)" and PUSHs() instead of XPUSHs() where applicable and update prose to match

           •   add  POPu, POPul and POPpbytex to the "complete list of POP macros" and clarify the documentation
               for some of the existing entries, and a note about side-effects

           •   add API documentation for POPu and POPul

           •   use ERRSV more efficiently

           •   approaches to thread-safety storage of SVs.

       <u>perlfunc</u>

       •   The documentation of "hex" has been revised to clarify valid inputs.

       •   Better    explain     meaning     of     negative     PIDs     in     "waitpid".      [GH     #15108]
           &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/15108&gt;

       •   General  cleanup:  there's  more  consistency  now  (in  POD  usage,  grammar, code examples), better
           practices in code examples (use of "my", removal of bareword filehandles, dropped usage of  "&amp;"  when
           calling subroutines, ...), etc.

       <u>perlguts</u>

       •   A  new  section has been added, "Dynamic Scope and the Context Stack" in perlguts, which explains how
           the perl context stack works.

       <u>perllocale</u>

       •   A stronger caution about using locales in threaded applications is given.  Locales  are  not  thread-
           safe, and you can get wrong results or even segfaults if you use them there.

       <u>perlmodlib</u>

       •   We  now  recommend  contacting  the module-authors list or PAUSE in seeking guidance on the naming of
           modules.

       <u>perlop</u>

       •   The documentation of "qx//" now describes how $? is affected.

       <u>perlpolicy</u>

       •   This note has been added to perlpolicy:

            While civility is required, kindness is encouraged; if you have any
            doubt about whether you are being civil, simply ask yourself, "Am I
            being kind?" and aspire to that.

       <u>perlreftut</u>

       •   Fix some examples to be strict clean.

       <u>perlrebackslash</u>

       •   Clarify that in languages like Japanese and Thai, dictionary lookup is  required  to  determine  word
           boundaries.

       <u>perlsub</u>

       •   Updated to note that anonymous subroutines can have signatures.

       <u>perlsyn</u>

       •   Fixed a broken example where "=" was used instead of "==" in conditional in do/while example.

       <u>perltie</u>

       •   The usage of "FIRSTKEY" and "NEXTKEY" has been clarified.

       <u>perlunicode</u>

       •   Discourage use of 'In' as a prefix signifying the Unicode Block property.

       <u>perlvar</u>

       •   The documentation of $@ was reworded to clarify that it is not just for syntax errors in "eval".  [GH
           #14572] &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/14572&gt;

       •   The  specific  true  value of $!{E...} is now documented, noting that it is subject to change and not
           guaranteed.

       •   Use of $OLD_PERL_VERSION is now discouraged.

       <u>perlxs</u>

       •   The documentation of "PROTOTYPES" has been corrected; they are <u>disabled</u> by default, not <u>enabled</u>.

</pre><h4><b>Diagnostics</b></h4><pre>
       The following additions or changes have been made to diagnostic  output,  including  warnings  and  fatal
       error messages.  For the complete list of diagnostic messages, see perldiag.

   <b>New</b> <b>Diagnostics</b>
       <u>New</u> <u>Errors</u>

       •   %s must not be a named sequence in transliteration operator

       •   Can't find Unicode property definition "%s" in regex;

       •   Can't redeclare "%s" in "%s"

       •   Character following \p must be '{' or a single-character Unicode property name in regex;

       •   Empty \%c in regex; marked by &lt;-- HERE in m/%s/

       •   Illegal user-defined property name

       •   Invalid number '%s' for -C option.

       •   Sequence (?... not terminated in regex; marked by &lt;-- HERE in m/%s/

       •   Sequence (?P&lt;... not terminated in regex; marked by &lt;-- HERE in m/%s/

       •   Sequence (?P&gt;... not terminated in regex; marked by &lt;-- HERE in m/%s/

       <u>New</u> <u>Warnings</u>

       •   Assuming NOT a POSIX class since %s in regex; marked by &lt;-- HERE in m/%s/

       •   %s() is deprecated on :utf8 handles

   <b>Changes</b> <b>to</b> <b>Existing</b> <b>Diagnostics</b>
       •   Accessing  the  "IO"  part  of a glob as "FILEHANDLE" instead of "IO" is no longer deprecated.  It is
           discouraged to encourage uniformity (so that, for example, one can grep more easily) but it will  not
           be removed.  [GH #15105] &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/15105&gt;

       •   The  diagnostic  "Hexadecimal float: internal error" has been changed to "Hexadecimal float: internal
           error (%s)" to include more information.

       •   Can't modify non-lvalue subroutine call of &amp;%s

           This error now reports the name of the non-lvalue subroutine you attempted to use as an lvalue.

       •   When running out of memory during an attempt the increase the stack size, previously, perl would  die
           using  the cryptic message "panic: av_extend_guts() negative count (-9223372036854775681)".  This has
           been fixed to show the prettier message: Out of memory during stack extend

</pre><h4><b>Configuration</b> <b>and</b> <b>Compilation</b></h4><pre>
       •   "Configure" now acts as if the "-O" option  is  always  passed,  allowing  command  line  options  to
           override  saved configuration.  This should eliminate confusion when command line options are ignored
           for no obvious reason.  "-O" is now permitted, but ignored.

       •   Bison 3.0 is now supported.

       •   <u>Configure</u> no longer probes for <u>libnm</u> by default.  Originally this was the "New Math" library, but the
           name     has     been     re-used     by     the     GNOME     NetworkManager.       [GH      #15115]
           &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/15115&gt;

       •   Added <u>Configure</u> probes for "newlocale", "freelocale", and "uselocale".

       •   "PPPort.so/PPPort.dll" no longer get installed, as they are not used by "PPPort.pm", only by its test
           files.

       •   It  is  now  possible  to  specify which compilation date to show on "perl -V" output, by setting the
           macro "PERL_BUILD_DATE".

       •   Using   the   "NO_HASH_SEED"   define   in   combination   with   the    default    hash    algorithm
           "PERL_HASH_FUNC_ONE_AT_A_TIME_HARD"  resulted in a fatal error while compiling the interpreter, since
           Perl 5.17.10.  This has been fixed.

       •   <u>Configure</u> should handle spaces in paths a little better.

       •   No longer generate EBCDIC POSIX-BC tables.  We don't believe anyone is using  Perl  and  POSIX-BC  at
           this  time,  and  by  not  generating  these  tables  it saves time during development, and makes the
           resulting tar ball smaller.

       •   The GNU Make makefile for Win32 now supports parallel builds.  [perl #126632]

       •   You can now build perl with MSVC++ on Win32 using GNU Make.  [perl #126632]

       •   The Win32 miniperl now has a real "getcwd" which increases build performance  resulting  in  getcwd()
           being 605x faster in Win32 miniperl.

       •   Configure  now  takes  "-Dusequadmath"  into  account when calculating the "alignbytes" configuration
           variable.  Previously the mis-calculated "alignbytes"  could  cause  alignment  errors  on  debugging
           builds. [perl #127894]

</pre><h4><b>Testing</b></h4><pre>
       •   A new test (<u>t/op/aassign.t</u>) has been added to test the list assignment operator "OP_AASSIGN".

       •   Parallel  building  has  been  added  to  the  dmake  "makefile.mk" makefile. All Win32 compilers are
           supported.

</pre><h4><b>Platform</b> <b>Support</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Platform-Specific</b> <b>Notes</b>
       AmigaOS
           •   The AmigaOS port has been reintegrated into the main tree, based off of Perl 5.22.1.

       Cygwin
           •   Tests    are    more    robust    against    unusual    cygdrive    prefixes.     [GH     #15076]
               &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/15076&gt;

       EBCDIC
           UTF-EBCDIC extended
               UTF-EBCDIC  is  like  UTF-8,  but  for EBCDIC platforms.  It now has been extended so that it can
               represent code points up to 2 ** 64 - 1 on platforms with 64-bit  words.   This  brings  it  into
               parity  with  UTF-8.   This  enhancement requires an incompatible change to the representation of
               code points in the range 2 ** 30 to 2 ** 31 -1 (the latter was the previous maximum representable
               code point).  This means that a file that contains one of these code  points,  written  out  with
               previous  versions  of  perl  cannot  be  read  in, without conversion, by a perl containing this
               change.  We do not believe any such files are in existence, but if you  do  have  one,  submit  a
               ticket  at  <a href="mailto:perlbug@perl.org">perlbug@perl.org</a> &lt;<a href="mailto:perlbug@perl.org">mailto:perlbug@perl.org</a>&gt;, and we will write a conversion script for
               you.

           EBCDIC cmp() and sort() fixed for UTF-EBCDIC strings
               Comparing two strings that were both encoded in UTF-8 (or more  precisely,  UTF-EBCDIC)  did  not
               work properly until now.  Since sort() uses cmp(), this fixes that as well.

           EBCDIC "tr///" and "y///" fixed for "\N{}", and "use utf8" ranges
               Perl  v5.22 introduced the concept of portable ranges to regular expression patterns.  A portable
               range matches the same set of characters no matter what platform is being run on.   This  concept
               is now extended to "tr///".  See "tr///".

               There were also some problems with these operations under "use utf8", which are now fixed

       FreeBSD
           •   Use    the    fdclose()    function   from   FreeBSD   if   it   is   available.    [GH   #15082]
               &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/15082&gt;

       IRIX
           •   Under some circumstances IRIX stdio fgetc() and fread() set the errno to "ENOENT", which made  no
               sense  according  to either IRIX or POSIX docs.  Errno is now cleared in such cases.  [GH #14557]
               &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/14557&gt;

           •   Problems  when  multiplying  long  doubles  by   infinity   have   been   fixed.    [GH   #14993]
               &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/14993&gt;

       MacOS X
           •   Until  now  OS X builds of perl have specified a link target of 10.3 (Panther, 2003) but have not
               specified a compiler target.  From now on, builds of perl on OS X 10.6 or  later  (Snow  Leopard,
               2008)  by  default capture the current OS X version and specify that as the explicit build target
               in both compiler and linker flags, thus preserving  binary  compatibility  for  extensions  built
               later  regardless  of  changes  in  OS  X, SDK, or compiler and linker versions.  To override the
               default  value  used   in   the   build   and   preserved   in   the   flags,   specify   "export
               MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.N" before configuring and building perl, where 10.N is the version of
               OS X you wish to target.  In OS X 10.5 or earlier there is no change to the behavior present when
               those  systems were current; the link target is still OS X 10.3 and there is no explicit compiler
               target.

           •   Builds with both -DDEBUGGING and threading enabled would fail with  a  "panic:  free  from  wrong
               pool"  error  when  built  or  tested  from Terminal on OS X.  This was caused by perl's internal
               management of the environment conflicting with an atfork handler using the libc setenv() function
               to update the environment.

               Perl  now  uses  setenv()/unsetenv()  to  update  the  environment  on   OS   X.    [GH   #14955]
               &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/14955&gt;

       Solaris
           •   All Solaris variants now build a shared libperl

               Solaris  and  variants  like OpenIndiana now always build with the shared Perl library (Configure
               -Duseshrplib).  This was required for the OpenIndiana builds, but this has also been the  setting
               for Oracle/Sun Perl builds for several years.

       Tru64
           •   Workaround  where  Tru64  balks when prototypes are listed as "PERL_STATIC_INLINE", but where the
               test is build with "-DPERL_NO_INLINE_FUNCTIONS".

       VMS
           •   On VMS, the math function prototypes in "math.h" are now visible under  C++.   Now  building  the
               POSIX extension with C++ will no longer crash.

           •   VMS  has  had "setenv"/"unsetenv" since v7.0 (released in 1996), "Perl_vmssetenv" now always uses
               "setenv"/"unsetenv".

           •   Perl now implements its own "killpg" by scanning for processes in the  specified  process  group,
               which may not mean exactly the same thing as a Unix process group, but allows us to send a signal
               to  a  parent (or master) process and all of its sub-processes.  At the perl level, this means we
               can now send a negative pid like so:

                   kill SIGKILL, -$pid;

               to signal all processes in the same group as $pid.

           •   For those %ENV elements based on the CRTL environ array, we've always preserved case when setting
               them but did look-ups only after upcasing the key first, which made lower- or mixed-case  entries
               go  missing.  This  problem  has  been corrected by making %ENV elements derived from the environ
               array case-sensitive on look-up as well as case-preserving on store.

           •   Environment look-ups for "PERL5LIB" and "PERLLIB" previously only considered logical  names,  but
               now  consider  all sources of %ENV as determined by "PERL_ENV_TABLES" and as documented in "%ENV"
               in perlvms.

           •   The minimum supported version of VMS is now v7.3-2, released in 2003.  As a side effect  of  this
               change, VAX is no longer supported as the terminal release of OpenVMS VAX was v7.3 in 2001.

       Win32
           •   A  new  build  option  "USE_NO_REGISTRY"  has been added to the makefiles.  This option is off by
               default, meaning the default is to do Windows registry lookups.   This  option  stops  Perl  from
               looking  inside  the  registry  for  anything.  For what values are looked up in the registry see
               perlwin32.  Internally, in C, the name of this option is "WIN32_NO_REGISTRY".

           •   The      behavior      of      Perl       using       "HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Perl"       and
               "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Perl"  to  lookup  certain values, including %ENV vars starting with
               "PERL" has changed.  Previously, the 2 keys were checked for entries at  all  times  through  the
               perl  process's  life time even if they did not exist.  For performance reasons, now, if the root
               key (i.e.   "HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Perl"  or  "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Perl")  does  not
               exist  at  process  start  time,  it  will not be checked again for %ENV override entries for the
               remainder of the perl process's life.  This more  closely  matches  Unix  behavior  in  that  the
               environment  is copied or inherited on startup and changing the variable in the parent process or
               another process or editing <u>.bashrc</u> will not change the environmental variable in other  existing,
               running, processes.

           •   One glob fetch was removed for each "-X" or "stat" call whether done from Perl code or internally
               from  Perl's  C  code.   The  glob being looked up was "${^WIN32_SLOPPY_STAT}" which is a special
               variable.  This makes "-X" and "stat" slightly faster.

           •   During miniperl's process startup, during the build process, 4 to  8  IO  calls  related  to  the
               process  starting  <u>.pl</u>  and  the  <u>buildcustomize.pl</u>  file  were removed from the code opening and
               executing the first 1 or 2 <u>.pl</u> files.

           •   Builds using Microsoft Visual C++ 2003 and earlier no longer produce an "INTERNAL COMPILER ERROR"
               message.  [perl #126045]

           •   Visual C++ 2013 builds will now execute on XP and higher. Previously they would only  execute  on
               Vista and higher.

           •   You can now build perl with GNU Make and GCC.  [perl #123440]

           •   "truncate($filename, $size)" now works for files over 4GB in size.  [perl #125347]

           •   Parallel  building  has  been  added to the dmake "makefile.mk" makefile. All Win32 compilers are
               supported.

           •   Building a 64-bit perl with a  64-bit  GCC  but  a  32-bit  gmake  would  result  in  an  invalid
               $Config{archname} for the resulting perl.  [perl #127584]

           •   Errors  set  by  Winsock  functions are now put directly into $^E, and the relevant "WSAE*" error
               codes are now exported from the Errno and POSIX modules for testing this against.

               The previous behavior of putting the errors (converted to POSIX-style "E*" error codes since Perl
               5.20.0) into $! was buggy due to the  non-equivalence  of  like-named  Winsock  and  POSIX  error
               constants,  a relationship between which has unfortunately been established in one way or another
               since Perl 5.8.0.

               The new behavior provides a much more robust solution for checking  Winsock  errors  in  portable
               software without accidentally matching POSIX tests that were intended for other OSes and may have
               different meanings for Winsock.

               The old behavior is currently retained, warts and all, for backwards compatibility, but users are
               encouraged to change any code that tests $!  against "E*" constants for Winsock errors to instead
               test $^E against "WSAE*" constants.  After a suitable deprecation period, the old behavior may be
               removed,  leaving $! unchanged after Winsock function calls, to avoid any possible confusion over
               which error variable to check.

       ppc64el
           floating point
               The floating point format of ppc64el (Debian naming for little-endian PowerPC)  is  now  detected
               correctly.

</pre><h4><b>Internal</b> <b>Changes</b></h4><pre>
       •   The  implementation of perl's context stack system, and its internal API, have been heavily reworked.
           Note that no significant changes have been made to any external APIs, but XS  code  which  relies  on
           such internal details may need to be fixed. The main changes are:

           •   The  PUSHBLOCK(),  POPSUB()  etc.  macros have been replaced with static inline functions such as
               cx_pushblock(), cx_popsub() etc. These use function args rather than implicitly relying on  local
               vars  such  as  "gimme"  and  "newsp"  being  available. Also their functionality has changed: in
               particular, cx_popblock() no longer decrements "cxstack_ix". The ordering of  the  steps  in  the
               "pp_leave*"  functions  involving  cx_popblock(),  cx_popsub()  etc.  has  changed.  See  the new
               documentation, "Dynamic Scope and the Context Stack" in perlguts, for details on how to use them.

           •   Various macros, which now consistently have a CX_ prefix, have been added:

                 CX_CUR(), CX_LEAVE_SCOPE(), CX_POP()

               or renamed:

                 CX_POP_SAVEARRAY(), CX_DEBUG(), CX_PUSHSUBST(), CX_POPSUBST()

           •   cx_pushblock() now saves "PL_savestack_ix" and "PL_tmps_floor", so "pp_enter*" and "pp_leave*" no
               longer do

                 ENTER; SAVETMPS; ....; LEAVE

           •   cx_popblock() now also restores "PL_curpm".

           •   In dounwind() for every context type, the current savestack frame is now  processed  before  each
               context  is popped; formerly this was only done for sub-like context frames. This action has been
               removed from cx_popsub() and placed into its own macro, CX_LEAVE_SCOPE(cx), which must be  called
               before cx_popsub() etc.

               dounwind()  now  also  does  a  cx_popblock()  on the last popped frame (formerly it only did the
               cx_popsub() etc. actions on each frame).

           •   The temps stack is now freed on scope exit; previously, temps created during the  last  statement
               of  a  block  wouldn't  be  freed  until  the next "nextstate" following the block (apart from an
               existing hack that did this for  recursive  subs  in  scalar  context);  and  in  something  like
               "f(g())",  the  temps  created by the last statement in g() would formerly not be freed until the
               statement following the return from f().

           •   Most values that were saved on the savestack on scope entry are now saved in suitable new  fields
               in  the context struct, and saved and restored directly by cx_pushfoo() and cx_popfoo(), which is
               much faster.

           •   Various context struct fields have been added, removed or modified.

           •   The handling of @_ in cx_pushsub() and cx_popsub() has been  considerably  tidied  up,  including
               removing the "argarray" field from the context struct, and extracting out some common (but rarely
               used)  code into a separate function, clear_defarray(). Also, useful subsets of cx_popsub() which
               had  been  unrolled  in  places  like  "pp_goto"  have  been  gathered  into  the  new  functions
               cx_popsub_args() and cx_popsub_common().

           •   "pp_leavesub"  and  "pp_leavesublv" now use the same function as the rest of the "pp_leave*"'s to
               process return args.

           •   "CXp_FOR_PAD" and "CXp_FOR_GV" flags have been added, and  "CXt_LOOP_FOR"  has  been  split  into
               "CXt_LOOP_LIST", "CXt_LOOP_ARY".

           •   Some variables formerly declared by "dMULTICALL" (but not documented) have been removed.

       •   The  obscure  "PL_timesbuf"  variable,  effectively  a  vestige  of  Perl 1, has been removed. It was
           documented as deprecated in Perl 5.20, with a statement that it would be removed early in the  5.21.x
           series; that has now finally happened.  [GH #13632] &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/13632&gt;

       •   An  unwarranted  assertion  in Perl_newATTRSUB_x() has been removed.  If a stub subroutine definition
           with a prototype has been seen, then any subsequent stub (or definition) of the same subroutine  with
           an   attribute   was   causing  an  assertion  failure  because  of  a  null  pointer.   [GH  #15081]
           &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/15081&gt;

       •   "::" has been replaced by "__" in "ExtUtils::ParseXS", like it's done for  parameters/return  values.
           This  is  more  consistent,  and  simplifies  writing XS code wrapping C++ classes into a nested Perl
           namespace (it requires only a typedef for "Foo__Bar" rather than two, one for "Foo_Bar" and the other
           for "Foo::Bar").

       •   The  to_utf8_case()  function  is  now  deprecated.   Instead  use  "toUPPER_utf8",   "toTITLE_utf8",
           "toLOWER_utf8", and "toFOLD_utf8".  (See &lt;<a href="http://nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/233287">http://nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/233287</a>&gt;.)

       •   Perl  core  code  and the threads extension have been annotated so that, if Perl is configured to use
           threads, then during compile-time clang (3.6 or later) will warn about suspicious  uses  of  mutexes.
           See &lt;<a href="http://clang.llvm.org/docs/ThreadSafetyAnalysis.html">http://clang.llvm.org/docs/ThreadSafetyAnalysis.html</a>&gt; for more information.

       •   The  signbit()  emulation  has  been  enhanced.  This will help older and/or more exotic platforms or
           configurations.

       •   Most EBCDIC-specific code in the core has been unified with non-EBCDIC code, to avoid repetition  and
           make maintenance easier.

       •   MSWin32  code  for  $^X  has been moved out of the <u>win32</u> directory to <u>caretx.c</u>, where other operating
           systems set that variable.

       •   sv_ref() is now part of the API.

       •   "sv_backoff" in perlapi had its return type changed from "int" to "void".  It previously  has  always
           returned  0  since  Perl  5.000 stable but that was undocumented.  Although "sv_backoff" is marked as
           public API, XS code is not expected to be impacted since the proper API call would be through  public
           API  "sv_setsv(sv,  &amp;PL_sv_undef)",  or quasi-public "SvOOK_off", or non-public "SvOK_off" calls, and
           the return value of "sv_backoff" was previously a meaningless  constant  that  can  be  rewritten  as
           "(sv_backoff(sv),0)".

       •   The  "EXTEND" and "MEXTEND" macros have been improved to avoid various issues with integer truncation
           and wrapping.  In particular, some casts formerly used within the macros  have  been  removed.   This
           means  for  example  that passing an unsigned "nitems" argument is likely to raise a compiler warning
           now (it's always been documented to require a signed value; formerly int, lately SSize_t).

       •   "PL_sawalias" and "GPf_ALIASED_SV" have been removed.

       •   "GvASSIGN_GENERATION" and "GvASSIGN_GENERATION_set" have been removed.

</pre><h4><b>Selected</b> <b>Bug</b> <b>Fixes</b></h4><pre>
       •   It now works properly to specify a user-defined property, such as

            qr/\p{mypkg1::IsMyProperty}/i

           with "/i" caseless matching, an explicit package name, and <u>IsMyProperty</u> not defined at  the  time  of
           the pattern compilation.

       •   Perl's  memcpy(),  memmove(),  memset()  and  memcmp()  fallbacks  are  now  more compatible with the
           originals.  [perl #127619]

       •   Fixed the issue where a "s///r") with <b>-DPERL_NO_COW</b> attempts to modify the source  SV,  resulting  in
           the program dying. [perl #127635]

       •   Fixed  an  EBCDIC-platform-only case where a pattern could fail to match. This occurred when matching
           characters from the set of C1 controls when the target matched string was in UTF-8.

       •   Narrow the filename check in <u>strict.pm</u> and <u>warnings.pm</u>. Previously, it assumed that if  the  filename
           (without the <u>.pmc?</u> extension) differed from the package name, if was a misspelled use statement (i.e.
           "use  Strict"  instead  of  "use  strict").  We  now check whether there's really a miscapitalization
           happening, and not some other issue.

       •   Turn an assertion into a more user friendly failure when parsing regexes. [perl #127599]

       •   Correctly raise an error when trying to compile patterns with unterminated  character  classes  while
           there are trailing backslashes.  [perl #126141].

       •   Line  numbers  larger than 2**31-1 but less than 2**32 are no longer returned by caller() as negative
           numbers.  [perl #126991]

       •   "unless ( <u>assignment</u> )" now properly warns when syntax warnings are enabled.  [perl #127122]

       •   Setting an "ISA" glob to an array reference  now  properly  adds  "isaelem"  magic  to  any  existing
           elements.  Previously modifying such an element would not update the ISA cache, so method calls would
           call the wrong function.  Perl would also crash if the "ISA" glob was destroyed, since new code added
           in 5.23.7 would try to release the "isaelem" magic from the elements.  [perl #127351]

       •   If  a here-doc was found while parsing another operator, the parser had already read end of file, and
           the here-doc was not terminated, perl could produce an assertion or a segmentation fault.   This  now
           reliably complains about the unterminated here-doc.  [perl #125540]

       •   untie()  would  sometimes return the last value returned by the UNTIE() handler as well as its normal
           value, messing up the stack.  [perl #126621]

       •   Fixed an operator precedence problem when " castflags &amp; 2" is true.  [perl #127474]

       •   Caching of DESTROY methods could result in a non-pointer or a non-STASH stored in the SvSTASH()  slot
           of  a stash, breaking the B STASH() method.  The DESTROY method is now cached in the MRO metadata for
           the stash.  [perl #126410]

       •   The AUTOLOAD method is now called when searching for a DESTROY method, and correctly  sets  $AUTOLOAD
           too.  [perl #124387]  [perl #127494]

       •   Avoid  parsing  beyond  the  end  of the buffer when processing a "#line" directive with no filename.
           [perl #127334]

       •   Perl now raises a warning when a regular expression pattern looks like it was supposed to  contain  a
           POSIX  class,  like  "qr/[[:alpha:]]/",  but  there was some slight defect in its specification which
           causes it to instead be treated as a regular bracketed character class.  An example would be  missing
           the  second colon in the above like this: "qr/[[:alpha]]/".  This compiles to match a sequence of two
           characters.  The second is "]", and the first is any of: "[", ":", "a", "h", "l", or "p".    This  is
           unlikely  to  be  the intended meaning, and now a warning is raised.  No warning is raised unless the
           specification is very close to one of the 14 legal POSIX classes.  (See "POSIX Character Classes"  in
           perlrecharclass.)  [perl #8904]

       •   Certain regex patterns involving a complemented POSIX class in an inverted bracketed character class,
           and  matching something else optionally would improperly fail to match.  An example of one that could
           fail is "qr/_?[^\Wbar]\x{100}/".  This has been fixed.  [perl #127537]

       •   Perl 5.22 added support to the C99 hexadecimal floating point notation, but sometimes  misparses  hex
           floats. This has been fixed.  [perl #127183]

       •   A  regression  that  allowed  undeclared  barewords  in hash keys to work despite strictures has been
           fixed.  [GH #15099] &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/15099&gt;

       •   Calls to the placeholder &amp;PL_sv_yes used internally when an import() or unimport() method isn't found
           now correctly handle scalar context.  [GH #14902] &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/14902&gt;

       •   Report more context when we see an array where we expect to see an operator and  avoid  an  assertion
           failure.  [GH #14472] &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/14472&gt;

       •   Modifying an array that was previously a package @ISA no longer causes assertion failures or crashes.
           [GH #14492] &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/14492&gt;

       •   Retain    binary   compatibility   across   plain   and   DEBUGGING   perl   builds.    [GH   #15122]
           &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/15122&gt;

       •   Avoid    leaking    memory     when     setting     $ENV{foo}     on     darwin.      [GH     #14955]
           &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/14955&gt;

       •   "/...\G/" no longer crashes on utf8 strings. When "\G" is a fixed number of characters from the start
           of the regex, perl needs to count back that many characters from the current pos() position and start
           matching  from there. However, it was counting back bytes rather than characters, which could lead to
           panics on utf8 strings.

       •   In some cases operators that return  integers  would  return  negative  integers  as  large  positive
           integers.  [GH #15049] &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/15049&gt;

       •   The pipe() operator would assert for DEBUGGING builds instead of producing the correct error message.
           The  condition  asserted  on  is  detected  and  reported on correctly without the assertions, so the
           assertions were removed.  [GH #15015] &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/15015&gt;

       •   In some cases, failing to parse a here-doc would attempt to use freed memory.  This was caused  by  a
           pointer not being restored correctly.  [GH #15009] &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/15009&gt;

       •   "@x  = sort { *a = 0; $a &lt;=&gt; $b } 0 .. 1" no longer frees the GP for *a before restoring its SV slot.
           [GH #14595] &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/14595&gt;

       •   Multiple problems with the new hexadecimal floating point printf format %a were  fixed:  [GH  #15032]
           &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/15032&gt;,                       [GH                       #15033]
           &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/15033&gt;,                       [GH                       #15074]
           &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/15074&gt;

       •   Calling mg_set() in leave_scope() no longer leaks.

       •   A  regression  from  Perl v5.20 was fixed in which debugging output of regular expression compilation
           was wrong.  (The pattern was correctly compiled, but what got displayed for it was wrong.)

       •   "\b{sb}" works much better.  In Perl v5.22.0, this new construct didn't seem  to  give  the  expected
           results,  yet passed all the tests in the extensive suite furnished by Unicode.  It turns out that it
           was because these were short input strings, and the failures had to do with longer inputs.

       •   Certain syntax errors in "Extended Bracketed Character  Classes"  in  perlrecharclass  caused  panics
           instead of the proper error message.  This has now been fixed. [perl #126481]

       •   Perl  5.20 added a message when a quantifier in a regular expression was useless, but then caused the
           parser to skip it; this caused the surplus quantifier to be silently ignored, instead of throwing  an
           error. This is now fixed. [perl #126253]

       •   The  switch to building non-XS modules last in win32/makefile.mk (introduced by design as part of the
           changes to enable parallel building) caused the build of POSIX to break  due  to  problems  with  the
           version module. This is now fixed.

       •   Improved parsing of hex float constants.

       •   Fixed  an issue with "pack" where "pack "H"" (and "pack "h"") could read past the source when given a
           non-utf8 source, and a utf8 target.  [perl #126325]

       •   Fixed several cases where perl would abort due to a segmentation fault, or a  C-level  assert.  [perl
           #126615], [perl #126602], [perl #126193].

       •   There  were  places  in  regular expression patterns where comments ("(?#...)")  weren't allowed, but
           should have been.  This is now fixed.  [GH #12755] &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/12755&gt;

       •   Some regressions from Perl 5.20 have been fixed, in which some syntax errors in "(?[...])" constructs
           within regular expression patterns could cause a segfault instead of a  proper  error  message.   [GH
           #14933]              &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/14933&gt;             [GH             #14996]

       •   Another problem with "(?[...])"  constructs has been fixed wherein  things  like  "\c]"  could  cause
           panics.  [GH #14934] &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/14934&gt;

       •   Some  problems  with  attempting to extend the perl stack to around 2G or 4G entries have been fixed.
           This was particularly an issue on  32-bit  perls  built  to  use  64-bit  integers,  and  was  easily
           noticeable with the list repetition operator, e.g.

               @a = (1) x $big_number

           Formerly  perl  may  have crashed, depending on the exact value of $big_number; now it will typically
           raise an exception.  [GH #14880] &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/14880&gt;

       •   In a regex conditional expression "(?(condition)yes-pattern|no-pattern)", if the condition is  "(?!)"
           then  perl  failed  the match outright instead of matching the no-pattern.  This has been fixed.  [GH
           #14947] &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/14947&gt;

       •   The special backtracking control verbs "(*VERB:ARG)" now all  allow  an  optional  argument  and  set
           "REGERROR"/"REGMARK" appropriately as well.  [GH #14937] &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/14937&gt;

       •   Several  bugs,  including a segmentation fault, have been fixed with the boundary checking constructs
           (introduced in Perl 5.22) "\b{gcb}", "\b{sb}", "\b{wb}", "\B{gcb}", "\B{sb}", and "\B{wb}".  All  the
           "\B{}"   ones   now   match   an   empty   string;   none   of  the  "\b{}"  ones  do.   [GH  #14976]
           &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/14976&gt;

       •   Duplicating a closed file handle for write no longer creates a filename of the form <u><a href="../man0xXXXXXXXX/GLOB.0xXXXXXXXX.html">GLOB</a>(0xXXXXXXXX)</u>.
           [perl #125115]

       •   Warning fatality is now ignored when rewinding the stack.  This prevents infinite recursion when  the
           now fatal error also causes rewinding of the stack.  [perl #123398]

       •   In  perl  v5.22.0, the logic changed when parsing a numeric parameter to the -C option, such that the
           successfully parsed number was not saved as the option value if it parsed to the end of the argument.
           [perl #125381]

       •   The PadlistNAMES macro is an lvalue again.

       •   Zero -DPERL_TRACE_OPS memory for sub-threads.

           perl_clone_using() was missing Zero init of PL_op_exec_cnt[].  This caused  sub-threads  in  threaded
           -DPERL_TRACE_OPS builds to spew exceedingly large op-counts at destruct.  These counts would print %x
           as "ABABABAB", clearly a mem-poison value.

       •   A  leak  in  the  XS  typemap caused one scalar to be leaked each time a "FILE *" or a "PerlIO *" was
           "OUTPUT:"ed or imported to Perl, since perl 5.000. These particular typemap entries are thought to be
           extremely rarely used by XS modules. [perl #124181]

       •   alarm() and sleep() will now warn if the argument is a negative number and return  undef.  Previously
           they  would pass the negative value to the underlying C function which may have set up a timer with a
           surprising value.

       •   Perl can again be compiled with any Unicode version.  This used to (mostly) work,  but  was  lost  in
           v5.18  through  v5.20.   The  property "Name_Alias" did not exist prior to Unicode 5.0.  Unicode::UCD
           incorrectly said it did.  This has been fixed.

       •   Very large code-points (beyond Unicode) in regular expressions no longer cause a buffer  overflow  in
           some cases when converted to UTF-8.  [GH #14858] &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/14858&gt;

       •   The  integer  overflow  check  for the range operator (...) in list context now correctly handles the
           case where the size of the range is larger than the address space.  This could happen on 32-bits with
           -Duse64bitint.  [GH #14843] &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/14843&gt;

       •   A     crash     with     "%::=();     J-&gt;${\"::"}"     has     been     fixed.       [GH      #14790]
           &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/14790&gt;

       •   "qr/(?[ () ])/" no longer segfaults, giving a syntax error message instead.  [perl #125805]

       •   Regular  expression  possessive  quantifier v5.20 regression now fixed.  "qr/"<u>PAT</u>"{"<u>min</u>,<u>max</u>"}+""/" is
           supposed to behave identically to "qr/(?&gt;"<u>PAT</u>"{"<u>min</u>,<u>max</u>"})/".  Since v5.20, this didn't work  if  <u>min</u>
           and <u>max</u> were equal.  [perl #125825]

       •   "BEGIN &lt;&gt;" no longer segfaults and properly produces an error message.  [perl #125341]

       •   In  "tr///"  an  illegal  backwards range like "tr/\x{101}-\x{100}//" was not always detected, giving
           incorrect results.  This is now fixed.

       The  list  above  is  almost  certainly  incomplete as it is automatically generated from version control
       history. In particular, it does not include the names of the (very  much  appreciated)  contributors  who
       reported issues to the Perl bug tracker.

       Many  of  the  changes  included  in this version originated in the CPAN modules included in Perl's core.
       We're grateful to the entire CPAN community for helping Perl to flourish.
