       This section of the FAQ answers questions about where to find source and documentation for Perl, support,
       and related matters.

   <b>What</b> <b>machines</b> <b>support</b> <b>Perl?</b> <b>Where</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>it?</b>
       The standard release of Perl (the one maintained by the Perl development team) is distributed only in
       source code form. You can find the latest releases at &lt;<a href="http://www.cpan.org/src/">http://www.cpan.org/src/</a>&gt;.

       Perl builds and runs on a bewildering number of platforms. Virtually all known and current Unix
       derivatives are supported (perl's native platform), as are other systems like VMS, DOS, OS/2, Windows,
       QNX, BeOS, OS X, MPE/iX and the Amiga.

       Binary distributions for some proprietary platforms can be found &lt;<a href="http://www.cpan.org/ports/">http://www.cpan.org/ports/</a>&gt; directory.
       Because these are not part of the standard distribution, they may and in fact do differ from the base
       perl port in a variety of ways. You'll have to check their respective release notes to see just what the
       differences are. These differences can be either positive (e.g. extensions for the features of the
       particular platform that are not supported in the source release of perl) or negative (e.g. might be
       based upon a less current source release of perl).

   <b>How</b> <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>binary</b> <b>version</b> <b>of</b> <b>Perl?</b>
       See CPAN Ports &lt;<a href="http://www.cpan.org/ports/">http://www.cpan.org/ports/</a>&gt;

   <b>I</b> <b>don't</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>C</b> <b>compiler.</b> <b>How</b> <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>build</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>Perl</b> <b>interpreter?</b>
       For Windows, use a binary version of Perl, Strawberry Perl &lt;<a href="http://strawberryperl.com/">http://strawberryperl.com/</a>&gt; and ActivePerl
       &lt;<a href="http://www.activestate.com/activeperl">http://www.activestate.com/activeperl</a>&gt; come with a bundled C compiler.

       Otherwise if you really do want to build Perl, you need to get a binary version of "gcc" for your system
       first. Use a search engine to find out how to do this for your operating system.

   <b>I</b> <b>copied</b> <b>the</b> <b>Perl</b> <b>binary</b> <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>machine</b> <b>to</b> <b>another,</b> <b>but</b> <b>scripts</b> <b>don't</b> <b>work.</b>
       That's probably because you forgot libraries, or library paths differ.  You really should build the whole
       distribution on the machine it will eventually live on, and then type "make install". Most other
       approaches are doomed to failure.

       One simple way to check that things are in the right place is to print out the hard-coded @INC that perl
       looks through for libraries:

           % perl -le 'print for @INC'

       If this command lists any paths that don't exist on your system, then you may need to move the
       appropriate libraries to these locations, or create symbolic links, aliases, or shortcuts appropriately.
       @INC is also printed as part of the output of

           % perl -V

       You might also want to check out "How do I keep my own module/library directory?" in perlfaq8.

   <b>I</b> <b>grabbed</b> <b>the</b> <b>sources</b> <b>and</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>compile</b> <b>but</b> <b>gdbm/dynamic</b> <b>loading/malloc/linking/...</b> <b>failed.</b> <b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>make</b>
       <b>it</b> <b>work?</b>
       Read the <u>INSTALL</u> file, which is part of the source distribution.  It describes in detail how to cope with
       most idiosyncrasies that the "Configure" script can't work around for any given system or architecture.

   <b>What</b> <b>modules</b> <b>and</b> <b>extensions</b> <b>are</b> <b>available</b> <b>for</b> <b>Perl?</b> <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>CPAN?</b>
       CPAN stands for Comprehensive Perl Archive Network, a multi-gigabyte archive replicated on hundreds of
       machines all over the world. CPAN contains tens of thousands of modules and extensions, source code and
       documentation, designed for <u>everything</u> from commercial database interfaces to keyboard/screen control and
       running large web sites.

       You can search CPAN on &lt;<a href="http://metacpan.org">http://metacpan.org</a>&gt;.

       The master web site for CPAN is &lt;<a href="http://www.cpan.org/">http://www.cpan.org/</a>&gt;, &lt;<a href="http://www.cpan.org/SITES.html">http://www.cpan.org/SITES.html</a>&gt; lists all
       mirrors.

       See the CPAN FAQ at &lt;<a href="http://www.cpan.org/misc/cpan-faq.html">http://www.cpan.org/misc/cpan-faq.html</a>&gt; for answers to the most frequently asked
       questions about CPAN.

       The Task::Kensho module has a list of recommended modules which you should review as a good starting
       point.

   <b>Where</b> <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>information</b> <b>on</b> <b>Perl?</b>
       •   &lt;<a href="http://www.perl.org/">http://www.perl.org/</a>&gt;

       •   &lt;<a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/">http://perldoc.perl.org/</a>&gt;

       •   &lt;<a href="http://learn.perl.org/">http://learn.perl.org/</a>&gt;

       The  complete  Perl  documentation  is  available with the Perl distribution.  If you have Perl installed
       locally, you probably have the documentation installed as well: type "perldoc perl" in a terminal or view
       online &lt;<a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/perl.html">http://perldoc.perl.org/perl.html</a>&gt;.

       (Some operating system distributions may ship the documentation in a different package; for instance,  on
       Debian, you need to install the "perl-doc" package.)

       Many good books have been written about Perl--see the section later in perlfaq2 for more details.

   <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>perl.com?</b> <b>Perl</b> <b>Mongers?</b> <b>pm.org?</b> <b>perl.org?</b> <b>cpan.org?</b>
       Perl.com  &lt;<a href="http://www.perl.com/">http://www.perl.com/</a>&gt; used to be part of the O'Reilly Network, a subsidiary of O'Reilly Media.
       Although it retains most of the original content from its O'Reilly Network, it is now hosted by The  Perl
       Foundation &lt;<a href="http://www.perlfoundation.org/">http://www.perlfoundation.org/</a>&gt;.

       The  Perl  Foundation  is  an  advocacy  organization  for the Perl language which maintains the web site
       &lt;<a href="http://www.perl.org/">http://www.perl.org/</a>&gt; as a general advocacy site for the Perl language. It uses the  domain  to  provide
       general  support  services  to the Perl community, including the hosting of mailing lists, web sites, and
       other services. There are also many other sub-domains for special topics like learning Perl and  jobs  in
       Perl, such as:

       •   &lt;<a href="http://www.perl.org/">http://www.perl.org/</a>&gt;

       •   &lt;<a href="http://learn.perl.org/">http://learn.perl.org/</a>&gt;

       •   &lt;<a href="http://jobs.perl.org/">http://jobs.perl.org/</a>&gt;

       •   &lt;<a href="http://lists.perl.org/">http://lists.perl.org/</a>&gt;

       Perl  Mongers &lt;<a href="http://www.pm.org/">http://www.pm.org/</a>&gt; uses the pm.org domain for services related to local Perl user groups,
       including the hosting of mailing lists and web sites. See the Perl Mongers web site  &lt;<a href="http://www.pm.org/">http://www.pm.org/</a>&gt;
       for more information about joining, starting, or requesting services for a Perl user group.

       CPAN,  or  the  Comprehensive  Perl  Archive  Network  &lt;<a href="http://www.cpan.org/">http://www.cpan.org/</a>&gt;, is a replicated, worldwide
       repository of Perl software.  See What is CPAN?.

   <b>Where</b> <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>post</b> <b>questions?</b>
       There  are  many  Perl  mailing   lists   for   various   topics,   specifically   the   beginners   list
       &lt;<a href="http://lists.perl.org/list/beginners.html">http://lists.perl.org/list/beginners.html</a>&gt; may be of use.

       Other  places  to  ask  questions  are on the PerlMonks site &lt;<a href="http://www.perlmonks.org/">http://www.perlmonks.org/</a>&gt; or stackoverflow
       &lt;<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/perl">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/perl</a>&gt;.

   <b>Perl</b> <b>Books</b>
       There are many good books on Perl &lt;<a href="http://www.perl.org/books/library.html">http://www.perl.org/books/library.html</a>&gt;.

   <b>Which</b> <b>magazines</b> <b>have</b> <b>Perl</b> <b>content?</b>
       There are no current magazines that focus on Perl, although you sometimes will find Perl content in  more
       general interest programming titles.

       In  the  distant past, there have been a few Perl magazines. The first was <u>The</u> <u>Perl</u> <u>Journal</u>, published by
       Jon Orwant. After that, there was <u>The</u> <u>Perl</u> <u>Review</u>, published by brian d foy, and  <u>$foo</u> <u>Magazin</u>, published
       by Renée Bäcker (&lt;<a href="http://www.foo-magazin.de">http://www.foo-magazin.de</a>&gt;).

       The closest you might find today is Perl Weekly, (&lt;https://perlweekly.com&gt;), an online newsletter with  a
       magazine-like format.

   <b>Which</b> <b>Perl</b> <b>blogs</b> <b>should</b> <b>I</b> <b>read?</b>
       Perl  News  &lt;<a href="http://perlnews.org/">http://perlnews.org/</a>&gt;  covers  some  of  the  major  events  in  the Perl world, Perl Weekly
       &lt;<a href="http://perlweekly.com/">http://perlweekly.com/</a>&gt; is a weekly e-mail (and RSS feed) of hand-picked Perl articles.

       &lt;<a href="http://blogs.perl.org/">http://blogs.perl.org/</a>&gt; hosts many Perl blogs, there  are  also  several  blog  aggregators:  Perlsphere
       &lt;<a href="http://perlsphere.net/">http://perlsphere.net/</a>&gt; and IronMan &lt;<a href="http://ironman.enlightenedperl.org/">http://ironman.enlightenedperl.org/</a>&gt; are two of them.

   <b>What</b> <b>mailing</b> <b>lists</b> <b>are</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>Perl?</b>
       A comprehensive list of Perl-related mailing lists can be found at &lt;<a href="http://lists.perl.org/">http://lists.perl.org/</a>&gt;

   <b>Where</b> <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> <b>commercial</b> <b>version</b> <b>of</b> <b>Perl?</b>
       Perl  already  <u>is</u>  commercial  software:  it  has  a license that you can grab and carefully read to your
       manager. It is distributed in releases and comes in well-defined packages. There  is  a  very  large  and
       supportive user community and an extensive literature.

       If you still need commercial support ActiveState &lt;<a href="http://www.activestate.com/activeperl">http://www.activestate.com/activeperl</a>&gt; offers this.

   <b>Where</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>send</b> <b>bug</b> <b>reports?</b>
       (contributed by brian d foy)

       First, ensure that you've found an actual bug. Second, ensure you've found an actual bug.

       If you've found a bug with the perl interpreter or one of the modules in the standard library (those that
       come     with     Perl),    submit    a    bug    report    to    the    GitHub    issue    tracker    at
       &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues&gt;.

       To determine if a module came with your version of Perl, you can install  and  use  Module::CoreList.  It
       knows the modules (with their versions) included with each release of Perl:

               $ corelist File::Copy
               Data for 2023-07-02
               File::Copy was first released with perl 5.002

               $ corelist Business::ISBN
               Data for 2023-07-02
               Business::ISBN was not in CORE (or so I think)

       If the module does not come with Perl, report its issues using the tool that the particular module author
       decided  to  use, such as a GitHub or Google Code. The quickest way may be to check the MetaCPAN page for
       the module (for example, &lt;https://metacpan.org/pod/Business::ISBN&gt;), which shows the  denoted  bugtracker
       in the left sidebar as the "Issues" link.

       Also  check  the  module's  documentation,  <u>README</u>,  the  build  files  (<u>Makefile.PL</u>  or  "Build.PL"), or
       <u>META.{json,yml}</u> files. Although many module authors follow the same pattern, some  have  their  own  way.
       Use the directions you find.

       Sometimes  the  module  author  does not declare a bugtracker. For a long time, everyone assumed that the
       CPAN Request Tracker (&lt;https://rt.cpan.org&gt;) was the bugtracker since every distribution had an RT  queue
       generated  automatically. In somes cases, the author might use CPAN RT. They also might have not declared
       a different bugtracker but don't use CPAN RT.

       Submit bugs to RT either through its web interface, &lt;https://rt.cpan.org&gt;, or by  email.  Send  email  to
       <u>bug-&lt;distribution-name&gt;@rt.cpan.org</u>.  For  example,  if  you wanted to report a bug in the example module
       Foo::Bar, you could send a message to <u><a href="mailto:bug-Foo-Bar@rt.cpan.org">bug-Foo-Bar@rt.cpan.org</a></u>.
