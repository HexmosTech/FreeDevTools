       perlfork - Perl's fork() emulation

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           NOTE:  As of the 5.8.0 release, fork() emulation has considerably
           matured.  However, there are still a few known bugs and differences
           from real fork() that might affect you.  See the "BUGS" and
           "CAVEATS AND LIMITATIONS" sections below.

       Perl provides a <b>fork()</b> keyword that corresponds to the Unix system call of the same name.  On most Unix-
       like platforms where the <b>fork()</b> system call is available, Perl's <b>fork()</b> simply calls it.

       On some platforms such as Windows where the <b>fork()</b> system call is not available, Perl can be built to
       emulate <b>fork()</b> at the interpreter level.  While the emulation is designed to be as compatible as possible
       with the real <b>fork()</b> at the level of the Perl program, there are certain important differences that stem
       from the fact that all the pseudo child "processes" created this way live in the same real process as far
       as the operating system is concerned.

       This document provides a general overview of the capabilities and limitations of the <b>fork()</b> emulation.
       Note that the issues discussed here are not applicable to platforms where a real <b>fork()</b> is available and
       Perl has been configured to use it.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>fork()</b> emulation is implemented at the level of the Perl interpreter.  What this means in general is
       that running <b>fork()</b> will actually clone the running interpreter and all its state, and run the cloned
       interpreter in a separate thread, beginning execution in the new thread just after the point where the
       <b>fork()</b> was called in the parent.  We will refer to the thread that implements this child "process" as the
       pseudo-process.

       To the Perl program that called <b>fork()</b>, all this is designed to be transparent.  The parent returns from
       the <b>fork()</b> with a pseudo-process ID that can be subsequently used in any process-manipulation functions;
       the child returns from the <b>fork()</b> with a value of 0 to signify that it is the child pseudo-process.

   <b>Behavior</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>Perl</b> <b>features</b> <b>in</b> <b>forked</b> <b>pseudo-processes</b>
       Most Perl features behave in a natural way within pseudo-processes.

       $$ or $PROCESS_ID
               This  special  variable  is  correctly  set to the pseudo-process ID.  It can be used to identify
               pseudo-processes within a particular session.  Note that this value is subject  to  recycling  if
               any pseudo-processes are launched after others have been <b>wait()</b>-ed on.

       %ENV    Each  pseudo-process  maintains  its  own  virtual environment.  Modifications to %ENV affect the
               virtual environment, and are only visible within that pseudo-process, and in  any  processes  (or
               pseudo-processes) launched from it.

       <b>chdir()</b> and all other builtins that accept filenames
               Each  pseudo-process  maintains  its own virtual idea of the current directory.  Modifications to
               the current directory using <b>chdir()</b> are only visible  within  that  pseudo-process,  and  in  any
               processes  (or  pseudo-processes)  launched  from  it.   All file and directory accesses from the
               pseudo-process will correctly map the virtual working directory to  the  real  working  directory
               appropriately.

       <b>wait()</b> and <b>waitpid()</b>
               <b>wait()</b>  and  <b>waitpid()</b>  can  be  passed a pseudo-process ID returned by <b>fork()</b>.  These calls will
               properly wait for the termination of the pseudo-process and return its status.

       <b>kill()</b>  "kill('KILL', ...)" can be used to terminate a pseudo-process by passing it the  ID  returned  by
               <b>fork()</b>. The outcome of kill on a pseudo-process is unpredictable and it should not be used except
               under dire circumstances, because the operating system may not guarantee integrity of the process
               resources when a running thread is terminated.  The process which implements the pseudo-processes
               can  be  blocked  and  the  Perl  interpreter  hangs.  Note  that  using "kill('KILL', ...)" on a
               pseudo-<b>process()</b> may typically cause memory leaks, because the thread that implements the pseudo-
               process does not get a chance to clean up its resources.

               "kill('TERM', ...)" can also be used on pseudo-processes, but the signal will  not  be  delivered
               while  the  pseudo-process  is blocked by a system call, e.g. waiting for a socket to connect, or
               trying to read from a socket with no data available.  Starting in Perl 5.14  the  parent  process
               will  not  wait  for  children  to exit once they have been signalled with "kill('TERM', ...)" to
               avoid deadlock during process exit.  You will have to explicitly call <b>waitpid()</b> to make sure  the
               child  has  time  to  clean-up  itself,  but  you are then also responsible that the child is not
               blocking on I/O either.

       <b>exec()</b>  Calling <b>exec()</b> within a pseudo-process actually spawns the requested  executable  in  a  separate
               process  and  waits  for it to complete before exiting with the same exit status as that process.
               This means that the process ID reported within the running executable will be different from what
               the earlier Perl <b>fork()</b> might have  returned.   Similarly,  any  process  manipulation  functions
               applied  to  the ID returned by <b>fork()</b> will affect the waiting pseudo-process that called <b>exec()</b>,
               not the real process it is waiting for after the <b>exec()</b>.

               When <b>exec()</b> is called inside a pseudo-process then DESTROY methods and END blocks will  still  be
               called after the external process returns.

       <b>exit()</b>  <b>exit()</b>  always  exits  just  the executing pseudo-process, after automatically <b>wait()</b>-ing for any
               outstanding child pseudo-processes.  Note that this means that the process as a  whole  will  not
               exit  unless  all running pseudo-processes have exited.  See below for some limitations with open
               filehandles.

       Open handles to files, directories and network sockets
               All open handles are <b>dup()</b>-ed in pseudo-processes, so that closing any  handles  in  one  process
               does not affect the others.  See below for some limitations.

   <b>Resource</b> <b>limits</b>
       In the eyes of the operating system, pseudo-processes created via the <b>fork()</b> emulation are simply threads
       in  the  same process.  This means that any process-level limits imposed by the operating system apply to
       all pseudo-processes taken together.  This includes any limits imposed by the  operating  system  on  the
       number  of  open  file,  directory and socket handles, limits on disk space usage, limits on memory size,
       limits on CPU utilization etc.

   <b>Killing</b> <b>the</b> <b>parent</b> <b>process</b>
       If the parent process is killed (either using Perl's <b>kill()</b> builtin, or using some  external  means)  all
       the pseudo-processes are killed as well, and the whole process exits.

   <b>Lifetime</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>parent</b> <b>process</b> <b>and</b> <b>pseudo-processes</b>
       During  the  normal course of events, the parent process and every pseudo-process started by it will wait
       for their respective pseudo-children to complete before they exit.  This means that the parent and  every
       pseudo-child  created  by it that is also a pseudo-parent will only exit after their pseudo-children have
       exited.

       Starting with Perl 5.14 a parent will not <b>wait()</b> automatically for any child that has been signalled with
       "kill('TERM', ...)"  to avoid a deadlock in case the child is blocking on  I/O  and  never  receives  the
       signal.

</pre><h4><b>CAVEATS</b> <b>AND</b> <b>LIMITATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       BEGIN blocks
               The <b>fork()</b> emulation will not work entirely correctly when called from within a BEGIN block.  The
               forked  copy  will  run the contents of the BEGIN block, but will not continue parsing the source
               stream after the BEGIN block.  For example, consider the following code:

                   BEGIN {
                       fork and exit;          # fork child and exit the parent
                       print "inner\n";
                   }
                   print "outer\n";

               This will print:

                   inner

               rather than the expected:

                   inner
                   outer

               This limitation arises from fundamental technical difficulties  in  cloning  and  restarting  the
               stacks used by the Perl parser in the middle of a parse.

       Open filehandles
               Any  filehandles  open at the time of the <b>fork()</b> will be <b>dup()</b>-ed.  Thus, the files can be closed
               independently in the parent and child, but beware that the <b>dup()</b>-ed handles will still share  the
               same  seek  pointer.   Changing  the  seek position in the parent will change it in the child and
               vice-versa.  One can avoid this by opening files that need distinct seek pointers  separately  in
               the child.

               On some operating systems, notably Solaris and Unixware, calling exit() from a child process will
               flush  and  close  open  filehandles in the parent, thereby corrupting the filehandles.  On these
               systems, calling _exit() is suggested instead.  _exit() is available in Perl through the  "POSIX"
               module.  Please consult your system's manpages for more information on this.

       Open directory handles
               Perl will completely read from all open directory handles until they reach the end of the stream.
               It  will  then  <b>seekdir()</b> back to the original location and all future <b>readdir()</b> requests will be
               fulfilled from the cache buffer.  That means that neither the directory handle held by the parent
               process nor the one held by the child process will see any changes made to  the  directory  after
               the <b>fork()</b> call.

               Note  that  <b>rewinddir()</b>  has a similar limitation on Windows and will not force <b>readdir()</b> to read
               the directory again either.  Only a newly opened directory handle will  reflect  changes  to  the
               directory.

       Forking pipe <b>open()</b> not yet implemented
               The  "open(FOO, "|-")" and "open(BAR, "-|")" constructs are not yet implemented.  This limitation
               can be easily worked around in new code by creating a pipe  explicitly.   The  following  example
               shows how to write to a forked child:

                   # simulate open(FOO, "|-")
                   sub pipe_to_fork ($) {
                       my $parent = shift;
                       pipe my $child, $parent or die;
                       my $pid = fork();
                       die "fork() failed: $!" unless defined $pid;
                       if ($pid) {
                           close $child;
                       }
                       else {
                           close $parent;
                           open(STDIN, "&lt;&amp;=" . fileno($child)) or die;
                       }
                       $pid;
                   }

                   if (pipe_to_fork('FOO')) {
                       # parent
                       print FOO "pipe_to_fork\n";
                       close FOO;
                   }
                   else {
                       # child
                       while (&lt;STDIN&gt;) { print; }
                       <a href="../man0/exit.0.html">exit</a>(0);
                   }

               And this one reads from the child:

                   # simulate open(FOO, "-|")
                   sub pipe_from_fork ($) {
                       my $parent = shift;
                       pipe $parent, my $child or die;
                       my $pid = fork();
                       die "fork() failed: $!" unless defined $pid;
                       if ($pid) {
                           close $child;
                       }
                       else {
                           close $parent;
                           open(STDOUT, "&gt;&amp;=" . fileno($child)) or die;
                       }
                       $pid;
                   }

                   if (pipe_from_fork('BAR')) {
                       # parent
                       while (&lt;BAR&gt;) { print; }
                       close BAR;
                   }
                   else {
                       # child
                       print "pipe_from_fork\n";
                       <a href="../man0/exit.0.html">exit</a>(0);
                   }

               Forking pipe <b>open()</b> constructs will be supported in future.

       Global state maintained by XSUBs
               External  subroutines  (XSUBs) that maintain their own global state may not work correctly.  Such
               XSUBs will either need to maintain locks to protect  simultaneous  access  to  global  data  from
               different pseudo-processes, or maintain all their state on the Perl symbol table, which is copied
               naturally when <b>fork()</b> is called.  A callback mechanism that provides extensions an opportunity to
               clone their state will be provided in the near future.

       Interpreter embedded in larger application
               The  <b>fork()</b>  emulation  may  not  behave  as expected when it is executed in an application which
               embeds a Perl interpreter and calls Perl APIs that can evaluate bits of Perl  code.   This  stems
               from  the  fact  that  the  emulation  only  has  knowledge about the Perl interpreter's own data
               structures and knows nothing about the containing application's state.  For  example,  any  state
               carried on the application's own call stack is out of reach.

       Thread-safety of extensions
               Since the <b>fork()</b> emulation runs code in multiple threads, extensions calling into non-thread-safe
               libraries  may  not  work  reliably  when  calling <b>fork()</b>.  As Perl's threading support gradually
               becomes more widely adopted even on platforms with a native <b>fork()</b>, such extensions are  expected
               to be fixed for thread-safety.

</pre><h4><b>PORTABILITY</b> <b>CAVEATS</b></h4><pre>
       In  portable Perl code, "kill(9, $child)" must not be used on forked processes.  Killing a forked process
       is unsafe and has unpredictable results.  See "<b>kill()</b>", above.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       •       Having pseudo-process IDs be negative integers breaks down for the integer -1 because the  <b>wait()</b>
               and  <b>waitpid()</b> functions treat this number as being special.  The tacit assumption in the current
               implementation is that the system never allocates a thread ID of 1 for user  threads.   A  better
               representation for pseudo-process IDs will be implemented in future.

       •       In  certain  cases,  the OS-level handles created by the <b>pipe()</b>, <b>socket()</b>, and <b>accept()</b> operators
               are apparently not  duplicated  accurately  in  pseudo-processes.   This  only  happens  in  some
               situations,  but where it does happen, it may result in deadlocks between the read and write ends
               of pipe handles, or inability to send or receive data across socket handles.
