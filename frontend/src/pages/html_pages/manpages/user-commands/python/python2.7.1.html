</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Python  is  an  interpreted,  interactive,  object-oriented programming language that combines remarkable
       power with very clear syntax.  For an introduction to programming in Python,  see  the  Python  Tutorial.
       The  Python  Library  Reference  documents built-in and standard types, constants, functions and modules.
       Finally, the Python Reference Manual describes the syntax and semantics of the core language in  (perhaps
       too)  much  detail.   (These  documents  may  be  located  via  the <b>INTERNET</b> <b>RESOURCES</b> below; they may be
       installed on your system as well.)

       Python's basic power can be extended with your own modules written in C or C++.   On  most  systems  such
       modules  may  be  dynamically  loaded.   Python  is  also adaptable as an extension language for existing
       applications.  See the internal documentation for hints.

       Documentation for installed Python modules and packages can be viewed by running the <b>pydoc</b> program.

</pre><h4><b>COMMAND</b> <b>LINE</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-B</b>     Don't write <u>.py[co]</u> files on import. See also PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE.

       <b>-c</b> <u>command</u>
              Specify the command to execute (see next section).  This terminates  the  option  list  (following
              options are passed as arguments to the command).

       <b>-d</b>     Turn on parser debugging output (for wizards only, depending on compilation options).

       <b>-E</b>     Ignore  environment  variables  like  PYTHONPATH  and  PYTHONHOME  that modify the behavior of the
              interpreter.

       <b>-h</b> <b>,</b>  <b>-?</b> <b>,</b>  <b>--help</b>
              Prints the usage for the interpreter executable and exits.

       <b>-i</b>     When a script is passed as first argument or the <b>-c</b> option is used, enter interactive  mode  after
              executing  the  script  or  the  command.   It does not read the $PYTHONSTARTUP file.  This can be
              useful to inspect global variables or a stack trace when a script raises an exception.

       <b>-m</b> <u>module-name</u>
              Searches <u>sys.path</u> for the named module and runs the corresponding <u>.py</u> file as a script.

       <b>-O</b>     Turn on basic optimizations.  This changes the filename extension for  compiled  (bytecode)  files
              from <u>.pyc</u> to <u>.pyo</u>.  Given twice, causes docstrings to be discarded.

       <b>-OO</b>    Discard docstrings in addition to the <b>-O</b> optimizations.

       <b>-R</b>     Turn  on  "hash  randomization",  so that the hash() values of str, bytes and datetime objects are
              "salted" with an unpredictable pseudo-random value.   Although  they  remain  constant  within  an
              individual Python process, they are not predictable between repeated invocations of Python.

              This  is  intended  to  provide  protection against a denial of service caused by carefully-chosen
              inputs that exploit the worst case performance of a dict  construction,  O(n^2)  complexity.   See
              <a href="http://www.ocert.org/advisories/ocert-2011-003.html">http://www.ocert.org/advisories/ocert-2011-003.html</a> for details.

       <b>-Q</b> <u>argument</u>
              Division  control;  see  PEP  238.   The  argument  must be one of "old" (the default, int/int and
              long/long return an int or long), "new"  (new  division  semantics,  i.e.  int/int  and  long/long
              returns  a  float),  "warn"  (old division semantics with a warning for int/int and long/long), or
              "warnall" (old division semantics with a warning for all use of the division operator).  For a use
              of "warnall", see the Tools/scripts/fixdiv.py script.

       <b>-s</b>     Don't add user site directory to sys.path.

       <b>-S</b>     Disable the import of the module <u>site</u> and the site-dependent manipulations  of  <u>sys.path</u>  that  it
              entails.

       <b>-t</b>     Issue  a  warning  when a source file mixes tabs and spaces for indentation in a way that makes it
              depend on the worth of a tab expressed in spaces.  Issue an error when the option is given twice.

       <b>-u</b>     Force stdin, stdout and stderr to be totally unbuffered.  On systems where it  matters,  also  put
              stdin,  stdout  and stderr in binary mode.  Note that there is internal buffering in xreadlines(),
              readlines() and file-object iterators ("for line in sys.stdin") which is not  influenced  by  this
              option.   To  work  around  this,  you will want to use "sys.stdin.readline()" inside a "while 1:"
              loop.

       <b>-v</b>     Print a message each time a module is initialized, showing the place (filename or built-in module)
              from which it is loaded.  When given twice, print a message for each file that is checked for when
              searching for a module.  Also provides information on module cleanup at exit.

       <b>-V</b> <b>,</b>  <b>--version</b>
              Prints the Python version number of the executable and exits.

       <b>-W</b> <u>argument</u>
              Warning control.  Python sometimes prints  warning  message  to  <u>sys.stderr</u>.   A  typical  warning
              message has the following form: <u>file</u><b>:</b><u>line</u><b>:</b> <u>category</u><b>:</b> <u>message.</u>  By default, each warning is printed
              once  for  each source line where it occurs.  This option controls how often warnings are printed.
              Multiple <b>-W</b> options may be given; when a warning matches more than one option, the action for  the
              last  matching  option is performed.  Invalid <b>-W</b> options are ignored (a warning message is printed
              about invalid options when the first warning is issued).  Warnings can  also  be  controlled  from
              within a Python program using the <u>warnings</u> module.

              The  simplest  form of <u>argument</u> is one of the following <u>action</u> strings (or a unique abbreviation):
              <b>ignore</b> to ignore all warnings; <b>default</b> to explicitly request the default behavior  (printing  each
              warning  once per source line); <b>all</b> to print a warning each time it occurs (this may generate many
              messages if a warning is triggered repeatedly for the same source line, such as  inside  a  loop);
              <b>module</b>  to  print  each  warning  only the first time it occurs in each module; <b>once</b> to print each
              warning only the first time it occurs in the program; or <b>error</b> to raise an  exception  instead  of
              printing a warning message.

              The  full  form  of <u>argument</u> is <u>action</u><b>:</b><u>message</u><b>:</b><u>category</u><b>:</b><u>module</u><b>:</b><u>line.</u>  Here, <u>action</u> is as explained
              above but only applies to messages that match  the  remaining  fields.   Empty  fields  match  all
              values;  trailing empty fields may be omitted.  The <u>message</u> field matches the start of the warning
              message printed; this match is case-insensitive.  The <u>category</u> field matches the warning category.
              This must be a class name; the match test whether the actual warning category of the message is  a
              subclass  of the specified warning category.  The full class name must be given.  The <u>module</u> field
              matches the (fully-qualified) module name; this match is case-sensitive.  The <u>line</u>  field  matches
              the  line  number,  where  zero matches all line numbers and is thus equivalent to an omitted line
              number.

       <b>-x</b>     Skip the first line of the source.  This is intended for a DOS specific hack only.   Warning:  the
              line numbers in error messages will be off by one!

       <b>-3</b>     Warn about Python 3.x incompatibilities that 2to3 cannot trivially fix.

</pre><h4><b>INTERPRETER</b> <b>INTERFACE</b></h4><pre>
       The  interpreter interface resembles that of the UNIX shell: when called with standard input connected to
       a tty device, it prompts for commands and executes them until an EOF is read; when  called  with  a  file
       name  argument  or  with  a  file  as standard input, it reads and executes a <u>script</u> from that file; when
       called with <b>-c</b> <u>command</u>, it executes the Python statement(s) given as <u>command</u>.  Here <u>command</u>  may  contain
       multiple  statements  separated by newlines.  Leading whitespace is significant in Python statements!  In
       non-interactive mode, the entire input is parsed before it is executed.

       If available, the script name and additional arguments thereafter are passed to the script in the  Python
       variable <u>sys.argv</u>, which is a list of strings (you must first <u>import</u> <u>sys</u> to be able to access it).  If no
       script  name  is  given,  <u>sys.argv[0]</u>  is an empty string; if <b>-c</b> is used, <u>sys.argv[0]</u> contains the string
       <u>'-c'.</u>  Note that options interpreted by the Python interpreter itself are not placed in <u>sys.argv</u>.

       In interactive mode, the primary prompt is `&gt;&gt;&gt;'; the second prompt (which appears when a command is  not
       complete)  is  `...'.   The  prompts can be changed by assignment to <u>sys.ps1</u> or <u>sys.ps2</u>.  The interpreter
       quits when it reads an EOF at a prompt.  When an unhandled exception occurs, a stack trace is printed and
       control returns to the primary prompt; in non-interactive mode, the interpreter exits after printing  the
       stack  trace.   The  interrupt  signal raises the <u>KeyboardInterrupt</u> exception; other UNIX signals are not
       caught (except that SIGPIPE is sometimes ignored, in favor of the <u>IOError</u> exception).  Error messages are
       written to stderr.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b> <b>AND</b> <b>DIRECTORIES</b></h4><pre>
       These are subject to difference depending on local installation conventions; ${prefix} and ${exec_prefix}
       are installation-dependent and should be interpreted as for GNU software;  they  may  be  the  same.   On
       Debian GNU/{Hurd,Linux} the default for both is <u><a href="file:/usr">/usr</a></u>.

       <u>${exec_prefix}/bin/python</u>
              Recommended location of the interpreter.

       <u>${prefix}/lib/python&lt;version&gt;</u>
       <u>${exec_prefix}/lib/python&lt;version&gt;</u>
              Recommended locations of the directories containing the standard modules.

       <u>${prefix}/include/python&lt;version&gt;</u>
       <u>${exec_prefix}/include/python&lt;version&gt;</u>
              Recommended locations of the directories containing the include files needed for developing Python
              extensions and embedding the interpreter.

       <u><a href="file:~/.pythonrc.py">~/.pythonrc.py</a></u>
              User-specific  initialization  file  loaded  by  the  <u>user</u>  module; not used by default or by most
              applications.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       PYTHONHOME
              Change the location of the standard Python libraries.  By default, the libraries are  searched  in
              ${prefix}/lib/python&lt;version&gt;   and   ${exec_prefix}/lib/python&lt;version&gt;,   where   ${prefix}  and
              ${exec_prefix} are  installation-dependent  directories,  both  defaulting  to  <u><a href="file:/usr/local">/usr/local</a></u>.   When
              $PYTHONHOME  is  set  to a single directory, its value replaces both ${prefix} and ${exec_prefix}.
              To specify different values for these, set $PYTHONHOME to ${prefix}:${exec_prefix}.

       PYTHONPATH
              Augments the default search path for module files.  The format is the same as the  shell's  $PATH:
              one  or  more  directory  pathnames  separated  by  colons.  Non-existent directories are silently
              ignored.   The  default  search  path  is  installation  dependent,  but  generally  begins   with
              ${prefix}/lib/python&lt;version&gt;  (see PYTHONHOME above).  The default search path is always appended
              to $PYTHONPATH.  If a script argument is given, the directory containing the script is inserted in
              the path in front of $PYTHONPATH.  The search path can be manipulated from within a Python program
              as the variable <u>sys.path</u>.

       PYTHONSTARTUP
              If this is the name of a readable file, the Python commands in that file are executed  before  the
              first  prompt is displayed in interactive mode.  The file is executed in the same name space where
              interactive commands are executed so that objects defined or imported in it can  be  used  without
              qualification  in the interactive session.  You can also change the prompts <u>sys.ps1</u> and <u>sys.ps2</u> in
              this file.

       PYTHONY2K
              Set this to a non-empty string to cause the <u>time</u> module to require dates specified as  strings  to
              include  4-digit years, otherwise 2-digit years are converted based on rules described in the <u>time</u>
              module documentation.

       PYTHONOPTIMIZE
              If this is set to a non-empty string it is equivalent to specifying the <b>-O</b> option. If  set  to  an
              integer, it is equivalent to specifying <b>-O</b> multiple times.

       PYTHONDEBUG
              If  this  is  set to a non-empty string it is equivalent to specifying the <b>-d</b> option. If set to an
              integer, it is equivalent to specifying <b>-d</b> multiple times.

       PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE
              If this is set to a non-empty string it is equivalent to specifying the <b>-B</b> option  (don't  try  to
              write <u>.py[co]</u> files).

       PYTHONINSPECT
              If this is set to a non-empty string it is equivalent to specifying the <b>-i</b> option.

       PYTHONIOENCODING
              If   this   is   set   before  running  the  interpreter,  it  overrides  the  encoding  used  for
              stdin/stdout/stderr, in the syntax <u>encodingname</u><b>:</b><u>errorhandler</u> The <u>errorhandler</u> part is optional and
              has the same meaning as in str.encode. For stderr, the <u>errorhandler</u>
               part is ignored; the handler will always be ´backslashreplace´.

       PYTHONNOUSERSITE
              If this is set to a non-empty string it is equivalent to specifying the <b>-s</b> option (Don't  add  the
              user site directory to sys.path).

       PYTHONUNBUFFERED
              If this is set to a non-empty string it is equivalent to specifying the <b>-u</b> option.

       PYTHONVERBOSE
              If  this  is  set to a non-empty string it is equivalent to specifying the <b>-v</b> option. If set to an
              integer, it is equivalent to specifying <b>-v</b> multiple times.

       PYTHONWARNINGS
              If this is set to a comma-separated string it is equivalent to specifying the <b>-W</b> option  for  each
              separate value.

       PYTHONHASHSEED
              If  this variable is set to "random", the effect is the same as specifying the <b>-R</b> option: a random
              value is used to seed the hashes of str, bytes and datetime objects.

              If PYTHONHASHSEED is set to an integer value, it is used as a fixed seed for generating the hash()
              of the types covered by the hash randomization.  Its purpose is to allow repeatable hashing,  such
              as  for  selftests  for the interpreter itself, or to allow a cluster of python processes to share
              hash values.

              The integer must be a decimal number in the range [0,4294967295].  Specifying  the  value  0  will
              lead to the same hash values as when hash randomization is disabled.
