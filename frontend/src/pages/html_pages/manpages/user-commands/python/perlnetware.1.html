       perlnetware - Perl for NetWare

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This file gives instructions for building Perl 5.7 and above, and also Perl modules for NetWare. Before
       you start, you may want to read the README file found in the top level directory into which the Perl
       source code distribution was extracted. Make sure you read and understand the terms under which the
       software is being distributed.

</pre><h4><b>BUILD</b></h4><pre>
       This section describes the steps to be performed to build a Perl NLM and other associated NLMs.

   <b>Tools</b> <b>&amp;</b> <b>SDK</b>
       The build requires CodeWarrior compiler and linker.  In addition, the "NetWare SDK", "NLM &amp; NetWare
       Libraries for C" and "NetWare Server Protocol Libraries for C", all available at
       &lt;<a href="http://developer.novell.com/wiki/index.php/Category">http://developer.novell.com/wiki/index.php/Category</a>:Novell_Developer_Kit&gt;, are required. Microsoft
       Visual C++ version 4.2 or later is also required.

   <b>Setup</b>
       The build process is dependent on the location of the NetWare SDK.  Once the Tools &amp; SDK are installed,
       the build environment has to be setup.  The following batch files setup the environment.

       SetNWBld.bat
           The  Execution of this file takes 2 parameters as input. The first being the NetWare SDK path, second
           being the path for CodeWarrior Compiler &amp; tools. Execution of this file sets  these  paths  and  also
           sets the build type to Release by default.

       Buildtype.bat
           This  is  used  to set the build type to debug or release. Change the build type only after executing
           SetNWBld.bat

           Example:

           1.  Typing "buildtype d on" at the command prompt causes the buildtype to be set to Debug  type  with
               D2 flag set.

           2.  Typing "buildtype d off" or "buildtype d" at the command prompt causes the buildtype to be set to
               Debug type with D1 flag set.

           3.  Typing "buildtype r" at the command prompt sets it to Release Build type.

   <b>Make</b>
       The  make process runs only under WinNT shell.  The NetWare makefile is located under the NetWare folder.
       This makes use of miniperl.exe to run some of the Perl scripts. To create  miniperl.exe,  first  set  the
       required paths for Visual c++ compiler (specify vcvars32 location) at the command prompt.  Then run nmake
       from  win32  folder through WinNT command prompt.  The build process can be stopped after miniperl.exe is
       created. Then run nmake from NetWare folder through WinNT command prompt.

       Currently the following two build types are tested on NetWare:

       •   USE_MULTI, USE_ITHREADS &amp; USE_IMP_SYS defined

       •   USE_MULTI &amp; USE_IMP_SYS defined and USE_ITHREADS not defined

   <b>Interpreter</b>
       Once miniperl.exe creation is over, run nmake  from  the  NetWare  folder.   This  will  build  the  Perl
       interpreter  for NetWare as <u>perl.nlm</u>.  This is copied under the <u>Release</u> folder if you are doing a release
       build, else will be copied under <u>Debug</u> folder for debug builds.

   <b>Extensions</b>
       The make process also creates the Perl extensions as <u>&lt;Extension</u>.nlm&gt;

</pre><h4><b>INSTALL</b></h4><pre>
       To install NetWare Perl onto a NetWare server, first map the Sys volume of a NetWare server to  <u>i:</u>.  This
       is because the makefile by default sets the drive letter to <u>i:</u>.  Type <u>nmake</u> <u>nwinstall</u> from NetWare folder
       on  a  WinNT  command prompt.  This will copy the binaries and module files onto the NetWare server under
       <u>sys:\Perl</u> folder. The Perl interpreter, <u>perl.nlm</u>, is copied under <u>sys:\perl\system</u> folder.  Copy this  to
       <u>sys:\system</u> folder.

       Example: At the command prompt Type "nmake nwinstall".
                 This will install NetWare Perl on the NetWare Server.
                 Similarly, if you type "nmake install",
                 this will cause the binaries to be installed on the local machine.
                 (Typically under the c:\perl folder)

</pre><h4><b>BUILD</b> <b>NEW</b> <b>EXTENSIONS</b></h4><pre>
       To  build  extensions  other  than standard extensions, NetWare Perl has to be installed on Windows along
       with Windows Perl. The Perl for Windows can be either downloaded from the CPAN site and built  using  the
       sources,  or the binaries can be directly downloaded from the ActiveState site.  Installation can be done
       by invoking <u>nmake</u> <u>install</u> from the NetWare folder on a WinNT command prompt after building  NetWare  Perl
       by  following  steps  given  above.   This  will  copy  all  the  *.pm  files  and  other required files.
       Documentation files are not copied.  Thus one must first install Windows Perl, Then install NetWare Perl.

       Once this is done, do the following to build any extension:

       •   Change to the extension directory where its source files are present.

       •   Run the following command at the command prompt:

               perl -II&lt;path to NetWare lib dir&gt; -II&lt;path to lib&gt; Makefile.pl

           Example:

               perl -Ic:/perl/5.6.1/lib/NetWare-x86-multi-thread           \
                                           -Ic:\perl\5.6.1\lib MakeFile.pl

           or

               perl -Ic:/perl/5.8.0/lib/NetWare-x86-multi-thread           \
                                           -Ic:\perl\5.8.0\lib MakeFile.pl

       •   nmake

       •   nmake install

           Install will copy the files into the Windows machine where NetWare Perl is installed and these  files
           may  have to be copied to the NetWare server manually. Alternatively, pass <u>INSTALLSITELIB=i:\perl\lib</u>
           as an input to makefile.pl above. Here <u>i:</u> is the mapped drive to the sys: volume of the server  where
           Perl on NetWare is installed. Now typing <u>nmake</u> <u>install</u>, will copy the files onto the NetWare server.

           Example: You can execute the following on the command prompt.

             perl -Ic:/perl/5.6.1/lib/NetWare-x86-multi-thread             \
                                           -Ic:\perl\5.6.1\lib MakeFile.pl
             INSTALLSITELIB=i:\perl\lib

           or

             perl -Ic:/perl/5.8.0/lib/NetWare-x86-multi-thread             \
                                           -Ic:\perl\5.8.0\lib MakeFile.pl
             INSTALLSITELIB=i:\perl\lib

       •   Note: Some modules downloaded from CPAN may require NetWare related API in order to build on NetWare.
           Other  modules  may  however  build  smoothly  with or without minor changes depending on the type of
           module.

</pre><h4><b>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       The makefile for Win32 is used as a reference to create the makefile for NetWare.  Also, the make process
       for NetWare port uses miniperl.exe to run scripts during the make and installation process.
