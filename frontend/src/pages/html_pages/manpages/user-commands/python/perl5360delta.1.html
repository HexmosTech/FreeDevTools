</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       perl5360delta - what is new for perl v5.36.0

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This document describes differences between the 5.34.0 release and the 5.36.0 release.

</pre><h4><b>Core</b> <b>Enhancements</b></h4><pre>
   <b>"use</b> <b>v5.36"</b>
       As always, "use v5.36" turns on the feature bundle for that version of Perl.

       The 5.36 bundle enables the "signatures" feature.  Introduced in Perl version 5.20.0, and modified
       several times since, the subroutine signatures feature is now no longer considered experimental. It is
       now considered a stable language feature and no longer prints a warning.

           use v5.36;

           sub add ($x, $y) {
             return $x + $y;
           }

       Despite this, certain elements of signatured subroutines remain experimental; see below.

       The 5.36 bundle enables the "isa" feature.  Introduced in Perl version 5.32.0, this operator has remained
       unchanged since then. The operator is now considered a stable language feature.  For more detail see
       "Class Instance Operator" in perlop.

       The 5.36 bundle also <u>disables</u> the features "indirect", and "multidimensional".  These will forbid,
       respectively: the use of "indirect" method calls (like "$x = new Class;"); the use of a list expression
       as a hash key to simulate sparse multidimensional arrays.  The specifics of these changes can be found in
       feature, but the short version is: this is a bit like having more "use strict" turned on, disabling
       features that cause more trouble than they're worth.

       Furthermore, "use v5.36" will also enable warnings as if you'd written "use warnings".

       Finally, with this release, the experimental "switch" feature, present in every feature bundle since they
       were introduced in v5.10, has been removed from the v5.36 bundle.  If you want to use it (against our
       advice), you'll have to enable it explicitly.

   <b>-g</b> <b>command-line</b> <b>flag</b>
       A new command-line flag, -g, is available. It is a simpler alias for -0777.

       For more information, see "-g" in perlrun.

   <b>Unicode</b> <b>14.0</b> <b>is</b> <b>supported</b>
       See &lt;https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode14.0.0/&gt; for details.

   <b>regex</b> <b>sets</b> <b>are</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>considered</b> <b>experimental</b>
       Prior to this release, the regex sets feature (officially named "Extended Bracketed Character Classes")
       was considered experimental.  Introduced in Perl version 5.18.0, and modified several times since, this
       is now considered a stable language feature and its use no longer prints a warning.  See "Extended
       Bracketed Character Classes" in perlrecharclass.

   <b>Variable</b> <b>length</b> <b>lookbehind</b> <b>is</b> <b>mostly</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>considered</b> <b>experimental</b>
       Prior to this release, any form of variable length lookbehind was considered experimental. With this
       release the experimental status has been reduced to cover only lookbehind that contains capturing
       parenthesis.  This is because it is not clear if

           "aaz"=~/(?=z)(?&lt;=(a|aa))/

       should match and leave $1 equaling "a" or "aa". Currently it will match the longest possible alternative,
       "aa". While we are confident that the overall construct will now match only when it should, we are not
       confident that we will keep the current "longest match" behavior.

   <b>SIGFPE</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>deferred</b>
       Floating-point exceptions are now delivered immediately, in the same way as other "fault"-like signals
       such as SIGSEGV. This means one has at least a chance to catch such a signal with a $SIG{FPE} handler,
       e.g.  so that "die" can report the line in perl that triggered it.

   <b>Stable</b> <b>boolean</b> <b>tracking</b>
       The "true" and "false" boolean values, often accessed by constructions like "!!0" and "!!1", as well as
       being returned from many core functions and operators, now remember their boolean nature even through
       assignment into variables. The new function is_bool() in builtin can check whether a value has boolean
       nature.

       This is likely to be useful when interoperating with other languages or data-type serialisation, among
       other places.

   <b>iterating</b> <b>over</b> <b>multiple</b> <b>values</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>(experimental)</b>
       You can now iterate over multiple values at a time by specifying a list of lexicals within parentheses.
       For example,

           for my ($key, $value) (%hash) { ... }
           for my ($left, $right, $gripping) (@moties) { ... }

       Prior to perl v5.36, attempting to specify a list after "for my" was a syntax error.

       This feature is currently experimental and will cause a warning of category "experimental::for_list".
       For more detail see "Compound Statements" in perlsyn.  See also "builtin::indexed" in this document,
       which is a handy companion to n-at-a-time foreach.

   <b>builtin</b> <b>functions</b> <b>(experimental)</b>
       A new core module builtin has been added, which provides documentation for new always-present functions
       that are built into the interpreter.

           say "Reference type of arrays is ", builtin::reftype([]);

       It also provides a lexical import mechanism for providing short name versions of these functions.

           use builtin 'reftype';
           say "Reference type of arrays is ", reftype([]);

       This builtin function mechanism and the functions it provides are all currently <b>experimental</b>.  We expect
       that "builtin" itself will cease to be experimental in the near future, but that individual functions in
       it may become stable on an ongoing basis.  Other functions will be added to "builtin" over time.

       For details, see builtin, but here's a summary of builtin functions in v5.36:

       builtin::trim
           This  function  treats  its argument as a string, returning the result of removing all white space at
           its beginning and ending.

       builtin::indexed
           This function returns a list twice as big as its argument list, where each item is  preceded  by  its
           index  within  that  list.  This is primarily useful for using the new "foreach" syntax with multiple
           iterator variables to iterate over an array or list, while also tracking the index of each item:

               use builtin 'indexed';

               foreach my ($index, $val) (indexed @array) {
                   ...
               }

       builtin::true, builtin::false, builtin::is_bool
           "true" and "false" return boolean true and false values.  Perl is still perl, and doesn't have strict
           typing of booleans, but these values will be known to have been created as booleans.  "is_bool"  will
           tell you whether a value was known to have been created as a boolean.

       builtin::weaken, builtin::unweaken, builtin::is_weak
           These  functions will, respectively: weaken a reference; strengthen a reference; and return whether a
           reference is weak.  (A weak reference is not counted for garbage collection purposes.  See  perlref.)
           These can take the place of some similar routines in Scalar::Util.

       builtin::blessed, builtin::refaddr, builtin::reftype
           These  functions  provide  more data about references (or non-references, actually!) and can take the
           place of similar routines found in Scalar::Util.

       builtin::ceil, builtin::floor
           "ceil" returns the smallest integer greater than or equal  to  its  argument.   "floor"  returns  the
           largest  integer  less  than  or equal to its argument.  These can take the place of similar routines
           found in POSIX.

   <b>"defer"</b> <b>blocks</b> <b>(experimental)</b>
       This release adds support for "defer" blocks, which are blocks of code prefixed by the "defer"  modifier.
       They provide a section of code which runs at a later time, during scope exit.

       In  brief, when a "defer" block is reached at runtime, its body is set aside to be run when the enclosing
       scope is exited.  It is unlike a UNITCHECK (among other reasons) in that  if  the  block  <u>containing</u>  the
       "defer" block is exited before the block is reached, it will not be run.

       "defer"  blocks  can  be used to take the place of "scope guard" objects where an object is passed a code
       block to be run by its destructor.

       For more information, see "defer blocks" in perlsyn.

   <b>try/catch</b> <b>can</b> <b>now</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>"finally"</b> <b>block</b> <b>(experimental)</b>
       The experimental "try"/"catch" syntax has been extended to support an optional third block introduced  by
       the "finally" keyword.

           try {
               attempt();
               print "Success\n";
           }
           catch ($e) {
               print "Failure\n";
           }
           finally {
               print "This happens regardless\n";
           }

       This  provides code which runs at the end of the "try"/"catch" construct, even if aborted by an exception
       or control-flow keyword. They are similar to "defer" blocks.

       For more information, see "Try Catch Exception Handling" in perlsyn.

   <b>non-ASCII</b> <b>delimiters</b> <b>for</b> <b>quote-like</b> <b>operators</b> <b>(experimental)</b>
       Perl traditionally has allowed just four pairs of string/pattern delimiters: "( )" "{ }" "[ ]" and "&lt; &gt;",
       all in the ASCII range.  Unicode has hundreds more possibilities, and using this feature enables many  of
       them.    When   enabled,   you   can  say  "qr« »"  for  example,  or  "use utf8; q𝄃string𝄂".   See  "The
       'extra_paired_delimiters' feature" in feature for details.

   <b>@_</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>experimental</b> <b>within</b> <b>signatured</b> <b>subs</b>
       Even though subroutine signatures are now  stable,  use  of  the  legacy  arguments  array  (@_)  with  a
       subroutine  that  has  a  signature  <u>remains</u>  experimental, with its own warning category.  Silencing the
       "experimental::signatures" warning category is not sufficient  to  dismiss  this.   The  new  warning  is
       emitted with the category name "experimental::args_array_with_signatures".

       Any  subroutine  that  has a signature and tries to make use of the defaults argument array or an element
       thereof (@_ or $_[INDEX]), either explicitly or implicitly (such as "shift" or "pop"  with  no  argument)
       will provoke a warning at compile-time:

           use v5.36;

           sub f ($x, $y = 123) {
             say "The first argument is $_[0]";
           }

           Use of @_ in array element with signatured subroutine is experimental
           at file.pl line 4.

       The behaviour of code which attempts to do this is no longer specified, and may be subject to change in a
       future version.

</pre><h4><b>Incompatible</b> <b>Changes</b></h4><pre>
   <b>A</b> <b>physically</b> <b>empty</b> <b>sort</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>a</b> <b>compile-time</b> <b>error</b>
           @a = sort @empty; # unaffected
           @a = sort;        # now a compile-time error
           @a = sort ();     # also a compile-time error

       A bare sort used to be a weird way to create an empty list; now it croaks at compile time. This change is
       intended to free up some of the syntax space for possible future enhancements to "sort".

</pre><h4><b>Deprecations</b></h4><pre>
   <b>"use</b> <b>VERSION"</b> <b>(where</b> <b>VERSION</b> <b>is</b> <b>below</b> <b>v5.11)</b> <b>after</b> <b>"use</b> <b>v5.11"</b> <b>is</b> <b>deprecated</b>
       When  in  the scope of "use v5.11" or later, a "use vX" line where <u>X</u> is lower than v5.11 will now issue a
       warning:

           Downgrading a use VERSION declaration to below v5.11 is deprecated

       For example:

           use v5.14;
           say "The say statement is permitted";
           use v5.8;                               # This will print a warning
           print "We must use print\n";

       This is because the Perl team plans to change the behavior in this case.  Since Perl v5.12 (and parts  of
       v5.11), strict is enabled <u>unless</u> <u>it</u> <u>had</u> <u>previously</u> <u>been</u> <u>disabled</u>.  In other words:

           no strict;
           use v5.12;  # will not enable strict, because "no strict" preceded it
           $x = 1;     # permitted, despite no "my" declaration

       In  the future, this behavior will be eliminated and "use VERSION" will <u>always</u> enable strict for versions
       v5.12 and later.

       Code which wishes to mix versions in this manner should use lexical scoping with block syntax  to  ensure
       that the differently versioned regions remain lexically isolated.

           {
               use v5.14;
               say "The say statement is permitted";
           }

           {
               use v5.8;                           # No warning is emitted
               print "We must use print\n";
           }

       Of  course,  this  is  probably not something you ever need to do!  If the first block compiles, it means
       you're using perl v5.14.0 or later.

</pre><h4><b>Performance</b> <b>Enhancements</b></h4><pre>
       •   We now probe for compiler support for C11 thread local storage, and  where  available  use  this  for
           "implicit context" for XS extensions making API calls for a threaded Perl build.  This requires fewer
           function  calls  at  the  C level than POSIX thread specific storage. We continue to use the pthreads
           approach if the C11 approach is not available.

           <u>Configure</u> run with the defaults will build an unthreaded Perl (which is slightly  faster),  but  most
           operating systems ship a threaded Perl.

       •   Perl can now be configured to no longer allocate keys for large hashes from the shared string table.

           The same internal datatype ("PVHV") is used for all of

           •   Symbol tables

           •   Objects (by default)

           •   Associative arrays

           The  shared  string  table  was  originally  added  to improve performance for blessed hashes used as
           objects, because every object instance has the same keys, so it is an optimisation  to  share  memory
           between  them.  It  also makes sense for symbol tables, where derived classes will have the same keys
           (typically method names), and the OP trees built for method calls can also share memory.  The  shared
           string table behaves roughly like a cache for hash keys.

           But  for hashes actually used as associative arrays - mapping keys to values - typically the keys are
           not re-used in other hashes. For example, "seen" hashes are keyed by object IDs (or  addresses),  and
           logically these keys won't repeat in other hashes.

           Storing these "used just once" keys in the shared string table increases CPU and RAM use for no gain.
           For  such  keys  the  shared string table behaves as a cache with a 0% hit rate. Storing all the keys
           there increases the total size of the shared string table, as well as increasing the number of  times
           it  is  resized  as  it  grows.  <b>Worse</b> - in any environment that has "copy on write" memory for child
           process (such as a pre-forking server), the memory pages used for the  shared  string  table  rapidly
           need  to  be copied as the child process manipulates hashes. Hence if most of the shared string table
           is such that keys are used only in one place, there  is  no  benefit  from  re-use  within  the  perl
           interpreter, but a high cost due to more pages for the OS to copy.

           The  perl  interpreter can now be Configured to disable shared hash keys for "large" hashes (that are
           neither       objects       nor       symbol       tables).        To        do        so,        add
           "-Accflags='-DPERL_USE_UNSHARED_KEYS_IN_LARGE_HASHES'"  to  your  <u>Configure</u>  options.   "Large"  is a
           heuristic -- currently the heuristic is that sharing is disabled when adding a key to a hash triggers
           allocation of more storage, and the hash has more than 42 keys.

           This <b>might</b> cause slightly increased memory usage for programs that create (unblessed) data structures
           that contain multiple large hashes that share the same keys. But generally our testing suggests  that
           for the specific cases described it is a win, and other code is unaffected.

       •   In certain scenarios, creation of new scalars is now noticeably faster.

           For example, the following code is now executing ~30% faster:

               $str = "A" x 64;
               for (0..1_000_000) {
                   @svs = split //, $str
               }

           (You can read more about this one in [perl #19414] &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/pull/19414&gt;.)

</pre><h4><b>Documentation</b></h4><pre>
   <b>New</b> <b>Documentation</b>
       <u>Porting/vote_admin_guide.pod</u>

       This document provides the process for administering an election or vote within the Perl Core Team.

   <b>Changes</b> <b>to</b> <b>Existing</b> <b>Documentation</b>
       We  have  attempted  to  update the documentation to reflect the changes listed in this document.  If you
       find any we have missed, open an issue at &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues&gt;.

       Additionally, the following selected changes have been made:

       <u>perlapi</u>

       •   This has been cleaned up some, and more than 80% of the (previously many) undocumented functions have
           now either been documented or deemed to have been inappropriately marked as API.

           As always, Patches Welcome!

       <u>perldeprecation</u>

       •   notes the new location for functions moved from Pod::Html  to  Pod::Html::Util  that  are  no  longer
           intended to be used outside of core.

       <u>perlexperiment</u>

       •   notes the ":win32" IO pseudolayer is removed (this happened in 5.35.2).

       <u>perlgov</u>

       •   The  election  process  has  been  finetuned  to  allow  the  vote to be skipped if there are no more
           candidates than open seats.

       •   A special election is now allowed to be postponed for up to twelve weeks, for example until a  normal
           election.

       <u>perlop</u>

       •   now  notes  that  an  invocant  only  needs  to  be an object or class name for method calls, not for
           subroutine references.

       <u>perlre</u>

       •   Updated to discourage the use of the /d regexp modifier.

       <u>perlrun</u>

       •   <b>-?</b> is now a synonym for <b>-h</b>

       •   <b>-g</b> is now a synonym for <b>-0777</b>

</pre><h4><b>Diagnostics</b></h4><pre>
       The following additions or changes have been made to diagnostic  output,  including  warnings  and  fatal
       error messages.  For the complete list of diagnostic messages, see perldiag.

   <b>New</b> <b>Diagnostics</b>
       <u>New</u> <u>Errors</u>

       •   Can't "%s" out of a "defer" block

           (F)  An  attempt was made to jump out of the scope of a defer block by using a control-flow statement
           such as "return", "goto" or a loop control. This is not permitted.

       •   Can't modify %s in %s (for scalar assignment to "undef")

           Attempting to perform a scalar assignment to "undef", for example via  "undef  =  $foo;",  previously
           triggered  a  fatal runtime error with the message "Modification of a read-only value attempted."  It
           is more helpful to detect such attempted assignments prior to runtime, so they are now  compile  time
           errors, resulting in the message "Can't modify undef operator in scalar assignment".

       •   panic: newFORLOOP, %s

           The parser failed an internal consistency check while trying to parse a "foreach" loop.

       <u>New</u> <u>Warnings</u>

       •   Built-in function '%s' is experimental

           A call is being made to a function in the "builtin::" namespace, which is currently experimental.

       •   defer is experimental

           The  "defer" block modifier is experimental. If you want to use the feature, disable the warning with
           "no warnings 'experimental::defer'", but know that in doing so you are taking the risk that your code
           may break in a future Perl version.

       •   Downgrading a use VERSION declaration to below v5.11 is deprecated

           This warning is emitted on a "use VERSION" statement that requests a version below  v5.11  (when  the
           effects  of  "use  strict"  would  be  disabled), after a previous declaration of one having a larger
           number (which would have enabled these effects)

       •   for my (...) is experimental

           This warning is emitted if you use "for" to iterate  multiple  values  at  a  time.  This  syntax  is
           currently experimental and its behaviour may change in future releases of Perl.

       •   Implicit use of @_ in %s with signatured subroutine is experimental

           An  expression  that implicitly involves the @_ arguments array was found in a subroutine that uses a
           signature.

       •   Use of @_ in %s with signatured subroutine is experimental

           An expression involving the @_ arguments array was found in a subroutine that uses a signature.

       •   Wide character in $0

           Attempts to put wide characters into the program name ($0) now provoke this warning.

   <b>Changes</b> <b>to</b> <b>Existing</b> <b>Diagnostics</b>
       •   '/' does not take a repeat count in %s

           This warning used to not include the "in %s".

       •   Subroutine %s redefined

           Localized subroutine redefinitions no longer trigger this warning.

       •   unexpected constant lvalue entersub entry via type/targ %d:%d" now has a panic prefix

           This makes it consistent with other checks of internal consistency when compiling a subroutine.

       •   Useless use of sort in scalar context is now in the new "scalar" category.

           When "sort" is used in scalar context, it provokes a warning that doing  this  is  not  useful.  This
           warning  used  to be in the "void" category. A new category for warnings about scalar context has now
           been added, called "scalar".

       •   Removed a number of diagnostics

           Many diagnostics that have been removed from the perl core across  many  years  have  now  <u>also</u>  been
           removed from the documentation.

</pre><h4><b>Configuration</b> <b>and</b> <b>Compilation</b></h4><pre>
       •   The  Perl  C  source  code  now  uses  some C99 features, which we have verified are supported by all
           compilers we target. This means that Perl's headers now contain some code that is legal  in  C99  but
           not C89.

           This     may     cause     problems    for    some    XS    modules    that    unconditionally    add
           "-Werror=declaration-after-statement" to their C compiler flags  if  compiling  with  gcc  or  clang.
           Earlier  versions  of  Perl  support long obsolete compilers that are strict in rejecting certain C99
           features, particularly mixed declarations and code, and hence it makes sense for XS module authors to
           audit that their code does not violate this. However, doing  this  is  now  only  possible  on  these
           earlier  versions  of  Perl,  hence  these modules need to be changed to only add this flag for "$] &lt;
           5.035005".

       •   The makedepend step is now run in parallel by using make

           When using MAKEFLAGS=-j8, this significantly reduces the time required for:

               sh ./makedepend MAKE=make cflags

       •   <u>Configure</u> now tests whether "#include &lt;xlocale.h&gt;" is required to  use  the  POSIX  1003  thread-safe
           locale  functions or some related extensions.  This prevents problems where a non-public <u>xlocale.h</u> is
           removed  in  a  library  update,  or  <u>xlocale.h</u>  isn't  intended  for  public  use.  (github   #18936
           &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/pull/18936&gt;)

</pre><h4><b>Testing</b></h4><pre>
       Tests were added and changed to reflect the other additions and changes in this release.

</pre><h4><b>Platform</b> <b>Support</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Windows</b>
       •   Support for old MSVC++ (pre-VC12) has been removed

           These did not support C99 and hence can no longer be used to compile perl.

       •   Support for compiling perl on Windows using Microsoft Visual Studio 2022 (containing Visual C++ 14.3)
           has been added.

       •   The :win32 IO layer has been removed. This experimental replacement for the :unix layer never reached
           maturity in its nearly two decades of existence.

   <b>VMS</b>
       "keys %ENV" on VMS returns consistent results
           On  VMS  entries in the %ENV hash are loaded from the OS environment on first access, hence the first
           iteration of %ENV requires the entire environment to be scanned  to  find  all  possible  keys.  This
           initialisation  had  always  been done correctly for full iteration, but previously was not happening
           for %ENV in scalar context, meaning that "scalar %ENV" would return 0 if called before any other %ENV
           access, or would only return the count of keys accessed if there had been no iteration.

           These bugs are now fixed - %ENV and "keys %ENV" in scalar context now return the correct result - the
           count of all keys in the environment.

   <b>Discontinued</b> <b>Platforms</b>
       AT&amp;T UWIN
           UWIN is a UNIX compatibility layer for Windows.  It was last released in 2012 and has been superseded
           by Cygwin these days.

       DOS/DJGPP
           DJGPP is a port of the GNU toolchain to 32-bit x86 systems running DOS.  The last  known  attempt  to
           build Perl on it was on 5.20, which only got as far as building miniperl.

       NetWare
           Support  code  for Novell NetWare has been removed.  NetWare was a server operating system by Novell.
           The port was last updated in July 2002, and the platform itself in May 2009.

           Unrelated changes accidentally broke the build for the NetWare port in  September  2009,  and  in  12
           years no-one has reported this.

   <b>Platform-Specific</b> <b>Notes</b>
       z/OS
           This  update  enables  us  to build EBCDIC static/dynamic and 31-bit/64-bit addressing mode Perl. The
           number of tests that pass is consistent with the baseline before these updates.

           These changes also provide  the  base  support  to  be  able  to  provide  ASCII  static/dynamic  and
           31-bit/64-bit addressing mode Perl.

           The z/OS (previously called OS/390) README was updated to describe ASCII and EBCDIC builds.

</pre><h4><b>Internal</b> <b>Changes</b></h4><pre>
       •   Since  the  removal  of  PERL_OBJECT  in  Perl  5.8, PERL_IMPLICIT_CONTEXT and MULTIPLICITY have been
           synonymous and they were being  used  interchangeably.   To  simplify  the  code,  all  instances  of
           PERL_IMPLICIT_CONTEXT have been replaced with MULTIPLICITY.

           PERL_IMPLICIT_CONTEXT will remain defined for compatibility with XS modules.

       •   The  API  constant  formerly named "G_ARRAY", indicating list context, has now been renamed to a more
           accurate "G_LIST".  A compatibilty macro "G_ARRAY" has been added to  allow  existing  code  to  work
           unaffected.   New  code  should  be  written  using  the  new constant instead.  This is supported by
           "Devel::PPPort" version 3.63.

       •   Macros  have  been  added  to  <u>perl.h</u>  to  facilitate  version  comparisons:   "PERL_GCC_VERSION_GE",
           "PERL_GCC_VERSION_GT", "PERL_GCC_VERSION_LE" and "PERL_GCC_VERSION_LT".

           Inline  functions have been added to <u>embed.h</u> to determine the position of the least significant 1 bit
           in a word: "lsbit_pos32" and "lsbit_pos64".

       •   "Perl_ptr_table_clear" has been deleted. This has been marked as deprecated since  v5.14.0  (released
           in 2011), and is not used by any code on CPAN.

       •   Added  new  boolean  macros  and functions. See "Stable boolean tracking" for related information and
           perlapi for documentation.

           •   sv_setbool

           •   sv_setbool_mg

           •   SvIsBOOL

       •   Added 4 missing functions for dealing with RVs:

           •   sv_setrv_noinc

           •   sv_setrv_noinc_mg

           •   sv_setrv_inc

           •   sv_setrv_inc_mg

       •   xs_handshake()'s two failure modes now provide distinct messages.

       •   Memory for hash iterator state ("struct xpvhv_aux") is now  allocated  as  part  of  the  hash  body,
           instead of as part of the block of memory allocated for the main hash array.

       •   A  new  <b>phase_name()</b> interface provides access to the name for each interpreter phase (i.e., PL_phase
           value).

       •   The "pack" behavior of "U" has changed for EBCDIC.

       •   New   equality-test   functions   "sv_numeq"   and   "sv_streq"   have   been   added,   along   with
           "..._flags"-suffixed  variants.   These  expose  a  simple and consistent API to perform numerical or
           string comparison which is aware of operator overloading.

       •   Reading the string form of an integer value no longer sets the flag "SVf_POK".  The  string  form  is
           still  cached  internally,  and  still  re-read  directly by the macros SvPV(sv) <u>etc</u> (inline, without
           calling a C function). XS code that already calls the APIs to get values will not be affected by this
           change. XS code that accesses flags directly instead of using API calls to express its  intent  <u>might</u>
           break,  but  such  code  likely  is already buggy if passed some other values, such as floating point
           values or objects with string overloading.

           This small change permits code (such as JSON serializers) to reliably determine between

           •   a value that was initially <b>written</b> as an integer, but then <b>read</b> as a string

                   my $answer = 42;
                   print "The answer is $answer\n";

           •   that same value that was initially <b>written</b> as a string, but then <b>read</b> as an integer

                   my $answer = "42";
                   print "That doesn't look right\n"
                       unless $answer == 6 * 9;

           For the first case (originally written as an integer), we now have:

               use Devel::Peek;
               my $answer = 42;
               Dump ($answer);
               my $void = "$answer";
               print STDERR "\n";
               Dump($answer)

               SV = <a href="../man0x562538925778/IV.0x562538925778.html">IV</a>(0x562538925778) at 0x562538925788
                 REFCNT = 1
                 FLAGS = (IOK,pIOK)
                 IV = 42

               SV = <a href="../man0x5625389263c0/PVIV.0x5625389263c0.html">PVIV</a>(0x5625389263c0) at 0x562538925788
                 REFCNT = 1
                 FLAGS = (IOK,pIOK,pPOK)
                 IV = 42
                 PV = 0x562538919b50 "42"\0
                 CUR = 2
                 LEN = 10

           For the second (originally written as a string), we now have:

               use Devel::Peek;
               my $answer = "42";
               Dump ($answer);
               my $void = $answer == 6 * 9;
               print STDERR "\n";
               Dump($answer)'

               SV = <a href="../man0x5586ffe9bfb0/PV.0x5586ffe9bfb0.html">PV</a>(0x5586ffe9bfb0) at 0x5586ffec0788
                 REFCNT = 1
                 FLAGS = (POK,IsCOW,pPOK)
                 PV = 0x5586ffee7fd0 "42"\0
                 CUR = 2
                 LEN = 10
                 COW_REFCNT = 1

               SV = <a href="../man0x5586ffec13c0/PVIV.0x5586ffec13c0.html">PVIV</a>(0x5586ffec13c0) at 0x5586ffec0788
                 REFCNT = 1
                 FLAGS = (IOK,POK,IsCOW,pIOK,pPOK)
                 IV = 42
                 PV = 0x5586ffee7fd0 "42"\0
                 CUR = 2
                 LEN = 10
                 COW_REFCNT = 1

           (One can't rely on the presence or absence of the  flag  "SVf_IsCOW"  to  determine  the  history  of
           operations on a scalar.)

           Previously both cases would be indistinguishable, with all 4 flags set:

               SV = <a href="../man0x55d4d62edaf0/PVIV.0x55d4d62edaf0.html">PVIV</a>(0x55d4d62edaf0) at 0x55d4d62f0930
                 REFCNT = 1
                 FLAGS = (IOK,POK,pIOK,pPOK)
                 IV = 42
                 PV = 0x55d4d62e1740 "42"\0
                 CUR = 2
                 LEN = 10

           (and possibly "SVf_IsCOW", but not always)

           This  now means that if XS code <u>really</u> needs to determine which form a value was first written as, it
           should implement logic roughly

               if (flags &amp; SVf_IOK|SVf_NOK) &amp;&amp; !(flags &amp; SVf_POK)
                   serialize as number
               else if (flags &amp; SVf_POK)
                   serialize as string
               else
                   the existing guesswork ...

           Note that this doesn't cover "dualvars" - scalars that report different values when asked  for  their
           string form or number form (such as $!).  Most serialization formats cannot represent such duplicity.

           <u>The</u>  <u>existing</u>  <u>guesswork</u>  remains  because  as well as dualvars, values might be "undef", references,
           overloaded references, typeglobs and other things that Perl itself can represent but do not map  one-
           to-one into external formats, so need some amount of approximation or encapsulation.

       •   "sv_dump"  (and  Devel::Peek’s  "Dump"  function) now escapes high-bit octets in the PV as hex rather
           than octal. Since most folks understand hex more readily than octal, this should make these  dumps  a
           bit more legible.  This does <b>not</b> affect any other diagnostic interfaces like "pv_display".

       •   <b>utime()</b> now correctly sets errno/$! when called on a closed handle.

       •   The  flags  on  the OPTVAL parameter to <b>setsockopt()</b> were previously checked before magic was called,
           possibly treating a numeric value as a packed buffer or vice versa.  It also ignored the UTF-8  flag,
           potentially  treating  the  internal  representation  of an upgraded SV as the bytes to supply to the
           <b>setsockopt()</b> system call.  (github #18660 &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/18660&gt;)

       •   Only    set    IOKp,    not    IOK    on    $)     and     $(.      This     was     issue     #18955
           &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/18955&gt;:  This  will  prevent serializers from serializing these
           variables as numbers (which loses the additional groups).  This restores behaviour from 5.16

       •   Use of the "mktables" debugging facility would cause perl to croak since v5.31.10; this  problem  has
           now been fixed.

       •   "makedepend"     logic     is     now     compatible    with    BSD    make    (fixes    GH    #19046
           &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/19046&gt;).

       •   Calling "untie" on a tied hash that is partway  through  iteration  now  frees  the  iteration  state
           immediately.

           Iterating  a  tied  hash  causes  perl to store a copy of the current hash key to track the iteration
           state, with this stored copy passed as the second parameter to  "NEXTKEY".  This  internal  state  is
           freed  immediately  when  tie  hash  iteration  completes, or if the hash is destroyed, but due to an
           implementation oversight, it was not freed if the hash was untied. In that case, the internal copy of
           the key would persist until the earliest of

           1.  "tie" was called again on the same hash

           2.  The (now untied) hash was iterated (ie passed to any of "keys", "values" or "each")

           3.  The hash was destroyed.

           This inconsistency is now fixed - the internal state is now freed immediately by "untie".

           As the precise timing of this behaviour can be observed with pure Perl code (the timing of  "DESTROY"
           on  objects returned from "FIRSTKEY" and "NEXTKEY") it's just possible that some code is sensitive to
           it.

       •   The Internals::getcwd() function added  for  bootstrapping  miniperl  in  perl  5.30.0  is  now  only
           available in miniperl. [github #19122]

       •   Setting  a  breakpoint  on  a BEGIN or equivalently a "use" statement could cause a memory write to a
           freed "dbstate" op.  [GH #19198 &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/19198&gt;]

       •   When bareword filehandles are disabled, the parser was interpreting any  bareword  as  a  filehandle,
           even when immediatey followed by parens.

       Raun  "Spider"  Boardman  (SPIDB  on CPAN), author of at least 66 commits to the Perl 5 core distribution
       between 1996 and 2002, passed away May 24, 2021 from complications of COVID.  He will be missed.

       David H. Adler (DHA) passed away on November 16, 2021.  In 1997, David co-founded NY.pm, the  first  Perl
       user group, and in 1998 co-founded Perl Mongers to help establish other user groups across the globe.  He
       was  a frequent attendee at Perl conferences in both North America and Europe and well known for his role
       in organizing <u>Bad</u> <u>Movie</u> <u>Night</u> celebrations at those conferences.  He also contributed to the work of  the
       Perl  Foundation,  including  administering  the  White  Camel  awards for community service.  He will be
       missed.

       The list above is almost certainly incomplete as it  is  automatically  generated  from  version  control
       history.  In  particular,  it  does not include the names of the (very much appreciated) contributors who
       reported issues to the Perl bug tracker.

       Many of the changes included in this version originated in the CPAN  modules  included  in  Perl's  core.
