</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       perlsource - A guide to the Perl source tree

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This document describes the layout of the Perl source tree. If you're hacking on the Perl core, this will
       help you find what you're looking for.

</pre><h4><b>FINDING</b> <b>YOUR</b> <b>WAY</b> <b>AROUND</b></h4><pre>
       The Perl source tree is big. Here's some of the thing you'll find in it:

   <b>C</b> <b>code</b>
       The C source code and header files mostly live in the root of the source tree. There are a few platform-
       specific directories which contain C code. In addition, some of the modules shipped with Perl include C
       or XS code.

       See perlinterp for more details on the files that make up the Perl interpreter, as well as details on how
       it works.

   <b>Core</b> <b>modules</b>
       Modules shipped as part of the Perl core live in four subdirectories.  Two of these directories contain
       modules that live in the core, and two contain modules that can also be released separately on CPAN.
       Modules which can be released on cpan are known as "dual-life" modules.

       •   <u>lib/</u>

           This directory contains pure-Perl modules which are only released as part of the core. This directory
           contains <u>all</u> of the modules and their tests, unlike other core modules.

       •   <u>ext/</u>

           Like <u>lib/</u>, this directory contains modules which are only released as part of the core.  Unlike <u>lib/</u>,
           however,  a  module  under  <u>ext/</u>  generally  has  a CPAN-style directory- and file-layout and its own
           <u>Makefile.PL</u>.  There is no expectation that a module under <u>ext/</u> will work  with  earlier  versions  of
           Perl 5.  Hence, such a module may take full advantage of syntactical and other improvements in Perl 5
           blead.

       •   <u>dist/</u>

           This  directory  is for dual-life modules where the blead source is canonical. Note that some modules
           in this directory may not yet have been released separately on CPAN.  Modules under <u>dist/</u> should make
           an effort to work with earlier versions of Perl 5.

       •   <u>cpan/</u>

           This directory contains dual-life modules where the CPAN module is  canonical.  Do  not  patch  these
           modules  directly! Changes to these modules should be submitted to the maintainer of the CPAN module.
           Once those changes are applied and released, the new version of the module will be incorporated  into
           the core.

       For  some  dual-life  modules,  it has not yet been determined if the CPAN version or the blead source is
       canonical. Until that is done, those modules should be in <u>cpan/</u>.

   <b>Tests</b>
       The Perl core has an extensive test suite. If you add new tests (or new modules with tests), you may need
       to update the <u>t/TEST</u> file so that the tests are run.

       •   Module tests

           Tests for core modules in the <u>lib/</u> directory are right next to the module  itself.  For  example,  we
           have <u>lib/strict.pm</u> and <u>lib/strict.t</u>.

           Tests  for modules in <u>ext/</u> and the dual-life modules are in <u>t/</u> subdirectories for each module, like a
           standard CPAN distribution.

       •   <u>t/base/</u>

           Tests for the absolute basic functionality of Perl. This includes "if", basic file reads and  writes,
           simple  regexes,  etc.  These  are  run first in the test suite and if any of them fail, something is
           <u>really</u> broken.

       •   <u>t/cmd/</u>

           Tests for basic control structures, "if"/"else", "while", subroutines, etc.

       •   <u>t/comp/</u>

           Tests for basic issues of how Perl parses and compiles itself.

       •   <u>t/io/</u>

           Tests for built-in IO functions, including command line arguments.

       •   <u>t/mro/</u>

           Tests for perl's method resolution order implementations (see mro).

       •   <u>t/op/</u>

           Tests for perl's built in functions that don't fit into any of the other directories.

       •   <u>t/opbasic/</u>

           Tests for perl's built in functions which, like those in <u>t/op/</u>, do not fit  into  any  of  the  other
           directories,  but  which,  in addition, cannot use <u>t/test.pl</u>,as that program depends on functionality
           which the test file itself is testing.

       •   <u>t/re/</u>

           Tests for regex related functions or behaviour. (These used to live in t/op).

       •   <u>t/run/</u>

           Tests for features of how perl actually runs, including exit codes and handling of PERL*  environment
           variables.

       •   <u>t/uni/</u>

           Tests for the core support of Unicode.

       •   <u>t/win32/</u>

           Windows-specific tests.

       •   <u>t/porting/</u>

           Tests the state of the source tree for various common errors. For example, it tests that everyone who
           is listed in the git log has a corresponding entry in the <u>AUTHORS</u> file.

       •   <u>t/lib/</u>

           The  old home for the module tests, you shouldn't put anything new in here. There are still some bits
           and pieces hanging around in here that need to be moved. Perhaps you could move them?  Thanks!

   <b>Documentation</b>
       All of the core documentation intended for end users lives in <u>pod/</u>.  Individual modules  in  <u>lib/</u>,  <u>ext/</u>,
       <u>dist/</u>,  and  <u>cpan/</u>  usually have their own documentation, either in the <u>Module.pm</u> file or an accompanying
       <u>Module.pod</u> file.

       Finally, documentation intended for core Perl developers lives in the <u>Porting/</u> directory.

   <b>Hacking</b> <b>tools</b> <b>and</b> <b>documentation</b>
       The <u>Porting</u> directory contains a grab bag of code and documentation intended  to  help  porters  work  on
       Perl. Some of the highlights include:

       •   <u>check*</u>

           These  are  scripts  which  will check the source things like ANSI C violations, POD encoding issues,
           etc.

       •   <u>Maintainers</u>, <u>Maintainers.pl</u>, and <u>Maintainers.pm</u>

           These files contain information on who maintains which  modules.  Run  "perl  Porting/Maintainers  -M
           Module::Name" to find out more information about a dual-life module.

       •   <u>podtidy</u>

           Tidies a pod file. It's a good idea to run this on a pod file you've patched.

   <b>Build</b> <b>system</b>
       The Perl build system on *nix-like systems starts with the <u>Configure</u> script in the root directory.

       Platform-specific  pieces  of  the  build  system also live in platform-specific directories like <u>win32/</u>,
       <u>vms/</u>, etc.  Windows and VMS have their own Configure-like scripts, in their respective directories.

       The <u>Configure</u> script (or a platform-specific similar script) is ultimately responsible for  generating  a
       <u>Makefile</u> from <u>Makefile.SH</u>.

       The  build system that Perl uses is called metaconfig. This system is maintained separately from the Perl
       core, and knows about the platform-specific Configure-like scripts, as well as <u>Configure</u> itself.

       The   metaconfig   system   has   its   own   git   repository.   Please   see   its   README   file   in
       &lt;https://github.com/Perl/metaconfig&gt; for more details.

       The  <u>Cross</u>  directory  contains  various files related to cross-compiling Perl. See <u>Cross/README</u> for more
       details.

   <u><b>AUTHORS</b></u>
       This file lists everyone who's contributed to Perl. If you submit a patch, you should add  your  name  to
       this file as part of the patch.

   <u><b>MANIFEST</b></u>
       The  <u>MANIFEST</u> file in the root of the source tree contains a list of every file in the Perl core, as well
       as a brief description of each file.

       You can get an overview of all the files with this command:

         % perl -lne 'print if /^[^\/]+\.[ch]\s+/' MANIFEST
