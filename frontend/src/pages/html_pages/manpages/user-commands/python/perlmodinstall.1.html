       perlmodinstall - Installing CPAN Modules

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       You can think of a module as the fundamental unit of reusable Perl code; see perlmod for details.
       Whenever anyone creates a chunk of Perl code that they think will be useful to the world, they register
       as a Perl developer at &lt;https://www.cpan.org/modules/04pause.html&gt; so that they can then upload their
       code to the CPAN.  The CPAN is the Comprehensive Perl Archive Network and can be accessed at
       &lt;https://www.cpan.org/&gt; , and searched at &lt;https://metacpan.org/&gt; .

       This documentation is for people who want to download CPAN modules and install them on their own
       computer.

   <b>PREAMBLE</b>
       First, are you sure that the module isn't already on your system?  Try "perl -MFoo -e 1".  (Replace "Foo"
       with the name of the module; for instance, "perl -MCGI::Carp -e 1".)

       If you don't see an error message, you have the module.  (If you do see an error message, it's still
       possible you have the module, but that it's not in your path, which you can display with perl -e "print
       qq(@INC)".)  For the remainder of this document, we'll assume that you really honestly truly lack an
       installed module, but have found it on the CPAN.

       So now you have a file ending in .tar.gz (or, less often, .zip).  You know there's a tasty module inside.
       There are four steps you must now take:

       <b>DECOMPRESS</b> the file
       <b>UNPACK</b> the file into a directory
       <b>BUILD</b> the module (sometimes unnecessary)
       <b>INSTALL</b> the module.

       Here's  how  to  perform each step for each operating system.  This is &lt;not&gt; a substitute for reading the
       README and INSTALL files that might have come with your module!

       Also note that these instructions are tailored for installing the module into your system's repository of
       Perl modules, but you can install modules into any directory you wish.  For instance, where I  say  "perl
       Makefile.PL", you can substitute "perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/my/perl_directory" to install the modules into
       <u>/my/perl_directory</u>.    Then   you   can   use   the  modules  from  your  Perl  programs  with  "use  lib
       "/my/perl_directory/lib/site_perl";" or sometimes just  "use  "/my/perl_directory";".   If  you're  on  a
       system  that requires superuser/root access to install modules into the directories you see when you type
       "perl -e "print qq(@INC)"", you'll want to install them  into  a  local  directory  (such  as  your  home
       directory) and use this approach.

       •   <b>If</b> <b>you're</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>Unix</b> <b>or</b> <b>Unix-like</b> <b>system,</b>

           You  can  use  Andreas  Koenig's  CPAN module ( &lt;https://metacpan.org/release/CPAN&gt; ) to automate the
           following steps, from DECOMPRESS through INSTALL.

           A. DECOMPRESS

           Decompress the file with "gzip -d yourmodule.tar.gz"

           You can get gzip from &lt;<a href="ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu/">ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu/</a>&gt;

           Or, you can combine this step with the next to save disk space:

                gzip -dc yourmodule.tar.gz | tar -xof -

           B. UNPACK

           Unpack the result with "tar -xof yourmodule.tar"

           C. BUILD

           Go into the newly-created directory and type:

                 perl Makefile.PL
                 make test

           or

                 perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/my/perl_directory

           to  install  it  locally.   (Remember  that  if  you  do  this,  you'll  have   to   put   "use   lib
           "/my/perl_directory";" near the top of the program that is to use this module.

           D. INSTALL

           While still in that directory, type:

                 make install

           Make  sure  you  have  the  appropriate  permissions  to  install  the  module in your Perl 5 library
           directory.  Often, you'll need to be root.

           That's all you need to do on Unix systems with dynamic  linking.   Most  Unix  systems  have  dynamic
           linking. If yours doesn't, or if for another reason you have a statically-linked perl, <b>and</b> the module
           requires compilation, you'll need to build a new Perl binary that includes the module.  Again, you'll
           probably need to be root.

       •   <b>If</b> <b>you're</b> <b>running</b> <b>ActivePerl</b> <b>(Win95/98/2K/NT/XP,</b> <b>Linux,</b> <b>Solaris),</b>

           First,  type "ppm" from a shell and see whether ActiveState's PPM repository has your module.  If so,
           you can install it with "ppm" and you won't have to bother with any of the  other  steps  here.   You
           might  be able to use the CPAN instructions from the "Unix or Linux" section above as well; give it a
           try.  Otherwise, you'll have to follow the steps below.

              A. DECOMPRESS

           You can  use  the  open  source  7-zip  (  &lt;https://www.7-zip.org/&gt;  )  or  the  shareware  Winzip  (
           &lt;https://www.winzip.com&gt; ) to decompress and unpack modules.

              B. UNPACK

           If you used WinZip, this was already done for you.

              C. BUILD

           You'll need either "nmake" or "gmake".

           Does  the module require compilation (i.e. does it have files that end in .xs, .c, .h, .y, .cc, .cxx,
           or .C)?  If it does, life is now officially tough for you, because you have  to  compile  the  module
           yourself  (no  easy feat on Windows).  You'll need a compiler such as Visual C++.  Alternatively, you
           can       download       a        pre-built        PPM        package        from        ActiveState.
           &lt;<a href="http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Downloads/ActivePerl/PPM/">http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Downloads/ActivePerl/PPM/</a>&gt;

           Go into the newly-created directory and type:

                 perl Makefile.PL
                 nmake test

              D. INSTALL

           While still in that directory, type:

                 nmake install

       •   <b>If</b> <b>you're</b> <b>on</b> <b>OS/2,</b>

           Get      the      EMX      development      suite      and      gzip/tar      from      Hobbes      (
           &lt;<a href="http://hobbes.nmsu.edu/h-browse.php">http://hobbes.nmsu.edu/h-browse.php</a>?dir=/pub/os2/dev/emx/v0.9d&gt; ), and then follow the  instructions
           for Unix.

       •   <b>If</b> <b>you're</b> <b>on</b> <b>VMS,</b>

           When  downloading  from CPAN, save your file with a ".tgz" extension instead of ".tar.gz".  All other
           periods in the filename should be replaced with underscores.  For example,  "Your-Module-1.33.tar.gz"
           should be downloaded as "Your-Module-1_33.tgz".

           A. DECOMPRESS

           Type

               gzip -d Your-Module.tgz

           or, for zipped modules, type

               unzip Your-Module.zip

           Executables for gzip, zip, and VMStar:

               <a href="http://www.hp.com/go/openvms/freeware/">http://www.hp.com/go/openvms/freeware/</a>

           and their source code:

               <a href="http://www.fsf.org/order/ftp.html">http://www.fsf.org/order/ftp.html</a>

           Note  that GNU's gzip/gunzip is not the same as Info-ZIP's zip/unzip package.  The former is a simple
           compression tool; the latter permits creation of multi-file archives.

           B. UNPACK

           If you're using VMStar:

                VMStar xf Your-Module.tar

           Or, if you're fond of VMS command syntax:

                tar/extract/verbose Your_Module.tar

           C. BUILD

           Make  sure  you  have  MMS  (from  Digital)  or  the  freeware  MMK  (  available  from  MadGoat   at
           &lt;<a href="http://www.madgoat.com">http://www.madgoat.com</a>&gt; ).  Then type this to create the DESCRIP.MMS for the module:

               perl Makefile.PL

           Now you're ready to build:

               mms test

           Substitute "mmk" for "mms" above if you're using MMK.

           D. INSTALL

           Type

               mms install

           Substitute "mmk" for "mms" above if you're using MMK.

       •   <b>If</b> <b>you're</b> <b>on</b> <b>MVS</b>,

           Introduce the <u>.tar.gz</u> file into an HFS as binary; don't translate from ASCII to EBCDIC.

           A. DECOMPRESS

           Decompress the file with "gzip -d yourmodule.tar.gz"

           You can get gzip from &lt;<a href="http://www.s390.ibm.com/products/oe/bpxqp1.html">http://www.s390.ibm.com/products/oe/bpxqp1.html</a>&gt;

           B. UNPACK

           Unpack the result with

                pax -o to=IBM-1047,from=ISO8859-1 -r &lt; yourmodule.tar

           The  BUILD  and  INSTALL steps are identical to those for Unix.  Some modules generate Makefiles that
           work better with GNU make, which is available from &lt;<a href="http://www.mks.com/s390/gnu/">http://www.mks.com/s390/gnu/</a>&gt;

</pre><h4><b>PORTABILITY</b></h4><pre>
       Note that not all modules will work with  on  all  platforms.   See  perlport  for  more  information  on
       portability  issues.   Read  the  documentation to see if the module will work on your system.  There are
       basically three categories of modules that will not work "out of the box" with all platforms  (with  some
       possibility of overlap):

       •   <b>Those</b>  <b>that</b>  <b>should,</b>  <b>but</b> <b>don't.</b>  These need to be fixed; consider contacting the author and possibly
           writing a patch.

       •   <b>Those</b> <b>that</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>compiled,</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>target</b> <b>platform</b> <b>doesn't</b> <b>have</b> <b>compilers</b>  <b>readily</b>  <b>available.</b>
           (These modules contain <u>.xs</u> or <u>.c</u> files, usually.)  You might be able to find existing binaries on the
           CPAN  or  elsewhere,  or  you  might want to try getting compilers and building it yourself, and then
           release the binary for other poor souls to use.

       •   <b>Those</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>targeted</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>specific</b> <b>platform.</b>  (Such as the Win32:: modules.)   If  the  module  is
           targeted specifically at a platform other than yours, you're out of luck, most likely.

       Check  the CPAN Testers if a module should work with your platform but it doesn't behave as you'd expect,
       or you aren't sure whether or not a module will work under your platform.  If the module you  want  isn't
       listed  there,  you can test it yourself and let CPAN Testers know, you can join CPAN Testers, or you can
       request it be tested.

</pre><h4><b>HEY</b></h4><pre>
       If you have any suggested changes for this page, let me know.  Please don't send me mail asking for  help
       on  how  to  install your modules.  There are too many modules, and too few Orwants, for me to be able to
       answer or even acknowledge all your questions.  Contact the module author instead, ask  someone  familiar
       with Perl on your operating system, or if all else fails, file a ticket at &lt;https://rt.cpan.org/&gt;.
