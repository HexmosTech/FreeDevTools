</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       perl5400delta - what is new for perl v5.40.0

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This document describes differences between the 5.38.0 release and the 5.40.0 release.

</pre><h4><b>Core</b> <b>Enhancements</b></h4><pre>
   <b>New</b> <b>"__CLASS__"</b> <b>Keyword</b>
       When using the new "class" feature, code inside a method, "ADJUST" block or field initializer expression
       is now permitted to use the new "__CLASS__" keyword.  This yields a class name, similar to "__PACKAGE__",
       but whereas that gives the compile-time package that the code appears in, the "__CLASS__" keyword is
       aware of the actual run-time class that the object instance is a member of.  This makes it useful for
       method dispatch on that class, especially during constructors, where access to $self is not permitted.

       For more information, see "__CLASS__" in perlfunc.

   <b>":reader"</b> <b>attribute</b> <b>for</b> <b>field</b> <b>variables</b>
       When using the "class" feature, field variables can now take a ":reader" attribute.  This requests that
       an accessor method be automatically created that simply returns the value of the field variable from the
       given instance.

           field $name :reader;

       Is equivalent to

           field $name;
           method name () { return $name; }

       An alternative name can also be provided:

           field $name :reader(get_name);

       For more detail, see ":reader" in perlclass.

   <b>Permit</b> <b>a</b> <b>space</b> <b>in</b> <b>"-M"</b> <b>command-line</b> <b>option</b>
       When processing command-line options, perl now allows a space between the "-M" switch and the name of the
       module after it.

           $ perl -M Data::Dumper=Dumper -E 'say Dumper [1,2,3]'

       This matches the existing behaviour of the "-I" option.

   <b>Restrictions</b> <b>to</b> <b>"use</b> <b>VERSION"</b> <b>declarations</b>
       In Perl 5.36, a deprecation warning was added when downgrading a "use VERSION" declaration from one above
       version 5.11, to below. This has now been made a fatal error.

       Additionally, it is now a fatal error to issue a subsequent "use VERSION" declaration when another is in
       scope, when either version is 5.39 or above.  This is to avoid complications surrounding imported lexical
       functions from builtin.  A deprecation warning has also been added for any other subsequent "use VERSION"
       declaration below version 5.39, to warn that it will no longer be permitted in Perl version 5.44.

   <b>New</b> <b>"builtin::inf"</b> <b>and</b> <b>"builtin::nan"</b> <b>functions</b> <b>(experimental)</b>
       Two new functions, "inf" and "nan", have been added to the "builtin" namespace.  These act like constants
       that yield the floating-point infinity and Not-a-Number value respectively.

   <b>New</b> <b>"^^"</b> <b>logical</b> <b>xor</b> <b>operator</b>
       Perl has always had three low-precedence logical operators "and", "or" and "xor", as well as three high-
       precedence bitwise versions "&amp;", "^" and "|".  Until this release, while the medium-precedence logical
       operators of "&amp;&amp;" and "||" were also present, there was no exclusive-or equivalent.  This release of Perl
       adds the final "^^" operator, completing the set.

           $x ^^ $y and say "One of x or y is true, but not both";

   <b>"try"/"catch"</b> <b>feature</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>experimental</b>
       Prior to this release, the "try"/"catch" feature for handling errors was considered experimental.
       Introduced in Perl version 5.34.0, this is now considered a stable language feature and its use no longer
       prints a warning.  It still must be enabled with the 'try' feature.

       See "Try Catch Exception Handling" in perlsyn.

   <b>"for"</b> <b>iterating</b> <b>over</b> <b>multiple</b> <b>values</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>experimental</b>
       Prior to this release, iterating over multiple values at a time with "for" was considered experimental.
       Introduced in Perl version 5.36.0, this is now considered a stable language feature and its use no longer
       prints a warning.  See "Compound Statements" in perlsyn.

   <b>"builtin"</b> <b>module</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>experimental</b>
       Prior to this release, the builtin module and all of its functions were considered experimental.
       Introduced in Perl version 5.36.0, this module is now considered stable its use no longer prints a
       warning. However, several of its functions are still considered experimental.

   <b>The</b> <b>":5.40"</b> <b>feature</b> <b>bundle</b> <b>adds</b> <b>"try"</b>
       The latest version feature bundle now contains the recently-stablized feature "try". As this feature
       bundle is used by the "-E" commandline switch, these are immediately available in "-E" scripts.

   <b>"use</b> <b>v5.40;"</b> <b>imports</b> <b>builtin</b> <b>functions</b>
       In addition to importing a feature bundle, "use v5.40;" (or later versions) imports the corresponding
       builtin version bundle.

</pre><h4><b>Security</b></h4><pre>
   <b>CVE-2023-47038</b> <b>-</b> <b>Write</b> <b>past</b> <b>buffer</b> <b>end</b> <b>via</b> <b>illegal</b> <b>user-defined</b> <b>Unicode</b> <b>property</b>
       This vulnerability was reported directly to the Perl security team by Nathan Mills
       "<a href="mailto:the.true.nathan.mills@gmail.com">the.true.nathan.mills@gmail.com</a>".

       A crafted regular expression when compiled by perl 5.30.0 through 5.38.0 can cause a one-byte attacker
       controlled buffer overflow in a heap allocated buffer.

   <b>CVE-2023-47039</b> <b>-</b> <b>Perl</b> <b>for</b> <b>Windows</b> <b>binary</b> <b>hijacking</b> <b>vulnerability</b>
       This vulnerability was reported to the Intel Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) by GitHub
       user ycdxsb &lt;https://github.com/ycdxsb/WindowsPrivilegeEscalation&gt;. PSIRT then reported it to the Perl
       security team.

       Perl for Windows relies on the system path environment variable to find the shell ("cmd.exe"). When
       running an executable which uses Windows Perl interpreter, Perl attempts to find and execute "cmd.exe"
       within the operating system. However, due to path search order issues, Perl initially looks for cmd.exe
       in the current working directory.

       An attacker with limited privileges can exploit this behavior by placing "cmd.exe" in locations with weak
       permissions, such as "C:\ProgramData". By doing so, when an administrator attempts to use this executable
       from these compromised locations, arbitrary code can be executed.

</pre><h4><b>Incompatible</b> <b>Changes</b></h4><pre>
   <b>reset</b> <b>EXPR</b> <b>now</b> <b>calls</b> <b>set-magic</b> <b>on</b> <b>scalars</b>
       Previously "reset EXPR" did not call set magic when clearing scalar variables.  This meant that changes
       did not propagate to the underlying internal state where needed, such as for $^W, and did not result in
       an exception where the underlying magic would normally throw an exception, such as for $1.

       This means code that had no effect before may now actually have an effect, including possibly throwing an
       exception.

       "reset EXPR" already called set magic when modifying arrays and hashes.

       This has no effect on plain "reset" used to reset one-match searches as with "m?pattern?".

       [GH #20763 &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/20763&gt;]

   <b>Calling</b> <b>the</b> <b>import</b> <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>unknown</b> <b>package</b> <b>produces</b> <b>a</b> <b>warning</b>
       Historically, it has been possible to call the "import" or "unimport" method of any class, including ones
       which have not been defined, with an argument and not experience an error.  For instance, this code will
       not throw an error in Perl 5.38:

           Class::That::Does::Not::Exist-&gt;import("foo");

       However, as of Perl 5.39.1 this is deprecated and will issue a warning. Note that calling these methods
       with no arguments continues to silently succeed and do nothing. For instance,

           Class::That::Does::Not::Exist-&gt;import();

       will continue to not throw an error.  This is because every class implicitly inherits from the class
       UNIVERSAL which now defines an "import" method.  In older perls there was no such method defined, and
       instead the method calls for "import" and "unimport" were special cased to not throw errors if there was
       no such method defined.

       This change has been added because it makes it easier to detect case typos in "use" statements when
       running on case-insensitive file systems.  For instance, on Windows or other platforms with case-
       insensitive file systems on older perls the following code

           use STRICT 'refs';

       would silently do nothing as the module is actually called <u>strict.pm</u>, not <u>STRICT.pm</u>, so it would be
       loaded but its import method would never be called.  It will also detect cases where a user passes an
       argument when using a package that does not provide its own import, for instance most "pure" class
       definitions do not define an import method.

   <b>"return"</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>allows</b> <b>an</b> <b>indirect</b> <b>object</b>
       The "return" operator syntax now rejects indirect objects.  In most cases this would compile and even
       run, but wasn't documented and could produce confusing results, for example:

           # note that sum hasn't been defined
           sub sum_positive {
               return sum grep $_ &gt; 0, @_;
               # unexpectedly parsed as:
               #   return *sum, grep $_ &gt; 0, @_;
               # ... with the bareword acting like an extra (typeglob) argument
           }
           say for sum_positive(-1, 2, 3)

       produced:

           *main::sum
           2
           3

       [GH #21716 &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/21716&gt;]

   <b>Class</b> <b>barewords</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>resolved</b> <b>as</b> <b>file</b> <b>handles</b> <b>in</b> <b>method</b> <b>calls</b> <b>under</b> <b>"no</b> <b>feature</b> <b>"bareword_filehandles""</b>
       Under "no feature "bareword_filehandles"" bareword file handles continued to be resolved in method calls:

           open FH, "&lt;", $somefile or die;
           no feature 'bareword_filehandles';
           FH-&gt;binmode;

       This has been fixed, so the:

           FH-&gt;binmode;

       will attempt to resolve "FH" as a class, typically resulting in a runtime error.

       The standard file handles such as "STDOUT" continue to be resolved as a handle:

           no feature 'bareword_filehandles';
           STDOUT-&gt;flush; # continues to work

       Note that once perl resolves a bareword name as a class it will continue to do so:

           package SomeClass {
               sub somemethod{}
           }
           open SomeClass, "&lt;", "somefile" or die;
           # SomeClass resolved as a handle
           SomeClass-&gt;binmode;
           {
               no feature "bareword_filehandles";
               SomeClass-&gt;somemethod;
           }
           # SomeClass resolved as a class
           SomeClass-&gt;binmode;

</pre><h4><b>Documentation</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Changes</b> <b>to</b> <b>Existing</b> <b>Documentation</b>
       We  have  attempted  to  update the documentation to reflect the changes listed in this document.  If you
       find any we have missed, open an issue at &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues&gt;.

       Additionally, the following selected changes have been made:

       <u>perlapi</u>

       •   Corrected the documentation for "Perl_form", "form_nocontext", and "vform", which  claimed  that  any
           later  call  to  one of them will destroy the previous returns from any.  This hasn't been true since
           5.6.0, except it does remain true if these are called during global destruction.  With  that  caveat,
           the  return  of  each of these is a fresh string in a temporary that will automatically be freed by a
           call to ""FREETMPS"" in perlapi or at at places such as statement boundaries.

       •   Several internal functions now have documentation - the various  "newSUB"  functions,  newANONLIST(),
           newANONHASH(), newSVREF() and similar.

       <u>perlclass</u>

       •   Added a list of known bugs in the experimental "class" feature.

       <u>perlfunc</u>

       •   The  documentation  for  "local",  "my", "our", and "state", has been updated to include examples and
           descriptions of their effects within a statement.

       <u>perlguts</u>

       •   A new section has been added which describes the experimental reference-counted argument stack  build
           option ("PERL_RC_STACK").

       <u>perlclib</u>

       •   Extensive  guidance  has  been added for interfacing with the standard C library, including many more
           functions to avoid, and how to cope with locales and threads.

       <u>perlhacktips</u>

       •   Document we can't use compound literals or array designators due to C++  compatibility.   [GH  #21073
           &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/21073&gt;]

       •   Document  new  functions  sv_mark_arenas()  and  sv_sweep_arenas()  (which  only exist on "DEBUGGING"
           builds)

       •   Added brief documentation for some tools useful when developing perl itself on Windows or Cygwin.

       <u>perllol</u>

       •   Removed indirect object syntax in "Dumpvalue" example

       <u>perlre</u>

       •   Removed statement suggesting "/p" is a no-op.

       <u>perlref</u>

       •   Documented ref assignment in list context (as part of the "refaliasing" feature)

       <u>perlop</u>

       •   The section on the empty pattern "//" has been amended to mention that the current dynamic  scope  is
           used to find the last successful match.

       <u>perlport</u>

       •   The "-S" file test has been meaningful on Win32 since 5.37.6

       •   The "-l" file test is now meaningful on Win32

       •   Some strange behaviour with "." at the end of names under Windows has been documented

       <u>perlvar</u>

       •   Added documentation for an alternative to "${^CAPTURE}"

</pre><h4><b>Diagnostics</b></h4><pre>
       The  following  additions  or  changes  have been made to diagnostic output, including warnings and fatal
       error messages.  For the complete list of diagnostic messages, see perldiag.

   <b>New</b> <b>Diagnostics</b>
       <u>New</u> <u>Errors</u>

       •   Cannot use __CLASS__ outside of a method or field initializer expression

           (F) A "__CLASS__" expression yields the class name of  the  object  instance  executing  the  current
           method,  and therefore it can only be placed inside an actual method (or method-like expression, such
           as a field initializer expression).

       •   get_layers: unknown argument '%s'

           (F) You called <b>PerlIO::get_layers()</b> with  an  unknown  argument.  Legal  arguments  are  provided  in
           key/value pairs, with the keys being one of "input", "output" or "detail", followed by a boolean.

       •   UNIVERSAL does not export anything

           (F)  You  asked  UNIVERSAL  to  export something, but UNIVERSAL is the base class for all classes and
           contains no exportable symbols.

       •   Builtin version bundle "%s" is not supported by Perl

           (F) You attempted to "use builtin :ver" for a version number that is either older than 5.39 (when the
           ability was added), or newer than the current perl version.

       •   Invalid version bundle "%s"

           (F) A version number that is used to specify an import bundle during a "use  builtin  ..."  statement
           must  be  formatted  as  ":MAJOR.MINOR"  with  an  optional  third component, which is ignored.  Each
           component must be a number of 1 to 3 digits. No other characters are permitted.  The value  that  was
           specified does not conform to these rules.

       •   Missing comma after first argument to return

           (F)  While  certain  operators  allow  you to specify a filehandle or an "indirect object" before the
           argument list, "return" isn't one of them.

       •   Out of memory during vec in lvalue context

           (F) An attempt was made to extend a string beyond the largest possible memory allocation by assigning
           to vec() called with a large second argument.

           (This case used to throw a generic "Out of memory!" error.)

       •   Cannot create an object of incomplete class "%s"

           (F) An attempt was made to create an object of a class where the start of the  class  definition  has
           been seen, but the class has not been completed.

           This  can  happen for a failed eval, or if you attempt to create an object at compile time before the
           class is complete:

             eval "class Foo {"; Foo-&gt;new; # error
             class Bar { BEGIN { Bar-&gt;new } }; # error

           Previously perl would assert or crash. [GH #22159 &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/22159&gt;]

       <u>New</u> <u>Warnings</u>

       •   Forked open '%s' not meaningful in &lt;&gt;

           (S inplace) You had "|-" or "-|" in @ARGV and tried to use "&lt;&gt;" to read from it.

           Previously   this   would   fork   and   produce   a   confusing   error    message.    [GH    #21176
           &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/21176&gt;]

       •   Attempt  to  call undefined %s method with arguments ("%s"%s) via package "%s" (Perhaps you forgot to
           load the package?)

           (D deprecated::missing_import_called_with_args) You called the import() or  unimport()  method  of  a
           class  that  has  no  import  method  defined in its inheritance graph, and passed an argument to the
           method.  This is very often the sign of a misspelled package name in a use or require statement  that
           has silently succeeded due to a case insensitive file system.

           Another  common  reason  this may happen is when mistakenly attempting to import or unimport a symbol
           from a class definition or package which does not use "Exporter" or otherwise define its own "import"
           or "unimport" method.

   <b>Changes</b> <b>to</b> <b>Existing</b> <b>Diagnostics</b>
       •   Name "%s::%s" used only once: possible typo

           This     warning     now      honors      being      marked      as      fatal.       [GH      #13814
           &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/13814&gt;]

       •   Out of memory in perl:%s

           There  used to be several places in the perl core that would print a generic "Out of memory!" message
           and abort when memory allocation failed, giving no indication which program it was that  ran  out  of
           memory.   These  have been modified to include the word "perl" and the general area of the allocation
           failure,    e.g.     "Out     of     memory     in     perl:util:safesysrealloc".      [GH     #21672
           &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/21672&gt;]

       •   Possible precedence issue with control flow operator (%s)

           This  warning  now mentions the name of the control flow operator that triggered the diagnostic (e.g.
           "return", "exit", "die", etc).

           It also covers more cases: Previously, the warning was only triggered  if  a  low-precedence  logical
           operator (like "and", "or", "xor") was involved.  Now it is also shown for misleading code like this:

               exit $x ? 0 : 1;  # actually parses as: exit($x) ? 0 : 1;
               exit $x == 0;     # actually parses as: exit($x) == 0;

       •   Use of uninitialized value%s

           This warning is now slightly more accurate in cases involving "length", "pop", "shift", or "splice":

               my $x;
               length($x) == 0
               # Before:
               #  Use of uninitialized value $x in numeric eq (==) at ...
               # Now:
               #  Use of uninitialized value length($x) in numeric eq (==) at ...

           That  is,  the  warning  no  longer implies that $x was used directly as an operand of "==", which it
           wasn't.

           Similarly:

               my @xs;
               shift @xs == 0
               # Before:
               #  Use of uninitialized value within @xs in numeric eq (==) at ...
               # Now:
               #  Use of uninitialized value shift(@xs) in numeric eq (==) at ...

           This is more accurate because there never was an "undef" within @xs  as  the  warning  implied.  (The
           warning for "pop" works analogously.)

           Finally:

               my @xs = (1, 2, 3);
               splice(@xs, 0, 0) == 0
               # Before:
               #  Use of uninitialized value within @xs in numeric eq (==) at ...
               # Now:
               #  Use of uninitialized value in numeric eq (==) at ...

           That  is,  in  cases  where  "splice"  returns "undef", it no longer unconditionally blames its first
           argument. This was misleading because "splice" can return "undef"  even  if  none  of  its  arguments
           contain "undef".

           remains the same.  [GH #16607 &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/16607&gt;]

</pre><h4><b>Testing</b></h4><pre>
       Tests  were  added  and changed to reflect the other additions and changes in this release.  Furthermore,
       these significant changes were made:

       •   Update <u>nm</u> output parsing for Darwin in <u>t/porting/libperl.t</u> to handle changes in the output of  nm  on
           Darwin.  [GH #21117 &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/21117&gt;]

       •   <u>t/op/magic.t</u> would fail when "ps" was the BusyBox implementation, since that doesn't support the "-p"
           flag  and  otherwise  ignores a process id on the command-line.  This caused <u>TEST</u> failures on BusyBox
           systems such as Alpine Linux.  [GH #17542 &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/17542&gt;]

       •   <u>porting/globvar.t</u> now uses the more portable "nm -P ..." to fetch the  names  defined  in  an  object
           file.   The  parsing of the names found in the object is now separated from processing them to handle
           the   duplication    between    local    and    global    definitions    on    AIX.     [GH    #21637
           &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/21637&gt;]

       •   A test was added to <u>lib/locale_threads.t</u> that extensively stress tests locale handling.  It turns out
           that  the  libc  implementations  on  various  platforms  have  bugs in this regard, including Linux,
           Windows, *BSD derivatives including Darwin, and others.  Experimental versions of this test have been
           used in the past few years to find bugs in the Perl implementation and in those platforms, as well as
           to develop workarounds in the Perl implementation, where feasible, for the platform  bugs.   Multiple
           bug report tickets have been filed against platforms, and some have been fixed.  The test checks that
           platforms  that  purport  to  support thread-safe locale handling actually do so (and that perl works
           properly on those that do;  The read-only variable "${^SAFE_LOCALES}" is set to 1 if perl thinks  the
           platform can handle this, whatever the platform's documentation says).

           Also  tested  for  is  if  the various locale categories can indeed be set independently to disparate
           locales.  (An example of where you might want to do this is if you are a Western Canadian living  and
           working  in  Holland.   You likely will want to have the "LC_MONETARY" locale be set to where you are
           living, but have the other parts of your locale retain your native English values.  Later, as you get
           a bit more comfortable with Dutch, and in order to communicate better with your colleagues, you might
           want to change "LC_TIME" and "LC_NUMERIC" to Dutch, while leaving "LC_CTYPE" and "LC_COLLATE" set  to
           English indefinitely.)

       •   The test <u>t/porting/libperl.t</u> will no longer run in maint releases.  This test is sensitive to changes
           in  the  output  of  <u>nm</u>  on  various platforms, and tarballs aren't updated as we update this test in
           blead.  [GH #21677 &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/21677&gt;]

           &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/21535&gt;]

</pre><h4><b>Internal</b> <b>Changes</b></h4><pre>
       •   "PERL_RC_STACK" build option added.

           This new build option is highly experimental and is not enabled by default. Perl can be built with it
           by using the <u>Configure</u> option "-Accflags='-DPERL_RC_STACK'".

           It  makes the argument stack bump the reference count of SVs pushed onto it. It is mostly functional,
           but currently slow and incomplete.

           It is intended in the long term that this build option will  become  the  default  option,  and  then
           finally the only option; but this will be many releases away.

           In  particular,  there  is currently no support within XS code for using these new features. So under
           this build option, all XS functions are called via a backwards-compatibility wrapper which slows down
           such calls.

           In future releases, better support for XS code  is  intended  to  be  added.   It  is  expected  that
           straightforward  XS  code  will  eventually  be able to make use of a reference-counted stack without
           modification, with any heavy lifting being handled by the XS compiler ("xsubpp") and the macros which
           it outputs. But code which implements <b>PP()</b> functions will eventually have to be modified to use a new
           PP API: <b>rpp_foo()</b> rather than <b>PUSHs()</b> etc. But this new API is not yet stable, nor has  it  yet  been
           back-ported via "Devel::PPPort".

           See perlguts for more details.

       •   A  new  API  function  has  been  added  that  simplifies C (or XS) code that creates "LISTOP" optree
           fragments.  newLISTOPn() is a variadic function that takes  a  "NULL"-terminated  list  of  child  op
           pointers, and constructs a new checked "LISTOP" to contain them all.  This is simpler than creating a
           new  plain  "OP_LIST",  adding each child individually, and finally calling op_convert_list() in most
           code fragments.

       •   The eval_sv() API now accepts the "G_USEHINTS" flag, which uses the hints such as strict and features
           from "PL_curcop" instead of the default, which is to use default hints,  e.g.  no  "use  vX.XX;",  no
           strict, default features.

           Beware  if you use this flag in XS code: your evaluated code will need to support whatever strictness
           or features are in effect at the point your XS function is called.

           [GH #21415 &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/21415&gt;]

       •   "PERL_VERSION_LE" has been fixed to properly check for "less than or equal" rather than "less than".

       •   "dAX", "dITEMS" and hence "dXSARGS" now  declare  "AX"  and  "items"  as  "Stack_off_t"  rather  than
           "SSize_t".   This  reverts  back to compatibility with pre-64-bit stack support for default builds of
           perl where "Stack_off_t" is "I32".  [GH #21782 &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/21782&gt;]

       •   A new function is now available to "XS" code, "sv_langinfo"  in  perlapi.   This  provides  the  same
           information  as the existing "Perl_langinfo8" in perlapi, but returns an SV instead of a "char *", so
           that programmers don't have to concern themselves  with  the  UTF-8ness  of  the  result.   This  new
           function  is  now  the preferred interface for "XS" code to the <b><a href="../man3/nl_langinfo.3.html">nl_langinfo</a></b>(3) "libc" function.  From
           Perl space, this information continues to be provided by the I18N::Langinfo module.

       •   glibc has an undocumented equivalent function to <b>querylocale()</b>, which  our  experience  indicates  is
           reliable.  When this is function is used, it removes the need for perl to keep its own records, hence
           is more efficient and guaranteed to be accurate. Use of this function can be disabled by defining the
           "NO_NL_LOCALE_NAME" build option

</pre><h4><b>Selected</b> <b>Bug</b> <b>Fixes</b></h4><pre>
       •   The delimiter "SYRIAC COLON SKEWED LEFT/RIGHT" pair has been removed from the ones recognized by  the
           "extra_paired_delimiters"  feature.   (See  "Quote  and  Quote-like  Operators"  in perlop.)  This is
           because those characters are normally written right-to-left, and this could be visually confusing [GH
           #22228 &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/22228&gt;].  The change was actually to forbid  any  right-
           to-left delimiters, but this pair is the only current instance that meets this criterion.  By policy,
           this change means that the "extra_paired_delimiters" feature cannot be considered to have been stable
           long enough for its experimental status to be removed.

       •   "use 5.36;" or later didn't enable the post parse reporting of Name "%s::%s" used only once: possible
           typo warnings when enabling warnings.  [GH #21271 &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/21271&gt;]

       •   Fix  a crash or assertion when cleaning up a closure that refers to an outside "our" sub.  [GH #21067
           &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/21067&gt;]

       •   Fixed a number of issues where "I32" was used as a string offset or size  rather  than  "SSize_t"  or
           "STRLEN"/"size_t" [GH #21012 &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/21012&gt;]

       •   "~$str" when $str was more than 2GB in size would do nothing or produce an incomplete result.

       •   String  repeat,  "$str  x  $count", didn't handle $str over 2GB in size, throwing an error.  Now such
           strings are repeated.

       •   Complex substitution after the 2GB point in a string could access incorrect or invalid offsets in the
           string.

       •   <b>sv_utf8_decode()</b> would truncate the SVs <b>pos()</b> value.  This wasn't visible via <b>utf8::decode()</b>.

       •   When compiling a constant folded hash key, the length was truncated  when  creating  the  shared  SV.
           Since hash keys over 2GB are not supported, throw a compilation error instead.

       •   <b>msgrcv()</b>  incorrectly  called  get magic on the buffer SV and failed to call set magic on completion.
           [GH #21012 &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/21012&gt;]

       •   <b>msgrcv()</b>  used  the  size  parameter  to  resize  the  buffer  before  validating  it.   [GH   #21012
           &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/21012&gt;]

       •   Inheriting  from  a  class  that  was  hierarchically  an ancestor of the new class, eg. " class A::B
           :isa(A)   {   ...   }   ",   would   not   attempt   to   load   the   parent   class.   [GH   #21332
           &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/21332&gt;]

       •   Declared    references    can    now    be    used    with    "state"    variables.     [GH    #21351
           &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/21351&gt;]

       •   Trailing elements in an "unshift"ed and resized array will now  always  be  initialized.  [GH  #21265
           &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/21265&gt;]

       •   Make "use 5.036" respect the -X flag

           perl's  -X  flag  disables  all warnings globally, but «use 5.036» didn't respect that until now. [GH
           #21431 &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/21431&gt;]

       •   Fixed an OP leak when  an  error  was  produced  for  initializer  for  a  class  field.  [GH  #20812
           &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/20812&gt;]

       •   Fixed a leak of the return value when smartmatching against a code reference.

       •   Fixed   a   slowdown   in  repeated  substitution  replacements  using  special  variables,  such  as
           "s/....x$1/g". It actually makes all string concatenations  involving  such  "magic"  variables  less
           slow,  but  the slowdown was more noticeable on repeated substitutions due to extra memory usage that
           was only freed after the last iteration. The slowdown started in perl 5.28.0 - which  generally  sped
           up   string   concatenation   but   slowed   down   when   using   special   variables.   [GH  #21360
           &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/21360&gt;]

       •   Lexical names from the enclosing scope in a lexical sub or closure weren't visible to  code  executed
           by  calling "eval EXPR;" from the "DB" package.  This was introduced in 5.18 in an attempt to prevent
           subs from retaining a reference to their outer scope, but this broke the special behaviour  of  "eval
           EXPR;" in package DB.

           This     incidentally     fixed     a     TODO     test     for     "B::Deparse".      [GH     #19370
           &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/pull/19370&gt;]

       •   Optionally support an argument stack over 2**32 entries on 64-bit platforms.  This requires  32GB  of
           memory  just  for the argument stack pointers itself, so you will require a significantly more memory
           to take advantage of this.

           To enable this add "-Accflags=-DPERL_STACK_OFFSET_SSIZET" or equivalent to the  "Configure"  command-
           line.

           [GH          #20917          &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/20917&gt;]         [GH         #21523
           &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/21523&gt;]

       •   Fixed  various  problems  with  <b>join()</b>  where  modifications  to  the  separator  could  be   handled
           inconsistently,  or could access released memory.  Changes to the separator from magic or overloading
           for values in the "LIST" no longer have an  effect  on  the  resulting  joined  string.   [GH  #21458
           &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/21458&gt;]

       •   Don't  clear  the integer flag "IOK" from lines in the "@{"_&lt;$sourcefile"}" array when a "dbstate" op
           is    removed    for    that    line.     This    was    broken    when     fixing     [GH     #19198
           &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/19198&gt;].                        [GH                      #21564
           &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/21564&gt;]

       •   Many bug fixes have been made for using locales under threads and in embedded perls.  And workarounds
           for libc bugs have been added.  As a result thread-safe locale handling  is  now  the  default  under
           OpenBSD, and MingW when compiled with UCRT.

           However,  testing has shown that Darwin's implementation of thread-safe locale handling has bugs.  So
           now Perl doesn't attempt to use the thread-safe operations when compiled on Darwin.

           As before, you can check to see if your program is running with thread-safe locales  by  checking  if
           the value of "${^SAFE_LOCALES}" is 1.

       •   Various  bugs  have  been  fixed  when perl is configured with "-Accflags=-DNO_LOCALE_NUMERIC" or any
           other locale category (or categories).

       •   Not all locale categories need be set to the same locale.  Perl now works around  bugs  in  the  libc
           implementations of locale handling on some platforms that previously could result in mojibake.

       •   "LC_ALL" is represented in one of two ways when not all locale categories are set to the same locale.
           On  some  platforms,  such  as  Linux  and  Windows, the representation is of the form of a series of
           'category=locale-name' pairs.  On other platforms, such as *BSD,  the  representation  is  positional
           like  "<u>name1</u> / <u>name2</u> / ... ".   <u>name1</u> is always for a particular category as defined by the platform,
           as are the other names.  The sequence that separates the names  (the  " / "  above)  also  varies  by
           platform.   Previously,  perl had problems with platforms that used the positional notation.  This is
           now fixed.

       •   A bug has been fixed in the regexp engine with an optimisation that applies  to  the  "+"  quantifier
           where it was followed by a "(*SKIP)" pattern.

           [GH #21534 &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/21534&gt;]

       •   The  tmps  (mortal) stack now grows exponentially.  Previously it grew linearly, so if it was growing
           incrementally, such as through many calls to <b>sv_2mortal()</b>, on a system where  <b>realloc()</b>  is  O(size),
           the  performance would be O(n*n).  With exponential grows this changes to amortized O(n).  [GH #21654
           &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/21654&gt;]

       •   Lexical subs now have a new stub in the pad for each recursive call  into  the  containing  function.
           This fixes two problems:

           •   If  the lexical sub called the containing function, a "Can't undef active subroutine" error would
               be thrown.  For example:

                   use v5.36.0;
                   sub outer($oc) {
                       my sub inner ($c) {
                            outer($c-1) if $c; # Can't undef active subroutine
                       }
                       inner($oc);
                   }
                   <a href="../man2/outer.2.html">outer</a>(2);

               [GH #18606 &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/18606&gt;]

           •   If the lexical sub was called from a recursive call into  the  containing  function,  this  would
               overwrite the bindings to the closed over variables in the lexical sub, so calls into the lexical
               sub  from  the  outer  recursive call would have access to the variables from the inner recursive
               call:

                   use v5.36.0;
                   sub outer ($x) {
                       my sub inner ($label) {
                           say "$label $x";
                       }
                       inner("first");
                       outer("inner") if $x eq "outer";
                       # this call to inner() sees the wrong $x
                       inner("second");
                   }
                   outer("outer");

               [GH #21987 &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/21987&gt;]

       •   <b>prepare_export_lexical()</b> was separately saving "PL_comppad" and "PL_curpad",  this  could  result  in
           "PL_curpad"  being  restored to a no longer valid value, resulting in a panic when importing lexicals
           in some cases.  [GH #21981 &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/21981&gt;]

       •   A string <b>eval()</b> operation in the scope of a "use VERSION" declaration would sometimes  emit  spurious
           "Downgrading  a  use  VERSION  declaration"  warnings  due to an inconsistency in the way the version
           number was stored.  This is now fixed.  [GH #22121 &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/22121&gt;]
