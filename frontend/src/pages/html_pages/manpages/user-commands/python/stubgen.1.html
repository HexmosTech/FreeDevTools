       stubgen - Generate draft type hint stubs for Python modules

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>stubgen</b> [-h] [-py2] [-m <u>MODULE</u>] [-p <u>PACKAGE</u>] [<u>OPTIONS</u>...] [<u>FILES</u>...]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Mypy  is  a  static  type  checker  for  Python 3 and Python 2.7. Mypy includes the <u>stubgen</u> tool that can
       automatically generate stub files (<u>.pyi</u> files) for Python modules and C extension modules.

       A stub file (see PEP 484) contains only type hints for the public  interface  of  a  module,  with  empty
       function  bodies. Mypy can use a stub file instead of the real implementation to provide type information
       for the module. They are useful for third-party modules whose authors have not yet added type hints  (and
       when no stubs are available in typeshed) and C extension modules (which mypy canâ€™t directly process).

       Stubgen  generates <u>draft</u> stubs. The auto-generated stub files often require some manual updates, and most
       types will default to <u>Any</u>. The stubs will be much more useful if you add more precise  type  annotations,
       at least for the most commonly used functionality.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>NOTE:</b>
          The command-line flags may change between releases.

   <b>Specifying</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>stub</b>
       You can give stubgen paths of the source files for which you want to generate stubs:

          $ stubgen foo.py bar.py

       This generates stubs <b>out/foo.pyi</b> and <b>out/bar.pyi</b>. The default output directory <b>out</b> can be overridden with
       <u>-o</u> <u>DIR</u>.

       You  can  also  pass directories, and stubgen will recursively search them for any <b>.py</b> files and generate
       stubs for all of them:

          $ stubgen my_pkg_dir

       Alternatively, you can give module or package names using the <u>-m</u> or <u>-p</u> options:

          $ stubgen -m foo -m bar -p my_pkg_dir

       Details of the options:

       <b>-m</b> <b>MODULE,</b> <b>--module</b> <b>MODULE</b>
              Generate a stub file for the given module. This flag may be repeated multiple times.

              Stubgen <u>will</u> <u>not</u> recursively generate stubs for any submodules of the provided module.

       <b>-p</b> <b>PACKAGE,</b> <b>--package</b> <b>PACKAGE</b>
              Generate stubs for the given package. This flag maybe repeated multiple times.

              Stubgen <u>will</u> recursively generate stubs for all submodules of the provided package. This  flag  is
              identical to <u>--module</u> apart from this behavior.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          You can't mix paths and <u>-m</u>/<u>-p</u> options in the same stubgen invocation.

       Stubgen  applies  heuristics  to  avoid  generating  stubs  for submodules that include tests or vendored
       third-party packages.

   <b>Specifying</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>generate</b> <b>stubs</b>
       By default stubgen will try to import the target modules  and  packages.   This  allows  stubgen  to  use
       runtime  introspection  to  generate  stubs  for  C  extension  modules and to improve the quality of the
       generated stubs. By default, stubgen will also use mypy to perform light-weight semantic analysis of  any
       Python modules. Use the following flags to alter the default behavior:

       <b>--no-import</b>
              Don't try to import modules. Instead only use mypy's normal search mechanism to find sources. This
              does not support C extension modules. This flag also disables runtime introspection functionality,
              which  mypy  uses  to  find  the value of <b>__all__</b>. As result the set of exported imported names in
              stubs may be incomplete. This flag is  generally  only  useful  when  importing  a  module  causes
              unwanted  side  effects,  such  as  the  running of tests. Stubgen tries to skip test modules even
              without this option, but this does not always work.

       <b>--no-analysis</b>
              Don't perform semantic analysis of source files. This may generate worse stubs --  in  particular,
              some  module,  class, and function aliases may be represented as variables with the <b>Any</b> type. This
              is generally only useful if semantic analysis causes a critical mypy error.  Does not apply  to  C
              extension modules.  Incompatible with <u>--inspect-mode</u>.

       <b>--inspect-mode</b>
              Import  and  inspect  modules  instead  of parsing source code. This is the default behavior for C
              modules and pyc-only packages.  The flag is useful to force inspection  for  pure  Python  modules
              that  make  use  of  dynamically  generated members that would otherwise be omitted when using the
              default behavior of code parsing.  Implies <u>--no-analysis</u> as analysis requires source code.

       <b>--doc-dir</b> <b>PATH</b>
              Try to infer better signatures by parsing .rst documentation in <b>PATH</b>.  This may result  in  better
              stubs, but currently it only works for C extension modules.

   <b>Additional</b> <b>flags</b>
       <b>-h,</b> <b>--help</b>
              Show help message and exit.

       <b>--ignore-errors</b>
              If  an  exception  was  raised  during  stub generation, continue to process any remaining modules
              instead of immediately failing with an error.

       <b>--include-private</b>
              Include definitions that are considered private in stubs (with names  such  as  <b>_foo</b>  with  single
              leading underscore and no trailing underscores).

       <b>--export-less</b>
              Don't  export all names imported from other modules within the same package.  Instead, only export
              imported names that are not referenced in the module that contains the import.

       <b>--include-docstrings</b>
              Include docstrings in stubs. This will add docstrings to Python function and classes stubs and  to
              C extension function stubs.

       <b>--search-path</b> <b>PATH</b>
              Specify module search directories, separated by colons (only used if <u>--no-import</u> is given).

       <b>-o</b> <b>PATH,</b> <b>--output</b> <b>PATH</b>
              Change  the  output directory. By default the stubs are written in the <b>./out</b> directory. The output
              directory will be created if it doesn't exist. Existing stubs in  the  output  directory  will  be
              overwritten without warning.

       <b>-v,</b> <b>--verbose</b>
              Produce more verbose output.

       <b>-q,</b> <b>--quiet</b>
              Produce less verbose output.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>MYPYPATH</b>
              Additional  module  search  path entries. The format is the same as the shell's <u>$PATH</u>: one or more
              directory pathnames separated by colons.
