       perlbs2000 - building and installing Perl for BS2000.

       This document needs to be updated, but we don't know what it should say.  Please submit comments to
       &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues&gt;.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       This document will help you Configure, build, test and install Perl on BS2000 in the POSIX subsystem.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This is a ported perl for the POSIX subsystem in BS2000 VERSION OSD V3.1A or later.  It may work on other
       versions, but we started porting and testing it with 3.1A and are currently using Version V4.0A.

       You may need the following GNU programs in order to install perl:

   <b>gzip</b> <b>on</b> <b>BS2000</b>
       We used version 1.2.4, which could be installed out of the box with one failure during 'make check'.

   <b>bison</b> <b>on</b> <b>BS2000</b>
       The yacc coming with BS2000 POSIX didn't work for us.  So we had to use bison.  We had to make a few
       changes to perl in order to use the pure (reentrant) parser of bison.  We used version 1.25, but we had
       to add a few changes due to EBCDIC.  See below for more details concerning yacc.

   <b>Unpacking</b> <b>Perl</b> <b>Distribution</b> <b>on</b> <b>BS2000</b>
       To extract an ASCII tar archive on BS2000 POSIX you need an ASCII filesystem (we used the mountpoint
       /usr/local/ascii for this).  Now you extract the archive in the ASCII filesystem without I/O-conversion:

       cd /usr/local/ascii export IO_CONVERSION=NO gunzip &lt; /usr/local/src/perl.tar.gz | pax -r

       You may ignore the error message for the first element of the archive (this doesn't look like a tar
       archive / skipping to next file...), it's only the directory which will be created automatically anyway.

       After extracting the archive you copy the whole directory tree to your EBCDIC filesystem.  <b>This</b> <b>time</b> <b>you</b>
       <b>use</b> <b>I/O-conversion</b>:

       cd <a href="file:/usr/local/src">/usr/local/src</a> IO_CONVERSION=YES cp -r /usr/local/ascii/perl5.005_02 ./

   <b>Compiling</b> <b>Perl</b> <b>on</b> <b>BS2000</b>
       There is a "hints" file for BS2000 called hints.posix-bc (because posix-bc is the OS name given by
       `uname`) that specifies the correct values for most things.  The major problem is (of course) the EBCDIC
       character set.  We have german EBCDIC version.

       Because of our problems with the native yacc we used GNU bison to generate a pure (=reentrant) parser for
       perly.y.  So our yacc is really the following script:

       -----8&lt;-----/usr/local/bin/yacc-----8&lt;----- #! <a href="file:///usr/lib/w3m/cgi-bin/w3mman2html.cgi?sh">/usr/bin/sh</a>

       # Bison as a reentrant yacc:

       # save parameters: params="" while [[ $# -gt 1 ]]; do
           params="$params $1"
           shift done

       # add flag %pure_parser:

       tmpfile=/tmp/bison.$$.y echo %pure_parser &gt; $tmpfile cat $1 &gt;&gt; $tmpfile

       # call bison:

       echo "/usr/local/bin/bison --yacc $params $1\t\t\t(Pure Parser)" /usr/local/bin/bison --yacc $params
       $tmpfile

       # cleanup:

       rm -f $tmpfile -----8&lt;----------8&lt;-----

       We still use the normal yacc for a2p.y though!!!  We made a softlink called byacc to distinguish between
       the two versions:

       ln -s /usr/bin/yacc /usr/local/bin/byacc

       We build perl using GNU make.  We tried the native make once and it worked too.

   <b>Testing</b> <b>Perl</b> <b>on</b> <b>BS2000</b>
       We still got a few errors during "make test".  Some of them are the result of using bison.  Bison prints
       <u>parser</u> <u>error</u> instead of <u>syntax</u> <u>error</u>, so we may ignore them.  The following list shows our errors, your
       results may differ:

       op/numconvert.......FAILED tests 1409-1440 op/regexp...........FAILED tests 483, 496
       op/regexp_noamp.....FAILED tests 483, 496 pragma/overload.....FAILED tests 152-153, 170-171
       pragma/warnings.....FAILED tests 14, 82, 129, 155, 192, 205, 207 lib/bigfloat........FAILED tests
       351-352, 355 lib/bigfltpm........FAILED tests 354-355, 358 lib/complex.........FAILED tests 267, 487
       lib/dumper..........FAILED tests 43, 45 Failed 11/231 test scripts, 95.24% okay. 57/10595 subtests
       failed, 99.46% okay.

   <b>Installing</b> <b>Perl</b> <b>on</b> <b>BS2000</b>
       We have no nroff on BS2000 POSIX (yet), so we ignored any errors while installing the documentation.

   <b>Using</b> <b>Perl</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Posix-Shell</b> <b>of</b> <b>BS2000</b>
       BS2000 POSIX doesn't support the shebang notation ("#!/usr/local/bin/perl"), so you have to use the
       following lines instead:

       : # use perl
           eval 'exec /usr/local/bin/perl -S $0 ${1+"$@"}'
               if 0; # ^ Run only under a shell

   <b>Using</b> <b>Perl</b> <b>in</b> <b>"native"</b> <b>BS2000</b>
       We don't have much experience with this yet, but try the following:

       Copy your Perl executable to a BS2000 LLM using bs2cp:

       "bs2cp /usr/local/bin/perl 'bs2:perl(perl,l)'"

       Now you can start it with the following (SDF) command:

       "/START-PROG FROM-FILE=*MODULE(PERL,PERL),PROG-MODE=*ANY,RUN-MODE=*ADV"

       First you get the BS2000 commandline prompt ('*').  Here you may enter your parameters, e.g. "-e 'print
       "Hello World!\\n";'" (note the double backslash!) or "-w" and the name of your Perl script.  Filenames
       starting with "/" are searched in the Posix filesystem, others are searched in the BS2000 filesystem.
       You may even use wildcards if you put a "%" in front of your filename (e.g. "-w checkfiles.pl %*.c").
       Read your C/C++ manual for additional possibilities of the commandline prompt (look for PARAMETER-
       PROMPTING).

   <b>Floating</b> <b>point</b> <b>anomalies</b> <b>on</b> <b>BS2000</b>
       There appears to be a bug in the floating point implementation on BS2000 POSIX systems such that calling
       <b>int()</b> on the product of a number and a small magnitude number is not the same as calling <b>int()</b> on the
       quotient of that number and a large magnitude number.  For example, in the following Perl code:

           my $x = 100000.0;
           my $y = int($x * 1e-5) * 1e5; # '0'
           my $z = int($x / 1e+5) * 1e5;  # '100000'
           print "\$y is $y and \$z is $z\n"; # $y is 0 and $z is 100000

       Although one would expect the quantities $y and $z to be the same and equal to 100000 they will differ
       and instead will be 0 and 100000 respectively.

   <b>Using</b> <b>PerlIO</b> <b>and</b> <b>different</b> <b>encodings</b> <b>on</b> <b>ASCII</b> <b>and</b> <b>EBCDIC</b> <b>partitions</b>
       Since version 5.8 Perl uses the new PerlIO on BS2000.  This enables you using different encodings per IO
       channel.  For example you may use

           use Encode;
           open($f, "&gt;:encoding(ascii)", "test.ascii");
           print $f "Hello World!\n";
           open($f, "&gt;:encoding(posix-bc)", "test.ebcdic");
           print $f "Hello World!\n";
           open($f, "&gt;:encoding(latin1)", "test.latin1");
           print $f "Hello World!\n";
           open($f, "&gt;:encoding(utf8)", "test.utf8");
           print $f "Hello World!\n";

       to get two files containing "Hello World!\n" in ASCII, EBCDIC, ISO Latin-1 (in this example identical to
       ASCII) respective UTF-EBCDIC (in this example identical to normal EBCDIC).  See the documentation of
       Encode::PerlIO for details.

       As the PerlIO layer uses raw IO internally, all this totally ignores the type of your filesystem (ASCII
       or EBCDIC) and the IO_CONVERSION environment variable.  If you want to get the old behavior, that the
       BS2000 IO functions determine conversion depending on the filesystem PerlIO still is your friend.  You
       use IO_CONVERSION as usual and tell Perl, that it should use the native IO layer:

           export IO_CONVERSION=YES
           export PERLIO=stdio

       Now your IO would be ASCII on ASCII partitions and EBCDIC on EBCDIC partitions.  See the documentation of
       PerlIO (without "Encode::"!)  for further possibilities.
