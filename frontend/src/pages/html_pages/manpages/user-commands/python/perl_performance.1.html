       makepp_perl_performance -- How to make Perl faster

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The biggest tuning gains will usually come from algorithmic improvements.  But while these can be hard to
       find, there is also a lot you can do mechanically.

       Makepp is a big heavy-duty program, where speed is a must.  A lot of effort has been put into optimizing
       it.  This documents some general things we have found.  Currently the concrete tests leading to these
       results have mostly been discarded, but I plan to gradually add them.

       If you are looking at how to speedup makepp (beyond the Perl programming you put into your makefiles),
       look at makepp_speedup.  This page is completely independent of makepp, only intended to make our results
       available to the Perl community.  Some of these measures are common sence, but you sometimes forget them.
       Others need measuring to believe them, so:

   <b>Measure,</b> <b>don't</b> <b>guess</b>
       Profile your program
           Makepp  comes  with  a module <u>profiler.pm</u> in its cvs repository.  This is first run as a program on a
           copy(!) of your code, which it instruments.  Then you run your copy and get  configurable  statistics
           per  interval and a final total on the most frequently called functions and on the most time spent in
           functions (minus subcalls).  Both are provided absolutely and in caller-callee pairs.  (Documentation
           within.)

           This tells you which functions are the most promising candidates for tuning.  It  also  gives  you  a
           hint  where your algorithm might be wrong, either within surprisingly expensive functions, or through
           surprisingly frequent calls.

       Time your solution
           Either one of

               perl -Mstrict -MBenchmark -we 'my &lt;initialization&gt;; timethis -10, sub { &lt;code&gt; }'
               time perl -Mstrict -we 'my &lt;initialization&gt;; for( 0..999_999 ) { &lt;code&gt; }'

           when run on different variants of code you can think of, can give  surprising  results.   Even  small
           modifications  can  matter  a  lot.   Be  careful  not to "measure" code that can get optimized away,
           because you discard the result, or because it depends on constants.

           Depending on your system, this will tell you in kb how fat Perl got:

               perl -Mstrict -we '&lt;build huge data&gt;; system "ps -ovsz $$"'

           Below we only show the code within the "-e" option as one liners.

   <b>Regexps</b>
       Use simple regexps
           Several matches combined with "||" are faster than a big one with "|".

       Use precompiled regexps
           Instead of interpolating strings into regexps (except if the string will never change and you use the
           "o" modifier), precompile the regexp with "qr//" and interpolate that.

       Use (?:...)
           If you don't use what the grouping matches, don't make Perl save it with "(...)".

       Anchor at beginning of string
           Don't make Perl look through your whole string, if you want a match only at the beginning.

       Don't anchor at end after greedy
           If you have a "*" or "+" that will match till the end of string, don't put a "$" after it.

       Use tr///
           This is twice as fast as s/// when it is applicable.

   <b>Functions</b>
       Avoid object orientation
           Dynamic method lookup is slower in any language, and Perl, being loosely typed, can never  do  it  at
           compile  time.   Don't  use it, unless you need the benefit of polymorphism through inheritance.  The
           following call methods are ordered from slowest to fastest:

               $o-&gt;method( ... );          # searched in class of $o and its @ISA
               Class::method( $o, ... );   # static function, new stack
               Class::method $o, ...;      # static function, new stack, checked at compile time
               &amp;Class::method;             # static function, reuse stack

           This last form always possible if method (or normal function) takes no arguments.  If  it  does  take
           arguments,  watch  out that you don't inadvertently supply any optional ones!  If you use this form a
           lot, it is best to keep track of the minimum and maximum number of arguments each function can  take.
           Reusing a stack with extra arguments is no problem, they'll get ignored.

       Don't modify stack
           The following sin is frequently found even in the Perl doc:

               my $self = shift;

           Unless you have a pertinent reason for this, use this:

               my( $self, $x, $y, @z ) = @_;

       Use few functions and modules
           Every  function  (and  that alas includes constants) takes up over 1kb for it's mere existence.  With
           each module requiring other ones, most of which you never need, that can add up.  Don't pull in a big
           module, just to replace two lines of Perl code with a single more elegant looking function call.

           If you have a function only called in one place, and the  two  combined  would  still  be  reasonably
           short, merge them with due comments.

           Don't have one function only call another with the same arguments.  Alias it instead:

               *alias = \&amp;function;

       Group calls to print
           Individual  calls to print, or print with separate arguments are very expensive.  Build up the string
           in memory and print it in one go.  If you can accumulate over 3kb, syswrite is more efficient.

               perl -MBenchmark -we 'timethis -10, sub { print STDERR $_ for 1..5 }' 2&gt;/dev/null
               perl -MBenchmark -we 'timethis -10, sub { print STDERR 1..5 }' 2&gt;/dev/null
               perl -MBenchmark -we 'timethis -10, sub { my $str = ""; $str .= $_ for 1..5; print STDERR $str }' 2&gt;/dev/null

   <b>Miscellaneous</b>
       Avoid hashes
           Perl becomes quite slow with many small hashes.  If you don't need them, use something else.   Object
           orientation  works  just as well on an array, except that the members can't be accessed by name.  But
           you can use numeric constants to name the members.  For  the  sake  of  comparability  we  use  plain
           numeric keys here:

               my $i = 0; our %a = map +($i++, $_), "a".."j"; timethis -10, sub { $b = $a{int rand 10} }
                          our @a = "a".."j";                  timethis -10, sub { $b = $a[rand 10] }

               my $i = 0;  my %a = map +($i++, $_), "a".."j"; timethis -10, sub { $b = $a{int rand 10} }
                           my @a = "a".."j";                  timethis -10, sub { $b = $a[rand 10] }

       Use int keys for ref sets
           When you need a unique reference representation, e.g. for set ops with hashes, using the integer form
           of  refs  is  three times as fast as using the pretty printed default string representation.  Caveat:
           the HP/UX 64bitall variant of Perl, at least up to 5.8.8 has  a  buggy  "int"  function,  where  this
           doesn't  work  reliably.  There a hex form is still a fair bit faster than default strings.  Actually
           this can even be faster than stringified int, depending on the  version  or  maybe  configuration  of
           perl.  As of 5.8.1 there is also the equivalent but hopefully reliable Scalar::Util::refaddr

               my @list = map { bless { $_ =&gt; 1 }, "someclass" } 0..9; my( %a, %b );
                   timethis -10, sub { $a{$_} = 1 for @list };
                   timethis -10, sub { $b{int()} = 1 for @list };
                   timethis -10, sub { $b{sprintf '%x', $_} = 1 for @list };
                   timethis -10, sub { $b{refaddr $_} = 1 for @list };

           There  is  also  sprintf  '%p'  which supposedly outputs a pointer, but depending on which expression
           leads to the same ref, you get different values, so it's useless.

       Beware of strings
           Perl is awful for always copying strings around, even if you're never going  to  modify  them.   This
           wastes  CPU and memory.  Try to avoid that wherever reasonably possible.  If the string is a function
           parameter and the function has a modest length, don't copy the string into a "my" variable, access it
           with $_[0] and document the function well.  Elsewhere, the aliasing feature of "for(each)" can  help.
           Or  just  use references to strings, which are fast to copy.  If you somehow ensure that same strings
           get stored only once, you can do numerical comparison for equality.

       Avoid bit operations
           If you have disjoint bit patterns you can add them instead of or`ing them.  Shifting can be performed
           my multiplication or integer division.  Retaining only the lowest bits can be achieved with modulo.

           Separate boolean hash members are faster than stuffing everything into an integer with bit operations
           or into a string with "vec".

       Use order of boolean operations
           If you only care whether an expression is true  or  false,  check  the  cheap  things,  like  boolean
           variables, first, and call functions last.

       Use undef instead of 0
           It  takes up a few percent less memory, at least as hash or list values.  You can still query it as a
           boolean.

               my %x; $x{$_} = 0   for 0..999_999; system "ps -ovsz $$"
               my %x; undef $x{$_} for 0..999_999; system "ps -ovsz $$"

               my @x = (0) x 999_999;     system "ps -ovsz $$"
               my @x = (undef) x 999_999; system "ps -ovsz $$"

       Choose for or map
           These are definitely not equivalent.  Depending on your use (i.e. the list and the complexity of your
           code), one or the other may be faster.

               my @l = 0..99;
               for( 0..99_999 ) { map $a = " $_ ", @l }
               for( 0..99_999 ) { map $a = " $_ ", 0..99 }
               for( 0..99_999 ) { $a = " $_ " for @l }
               for( 0..99_999 ) { $a = " $_ " for 0..99 }

       Don't alias $_
           While it is convenient, it is rather expensive, even copying reasonable strings is faster.  The  last
           example is twice as fast as the first "for".

               my $x = "abcdefg"; my $b = 0;
               for( "$x" ) { $b = 1 - $b if /g/ } # Copy needed only if modifying.
               for( $x ) { $b = 1 - $b if /g/ }
               local *_ = \$x; $b = 1 - $b if /g/;
               local $_ = $x; $b = 1 - $b if /g/; # Copy cheaper than alias.
               my $y = $x; $b = 1 - $b if $y =~ /g/;
