</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       perltru64 - Perl version 5 on Tru64 (formerly known as Digital UNIX formerly known as DEC OSF/1) systems

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This document describes various features of HP's (formerly Compaq's, formerly Digital's) Unix operating
       system (Tru64) that will affect how Perl version 5 (hereafter just Perl) is configured, compiled and/or
       runs.

   <b>Compiling</b> <b>Perl</b> <b>5</b> <b>on</b> <b>Tru64</b>
       The recommended compiler to use in Tru64 is the native C compiler.  The native compiler produces much
       faster code (the speed difference is noticeable: several dozen percentages) and also more correct code:
       if you are considering using the GNU C compiler you should use at the very least the release of 2.95.3
       since all older gcc releases are known to produce broken code when compiling Perl.  One manifestation of
       this brokenness is the lib/sdbm test dumping core; another is many of the op/regexp and op/pat, or
       ext/Storable tests dumping core (the exact pattern of failures depending on the GCC release and
       optimization flags).

       Both the native cc and gcc seem to consume lots of memory when building Perl.  toke.c is a known trouble
       spot when optimizing: 256 megabytes of data section seems to be enough.  Another known trouble spot is
       the mktables script which builds the Unicode support tables.  The default setting of the process data
       section in Tru64 should be one gigabyte, but some sites/setups might have lowered that.  The
       configuration process of Perl checks for too low process limits, and lowers the optimization for the
       toke.c if necessary, and also gives advice on how to raise the process limits (for example: "ulimit -d
       262144")

       Also, Configure might abort with

        Build a threading Perl? [n]
        Configure[2437]: Syntax error at line 1 : 'config.sh' is not expected.

       This indicates that Configure is being run with a broken Korn shell (even though you think you are using
       a Bourne shell by using "sh Configure" or "./Configure").  The Korn shell bug has been reported to Compaq
       as of February 1999 but in the meanwhile, the reason ksh is being used is that you have the environment
       variable BIN_SH set to 'xpg4'.  This causes <a href="file:/bin/sh">/bin/sh</a> to delegate its duties to /bin/posix/sh (a ksh).
       Unset the environment variable and rerun Configure.

   <b>Using</b> <b>Large</b> <b>Files</b> <b>with</b> <b>Perl</b> <b>on</b> <b>Tru64</b>
       In Tru64 Perl is automatically able to use large files, that is, files larger than 2 gigabytes, there is
       no need to use the Configure -Duselargefiles option as described in INSTALL (though using the option is
       harmless).

   <b>Threaded</b> <b>Perl</b> <b>on</b> <b>Tru64</b>
       If you want to use threads, you should primarily use the Perl 5.8.0 threads model by running Configure
       with -Duseithreads.

       Perl threading is going to work only in Tru64 4.0 and newer releases, older operating releases like 3.2
       aren't probably going to work properly with threads.

       In Tru64 V5 (at least V5.1A, V5.1B) you cannot build threaded Perl with gcc because the system header
       &lt;pthread.h&gt; explicitly checks for supported C compilers, gcc (at least 3.2.2) not being one of them.  But
       the system C compiler should work just fine.

   <b>Long</b> <b>Doubles</b> <b>on</b> <b>Tru64</b>
       You cannot Configure Perl to use long doubles unless you have at least Tru64 V5.0, the long double
       support simply wasn't functional enough before that.  Perl's Configure will override attempts to use the
       long doubles (you can notice this by Configure finding out that the <b>modfl()</b> function does not work as it
       should).

       At the time of this writing (June 2002), there is a known bug in the Tru64 libc printing of long doubles
       when not using "e" notation.  The values are correct and usable, but you only get a limited number of
       digits displayed unless you force the issue by using "printf "%.33e",$num" or the like.  For Tru64
       versions V5.0A through V5.1A, a patch is expected sometime after perl 5.8.0 is released.  If your libc
       has not yet been patched, you'll get a warning from Configure when selecting long doubles.

   <b>DB_File</b> <b>tests</b> <b>failing</b> <b>on</b> <b>Tru64</b>
       The DB_File tests (db-btree.t, db-hash.t, db-recno.t) may fail you have installed a newer version of
       Berkeley DB into the system and the -I and -L compiler and linker flags introduce version conflicts with
       the DB 1.85 headers and libraries that came with the Tru64.  For example, mixing a DB v2 library with the
       DB v1 headers is a bad idea.  Watch out for Configure options -Dlocincpth and -Dloclibpth, and check your
       <a href="file:/usr/local/include">/usr/local/include</a> and <a href="file:/usr/local/lib">/usr/local/lib</a> since they are included by default.

       The second option is to explicitly instruct Configure to detect the newer Berkeley DB installation, by
       supplying the right directories with "-Dlocincpth=/some/include" and "-Dloclibpth=/some/lib" <b>and</b> before
       running "make test" setting your LD_LIBRARY_PATH to <u>/some/lib</u>.

       The third option is to work around the problem by disabling the DB_File completely when build Perl by
       specifying -Ui_db to Configure, and then using the BerkeleyDB module from CPAN instead of DB_File.  The
       BerkeleyDB works with Berkeley DB versions 2.* or greater.

       The Berkeley DB 4.1.25 has been tested with Tru64 V5.1A and found to work.  The latest Berkeley DB can be
       found from &lt;<a href="http://www.sleepycat.com">http://www.sleepycat.com</a>&gt;.

   <b>64-bit</b> <b>Perl</b> <b>on</b> <b>Tru64</b>
       In Tru64 Perl's integers are automatically 64-bit wide, there is no need to use the Configure
       -Duse64bitint option as described in INSTALL.  Similarly, there is no need for -Duse64bitall since
       pointers are automatically 64-bit wide.

   <b>Warnings</b> <b>about</b> <b>floating-point</b> <b>overflow</b> <b>when</b> <b>compiling</b> <b>Perl</b> <b>on</b> <b>Tru64</b>
       When compiling Perl in Tru64 you may (depending on the compiler release) see two warnings like this

        cc: Warning: numeric.c, line 104: In this statement, floating-point
        overflow occurs in evaluating the expression "1.8e308". (floatoverfl)
            return HUGE_VAL;
        -----------^

       and when compiling the POSIX extension

        cc: Warning: const-c.inc, line 2007: In this statement, floating-point
        overflow occurs in evaluating the expression "1.8e308". (floatoverfl)
                    return HUGE_VAL;
        -------------------^

       The exact line numbers may vary between Perl releases.  The warnings are benign and can be ignored: in
       later C compiler releases the warnings should be gone.

       When the file <u>pp_sys.c</u> is being compiled you may (depending on the operating system release) see an
       additional compiler flag being used: "-DNO_EFF_ONLY_OK".  This is normal and refers to a feature that is
       relevant only if you use the "filetest" pragma.  In older releases of the operating system the feature
       was broken and the NO_EFF_ONLY_OK instructs Perl not to use the feature.

</pre><h4><b>Testing</b> <b>Perl</b> <b>on</b> <b>Tru64</b></h4><pre>
       During "make test" the "comp"/"cpp" will be skipped because on Tru64 it cannot be tested before Perl has
       been installed.  The test refers to the use of the "-P" option of Perl.

</pre><h4><b>ext/ODBM_File/odbm</b> <b>Test</b> <b>Failing</b> <b>With</b> <b>Static</b> <b>Builds</b></h4><pre>
       The ext/ODBM_File/odbm is known to fail with static builds (Configure -Uusedl) due to a known bug in
       Tru64's static libdbm library.  The good news is that you very probably don't need to ever use the
       ODBM_File extension since more advanced NDBM_File works fine, not to mention the even more advanced
       DB_File.

</pre><h4><b>Perl</b> <b>Fails</b> <b>Because</b> <b>Of</b> <b>Unresolved</b> <b>Symbol</b> <b>sockatmark</b></h4><pre>
       If you get an error like

           Can't load '.../OSF1/lib/perl5/5.8.0/alpha-dec_osf/auto/IO/IO.so' for module IO: Unresolved symbol in .../lib/perl5/5.8.0/alpha-dec_osf/auto/IO/IO.so: sockatmark at .../lib/perl5/5.8.0/alpha-dec_osf/XSLoader.pm line 75.

       you need to either recompile your Perl in Tru64 4.0D or upgrade your Tru64 4.0D to at least 4.0F: the
       <b>sockatmark()</b> system call was added in Tru64 4.0F, and the IO extension refers that symbol.

</pre><h4><b>read_cur_obj_info:</b> <b>bad</b> <b>file</b> <b>magic</b> <b>number</b></h4><pre>
       You may be mixing the Tru64 cc/ar/ld with the GNU gcc/ar/ld.  That may work, but sometimes it doesn't
       (your gcc or GNU utils may have been compiled for an incompatible OS release).

       Try 'which ld' and 'which ld' (or try 'ar --version' and 'ld --version', which work only for the GNU
       tools, and will announce themselves to be such), and adjust your PATH so that you are consistently using
       either the native tools or the GNU tools.  After fixing your PATH, you should do 'make distclean' and
       start all the way from running the Configure since you may have quite a confused situation.
