       This section of the FAQ answers very general, high-level questions about Perl.

   <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>Perl?</b>
       Perl is a high-level programming language with an eclectic heritage written by Larry Wall and a cast of
       thousands.

       Perl's process, file, and text manipulation facilities make it particularly well-suited for tasks
       involving quick prototyping, system utilities, software tools, system management tasks, database access,
       graphical programming, networking, and web programming.

       Perl derives from the ubiquitous C programming language and to a lesser extent from sed, awk, the Unix
       shell, and many other tools and languages.

       These strengths make it especially popular with web developers and system administrators. Mathematicians,
       geneticists, journalists, managers and many other people also use Perl.

   <b>Who</b> <b>supports</b> <b>Perl?</b> <b>Who</b> <b>develops</b> <b>it?</b> <b>Why</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>free?</b>
       The original culture of the pre-populist Internet and the deeply-held beliefs of Perl's author, Larry
       Wall, gave rise to the free and open distribution policy of Perl. Perl is supported by its users. The
       core, the standard Perl library, the optional modules, and the documentation you're reading now were all
       written by volunteers.

       The core development team (known as the Perl Porters) are a group of highly altruistic individuals
       committed to producing better software for free than you could hope to purchase for money. You may snoop
       on pending developments via the archives &lt;<a href="http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/">http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/</a>&gt; or you can
       subscribe to the mailing list by sending <a href="mailto:perl5-porters-subscribe@perl.org">perl5-porters-subscribe@perl.org</a> a subscription request (an
       empty message with no subject is fine).

       While the GNU project includes Perl in its distributions, there's no such thing as "GNU Perl". Perl is
       not produced nor maintained by the Free Software Foundation. Perl's licensing terms are also more open
       than GNU software's tend to be.

       You can get commercial support of Perl if you wish, although for most users the informal support will
       more than suffice. See the answer to "Where can I buy a commercial version of Perl?" for more
       information.

   <b>Which</b> <b>version</b> <b>of</b> <b>Perl</b> <b>should</b> <b>I</b> <b>use?</b>
       (contributed by brian d foy with updates from others)

       There is often a matter of opinion and taste, and there isn't any one answer that fits everyone. In
       general, you want to use either the current stable release, or the stable release immediately prior to
       that one.

       Beyond that, you have to consider several things and decide which is best for you.

       •   If things aren't broken, upgrading perl may break them (or at least issue new warnings).

       •   The latest versions of perl have more bug fixes.

       •   The  latest  versions  of perl may contain performance improvements and features not present in older
           versions.  There have been many changes in perl since perl5 was first introduced.

       •   The Perl community is geared toward supporting the most recent releases, so  you'll  have  an  easier
           time finding help for those.

       •   Older  versions of perl may have security vulnerabilities, some of which are serious (see perlsec and
           search CVEs &lt;https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvekey.cgi?keyword=Perl&gt; for more information).

       •   The latest versions are probably the least deployed and widely tested, so you may want to wait a  few
           months after their release and see what problems others have if you are risk averse.

       •   The  immediate, in addition to the current stable release, the previous stable release is maintained.
           See "MAINTENANCE AND SUPPORT" in perlpolicy for more information.

       •   There are really two tracks of perl development: a maintenance version and an  experimental  version.
           The  maintenance  versions are stable, and have an even number as the minor release (i.e. perl5.24.x,
           where 24 is the minor release). The experimental versions may include features  that  don't  make  it
           into  the  stable versions, and have an odd number as the minor release (i.e. perl5.25.x, where 25 is
           the minor release).

       •   You can consult releases &lt;<a href="http://dev.perl.org/perl5">http://dev.perl.org/perl5</a>&gt; to determine the current stable release of Perl.

   <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>Raku</b> <b>(Perl</b> <b>6)?</b>
       Raku (formerly known as Perl 6) was <u>originally</u> described as the community's rewrite of Perl,  however  as
       the  language evolved, it became clear that it is a separate language, but in the same language family as
       Perl.

       Raku is not intended primarily as a replacement for Perl, but as its own thing - and libraries  exist  to
       allow you to call Perl code from Raku programs and vice versa.

       Contrary  to  popular  belief, Raku and Perl peacefully coexist with one another. Raku has proven to be a
       fascinating source of ideas for those using Perl (the Moose object system is a well-known example). There
       is overlap in the communities, and this overlap fosters the tradition of sharing and borrowing that  have
       been instrumental to Perl's success.

       For more about Raku see &lt;https://www.raku.org/&gt;.

       "We're really serious about reinventing everything that needs reinventing."  --Larry Wall

   <b>How</b> <b>stable</b> <b>is</b> <b>Perl?</b>
       Production releases, which incorporate bug fixes and new functionality, are widely tested before release.
       Since the 5.000 release, we have averaged about one production release per year.

       The  Perl  development  team  occasionally  make  changes  to  the internal core of the language, but all
       possible efforts are made toward backward compatibility.

   <b>How</b> <b>often</b> <b>are</b> <b>new</b> <b>versions</b> <b>of</b> <b>Perl</b> <b>released?</b>
       Recently, the plan has been to release a new version of Perl roughly every April, but getting the release
       right is more important than sticking rigidly to a  calendar  date,  so  the  release  date  is  somewhat
       flexible.  The historical release dates can be viewed at &lt;<a href="http://www.cpan.org/src/README.html">http://www.cpan.org/src/README.html</a>&gt;.

       Even  numbered minor versions (5.14, 5.16, 5.18) are production versions, and odd numbered minor versions
       (5.15, 5.17, 5.19) are development versions. Unless you want to try  out  an  experimental  feature,  you
       probably never want to install a development version of Perl.

       The  Perl  development  team  are  called  Perl  5  Porters,  and  their  organization  is  described  at
       &lt;<a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/perlpolicy.html">http://perldoc.perl.org/perlpolicy.html</a>&gt;.  The organizational rules really just boil down to one:  Larry
       is always right, even when he was wrong.

   <b>Is</b> <b>Perl</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn?</b>
       No,  Perl  is  easy to start learning &lt;<a href="http://learn.perl.org/">http://learn.perl.org/</a>&gt; --and easy to keep learning. It looks like
       most programming languages you're likely to have experience with, so if you've ever written a C  program,
       an awk script, a shell script, or even a BASIC program, you're already partway there.

       Most  tasks  only  require  a  small  subset  of  the  Perl  language. One of the guiding mottos for Perl
       development is "there's more than one way to do it" (TMTOWTDI, sometimes pronounced "tim toady").  Perl's
       learning  curve  is  therefore  shallow  (easy  to learn) and long (there's a whole lot you can do if you
       really want).

       Finally, because Perl is frequently (but not always, and certainly  not  by  definition)  an  interpreted
       language,  you  can  write your programs and test them without an intermediate compilation step, allowing
       you to experiment and test/debug quickly and easily. This ease of experimentation flattens  the  learning
       curve even more.

       Things  that  make  Perl  easier to learn: Unix experience, almost any kind of programming experience, an
       understanding of regular expressions, and the ability to  understand  other  people's  code.  If  there's
       something  you  need  to  do,  then  it's  probably  already  been done, and a working example is usually
       available for free. Don't forget Perl modules, either.  They're discussed in Part 3 of  this  FAQ,  along
       with CPAN &lt;<a href="http://www.cpan.org/">http://www.cpan.org/</a>&gt;, which is discussed in Part 2.

   <b>How</b> <b>does</b> <b>Perl</b> <b>compare</b> <b>with</b> <b>other</b> <b>languages</b> <b>like</b> <b>Java,</b> <b>Python,</b> <b>REXX,</b> <b>Scheme,</b> <b>or</b> <b>Tcl?</b>
       Perl can be used for almost any coding problem, even ones which require integrating specialist C code for
       extra  speed.  As  with  any  tool  it  can  be  used  well  or badly. Perl has many strengths, and a few
       weaknesses, precisely which areas are good and bad is often a personal choice.

       When choosing a language you should also be influenced by the resources  &lt;<a href="http://www.cpan.org/">http://www.cpan.org/</a>&gt;,  testing
       culture  &lt;<a href="http://www.cpantesters.org/">http://www.cpantesters.org/</a>&gt; and community &lt;<a href="http://www.perl.org/community.html">http://www.perl.org/community.html</a>&gt; which surrounds
       it.

       For comparisons to a specific language it is often best to create a small project in both  languages  and
       compare  the  results,  make  sure to use all the resources &lt;<a href="http://www.cpan.org/">http://www.cpan.org/</a>&gt; of each language, as a
       language is far more than just it's syntax.

   <b>Can</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>[task]</b> <b>in</b> <b>Perl?</b>
       Perl is flexible and extensible enough for you  to  use  on  virtually  any  task,  from  one-line  file-
       processing tasks to large, elaborate systems.

       For  many  people,  Perl  serves  as a great replacement for shell scripting.  For others, it serves as a
       convenient, high-level replacement for most of what they'd program in low-level languages like C or  C++.
       It's  ultimately  up  to you (and possibly your management) which tasks you'll use Perl for and which you
       won't.

       If you have a library that provides an API, you can make any component of it available  as  just  another
       Perl  function  or  variable  using a Perl extension written in C or C++ and dynamically linked into your
       main perl interpreter. You can also go the other direction, and write your main program in C or C++,  and
       then link in some Perl code on the fly, to create a powerful application. See perlembed.

       That said, there will always be small, focused, special-purpose languages dedicated to a specific problem
       domain  that are simply more convenient for certain kinds of problems. Perl tries to be all things to all
       people, but nothing special to anyone. Examples of specialized languages that come to mind include prolog
       and matlab.

   <b>When</b> <b>shouldn't</b> <b>I</b> <b>program</b> <b>in</b> <b>Perl?</b>
       One good reason is when you already have an existing application written in another language  that's  all
       done  (and done well), or you have an application language specifically designed for a certain task (e.g.
       prolog, make).

       If you find that you need to speed up a specific part of a Perl  application  (not  something  you  often
       need) you may want to use C, but you can access this from your Perl code with perlxs.

   <b>What's</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>"perl"</b> <b>and</b> <b>"Perl"?</b>
       "Perl"  is  the  name  of  the  language.  Only the "P" is capitalized.  The name of the interpreter (the
       program which runs the Perl script) is "perl" with a lowercase "p".

       You may or may not choose to follow this usage. But never write "PERL", because perl is not an acronym.

   <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>JAPH?</b>
       (contributed by brian d foy)

       JAPH stands for "Just another Perl hacker,", which Randal Schwartz used to sign email and usenet messages
       starting in the late 1980s. He previously used the phrase with many subjects ("Just another x  hacker,"),
       so to distinguish his JAPH, he started to write them as Perl programs:

           print "Just another Perl hacker,";

       Other  people  picked  up  on this and started to write clever or obfuscated programs to produce the same
       output, spinning things quickly out of control  while  still  providing  hours  of  amusement  for  their
       creators and readers.

       CPAN has several JAPH programs at &lt;<a href="http://www.cpan.org/misc/japh">http://www.cpan.org/misc/japh</a>&gt;.

   <b>How</b> <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>convince</b> <b>others</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>Perl?</b>
       (contributed by brian d foy)

       Appeal  to  their self interest! If Perl is new (and thus scary) to them, find something that Perl can do
       to solve one of their problems. That might mean that Perl either saves them something  (time,  headaches,
       money) or gives them something (flexibility, power, testability).

       In  general, the benefit of a language is closely related to the skill of the people using that language.
       If you or your team can be faster,  better,  and  stronger  through  Perl,  you'll  deliver  more  value.
       Remember,  people often respond better to what they get out of it. If you run into resistance, figure out
       what those people get out of the other choice and how Perl might satisfy that requirement.

       You don't have to worry about finding or paying for Perl;  it's  freely  available  and  several  popular
       operating   systems   come   with   Perl.   Community   support   in   places   such   as   Perlmonks   (
       &lt;<a href="http://www.perlmonks.com">http://www.perlmonks.com</a>&gt; ) and the various Perl mailing lists ( &lt;<a href="http://lists.perl.org">http://lists.perl.org</a>&gt;  )  means  that
       you can usually get quick answers to your problems.

       Finally,  keep in mind that Perl might not be the right tool for every job. You're a much better advocate
       if your claims are reasonable and grounded in reality. Dogmatically advocating  anything  tends  to  make
       people  discount  your  message.  Be honest about possible disadvantages to your choice of Perl since any
       choice has trade-offs.
