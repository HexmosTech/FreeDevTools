</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Python  is  an  interpreted,  interactive,  object-oriented programming language that combines remarkable
       power with very clear syntax.  For an introduction to programming in Python,  see  the  Python  Tutorial.
       The  Python  Library  Reference  documents built-in and standard types, constants, functions and modules.
       Finally, the Python Reference Manual describes the syntax and semantics of the core language in  (perhaps
       too)  much  detail.   (These  documents  may  be  located  via  the <b>INTERNET</b> <b>RESOURCES</b> below; they may be
       installed on your system as well.)

       Python's basic power can be extended with your own modules written in C or C++.   On  most  systems  such
       modules  may  be  dynamically  loaded.   Python  is  also adaptable as an extension language for existing
       applications.  See the internal documentation for hints.

       Documentation for installed Python modules and packages can be viewed by running the <b>pydoc</b> program.

</pre><h4><b>COMMAND</b> <b>LINE</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-B</b>     Don't write <u>.pyc</u> files on import. See also PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE.

       <b>-b</b>     Issue warnings about str(bytes_instance), str(bytearray_instance)  and  comparing  bytes/bytearray
              with str. (-bb: issue errors)

       <b>-c</b> <u>command</u>
              Specify  the  command  to  execute (see next section).  This terminates the option list (following
              options are passed as arguments to the command).

       <b>--check-hash-based-pycs</b> <u>mode</u>
              Configure how Python evaluates the up-to-dateness of hash-based .pyc files.

       <b>-d</b>     Turn on parser debugging output (for expert only, depending on compilation options).

       <b>-E</b>     Ignore environment variables like PYTHONPATH and  PYTHONHOME  that  modify  the  behavior  of  the
              interpreter.

       <b>-h</b> <b>,</b>  <b>-?</b> <b>,</b>  <b>--help</b>
              Prints the usage for the interpreter executable and exits.

       <b>-i</b>     When  a  script is passed as first argument or the <b>-c</b> option is used, enter interactive mode after
              executing the script or the command.  It does not read  the  $PYTHONSTARTUP  file.   This  can  be
              useful to inspect global variables or a stack trace when a script raises an exception.

       <b>-I</b>     Run  Python  in  isolated  mode.  This  also implies <b>-E</b> and <b>-s</b>. In isolated mode sys.path contains
              neither the script's directory nor the user's site-packages  directory.  All  PYTHON*  environment
              variables  are  ignored,  too.   Further  restrictions  may  be  imposed  to prevent the user from
              injecting malicious code.

       <b>-m</b> <u>module-name</u>
              Searches <u>sys.path</u> for the named module and runs the corresponding  <u>.py</u>  file  as  a  script.  This
              terminates the option list (following options are passed as arguments to the module).

       <b>-O</b>     Remove  assert statements and any code conditional on the value of __debug__; augment the filename
              for compiled (bytecode) files by adding .opt-1 before the .pyc extension.

       <b>-OO</b>    Do <b>-O</b> and also discard docstrings; change the filename for compiled  (bytecode)  files  by  adding
              .opt-2 before the .pyc extension.

       <b>-q</b>     Do  not  print  the  version  and  copyright  messages. These messages are also suppressed in non-
              interactive mode.

       <b>-s</b>     Don't add user site directory to sys.path.

       <b>-S</b>     Disable the import of the module <u>site</u> and the site-dependent manipulations  of  <u>sys.path</u>  that  it
              entails.  Also disable these manipulations if <u>site</u> is explicitly imported later.

       <b>-u</b>     Force  the  stdout  and  stderr  streams to be unbuffered.  This option has no effect on the stdin
              stream.

       <b>-v</b>     Print a message each time a module is initialized, showing the place (filename or built-in module)
              from which it is loaded.  When given twice, print a message for each file that is checked for when
              searching for a module.  Also provides information on module cleanup at exit.

       <b>-V</b> <b>,</b>  <b>--version</b>
              Prints the Python version number of the executable  and  exits.   When  given  twice,  print  more
              information about the build.

       <b>-W</b> <u>argument</u>
              Warning control. Python's warning machinery by default prints warning messages to <u>sys.stderr</u>.

              The  simplest  settings  apply  a  particular  action unconditionally to all warnings emitted by a
              process (even those that are otherwise ignored by default):

                -Wdefault  # Warn once per call location
                -Werror    # Convert to exceptions
                -Walways   # Warn every time
                -Wmodule   # Warn once per calling module
                -Wonce     # Warn once per Python process
                -Wignore   # Never warn

              The action names can be abbreviated as desired and  the  interpreter  will  resolve  them  to  the
              appropriate action name. For example, <b>-Wi</b> is the same as <b>-Wignore</b> <b>.</b>

              The full form of argument is: <u>action:message:category:module:lineno</u>

              Empty   fields   match  all  values;  trailing  empty  fields  may  be  omitted.  For  example  <b>-W</b>
              <b>ignore::DeprecationWarning</b> ignores all DeprecationWarning warnings.

              The <u>action</u> field is as explained above but only applies  to  warnings  that  match  the  remaining
              fields.

              The <u>message</u> field must match the whole printed warning message; this match is case-insensitive.

              The  <u>category</u>  field matches the warning category (ex: "DeprecationWarning"). This must be a class
              name; the match test whether the actual warning category of the  message  is  a  subclass  of  the
              specified warning category.

              The <u>module</u> field matches the (fully-qualified) module name; this match is case-sensitive.

              The  <u>lineno</u>  field  matches  the  line  number,  where  zero  matches all line numbers and is thus
              equivalent to an omitted line number.

              Multiple <b>-W</b> options can be given; when a warning matches more than one option, the action for  the
              last  matching  option  is performed. Invalid <b>-W</b> options are ignored (though, a warning message is
              printed about invalid options when the first warning is issued).

              Warnings can also be controlled using the <b>PYTHONWARNINGS</b> environment variable and  from  within  a
              Python program using the warnings module.  For example, the warnings.filterwarnings() function can
              be used to use a regular expression on the warning message.

       <b>-X</b> <u>option</u>
              Set implementation specific option. The following options are available:

                  -X faulthandler: enable faulthandler

                  -X showrefcount: output the total reference count and number of used
                      memory blocks when the program finishes or after each statement in the
                      interactive interpreter. This only works on debug builds

                  -X tracemalloc: start tracing Python memory allocations using the
                      tracemalloc module. By default, only the most recent frame is stored in a
                      traceback of a trace. Use -X tracemalloc=NFRAME to start tracing with a
                      traceback limit of NFRAME frames

                  -X importtime: show how long each import takes. It shows module name,
                      cumulative time (including nested imports) and self time (excluding
                      nested imports). Note that its output may be broken in multi-threaded
                      application. Typical usage is python3 -X importtime -c 'import asyncio'

                  -X dev: enable CPython's "development mode", introducing additional runtime
                      checks which are too expensive to be enabled by default. It will not be
                      more verbose than the default if the code is correct: new warnings are
                      only emitted when an issue is detected. Effect of the developer mode:
                         * Add default warning filter, as -W default
                         * Install debug hooks on memory allocators: see the PyMem_SetupDebugHooks()
                           C function
                         * Enable the faulthandler module to dump the Python traceback on a crash
                         * Enable asyncio debug mode
                         * Set the dev_mode attribute of sys.flags to True
                         * io.IOBase destructor logs close() exceptions

                  -X utf8: enable UTF-8 mode for operating system interfaces, overriding the default
                      locale-aware mode. -X utf8=0 explicitly disables UTF-8 mode (even when it would
                      otherwise activate automatically). See PYTHONUTF8 for more details

                  -X pycache_prefix=PATH: enable writing .pyc files to a parallel tree rooted at the
                      given directory instead of to the code tree.

                  -X warn_default_encoding: enable opt-in EncodingWarning for 'encoding=None'

                  -X int_max_str_digits=number: limit the size of int&lt;-&gt;str conversions.
                     This helps avoid denial of service attacks when parsing untrusted data.
                     The default is sys.int_info.default_max_str_digits.  0 disables.

       <b>-x</b>     Skip  the  first line of the source.  This is intended for a DOS specific hack only.  Warning: the
              line numbers in error messages will be off by one!

</pre><h4><b>INTERPRETER</b> <b>INTERFACE</b></h4><pre>
       The interpreter interface resembles that of the UNIX shell: when called with standard input connected  to
       a  tty  device,  it  prompts for commands and executes them until an EOF is read; when called with a file
       name argument or with a file as standard input, it reads and executes  a  <u>script</u>  from  that  file;  when
       called  with  <b>-c</b> <u>command</u>, it executes the Python statement(s) given as <u>command</u>.  Here <u>command</u> may contain
       multiple statements separated by newlines.  Leading whitespace is significant in Python  statements!   In
       non-interactive mode, the entire input is parsed before it is executed.

       If  available, the script name and additional arguments thereafter are passed to the script in the Python
       variable <u>sys.argv</u>, which is a list of strings (you must first <u>import</u> <u>sys</u> to be able to access it).  If no
       script name is given, <u>sys.argv[0]</u> is an empty string; if <b>-c</b> is  used,  <u>sys.argv[0]</u>  contains  the  string
       <u>'-c'.</u>  Note that options interpreted by the Python interpreter itself are not placed in <u>sys.argv</u>.

       In  interactive mode, the primary prompt is `&gt;&gt;&gt;'; the second prompt (which appears when a command is not
       complete) is `...'.  The prompts can be changed by assignment to <u>sys.ps1</u>  or  <u>sys.ps2</u>.   The  interpreter
       quits when it reads an EOF at a prompt.  When an unhandled exception occurs, a stack trace is printed and
       control  returns to the primary prompt; in non-interactive mode, the interpreter exits after printing the
       stack trace.  The interrupt signal raises the <u>KeyboardInterrupt</u> exception; other  UNIX  signals  are  not
       caught (except that SIGPIPE is sometimes ignored, in favor of the <u>IOError</u> exception).  Error messages are
       written to stderr.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b> <b>AND</b> <b>DIRECTORIES</b></h4><pre>
       These are subject to difference depending on local installation conventions; ${prefix} and ${exec_prefix}
       are  installation-dependent  and  should  be  interpreted  as for GNU software; they may be the same.  On
       Debian GNU/{Hurd,Linux} the default for both is <u><a href="file:/usr">/usr</a></u>.

       <u>${exec_prefix}/bin/python</u>
              Recommended location of the interpreter.

       <u>${prefix}/lib/python&lt;version&gt;</u>
       <u>${exec_prefix}/lib/python&lt;version&gt;</u>
              Recommended locations of the directories containing the standard modules.

       <u>${prefix}/include/python&lt;version&gt;</u>
       <u>${exec_prefix}/include/python&lt;version&gt;</u>
              Recommended locations of the directories containing the include files needed for developing Python
              extensions and embedding the interpreter.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       PYTHONHOME
              Change the location of the standard Python libraries.  By default, the libraries are  searched  in
              ${prefix}/lib/python&lt;version&gt;   and   ${exec_prefix}/lib/python&lt;version&gt;,   where   ${prefix}  and
              ${exec_prefix} are  installation-dependent  directories,  both  defaulting  to  <u><a href="file:/usr/local">/usr/local</a></u>.   When
              $PYTHONHOME  is  set  to a single directory, its value replaces both ${prefix} and ${exec_prefix}.
              To specify different values for these, set $PYTHONHOME to ${prefix}:${exec_prefix}.

       PYTHONPATH
              Augments the default search path for module files.  The format is the same as the  shell's  $PATH:
              one  or  more  directory  pathnames  separated  by  colons.  Non-existent directories are silently
              ignored.   The  default  search  path  is  installation  dependent,  but  generally  begins   with
              ${prefix}/lib/python&lt;version&gt;  (see PYTHONHOME above).  The default search path is always appended
              to $PYTHONPATH.  If a script argument is given, the directory containing the script is inserted in
              the path in front of $PYTHONPATH.  The search path can be manipulated from within a Python program
              as the variable <u>sys.path</u>.

       PYTHONPLATLIBDIR
              Override sys.platlibdir.

       PYTHONSTARTUP
              If this is the name of a readable file, the Python commands in that file are executed  before  the
              first  prompt is displayed in interactive mode.  The file is executed in the same name space where
              interactive commands are executed so that objects defined or imported in it can  be  used  without
              qualification  in the interactive session.  You can also change the prompts <u>sys.ps1</u> and <u>sys.ps2</u> in
              this file.

       PYTHONOPTIMIZE
              If this is set to a non-empty string it is equivalent to specifying the <b>-O</b> option. If  set  to  an
              integer, it is equivalent to specifying <b>-O</b> multiple times.

       PYTHONDEBUG
              If  this  is  set to a non-empty string it is equivalent to specifying the <b>-d</b> option. If set to an
              integer, it is equivalent to specifying <b>-d</b> multiple times.

       PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE
              If this is set to a non-empty string it is equivalent to specifying the <b>-B</b> option  (don't  try  to
              write <u>.pyc</u> files).

       PYTHONINSPECT
              If this is set to a non-empty string it is equivalent to specifying the <b>-i</b> option.

       PYTHONIOENCODING
              If   this   is   set   before  running  the  interpreter,  it  overrides  the  encoding  used  for
              stdin/stdout/stderr, in the syntax <u>encodingname</u><b>:</b><u>errorhandler</u> The <u>errorhandler</u> part is optional and
              has the same meaning as in str.encode. For stderr, the <u>errorhandler</u>
               part is ignored; the handler will always be ´backslashreplace´.

       PYTHONNOUSERSITE
              If this is set to a non-empty string it is equivalent to specifying the <b>-s</b> option (Don't  add  the
              user site directory to sys.path).

       PYTHONUNBUFFERED
              If this is set to a non-empty string it is equivalent to specifying the <b>-u</b> option.

       PYTHONVERBOSE
              If  this  is  set to a non-empty string it is equivalent to specifying the <b>-v</b> option. If set to an
              integer, it is equivalent to specifying <b>-v</b> multiple times.

       PYTHONWARNINGS
              If this is set to a comma-separated string it is equivalent to specifying the <b>-W</b> option  for  each
              separate value.

       PYTHONHASHSEED
              If  this  variable  is set to "random", a random value is used to seed the hashes of str and bytes
              objects.

              If PYTHONHASHSEED is set to an integer value, it is used as a fixed seed for generating the hash()
              of the types covered by the hash randomization.  Its purpose is to allow repeatable hashing,  such
              as  for  selftests  for the interpreter itself, or to allow a cluster of python processes to share
              hash values.

              The integer must be a decimal number in the range [0,4294967295].  Specifying  the  value  0  will
              disable hash randomization.

       PYTHONINTMAXSTRDIGITS
              Limit  the  maximum  digit  characters  in  an  int  value  when converting from a string and when
              converting an int back to a str.  A value of 0 disables the limit.  Conversions to or  from  bases
              2, 4, 8, 16, and 32 are never limited.

       PYTHONMALLOC
              Set  the  Python memory allocators and/or install debug hooks. The available memory allocators are
              <u>malloc</u> and <u>pymalloc</u>.  The available debug hooks are <u>debug</u>, <u>malloc_debug</u>, and <u>pymalloc_debug</u>.

              When Python is compiled in debug mode, the default is  <u>pymalloc_debug</u>  and  the  debug  hooks  are
              automatically used. Otherwise, the default is <u>pymalloc</u>.

       PYTHONMALLOCSTATS
              If  set to a non-empty string, Python will print statistics of the pymalloc memory allocator every
              time a new pymalloc object arena is created, and on shutdown.

              This variable is ignored if the $<b>PYTHONMALLOC</b> environment variable is used to force the  <b><a href="../man3/malloc.3.html">malloc</a></b>(3)
              allocator of the C library, or if Python is configured without pymalloc support.

       PYTHONASYNCIODEBUG
              If  this  environment  variable is set to a non-empty string, enable the debug mode of the asyncio
              module.

       PYTHONTRACEMALLOC
              If this environment variable is set to a non-empty string, start tracing Python memory allocations
              using the tracemalloc module.

              The value of the variable is the maximum number of frames stored in a traceback of  a  trace.  For
              example, <u>PYTHONTRACEMALLOC=1</u> stores only the most recent frame.

       PYTHONFAULTHANDLER
              If  this  environment  variable  is  set to a non-empty string, <u>faulthandler.enable()</u> is called at
              startup: install a handler for SIGSEGV, SIGFPE, SIGABRT, SIGBUS and SIGILL  signals  to  dump  the
              Python traceback.

              This is equivalent to the <b>-X</b> <b>faulthandler</b> option.

       PYTHONEXECUTABLE
              If this environment variable is set, <u>sys.argv[0]</u> will be set to its value instead of the value got
              through the C runtime. Only works on Mac OS X.

       PYTHONUSERBASE
              Defines  the  user  base  directory,  which  is used to compute the path of the user <u>site-packages</u>
              directory and Distutils installation paths for <u>python</u> <u>setup.py</u> <u>install</u> <u>--user</u>.

       PYTHONPROFILEIMPORTTIME
              If this environment variable is set to a non-empty string, Python will show how long  each  import
              takes. This is exactly equivalent to setting <b>-X</b> <b>importtime</b> on the command line.

       PYTHONBREAKPOINT
              If  this  environment variable is set to 0, it disables the default debugger. It can be set to the
              callable of your debugger of choice.

   <b>Debug-mode</b> <b>variables</b>
       Setting these variables only has an effect in a debug build of Python, that is, if Python was  configured
       with the <b>--with-pydebug</b> build option.

       PYTHONTHREADDEBUG
              If  this  environment  variable  is  set,  Python will print threading debug info.  The feature is
              deprecated in Python 3.10 and will be removed in Python 3.12.

       PYTHONDUMPREFS
              If this environment variable is set, Python will dump objects and  reference  counts  still  alive
              after shutting down the interpreter.
