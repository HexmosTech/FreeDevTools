       perldeprecation - list Perl deprecations

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The purpose of this document is to document what has been deprecated in Perl, and by which version the
       deprecated feature will disappear, or, for already removed features, when it was removed.

       This document will try to discuss what alternatives for the deprecated features are available.

       The deprecated features will be grouped by the version of Perl in which they will be removed.

   <b>Unscheduled</b> <b>Deprecations</b>
       <u>Unicode</u> <u>Delimiter</u> <u>Will</u> <u>be</u> <u>Paired</u>

       Some unicode delimiters used to be allowed as single characters, but in the future will be part of a
       balanced pair. This deprecation category is used to mark the ones that will change from being unpaired to
       paired.

       Category: "deprecated::delimiter_will_be_paired"

       <u>Dot</u> <u>In</u> <u>Inc</u>

       The current working directory "." used to be automatically included in @INC, but in Perl 5.26 this was
       removed for security reasons. Ever since then we have produced a warning when a user uses "do EXPR" and
       "EXPR" does not include a path, and the file was not found in any directory in @INC but <u>was</u> located in
       ".". The file will not be loaded but a deprecated warning will be generated.

       Category: "deprecated::dot_in_inc"

       <u>Unicode</u> <u>Property</u> <u>Name</u>

       Various types of unicode property name will generate deprecated warnings when used in a regex pattern.
       For instance surrogate characters will result in deprecation warnings.

       Category: "deprecated::unicode_property_name"

   <b>Perl</b> <b>5.44</b>
       <u>Calling</u> <u>a</u> <u>missing</u> <u>import()</u> <u>or</u> <u>unimport()</u> <u>method</u> <u>with</u> <u>an</u> <u>argument</u>

       Historically calling import() or unimport() on any class which did not define such a method would be
       silently ignored. Effectively Perl behaved as though there was an empty method defined in the "UNIVERSAL"
       package (even when there was no such method actually defined). As of Perl version 5.39.2 calling such a
       method <u>with</u> an argument will trigger a warning, and in Perl version 5.44 this warning will be upgraded to
       an error. (Calling such a method with no arguments at all will always be safe.)

       Category: "deprecated::missing_import_called_with_args"

       <u>Changing</u> <u>"use</u> <u>VERSION"</u> <u>while</u> <u>another</u> <u>"use</u> <u>VERSION"</u> <u>is</u> <u>in</u> <u>scope</u>

       A "use VERSION" declaration has many implicit effects on the surrounding scope, such as strict and
       feature flags, or importing builtin functions. Once you have a "use VERSION" statement in scope, another
       "use VERSION" statement with a different version is now deprecated since Perl 5.39.8, due to the
       increasing complexity of swapping from one prevailing version to another.

       Category: "deprecated::subsequent_use_version"

   <b>Perl</b> <b>5.42</b>
       <u>Smartmatch</u>

       Smartmatch is now seen as a failed experiment and was marked as deprecated in Perl 5.37.10. This includes
       the "when" and "given" keywords, as well as the smartmatch operator "~~". The feature will be removed
       entirely in the Perl 5.42.0 production release.

       Category: "deprecated::smartmatch"

       <u>Goto</u> <u>Block</u> <u>Construct</u>

       "goto LABEL;" will produce a deprecated warning when jumping into the body of a loop or other block
       construct from outside. For instance

           while (should_loop($x)) {
               LABEL:
                   do_stuff();
           }
           goto LABEL;

       will produce a warning that this behavior is deprecated. In general you should just avoid doing this; the
       people that maintain your code will be grateful for your restraint.

       Category: "deprecated::goto_construct"

       <u>Use</u> <u>of</u> <u>"'"</u> <u>as</u> <u>a</u> <u>global</u> <u>name</u> <u>separator</u>

       Perl allows use of "'" instead of "::" to replace the parts of a package or global variable name, for
       example "A::B" and "A'B" are equivalent.

       "'" will no longer be recognized as a name separator in Perl 5.42.

       Category: "deprecated::apostrophe_as_package_separator"

   <b>Perl</b> <b>5.40</b>
       <u>Downgrading</u> <u>a</u> <u>"use</u> <u>VERSION"</u> <u>to</u> <u>below</u> <u>v5.11</u>

       Once Perl has seen a "use VERSION" declaration that requests a version "v5.11" or above, a subsequent
       second declaration that requests an earlier version will print a deprecation warning. For example,

           use v5.14;
           say "We can use v5.14's features here";

           use v5.10;        # This prints a warning

       This was deprecated in Perl 5.36 and is now fatal.

       This is because of an intended related change to the interaction between "use VERSION" and "use strict".
       If you specify a version &gt;= 5.11, strict is enabled implicitly. If you request a version &lt; 5.11, strict
       will become disabled <u>even</u> <u>if</u> <u>you</u> <u>had</u> <u>previously</u> <u>written</u> "use strict". This was not the previous behaviour
       of "use VERSION", which at present will track explicitly-enabled strictness flags independently.

       Category: "deprecated::version_downgrade"

   <b>Perl</b> <b>5.38</b>
       <u>Pod::Html</u> <u>utility</u> <u>functions</u>

       The definition and documentation of three utility functions previously importable from Pod::Html were
       moved to new package Pod::Html::Util in Perl 5.36.  While they remained importable from Pod::Html in Perl
       5.36, as of Perl 5.38 they are only importable, on request, from Pod::Html::Util.

   <b>Perl</b> <b>5.34</b>
       There were no deprecations or fatalizations in Perl 5.34.

   <b>Perl</b> <b>5.32</b>
       <u>Constants</u> <u>from</u> <u>lexical</u> <u>variables</u> <u>potentially</u> <u>modified</u> <u>elsewhere</u>

       You wrote something like

           my $var;
           $sub = sub () { $var };

       but $var is referenced elsewhere and could be modified after the "sub" expression is evaluated.  Either
       it is explicitly modified elsewhere ("$var = 3") or it is passed to a subroutine or to an operator like
       "printf" or "map", which may or may not modify the variable.

       Traditionally, Perl has captured the value of the variable at that point and turned the subroutine into a
       constant eligible for inlining.  In those cases where the variable can be modified elsewhere, this breaks
       the behavior of closures, in which the subroutine captures the variable itself, rather than its value, so
       future changes to the variable are reflected in the subroutine's return value.

       If you intended for the subroutine to be eligible for inlining, then make sure the variable is not
       referenced elsewhere, possibly by copying it:

           my $var2 = $var;
           $sub = sub () { $var2 };

       If you do want this subroutine to be a closure that reflects future changes to the variable that it
       closes over, add an explicit "return":

           my $var;
           $sub = sub () { return $var };

       This usage was deprecated and as of Perl 5.32 is no longer allowed.

       <u>Use</u> <u>of</u> <u>strings</u> <u>with</u> <u>code</u> <u>points</u> <u>over</u> <u>0xFF</u> <u>as</u> <u>arguments</u> <u>to</u> <u>"vec"</u>

       "vec" views its string argument as a sequence of bits.  A string containing a code point over 0xFF is
       nonsensical.  This usage is deprecated in Perl 5.28, and was removed in Perl 5.32.

       <u>Use</u> <u>of</u> <u>code</u> <u>points</u> <u>over</u> <u>0xFF</u> <u>in</u> <u>string</u> <u>bitwise</u> <u>operators</u>

       The string bitwise operators, "&amp;", "|", "^", and "~", treat their operands as strings of bytes. As such,
       values above 0xFF are nonsensical. Some instances of these have been deprecated since Perl 5.24, and were
       made fatal in 5.28, but it turns out that in cases where the wide characters did not affect the end
       result, no deprecation notice was raised, and so remain legal.  Now, all occurrences either are fatal or
       raise a deprecation warning, so that the remaining legal occurrences became fatal in 5.32.

       An example of this is

        "" &amp; "\x{100}"

       The wide character is not used in the "&amp;" operation because the left operand is shorter.  This now throws
       an exception.

       <u><b>hostname()</b></u> <u>doesn't</u> <u>accept</u> <u>any</u> <u>arguments</u>

       The function hostname() in the Sys::Hostname module has always been documented to be called with no
       arguments.  Historically it has not enforced this, and has actually accepted and ignored any arguments.
       As a result, some users have got the mistaken impression that an argument does something useful.  To
       avoid these bugs, the function is being made strict.  Passing arguments was deprecated in Perl 5.28 and
       became fatal in Perl 5.32.

       <u>Unescaped</u> <u>left</u> <u>braces</u> <u>in</u> <u>regular</u> <u>expressions</u>

       The simple rule to remember, if you want to match a literal "{" character (U+007B "LEFT CURLY BRACKET")
       in a regular expression pattern, is to escape each literal instance of it in some way.  Generally easiest
       is to precede it with a backslash, like "\{" or enclose it in square brackets ("[{]").  If the pattern
       delimiters are also braces, any matching right brace ("}") should also be escaped to avoid confusing the
       parser, for example,

        qr{abc\{def\}ghi}

       Forcing literal "{" characters to be escaped will enable the Perl language to be extended in various ways
       in future releases.  To avoid needlessly breaking existing code, the restriction is not enforced in
       contexts where there are unlikely to ever be extensions that could conflict with the use of "{" as a
       literal.  A non-deprecation warning that the left brace is being taken literally is raised in contexts
       where there could be confusion about it.

       Literal uses of "{" were deprecated in Perl 5.20, and some uses of it started to give deprecation
       warnings since. These cases were made fatal in Perl 5.26. Due to an oversight, not all cases of a use of
       a literal "{" got a deprecation warning.  Some cases started warning in Perl 5.26, and were made fatal in
       Perl 5.30.  Other cases started in Perl 5.28, and were made fatal in 5.32.

       <u>In</u> <u>XS</u> <u>code,</u> <u>use</u> <u>of</u> <u>various</u> <u>macros</u> <u>dealing</u> <u>with</u> <u>UTF-8</u>

       The macros below now require an extra parameter compared to versions prior to Perl 5.32.  The final
       parameter in each one is a pointer into the string supplied by the first parameter beyond which the input
       will not be read.  This prevents potential reading beyond the end of the buffer.  "isALPHANUMERIC_utf8",
       "isASCII_utf8", "isBLANK_utf8", "isCNTRL_utf8", "isDIGIT_utf8", "isIDFIRST_utf8", "isPSXSPC_utf8",
       "isSPACE_utf8", "isVERTWS_utf8", "isWORDCHAR_utf8", "isXDIGIT_utf8", "isALPHANUMERIC_LC_utf8",
       "isALPHA_LC_utf8", "isASCII_LC_utf8", "isBLANK_LC_utf8", "isCNTRL_LC_utf8", "isDIGIT_LC_utf8",
       "isGRAPH_LC_utf8", "isIDCONT_LC_utf8", "isIDFIRST_LC_utf8", "isLOWER_LC_utf8", "isPRINT_LC_utf8",
       "isPSXSPC_LC_utf8", "isPUNCT_LC_utf8", "isSPACE_LC_utf8", "isUPPER_LC_utf8", "isWORDCHAR_LC_utf8",
       "isXDIGIT_LC_utf8", "toFOLD_utf8", "toLOWER_utf8", "toTITLE_utf8", and "toUPPER_utf8".

       Since Perl 5.26, this functionality with the extra parameter has been available by using a corresponding
       macro to each one of these, and whose name is formed by appending "_safe" to the base name.  There is no
       change to the functionality of those.  For example, "isDIGIT_utf8_safe" corresponds to "isDIGIT_utf8",
       and both now behave identically.  All are documented in "Character case changing" in perlapi and
       "Character classification" in perlapi.

       This change was originally scheduled for 5.30, but was delayed until 5.32.

       <u>File::Glob::glob()</u> <u>was</u> <u>removed</u>

       "File::Glob" had a function called "glob", which just called "bsd_glob".

       File::Glob::glob() was deprecated in Perl 5.8. A deprecation message was issued from Perl 5.26 onwards,
       the function became fatal in Perl 5.30, and was removed entirely in Perl 5.32.

       Code using File::Glob::glob() should call File::Glob::bsd_glob() instead.

   <b>Perl</b> <b>5.30</b>
       <u>$*</u> <u>is</u> <u>no</u> <u>longer</u> <u>supported</u>

       Before Perl 5.10, setting $* to a true value globally enabled multi-line matching within a string. This
       relic from the past lost its special meaning in 5.10. Use of this variable became a fatal error in Perl
       5.30, freeing the variable up for a future special meaning.

       To enable multiline matching one should use the "/m" regexp modifier (possibly in combination with "/s").
       This can be set on a per match basis, or can be enabled per lexical scope (including a whole file) with
       "use re '/m'".

       <u>$#</u> <u>is</u> <u>no</u> <u>longer</u> <u>supported</u>

       This variable used to have a special meaning -- it could be used to control how numbers were formatted
       when printed. This seldom used functionality was removed in Perl 5.10. In order to free up the variable
       for a future special meaning, its use became a fatal error in Perl 5.30.

       To specify how numbers are formatted when printed, one is advised to use "printf" or "sprintf" instead.

       <u>Assigning</u> <u>non-zero</u> <u>to</u> <u>$[</u> <u>is</u> <u>fatal</u>

       This variable (and the corresponding "array_base" feature and arybase module) allowed changing the base
       for array and string indexing operations.

       Setting this to a non-zero value has been deprecated since Perl 5.12 and throws a fatal error as of Perl
       5.30.

       <u>Unqualified</u> <u>dump()</u>

       Use of dump() instead of CORE::dump() was deprecated in Perl 5.8, and an unqualified dump() is no longer
       available as of Perl 5.30.

       See "dump" in perlfunc.

       <u>Using</u> <u><b>my()</b></u> <u>in</u> <u>false</u> <u>conditional</u>

       There has been a long-standing bug in Perl that causes a lexical variable not to be cleared at scope exit
       when its declaration includes a false conditional.  Some people have exploited this bug to achieve a kind
       of static variable.  To allow us to fix this bug, people should not be relying on this behavior.

       Instead, it's recommended one uses "state" variables to achieve the same effect:

           use 5.10.0;
           sub count {state $counter; return ++ $counter}
           say count ();    # Prints 1
           say count ();    # Prints 2

       "state" variables were introduced in Perl 5.10.

       Alternatively, you can achieve a similar static effect by declaring the variable in a separate block
       outside the function, e.g.,

           sub f { my $x if 0; return $x++ }

       becomes

           { my $x; sub f { return $x++ } }

       The use of my() in a false conditional has been deprecated in Perl 5.10, and became a fatal error in Perl
       5.30.

       <u>Reading/writing</u> <u>bytes</u> <u>from/to</u> <u>:utf8</u> <u>handles</u>

       The <b>sysread()</b>, <b>recv()</b>, <b>syswrite()</b> and <b>send()</b> operators are deprecated on handles that have the ":utf8"
       layer, either explicitly, or implicitly, eg., with the :encoding(UTF-16LE) layer.

       Both <b>sysread()</b> and <b>recv()</b> currently use only the ":utf8" flag for the stream, ignoring the actual layers.
       Since <b>sysread()</b> and <b>recv()</b> do no UTF-8 validation they can end up creating invalidly encoded scalars.

       Similarly, <b>syswrite()</b> and <b>send()</b> use only the ":utf8" flag, otherwise ignoring any layers.  If the flag
       is set, both write the value UTF-8 encoded, even if the layer is some different encoding, such as the
       UTF-16LE example above.

       Ideally, all of these operators would completely ignore the ":utf8" state, working only with bytes, but
       this would result in silently breaking existing code.  To avoid this a future version of perl will throw
       an exception when any of <b>sysread()</b>, <b>recv()</b>, <b>syswrite()</b> or <b>send()</b> are called on handles with the ":utf8"
       layer.

       As of Perl 5.30, it is no longer possible to use <b>sysread()</b>, <b>recv()</b>, <b>syswrite()</b> or <b>send()</b> to read or send
       bytes from/to ":utf8" handles.

       <u>Use</u> <u>of</u> <u>unassigned</u> <u>code</u> <u>point</u> <u>or</u> <u>non-standalone</u> <u>grapheme</u> <u>for</u> <u>a</u> <u>delimiter</u>

       A grapheme is what appears to a native speaker of a language to be a character.  In Unicode (and hence
       Perl) a grapheme may actually be several adjacent characters that together form a complete grapheme.  For
       example, there can be a base character, like "R" and an accent, like a circumflex "^", that appear to be
       a single character when displayed, with the circumflex hovering over the "R".

       As of Perl 5.30, use of delimiters which are non-standalone graphemes is fatal, in order to move the
       language to be able to accept multi-character graphemes as delimiters.

       Also, as of Perl 5.30, delimiters which are unassigned code points but that may someday become assigned
       are prohibited.  Otherwise, code that works today would fail to compile if the currently unassigned
       delimiter ends up being something that isn't a stand-alone grapheme.  Because Unicode is never going to
       assign non-character code points, nor code points that are above the legal Unicode maximum, those can be
       delimiters.

   <b>Perl</b> <b>5.28</b>
       <u>Attributes</u> <u>":locked"</u> <u>and</u> <u>":unique"</u>

       The attributes ":locked" (on code references) and ":unique" (on array, hash and scalar references) have
       had no effect since Perl 5.005 and Perl 5.8.8 respectively. Their use has been deprecated since.

       As of Perl 5.28, these attributes are syntax errors. Since the attributes do not do anything, removing
       them from your code fixes the syntax error; and removing them will not influence the behaviour of your
       code.

       <u>Bare</u> <u>here-document</u> <u>terminators</u>

       Perl has allowed you to use a bare here-document terminator "&lt;&lt;" to have the here-document end at the
       first empty line. This practise was deprecated in Perl 5.000; as of Perl 5.28, using a bare here-document
       terminator throws a fatal error.

       You are encouraged to use the explicitly quoted form if you wish to use an empty line as the terminator
       of the here-document:

         print &lt;&lt;"";
           Print this line.

         # Previous blank line ends the here-document.

       <u>Setting</u> <u>$/</u> <u>to</u> <u>a</u> <u>reference</u> <u>to</u> <u>a</u> <u>non-positive</u> <u>integer</u>

       You assigned a reference to a scalar to $/ where the referenced item is not a positive integer.  In older
       perls this <b>appeared</b> to work the same as setting it to "undef" but was in fact internally different, less
       efficient and with very bad luck could have resulted in your file being split by a stringified form of
       the reference.

       In Perl 5.20.0 this was changed so that it would be <b>exactly</b> the same as setting $/ to "undef", with the
       exception that this warning would be thrown.

       As of Perl 5.28, setting $/ to a reference to a non-positive integer throws a fatal error.

       You are recommended to change your code to set $/ to "undef" explicitly if you wish to slurp the file.

       <u>Limit</u> <u>on</u> <u>the</u> <u>value</u> <u>of</u> <u>Unicode</u> <u>code</u> <u>points</u>

       Unicode only allows code points up to 0x10FFFF, but Perl allows much larger ones. Up till Perl 5.28, it
       was allowed to use code points exceeding the maximum value of an integer ("IV_MAX").  However, that did
       break the perl interpreter in some constructs, including causing it to hang in a few cases.  The known
       problem areas were in "tr///", regular expression pattern matching using quantifiers, as quote delimiters
       in "q<u>X</u>...<u>X</u>" (where <u>X</u> is the chr() of a large code point), and as the upper limits in loops.

       The use of out of range code points was deprecated in Perl 5.24; as of Perl 5.28 using a code point
       exceeding "IV_MAX" throws a fatal error.

       If your code is to run on various platforms, keep in mind that the upper limit depends on the platform.
       It is much larger on 64-bit word sizes than 32-bit ones. For 32-bit integers, "IV_MAX" equals 0x7FFFFFFF;
       for 64-bit integers, "IV_MAX" equals 0x7FFFFFFFFFFFFFFF.

       <u>Use</u> <u>of</u> <u>comma-less</u> <u>variable</u> <u>list</u> <u>in</u> <u>formats</u>

       It was allowed to use a list of variables in a format, without separating them with commas. This usage
       has been deprecated for a long time, and as of Perl 5.28, this throws a fatal error.

       <u>Use</u> <u>of</u> <u>"\N{}"</u>

       Use of "\N{}" with nothing between the braces was deprecated in Perl 5.24, and throws a fatal error as of
       Perl 5.28.

       Since such a construct is equivalent to using an empty string, you are recommended to remove such "\N{}"
       constructs.

       <u>Using</u> <u>the</u> <u>same</u> <u>symbol</u> <u>to</u> <u>open</u> <u>a</u> <u>filehandle</u> <u>and</u> <u>a</u> <u>dirhandle</u>

       It used to be legal to use open() to associate both a filehandle and a dirhandle to the same symbol (glob
       or scalar).  This idiom is likely to be confusing, and it was deprecated in Perl 5.10.

       Using the same symbol to open() a filehandle and a dirhandle throws a fatal error as of Perl 5.28.

       You should be using two different symbols instead.

       <u>${^ENCODING}</u> <u>is</u> <u>no</u> <u>longer</u> <u>supported</u>

       The special variable "${^ENCODING}" was used to implement the "encoding" pragma. Setting this variable to
       anything other than "undef" was deprecated in Perl 5.22. Full deprecation of the variable happened in
       Perl 5.25.3.

       Setting this variable to anything other than an undefined value throws a fatal error as of Perl 5.28.

       <u>"B::OP::terse"</u>

       This method, which just calls "B::Concise::b_terse", has been deprecated, and disappeared in Perl 5.28.
       Please use B::Concise instead.

       <u>Use</u> <u>of</u> <u>inherited</u> <u>AUTOLOAD</u> <u>for</u> <u>non-method</u> <u>%s::%s()</u> <u>is</u> <u>no</u> <u>longer</u> <u>allowed</u>

       As an (ahem) accidental feature, "AUTOLOAD" subroutines were looked up as methods (using the @ISA
       hierarchy) even when the subroutines to be autoloaded were called as plain functions (e.g. Foo::bar()),
       not as methods (e.g. "Foo-&gt;bar()" or "$obj-&gt;bar()").

       This bug was deprecated in Perl 5.004 and has been rectified in Perl 5.28 by using method lookup only for
       methods' "AUTOLOAD"s.

       The simple rule is:  Inheritance will not work when autoloading non-methods.  The simple fix for old code
       is:  In any module that used to depend on inheriting "AUTOLOAD" for non-methods from a base class named
       "BaseClass", execute "*AUTOLOAD = \&amp;BaseClass::AUTOLOAD" during startup.

       In code that currently says "use AutoLoader; @ISA = qw(AutoLoader);" you should remove AutoLoader from
       @ISA and change "use AutoLoader;" to "use AutoLoader 'AUTOLOAD';".

       <u>In</u> <u>XS</u> <u>code,</u> <u>use</u> <u>of</u> <u>to_utf8_case()</u>

       This function has been removed as of Perl 5.28; instead convert to call the appropriate one of:
       "toFOLD_utf8_safe".  "toLOWER_utf8_safe", "toTITLE_utf8_safe", or "toUPPER_utf8_safe".

   <b>Perl</b> <b>5.26</b>
       <u>"--libpods"</u> <u>in</u> <u>"Pod::Html"</u>

       Since Perl 5.18, the option "--libpods" has been deprecated, and using this option did not do anything
       other than producing a warning.

       The "--libpods" option is no longer recognized as of Perl 5.26.

       <u>The</u> <u>utilities</u> <u>"c2ph"</u> <u>and</u> <u>"pstruct"</u>

       These old, perl3-era utilities have been deprecated in favour of "h2xs" for a long time. As of Perl 5.26,
       they have been removed.

       <u>Trapping</u> <u>$SIG{</u><b>__</b><u>DIE</u><b>__</b><u>}</u> <u>other</u> <u>than</u> <u>during</u> <u>program</u> <u>exit</u>

       The $SIG{__DIE__} hook is called even inside an eval(). It was never intended to happen this way, but an
       implementation glitch made this possible. This used to be deprecated, as it allowed strange action at a
       distance like rewriting a pending exception in $@. Plans to rectify this have been scrapped, as users
       found that rewriting a pending exception is actually a useful feature, and not a bug.

       Perl never issued a deprecation warning for this; the deprecation was by documentation policy only. But
       this deprecation has been lifted as of Perl 5.26.

       <u>Malformed</u> <u>UTF-8</u> <u>string</u> <u>in</u> <u>"%s"</u>

       This message indicates a bug either in the Perl core or in XS code. Such code was trying to find out if a
       character, allegedly stored internally encoded as UTF-8, was of a given type, such as being punctuation
       or a digit.  But the character was not encoded in legal UTF-8.  The %s is replaced by a string that can
       be used by knowledgeable people to determine what the type being checked against was.

       Passing malformed strings was deprecated in Perl 5.18, and became fatal in Perl 5.26.

   <b>Perl</b> <b>5.24</b>
       <u>Use</u> <u>of</u> <u>*glob{FILEHANDLE}</u>

       The use of *glob{FILEHANDLE} was deprecated in Perl 5.8.  The intention was to use *glob{IO} instead, for
       which *glob{FILEHANDLE} is an alias.

       However, this feature was undeprecated in Perl 5.24.

       <u>Calling</u> <u>POSIX::%s()</u> <u>is</u> <u>deprecated</u>

       The following functions in the "POSIX" module are no longer available: "isalnum", "isalpha", "iscntrl",
       "isdigit", "isgraph", "islower", "isprint", "ispunct", "isspace", "isupper", and "isxdigit".  The
       functions are buggy and don't work on UTF-8 encoded strings.  See their entries in POSIX for more
       information.

       The functions were deprecated in Perl 5.20, and removed in Perl 5.24.

   <b>Perl</b> <b>5.16</b>
       <u>Use</u> <u>of</u> <u>%s</u> <u>on</u> <u>a</u> <u>handle</u> <u>without</u> <u>*</u> <u>is</u> <u>deprecated</u>

       It used to be possible to use "tie", "tied" or "untie" on a scalar while the scalar holds a typeglob.
       This caused its filehandle to be tied. It left no way to tie the scalar itself when it held a typeglob,
       and no way to untie a scalar that had had a typeglob assigned to it.

       This was deprecated in Perl 5.14, and the bug was fixed in Perl 5.16.

       So now "tie $scalar" will always tie the scalar, not the handle it holds.  To tie the handle, use "tie
       *$scalar" (with an explicit asterisk).  The same applies to "tied *$scalar" and "untie *$scalar".
