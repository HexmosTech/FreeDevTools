</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       sfxload, asfxload - load a SoundFont file on the Emux WaveTable

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>sfxload</b> [<u>-options</u>] <u>fontfile</u>

       <b>asfxload</b> [<u>-options</u>] <u>fontfile</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>sfxload</b>  and <b>asfxload</b> are utility program sto transfer the sound wave and instruments data in a SoundFont
       file to the AWE32 sound driver, or to the Emux WaveTable of ALSA sbawe and emu10k1 drivers.  This program
       is necessary for playing MIDI samples via sequencer programs supporting AWE  driver.   There  is  no  big
       difference  between  <b>sfxload</b>  and  <b>asfxload</b>  except for that <b>asfxload</b> is for ALSA and <b>sfxload</b> is for OSS,
       respectively. The options to specify devices are different between them (see below).

       Basically, sfxload behaves as two ways.
                 % sfxload fontfile
                 % sfxload -b1 fontfile

       The first usage is to read SF2 (or SBK) file and transfer to the awe driver.  In this case,  the  samples
       which  were  loaded  on  the driver are replaced with the new one.  In the second case, sfxload reads the
       file and appends it to the pre-loaded samples on the driver with specified bank number.  The old  samples
       remain in the driver.  The additional samples can be cleared via <b>-x</b> option (see below).

       The  sound  files  are  searched  through  the  path list.  The path list is defined as built-in.  If the
       environment variable <b>SFBANKDIR</b> or the command line option <b>-P</b> is given, it  replaces  the  default  search
       list.  The file extension <u>.sf2</u>, and <u>.sbk</u> can be abbreviated.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-F,</b> <b>--device=</b><u>file</u> (sfxload only)
              Specify the device file to be used.  Default value is <u>/dev/sequencer</u>.

       <b>-D,</b> <b>--index=</b><u>number</u> (sfxload only)
              Specify  the  device  index of AWE driver.  Negative number (e.g. -1) means to probe the first AWE
              device automatically.  For selecting the other AWE cards, a positive index number  must  be  given
              here.  Default value is <b>-1</b>.

       <b>-D,</b> <b>--hwdep=</b><u>name</u> (asfxload only)
              Specify  the  hwdep  name  to be used.  As default, asfxload seeks until any Emux compatible hwdep
              device is found.

       <b>-i,</b> <b>--clear</b>[=<u>bool</u>]
              Remove all samples before loading the fonts.  This is an explicit directive (see -b  option).   If
              this  option  is  specified  alone  without  soundfont  file  arguments, sfxload does onlay remove
              samples.  Either of <b>on</b>, <b>off</b>, <b>yes</b>, <b>no</b>, <b>true</b>, or <b>false</b> can be specified as an optional argument.

       <b>-x,</b> <b>--remove</b>[=<u>bool</u>]
              Remove the optional samples previously loaded via <b>-b</b>  option.   Otherwise,  all  new  samples  are
              simply appended.

       <b>-N,</b> <b>--increment</b>[=<u>bool</u>]
              Do  not  clear  samples even with the absence of <b>-b</b> option.  However, this option is not exclusive
              with <b>-x</b> option. If both options are specified, and the memory full  error  is  encountered  during
              loading fonts, <b>sfxload</b> will try to remove samples and load the fonts again.

       <b>-b,</b> <b>--bank=</b><u>number</u>
              Append  the  sound samples on the specified bank.  Without this option, all present samples in the
              driver are removed before loading the new fonts unless  <b>-N</b>  option  is  specified.  Usually,  this
              option is necessary to load user bank, typically in bank one.  For example,
                        % sfxload synthgm.sbk
                        % sfxload -b1 surprise.sf2

       <b>-l,</b> <b>--lock</b>[=<u>bool</u>]
              Lock  the  font.   The locked font is no longer removed via remove option (<b>-x</b>) even if it's loaded
              together with <b>-b</b> option.

       <b>-C,</b> <b>--compat</b>[=<u>bool</u>]
              Use the old (v0.4.2) parameter calculations.

       <b>-A,</b> <b>--sense=</b><u>sensitivity</u>
              (Only valid on compatible mode)
              Set sample attenuation sensitivity.  This option controls the sensitivity of  initial  attenuation
              parameter  of  each  instrument  defined  in  SoundFont  file.   In the program, each parameter is
              calculated from the value divided by this number for the original value.   The  number  <u>1.0</u>  means
              that  the  original initial attenuation parameters would be used.  Generally, smaller number makes
              drum sounds louder.  (I think <b>"-A</b> <b>2"</b> would be similar to Windows sounds.)  The  default  value  is
              <u>10</u>.  Note that this option changes also the default attenuation automatically (see below).

       <b>-a,</b> <b>--atten=</b><u>attenuation</u>
              (Only valid on compatible mode)
              Set  the  default  attenuation level.  This option controls the minimum attenuation of the sample.
              The parameter is given in raw digit number for AWE driver, that is, in 8/3 dB unit.  Since <b>--sense</b>
              option changes the default attenuation automatically,  specify  this  option  later  from  <b>--sense</b>
              option.  The default value is <u>32</u>.

       <b>-d,</b> <b>--decay=</b><u>scale</u>
              (Only valid on compatible mode)
              Set  the  scale  of  envelope  decay  time.  Default value is <u>50.0</u>.  Sounds decay fast when larger
              number is set.  The ver.0.3 sfxload uses <u>54.8</u>.  If you want to  keep  the  same  sound,  use  this
              number instead.

       <b>-M,</b> <b>--memory</b>[=<u>bool</u>]
              Display the left memory size in DRAM on the AWE32 card.

       <b>-c,</b> <b>--chorus=</b><u>percent</u>
              Specify  the  effects  of  chorus.   The  value  is  in  percent,  from  0 to 100.  The default is
              unspecified.  This value may be overwritten by MIDI control messages.

       <b>-r,</b> <b>--reverb=</b><u>percent</u>
              Specify the effects of reverb.  The  value  is  in  percent,  from  0  to  100.   The  default  is
              unspecified.  This value may be overwritten by MIDI control messages.

       <b>-B,</b> <b>--addblank</b>[=<u>bool</u>]
              Add  48  size  of blank loop on each sample data.  Usually, this option is not necessary.  Most of
              soundfont files are designed well for enough blank loops for each sample.

       <b>-L,</b> <b>--extract=</b><u>source</u>[:<u>map</u>]
              Extract and load only the specified preset(s).  This option is usually employed by  drvmidi.   The
              preset is given as same as in virtual bank file.

       <b>-v,</b> <b>--verbose</b>[=<u>level</u>]
              Increase or set the verbosity level.

       <b>-q,</b> <b>--quiet</b>
              Don't show error messages, equivalent with --verbose=0.

       <b>-V,</b> <b>--volume=</b><u>percent</u>
              Specify the total volume of sounds, provided in percent.  The default volume is <u>70%</u>.

       <b>-P,</b> <b>--path=</b><u>path1</u><b>:</b><u>path2</u><b>:</b><u>pathN</u>
              Specify  the  search  path list.  The sound files are searched from <u>path1</u>, <u>path2</u>, and so on.  This
              overrides both the system path and environment variable <b>SFBANKDIR</b>.

</pre><h4><b>VIRTUAL</b> <b>BANK</b> <b>FILE</b></h4><pre>
       The virtual bank file is a list of presets treated as one soundfont file.  The syntax of virtual bank  is
       as follows:
                      # comments
                      source:map[:soundfont [preset-name]
                      source:map[:soundfont [preset-name]
                      ...

       The  first  and second items are the source and mapped presets, respectively.  The former is the existing
       preset in the soundfont, and the latter is the actual preset loaded on the sound driver.  The  preset  is
       described by the following three values,
                      preset/bank/keynote
       If bank and keynote are omitted, bank 0 and keynote -1 (meaning to search all keys) are applied.

       The third item is the name of soundfont file.  The file is searched from the prescribed search-path.  The
       remaining arguments are ignored in <b>sfxload</b>.

       If  the  soundfont  name is omitted, sfxload loads it as preset mapping.  It just behaves like a symbolic
       link of file opposing to copying of the file.  Any sample data is not referred at this time, but searched
       first when the note is played.

       A couple of special commands can be used together with the virtual presets  above.   <b>default</b>  command  is
       used  to  specify  the  default  soundfont  file.  Any other presets which are not defined in the virtual
       preset lists are loaded from this default font.  For example, in the following virtual bank,  <u>2mbgmgs.sf2</u>
       is used except for standard drumsets which employs <u>drum.sf2</u>:
                      0/128:0/128:drum.sf2
                      default 2mbgmgs.sf2

       Another  special  command  is  <b>include</b> command.  This simply includes another virtual bank file under the
       current position. For example,
                      default standard.sf2
                      0/128:0/128:drum.sf2
                      include xgsfx.bnk

</pre><h4><b>SYSTEM</b> <b>RESROUCE</b> <b>FILE</b></h4><pre>
       The default option arguments can be stored in the system resource file.  There are two  files  loaded  as
       default.
                 <u>$HOME/.sfxloadrc</u>
                 <u>/etc/sfxloadrc</u>

       The syntax is as follows:
                 fontname -options..
       The  first  argument  is soundfont file name for each option.  The remaining arguments are identical with
       command line options.  The font name <u>default</u> is used for  default  options  for  all  sound  fonts.   The
       default options are overridden by specific options or command line options.

       For  example,  to  set  default  chorus  level  20 except for synthgm font, you can write a resource file
       <u><a href="file:~/.sfxloadrc">~/.sfxloadrc</a></u> like that:
                 default   --chorus=20
                 synthgm --chorus=0

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>SFBANKDIR</b>
              Search path for sound files.  The current directory is always searched at first.
