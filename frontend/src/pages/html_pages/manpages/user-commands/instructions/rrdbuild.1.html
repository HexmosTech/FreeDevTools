       rrdbuild - Instructions for building RRDtool

</pre><h4><b>OVERVIEW</b></h4><pre>
       If you downloaded the source of RRDtool you have to compile it. This document will give some information
       on how this is done.

       RRDtool relies on services of third part libraries. Some of these libraries may already be installed on
       your system. You have to compile copies of the other ones before you can build RRDtool.

       This document will tell you about all the necessary steps to get going.

       These instructions assume you are using a <b>bash</b> shell. If you use csh/tcsh, then you can either type <u>bash</u>
       to switch to bash for the compilation or if you know what you are doing just replace the export bits with
       setenv.

       We further assume that your copies of <b>tar</b> and <b>make</b> are actually <b>GNU</b> <b>tar</b> and <b>GNU</b> <b>make</b> respectively. It
       could be that they are installed as <b>gtar</b> and <b>gmake</b> on your system.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIMISTIC</b> <b>BUILD</b></h4><pre>
       Before you start to build RRDtool, you have to decide two things:

       1.  In which directory you want to build the software.

       2.  Where you want to install the software.

       Once you have decided. Save the two locations into environment variables.

        BUILD_DIR=/tmp/rrdbuild
        INSTALL_DIR=/opt/rrdtool-1.7.2

       If  your  <u><a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a></u>  is  mounted with the option noexec (RHEL seems to do that) you have to choose a different
       directory!

       Now make sure the BUILD_DIR exists and go there:

        mkdir -p $BUILD_DIR
        cd $BUILD_DIR

       Lets first assume you already have all the necessary libraries pre-installed.

        wget https://oss.oetiker.ch/rrdtool/pub/rrdtool-1.7.2.tar.gz
        gunzip -c rrdtool-1.7.2.tar.gz | tar xf -
        cd rrdtool-1.7.2
        ./configure --prefix=$INSTALL_DIR &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make install

       Ok, this was very optimistic. This try will probably have ended with <b>configure</b> complaining about  several
       missing libraries.

</pre><h4><b>INSTALLING</b> <b>DEPENDENCIES</b></h4><pre>
       If  your  OS  lets  you  install  additional  packages  from a software repository, you may get away with
       installing the missing packages. When the packages are installed, run configure again and try to  compile
       again. Below you find some hints on getting your OS ready for compiling RRDtool.

       Additions  to  this  list  are  welcome.  In  general RRDtool should work with the latest versions of the
       libraries. The versions listed here are just what was current when I tested this.

   <b>OpenSolaris</b> <b>2008.05</b>
       Just add a compiler and the gnome development package:

        pkg install sunstudioexpress
        pkg install SUNWgnome-common-devel

       There is a problem with <u>cairo.pc</u> on OpenSolaris. It suggests that xrender  is  required  for  compilation
       with cairo. This is not true and also bad since OpenSolaris does not include an <u>xrender.pc</u> file. Use Perl
       to fix this:

        perl -i~ -p -e 's/(Requires.*?)\s*xrender.*/$1/' /usr/lib/pkgconfig/cairo.pc

       Make sure the RRDtool build system finds your new compiler

        export PATH=/opt/SunStudioExpress/bin

   <b>Debian</b> <b>/</b> <b>Ubuntu</b>
       Use  apt-get  to  make  sure  you  have all that is required. A number of packages will get added through
       dependencies.

        apt-get install libpango1.0-dev libxml2-dev

   <b>Gentoo</b>
       In Gentoo installing RRDtool is really simple you just need to <b>emerge</b> <b>rrdtool</b>. All dependencies  will  be
       handled  automatically  by  the portage system. The only thing you should care about are USE flags, which
       allow you fine tune features RRDtool will be built with. Currently the following USE flags are available:

        doc    - install .html and .txt documentation
                 into /usr/share/doc/rrdtool-1.x.xx/
        perl   - build and install perl language bindings
        python - build and install python language bindings
        ruby   - build and install ruby language bindings
        tcl    - build and install tcl language bindings
        rrdcgi - build and install rrdcgi

       After you've decided which USE flags you need, set them either in <u>make.conf</u>  or  <u>/etc/portage/package.use</u>
       and finally run:

        # emerge -va rrdtool

       Take   a   look   at   Gentoo   handbook   for   further   details   on   how   to   manage   USE  flags:
       <a href="http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/handbook/handbook-x86.xml">http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/handbook/handbook-x86.xml</a>?part=2

</pre><h4><b>BUILDING</b> <b>DEPENDENCIES</b></h4><pre>
       But again this may have been too optimistic still, and you actually have to compile your  own  copies  of
       some of the required libraries. Things like libpng and zlib are pretty standard so you will probably have
       them  on  your  system anyway. Freetype, Fontinst, Cairo, Pango may be installed, but it is possible that
       they are pretty old and thus don't live up to our expectations, so you may want to compile  their  latest
       versions.

   <b>General</b> <b>build</b> <b>tips</b> <b>for</b> <b>AIX</b>
       If you are working with AIX, you may find the <b>--disable-shared</b> option will cause things to break for you.
       In  that  case  you  may  have  to  install  the  shared  libraries into the RRDtool PREFIX and work with
       <b>--disable-static</b> instead.

       Another hint to get RRDtool working on AIX is to use the IBM XL C Compiler:

        export CC=/usr/vac/bin/cc
        export PERLCC=$CC

       (Better instructions for AIX welcome!)

   <b>Build</b> <b>Instructions</b>
       Some libraries want to know where other libraries are. For this to work, set  the  following  environment
       variable

        export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=${INSTALL_DIR}/lib/pkgconfig
        export PATH=$INSTALL_DIR/bin:$PATH

       The  above relies on the presence of the <u>pkgconfig</u> program. Below you find instructions on how to compile
       pkgconfig.

       Since we are compiling libraries dynamically, they must know where to find each other. This  is  done  by
       setting an appropriate LDFLAGS. Unfortunately, the syntax again differs from system to system:

       Solaris
            export LDFLAGS=-R${INSTALL_DIR}<a href="file:/lib">/lib</a>

           if you are using the Sun Studio/Forte compiler, you may also want to set

            CFLAGS="-xO3 -xcode=pic13"   (SPARC)
            CFLAGS="-xO3 -Kpic"          (x86)

       Linux
            export LDFLAGS="-Wl,--rpath -Wl,${INSTALL_DIR}<a href="file:/lib">/lib</a>"

       HPUX
            export LDFLAGS="+b${INSTALL_DIR}<a href="file:/lib">/lib</a>"

       AIX
            export LDFLAGS="-Wl,-blibpath:${INSTALL_DIR}<a href="file:/lib">/lib</a>"

       If you have GNU make installed and it is not called 'make', then do

        export MAKE=gmake
        export GNUMAKE=gmake

       otherwise just do

        export MAKE=make

       <u>Building</u> <u>pkgconfig</u>

       As mentioned above, without pkgconfig the whole build process will be lots of pain and suffering, so make
       sure you have a copy on your system. If it is not available natively, here is how to compile it.

        wget <a href="http://pkgconfig.freedesktop.org/releases/pkg-config-0.23.tar.gz">http://pkgconfig.freedesktop.org/releases/pkg-config-0.23.tar.gz</a>
        gunzip -c pkg-config-0.23.tar.gz | tar xf -
        cd pkg-config-0.23
        ./configure --prefix=$INSTALL_DIR CFLAGS="-O3 -fPIC"
        $MAKE
        $MAKE install

       After  installing pkgconfig in a custom directory, setting up the corresponding environment variable will
       be helpful.

        export PKG_CONFIG=$INSTALL_DIR/bin/pkg-config

       <u>Building</u> <u>zlib</u>

       Chances are very high that you already have that on your system ...

        cd $BUILD_DIR
        wget https://oss.oetiker.ch/rrdtool/pub/libs/zlib-1.2.3.tar.gz
        gunzip -c zlib-1.2.3.tar.gz | tar xf -
        cd zlib-1.2.3
        ./configure --prefix=$INSTALL_DIR CFLAGS="-O3 -fPIC" --shared
        $MAKE
        $MAKE install

       <u>Building</u> <u>libpng</u>

       Libpng itself requires zlib to build, so we need to help a bit. If you already have a  copy  of  zlib  on
       your  system  (which  is  very  likely)  you can drop the settings of LDFLAGS and CPPFLAGS. Note that the
       backslash (\) at the end of lines means that the command is split over multiple lines.

        cd $BUILD_DIR
        wget https://oss.oetiker.ch/rrdtool/pub/libs/libpng-1.2.18.tar.gz
        gunzip -c libpng-1.2.18.tar.gz | tar xf -
        cd libpng-1.2.18
        env CFLAGS="-O3 -fPIC" ./configure --prefix=$INSTALL_DIR
        $MAKE
        $MAKE install

       <u>Building</u> <u>freetype</u>

        cd $BUILD_DIR
        wget https://oss.oetiker.ch/rrdtool/pub/libs/freetype-2.3.5.tar.gz
        gunzip -c freetype-2.3.5.tar.gz | tar xf -
        cd freetype-2.3.5
        ./configure --prefix=$INSTALL_DIR CFLAGS="-O3 -fPIC"
        $MAKE
        $MAKE install

       If you run into problems building freetype on Solaris, you may want to try to add the  following  at  the
       start the configure line:

        env EGREP=egrep

       <u>Building</u> <u>LibXML2</u>

        cd $BUILD_DIR
        wget https://oss.oetiker.ch/rrdtool/pub/libs/libxml2-2.6.32.tar.gz
        gunzip -c libxml2-2.6.32.tar.gz | tar xf -
        cd libxml2-2.6.32
        ./configure --prefix=$INSTALL_DIR CFLAGS="-O3 -fPIC"
        $MAKE
        $MAKE install

       <u>Building</u> <u>fontconfig</u>

       Note  that fontconfig has a run time configuration file in INSTALL_DIR/etc you may want to adjust that so
       that fontconfig finds the fonts on your system.  Run the fc-cache program to build the  fontconfig  cache
       after changing the config file.

        cd $BUILD_DIR
        wget https://oss.oetiker.ch/rrdtool/pub/libs/fontconfig-2.4.2.tar.gz
        gunzip -c fontconfig-2.4.2.tar.gz   | tar xf -
        cd fontconfig-2.4.2
        ./configure --prefix=$INSTALL_DIR CFLAGS="-O3 -fPIC" --with-freetype-config=$INSTALL_DIR/bin/freetype-config
        $MAKE
        $MAKE install

       <u>Building</u> <u>Pixman</u>

        cd $BUILD_DIR
        wget https://oss.oetiker.ch/rrdtool/pub/libs/pixman-0.10.0.tar.gz
        gunzip -c pixman-0.10.0.tar.gz  | tar xf -
        cd pixman-0.10.0
        ./configure --prefix=$INSTALL_DIR CFLAGS="-O3 -fPIC"
        $MAKE
        $MAKE install

       <u>Building</u> <u>Cairo</u>

        cd $BUILD_DIR
        wget https://oss.oetiker.ch/rrdtool/pub/libs/cairo-1.6.4.tar.gz
        gunzip -c cairo-1.6.4.tar.gz   | tar xf -
        cd cairo-1.6.4
        ./configure --prefix=$INSTALL_DIR \
           --enable-xlib=no \
           --enable-xlib-render=no \
           --enable-win32=no \
           CFLAGS="-O3 -fPIC"
        $MAKE
        $MAKE install

       When building on Solaris you may want to do

        ./configure --prefix=$INSTALL_DIR \
           --enable-xlib=no \
           --enable-xlib-render=no \
           --enable-win32=no \
           CFLAGS="-O3 -fPIC -D_POSIX_PTHREAD_SEMANTICS"

       <u>Building</u> <u>Glib</u>

        cd $BUILD_DIR
        wget https://oss.oetiker.ch/rrdtool/pub/libs/glib-2.15.4.tar.gz
        gunzip -c glib-2.15.4.tar.gz  | tar xf -
        cd glib-2.15.4
        ./configure --prefix=$INSTALL_DIR CFLAGS="-O3 -fPIC"
        $MAKE
        $MAKE install

       <u>Building</u> <u>Pango</u>

        cd $BUILD_DIR
        wget https://oss.oetiker.ch/rrdtool/pub/libs/pango-1.21.1.tar.bz2
        bunzip2 -c pango-1.21.1.tar.bz2 | tar xf -
        cd pango-1.21.1
        ./configure --prefix=$INSTALL_DIR CFLAGS="-O3 -fPIC" --without-x
        $MAKE
        $MAKE install

   <b>Building</b> <b>rrdtool</b> <b>(second</b> <b>try)</b>
       Now  all  the  dependent libraries are built and you can try again. This time you tell configure where it
       should be looking for libraries and include files. This is done via environment variables.  Depending  on
       the shell you are running, the syntax for setting environment variables is different.

       And  finally  try  building  again.  We  disable the python and tcl bindings because it seems that a fair
       number of people have ill configured python and tcl setups that would prevent RRDtool  from  building  if
       they are included in their current state.

        cd $BUILD_DIR/rrdtool-1.7.2
        ./configure --prefix=$INSTALL_DIR --disable-tcl --disable-python
        $MAKE clean
        $MAKE
        $MAKE install

       SOLARIS  HINT:  if you want to build  the Perl module for the native Perl (the one shipping with Solaris)
       you  will  need  the  Sun  Forte  compiler  installed  on   your   box   or   you   have   to   hand-tune
       bindings/perl-shared/Makefile while building!

       Now go to <u>$INSTALL_DIR</u><b>/share/rrdtool/examples/</b> and run them to see if your build has been successful.
