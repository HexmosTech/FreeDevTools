</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       vorbisgain - calculate the replay gain for Ogg Vorbis files

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>vorbisgain</b> [ <b>-acCdfhqrsv</b> ] [ <b>-g</b> <u>album</u> <u>gain</u> ] <u>input_files</u> ...

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>vorbisgain</b>  calculates  the  ReplayGain  values  for the named Ogg Vorbis input files and writes back the
       result in the form of tags (comments) in the file. These values can be used  by  a  playback  program  to
       maintain  a  uniform  sound  level  during  play.  (See <a href="http://www.replaygain.org/">http://www.replaygain.org/</a> for more information.)
       <b>vorbisgain</b> uses a default target level of 89 dB, rather than the 83  dB  recommended  by  the  ReplayGain
       standard,  when  calculating  the  gain  to apply. (Some players include a pre-amplification setting with
       which the target level can be changed.)

       <b>vorbisgain</b> input files must be Ogg Vorbis I files with 1 or 2 channels and a sample rate of 48 kHz,  44.1
       kHz,  32  kHz,  24  kHz,  22050 Hz, 16 kHz, 12 kHz, 11025 Hz or 8 kHz. If an input file contains multiple
       streams (i.e., it is chained), the streams must all have the same format, in terms of sampling  frequency
       and number of channels.

       All  streams  in  a  chained  file are processed, but the ReplayGain tags are only written to (or removed
       from) the first stream.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       -h, --help
              Show command help.

       -a, --album
              Activates album mode, in which the album gain (sometimes called the audiophile gain) is calculated
              in addition to the track gain (sometimes called the radio gain).

       -g n, --album-gain=n
              Sets the album gain value to use. Default is to calculate it, if <u>-a</u> is specified.  Implies  <u>-a</u>  in
              the  sense  that  the  album  gain tag is written. This is a relative value, in dB, specifying the
              <b>change</b> in volume that should be applied.

       -c, --clean
              Remove any ReplayGain tags from the specified files. If a file does  not  contain  any  ReplayGain
              tags, the file is not modified.

       -C, --convert
              Convert  old format ReplayGain tags to a new format (see section TAG FORMAT below for details). If
              a file does not contain all ReplayGain tags that are needed for a  conversion,  the  file  is  not
              modified.  The album peak tag is only created if <u>-a</u> is specified, and the album gain value is then
              checked for consistency.  Otherwise any album gain is converted without any checks.

       -d, --display-only
              Display the result only; do not write anything to disk. This applies to all options.

       -f, --fast
              Only calculate the gain for files that do not contain all replay gain tags needed (the album  gain
              and peak tags are only considered if <u>-a</u> has been specified).

       -n, --no-progress
              Only  display results, but don't show progress in percentages and times. This can be useful if the
              output is piped into other programs.

       -p, --preserve-mtime
              Do not trample upon the timestamps of any files being worked on.  This obeys the expected data-vs-
              metadata behaviour, but can confuse some naive archivers.

       -q, --quiet
              Do not display any output while processing. Only error and warning messages will be printed.

       -r, --recursive
              Enter directories (recursively) and  search  for  files,  if  directories  or  file  patterns  are
              specified.  <u>Note:</u> Only available if <b>vorbisgain</b> was configured with --enable-recursive.

       -s, --skip
              Silently skip any non-Vorbis files found. Vorbis files that can't be processed for some reason are
              skipped as well, though not silently. Default is to stop when such files are encountered.

       -v, --version
              Display the version of the program.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Simplest version. Calculate the track gain and peak only.

              vorbisgain somefile.ogg

       Note that the following examples are only possible if <b>vorbisgain</b> was configured with --enable-recursive.

       Calculate  the  album  gain  and  peak, in addition to the track gain and peak, for all .ogg files in the
       directory "music" (and all subdirectories). All files in one directory are treated as  belonging  to  the
       same album. Files that already have ReplayGain tags are not re-calculated. Note the quotes, as they cause
       the shell to not do any filename globbing:

              vorbisgain -s -a -f -r music/

       Calculate  the album gain. The files specified before the directory "album" are treated as one album, the
       files in the directory "album" as another album and the remaining files as a third album:

              vorbisgain -a -r a.ogg b.ogg c.ogg album d.ogg e.ogg f.ogg

       Remove all replaygain tags from a collection of oggs:

              vorbisgain -c -r music/

</pre><h4><b>TAG</b> <b>FORMAT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>vorbisgain</b> creates tags like these (when in <u>-a</u> mode):

              REPLAYGAIN_TRACK_GAIN=-7.03 dB
              REPLAYGAIN_TRACK_PEAK=1.21822226
              REPLAYGAIN_ALBUM_GAIN=-6.37 dB
              REPLAYGAIN_ALBUM_PEAK=1.21822226

       Gain specifies how much the volume should be changed before playback, in dB.  Peak is the maximum  sample
       value  of  the  file  before  any gain has been applied, where 1.0 means "full sample value" (32,767 when
       decoding to signed 16 bit samples).

       Earlier versions of <b>vorbisgain</b> (before 0.30) created the following tags:

              RG_RADIO
              RG_PEAK
              RG_AUDIOPHILE

       When <u>-c</u> is used, RG_RADIO  is  converted  to  REPLAYGAIN_TRACK_GAIN,  RG_PEAK  to  REPLAYGAIN_TRACK_PEAK,
       RG_AUDIOPHILE  to  REPLAYGAIN_ALBUM_GAIN  and  REPLAYGAIN_ALBUM_PEAK  is calculated as the maximum of all
       RG_PEAK tags in the album.

</pre><h4><b>NOTE</b></h4><pre>
       The version of vorbisgain packaged for Debian differs in two ways from the upstream  version.  First,  it
       does  not  retain  the modification time of the input file by default: if tags are changed in a file, the
       mtime will change; you can specify "-p" to get the normal behaviour.  Second, it does not try to  process
       wildcards in filenames. This makes it impossible to say "process all foo*.ogg in all subdirectories", but
       also  avoids  problems  with filenames that actually contain wildcards.  Without this change, "vorbisgain
       *.ogg" in a directory with a file that contains a question mark would result in that file  being  treated
       as being in a different album.
