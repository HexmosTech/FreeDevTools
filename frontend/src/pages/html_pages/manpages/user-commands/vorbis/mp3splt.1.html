</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       mp3splt, oggsplt, flacsplt - utility for mp3, ogg vorbis and native flac splitting without decoding

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>mp3splt</b> <b>[OPTIONS]</b> <b>FILE_OR_DIR1</b> <b>[FILE_OR_DIR2]</b> <b>...</b> <b>[BEGIN_TIME]</b> <b>[TIME2]</b> <b>...</b> <b>[END_TIME]</b>

       <b>FILE_OR_DIR</b>:  mp3, ogg vorbis, native flac file to be split or a directory.  If you want to specify STDIN
       as input, you can use "m-" (or "-") when input  is  mp3,  and  "o-"  when  ogg.  Multiple  files  can  be
       specified, all files will be split with the same criterion. If a directory is specified, a recursive scan
       is performed in that directory to find out all the supported file formats.

       <b>TIME</b> <b>FORMAT</b>:

       <b>minutes.seconds[.hundredths]</b> or <b>EOF-minutes.seconds[.hundredths]</b>

              <b>Minutes</b>  (required): There is no limit to minutes. (You must use this format also for minutes over
              59)

              <b>Seconds</b> (required): Must be between 0 and 59.

              <b>Hundredths</b>  (optional): Must be between 0 and 99. Use them for higher precision.

       Multiple split points can be specified. After the minimal 2, another indefinite number  of  split  points
       can  be  specified. Each split point will be an end time for the previous, and a begin for the following.
       If  you  want  to  reach  the  end  of  file,   you   can   use   "EOF"   as   last   splitpoint.    EOF-
       minutes.seconds[.hundredths] only works when input is seekable.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>mp3splt</b>  is  a  free  command-line utility that allows you to split mp3, ogg vorbis and native flac files
       from several splitpoints, without need of decoding and reencoding.  It is useful to split large mp3,  ogg
       vorbis and native flac to make smaller files or to split entire albums to obtain original tracks.

       If  you  are  splitting  an  album  you  can  get splitpoints and filenames automatically from servers on
       internet like freedb.org, tracktype.org or from a local .XMCD (.CDDB) or .CUE file (see -c option),  with
       the possibility to adjust them automatically with silence detection (see -a option).

       You  can  also  try to split files automatically with silence detection (see -s option), trim files using
       silence detection (see -r option), or by a fixed time length (see -t option)

       Or if you have a file created either with Mp3Wrap or AlbumWrap, you can easily split  it  just  with  one
       command (see -w option).

       <b>IMPORTANT</b>  <b>NOTE</b>  <b>for</b>  <b>FLAC:</b>  FLAC  support  is  still experimental. Please use with caution. Missing FLAC
       features are stdin (input not seekable) and stdout.

       <b>NOTE</b> <b>for</b> <b>MP3:</b> usually mp3splt understands if mp3 is VBR by checking the presence of a Xing or Info header
       and will consequently start in framemode, but if this is not present,  mp3splt  will  start  in  standard
       mode.   This means that splitting process will be quicker, but imprecise due to variable bitrate, you can
       split those VBR files only with framemode (see -f option).

       <b>NOTE</b> <b>for</b> <b>OGG:</b> in some cases, mp3splt does not manage to split ogg vorbis streams correctly. Splitting the
       input file from 0.0 to EOF might fix the issues.

       <b>NOTES</b> <b>about</b> <b>TAGS:</b> by default, mp3splt will put the original tags in the split files with  one  exception:
       the  track  number starts at 1 and is incremented along split files. When copying the original file tags,
       only one artist, album, title are supported.  Custom tags for the split files can  be  set  with  the  -g
       option.   Setting  exactly  the same tags as the original file is possible with -g %[@O] (mp3 only) or -g
       %[@o].

       <b>NOTE</b> <b>about</b> <b>MP3</b> <b>TAGS:</b> in order to extract the original tags from mp3 files, libmp3splt  must  be  compiled
       with 'id3tag' support. By default, the output files will have the same ID3 tag version as the input file;
       this  behaviour  can  be  changed  with the -T option. If the input file has no tags and the -g option is
       used, then both ID3v1 and ID3v2 are written. Total  tracknumber  is  not  yet  supported.   Only  writing
       ID3v2.4  is  supported for custom tags; note that some software only support ID3v2.3 and will not be able
       to read them. However, it is possible to write the exact original tags using %[@O], keeping the same tags
       version as in the original file.

       <b>NOTE</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>OUTPUT</b> <b>DIRECTORY:</b> by default, mp3splt will put the split files in  the  directory  of  the
       input  file. In order to change the output directory, you can use one of the following options: -d or -o.
       Please note that directories from the -o option will be created relative to the input file directory.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-w</b>        <b>Wrap</b> <b>Mode</b>. Use to split file created with:

                 <b>Mp3Wrap</b> <b><a href="http://mp3wrap.sourceforge.net">http://mp3wrap.sourceforge.net</a></b>: This tool joins two or more  mp3  files  in  one  large
                 playable  file  that  usually  contains the string MP3WRAP in filename and a special comment in
                 ID3v2. If the file you are splitting is a Mp3Wrap file the splitting process will be very  fast
                 and you will obtain all files just with one command.  If your filename contains MP3WRAP and you
                 have errors or you don't want to use wrap mode, just remove it from the file.

                 <b>AlbumWrap</b>:  mp3splt  is  compatible also with albumwrap files, which usually contain the string
                 ALBW in filename and ID3v2 contains AlbumWrap.  But, as AlbumWrap  extractor,  mp3splt  doesn't
                 give any warranty.

       <b>-l</b>        <b>List</b>  <b>mode</b>  (Only  for  Wrap mode).  Lists all tracks wrapped in a Mp3Wrap or AlbumWrap archive
                 without any extraction.  Use this to view the content of the file or to test if file is a valid
                 wrapped file.

       <b>-e</b>        <b>Error</b> <b>mode</b> (mp3 only).  It is useful to split large file  derivated  from  a  concatenation  of
                 smaller  files.  It  detects  split  points  from  the so called "sync errors" (data that break
                 stream, such as ID3 or junk data).   Examples  of  applicable  files  are  wrapped  file  (both
                 AlbumWrap and Mp3Wrap) or file created by appending many mp3 files together.  So, when you have
                 a file to split, you should always try to use this option.

       <b>-A</b> <b>AUDACITY_FILE</b>
                 <b>Audacity</b>  <b>labels</b>  <b>mode</b>.   Split  with  splitpoints  from  the  audacity labels file. Example of
                 audacity labels file (in seconds):
                    10.000000 67.000000 first_file
                    67.000000 127.000000 second_file
                    149.000000  206.000000 third_file

       <b>-t</b> <b>TIME[&gt;MIN_TIME]</b>
                 <b>Time</b> <b>mode</b>.  This option will create an indefinite number of smaller files  with  a  fixed  time
                 length  specified  by  TIME  (which has the same format described above). It is useful to split
                 long files into smaller (for example with the time length of a CD). Adjust option (-a)  can  be
                 used  to  adjust  splitpoints  with  silence  detection.  &gt;MIN_TIME  can be used to specify the
                 theoretical minimum track length of the last segment; it allows avoiding to create  very  small
                 files   as  the  last  segment.  Make  sure  to  quote  the  argument  when  using  MIN_TIME  -
                 "TIME&gt;MIN_TIME".

       <b>-S</b> <b>SPLIT_NUMBER</b>
                 <b>Equal</b> <b>time</b> <b>tracks</b> <b>mode</b>.  Split in SPLIT_NUMBER files.

       <b>-r</b>        <b>Trim</b> <b>using</b> <b>silence</b> <b>detection</b>, to trim using silence detection. To trim using silence  detection
                 we  need to decode files, so this option can be really slow if used with big files.  It accepts
                 some parameters with -p option (see below for a detailed  description):  <u>threshold</u>  level  (th)
                 which  is  the  sound  level  to  be considered silence, <u>min</u> (min) which is the minimum silence
                 length to trigger a trimming; this amount of silence will be kept in  the  split  file  at  the
                 beginning and at the end.

       <b>-s</b>        <b>Silence</b>  <b>mode</b>,  to  split  with  silence detection. When you use -s option, mp3splt attempts to
                 detect silence points in all the file (or just in some parts, see -a and -c below for this). To
                 detect silence we need to decode files, so this option can be really  slow  if  used  with  big
                 files.   It  accepts  some  parameters  with  -p option (see below for a detailed description):
                 <u>threshold</u> level (th) which is the sound level to be considered silence, <u>number</u> of  tracks  (nt)
                 which is the desired number of tracks, cutpoint <u>offset</u> (off) which is the offset of cutpoint in
                 silence,  <u>minimum_length</u>  (min)  which is the minimum silence length in seconds, <u>remove</u> silence
                 (rm) which allows you to remove the silence between split tracks.  If  you  don't  specify  any
                 parameter,  mp3splt  will use the default values. Of course if you specify the number of tracks
                 to split, you will help mp3splt to understand what are the most probable split  points,  anyway
                 once  you scan a file with -s option, mp3splt will write a file named "mp3splt.log" in which it
                 saves all silence points found. If this file exists in the current working  directory,  mp3splt
                 will  read the splitpoints from this file and will not recompute the silence splitpoints.  This
                 allows you to run mp3splt with different parameters (except th and min)  without  decoding  the
                 file  again.  Finally, if the number of silence points is not correct, you have many chances to
                 achieve right result. For example if a silence point was not detected because  too  short,  you
                 can manually split the long track in the two smaller ones.  Or if file is an MP3 (not with ogg)
                 and  there  are  too many silence points that can't be discarded reducing track number (because
                 are longer than right points) you can safely concatenate them with 'cat'  programs  or  similar
                 ('copy  /b  file1+file2'  for  dos) because split files are consecutive, no data is lost.  This
                 option is intended to split small/medium size (but even large if you can wait ;)  mp3  and  ogg
                 files  where tracks are separated by a reasonable silence time. To try to split mixed albums or
                 files with consecutive tracks (such as live performances) might be only a waste of time.

                 <b>Note</b> <b>about</b> <b>"mp3splt.log":</b>

                   The first line contains the name of the split file
                   The second line contains the threshold and the minimum silence length
                   The next lines contain each one three columns:
                       ‐the first column is the start position of the found silence (in seconds.fractions)
                       ‐the second column is the end position of the found silence (in seconds.fractions)
                       ‐the third column is the order of magnitude of the silence length; it is useful  to  find
                 out most probable silence points

       <b>-c</b> <b>SOURCE</b> <b>CDDB</b>  <b>mode</b>.  To  get splitpoints and filenames automatically from SOURCE, that is the name of a
                 ".CUE" file (note that it must end with ".cue", otherwise it will be wrongly interpreted  as  a
                 cddb file) or a local .XMCD (.CDDB) file on your hard disk.

                 Furthermore,  if  you  want  to  split  using  internal  sheets, SOURCE must be <b>internal_sheet</b>.
                 Currently two internal sheets are supported: internal CUE sheet of native FLAC files and  ID3v2
                 chapters  for  MP3  files  (note  that  there  is a limitation on ID3v2 chapters for overlapped
                 chapters).

                 If you want to get informations from Internet, SOURCE must have one of the following formats:

                     <b>query</b>
                     <b>query{album}</b>
                     <b>query{album}(ALBUM_RESULT_NUMBER)</b>
                     <b>query[search=protocol://SITE:PORT,</b> <b>get=protocol://SITE:PORT]</b>
                     <b>query[search...]{album}</b>
                     <b>query[search...]{album}(ALBUM_RESULT_NUMBER)</b>

                 If a string is specified between '{' and '}', then the internet search is made on  this  string
                 and  the user will not be requested to interactively input a search string.  The number between
                 '(' and ')' is for auto-selecting the result number ALBUM_RESULT_NUMBER; thus,  the  user  will
                 not be requested to interactively input a result number.

                 The  other  parameters  between '[' and ']' are used to specify the protocols and the sites. If
                 those parameters are not specified, default values will be chosen, which  are  good  enough  in
                 most  cases.   Inside  the  square brackets, 'search' defines the CDDB search protocol and site
                 (for searching the disc ID from the album and title); 'get' defines the CDDB download  protocol
                 and  site  (for  downloading  the  CDDB  file from the disc ID). Valid 'search' protocols are :
                 'cddb_cgi' and 'cddb_protocol'.  Valid 'get' protocols are: 'cddb_cgi'.

                 Examples:

                   query[search=cddb_cgi://tracktype.org/~cddb/cddb.cgi:80,get=cddb_cgi://tracktype.org/~cddb/cddb.cgi:80]
                   query[get=cddb_protocol://freedb.org:8880]
                   query[get=cddb_cgi://freedb.org/~cddb/cddb.cgi:80]

                 Mp3splt will connect to the server and start to find the requested informations. If  the  right
                 album is found, then mp3splt will query the server to get the selected album and (if no problem
                 occurs) will write a file named "query.cddb" from which will get splitpoints and filenames.

                 <b>Proxy</b>  <b>support:</b> The first time that the user queries the internet (and if the quiet mode is not
                 enabled),  mp3splt  asks  for  some  information  about  proxy   usage.   Mp3splt   has   basic
                 authentification  support  using base64 for HTTP proxies. A file named ´.mp3splt´ is created in
                 the user home directory containing the informations provided by the user.  Deleting  this  file
                 will make mp3splt to query the user again. Please note that the authentification storage is not
                 secure. The 'username:password' is stored as base64 and can be easily decoded.

                 <b>IMPORTANT</b> <b>NOTE</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>CDDB</b>: File split with this option can be not very precise due to:

                 1)  Who  extracts  CD tracks may use "Remove silence" option. This means that the large file is
                 shorter than CD Total time. Never use this option.
                 2) Who burns CD may add extra pause seconds between tracks. Never do it.
                 3) Encoders may add some padding frames so that file is longer than CD.
                 4) There are several entries of the same cd on CDDB. In mp3splt they appears with "\=&gt;" symbol.
                 Try some of them and find the best for yours; usually you can find the correct splitpoints,  so
                 good luck!

                 <b>YOU</b> <b>CAN</b> <b>USE</b> <b>THE</b> <b>-a</b> <b>OPTION</b> <b>TO</b> <b>ADJUST</b> <b>SPLITPOINTS!</b>

       <b>-a</b>        <b>Auto-adjust</b>  <b>mode</b>.   This  option  uses silence detection to auto-adjust splitpoints. It can be
                 used in standard mode, or with -t and -c option (of course if there is silence in the file  ;).
                 It  accepts  some  parameters  with -p option (see below for a detailed description): <u>threshold</u>
                 level (th) which is the sound level to be considered silence, cutpoint <u>offset</u>  (off)  which  is
                 the  offset  of  cutpoint in silence, <u>min</u> (min) which is the minimum silence length in seconds,
                 <u>gap</u> (gap) which is the gap value around splitpoint to search for silence.  If you don't specify
                 any parameter, mp3splt will use the default values.  With -a option splitting  process  is  the
                 same, but for each splitpoint mp3splt will decode some time (gap) before and some after to find
                 silence and adjust splitpoints.

       <b>-p</b> <b>PARAMETERS</b>
                 <b>Parameters</b>  <b>for</b> <b>-a,</b> <b>-s</b> <b>and</b> <b>-r</b> <b>option</b>. When using -a, -s and -r option some users parameters can
                 be specified in the argument and must be in the form:

                 <b>&lt;name1=value,name2=value,..&gt;</b>

                 You can specify an indefinite number of them, with no spaces and separated by comma.  Available
                 parameters are:

       <b>For</b> <b>-s,</b> <b>-a</b> <b>and</b> <b>-r</b>

       <b>th=FLOAT</b>  Threshold  level (dB) to be considered silence. It is a float number between -96 and 0. Default
                 is -48 dB, which is a value found by tests and should be good in most cases.

       <b>shots=INTEGER</b>
                 Positive integer of  the minimum number of shots to be found as non silence after the  silence.
                 Default is 25. Decrease this value if you need to split files having closer silence points.

       <b>min=FLOAT</b> Positive float of the minimum number of seconds to be considered as valid silence. All silences
                 shorter  than  min  are discarded. Default is 0.  For the trim silence split, it is the minimum
                 silence length to trigger a trimming; this amount of silence will be kept in the split file  at
                 the beginning and at the end.

       <b>Both</b> <b>-s</b> <b>and</b> <b>-a</b>

       <b>off=FLOAT</b> Float  number between -2 and 2 and allows you to adjust the offset of cutpoint in silence time.
                 0 is the begin of silence, and 1 the end. Default is 0.8.  In most cases, you will only need to
                 use a value between 0 and 1.

                 Offset visualization:

                                                v off=0    v off=1

                 of the audio file (silence or audio)

       <b>Only</b> <b>-s</b>

       <b>nt=INTEGER</b>
                 Positive integer number of tracks to be split when using -s option. By default all  tracks  are
                 split.

       <b>rm[=FLOAT_FLOAT]</b>
                 It  is used to remove silence when using the -s option.  Can be used without additional numbers
                 - by default it will cut all the silence found.  Users can keep some of the  silence  found  by
                 passing the number of seconds to be kept at the beginning of the output files and at the end of
                 the  output files. For example, 'rm=2_6' will keep 2 seconds of silence at the beginning of the
                 split files and 6 seconds at the end.  If the silence length is less than the sum of the number
                 of seconds passed to the rm parameter, the split will convert the values to a percentage of the
                 silence length. Taking the previous example, if the silence length is less than 8 seconds,  the
                 split  will  be done at 75% of the silence segment starting from the beginning of the silence (
                 75% = 6/(2+6) ).

       <b>trackmin=FLOAT</b>
                 Positive float of the minimum number of seconds for a track to be written out.  Tracks  shorter
                 than trackmin will be skipped during the output phase.  The default value 0.0 means to not skip
                 any tracks.

       <b>trackjoin=FLOAT</b>
                 Positive  float of the minimum number of seconds for a track to be written out.  Tracks shorter
                 than trackjoin will be joined with others. The  main  difference  between  this  parameter  and
                 trackmin  is that using this one, no part of the original file will be lost.  The default value
                 of 0.0 means to not join any tracks.  If using both trackmin and trackjoin, tracks shorter than
                 trackmin will be discarded, but after the join.

       <b>Only</b> <b>-a</b>

       <b>gap=INTEGER</b>
                 Positive integer for the time to decode before and after splitpoint,  increase  if  splitpoints
                 are completely wrong, or decrease if wrong for only few seconds. Of course the smaller the gap,
                 the  faster the process.  Default gap is 30 seconds (so for each song, total decode time is one
                 minute).

       <b>warn_if_no_aa</b>
                 Print a warning for each splitpoint if it has not been auto-adjusted.

       <b>error_if_no_aa</b>
                 Stop the split process with error if one of the splitpoints has not been auto-adjusted.

       <b>-f</b>        <b>Frame</b> <b>mode</b> <b>(mp3</b> <b>only)</b>. Process all frames, seeking split positions by counting frames  and  not
                 with  bitrate  guessing.  In  this  mode  you  have higher precision and you can split variable
                 bitrate (VBR) mp3.  (You can also split costant bitrate mp3, but it will take more time).  Note
                 also  that  "high"  precision  means  that  time  seeking is reliable, but may not coincide for
                 example with another player program that uses time seeking with bitrate guessing, so make  your
                 choice.  Frame mode will print extra info on split process, such as sync errors.  If you obtain
                 some sync errors, try also to split with -e option.

       <b>-b</b>        <b>[Experimental]</b>  <b>Bit</b>  <b>reservoir</b>  <b>handling</b> <b>for</b> <b>gapless</b> <b>playback</b> <b>(mp3</b> <b>only)</b>. Handles bit reservoir
                 issues when splitting mp3 files. This option also allows playback at the exact sample specified
                 by the input time, instead of the music data boundaries. <b>Warning:</b> <b>split</b> <b>files</b> <b>will</b> <b>play</b> <b>gapless</b>
                 <b>only</b> <b>on</b> <b>players</b> <b>supporting</b> <b>mp3</b> <b>gapless</b> <b>playback</b> <b>using</b> <b>the</b> <b>LAME</b> <b>tag</b>  <b>delay</b>  <b>and</b>  <b>padding</b>  <b>values</b>
                 (example of gapless mp3 players: cmus, mpg123, foobar2000).  The feature is heavily inspired by
                 pcutmp3  developed by Sebastian Gesemann.  Use with caution because it is still an experimental
                 feature.

       <b>-k</b>        <b>Input</b> <b>not</b> <b>seekable</b>. Consider input not seekable (default when  using  STDIN  as  input).   This
                 allows  you  to  split  mp3  streams  which can be read only one time and can't be seeked. Both
                 framemode and standard mode are available, but framemode can be really slow if  used  with  big
                 files,  because  to seek splitpoints we need to process all bytes and all frames. -k option (so
                 STDIN as input too) can't be used together with -s -a -w -e, because input must be seekable for
                 those options. Copying original tags is not yet supported for the non seekable option.

       <b>-M</b>        <b>Write</b> <b>MD5</b> <b>sum</b> <b>(FLAC</b> <b>only)</b>. Using this option, the frames are decoded just before being  written
                 in  the  output  files  and  MD5 sum of the unencoded data is computed in order to complete the
                 STREAMINFO metadata block of the created files.  This option is disabled by default because the
                 decoding process makes the split to be much slower (it can be  twice  slower).   However,  even
                 when  using  this option, the process remains faster compared to splitting by decoding and then
                 re-encoding.

       <b>-O</b> <b>TIME</b>   <b>Overlap</b> <b>split</b> <b>files</b>. TIME will be added to each end splitpoint.  Current implementation of this
                 option makes the split slower.

       <b>-o</b> <b>FORMAT</b> <b>Output</b> <b>format</b>. FORMAT is a string that will be used as output  directory  and/or  filename.  If
                 FORMAT  contains  the  DIRCHAR character ('\' on windows and '/' on other systems), directories
                 will be created for each DIRCHAR if they don't exist and the output files will  be  created  in
                 the  corresponding  directory.  If  the -d option is not specified, the output directory is the
                 concatenation of the input file directory and the extracted path from FORMAT. If the -d  option
                 is  also  specified, the output directory will be the concatenation between the -d option value
                 and the extracted path from the -o FORMAT (characters up to the last DIRCHAR). Invalid filename
                 characters from the tags are transformed to '_'.

                 It can contain name variables, that must begin with @ char and that can be:

                 @A: performer if found, otherwise artist
                 @a: artist name
                 @p: performer of each song (only with .cue)
                 @b: album title
                 @g: genre
                 @t: song title*
                 @n: track number identifier* (not the real ID3 track number)**
                 @N: track tag number**
                 @l: track number identifier as lowercase letter* (not the real ID3 track number)**
                 @L: track tag number as lowercase letter**
                 @u: track number identifier as uppercase letter* (not the real ID3 track number)**
                 @U: track tag number as uppercase letter**
                 @f: input filename (without extension)
                 @d: last directory of the input filename or the filename itself if no directory
                 @m, @s or @h: the number of minutes, seconds or hundreths of seconds of the start splitpoint**
                 @M, @S or @H: the number of minutes, seconds or hundreths of seconds of the end splitpoint**

                 (**) One digit may follow defining the number of digits to output.
                 If the digit is 0, then a special rule is applied when the pattern value is equal to 0:
                 - the pattern is discarded
                 - all characters like : _ . and -. preceding it are discarded
                 - all characters following it are discarded up to the next @ or a separator like : _ . and -
                 This rule is useful for discarding the last part of the time when  equal  to  0.   For  example
                 @m_@s_@h0hundreths__@M_@S will only output @m_@s__@M_@S if the hundreths of seconds are 0.

                 When  split  files  are more than one, at least one of @t, @n, @N, @l, @L, @u or @U (*) must be
                 present to avoid ambiguous names.  You can put any prefix, separator, suffix in the string, for
                 more elegance.  To make easy the use spaces in output filename without  interfering  with  line
                 parameters,  you  can use the char '+' that will be automatically replaced with a space.  Valid
                 examples are:

                 @n_@a_@b_@t
                 @a+-+@n+-+@t (default if using -c and -o is not specified)
                 @a/@b/@t_@n (will create the directories '&lt;artist&gt;' and '&lt;artist&gt;/&lt;album&gt;')
                 @f_@n+@m:@s+@M:@S

       <b>-d</b> <b>NAME</b>   <b>Output</b> <b>directory</b>.  To put all output files in the directory named NAME. If directory  does  not
                 exists, it will be created. The -o option can also be used to output files into a directory.

       <b>-n</b>        <b>No</b>  <b>tags</b>.  Does  not  write ID3 or Vorbis comment in output files. Use if you need clean files.
                 See also the -x option.

       <b>-x</b>        <b>No</b> <b>Xing</b> <b>header</b>. Does not write the Xing header in output files. Use this option with -n if  you
                 wish to concatenate the split files and obtain a similar file as the input file.

       <b>-T</b> <b>TAGS_VERSION</b>
                 <b>Force</b>  <b>output</b>  <b>tags</b>  <b>version</b>.  For  mp3 files, force output ID3 tags as version ID3v1, ID3v2 or
                 ID3v1 and ID3v2. TAGS_VERSION can be 1, 2 or 12. Default is to set the output tags  version  as
                 the tags version of the input file.

       <b>-C</b> <b>ID3V2_TEXT_ENCODING</b>
                 <b>Set</b>   <b>encoding</b>   <b>of</b>   <b>the</b>  <b>ID3V2</b>  <b>tags</b>.  For  mp3  files,  set  the  encoding  of  ID3V2  tags.
                 ID3V2_TEXT_ENCODING can be 1 for latin1 (iso-8859-1), 8 for UTF-8 or 16 for UTF-16.  Default is
                 UTF-16.

       <b>-I</b> <b>INPUT_TAGS_ENCODING_FOR_ID3V2</b>
                 <b>Set</b> <b>encoding</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>input</b> <b>tags</b> <b>for</b> <b>mp3</b>  <b>files</b>.   INPUT_TAGS_ENCODING_FOR_ID3V2  can  be  1  for
                 latin1 (iso-8859-1), 8 for UTF-8 or 16 for UTF-16.  Default is UTF-8.

       <b>-N</b>        <b>No</b> <b>silence</b> <b>log</b> <b>file</b>. Don't create the 'mp3splt.log' log file when using silence detection. This
                 option cannot be used without the '-s' option.

       <b>-K</b>        <b>Keep</b>  <b>original</b>  <b>tags</b> <b>for</b> <b>CDDB</b> <b>or</b> <b>CUE</b>. When importing a CDDB or CUE file, set the original input
                 file tags and then replace them with those read from the imported file.

       <b>-g</b> <b>TAGS</b>   <b>Custom</b> <b>tags</b>. Set custom tags to the split files.  If you want to set spaces in tags, you  might
                 need  to  double quote the whole TAGS.  TAGS should contain a list of square brackets pairs <b>[]</b>.
                 The tags defined in the first pair of square brackets will be set  on  the  first  split  file,
                 those  defined  in the second pair of square brackets will be set on the second split file, ...
                 Inside a pair of square brackets, each tag is defined as <b>@variable=value</b> and tags are <b>separated</b>
                 <b>by</b> <b>comma</b>. If a percent sign <b>%</b> is found before the open square bracket character, then the  pair
                 of  square  brackets  following  the  % character will define the default tags in the following
                 files. Multiple '%' can be defined. An optional '<b>r</b>' character can be placed at  the  start,  to
                 replace tags in tags. The 'replace tags in tags' option is not recursive. The variables can be:

                 @a: artist name
                 @b: album title
                 @t: audio title
                 @y: year
                 @c: comment
                 @g: genre
                 @n: track number (set to -2 for none)
                 @o: set original tags
                 @O: set exactly the same original tag bytes and discard other variables (mp3 only)
                 @N:  auto  increment track number: this variable has to be placed inside the %[] field in order
                 to have the track number auto incremented for all the split files following it
                 @m, @s or @h: the number of minutes, seconds or hundreths of seconds of the start splitpoint
                 @M, @S or @H: the number of minutes, seconds or hundreths of seconds of the end splitpoint

                 Using the 'replace tags in tags' option, you can also use the following  variables,  which  are
                 replaced  by the data from the original tags: #a, #b, #t, #y, #c, #g.  Note that this will only
                 work if @o has been found before.

                 Example  of  tags  format:  <b>%[@o,@N=1,@b=special_album][@a=foo,@b=bar][@t=footitle]</b>.  In   this
                 example,  the  first split file will have the original tags with album tag replaced by 'special
                 album'; the second split file will have the tags of  the  first  split,  with  the  artist  tag
                 replaced  by 'foo' and the album tag replaced by 'bar'; the third split file will have the tags
                 of the first split, with the title tag replaced by 'footitle'. The track number will start at 1
                 for the first split file and auto increment to the other files.

                 Example of replacing tags in tags: <b>r%[@o,@N=1,@b=album,@a=artist_@b_@N]</b>. Having the 'r' option,
                 the   replace   tags   in   tags   mode   is    activated;    thus,    output    artists    are
                 'artist_album_1','artist_album_2',   ...    Without   the   'r'   option,  output  artists  are
                 'artist_@b_@N'.

                 Replacement is  not  recursive:  <b>r%[@o,@N=1,@b=album_@N,@a=artist_@b]</b>  will  output  albums  as
                 'album_1', 'album_2', ... but artists as 'artist_album_@N'.

                 Example  of  replacing tags in tags with # variables: <b>r%[@o,@N=1,@t=@N_#t]</b>This will prepend the
                 auto incremented track number to the original input file title; supposing that the  input  file
                 title is 'one_title', this will set the titles as follows: '1_one_title', '2_one_title', ...

       <b>-G</b> <b>regex=REGEX</b>
                 <b>Tags</b>  <b>from</b>  <b>filename</b> <b>regex</b>. Set tags from input filename regular expression.  REGEX can contain
                 those variables:
                    (?&lt;artist&gt;), (?&lt;album&gt;), (?&lt;title&gt;), (?&lt;tracknum&gt;), (?&lt;year&gt;), (?&lt;comment&gt;), (?&lt;genre&gt;)

                 Example: if the input filename is <b>artist1__album2__title3__comment4__2__2004__Samba.ogg</b>,
                 the                      following                      regular                      expression
                 <b>(?&lt;artist&gt;.*?)__(?&lt;album&gt;.*?)__(?&lt;title&gt;.*?)__(?&lt;comment&gt;.*?)__(?&lt;tracknum&gt;.*?)__(?&lt;year&gt;.*?)__(?&lt;genre&gt;.*)</b>
                 extracts the tags:
                   (?&lt;artist&gt;): artist1
                   (?&lt;album&gt;): album2
                   (?&lt;title&gt;): title3
                   (?&lt;genre&gt;): Samba
                   (?&lt;comment&gt;): comment4
                   (?&lt;tracknum&gt;): 2
                   (?&lt;year&gt;): 2004

       <b>-m</b> <b>M3U</b>    <b>Create</b>  <b>.m3u</b> <b>file</b>. Creates a .m3u file containing the split files. The generated .m3u file only
                 contains the split filenames without the path. If an output directory is specified with  -d  or
                 -o,  the  file  is created in this directory. The path of M3U is ignored. This option cannot be
                 used with STDOUT output.

       <b>-E</b> <b>CUE_FILE</b>
                 <b>Export</b> <b>to</b> <b>.cue</b> <b>file</b>. Creates a .cue file containing the splitpoints.   Use  -P  to  export  the
                 splitpoints  without  actually splitting.  The cue file contains the tags of the splitpoints as
                 comments (for example REM ALBUM, REM GENRE, REM DATE). There is  however  one  limitation:  REM
                 TRACK is not written if the track was auto incremented without user defined tags.

       <b>-F</b> <b>FULL_SILENCE_LOG_FILE</b>
                 <b>Export</b> <b>the</b> <b>full</b> <b>log</b> <b>of</b> <b>silence</b> <b>detection</b>. The full log filename is useful to draw the amplitude
                 wave of the input file (in dB) in order to choose a threshold.

                 <b>Note</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>file</b> <b>structure:</b>
                      ‐the  first  column  is  a  dummy  column  which is always zero, for plotting on zero axis
                 purposes
                      ‐the second column is the time in seconds as double
                      ‐the third column is the dB level
                      ‐the fourth column is the silences shots counter
                      ‐the five column is the number of splitpoints found
                      ‐the sixth column is the start time of the silence spot found
                      ‐the seventh column is the end time of the silence spot found

                 Example of plotting the full log file with gnuplot:

                 gnuplot -e "file='silence_logs.txt'; set decimalsign locale; set xlabel 'Time in seconds'; plot
                 file using 2:3 title 'Threshold', file using 2:4 title 'Silence shots' with  linespoints,  file
                 using  2:5  title  'Number of silence points found' with fsteps, file using 6:1 title 'Begin of
                 silence', file using 7:1 title 'End of silence' with points; pause -1"

       <b>-P</b>        <b>Pretend</b> <b>to</b> <b>split</b>. Simulation of the process without creating any files or directories.

       <b>-q</b>        <b>Quiet</b> <b>mode</b>. Stays quiet :) i.e. do not prompt the user for anything and  print  less  messages.
                 When  you use quiet option, mp3splt will try to end program without asking anything to the user
                 (useful for scripts).  In Wrap mode it will also skip CRC check, use  if  you  are  in  such  a
                 hurry.

       <b>-Q</b>        <b>Very</b>  <b>quiet</b>  <b>mode</b>.  Enables  the  -q  option and does not print anything to STDOUT. This option
                 cannot be used with STDOUT output.

       <b>-D</b>        <b>Debug</b> <b>mode</b>. Experimental debug support. Print extra informations  about  what  is  being  done.
                 Current print doesn't have a nice format.

       <b>-v</b>        <b>Print</b> <b>version.</b> Print the version of mp3splt and libmp3splt and exit.

       <b>-h</b>        <b>Print</b> <b>help.</b> Print a short usage of mp3splt and exit.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>mp3splt</b> <b>album.mp3</b> <b>54.32.19</b> <b>67.32</b> <b>-o</b> <b>out</b>
       <b>mp3splt</b> <b>album.ogg</b> <b>54.32.19</b> <b>67.32</b> <b>-o</b> <b>out</b>

       This  is  the  standard use of mp3splt for constant bitrate mp3 or for any ogg.  You specify a begin time
       (which in this case uses hundredths, 54.32.19), an end time and an output file.

       <b>mp3splt</b> <b>-f</b> <b>-d</b> <b>newdir</b> <b>album.mp3</b> <b>album2.mp3</b> <b>145.59</b>  <b>234.2</b>

       This is frame mode for variable bitrate mp3 and multiple files.   You  can  see  that  time  format  uses
       min.sec    even    if    minutes    are    over    60.     Output   files   in   this   case   will   be:
       album_145m_59s_0h__234m_2s_0h.mp3 and album2_145m_59s_0h__234m_2s_0h.mp3 because user didn't  specify  it
       and they will be in the directory named newdir.

       <b>mp3splt</b>  <b>-nf</b> <b>album.mp3</b>  <b>0.12</b>  <b>21.34.7</b>  <b>25.3</b>  <b>30.40</b>  <b>38.58</b>

       This  is  the  use of -n option and multiple splitpoints. Four files will be created and will not contain
       ID3 informations.

       <b>mp3splt</b>  <b>-w</b>  <b>album_MP3WRAP.mp3</b>

       This is Wrap mode. You can use this when mp3 is a file  wrapped  with  Mp3Wrap  or  AlbumWrap.   You  can
       specify an output directory with the -d option.

       <b>mp3splt</b>  <b>-lq</b>  <b>album.mp3</b>

       This is List mode. You can use this when you want to list all tracks of a wrapped file without extracting
       them.  With quiet option (-q), program will not calculate CRC!

       <b>mp3splt</b> <b>-s</b> <b>f.mp3</b> or <b>mp3splt</b> <b>-s</b> <b>-p</b> <b>th=-50,nt=10</b> <b>f.mp3</b>

       This  is  silence option. Mp3splt will try to automatically detect splitpoints with silence detection and
       in the first case will split all tracks found with default parameters, while in the second 10 tracks  (or
       less if too much) with the most probable silence points at a threshold of -50 dB.

       <b>mp3splt</b>  <b>-c</b>  <b>file.cddb</b>  <b>album.mp3</b>

       This is CDDB mode with a local file. Filenames and splitpoints will be taken from file.cddb.

       <b>mp3splt</b>  <b>-c</b>  <b>query</b>  <b>album.mp3</b>

       This  is CDDB mode with internet query. Will ask you the keyword to search and you will select the wanted
       cd.

       <b>mp3splt</b>  <b>-a</b> <b>-c</b>  <b>file.cddb</b> <b>album.mp3</b>

       This is CDDB mode with auto-adjust option (default parameters). Splitpoints will be adjusted with silence
       detection in a range of 30 seconds before and after cddb splitpoints.

       <b>mp3splt</b>  <b>-a</b> <b>-p</b> <b>gap=15,th=-23,rm</b> <b>-c</b>  <b>file.cddb</b> <b>album.mp3</b>

       This is CDDB mode with auto-adjust option. Splitpoints will be adjusted with silence detection in a range
       of 15 seconds before and after cddb splitpoints, with a threshold of -23 dB, and silence will be removed.

       <b>mp3splt</b>  <b>-c</b>  <b>query</b>  <b>album.mp3</b> <b>-n</b> <b>-o</b> <b>@n_@t</b>

       This is CDDB mode with internet query with Frame mode, NoID3 and Output format.  Output filenames will be
       named like: 01_Title.mp3

       <b>mp3splt</b>  <b>-t</b>  <b>10.00</b>  <b>album.mp3</b>

       This is -t option. It will split album.mp3 in many files of 10 minutes each.
