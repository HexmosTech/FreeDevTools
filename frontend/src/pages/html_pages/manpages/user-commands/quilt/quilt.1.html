       quilt - manage a series of patches

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>quilt</b> [<b>--quiltrc</b> <u>file</u>] [<b>--trace</b>] <u>command</u> [<u>options</u>]

       <b>quilt</b> [<u>command</u>] -h
       <b>quilt</b> <b>--version</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Quilt</u>  is  a  tool  to  manage  large  sets  of patches by keeping track of the changes each patch makes.
       Patches can be applied, unapplied, refreshed, and so forth.  The key philosophical concept is  that  your
       primary working material is patches.

       With <u>quilt</u>, all work occurs within a single directory tree.  Commands can be invoked from anywhere within
       the  source  tree.   Like  <u>CVS</u>,  <u>Subversion</u>, or <u>Git</u>, <u>quilt</u> takes commands of the form “quilt <u>command</u>”.  A
       command can be truncated (abbreviated) as long as the specified part of the command is  unambiguous.   If
       <u>command</u>  is  ambiguously  short,  <u>quilt</u>  lists all commands matching that prefix and exits.  All commands
       print a brief contextual help message and exit if given the “-h” option.

       <u>Quilt</u> manages a stack of patches.  Patches are applied incrementally on top of the  base  tree  plus  all
       preceding  patches.   They  can be pushed onto the stack (“quilt push”), and popped off the stack (“quilt
       pop”).  Commands are available for querying the contents of the stack (“quilt applied”, “quilt previous”,
       “quilt top”) and the patches  that  are  not  applied  at  a  particular  moment  (“quilt  next”,  “quilt
       unapplied”).  By default, most commands apply to the topmost patch on the stack.

       Patch  files  are  located  in  the <u>patches</u> subdirectory of the source tree (see <b>Example</b> <b>of</b> <b>working</b> <b>tree</b>,
       under <b>FILES</b>, below).  The <u>QUILT_PATCHES</u> environment variable overrides this default location.   When  not
       found in the current directory, that subdirectory is searched recursively in the parent directories (this
       is  similar  to  the  way  <u>Git</u>  searches for its configuration files).  The <u>patches</u> directory may contain
       subdirectories.  It may also be a symbolic link instead of a directory.

       <u>Quilt</u> creates and maintains a file called <u>series</u>, which defines the order in which patches  are  applied.
       The  <u>QUILT_SERIES</u>  environment  variable  overrides this default name.  You can query the contents of the
       series file at any time with “quilt series”.  In this file, each patch file name is on a  separate  line.
       Patch  files  are  identified by path names that are relative to the <u>patches</u> directory; patches may be in
       subdirectories below this directory.  Lines in the series file that start with a hash character  (#)  are
       ignored.   Patch  options,  such  as the strip level or whether the patch is reversed, can be added after
       each patch file name.  Options are introduced by a space, separated by spaces, and follow the  syntax  of
       the  <a href="../man1/patch.1.html">patch</a>(1) options (e.g., “-p2”).  Quilt records patch options automatically when a command supporting
       them is used.  Without options, strip level 1 is assumed.  You can also add a comment  after  each  patch
       file  name and options, introduced by a space followed by a hash character.  When <u>quilt</u> adds, removes, or
       renames patches, it automatically updates the series file.  Users of <u>quilt</u> can modify series files  while
       some  patches  are  applied, as long as the applied patches remain in their original order.  Unless there
       are means by which a series file can be generated automatically, you should provide it along with any set
       of <u>quilt</u>-managed patches you distribute.  Different series files can  be  used  to  assemble  patches  in
       different ways, corresponding (for example) to different development branches.

       Before  a  patch  is  applied,  copies  of  all  files the patch modifies are saved to the <u>.pc/</u>patch-name
       directory, where <u>patch-name</u> is the name of the patch (for example, <u>fix-buffer-overflow.patch</u>).  The patch
       is added to the list of  currently  applied  patches  (<u>.pc/applied-patches</u>).   Later,  when  a  patch  is
       regenerated (“quilt refresh”), the backup copies in <u>.pc/</u>patch-name are compared with the current versions
       of the files in the source tree using GNU <b><a href="../man1/diff.1.html">diff</a></b>(1).

       A similar process occurs when starting a new patch (“quilt new”); the new patch file name is added to the
       series  file.   A  file  to  be  changed by the patch is backed up and opened for editing (“quilt edit”).
       After editing, inspect the impact of your changes (“quilt diff”); the changes stay local to your  working
       tree until you call “quilt refresh” to write them to the patch file.

       Documentation  related  to a patch can be put at the beginning of its patch file (“quilt header”).  <u>Quilt</u>
       is careful to preserve all text that precedes the actual patch when doing a refresh.  (This is limited to
       patches in unified format; see the GNU <u>Diffutils</u> manual.)

       The series file is looked up in the <u>.pc</u> directory, in the root of the source tree,  and  in  the  patches
       directory.   The  first  series  file that is found is used.  This may also be a symbolic link, or a file
       with multiple hard links.  Usually, only one series file is used for a set of patches, making the patches
       subdirectory a convenient location.

       The <u>.pc</u> directory cannot be relocated, but it can be a symbolic link.  Its  subdirectories  must  not  be
       renamed  or  restructured.  While patches are applied to the source tree, this directory is essential for
       many operations, including popping patches off the stack and refreshing them.  Files in the <u>.pc</u> directory
       are automatically removed when they are no longer needed, so there is no need to clean up manually.

   <b>Quilt</b> <b>commands</b> <b>reference</b>
       <b>add</b> [-P patch] {file} ...

           Add one or more files to the topmost or named patch.  Files must be added to the patch  before  being
           modified.  Files that are modified by patches already applied on top of the specified patch cannot be
           added.

           -P patch

               Patch to add files to.

       <b>annotate</b> [-P patch] {file}

           Print  an  annotated  listing  of  the  specified file showing which patches modify which lines. Only
           applied patches are included.

           -P patch

               Stop checking for changes at the specified rather than the topmost patch.

       <b>applied</b> [patch]

           Print a list of applied patches, or all patches up to and including the specified patch in  the  file
           series.

       <b>delete</b> [-r] [--backup] [patch|-n]

           Remove  the  specified  or  topmost  patch from the series file.  If the patch is applied, quilt will
           attempt to remove it first. (Only the topmost patch can be removed right now.)

           -n  Delete the next patch after topmost, rather than the specified or topmost patch.

           -r  Remove the deleted patch file from the patches directory as well.

           --backup

               Rename the patch file to patch~ rather than deleting it.  Ignored if not used with `-r'.

       <b>diff</b> [-p n|-p ab] [-u|-U num|-c|-C num] [--combine patch|-z] [-R] [-P patch] [--snapshot]
       [--diff=utility] [--no-timestamps] [--no-index] [--sort] [--color[=always|auto|never]] [file ...]

           Produces a diff of the specified file(s) in  the  topmost  or  specified  patch.   If  no  files  are
           specified, all files that are modified are included.

           -p n
               Create a -p n style patch (-p0 or -p1 are supported).

           -p ab
               Create  a -p1 style patch, but use a/file and b/file as the original and new filenames instead of
               the default dir.orig/file and dir/file names.

           -u, -U num, -c, -C num

               Create a unified diff (-u, -U) with num lines of context. Create a context diff (-c, -C) with num
               lines of context. The number of context lines defaults to 3.

           --no-timestamps

               Do not include file timestamps in patch headers.

           --no-index

               Do not output Index: lines.

           -z  Write to standard output the changes that have been made relative to  the  topmost  or  specified
               patch.

           -R  Create a reverse diff.

           -P patch

               Create a diff for the specified patch.  (Defaults to the topmost patch.)

           --combine patch

               Create  a  combined  diff  for  all patches between this patch and the patch specified with -P. A
               patch name of `-' is equivalent to specifying the first applied patch.

           --snapshot

               Diff against snapshot (see `quilt snapshot -h').

           --diff=utility

               Use the specified utility for generating the diff. The utility is invoked with the  original  and
               new file name as arguments.

           --color[=always|auto|never]

               Use syntax coloring (auto activates it only if the output is a tty).

           --sort
               Sort files by their name instead of preserving the original order.

       <b>edit</b> file ...

           Edit the specified file(s) in $EDITOR after adding it (them) to the topmost patch.

       <b>files</b> [-v] [-a] [-l] [--combine patch] [patch]

           Print the list of files that the topmost or specified patch changes.

           -a  List all files in all applied patches.

           -l  Add patch name to output.

           -v  Verbose, more user friendly output.

           --combine patch

               Create  a  listing for all patches between this patch and the topmost or specified patch. A patch
               name of `-' is equivalent to specifying the first applied patch.

       <b>fold</b> [-R] [-q] [-f] [-p strip-level]

           Integrate the patch read from standard input into the topmost patch: After making sure that all files
           modified are part of the topmost patch, the patch is applied with the specified  strip  level  (which
           defaults to 1).

           -R  Apply patch in reverse.

           -q  Quiet operation.

           -f  Force  apply, even if the patch has rejects. Unless in quiet mode, apply the patch interactively:
               the patch utility may ask questions.

           -p strip-level

               The number of pathname components to strip from file names when applying patchfile.

       <b>fork</b> [new_name]

           Fork the topmost patch.  Forking a patch means creating a verbatim copy of it under a new  name,  and
           use that new name instead of the original one in the current series.  This is useful when a patch has
           to  be  modified,  but  the  original  version of it should be preserved, e.g.  because it is used in
           another series, or for the history.  A typical sequence of commands would be: fork, edit, refresh.

           If new_name is missing, the name of the forked patch will be the  current  patch  name,  followed  by
           `-2'.   If the patch name already ends in a dash-and-number, the number is further incremented (e.g.,
           patch.diff, patch-2.diff, patch-3.diff).

       <b>graph</b> [--all] [--reduce] [--lines[=num]] [--edge-labels=files] [-T ps] [patch]

           Generate a <a href="../man1/dot.1.html">dot</a>(1) directed graph showing the dependencies between applied patches. A patch depends on
           another patch if both touch the same file  or,  with  the  --lines  option,  if  their  modifications
           overlap.  Unless  otherwise  specified, the graph includes all patches that the topmost patch depends
           on.  When a patch name is specified, instead of the topmost patch, create a graph for  the  specified
           patch.  The  graph  will include all other patches that this patch depends on, as well as all patches
           that depend on this patch.

           --all
               Generate a graph including all applied patches and their dependencies. (Unapplied patches are not
               included.)

           --reduce

               Eliminate transitive edges from the graph.

           --lines[=num]

               Compute dependencies by looking at the lines the patches  modify.   Unless  a  different  num  is
               specified, two lines of context are included.

           --edge-labels=files

               Label graph edges with the file names that the adjacent patches modify.

           -T ps
               Directly produce a PostScript output file.

       <b>grep</b> [-h|options] {pattern}

           Grep  through  the  source  files,  recursively,  skipping  patches and quilt meta-information. If no
           filename argument is given, the whole source tree is searched. Please see the <a href="../man1/grep.1.html">grep</a>(1) manual page for
           options.

           -h  Print this help. The grep -h option can be passed after a double-dash  (--).  Search  expressions
               that start with a dash can be passed after a second double-dash (-- --).

       <b>header</b> [-a|-r|-e] [--backup] [--dep3] [--strip-diffstat] [--strip-trailing-whitespace] [patch]

           Print or change the header of the topmost or specified patch.

           -a, -r, -e

               Append  to (-a) or replace (-r) the existing patch header, or edit (-e) the header in $EDITOR. If
               none of these options is given, print the patch header.

           --strip-diffstat

               Strip diffstat output from the header.

           --strip-trailing-whitespace

               Strip trailing whitespace at the end of lines of the header.

           --backup

               Create a backup copy of the old version of a patch as patch~.

           --dep3

               When    editing    (-e),    insert    a    template    with    DEP-3    headers.     DEP-3     is
               <a href="http://dep.debian.net/deps/dep3/">http://dep.debian.net/deps/dep3/</a> Patch Tagging Guidelines.

       <b>import</b> [-p num] [-R] [-P patch] [-f] [-d {o|a|n}] patchfile ...

           Import  external  patches.  The patches will be inserted following the current top patch, and must be
           pushed after import to apply them.

           -p num

               Number of directory levels to strip when applying (default=1)

           -R

               Apply patch in reverse.

           -P patch

               Patch filename to use inside quilt. This option can only be used when importing a single patch.

           -f  Overwrite/update existing patches.

           -d {o|a|n}

               When overwriting in existing patch, keep the old (o), all (a), or new (n) patch header.  If  both
               patches  include headers, this option must be specified. This option is only effective when -f is
               used.

       <b>mail</b> {--mbox file|--send} [-m text] [-M file] [--prefix prefix] [--sender ...] [--from ...] [--to ...]
       [--cc ...] [--bcc ...] [--subject ...] [--reply-to message] [--charset ...] [--signature file]
       [first_patch [last_patch]]

           Create mail messages from a specified range of patches, or all patches in the series file, and either
           store them in a mailbox file, or send them immediately. The editor is opened with a template for  the
           introduction.   Please  see /usr/share/doc/quilt/README.MAIL for details.  When specifying a range of
           patches, a first patch name of `-' denotes the first, and a last patch name of `-' denotes  the  last
           patch in the series.

           -m text

               Text  to  use  as  the text in the introduction. When this option is used, the editor will not be
               invoked, and the patches will be processed immediately.

           -M file

               Like the -m option, but read the introduction from file.

           --prefix prefix

               Use an alternate prefix in the bracketed part of the subjects generated. Defaults to `patch'.

           --mbox file

               Store all messages in the specified file in mbox  format.  The  mbox  can  later  be  sent  using
               formail, for example.

           --send

               Send the messages directly.

           --sender

               The  envelope  sender  address  to  use.  The  address must be of the form `<a href="mailto:user@domain.name">user@domain.name</a>'. No
               display name is allowed.

           --from, --subject

               The values for the From and Subject headers to use. If no --from option is given,  the  value  of
               the --sender option is used.

           --to, --cc, --bcc

               Append a recipient to the To, Cc, or Bcc header.

           --charset

               Specify  a  particular  message  encoding  on  systems which don't use UTF-8 or ISO-8859-15. This
               character encoding must match the one used in the patches.

           --signature file

               Append the specified signature to messages (defaults to <a href="file:~/.signature">~/.signature</a> if found;  use  `-'  for  no
               signature).

           --reply-to message

               Add the appropriate headers to reply to the specified message.

       <b>new</b> [-p n|-p ab] {patchname}

           Create  a new patch with the specified file name, and insert it after the topmost patch. The name can
           be prefixed with a sub-directory name, allowing for grouping related patches together.

           -p n
               Create a -p n style patch (-p0 or -p1 are supported).

           -p ab
               Create a -p1 style patch, but use a/file and b/file as the original and new filenames instead  of
               the default dir.orig/file and dir/file names.

               Quilt can be used in sub-directories of a source tree. It determines the root of a source tree by
               searching  for  a   directory  above  the  current  working directory. Create a  directory in the
               intended root directory if quilt chooses a top-level  directory  that  is  too  high  up  in  the
               directory tree.

       <b>next</b> [patch]

           Print the name of the next patch after the specified or topmost patch in the series file.

       <b>patches</b> [-v] [--color[=always|auto|never]] {file} [files...]

           Print  the  list  of  patches  that modify any of the specified files. (Uses a heuristic to determine
           which files are modified by unapplied patches.  Note that this heuristic is much slower than scanning
           applied patches.)

           -v  Verbose, more user friendly output.

           --color[=always|auto|never]

               Use syntax coloring (auto activates it only if the output is a tty).

       <b>pop</b> [-afRqv] [--refresh] [num|patch]

           Remove patch(es) from the stack of applied patches.  Without options, the topmost patch  is  removed.
           When  a number is specified, remove the specified number of patches.  When a patch name is specified,
           remove patches until the specified patch end up on top of the stack.  Patch  names  may  include  the
           patches/ prefix, which means that filename completion can be used.

           -a  Remove all applied patches.

           -f  Force remove. The state before the patch(es) were applied will be restored from backup files.

           -R  Always verify if the patch removes cleanly; don't rely on timestamp checks.

           -q  Quiet operation.

           -v  Verbose operation.

           --refresh

               Automatically refresh every patch before it gets unapplied.

       <b>previous</b> [patch]

           Print the name of the previous patch before the specified or topmost patch in the series file.

       <b>push</b> [-afqvm] [--fuzz=N] [--merge[=merge|diff3]] [--leave-rejects] [--color[=always|auto|never]]
       [--refresh] [num|patch]

           Apply patch(es) from the series file.  Without options, the next patch in the series file is applied.
           When  a  number is specified, apply the specified number of patches.  When a patch name is specified,
           apply all patches up to and including the specified patch.  Patch  names  may  include  the  patches/
           prefix,  which  means  that  filename  completion can be used. The mtime of all touched files will be
           exactly the same to prevent time skews.

           -a  Apply all patches in the series file.

           -q  Quiet operation.

           -f  Force apply, even if the patch has rejects.

           -v  Verbose operation.

           --fuzz=N

               Set the maximum fuzz factor (default: 2).

           -m, --merge[=merge|diff3]

               Merge the patch file into the original files (see <a href="../man1/patch.1.html">patch</a>(1)).

           --leave-rejects

               Leave around the reject files patch produced, even if the patch is not actually applied.

           --color[=always|auto|never]

               Use syntax coloring (auto activates it only if the output is a tty).

           --refresh

               Automatically refresh every patch after it was successfully applied.

       <b>refresh</b> [-p n|-p ab] [-u|-U num|-c|-C num] [-z[new_name]] [-f] [--no-timestamps] [--no-index]
       [--diffstat] [--sort] [--backup] [--strip-trailing-whitespace] [patch]

           Refreshes the specified patch, or the topmost patch by default.  Documentation that comes before  the
           actual patch in the patch file is retained.

           It is possible to refresh patches that are not on top.  If any patches on top of the patch to refresh
           modify  the  same  files,  the script aborts by default.  Patches can still be refreshed with -f.  In
           that case this script will print a warning for each shadowed file, changes  by  more  recent  patches
           will  be  ignored,  and  only changes in files that have not been modified by any more recent patches
           will end up in the specified patch.

           -p n
               Create a -p n style patch (-p0 or -p1 supported).

           -p ab
               Create a -p1 style patch, but use a/file and b/file as the original and new filenames instead  of
               the default dir.orig/file and dir/file names.

           -u, -U num, -c, -C num

               Create a unified diff (-u, -U) with num lines of context. Create a context diff (-c, -C) with num
               lines of context. The number of context lines defaults to 3.

           -z[new_name]

               Create a new patch containing the changes instead of refreshing the topmost patch. If no new name
               is specified, `-2' is added to the original patch name, etc. (See the fork command.)

           --no-timestamps

               Do not include file timestamps in patch headers.

           --no-index

               Do not output Index: lines.

           --diffstat

               Add a diffstat section to the patch header, or replace the existing diffstat section.

           -f  Enforce refreshing of a patch that is not on top.

           --backup

               Create a backup copy of the old version of a patch as patch~.

           --sort
               Sort files by their name instead of preserving the original order.

           --strip-trailing-whitespace

               Strip trailing whitespace at the end of lines.

       <b>remove</b> [-P patch] {file} ...

           Remove  one or more files from the topmost or named patch.  Files that are modified by patches on top
           of the specified patch cannot be removed.

           -P patch

               Remove named files from the named patch.

       <b>rename</b> [-P patch] new_name

           Rename the topmost or named patch.

           -P patch

               Patch to rename.

       <b>revert</b> [-P patch] {file} ...

           Revert uncommitted changes to the topmost or named patch for the specified file(s): after the revert,
           'quilt diff -z' will show no differences for those files. Changes  to  files  that  are  modified  by
           patches on top of the specified patch cannot be reverted.

           -P patch

               Revert changes in the named patch.

       <b>series</b> [--color[=always|auto|never]] [-v]

           Print the names of all patches in the series file.

           --color[=always|auto|never]

               Use syntax coloring (auto activates it only if the output is a tty).

           -v  Verbose, more user friendly output.

       <b>setup</b> [-d path-prefix] [-v] [--sourcedir dir] [--fuzz=N] [--slow|--fast] {specfile|seriesfile}

           Initializes a source tree from an rpm spec file or a quilt series file.

           -d  Optional path prefix for the resulting source tree.

           --sourcedir

               Directory that contains the package sources. Defaults to `.'.

           -v  Verbose debug output.

           --fuzz=N

               Set the maximum fuzz factor (needs rpm 4.6 or later).

           --slow
               Use  the  original,  slow  method  to  process  the spec file. In this mode, rpmbuild generates a
               working tree in a temporary directory while all its actions are recorded, and then everything  is
               replayed from scratch in the target directory.

           --fast
               Use the new, faster method to process the spec file. In this mode, rpmbuild is told to generate a
               working tree directly in the target directory. This is the default (since quilt version 0.67).

               The  setup  command  is  only  guaranteed  to  work properly on spec files where applying all the
               patches is the last thing done in the %prep section. This is a design limitation due to the  fact
               that quilt can only operate on patches. If other commands in the %prep section modify the patched
               files, they must come first, otherwise you won't be able to push the patch series.

               For  example,  a  %prep  section where you first unpack a tarball, then apply patches, and lastly
               perform a tree-wide string substitution, is not OK. For "quilt setup" to work, it would  have  to
               be  changed  to  unpacking  the  tarball,  then performing the tree-wide string substitution, and
               lastly applying the patches.

       <b>snapshot</b> [-d]

           Take a snapshot of the current working state.  After taking the snapshot, the tree can be modified in
           the usual ways, including pushing and popping patches.  A diff against the tree at the moment of  the
           snapshot can be generated with `quilt diff --snapshot'.

           -d  Only remove current snapshot.

       <b>top</b>

           Print the name of the topmost patch on the current stack of applied patches.

       <b>unapplied</b> [patch]

           Print  a  list of patches that are not applied, or all patches that follow the specified patch in the
           series file.

       <b>upgrade</b>

           Upgrade the meta-data in a working tree from an old version of quilt to  the  current  version.  This
           command  is  only  needed  when  the  quilt  meta-data format has changed, and the working tree still
           contains old-format meta-data. In that case, quilt will request to run `quilt upgrade'.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       These options are common to all <u>quilt</u> commands.

       <b>-h</b>     Print a usage message (for the given <u>command</u>, if one is specified, otherwise for <u>quilt</u> itself) and
              exit.

       <b>--quiltrc</b> <u>file</u>
              Use <u>file</u> as the configuration file instead of <u><a href="file:~/.quiltrc">~/.quiltrc</a></u> (or <u>/etc/quilt.quiltrc</u> if <u><a href="file:~/.quiltrc">~/.quiltrc</a></u> does
              not exist).  The special value “-” causes <u>quilt</u> not to read any configuration file.

       <b>--trace</b>
              Run the command in the shell's trace mode (-x) for debugging of internal operations.

       <b>--version</b>
              Print the version number and exit.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       The exit status is 0 if the requested operation completed successfully, or 1 in case of error.

       An exit status of 2 indicates that <u>quilt</u> did not do anything to complete the command.   This  happens  in
       particular  when  asking  <u>quilt</u>  to push when the whole stack is already pushed, or to pop when the whole
       stack is already popped.  This behavior is intended to ease scripting with <u>quilt</u>.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Quilt</u> recognizes the following variables:

       <u>EDITOR</u>
           Specify the program to run to edit files; for instance, with “quilt edit” or “quilt header -e”.

       <u>LESS</u>
           Specify the arguments used to invoke the <b><a href="../man1/less.1.html">less</a></b>(1) pager.  Defaults to “-FRSX”.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>

       The <u>patches</u> directory is precious as it contains all your patches as well as  the  order  in  which  they
       should be applied.

       The  <u>.pc</u>  directory contains metadata about the current state of your patch series.  Changing its content
       is not advised.  This directory can usually be regenerated from the initial files and the content of  the
       <u>patches</u> directory (provided that all patches were regenerated before the removal).

   <b>Configuration</b> <b>file</b>
       Upon  startup,  <u>quilt</u>  evaluates  the  file  specified with the “--quiltrc” option; if that option is not
       given, the  file  <u>.quiltrc</u>  in  the  user's  home  directory  is  used,  and  if  that  does  not  exist,
       <u>/etc/quilt.quiltrc</u>  is  read.   This file is a <b><a href="../man1/bash.1.html">bash</a></b>(1) script.  <u>EDITOR</u> and <u>LESS</u> can be overridden here if
       desired; see <b>ENVIRONMENT</b>, above.

       Define a variable of the form <u>QUILT</u><b>_</b>COMMAND<b>_</b><u>ARGS</u> to specify default options to be  passed  to  any  <u>quilt</u>
       command (in uppercase).  For example,
              QUILT_DIFF_ARGS="--color=auto"
       causes the output of “quilt diff” to be syntax-colored when writing to a terminal.

       <u>QUILT_DIFF_OPTS</u>
           Additional options that <u>quilt</u> shall pass to GNU <u>diff</u> when generating patches.  A useful setting for C
           source  code is “-p”, which causes GNU <u>diff</u> to show in the resulting patch which function a change is
           in.

       <u>QUILT_PATCH_OPTS</u>
           Additional options that <u>quilt</u> shall pass to GNU <u>patch</u> when applying  patches.   For  example,  recent
           versions  of  GNU  <u>patch</u>  support the “--reject-format=unified” option for generating reject files in
           “unified diff” style (older <u>patch</u> versions used “--unified-reject-files” for that).

           You may also want to add the “-E” option if you have issues with <u>quilt</u> not deleting empty files  when
           you think it should.  The documentation of GNU <u>patch</u> says that “normally this option is unnecessary”,
           but  when  <u>patch</u> is in POSIX mode or if the patch format doesn't distinguish empty files from deleted
           files, <u>patch</u> deletes empty files only if the “-E” option is given.  Beware that when passing “-E”  to
           <u>patch</u>,  <u>quilt</u>  will  no longer be able to deal with empty files, which is why using “-E” is no longer
           the default.

       <u>QUILT_DIFFSTAT_OPTS</u>
           indicates additional options that <u>quilt</u> shall pass to <b><a href="../man1/diffstat.1.html">diffstat</a></b>(1) when generating  patch  statistics.
           For  example,  “-f0”  can be used for an alternative output format.  Recent versions of <u>diffstat</u> also
           support alternative rounding methods (“-r1”, “-r2”).

       <u>QUILT_PC</u>
           The location of backup files and any other  data  relating  to  the  current  state  of  the  working
           directory from <u>quilt</u>'s perspective.  Defaults to “.pc”.

       <u>QUILT_PATCHES</u>
           The location of patch files, defaulting to <u>patches</u>.

       <u>QUILT_SERIES</u>
           The  name  of  the  series  file,  defaulting to <u>series</u>.  Unless an absolute path is used, the search
           algorithm described above applies.

       <u>QUILT_PATCHES_PREFIX</u>
           Boolean flag; if set to anything, <u>quilt</u> will prefix any patch  name  it  prints  with  its  directory
           (<u>QUILT_PATCHES</u>).

       <u>QUILT_NO_DIFF_INDEX</u>
           Boolean  flag; if set to anything, no “Index:” line is prepended to patches generated by <u>quilt</u>.  This
           is shorthand for adding “--no-index” to both <u>QUILT_DIFF_ARGS</u> and <u>QUILT_REFRESH_ARGS</u>.

       <u>QUILT_NO_DIFF_TIMESTAMPS</u>
           Boolean flag; if set to anything, no timestamps are included  in  headers  when  generating  patches.
           This is shorthand for adding “--no-timestamps” to both <u>QUILT_DIFF_ARGS</u> and <u>QUILT_REFRESH_ARGS</u>.

       <u>QUILT_PAGER</u>
           The  pager  <u>quilt</u>  shall  use  for  commands  which produce paginated output.  If unset, the value of
           <u>GIT_PAGER</u> or, failing that, <u>PAGER</u> is used.  If none of these variables is set, “less -R” is used.  An
           empty value indicates that no pager should be used.

       <u>QUILT_COLORS</u>
           A sequence of definitions that directs <u>quilt</u> which ANSI escape sequences to associate with an  output
           context,  overriding  the  defaults.   The  most  common  use is to set colors (thus the name of this
           variable), but other attributes exist, such as bold or reverse.

           To override one or more settings, set <u>QUILT_COLORS</u> to a colon-separated list of elements, each of the
           form “<u>format-name</u><b>=</b><u>digit-sequence</u>[<b>;</b>...]”.

           Each <u>digit-sequence</u> should be a SGR (Select Graphic Rendition) value supported by your terminal.  The
           standardized SGR values were specified by ANSI and incorporated into ISO-6429 and ECMA-48 (§8.3.117).
           The colors have standard names but their values were not defined within a color space; their  precise
           appearance will vary and may be customizable in your terminal (emulator).

           Recognized <u>format-name</u>s, along with the <u>quilt</u> commands that use them, their use contexts, and default
           values, follow.
           ┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
           │ <u>format-name</u>   command   context                 default      │

           └──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

           All <u>format-name</u>s used by the series command are also used by the patches command.

           The  special  <u>format-name</u>  “clear”  is  used to turn off special graphic renditions and return to the
           terminal defaults.  Changing its definition should not be necessary for any terminal that  claims  to
           support  ANSI  escape  sequences.   If  your terminal is corrupted despite your best efforts, try the
           command “tput sgr0” to restore the default graphic rendition.

           As an example, one can put the following in <u><a href="file:~/.quiltrc">~/.quiltrc</a></u> (or <u>/etc/quilt.quiltrc</u>):
                   QUILT_DIFF_ARGS="--color"
                   # Render diff file headers in bold blue over yellow.
                   # Render diff hunk headers in "negative image" yellow.
                   # Render failed patches with a red background.
                   QUILT_COLORS="diff_hdr=1;34;43:diff_hunk=7;33:patch_fail=41"
