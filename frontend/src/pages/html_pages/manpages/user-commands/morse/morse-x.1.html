</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       morse-x - morse practicing tool

</pre><h4><b>SYNTAX</b></h4><pre>
       <b>morse-x</b> [<u>options</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       In <b>morse-x</b> you can use any key on your keyboard as morse key (except <b>q</b>, which exits) and then it displays
       your morsed stuff as readable text on stdout. (You should execute morse-x in an X terminal.)

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Of  course, morse-x takes some options, some with arguments. See the following list. A preceding dash (-)
       is optional.

       <b>c</b>      Tries to find out your number of words per minute. (In fact, it is like the  calibration  function
              in  former versions, except that it does not save the result, it just tells you your the number of
              your words per minute.)

       <b>f</b> <u>frequency</u>
              Set sound frequency.

       <b>g</b>      Show dits as red dots and daws as red lines in the main window.

       <b>h</b>      Print usage information, the same you can read here. Hopefully.

       <b>m</b>      Mute audio. No audio device will be opened.

       <b>r</b> <u>samplerate</u>
              Set audio sample rate.

       <b>s</b>      Show dits as dots and daws as dashes on stdout.

       <b>t</b>      Show used morse code table and exit. If you have suggestions on that table, please let me know.

       <b>v</b> <u>volume</u>
              Set sound volume. This must be a value between 0 and 1.

       <b>w</b> <u>wpm</u>  Set words per minute. This must be an integer between 1 and 60.

       Note that older versions (2004*) were written using Xlib instead  of  libSDL  and  thus  had  some  other
       options  and no audio output.  By the way, the .morse-x file of earlier versions is no longer needed. You
       may remove it.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       None so far. Please report some.
