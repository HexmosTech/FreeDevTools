</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       aldo -  A fully console morse code trainer written in ISO C++.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>aldo</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Aldo</b> is developed from scratch in ISO C++ using GNU C++ Standard Library and libao (www.xiph.org/ao).
       It is a morse code learning tool which provides four type of training methods:

       <b>Blocks</b>
               Identify blocks of random characters played in morse code.

       <b>Koch</b>
               Two morse characters will be played at full speed (20wpm)
               until you'll be able to identify at least 90 percent of them.
               After that, one more character will be added, and so on.

       <b>File</b>
               Identify played characters generated from a file.

       <b>Callsign</b>
               Identify random callsigns played in morse code.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       The  "Device"  option  under the keyer depends on the particular driver.  The "default" setting picks the
       default sound device.  This option may be used to pick a different soundcard than the default one.

       For alsa, it is "hw:&lt;card&gt;,&lt;device&gt;", where the card  and  device  number  are  the  particular  hardware
       devices.   The default is generally "hw:0.0".  Generally 0 is the first card, 1 is the second, etc.  Some
       sound cards may have multiple output devices, the device picks the particular one.

       For oss, sun, and aixs, it is the device name, like /dev/dsp.

       For esd, it is the host name, like "whizbang.com:555".

       It is not used on any other drivers.
