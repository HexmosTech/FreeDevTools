</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       raster2pgsql - loads GDAL supported raster formats into a PostGIS raster table

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       raster2pgsql is a raster loader executable that loads GDAL supported raster formats into sql suitable for
       loading into a PostGIS raster table. It is capable of loading folders of raster files as well as creating
       overviews of rasters.

       Since the raster2pgsql is compiled as part of PostGIS most often (unless you compile your own GDAL
       library), the raster types supported by the executable will be the same as those compiled in the GDAL
       dependency library. To get a list of raster types your particular raster2pgsql supports use the -G
       switch. These should be the same as those provided by your PostGIS install documented here ST_GDALDrivers
       if you are using the same gdal library for both.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPTIS</b></h4><pre>

       raster2pgsql [&lt;options&gt;] &lt;raster&gt;[ &lt;raster&gt;[ ...]] [[&lt;schema&gt;.]&lt;table&gt;]

       Multiple rasters can also be specified using wildcards (*,?).

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>

       <b>-s</b> &lt;srid&gt; Set the raster's SRID. Defaults to 0. If SRID not

              provided or is 0, raster's metadata will be checked to determine an appropriate SRID.

       <b>-b</b> &lt;band&gt; Index (1-based) of band to extract from raster. For more

              than  one  band index, separate with comma (,). Ranges can be defined by separating with dash (-).
              If unspecified, all bands of raster will be extracted.

       <b>-t</b> &lt;tile size&gt; Cut raster into tiles to be inserted one per

              table row. &lt;tile size&gt; is expressed as WIDTHxHEIGHT.  &lt;tile size&gt; can also be "auto" to allow  the
              loader to compute an appropriate tile size using the first raster and applied to all rasters.

       <b>-P</b> Pad right-most and bottom-most tiles to guarantee that all tiles

              have the same width and height.

       <b>-R</b>     Register the raster as an out-of-db (filesystem) raster. Provided raster should have absolute path
              to the file

              (<b>-d</b>|a|c|p) These are mutually exclusive options:

       <b>-d</b>     Drops the table, then recreates it and populates it with current raster data.

       <b>-a</b>     Appends raster into current table, must be exactly the same table schema.

       <b>-c</b>     Creates a new table and populates it, this is the default if you do not specify any options.

       <b>-p</b>     Prepare mode, only creates the table.

       <b>-f</b> &lt;column&gt; Specify the name of the raster column

       <b>-F</b>     Add a column with the filename of the raster.

       <b>-n</b> &lt;column&gt; Specify the name of the filename column. Implies <b>-F</b>.

       <b>-l</b> &lt;overview factor&gt; Create overview of the raster. For more than

              one  factor,  separate  with  comma(,).  Overview  table  name  follows  the  pattern  o_&lt;overview
              factor&gt;_&lt;table&gt;. Created overview is stored in the database and is not affected by <b>-R</b>.

       <b>-q</b>     Wrap PostgreSQL identifiers in quotes.

       <b>-I</b>     Create a GIST spatial index on the raster column. The ANALYZE command will automatically be issued
              for the created index.

       <b>-M</b>     Run VACUUM ANALYZE on the table of the  raster  column.  Most  useful  when  appending  raster  to
              existing table with <b>-a</b>.

       <b>-C</b>     Set  the  standard  set  of  constraints  on  the raster column after the rasters are loaded. Some
              constraints may fail if one or more rasters violate the constraint.

       <b>-x</b>     Disable setting the max extent constraint. Only applied if <b>-C</b> flag is also used.

       <b>-r</b>     Set the constraints (spatially unique and coverage tile) for regular blocking. Only applied if  <b>-C</b>
              flag is also used.

       <b>-T</b> &lt;tablespace&gt; Specify the tablespace for the new table.

              Note  that indices (including the primary key) will still use the default tablespace unless the <b>-X</b>
              flag is also used.

       <b>-X</b> &lt;tablespace&gt; Specify the tablespace for the table's new index.

              This applies to the primary key and the spatial index if the <b>-I</b> flag is used.

       <b>-N</b> &lt;nodata&gt; NODATA value to use on bands without a NODATA value.

       <b>-k</b>     Skip NODATA value checks for each raster band.

       <b>-E</b> &lt;endian&gt; Control endianness of generated binary output of

              raster. Use 0 for XDR and 1 for NDR (default). Only NDR is supported at this time.

       <b>-V</b> &lt;version&gt; Specify version of output WKB format. Default

              is 0. Only 0 is supported at this time.

       <b>-e</b>     Execute each statement individually, do not use a transaction.

       <b>-Y</b>     Use COPY statements instead of INSERT statements.

       <b>-G</b>     Print the supported GDAL raster formats.
