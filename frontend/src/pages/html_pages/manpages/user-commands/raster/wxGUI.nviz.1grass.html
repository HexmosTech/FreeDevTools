</pre><h4><b>KEYWORDS</b></h4><pre>
       display, GUI, visualization, graphics, raster, vector, raster3d

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Note: <b>wxNviz</b> <b>is</b> <b>currently</b> <b>under</b> <b>development.</b> <b>Not</b> <b>all</b> <b>planned</b> <b>functionality</b> <b>is</b> <b>already</b> <b>implemented.</b>

       <b>wxNviz</b>  is  a  <u>wxGUI</u> <b>3D</b> <b>view</b> <b>mode</b> which allows users to realistically render multiple <u>surfaces</u> (2D raster
       maps) in a 3D space, optionally using thematic coloring, draping 2D <u>vector</u> data or  different  2D  raster
       data over the surfaces, displaying 3D vector data in the space, and visualization of <u>3D</u> <u>rasters</u>.

       To  start the wxGUI 3D view mode, choose ’3D view’ from the map toolbar. You can switch between 2D and 3D
       view. The region in 3D view is updated according to displayed region in 2D view.

       wxNviz is emphasized on the ease and speed of viewer positioning and provided  flexibility  for  using  a
       wide  range  of  data.  A  low  resolution  surface  or  wire  grid  (optional) provides real-time viewer
       positioning capabilities. Coarse and fine resolution controls allow the user to  further  refine  drawing
       speed  and  detail  as  needed.  Continuous scaling of elevation provides the ability to use various data
       types for the vertical dimension.

       For each session of wxNviz, you might want the same set of 2D/3D raster and vector data, view parameters,
       or other attributes. For consistency between sessions, you  can  store  this  information  in  the  GRASS
       <u>workspace</u> file (gxw). Workspace contains information to restore "state" of the system in 2D and if wxNviz
       is enabled also in the 3D display mode.

</pre><h4><b>3D</b> <b>View</b> <b>Layer</b> <b>Manager</b> <b>Toolbox</b></h4><pre>
       The 3D view toolbox is integrated in the Layer Manager. The toolbox has several tabs:

           •   <b>View</b> for view controlling,

           •   <b>Data</b> for data properties,

           •   <b>Appearance</b> for appearance settings (lighting, fringes, ...).

           •   <b>Analysis</b> for various data analyses (only cutting planes so far).

           •   <b>Animation</b> for creating simple animations.

   <b>View</b>
       You can use this panel to set the <u>position,</u> <u>direction,</u> <u>and</u> <u>perspective</u> of  the  view.  The  position  box
       shows  a  puck  with  a  direction  line  pointing  to  the center. The direction line indicates the look
       direction (azimuth). You click and drag the puck to change the  current  eye  position.  Another  way  to
       change  eye  position  is  to press the buttons around the position box representing cardinal and ordinal
       directions.

       There are four other buttons for view control in the bottom of this panel (following label <u>Look:</u>):

           •   <u>here</u> requires you to click on Map Display Window to determine the point to look at.

           •   <u>center</u> changes the point you are looking at to the center.

           •   <u>top</u> moves the current eye position above the map center.

           •   <u>reset</u> returns all current view settings to their default values.
       You can adjust the viewer’s height above the scene, perspective and twist value to rotate the scene about
       the horizontal axis. An angle of 0 is flat. The scene rotates between -90 and 90 degrees.

       You can also adjusts the vertical exaggeration of the surface. As an example, if the easting and northing
       are in meters and the elevation  in  feet,  a  vertical  exaggeration  of  0.305  would  produce  a  true
       (unexaggerated) surface.

       View  parameters  can  be  controlled  by sliders or edited directly in the text boxes. It is possible to
       enter values which are out of slider’s range (and it will then adjust to the new range).

   <b>Fly-through</b> <b>mode</b>
       View can be changed in fly-through mode (can be activated in  Map  Display  toolbar),  which  enables  to
       change  the  view  smoothly  and  therefore  it  is suitable for creating animation (see below). To start
       flying, press left mouse button and hold it down to continue flying. Flight direction  is  controlled  by
       mouse   cursor   position   on   screen.  Flight  speed  can  be  increased/decreased  stepwise  by  keys
       PageUp/PageDown, Home/End or Up/Down arrows. Speed is increased multiple times while Shift  key  is  held
       down.   Holding  down Ctrl key switches flight mode in the way that position of viewpoint is changed (not
       the direction).

   <b>Data</b> <b>properties</b>
       This tab controls the parameters related to map layers. It consists of four collapsible panels - <u>Surface</u>,
       <u>Constant</u> <u>surface</u>, <u>Vector</u> and <u>3D</u> <u>raster</u>.

   <b>Surface</b>
       Each active raster map layer from the current layer tree is displayed as surface in the  3D  space.  This
       panel  controls  how loaded surfaces are drawn. To change parameters of a surface, it must be selected in
       the very top part of the panel.

       The top half of the panel has drawing style options.  Surface can be drawn as a wire mesh or using filled
       polygons (most realistic). You can set draw <b>mode</b> to <u>coarse</u> (fast display mode), <u>fine</u>  (draws  surface  as
       filled  polygons  with  fine  resolution) or <u>both</u> (which combines coarse and fine mode). Additionally set
       coarse <b>style</b> to <u>wire</u> to draw the surface as wire mesh (you can also choose color of the wire) or  <u>surface</u>
       to  draw  the  surface  using  coarse resolution filled polygons. This is a low resolution version of the
       polygon surface style.  E.g. surface is drawn as a wire mesh if you set <b>mode</b> to <u>coarse</u> and <b>style</b> to <u>wire</u>.
       Note that it differs from the mesh drawn in fast display mode because hidden lines are not drawn. To draw
       the surface using filled polygons, but with wire mesh draped over it, choose <b>mode</b> <u>both</u>  and  <b>style</b>  <u>wire</u>.
       Beside  mode and style you can also choose style of <b>shading</b> used for the surface. <u>Gouraud</u> style draws the
       surfaces with a smooth shading to blend individual cell colors together, <u>flat</u>  draws  the  surfaces  with
       flat shading with one color for every two cells. The surface appears faceted.

       To set given draw settings for all loaded surfaces press button "Set to all".

       The  bottom  half  of  the  panel  has options to set, unset or modify attributes of the current surface.
       Separate raster data or constants can be used for various attributes of the surface:

           •   <b>color</b> - raster map or constant color to drape over the current surface. This option is useful for
               draping imagery such as aerial photography over a DEM.

           •   <b>mask</b> - raster map that controls the areas displayed from the current surface.

           •   <b>transparency</b> - raster map or constant  value  that  controls  the  transparency  of  the  current
               surface. The default is completely opaque. Range from 0 (opaque) to 100 (transparent).

           •   <b>shininess</b>  -  raster  map  or  constant  value  that controls the shininess (reflectivity) of the
               current surface. Range from 0 to 100.

       In the very bottom part of the panel position of surface can be set.  To move the surface right  (looking
       from  the  south)  choose  <u>X</u>  axis and set some positive value. To reset the surface position press <u>Reset</u>
       button.

   <b>Constant</b> <b>surface</b>
       It is possible to add constant surface and set its properties like fine resolution, value (height), color
       and transparency. It behaves similarly to surface but it has less options.

   <b>Vector</b>
       2D vector data can be draped on the selected surfaces with various markers to represent point  data;  you
       can  use attribute of vector features to determine size, color, shape of glyph.  3D vector data including
       volumes (closed group of faces with one kernel inside) is also supported.  This panel controls how loaded
       2D or 3D vector data are drawn.

       You can define the width (in pixels) of the line features, the color used for lines or point markers.

       If vector map is 2D you can display vector features as flat at a specified elevation or drape it  over  a
       surface(s)  at  a  specified height. Use the height control to set the flat elevation or the drape height
       above the surface(s). In case of multiple surfaces it is possible to specify which surfaces is the vector
       map draped over.

       For display purposes, it is better to set the height slightly above the surface. If the height is set  at
       zero, portions of the vector may disappear into the surface(s).

       For  2D/3D  vector  points  you  can  also  set the size of the markers.  Currently are implemented these
       markers:

           •   <b>x</b> sets the current points markers to a 2D "X",

           •   <b>sphere</b> - solid 3D sphere,

           •   <b>diamond</b> - solid 3D diamond,

           •   <b>cube</b> - solid 3D cube,

           •   <b>box</b> - hollow 3D cube,

           •   <b>gyroscope</b> - hollow 3D sphere,

           •   <b>asterisk</b> - 3D line-star.

       Thematic mapping can be used to determine marker color and size (and line color and width).

   <b>3D</b> <b>rasters</b>
       3D raster maps (volumes, voxel models) can be displayed either as isosurfaces or  slices.   Similarly  to
       surface  panel you can define draw <b>shading</b> - <u>gouraud</u> (draws the 3D rasters with a smooth shading to blend
       individual cell colors together) and <u>flat</u> (draws the 3D rasters with flat  shading  with  one  color  for
       every  two  cells.  The  3D  raster  appears  faceted).  As  mentioned  above currently are supported two
       visualization modes:

           •   <b>isosurface</b> - the levels of values for drawing the 3D raster(s) as isosurfaces,

           •   and <b>slice</b> -  drawing the 3D raster as cross-sections.

       The middle part of the panel has controls to add, delete, move up/down selected  isosurface or slice. The
       bottom part differs for isosurface and slice.  When choosing an isosurface, this part the  of  panel  has
       options  to  set,  unset  or  modify  attributes  of  the  current isosurface.  Various attributes of the
       isosurface can be defined, similarly to surface attributes:

           •   <b>isosurface</b> <b>value</b> - reference isosurface value (height in map units).

           •   <b>color</b> - raster map or constant color to drape over the current 3D raster.

           •   <b>mask</b> - raster map that controls the areas displayed from the current 3D raster.

           •   <b>transparency</b> - raster map or constant value that controls the  transparency  of  the  current  3D
               raster. The default is completely opaque. Range from 0 (opaque) to 100 (transparent).

           •   <b>shininess</b>  -  raster  map  or  constant  value  that controls the shininess (reflectivity) of the
               current 3D raster. Range from 0 to 100.
       In case of 3D raster slice the bottom part of the panel controls the  slice  attributes  (which  axis  is
       slice  parallel  to,  position  of slice edges, transparency). Press button <u>Reset</u> to reset slice position
       attributes.

       3D rasters can be moved the same way like surfaces do.

   <b>Analysis</b>
       <u>Analysis</u> tab contains <u>Cutting</u> <u>planes</u> panel.

   <b>Cutting</b> <b>planes</b>
       Cutting planes allow cutting surfaces along a plane. You  can  switch  between  six  planes;  to  disable
       cutting  planes  switch  to  <u>None</u>.   Initially  the plane is vertical, you can change it to horizontal by
       setting <u>tilt</u> 90 degrees. The <u>X</u> and <u>Y</u> values specify the rotation center of plane. You can see better what
       <u>X</u> and <u>Y</u> do when changing <u>rotation</u>.  The <u>Height</u> parameter applies only when  changing  <u>tilt</u>  concurrently.
       Press the <u>Reset</u> button to reset the current cutting plane.

       In case of multiple surfaces you can visualize the cutting plane by <u>Shading</u>. Shading is visible only when
       more than one surface is loaded and these surfaces must have the same fine resolution set.

   <b>Appearance</b>
       Appearance tab consists of three collapsible panels:

           •   <u>Lighting</u> for adjusting light source

           •   <u>Fringe</u> for drawing fringes

           •   <u>Decorations</u> to display north arrow and scale bar

       The  <u>lighting</u>  panel enables to change the position of light source, light color, brightness and ambient.
       Light position is controlled similarly to eye position. If option <u>Show</u> <u>light</u> <u>model</u> is enabled light model
       is displayed to visualize the light settings.

       The <u>Fringe</u> panel allows you to draw fringes in different directions (North &amp; East, South &amp; East, South  &amp;
       West, North &amp; West). It is possible to set the fringe color and height of the bottom edge.

       The  <u>Decorations</u>  panel  enables  to  display north arrow and simple scale bar. North arrow and scale bar
       length is determined in map units.  You can display more than one scale bar.

   <b>Animation</b>
       Animation panel enables to create a simple animation as a sequence of images. Press ’Record’  button  and
       start changing the view. Views are recorded in given interval (FPS - Frames Per Second). After recording,
       the animation can be replayed. To save the animation, fill in the directory and file prefix, choose image
       format  (PPM  or  TIF)  and  then  press  ’Save’.   Now  wait  until  the last image is generated.  It is
       recommended to record animations using fly-through mode to achieve smooth motion.

</pre><h4><b>Settings</b></h4><pre>
       This panel has controls which allows user to set default surface, vector and 3D raster  data  attributes.
       You  can  also  modify  default view parameters, or to set the background color of the Map Display Window
       (the default color is white).

</pre><h4><b>To</b> <b>be</b> <b>implemented</b></h4><pre>
           •   Labels, decoration, etc. (Implemented, but not fully functional)

           •   Surface - mask by zero/elevation, more interactive positioning

           •   Vector points - implement display mode flat/surface for 2D points

           •   ...

</pre><h4><b>NOTE</b></h4><pre>
       wxNviz is under active development and distributed as "Experimental Prototype".

       Please note that with wxGTK port of wxPython (Linux  systems),  a  problem  might  appear  during  wxNviz
       initialization  (nothing  is  rendered at all) or when rendering vectors (bad order of rendering surfaces
       and vectors). If you encounter such problems, try to change a depth buffer number  in  <u>wxGUI</u>  <u>Settings</u>  <u>&gt;</u>
       <u>Preferences</u>  <u>&gt;</u> <u>Map</u> <u>Display</u>  <u>&gt;</u> <u>Advanced</u> (possible numbers are 0, 16, 24, 32). It is currently not possible
       to automatically determine the right number which is working for your computer.
