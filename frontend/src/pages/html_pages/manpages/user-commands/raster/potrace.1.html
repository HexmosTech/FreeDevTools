</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       potrace - transform bitmaps into vector graphics.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>potrace</b> <b>[</b><u>options</u><b>]</b> <b>[</b><u>filename...</u><b>]</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>potrace</b> is a tool for tracing a bitmap, which means, transforming a bitmap into a smooth, scalable image.
       The  input is a bitmap, which means, a pixel-based image composed of the two colors black and white only.
       The output is SVG, PDF, EPS, or one of a number of other vector formats.  A  typical  use  is  to  create
       vector  graphics  from  scanned  data,  such  as company or university logos, handwritten notes, etc. The
       resulting image is not "jaggy" like a bitmap, but smooth. It can then be rendered at any resolution.

       <b>potrace</b> can read bitmaps in the following formats: PBM, PGM, PPM (collectively known as PNM, see <a href="../man5/pnm.5.html">pnm</a>(5)),
       as well as BMP (Windows and OS/2 bitmap formats). The input image should only use the  two  colors  black
       and  white.  If other pixel values appear in the input, they will be converted to black and white using a
       simple threshold method.

       <b>potrace</b> can currently produce the following output formats: SVG, PDF, EPS, PostScript, DXF, GeoJSON, PGM,
       Gimppath, and XFig.  Additional backends might be added in the future.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The following options are supported. Dimensions (arguments of type <u>dim</u>) can  have  optional  units,  e.g.
       6.5in,  15cm, 100pt.  The default unit is inches (or centimeters, if this was configured at compile time,
       see COMPILE TIME CONFIGURATION below). For pixel-based output formats such  as  PGM,  DXF,  GeoJSON,  and
       Gimppath, the default unit is pixels.

   <b>General</b> <b>options:</b>
       <b>-h,</b> <b>--help</b>     print help message and exit.

       <b>-v,</b> <b>--version</b>  print  version  info  and  exit. This also shows the defaults that were compiled into this
                      version of <b>potrace</b>.

       <b>-l,</b> <b>--license</b>  print license info and exit.

   <b>Input/output</b> <b>options:</b>
       <u>filename</u>       Each file can hold an input image, or multiple  concatenated  input  images.  If  filename
                      arguments  are  given,  then <b>potrace</b> will by default create one output file for each input
                      filename given. The name of the output  file  is  obtained  from  the  input  filename  by
                      changing  its suffix according to the chosen backend. If changing the suffix is impossible
                      because the names of the input and output  files  would  be  identical,  then  the  output
                      filename  is  created  by  adding  the  "-out" suffix to the name of the input file. If no
                      filename arguments are given, then <b>potrace</b> acts as a filter, reading from  standard  input
                      and  writing  to  standard  output. A filename of "-" may be given to specify reading from
                      standard input.

       <b>-o</b> <u>filename</u><b>,</b> <b>--output</b> <u>filename</u>
                      write output to this file. All output is directed to the specified file. If this option is
                      used, then multiple input filenames are only allowed for multi-page backends (see  BACKEND
                      TYPES  below).  In this case, each input file may contain one or more bitmaps, and all the
                      bitmaps from all the input files are processed and the output concatenated into  a  single
                      file. A filename of "-" may be given to specify writing to standard output.

       <b>--</b>             End  of  options. Any remaining arguments are interpreted as filenames. This also disables
                      filter mode, even if no filenames are given. This is useful  for  shell  scripts,  because
                      <b>potrace</b>  <b>--</b> <b>$FILENAMES</b> will behave correctly even for an empty list of filenames. However,
                      <b>--</b> with an empty list of filenames is not permitted in conjunction  with  the  <b>-o</b>  option,
                      because this would generate a document of zero pages, which none of the backends permit.

   <b>Backend</b> <b>selection:</b>
       For general information, see also BACKEND TYPES below.

       <b>-b</b> <u>name</u><b>,</b> <b>--backend</b> <u>name</u>
                      Select  backend by name, where <u>name</u> is one of eps, postscript, ps, pdf, pdfpage, svg, dxf,
                      geojson, pgm, gimppath, xfig. Backend names can be abbreviated by a prefix as long  as  it
                      is unambiguous. Backend names are case insensitive.

       <b>-s,</b> <b>--svg,</b> <b>-b</b> <b>svg,</b> <b>--backend</b> <b>svg</b>
                      SVG  backend. The output is a Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) file.  This is a single-page,
                      variable-sized, dimension-based backend. Note that unless the  <b>-r</b>  option  is  given,  the
                      resolution of the input bitmap is assumed to be 72dpi.

       <b>-b</b> <b>pdf,</b> <b>--backend</b> <b>pdf</b>
                      PDF  backend. The output is a file in the Portable Document Format.  If the input consists
                      of multiple bitmaps, they are each rendered on a separate  page.  This  is  a  multi-page,
                      variable-sized, dimension-based backend.

       <b>-b</b> <b>pdfpage,</b> <b>--backend</b> <b>pdfpage</b>
                      The  PDFPage  backend  is  like  the  PDF  backend,  except that it is fixed-size like the
                      PostScript backend.

       <b>-e,</b> <b>--eps,</b> <b>-b</b> <b>eps,</b> <b>--backend</b> <b>eps</b>
                      EPS backend (default). The output is an encapsulated PostScript file. This  is  a  single-
                      page, variable-sized, dimension-based backend.

       <b>-p,</b> <b>--postscript,</b> <b>-b</b> <b>ps,</b> <b>--backend</b> <b>ps</b>
                      PostScript  backend.  The  output  is a PostScript file. This is a multi-page, fixed-size,
                      dimension-based backend. If the input consists of multiple bitmaps, they are each rendered
                      on a separate page.

       <b>-b</b> <b>dxf,</b> <b>--backend</b> <b>dxf</b>
                      DXF backend. The output is a file  in  the  Drawing  Interchange  Format  (DXF).  In  this
                      backend,  all  Bezier curves are approximated by piecewise circular arcs; this is suitable
                      for processing in CAD software or for machining applications using CNC tools.  This  is  a
                      single-page,  variable-sized,  pixel-based  backend.  The <b>-u</b> option has no effect for this
                      backend.

       <b>-b</b> <b>geojson,</b> <b>--backend</b> <b>geojson</b>
                      GeoJSON backend. The output is a file in the format used by some  applications  processing
                      geographical  data. In this backend, all Bezier curves are approximated by 8 straight line
                      segments. This is a single-page, variable-sized, pixel-based backend. The <b>-u</b> option has no
                      effect for this backend.

       <b>-g,</b> <b>--pgm,</b> <b>-b</b> <b>pgm,</b> <b>--backend</b> <b>pgm</b>
                      PGM backend. The output is a portable greymap (PGM) file. It is a convenient  backend  for
                      antialiasing a bitmap image. This is a multi-page, variable-sized, pixel-based backend. If
                      the input consists of more than one image, the images are concatenated in the output.

       <b>-b</b> <b>gimppath,</b> <b>--backend</b> <b>gimppath</b>
                      Gimppath  backend.  This  backend produces output suitable to be imported as a path by the
                      GNU Image Manipulation Program (Gimp) (in the Layers,  Channels  &amp;  Paths  dialog,  select
                      Paths,  then  right-click and select Import Path). The output is actually an SVG file. The
                      differences to the SVG backend are: the <b>--opaque</b> option has no effect, the  <b>--flat</b>  option
                      is  always  on, and the dimensions are pixel-based. This is a single-page, variable-sized,
                      pixel-based backend.

       <b>-b</b> <b>xfig,</b> <b>--backend</b> <b>xfig</b>
                      XFig backend. This is a single-page, fixed-size, dimension-based backend. The output is  a
                      file  in the XFig format.  Note that XFig uses X-splines instead of Bezier curves, thus it
                      is not possible to translate the output of <b>potrace</b> into  the  XFig  format  with  absolute
                      accuracy.  This  backend does a reasonable approximation using two control points for each
                      Bezier curve segment. The <b>-u</b> option has no effect for this backend, because control points
                      are always rounded to the nearest 1/1200  of  an  inch  in  XFig.  Curve  optimization  is
                      disabled. Implies <b>--opaque</b>.

   <b>Algorithm</b> <b>options:</b>
       For more detailed information on these options, see TECHNICAL DOCUMENTATION below.

       <b>-z</b> <u>policy</u><b>,</b> <b>--turnpolicy</b> <u>policy</u>
                      specify  how  to  resolve  ambiguities in path decomposition. Must be one of black, white,
                      right, left, minority, majority, or random. Default is  minority.  Turn  policies  can  be
                      abbreviated by an unambiguous prefix, e.g., one can specify min instead of minority.

       <b>-t</b> <u>n</u><b>,</b> <b>--turdsize</b> <u>n</u>
                      suppress speckles of up to this many pixels.

       <b>-a</b> <u>n</u><b>,</b> <b>--alphamax</b> <u>n</u>
                      set  the  corner  threshold parameter. The default value is 1. The smaller this value, the
                      more sharp corners will be produced. If this parameter is 0, then  no  smoothing  will  be
                      performed  and  the  output  is a polygon. If this parameter is greater than 4/3, then all
                      corners are suppressed and the output is completely smooth.

       <b>-n,</b> <b>--longcurve</b>
                      turn off curve optimization. Normally <b>potrace</b> tries to join adjacent Bezier curve segments
                      when this is possible. This option disables this behavior,  resulting  in  a  larger  file
                      size.

       <b>-O</b> <u>n</u><b>,</b> <b>--opttolerance</b> <u>n</u>
                      set  the  curve optimization tolerance. The default value is 0.2. Larger values allow more
                      consecutive Bezier curve segments to be joined  together  in  a  single  segment,  at  the
                      expense of accuracy.

       <b>-u</b> <u>n</u><b>,</b> <b>--unit</b> <u>n</u> set  output  quantization.  Coordinates  in  the  output are rounded to 1/unit pixels. The
                      default of 10 usually gives good results. For some of the debug  modes,  a  value  of  100
                      gives  more  accurate output. This option has no effect for the XFig backend, which always
                      rasterizes to 1/1200 inch, or for the DXF backend. For the GeoJSON backend, this option is
                      only a hint; the actual rounding may be more, but not less, accurate than specified.

       <b>-d</b> <u>n</u><b>,</b> <b>--debug</b> <u>n</u>
                      produce debugging output of type n. This has different effects for different backends. For
                      the PostScript/EPS backends, the values n=1,2,3 illustrate the intermediate stages of  the
                      <b>potrace</b> algorithm.

   <b>Scaling</b> <b>and</b> <b>placement</b> <b>options:</b>
       <b>-P</b> <u>format</u><b>,</b> <b>--pagesize</b> <u>format</u>
                      for  fixed-size  backends,  set page size. The following formats can be specified: A4, A3,
                      A5, B5, Letter, Legal, Tabloid, Statement, Executive, Folio, Quarto, 10x14.  Format  names
                      are  case  insensitive.  Also,  an  argument  of  the  form <u>dim</u>x<u>dim</u> is accepted to specify
                      arbitrary dimensions. The default page size is Letter (or A4, if this  was  configured  at
                      compile time, see COMPILE TIME CONFIGURATION below).  Page format names can be abbreviated
                      by  a  prefix  as  long as it is unambiguous. This option has no effect for variable-sized
                      backends.

       <b>-W</b> <u>dim</u><b>,</b> <b>--width</b> <u>dim</u>
                      set the width of output image (before any rotation and margins). If only one of width  and
                      height  is  specified,  the  other  is  adjusted  accordingly  so that the aspect ratio is
                      preserved.

       <b>-H</b> <u>dim</u><b>,</b> <b>--height</b> <u>dim</u>
                      set the height of output image. See <b>-W</b> for details.

       <b>-r</b> <u>n</u><b>[x</b><u>n</u><b>],</b> <b>--resolution</b> <u>n</u><b>[x</b><u>n</u><b>]</b>
                      for dimension-based backends, set the resolution (in dpi). One inch in  the  output  image
                      corresponds  to  this  many  pixels  in  the  input. Note that a larger value results in a
                      smaller output image.  It is possible to specify separate  resolutions  in  the  x  and  y
                      directions by giving an argument of the form <u>n</u>x<u>n</u>. For variable-sized backends, the default
                      resolution is 72dpi. For fixed-size backends, there is no default resolution; the image is
                      by  default scaled to fit on the page. This option has no effect for pixel-based backends.
                      If <b>-W</b> or <b>-H</b> are specified, they take precedence.

       <b>-x</b> <u>n</u><b>[x</b><u>n</u><b>],</b> <b>--scale</b> <u>n</u><b>[x</b><u>n</u><b>]</b>
                      for pixel-based backends, set the scaling factor. A value  greater  than  1  enlarges  the
                      output, a value between 0 and 1 makes the output smaller. The default is 1. It is possible
                      to  specify  separate  scaling factors for the x and y directions by giving an argument of
                      the form <u>n</u>x<u>n</u>. This option has no effect for dimension-based backends.  If  <b>-W</b>  or  <b>-H</b>  are
                      specified, they take precedence.

       <b>-S</b> <u>n</u><b>,</b> <b>--stretch</b> <u>n</u>
                      set  the  aspect  ratio. A value greater than 1 means the image will be stretched in the y
                      direction. A value between 0 and 1 means the image will be compressed in the y direction.

       <b>-A</b> <u>angle</u><b>,</b> <b>--rotate</b> <u>angle</u>
                      set the rotation angle (in degrees). The output will be rotated counterclockwise  by  this
                      angle. This is useful for compensating for images that were scanned not quite upright.

       <b>-M</b> <u>dim</u><b>,</b> <b>--margin</b> <u>dim</u>
                      set  all  four margins. The effect and default value of this option depend on the backend.
                      For variable-sized backends, the margins will simply be added around the output image  (or
                      subtracted, in case of negative margins). The default margin for these backends is 0.  For
                      fixed-size backends, the margin settings can be used to control the placement of the image
                      on  the  page. If only one of the left and right margin is given, the image will be placed
                      this distance from the respective edge of the page, and similarly for top and  bottom.  If
                      margins  are  given  on  opposite sides, the image is scaled to fit between these margins,
                      unless the scaling is already determined explicitly by one or more of the <b>-W</b>, <b>-H</b>,  <b>-r</b>,  or
                      <b>-x</b>  options.  By default, fixed-size backends use a non-zero margin whose width depends on
                      the page size.

       <b>-L</b> <u>dim</u><b>,</b> <b>--leftmargin</b> <u>dim</u>
                      set the left margin. See <b>-M</b> for details.

       <b>-R</b> <u>dim</u><b>,</b> <b>--rightmargin</b> <u>dim</u>
                      set the right margin. See <b>-M</b> for details.

       <b>-T</b> <u>dim</u><b>,</b> <b>--topmargin</b> <u>dim</u>
                      set the top margin. See <b>-M</b> for details.

       <b>-B</b> <u>dim</u><b>,</b> <b>--bottommargin</b> <u>dim</u>
                      set the bottom margin. See <b>-M</b> for details.

       <b>--tight</b>        remove whitespace around the image before scaling and margins are applied. If this  option
                      is  given,  calculations  of the width, height, and margins are based on the actual vector
                      outline, rather than on the outer dimensions of the input pixmap, which is the default. In
                      particular, the <b>--tight</b> option can be used to remove any existing margins from  the  input
                      image. See the file placement.pdf for a more detailed illustration.

   <b>Color</b> <b>options:</b>
       These options are only supported by certain backends. The DXF and GeoJSON backends do not support color.

       <b>-C</b> <u>#rrggbb</u><b>,</b> <b>--color</b> <u>#rrggbb</u>
                      set the foreground color of the output image. The default is black.

       <b>--fillcolor</b> <u>#rrggbb</u>
                      set  the  fill  color  of  the output image, i.e., the color of the "white" parts that are
                      enclosed by "black" parts. The default  is  to  leave  these  parts  transparent.  Implies
                      <b>--opaque</b>.   Please  note that this option sets the background color; to set the foreground
                      color, use <b>--color</b> instead.

       <b>--opaque</b>       fill in the white parts of the image opaquely, instead of leaving them  transparent.  This
                      only  applies  to  interior  white  parts,  i.e.,  those  that are enclosed inside a black
                      outline. Opaqueness is always in effect for the XFig backend.

   <b>SVG</b> <b>options:</b>
       <b>--group</b>        for SVG output, try to group related paths together. Each path is  grouped  together  with
                      all paths that are contained inside it, so that they can be moved around as a unit with an
                      SVG  editor.  This makes coloring individual components slightly more cumbersome, and thus
                      it is not the default.

       <b>--flat</b>         for SVG output, put the entire image into a single path. This makes it impossible to color
                      the components individually, and thus it is not the default. But the  resulting  SVG  file
                      can  be  more  easily  imported  by  some applications such as Gimp. In fact, the Gimppath
                      backend is a variation of the SVG backend with the <b>--flat</b> option and pixel-based  scaling.
                      The <b>--flat</b> option has no effect if <b>--opaque</b> has been selected.

   <b>PostScript/EPS/PDF</b> <b>options:</b>
       <b>-c,</b> <b>--cleartext</b>
                      do  not  compress  the  output. This option disables the use of compression filters in the
                      PostScript and PDF output. In the PostScript backend, if <b>-c</b> and <b>-q</b> are used together,  the
                      resulting output can be easily read by other programs or even by humans.

       <b>-2,</b> <b>--level2</b>   use  PostScript  level 2 compression (default). The resulting file size is ca. 40% smaller
                      than if the <b>-c</b> option is used.

       <b>-3,</b> <b>--level3</b>   use PostScript level 3 compression, if available. This gives slightly smaller  files  than
                      using  <b>-2</b>,  but the resulting files may not print on older PostScript level 2 printers. If
                      support for PostScript level 3 compression has been disabled at compile  time,  a  warning
                      message is printed and level 2 compression is used instead.

       <b>-q,</b> <b>--longcoding</b>
                      turn  off  optimized  numerical coding in PostScript output. Normally, <b>potrace</b> uses a very
                      compact numerical format to represent Bezier curves in  PostScript,  taking  advantage  of
                      existing redundancy in the curve parameters. This option disables this behavior, resulting
                      in longer, but more readable output (particularly if the <b>-c</b> option is also used).

   <b>PGM</b> <b>options:</b>
       <b>-G</b> <u>n</u><b>,</b> <b>--gamma</b> <u>n</u>
                      set  the  gamma  value  for  anti-aliasing (default is 2.2). Most computer displays do not
                      render shades of grey linearly, i.e., a grey value  of  0.5  is  not  displayed  as  being
                      exactly  half-way  between  black  and  white.  The gamma parameter corrects for this, and
                      therefore leads to nicer looking output. The default value of 2.2 is appropriate for  most
                      normal CRT displays.

   <b>Frontend</b> <b>options:</b>
       <b>-k</b> <u>n</u><b>,</b> <b>--blacklevel</b> <u>n</u>
                      set  the  threshold  level  for  converting input images to bitmaps. The <b>potrace</b> algorithm
                      expects a bitmap, thus all pixels of the input images are  converted  to  black  or  white
                      before  processing begins.  Pixels whose brightness is less than <u>n</u> are converted to black,
                      all other pixels to white. Here <u>n</u> is a number  between  0  and  1.  One  case  is  treated
                      specially:  if  the  input  is  in an indexed color format with exactly 2 colors, then the
                      blacklevel is ignored and the darker of the two colors is mapped to black.

                      Note: the method used by <b>potrace</b> for converting greymaps to bitmaps is  very  crude;  much
                      better  results  can  be  obtained if a separate program, such as <b><a href="../man1/mkbitmap.1.html">mkbitmap</a></b>(1), is used for
                      this purpose. In particular, <b><a href="../man1/mkbitmap.1.html">mkbitmap</a></b>(1), which  is  distributed  with  <b>potrace</b>,  has  the
                      ability  to  scale  and  interpolate  the image before thresholding, which results in much
                      better preservation of detail.

       <b>-i,</b> <b>--invert</b>   invert the input bitmap before processing.

   <b>Progress</b> <b>bar</b> <b>options:</b>
       <b>--progress</b>     display a progress bar for each bitmap that is processed. This is useful  for  interactive
                      use.  The default behavior is not to show any progress information.

       <b>--tty</b> <u>mode</u>     set  the  terminal  mode  for  progress  bar rendering. Possible values are "vt100", which
                      requires a vt100-compatible terminal, and "dumb", which uses only  ASCII  characters.  The
                      default is system dependent.

</pre><h4><b>BACKEND</b> <b>TYPES</b></h4><pre>
       Backends  can  be  classified in several ways, which affects the available command line options and their
       behavior:

       <b>Fixed-size</b> <b>or</b> <b>variable-sized:</b>
            For fixed-size backends, the size of the page is always the same  (for  example  Letter  or  A4,  as
            specified at compile time or by the <b>-P</b> option). By default, the image will be centered and scaled to
            fit  the  page size. For variable-size backends, the size of the page follows the size of the image.
            Currently the PostScript (PS), PDFPage, and XFig backends are fixed-size, and the remaining backends
            are variable-size.

       <b>Dimension-based</b> <b>or</b> <b>pixel-based:</b>
            In dimension-based backends, distances are measured in physical units such as inches or centimeters.
            In pixel-based backends, distances are measured in  pixel  units.  The  <b>-r</b>  option  only  works  for
            dimension-based backends, and the <b>-x</b> option only works for pixel-based backends. Currently, the DXF,
            PGM, Gimppath, and GeoJSON backends are pixel-based, and the remaining backends are dimension-based.
            Currently, all pixel-based backends are variable-sized.

       <b>Single-page</b> <b>or</b> <b>multi-page:</b>
            Single-page backends can only accept a single image. Multi-page backends can accept multiple images,
            typically one per page of output. Currently, the PostScript (PS), PDF, PDFPage, and PGM backends are
            multi-page,  and the remaining backends are single-page. Note that multiple input images can be read
            in two ways: from multiple input files (with the <b>-o</b> option), or from a single input file that  holds
            several concatenated images.

</pre><h4><b>COMPILE</b> <b>TIME</b> <b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       Certain  aspects  of  the  behavior of <b>potrace</b> can be configured at compile time by passing the following
       options to the ./configure script.

       <b>--disable-zlib</b>
            compile <b>potrace</b> without the zlib compression library. This means PostScript level 3 compression will
            not be available.

       <b>--enable-metric</b>
            compile <b>potrace</b> with centimeters as the default unit instead of inches.

       <b>--enable-a4</b>
            compile <b>potrace</b> with A4 as the default page size.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       The exit status is 0 on successful completion, 1 if the command line was invalid,  and  2  on  any  other
       error.

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
