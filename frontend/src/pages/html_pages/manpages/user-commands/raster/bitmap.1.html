</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       bitmap, bmtoa, atobm - bitmap editor and converter utilities for the X Window System

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>bitmap</b> [ <u>-options</u> ... ] [ <u>filename</u> ] [ <u>basename</u> ]

       <b>bmtoa</b> [ <b>-chars</b> ... ] [ <u>filename</u> ]

       <b>atobm</b> [ <b>-chars</b> <u>cc</u> ] [ <b>-name</b> <u>variable</u> ] [ <b>-xhot</b> <u>number</u> ] [ <b>-yhot</b> <u>number</u> ] [ <u>filename</u> ]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>bitmap</u>  program  is a rudimentary tool for creating or editing rectangular images made up of 1's and
       0's.  Bitmaps are used in X for defining clipping regions, cursor  shapes,  icon  shapes,  and  tile  and
       stipple patterns.

       The  <u>bmtoa</u> and <u>atobm</u> filters convert <u>bitmap</u> files (FILE FORMAT) to and from ASCII strings.  They are most
       commonly used to quickly print out bitmaps and to generate versions for including in text.

</pre><h4><b>COMMAND</b> <b>LINE</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Bitmap</u> supports the standard X Toolkit command line  arguments  (see  <u><a href="../man7/X.7.html">X</a></u>(7)).   The  following  additional
       arguments are supported as well.

       <b>-size</b> <u>WIDTHxHEIGHT</u>
           Specifies size of the grid in squares.

       <b>-sw</b> <u>dimension</u>
           Specifies the width of squares in pixels.

       <b>-sh</b> <u>dimension</u>
           Specifies the height of squares in pixels.

       <b>-gt</b> <u>dimension</u>
           Grid  tolerance.  If the square dimensions fall below the specified value, grid will be automatically
           turned off.

       <b>-grid,</b> <b>+grid</b>
           Turns on or off the grid lines.

       <b>-axes,</b> <b>+axes</b>
           Turns on or off the major axes.

       <b>-dashed,</b> <b>+dashed</b>
           Turns on or off dashing for the frame and grid lines.

       <b>-stippled,</b> <b>+stippled</b>
           Turns on or off stippling of highlighted squares.

       <b>-proportional,</b> <b>+proportional</b>
           Turns proportional mode on or off.  If proportional mode is on,  square  width  is  equal  to  square
           height.   If  proportional  mode  is  off, <u>bitmap</u> will use the smaller square dimension, if they were
           initially different.

       <b>-dashes</b> <u>filename</u>
           Specifies the bitmap to be used as a stipple for dashing.

       <b>-stipple</b> <u>filename</u>
           Specifies the bitmap to be used as a stipple for highlighting.

       <b>-hl</b> <u>color</u>
           Specifies the color used for highlighting.

       <b>-fr</b> <u>color</u>
           Specifies the color used for the frame and grid lines.

       <b>filename</b>
           Specifies the bitmap to be initially loaded into the program.  If the file  does  not  exist,  <u>bitmap</u>
           will assume it is a new file.

       <b>basename</b>
           Specifies the basename to be used in the C code output file.  If it is different than the basename in
           the working file, <u>bitmap</u> will change it when saving the file.

       <u>Bmtoa</u> accepts the following option:

       <b>-chars</b> <u>cc</u>
           This  option  specifies the pair of characters to use in the string version of the bitmap.  The first
           character is used for 0 bits and the second character is used for 1 bits.   The  default  is  to  use
           dashes (-) for 0's and sharp signs (#) for 1's.

       <u>Atobm</u> accepts the following options:

       <b>-chars</b> <u>cc</u>
           This  option  specifies  the  pair of characters to use when converting string bitmaps into arrays of
           numbers.  The first character represents a 0 bit and the second character represents a  1  bit.   The
           default is to use dashes (-) for 0's and sharp signs (#) for 1's.

       <b>-name</b> <u>variable</u>
           This  option specifies the variable name to be used when writing out the bitmap file.  The default is
           to use the basename of the <u>filename</u> command line argument or leave it blank if the standard input  is
           read.

       <b>-xhot</b> <u>number</u>
           This  option  specifies  the  X  coordinate  of  the  hotspot.  Only positive values are allowed.  By
           default, no hotspot information is included.

       <b>-yhot</b> <u>number</u>
           This option specifies the Y coordinate of  the  hotspot.   Only  positive  values  are  allowed.   By
           default, no hotspot information is included.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Bitmap</u>  displays  grid  in which each square represents a single bit in the picture being edited.  Actual
       size of the bitmap image, as it would appear normally and inverted, can be obtained  by  pressing  <b>Meta-I</b>
       key.   You  are free to move the image popup out of the way to continue editing.  Pressing the left mouse
       button in the popup window or <b>Meta-I</b> again will remove the real size bitmap image.

       If the bitmap is to be used for defining a cursor, one of the squares in the images may be designated  as
       the  hot spot.  This determines where the cursor is actually pointing.  For cursors with sharp tips (such
       as arrows or fingers), this is usually at the end of the tip; for symmetric cursors (such as  crosses  or
       bullseyes), this is usually at the center.

       Bitmaps  are  stored  as  small C code fragments suitable for including in applications.  They provide an
       array of bits as well as symbolic constants giving the width, height, and hot spot  (if  specified)  that
       may be used in creating cursors, icons, and tiles.

</pre><h4><b>EDITING</b></h4><pre>
       To  edit  a  bitmap  image  simply click on one of the buttons with drawing commands (<b>Point,</b> <b>Curve,</b> <b>Line,</b>
       <b>Rectangle,</b> etc.) and move the pointer into the bitmap grid window.  Press one  of  the  buttons  on  your
       mouse  and the appropriate action will take place.  You can either set, clear or invert the grid squares.
       Setting a grid square corresponds to setting a bit in the bitmap image to  1.   Clearing  a  grid  square
       corresponds to setting a bit in the bitmap image to 0.  Inverting a grid square corresponds to changing a
       bit  in  the  bitmap  image  from  0  to 1 or 1 to 0, depending what its previous state was.  The default
       behavior of mouse buttons is as specified below.

                 MouseButton1        Set
                 MouseButton2        Invert
                 MouseButton3        Clear
                 MouseButton4        Clear
                 MouseButton5        Clear

       This default behavior can be changed by setting the button function resources.  An  example  is  provided
       below.

                 bitmap*button1Function: Set
                 bitmap*button2Function: Clear
                 bitmap*button3Function: Invert
                 etc.

       The button function applies to all drawing commands, including copying, moving and pasting, flood filling
       and setting the hot spot.

</pre><h4><b>DRAWING</b> <b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       Here is the list of drawing commands accessible through the buttons at the left side of the application's
       window.  Some commands can be aborted by pressing A inside the bitmap window, allowing the user to select
       different guiding points where applicable.

       <b>Clear</b>
           This  command  clears  all  bits in the bitmap image.  The grid squares will be set to the background
           color.  Pressing C inside the bitmap window has the same effect.

       <b>Set</b> This command sets all bits in the bitmap image.  The grid squares  will  be  set  to  the  foreground
           color.  Pressing S inside the bitmap window has the same effect.

       <b>Invert</b>
           This  command inverts all bits in the bitmap image.  The grid squares will be inverted appropriately.
           Pressing I inside the bitmap window has the same effect.

       <b>Mark</b>
           This command is used to mark an area of  the  grid  by  dragging  out  a  rectangular  shape  in  the
           highlighting  color.  Once the area is marked, it can be operated on by a number of commands (see <b>Up,</b>
           <b>Down,</b> <b>Left,</b> <b>Right,</b> <b>Rotate,</b> <b>Flip,</b> <b>Cut,</b> etc.)  Only one marked area can be present at any time.  If you
           attempt to mark another area, the old mark will vanish.  The same effect can be achieved by  pressing
           <b>Shift-MouseButton1</b> and dragging out a rectangle in the grid window.  Pressing <b>Shift-MouseButton2</b> will
           mark the entire grid area.

       <b>Unmark</b>
           This  command  will  cause  the  marked  area to vanish.  The same effect can be achieved by pressing
           <b>Shift-MouseButton3</b>.

       <b>Copy</b>
           This command is used to copy an area of the grid from one location to another.  If there is no marked
           grid area displayed, <b>Copy</b> behaves just like <b>Mark</b> described above.  Once there is a marked  grid  area
           displayed  in  the  highlighting  color,  this command has two alternative behaviors.  If you click a
           mouse button inside the marked area, you will be able to  drag  the  rectangle  that  represents  the
           marked  area  to  the desired location.  After you release the mouse button, the area will be copied.
           If you click outside the marked area, <b>Copy</b> will assume that you wish to mark a  different  region  of
           the bitmap image, thus it will behave like <b>Mark</b> again.

       <b>Move</b>
           This  command  is  used  to  move  an  area  of  the grid from one location to another.  Its behavior
           resembles the behavior of <b>Copy</b> command, except that the marked area will be moved instead of copied.

       <b>Flip</b> <b>Horizontally</b>
           This command will flip the bitmap image with respect to the horizontal axes.  If a marked area of the
           grid is highlighted, it will operate only inside the marked  area.   Pressing  H  inside  the  bitmap
           window has the same effect.

       <b>Up</b>  This  command  moves  the bitmap image one pixel up.  If a marked area of the grid is highlighted, it
           will operate only inside the marked area.  Pressing UpArrow inside the bitmap  window  has  the  same
           effect.

       <b>Flip</b> <b>Vertically</b>
           This  command  will flip the bitmap image with respect to the vertical axes.  If a marked area of the
           grid is highlighted, it will operate only inside the marked  area.   Pressing  V  inside  the  bitmap
           window has the same effect.

       <b>Left</b>
           This  command  moves  the  bitmap  image  one  pixel  to  the  left.  If a marked area of the grid is
           highlighted, it will operate only inside the marked  area.   Pressing  LeftArrow  inside  the  bitmap
           window has the same effect.

       <b>Fold</b>
           This command will fold the bitmap image so that the opposite corners become adjacent.  This is useful
           when creating bitmap images for tiling.  Pressing F inside the bitmap window has the same effect.

       <b>Right</b>
           This  command  moves  the  bitmap  image  one  pixel  to  the right.  If a marked area of the grid is
           highlighted, it will operate only inside the marked area.   Pressing  RightArrow  inside  the  bitmap
           window has the same effect.

       <b>Rotate</b> <b>Left</b>
           This  command  rotates the bitmap image 90 degrees to the left (counter clockwise.)  If a marked area
           of the grid is highlighted, it will operate only inside the  marked  area.   Pressing  L  inside  the
           bitmap window has the same effect.

       <b>Down</b>
           This  command moves the bitmap image one pixel down.  If a marked area of the grid is highlighted, it
           will operate only inside the marked area.  Pressing DownArrow inside the bitmap window has  the  same
           effect.

       <b>Rotate</b> <b>Right</b>
           This  command  rotates the bitmap image 90 degrees to the right (clockwise.)  If a marked area of the
           grid is highlighted, it will operate only inside the marked  area.   Pressing  R  inside  the  bitmap
           window has the same effect.

       <b>Point</b>
           This  command  will  change  the grid squares underneath the mouse pointer if a mouse button is being
           pressed down.  If you drag the mouse button continuously, the line may not be  continuous,  depending
           on the speed of your system and frequency of mouse motion events.

       <b>Curve</b>
           This  command  will  change  the grid squares underneath the mouse pointer if a mouse button is being
           pressed down.  If you drag the mouse button  continuously,  it  will  make  sure  that  the  line  is
           continuous.   If your system is slow or <u>bitmap</u> receives very few mouse motion events, it might behave
           quite strangely.

       <b>Line</b>
           This command will change the grid squares in a line between two squares.   Once  you  press  a  mouse
           button  in the grid window, <u>bitmap</u> will highlight the line from the square where the mouse button was
           initially pressed to the square where the mouse pointer is located.  By releasing  the  mouse  button
           you will cause the change to take effect, and the highlighted line will disappear.

       <b>Rectangle</b>
           This command will change the grid squares in a rectangle between two squares.  Once you press a mouse
           button in the grid window, <u>bitmap</u> will highlight the rectangle from the square where the mouse button
           was  initially  pressed  to  the  square  where the mouse pointer is located.  By releasing the mouse
           button you will cause the change to take effect, and the highlighted rectangle will disappear.

       <b>Filled</b> <b>Rectangle</b>
           This command is identical to <b>Rectangle</b>, except at the end the rectangle will be  filled  rather  than
           outlined.

       <b>Circle</b>
           This  command  will  change the grid squares in a circle between two squares.  Once you press a mouse
           button in the grid window, <u>bitmap</u> will highlight the circle from the square where  the  mouse  button
           was  initially  pressed  to  the  square  where the mouse pointer is located.  By releasing the mouse
           button you will cause the change to take effect, and the highlighted circle will disappear.

       <b>Filled</b> <b>Circle</b>
           This command is identical to <b>Circle</b>, except at  the  end  the  circle  will  be  filled  rather  than
           outlined.

       <b>Flood</b> <b>Fill</b>
           This  command  will  flood fill the connected area underneath the mouse pointer when you click on the
           desired square.  Diagonally adjacent squares are not considered to be connected.

       <b>Set</b> <b>Hot</b> <b>Spot</b>
           This command designates one square in the grid as the hot spot if this bitmap image is to be used for
           defining a cursor.  Pressing a mouse button in the desired square will cause a diamond  shape  to  be
           displayed.

       <b>Clear</b> <b>Hot</b> <b>Spot</b>
           This command removes any designated hot spot from the bitmap image.

       <b>Undo</b>
           This  command  will  undo  the last executed command.  It has depth one, that is, pressing <b>Undo</b> after
           <b>Undo</b> will undo itself.

</pre><h4><b>FILE</b> <b>MENU</b></h4><pre>
       The File menu commands can be accessed by pressing the File button and  selecting  the  appropriate  menu
       entry,  or  by  pressing  Ctrl  key  with  another key.  These commands deal with files and global bitmap
       parameters, such as size, basename, filename etc.

       <b>New</b> This command will clear the editing area and prompt for the name of the new file to  be  edited.   It
           will not load in the new file.

       <b>Load</b>
           This  command is used to load a new bitmap file into the bitmap editor.  If the current image has not
           been saved, user will be asked whether to save or ignore the changes.  The editor can edit  only  one
           file  at  a  time.   If  you  need interactive editing, run a number of editors and use cut and paste
           mechanism as described below.

       <b>Insert</b>
           This command is used to insert a bitmap file into the image  being  currently  edited.   After  being
           prompted  for  the  filename,  click  inside  the  grid window and drag the outlined rectangle to the
           location where you want to insert the new file.

       <b>Save</b>
           This command will save the bitmap image.  It will not prompt for the filename unless it is said to be
           &lt;none&gt;.  If you leave the filename undesignated or -, the output will be piped to stdout.

       <b>Save</b> <b>As</b>
           This command will save the bitmap image after prompting for a new filename.  It should be used if you
           want to change the filename.

       <b>Resize</b>
           This command is used to resize the editing area to the new number of  pixels.   The  size  should  be
           entered  in  the  WIDTHxHEIGHT  format.   The  information in the image being edited will not be lost
           unless the new size is smaller that the current image size.  The editor was not designed to edit huge
           files.

       <b>Rescale</b>
           This command is used to rescale the editing area to the new width and height.   The  size  should  be
           entered  in the WIDTHxHEIGHT format.  It will not do antialiasing and information will be lost if you
           rescale to the smaller sizes.  Feel free to add you own algorithms for better rescaling.

       <b>Filename</b>
           This command is used to change the filename without changing the basename nor saving  the  file.   If
           you specify - for a filename, the output will be piped to stdout.

       <b>Basename</b>
           This  command  is  used  to  change  the  basename, if a different one from the specified filename is
           desired.

       <b>Quit</b>
           This command will terminate the bitmap application.  If the file was not saved, user will be prompted
           and asked whether to save the image or not.  This command is preferred over killing the process.

</pre><h4><b>EDIT</b> <b>MENU</b></h4><pre>
       The Edit menu commands can be accessed by pressing the Edit button and  selecting  the  appropriate  menu
       entry,  or  by  pressing  Meta key with another key.  These commands deal with editing facilities such as
       grid, axes, zooming, cut and paste, etc.

       <b>Image</b>
           This command will display the image being edited and its inverse in its actual  size  in  a  separate
           window.   The  window  can be moved away to continue with editing.  Pressing the left mouse button in
           the image window will cause it to disappear from the screen.

       <b>Grid</b>
           This command controls the grid in the editing area.  If the grid spacing is below the value specified
           by gridTolerance resource (8 by default), the grid will be  automatically  turned  off.   It  can  be
           enforced by explicitly activating this command.

       <b>Dashed</b>
           This  command  controls  the  stipple  for  drawing  the grid lines.  The stipple specified by dashes
           resource can be turned on or off by activating this command.

       <b>Axes</b>
           This command controls the highlighting of the main axes of the image being edited.  The actual  lines
           are  not  part  of the image.  They are provided to aid user when constructing symmetrical images, or
           whenever having the main axes highlighted helps your editing.

       <b>Stippled</b>
           This command controls the stippling of the highlighted  areas  of  the  bitmap  image.   The  stipple
           specified by stipple resource can be turned on or off by activating this command.

       <b>Proportional</b>
           This command controls the proportional mode.  If the proportional mode is on, width and height of all
           image squares are forced to be equal, regardless of the proportions of the bitmap window.

       <b>Zoom</b>
           This  command  controls  the  zoom  mode.   If there is a marked area of the image already displayed,
           bitmap will automatically zoom into it.  Otherwise, user will have to highlight an area to be  edited
           in  the zoom mode and bitmap will automatically switch into it.  One can use all the editing commands
           and other utilities in the zoom mode.  When you zoom out, undo  command  will  undo  the  whole  zoom
           session.

       <b>Cut</b> This commands cuts the contents of the highlighted image area into the internal cut and paste buffer.

       <b>Copy</b>
           This  command  copies  the  contents  of  the  highlighted image area into the internal cut and paste
           buffer.

       <b>Paste</b>
           This command will check if there are any other bitmap applications with a highlighted image area,  or
           if  there  is  something in the internal cut and paste buffer and copy it to the image.  To place the
           copied image, click in the editing window and drag the outlined image to the position where you  want
           to place i, and then release the button.

</pre><h4><b>CUT</b> <b>AND</b> <b>PASTE</b></h4><pre>
       Bitmap  supports  two cut and paste mechanisms; the internal cut and paste and the global X selection cut
       and paste.  The internal cut and paste is used when executing copy and move drawing commands and also cut
       and copy commands from the edit menu.  The global X selection cut and paste is used whenever there  is  a
       highlighted  area  of  a  bitmap  image  displayed  anywhere on the screen.  To copy a part of image from
       another bitmap editor simply highlight the desired area by using the Mark command or pressing  the  shift
       key  and  dragging  the area with the left mouse button.  When the selected area becomes highlighted, any
       other applications (such as xterm, etc.) that use primary selection will discard their  selection  values
       and  unhighlight  the  appropriate  information.  Now, use the Paste command for the Edit menu or control
       mouse button to copy the selected part of image into another (or the same) bitmap  application.   If  you
       attempt  to  do  this without a visible highlighted image area, the bitmap will fall back to the internal
       cut and paste buffer and paste whatever was there stored at the moment.

</pre><h4><b>COLORS</b></h4><pre>
       If you would like bitmap to be viewable in color, include the following in the #ifdef  COLOR  section  of
       the file you read with xrdb:

       *customization:                 -color

       This will cause bitmap to pick up the colors in the app-defaults color customization file:

           /etc/X11/app-defaults/Bitmap-color

</pre><h4><b>BITMAP</b> <b>WIDGET</b></h4><pre>
       Bitmap  widget  is  a  stand-alone  widget  for  editing raster images.  It is not designed to edit large
       images, although it may be used in that purpose as well.   It  can  be  freely  incorporated  with  other
       applications and used as a standard editing tool.  The following are the resources provided by the bitmap
       widget.
