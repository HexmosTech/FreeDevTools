</pre><h4><b>PROLOG</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       lp — send files to a printer

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       lp <b>[</b>-c<b>]</b> <b>[</b>-d <u>dest</u><b>]</b> <b>[</b>-n <u>copies</u><b>]</b> <b>[</b>-msw<b>]</b> <b>[</b>-o <u>option</u><b>]</b>... <b>[</b>-t <u>title</u><b>]</b> <b>[</b><u>file</u>...<b>]</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>lp</u> utility shall copy the input files to an output destination in an unspecified manner. The default
       output destination should be to a hardcopy device, such as a printer or microfilm recorder, that produces
       non-volatile, human-readable documents. If such a device is not available to the application, or  if  the
       system provides no such device, the <u>lp</u> utility shall exit with a non-zero exit status.

       The  actual  writing  to  the  output device may occur some time after the <u>lp</u> utility successfully exits.
       During the portion of the writing that corresponds to each input file, the implementation shall guarantee
       exclusive access to the device.

       The <u>lp</u> utility shall associate a unique <u>request</u> <u>ID</u> with each request.

       Normally, a banner page is produced to separate and identify each print job. This page may be  suppressed
       by implementation-defined conditions, such as an operator command or one of the <b>-o</b> <u>option</u> values.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>lp</u> utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <u>Section</u> <u>12.2</u>, <u>Utility</u> <u>Syntax</u>
       <u>Guidelines</u>.

       The following options shall be supported:

       <b>-c</b>        Exit only after further access to any of the input files is no longer required. The application
                 can  then  safely  delete or modify the files without affecting the output operation. Normally,
                 files are not copied, but are linked whenever possible. If the <b>-c</b> option is not given, then the
                 user should be careful not to remove any of the files before the request has  been  printed  in
                 its entirety. It should also be noted that in the absence of the <b>-c</b> option, any changes made to
                 the  named  files  after  the  request is made but before it is printed may be reflected in the
                 printed output.  On some implementations, <b>-c</b> may be on by default.

       <b>-d</b> <u>dest</u>   Specify a string that names the destination (<u>dest</u>).  If <u>dest</u> is a printer, the request shall be
                 printed only on that specific printer. If <u>dest</u> is a class of printers,  the  request  shall  be
                 printed  on the first available printer that is a member of the class. Under certain conditions
                 (printer unavailability, file space limitation, and so on), requests for specific  destinations
                 need not be accepted. Destination names vary between systems.

                 If  <b>-d</b>  is  not  specified,  and neither the <u>LPDEST</u> nor <u>PRINTER</u> environment variable is set, an
                 unspecified destination is used. The <b>-d</b> <u>dest</u> option shall take precedence over <u>LPDEST</u>, which in
                 turn shall take precedence over <u>PRINTER</u>.  Results are undefined when <u>dest</u> contains a value that
                 is not a valid destination name.

       <b>-m</b>        Send mail (see <u>mailx</u>) after the files have been printed. By  default,  no  mail  is  sent  upon
                 normal completion of the print request.

       <b>-n</b> <u>copies</u> Write  <u>copies</u>  number  of  copies of the files, where <u>copies</u> is a positive decimal integer. The
                 methods for producing multiple copies and for arranging the multiple copies when multiple  <u>file</u>
                 operands  are used are unspecified, except that each file shall be output as an integral whole,
                 not interleaved with portions of other files.

       <b>-o</b> <u>option</u> Specify printer-dependent or class-dependent <u>option</u>s.  Several such <u>option</u>s may be collected by
                 specifying the <b>-o</b> option more than once.

       <b>-s</b>        Suppress messages from <u>lp</u>.

       <b>-t</b> <u>title</u>  Write <u>title</u> on the banner page of the output.

       <b>-w</b>        Write a message on the user's terminal after the files have been printed. If the  user  is  not
                 logged in, then mail shall be sent instead.

</pre><h4><b>OPERANDS</b></h4><pre>
       The following operand shall be supported:

       <u>file</u>      A  pathname  of a file to be output. If no <u>file</u> operands are specified, or if a <u>file</u> operand is
                 <b>'-'</b>, the standard input shall be used. If a <u>file</u> operand is used, but  the  <b>-c</b>  option  is  not
                 specified,  the  process  performing  the  writing to the output device may have user and group
                 permissions that differ from that of the process invoking <u>lp</u>.

</pre><h4><b>STDIN</b></h4><pre>
       The standard input shall be used only if no <u>file</u> operands are specified, or if a  <u>file</u>  operand  is  <b>'-'</b>.
       See the INPUT FILES section.

</pre><h4><b>INPUT</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       The input files shall be text files.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of <u>lp</u>:

       <u>LANG</u>      Provide a default value for the internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See the
                 Base  Definitions  volume  of POSIX.1‐2017, <u>Section</u> <u>8.2</u>, <u>Internationalization</u> <u>Variables</u> for the
                 precedence  of  internationalization  variables  used  to  determine  the  values   of   locale
                 categories.)

       <u>LC_ALL</u>    If  set  to a non-empty string value, override the values of all the other internationalization
                 variables.

       <u>LC_CTYPE</u>  Determine the locale for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of text  data  as  characters
                 (for example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments and input files).

       <u>LC_MESSAGES</u>
                 Determine  the  locale  that  should  be  used  to affect the format and contents of diagnostic
                 messages written to standard error and informative messages written to standard output.

       <u>LC_TIME</u>   Determine the format and contents of date and time strings displayed in the <u>lp</u> banner page,  if
                 any.

       <u>LPDEST</u>    Determine  the  destination.  If  the  <u>LPDEST</u>  environment  variable  is  not  set, the <u>PRINTER</u>
                 environment variable shall be used. The <b>-d</b> <u>dest</u> option takes precedence over  <u>LPDEST</u>.   Results
                 are  undefined  when  <b>-d</b>  is  not  specified  and  <u>LPDEST</u>  contains a value that is not a valid
                 destination name.

       <u>NLSPATH</u>   Determine the location of message catalogs for the processing of <u>LC_MESSAGES</u>.

       <u>PRINTER</u>   Determine the output device or destination. If the <u>LPDEST</u> and <u>PRINTER</u> environment variables are
                 not set, an unspecified output device is used. The <b>-d</b> <u>dest</u> option and  the  <u>LPDEST</u>  environment
                 variable  shall  take precedence over <u>PRINTER</u>.  Results are undefined when <b>-d</b> is not specified,
                 <u>LPDEST</u> is unset, and <u>PRINTER</u> contains a value that is not a valid device or destination name.

       <u>TZ</u>        Determine the timezone used to calculate date and time strings displayed in the <u>lp</u> banner page,
                 if any. If <u>TZ</u> is unset or null, an unspecified default timezone shall be used.

</pre><h4><b>ASYNCHRONOUS</b> <b>EVENTS</b></h4><pre>
       Default.

</pre><h4><b>STDOUT</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>lp</u> utility shall write a <u>request</u> <u>ID</u> to the standard output, unless <b>-s</b> is specified. The format of the
       message is unspecified. The request ID can be used on systems supporting the historical <u>cancel</u> and <u>lpstat</u>
       utilities.

</pre><h4><b>STDERR</b></h4><pre>
       The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.

</pre><h4><b>OUTPUT</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>EXTENDED</b> <b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       The following exit values shall be returned:

        0    All input files were processed successfully.

       &gt;0    No output device was available, or an error occurred.

</pre><h4><b>CONSEQUENCES</b> <b>OF</b> <b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       Default.

       <u>The</u> <u>following</u> <u>sections</u> <u>are</u> <u>informative.</u>

</pre><h4><b>APPLICATION</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>pr</u> and <u>fold</u> utilities can be used to achieve reasonable formatting for the  implementation's  default
       page size.

       A  conforming  application  can  use  one  of the <u>file</u> operands only with the <b>-c</b> option or if the file is
       publicly readable and guaranteed to be available at the time of printing. This  is  because  POSIX.1‐2008
       gives  the  implementation  the  freedom  to  queue  up  the request for printing at some later time by a
       different process that might not be able to access the file.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
        1. To print file <u>file</u>:

               lp -c <u>file</u>

        2. To print multiple files with headers:

               pr <u>file1</u> <u>file2</u> | lp

</pre><h4><b>RATIONALE</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>lp</u> utility was designed to be a basic version  of  a  utility  that  is  already  available  in  many
       historical implementations. The standard developers considered that it should be implementable simply as:

           cat "$@" &gt; /dev/lp

       after  appropriate  processing  of  options,  if  that  is  how  the implementation chose to do it and if
       exclusive access could be granted (so that two  users  did  not  write  to  the  device  simultaneously).
       Although in the future the standard developers may add other options to this utility, it should always be
       able to execute with no options or operands and send the standard input to an unspecified output device.

       This  volume of POSIX.1‐2017 makes no representations concerning the format of the printed output, except
       that it must be ``human-readable'' and ``non-volatile''.  Thus, writing by default  to  a  disk  or  tape
       drive  or  a  display  terminal  would  not  qualify. (Such destinations are not prohibited when <b>-d</b> <u>dest</u>,
       <u>LPDEST</u>, or <u>PRINTER</u> are used, however.)

       This volume of POSIX.1‐2017 is worded such that a ``print  job''  consisting  of  multiple  input  files,
       possibly  in multiple copies, is guaranteed to print so that any one file is not intermixed with another,
       but there is no statement that all the files or copies have to print out together.

       The <b>-c</b> option may imply a spooling operation, but this is not required. The utility can be implemented to
       wait until the printer is ready and then wait until it is finished. Because of that, there is no  attempt
       to define a queuing mechanism (priorities, classes of output, and so on).

       On some historical systems, the request ID reported on the STDOUT can be used to later cancel or find the
       status of a request using utilities not defined in this volume of POSIX.1‐2017.

       Although  the historical System V <u>lp</u> and BSD <u>lpr</u> utilities have provided similar functionality, they used
       different names for the environment variable specifying the destination printer.  Since the name  of  the
       utility  here  is <u>lp</u>, <u>LPDEST</u> (used by the System V <u>lp</u> utility) was given precedence over <u>PRINTER</u> (used by
       the BSD <u>lpr</u> utility). Since environments of  users  frequently  contain  one  or  the  other  environment
       variable,  the  <u>lp</u>  utility  is required to recognize both. If this was not done, many applications would
       send output to unexpected output devices when users moved from system to system.

       Some have commented that <u>lp</u> has far too  little  functionality  to  make  it  worthwhile.  Requests  have
       proposed additional options or operands or both that added functionality. The requests included:

        *  Wording <u>requiring</u> the output to be ``hardcopy''

        *  A requirement for multiple printers

        *  Options for supporting various page-description languages

       Given  that  a compliant system is not required to even have a printer, placing further restrictions upon
       the behavior of the printer is not useful. Since hardcopy  format  is  so  application-dependent,  it  is
       difficult,  if  not impossible, to select a reasonable subset of functionality that should be required on
       all compliant systems.

       The term  <u>unspecified</u>  is  used  in  this  section  in  lieu  of  <u>implementation-defined</u>  as  most  known
       implementations  would  not  be  able  to  make definitive statements in their conformance documents; the
       existence and usage of printers is very  dependent  on  how  the  system  administrator  configures  each
       individual system.

       Since  the  default  destination,  device type, queuing mechanisms, and acceptable forms of input are all
       unspecified, usage guidelines for what a conforming application can do are as follows:

        *  Use the command in a pipeline, or with <b>-c</b>, so that there are no permission problems and the files can
           be safely deleted or modified.

        *  Limit output to text files of reasonable line lengths and printable characters and include no device-
           specific formatting information, such as a page description language. The meaning  of  ``reasonable''
           in  this context can only be answered as a quality-of-implementation issue, but it should be apparent
           from historical usage patterns in the industry and the locale. The <u>pr</u> and <u>fold</u> utilities can be  used
           to achieve reasonable formatting for the default page size of the implementation.

       Alternatively,  the  application  can  arrange its installation in such a way that it requires the system
       administrator or operator to provide the appropriate information on <u>lp</u> options and  environment  variable
       values.

       At  a  minimum,  having  this  utility  in this volume of POSIX.1‐2017 tells the industry that conforming
       applications require a means to print output and provides at least a  command  name  and  <u>LPDEST</u>  routing
       mechanism that can be used for discussions between vendors, application developers, and users. The use of
       ``should''  in  the  DESCRIPTION  of <u>lp</u> clearly shows the intent of the standard developers, even if they
       cannot mandate that all systems (such as laptops) have printers.

       This volume of POSIX.1‐2017 does not specify what the ownership of the process performing the writing  to
       the output device may be. If <b>-c</b> is not used, it is unspecified whether the process performing the writing
       to  the  output device has permission to read <u>file</u> if there are any restrictions in place on who may read
       <u>file</u> until after it is printed. Also, if <b>-c</b> is not used, the  results  of  deleting  <u>file</u>  before  it  is
       printed are unspecified.
