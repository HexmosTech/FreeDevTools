</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       prolix - trim chatty command outputs

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 0.03

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         # Run spammy_command and log its output, but weed out some output
         prolix -b '(spam)' -l auto -- spammy_command cmd_opt1 cmd_opt2

         # While it's running, hit enter and add another ignore term at the
         # interactive prompt
         prolix&gt; ignore_substring (more spam)

         # Weed uninteresting fields out of a log file.
         # Pipe mode is not interactive; but it accepts the same filtering
         # arguments as the full interactive mode.
         tail -f error.log | prolix -s 's/^\[(.*?\] ){3}//'

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>prolix</b> launches a command and captures its standard output and error. It suppresses uninteresting lines.
       Unlike "grep -v", it is an interactive program; hit <b>enter</b> to add suppression patterns as new anoyances
       come up on your terminal. You can weed out by full or substring line matches, as well as regexp. You can
       also apply substitutions to lines, for example shorten overly chatty fields.

       prolix can be configured to automatically store a filtered log of output from the commands that it
       captures.

       When running in a pipeline, prolix can't interact with you, but it does accept the same command line
       parameters, so it acts like a replacement for "sed", "grep -v", and "grep -E -v".

       [Planned] You can have prolix remember different profiles for different command invocations, so that if
       you often debug a server, prolix (which knows your command line) will identify what ignore/snippet
       patterns to apply to it.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Normally you will run prolix with:

           prolix [PROLIX OPTIONS] -- somecommand [COMMAND OPTIONS]

       You can also put prolix in a pipeline.

           somecommand | prolix [PROLIX OPTIONS]

       -v, --verbose
           When specified, "prolix" will add some output of its own, for example saying it's in pipe mode.

       -p, --pipe
           Force pipe mode.

       -l, --log=FILENAME
           Log  filtered  output  to FILENAME. If the argument looks like a pathname (contains a "/"), we'll use
           that. Otherwise, the output will go to the temporary directory (as defined by File::Spec-&gt;tmpdir).

           The special value "auto" lets prolix pick a filename based on the command being run.

           The substring "%d" is expanded  to  a  timestamp  in  a  path-friendly  variation  of  iso8601.  More
           substitutions may be added in the future.

       -r, --ignore-re=REGEXP
           Ignore files matching REGEXP. This is case-sensitive; use "(?i:...)" to ignore case. (-i may be added
           in the future.)

       -n, --ignore-line=LINE
           Ignore complete matches on LINE.

       -b, --ignore-substring=SUBSTRING
           Ignore lines containing SUBSTRING.

       -s, --snippet=s/SEARCH_RE/REPLACE/
           Transform  lines  by  applying  a  Perl  substitution on them. Useful, for example, in getting rid of
           uninteresting fields in a logfile.

           Here, modifiers "/i", "/g", and "/x" are honored. You can also use alternate  delimiters  instead  of
           "/", including balanced ones ("s{a}{b}".)

           We'll add facilities for doing this in a more convenient way for structured lines in future versions.
           (For example, CSV or Apache CLF.)

</pre><h4><b>INTERACTIVE</b> <b>MODE</b></h4><pre>
       When  "prolix"  launches a program itself (as opposed to pipe mode), pressing <b>enter</b> pauses the display of
       output from the program, and you're dropped into a prompt. Here you can add more patterns  to  ignore  or
       apply new snippetting rules. These will take effect on subsequent output.  Blank input returns you to the
       normal running of the command.

       The  interactive  mode has a "help" command listing available commands. Those that add new filters follow
       the long command line options. So for example, saying "ignore_substring temptation" will ignore all lines
       containing "temptation".

       You can also say "pats" to list all patterns in effect, and  "clear_all"  to  remove  them.  (Removing  a
       particular rule is not supported but we can add it if it is requested.)
