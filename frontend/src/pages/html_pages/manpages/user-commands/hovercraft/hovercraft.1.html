</pre><h4><b>INTRODUCTION</b></h4><pre>
   <b>GUI</b> <b>tools</b> <b>are</b> <b>limiting</b>
       I  used  to do presentations with typical slideshow software, such as OpenOffice/LibreOffice Impress, but
       these tools felt restricted and limiting.  I need to do a lot of reorganizing and moving around, and that
       might mean changing things from bullet lists to headings to text to pictures and  back  to  bullet  lists
       over  again.  This  happens  through  the whole process. I might realize something that was just a bullet
       point needs to be a slide, or that a set of slides for time reasons need to be shortened down  to  bullet
       points.  Much of the reorganization comes from seeing what fits on one slide and what does not, and how I
       need  to  pace  the presentation, and to some extent even what kinda of pictures I can find to illustrate
       what I try to say, and if the pictures are funny or not.

       <b>Presentation</b> <b>software</b> <b>should</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>complete</b> <b>freedom</b> <b>to</b> <b>reorganize</b> <b>your</b> <b>presentation</b>  <b>on</b>  <b>every</b>  <b>level,</b>
       <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>by</b> <b>reorganizing</b> <b>slides.</b>

       The solution for me and many others, is to use a text-markup language, like reStructuredText, Markdown or
       similar, and then use a tool that generates an HTML slide show from that.

       <b>Text-markup</b> <b>gives</b> <b>you</b> <b>the</b> <b>convenience</b> <b>and</b> <b>freedom</b> <b>to</b> <b>quickly</b> <b>move</b> <b>parts</b> <b>around</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>like.</b>

       I  chose  <u>reStructuredText</u>,  because  I know it and because it has a massive feature set. When I read the
       documentations of other text-markup langages it was not obvious if they has the features I needed or not.

   <b>Pan,</b> <b>rotate</b> <b>and</b> <b>zoom</b>
       The tools that exist to make presentations from text-markup will make slideshows that has a  sequence  of
       slides  from left to right. But the fashion now is to have presentations that rotate and zoom in and out.
       One open source solution for that is <u>impress.js</u>.

       <b>With</b> <b>impress.js</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>modern</b> <b>cool</b> <b>presentations.</b>

       But impress.js requires you to write your presentation as HTML, which is annoying, and the  markup  isn't
       flexible enough to let you quickly reorganize things from bullet points to headings etc.

       You also have to position each slide separately, and if you insert a new slide in the middle, you have to
       reposition all the slides that follow.

   <b>Hovercraft!</b>
       So what I want is a tool that takes the power, flexibility and convenience of reStructuredText and allows
       me  to generate pan, rotate and zoom presentations with impress.js, without having to manually reposition
       each slide if I reorganize a little bit of the presentation. I couldn't find one, so I made Hovercraft.

       Hovercraft’s power comes from  the  combination  of  reStructuredText’s  convenience  with  the  cool  of
       impress.js, together with a flexible and powerful solution to position the slides.

       There are four ways to position slides:

          1. Absolute  positioning:  You  simply  add X and Y coordinates to a slide, in pixels. Doing only this
             will not be fun, but someone might need it.

          2. Relative positioning to last slide: By specifying x and/or y with with a starting r,you specify the
             distance from the previous slide. By using this form of positioning you can insert a slide, and the
             other slides will just move to make space for the new slide.

          3. Relative positiong to any slide: You can reference any <u>previous</u> slide by its  id  and  specify  the
             position  relative  to it. This will work for all positioning fields. However, you should not use <b>r</b>
             as a slide id since the positioning might not behave as you expect.

          4. Automatically: If you don’t specify any position the slide will  have  the  same  settings  as  the
             previous slide. With a relative positioning, this means the slide will move as long as the previous
             slide  moved.  This  defaults  to  moving  1600px  to  the right, which means that if you supply no
             positions at all anywhere in the presentation, you get the standard slide-to-the-left presentation.

          5. With an SVG path: In this last way of positioning, you can take an SVG path from  an  SVG  document
             and  stick  it  into  the  presentation, and that slide + all slides following that has no explicit
             positioning will be positioned on that path. This can be a  bit  fiddly  to  use,  but  can  create
             awesome results, such as positioning the slides as snaking Python or similar.

       Hovercraft! also includes a presenter console that will show you your notes, slide previews and the time,
       essential tools for any presentation.

   <b>Shortcut/Navigation</b> <b>Keys:</b>
       A help popup appears upon launching a presentation; it shows the keyboard shortcuts.

       • H     -&gt; Toggle the help popup

       • Right, Down, Page Down, Space -&gt; Next slide

       • Left, Up, Page Up     -&gt; Previous slide

       • G     -&gt; Go to slide

       • P     -&gt; Open presenter console

</pre><h4><b>USING</b> <b>HOVERCRAFT!</b></h4><pre>
       You can either use Hovercraft! to generate the presentation as HTML in a target directory, or you can let
       Hovercraft! serve the presentation from its builtin webserver.

       The  latter  have  several  benefits.  One  is  that  most  webbrowsers  will  be  very reluctant to open
       popup-windows from pages served from the file system.  This is a security measure which can  be  changed,
       but it's easier to just point the browser to <u><a href="http://localhost">http://localhost</a>:8000</u> instead.

       The  second  benefit  is that Hovercraft! will monitor the source files for the presentation, and if they
       are modified Hovercraft! will generate the presentation again automatically. That way you don't  have  to
       run Hovercraft!  everytime you save a file, you only need to refresh the browser.

   <b>Parameters</b>
       <b>hovercraft</b> <b>[-h]</b> <b>[-t</b> <b>TEMPLATE]</b> <b>[-c</b> <b>CSS]</b> <b>[-j</b> <b>JS]</b> <b>[-a]</b> <b>[-s]</b> <b>[-n]</b> <b>[-p</b> <b>PORT]</b> <b>&lt;presentation&gt;</b> <b>[&lt;targetdir&gt;]</b>

       Positional arguments:

          <b>&lt;presentation&gt;</b>
                 The path to the reStructuredText presentation file.

          <b>&lt;targetdir&gt;</b>
                 The  directory where the presentation is saved. Will be created if it does not exist. If you do
                 not specify a targetdir Hovercraft! will instead start a webserver and serve  the  presentation
                 from that server.

       Optional arguments:

          <b>-h,</b> <b>--help</b>
                 Show this help.

          <b>-t</b> <b>TEMPLATE,</b> <b>--template</b> <b>TEMPLATE</b>
                 Specify  a template. Must be a .cfg file, or a directory with a <b>template.cfg</b> file. If not given
                 it will use a default template.

          <b>-c</b> <b>CSS,</b> <b>--css</b> <b>CSS</b>
                 An additional CSS file for the presentation to  use.   See  also  the  <b>:css:</b>  settings  of  the
                 presentation.

          <b>-j</b> <b>JS,</b> <b>--js</b> <b>JS</b>
                 An  additional  Javascript  file  for the presentation to use.  Added as a js-body script.  See
                 also the <b>:js-body:</b> settings of the presentation.

          <b>-a,</b> <b>--auto-console</b>
                 Open the presenter console automatically. This is useful when you  are  rehearsing  and  making
                 sure  the  presenter  notes  are  correct.  You can also set this by having <b>:auto-console:</b> <b>true</b>
                 first in the presentation.

          <b>-s,</b> <b>--skip-help</b>
                 Do not show the initial help popup. You can also set this by having <b>:skip-help:</b> <b>true</b>  first  in
                 the presentation.

          <b>-n,</b> <b>--skip-notes</b>
                 Do not include presenter notes in the output.

          <b>-p</b> <b>PORT,</b> <b>--port</b> <b>PORT</b>
                 The address and port that the server uses. Ex 8080 or 127.0.0.1:9000. Defaults to 0.0.0.0:8000.

          <b>--mathjax</b> <b>MATHJAX</b>
                 The URL to the mathjax library. (It will only be used if you have rST <b>math::</b> in your document)

          <b>-N,</b> <b>--slide-numbers</b>
                 Show  the  current  slide number on the slide itself and in the presenter console. You can also
                 set this by having <b>slide-numbers:</b> <b>true</b> in the presentation preamble.

          <b>-v,</b> <b>--version</b>
                 Show program's version number and exit

   <b>Presenter</b> <b>Console</b>
       The presenter console feature is designed for showing an annotated version of  the  presentation  on  the
       local laptop display, while showing the presentation itself on a projector.

       To  use this feature, open the presentation in a browser, and press <u>p</u>. A new browser tab will be created,
       and the browser focus will switch to that tab automatically. At this point, the two tabs are linked,  and
       the slide navigation controls will affect both tabs.

       Now, you'll need to move the presenter console tab into its own browser window. With Firefox, right-click
       on  the  tab  title, and click on Move Tab --&gt; Move to New Window. With Chromium, drag the tab title down
       and the tab will be moved into a new browser window.

       Finally, drag the presentation window onto the projector's part of the desktop, and press <u>F11</u> to make the
       presentation fullscreen.

   <b>Built</b> <b>in</b> <b>templates</b>
       There are two templates that come with Hovercraft! One is called <b>default</b> and  will  be  used  unless  you
       specify a template. This is the template you will use most of the time.

       The second is called <b>simple</b> and right now it only lacks the Goto function.  You can ignore it.

</pre><h4><b>MAKING</b> <b>PRESENTATIONS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>A</b> <b>note</b> <b>on</b> <b>terminology</b>
       Traditionally  a  presentation  is  made up of slides. Calling them "slides" is not really relevant in an
       impress.js context, as they can overlap and doesn't necessarily slide. The name "steps"  is  better,  but
       it's  also more ambiguous.  Hence impress.js uses the terms "slide" and "step" as meaning the same thing,
       and so does Hovercraft!

   <b>Hovercraft!</b> <b>syntax</b>
       Presentations are reStructuredText files. If you are reading this documentation  from  the  source  code,
       then you are looking at a reStructuredText document already.

       It's fairly simple, you underline headings to mark them as headings:

          This becomes a h1
          =================

          And this a h2
          -------------

       The  different  ways of underlining them doesn't mean anything, instead the order of them is relevant, so
       the first type of underline encountered in the file will make a level 1 heading, the second type a  level
       2 heading and so on. In this file = is used for level 1, and - for level 2.

       You can also mark text as <u>italic</u> or <b>bold</b>, with <b>*single</b> <b>asterixes*</b> or <b>**double</b> <b>asterixes**</b> respectively.

       You can also have bullet lists:

          * Bullet 1

            * Bullet 1.1

          * Bullet 2

          * Bullet 3

       And numbered lists:

          1. Item 1

              1.1. Item 1.1

          2. Item 2

          3. Item 3

       You can include images:

          .. image:: path/to/image.png
              :height: 600px
              :width: 800px

       As  you  see  you  can  also  specify  height  and  width and loads of other <u>parameters</u>, but they are all
       optional.

       You can also include videos:

          .. raw:: html

              &lt;video width="100%" controls&gt;
                  &lt;source src="./path/to/your/video.mp4" type="video/mp4"&gt;
                  Your browser does not support the video element.
              &lt;/video&gt;

       or audio:

          .. raw:: html

              &lt;audio controls&gt;
                  &lt;source src="./path/to/your/audio.mp3" type="audio/mpeg"&gt;
                  Your browser does not support the audio element.
              &lt;/audio&gt;

       And you can mark text as being preformatted. You do that by ending the previous row with  double  colons,
       or have a row of double colons by itself:

          ::

              This code here will be preformatted
               and shown with a  monospaced font
              and    all    spaces     preserved.

       If you want to add source code, you can use the <b>code</b> directive, and get syntax highlighting:

          .. code:: python

              def some_example_code(foo):
                  return foo * foo

       The syntax highlighting is done by <u>Pygments</u> and supports lots and lots of <u>languages</u>.

       You  are  also  likely  to  want  to  put a title on the presentation. You do that by having a <b>..</b> <b>title::</b>
       statement before the first slide:

          .. title:: This is the presentation title

       That is the most important things you'll need to know about reStructuredText  for  making  presentations.
       There  is  a  lot  more to know, and a lot of advanced features like links, footnotes, and more. It is in
       fact advanced enough so you can write a whole <u>book</u> in it, but for  all  that  you  need  to  read  the  ‐
       <u>documentation</u>.

   <b>Presenter</b> <b>notes</b>
       To add presenter notes, that will be displayed in the presenter console, use the following syntax:

          .. note::

              Here goes the presenter note.

   <b>External</b> <b>files</b>
       Any  image file referenced in the presentation by a relative path will be copied to the target directory,
       keeping it's relative path to the presentation. The same goes for images or fonts referenced in  any  CSS
       files used by the presentation or the template.

       Images or fonts referenced by absolute paths or URI's will not be copied.

   <b>Styling</b> <b>your</b> <b>Presentation</b>
       The css that is included by the default template are:

       • <b>highlight.css</b>  contains  a default style for code syntax highlighting, as that otherwise would be a lot
         of work. If you don't like the default colors or styles in the  highlighting,  this  is  the  file  you
         should copy and modify.

       • <b>hovercraft.css</b>,  which  only  includes  the bare minimum: It hides the impress.js fallback message, the
         presenter notes, and sets up a useful default of having a step width be 1000 pixels wide.

       For this reason you want to include your own CSS to style your slides. To include a CSS file  you  add  a
       <b>:css:</b>-field at the top of the presentation:

          :css: css/presentation.css

       You can also optionally specify that the css should be only valid for certain CSS media:

          :css-screen,projection: css/presentation.css
          :css-print: css/print.css

       You  can  specify  any  number  of  css  files  in  this  way.  You can also add one extra CSS-file via a
       command-line parameter:

          hovercraft --css=my_extra.css presentationfile.rst outdir/

   <b>Styling</b> <b>the</b> <b>console</b>
       You can also optionally add styles to your slides that are only used when  the  slide  is  shown  in  the
       presenter console:

          :css-preview: css/slidepreview.css

       You can also style the presenter console itself:

          :css-console: css/console.css

       There  are  default styles that are automatic, anything you add in the file for the css-console will just
       be to override the existing styling.

   <b>Adding</b> <b>Javascript</b>
       In a similar fashion you can add Javascript files to either header or body:

          :js-header: js/firstjsfile.js
          :js-body: js/secondjsfile.js

       You can also add one extra Javascript-file via a command-line parameter:

          hovercraft --js=my_extra.js presentationfile.rst outdir/

   <b>Adding</b> <b>Headers</b> <b>and</b> <b>Footers</b>
       If you want static content, content that doesn't move with each slide; for example a header, footer, your
       company logo or a slide background pattern, then you can insert that content with the header  and  footer
       commands:

          .. header::

             .. image:: images/company-logo.png

          .. footer::

              "How to use Hovercraft", Yern Busfern, ImaginaryCon 2017

       The  header  will  be located in the resulting HTML before the first slide and the footer will be located
       after the last slide. However, they will be displayed statically on every slide, and  you  will  have  to
       position them with CSS. By default the header will be displayed behind the slides and the footer in front
       of  the  slides, so the header is useful for background designs and the footer for designs that should be
       in the foreground.

       It doesn't matter where in the presentation you add these commands, I would recommend that you  add  them
       before the first slide.

   <b>Styling</b> <b>a</b> <b>specific</b> <b>slide</b>
       If  you want to have specific styling for a specific slide, it is a good idea to give that slide a unique
       ID:

          :id: the-slide-id

       You can then style that slide specifically with:

          div#the-slide-id {
              /* Custom CSS here */
          }

       If you don't give it a specific ID, it will get an ID based on its sequence number. And  that  means  the
       slide's  ID  will change if you insert or remove slides that came before it, and in that case your custom
       stylings of that slide will stop working.

   <b>Adding</b> <b>a</b> <b>custom</b> <b>class</b> <b>to</b> <b>slides</b>
       If you want to apply the same style to one or more slides you may prefer adding a class to  those  slides
       instead (or in addition to) a unique ID:

          :class: my-custom-class

       You can then style those slides by adding CSS rules with:

          .my-custom-class {
              /* Custom CSS here */
          }

   <b>Adding</b> <b>a</b> <b>custom</b> <b>directive</b>
       If  you  want to use a <u>custom</u> <u>docutils</u> <u>directive</u>, you'll want to run hovercraft in the same process where
       you register your directive. For example, you can create a custom startup script like the following:

          from docutils import nodes
          from docutils.parsers.rst import Directive, directives

          import hovercraft

          class HelloWorld(Directive):
              def run(self):
                  para = nodes.paragraph(text='Hello World')
                  return [para]

          directives.register_directive('hello-world', HelloWorld)

          if __name__ == "__main__":
              cmd = ['--skip-help', 'slides.rst']
              hovercraft.main(cmd)

       While creating your own directive might be daunting, it's possible to reuse useful directives from  other
       projects.  For  example,  you  can  reuse  <u>Pelican's</u>  <u>custom</u> <u>code</u> <u>block</u>, which adds an <b>hl_lines</b> option to
       highlight specific lines of code. To use that directive, simply add the following  import  to  the  above
       script:

          import pelican.rstdirectives

   <b>Portable</b> <b>presentations</b>
       Since  Hovercraft!  generates  HTML5  presentations,  you  can use any computer that has a modern browser
       installed to view or show the presentation. This allows you both to put up the presentation online and to
       use a borrowed computer for your conference or customer presentation.

       When you travel you don't know what equipment you have to use when you show your  presentaton,  and  it's
       surprisingly  common to encounter a projector that refuses to talk to your computer. It is also very easy
       to forget your dongle if you have a MacBook, and there have even been cases of computers going completely
       black and dead when you connect them to a projector, even though all other computers seem to work fine.

       The main way of making sure your presentation is  portable  is  to  try  it  on  different  browsers  and
       different  computers.  But  the  latter  can be unfeasible, not everyone has both Windows, Linux and OS X
       computers at home. To help make your presentations portable  it  is  a  good  idea  to  define  your  own
       @font-face's  and  use  them,  so you are sure that the target browser will use the same fonts as you do.
       Hovercraft! will automatically find @font-face  definitions  and  copy  the  font  files  to  the  target
       directory.

   <b>impress.js</b> <b>fields</b>
       The  documentation  on  impress.js  is contained as comments in the <u>demo</u> <u>html</u> <u>file</u>. It is not always very
       clear, so here comes a short summary for convenience.

       The different data fields that impress.js will use in 0.5.3,  which  is  the  current  version,  are  the
       following:

       • <b>data-transition-duration</b>:  The time it will take to move from one slide to another. Defaults to 1000 (1
         second). This is only valid on the presentation as a whole.

       • <b>data-perspective</b>: Controls the "perspective" in the 3d effects. It defaults to 500.  Setting  it  to  0
         disables 3D effects.

       • <b>data-x</b>: The horizontal position of a slide in pixels. Can be negative.

       • <b>data-y</b>: The vertical position of a slide in pixels. Can be negative.

       • <b>data-scale</b>:  Sets  the  scale  of a slide, which is what creates the zoom.  Defaults to 1. A value of 4
         means the slide is four times larger. In short: Lower means zooming in, higher means zooming out.

       • <b>data-rotate-z</b>: The rotation of a slide in the x-axis, in degrees. This  will  cause  the  slide  to  be
         rotated clockwise or counter-clockwise.

       • <b>data-rotate</b>: The same as <b>data-rotate-z</b>.

       • <b>data-rotate-x</b>:  The  rotation of a slide in the x-axis, in degrees. This means you are moving the slide
         in a third dimension compared with other slides. This is generally cool effect, if used right.

       • <b>data-rotate-y</b>: The rotation of a slide in the x-axis, in degrees.

       • <b>data-z</b>: This controls the position of the slide on the z-axis. Setting this value to -3000  means  it's
         positioned  -3000  pixels  away.  This  is  only  useful  when  you use <b>data-rotate-x</b> or <b>data-rotate-y</b>,
         otherwise it will only give the impression that the slide is made smaller, which isn't really useful.

   <b>Hovercraft!</b> <b>specialties</b>
       Hovercraft! has some  specific  ways  it  uses  reStructuredText.  First  of  all,  the  reStructuredText
       "transition"  is  used to mark the separation between different slides or steps. A transition is simply a
       line with four or more dashes:

          ----

       You don't have to use dashes, you can use any of the characters used to underline headings, <b>=</b> <b>-</b> <b>`</b> <b>:</b> <b>.</b> <b>'</b> <b>"</b>
       <b>~</b> <b>^</b> <b>_</b> <b>*</b> <b>+</b> <b>#</b>. And just as width headings, using different characters indicates different "levels". In this
       way you can make a hierarchical presentation with multiple "levels" of steps.  However,  impress.js  does
       not  support  that,  so  this  is only useful if you make your own templates that uses another Javascript
       library, for example <u>Reveal.js</u>. If you have more than one transition level with  the  templates  included
       with Hovercraft, the resulting presentation may behave strangely.

       All  reStructuredText  fields  are  converted  into  attributes  on  the current tag.  Most of these will
       typically be ignored by the rendering to HTML, but there are two  places  where  the  tags  will  make  a
       difference, and that is by putting them first in the document, or first on a slide.

       Any fields you put first in a document will be rendered into attributes on the main impress.js <b>&lt;div&gt;</b>. The
       only   ones   that  Hovercraft!  will  use  are  <b>data-transition-duration</b>,  <b>skip-help</b>,  <b>auto-console</b>  and
       <b>slide-numbers</b>.

       Any fields you put first in a slide will be rendered into attributes on the slide  <b>&lt;div&gt;</b>.  This  is  used
       primarily  to  set  the  position/zoom/rotation  of  the  slide, either with the <b>data-x</b>, <b>data-y</b> and other
       impress.js settings, or the <b>hovercraft-path</b> setting, more on that later.

       Hovercraft! will start making the first slide when it first encounters either a transition or  a  header.
       Everything that comes before that will belong to the presentation as a whole.

       A presentation can therefore look something like this:

          :data-transition-duration: 2000
          :skip-help: true

          .. title: Presentation Title

          ----

          This is the first slide
          =======================

          Here comes some text.

          ----

          :data-x: 300
          :data-y: 2000

          This is the second slide
          ========================

          #. Here we have

          #. A numbered list

          #. It will get correct

          #. Numbers automatically

   <b>Showing</b> <b>lists</b> <b>item</b> <b>by</b> <b>item</b>
       A  common  feature  in  presentation software is to have a list that appears item by item. This is called
       "substeps" and is enabled by setting the <b>substep</b> class on the items  to  be  shown.  In  Hovercraft!  the
       easiest was to do this is to use paragraphs, since you can set the class on multiple paragraphs at once:

          .. class:: substep

              This paragraph will be shown when you press &lt;next&gt;

              This will show on the second &lt;next&gt; press

              And this will be shown third

       You  can  also  set  the  class just on individual paragraphs, in which case all other paragraphs will be
       visible from the beginning:

          This paragraph will always be visible

          .. class:: substep

              This paragraph will be shown when you press &lt;next&gt;

          And this paragraph will also be always visible

          .. class:: substep

              And this paragraph will show second

       You can also do it with bullet lists or numbered lists:

          .. class:: substep

              * This is an unordered list

                  * In two levels

                  * One new item will be shown on every &lt;next&gt; press

       And, as with pagarphs you can have individual control of each  item.  But  due  to  the  ReStructuredText
       syntax  you  can't  have individual control on the first item of a list, it will always be shown from the
       start:

          #. This will be shown when you get to this slide

             .. class:: substep

          #. The second item shows only after you press &lt;next&gt;

          #. This also will always be shown.

             .. class:: substep

          #. And this will be shown after another &lt;next&gt; press.

   <b>Mathematical</b> <b>equations</b>
       If you add a <b>math</b> directive then hovercraft! will add a link to the <u>MathJax</u> CDN so that this:

          .. math:: e^{i \pi} + 1 = 0

       will be rendered by the MathJax javascript library. The math directive can also be used as a "role"  with
       the equations inlined with the text flow. Note that if you use the math statement, by default the MathJax
       library  will  be loaded from the internet, meaning that your presentation will need network connectivity
       to work, which can  be  a  problem  when  presenting  and  conferences,  which  often  have  bad  network
       connectivity.

       This can be solved by specifying a local copy of mathjax with the --mathjax command line.

   <b>Relative</b> <b>positioning</b>
       Hovercraft! gives you the ability to position slides relative to each other.  You do this by starting the
       coordinates  with  "r".  This will position the slide 500 pixels to the right and a thousand pixels above
       the previous slide:

          :data-x: r500
          :data-y: r-1000

       Relative paths allow you to insert and remove slides and have other  slides  adjust  automatically.  It's
       generally the most useful way of positioning.

   <b>Automatic</b> <b>positioning</b>
       If  you don't specify an attribute, the slide settings will be the same as the previous slide. This means
       that if you used relative positioning, the next slide will move the same distance.

       This gives a linear movement, and your slides will end up in a straight line.

       By default the movement is 1600 pixels to the right, which means that if you don't position any slides at
       all, you get a standard presentation where the slides will simply slide from right to left.

   <b>SVG</b> <b>Paths</b>
       Hovercraft! supports positioning slides along an SVG path. This is handy, as you can create a drawing  in
       a software that supports SVG, and then copy-paste that drawings path into your presentation.

       You specify the SVG path with the <b>:hovercraft-path:</b> field. For example:

          :hovercraft-path: m275,175 v-150 a150,150 0 0,0 -150,150 z

       Every following slide that does not have any explicit positioning will be placed on this path.

       There are some things you need to be careful about when using SVG paths.

   <b>Relative</b> <b>and</b> <b>absolute</b> <b>coordinates</b>
       SVG  coordinates  can  either  be absolute, with a reference to the page origin; or relative, which is in
       reference to the last point. Hovercraft! can handle both, but what it can  not  handle  very  well  is  a
       mixture of them.

       Specifically,  if you take an SVG path that starts with a relative movement and extract that from the SVG
       document, you will lose the context. All coordinates later must then also be relative.  If  you  have  an
       absolute  coordinate  you  then  suddenly  regain  the  context,  and everything after the first absolute
       coordinate will be misplaced compared to the points that come before.

       Most notable, the open source software "Inkscape" will mix absolute  and  relative  coordinates,  if  you
       allow  it  to  use  relative  coordinates.  You  therefore  need to go into it's settings and uncheck the
       checkbox that allows you to use relative coordinates. This forces Inkscape to  save  all  coordinates  as
       absolute, which will work fine.

   <b>Start</b> <b>position</b>
       By  default  the  start  position  of  the path, and hence the start position of the first slide, will be
       whatever the start position would have been if the slide had no positioning at all. If you want to change
       this position then just include <b>:data-x:</b> or <b>:data-y:</b> fields. Both relative and absolute positioning  will
       work here.

       In all cases, the first <b>m</b> or <b>M</b> command of the SVG path is effectively ignored, but you have to include it
       anyway.

   <b>SVG</b> <b>transforms</b>
       SVG allows you to draw up path and then transform it. Hovercraft! has no support for these transforms, so
       before you extract the path you should make sure the SVG software doesn't use transforms. In Inkscape you
       can do this by the "Simplify" command.

   <b>Other</b> <b>SVG</b> <b>shapes</b>
       Hovercraft!  doesn't  support  other  SVG  shapes,  just  the  path. This is because organising slides in
       squares, etc, is quite simple anyway, and the shapes can be made into paths. Usually in the software  you
       will have to select the shape and tell your software to make it into a path. In Inkscape, transforming an
       object  into  a  path  will  generally  mean that the whole path is made of CubicBezier curves, which are
       unnecessarily complex. Using the "Simplify" command in Inkscape is usually enough to make the shapes into
       paths.

   <b>Shape-scaling</b>
       Hovercraft! will scale the path so that all the slides that need to fit into the path will fit  into  the
       path.  If you therefore have several paths in your presentation, they will <b>not</b> keep their relative sizes,
       but will be resized so the slides fit. If you need to have the shapes keep their relative sizes, you need
       to combine them into one path.

   <b>Examples</b>
       To see how to  use  Hovercraft!  in  practice,  there  are  three  example  presentations  included  with
       Hovercraft!

</pre><h4><b>DESIGNING</b> <b>YOUR</b> <b>PRESENTATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       There  are several tricks to making presentations. I certainly do not claim to be an expert, but here are
       some beginners hints.

   <b>Take</b> <b>it</b> <b>easy</b>
       Don't go too heavy on the zoom. Having a difference between two slides in scale of more than 5 is  rarely
       going to look good. It would make for a nice cool zooming effect if it did, but this is not what browsers
       are designed for, so it won't.

       And  the  3D  effects  can  be  really  cool  if  used well. But not all the time, it gets tiring for the
       audience.

       Try, if you can, to use the zoom and 3D effects when they make sense in the  presentation.  You  can  for
       example  mention the main topics on one slide, and then zoom in on each topic when you discuss it in more
       detail. That way the effects help clarify the presentation, rather than distract from it.

   <b>Custom</b> <b>fonts</b>
       Browsers tend to render things subtly differently.

       They also have different default fonts, and different operating systems have different implementations of
       the same fonts. So to make sure you have as much control over the design as possible, you  should  always
       include  fonts  with  the presentation. A good source for free fonts are Google <u>Webfonts</u>. Those fonts are
       free and open source, so you can use them with no cost and no risk  of  being  sued.  They  can  also  be
       downloaded or included online.

   <b>Online</b> <b>vs</b> <b>Downloaded</b>
       If  you  are  making  a  presentation  that  is going to run on your computer at a conference or customer
       meeting, always download the fonts and have them as a part of the presentation.  Put  them  in  a  folder
       called <b>fonts</b> under the folder where your presentation is.

       You  also  need to define the font-family in your CSS. <u>Font</u> <u>Squirrel</u>'s webfont generator will provide you
       with a platform-independent toolkit for generating both the varius font formats and the CSS.

       If the presentation is online only, you can put an <b>@include</b>-statement in  your  CSS  to  include  Googles
       webfonts directly:

          @import url(<a href="http://fonts.googleapis.com/css">http://fonts.googleapis.com/css</a>?family=Libre+Baskerville|Racing+Sans+One|Satisfy);

       But  don't  use  this  for  things you need to show on your computer, as it requires you to have internet
       access.

   <b>Test</b> <b>with</b> <b>different</b> <b>browsers</b>
       If you are putting the presentation online, test it with a couple of major browsers, to make sure nothing
       breaks and that everything still looks good.  Not only are there subtle differences in how things may get
       positioned, different browsers are also good at different things.

       I've tested some browsers, all on Ubuntu, and  it  is  likely  that  they  behave  differently  on  other
       operating systems, so you have to try for yourself.

   <b>Firefox</b>
       Firefox  18  is  quite  slow  to  use with impress.js, especially for 3D stuff, so it can have very jerky
       movements from slide to slide. It does keep text looking good no matter how much you zoom. On  the  other
       hand, it refuses to scale text infinitely, so if you scale too much characters will not grow larger, they
       will instead start moving around.

       Firefox 19 is better, but for 3D stuff it's still a bit slow.

   <b>Chrome</b>
       Chrome  24 is fast, but will not redraw text in different sizes, but will instead create an image of them
       and rescale them, resulting in the previous slide having a fuzzy pixelated effect.

   <b>Epiphany</b>
       Epiphany 3.4.1 is comparable to Firefox 19, possibly a bit smoother, and the text looks good. But it  has
       bugs  in  how  it  handles  3D  data,  and the location bar is visible in fullscreen mode, making it less
       suitable for any sort of presentation.

</pre><h4><b>TEMPLATES</b></h4><pre>
       Luckily, for most cases you don't need to create your own template,  as  the  default  template  is  very
       simple  and  most things you need to do is doable with css. However, I don't want Hovercraft! to set up a
       wall where it isn't flexible enough for your needs, so I added support to make your own templates.

       You need to create your own template if you are unsatisfied with the HTML that Hovercraft! generates, for
       example if you need to use another version of HTML or if the reStructuredText you are using  isn't  being
       rendered  in  a way that is useful for you. Although if you aren't happy with the HTML generated from the
       reStructuredText that could very well be a bug, so open an issue on <u>Github</u> for discussion.

       Hovercraft! generates presentations by converting the reStructuredText into XML and then  using  XSLT  to
       translate the XML into HTML.

       Templates  are  directories with a configuration file, a template XSL file, and any number of CSS, JS and
       other resource files.

   <b>The</b> <b>template</b> <b>configuration</b> <b>file</b>
       The configuration file is normally called template.cfg, but if you have several  configuration  files  in
       one template directory, you can specify which one to use by specifying the full path to the configuration
       file. However, if you just specify the template directory, <b>template.cfg</b> will be used.

       Template  files  are in configparser format, which is an extended ini-style format. They are very simple,
       and have only one section, <b>[hovercraft]</b>. Any other sections will be ignored. Many of the  parameters  are
       lists  that  often do not fit on one line. In that case you can split the line up over several lines, but
       indenting the lines. The amount of indentation doesn't make any difference, except aesthetically.

       The parameters in the <b>[hovercraft]</b> section are:

          • <b>template</b> The name of the xsl template.

          • <b>css</b> A list of CSS filenames separated by whitespace. These files will get included in the final file
            with "all" as the media specification.

          • <b>css-&lt;media&gt;</b> A list of CSS filenames separated by whitespace. These files will get  included  in  the
            final  file with the media given in the parameter. So the files listed for the parameter "css-print"
            will get "print" as their media specification and a key like "css-screen,print"  will  return  media
            "screen,print".

          • <b>js-header</b>  A  list of filenames separated by whitespace. These files will get included in the target
            file as header script links.

          • <b>js-body</b> A list of filenames separated by whitespace. These files will get  included  in  the  target
            file  as  script  links  at  the  end  of  the  file.  The  files  impress.js, impressConsole.js and
            hovercraft.js typically need to be included here.

          • <b>resources</b> A list of filenames separated by whitespace that will be copied to the  target  directory,
            but  nothing  else  is done with them. Images and fonts used by CSS will be copied anyway, but other
            resources may be added here.

          • <b>resource-directories</b> A list of directory names separated by whitespace. These will be  treated  like
            <b>resources</b>  above,  ie  only  copied  to  the target directory. The directory contents will be copied
            recursively, but hidden files (like files starting with a <b>.</b> are ignored.

       An example:

          [hovercraft]
          template = template.xsl

          css = css/screen.css

          css-print = css/print.css

          js-header = js/dateinput.js

          js-body = js/impress.js
                    js/hovercraft.js

          resources = images/back.png
                      images/forward.png
                      images/up.png
                      images/down.png

   <b>The</b> <b>template</b> <b>file</b>
       The file specified with the <b>template</b> parameters is  the  actual  XSLT  template  that  will  perform  the
       translation from XML to HTML.

       Most of the time you can just copy the default template file in <b>hovercraft/templates/default/template.xsl</b>
       and modify it. XSLT is very complex, but modifying the templates HTML is quite straightforward as long as
       you don't have to touch any of the <b>&lt;xsl:...&gt;</b> tags.

       Also,  the HTML that is generated is XHTML compatible and quite straightforward, so for the most case all
       you would need to generate another version of HTML, for example strict XHTML,  would  be  to  change  the
       doctype.

       But  if  you need to add or change the main generated HTML you can add and change HTML statements in this
       main file as you like. See for example how the little help-popup is added to the bottom of the HTML.

       If you want to change the way the reStructuredText is rendered things get slightly more complex. The XSLT
       rules that convert the reStructuredText XML into HTML are contained in a separate file, <b>reST.xsl</b>. For the
       most part you can just include it in the template file with the following code:

          &lt;xsl:import href="resource:templates/reST.xsl" /&gt;

       The <b>resource:</b> part here is not a part of XSLT, but a part of Hovercraft!  It tells the  XSLT  translation
       that  the  file  specified  should not be looked up on the file system, but as a Python package resource.
       Currently the <b>templates/reST.xsl</b> file is the only XSLT resource import available.

       If you need to change the way reStructuredText is rendered you need to make  a  copy  of  that  file  and
       modify  it.  You  then  need  to  make a copy of the main template and change the reference in it to your
       modified XSLT file.

       None of the XSLT files need to be copied to the target, and should not be listed as  a  resource  in  the
       template configuration file.
