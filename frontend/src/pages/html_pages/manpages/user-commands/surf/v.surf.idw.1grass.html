   <b>Flags:</b>
       <b>-n</b>
           Don’t index points by raster cell
           Slower but uses less memory and includes points from outside region in the interpolation

       <b>--overwrite</b>
           Allow output files to overwrite existing files

       <b>--help</b>
           Print usage summary

       <b>--verbose</b>
           Verbose module output

       <b>--quiet</b>
           Quiet module output

       <b>--ui</b>
           Force launching GUI dialog

   <b>Parameters:</b>
       <b>input</b>=<u>name</u> <b>[required]</b>
           Name of input vector map
           Or data source for direct OGR access

       <b>layer</b>=<u>string</u>
           Layer number or name
           Vector  features  can have category values in different layers. This number determines which layer to
           use. When used with direct OGR access this is the layer name.
           Default: <u>1</u>

       <b>column</b>=<u>name</u>
           Name of attribute column with values to interpolate
           If not given and input is 2D vector map then category values are used. If input is 3D vector map then
           z-coordinates are used.

       <b>output</b>=<u>name</u> <b>[required]</b>
           Name for output raster map

       <b>npoints</b>=<u>count</u>
           Number of interpolation points
           Default: <u>12</u>

       <b>power</b>=<u>float</u>
           Power parameter
           Greater values assign greater influence to closer points
           Default: <u>2.0</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>v.surf.idw</u> fills a raster matrix with interpolated values generated from  a  set  of  irregularly  spaced
       vector  data points using numerical approximation (weighted averaging) techniques. The interpolated value
       of a cell is determined by values of nearby data points and the distance of the  cell  from  those  input
       points.   In comparison with other methods, numerical approximation allows representation of more complex
       surfaces (particularly those with anomalous features), restricts the spatial influence of any errors, and
       generates the interpolated surface from the data points.

       Values to interpolate are read from <b>column</b> option. If this option is not  given  than  the  program  uses
       <u>categories</u> as values to interpolate or <u>z-coordinates</u> if the input vector map is 3D.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       The  amount  of  memory  used  by  this  program is related to the number of vector points in the current
       region.  If the vector point map is very dense (i.e., contains many data points), the program may not  be
       able  to  get  all  the  memory it needs from the system.  The time required to execute is related to the
       resolution of the current region, after an initial delay determined by the time taken to read  the  input
       vector points map.

       Note that vector features without category in given <b>layer</b> are <u>skipped</u>.

       If  the  user  has a mask set, then interpolation is only done for those cells that fall within the mask.
       The module has two separate modes of operation for selecting the vector  points  that  are  used  in  the
       interpolation:

       Simple, non-indexed mode (activated by <b>-n</b> flag)
           When  the  <b>-n</b>  flag  is  specified, all vector points in the input vector map are searched through in
           order to find the <b>npoints</b> closest points to the centre of each cell in the output  raster  map.  This
           mode of operation can be slow in the case of a very large number of vector points.

       Default, indexed mode
           By  default  (i.e.  if <b>-n</b> flag is <u>not</u> specified), prior to the interpolation, input vector points are
           indexed according to which output raster cell they fall into. This means that only cells  nearby  the
           one  being  interpolated need to be searched to find the <b>npoints</b> closest input points, and the module
           can run many times faster on dense input maps. It should be noted that:

           •   Only vector points that lie within the current region are used in the interpolation. If there are
               points outside the current region, this may have an effect on the  interpolated  value  of  cells
               near the edges of the region, and this effect will be more pronounced the fewer points there are.
               If  you  wish to also include points outside the region in the interpolation, then either use the
               <b>-n</b> flag, or set the region to a larger extent (covering all input points) and use a mask to limit
               interpolation to a smaller area.

           •   If more than <b>npoints</b> points fall within a given  cell  then,  rather  than  interpolating,  these
               points  are aggregated by taking the mean. This avoids the situation where some vector points can
               be discarded and not used in the interpolation, for very dense input maps. Again, use the <b>-n</b> flag
               if you wish to use only the <b>npoints</b> closest points to the cell centre under all circumstances.

       The <b>power</b> parameter defines an exponential distance weight.  Greater values assign greater  influence  to
       values  closer  to  the point to be interpolated. The interpolation function peaks sharply over the given
       data points for 0 &lt; <u>p</u> &lt; 1 and more smoothly for larger values. The default value for the power  parameter
       is 2.

       By setting <b>npoints</b>=1, the module can be used to calculate raster Voronoi diagrams (Thiessen polygons).
