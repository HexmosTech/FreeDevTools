       detci - Determinant Configuration Interaction Program

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  program  <b>detci</b> diagonalizes the nonrelativistic electronic Hamiltonian operator in a basis of Slater
       determinants.  The set of determinants used (CI space) may be chosen in a variety of ways.   The  program
       can  handle  any  CI  space which can be formulated as a Restricted Active Space CI.  This includes CISD,
       CISDT, CISDTQ, etc., up to Full CI, as well as multireference CI's in which the references are chosen  as
       all  determinants in which up to n electrons are excited in some MO active space.  This includes CISD[T],
       CISD[TQ], and second-order CI (SOCI).

</pre><h4><b>INPUT</b> <b>FORMAT</b></h4><pre>
       The following command-line arguments are available:

       <u>-quiet</u> This gives the same result as <b>PRINT=0</b>.

       <u>-o</u> <u>fname</u>
              Gives the filename for the output file.  Defaults to output.dat.

       <u>-e</u>     This   option   causes  the  total  CI  energy  or  energies  to  be  written  to  a  file  called
              detci_energies.dat.

       <u>-c</u> <u>value</u>
              Gives a looser convergence on the CI vector, useful in DETCAS calculations.  The value is  a  real
              number,  not  an  integer as in <b>CONVERGENCE</b>.  The convergence used will be the looser of <b>value</b> and
              <b>CONVERGENCE</b>.

              Additional input for this program is read from the file The following keywords are valid:

       <b>CONVERGENCE</b> <b>=</b> <u>integer</u>
              Convergence desired on the CI vector.  Convergence is achieved when the RMS of the error in the CI
              vector is less than 10**(-n).  The default is 4 for energies and 7 for gradients. This is not  the
              same CI vector convergence criterion as found in GUGACI.

       <b>DOCC</b> <b>=</b> <u>integer_array</u>
              This vector gives the number of doubly occupied orbitals in each irrep.  There is no default.

       <b>SOCC</b> <b>=</b> <u>integer_array</u>
              This vector gives the number of singly occupied orbitals in each irrep.  There is no default.

       <b>DIAG_METHOD</b> <b>=</b> <u>string</u>
              This  specifies  which  method  is to be used in diagonalizing the Hamiltonian.  The valid options
              are: <b>RSP</b>, to form the entire H matrix and diagonalize using libciomr  to  obtain  all  eigenvalues
              (n.b.  requires HUGE memory); <b>OLSEN</b>, to use Olsen's preconditioned inverse subspace method (1990);
              <b>MITRUSHENKOV</b>, to use a 2x2 Olsen/Davidson method; and <b>DAVIDSON</b> (or <b>SEM</b>) to use Liu's  Simultaneous
              Expansion  Method,  which  is  identical  to  the Davidson method if only one root is to be found.
              There also exists a SEM debugging mode, <b>SEMTEST</b>.  The <b>SEM</b> method is the most robust, but  it  also
              requires  2(N*M)+1  CI  vectors  on disk, where N is the maximum number of iterations and M is the
              number of roots.

       <b>PRECONDITIONER</b> <b>=</b> <u>string</u>
              This specifies the type of preconditioner to use in  the  selected  diagonalization  method.   The
              valid  options  are:  <b>DAVIDSON</b> which approximates the Hamiltonian matrix by the diagonal elements;
              <b>H0BLOCK_INV</b>  which  uses  an  exact  Hamiltonian  of  H0_BLOCKSIZE  and  explicitly  inverts   it;
              <b>GEN_DAVIDSON</b>  which does a spectral decomposition of H0BLOCK; <b>ITER_INV</b> using an iterative approach
              to obtain  the  correction  vector  of  H0BLOCK.   The  H0BLOCK_INV,  GEN_DAVIDSON,  and  ITER_INV
              approaches  are  all  formally  equivalent  but  the  ITER_INV  is less computationally expensive.
              Default is <b>DAVIDSON</b>.

       <b>REFERENCE</b> <b>=</b> <u>string</u>
              This specifies the type of reference function.  This is RHF or  ROHF.   UHF  and  TWOCON  are  not
              supported.  For ROHF, a multiplicity of 1 implies an open-shell singlet.  The program will run for
              open-shell  singlets,  but  it  has  not  been  properly  adapted to use a correct two-determinant
              reference in this case, so running with open-shell singlet references is not  advised  except  for
              full CI's.

       <b>UPDATE</b> <b>=</b> <u>string</u>
              <b>DAVIDSON</b>  employs  the standard DAVIDSON update or correction vector formula, while <b>OLSEN</b> uses the
              OLSEN correction vector.  Default is <b>DAVIDSON</b>.

       <b>HD_OTF</b> <b>=</b> <u>boolean</u>
              If TRUE the diagonal elements of the Hamiltonian  matrix  are  computed  on-the-fly,  otherwise  a
              diagonal element vector is written to a separate file on disk.  Default is TRUE.

       <b>HD_AVE</b> <b>=</b> <u>string</u>
              <b>HD_EXACT</b>  uses  the  exact  diagonal  energies which results in expansion vectors which break spin
              symmetry. <b>HD_KAVE</b> averages the diagonal energies over  a  spin-coupling  set  yielding  spin  pure
              expansion  vectors.   <b>ORB_ENER</b>  employs  the  sum of orbital energy approximation giving spin pure
              expansion vectors but usually doubles the number of davidson iterations. <b>EVANGELISTI</b> uses the sums
              and differences of orbital energies with the SCF reference energy to produce spin  pure  expansion
              vectors.  <b>LEININGER</b>  approximation  which subtracts the one-electron contribution from the orbital
              energies, multiplies by 0.5, and adds the one-electron contribution back in, producing  spin  pure
              expansion vectors and developed by yours truly and works as well as <b>EVANGELISTI</b>.

       <b>NODFILE</b> <b>=</b> <u>boolean</u>
              Only possible if NUM_ROOTS = 1.  Uses the last vector space in the BVEC file to write scratch DVEC
              rather than using a separate DVEC file.

       <b>ENERGY_CONVERGENCE</b> <b>=</b> <u>integer</u>
              Convergence  desired  on  the  CI  energy.   The  default is 6 for single point energies and 8 for
              gradients or CASSCF.

       <b>EX_LVL</b> <b>=</b> <u>integer</u>
              Excitation level for excitations into virtual orbitals (default 2, i.e. CISD).

       <b>VAL_EX_LVL</b> <b>=</b> <u>integer</u>
              Excitation level for references in orbitals of RAS II.  Defaults to zero.

       <b>FCI</b> <b>=</b> <u>boolean</u>
              If this flag is set to <b>TRUE</b>, then the storage of strings is simplified  for  a  Full  CI  and  the
              calculation  requires less overhead.  However, the final results should be identical to those when
              <b>FCI</b> <b>=</b> <b>FALSE</b>.  May cause unpredictable results if <b>FCI</b> <b>=</b> <b>TRUE</b> but <b>EX_LVL</b> is not  consistent  with  a
              Full CI.

       <b>FROZEN_DOCC</b> <b>=</b> <u>integer_array</u>
              The number of lowest energy doubly occupied orbitals in each irreducible representation from which
              there  will  be  no  excitations.  The Cotton ordering of the irredicible representations is used.
              The default is the zero vector.

       <b>FROZEN_UOCC</b> <b>=</b> <u>integer_vector</u>
              The number of highest energy unoccupied orbitals in each  irreducible  representation  into  which
              there will be no excitations.  The default is the zero vector.

       <b>FREEZE_CORE</b> <b>=</b>  <u>boolean</u>
              This  option  determines  whether the frozen core orbitals are to be included implicitly (true) or
              explicitly (false).  In the former case, the energetic contributions from the frozen core orbitals
              are folded into the one-electron integrals and into the  "frozen  core  energy"  computed  by  the
              transformation program.   The default is true.

       <b>EXPORT_VECTOR</b> <b>=</b> <u>boolean</u>
              This  specifies whether to store converged vector(s) at the end of the run.  The vector(s) is(are)
              stored in a transparent format such that other programs can use it easily. The format is specified
              in <b>src/lib/libqt/slaterdset.h</b>.  The default is false.

       <b>NUM_EXPORT</b> <b>=</b> <u>integer</u>
              If <b>EXPORT_VECTOR</b> is set to true, the this determines  the  number  of  vectors  that  need  to  be
              exported at the end of the run. The default is 1.

       <b>GUESS_VECTOR</b> <b>=</b> <u>string</u>
              This  specifies which type of guess vector to use in the CI iteration.  Currently only used by the
              SEM iteration  method.   Accepted  values  are  <b>UNIT</b>  for  a  unit  vector  guess  (<b>NUM_ROOTS</b>  and
              <b>NUM_INIT_VECS</b> must both be 1); <b>H0_BLOCK</b> to use eigenvectors from the H0 BLOCK submatrix (default);
              <b>DFILE</b>  to  use  <b>NUM_ROOTS</b>  previously  converged  vectors  in  the  D file; and <b>MP2</b> to use the MP2
              wavefunction as a guess (not working at the moment).

       <b>H0_BLOCKSIZE</b> <b>=</b> <u>integer</u>
              This parameter specifies the size of the "H0" block of the Hamiltonian which  is  solved  exactly.
              The  n determinants with the lowest SCF energy are selected, and a submatrix of the Hamiltonian is
              formed using these determinants.  This submatrix is used  to  accelerate  convergence  of  the  CI
              iterations in the <b>OLSEN</b> and <b>MITRUSHENKOV</b> iteration schemes, and also to find a good starting guess
              for  the <b>SEM</b> method if <b>GUESS_VECTOR</b> <b>=</b> <b>H0_BLOCK</b>.  Defaults to 40.  Note that the program may change
              the given size for Ms=0 cases (<b>Ms0</b> <b>=</b> <b>TRUE</b>) if it determines that the H0 block  includes  only  one
              member  of  a pair of determinants related by time reversal symmetry.  For very small block sizes,
              this could conceivably eliminate the entire H0 block; the program should print  warnings  if  this
              occurs.

       <b>H0_BLOCK_COUPLING_SIZE</b> <b>=</b>  <u>integer</u>
              Parameters  which  specifies  the  size  of  the  coupling  block  within the generalized davidson
              preconditioner.  Default value is 1000.

       <b>MAX_DET</b> <b>=</b>  <u>integer</u>
              Sets the maximum number of determinants; if the CI space is larger than this, the program  aborts.
              This  option  exists  to  ensure that very large calculations are not run by accident.  During the
              current developmental phase, the default is 10000, but it will be raised before long.

       <b>MAXITER</b> <b>=</b> <u>integer</u>
              Maximum number of iterations to diagonalize the Hamiltonian.  Defaults to 12.

       <b>Ms0</b> <b>=</b> <u>boolean</u>
              If <b>TRUE</b>, use the Ms=0 component of the state.  Defaults to  <b>TRUE</b>  if  closed-shell  and  to  <b>FALSE</b>
              otherwise.  Related to the <b>S</b> parameter.

       <b>NPRINT</b> <b>=</b> <u>integer</u>
              This  value  specifies  the  number  of  determinants  which  will  be  printed,  along with their
              coefficients, in the list of most important determinants in the final CI vector.  The  default  is
              20.

       <b>NUM_ROOTS</b> <b>=</b> <u>integer</u>
              This  value  gives  the  number of roots which are to be obtained from the secular equations.  The
              default is one.  If more than one root is required, set <b>DIAG_METHOD</b> to <b>SEM</b>  (or,  for  very  small
              cases, <b>RSP</b> or <b>SEMTEST</b>).

       <b>NUM_INIT_VECS</b> <b>=</b> <u>integer</u>
              The  number  of  initial  vectors to use in the CI iterative procedure.  Defaults to the number of
              roots.

       <b>OPDM</b> <b>=</b> <u>boolean</u>
              If <b>TRUE</b> calculate the one-particle density matrix  and  make  <b>OPDM_WRITE</b>  default  to  <b>TRUE</b>.   The
              default value of <b>OPDM</b> is <b>FALSE</b>.

       <b>OPDM_FILE</b> <b>=</b> <u>integer</u>
              File  (unit number) for writing the one-particle density matrix if <b>OPDM_WRITE</b> <b>=</b> <b>TRUE</b>.  The default
              value is currently 73.

       <b>OPDM_WRITE</b> <b>=</b> <u>boolean</u>
              Flag for whether or not to write the one-particle density matrix to disk.

       <b>OPDM_PRINT</b> <b>=</b> <u>boolean</u>
              Flag for whether or not to print the one-particle density matrix.

       <b>OPDM_DIAG</b> <b>=</b> <u>boolean</u>
              Flag for whether or not to diagonalize the one-particle density matrix.

       <b>WRTNOS</b> <b>=</b> <u>boolean</u>
              Flag for whether or not to write the CI natural orbitals to PSIF_CHKPT.

       <b>ORBSFILE</b> <b>=</b> <u>integer</u>
              File (unit number) for writing various CI natural orbitals.  The default value is 76.

       <b>OPDM_AVE</b> <b>=</b> <u>boolean</u>
              Flag for whether or not to average the OPDM over several roots in order to obtain a  state-average
              one-particle  density  matrix.   This  density matrix can be diagonalized to obtain the CI natural
              orbitals.

       <b>ORBS_ROOT</b> <b>=</b> <u>integer</u>
              Flag for setting the root number for which CI natural orbitals are  written  to  PSIF_CHKPT.   The
              default value is 1 (lowest root).

       <b>PRINT</b> <b>=</b> <u>integer</u>
              This option determines the verbosity of the output.  A value of 1 or 2 specifies minimal printing,
              a  value  of  3  specifies verbose printing.  Values of 4 or 5 are used for debugging.  Do not use
              level 5 unless the test case is very small (e.g. STO H2O CISD).

       <b>ROOT</b> <b>=</b> <u>integer</u>
              The root to write out the two-particle density matrix for (the one-particle density  matrices  are
              written  for  all  roots).   Useful  for  a state-specific CASSCF or CI optimization on an excited
              state.

       <b>S</b> <b>=</b> <u>integer</u>
              The value of the spin quantum number S is given by this option.  The default is 0 (singlet).   The
              only  thing  this  is  actually  used for is determining the phase of the redundant half of the CI
              vector when the Ms=0 component is used (i.e., <b>Ms0</b> <b>=</b> <b>TRUE</b>).  For cases where S is not  an  integer,
              this parameter need not be entered because such a state can't have an Ms=0 component.

       <b>TPDM</b> <b>=</b> <u>boolean</u>
              If  <b>TRUE</b>  calculate  the  two-particle  density  matrix  and make <b>TPDM_WRITE</b> default to <b>TRUE</b>.  The
              default value of <b>TPDM</b> is <b>FALSE</b>.

       <b>TPDM_FILE</b> <b>=</b> <u>integer</u>
              File (unit number) for writing the two-particle density matrix if <b>TPDM_WRITE</b> <b>=</b> <b>TRUE</b>.  The  default
              value is currently 74.

       <b>TPDM_WRITE</b> <b>=</b> <u>boolean</u>
              Flag for whether or not to write the two-particle density matrix to disk.

       <b>TPDM_PRINT</b> <b>=</b> <u>boolean</u>
              Flag  for  whether  or  not  to  print the two-particle density matrix.  Typically a very bad idea
              except for debugging small cases.

       There is also some less commonly used input, which novice uses of PSI will have no need to use.

       <b>BENDAZZOLI</b> <b>=</b> <u>boolean</u>
              Use some routines to calculate sigma based on the papers of Bendazzoli et al.  Seems to be  slower
              and  not  worthwhile;  may disappear eventually.  Works only for full CI and I don't remember if I
              could see how their clever scheme might be extended to RAS in general.

       <b>CALC_SSQ</b> <b>=</b> <u>boolean</u>
              If TRUE, calculate the expectation value of the S^2 operator for the  final  CI  wavefunction  for
              each root.  In principle, DETCI should yield S^2 eigenfunctions.  The default is FALSE.

       <b>COLLAPSE_SIZE</b>  <u>integer</u>
              Gives  the  number  of  vectors  to  retain  when the Davidson subspace is collapsed (see <b>MAXNVECT</b>
              below).  If greater than one, the collapsed subspace retains the best estimate of  the  CI  vector
              for the previous n iterations.   Defaults to 1.

       <b>FIRST_TMP_UNIT</b> <b>=</b> <u>integer</u>
              Gives  the file (unit) number associated with the first scratch file used by DETCI.  Other scratch
              files are numbered consecutively from this point, int the order H(diag), C, S, D.  Each  of  these
              logical  files  takes  up  a  number  of  physical  files specified by the even more obscure input
              parameters <b>NUM_HD_TMP_UNITS,</b> <b>NUM_C_TMP_UNITS,</b> <b>NUM_S_TMP_UNITS,</b> <b>NUM_D_TMP_UNITS.</b>  The user can also
              specify different starting points for each of these sets using  the  parameters  <b>FIRST_HD_TMP_UNIT</b>
              and so forth.  Splitting a file across several units may help avoid the size-of-integer problem in
              addressing  large  files  that  is  present  in  DETCI and in PSI I/O libraries; but then again, I
              haven't tested it to see what happens.  The first unit of each section is printed  out  under  the
              heading FILES in the parameter output beginning the DETCI run.

       <b>FZC</b> <b>=</b> <u>boolean</u>
              Determines  whether  the  frozen  core orbitals are treated as truly frozen (i.e., absent entirely
              from calculation, <b>FZC</b> <b>=</b> <b>TRUE</b>) or whether they are present but restricted  to  be  doubly  occupied
              (<b>FZC</b>  <b>=</b> <b>FALSE</b>).  In the GUGA CI program, this is the distinction between what it calls FZC and COR
              orbitals.  Generally, the integrals for frozen core orbitals are not needed by DETCI but they  may
              be needed for MCSCF or gradients.

       <b>ICORE</b> <b>=</b> <u>integer</u>
              Specifies  how  to handle buffering of CI vectors.  A value of 0 makes the program perform I/O one
              RAS subblock at a time; 1 uses entire CI vectors at a time; and 2 uses one irrep block at a  time.
              Values of 0 or 2 cause some inefficiency in the I/O (requiring multiple reads of the C vector when
              constructing H in the iterative subspace if DIAG_METHOD = SEM), but require less core memory.

       <b>ISTOP</b> <b>=</b> <u>boolean</u>
              If  <b>TRUE</b>  then  DETCI  will stop after string information is formed and before integrals are read.
              May eventually change to an integer so that the user can select from multiple stopping points.

       <b>MAXNVECT</b> <b>=</b> <u>integer</u>
              Gives the maximum number of Davidson subspace vectors which  can  be  held  on  disk  for  the  CI
              coefficient  and sigma vectors.  (There is one H(diag) vector and the number of D vectors is equal
              to the number of roots).  When the number of vectors on disk reaches the value  of  <b>MAXNVECT</b>,  the
              Davidson  subspace will be collapsed to <b>COLLAPSE_SIZE</b> vectors for each root.  This is very helpful
              for saving disk space.  Defaults to <b>MAXITER</b> * <b>NUM_ROOTS</b> + <b>NUM_INIT_VECS</b>.

       <b>MIXED</b> <b>=</b> <u>boolean</u>
              This determines whether "mixed" RAS II/RAS III excitations are allowed into the CI space.  This is
              useful for placing additional constraints on a RAS CI.

       <b>MIXED4</b> <b>=</b> <u>boolean</u>
              This is similar to the MIXED keyword, but refers to excitations into RAS IV.

       <b>NUNITS</b> <b>=</b> <u>integer</u>
              Number of scratch files to be used in storing the C vectors (and also for the sigma vectors).

       <b>OEI_ERASE</b> <b>=</b> <u>boolean</u>
              This determines whether the program erases the one-electron integrals file after it has been read.
              The default will eventually be true, but during development the default is false.

       <b>OEI_FILE</b> <b>=</b> <u>integer</u>
              This keyword allows the user to specify the transformed one-electron integral file.   The  default
              is 71.

       <b>PRINT_CIBLKS</b> <b>=</b> <u>boolean</u>
              Specifies whether the program should print out a summary of all the blocks in the CI vector (which
              can be cast into matrix form, see refs.)

       <b>R4S</b> <b>=</b> <u>boolean</u>
              Restricts  the  RAS IV strings to the minimal set, saving memory.  If you are concerned about this
              option, you should write David for advice unless you are a DETCI expert.

       <b>REF_SYM</b> <b>=</b> <u>integer</u>
              This option allows the user to look for CI vectors of a different irrep than the reference.   This
              probably  only  makes  sense for Full CI, and it would probably not work with unit vector guesses.
              Numbering starts from zero for the totally-symmetric irrep.

       <b>REPL_OTF</b> <b>=</b> <u>boolean</u>
              Tells DETCI whether or not to do string replacements on the fly.  Can save a  gigantic  amount  of
              memory  (especially  for truncated CI's) but is somewhat flaky and hasn't been tested for a while.
              As I recall, it only works for certain classes of RAS calculations.  Contact David for assistance.
              Eventually, the on-the-fly replacement stuff should be redone in a much smarter  way  so  that  it
              doesn't  take  eons  of  CPU  time.   Work along these lines was once started and may be completed
              eventually.

       <b>RESTART</b> <b>=</b> <u>boolean</u>
              This option allows the user to resume a DETCI iteration that terminated prematurely.   It  assumes
              that  the  CI  and  sigma  vectors are on disk; the number of vectors specified by <b>RESTART_VECS</b> is
              collapsed down to one vector per root.

       <b>RESTART_VECS</b> <b>=</b> <u>integer</u>
              If <b>RESTART</b> <b>=</b> <b>TRUE</b> this specifies the  number  of  CI  (and  sigma)  vectors  to  read  from  disk.
              Typically  this  is  the number of successfully completed iterations from a previous run times the
              number of roots for that run.

       <b>TEI_ERASE</b> <b>=</b> <u>boolean</u>
              This determines whether the program erases the two-electron integrals file after it has been read.
              The default will eventually be true, but during development the default is false.

       <b>TEI_FILE</b> <b>=</b> <u>integer</u>
              This keyword allows the user to specify the transformed two-electron integral file.   The  default
              is 72.

       <b>MPN</b> <b>=</b> <u>boolean</u>
              When  this option is TRUE DETCI will compute the MPn series out to kth order where k is determined
              by maxnvect.  For open-shell systems (REF=ROHF, WFN = ZAPTN), DETCI will compute the ZAPTn series.
              GUESS_VECTOR must be set to TRUE.  HD_OTF must be set to TRUE.  HD_AVE must be set to orb_ener.

       <b>SAVE_MPN2</b> <b>=</b>  <u>integer</u>
              When MPN is TRUE and WIGNER is TRUE then this option becomes valid.  If set  to  1  then  MP(2n-1)
              energy  is  saved.  If  set  to  2 then MP(2n-2) energy is saved. If any other value MPn energy is
              saved.  The default is 0.
