</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       gb-transfer-service - Synchronise guerillabackup backup data storages

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>

       <b>gb-transfer-service</b> <b>--Config</b> <u>file</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This is the manual page for the <b>gb-transfer-service</b> command. For more details see packaged documentation
       at /usr/share/doc/guerillabackup. The service has two main purposes: providing a stream-based protocol
       for interaction with other gb-transfer-service instances and application of storage and retrieval
       policies for data synchronisation.

       The network part uses a local (AF_UNIX) socket to listen for incoming connections (see
       /run/guerillabackup/transfer.socket below). There is no authentication magic or likely-to-be-flawed
       custom-made crypto included in that part: any process allowed to open the socket can talk the protocol.
       For connectivity and authentication, use your favourite (trusted) tools. Good starting points are socat
       with OPENSSL X509 client/server certificate checks on one side and
       UNIX-CONNECT:/run/guerillabackup/transfer.socket for the other one. When using SSH to forward such
       connections, you should consider key-based authentication with command forcing (command="/usr/bin/socat -
       UNIX-CONNECT:/run/guerillabackup/transfer.socket") and default security options (restrict).

       The policies are the other domain of the gb-transfer-service. They define the authorisation rules
       granting access to backup data elements but do NOT grant access to the remote file system as such or
       allow creation or restore of backups. That is the domain of gb-backup-generator tool. The policy also
       defines, which backup elements should be copied or moved to other storages. Each gb-transfer-service may
       have two polices: one defining, what should be sent to other instances (sender policy) and what should be
       received (receiver policy). Without defining a policy for a transfer direction, no data will be sent in
       that direction. Currently there are two predefined policies:

       ReceiverStoreDataTransferPolicy: this policy attempts to create a copy of each file offered by a remote
       sender and keeps it, even after the sender stopped providing it. This policy is useful to fetch all files
       from a remote storage.

       SenderMoveDataTransferPolicy: this policy offers all backup files in the local storage for transfer.
       Depending on the settings, files are deleted after sending or just flagged as sent after successful
       transfer.

       A policy implements one of the policy interfaces, that are ReceiverTransferPolicy and
       SenderTransferPolicy. You may create a custom policy when the predefined do not match your requirements.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--Config</b> <u>file</u>
           This optional parameter specifies an alternative configuration file instead of
           /etc/guerillabackup/config.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       /etc/guerillabackup/config
           The main configuration file for all guerillabackup tools. Use /etc/guerillabackup/config.template to
           create it. The template also contains the documentation for each available parameter. The most
           relevant parameters for gb-transfer-service are TransferServiceStorageBaseDir,
           TransferReceiverPolicyClass, TransferReceiverPolicyInitArgs, TransferSenderPolicyClass,
           TransferSenderPolicyInitArgs.

       /run/guerillabackup/transfer.socket
           This is the default socket file name to connect two gb-transfer-service instances. The path can be
           changed by modification of "GeneralRuntimeDataDir" configuration property from default
           "/run/guerillabackup". By default, the socket is only accessible to privileged users and the user,
           who created it (mode 0600). You might change permissions after startup to grant access to other users
           also.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       For guerillabackup setups installed from packages, e.g. .deb or .rpm files usually installed via package
       management software, e.g. apt-get, aptitude, rpm, yast, please report bugs to the package maintainer.

       For setups from unpackaged software trunk, please report at
       <b>https://github.com/halfdog/guerillabackup/issues</b>.
