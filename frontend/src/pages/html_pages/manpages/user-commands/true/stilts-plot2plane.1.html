</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>plot2plane</u> draws plots on a Cartesian 2-dimensional surface.

       Positional  coordinates  are  specified  as <u>x</u>, <u>y</u> pairs, e.g.: plot2plane layer1=mark in1=cat.fits x1=RMAG
       y1=RMAG-BMAG

       Content is added to the plot by specifying one or more plot layers using the <u>layerN</u> parameter. The <u>N</u> part
       is a suffix applied to all the parameters affecting a  given  layer;  any  suffix  (including  the  empty
       string)  may  be  used.  Available  layers for this plot type are: <u>mark</u>, <u>size</u>, <u>sizexy</u>, <u>xyvector</u>, <u>xyerror</u>,
       <u>xyellipse</u>, <u>xycorr</u>, <u>link2</u>, <u>mark2</u>, <u>poly4</u>, <u>mark4</u>, <u>polygon</u>, <u>area</u>, <u>central</u>, <u>lines</u>,  <u>marks</u>,  <u>handles</u>,  <u>yerrors</u>,
       <u>xyerrors</u>,  <u>statline</u>,  <u>statmark</u>,  <u>arrayquantile</u>,  <u>line</u>,  <u>linearfit</u>, <u>label</u>, <u>arealabel</u>, <u>contour</u>, <u>grid</u>, <u>fill</u>,
       <u>quantile</u>, <u>histogram</u>, <u>kde</u>, <u>knn</u>, <u>densogram</u>, <u>gaussian</u>, <u>function</u>.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>xpix=</b><u>&lt;int-value&gt;</u>
              Size of the output image in the X direction in pixels. This includes space for  any  axis  labels,
              padding and other decoration outside the plot area itself. See also <u>insets</u>.

       <b>ypix=</b><u>&lt;int-value&gt;</u>
              Size  of  the  output image in the Y direction in pixels. This includes space for any axis labels,
              padding and other decoration outside the plot area itself. See also <u>insets</u>.

       <b>insets=</b><u>&lt;top&gt;,&lt;left&gt;,&lt;bottom&gt;,&lt;right&gt;</u>
              Defines the amount of space in pixels around the actual plotting area. This space is used for axis
              labels, and other decorations and any left over forms an empty border.

              The size and position of the actual plotting area is determined by this parameter along with  <u>xpix</u>
              and <u>ypix</u>.

              The  value  of this parameter is 4 comma separated integers: <u>&lt;top&gt;,&lt;left&gt;,&lt;bottom&gt;,&lt;right&gt;</u>. Any or
              all of these values may be left blank, in which case the corresponding margin will  be  calculated
              automatically according to how much space is required.

       <b>omode=</b><u>swing|out|cgi|discard|auto</u>
              Determines how the drawn plot will be output, see SUN/256.

                * <u>swing</u>:  Plot  will  be displayed in a window on the screen. This plot is "live"; it can be re‐
                  sized and (except for old-style plots) navigated around with mouse actions in the same way  as
                  plots in TOPCAT.

                * <u>out</u>: Plot will be written to a file given by <u>out</u> using the graphics format given by <u>ofmt</u>.

                * <u>cgi</u>:  Plot  will be written in a way suitable for CGI use direct from a web server. The output
                  is in the graphics format given by <u>ofmt</u>, preceded by a suitable "Content-type" declaration.

                * <u>discard</u>: Plot is drawn, but discarded. There is no output.

                * <u>auto</u>: Behaves as <u>swing</u> or <u>out</u> mode depending on presence of <u>out</u> parameter

       <b>storage=</b><u>simple|memory|disk|policy|cache|basic-cache|persistent|parallel</u>
              Determines the way that data is accessed when constructing the plot. There are two  main  options,
              cached  or not. If no caching is used then rows are read sequentially from the specified input ta‐
              ble(s) every time they are required. This generally requires a small  resource  footprint  (though
              that  can  depend  on  how  the  table  is specified) and makes sense if the data only needs to be
              scanned once or perhaps if the table is very large. If caching is used then the required  data  is
              read  once from the specified input table(s), then prepared and cached before any plotting is per‐
              formed, and plots are done using this cached data. This may use a significant  amount  of  storage
              for  large tables but it's usually more sensible (faster) if the data will need to be scanned mul‐
              tiple times. There are various options for cache storage.

              The options are:

                * <u>simple</u>: no caching, data read directly from input table

                * <u>memory</u>: cached to memory; OutOfMemoryError possible for very large plots

                * <u>disk</u>: cached to disk

                * <u>policy</u>: cached using application-wide default storage policy, which is usually adaptive (memo‐
                  ry/disk hybrid)

                * <u>persistent</u>: cached to persistent files on disk, in the system temporary directory (defined  by
                  system  property  <u>java.io.tmpdir</u>).  If this is used, plot data will be stored on disk in a way
                  that means they can be re-used between STILTS invocations, so data preparation can be  avoided
                  on subsequent runs. Note however it can leave potentially large files in your temporary direc‐
                  tory.

                * <u>cache</u>: synonym for <u>memory</u> (backward compatibility)

                * <u>basic-cache</u>: dumber version of <u>memory</u> (no optimisation for constant-valued columns)

                * <u>parallel</u>: experimental version of memory-based cache that reads into the cache in parallel for
                  large  files.  This  will make the plot faster to prepare, but interaction is a bit slower and
                  sequence-dependent attributes of the plot may not come out right. This experimental option may
                  be withdrawn or modified in future releases.

              The default value is <u>memory</u> if a live plot is being generated (<u>omode=swing</u>), since  in  that  case
              the  plot  needs to be redrawn every time the user performs plot navigation actions or resizes the
              window, or if animations are being produced. Otherwise (e.g. output to a graphics  file)  the  de‐
              fault is <u>simple</u>.

       <b>seq=</b><u>&lt;suffix&gt;[,...]</u>
              Contains a comma-separated list of layer suffixes to determine the order in which layers are drawn
              on the plot. This can affect which symbol are plotted on top of, and so potentially obscure, which
              other ones.

              When specifying a plot, multiple layers may be specified, each introduced by a parameter <u>layer&lt;N&gt;</u>,
              where  <u>&lt;N&gt;</u> is a different (arbitrary) suffix labelling the layer, and is appended to all the para‐
              meters specific to defining that layer.

              By default the layers are drawn on the plot in the order in which the <u>layer*</u> parameters appear  on
              the  command  line. However if this parameter is specified, each comma-separated element is inter‐
              preted as a layer suffix, giving the ordered list of layers to plot. Every  element  of  the  list
              must  be  a  suffix with a corresponding <u>layer</u> parameter, but missing or repeated elements are al‐
              lowed.

       <b>legend=</b><u>true|false</u>
              Whether to draw a legend or not. If no value is supplied, the decision is  made  automatically:  a
              legend is drawn only if it would have more than one entry.

       <b>legborder=</b><u>true|false</u>
              If true, a line border is drawn around the legend.

       <b>legopaque=</b><u>true|false</u>
              If  true,  the background of the legend is opaque, and the legend obscures any plot components be‐
              hind it. Otherwise, it's transparent.

       <b>legseq=</b><u>&lt;suffix&gt;[,...]</u>
              Determines which layers are represented in the legend (if present) and in which order they appear.
              The legend has a line for each layer label (as determined by the <u>leglabelN</u> parameter). If multiple
              layers have the same label, they will contribute to the same entry in the legend, with style icons
              plotted over each other. The value of this parameter is a comma-separated sequence of  layer  suf‐
              fixes, which determines the order in which the legend entries appear. Layers with suffixes missing
              from this list do not show up in the legend at all.

              If  no  value  is  supplied (the default), the sequence is the same as the layer plotting sequence
              (see <u>seq</u>).

       <b>legpos=</b><u>&lt;xfrac,yfrac&gt;</u>
              Determines the internal position of the legend on the plot. The value is a comma-separated pair of
              values giving the X and Y positions of the legend within the  plotting  bounds,  so  for  instance
              "<u>0.5,0.5</u>" will put the legend right in the middle of the plot. If no value is supplied, the legend
              will appear outside the plot boundary.

       <b>title=</b><u>&lt;value&gt;</u>
              Text  of  a  title to be displayed at the top of the plot. If null, the default, no title is shown
              and there's more space for the graphics.

       <b>auxmap=</b><u>&lt;map-name&gt;|&lt;color&gt;-&lt;color&gt;[-&lt;color&gt;...]</u>
              Color map used for Aux axis shading.

              A mixed bag of colour ramps are available as listed in SUN/256: <u>inferno</u>, <u>magma</u>,  <u>plasma</u>,  <u>viridis</u>,
              <u>cividis</u>,  <u>cubehelix</u>, <u>sron</u>, <u>rainbow</u>, <u>rainbow2</u>, <u>rainbow3</u>, <u>pastel</u>, <u>cosmic</u>, <u>ember</u>, <u>gothic</u>, <u>rainforest</u>,
              <u>voltage</u>, <u>bubblegum</u>, <u>gem</u>, <u>chroma</u>, <u>sunset</u>, <u>neon</u>, <u>tropical</u>, <u>accent</u>, <u>gnuplot</u>, <u>gnuplot2</u>, <u>specxby</u>, <u>set1</u>,
              <u>paired</u>, <u>hotcold</u>, <u>guppy</u>, <u>iceburn</u>, <u>redshift</u>, <u>pride</u>, <u>rdbu</u>, <u>piyg</u>, <u>brbg</u>, <u>cyan-magenta</u>,  <u>red-blue</u>,  <u>brg</u>,
              <u>heat</u>,  <u>cold</u>, <u>light</u>, <u>greyscale</u>, <u>colour</u>, <u>standard</u>, <u>bugn</u>, <u>bupu</u>, <u>orrd</u>, <u>pubu</u>, <u>purd</u>, <u>painbow</u>, <u>huecl</u>, <u>in‐</u>
              <u>finity</u>, <u>hue</u>, <u>intensity</u>, <u>rgb_red</u>, <u>rgb_green</u>, <u>rgb_blue</u>, <u>hsv_h</u>, <u>hsv_s</u>, <u>hsv_v</u>,  <u>yuv_y</u>,  <u>yuv_u</u>,  <u>yuv_v</u>,
              <u>scale_hsv_s</u>,  <u>scale_hsv_v</u>,  <u>scale_yuv_y</u>, <u>mask</u>, <u>blacker</u>, <u>whiter</u>, <u>transparency</u>. Note: many of these,
              including rainbow-like ones, are frowned upon by the visualisation community.

              You can also construct your own custom colour map by giving a sequence of colour  names  separated
              by  minus sign ("<u>-</u>") characters. In this case the ramp is a linear interpolation between each pair
              of colours named, using the same syntax as when specifying a colour value. So for  instance  "<u>yel‐</u>
              <u>low-hotpink-#0000ff</u>" would shade from yellow via hot pink to blue.

       <b>auxclip=</b><u>&lt;lo&gt;,&lt;hi&gt;</u>
              Defines  a  subrange  of  the  colour ramp to be used for Aux shading. The value is specified as a
              (low,high) comma-separated pair of two numbers between 0 and 1.

              If the full range <u>0,1</u> is used, the whole range of colours specified by the selected shader will be
              used. But if for instance a value of <u>0,0.5</u> is given, only those colours at the left  hand  end  of
              the ramp will be seen.

              If  the null (default) value is chosen, a default clip will be used. This generally covers most or
              all of the range 0-1 but for colour maps which fade to white, a small proportion of the lower  end
              may  be  excluded,  to ensure that all the colours are visually distinguishable from a white back‐
              ground. This default is usually a good idea if the colour map is being used with something like  a
              scatter  plot, where markers are plotted against a white background. However, for something like a
              density map when the whole plotting area is tiled with colours from the map, it may be  better  to
              supply the whole range <u>0,1</u> explicitly.

       <b>auxflip=</b><u>true|false</u>
              If true, the colour map on the Aux axis will be reversed.

       <b>auxquant=</b><u>&lt;number&gt;</u>
              Allows  the colour map used for the Aux axis to be quantised. If an integer value N is chosen then
              the colour map will be viewed as N discrete evenly-spaced levels, so that only N different colours
              will appear in the plot. This can be used to generate a contour-like effect, and may make it easi‐
              er to trace the boundaries of regions of interest by eye.

              If left blank, the colour map is nominally continuous (though in practice it may be quantised to a
              medium-sized number like 256).

       <b>auxfunc=</b><u>log|linear|histogram|histolog|sqrt|square|acos|cos</u>
              Defines the way that values in the Aux range are mapped to the selected colour ramp.

              The available options are:

                * <u>log</u>: Logarithmic scaling

                * <u>linear</u>: Linear scaling

                * <u>histogram</u>: Scaling follows data distribution, with linear axis

                * <u>histolog</u>: Scaling follows data distribution, with logarithmic axis

                * <u>sqrt</u>: Square root scaling

                * <u>square</u>: Square scaling

                * <u>acos</u>: Arccos Scaling

                * <u>cos</u>: Cos Scaling

              For all these options, the full range of data values is used, and displayed on the colour  bar  if
              applicable. The <u>Linear</u>, <u>Log</u>, <u>Square</u> and <u>Sqrt</u> options just apply the named function to the full da‐
              ta  range.  The histogram options on the other hand use a scaling function that corresponds to the
              actual distribution of the data, so that there are about the same number of points (or pixels,  or
              whatever  is  being scaled) of each colour. The histogram options are somewhat more expensive, but
              can be a good choice if you are exploring data whose distribution is unknown or  not  well-behaved
              over  its  min-max  range.  The <u>Histogram</u> and <u>HistoLog</u> options both assign the colours in the same
              way, but they display the colour ramp with linear or logarithmic annotation respectively; the <u>His‐</u>
              <u>toLog</u> option also ignores non-positive values.

       <b>auxmin=</b><u>&lt;number&gt;</u>
              Minimum value of the data coordinate on the Aux axis. This sets the value before any subranging is
              applied. If not supplied, the value is determined from the plotted data.

       <b>auxmax=</b><u>&lt;number&gt;</u>
              Maximum value of the data coordinate on the Aux axis. This sets the value before any subranging is
              applied. If not supplied, the value is determined from the plotted data.

       <b>auxlabel=</b><u>&lt;text&gt;</u>
              Sets the label used to annotate the aux axis, if it is visible.

       <b>auxcrowd=</b><u>&lt;factor&gt;</u>
              Determines how closely the tick marks are spaced on the Aux axis, if visible. The default value is
              1, meaning normal crowding. Larger values result in more ticks, and smaller  values  fewer  ticks.
              Tick  marks  will  not  however be spaced so closely that the labels overlap each other, so to get
              very closely spaced marks you may need to reduce the font size as well.

       <b>auxwidth=</b><u>&lt;pixels&gt;</u>
              Determines the lateral size of the aux colour ramp, if visible, in pixels.

       <b>auxvisible=</b><u>true|false</u>
              Determines whether the aux axis colour ramp is displayed alongside the plot.

              If not supplied (the default), the aux axis will be visible when aux shading is used in any of the
              plotted layers.

       <b>forcebitmap=</b><u>true|false</u>
              Affects whether rendering of the data contents of a plot (though not axis labels  etc)  is  always
              done  to  an  intermediate bitmap rather than, where possible, being painted using graphics primi‐
              tives. This is a rather arcane setting that may nevertheless have noticeable effects  on  the  ap‐
              pearance  and  size  of  an output graphics file, as well as plotting time. For some types of plot
              (e.g. <u>shadingN=auto</u> or <u>shadingN=density</u>) it will have no effect, since this kind of rendering hap‐
              pens in any case.

              When writing to vector graphics formats (PDF and PostScript), setting it true will force the  data
              contents to be bitmapped. This may make the output less beautiful (round markers will no longer be
              perfectly round), but it may result in a much smaller file if there are very many data points.

              When  writing to bitmapped output formats (PNG, GIF, JPEG, ...), it fixes shapes to be the same as
              seen on the screen rather than be rendered at the mercy of the graphics  system,  which  sometimes
              introduces small distortions.

       <b>compositor=</b><u>0..1</u>
              Defines  how  multiple  overplotted  partially transparent pixels are combined to form a resulting
              colour. The way this is used depends on the details of the specified plot.

              Currently, this parameter takes a "boost" value in the range 0..1. If the value is  zero,  satura‐
              tion  semantics are used: RGB colours are added in proporition to their associated alpha value un‐
              til the total alpha is saturated (reaches 1), after which additional pixels have  no  further  ef‐
              fect.  For  larger  boost  values,  the effect is similar, but any non-zero alpha in the output is
              boosted to the given minimum value. The effect of this is that even very slightly populated pixels
              can be visually distinguished from unpopulated ones which may not be the case for saturation  com‐
              position.

       <b>animate=</b><u>&lt;table&gt;</u>
              If  not null, this parameter causes the command to create a sequence of plots instead of just one.
              The parameter value is a table with one row for each frame to be produced. Columns  in  the  table
              are  interpreted  as parameters which may take different values for each frame; the column name is
              the parameter name, and the value for a given frame is its value from  that  row.  Animating  like
              this is considerably more efficient than invoking the STILTS command in a loop.

              The location of the animation control table. This may take one of the following forms:

                * A filename.

                * A URL.

                * The special value "<u>-</u>", meaning standard input. In this case the input format must be given ex‐
                  plicitly using the <u>afmt</u> parameter. Note that not all formats can be streamed in this way.

                * A scheme specification of the form <u>:&lt;scheme-name&gt;:&lt;scheme-args&gt;</u>.

                * A  system command line with either a "<u>&lt;</u>" character at the start, or a "<u>|</u>" character at the end
                  ("<u>&lt;syscmd</u>" or "<u>syscmd|</u>"). This executes the given pipeline and reads from its standard output.
                  This will probably only work on unix-like systems.
               In any case, compressed data in one of the supported compression formats (gzip, Unix compress  or
              bzip2) will be decompressed transparently.

       <b>afmt=</b><u>&lt;in-format&gt;</u>
              Specifies  the  format of the animation control table as specified by parameter <u>animate</u>. The known
              formats are listed in SUN/256. This flag can be used if you know what format your table is in.  If
              it  has  the special value <u>(auto)</u> (the default), then an attempt will be made to detect the format
              of the table automatically. This cannot always be done correctly however, in which case  the  pro‐
              gram  will  exit  with an error explaining which formats were attempted. This parameter is ignored
              for scheme-specified tables.

       <b>astream=</b><u>true|false</u>
              If set true, the animation control table specified by the <u>animate</u> parameter  will  be  read  as  a
              stream.  It is necessary to give the <u>afmt</u> parameter in this case. Depending on the required opera‐
              tions and processing mode, this may cause the read to fail (sometimes it is necessary to read  the
              table  more than once). It is not normally necessary to set this flag; in most cases the data will
              be streamed automatically if that is the best thing to do. However it can sometimes result in less
              resource usage when processing large files in certain formats (such as VOTable). This parameter is
              ignored for scheme-specified tables.

       <b>acmd=</b><u>&lt;cmds&gt;</u>
              Specifies processing to be performed on the animation control table as specified by parameter <u>ani‐</u>
              <u>mate</u>, before any other processing has taken place. The value of this parameter is one or  more  of
              the  filter  commands  described  in SUN/256. If more than one is given, they must be separated by
              semicolon characters (";"). This parameter can be repeated multiple times on the same command line
              to build up a list of processing steps. The sequence of commands given in  this  way  defines  the
              processing pipeline which is performed on the table.

              Commands  may  alternatively  be  supplied in an external file, by using the indirection character
              '<u>@</u>'. Thus a value of "<u>@filename</u>" causes the file <u>filename</u> to be read for a list of filter commands
              to execute. The commands in the file may be separated by newline characters and/or semicolons, and
              lines which are blank or which start with a '<u>#</u>' character are ignored. A backslash character '<u>\fR'</u>
              <u>at</u> <u>the</u> <u>end</u> <u>of</u> <u>a</u> <u>line</u> <u>joins</u> <u>it</u> <u>with</u> <u>the</u> <u>following</u> <u>line.</u>

       <b>parallel=</b><u>&lt;int-value&gt;</u>
              Determines how many threads will run in parallel if animation output is being produced. Only  used
              if  the  <u>animate</u>  parameter  is supplied. The default value is the number of processors apparently
              available to the JVM.

       <b>xlog=</b><u>true|false</u>
              If false (the default), the scale on the X axis is linear, if true it is logarithmic.

       <b>ylog=</b><u>true|false</u>
              If false (the default), the scale on the Y axis is linear, if true it is logarithmic.

       <b>xflip=</b><u>true|false</u>
              If true, the scale on the X axis will increase in the opposite sense from  usual  (e.g.  right  to
              left rather than left to right).

       <b>yflip=</b><u>true|false</u>
              If  true,  the  scale  on the Y axis will increase in the opposite sense from usual (e.g. right to
              left rather than left to right).

       <b>xlabel=</b><u>&lt;text&gt;</u>
              Gives a label to be used for annotating axis X A default value based on the plotted data  will  be
              used if no value is supplied.

       <b>ylabel=</b><u>&lt;text&gt;</u>
              Gives  a  label to be used for annotating axis Y A default value based on the plotted data will be
              used if no value is supplied.

       <b>x2func=</b><u>&lt;function-of-x&gt;</u>
              Defines a secondary X axis in terms of the primary one. If a secondary axis  is  defined  in  this
              way,  then  the axis opposite the primary one (i.e. on the top side of the plot) will be annotated
              with the appropriate tickmarks.

              The value of this parameter is an algebraic expression in terms of the variable <u>x</u> giving the value
              on the secondary X axis corresponding to a given value on the primary X axis.

              For instance, if the primary X axis represents flux  in  Jansky,  then  supplying  the  expression
              "<u>2.5*(23-log10(x))-48.6</u>"  (or  "<u>janskyToAb(x)</u>")  would  annotate the secondary X axis as AB magni‐
              tudes.

              The function supplied should be monotonic and reasonably well-behaved, otherwise the secondary ax‐
              is annotation may not work well. The application will attempt to make a  sensible  decision  about
              whether to use linear or logarithmic tick marks.

       <b>y2func=</b><u>&lt;function-of-y&gt;</u>
              Defines  a  secondary  Y  axis in terms of the primary one. If a secondary axis is defined in this
              way, then the axis opposite the primary one (i.e. on the right side of the plot) will be annotated
              with the appropriate tickmarks.

              The value of this parameter is an algebraic expression in terms of the variable <u>y</u> giving the value
              on the secondary Y axis corresponding to a given value on the primary Y axis.

              For instance, if the primary Y axis represents flux  in  Jansky,  then  supplying  the  expression
              "<u>2.5*(23-log10(y))-48.6</u>"  (or  "<u>janskyToAb(y)</u>")  would  annotate the secondary Y axis as AB magni‐
              tudes.

              The function supplied should be monotonic and reasonably well-behaved, otherwise the secondary ax‐
              is annotation may not work well. The application will attempt to make a  sensible  decision  about
              whether to use linear or logarithmic tick marks.

       <b>x2label=</b><u>&lt;text&gt;</u>
              Provides  a  string that will label the secondary X axis. This appears on the opposite side of the
              plot to the X axis itself.

       <b>y2label=</b><u>&lt;text&gt;</u>
              Provides a string that will label the secondary Y axis. This appears on the opposite side  of  the
              plot to the Y axis itself.

       <b>aspect=</b><u>&lt;number&gt;</u>
              Ratio  of  the  unit length on the X axis to the unit length on the Y axis. If set to 1, the space
              will be isotropic. If not set (the default) the ratio will be determined by the given or calculat‐
              ed data bounds on both axes and the shape of the plotting region.

       <b>grid=</b><u>true|false</u>
              If true, grid lines are drawn on the plot at positions determined by  the  major  tick  marks.  If
              false, they are absent.

       <b>xcrowd=</b><u>&lt;number&gt;</u>
              Determines  how  closely  the tick marks are spaced on the X axis. The default value is 1, meaning
              normal crowding. Larger values result in more ticks, and smaller values fewer  ticks.  Tick  marks
              will  not  however be spaced so closely that the labels overlap each other, so to get very closely
              spaced marks you may need to reduce the font size as well.

       <b>ycrowd=</b><u>&lt;number&gt;</u>
              Determines how closely the tick marks are spaced on the Y axis. The default value  is  1,  meaning
              normal  crowding.  Larger  values result in more ticks, and smaller values fewer ticks. Tick marks
              will not however be spaced so closely that the labels overlap each other, so to get  very  closely
              spaced marks you may need to reduce the font size as well.

       <b>labelangle=</b><u>horizontal|angled|adaptive</u>
              Controls  the orientation of numeric labels on the axes. In most cases labels are written horizon‐
              tally on both horizontal and vertical axes, but this option provides the possibility to write them
              at an angle which may be able to accommodate more labels on the horizontal axis, especially if the
              labels are long or a high crowding factor is requested.

              Note that the <u>adaptive</u> option is currently not perfect, and can sometimes lead to suboptimal  bor‐
              der placement.

              The available options are:

                * <u>horizontal</u>: axis labels are horizontal

                * <u>angled</u>: axis labels are angled

                * <u>adaptive</u>: axis labels are horizontal if possible, but angled if necessary to fit more in

       <b>minor=</b><u>true|false</u>
              If  true,  minor tick marks are painted along the axes as well as the major tick marks. Minor tick
              marks do not have associated grid lines.

       <b>shadow=</b><u>true|false</u>
              If true and no secondary axis is in use, then tick marks without numeric labels are painted  along
              the axis opposite to the primary axis, so that tick marks are visible along all edges not just the
              ones with numeric labels. If a secondary axis is in use, this setting is ignored.

       <b>gridcolor=</b><u>&lt;rrggbb&gt;|red|blue|...</u>
              The color of the plot grid, given by name or as a hexadecimal RGB value.

              The  standard  plotting colour names are <u>red</u>, <u>blue</u>, <u>green</u>, <u>grey</u>, <u>magenta</u>, <u>cyan</u>, <u>orange</u>, <u>pink</u>, <u>yel‐</u>
              <u>low</u>, <u>black</u>, <u>light_grey</u>, <u>white</u>. However, many other common colour names (too many to list here) are
              also understood. The list currently contains those colour names understood by most  web  browsers,
              from  <u>AliceBlue</u>  to  <u>YellowGreen</u>,  listed  e.g. in the Extended color keywords section of the CSS3
              standard.

              Alternatively, a six-digit hexadecimal number RRGGBB may be supplied, optionally prefixed  by  "<u>#</u>"
              or "<u>0x</u>", giving red, green and blue intensities, e.g. "<u>ff00ff</u>", "<u>#ff00ff</u>" or "<u>0xff00ff</u>" for magen‐
              ta.

       <b>gridtrans=</b><u>0..1</u>
              Transparency  of grid lines that may be drawn over the plot. The range is 0 (opaque) to 1 (invisi‐
              ble). This value is 1-alpha.

       <b>labelcolor=</b><u>&lt;rrggbb&gt;|red|blue|...</u>
              The color of axis labels and other plot annotations, given by name or as a hexadecimal RGB value.

              The standard plotting colour names are <u>red</u>, <u>blue</u>, <u>green</u>, <u>grey</u>, <u>magenta</u>, <u>cyan</u>, <u>orange</u>,  <u>pink</u>,  <u>yel‐</u>

              Alternatively,  a  six-digit hexadecimal number RRGGBB may be supplied, optionally prefixed by "<u>#</u>"
              or "<u>0x</u>", giving red, green and blue intensities, e.g. "<u>ff00ff</u>", "<u>#ff00ff</u>" or "<u>0xff00ff</u>" for magen‐
              ta.

       <b>texttype=</b><u>plain|antialias|latex</u>
              Determines how to turn label text into characters on the plot. <u>Plain</u> and <u>Antialias</u> both  take  the
              text  at  face  value,  but  <u>Antialias</u>  smooths the characters. <u>LaTeX</u> interprets the text as LaTeX
              source code and typesets it accordingly.

              When not using LaTeX, antialiased text usually looks nicer, but can be perceptibly slower to plot.
              At time of writing, on MacOS antialiased text seems to be required to stop the writing coming  out
              upside-down for non-horizontal text (MacOS java bug).

       <b>fontsize=</b><u>&lt;int-value&gt;</u>
              Size of the text font in points.

       <b>fontstyle=</b><u>standard|serif|mono</u>
              Font style for text.

              The available options are:

                * <u>standard</u>

                * <u>serif</u>

                * <u>mono</u>

       <b>fontweight=</b><u>plain|bold|italic|bold_italic</u>
              Font weight for text.

              The available options are:

                * <u>plain</u>

                * <u>bold</u>

                * <u>italic</u>

                * <u>bold_italic</u>

       <b>xmin=</b><u>&lt;number&gt;</u>
              Minimum  value  of the data coordinate on the X axis. This sets the value before any subranging is
              applied. If not supplied, the value is determined from the plotted data.

       <b>xmax=</b><u>&lt;number&gt;</u>
              Maximum value of the data coordinate on the X axis. This sets the value before any  subranging  is
              applied. If not supplied, the value is determined from the plotted data.

       <b>xsub=</b><u>&lt;lo&gt;,&lt;hi&gt;</u>
              Defines  a  normalised adjustment to the data range of the X axis. The value may be specified as a
              comma-separated pair of two numbers, giving the lower and upper bounds of the range of of interest
              respectively. This sub-range is applied to the data range that would otherwise be used, either au‐
              tomatically calculated or explicitly supplied; zero corresponds to the lower bound and one to  the
              upper.

              The  default  value "<u>0,1</u>" therefore has no effect. The range could be restricted to its lower half
              with the value <u>0,0.5</u>.

       <b>ymin=</b><u>&lt;number&gt;</u>
              Minimum value of the data coordinate on the Y axis. This sets the value before any  subranging  is
              applied. If not supplied, the value is determined from the plotted data.

       <b>ymax=</b><u>&lt;number&gt;</u>
              Maximum  value  of the data coordinate on the Y axis. This sets the value before any subranging is
              applied. If not supplied, the value is determined from the plotted data.

       <b>ysub=</b><u>&lt;lo&gt;,&lt;hi&gt;</u>
              Defines a normalised adjustment to the data range of the Y axis. The value may be specified  as  a
              comma-separated pair of two numbers, giving the lower and upper bounds of the range of of interest

              The default value "<u>0,1</u>" therefore has no effect. The range could be restricted to its  lower  half
              with the value <u>0,0.5</u>.

       <b>navaxes=</b><u>xy|x|y</u>
              Determines  the  axes which are affected by the interactive navigation actions (pan and zoom). The
              default is <u>xy</u>, which means that the various mouse gestures will provide  panning  and  zooming  in
              both  X and Y directions. However, if it is set to (for instance) <u>x</u> then the mouse will only allow
              panning and zooming in the horizontal direction, with the vertical extent fixed.

       <b>xanchor=</b><u>true|false</u>
              If true, then zoom actions will work in such a way that the zero point on the X axis stays in  the
              same position on the plot.

       <b>yanchor=</b><u>true|false</u>
              If  true, then zoom actions will work in such a way that the zero point on the Y axis stays in the
              same position on the plot.

       <b>zoomfactor=</b><u>&lt;number&gt;</u>
              Sets the amount by which the plot view zooms in or out for each unit of mouse  wheel  movement.  A
              value of 1 means that mouse wheel zooming has no effect. A higher value means that the mouse wheel
              zooms faster and a value nearer 1 means it zooms slower. Values below 1 are not permitted.

       <b>leglabelN=</b><u>&lt;text&gt;</u>
              Sets the presentation label for the layer with a given suffix. This is the text which is displayed
              in the legend, if present. Multiple layers may use the same label, in which case they will be com‐
              bined to form a single legend entry.

              If no value is supplied (the default), the suffix itself is used as the label.

       <b>layerN=</b><u>&lt;layer-type&gt;</u> <u>&lt;layerN-specific-params&gt;</u>
              Selects  one of the available plot types for layerN. A plot consists of a plotting surface, set up
              using the various unsuffixed parameters of the plotting command, and zero  or  more  plot  layers.
              Each  layer  is introduced by a parameter with the name <u>layer&lt;N&gt;</u> where the suffix "<u>&lt;N&gt;</u>" is a label
              identifying the layer and is appended to all the parameter names which configure that layer.  Suf‐
              fixes may be any string, including the empty string.

              This parameter may take one of the following values, described in more detail in SUN/256:

                * <u>xycorr</u>

                * <u>link2</u>

                * <u>mark2</u>

                * <u>poly4</u>

                * <u>mark4</u>

                * <u>polygon</u>

                * <u>area</u>

                * <u>central</u>

                * <u>lines</u>

                * <u>marks</u>

                * <u>handles</u>

                * <u>yerrors</u>

                * <u>xyerrors</u>

                * <u>statline</u>

                * <u>statmark</u>

                * <u>arrayquantile</u>

                * <u>line</u>

                * <u>linearfit</u>

                * <u>label</u>

                * <u>arealabel</u>

                * <u>contour</u>

                * <u>grid</u>

                * <u>fill</u>

                * <u>quantile</u>

                * <u>histogram</u>

                * <u>kde</u>

                * <u>knn</u>

                * <u>densogram</u>

                * <u>gaussian</u>

                * <u>function</u>

              Each  of  these layer types comes with a list of type-specific parameters to define the details of
              that layer, including some or all of the following groups:

                * input table parameters (e.g. <u>inN</u>, <u>icmdN</u>)

                * coordinate params referring to input table columns (e.g. <u>xN</u>, <u>yN</u>)

                * layer style parameters (e.g. <u>shadingN</u>, <u>colorN</u>)

              Every parameter notionally carries the same suffix <u>N</u>. However, if the suffix is not  present,  the
              application  will  try  looking for a parameter with the same name with no suffix instead. In this
              way, if several layers have the same value for a given parameter (for instance input  table),  you
              can  supply it using one unsuffixed parameter to save having to supply several parameters with the
              same value but different suffixes.
