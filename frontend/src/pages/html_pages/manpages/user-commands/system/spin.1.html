</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
        Spin − verification of multithreaded systems

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>spin</b> <b>-V</b>
       <b>spin</b> [ options ] <u>file</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       SPIN  is  a  tool for analyzing the logical consistency of asynchronous systems, specifically distributed
       software, multi-threaded systems, and communication protocols.  A model of the system is specified  in  a
       guarded command language called Promela (process meta language).  This modeling language supports dynamic
       creation  of  processes,  nondeterministic  case selection, loops, gotos, local and global variables.  It
       also allows for  a  concise  specification  of  logical  correctness  requirements,  including,  but  not
       restricted to requirements expressed in linear temporal logic.

       Given a Promela model stored in <u>file</u> <u>,</u> SPIN can perform interactive, guided, or random simulations of the
       system's  execution.   It  can  also generate a C program that performs an exhaustive verification of the
       correctness requirements for the system.  The main options supported are as follows. (You can always  get
       a full list of current options with the command "spin --".

       <b>-a</b>     Generate  a verifier (a model checker) for the specification.  The output is written into a set of
              C files named <b>pan.</b>[<b>cbhmt</b>], that can be compiled  (<b>cc</b>  <b>-o</b>  <b>pan</b>  <b>pan.c</b>)  to  produce  an  executable
              verifier.  The online SPIN manuals contain the details on compilation and use of the verifiers.

       <b>-b</b>     Do not execute printf statements in a simulation run.

       <b>-c</b>     Produce  an  ASCII approximation of a message sequence chart for a random or guided (when combined
              with <b>-t</b>) simulation run. See also option <b>-M</b>.

       <b>-Dxxx</b>  Pass <u>-Dxxx</u> to the preprocessor (see also <u>-E</u> and <u>-I</u>).

       <b>-d</b>     Produce symbol table information for the model specified in <u>file.</u>  For each  Promela  object  this
              information  includes the type, name and number of elements (if declared as an array), the initial
              value (if a data object) or size (if a message channel), the scope (global or local), and  whether
              the  object  is declared as a variable or as a parameter.  For message channels, the data types of
              the message fields are listed.  For structure variables, the 3rd field defines  the  name  of  the
              structure declaration that contains the variable.

       <b>-Exxx</b>  Pass <u>xxx</u> to the preprocessor (see also <u>-D</u> and <u>-I</u>).

       <b>-e</b>     If  the  specification  contains multiple never claims, or ltl properties, compute the synchronous
              product of all claims and write the result to the standard output.

       <b>-f</b> <u>LTL</u> Translate the LTL formula <u>LTL</u> into a never claim.
              This option reads a formula in LTL syntax from the second argument and translates it into  Promela
              syntax (a never claim, which is Promela's equivalent of a Büchi Automaton).  The LTL operators are
              written:  []  (always),  &lt;&gt; (eventually), and U (strong until).  There is no X (next) operator, to
              secure compatibility  with  the  partial  order  reduction  rules  that  are  applied  during  the
              verification  process.   If  the  formula  contains  spaces,  it should be quoted to form a single
              argument to the SPIN command.
              This option has largely been replaced with the support for inline specification of ltl formula, in
              Spin version 6.0.

       <b>-F</b> <u>file</u>
              Translate the LTL formula stored in <u>file</u> into a never claim.
              This behaves identical to option <b>-f</b> but will read the formula from the <u>file</u> instead  of  from  the
              command  line.  The file should contain the formula as the first line.  Any text that follows this
              first line is ignored, so it can be used to store comments or annotation on the formula.  (On some
              systems the quoting conventions of the shell complicate the use of option <b>-f</b> <b>.</b>  Option <b>-F</b> is meant
              to solve those problems.)

       <b>-g</b>     In combination with option <b>-p</b>, print all global variable updates in a simulation run.

       <b>-h</b>     At the end of a simulation run, print the value of the seed that was used for  the  random  number
              generator.  By specifying the same seed with the <b>-n</b> option, the exact run can be repeated later.

       <b>-I</b>     Show the result of inlining and preprocessing.

       <b>-i</b>     Perform  an  interactive  simulation,  prompting  the user at every execution step that requires a
              nondeterministic choice to be made.   The  simulation  proceeds  without  user  intervention  when
              execution is deterministic.

       <b>-j</b><u>N</u>    Skip printing for the first <u>N</u> steps in a simulation run.

       <b>-J</b>     Reverse  the  evaluation  order for nested unless statements, e.g., to match the way in which Java
              handles exceptions.

       <b>-k</b> <u>file</u>
              Use the file name <u>file</u> as the trail-file, see also <b>-t</b>.

       <b>-l</b>     In combination with option <b>-p</b>, include all local variable updates in the output  of  a  simulation
              run.

       <b>-M</b>     Produce  a  message  sequence  chart in tcl/tk form for a random simulation or a guided simulation
              (when combined with <u><b>-t</b></u>), for the model in <u>file</u> <u>,</u> and display  the  result  with  wish.   See  also
              option <b>-c</b>.

       <b>-m</b>     Changes  the  semantics of send events.  Ordinarily, a send action will be (blocked) if the target
              message buffer is full.  With this option a message sent to a full buffer is lost.

       <b>-n</b><u>N</u>    Set the seed for a random simulation to the integer value <u>N</u> <u>.</u>  There is no space  between  the  <u><b>-n</b></u>
              and  the  integer <u>N</u>.  ,TP <b>-N</b> <u>file</u> Use the never claim stored in <u>file</u> to generate the verified (see
              <b>-a</b>).

       <b>-O</b>     Use the original scope rules from pre-Spin version 6.

       <b>-o</b><u>[123]</u>
              Turn  off  data-flow  optimization  (<u>-o1</u>).   Do  not  hide  write-only  variables   (<u>-o2</u>)   during
              verification.   Turn  off  statement  merging  (<u>-o3</u>)  during  verification.   Turn  on  rendezvous
              optimization (<u>-o4</u>) during verification.  Turn on case caching (<u>-o5</u>) to reduce the size  of  pan.m,
              but losing accuracy in reachability reports.

       <b>-O</b>     Use  the scope rules pre-version 6.0. In this case there are only two possible levels of scope for
              all data declarations: global, or proctype local.  In version 6.0 and later there is a third level
              of scope: inlines or blocks.

       <b>-P</b><u>xxx</u>  Use the command <u>xxx</u> for preprocessing instead of the standard C preprocessor.

       <b>-p</b>     Include all statement executions in the output of simulation runs.

       <b>-q</b><u>N</u>    Suppress the output generated for channel <u>N</u> during simulation runs.

       <b>-r</b>     Show all message-receive events, giving the name and number  of  the  receiving  process  and  the
              corresponding  the  source line number.  For each message parameter, show the message type and the
              message channel number and name.

       <b>-replay</b>
              Replay an error trace found in an earlier verification (see -search).  As with -search,  arguments
              meant  for Spin itself (e.g., -p) can be given <u>before</u> the -replay argument. If the replay can only
              be done with the ./pan executable, then arguments for the replay with the ./pan executable can  be
              given <u>after</u> the -replay argument.

       <b>-search</b>
              Compile  and  run  directly.  Verificaiton  compile-time and runtime flags can be added <u>after</u> this
              parameter. Any Spin parse-time parameters must come <u>before</u>  the  -search  parameter.   The  actual
              command line executed is printed if -v is specified (before the -search argument).

       <b>-s</b>     Include all send operations in the output of simulation runs.

       <b>-T</b>     Do not automatically indent the printf output of process <u>i</u> with <u>i</u> tabs.

       <b>-t[</b><u>N</u>]  Perform  a  guided  simulation,  following  the  [<u>N</u>th] error trail that was produces by an earlier
              verification run, see the online manuals for the details on verification.  By  default  the  error
              trail is looked for in a file with the same basename as the model, and with extension .trail.  See
              also <b>-k</b>.

       <b>-v</b>     Verbose mode, add some more detail, and generate more hints and warnings about the model.

       <b>-V</b>     Print the SPIN version number and exit.

       <b>-x</b>     Generate transition tables from model and exit (generates, compiles, and runs pan.c).

       With  only  a filename as an argument and no option flags, SPIN performs a random simulation of the model
       specified in the file.  This normally does not generate output, except what is  generated  explicitly  by
       the  user within the model with <u>printf</u> statements, and some details about the final state that is reached
       after the simulation completes.  The group of options <b>-bgilmprstv</b> is used to set  the  desired  level  of
       information  that  the  user  wants about a random, guided, or interactive simulation run.  Every line of
       output normally contains a reference to the source line in  the  specification  that  generated  it.   If
       option <b>-i</b> is included, the simulation is <u>interactive</u>, or if option <b>-t</b> or <b>-k</b> <u>file</u> is added, the simulation
       is <u>guided</u>.

       <b>-b</b>     Suppress the execution of printf statements within the model.

       <b>-g</b>     Show at each time step the current value of global variables.

       <b>-l</b>     In combination with option <b>-p</b>, show the current value of local variables of the process.

       <b>-p</b>     Show at each simulation step which process changed state, and what source statement was executed.

       <b>-r</b>     Show  all  message-receive  events,  giving  the  name and number of the receiving process and the
              corresponding the source line number.  For each message parameter, show the message type  and  the
              message channel number and name.

       <b>-s</b>     Show all message-send events.

       <b>-v</b>     Verbose mode, add some more detail, and generat more hints and warnings about the model.
