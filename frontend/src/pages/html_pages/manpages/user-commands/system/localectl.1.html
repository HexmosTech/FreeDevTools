</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       localectl - Control the system locale and keyboard layout settings

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>

       <b>localectl</b> [OPTIONS...] {COMMAND}

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>localectl</b> may be used to query and change the system locale and keyboard layout settings. It communicates
       with <b><a href="../man8/systemd-localed.8.html">systemd-localed</a></b>(8) to modify files such as <a href="file:/etc/locale.conf">/etc/locale.conf</a> and /etc/vconsole.conf.

       The system locale controls the language settings of system services and of the UI before the user logs
       in, such as the display manager, as well as the default for users after login.

       The keyboard settings control the keyboard layout used on the text console and of the graphical UI before
       the user logs in, such as the display manager, as well as the default for users after login.

       Note that the changes performed using this tool might require the initrd to be rebuilt to take effect
       during early system boot. The initrd is not rebuilt automatically by localectl, this task has to be
       performed manually, usually by reinstalling the distribution's kernel package.

       Note that <b><a href="../man1/systemd-firstboot.1.html">systemd-firstboot</a></b>(1) may be used to initialize the system locale for mounted (but not booted)
       system images.

</pre><h4><b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       The following commands are understood:

       <b>status</b>
           Show current settings of the system locale and keyboard mapping. If no command is specified, this is
           the implied default.

           Added in version 195.

       <b>set-locale</b> <b>LOCALE</b>, <b>set-locale</b> <b>VARIABLE=LOCALE...</b>
           Set the system locale. This takes one locale such as "en_US.UTF-8", or takes one or more locale
           assignments such as "LANG=de_DE.utf8", "LC_MESSAGES=en_GB.utf8", and so on. If one locale without
           variable name is provided, then "LANG=" locale variable will be set. See <b><a href="../man7/locale.7.html">locale</a></b>(7) for details on the
           available settings and their meanings. Use <b>list-locales</b> for a list of available locales (see below).

           Added in version 195.

       <b>list-locales</b>
           List available locales useful for configuration with <b>set-locale</b>.

           Added in version 195.

       <b>set-keymap</b> <b>MAP</b> <b>[TOGGLEMAP]</b>
           Set the system keyboard mapping for the console and X11. This takes a mapping name (such as "de" or
           "us"), and possibly a second one to define a toggle keyboard mapping. Unless <b>--no-convert</b> is passed,
           the selected setting is also applied as the default system keyboard mapping of X11, after converting
           it to the closest matching X11 keyboard mapping. Use <b>list-keymaps</b> for a list of available keyboard
           mappings (see below).

           Added in version 195.

       <b>list-keymaps</b>
           List available keyboard mappings for the console, useful for configuration with <b>set-keymap</b>.

           Added in version 195.

       <b>set-x11-keymap</b> <b>LAYOUT</b> <b>[MODEL</b> <b>[VARIANT</b> <b>[OPTIONS]]]</b>
           Set the system default keyboard mapping for X11 and the virtual console. This takes a keyboard
           mapping name (such as "de" or "us"), and possibly a model, variant, and options, see <b><a href="../man4/kbd.4.html">kbd</a></b>(4) for
           details. Unless <b>--no-convert</b> is passed, the selected setting is also applied as the system console
           keyboard mapping, after converting it to the closest matching console keyboard mapping.

           Added in version 195.

       <b>list-x11-keymap-models</b>, <b>list-x11-keymap-layouts</b>, <b>list-x11-keymap-variants</b> <b>[LAYOUT]</b>,
       <b>list-x11-keymap-options</b>
           List available X11 keymap models, layouts, variants and options, useful for configuration with
           <b>set-keymap</b>. The command <b>list-x11-keymap-variants</b> optionally takes a layout parameter to limit the
           output to the variants suitable for the specific layout.

           Added in version 201.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The following options are understood:

       <b>-l</b>, <b>--full</b>
           Do not ellipsize the output.

           Added in version 257.

       <b>--no-convert</b>
           If <b>set-keymap</b> or <b>set-x11-keymap</b> is invoked and this option is passed, then the keymap will not be
           converted from the console to X11, or X11 to console, respectively.

           Added in version 195.

       <b>-H</b>, <b>--host=</b>
           Execute the operation remotely. Specify a hostname, or a username and hostname separated by "@", to
           connect to. The hostname may optionally be suffixed by a port ssh is listening on, separated by ":",
           and then a container name, separated by "/", which connects directly to a specific container on the
           specified host. This will use SSH to talk to the remote machine manager instance. Container names may
           be enumerated with <b>machinectl</b> <b>-H</b> <u>HOST</u>. Put IPv6 addresses in brackets.

       <b>-M</b>, <b>--machine=</b>
           Execute operation on a local container. Specify a container name to connect to, optionally prefixed
           by a user name to connect as and a separating "@" character. If the special string ".host" is used in
           place of the container name, a connection to the local system is made (which is useful to connect to
           a specific user's user bus: "--user --machine=lennart@.host"). If the "@" syntax is not used, the
           connection is made as root user. If the "@" syntax is used either the left hand side or the right
           hand side may be omitted (but not both) in which case the local user name and ".host" are implied.

       <b>--no-ask-password</b>
           Do not query the user for authentication for privileged operations.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
           Print a short help text and exit.

       <b>--version</b>
           Print a short version string and exit.

       <b>--no-pager</b>
           Do not pipe output into a pager.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       On success, 0 is returned, a non-zero failure code otherwise.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <u>$SYSTEMD_LOG_LEVEL</u>
           The maximum log level of emitted messages (messages with a higher log level, i.e. less important
           ones, will be suppressed). Takes a comma-separated list of values. A value may be either one of (in
           order of decreasing importance) <b>emerg</b>, <b>alert</b>, <b>crit</b>, <b>err</b>, <b>warning</b>, <b>notice</b>, <b>info</b>, <b>debug</b>, or an integer
           in the range 0...7. See <b><a href="../man3/syslog.3.html">syslog</a></b>(3) for more information. Each value may optionally be prefixed with
           one of <b>console</b>, <b>syslog</b>, <b>kmsg</b> or <b>journal</b> followed by a colon to set the maximum log level for that
           specific log target (e.g.  <b>SYSTEMD_LOG_LEVEL=debug,console:info</b> specifies to log at debug level
           except when logging to the console which should be at info level). Note that the global maximum log
           level takes priority over any per target maximum log levels.

       <u>$SYSTEMD_LOG_COLOR</u>
           A boolean. If true, messages written to the tty will be colored according to priority.

           This setting is only useful when messages are written directly to the terminal, because <b><a href="../man1/journalctl.1.html">journalctl</a></b>(1)
           and other tools that display logs will color messages based on the log level on their own.

       <u>$SYSTEMD_LOG_TIME</u>
           A boolean. If true, console log messages will be prefixed with a timestamp.

           This setting is only useful when messages are written directly to the terminal or a file, because
           <b><a href="../man1/journalctl.1.html">journalctl</a></b>(1) and other tools that display logs will attach timestamps based on the entry metadata on
           their own.

       <u>$SYSTEMD_LOG_LOCATION</u>
           A boolean. If true, messages will be prefixed with a filename and line number in the source code
           where the message originates.

           Note that the log location is often attached as metadata to journal entries anyway. Including it
           directly in the message text can nevertheless be convenient when debugging programs.

       <u>$SYSTEMD_LOG_TID</u>
           A boolean. If true, messages will be prefixed with the current numerical thread ID (TID).

           Note that the this information is attached as metadata to journal entries anyway. Including it
           directly in the message text can nevertheless be convenient when debugging programs.

       <u>$SYSTEMD_LOG_TARGET</u>
           The destination for log messages. One of <b>console</b> (log to the attached tty), <b>console-prefixed</b> (log to
           the attached tty but with prefixes encoding the log level and "facility", see <b><a href="../man3/syslog.3.html">syslog</a></b>(3), <b>kmsg</b> (log to
           the kernel circular log buffer), <b>journal</b> (log to the journal), <b>journal-or-kmsg</b> (log to the journal if
           available, and to kmsg otherwise), <b>auto</b> (determine the appropriate log target automatically, the
           default), <b>null</b> (disable log output).

       <u>$SYSTEMD_LOG_RATELIMIT_KMSG</u>
           Whether to ratelimit kmsg or not. Takes a boolean. Defaults to "true". If disabled, systemd will not
           ratelimit messages written to kmsg.

       <u>$SYSTEMD_PAGER</u>
           Pager to use when <b>--no-pager</b> is not given; overrides <u>$PAGER</u>. If neither <u>$SYSTEMD_PAGER</u> nor <u>$PAGER</u> are
           set, a set of well-known pager implementations are tried in turn, including <b><a href="../man1/less.1.html">less</a></b>(1) and <b><a href="../man1/more.1.html">more</a></b>(1),
           until one is found. If no pager implementation is discovered no pager is invoked. Setting this
           environment variable to an empty string or the value "cat" is equivalent to passing <b>--no-pager</b>.

           Note: if <u>$SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE</u> is not set, <u>$SYSTEMD_PAGER</u> (as well as <u>$PAGER</u>) will be silently
           ignored.

       <u>$SYSTEMD_LESS</u>
           Override the options passed to <b>less</b> (by default "FRSXMK").

           Users might want to change two options in particular:

           <b>K</b>
               This option instructs the pager to exit immediately when Ctrl+C is pressed. To allow <b>less</b> to
               handle Ctrl+C itself to switch back to the pager command prompt, unset this option.

               If the value of <u>$SYSTEMD_LESS</u> does not include "K", and the pager that is invoked is <b>less</b>, Ctrl+C
               will be ignored by the executable, and needs to be handled by the pager.

           <b>X</b>
               This option instructs the pager to not send termcap initialization and deinitialization strings
               to the terminal. It is set by default to allow command output to remain visible in the terminal
               even after the pager exits. Nevertheless, this prevents some pager functionality from working, in
               particular paged output cannot be scrolled with the mouse.

           Note that setting the regular <u>$LESS</u> environment variable has no effect for <b>less</b> invocations by
           systemd tools.

           See <b><a href="../man1/less.1.html">less</a></b>(1) for more discussion.

       <u>$SYSTEMD_LESSCHARSET</u>
           Override the charset passed to <b>less</b> (by default "utf-8", if the invoking terminal is determined to be
           UTF-8 compatible).

           Note that setting the regular <u>$LESSCHARSET</u> environment variable has no effect for <b>less</b> invocations by
           systemd tools.

       <u>$SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE</u>
           Takes a boolean argument. When true, the "secure" mode of the pager is enabled; if false, disabled.
           If <u>$SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE</u> is not set at all, secure mode is enabled if the effective UID is not the
           same as the owner of the login session, see <b><a href="../man2/geteuid.2.html">geteuid</a></b>(2) and <b><a href="../man3/sd_pid_get_owner_uid.3.html">sd_pid_get_owner_uid</a></b>(3). In secure mode,
           <b>LESSSECURE=1</b> will be set when invoking the pager, and the pager shall disable commands that open or
           create new files or start new subprocesses. When <u>$SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE</u> is not set at all, pagers which
           are not known to implement secure mode will not be used. (Currently only <b><a href="../man1/less.1.html">less</a></b>(1) implements secure
           mode.)

           Note: when commands are invoked with elevated privileges, for example under <b><a href="../man8/sudo.8.html">sudo</a></b>(8) or <b><a href="../man1/pkexec.1.html">pkexec</a></b>(1),
           care must be taken to ensure that unintended interactive features are not enabled. "Secure" mode for
           the pager may be enabled automatically as describe above. Setting <u>SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE=0</u> or not
           removing it from the inherited environment allows the user to invoke arbitrary commands. Note that if
           the <u>$SYSTEMD_PAGER</u> or <u>$PAGER</u> variables are to be honoured, <u>$SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE</u> must be set too. It
           might be reasonable to completely disable the pager using <b>--no-pager</b> instead.

       <u>$SYSTEMD_COLORS</u>
           Takes a boolean argument. When true, <b>systemd</b> and related utilities will use colors in their output,
           otherwise the output will be monochrome. Additionally, the variable can take one of the following
           special values: "16", "256" to restrict the use of colors to the base 16 or 256 ANSI colors,
           respectively. This can be specified to override the automatic decision based on <u>$TERM</u> and what the
           console is connected to.

       <u>$SYSTEMD_URLIFY</u>
           The value must be a boolean. Controls whether clickable links should be generated in the output for
           terminal emulators supporting this. This can be specified to override the decision that <b>systemd</b> makes
           based on <u>$TERM</u> and other conditions.
