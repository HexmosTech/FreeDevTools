</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       ipmi_ui - Crude interface to an IPMI system

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ipmiui</b> [<b>-dmsg</b>] [<b>-dmem</b>] [<b>-c</b>] <u>connection-1</u>[<u>connection-2</u>]

       The connections are specified as either:

       <b>smi</b> <u>smi-num</u>

       or

       <b>lan</b> <u>IP-addr</u> <u>port</u> [<u>IP-addr-2</u> <u>port-2</u>] <u>auth</u> <u>privilege</u> <u>username</u> <u>password</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>ipmi_ui</b>  program  connects  to  an  IPMI  system, and allows access to IPMI entities and sensors and
       OpenIPMI controls.  It's rather crude, and primarily for testing OpenIPMI, but it  has  some  use  beyond
       that so it is provided.

       Normally,  <b>ipmi_ui</b>  starts up in a full-screen format.  The left window shows the output of commands, the
       right window shows the logs from OpenIPMI.  Both windows are scrollable with page up and page down  keys,
       press  the  "<b>F1</b>"  key to choose the the left window to scroll, the "<b>F2</b>" key to choose the right window to
       scroll.

       Note that you must set your environment <b>TERM</b> variable properly for your terminal, or <b>ipmi_ui</b> will display
       garbage on the screen.

       Note that you can put two connection specifications on the  command  line,  and  ipmi_ui  will  make  two
       connection.   You  can  only  do  this  if  the connections are to the same IPMI domain through different
       management controllers.  Also, each LAN connection may have two IP addresses.  These  are  two  different
       addresses  to  the  same  management  controller.   So  you may have a total of 4 IP addresses to an IPMI
       domain, two management controllers and two IP adresses to each management controller.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-dmsg</b>  Turn on message debugging, this will dump all messages to the log window.

       <b>-dmem</b>  Turn on memory debugging, this will cause memory allocation and deallocations to be checked.  When
              the program terminates, it will dump all memory that was not properly freed (leaked).

       <b>-snmp</b>  Enable the SNMP trap handler.  <b>ipmi_ui</b> must be compiled with SNMP code enabled for this option  to
              be available.

       <b>-c</b>     Run  the program in command-line mode.  This is useful for scripting.  All output goes to standard
              output, there is no windowing.

       <u>smi-num</u>
              The SMI number to connect to, for systems with more than on system interface.  Generally, this  is
              '<b>0</b>'.

       <u>IP-addr</u>
              The IP address of the LAN interface.

       <u>port</u>   The UDP port of the LAN interface, general <b>623</b>.

       <u>IP-addr-2</u>
              Some  systems  support multiple IP connections, this specified the second address and is optional.
              If specified, OpenIPMI will use both IP addresses and fail over to the working one if one of  them
              fails.

       <u>port-2</u> The port for the second IP connection, generally <b>623</b>.

       <u>auth</u>   The authorization to use for the connection, either "<b>none</b>", "<b>straight</b>", "<b>md5</b>", or "<b>md2</b>".

       <u>privilege</u>
              The  privilege to use for the connection, either "<b>callback</b>", "<b>user</b>", "<b>operator</b>", or "<b>admin</b>".  Note
              that some IPMI operations will fail without the correct privilege.

       <u>username</u>
              The user name to use for the connection.  If using this anonymous user, this should be  the  empty
              string "".

       <u>password</u>
              The password to use for the connection.

</pre><h4><b>ENTITIES</b></h4><pre>
       Entities are listed by their entity id (the type of entity they are) and their entity instance.  Entities
       may  be  active  or  inactive  in  the  system, the standard IPMI algorithm for determining this is used.
       Commands on entities are:

       <b>entities</b>
              List all the entities in the system.  The output is the entity specifier, followed by an  optional
              entity name in parenthesis, followed by "present" or "not present".

       <b>check_presence</b>
              For the check of presence for all entities.

       <b>fru</b> <u>entity</u>
              List the FRU information associated with the entity.

       <b>dump_fru</b> <u>is_logical</u> <u>device_address</u> <u>device_id</u> <u>lun</u> <u>private_bus</u> <u>channel</u>
              Dump raw information from the specified FRU device.

</pre><h4><b>SENSORS</b></h4><pre>
       Sensors define input devices that OpenIPMI can monitor.

       <b>sensors</b> <u>entity</u>
              List  all  the  sensors  that  monitor  the given entity.  The output is the sensor specifier (the
              entity specifier followed by the sensor name, with spaces converted to ~). followed by the  sensor
              name.

       <b>sensor</b> <u>sensor</u>
              Pull up the given sensor and display all its information.  In full-screen mode, the sensor will be
              re-queried every second.

       <b>rearm</b> <u>global</u> [<u>assertion-mask</u> <u>deassertion-mask</u>]
              Rearm  the  given sensor.  If <u>global</u> is <b>1</b>, then the whole sensor is rearmed.  If <u>global</u> is <b>0</b>, then
              the <u>assertion-mask</u> and <u>deassertion-mask</u> must be specified telling which thresholds  or  states  to
              rearm.

       <b>events_enable</b> <u>events</u> <u>scanning</u> <u>assertion-bitmask</u> <u>deassertion-bitmask</u>
              Enable  or  disable events for the given sensor.  <u>events</u> turns events on or off from the sensor (<b>0</b>
              or <b>1</b>).  <u>scanning</u> turns scanning on or off for the sensor (<b>0</b> or  <b>1</b>).   <u>assertion-bitmask</u>  specifies
              the bitmask of thresholds or states that should be enabled or disabled when a thrshold or state is
              asserted.   It is a bunch of 0's and 1's, where the first one is for threshold/state 0, the second
              for threshold/state 1, etc.  <u>deassertion-bitmask</u> specifies the bitmask  of  thresholds  or  states
              that should be enabled or disabled when a thrshold or state is deasserted.

</pre><h4><b>CONTROLS</b></h4><pre>
       Controls are output devices that can control things like LEDs, power, reset lines and such.

       <b>controls</b> <u>entity</u>
              List  all  the  controls  that control the given entity.  The output is the control specifier (the
              entity specifier followed by the control name, with  spaces  converted  to  ~).  followed  by  the
              control name.

       <b>control</b> <u>control</u>
              Pull up the given control and display it's current state.

       <b>set_control</b> <u>val1</u> [<u>val2</u> ...]
              Change  the  value of a control.  Note that for controls with multiple values, <b>every</b> value must be
              specified.

</pre><h4><b>EVENTS</b></h4><pre>
       Events are asynchronous messages from sensors that tell the  user  that  a  sensor  has  done  something.
       Events  are generally stored in a system event log (SEL); OpenIPMI will fetch the events from the SELs in
       the system.

       Since multiple SELs may exist, an event is specified by the MC it  came  from  in  the  format  "(channel
       addr)" and a log number.  The same log number may exist in multiple MCs.

       Events  are  displayed  in the log window as they come in.  If they can be correlated with a sensor, they
       will be display with as much information as possible.

       <b>delevent</b> <u>channel</u> <u>mc-addr</u> <u>log-num</u>
              Delete the given event.  Note that many SELs do not support individual deletes, so this  may  only
              delete the local copy of the event, not the one in the SEL.  In this case, to delete events in the
              SEL, you must delete <b>all</b> the events in the SEL and wait about 10 seconds for OpenIPMI to do a full
              SEL clear.

       <b>clear_sel</b>
              Delete  all  events  in  the  SEL.   This  process  may take some time, so if you do this and quit
              immediately it may not be complete.

       <b>list_sel</b>
              List all events in the local copy of the SELs.  This is only the local copy, if the copies in  the
              actual have change, this won't be reflected.

       <b>get_sel_time</b> <u>channel</u> <u>mc-num</u>
              Get the time in the SEL for the given MC.

</pre><h4><b>MANAGMENT</b> <b>CONTROLLERS</b> <b>(MCs)</b></h4><pre>
       In  OpenIPMI,  you  normally don't deal with management controllers.  They are considered internal to the
       system.  However, for debugging, information about them is provided.

       <b>mcs</b>    List all the MCs in the system and whether they are active.   MCs  are  displayed  in  the  format
              "(channel address)".

       <b>mc</b> <u>channel</u> <u>mc-addr</u>
              Display a boatload of information about the MC, mostly coming from the get device id command.

       <b>mccmd</b> <u>channel</u> <u>mc-addr</u> <u>LUN</u> <u>NetFN</u> <u>Cmd</u> [<u>data</u> ...]
              Send an IPMI command to the given MC.  The MC must exist and be active to do this.

       <b>mc_reset</b> <u>channel</u> <u>mc-addr</u> [<b>warm</b> | <b>cold</b>]
              Send a warm or cold reset command to the given MC.  The action the MC takes is system-specific.

       <b>scan</b> <u>channel</u> <u>mc-addr</u>
              Scan  for an MC at the given address.  If the MC exists but OpenIPMI didn't know about it, it will
              be added.  If the MC no longer exists, then it will be removed.

       <b>mc_events_enable</b> <u>channel</u> <u>mc-num</u> <u>enabled</u>
              Enable or disable event generation for the given MC.

       <b>mc_events_enabled</b> <u>channel</u> <u>mc-num</u>
              Prints out if the events are enabled for the given MC.

</pre><h4><b>LAN</b> <b>Parameter</b> <b>Configuration</b></h4><pre>
       OpenIPMI has functions that make it easier to configure the LAN parameters of  a  LAN  connection.   Note
       that  the LAN parameters have a lock that OpenIPMI attempts to use.  If you read the LAN parameters, they
       will be locked until you either write them or clear the lock.

       <b>readlanparm</b> <u>channel</u> <u>mc-num</u> <u>channel</u>
              Read lanparm information from an MC and display it in the display window.

       <b>viewlanparm</b>
              Show current lanparm information in the display window.

       <b>writelanparm</b> <u>channel</u> <u>mc-num</u> <u>channel</u>
              Write the current LANPARM information to an MC.  Note that this must be the MC that the parameters
              were read from.

       <b>clearlanparmlock</b> [<u>channel</u> <u>mc-num</u> <u>channel</u>]
              Clear a LANPARM lock.  If the MC is given, then the LANPARM lock  is  directly  cleared.   If  not
              given, then the LANPARM lock for the current parms is cleared.

       <b>setlanparm</b> <u>config</u> [<u>selector</u>] <u>value</u>
              Set  the  given  config  item  to  the value.  The optional selector is used for items that take a
              selector, like "auth" or any of the items in "destination".

</pre><h4><b>Platform</b> <b>Event</b> <b>Filter</b> <b>(PEF)</b></h4><pre>
       OpenIPMI contains function to help manage the PEF settings on a BMC.  Note that the PEF parameters have a
       lock that OpenIPMI attempts to use.  If you read the PEF parameters, they will be locked until you either
       write them or clear the lock.

       <b>readpef</b> <u>channel</u> <u>mc-num</u>
              Read the PEF information from an MC.

       <b>clearpeflock</b> [<u>channel</u> <u>mc-num</u>]
              Clear a PEF lock.  If the MC is given, then the PEF lock on that MC is directly cleared.  If no MC
              is given, then the current PEF's lock is cleared.

       <b>viewpef</b>
              Show current pef information in the display window.

       <b>writepef</b> <u>channel</u> <u>mc-num</u>
              Write the current PEF information to an MC.

       <b>setpef</b> <u>config</u> [<u>selector</u>] <u>value</u>
              Set the given config item to the value.  The optional selector is  used  for  items  that  take  a
              selector, like anything in the event filters, alert policies, or alert strings.

       <b>pet</b> <u>connection</u> <u>channel</u> <u>ip-addr</u> <u>mac_addr</u> <u>eft-selector</u> <u>policy-num</u> <u>apt-selector</u> <u>lan-dest-selector</u>
              Set  up  the  connection  for  the domain to send PET traps from the given connection to the given
              IP/MAC address over the given channel.  This does all the LAN and PEF  configuration  required  to
              configure a system to send event traps.

</pre><h4><b>CONNECTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       OpenIPMI  can  maintain multiple connections to a single domain.  It will generally only use one of these
       at a time (although the other will constantly be under test).  This is the "active" connection.  You  can
       query and set which connection is active.

       The  connection  number  is the connection from the command line.  You can specify two connections on the
       command line (the part beginning  with  "<b>lan</b><u>",</u>  <u>"</u><b>smi</b><u>",</u>  <u>etc.).</u>   <u>The</u>  <u>first</u>  <u>connection</u>  <u>you</u>  <u>specify</u>  <u>is</u>
       <u>connection</u> <u>zero,</u> <u>the</u> <u>second</u> <u>is</u> <u>connection</u> <u>1.</u>

       <b>is_con_active</b> <u>connection</u>
              Print out if the given connection is active or not.

       <b>activate_con</b> <u>connection</u>
              Activate the given connection.

</pre><h4><b>OTHER</b> <b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>msg</b> <u>channel</u> <u>IPMB-addr</u> <u>LUN</u> <u>NetFN</u> <u>Cmd</u> [<u>data</u> ...]
              Send  an IPMI command to the given IPMB address.  This is available in case the given MC cannot be
              found or enabled.

       <b>sdrs</b> <u>channel</u> <u>mc-addr</u> <u>do-sensors</u>
              Dump all the sdrs from the given MC.  If <u>do-sensors</u> is <b>true</b>, then dump the device SDR.  If  it  is
              <b>false</b>, dump the main SDR repository on the MC.

       <b>scan</b> <u>channel</u> <u>IPMB-addr</u>
              Perform  an  IPMB  bus scan for the given IPMB, to try to detect an MC at the given address.  IPMB
              bus scanning can be slow, this can help speed things up if you already know the address.

       <b>quit</b>   Leave the program.

       <b>reconnect</b>
              Attempt to disconnect and reconnect to the IPMI controller.  This is primarily for testing.

       <b>display_win</b>
              Set the display window (left window) for scrolling, just in case the "<b>F1</b>" key doesn't work.

       <b>log_win</b>
              Set the log window (right window) for scrolling, just in case the "<b>F2</b>" key doesn't work.

       <b>help</b>   Dump some terse help output about all the commands.

</pre><h4><b>ERROR</b> <b>OUTPUT</b></h4><pre>
       All error output goes to the log window.
