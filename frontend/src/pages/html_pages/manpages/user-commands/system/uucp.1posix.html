</pre><h4><b>PROLOG</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       uucp — system-to-system copy

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       uucp <b>[</b>-cCdfjmr<b>]</b> <b>[</b>-n <u>user</u><b>]</b> <u>source-file</u>... <u>destination-file</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>uucp</u> utility shall copy files named by the <u>source-file</u> argument to the <u>destination-file</u> argument. The
       files named can be on local or remote systems.

       The  <u>uucp</u> utility cannot guarantee support for all character encodings in all circumstances. For example,
       transmission data may be restricted to 7 bits by the underlying network, 8-bit data  and  filenames  need
       not be portable to non-internationalized systems, and so on. Under these circumstances, it is recommended
       that only characters defined in the ISO/IEC 646:1991 standard International Reference Version (equivalent
       to  ASCII)  7-bit  range of characters be used, and that only characters defined in the portable filename
       character set be  used  for  naming  files.  The  protocol  for  transfer  of  files  is  unspecified  by
       POSIX.1‐2008.

       Typical  implementations  of  this  utility  require  a  communications  line  configured to use the Base
       Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <u>Chapter</u> <u>11</u>, <u>General</u>  <u>Terminal</u>  <u>Interface</u>,  but  other  communications
       means  may  be  used. On systems where there are no available communications means (either temporarily or
       permanently), this utility shall write an error message describing the problem and exit with  a  non-zero
       exit status.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>uucp</u>  utility  shall  conform  to the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <u>Section</u> <u>12.2</u>, <u>Utility</u>
       <u>Syntax</u> <u>Guidelines</u>.

       The following options shall be supported:

       <b>-c</b>        Do not copy local file to the spool directory for transfer to the remote machine (default).

       <b>-C</b>        Force the copy of local files to the spool directory for transfer.

       <b>-d</b>        Make all necessary directories for the file copy (default).

       <b>-f</b>        Do not make intermediate directories for the file copy.

       <b>-j</b>        Write the job identification string to standard output. This job identification can be used  by
                 <u>uustat</u> to obtain the status or terminate a job.

       <b>-m</b>        Send mail to the requester when the copy is completed.

       <b>-n</b> <u>user</u>   Notify <u>user</u> on the remote system that a file was sent.

       <b>-r</b>        Do not start the file transfer; just queue the job.

</pre><h4><b>OPERANDS</b></h4><pre>
       The following operands shall be supported:

       <u>destination-file</u>, <u>source-file</u>
                 A  pathname  of a file to be copied to, or from, respectively. Either name can be a pathname on
                 the local machine, or can have the form:

                     <u>system-name</u>!<u>pathname</u>

                 where <u>system-name</u> is taken from a list of system names that <u>uucp</u> knows about.  The  destination
                 <u>system-name</u> can also be a list of names such as:

                     <u>system-name</u>!<u>system-name</u>!...!<u>system-name</u>!<u>pathname</u>

                 in  which case, an attempt is made to send the file via the specified route to the destination.
                 Care should be taken to ensure that intermediate nodes in the  route  are  willing  to  forward
                 information.

                 The  shell  pattern  matching  notation  characters <b>'?'</b>, <b>'*'</b>, and <b>"[...]"</b> appearing in <u>pathname</u>
                 shall be expanded on the appropriate system.

                 Pathnames can be one of:

                  1. An absolute pathname.

                  2. A pathname preceded by ~<u>user</u> where <u>user</u> is a login name on  the  specified  system  and  is
                     replaced  by  that  user's login directory. Note that if an invalid login is specified, the
                     default is to the public directory  (called  <u>PUBDIR</u>;  the  actual  location  of  <u>PUBDIR</u>  is
                     implementation-defined).

                  3. A pathname preceded by ~/<u>destination</u> where <u>destination</u> is appended to <u>PUBDIR</u>.

                     <b>Note:</b>     This  destination  is  treated  as  a filename unless more than one file is being
                               transferred by this request or the destination is already a directory. To  ensure
                               that  it  is a directory, follow the destination with a <b>'/'</b>.  For example, <b><a href="file:~/dan/">~/dan/</a></b>
                               as the destination makes the directory <b>PUBDIR/dan</b> if it does not exist  and  puts
                               the requested files in that directory.

                  4. Anything else shall be prefixed by the current directory.

                 If  the  result  is  an  erroneous  pathname for the remote system, the copy shall fail. If the
                 <u>destination-file</u> is a directory, the last part of the <u>source-file</u> name shall be used.

                 The read, write, and execute permissions given by <u>uucp</u> are implementation-defined.

</pre><h4><b>STDIN</b></h4><pre>
       Not used.

</pre><h4><b>INPUT</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       The files to be copied are regular files.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of <u>uucp</u>:

       <u>LANG</u>      Provide a default value for the internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See the
                 Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <u>Section</u> <u>8.2</u>, <u>Internationalization</u>  <u>Variables</u>  for  the
                 precedence   of   internationalization  variables  used  to  determine  the  values  of  locale
                 categories.)

       <u>LC_ALL</u>    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values of all the  other  internationalization
                 variables.

       <u>LC_COLLATE</u>
                 Determine  the  locale  for  the  behavior  of ranges, equivalence classes, and multi-character
                 collating elements within bracketed filename patterns.

       <u>LC_CTYPE</u>  Determine the locale for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of text  data  as  characters
                 (for example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments and input files) and
                 the   behavior   of   character  classes  within  bracketed  filename  patterns  (for  example,
                 <b>"'[[:lower:]]*'"</b>).

       <u>LC_MESSAGES</u>
                 Determine the locale that should be used to  affect  the  format  and  contents  of  diagnostic
                 messages written to standard error, and informative messages written to standard output.

       <u>NLSPATH</u>   Determine the location of message catalogs for the processing of <u>LC_MESSAGES</u>.

</pre><h4><b>ASYNCHRONOUS</b> <b>EVENTS</b></h4><pre>
       Default.

</pre><h4><b>STDOUT</b></h4><pre>
       Not used.

</pre><h4><b>STDERR</b></h4><pre>
       The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.

</pre><h4><b>OUTPUT</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       The output files (which may be on other systems) are copies of the input files.

       If <b>-m</b> is used, mail files are modified.

</pre><h4><b>EXTENDED</b> <b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       The following exit values shall be returned:

        0    Successful completion.

       &gt;0    An error occurred.

</pre><h4><b>CONSEQUENCES</b> <b>OF</b> <b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       Default.

       <u>The</u> <u>following</u> <u>sections</u> <u>are</u> <u>informative.</u>

</pre><h4><b>APPLICATION</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       This utility is part of the UUCP Utilities option and need not be supported by all implementations.

       The domain of remotely accessible files can (and for obvious security reasons usually should) be severely
       restricted.

       Note  that  the  <b>'!'</b>   character  in  addresses has to be escaped when using <u>csh</u> as a command interpreter
       because of its history substitution syntax.  For <u>ksh</u> and <u>sh</u> the escape is not necessary, but may be used.

       As noted above, shell metacharacters appearing in pathnames are expanded on the appropriate system. On an
       internationalized system, this is done under the control of local settings of  <u>LC_COLLATE</u>  and  <u>LC_CTYPE</u>.
       Thus, care should be taken when using bracketed filename patterns, as collation and typing rules may vary
       from one system to another. Also be aware that certain types of expression (that is, equivalence classes,
       character classes, and collating symbols) need not be supported on non-internationalized systems.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>RATIONALE</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>FUTURE</b> <b>DIRECTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       None.
