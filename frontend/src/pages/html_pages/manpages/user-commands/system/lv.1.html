</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Multilingual</u> <u>file</u> <u>viewer</u>
              <u>lv</u>  is  a powerful multilingual file viewer.  Apparently, lv looks like <u>less</u> (1), a representative
              file viewer on UNIX as you know, so UNIX people (and <u>less</u> people on other OSs) don't have to learn
              a burdensome new interface.  lv can be used on MSDOS ANSI terminals and almost all UNIX platforms.
              lv is a currently growing software, so your feedback is welcome and helpful for us to  refine  the
              future lv.

       <u>Multiple</u> <u>coding</u> <u>systems</u>
              lv  can  decode and encode multilingual streams through many coding systems, for example, ISO 2022
              based  coding  systems  such  as  iso-2022-jp,  and  EUC  (Extended  Unix  Code)  like  euc-japan.
              Furthermore,  localized  coding systems such as shift-jis, big5 and HZ are also supported.  lv can
              be used not only as a file viewer but also as a coding-system translation filter like <u>nkf</u> (1)  and
              <u>tcs</u> (1).

       <u>Multilingual</u> <u>regular</u> <u>expressions</u> <u>/</u> <u>Multilingual</u> <u>grep</u>
              lv  can  recognize  multi-byte  patterns as regular expressions, and lv also provides multilingual
              <u>grep</u> (1) functionality by giving it another name, <u>lgrep</u>.  Pattern matching  is  conducted  in  the
              charset  level, so an EUC fragment, for example, can be found in the ISO 2022 tailored streams, of
              course.

       <u>Supporting</u> <u>the</u> <u>Unicode</u> <u>standard</u>
              lv provides Unicode facilities which enables you to handle Unicode streams  encoded  in  UTF-7  or
              UTF-8,  and  lv can also convert their code-points between Unicode and other charsets.  So you can
              display Unicode or foreign texts on your terminal, using the  code  conversion  function  to  your
              favorite charsets via Unicode.  (However, MSDOS version of lv has none of the Unicode facility.)

       <u>ANSI</u> <u>escape</u> <u>sequence</u> <u>through</u>
              lv  can  recognize  ANSI  escape  sequences  for  text decoration.  So you can look ANSI-decorated
              streams such as colored source codes generated by another software just  like  intended  image  on
              ANSI terminals.

       <u>Completely</u> <u>original</u>
              lv is a completely original software including no code drawn from <u>less</u> and <u>grep</u> and other programs
              at all.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       -A&lt;<u>coding-system</u>&gt;
              Set all coding systems to <u>coding-system</u>.

       -I&lt;<u>coding-system</u>&gt;
              Set input coding system to <u>coding-system</u>.

       -K&lt;<u>coding-system</u>&gt;
              Set  keyboard  coding  system  to  <u>coding-system</u>.   If it is not set, output coding system will be
              applied to it.

       -O&lt;<u>coding-system</u>&gt;
              Set output coding system to <u>coding-system</u>.

       -P&lt;<u>coding-system</u>&gt;
              Set pathname coding system to <u>coding-system</u>.

       -D&lt;<u>coding-system</u>&gt;
              Set default (fall-back) coding system to <u>coding-system</u>.

       coding-system:
              a: auto-select
              c: iso-2022-cn
              j: iso-2022-jp
              k: iso-2022-kr
              ec: euc-china
              ej: euc-japan
              ek: euc-korea
              et: euc-taiwan
              u7: UTF-7
              u8: UTF-8
              l1..9: iso-8859-1..9
              l0: iso-8859-10
              lb,ld,le,lf,lg: iso-8859-11,13,14,15,16
              s: shift-jis
              b: big5
              h: HZ
              r: raw mode

       Examples:
              -Il2: input coding system is iso-8859-2
              -Ks:  keyboard coding system is shift-jis
              -Oek: output coding system is euc-korea
              -Ab:  all coding systems are big5

       Coding-system translations / Code-points conversions:
              iso-2022-cn,  -jp,  -kr  can  be  converted  into  euc-china  or  -taiwan,  euc-japan,  euc-korea,
              respectively  (and  vice  versa).  shift-jis uses the same internal code-points as iso-2022-jp and
              euc-japan.

              Since big5 characters can be converted into CNS 11643-1992 with  negligible  incompleteness,  big5
              streams  can  be  translated  into  iso-2022-cn  or  euc-taiwan  (and vice versa) with code-points
              conversion.  Note that the iso-2022-cn referred here is not GB sequence, only just CNS  one.   You
              should remember that lv cannot translate big5 into GB directly.

              The  search  function  of  lv may not work correctly when lv additionally performs ``code-points''
              conversion (not ``coding-system''  translation),  because  visible  code  and  internal  code  are
              different  from  each other.  lv will try to avoid this problem with converting charsets of search
              patterns automatically, but this function is not always perfect.

       -W&lt;<u>number</u>&gt;
              Screen width

       -H&lt;<u>number</u>&gt;
              Screen height

       -E'&lt;<u>editor</u>&gt;' (default 'vi -c %d')
              Editor name (default 'vi -c %d')
              ``%d'' means the line number of current position in a file.

       -q     Assert there is delete/insert-lines control.
              Please set this option on a MSDOS ANSI terminal that has capability to delete and/or insert lines.
              As to termcap and terminfo version, it will be set automatically.

       -Ss&lt;<u>seq</u>&gt;
              Set ANSI Standout sequence to <u>seq</u>  (default "7")

       -Sr&lt;<u>seq</u>&gt;
              Set ANSI Reverse sequence to <u>seq</u>   (default "7")

       -Sb&lt;<u>seq</u>&gt;
              Set ANSI Blink sequence to <u>seq</u>     (default "5")

       -Su&lt;<u>seq</u>&gt;
              Set ANSI Underline sequence to <u>seq</u> (default "4")

       -Sh&lt;<u>seq</u>&gt;
              Set ANSI Highlight sequence to <u>seq</u> (default "1")

              These sequences are inserted between ``ESC ['' and ``m'' to construct full ANSI escape sequences.

       -T&lt;<u>number</u>&gt;
              Set Threshold-code which divides Unicode code-points in two regions. Characters belonging  to  the
              lower  region are assumed to have a width of one, and the higher characters are equated to a width
              of two. (Default: 12288, = 0x3000)

       -m     Force Unicode code-points which have the same glyphs as iso-8859-* to be Mapped to iso-8859-* in a
              conversion from Unicode to another character set which also has the corresponding code-points,  in
              particular, Asian charsets.

       -a     Adjust character set for search pattern (default)

       -c     Allow ANSI escape sequences for text decoration (Color)

       -d, -i Make regexp-searches ignore case (case folD search) (default)

       -f     Substitute Fixed strings for regular expressions

       -k     Convert X0201 Katakana to X0208 while decoding

       -l     Allow  physical  lines  of  each logical line printed on the screen to be concatenated for cut and
              paste after screen refresh

       -s     Force old pages to be swept out from the screen smoothly

       -u     Unify several character sets, eg. JIS X0208 and C6226.  In addition, lv equates ISO 646  variants,
              eg. JIS X0201-Roman, and unknown charsets with ASCII.

       -g     Turn on lgrep mode.

       -n     Prefix each line of output with the line number within its input file on lgrep.

       -v     Invert the sense of matching on lgrep.

       -z     Enable HZ auto-detection (also enabled by run-time C-t).

       -+     Clear all options
              You can also turn OFF specified options, using ``+&lt;option&gt;'' like +c, +d, ... +z.

       -      Treat the following arguments as filenames

       <u>grep-pattern</u>
              lv works like <u>grep</u> (1) when its name is <u>lgrep</u>

       +<u>number</u>
              Jump to the specified line immediately when lv is invoked.

       +/<u>grep-pattern</u>
              Search  the specified pattern immediately when lv is invoked.
