</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       wmmon - Window Maker dockapp for monitoring system information

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>wmmon</b> [ <u>OPTION</u> ]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>WMMon</b>  monitors  the  realtime  CPU  load  as  well  as  the average system load, and gives you some nice
       additional features too. It is intended for docking in Window Maker.

       It currently provides:

       •   a realtime CPU stress meter;

       •   an auto-scaled average system load meter, like <b>xload</b> and <b>wmavgload</b>;

       •   hint lines change color as the system load increases.

           •      green for multiples of 1

           •      yellow for multiples of 10

           •      red for multiples of 100

       •   a realtime disk I/O stress meter;

       •   auto-scaled disk I/O load meter;

       •   realtime memory and swap usage meters;

       •   a display for system uptime;

       •   three user-defined commands to launch.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-display</b> <u>display</u>
              This option specifies the X server to contact; see <u><a href="../man7x/X.7x.html">X</a>(7x)</u>.

       <b>-geometry</b> <u>geometry</u>
              This option specifies the preferred position of clock; see <u><a href="../man7x/X.7x.html">X</a>(7x)</u>.

       <b>-l</b>     Lock the mode, so that it cannot be cycled by clicking on the upper-left widget.  You can use this
              to open multiple copies of <b>WMMon</b>, each set to a different mode.

       <b>-i</b>     Start in disk I/O mode, which displays instantaneous disk usage and average disk load.

       <b>-b</b>     Include buffers and cache in memory usage calculations. The trend in recent years has been to  not
              include this in memory load monitors, but it can be useful information.

       <b>-s</b>     Start in system information mode, which displays memory usage, swap usage, and uptime.

       <b>-h</b>     Show help information.

       <b>-v</b>     Print the version number.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>WMMon</b> display can be cycled between CPU, disk I/O, and system information displays by clicking on the
       upper-left widget.  This displays CPU information by default.

       WMMon  can also be used to launch programs.  You may click either left, middle, or right mouse buttons in
       the average-load section of the window.  The pre-configured program will be  launched  according  to  the
       mouse button clicked.  (see <b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>FILE</b> below.)

       In order to move <b>WMMon</b>, drag on the outer edges.  These are not sensitive to mouse clicks.

</pre><h4><b>DOCKING</b> <b>IN</b> <b>WINDOW</b> <b>MANAGERS</b></h4><pre>
       Window Maker

              Window  Maker  users  should drag and drop the <b>WMMon</b> window on the Dock.  Then, right-click on the
              border of the window and select “Settings...”.  Check “Start when Window Maker is started”.

       AfterStep

              AfterStep users should put the following in their <u>$HOME/.steprc</u>

                       Wharf wmmon - MaxSwallow "wmmon" wmmon &amp;

       Other window managers

              <b>WMMon</b> runs nicely as a 64x64 shaped icon on your desktop.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>FILE</b></h4><pre>
       <b>WMMon</b> can launch three user-defined commands, triggered by left, middle and right  mouse  button  clicks.
       You can define the commands to launch in <u>$HOME/.wmmonrc</u>

              left: xterm
              middle: xload
              right: xcalc
       If  <b>WMMon</b>  detects  a  <u>$HOME/.wmmonrc</u>  file, it will launch the appropriate command when you click on the
       clock.

       The system administrator can define default commands in <u>/etc/wmmonrc</u>.  The administrator may also  choose
       to “fix” particular commands, making it impossible for users to change.  These commands can be defined in
       <u>/etc/wmmonrc.fixed</u>, although this isn't a nice thing to do.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <u>/etc/wmmonrc</u>
       <u>$HOME/.wmmonrc</u>
       <u>/etc/wmmonrc.fixed</u>

</pre><h4><b>AUTHORS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>WMMon</b> was written by Martijn Pieterse and Antoine Nulle.
