</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       erfs - a tool to create an encrypted file system on the cloud

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>erfs</b> <u>&lt;COMMAND&gt;</u> <u>[-options]</u> <u>&lt;SHARE-SECRET&gt;</u> <u>[&lt;mount-point&gt;]</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>erfs</b>  is  a simple unix utility which creates and mounts an encrypted remote file system. The file system
       is encrypted locally and the encrypted data is stored in the cloud.

       The cloud server has no knowledge of the content. A rogue server operator can not access  the  data.  All
       key material is created on the user's computer and never stored or transferred to the server.

       It  supports  collaboration  and the same filesystem can be accessed from different computers at the same
       time. The data is securely and seamlessly synchronized.

</pre><h4><b>COMMAND</b></h4><pre>
       <u>init</u>         Initialize (create) a new file system and print the SHARE-SECRET of the newly  created  file
                    system.

       <u>mount</u> <u>&lt;SHARE-SECRET&gt;</u>
                    Mount the encrypted remote file system.

       <u>umount</u> <u>&lt;SHARE-SECRET&gt;</u>
                    Unmount  the encrypted remote file system. SHARE-SECRET is optional and all filesystems will
                    be unmounted if no specific SHARE-SECRET is given.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>-x</u>           read the SHARE-SECRET from standard input.

</pre><h4><b>SECURITY</b></h4><pre>
       Passing the SHARE-SECRET as command line parameter is insecure. Use the -x option or set the  environment
       variable (example):

       $ SEC=aDe5F2ik3x35x7pfAEAWdC5Y ./erfs m

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONEMT</b></h4><pre>
       The following environment variable can be set to control the behavior.

       <u>SEC=&lt;SHARE</u> <u>SECRET&gt;</u> Specify the SHARE-SECRET to pass it (securely) to erfs.

</pre><h4><b>COPYRIGHT</b></h4><pre>
       ERFS  is  entirely  my  own  creation, although plenty of other code was used as examples. It is released
       under GPL.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       The latest version is available from https://github.com/hackerschoice/erfs/.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Efforts have been made to have erfs "do the right thing" in all its various modes.  If you  believe  that
       it  is  doing the wrong thing under whatever circumstances, please notify me and tell me how you think it
       should behave. I certainly encourage people to make custom mods and send in any improvements they make to
       it. Continued feedback from the Internet community is always welcome!

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Initialize a new encrypted and remote file system:
       $ erfs init

       Mount the new file system (replace aDe5F2ik3x35x7pfAEAWdC5Y  with  the  SHARE-SECRET  from  the  previous
       step):
       $ erfs mount aDe5F2ik3x35x7pfAEAWdC5Y

       or mount to a specific mount-point (<a href="file:~/secure-drive">~/secure-drive</a>):
       $ mkdir <a href="file:~/secure-drive">~/secure-drive</a>
       $ erfs mount aDe5F2ik3x35x7pfAEAWdC5Y <a href="file:~/secure-drive">~/secure-drive</a>

       Unmount the file system:
       $ erfs umount <a href="file:~/secure-drive">~/secure-drive</a>

       or unmount the file system by specifying the SHARE-SECRET:
       $ erfs umount aDe5F2ik3x35x7pfAEAWdC5Y

       or unmount all encrypted file systems:
       $ erfs umount
