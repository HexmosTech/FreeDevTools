</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       gprocmeter3,  procmeter3-gtk1,  procmeter3-gtk2  or  procmeter3-gtk3  - A user friendly system monitoring
       program.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>gprocmeter3|procmeter3-gtk1|procmeter3-gtk2|procmeter3-gtk3</b>    <u>[-h|--help]</u>     <u>[-w</u>     <u>&lt;hint1&gt;[,&lt;hint2&gt;]]</u>
       <u>[--rc=&lt;filename&gt;]</u> <u>[--...]</u>  <u>[...]</u>  <u>[GTK</u>  <u>program</u>  <u>options]</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>ProcMeter</u>  Displays  one  or  more  pieces of information about the operating system and other resources.
       Most of the information that is displayed comes from the <a href="file:/proc">/proc</a> filesystem.  The program  is  modular  and
       very configurable.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The command line options are described below.

       <b>-h</b>     Provides  a  help  message  listing  the  available outputs.  This will be different for different
              computers depending on the Linux kernel version that is being used and the hardware/software  that
              is configured.

       <b>-w</b>     Gives  Extended  Window  Manager hints (EWMH) to change the way that the Window Manager treats the
              ProcMeter3 window.  Implemented hints are: above, below, skip_pager, skip_taskbar, sticky.

              You can give more than one hint separated by commas (e. g. -w above,skip_taskbar,sticky),  or  use
              -w multiple times (e. g. -w above -w sticky).

       <b>--rc=&lt;filename&gt;</b>
              Load the specified <b>.procmeterrc</b> file in stead of the searching in the usual places.

       <b>--...</b>  A  list of configuration file options that will override the values in the <b>.procmeterrc</b> file.  The
              format of these options is (for example) <u>--resources.background=grey50</u> which is equivalent to  the
              entry in the .procmeterrc file of

               [resources]
               background = grey50

              All  spaces  around  the equal sign must be removed and if spaces are required in the value on the
              right hand side then quotes must be used around the entire command line option.

       <b>...</b>    A list of names of outputs that are to be displayed.  This can include any of the outputs that are
              available (see the -h option).  For the CPU usage is in a module named <b>Statistics</b> with  an  output
              named  <b>CPU</b>  and  there  are  graph (-g), text (-t) and bar (-b) options.  To display the CPU usage
              graph you would use the command line option <b>Statistics.CPU-g</b>

       <b>GTK</b> program <b>options</b>
              The standard set of GTK program options.  These include <b>--display</b> to set the display to use.

       <b>X</b> window <b>options</b>
              The only standard X Windows program option that is accepted is <b>-geometry</b> to set the  size  of  the
              window.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       When  started  the  program  will  display  all  of  the  requested information in a set of output panels
       (vertically aligned by default).  Each output can be either a graph, text or bar, and can  have  a  label
       indicating  what it represents.  The outputs that are displayed are those from the command line and those
       from the <b>.procmeterrc</b> configuration file.

       The left mouse button will produce a menu of options that are specific to the output  that  is  selected.
       The  <b>Properties</b>  option  on this menu will give more detailed information about the origin and meaning of
       the information that is displayed.  When the properties information  window  is  displayed,  clicking  on
       another  output will change the displayed information.  The <b>Move</b> <b>to</b> <b>Above</b> and <b>Move</b> <b>to</b> <b>Below</b> options allow
       the output to be moved around in the window.  Selecting one of these options will change the mouse cursor
       to a hand, use this to select another output.  The output that was selected first will be moved to  above
       or  below the output that was selected second.  The <b>Run</b> option on the menu (which may not be available on
       all outputs) will run the specified command.  This may be to display a list of  running  processes,  show
       the  amount  of  free  memory  or  disk  space  for  example.   This  menu  option is configurable in the
       <b>.procmeterrc</b> file.

       The right mouse button will produce a set of menus that list the modules that are available and for  each
       of  them  the available set of outputs.  There are three types of output, text and two graphical outputs,
       these are indicated in the sub-menus by icons.  Selecting one of the outputs from a sub-menu  will  cause
       that  output  to be displayed if it is not already visible.  If it is currently displayed then it will be
       disabled.  Those that are currently displayed are indicated by a marker to  the  left  in  the  sub-menu.
       When the output is added to the window it will be placed at the bottom, use the left mouse button to move
       it if required.

       The  middle mouse button will display the sub-menu that is associated with the module for the output that
       is selected.  This is one of sub-menus that are found with the right mouse button.
