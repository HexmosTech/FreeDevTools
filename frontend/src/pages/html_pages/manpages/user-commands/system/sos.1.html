</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       sos - A unified tool for collecting system logs and other debug information

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>sos</b> component [options]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>sos</b>  is a diagnostic data collection utility, used by system administrators, support representatives, and
       the like to assist in troubleshooting issues with a system or group of systems.

       The most well known function is  <b>sos</b> <b>report</b> or <b>sos</b> <b>report</b> as it was previously known.

       An sos archive is typically requested by support organizations  to  collect  baseline  configuration  and
       system data from which to begin the troubleshooting process.

</pre><h4><b>COMPONENTS</b></h4><pre>
       sos  supports  several  subcommands  or  components. Each provides a different set of information for the
       user. Supported components are as follows

       <b>report</b> Report generates an archive of  system  information  including  configuration  files  and  command
              output.  Information included in the report is based upon plugins that are activated automatically
              when certain criteria, such as installed packages, files,  services,  or  system  architecture  is
              detected.

              See <b>sos</b> <b>report</b> <b>--help</b> and <b>man</b> <b>sos-report</b> for more information.

              May also be invoked via the alias <b>rep</b> or the deprecated command <b>sos</b> <b>report</b>.

       <b>collect</b>
              Collect is used to capture reports on multiple systems simultaneously. These systems can either be
              defined  by  the user at the command line and/or defined by clustering software that exists either
              on the local system or on a "primary" system that is able to  inform  about  other  nodes  in  the
              cluster.

              When  running collect, sos report will be run on the remote nodes, and then the resulting archives
              will be copied from those nodes to the local system running sos collect. Archives are then removed
              from the remote systems.

              See <b>sos</b> <b>collect</b> <b>--help</b> and <b>man</b> <b>sos-collect</b> for more information.

              May also be invoked via the alias <b>sos</b> <b>collector</b> or the deprecated command <b>sos-collector</b>.

       <b>clean|cleaner|mask</b>
              This subcommand takes input of either 1) an sos report tarball, 2)  a  collection  of  sos  report
              tarballs  such  as  from  <b>collect</b>,  or 3) the unpackaged directory of an sos report and obfuscates
              potentially sensitive system information that is not covered by the standard postprocessing of <b>sos</b>
              <b>report</b>.

              Such data includes IP addresses, networks, MAC  addresses,  and  more.  Data  obfuscated  by  this
              command  will  remain  consistent  throughout  the  report and across reports provided in the same
              invocation. Additionally, care is taken to maintain network topology relationships between matched
              data items.

              See  <b>sos</b> <b>clean</b> <b>--help</b> and <b>man</b> <b>sos-clean</b> for more information.

              May be invoked via either <b>sos</b> <b>clean</b>, <b>sos</b> <b>cleaner</b>, <b>sos</b> <b>mask</b>,  or  via  the  <b>--clean</b>,  <b>--cleaner</b>  or
              <b>--mask</b> options for <b>report</b> and <b>collect</b>.

       <b>help</b>   This  subcommand  is  used  to  retrieve more detailed information on the various SoS commands and
              components than is directly available in either other manpages or --help output.

              See  <b>sos</b> <b>help</b> <b>--help</b> and  <b>man</b> <b>sos-help</b> for more information.

</pre><h4><b>GLOBAL</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       sos components provide their own set of options, however the following are available to be set across all
       components.

       <b>--batch</b> Do not prompt interactively, user will not be prompted for any data

       <b>--encrypt</b>
              Encrypt the resulting archive, and determine the method by which that encryption is done by either
              a user prompt or environment variables.

              When run with <b>--batch</b>, using this option will cause sos to look for either  the  <b>SOSENCRYPTKEY</b>  or
              <b>SOSENCRYPTPASS</b>  environment  variables.  If  set, this will implicitly enable the <b>--encrypt-key</b> or
              <b>--encrypt-pass</b> options, respectively, to the values set by the environment variable. This  enables
              the  use  of these options without directly setting those options in a config file or command line
              string. Note that use of an encryption key has precedence over a passphrase.

              Otherwise, using this option will cause sos to prompt the user to choose the method of  encryption
              to use. Choices will be [P]assphrase, [K]ey, [E]nv vars, or [N]o encryption.  If passphrase or key
              the  user  will  then  be prompted for the respective value, env vars will cause sos to source the
              information in the manner stated above, and choosing no encryption will disable encryption.

              See the sections on <b>--encrypt-key</b> and <b>--encrypt-pass</b> below for more information.

       <b>--encrypt-key</b> <b>KEY</b>
              Encrypts the resulting archive that sos report produces using GPG. KEY must be an existing key  in
              the  user's  keyring  as  GPG does not allow for keyfiles.  KEY can be any value accepted by gpg's
              'recipient' option.

              Note that the user running sos report must match the user owning the keyring from which keys  will
              be  obtained.  In  particular  this means that if sudo is used to run sos report, the keyring must
              also be set up using sudo (or direct shell access to the account).

              Users should be aware that encrypting the final archive will result in sos using double the amount
              of temporary disk space - the encrypted archive  must  be  written  as  a  separate,  rather  than
              replacement,  file  within  the  temp directory that sos writes the archive to. However, since the
              encrypted archive will be the same size as the original archive,  there  is  no  additional  space
              consumption once the temporary directory is removed at the end of execution.

              This means that only the encrypted archive is present on disk after sos finishes running.

              If encryption fails for any reason, the original unencrypted archive is preserved instead.

       <b>--encrypt-pass</b> <b>PASS</b>
              The same as --encrypt-key, but use the provided PASS for symmetric encryption rather than key-pair
              encryption.

       <b>--config-file</b> <b>CONFIG</b>
              Specify alternate configuration file.

       <b>-s,</b> <b>--sysroot</b> <b>SYSROOT</b>
              Specify an alternate root file system path.

       <b>--tmp-dir</b> <b>DIRECTORY</b>
              Specify alternate temporary directory to copy data during execution.

       <b>--threads</b> <b>THREADS</b>
              Specify the number of threads sos report will use for concurrency. Defaults to 4.

       <b>-v,</b> <b>--verbose</b>
              Increase  logging  verbosity.  May  be  specified  multiple  times  to enable additional debugging
              messages.

              The following table summarizes the effects of different verbosity levels:

                  1 (-v)   :  Enable debug messages for sos.log. Show individual plugins starting.
                  2 (-vv)  :  Also print debug messages to console.
                  3 (-vvv) :  Enable debug messages for archive file operations. Note this will dramatically
                              increase the amount of logging.

       <b>-q,</b> <b>--quiet</b>
              Only log fatal errors to stderr.

       <b>-z,</b> <b>--compression-type</b> <b>{auto|xz|gzip}</b>
              Compression type to use when compression the final archive output

       <b>--help</b> Display usage message.
