</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       PVM, pvm_intro - Parallel Virtual Machine System Version 3

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>PVM</u>  is  a  software system that enables a collection of heterogeneous computers to be used as a coherent
       and flexible concurrent computational resource.

       The  individual  computers  may  be  shared-  or  local-memory  multiprocessors,  vector  supercomputers,
       specialized  graphics  engines,  or  scalar  workstations,  that  may  be  interconnected by a variety of
       networks, such as ethernet, FDDI.

       User programs written  in  C,  C++  or  Fortran  access  PVM  through  library  routines  (<u>libpvm3.a</u>  and
       <u>libfpvm3.a</u>).

       Daemon programs (<u>pvmd3</u>) provide communication and process control between computers.

</pre><h4><b>MACHINE</b> <b>ARCHITECTURE</b></h4><pre>
       In  the  PVM  system, machines are assigned a short string to identify their architectures (this includes
       operating system type as well as CPU type).  The types currently predefined in the distribution are:

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       The following environment variables are read by PVM and may  be  set  in  order  to  customize  your  PVM
       environment.   To  set  them, you can add commands to your <u>.cshrc</u> or <u>.profile</u> or equivalent shell startup
       file.  See the manual page for the shell you normally use for information about how to do this.  You  can
       also  include  an  appropriate  shell  startup  file stub to set PVM environment variables and to add PVM
       directories  to  your   execution   path.    Inert   the   matching   stub   file,   pvm3/lib/cshrc.stub,
       pvm3/lib/kshrc.stub  or  pvm3/lib/bashrc.stub,  after  your declaration of PVM_ROOT in your shell startup
       file.

       For <u>csh</u> users: Note that setting them in <u>.login</u> does not have the same effect.  The .login script file is
       only read when you are actually logging in, whereas .cshrc is read every time csh starts up.   PVM  needs
       to  have  environment variables set when it starts a slave pvmd with "rsh host pvmd ...", so they must be
       set in .cshrc.

       For those using a shell that doesn't always read a startup script (e.g. <u>sh</u>, <u>ksh</u>), there is another way to
       set environment variables for PVM.  Before running the PVM executables, the <u>pvm</u> and <u>pvmd</u> startup  scripts
       source any commands in <u>$HOME/.pvmprofile</u> if this file exists.

       The following environment variables are supported by PVM 3.4.4:

       PVM_ROOT
              The  path  where  PVM  libraries and system programs are installed, for example /usr/local/pvm3 or
              $HOME/pvm3.  This variable must be set on each host  where  PVM  is  used  in  order  for  PVM  to
              function.  There is no default value.

       PVM_TMP
              The  path  for  PVM  temporary  files,  such as the daemon socket file pvmd.&lt;uid&gt; and the log file
              pvml.&lt;uid&gt;.  Use this environment variable to use a directory  other  than  <a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a>  (or  C:\TEMP  on
              Win32),  or to introduce added security by using a protected subdirectory in <a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a> that is owned by
              your userid and cannot be easily corrupted.

       PVM_RSH
              The  path  to  the  "rsh"  program  on  your  system,  if  different  than  that  defined  in  the
              $PVM_ROOT/conf/$PVM_ARCH.def  configuration  file.   This environment variable can also be used to
              replace "rsh" with "ssh" for added security.

       PVM_PATH
              The execution path to be searched for PVM programs on your  system.   By  default,  PVM  looks  in
              $HOME/pvm3/bin/$PVM_ARCH  and $PVM_ROOT/bin/$PVM_ARCH for your PVM applications.  This environment
              variable does <b>not</b> override the <u>ep=</u> host file option.

       PVM_WD The working directory for spawned PVM programs on your system.  By default, PVM  spawns  your  PVM
              applications  in  $HOME,  but for convenience in accessing data or input files using relative path
              names, an alternate working directory can  be  specified.   This  environment  variable  does  <b>not</b>
              override the <u>wd=</u> host file option.

       PVM_EXPORT
              Names of environment variables to export from a parent task to children tasks through <u>pvm_spawn()</u>.
              Multiple names must be separated by ':'.  If PVM_EXPORT is not set, no environment is exported.

       PVM_DEBUGGER
              The  debugger  script  to  use  when  <u>pvm_spawn()</u> is called with <u>PvmTaskDebug</u> set.  The default is
              $PVM_ROOT/lib/debugger.

       PVM_DPATH
              The path of the pvmd startup script (default is $PVM_ROOT/lib/pvmd).  It  is  overridden  by  host
              file option <u>dx=</u>.

              This  variable  is  useful  if you use a shell that doesn't automatically execute a startup script
              (such as .cshrc) to allow setting PVM_ROOT on slave (added) hosts.  If you set it to the  absolute
              or   relative   path   of  the  pvmd  startup  script  (for  example  /usr/local/pvm3/lib/pvmd  or
              pvm3/lib/pvmd), the script will automatically set PVM_ROOT.  Note that for this to work, you  must
              set it to run the pvmd script, not the pvmd3 executable itself.

       PVM_WINDPATH
              This  variable serves the same purpose as the PVM_DPATH above, but specifically for Win32 systems.
              This second environment variable allows for alternate specification of the path to  the  pvmd3.exe
              daemon  executable  using  appropriate  DOS  file  path  syntax  and  environment  variables (e.g.
              %PVM_ROOT%\lib\WIN32\pvmd3.exe).

       PVMHOSTFILE
              Specifies the path to an optional host file to  be  used  by  default  when  starting  PVM.   This
              alleviates  the  need  to  manually  pass a host file path argument to the "pvm" console or "pvmd"
              script when starting PVM.

       PVMDLOGMAX
              Sets the maximum length of the pvmd error log file.  Default value is the PVMDLOGMAX parameter  in
              the source, 1 Mbyte.

       PVMDDEBUG
              Sets  the  default  pvmd debugging mask (as does the pvmd -d option).  Value can be in hexadecimal
              (0x...), octal (0...) or decimal.  Used to debug the pvmd  (not  intended  to  be  used  to  debug
              application programs).

       PVMTASKDEBUG
              Sets  the  default  libpvm  debugging mask (as does pvm_setopt(PvmDebugMask, x)).  Value can be in
              hexadecimal (0x...), octal (0...) or decimal.  Used to debug libpvm (not intended to  be  used  to
              debug application programs).

       PVMTASK
              Sets  additional flag bits for the pvm_spawn() library call.  Allows override at run time of flags
              compiled into the pvm_spawn() calls in PVM application, e.g. to turn on PvmTaskDebug  for  popping
              up child tasks in a debugger window.

       PVMBUFSIZE
              Sets  the  size  of  the  shared memory buffers used by libpvm and the pvmd.  The default value is
              1048576.  If your program composes messages longer than this size, you must increase it.

       PVM_VMID
              A new feature in PVM 3.4.4 is the concept of a "Virtual Machine ID".  You can now set the PVM_VMID
              environment variable to an arbitrary string (or use the "id=" option in a host file, see man  page
              for  pvmd3),  and this will distinguish and allow multiple virtual machines to run on the same set
              of hosts under the same  userid.   (This  feature  was  originally  introduced  by  SGI  in  their
              commercial  PVM  product,  and  has now been generalized for the public PVM system.)  This feature
              seems to be something that people often want, and the PVM_VMID is the cleanest way to provide this
              functionality, rather than overloading the SHAREDTMP compiler flag and other internals.

              Setting the PVM_VMID environment variable before starting PVM will create an encapsulated  virtual
              machine  with  the  given  VMID name.  By default, all other hosts which are added to this virtual
              machine will inherit the same VMID.  If hosts are added to the virtual machine which  are  running
              older  versions  of PVM (prior to 3.4.4), then the VMID will be ignored for those hosts, and hence
              these machines can only be added to one virtual machine for the given user.  The VMID need not  be
              consistent  on  every  host in a virtual machine (although this is not necessarily advisable), and
              the VMID can be set for individual hosts using the "id="  host  file  option  (see  man  page  for
              pvmd3).

       The  following  environment  variables are used by PVM internally.  With the exception of PVM_ARCH, their
       values should not be modified.  This is for information only.

       PVM_ARCH
              The PVM architecture name of the host on which it is set, used  to  distinguish  between  machines
              with  different  executable  (a.out) formats.  Copies of a program for different architectures are
              installed in parallel directories named for PVM architectures.

       PVMSOCK
              Is passed from pvmd to spawned task, and gives the address of the pvmd local socket.

       PVMEPID
              Holds the expected process id of a spawned task exec'd by the pvmd.  This is a magic  cookie  used
              by  the  task  to  identify itself when reconnecting to the pvmd, in order to get the correct task
              slot.

       PVMTMASK
              The libpvm trace mask, passed from the pvmd to spawned tasks.

       PVMTRCBUF
              The libpvm trace buffer size.  If specified determines the number of bytes of trace event  message
              buffer to be collected before sending to front-end tracer program.

       PVMTRCOPT
              The  libpvm  trace option setting.  Determines the level of tracing to be performed on invocations
              of PVM library calls.

       PVMINPLACEDELAY
              Used to optimize sending of PvmDataInPlace messages on MPP systems.

       PVMKEY PVM uses this value, combined with the process id, to generate shared-memory  segment  keys.   The
              default value is your numeric uid.  PVM automatically detects collisions when generating a key and
              picks a new key, so it should almost never need to be set explicitly.
