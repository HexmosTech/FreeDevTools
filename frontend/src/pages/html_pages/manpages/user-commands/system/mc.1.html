              Display configure options.

       <u>-d,</u> <u>--nomouse</u>
              Disable mouse support.

       <u>-e</u> <u>[file],</u> <u>--edit[=file]</u>
              Start the internal editor.  If the file is specified, open it on startup.  See also <b>mcedit</b> <b>(1)</b>.

       <u>-f,</u> <u>--datadir</u>
              Display the compiled-in search paths for Midnight Commander files.

       <u>-F,</u> <u>--datadir-info</u>
              Display extended info about compiled-in paths for Midnight Commander.

       <u>-g,</u> <u>--oldmouse</u>
              Force a "normal tracking" mouse mode. Used when running on xterm-capable terminals (tmux/screen).

       <u>-k,</u> <u>--resetsoft</u>
              Reset softkeys to their default from the termcap/terminfo database. Only useful  on  HP  terminals
              when the function keys don't work.

       <u>-K</u> <u>file,</u> <u>--keymap=file</u>
              Specify a name of keymap file in the command line.

       <u>-l</u> <u>file,</u> <u>--ftplog=file</u>
              Save the ftpfs dialog with the server in file.

       <u>--nokeymap</u>
              Don't load key bindings from any file, use default hardcoded keys.

       <u>-P</u> <u>file,</u> <u>--printwd=file</u>
              Print  the  last  working  directory  to  the specified file.  This option is not meant to be used
              directly.  Instead, it's used from a special shell script that automatically changes  the  current
              directory  of  the  shell  to  the  last  directory  Midnight  Commander  was  in. Source the file
              <b>/usr/lib/mc/mc.sh</b> (bash and zsh users) or <b>/usr/lib/mc.csh</b> (tcsh users) respectively to  define  <b>mc</b>
              as an alias to the appropriate shell script.

       <u>-s,</u> <u>--slow</u>
              Turn  on  the  slow  terminal  mode, in this mode the program will not draw expensive line drawing
              characters and will toggle verbose mode off.

       <u>-S</u> <u>arg,</u> <u>--skin=arg</u>
              Specify a name of skin in the command line.  Technology  of  skins  is  documented  in  the  Skins
              section.

       <u>-t,</u> <u>--termcap</u>
              Used  only  if the code was compiled with S-Lang and terminfo: it makes Midnight Commander use the
              value of the <b>TERMCAP</b> variable for the terminal information  instead  of  the  information  on  the
              system wide terminal database

       <u>-u,</u> <u>--nosubshell</u>
              Disable  use  of  the concurrent shell (only makes sense if Midnight Commander has been built with
              concurrent shell support).

       <u>-U,</u> <u>--subshell</u>
              Enable use of the concurrent shell support (only makes sense if the Midnight Commander  was  built
              with the subshell support set as an optional feature).

       <u>-v</u> <u>file,</u> <u>--view=file</u>
              Start the internal viewer to view the specified file.  See also <b>mcview</b> <b>(1)</b>.

       <u>-V,</u> <u>--version</u>
              Display the version of the program.

       <u>-x,</u> <u>--xterm</u>
              Force  xterm  mode.   Used  when running on xterm-capable terminals (two screen modes, and able to
              send mouse escape sequences).

       <u>-X,</u> <u>--no-x11</u>
              Do not use X11 to get the state of modifiers Alt, Ctrl, Shift

       If both paths are specified, the first path name is the directory to show in the active panel; the second
       path name is the directory to be shown in the other panel.

       If one path is specified, the path name  is  the  directory  to  show  in  the  active  panel;  value  of
       "other_dir" from panels.ini is the directory to be shown in the passive panel.

       If  no  paths  are  specified,  current directory is shown in the active panel; value of "other_dir" from
       panels.ini is the directory to be shown in the passive panel.

</pre><h4><b>Overview</b></h4><pre>
       The screen of Midnight Commander is divided into four parts.  Almost all of the screen space is taken  up
       by  two directory panels.  By default, the second line from the bottom of the screen is the shell command
       line, and the bottom line shows the function key labels.  The topmost line is the  menu  bar  line.   The
       menu  bar  line may not be visible, but appears if you click the topmost line with the mouse or press the
       F9 key.

       Midnight Commander provides a view of two directories at the same time. One of the panels is the  current
       panel  (a  selection bar is in the current panel). Almost all operations take place on the current panel.
       Some file operations like Rename and Copy by default use the directory  of  the  unselected  panel  as  a
       destination  (don't  worry,  they  always  ask you for confirmation first). For more information, see the
       sections on the Directory Panels, the Left and Right Menus and the File Menu.

       You can execute system commands from Midnight Commander by simply typing them. Everything you  type  will
       appear  on  the shell command line, and when you press Enter, Midnight Commander will execute the command
       line you typed; read the Shell Command Line and Input Line Keys sections to learn more about the  command
       line.

</pre><h4><b>Mouse</b> <b>Support</b></h4><pre>
       Midnight  Commander  comes  with  mouse  support. It is activated whenever you are running on an <b><a href="../man1/xterm.1.html">xterm</a>(1)</b>
       terminal (it even works if you take a telnet, ssh or rlogin connection to another machine from the xterm)
       or if you are running on a Linux console and have the <b>gpm</b> mouse server running.

       When you left click on a file in the directory panels, that file is selected; if you click with the right
       button, the file is marked (or unmarked, depending on the previous state).

       Double-clicking on a file will try to execute the command if it is an  executable  program;  and  if  the
       extension file has a program specified for the file's extension, the specified program is executed.

       Also, it is possible to execute the commands assigned to the function key labels by clicking on them.

       The  default  auto  repeat  rate  for the mouse buttons is 400 milliseconds. This may be changed to other
       values by editing the <a href="file:~/.config/mc/ini">~/.config/mc/ini</a> file and changing the <u>mouse_repeat_rate</u> parameter.

       If you are running Midnight Commander with the mouse support, you can  get  the  default  mouse  behavior
       (cutting and pasting text) by holding down the Shift key.

</pre><h4><b>Keys</b></h4><pre>
       Some  commands  in  Midnight Commander involve the use of the <u>Control</u> (sometimes labeled CTRL or CTL) and
       the <u>Meta</u> (sometimes labeled ALT or even  Compose)  keys.  In  this  manual  we  will  use  the  following
       abbreviations:

       <b>C-&lt;chr&gt;</b>
              means  hold the Control key while typing the character &lt;chr&gt;.  Thus C-f would be: hold the Control
              key and type f.

       <b>Alt-&lt;chr&gt;</b>
              means hold the Meta or Alt key down while typing &lt;chr&gt;.  If there is no Meta or Alt key, type <u>Esc</u>,
              release it, then type the character &lt;chr&gt;.

       <b>S-&lt;chr&gt;</b>
              means hold the Shift key down while typing &lt;chr&gt;.

       All input lines in Midnight Commander use an  approximation  to  the  GNU  Emacs  editor's  key  bindings
       (default).

       You may redefine key bindings. See <u>redefine</u> <u>hotkey</u> <u>bindings</u>

       for more info. All other key bindings (described in this manual) are relative to default behavior.

       There are many sections which tell about the keys. The following are the most important.

       The  File Menu section documents the keyboard shortcuts for the commands appearing in the File menu. This
       section includes the function keys. Most of these commands perform some action, usually on  the  selected
       file or the tagged files.

       The  Directory Panels section documents the keys which select a file or tag files as a target for a later
       action (the action is usually one from the file menu).

       The Shell Command Line section list the keys which are used for entering and editing command lines.  Most
       of  these  copy  file  names  and  such from the directory panels to the command line (to avoid excessive
       typing) or access the command line history.

       Input Line Keys are used for editing input lines. This means both the command line and the input lines in
       the query dialogs.

</pre><h4><b>Redefine</b> <b>hotkey</b> <b>bindings</b></h4><pre>
       Hotkey bindings may be read from external file (keymap-file).  Initially, Midnight Commander creates  key
       bindings  using  keymap  defined  in  the  source  code.  Then,  two  files  <b>/usr/share/mc/mc.keymap</b>  and
       <b>/etc/mc/mc.keymap</b> are loaded always, sequentially reassigned key bindings defined earlier.   User-defined
       keymap-file is searched on the following algorithm (to the first one found):

              1) command line option <b>-K</b> <b>&lt;keymap&gt;</b> or <b>--keymap=&lt;keymap&gt;</b>
              2) Environment variable <b>MC_KEYMAP</b>
              3) Parameter <b>keymap</b> in section <b>[Midnight-Commander]</b> of config file.
              4) File <b><a href="file:~/.config/mc/mc.keymap">~/.config/mc/mc.keymap</a></b>

       Command  line  option, environment variable and parameter in config file may contain the absolute path to
       the keymap-file (with the extension .keymap or without it). Search of keymap-file will occur in  (to  the
       first one found):

              1) <b><a href="file:~/.config/mc">~/.config/mc</a></b>
              2) <b>/etc/mc/</b>
              3) <b>/usr/share/mc/</b>

</pre><h4><b>Miscellaneous</b> <b>Keys</b></h4><pre>
       Here are some keys which don't fall into any of the other categories:

       <b>Enter</b>  if there is some text in the command line (the one at the bottom of the panels), then that command
              is executed. If there is no text in the command line then if the selection bar is over a directory
              the  Midnight  Commander  does a <b><a href="../man2/chdir.2.html">chdir</a>(2)</b> to the selected directory and reloads the information on
              the panel; if the selection is an executable file then it is executed. Finally, if  the  extension
              of  the  selected  file  name  matches  one  of  the  extensions  in  the extensions file then the
              corresponding command is executed.

       <b>C-l</b>    repaint all the information in Midnight Commander.

       <b>C-x</b> <b>c</b>  run the Chmod command on a file or on the tagged files.

       <b>C-x</b> <b>o</b>  run the Chown command on the current file or on the tagged files.

       <b>C-x</b> <b>l</b>  run the hard link command.

       <b>C-x</b> <b>s</b>  run the absolute symbolic link command.

       <b>C-x</b> <b>v</b>  run the relative symbolic link command. See the File  Menu  section  for  more  information  about
              symbolic links.

       <b>C-x</b> <b>i</b>  set the other panel display mode to information.

       <b>C-x</b> <b>q</b>  set the other panel display mode to quick view.

       <b>C-x</b> <b>!</b>  execute the External panelize command.

       <b>C-x</b> <b>h</b>  run the add directory to hotlist command.

       <b>Alt-!</b>  executes the Filtered view command, described in the view command.

       <b>Alt-?</b>  executes the Find file command.

       <b>Alt-c</b>  pops up the quick cd dialog.

       <b>C-o</b>    when  the program is being run in the Linux or FreeBSD console or under an xterm, it will show you
              the output of the previous command.  When ran on the Linux console,  Midnight  Commander  uses  an
              external program (cons.saver) to handle saving and restoring of information on the screen.

       When  the  subshell  support  is  compiled in, you can type C-o at any time and you will be taken back to
       Midnight Commander's main screen, to  return  to  your  application  just  type  C-o.   If  you  have  an
       application  suspended  by  using  this  trick, you won't be able to execute other programs from Midnight
       Commander until you terminate the suspended application.

</pre><h4><b>Directory</b> <b>Panels</b></h4><pre>
       This section lists the keys which operate on the directory panels. If you want to know how to change  the
       appearance of the panels take a look at the section on Left and Right Menus.

       <b>Tab,</b> <b>C-i</b>
              change  the  current  panel. The old other panel becomes the new current panel and the old current
              panel becomes the new other panel. The selection bar moves from the old current panel to  the  new
              current panel.

       <b>Insert,</b> <b>C-t</b>
              to tag files you may use the Insert key (the kich1 terminfo sequence).  To untag files, just retag
              a tagged file.

       <b>Alt-e</b>  to  change charset of panel you may use Alt-e (M-e).  Recoding is made from selected codepage into
              system codepage. To cancel the recoding, select "No translation" in the dialog of encodings.

       <b>Alt-g,</b> <b>Alt-r,</b> <b>Alt-j</b>
              used to select the top file in a panel, the middle file and the bottom one, respectively.

       <b>Alt-t</b>  toggle the current display listing to show the next display  listing  format.   With  this  it  is
              possible  to  quickly switch to brief listing, long listing, user defined listing format, and back
              to the default.

       <b>C-\</b> <b>(control-backslash)</b>
              show the directory hotlist and change to the selected directory.

       <b>+</b>  <b>(plus)</b>
              this is used to select (tag) a group of files. Midnight Commander  will  prompt  for  a  selection
              options.  When  <u>Files</u>  <u>only</u> checkbox is on, only files will be selected.  If <u>Files</u> <u>only</u> is off, as
              files as directories will be selected.  When <u>Shell</u> <u>Patterns</u> checkbox is on, the regular expression
              is much like the filename globbing in the shell (* standing for zero  or  more  characters  and  ?
              standing  for  one  character).  If  <u>Shell</u> <u>Patterns</u> is off, then the tagging of files is done with
              normal regular expressions (see ed (1)). When <u>Case</u> <u>sensitive</u> checkbox is on, the selection will be
              case sensitive characters.  If <u>Case</u> <u>sensitive</u> is off, the case will be ignored.

       <b>\</b> <b>(backslash)</b>
              use the "\" key to unselect a group of files. This is the opposite of the Plus key.

       <b>up-key,</b> <b>C-p</b>
              move the selection bar to the previous entry in the panel.

       <b>down-key,</b> <b>C-n</b>
              move the selection bar to the next entry in the panel.

       <b>home,</b> <b>a1,</b> <b>Alt-&lt;</b>
              move the selection bar to the first entry in the panel.

       <b>end,</b> <b>c1,</b> <b>Alt-&gt;</b>
              move the selection bar to the last entry in the panel.

       <b>next-page,</b> <b>C-v</b>
              move the selection bar one page down.

       <b>prev-page,</b> <b>Alt-v</b>
              move the selection bar one page up.

       <b>Alt-o</b>  If the currently selected file is a directory, load that directory on the other  panel  and  moves
              the selection to the next file. If the currently selected file is not a directory, load the parent
              directory on the other panel and moves the selection to the next file.

       <b>Alt-i</b>  make  the  current  directory  of the current panel also the current directory of the other panel.
              Put the other panel to the listing mode if needed.  If the current panel is panelized,  the  other
              panel doesn't become panelized.

       <b>C-PageUp,</b> <b>C-PageDown</b>
              only  when  supported  by  the  terminal:  change  to ".." and to the currently selected directory
              respectively.

       <b>Alt-y</b>  moves to the previous directory in the history, equivalent to clicking the <u>&lt;</u> with the mouse.

       <b>Alt-u</b>  moves to the next directory in the history, equivalent to clicking the <u>&gt;</u> with the mouse.

       <b>Alt-S-h,</b> <b>Alt-H</b>
              displays the directory history, equivalent to depressing the 'v' with the mouse.

</pre><h4><b>Quick</b> <b>search</b></h4><pre>
       The Quick search mode allows you to perform fast file search in file panel.  Press <u>C-s</u> or <u>Alt-s</u> to  start
       a filename search in the directory listing.

       When the search is active, the user input will be added to the search string instead of the command line.
       If  the  <u>Show</u>  <u>mini-status</u>  option  is  enabled  the search string is shown on the mini-status line. When
       typing, the selection bar will move to the next file starting with the typed letters.  The  <u>Backspace</u>  or
       <u>DEL</u> keys can be used to correct typing mistakes. If C-s is pressed again, the next match is searched for.

       If  quick  search  is started with double pressing of C-s, the previous quick search pattern will be used
       for current search.

       Besides the filename characters, you can also use wildcard characters '*' and '?'.

</pre><h4><b>Shell</b> <b>Command</b> <b>Line</b></h4><pre>
       This section lists keys which are useful to avoid excessive typing when entering shell commands.

       <b>Alt-Enter</b>
              copy the currently selected file name to the command line.

       <b>C-Enter</b>
              same a Alt-Enter.  May not work on remote systems and some terminals.

       <b>C-S-Enter</b>
              copy the full path name of the currently selected file to the  command  line.   May  not  work  on
              remote systems and some terminals.

       <b>Alt-Tab</b>
              does the filename, command, variable, username and hostname completion for you.

       <b>C-x</b> <b>t,</b> <b>C-x</b> <b>C-t</b>
              copy  the  tagged  files (or if there are no tagged files, the selected file) of the current panel
              (C-x t) or of the other panel (C-x C-t) to the command line.

       <b>C-x</b> <b>p,</b> <b>C-x</b> <b>C-p</b>
              the first key sequence copies the current path name to the command line, and the second one copies
              the unselected panel's path name to the command line.

       <b>C-q</b>    the quote command can be used to insert characters that  are  otherwise  interpreted  by  Midnight
              Commander (like the '+' symbol)

       <b>Alt-p,</b> <b>Alt-n</b>
              use  these  keys  to  browse through the command history. Alt-p takes you to the last entry, Alt-n
              takes you to the next one.

       <b>Alt-h</b>  displays the history for the current input line.

</pre><h4><b>General</b> <b>Movement</b> <b>Keys</b></h4><pre>
       The help viewer, the file viewer and the directory tree use common code to handle moving. Therefore  they
       accept exactly the same keys. Each of them also accepts some keys of its own.

       Other  parts  of Midnight Commander use some of the same movement keys, so this section may be of use for
       those parts too.

       <b>Up,</b> <b>C-p</b>
              moves one line backward.

       <b>Down,</b> <b>C-n</b>
              moves one line forward.

       <b>Prev</b> <b>Page,</b> <b>Page</b> <b>Up,</b> <b>Alt-v</b>
              moves one page up.

       <b>Next</b> <b>Page,</b> <b>Page</b> <b>Down,</b> <b>C-v</b>
              moves one page down.

       <b>Home,</b> <b>A1</b>
              moves to the beginning.

       <b>End,</b> <b>C1</b>
              move to the end.

       The help viewer and the file viewer accept the following keys in addition the to ones mentioned above:

       <b>b,</b> <b>C-b,</b> <b>C-h,</b> <b>Backspace,</b> <b>Delete</b>
              moves one page up.

       <b>Space</b> <b>bar</b>
              moves one page down.

       <b>u,</b> <b>d</b>   moves one half of a page up or down.

       <b>g,</b> <b>G</b>   moves to the beginning or to the end.

</pre><h4><b>Input</b> <b>Line</b> <b>Keys</b></h4><pre>
       The input lines (they are used for the command line and for the query  dialogs  in  the  program)  accept
       these keys:

       <b>C-a</b>    puts the cursor at the beginning of line.

       <b>C-e</b>    puts the cursor at the end of the line.

       <b>C-b,</b> <b>move-left</b>
              move the cursor one position left.

       <b>C-f,</b> <b>move-right</b>
              move the cursor one position right.

       <b>Alt-f</b>  moves one word forward.

       <b>Alt-b</b>  moves one word backward.

       <b>C-h,</b> <b>Backspace</b>
              delete the previous character.

       <b>C-d,</b> <b>Delete</b>
              delete the character in the point (over the cursor).

       <b>C-@</b>    sets the mark for cutting.

       <b>C-w</b>    copies  the  text  between  the cursor and the mark to a kill buffer and removes the text from the
              input line.

       <b>Alt-w</b>  copies the text between the cursor and the mark to a kill buffer.

       <b>C-y</b>    yanks back the contents of the kill buffer.

       <b>C-k</b>    kills the text from the cursor to the end of the line.

       <b>Alt-p,</b> <b>Alt-n</b>
              Use these keys to browse through the command history. Alt-p takes you to  the  last  entry,  Alt-n
              takes you to the next one.

       <b>Alt-C-h,</b> <b>Alt-Backspace</b>
              delete one word backward.

       <b>Alt-Tab</b>
              does the filename, command, variable, username and hostname completion for you.

</pre><h4><b>Menu</b> <b>Bar</b></h4><pre>
       The  menu bar pops up when you press F9 or click the mouse on the top row of the screen. The menu bar has
       five menus: "Left", "File", "Command", "Options" and "Right".

       The Left and Right Menus allow you to modify the appearance of the left and right directory panels.

       The File Menu lists the actions you can perform on the currently selected file or the tagged files.

       The Command Menu lists the actions which are more general and bear no relation to the currently  selected
       file or the tagged files.

       The Options Menu lists the actions which allow you to customize Midnight Commander.

</pre><h4><b>Left</b> <b>and</b> <b>Right</b> <b>(Above</b> <b>and</b> <b>Below)</b> <b>Menus</b></h4><pre>
       The  outlook  of  the directory panels can be changed from the <b>Left</b> and <b>Right</b> menus (they are named <b>Above</b>
       and <b>Below</b> when the horizontal panel split is chosen from the Layout options dialog).

</pre><h4><b>Listing</b> <b>Format...</b></h4><pre>
       The listing mode view is used to display a listing of files, there are  four  different  listing  formats
       available: <b>Full</b>, <b>Brief</b>, <b>Long</b> and <b>User</b>.  The full directory view shows the file name, the size of the file
       and the modification time.

       The  brief  view shows only the file name and it has from 1 up to 9 columns (therefore showing more files
       unlike other views). The long view is similar to the output of <b>ls</b> <b>-l</b> command. The  long  view  takes  the
       whole screen width.

       If you choose the "User" display format, then you have to specify the display format.

       The  user  display format must start with a panel size specifier.  This may be "half" or "full", and they
       specify a half screen panel and a full screen panel respectively.

       After the panel size, you may specify how many listings to fit  in  the  panel,  side-by-side  (in  other
       words:  how  many  times  to  repeat the fields horizontally). This defaults to 1. You may change this by
       adding a number from 1 to 9 to the format string.

       After this you add the name of the fields with an optional size specifier.  This are the available fields
       you may display:

       <b>name</b>   displays the file name.

       <b>size</b>   displays the file size.

       <b>bsize</b>  is an alternative form of the <b>size</b> format. It displays the size of the files and  for  directories
              it just shows SUB-DIR or UP--DIR.

       <b>type</b>   displays  a  one  character wide type field.  This character is similar to what is displayed by ls
              with the -F flag - <b>*</b> for executable files, <b>/</b> for directories, <b>@</b> for links, <b>=</b> for  sockets,  <b>-</b>  for
              character  devices,  <b>+</b>  for  block devices, <b>|</b> for pipes, <b>~</b> for symbolic links to directories and <b>!</b>
              for stale symlinks (links that point nowhere).

       <b>mark</b>   an asterisk if the file is tagged, a space if it's not.

       <b>mtime</b>  file's last modification time.

       <b>atime</b>  file's last access time.

       <b>ctime</b>  file's status change time.

       <b>perm</b>   a string representing the current permission bits of the file.

       <b>mode</b>   an octal value with the current permission bits of the file.

       <b>nlink</b>  the number of links to the file.

       <b>ngid</b>   the GID (numeric).

       <b>nuid</b>   the UID (numeric).

       <b>owner</b>  the owner of the file.

       <b>group</b>  the group of the file.

       <b>inode</b>  the inode of the file.

       Also you can use following keywords to define the panel layout:

       <b>space</b>  a space in the display format.

       <b>|</b>      add a vertical line to the display format.

       To force one field to a fixed size (a size  specifier),  you  just  add  <b>:</b>  followed  by  the  number  of
       characters  you  want  the  field  to  have.   If  the  number is followed by the symbol <b>+</b>, then the size
       specifies the minimal field size - if the program finds out that there is more space on  the  screen,  it
       will then expand that field.

       For example, the <b>Full</b> display corresponds to this format:

       half type name | size | mtime

       And the <b>Long</b> display corresponds to this format:

       full perm space nlink space owner space group space size space mtime space name

       This is a nice user display format:

       half name | size:7 | type mode:3

       Panels may also be set to the following modes:

       <b>Info</b>   The  info  view  display  information  related  to  the  currently  selected  file and if possible
              information about the current file system.

       <b>Tree</b>   The tree view is quite similar to the directory tree feature. See the section about  it  for  more
              information.

       <b>Quick</b> <b>View</b>
              In  this  mode,  the  panel  will  switch  to  a  reduced viewer that displays the contents of the
              currently selected file, if you select the panel (with the tab key or the mouse),  you  will  have
              access to the usual viewer commands.

</pre><h4><b>Sort</b> <b>Order...</b></h4><pre>
       The  eight  sort  orders  are  by  name, by extension, by modification time, by access time, and by inode
       information modification time, by size, by inode and unsorted.  In the Sort  order  dialog  box  you  can
       choose  the  sort  order  and  you  may also specify if you want to sort in reverse order by checking the
       reverse box.

       By default directories are sorted before files but this can  be  changed  from  the  Panel  options  menu
       (option <b>Mix</b> <b>all</b> <b>files</b>).

</pre><h4><b>Filter...</b></h4><pre>
       The  filter  command  allows  you  to  specify a shell pattern (for example <b>*.tar.gz</b>) which the files and
       directories must match to be shown.  The input line allow enter the pattern of file/directory names  that
       will be shown in the panel.

       When  <u>Files</u>  <u>only</u>  checkbox  is on, only files will be matched to the filter, and all directories will be
       shown. Otherwise, as files as directories will be filtered. When  <u>Shell</u>  <u>Patterns</u>  checkbox  is  on,  the
       regular  expression  is  much  like  the  filename  globbing  in  the  shell (* standing for zero or more
       characters and ? standing for one character). Otherwise, the matching of files/directories is  done  with
       normal  regular  expressions  (see <a href="../man1/ed.1.html">ed</a>(1)). When <u>Case</u> <u>sensitive</u> checkbox is on, the filtering will be case
       sensitive characters. Otherwise, the case will be ignored.

</pre><h4><b>Reread</b></h4><pre>
       The reread command reload the list of files in the directory.  It  is  useful  if  other  processes  have
       created or removed files.

</pre><h4><b>File</b> <b>Menu</b></h4><pre>
       Midnight  Commander uses the F1 - F10 keys as keyboard shortcuts for commands appearing in the file menu.
       The escape sequences for the function keys are terminfo  capabilities  kf1  trough  kf10.   On  terminals
       without  function  key support, you can achieve the same functionality by pressing the Esc key and then a
       number in the range 1 through 9 and 0 (corresponding to F1 to F9 and F10 respectively).

       The File menu has the following commands (keyboard shortcuts in parentheses):

       <b>Help</b> <b>(F1)</b>

       Invokes the built-in hypertext help viewer. Inside the help viewer, you can use the Tab key to select the
       next link and the Enter key to follow that link. The keys Space and Backspace are used  to  move  forward
       and backward in a help page. Press F1 again to get the full list of accepted keys.

       <b>Menu</b> <b>(F2)</b>

       Invoke  the  user  menu.   The  user menu provides an easy way to provide users with a menu and add extra
       features to Midnight Commander.

       <b>View</b> <b>(F3,</b> <b>F13)</b>

       View the currently selected file. By default this invokes the Internal File Viewer but if the option "Use
       internal view" is off, it invokes an external file viewer specified by the <b>VIEWER</b>  environment  variable.
       If  <b>VIEWER</b> is undefined, the <b>PAGER</b> environment variable is tried.  If <b>PAGER</b> is also undefined, the "view"
       command is invoked.  If you use F13 instead, the viewer will be invoked without doing any  formatting  or
       preprocessing to the file.

       See  parameters  for external viewer for explain how you may specify an extended command line options for
       external viewers.

       <b>Filtered</b> <b>View</b> <b>(Alt-!)</b>

       This command prompts for a command and its arguments (the argument defaults  to  the  currently  selected
       file name), the output from such command is shown in the internal file viewer.

       <b>Edit</b> <b>(F4,</b> <b>F14)</b>

       Press  F4  to  edit  the highlighted file.  Press F14 (usually F14) to start the editor with a new, empty
       file.  Currently they invoke the <b>vi</b> editor, or the editor specified in the <b>EDITOR</b>  environment  variable,
       or the Internal File Editor if the use_internal_edit option is on.

       See  parameters  for external editor for explain how you may specify an extended command line options for
       external editors.

       <b>Copy</b> <b>(F5,</b> <b>F15)</b>

       Press F5 to pop up an input dialog to copy the currently selected file (or the tagged files, if there  is
       at  least  one  file  tagged)  to the directory/filename you specify in the input dialog. The destination
       defaults to the directory in the non-selected panel. Space  for  destination  file  may  be  preallocated
       relative  to  preallocate_space configure option.  During this process, you can press C-c or Esc to abort
       the operation.  For details about source mask (which will be usually either * or  ^\(.*\)$  depending  on
       setting of Use shell patterns) and possible wildcards in the destination see Mask copy/rename.

       F15  (usually F15) is similar, but defaults to the directory in the selected panel. It always operates on
       the selected file, regardless of any tagged files.

       On some systems, it is possible to do the copy in the background by clicking on the background button (or
       pressing Alt-b in the dialog box).  The Background Jobs is used to control the background process.

       <b>Link</b> <b>(C-x</b> <b>l)</b>

       Create a hard link to the current file.

       <b>Absolute</b> <b>symlink</b> <b>(C-x</b> <b>s)</b>

       Create a absolute symbolic link to the current file.

       <b>Relative</b> <b>symLink</b> <b>(C-x</b> <b>v)</b>

       Create a relative symbolic link to the current file.

       To those of you who don't know what links are: creating a link to a file is a bit like copying the  file,
       but  both the source filename and the destination filename represent the same file image. For example, if
       you edit one of these files, all changes you make will appear in  both  files.  Some  people  call  links
       aliases or shortcuts.

       A hard link appears as a real file. After making it, there is no way of telling which one is the original
       and  which  is  the  link.  If  you  delete  either one of them the other one is still intact. It is very
       difficult to notice that the files represent the same image. Use hard links when you don't even  want  to
       know.

       A  symbolic  link  is  a  reference to the name of the original file. If the original file is deleted the
       symbolic link is useless. It is quite easy to notice that the files represent the  same  image.  Midnight
       Commander  shows  an  "@"-sign in front of the file name if it is a symbolic link to somewhere (except to
       directory, where it shows a tilde (~)).  The  original  file  which  the  link  points  to  is  shown  on
       mini-status line if the <u>Show</u> <u>mini-status</u> option is enabled. Use symbolic links when you want to avoid the
       confusion that can be caused by hard links.

       When  you  press  "C-x s" Midnight Commander will automatically fill in the complete path+filename of the
       original file and suggest a name for the link.  You can change either one.

       Sometimes you may want to change the absolute path of the original into a relative path. An absolute path
       starts from the root directory:

       <u>/home/frodo/mc/mc</u> <u>-&gt;</u> <u>/home/frodo/new/mc</u>

       A relative link describes the original file's location starting from the location of the link itself:

       <u>/home/frodo/mc/mc</u> <u>-&gt;</u> <u>../new/mc</u>

       You can force Midnight Commander to suggest a relative path by pressing "C-x v" instead of "C-x s".

       <b>Rename/Move</b> <b>(F6,</b> <b>F16)</b>

       Press F6 to pop up an input dialog to copy the currently selected file (or the tagged files, if there  is
       at  least  one  file  tagged) to the directory/filename you specify in the input dialog.  The destination
       defaults to the directory in the non-selected panel. For more details look at Copy (F5) operation  above,
       most of the things are quite similar.

       F16  (usually F16) is similar, but defaults to the directory in the selected panel. It always operates on
       the selected file, regardless of any tagged files.

       On some systems, it is possible to do the copy in the background by clicking on the background button (or
       pressing Alt-b in the dialog box).  The Background Jobs is used to control the background process.

       <b>Mkdir</b> <b>(F7)</b>

       Pop up an input dialog and creates the directory specified.

       <b>Delete</b> <b>(F8)</b>

       Delete the currently selected file or the tagged files  in  the  currently  selected  panel.  During  the
       process, you can press C-c or Esc to abort the operation.

       <b>Quick</b> <b>cd</b> <b>(Alt-c)</b> Use the quick cd command if you have full command line and want to cd somewhere.

       <b>Select</b> <b>group</b> <b>(+)</b>

       This  is  used  to select (tag) a group of files. Midnight Commander will prompt for a selection options.
       When <u>Files</u> <u>only</u> checkbox is on, only files will  be  selected.   If  <u>Files</u>  <u>only</u>  is  off,  as  files  as
       directories  will  be  selected.  When <u>Shell</u> <u>Patterns</u> checkbox is on, the regular expression is much like
       the filename globbing in the shell (* standing for zero or  more  characters  and  ?   standing  for  one
       character).  If  <u>Shell</u> <u>Patterns</u> is off, then the tagging of files is done with normal regular expressions
       (see ed (1)). When <u>Case</u> <u>sensitive</u> checkbox is on, the selection will be case  sensitive  characters.   If
       <u>Case</u> <u>sensitive</u> is off, the case will be ignored.

       <b>Unselect</b> <b>group</b> <b>(\)</b>

       Used to unselect a group of files. This is the opposite of the <u>Select</u> <u>group</u> command.

       <b>Quit</b> <b>(F10,</b> <b>S-F10)</b>

       Terminate  Midnight  Commander.  S-F10 is used when you want to quit and you are using the shell wrapper.
       S-F10 will not take you to the last directory you visited with Midnight Commander, instead it  will  stay
       at the directory where you started Midnight Commander.

</pre><h4><b>Quick</b> <b>cd</b></h4><pre>
       This  command  is  useful if you have a full command line and want to cd somewhere without having to yank
       and paste the command line. This command pops up a small dialog, where you  enter  everything  you  would
       enter  after  <b>cd</b>  on  the  command  line  and then you press enter. This features all the things that are
       already in the internal cd command.

</pre><h4><b>Command</b> <b>Menu</b></h4><pre>
       The Directory tree command shows a tree figure of the directories.

       The "Find file" command allows you to search for a specific file.

       The "Swap panels" command swaps the contents of the two directory panels.

       The "Switch panels on/off" command shows the output of the last shell command.  This works only on  xterm
       and on Linux and FreeBSD console.

       The  "Compare  directories"  command  compares the directory panels with each other. You can then use the
       Copy (F5) command to make the panels identical.  There  are  three  compare  methods.  The  quick  method
       compares  only  file  size  and  file  date.  The  thorough method makes a full byte-by-byte compare. The
       size-only compare method just compares the file sizes and does not check the contents or the date  times,
       it just checks the file size.

       The  "External  panelize"  allows you to execute an external program, and make the output of that program
       the contents of the current panel.

       The "Command history" command shows a list of typed commands. The  selected  command  is  copied  to  the
       command line. The command history can also be accessed by typing Alt-p or Alt-n.

       The "Directory hotlist" command makes changing of the current directory to often used directories faster.

       The  "Screen  list"  command  shows  a dialog window with the list of currently running internal editors,
       viewers and other MC modules that support this mode.

       The "Edit extension file" command allows you to specify programs to executed when  you  try  to  execute,
       view, edit and do a bunch of other thing on files with certain extensions (filename endings).

       The "Edit Menu File" command may be used for editing the user menu (which appears by pressing F2).

</pre><h4><b>Directory</b> <b>Tree</b></h4><pre>
       The  Directory  Tree  command shows a tree figure of the directories. You can select a directory from the
       figure and Midnight Commander will change to that directory.

       There are two ways to invoke the tree. The real directory tree command is available from  Commands  menu.
       The other way is to select tree view from the Left or Right menu.

       To  get rid of long delays, Midnight Commander creates the tree figure by scanning only a small subset of
       all the directories. If the directory which you want to see is missing, move to its parent directory  and
       press C-r (or F2).

       You can use the following keys:

       General movement keys
              are accepted.

       <b>Enter.</b> In  the  directory  tree,  exits  the  directory tree and changes to this directory in the current
              panel. In the tree view, changes to this directory in the other panel and stays in tree view  mode
              in the current panel.

       <b>C-r,</b> <b>F2</b> <b>(Rescan).</b>
              Rescan  this directory. Use this when the tree figure is out of date: it is missing subdirectories
              or shows some subdirectories which don't exist any more.

       <b>F3</b> <b>(Forget).</b>
              Delete this directory from the tree figure. Use this to remove clutter from  the  figure.  If  you
              want the directory back to the tree figure press F2 in its parent directory.

       <b>F4</b> <b>(Static/Dynamic).</b>
              Toggle between the dynamic navigation mode (default) and the static navigation mode.

       In  the  static  navigation  mode  you  can  use  the  Up  and Down keys to select a directory. All known
       directories are shown.

       In the dynamic navigation mode you can use the Up and Down keys to select a sibling directory,  the  Left
       key  to  move  to  the parent directory, and the Right key to move to a child directory. Only the parent,
       sibling and children directories are shown, others are left out. The tree figure changes  dynamically  as
       you traverse.

       <b>F5</b> <b>(Copy).</b>
              Copy the directory.

       <b>F6</b> <b>(RenMov).</b>
              Move the directory.

       <b>F7</b> <b>(Mkdir).</b>
              Make a new directory below this directory.

       <b>F8</b> <b>(Delete).</b>
              Delete this directory from the file system.

       <b>C-s,</b> <b>Alt-s.</b>
              Search  the  next  directory  matching the search string. If there is no such directory these keys
              will move one line down.

       <b>C-h,</b> <b>Backspace.</b>
              Delete the last character of the search string.

       <b>Any</b> <b>other</b> <b>character.</b>
              Add the character to the search string and move to the next  directory  which  starts  with  these
              characters.  In  the tree view you must first activate the search mode by pressing C-s. The search
              string is shown in the mini status line.

       The following actions are available only in the directory tree. They aren't supported in the tree view.

       <b>F1</b> <b>(Help).</b>
              Invoke the help viewer and show this section.

       <b>Esc,</b> <b>F10.</b>
              Exit the directory tree. Do not change the directory.

       The mouse is supported. A double-click behaves like Enter. See also the section on mouse support.

</pre><h4><b>Find</b> <b>File</b></h4><pre>
       The Find File feature first asks for the start directory for the search and the filename to  be  searched
       for. By pressing the Tree button you can select the start directory from the directory tree figure.

       The  "File name" input field contains a filename pattern to be searched for. It is interpreted as a shell
       pattern or as a regular expression depending on the state of the  "Using  shell  patterns"  checkbox.  An
       empty value is valid and matches any file name.

       The  "Content"  input  field  contains a string to search for within the files. Leave this field empty to
       disable searching file contents.

       Option "Whole words" allows select only those files containing matches that form whole words.  Like  grep
       -w.

       You  can start the search by pressing the OK button.  During the search you can stop from the Stop button
       and continue from the Start button.

       You can browse the filelist with the up and down  arrow  keys.  The  Chdir  button  will  change  to  the
       directory  of the currently selected file. The Again button will ask for the parameters for a new search.
       The Quit button quits the search operation. The Panelize button will place the found files to the current
       directory panel so that you can do additional operations on them (view, copy, move, delete and so on). To
       return to the normal file listing, change directory to "..".

       The 'Enable ignore directories' checkbox and input field below it  allow  one  to  set  up  the  list  of
       directories that should be skip during the search files (for example, you may want to avoid searches on a
       CD-ROM  or on a NFS directory that is mounted across a slow link). List components must be separated with
       a colon, here is an example:

       /cdrom:/nfs/wuarchive:/afs

       Relative paths are supported also. The following example shows how to skip special directories of version
       control systems:
       /cdrom:/nfs/wuarchive:/afs:.svn:.git:CVS

       Attention: input field can contain a dot (.), this means the current absolute path.

       You may consider using the External panelize command for some operations. Find file command is for simple
       queries only, while using External panelize you can do as mysterious searches as you would like.

</pre><h4><b>External</b> <b>panelize</b></h4><pre>
       The External panelize allows you to execute an external program, and make the output of that program  the
       contents of the current panel.

       For  example,  if  you  want  to  manipulate  in  one of the panels all the symbolic links in the current
       directory, you can use external panelization to run the following command:

       find . -type l -print

       Upon command completion, the directory contents of the panel will no longer be the directory  listing  of
       the current directory, but all the files that are symbolic links.

       If you want to panelize all of the files that have been downloaded from your FTP server, you can use this
       awk command to extract the file name from the transfer log files:

       awk '$9 ~! /incoming/ { print $9 }' &lt; /var/log/xferlog

       You  may  want to save often used panelize commands under a descriptive name, so that you can recall them
       quickly. You do this by typing the command on the input line and pressing Add new button. Then you  enter
       a  name  under  which  you want the command to be saved. Next time, you just choose that command from the
       list and do not have to type it again.

</pre><h4><b>Hotlist</b></h4><pre>
       The Directory hotlist command shows the labels of the directories  in  the  directory  hotlist.  Midnight
       Commander will change to the directory corresponding to the selected label.  From the hotlist dialog, you
       can  remove  already created label/directory pairs and add new ones.  To add new directories quickly, you
       can use the Add to hotlist command (C-x h), which adds the current directory into the directory  hotlist,
       asking just for the label for the directory.

       This  makes  cd to often used directories faster. You may consider using the CDPATH variable as described
       in internal cd command description.

</pre><h4><b>Edit</b> <b>Extension</b> <b>File</b></h4><pre>
       This will invoke your editor on the file <u><a href="file:~/.config/mc/mc.ext.ini">~/.config/mc/mc.ext.ini</a></u>.  If this file does not  exist  and  you
       are  not  root,  it  will be copied from <u>/etc/mc/mc.ext.ini</u>.  If you are root, you can choose the file to
       edit: user's <u><a href="file:~/.config/mc/mc.ext.ini">~/.config/mc/mc.ext.ini</a></u> or system-wide <u>/etc/mc/mc.ext.ini</u>.   The  format  of  this  file  is
       described in detail in it.

</pre><h4><b>Background</b> <b>Jobs</b></h4><pre>
       This  lets  you  control the state of any background Midnight Commander process (only copy and move files
       operations can be done in the background).  You can stop, restart and kill a background job from here.

</pre><h4><b>Edit</b> <b>Menu</b> <b>File</b></h4><pre>
       The user menu is a menu of useful actions that can be customized by the user. When you  access  the  user
       menu,  the file .mc.menu from the current directory is used if it exists, but only if it is owned by user
       or root and is not world-writable.  If no such file found, <a href="file:~/.config/mc/menu">~/.config/mc/menu</a> is tried in  the  same  way,
       and otherwise mc uses the default system-wide menu /usr/share/mc/mc.menu.

       The  format  of  the  menu  file  is  very  simple.  Lines  that start with anything but space or tab are
       considered entries for the menu (in order to be able to use it like a hot key, the first character should
       be a letter). All the lines that start with a space or a tab are the commands that will be executed  when
       the entry is selected.

       When  an  option  is  selected  all the command lines of the option are copied to a temporary file in the
       temporary directory (usually /usr/tmp) and then that file is executed. This allows the user to put normal
       shell constructs in the menus. Also simple macro substitution takes place before executing the menu code.
       For more information, see macro substitution.

       Here is a sample mc.menu file:

       A    Dump the currently selected file
            od -c %f

       B    Edit a bug report and send it to root
            I=`mktemp ${MC_TMPDIR:-<a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a>}/mail.XXXXXX` || exit 1
            vi $I
            mail -s "Midnight Commander bug" root &lt; $I
            rm -f $I

       M    Read mail
            emacs -f rmail

       N    Read Usenet news
            emacs -f gnus

       H    Call the info hypertext browser
            info

       J    Copy current directory to other panel recursively
            tar cf - . | (cd %D &amp;&amp; tar xvpf -)

       K    Make a release of the current subdirectory
            echo -n "Name of distribution file: "
            read tar
            ln -s %d `dirname %d`/$tar
            cd ..
            tar cvhf ${tar}.tar $tar

       = f *.tar.gz | f *.tgz &amp; t n
       X       Extract the contents of a compressed tar file
            tar xzvf %f

       <b>Default</b> <b>Conditions</b>

       Each menu entry may be preceded by a condition. The condition must start from the first column with a '='
       character. If the condition is true, the menu entry will be the default entry.

       Condition syntax:   = &lt;sub-cond&gt;
         or:            = &lt;sub-cond&gt; | &lt;sub-cond&gt; ...
         or:            = &lt;sub-cond&gt; &amp; &lt;sub-cond&gt; ...

       Sub-condition is one of following:

         y &lt;pattern&gt;         syntax of current file matching pattern?
                      (for edit menu only)
         f &lt;pattern&gt;         current file matching pattern?
         F &lt;pattern&gt;         other file matching pattern?
         d &lt;pattern&gt;         current directory matching pattern?
         D &lt;pattern&gt;         other directory matching pattern?
         t &lt;type&gt;       current file of type?
         T &lt;type&gt;       other file of type?
         x &lt;filename&gt;        is it executable filename?
         ! &lt;sub-cond&gt;        negate the result of sub-condition

       Pattern is a normal shell pattern or a regular expression, according to the shell  patterns  option.  You
       can  override  the  global  value of the shell patterns option by writing "shell_patterns=x" on the first
       line of the menu file (where "x" is either 0 or 1).

       Type is one or more of the following characters:

         n    not a directory
         r    regular file
         d    directory
         l    link
         c    character device
         b    block device
         f    FIFO (pipe)
         s    socket
         x    executable file
         t    tagged

       For example 'rlf' means either regular file, link or fifo. The 't' type is a little  special  because  it
       acts  on  the  panel  instead  of the file. The condition '=t t' is true if there are tagged files in the
       current panel and false if not.

       If the condition starts with '=?' instead of '=' a debug trace will be shown whenever the  value  of  the
       condition is calculated.

       The conditions are calculated from left to right. This means
            = f *.tar.gz | f *.tgz &amp; t n
       is calculated as
            ( (f *.tar.gz) | (f *.tgz) ) &amp; (t n)

       Here is a sample of the use of conditions:

       = f *.tar.gz | f *.tgz &amp; t n
       L    List the contents of a compressed tar-archive
            gzip -cd %f | tar xvf -

       <b>Addition</b> <b>Conditions</b>

       If  the  condition begins with '+' (or '+?') instead of '=' (or '=?') it is an addition condition. If the
       condition is true the menu entry will be included in the menu. If the condition is false the  menu  entry
       will not be included in the menu.

       You  can  combine  default  and  addition conditions by starting condition with '+=' or '=+' (or '+=?' or
       '=+?' if you want debug trace). If you want to use two different conditions, one for adding  and  another
       for  defaulting, you can precede a menu entry with two condition lines, one starting with '+' and another
       starting with '='.

       Comments are started with '#'. The additional comment lines must start with '#', space or tab.

</pre><h4><b>Options</b> <b>Menu</b></h4><pre>
       Midnight Commander has some options that may  be  toggled  on  and  off  in  several  dialogs  which  are
       accessible from this menu. Options are enabled if they have an asterisk or "x" in front of them.

       The  Configuration  command  pops  up  a  dialog  from  which you can change most of settings of Midnight
       Commander.

       The Layout command pops up a dialog from which you specify a bunch of options how mc looks  like  on  the
       screen.

       The Panel options command pops up a dialog from which you specify options of file manager panels.

       The Confirmation command pops up a dialog from which you specify which actions you want to confirm.

       The Appearance command pops up a dialog from which you specify the skin.

       The  Display  bits  command  pops up a dialog from which you may select which characters is your terminal
       able to display.

       The Learn keys command pops up a dialog from which you test some keys  which  are  not  working  on  some
       terminals and you may fix them.

       The Virtual FS command pops up a dialog from which you specify some VFS related options.

       The Save setup command saves the current settings of the Left, Right and Options menus. A small number of
       other settings is saved, too.

</pre><h4><b>Configuration</b></h4><pre>
       The  options  in  this  dialog are divided into several groups: "File operation options", "Esc key mode",
       "Pause after run" and "Other options".

       <b>File</b> <b>operation</b> <b>options</b>

       <u>Verbose</u> <u>operation.</u>  This toggles whether the file Copy, Rename and Delete operations are  verbose  (i.e.,
       display  a  dialog  box  for  each  operation).  If you have a slow terminal, you may wish to disable the
       verbose operation. It is automatically turned off if the speed of your terminal is less than 9600 bps.

       <u>Compute</u> <u>totals.</u>  If this option is enabled, Midnight Commander computes total byte sizes and total number
       of files prior to any Copy, Rename and Delete operations. This will provide  you  with  a  more  accurate
       progress bar at the expense of some speed. This option has no effect, if <u>Verbose</u> <u>operation</u> is disabled.

       <u>Classic</u> <u>progressbar.</u>  If this option is enabled, the progressbar of Copy/Move/Delete operations is always
       grown  form  left  to  right.  If  disabled, the growing direction of progressbar follows to direction of
       Copy/Move/Delete operation: from left panel to right one and vice versa. Enabled by default.

       <u>Mkdir</u> <u>autoname.</u>  When you press F7 to create a new directory, the input line  in  popup  dialog  will  be
       filled by name of current file or directory in active panel.  Disabled by default.

       <u>Preallocate</u>  <u>space.</u>   Preallocate  space  for  whole  target  file,  if  possible, before copy operation.
       Disabled by default.

       <b>Esc</b> <b>key</b> <b>mode.</b>

       By default, Midnight Commander treats the Esc key as a key prefix.  Therefore, you should press Esc  code
       twice to exit a dialog. But there is a possibility to use a single press of Esc key for that action.

       <u>Single</u>  <u>press.</u>  By default this option is disabled. If you'll enable it, the Esc key will act as a prefix
       key for set up time interval (see <u>Timeout</u> option below), and if no extra keys have arrived, then the  Esc
       key is interpreted as a cancel key (Esc Esc).

       <u>Timeout.</u>   This options is used to setup the time interval (in microseconds) for single press of Esc key.
       By default, this interval is one  second  (1000000  microseconds).  Also  the  timeout  can  be  set  via
       KEYBOARD_KEY_TIMEOUT_US  environment  variable  (also  in  microseconds),  which has higher priority than
       Timeout option value.

       <b>Pause</b> <b>after</b> <b>run</b>

       After executing your commands, Midnight Commander can pause, so that you can examine the  output  of  the
       command.  There are three possible settings for this variable:

       <u>Never.</u>   Means  that  you  do  not want to see the output of your command.  If you are using the Linux or
       FreeBSD console or an xterm, you will be able to see the output of the command by typing C-o.

       <u>On</u> <u>dumb</u> <u>terminals.</u>  You will get the pause message on terminals that  are  not  capable  of  showing  the
       output of the last command executed (any terminal that is not an xterm or the Linux console).

       <u>Always.</u>  The program will pause after executing all of your commands.

       <b>Other</b> <b>options</b>

       <u>Use</u>  <u>internal</u>  <u>editor.</u>  If this option is enabled, the built-in file editor is used to edit files. If the
       option is disabled, the editor specified in the <b>EDITOR</b> environment variable is used.   If  no  editor  is
       specified, <b>vi</b> is used.  See the section on the internal file editor.

       <u>Use</u>  <u>internal</u>  <u>viewer.</u>  If this option is enabled, the built-in file viewer is used to view files. If the
       option is disabled, the pager specified in the <b>PAGER</b> environment  variable  is  used.   If  no  pager  is
       specified, the <b>view</b> command is used.  See the section on the internal file viewer.

       <u>Ask</u> <u>new</u> <u>file</u> <u>name.</u>  If this option is enabled, file name is asked before open new file in editor.

       <u>Auto</u>  <u>menus.</u>   If  this option is enabled, the user menu will be invoked at startup.  Useful for building
       menus for non-unixers.

       <u>Drop</u> <u>down</u> <u>menus.</u>  When this option is enabled, the pull down menus will be activated as soon as you press
       the F9 key. Otherwise, you will only get the menu title, and you will have to activate  the  menu  either
       with the arrow keys or with the hotkeys. It is recommended if you are using hotkeys.

       <u>Shell</u>  <u>Patterns.</u>   By  default  the  Select,  Unselect  and  Filter  commands will use shell-like regular
       expressions. The following conversions are performed to achieve this: the '*' is replaced by  '.*'  (zero
       or  more  characters); the '?'  is replaced by '.' (exactly one character) and '.' by the literal dot. If
       the option is disabled, then the regular expressions are the ones described in <a href="../man1/ed.1.html">ed</a>(1).

       <u>Complete:</u> <u>show</u> <u>all.</u>  By default, Midnight Commander pops up all possible completions if the completion is
       ambiguous only when you press <b>Alt-Tab</b> for the second time.  For the first time, it just completes as much
       as possible and beeps in the case of ambiguity.  Enable this option if  you  want  to  see  all  possible
       completions even after pressing <b>Alt-Tab</b> the first time.

       <u>Rotating</u>  <u>dash.</u>   If  this  option  is enabled, the Midnight Commander shows a rotating dash in the upper
       right corner as a work in progress indicator.

       <u>Cd</u> <u>follows</u> <u>links.</u>  This option, if set,  causes  Midnight  Commander  to  follow  the  logical  chain  of
       directories  when  changing  current directory either in the panels, or using the cd command. This is the
       default behavior of bash. When unset, Midnight Commander follows the real directory structure, so  cd  ..
       if  you've entered that directory through a link will move you to the current directory's real parent and
       not to the directory where the link was present.

       <u>Safe</u> <u>delete.</u>  If this option is enabled, deleting files and  directory  hotlist  entries  unintentionally
       becomes  more difficult.  The default selection in the confirmation dialogs for deletion changes from <b>Yes</b>
       to <b>No</b>.  This option is disabled by default.

       <u>Safe</u> <u>overwrite.</u>  If this option is enabled, overwriting files  unintentionally  becomes  more  difficult.
       The  default  selection  in  the  overwrite  confirmation  dialog changes from <b>Yes</b> to <b>No</b>.  This option is
       disabled by default.

       <u>Auto</u> <u>save</u> <u>setup.</u>  If this option is enabled, when you exit Midnight Commander, the  configurable  options
       of Midnight Commander are saved in the <a href="file:~/.config/mc/ini">~/.config/mc/ini</a> file.

</pre><h4><b>Layout</b></h4><pre>
       The  layout  dialog  gives  you a possibility to change the general layout of screen. The options in this
       dialog are divided into several groups: "Panel split", "Console output" and "Other options".

       <b>Panel</b> <b>split</b>

       The rest of the screen area is used for the two directory panels. You can specify  whether  the  area  is
       split  to  the  panels  in  <u>Vertical</u>  or  <u>Horizontal</u>  direction.  Panel layout can be changed using Alt-,
       (Alt-comma) shortcut.

       <u>Equal</u> <u>split.</u>  By default, panels have equal sizes. Using this option you can specify an unequal split.

       <b>Console</b> <b>output</b>

       On the Linux or FreeBSD console you can specify how many lines are  shown  in  the  output  window.  This
       option is available if Midnight Commander runs on native console only.

       <b>Other</b> <b>options</b>

       <u>Menu</u> <u>bar</u> <u>visible.</u>  If enabled, main menu of Midnight Commander is always visible on the top row of screen
       above panels. Enabled by default.

       <u>Command</u> <u>prompt.</u>  If enabled, command line is available. Enabled by default.

       <u>Keybar</u>  <u>visible.</u>   If  enabled,  10  labels  associated with F1-F10 keys are located at the bottom row of
       screen. Enabled by default.

       <u>Hintbar</u> <u>visible.</u>  If enabled, the one-line hints are visible below panels. Enabled by default.

       <u>XTerm</u> <u>window</u> <u>title.</u>  When run in a terminal emulator for X11, Midnight Commander sets the terminal window
       title to the current working directory and updates it when  necessary.   If  your  terminal  emulator  is
       broken  and you see some incorrect output on startup and directory change, turn off this option.  Enabled
       by default.

       <u>Show</u> <u>free</u> <u>space.</u>  If enabled, free space and total space of current file system is shown  at  the  bottom
       frame of panel. Enabled by default.

</pre><h4><b>Panel</b> <b>options</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Main</b> <b>panel</b> <b>options</b>

       <u>Show</u>  <u>mini-status.</u>  If enabled, one line of status information about the currently selected item is shown
       at the bottom of the panels. Enabled by default.

       <u>Use</u> <u>SI</u> <u>size</u> <u>units.</u>  If this option is enabled, Midnight Commander will use SI  prefixes  (base  10)  when
       displaying any byte sizes. If disabled (default), Midnight Commander will use IEC prefixes (base 2).

       <u>Mix</u>  <u>all</u>  <u>files.</u>   If this option is enabled, all files and directories are shown mixed together.  If the
       option is disabled (default), directories (and links to directories) are shown at the  beginning  of  the
       listing, and other files below.

       <u>Show</u>  <u>backup</u> <u>files.</u>  If enabled, Midnight Commander will show files ending with a tilde.  Otherwise, they
       won't be shown (like GNU's ls option -B). Enabled by default.

       <u>Show</u> <u>hidden</u> <u>files.</u>  If enabled, Midnight Commander will show all files that start with  a  dot  (like  ls
       -a). Disabled by default.

       <u>Fast</u>  <u>directory</u>  <u>reload.</u>   If this option is enabled, Midnight Commander will use a trick to determine if
       the directory contents have changed.  The trick is to reload the directory only  if  the  i-node  of  the
       directory  has  changed;  this means that reloads only happen when files are created or deleted.  If what
       changes is the i-node for a file in the directory (file size changes, mode or  owner  changes,  etc)  the
       display  is  not  updated.   In  these cases, if you have the option on, you have to rescan the directory
       manually (with C-r). Disabled by default.

       <u>Mark</u> <u>moves</u> <u>down.</u>  If enabled, the selection bar will move down when you mark a file  (with  Insert  key).
       Enabled by default.

       <u>Reverse</u>  <u>files</u>  <u>only.</u>  Allow revert selection of files only. Enabled by default.  If enabled, the reverse
       selection is applied to files only, not to directories.  The selection of directories  is  untouched.  If
       off,  the  reverse  selection  is  applied  to  files as well to directories: all unselected items become
       selected, and vice versa.

       <u>Simple</u> <u>swap.</u>  If both panels contain file listing, simple swap means  that  panels  exchange  its  screen
       positions:  left panel become right one, and vice versa. If this option is unchecked, file listing panels
       exchange its content keeping listing format and sort options. Unchecked by default.

       <u>Auto</u> <u>save</u> <u>panels</u> <u>setup.</u>  If this option is  enabled,  when  you  exit  Midnight  Commander,  the  current
       settings of panels are saved in the <a href="file:~/.config/mc/panels.ini">~/.config/mc/panels.ini</a> file.  Disabled by default.

       <b>Navigation</b>

       <u>Lynx-like</u>  <u>motion.</u>   If this option is enabled, you may use the arrows keys to automatically chdir if the
       current selection is a subdirectory and the shell command line is empty. By default, this setting is off.

       <u>Page</u> <u>scrolling.</u>  If set (the default), panel will scroll by half the display when the cursor reaches  the
       end or the beginning of the panel, otherwise it will just scroll a file at a time.

       <u>Center</u> <u>scrolling.</u>  If set, panel will scroll when the cursor reaches the middle of the panel column, only
       hitting  the  top  or  bottom of the panel when actually on the first or last file. This behavior applies
       when scrolling one file at a time, and does not apply to the page up/down keys.

       <u>Mouse</u> <u>page</u> <u>scrolling.</u>  Controls whenever scrolling with the mouse wheel is done by pages or line by  line
       on the panels.

       <b>File</b> <b>highlight</b>

       You can specify whether <u>permissions</u> and <u>file</u> <u>types</u> should be highlighted with distinctive Colors.  If the
       permission highlighting is enabled, the parts of the <u>perm</u> and <u>mode</u> display fields which apply to the user
       running  Midnight  Commander are highlighted with the color defined by the <u>selected</u> keyword.  If the file
       type  highlighting  is  enabled,   file   names   are   colored   according   to   rules   described   in
       /etc/mc/filehighlight.ini file. See Filenames Highlight for more info.

       <b>Quick</b> <b>search</b>

       You can specify how the Quick search mode should work: case insensitively, case sensitively or be matched
       to the panel sort order: case sensitive or not.

</pre><h4><b>Confirmation</b></h4><pre>
       In  this dialog you configure the confirmation options for file deletion, overwriting files, execution by
       pressing enter, quitting the program, directory hotlist entries deletion and history cleanup.

</pre><h4><b>Appearance</b></h4><pre>
       In this dialog you can select the skin to be used and enable shadow for dialogs and drop down menus.

       See the Skins section for technical details about the skin definition files.

       <u>Shadows.</u>  If this option is enabled, all dialogs and drop down menus will have a shadow.

</pre><h4><b>Display</b> <b>bits</b></h4><pre>
       This is used to configure the range of visible characters on the screen.  This setting may be  7-bits  if
       your  terminal/curses  supports  only  seven  output  bits, ISO-8859-1 displays all the characters in the
       ISO-8859-1 map and full 8 bits is for those terminals that can display full 8 bit characters.

</pre><h4><b>Learn</b> <b>keys</b></h4><pre>
       This dialog allows you to test and redefine functional keys, cursor arrows and some other  keys  to  make
       them  work  properly on your terminal.  They often don't, since many terminal databases are incomplete or
       broken.

       You can move around with the Tab key and with the vi moving keys ('h' left, 'j'  down,  'k'  up  and  'l'
       right).  Once you press any cursor movement key and it is recognized, you can use that key as well.

       You  can test keys just by pressing each of them.  When you press a key and it is recognized properly, OK
       should appear next to the name of that key.  Once a key is marked OK it starts working as  usually,  e.g.
       F1  pressed  the first time will just check that the F1 key works, but after that it will show help.  The
       same applies to the arrow keys.  The Tab key should be working always.

       If some keys do not work properly then you won't see OK appear after pressing one of these.  Then you may
       want to redefine it.  Do it by pressing the button with the name of that key (either by the mouse  or  by
       Enter or Space after selecting the button with Tab or arrows).  Then a message box will appear asking you
       to  press  that  key.  Do it and wait until the message box disappears.  If you want to abort, just press
       Escape once and wait.

       When you finish with all the keys, you can Save them.  The definitions for the keys  you  have  redefined
       will be written into the [terminal:TERM] section of your <a href="file:~/.config/mc/ini">~/.config/mc/ini</a> file (where TERM is the name of
       your current terminal).  The definitions of the keys that were already working properly are not saved.

</pre><h4><b>Virtual</b> <b>FS</b></h4><pre>
       This option gives you control over the settings of the Virtual File System.

       Midnight  Commander  keeps in memory the information related to some of the virtual file systems to speed
       up the access to the files in the file system (for example, directory listings fetched from FTP servers).

       Also, in order to access the contents of compressed files (for example, compressed tar  files),  Midnight
       Commander needs to create temporary uncompressed files on your disk.

       Since  both  the information in memory and the temporary files on disk take up resources, you may want to
       tune the parameters of the cached information to decrease your resource usage or to maximize the speed of
       access to frequently used file systems.

       Because of the format of the tar archives, the <u>Tar</u> <u>filesystem</u> needs to read the whole file just  to  load
       the  file  entries.   Since  most  tar  files are usually kept compressed (plain tar files are species in
       extinction), the tar file system has to uncompress the file on the disk in a temporary location and  then
       access the uncompressed file as a regular tar file.

       Now, since we all love to browse files and tar files all over the disk, it's common that you will leave a
       tar  file  and  then  re-enter  it later.  Since decompression is slow, Midnight Commander will cache the
       information in memory for a limited time.  When the timeout expires, all the  resources  associated  with
       the file system are released.  The default timeout is set to one minute.

       The  FTP  File  System  (ftpfs)  allows  you to browse directories on remote FTP servers.  It has several
       options.

       <u>ftp</u> <u>anonymous</u> <u>password</u> is the password used when you login as "anonymous".  Some sites  require  a  valid
       e-mail address.  On the other hand, you probably don't want to give your real e-mail address to untrusted
       sites, especially if you are not using spam filtering.

       ftpfs  keeps  the  directory  listing  it fetches from a FTP server in a cache.  The cache expire time is
       configurable with the <u>ftpfs</u> <u>directory</u> <u>cache</u> <u>timeout</u> option.  A low value for this option  may  slow  down
       every operation on the ftpfs because every operation would require sending a request to the FTP server.

       You can define an FTP proxy host for doing FTP.  Note that most modern firewalls are fully transparent at
       least for passive FTP (see below), so FTP proxies are considered obsolete.

       If  <u>Always</u>  <u>use</u> <u>ftp</u> <u>proxy</u> is not set, you can use the exclamation sign to enable proxy for certain hosts.
       See FTP File System for examples.

       If this option is set, the program will do two things: consult the  /etc/mc/mc.no_proxy  file  for  lines
       containing  host  names that are local (if the host name starts with a dot, it is assumed to be a domain)
       and to assume that any hostnames without dots in their names are directly accessible.   All  other  hosts
       will be accessed through the specified FTP proxy.

       You can enable using <u><a href="file:~/.netrc">~/.netrc</a></u> file, which keeps login names and passwords for ftp servers.  See netrc (5)
       for the description of the .netrc format.

       <u>Use</u>  <u>passive</u>  <u>mode</u>  enables using FTP passive mode, when the connection for data transfer is initiated by
       the client, not by the server.  This option is recommended and enabled by default.   If  this  option  is
       turned off, the data connection is initiated by the server.  This may not work with some firewalls.

</pre><h4><b>Save</b> <b>Setup</b></h4><pre>
       At  startup,  Midnight Commander tries to load initialization information from the <a href="file:~/.config/mc/ini">~/.config/mc/ini</a> file.
       If this file doesn't exist, the system-wide file <b>/etc/mc/mc.ini</b> is used. If this file doesn't exist,  the
       system-wide file <b>/usr/share/mc/mc.ini</b> is used. If this file doesn't exist, MC uses the default settings.

       The  <u>Save</u>  <u>Setup</u>  command  creates  the <a href="file:~/.config/mc/ini">~/.config/mc/ini</a> file by saving the current settings of the Left,
       Right and Options menus.

       If you activate the <u>auto</u> <u>save</u> <u>setup</u> option, MC will always save the current settings when exiting.

       There also exist settings which can't be changed from the menus. To change these  settings  you  have  to
       edit the setup file with your favorite editor. See the section on Special Settings for more information.

</pre><h4><b>Executing</b> <b>operating</b> <b>system</b> <b>commands</b></h4><pre>
       You  may execute commands by typing them directly in Midnight Commander's input line, or by selecting the
       program you want to execute with the selection bar in one of the panels and hitting Enter.

       If you press Enter over a file that is not executable, Midnight Commander checks  the  extension  of  the
       selected  file  against  the  extensions  in  the  Extensions  File.   If  a match is found then the code
       associated with that extension is executed. A very simple macro expansion takes  place  before  executing
       the command.

</pre><h4><b>The</b> <b>cd</b> <b>internal</b> <b>command</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>cd</u> command is interpreted by Midnight Commander, it is not passed to the command shell for execution.
       Thus it may not handle all of the nice macro expansion and substitution that your shell does, although it
       does some of them:

       <u>Tilde</u> <u>substitution.</u>  The (~) will be substituted with your home directory, if you append a username after
       the tilde, then it will be substituted with the login directory of the specified user.

       For  example,  ~guest  is  the home directory for the user guest, while <a href="file:~/guest">~/guest</a> is the directory guest in
       your home directory.

       <u>Previous</u> <u>directory.</u>  You can jump to the directory you were previously by  using  the  special  directory
       name '-' like this: <b>cd</b> <b>-</b>

       <u>CDPATH</u>  <u>directories.</u>   If the directory specified to the <b>cd</b> command is not in the current directory, then
       Midnight Commander uses the value in the environment variable <b>CDPATH</b> to search for the directory  in  any
       of the named directories.

       For  example  you could set your <b>CDPATH</b> variable to <a href="file:~/src">~/src</a>:<a href="file:/usr/src">/usr/src</a>, allowing you to change your directory
       to any of the directories inside the <a href="file:~/src">~/src</a> and <a href="file:/usr/src">/usr/src</a> directories, from any place in the file system by
       using its relative name (for example cd linux could take you to /usr/src/linux).

</pre><h4><b>Macro</b> <b>Substitution</b></h4><pre>
       When accessing a user menu, or executing an extension dependent command, or running a  command  from  the
       command line input, a simple macro substitution takes place.

       The macros are:

       <u>%i</u>     The indent of blank space, equal the cursor column position.  For edit menu only.

       <u>%y</u>     The syntax type of current file. For edit menu only.

       <u>%k</u>     The block file name.

       <u>%e</u>     The error file name.

       <u>%m</u>     The current menu name.

       <u>%f</u> and <u>%p</u>
              In file manager user menu: the current file name in selected panel.  In mcedit user menu: the name
              of opened file.

       <u>%x</u>     The extension of current file name.

       <u>%b</u>     The current file name without extension.

       <u>%d</u>     The current directory name.

       <u>%F</u>     The current file in the unselected panel.

       <u>%D</u>     The directory name of the unselected panel.

       <u>%t</u>     The currently tagged files.

       <u>%T</u>     The tagged files in the unselected panel.

       <u>%u</u> and <u>%U</u>
              Similar  to  the %t and %T macros, but in addition the files are untagged.  You can use this macro
              only once per menu file entry or extension file entry, because next time there will be  no  tagged
              files.

       <u>%s</u> and <u>%S</u>
              The selected files: The tagged files if there are any. Otherwise the current file.

       <u>%cd</u>    This is a special macro that is used to change the current directory to the directory specified in
              front of it.  This is used primarily as an interface to the Virtual File System.

       <u>%view</u>  This  macro  is  used  to  invoke  the  internal  viewer.   This  macro can be used alone, or with
              arguments.  If you pass any arguments to this macro, they should be enclosed in brackets.

              The arguments are: <u>ascii</u> to force the viewer into ascii mode; <u>hex</u> to force  the  viewer  into  hex
              mode; <u>nroff</u> to tell the viewer that it should interpret the bold and underline sequences of nroff;
              <u>unformatted</u>  to  tell  the  viewer  to  not  interpret  nroff commands for making the text bold or
              underlined.

       <u>%%</u>     The % character

       <u>%{some</u> <u>text}</u>
              Prompt for the substitution. An input box is shown and the text inside the braces  is  used  as  a
              prompt.  The  macro is substituted by the text typed by the user. The user can press Esc or F10 to
              cancel. This macro doesn't work on the command line yet.

       <u>%var{ENV:default}</u>
              If environment variable <u>ENV</u> is unset, the <u>default</u> is substituted.  Otherwise, the value of <u>ENV</u>  is
              substituted.

</pre><h4><b>The</b> <b>subshell</b> <b>support</b></h4><pre>
       The  subshell  support  is  a  compile  time  option,  that works with the shells: bash, ash (BusyBox and
       Debian), (o/m)ksh, tcsh, zsh and fish.

       When the subshell support is active, Midnight Commander will spawn a concurrent copy of your  shell  (the
       one defined in the <b>SHELL</b> variable and if it is not defined, then the one in the <a href="file:/etc/passwd">/etc/passwd</a> file) and run
       it  in  a  pseudo  terminal, instead of invoking a new shell each time you execute a command, the command
       will be passed to the subshell as if you had typed it.  This also allows you to  change  the  environment
       variables, use shell functions and define aliases that are valid until you quit Midnight Commander.

       <b>bash</b>  users  may  specify  startup  commands in <a href="file:~/.local/share/mc/bashrc">~/.local/share/mc/bashrc</a> (fallback <a href="file:~/.bashrc">~/.bashrc</a>) and special
       keyboard maps in <a href="file:~/.local/share/mc/inputrc">~/.local/share/mc/inputrc</a> (fallback <a href="file:~/.inputrc">~/.inputrc</a>).

       <b>ash/dash</b> users (BusyBox or Debian) may specify  startup  commands  in  <a href="file:~/.local/share/mc/ashrc">~/.local/share/mc/ashrc</a>  (fallback
       <a href="file:~/.profile">~/.profile</a>).

       <b>ksh/oksh</b> users (PD ksh variants) may specify startup commands in <a href="file:~/.local/share/mc/kshrc">~/.local/share/mc/kshrc</a> (fallback <u>ENV</u> or
       <a href="file:~/.profile">~/.profile</a>).

       <b>mksh</b>  users  (MirBSD  ksh)  may  specify  startup  commands  in <a href="file:~/.local/share/mc/mkshrc">~/.local/share/mc/mkshrc</a> (fallback <u>ENV</u> or
       <a href="file:~/.mkshrc">~/.mkshrc</a>).

       <b>zsh</b> users may specify startup commands in <a href="file:~/.local/share/mc/.zshrc">~/.local/share/mc/.zshrc</a> (fallback <a href="file:~/.zshrc">~/.zshrc</a>).

       <b>tcsh,</b> <b>fish</b> users cannot specify mc-specific startup commands at present. They  have  to  rely  on  shell-
       specific startup files.

       The following paragraphs are relevant only when the subshell support is active:

       You  can  suspend  applications at any time with the sequence C-o and jump back to Midnight Commander, if
       you interrupt an application, you will not be able to run other external  commands  until  you  quit  the
       application you interrupted.

       The  basic prompt displayed by Midnight Commander is of the form "user@host:current_path$ ". When using a
       capable shell, like Bash, the prompt displayed by Midnight Commander will be the same prompt that you are
       currently using in your shell.

       (There's a known problem when using fish: the prompt is displayed only in full screen mode (Ctrl-o),  not
       when the panels are visible.)

       The  OPTIONS section has more information on how you can control subshell usage (-U/-u).  Furthermore, to
       set a specific subshell different from your current SHELL variable or login shell defined in <a href="file:/etc/passwd">/etc/passwd</a>,
       you may call MC like this: <b>SHELL=/bin/myshell</b> <b>mc</b>

</pre><h4><b>Chmod</b></h4><pre>
       The Chmod window is used to change the attribute bits in a group of files and  directories.   It  can  be
       invoked with the C-x c key combination.

       The Chmod window has two parts - <u>Permissions</u> and <u>File</u>.

       In the File section are displayed the name of the file or directory and its permissions in octal form, as
       well as its owner and group.

       In  the  Permissions section there is a set of check buttons which correspond to the file attribute bits.
       As you change the attribute bits, you can see the octal value change in the File section.

       To move between the widgets (buttons and check buttons) use the <u>arrow</u> <u>keys</u> or the <u>Tab</u> key.  To change the
       state of the check buttons or to select a button use <u>Space.</u>  You can also use the hotkeys on the  buttons
       to quickly activate them.  Hotkeys are shown as highlighted letters on the buttons.

       To set the attribute bits, use the Enter key.

       When  working  with a group of files or directories, you just click on the bits you want to set or clear.
       Once you have selected the bits you want to change, you select one of the action buttons (Set  marked  or
       Clear marked).

       Finally,  to  set the attributes exactly to those specified, you can use the <b>[Set</b> <b>all]</b> button, which will
       act on all the tagged files.

       <b>[Marked</b> <b>all]</b> set only marked attributes to all selected files

       <b>[Set</b> <b>marked]</b> set marked bits in attributes of all selected files

       <b>[Clean</b> <b>marked]</b> clear marked bits in attributes of all selected files

       <b>[Set]</b> set the attributes of one file

       <b>[Cancel]</b> cancel the Chmod command

</pre><h4><b>Chown</b></h4><pre>
       The Chown command is used to change the owner/group of a file. The hot key for this command is C-x o.

</pre><h4><b>Advanced</b> <b>Chown</b></h4><pre>
       The Advanced Chown command is the Chmod and Chown command combined into one window. You  can  change  the
       permissions and owner/group of files at once.

</pre><h4><b>Chattr</b></h4><pre>
       The  Chattr  window  is used to change the attributes of a group of files and directories on a Linux file
       system. It can be invoked with the C-x e key combination.

       Not all attributes are supported or utilized by all filesystems.  List of available  attribute  flags  is
       represented  as  a  set  of  check  buttons  which  correspond  to the attribute flags (see <b><a href="../man1/chattr.1.html">chattr</a>(1)</b> for
       details). As you change the attribute flags, you can see the symbolic value change below file name.

       To move between the widgets (buttons and check buttons) use the <u>arrow</u> <u>keys</u> or the <u>Tab</u> key. To change  the
       state of the check buttons or to select a button use <b>Space</b>.

       To set the attributes, use the Enter key.

       When  working with a group of files or directories, you just click on the flags you want to set or clear.
       Once you have selected the flags you want to change, you select one of the action buttons (Set marked  or
       Clear marked).

       Finally,  to  set the attributes exactly to those specified, you can use the <b>[Set</b> <b>all]</b> button, which will
       act on all the tagged files.

       <b>[Marked</b> <b>all]</b> set only marked attributes to all selected files.

       <b>[Set</b> <b>marked]</b> set marked flags in attributes of all selected files.

       <b>[Clean</b> <b>marked]</b> clear marked flags in attributes of all selected files.

       <b>[Set]</b> set the attributes of one file.

       <b>[Cancel]</b> cancel the Chattr command.

</pre><h4><b>File</b> <b>Operations</b></h4><pre>
       When you copy, move or delete files, Midnight Commander shows the file operations dialog.  It  shows  the
       files  currently  being  processed  and  uses  up to two progress bars.  The file bytes bar indicates the
       percentage of the current file that has been processed  so  far.   The  total  bytes  bar  indicates  the
       percentage  of  the  total size of the tagged files that has been handled. Counters that show how many of
       the tagged files have been handled are displayed. If the <u>Verbose</u> option is off, the file  bytes  bar  and
       total bytes bar are not shown.

       There are three buttons at the bottom of the dialog:

       <b>[Skip]</b> button to skip the rest of the current file.

       <b>[Suspend]</b>
              button  to  suspend  the file operation and button transforms to the <b>[Continue]</b> one which continue
              the suspended operation.

       <b>[Abort]</b>
              button to abort the whole operation, the rest of the files are skipped.

       There are three other dialogs which you can run into during the file operations.

       The error dialog informs about error conditions and has four choices:

       <b>[Ignore]</b>
              button to ignore this error.

       <b>[Ignore</b> <b>all]</b>
              button to ignore this and all future errors.

       <b>[Abort]</b>
              button to abort the operation altogether.

       <b>[Retry]</b>
              button to continue if you fixed the problem from another terminal.

       The replace dialog is shown when you attempt to copy or move a file on the top of an existing file.   The
       dialog shows the dates and sizes of the both files. There are the following buttons in this dialog:

       <b>[Yes]</b>  button to overwrite the file.

       <b>[No]</b>   button to skip the file.

       <b>[Append]</b>
              button to append the source file to the target one.

       <b>[Reget]</b>
              button  to append the rest of the source file to the target one.  This button is displayed only if
              the size of the target file is non-zero and less than the size of the source file.

       <b>[All]</b>  button to overwrite all the files.

       <b>[Older]</b>
              button to overwrite if the source file is newer than the target file.

       <b>[None]</b> button to never overwrite files

       <b>[Smaller]</b>
              button to overwrite if the source file size is less than the target one.

       <b>[Size</b> <b>differs]</b>
              button to overwrite files with different sizes.

       <b>[Abort]</b>
              button to abort the whole operation.

       If the <b>Don't</b> <b>overwrite</b> <b>with</b> <b>zero</b> <b>length</b> <b>file</b> checkbox is on, the zero-sized source files don't  overwrite
       the non-zero-sized target files.

       The recursive delete dialog is shown when you try to delete a directory which is not empty. There are the
       following buttons in this dialog:

       <b>[Yes]</b>  button to delete the directory recursively.

       <b>[No]</b>   button to skip the directory.

       <b>[All]</b>  button to delete all the directories.

       <b>[None]</b> button to skip all the non-empty directories.

       <b>[Abort]</b>
              button to abort the whole operation.

       If you have tagged files and perform an operation on them only the files on which the operation succeeded
       are untagged. Failed and skipped files are left tagged.

</pre><h4><b>Mask</b> <b>Copy/Rename</b></h4><pre>
       The  copy/move  operations  let  you  translate the names of files in an easy way.  To do it, you have to
       specify the correct source mask and usually  in  the  trailing  part  of  the  destination  specify  some
       wildcards.   All  the files matching the source mask are copied/renamed according to the target mask.  If
       there are tagged files, only the tagged files matching the source mask are renamed.

       There are other options which you can set:

       <b>Follow</b> <b>links</b>

       determines  whether  make  the  symlinks  and  hardlinks  in  the  source   directory   (recursively   in
       subdirectories) new links in the target directory or whether would you like to copy their content.

       <b>Dive</b> <b>into</b> <b>subdirs</b>

       determines the behavior when the source directory is about to be copied, but the target directory already
       exists.   The  default  action is to copy the contents of the source directory into the target directory.
       Enabling this option causes copying the source directory itself into the target directory.

       For example, you want to copy directory <u>/foo</u> containing  file  <u>bar</u>  to  <u>/bla/foo</u>,  which  is  an  already
       existing  directory.   Normally (when <b>Dive</b> <b>into</b> <b>subdirs</b> is not set), mc would copy file <u>/foo/bar</u> into the
       file <u>/bla/foo/bar</u>.  By enabling this option the <u>/bla/foo/foo</u> directory will be created, and <u>/foo/bar</u> will
       be copied into <u>/bla/foo/foo/bar</u>.

       <b>Preserve</b> <b>attributes</b>

       determines whether to preserve the permissions, timestamps and (if you are root)  the  ownership  of  the
       original files.  If this option is not set, the current value of the umask will be respected.

       <b>Use</b> <b>shell</b> <b>patterns</b>

       When  this  option is on you can use the '*' and '?' wildcards in the source mask. They work like they do
       in the shell. In the target mask only the '*'  and  '\&lt;digit&gt;'  wildcards  are  allowed.  The  first  '*'
       wildcard  in  the  target mask corresponds to the first wildcard group in the source mask, the second '*'
       corresponds to the second group and so on.  The '\1' wildcard corresponds to the first wildcard group  in
       the source mask, the '\2' wildcard corresponds to the second group and so on all the way up to '\9'.  The
       '\0' wildcard is the whole filename of the source file.

       Two examples:

       If  the  source  mask  is  "*.tar.gz",  the  destination  is  "/bla/*.tgz"  and  the file to be copied is
       "foo.tar.gz", the copy will be "foo.tgz" in "/bla".

       Suppose you want to swap basename and extension so that "file.c" would become "c.file" and  so  on.   The
       source mask for this is "*.*" and the destination is "\2.\1".

       <b>Use</b> <b>shell</b> <b>patterns</b> <b>off</b>

       When  the  shell  patterns  option  is  off  the  MC  doesn't do automatic grouping anymore. You must use
       '\(...\)' expressions in the source mask to specify meaning for the wildcards in the target mask. This is
       more flexible but also requires more typing. Otherwise target masks are similar to the situation when the
       shell patterns option is on.

       Two examples:

       If the source mask is "^\(.*\)\.tar\.gz$", the destination is "/bla/*.tgz" and the file to be  copied  is
       "foo.tar.gz", the copy will be "/bla/foo.tgz".

       Let's  suppose  you  want to swap basename and extension so that "file.c" will become "c.file" and so on.
       The source mask for this is "^\(.*\)\.\(.*\)$" and the destination is "\2.\1".

       <b>Case</b> <b>Conversions</b>

       You can also change the case of the filenames.  If you use '\u' or '\l' in  the  target  mask,  the  next
       character will be converted to uppercase or lowercase correspondingly.

       If  you  use  '\U'  or  '\L'  in  the  target mask, the next characters will be converted to uppercase or
       lowercase correspondingly up to the next '\E' or next '\U', '\L' or the end of the file name.

       The '\u' and '\l' are stronger than '\U' and '\L'.

       For example, if the source mask is '*' ( <u>Use</u> <u>shell</u> <u>patterns</u> on) or '^\(.*\)$' ( <u>Use</u> <u>shell</u>  <u>patterns</u>  off)
       and  the target mask is '\L\u*' the file names will be converted to have initial upper case and otherwise
       lower case.

       You can also use '\' as a quote character. For example, '\\' is a backslash and '\*' is an asterisk.

       <b>Stable</b> <b>symlinks</b>

       commands Midnight Commander, that it should change symlinks in the target, so that they'll point  to  the
       same  location  as  it  did  before.  With  absolute  symbolic links this does nothing, but if you have a
       relative one, it will recompute its value, adding necessary ../ and other directory parts and making  the
       value  as  short  as  possible  (most modern filesystems keep short symlinks inside inodes and thus don't
       waste much disk space).

</pre><h4><b>Select/Unselect</b> <b>Files</b></h4><pre>
       The dialog of group of files and directories selection or uselection.  The input  line  allow  enter  the
       regular expression of filenames that will be selected/unselected.

       When  <u>Files</u>  <u>only</u>  checkbox  is  on,  only  files  will  be  selected.  If <u>Files</u> <u>only</u> is off, as files as
       directories will be selected.  When <u>Shell</u> <u>Patterns</u> checkbox is on, the regular expression  is  much  like
       the  filename  globbing  in  the  shell  (*  standing for zero or more characters and ?  standing for one
       character). If <u>Shell</u> <u>Patterns</u> is off, then the tagging of files is done with normal  regular  expressions
       (see  ed  (1)).  When <u>Case</u> <u>sensitive</u> checkbox is on, the selection will be case sensitive characters.  If
       <u>Case</u> <u>sensitive</u> is off, the case will be ignored.

</pre><h4><b>Internal</b> <b>Diff</b> <b>Viewer</b></h4><pre>
       The mcdiff is a visual diff tool. You can compare two files and edit them  in-place  (diffs  are  updated
       dynamically).  You  can  browse  and  view  a  working  copy  from  popular version control systems (GIT,
       Subversion, etc).

       <b>C-Home</b> Move to the file beginning.

       <b>C-End,</b> <b>C1</b>
              Move to the file end.

</pre><h4><b>Internal</b> <b>File</b> <b>Viewer</b></h4><pre>
       The internal file viewer provides two display modes: ASCII and hex.  To toggle between modes, use the  F4
       key.

       The  viewer  will  try  to  use  the  best method provided by your system or the file type to display the
       information.  Some character sequences, which  appear  most  often  in  preformatted  manual  pages,  are
       displayed bold and underlined, thus making a pretty display of your files.

       When  in  hex  mode,  the search function accepts text in quotes and constant numbers.  Text in quotes is
       matched exactly after removing the quotes.  Each number matches one byte.  You can mix quoted  text  with
       constants like this:

       "String" 34 0xBB 012 "more text"

       Numbers are always interpreted in hex. In the example above, "34" is interpreted as 0x34. The prefix "0x"
       isn't  really  needed:  we could type "BB" instead of "0xBB". And "012" is interpreted as 0x12, not as an
       octal number.

       Here is a listing of the actions associated with each key that the  Midnight  Commander  handles  in  the
       internal file viewer.

       <b>F1</b>     Invoke the built-in hypertext help viewer.

       <b>F2</b>     Toggle the wrap mode.

       <b>F4</b>     Toggle the hex mode.

       <b>F5</b>     Goto.  You  can specify a line number, offset or percentage of file size of position that you want
              to view.

       <b>F7,</b> <b>/,</b> <b>?</b>
              Start search. These keys call the dialog window that allows you to set up the search  options.  If
              key is ? the "Backwards" option is on.

       <b>C-s</b>    Continue forward search.

       <b>C-r</b>    Continue reverse search.

       <b>F17,</b> <b>n</b> Continue search in the chosen direction.

       <b>N</b>      Temporary change the search direction: backwards if forward search is chosen, and vice versa.

       <b>F8</b>     Toggle  Raw/Parsed  mode:  This  will show the file as found on disk or if a processing filter has
              been specified in the mc.ext.ini file, then the output from the filter. Current mode is always the
              other than written on the button label, since on the button is the mode which you  enter  by  that
              key.

       <b>F9</b>     Toggle  the  format/unformat  mode:  when  format mode is on the viewer will interpret some string
              sequences to show bold and underline with different colors. Also, on button  label  is  the  other
              mode than current.

       <b>F10,</b> <b>Esc.</b>
              Exit the internal file viewer.

       <b>PageDown,</b> <b>space,</b> <b>C-v.</b>
              Scroll one page forward.

       <b>PageUp,</b> <b>Alt-v,</b> <b>C-b,</b> <b>Backspace.</b>
              Scroll one page backward.

       <b>Down</b>   Scroll one line forward.

       <b>Up</b>     Scroll one line backward.

       <b>C-l</b>    Refresh the screen.

       <b>C-o</b>    Switch to the subshell and show the command screen.

       <b>[n]</b> <b>m</b>  Set the mark n.

       <b>[n]</b> <b>r</b>  Jump to the mark n.

       <b>C-f</b>    Jump to the next file.

       <b>C-b</b>    Jump to the previous file.

       <b>Alt-r</b>  Toggle the ruler.

       <b>Alt-e</b>  to  change charset of displayed text may use Alt-e (M-e).  Recoding is made from selected codepage
              into system codepage. To cancel  the  recoding  you  may  select  "&lt;No  translation&gt;"  in  charset
              selection dialog.

       It's possible to instruct the file viewer how to display a file, look at the Edit Extension File section

</pre><h4><b>Internal</b> <b>File</b> <b>Editor</b></h4><pre>
       The  internal  file  editor is a full-featured full screen editor.  It can edit files up to 64 megabytes.
       It  is  possible  to  edit  binary  files.   The  internal  file  editor  is  invoked  using  <b>F4</b>  if  the
       <u>use_internal_edit</u> option is set in the initialization file.

       The features it presently supports are: block copy, move, delete, cut, paste; key for key undo; pull-down
       menus;  file  insertion; macro commands; regular expression search and replace; S-arrow text highlighting
       (if supported by the terminal); insert-overwrite toggle; word wrap; autoindent; tunable tab size;  syntax
       highlighting for various file types; and an option to pipe text blocks through shell commands like indent
       and ispell.

       Sections:

              Options of editor in ini-file

       The  editor  is  very  easy  to  use and requires no tutoring. To see what keys do what, just consult the
       appropriate pull-down menu. Other keys are: Shift movement keys do text highlighting.   <b>C-Ins</b>  copies  to
       the  file  <b>mcedit.clip</b>  and  <b>S-Ins</b> pastes from mcedit.clip.  <b>S-Del</b> cuts to <b>mcedit.clip</b>, and <b>C-Del</b> deletes
       highlighted text. Mouse highlighting also works, and you can override the mouse as usual by holding  down
       the shift key while dragging the mouse to let normal terminal mouse highlighting work.

       To  define  a macro, press <b>C-R</b> and then type out the key strokes you want to be executed. Press <b>C-R</b> again
       when finished. You can then assign the macro to any key you like by  pressing  that  key.  The  macro  is
       executed  when  you  press  <b>C-A</b>  and then the assigned key. The macro is also executed if you press Meta,
       Ctrl, or Esc and the assigned key, provided that the key  is  not  used  for  any  other  function.  Once
       defined,  the  macro  commands  go  into the file <b><a href="file:~/.local/share/mc/mcedit/mcedit.macros">~/.local/share/mc/mcedit/mcedit.macros</a></b> You can delete a
       macro by deleting the appropriate line in this file.

       To change charset of displayed text may use Alt-e (M-e).  Recoding is made from  selected  codepage  into
       system codepage. To cancel the recoding you may select "&lt;No translation&gt;" in charset selection dialog.

       <b>F19</b>  will  format  the  currently  highlighted  block  (plain  text or C or C++ code or another). This is
       controlled     by     the     file     <b>/usr/share/mc/edit.indent.rc</b>     which      is      copied      to
       <b><a href="file:~/.local/share/mc/mcedit/edit.indent.rc">~/.local/share/mc/mcedit/edit.indent.rc</a></b> in your home directory the first time you use it.

       The editor also displays non-us characters (160+). When editing binary files, you should set <b>display</b> <b>bits</b>
       to 7 bits in the options menu to keep the spacing clean.

</pre><h4><b>Options</b> <b>of</b> <b>editor</b> <b>in</b> <b>ini-file</b></h4><pre>
       Some   editor   options   of   ini-file   are   described   in  this  section.   Options  are  placed  in
       [Midnight-Commander] section

       <u>editor_wordcompletion_collect_entire_file</u>
              Search autocomplete candidates in entire of file or just from begin of file to cursor position (0)

</pre><h4><b>Screen</b> <b>selector</b></h4><pre>
       Midnight Commander supports running many internal modules  (such  as  editor,  viewer  and  diff  viewer)
       simultaneously  and  switching  between them without closing open files. Using several file managers at a
       time, however, is not currently supported.

       Let's call each of these modules a screen. There are three ways to switch between screens, using  one  of
       these global shortcuts:

       <b>Alt-}</b>  switch to the next screen;

       <b>Alt-{</b>  switch to the previous screen;

       <b>Alt-`</b>  open a dialog window with the list of currently open screens (or use the "Screen list" menu item).

</pre><h4><b>Completion</b></h4><pre>
       Let Midnight Commander type for you.

       Attempt  to  perform completion on the text before current position.  MC attempts completion treating the
       text as variable (if the text begins with <b>$</b>), username (if the text begins with <b>~</b>), hostname (if the text
       begins with <b>@</b>) or command (if you are on the command line in the position where you might type a command,
       possible completions then include shell reserved words and shell built-in commands as well) in turn.   If
       none of these matches, filename completion is attempted.

       Filename,  username,  variable  and  hostname  completion works on all input lines, command completion is
       command line specific.  If the completion is ambiguous (there are more different possibilities), MC beeps
       and the following action depends on the setting of the Complete: show all  option  in  the  Configuration
       dialog.   If  it is enabled, a list of all possibilities pops up next to the current position and you can
       select with the arrow keys and <b>Enter</b> the correct entry.  You can also type the first letters in which the
       possibilities differ to move to a subset of all possibilities and complete as much as possible.   If  you
       press <b>Alt-Tab</b> again, only the subset will be shown in the listbox, otherwise the first item which matches
       all  the  previous  characters will be highlighted.  As soon as there is no ambiguity, dialog disappears,
       but you can hide it by canceling keys <b>Esc</b>, <b>F10</b> and left and right arrow keys. If Complete:  show  all  is
       disabled,  the  dialog  pops up only if you press <b>Alt-Tab</b> for the second time, for the first time MC just
       beeps.

       Apply escaping of <b>?</b>, <b>*</b>, and <b>&amp;</b> symbols (as  <b>\?</b>,  <b>\*</b>,  and  <b>\&amp;</b>)  in  filenames  to  disallow  use  them  as
       metasymbols in regular expressions when substitution is performed in the input line.

</pre><h4><b>Virtual</b> <b>File</b> <b>System</b></h4><pre>
       Midnight  Commander  is provided with a code layer to access the file system; this code layer is known as
       the virtual file system switch.  The virtual file system switch allows Midnight Commander  to  manipulate
       files not located on the Unix file system.

       Currently,  Midnight  Commander  is packaged with some Virtual File Systems (VFS): the <u>local</u> file system,
       used for accessing the regular Unix file system; the <u>ftpfs</u>, used to manipulate files  on  remote  systems
       with  the  FTP protocol; the <u>tarfs</u>, used to manipulate tar and compressed tar files; the <u>undelfs</u>, used to
       recover deleted files on ext2 file systems (the default  file  system  for  Linux  systems),  <u>shell</u>  (for
       manipulating  files  over  shell  connections such as rsh and ssh).  If the code was compiled with <u>sftpfs</u>
       (for manipulating files over SFTP connections).

       A generic <u>extfs</u> (EXTernal virtual File System) is provided in order to  easily  expand  VFS  capabilities
       using scripts and external software.

       The  VFS  switch code will interpret all of the path names used and will forward them to the correct file
       system, the formats used for each one of the file systems is described later in their own section.

</pre><h4><b>FTP</b> <b>File</b> <b>System</b></h4><pre>
       The FTP File System (ftpfs) allows you to manipulate files on remote machines.  To actually use  it,  you
       can use the <u>FTP</u> <u>link</u> item in the menu or directly change your current directory using the <u>cd</u> command to a
       path name that looks like this:

       <u>ftp://[!][user[:pass]@]machine[:port]/[remote-dir]</u>

       The <u>user</u>, <u>port</u> and <u>remote-dir</u> elements are optional.  If you specify the <u>user</u> element, Midnight Commander
       will  login  to  the remote machine as that user, otherwise it will use anonymous login or the login name
       from the <u><a href="file:~/.netrc">~/.netrc</a></u> file.  The optional <u>pass</u> element is the password used for the  connection.   Using  the
       password  in the VFS directory name is not recommended, because it can appear on the screen in clear text
       and can be saved to the directory history.

       To enable using FTP proxy, prepend <b>!</b>  (an exclamation sign) to the hostname.

       Examples:

           <a href="ftp://ftp.nuclecu.unam.mx/linux/local">ftp://ftp.nuclecu.unam.mx/linux/local</a>
           <a href="ftp://tsx-11.mit.edu/pub/linux/packages">ftp://tsx-11.mit.edu/pub/linux/packages</a>
           ftp://!behind.firewall.edu/pub
           <a href="ftp://guest">ftp://guest</a>@remote-host.com:40/pub
           <a href="ftp://miguel">ftp://miguel</a>:xxx@server/pub

       Please check the Virtual File System dialog box for ftpfs options.

</pre><h4><b>Tar</b> <b>File</b> <b>System</b></h4><pre>
       The tar file system provides you with read-only access to your tar files  and  compressed  tar  files  by
       using  the  chdir  command.  To change your directory to a tar file, you change your current directory to
       the tar file by using the following syntax:

       <u>/filename.tar/utar://[dir-inside-tar]</u>

       The mc.ext.ini file already provides a shortcut for tar files, this means that usually you just point  to
       a  tar  file and press return to enter into the tar file, see the Edit Extension File section for details
       on how this is done.

       Examples:

           mc-3.0.tar.gz/utar://mc-3.0/vfs
           /ftp/GCC/gcc-2.7.0.tar/utar://

       The latter specifies the full path of the tar archive.

</pre><h4><b>FIle</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>over</b> <b>SHell</b> <b>filesystem</b></h4><pre>
       The shell file system is a network based file system that allows you to manipulate the files in a  remote
       machine as if they were local. To use this, the other side has to have bash-compatible shell.

       To  connect  to  a  remote  machine, you just need to chdir into a special directory which name is in the
       following format:

       <u>sh://[user@]machine[:options]/[remote-dir]</u>

       The <u>user,</u> <u>options</u> and <u>remote-dir</u> elements are optional.   If  you  specify  the  <u>user</u>  element,  Midnight
       Commander will try to login on the remote machine as that user, otherwise it will use your login name.

       The available <u>options</u> are:
         'C' - use compression;
         'r' - use rsh instead of ssh;
         port - specify the port used by remote server.
       If  the  <u>remote-dir</u>  element is present, your current directory on the remote machine will be set to this
       one.

       Examples:

           sh://onlyrsh.mx:r/linux/local
           sh://<a href="mailto:joe@want.compression.edu">joe@want.compression.edu</a>:C/private
           sh://<a href="mailto:joe@noncompressed.ssh.edu">joe@noncompressed.ssh.edu</a>/private
           sh://<a href="mailto:joe@somehost.ssh.edu">joe@somehost.ssh.edu</a>:2222/private

</pre><h4><b>SFTP</b> <b>(SSH</b> <b>File</b> <b>Transfer</b> <b>Protocol)</b> <b>filesystem</b></h4><pre>
       The SFTP file system is a network based file system that allows you to manipulate the files in  a  remote
       machine as if they were local.

       To  connect  to  a  remote  machine, you just need to chdir into a special directory which name is in the
       following format:

       <u>sftp://[user@]machine:[port]/[remote-dir]</u>

       The <u>user,</u> <u>port</u> and <u>remote-dir</u> elements are optional.  If you specify the <u>user</u> element, Midnight Commander
       will try to login on the remote machine as that user, otherwise it will use  your  login  name.   <u>port</u>  -
       specify  the  port  used  by  remote  server (22 by default).  If the <u>remote-dir</u> element is present, your
       current directory on the remote machine will be set to this one.

       Examples:

           s<a href="ftp://onlyrsh.mx/linux/local">ftp://onlyrsh.mx/linux/local</a>
           s<a href="ftp://joe">ftp://joe</a>:<a href="mailto:password@want.compression.edu">password@want.compression.edu</a>/private
           s<a href="ftp://joe">ftp://joe</a>@noncompressed.ssh.edu/private
           s<a href="ftp://joe">ftp://joe</a>@somehost.ssh.edu:2222/private

       When establishing the connection, server key fingerprint is verified using the  <a href="file:~/.ssh/known_hosts">~/.ssh/known_hosts</a>  file.
       If the host/key pair is not found or the host is found, but the key doesn't match, an appropriate message
       is shown.  There are three buttons in the message dialog:

       <b>[Yes]</b> add new host/key pair to the <a href="file:~/.ssh/known_hosts">~/.ssh/known_hosts</a> file and continue.

       <b>[Ignore]</b>  do  not add new host/key pair to the <a href="file:~/.ssh/known_hosts">~/.ssh/known_hosts</a> file, but continue nevertheless (at you
       own risk).

       <b>[No]</b> abort connection.

</pre><h4><b>Undelete</b> <b>File</b> <b>System</b></h4><pre>
       On Linux systems, if you asked configure to use  the  ext2fs  undelete  facilities,  you  will  have  the
       undelete  file  system available.  Recovery of deleted files is only available on ext2 file systems.  The
       undelete file system is just an interface to the ext2fs library to retrieve  all  of  the  deleted  files
       names on an ext2fs and provides and to extract the selected files into a regular partition.

       To use this file system, you have to chdir into the special file name formed by the "undel://" prefix and
       the file name where the actual file system resides.

       For  example, to recover deleted files on the second partition of the first SCSI disk on Linux, you would
       use the following path name:

           undel://sda2

       It may take a while for the undelfs to load the required information  before  you  start  browsing  files
       there.

</pre><h4><b>EXTernal</b> <b>File</b> <b>System</b></h4><pre>
       <b>extfs</b>  allows  you  to  integrate numerous features and file types into GNU Midnight Commander in an easy
       way, by writing scripts.

       Extfs filesystems can be divided into two categories:

       1. Stand-alone filesystems, which are not associated with any  existing  file.   They  represent  certain
       system-wide  data  as  a  directory  tree.  You can invoke them by typing <u>cd</u> <u>fsname://</u> where fsname is an
       extfs short name (see below).  Examples of such filesystems include audio (list audio tracks on  the  CD)
       or apt (list of all Debian packages in the system).

       For example, to list CD-Audio tracks on your CD-ROM drive, type

         cd audio://

       2.  'Archive' filesystems (like rpm, patchfs and more), which represent contents of a file as a directory
       tree.  It can consist of 'real' files compressed in  an  archive  (urar,  rpm)  or  virtual  files,  like
       messages  in  a  mailbox  (mailfs)  or  parts of a patch (patchfs).  To access such filesystems <u>fsname://</u>
       should be appended to the archive name.  Note that the archive itself can be on another vfs.

       For example, to list contents of a zip archive documents.zip type

         cd documents.zip/uzip://

       In many aspects, you could treat extfs like any other directory.  For instance, you can  add  it  to  the
       hotlist  or change to it from directory history.  An important limitation is that you cannot invoke shell
       commands inside extfs, just like any other non-local VFS.

       Common extfs scripts included with Midnight Commander are:

       <b>a</b>      access 'A:' DOS/Windows diskette (<u>cd</u> <u>a://</u>).

       <b>apt</b>    front end to Debian's APT package management system (<u>cd</u> <u>apt://</u>).

       <b>audio</b>  audio CD ripping and playing (<u>cd</u> <u>audio://</u> or <u>cd</u> <u>device/audio://</u>).

       <b>bpp</b>    package of Bad Penguin GNU/Linux distribution (<u>cd</u> <u>file.bpp/bpp://</u>).

       <b>deb</b>    package of Debian GNU/Linux distribution (<u>cd</u> <u>file.deb/deb://</u>).

       <b>dpkg</b>   Debian GNU/Linux installed packages (<u>cd</u> <u>deb://</u>).

       <b>hp48</b>   view and copy files to/from a HP48 calculator (<u>cd</u> <u>hp48://</u>).

       <b>lslR</b>   browsing of lslR listings as found on many FTPs (<u>cd</u> <u>filename/lslR://</u>).

       <b>mailfs</b> mbox-style mailbox files support (<u>cd</u> <u>mailbox/mailfs://</u>).

       <b>patchfs</b>
              extfs to handle unified and context diffs (<u>cd</u> <u>filename/patchfs://</u>).

       <b>rpm</b>    RPM package (<u>cd</u> <u>filename/rpm://</u>).

       <b>rpms</b>   RPM database management (<u>cd</u> <u>rpms://</u>).

       <b>ulha,</b> <b>urar,</b> <b>uzip,</b> <b>uzoo,</b> <b>uar,</b> <b>uha</b>
              archivers (<u>cd</u> <u>archive/xxxx://</u> where xxxx is one of: <u>ulha</u>, <u>urar</u>, <u>uzip</u>, <u>uzoo</u>, <u>uar</u>, <u>uha</u>).

       You could bind file type/extension to specified extfs as described in the Edit  Extension  File  section.
       Here is an example entry for Debian packages:

         regex/.deb$
                 Open=%cd %p/deb://

</pre><h4><b>Colors</b></h4><pre>
       Midnight  Commander  will  try  to detect if your terminal supports color using the terminal database and
       your terminal name.  Sometimes it gets confused, so you may force color mode or disable color mode  using
       the -c and -b flag respectively.

       If  the  program  is  compiled  with the S-Lang screen manager instead of ncurses, it will also check the
       variable <b>COLORTERM,</b> if it is set, it has the same effect as the -c flag.

       You may specify terminals that always force color mode by adding  the  <u>color_terminals</u>  variable  to  the
       Colors section of the initialization file.  This will prevent Midnight Commander from trying to detect if
       your terminal supports color.  Example:

       [Colors]
       color_terminals=linux,xterm
       color_terminals=terminal-name1,terminal-name2...

       The  program  can be compiled with both ncurses and S-Lang, ncurses does not provide a way to force color
       mode: ncurses uses just the information in the terminal database.

       Midnight Commander provides a way to change the default colors.   Currently  the  colors  are  configured
       using the environment variable <b>MC_COLOR_TABLE</b> or the Colors section in the initialization file.

       In  the Colors section, the default color map is loaded from the <u>base_color</u> variable.  You can specify an
       alternate color map for a terminal by using the terminal name as the key in this section.  Example:

       [Colors]
       base_color=
       xterm=menu=magenta:marked=,magenta:markselect=,red

       The format for the color definition is:

         &lt;keyword&gt;=&lt;fgcolor&gt;,&lt;bgcolor&gt;,&lt;attributes&gt;:&lt;keyword&gt;=...

       The colors are optional, and the keywords are: normal, selected, disabled,  marked,  markselect,  errors,
       input,  inputmark, inputunchanged, commandlinemark, reverse, gauge, header, inputhistory, commandhistory.
       Button bar colors are: bbarhotkey, bbarbutton. Status bar color: statusbar. Menu colors are:  menunormal,
       menusel,  menuhot,  menuhotsel,  menuinactive. Dialog colors are: dnormal, dfocus, dhotnormal, dhotfocus,
       dtitle. Error dialog colors are: errdfocus, errdhotnormal, errdhotfocus,  errdtitle.   Help  colors  are:
       helpnormal,  helpitalic,  helpbold,  helplink,  helpslink,  helptitle.   Viewer  colors  are: viewnormal,
       viewbold,  viewunderline,  viewselected.   Editor   colors   are:   editnormal,   editbold,   editmarked,
       editwhitespace,   editnonprintable,   editlinestate.   Popup  menu  colors  are:  pmenunormal,  pmenusel,
       pmenutitle.

       <u>header</u> determines the color of panel  header,  the  line  that  contains  column  titles  and  sort  mode
       indicator.

       <u>input</u> determines the color of input lines used in query dialogs.

       <u>gauge</u> determines the color of the filled part of the progress bar (gauge), which is used to show the user
       the progress of file operations, such as copying.

       <u>disabled</u> determines the color of the widget that cannot be selected.

       The  dialog boxes use the following colors: <u>dnormal</u> is used for the normal text, <u>dfocus</u> is the color used
       for the currently selected component, <u>dhotnormal</u> is the color used to differentiate the hotkey  color  in
       normal  components,  whereas  the  <u>dhotfocus</u>  color  is  used  for the highlighted color in the currently
       selected component.

       Menus use the same scheme but uses the menunormal, menusel, menuhot,  menuhotsel  and  menuinactive  tags
       instead.

       Help  uses the following colors: <u>helpnormal</u> is used for normal text, <u>helpitalic</u> is used for text which is
       emphasized in italic in the manual page, <u>helpbold</u> is used for text which is emphasized  in  bold  in  the
       manual page, <u>helplink</u> is used for not selected hyperlinks and <u>helpslink</u> is used for selected hyperlink.

       Popup  menu uses following colors: <u>pmenunormal</u> is used for non-selected menu items and as a main color of
       popup menu window, <u>pmenusel</u> is used for selected menu item, <u>pmenutitle</u> is used for popup menu title.

       The possible  colors  are:  black,  gray,  red,  brightred,  green,  brightgreen,  brown,  yellow,  blue,
       brightblue, magenta, brightmagenta, cyan, brightcyan, lightgray and white. And there is a special keyword
       for transparent background. It is 'default'. The 'default' can only be used for background color. Another
       special  keyword  "base"  means  mc's  main colors.  When 256 colors are available, they can be specified
       either as color16 to color255, or as rgb000 to rgb555 and gray0 to gray23. Example:

       [Colors]
       base_color=normal=white,default:marked=magenta,default

       Attributes can be any of bold, italic, underline, reverse and blink, appended by a plus sign if more than
       one are desired.  The special word "none" means  no  attributes,  without  attempting  to  fall  back  to
       base_color.  Example:

       menuhotsel=yellow;black;bold+underline

</pre><h4><b>Skins</b></h4><pre>
       You  can  change  the appearance of Midnight Commander.  To do this, you must specify a file that contain
       descriptions of colors and lines to draw boxes. Redefining of the colors is entirely compatible with  the
       assignment of colors, as described in Section Colors.

       If  your  skin  contains  any  true-color definitions, you should define the 'truecolors' key set to TRUE
       value in [skin] section. If true-color is not used  but  256-color  is,  you  should  define  '256colors'
       instead.

       A skin-file is searched on the following algorithm (to the first one found):

              1) command line option <b>-S</b> <b>&lt;skin&gt;</b> or <b>--skin=&lt;skin&gt;</b>
              2) Environment variable <b>MC_SKIN</b>
              3) Parameter <b>skin</b> in section <b>[Midnight-Commander]</b> in config file.
              4) File <b>/etc/mc/skins/default.ini</b>
              5) File <b>/usr/share/mc/skins/default.ini</b>

       Command  line  option, environment variable and parameter in config file may contain the absolute path to
       the skin-file (with the extension .ini or without it). Search of skin-file will occur in  (to  the  first
       one found):

              1) <b><a href="file:~/.local/share/mc/skins/">~/.local/share/mc/skins/</a></b>
              2) <b>/etc/mc/skins/</b>
              3) <b>/usr/share/mc/skins/</b>

       Possible colors (names) and attributes are described in Colors.  section.

</pre><h4><b>Color</b> <b>and</b> <b>attribute</b> <b>aliases</b></h4><pre>
       This  optional section might define aliases for single colors (not color pairs) as well as combination of
       attributes; in other words, for semicolon-separated fragments of parameters. Aliases can refer  to  other
       aliases as long as they don't form a loop.

       Example:
       [aliases]
           myfavfg=green
           myfavbg=black
           myfavattr=bold+italic

</pre><h4><b>Draw</b> <b>lines</b></h4><pre>
       Lines  sets  in section <b>[Lines]</b> into skin-file. By default single lines are used, but you may redefine to
       usage of any utf-8 symbols (like to lines, for example).

       <u>WARNING!!!</u>  When you build Midnight Commander with the ncurses screen library usage of drawing  lines  is
       limited!   Possible  only  drawing  a  single  lines.   For all questions and comments please contact the
       developers of ncurses.

       Descriptions of parameters <b>[Lines]</b>:

       <u>lefttop</u>
              left-top line fragment.

       <u>righttop</u>
              right-top line fragment.

       <u>centertop</u>

</pre><h4><b>Compatibility</b></h4><pre>
       Appointment of color  by skin-files fully compatible with the appointment  of  the  colors  described  in
       Colors.  section.

       In this case, reassignment of colors has priority over the skin file and is complementary.

</pre><h4><b>Filenames</b> <b>Highlight</b></h4><pre>
       Section  [filehighlight]  in current skin-file contains key names as highlight groups and values as color
       pairs. Color pairs is documented in Skins section.

       Rules    of    filenames    highlight    are    placed    in     /usr/share/mc/filehighlight.ini     file
       (<a href="file:~/.config/mc/filehighlight.ini">~/.config/mc/filehighlight.ini</a>).   Name  of  section  in  this file must be equal to parameters names in
       [filehighlight] section (in current skin-file).

       Keys in these groups are:

       <u>type</u>   file type. If present, all other options are ignored.

       <u>regexp</u> regular expression. If present, 'extensions' option is ignored.

       <u>extensions</u>
              list of extensions of files. Separated by ';' sign.

       <u>extensions_case</u>
              (make sense only with 'extensions' parameter) make 'extensions' rule case sensitive (true) or  not
              (false).

       `type' key may have values:
       - FILE (all files)
         - FILE_EXE
       - DIR (all directories)
         - LINK_DIR
       - LINK (all links except stale link)
         - HARDLINK
         - SYMLINK
       - STALE_LINK
       - DEVICE (all device files)
         - DEVICE_BLOCK
         - DEVICE_CHAR
       - SPECIAL (all special files)
         - SPECIAL_SOCKET
         - SPECIAL_FIFO
         - SPECIAL_DOOR

</pre><h4><b>Special</b> <b>Settings</b></h4><pre>
       Most  of  Midnight Commander settings can be changed from the menus. However, there are a small number of
       settings which can only be changed by editing the setup file.

       These variables may be set in your <a href="file:~/.config/mc/ini">~/.config/mc/ini</a> file:

       <u>clear_before_exec</u>
              By default, Midnight Commander clears the screen before executing a command.  If you would  prefer
              to  see the output of the command at the bottom of the screen, edit your <a href="file:~/.config/mc/ini">~/.config/mc/ini</a> file and
              change the value of the field clear_before_exec to 0.

       <u>confirm_view_dir</u>
              If you press F3 on a directory, normally MC enters that directory.  If this flag is set to 1, then
              MC will ask for confirmation before changing the directory if you have files tagged.

       <u>ftpfs_retry_seconds</u>
              This value is the number of seconds Midnight Commander will wait before attempting to reconnect to
              an FTP server that has denied the login.  If the value is zero, the login will no be retried.

       <u>max_dirt_limit</u>
              Specifies how many screen updates can be skipped at most in the internal  file  viewer.   Normally
              this  value  is  not  significant, because the code automatically adjusts the number of updates to
              skip according to the rate of incoming keystrokes.  However, on very slow  machines  or  terminals
              with a fast keyboard auto repeat, a big value can make screen updates too jumpy.

              It  seems  that  setting  max_dirt_limit  to  10 causes the best behavior, and that is the default
              value.

       <u>mouse_move_pages_viewer</u>
              Controls if scrolling with the mouse is done by pages or line by line on the internal file viewer.

       <u>only_leading_plus_minus</u>
              Allow special treatment for  '+',  '-',  '*'  in  the  command  line  (select,  unselect,  reverse
              selection)  only  if  the  command line is empty.  You don't need to quote those characters in the
              middle of the command line.  On the other hand, you cannot use them to change selection  when  the
              command line is not empty.

       <u>alternate_plus_minus</u>
              If  true,  use  '+', '-', '\' and '*' keys normally. For select/unselect, use 'Alt-+', 'Alt--' and
              'Alt-*'.

       <u>show_output_starts_shell</u>
              This variable only works if you are not  using  the  subshell  support.   When  you  use  the  C-o
              keystroke  to  go  back  to  the  user  screen,  if  this  one is set, you will get a fresh shell.
              Otherwise, pressing any key will bring you back to Midnight Commander.

       <u>timeformat_recent</u>
              Change the time format used to display dates less than 6 months from now.  See  strftime  or  date
              man page for the format specification. If this option is absent, default timeformat is used.

       <u>timeformat_old</u>
              Change  the  time  format  used to display  dates older than 6 months from now or for dates in the
              future.  See strftime or date man page for the format specification. If  this  option  is  absent,
              default timeformat is used.

       <u>torben_fj_mode</u>
              If  this  flag  is  set,  then  the  home and end keys will work slightly different on the panels,
              instead of moving the selection to the first and last files  in  the  panels,  they  will  act  as
              follows:

              The  home  key  will:  Go up to the middle line, if below it; else go to the top line unless it is
              already on the top line, in this case it will go to the first file in the panel.

              The end key has a similar behavior: Go down to the middle line, if over it; else go to the  bottom
              line  unless  you  already  are at the bottom line, in such case it will move the selection to the
              last file name in the panel.

       <u>use_file_to_guess_type</u>
              If this variable is on (the default) it will spawn the file command to match the file types listed
              on the mc.ext.ini file.

       <u>xtree_mode</u>
              If this variable is on (default is off) when you browse the file system on a Tree panel,  it  will
              automatically reload the other panel with the contents of the selected directory.

       <u>shell_directory_timeout</u>
              This  variable  holds the lifetime of a directory cache entry in seconds. The default value is 900
              seconds.

       <u>clipboard_store</u>
              This variable contains path (with options) to the external clipboard utility like 'xclip' to  read
              text into X selection from file.  For example:

       clipboard_store=xclip -i

       <u>clipboard_paste</u>
              This variable contains path (with options) to the external clipboard utility like 'xclip' to print
              the selection to standard out.  For example:

       clipboard_paste=xclip -o

       <u>autodetect_codeset</u>
              This  option  allows use the `enca' command to autodetect codeset of text files in internal viewer
              and editor. List of valid values can be obtain by the `enca --list  languages  |  cut  -d  :  -f1'
              command. Option must be located in the [Misc] section.

       For example:

       autodetect_codeset=russian

</pre><h4><b>Parameters</b> <b>for</b> <b>external</b> <b>editor</b> <b>or</b> <b>viewer</b></h4><pre>
       Midnight  Commander  provides  a  way  for  specify an options for external editors and viewers. Midnight
       Commander  tries  to  search  the  "[External  editor  or  viewer  parameters]"  section  in  the  system
       initialization  file  (the mc.lib file located in Midnight Commander's library directory) and then in the
       <a href="file:~/.config/mc/ini">~/.config/mc/ini</a> file. The option name should be equal to the name (full pathname) of external editor  or
       viewer. The option value can contain following variables:

       <u>%filename</u>
              The filename to edit/view.

       <u>%lineno</u>
              The start line in the opening file.

       For example:

       [External editor or viewer parameters]
           vi=%filename +%lineno
           joe=%filename +%lineno
           more=%filename +%lineno

       Start  line  is  passed  to  the  external  editor/viewer only if it is called from the Find file results
       window.

       If external editor/viewer is launched via F4/F3 keys, MC hopes that program (at least "joe", but probably
       others too) has an own feature that by default opens the file where it was last open. MC doesn't  prevent
       external editor/viewer to save and restore position in opened files.

</pre><h4><b>Terminal</b> <b>databases</b></h4><pre>
       Midnight Commander provides a way to fix your system terminal database without requiring root privileges.
       Midnight  Commander  searches  in  the  system  initialization  file (the mc.lib file located in Midnight
       Commander's   library   directory)   and   in    the    <a href="file:~/.config/mc/ini">~/.config/mc/ini</a>    file    for    the    section
       "terminal:your-terminal-name"  and  then  for  the  section  "terminal:general", each line of the section
       contains a key symbol that you want to define, followed by an equal sign and the definition for the  key.
       You  can  use the special \e form to represent the escape character and the ^x to represent the control-x
       character.

       The possible key symbols are:

       f0 to f20     Function keys f0-f20
       bs            backspace
       home          home key
       end           end key
       up            up arrow key
       down          down arrow key
       left          left arrow key
       right         right arrow key
       pgdn          page down key
       pgup          page up key
       insert        the insert character
       delete        the delete character
       complete      to do completion

       For example, to define the key insert to be the Escape + [ + O + p, you set this in the ini file:

       insert=\e[Op

       Also now you can use <u>extended</u> <u>learn</u> <u>keys.</u>  For example:

           ctrl-alt-right=\e[[1;6C
           ctrl-alt-left=\e[[1;6D

       This means that  ctrl+alt+left  sends  a  \e[[1;6D  escape  sequence  and  therefore  Midnight  Commander
       interprets "\e[[1;6D" as C-Alt-Left.

       The  <u>complete</u>  key  symbol represents the escape sequences used to invoke the completion process, this is
       invoked with Alt-tab, but you can define other keys to do the same work (on those keyboard with  tons  of
       nice and unused keys everywhere).

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       Full  paths  below  may vary between installations.  They are also affected by the <b>MC_DATADIR</b> environment
       variable. If it's set, its value is used instead of /usr/share/mc in the paths below.

       <u>/usr/share/mc/help/mc.hlp</u>

              <b><a href="file:~/.config/mc/ini">~/.config/mc/ini</a></b> file. If /etc/mc/mc.ini exists, /usr/share/mc/mc.ini isn't used.

       <u>/usr/share/mc/mc.lib</u>

              Global settings for Midnight Commander. Settings in this file affect all users, whether they  have

       <u><a href="file:~/.config/mc/ini">~/.config/mc/ini</a></u>

              User's  own  setup.  If  this  file  is  present then the setup is loaded from here instead of the
              system-wide startup file.

       <u>/usr/share/mc/hints/mc.hint</u>

              This file contains the hints displayed by the program.

       <u><a href="file:~/.config/mc/menu">~/.config/mc/menu</a></u>

              User's own application menu. If this file is  present  it  is  used  instead  of  the  system-wide
              applications menu.

       <u><a href="file:~/.cache/mc/Tree">~/.cache/mc/Tree</a></u>

              The directory list for the directory tree and tree view features.

       <u><a href="file:~/.local/share/mc.menu">~/.local/share/mc.menu</a></u>

              Local  user-defined  menu.  If this file is present, it is used instead of the home or system-wide
              applications menu.

       To change default root directory of MC, you can use <b>MC_PROFILE_ROOT</b> environment variable.  The  value  of
       MC_PROFILE_ROOT  must  be an absolute path.  If MC_PROFILE_ROOT is unset or empty, HOME variable is used.
       If HOME is unset or empty, MC directories are get from GLib library.
