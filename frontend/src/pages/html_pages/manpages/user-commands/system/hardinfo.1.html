</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       <b>HardInfo</b> - System profiler and benchmark for Linux systems.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       <b>hardinfo</b> [OPTION...]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Is  a  system  profiler  and benchmark for Linux systems, that gathers information about the hardware and
       operating system, performs benchmarks, and generates reports.  The information gathered is  presented  on
       an simple and intuitive GUI.

       Information is grouped in <u>four</u> <u>main</u> <u>groups</u>: <b>Computer</b>, <b>Devices</b>, <b>Network</b>, and <b>Benchmarks</b>.

       The <b>Computer</b> <b>group</b> contains mostly information about basic software.  This includes but is not limited to
       information  about  the operating system (kernel version, C library, distribution, etc.), kernel modules,
       locale information, filesystem usage, users/groups, and development tools.

       The <b>Devices</b> <b>group</b> contains information about the hardware, as detected by the operating system.  <b>Hardinfo</b>
       is incapable of detecting hardware by itself, it merely lists what the operating system was able to find.
       This includes, but does not limit to, information about the  processor  (including  cache  layout,  known
       bugs,  and  feature  flags  with their explanation), devices (such as USB, PCI, and Input devices), among
       other things.

       The <b>Network</b> <b>group</b> lists information about network interfaces,  routing  table,  DNS  servers,  and  other
       networking-related topics.

       The <b>Benchmarks</b> <b>group</b> allow performing simple benchmarks to test CPU and FPU capabilities, as well as some
       of  the graphical user interface capabilities as well.  In previous versions, it was possible to send the
       benchmark results to a central server, so it was possible to compare the benchmarks with  other  <b>Hardinfo</b>
       users; this service has been deactivated in the mean time.

       <u>Reports</u> can be generated either by invoking <b>Hardinfo</b> with special command-line parameters (see below), or
       by  clicking  the "Generate Report" button in the GUI.  Reports can be customized in the GUI and saved in
       either HTML or plain text formats.
