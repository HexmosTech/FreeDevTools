       Trinity -  Linux system call fuzzer

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
            "After  the  initial  euphoria  of  witnessing the explosion had passed, test       director Kenneth
       Bainbridge commented to Los Alamos director J.  Robert         Oppenheimer,  "Now  we  are  all  sons  of
       bitches."  Oppenheimer later stated       that while watching the test he was reminded of a line from the
       Hindu       scripture the Bhagavad Gita:

                 Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds."

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       System call fuzzers aren't a particularly new idea.   As far back as 1991, people have written apps  that
       bomb  syscall inputs with garbage data, that have had a variety of success in crashing assorted operating
       systems.

       After fixing the obvious dumb bugs however, a majority of the time these calls will just by  rejected  by
       the  kernel  very  near  the  beginning  of  their  function entry point as basic parameter validation is
       performed.

       Trinity is a system call fuzzer which employs some techniques to pass semi-intelligent arguments  to  the
       syscalls being called.

       The intelligence features include:

       - If a system call expects a certain datatype as an argument
         (for example a file descriptor) it gets passed one.
         This is the reason for the slow initial startup, as it generates a
         list of fd's of files it can read from <a href="file:/sys">/sys</a>, <a href="file:/proc">/proc</a> and <a href="file:/dev">/dev</a>
         and then supplements this with fd's for various network protocol sockets.
         (Information on which protocols succeed/fail is cached on the first run,
          greatly increasing the speed of subsequent runs).

       - If a system call only accepts certain values as an argument,
         (for example a 'flags' field), trinity has a list of all the valid
         flags that may be passed.
         Just to throw a spanner in the works, occasionally, it will bitflip
         one of the flags, just to make things more interesting.

       - If a system call only takes a range of values, the random value
         passed is biased to usually fit within that range.

       Trinity  logs it's output to a files (1 for each child process), and fsync's the files before it actually
       makes the system call. This way, should you trigger something which panics the kernel, you should be able
       to find out exactly what happened by examining the log.

       There are several test harnesses provided (test-*.sh), which run trinity in various modes and takes  care
       of  things  like  cpu affinity, and makes sure it runs from the tmp directory. (Handy for cleaning up any
       garbage named files; just rm -rf tmp afterwards)

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
        <u>--arch</u> <u>-a</u>
              Selects syscalls for the specified architecture (32 or 64). Both by default.

        <u>--bdev</u> <u>-b</u> <u>&lt;node&gt;</u>
              Add dev node to list of block devices to use for destructive tests.

        <u>--children</u> <u>-C</u>
              Specify number of child processes

        <u>--debug</u> <u>-D</u>
              Enable debug

       <u>--dropprivs</u> <u>-X</u>
              If run as root, switch to nobody <b>[EXPERIMENTAL]</b>

       <u>--exclude</u> <u>-x</u>
              Don't call a specific syscall

       <u>--enable-fds</u> <u>or</u> <u>--disable-fds</u>
              Options are: sockets, pipes, perf, epoll, eventfd, pseudo, timerfd, testfile, memfd and drm

       <u>--group</u> <u>-g</u> <u>=</u> <u>{vfs,vm}</u>
              Only run syscalls from a certain group.

       <u>--ioctls</u> <u>-I</u>
              List all ioctls.

       <u>--kernel_taint</u> <u>-T</u>
              Controls which kernel taint flags should be considered.

       <u>--list</u> <u>-L</u>
              List all syscalls known on this architecture.

       <u>--logging</u> <u>-l</u>
              off=disable logging.  &lt;dirname&gt; specify a directory where logfiles will be placed.

       <u>--domain</u> <u>-P</u>
              Specify specific network domain for sockets.

       <u>--no_domain</u> <u>-E</u>
              Specify network domains to be excluded from testing.

       <u>--quiet</u> <u>-q</u>
              Less output.

       <u>--random</u> <u>-r#</u>
              Pick N syscalls at random and just fuzz those

       <u>--syslog</u> <u>-S</u>
              Log important info to syslog. Useful if syslog is remote.

       <u>--verbose</u> <u>-v</u>
              Increase output verbosity.

       <u>--victims</u> <u>-V</u>
              Path to victim files.

       <u>-c#</u> <u>@</u>  Target specific syscall, takes syscall name as parameter and optionally 32  or  64  as  bit-width.
              Default is both.

       <u>-N#</u>    Do # syscalls then exit.

       <u>-p</u>     Pause after syscall.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>

              Stress test the splice syscall

       <b>trinity</b> <b>-x</b> <b>splice</b>
              Call every syscall except for splice.

       <b>trinity</b> <b>-qq</b> <b>-l</b> <b>off</b> <b>-C16</b>
              Turn off logging, and suppress most output to run as fast as possible. Use 16 child processes
