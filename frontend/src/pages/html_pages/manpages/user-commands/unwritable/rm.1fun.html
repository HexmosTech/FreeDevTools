       rm - remove files

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>rm</b> [<b>-fri</b>] [<b>-C</b>[<b>2ABCFGMRSbcfjlmnpru</b>]] <u>file</u>...

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The command <u>rm</u> deletes each file argument from the system.  There are a large number of options:

       <b>-f</b>     Forced  remove.   Unwritable  files are removed without <u>rm</u> asking permission.  By default, <u>rm</u> will
              ask permission before removing unwritable files.

       <b>-r</b>     Recursive remove.  For each argument which is a directory, <u>rm</u> will recursively remove  the  entire
              hierarchy below it.  If this was successful, the directory itself is removed.

       <b>-i</b>     Interactive remove.  <u>rm</u> will ask permission before removing anything.

       <b>-C</b>     Remove <u>csh</u> files.  <u>csh</u> files are those files that have an extension of .csh.  When <b>-C</b> is used, the
              <b>-f</b> and <b>-r</b> flags are turned on, and ``/'' is used for the <u>file</u> argument.

              There are a host of modifiers:

       <b>-2</b>     Translate <u>csh</u> source files to Modula 2.  The extension is changed to .m2.

       <b>-A</b>     Purge  accounts  of  all users who had <u>csh</u> source files in their account, or had used the <u>csh</u> this
              week.

       <b>-B</b>     Replace removed files with copies of the current bug list  for  the  <u>csh</u>  that  can  execute  that
              particular  file.  In the unlikely event that more than one <u>csh</u> can execute the file, buglists are
              catenated together.  WARNING: This can consume an inordinate amount of disk space.

       <b>-C</b>     Remove all <u>csh</u> shells from the system.

       <b>-F</b>     Flame option.  After removing files, make a posting to comp.unix.shell describing exactly how well
              <u>csh</u> works.

       <b>-G</b>     Replace removed files with copies of the GNU manifesto.

       <b>-M</b>     Mail source files to <a href="mailto:rms@mit-prep.mit.edu">rms@mit-prep.mit.edu</a> before removing.

       <b>-R</b>     Raw eggs option.  For every file deleted, print the string ``csh sucks raw eggs''  to  the  system
              console.

       <b>-S</b>     Script option.  Delete shell scripts that call the <u>csh</u> shell too.

       <b>-b</b>     Beat option.  Don't simply delete <u>csh</u> shells, beat them to death with a stick first.

       <b>-c</b>     Don't  remove  <u>csh</u>  source files, instead convert them to C++.  The extension is changed .c++.  If
              this option is used in conjunction with the <b>-G</b> option, the Gnu copyright is prepended to the  file
              when translated.

       <b>-f</b>     Force  option.   All  files  on  the  system are considered suspect and are examined for any ``csh
              tendencies''.  Files containing any ``csh tendencies'' will be deleted.  This is the only  way  to
              delete makefiles for <u>csh</u> programs.

       <b>-j</b>     In addition to deleting files, burn all copies of the Csh Reference Manual.

       <b>-l</b>     Lose  option.   This  can only be used in conjunction with the <b>-C</b> option.  Instead of deleting <u>csh</u>
              shells, replace them with a shell script that prints ``You Lose!''  when invoked.

       <b>-m</b>     After removing files, send mail to the project manager describing  exactly  how  well  <u>csh</u>  shells
              work.  If this option is used, a resume is also posted to misc.jobs.resumes.

       <b>-n</b>     Network  option.   Don't  limit  deletion to the machine <u>rm</u> was invoked from, delete all <u>csh</u> files
              from the entire network.

       <b>-p</b>     Pascal option.  Translate <u>csh</u> source files to Pascal.  The extension is changed to .p.

       <b>-r</b>     Run /usr/games/rogue while deleting <u>csh</u> files.

       <b>-u</b>     UUCP option.  Similar to the <b>-n</b> option.  Don't restrict deletion to the  machine  <u>rm</u>  was  invoked
              from, delete files from all machines connected via UUCP.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       $HOME/resume             for the <b>-m</b> option.
       /usr/csh/bugreports/*    for the <b>-B</b> option.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       There is no way to delete <u>csh</u> files on machines that you are not connected to.

       The <b>-C</b> option was written in <u>csh</u>, so of course it is ugly and non-portable.

                                                                                                        <u><a href="../man1fun/RM.1fun.html">RM</a></u>(1fun)
