</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       systemd-inhibit - Execute a program with an inhibition lock taken

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>

       <b>systemd-inhibit</b> [OPTIONS...] [COMMAND] [ARGUMENTS...]

       <b>systemd-inhibit</b> [OPTIONS...] [--list]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>systemd-inhibit</b> may be used to execute a program with a shutdown, sleep, or idle inhibitor lock taken.
       The lock will be acquired before the specified command line is executed and released afterwards.

       Inhibitor locks may be used to block or delay system sleep and shutdown requests from the user, as well
       as automatic idle handling of the OS. This is useful to avoid system suspends while an optical disc is
       being recorded, or similar operations that should not be interrupted.

       For more information see <b>Inhibitor</b> <b>Locks</b>[1].

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The following options are understood:

       <b>--what=</b>
           Takes a colon-separated list of one or more operations to inhibit: "shutdown", "sleep", "idle",
           "handle-power-key", "handle-suspend-key", "handle-hibernate-key", "handle-lid-switch", for inhibiting
           reboot/power-off/halt/kexec/soft-reboot, suspending/hibernating, the automatic idle detection, or the
           low-level handling of the power/sleep key and the lid switch, respectively. If omitted, defaults to
           "idle:sleep:shutdown".

       <b>--who=</b>
           Takes a short, human-readable descriptive string for the program taking the lock. If not passed,
           defaults to the command line string.

       <b>--why=</b>
           Takes a short, human-readable descriptive string for the reason for taking the lock. Defaults to
           "Unknown reason".

       <b>--mode=</b>
           Takes "block", "delay", or "block-weak" and describes how the lock is applied. If "block" is used
           (the default), the lock prohibits any of the requested operations without time limit, and only
           privileged users may override it. If "delay" is used, the lock can only delay the requested
           operations for a limited time. If the time elapses, the lock is ignored and the operation executed.
           The time limit may be specified in <b><a href="../man5/logind.conf.5.html">logind.conf</a></b>(5). Note that "delay" is only available for "sleep"
           and "shutdown". In addition, the weak variants will automatically and silently be bypassed under some
           circumstances.

       <b>--list</b>
           Lists all active inhibition locks instead of acquiring one.

       <b>--no-ask-password</b>
           Do not query the user for authentication for privileged operations.

       <b>--no-pager</b>
           Do not pipe output into a pager.

       <b>--no-legend</b>
           Do not print the legend, i.e. column headers and the footer with hints.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
           Print a short help text and exit.

       <b>--version</b>
           Print a short version string and exit.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       Returns the exit status of the executed program.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLE</b></h4><pre>
           # systemd-inhibit wodim foobar.iso

       This burns the ISO image foobar.iso on a CD using <b><a href="../man1/wodim.1.html">wodim</a></b>(1), and inhibits system sleeping, shutdown and
       idle while doing so.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <u>$SYSTEMD_LOG_LEVEL</u>
           The maximum log level of emitted messages (messages with a higher log level, i.e. less important
           ones, will be suppressed). Takes a comma-separated list of values. A value may be either one of (in
           order of decreasing importance) <b>emerg</b>, <b>alert</b>, <b>crit</b>, <b>err</b>, <b>warning</b>, <b>notice</b>, <b>info</b>, <b>debug</b>, or an integer
           in the range 0...7. See <b><a href="../man3/syslog.3.html">syslog</a></b>(3) for more information. Each value may optionally be prefixed with
           one of <b>console</b>, <b>syslog</b>, <b>kmsg</b> or <b>journal</b> followed by a colon to set the maximum log level for that
           specific log target (e.g.  <b>SYSTEMD_LOG_LEVEL=debug,console:info</b> specifies to log at debug level
           except when logging to the console which should be at info level). Note that the global maximum log
           level takes priority over any per target maximum log levels.

       <u>$SYSTEMD_LOG_COLOR</u>
           A boolean. If true, messages written to the tty will be colored according to priority.

           This setting is only useful when messages are written directly to the terminal, because <b><a href="../man1/journalctl.1.html">journalctl</a></b>(1)
           and other tools that display logs will color messages based on the log level on their own.

       <u>$SYSTEMD_LOG_TIME</u>
           A boolean. If true, console log messages will be prefixed with a timestamp.

           This setting is only useful when messages are written directly to the terminal or a file, because
           <b><a href="../man1/journalctl.1.html">journalctl</a></b>(1) and other tools that display logs will attach timestamps based on the entry metadata on
           their own.

       <u>$SYSTEMD_LOG_LOCATION</u>
           A boolean. If true, messages will be prefixed with a filename and line number in the source code
           where the message originates.

           Note that the log location is often attached as metadata to journal entries anyway. Including it
           directly in the message text can nevertheless be convenient when debugging programs.

       <u>$SYSTEMD_LOG_TID</u>
           A boolean. If true, messages will be prefixed with the current numerical thread ID (TID).

           Note that the this information is attached as metadata to journal entries anyway. Including it
           directly in the message text can nevertheless be convenient when debugging programs.

       <u>$SYSTEMD_LOG_TARGET</u>
           The destination for log messages. One of <b>console</b> (log to the attached tty), <b>console-prefixed</b> (log to
           the attached tty but with prefixes encoding the log level and "facility", see <b><a href="../man3/syslog.3.html">syslog</a></b>(3), <b>kmsg</b> (log to
           the kernel circular log buffer), <b>journal</b> (log to the journal), <b>journal-or-kmsg</b> (log to the journal if
           available, and to kmsg otherwise), <b>auto</b> (determine the appropriate log target automatically, the
           default), <b>null</b> (disable log output).

       <u>$SYSTEMD_LOG_RATELIMIT_KMSG</u>
           Whether to ratelimit kmsg or not. Takes a boolean. Defaults to "true". If disabled, systemd will not
           ratelimit messages written to kmsg.

       <u>$SYSTEMD_PAGER</u>
           Pager to use when <b>--no-pager</b> is not given; overrides <u>$PAGER</u>. If neither <u>$SYSTEMD_PAGER</u> nor <u>$PAGER</u> are
           set, a set of well-known pager implementations are tried in turn, including <b><a href="../man1/less.1.html">less</a></b>(1) and <b><a href="../man1/more.1.html">more</a></b>(1),
           until one is found. If no pager implementation is discovered no pager is invoked. Setting this
           environment variable to an empty string or the value "cat" is equivalent to passing <b>--no-pager</b>.

           Note: if <u>$SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE</u> is not set, <u>$SYSTEMD_PAGER</u> (as well as <u>$PAGER</u>) will be silently
           ignored.

       <u>$SYSTEMD_LESS</u>
           Override the options passed to <b>less</b> (by default "FRSXMK").

           Users might want to change two options in particular:

           <b>K</b>
               This option instructs the pager to exit immediately when Ctrl+C is pressed. To allow <b>less</b> to
               handle Ctrl+C itself to switch back to the pager command prompt, unset this option.

               If the value of <u>$SYSTEMD_LESS</u> does not include "K", and the pager that is invoked is <b>less</b>, Ctrl+C
               will be ignored by the executable, and needs to be handled by the pager.

           <b>X</b>
               This option instructs the pager to not send termcap initialization and deinitialization strings
               to the terminal. It is set by default to allow command output to remain visible in the terminal
               even after the pager exits. Nevertheless, this prevents some pager functionality from working, in
               particular paged output cannot be scrolled with the mouse.

           Note that setting the regular <u>$LESS</u> environment variable has no effect for <b>less</b> invocations by
           systemd tools.

           See <b><a href="../man1/less.1.html">less</a></b>(1) for more discussion.

       <u>$SYSTEMD_LESSCHARSET</u>
           Override the charset passed to <b>less</b> (by default "utf-8", if the invoking terminal is determined to be
           UTF-8 compatible).

           Note that setting the regular <u>$LESSCHARSET</u> environment variable has no effect for <b>less</b> invocations by
           systemd tools.

       <u>$SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE</u>
           Takes a boolean argument. When true, the "secure" mode of the pager is enabled; if false, disabled.
           If <u>$SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE</u> is not set at all, secure mode is enabled if the effective UID is not the
           same as the owner of the login session, see <b><a href="../man2/geteuid.2.html">geteuid</a></b>(2) and <b><a href="../man3/sd_pid_get_owner_uid.3.html">sd_pid_get_owner_uid</a></b>(3). In secure mode,
           <b>LESSSECURE=1</b> will be set when invoking the pager, and the pager shall disable commands that open or
           create new files or start new subprocesses. When <u>$SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE</u> is not set at all, pagers which
           are not known to implement secure mode will not be used. (Currently only <b><a href="../man1/less.1.html">less</a></b>(1) implements secure
           mode.)

           Note: when commands are invoked with elevated privileges, for example under <b><a href="../man8/sudo.8.html">sudo</a></b>(8) or <b><a href="../man1/pkexec.1.html">pkexec</a></b>(1),
           care must be taken to ensure that unintended interactive features are not enabled. "Secure" mode for
           the pager may be enabled automatically as describe above. Setting <u>SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE=0</u> or not
           removing it from the inherited environment allows the user to invoke arbitrary commands. Note that if
           the <u>$SYSTEMD_PAGER</u> or <u>$PAGER</u> variables are to be honoured, <u>$SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE</u> must be set too. It
           might be reasonable to completely disable the pager using <b>--no-pager</b> instead.

       <u>$SYSTEMD_COLORS</u>
           Takes a boolean argument. When true, <b>systemd</b> and related utilities will use colors in their output,
           otherwise the output will be monochrome. Additionally, the variable can take one of the following
           special values: "16", "256" to restrict the use of colors to the base 16 or 256 ANSI colors,
           respectively. This can be specified to override the automatic decision based on <u>$TERM</u> and what the
           console is connected to.

       <u>$SYSTEMD_URLIFY</u>
           The value must be a boolean. Controls whether clickable links should be generated in the output for
           terminal emulators supporting this. This can be specified to override the decision that <b>systemd</b> makes
           based on <u>$TERM</u> and other conditions.
