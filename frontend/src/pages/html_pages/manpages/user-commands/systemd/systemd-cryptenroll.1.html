       systemd-cryptenroll - Enroll PKCS#11, FIDO2, TPM2 token/devices to LUKS2 encrypted volumes

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>

       <b>systemd-cryptenroll</b> [OPTIONS...] [DEVICE]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>systemd-cryptenroll</b> is a tool for enrolling hardware security tokens and devices into a LUKS2 encrypted
       volume, which may then be used to unlock the volume during boot. Specifically, it supports tokens and
       credentials of the following kind to be enrolled:

        1. PKCS#11 security tokens and smartcards that may carry an RSA or EC key pair (e.g. various YubiKeys)

        2. FIDO2 security tokens that implement the "hmac-secret" extension (most FIDO2 keys, including
           YubiKeys)

        3. TPM2 security devices

        4. Regular passphrases

        5. Recovery keys. These are similar to regular passphrases, however are randomly generated on the
           computer and thus generally have higher entropy than user-chosen passphrases. Their character set has
           been designed to ensure they are easy to type in, while having high entropy. They may also be scanned
           off screen using QR codes. Recovery keys may be used for unlocking LUKS2 volumes wherever passphrases
           are accepted. They are intended to be used in combination with an enrolled hardware security token,
           as a recovery option when the token is lost.

       In addition, the tool may be used to enumerate currently enrolled security tokens and wipe a subset of
       them. The latter may be combined with the enrollment operation of a new security token, in order to
       update or replace enrollments.

       The tool supports only LUKS2 volumes, as it stores token meta-information in the LUKS2 JSON token area,
       which is not available in other encryption formats.

       <b>systemd-cryptsetup</b> operates on the device backing <a href="file:/var/">/var/</a> if no device is specified explicitly, and no wipe
       operation is requested. (Note that in the typical case where <a href="file:/var/">/var/</a> is on the same file system as the root
       file system, this hence enrolls a key into the backing device of the root file system.)

   <b>TPM2</b> <b>PCRs</b> <b>and</b> <b>policies</b>
       PCRs allow binding of the encryption of secrets to specific software versions and system state, so that
       the enrolled key is only accessible (may be "unsealed") if specific trusted software and/or configuration
       is used. Such bindings may be created with the option <b>--tpm2-pcrs=</b> described below.

       Secrets may also be bound indirectly: a signed policy for a state of some combination of PCR values is
       provided, and the secret is bound to the public part of the key used to sign this policy. This means that
       the owner of a key can generate a sequence of signed policies, for specific software versions and system
       states, and the secret can be decrypted as long as the machine state matches one of those policies. For
       example, a vendor may provide such a policy for each kernel+initrd update, allowing users to encrypt
       secrets so that they can be decrypted when running any kernel+initrd signed by the vendor. Such bindings
       may be created with the options <b>--tpm2-public-key=</b>, <b>--tpm2-public-key-pcrs=</b>, <b>--tpm2-signature=</b> described
       below.

       See <b>Linux</b> <b>TPM</b> <b>PCR</b> <b>Registry</b>[1] for an authoritative list of PCRs and how they are updated. The table below
       contains a quick reference, describing in particular the PCRs modified by systemd.

       In general, encrypted volumes would be bound to some combination of PCRs 7, 11, and 14 (if shim/MOK is
       used). In order to allow firmware and OS version updates, it is typically not advisable to use PCRs such
       as 0 and 2, since the program code they cover should already be covered indirectly through the
       certificates measured into PCR 7. Validation through certificates hashes is typically preferable over
       validation through direct measurements as it is less brittle in context of OS/firmware updates: the
       measurements will change on every update, but signatures should remain unchanged. See the <b>Linux</b> <b>TPM</b> <b>PCR</b>
       <b>Registry</b>[1] for more discussion.

</pre><h4><b>LIMITATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Note that currently when enrolling a new key of one of the five supported types listed above, it is
       required to first provide a passphrase, a recovery key, a FIDO2 token, or a TPM2 key. It's currently not
       supported to unlock a device with a PKCS#11 key in order to enroll a new PKCS#11 key. Thus, if in future
       key roll-over is desired it's generally recommended to ensure a passphrase, a recovery key, a FIDO2
       token, or a TPM2 key is always enrolled.

       Also note that support for enrolling multiple FIDO2 tokens is currently limited. When multiple FIDO2
       tokens are enrolled, <b>systemd-cryptsetup</b> will perform pre-flight requests to attempt to identify which of
       the enrolled tokens are currently plugged in. However, this is not possible for FIDO2 tokens with user
       verification (UV, usually via biometrics), in which case it will fall back to attempting each enrolled
       token one by one. This will result in multiple prompts for PIN and user verification. This limitation
       does not apply to PKCS#11 tokens.

</pre><h4><b>COMPATIBILITY</b></h4><pre>
       Security technology both in systemd and in the general industry constantly evolves. In order to provide
       best security guarantees, the way TPM2, FIDO2, PKCS#11 devices are enrolled is regularly updated in newer
       versions of systemd. Whenever this happens the following compatibility guarantees are given:

       •   Old enrollments continue to be supported and may be unlocked with newer versions of <b>systemd-</b>
           <b>cryptsetup@.<a href="../man8/service.8.html">service</a></b>(8).

       •   The opposite is not guaranteed however: it might not be possible to unlock volumes with enrollments
           done with a newer version of <b>systemd-cryptenroll</b> with an older version of <b>systemd-cryptsetup</b>.

       That said, it is generally recommended to use matching versions of <b>systemd-cryptenroll</b> and
       <b>systemd-cryptsetup</b>, since this is best tested and supported.

       It might be advisable to re-enroll existing enrollments to take benefit of newer security features, as
       they are added to systemd.

</pre><h4><b>UNLOCKING</b></h4><pre>
       The following options are understood that may be used to unlock the device in preparation of the
       enrollment operations:

       <b>--unlock-key-file=</b><u>PATH</u>
           Use a file instead of a password/passphrase read from stdin to unlock the volume. Expects the PATH to
           the file containing your key to unlock the volume. Currently there is nothing like <b>--key-file-offset=</b>
           or <b>--key-file-size=</b> so this file has to only contain the full key.

           Added in version 252.

       <b>--unlock-fido2-device=</b><u>PATH</u>
           Use a FIDO2 device instead of a password/passphrase read from stdin to unlock the volume. Expects a
           hidraw device referring to the FIDO2 device (e.g.  /dev/hidraw1). Alternatively the special value
           "auto" may be specified, in order to automatically determine the device node of a currently plugged
           in security token (of which there must be exactly one). This automatic discovery is unsupported if
           <b>--fido2-device=</b> option is also specified. Note that currently FIDO2 devices enrolled without an
           accompanying LUKS2 token (i.e.  <b>--fido2-parameters-in-header=no</b>) cannot be used for unlocking.

           Added in version 253.

       <b>--unlock-tpm2-device=</b><u>PATH</u>
           Use a TPM2 device instead of a password/passphrase read from stdin to unlock the volume. Expects a
           device node path referring to the TPM2 chip (e.g.  /dev/tpmrm0). Alternatively the special value
           "auto" may be specified, in order to automatically determine the device node of a currently
           discovered TPM2 device (of which there must be exactly one).

           Added in version 256.

</pre><h4><b>SIMPLE</b> <b>ENROLLMENT</b></h4><pre>
       The following options are understood that may be used to enroll simple user input based unlocking:

       <b>--password</b>
           Enroll a regular password/passphrase. This command is mostly equivalent to <b>cryptsetup</b> <b>luksAddKey</b>,
           however may be combined with <b>--wipe-slot=</b> in one call, see below.

           Added in version 248.

       <b>--recovery-key</b>
           Enroll a recovery key. Recovery keys are mostly identical to passphrases, but are computer-generated
           instead of being chosen by a human, and thus have a guaranteed high entropy. The key uses a character
           set that is easy to type in, and may be scanned off screen via a QR code.

           Added in version 248.

</pre><h4><b>PKCS#11</b> <b>ENROLLMENT</b></h4><pre>
       The following option is understood that may be used to enroll PKCS#11 tokens:

       <b>--pkcs11-token-uri=</b><u>URI</u>
           Enroll a PKCS#11 security token or smartcard (e.g. a YubiKey). Expects a PKCS#11 URI that allows
           finding an X.509 certificate or a public key on the token. The URI must also be suitable to find a
           related private key after changing the type of object in it. Alternatively the special value "auto"
           may be specified, in order to automatically determine the suitable URI if a single security token
           containing a single key pair is plugged in. The special value "list" may be used to enumerate all
           suitable PKCS#11 tokens currently plugged in.

           The PKCS#11 token must contain an RSA or EC key pair which will be used to unlock a LUKS2 volume. For
           RSA, a randomly generated volume key is encrypted with a public key in the token, and stored in the
           LUKS2 JSON token header area. To unlock a volume, the stored encrypted volume key will be decrypted
           with a private key in the token. For ECC, ECDH algorithm is used: we generate a pair of EC keys in
           the same EC group, then derive a shared secret using the generated private key and the public key in
           the token. The derived shared secret is used as a volume key. The generated public key is stored in
           the LUKS2 JSON token header area. The generated private key is erased. To unlock a volume, we derive
           the shared secret with the stored public key and a private key in the token.

           In order to unlock a LUKS2 volume with an enrolled PKCS#11 security token, specify the <b>pkcs11-uri=</b>
           option in the respective <a href="file:/etc/crypttab">/etc/crypttab</a> line:

               myvolume /dev/sda1 - pkcs11-uri=auto

           Added in version 248.

</pre><h4><b>FIDO2</b> <b>ENROLLMENT</b></h4><pre>
       The following options are understood that may be used to enroll FIDO2 tokens:

       <b>--fido2-device=</b><u>PATH</u>
           Enroll a FIDO2 security token that implements the "hmac-secret" extension (e.g. a YubiKey). Expects a
           hidraw device referring to the FIDO2 device (e.g.  /dev/hidraw1). Alternatively the special value
           "auto" may be specified, in order to automatically determine the device node of a currently plugged
           in security token (of which there must be exactly one). This automatic discovery is unsupported if
           <b>--unlock-fido2-device=</b> option is also specified. The special value "list" may be used to enumerate
           all suitable FIDO2 tokens currently plugged in. Note that many hardware security tokens that
           implement FIDO2 also implement the older PKCS#11 standard. Typically FIDO2 is preferable, given it's
           simpler to use and more modern.

           In order to unlock a LUKS2 volume with an enrolled FIDO2 security token, specify the <b>fido2-device=</b>
           option in the respective <a href="file:/etc/crypttab">/etc/crypttab</a> line:

               myvolume /dev/sda1 - fido2-device=auto

           See <b><a href="../man5/crypttab.5.html">crypttab</a></b>(5) for a more comprehensive example of a <b>systemd-cryptenroll</b> invocation and its matching
           <a href="file:/etc/crypttab">/etc/crypttab</a> line.

           Added in version 248.

       <b>--fido2-credential-algorithm=</b><u>STRING</u>
           Specify COSE algorithm used in credential generation. The default value is "es256". Supported values
           are "es256", "rs256" and "eddsa".

           "es256" denotes ECDSA over NIST P-256 with SHA-256.  "rs256" denotes 2048-bit RSA with PKCS#1.5
           padding and SHA-256.  "eddsa" denotes EDDSA over Curve25519 with SHA-512.

           Note that your authenticator may choose not to support some algorithms.

           Added in version 251.

       <b>--fido2-salt-file=</b><u>PATH</u>
           When enrolling a FIDO2 security token, specifies the path to a file or an <b>AF_UNIX</b> socket from which
           we should read the salt value to be used in the HMAC operation performed by the FIDO2 security token.
           If this option is not specified, the salt will be randomly generated.

           Added in version 257.

       <b>--fido2-parameters-in-header=</b><u>BOOL</u>
           When enrolling a FIDO2 security token, controls whether to store FIDO2 parameters in a token in the
           LUKS2 superblock. Defaults to "yes". If set to "no", the <b>fido2-cid=</b> option has to be specified
           manually in the respective <a href="file:/etc/crypttab">/etc/crypttab</a> line along with a key file. See <b><a href="../man5/crypttab.5.html">crypttab</a></b>(5) for details.

           Added in version 257.

       <b>--fido2-with-client-pin=</b><u>BOOL</u>
           When enrolling a FIDO2 security token, controls whether to require the user to enter a PIN when
           unlocking the volume (the FIDO2 "clientPin" feature). Defaults to "yes". (Note: this setting is
           without effect if the security token does not support the "clientPin" feature at all, or does not
           allow enabling or disabling it.)

           Added in version 249.

       <b>--fido2-with-user-presence=</b><u>BOOL</u>
           When enrolling a FIDO2 security token, controls whether to require the user to verify presence (tap
           the token, the FIDO2 "up" feature) when unlocking the volume. Defaults to "yes". (Note: this setting
           is without effect if the security token does not support the "up" feature at all, or does not allow
           enabling or disabling it.)

           Added in version 249.

       <b>--fido2-with-user-verification=</b><u>BOOL</u>
           When enrolling a FIDO2 security token, controls whether to require user verification when unlocking
           the volume (the FIDO2 "uv" feature). Defaults to "no". (Note: this setting is without effect if the
           security token does not support the "uv" feature at all, or does not allow enabling or disabling it.)

           Added in version 249.

</pre><h4><b>TPM2</b> <b>ENROLLMENT</b></h4><pre>
       The following options are understood that may be used to enroll TPM2 devices:

       <b>--tpm2-device=</b><u>PATH</u>
           Enroll a TPM2 security chip. Expects a device node path referring to the TPM2 chip (e.g.
           /dev/tpmrm0). Alternatively the special value "auto" may be specified, in order to automatically
           determine the device node of a currently discovered TPM2 device (of which there must be exactly one).
           The special value "list" may be used to enumerate all suitable TPM2 devices currently discovered.

           In order to unlock a LUKS2 volume with an enrolled TPM2 security chip, specify the <b>tpm2-device=</b>
           option in the respective <a href="file:/etc/crypttab">/etc/crypttab</a> line:

               myvolume /dev/sda1 - tpm2-device=auto

           See <b><a href="../man5/crypttab.5.html">crypttab</a></b>(5) for a more comprehensive example of a <b>systemd-cryptenroll</b> invocation and its matching
           <a href="file:/etc/crypttab">/etc/crypttab</a> line.

           Use <b>--tpm2-pcrs=</b> (see below) to configure which TPM2 PCR indexes to bind the enrollment to.

           Added in version 248.

       <b>--tpm2-device-key=</b><u>PATH</u>
           Enroll a TPM2 security chip using its public key. Expects a path referring to the TPM2 public key in
           TPM2B_PUBLIC format. This cannot be used with <b>--tpm2-device=</b>, as it performs the same operation, but
           without connecting to the TPM2 security chip; instead the enrollment is calculated using the provided
           TPM2 key. This is useful in situations where the TPM2 security chip is not available at the time of
           enrollment.

           The key, in most cases, should be the Storage Root Key (SRK) from a local TPM2 security chip. If a
           key from a different handle (not the SRK) is used, you must specify its handle index using
           <b>--tpm2-seal-key-handle=</b>.

           The <b><a href="../man8/systemd-tpm2-setup.service.8.html">systemd-tpm2-setup.service</a></b>(8) service writes the SRK to
           /run/systemd/tpm2-srk-public-key.tpm2b_public automatically during boot, in the correct format.

           Alternatively, you may use <b>systemd-analyze</b> <b>srk</b> to retrieve the SRK from the TPM2 security chip
           explicitly. See <b><a href="../man1/systemd-analyze.1.html">systemd-analyze</a></b>(1) for details. Example:

               systemd-analyze srk &gt; srk.tpm2b_public

           Added in version 255.

       <b>--tpm2-seal-key-handle=</b><u>HANDLE</u>
           Configures which parent key to use for sealing, using the TPM handle (index) of the key. This is used
           to "seal" (encrypt) a secret and must be used later to "unseal" (decrypt) the secret. Expects a
           hexadecimal 32bit integer, optionally prefixed with "0x". Allowable values are any handle index in
           the persistent ("0x81000000"-"0x81ffffff") or transient ("0x80000000"-"0x80ffffff") ranges. Since
           transient handles are lost after a TPM reset, and may be flushed during TPM context switching, they
           should not be used except for very specific use cases, e.g. testing.

           The default is the Storage Root Key (SRK) handle index "0x81000001". A value of 0 will use the
           default. For the SRK handle, a new key will be created and stored in the TPM if one does not already
           exist; for any other handle, the key must already exist in the TPM at the specified handle index.

           This should not be changed unless you know what you are doing.

           Added in version 255.

       <b>--tpm2-pcrs=</b><u>PCR[+PCR...]</u>
           Configures the TPM2 PCRs (Platform Configuration Registers) to bind to when enrollment is requested
           via <b>--tpm2-device=</b>. Takes a list of PCR entries, where each entry starts with a name or numeric index
           in the range 0...23, optionally followed by ":" and a hash algorithm name (specifying the PCR bank),
           optionally followed by "=" and a hash digest value. Multiple PCR entries are separated by "+". If not
           specified, the default is to use PCR 7 only. If an empty string is specified, binds the enrollment to
           no PCRs at all. See the table above for a list of available PCRs.

           Example: <b>--tpm2-pcrs=boot-loader-code+platform-config+boot-loader-config</b> specifies that PCR registers
           4, 1, and 5 should be used.

           Example: <b>--tpm2-pcrs=7:sha256</b> specifies that PCR register 7 from the SHA256 bank should be used.

           Example: <b>--tpm2-pcrs=4:sha1=3a3f780f11a4b49969fcaa80cd6e3957c33b2275</b> specifies that PCR register 4
           from the SHA1 bank should be used, and a hash digest value of
           3a3f780f11a4b49969fcaa80cd6e3957c33b2275 will be used instead of reading the current PCR value.

           Added in version 248.

       <b>--tpm2-with-pin=</b><u>BOOL</u>
           When enrolling a TPM2 device, controls whether to require the user to enter a PIN when unlocking the
           volume in addition to PCR binding, based on TPM2 policy authentication. Defaults to "no". Despite
           being called PIN, any character can be used, not just numbers.

           Note that incorrect PIN entry when unlocking increments the TPM dictionary attack lockout mechanism,
           and may lock out users for a prolonged time, depending on its configuration. The lockout mechanism is
           a global property of the TPM, <b>systemd-cryptenroll</b> does not control or configure the lockout
           mechanism. You may use tpm2-tss tools to inspect or configure the dictionary attack lockout, with
           <b><a href="../man1/tpm2_getcap.1.html">tpm2_getcap</a></b>(1) and <b><a href="../man1/tpm2_dictionarylockout.1.html">tpm2_dictionarylockout</a></b>(1) commands, respectively.

           Added in version 251.

       <b>--tpm2-public-key=</b><u>PATH</u>, <b>--tpm2-public-key-pcrs=</b><u>PCR[+PCR...]</u>, <b>--tpm2-signature=</b><u>PATH</u>
           Configures a TPM2 signed PCR policy to bind encryption to. The <b>--tpm2-public-key=</b> option accepts a
           path to a PEM encoded RSA public key, to bind the encryption to. If this is not specified explicitly,
           but a file tpm2-pcr-public-key.pem exists in one of the directories <a href="file:/etc/systemd/">/etc/systemd/</a>, <a href="file:/run/systemd/">/run/systemd/</a>,
           <a href="file:/usr/lib/systemd/">/usr/lib/systemd/</a> (searched in this order), it is automatically used. The <b>--tpm2-public-key-pcrs=</b>
           option takes a list of TPM2 PCR indexes to bind to (same syntax as <b>--tpm2-pcrs=</b> described above). If
           not specified defaults to 11 (i.e. this binds the policy to any unified kernel image for which a PCR
           signature can be provided).

           Note the difference between <b>--tpm2-pcrs=</b> and <b>--tpm2-public-key-pcrs=</b>: the former binds decryption to
           the current, specific PCR values; the latter binds decryption to any set of PCR values for which a
           signature by the specified public key can be provided. The latter is hence more useful in scenarios
           where software updates shall be possible without losing access to all previously encrypted LUKS2
           volumes. Like with <b>--tpm2-pcrs=</b>, names defined in the table above can also be used to specify the
           registers, for instance <b>--tpm2-public-key-pcrs=boot-loader-code+system-identity</b>.

           The <b>--tpm2-signature=</b> option takes a path to a TPM2 PCR signature file as generated by the <b><a href="../man1/systemdmeasure.1.html">systemd-</a></b>
           <b><a href="../man1/systemdmeasure.1.html">measure</a></b>(1) tool. If this is not specified explicitly, a suitable signature file
           tpm2-pcr-signature.json is searched for in <a href="file:/etc/systemd/">/etc/systemd/</a>, <a href="file:/run/systemd/">/run/systemd/</a>, <a href="file:/usr/lib/systemd/">/usr/lib/systemd/</a> (in this
           order) and used. If a signature file is specified or found it is used to verify if the volume can be
           unlocked with it given the current PCR state, before the new slot is written to disk. This is
           intended as safety net to ensure that access to a volume is not lost if a public key is enrolled for
           which no valid signature for the current PCR state is available. If the supplied signature does not
           unlock the current PCR state and public key combination, no slot is enrolled and the operation will
           fail. If no signature file is specified or found no such safety verification is done.

           Added in version 252.

       <b>--tpm2-pcrlock=</b><u>PATH</u>
           Configures a TPM2 pcrlock policy to bind encryption to. Expects a path to a pcrlock policy file as
           generated by the <b><a href="../man8/systemd-pcrlock.8.html">systemd-pcrlock</a></b>(8) tool. If a TPM2 device is enrolled and this option is not used
           but a file pcrlock.json is found in <a href="file:/run/systemd/">/run/systemd/</a> or <a href="file:/var/lib/systemd/">/var/lib/systemd/</a> it is automatically used.
           Assign an empty string to turn this behaviour off.

           Added in version 255.

</pre><h4><b>OTHER</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The following additional options are understood:

       <b>--wipe-slot=</b><u>SLOT[,SLOT...]</u>
           Wipes one or more LUKS2 key slots. Takes a comma separated list of numeric slot indexes, or the
           special strings "all" (for wiping all key slots), "empty" (for wiping all key slots that are unlocked
           by an empty passphrase), "password" (for wiping all key slots that are unlocked by a traditional
           passphrase), "recovery" (for wiping all key slots that are unlocked by a recovery key), "pkcs11" (for
           wiping all key slots that are unlocked by a PKCS#11 token), "fido2" (for wiping all key slots that
           are unlocked by a FIDO2 token), "tpm2" (for wiping all key slots that are unlocked by a TPM2 chip),
           or any combination of these strings or numeric indexes, in which case all slots matching either are
           wiped. As safety precaution an operation that wipes all slots without exception (so that the volume
           cannot be unlocked at all anymore, unless the volume key is known) is refused.

           This switch may be used alone, in which case only the requested wipe operation is executed. It may
           also be used in combination with any of the enrollment options listed above, in which case the
           enrollment is completed first, and only when successful the wipe operation executed — and the newly
           added slot is always excluded from the wiping. Combining enrollment and slot wiping may thus be used
           to update existing enrollments:

               systemd-cryptenroll /dev/sda1 --wipe-slot=tpm2 --tpm2-device=auto

           The above command will enroll the TPM2 chip, and then wipe all previously created TPM2 enrollments on
           the LUKS2 volume, leaving only the newly created one. Combining wiping and enrollment may also be
           used to replace enrollments of different types, for example for changing from a PKCS#11 enrollment to
           a FIDO2 one:

               systemd-cryptenroll /dev/sda1 --wipe-slot=pkcs11 --fido2-device=auto

           Or for replacing an enrolled empty password by TPM2:

               systemd-cryptenroll /dev/sda1 --wipe-slot=empty --tpm2-device=auto

           Added in version 248.

       <b>--list-devices</b>
           Show a list of candidate block devices this command may operate on. Specifically, this enumerates
           block devices currently present that contain a LUKS superblock, and shows their device node paths
           along with any of their symlinks. The devices must implement the <b>hmac-secret</b> extension to be useable.

           Added in version 257.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
           Print a short help text and exit.

       <b>--version</b>
           Print a short version string and exit.

       <b>--no-pager</b>
           Do not pipe output into a pager.

</pre><h4><b>CREDENTIALS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>systemd-cryptenroll</b> supports the service credentials logic as implemented by
       <u>ImportCredential=</u>/<u>LoadCredential=</u>/<u>SetCredential=</u> (see <b><a href="../man5/systemd.exec.5.html">systemd.exec</a></b>(5) for details). The following
       credentials are used when passed in:

       <u>cryptenroll.passphrase</u>, <u>cryptenroll.new-passphrase</u>
           May contain the passphrase to unlock the volume with/to newly enroll.

           Added in version 256.

       <u>cryptenroll.tpm2-pin</u>, <u>cryptenroll.new-tpm2-pin</u>
           May contain the TPM2 PIN to unlock the volume with/to newly enroll.

           Added in version 256.

       <u>cryptenroll.fido2-pin</u>
           If a FIDO2 token is enrolled this may contain the PIN of the token.

           Added in version 256.

       <u>cryptenroll.pkcs11-pin</u>
           If a PKCS#11 token is enrolled this may contain the PIN of the token.

           Added in version 256.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       On success, 0 is returned, a non-zero failure code otherwise.
