                <u>&gt;outfile</u>

       All options can be abbreviated to a unique leading prefix.

       An explicit file name of ``-'' represents standard input; it is assumed if no input files are specified.

       On  VAX VMS and IBM PC DOS, the leading ``-'' on option names may be replaced by a slash, ``/''; however,
       the ``-'' option prefix is always recognized.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>bibclean</b> prettyprints input BibTeX files to <u>stdout</u>, or to a user-specified file,  and  checks  the  brace
       balance  and  bibliography  entry syntax as well.  It can be used to detect problems in BibTeX files that
       sometimes confuse even BibTeX itself, and importantly,  can  be  used  to  normalize  the  appearance  of
       collections of BibTeX files.

       Here is a summary of the formatting actions:

       •  BibTeX items are formatted into a consistent structure with one <u>field</u> <u>=</u> <u>"value"</u> pair per line, and the
          initial @ and trailing right brace in column 1.

       •  Tabs  are  expanded into blank strings; their use is discouraged because they inhibit portability, and
          can suffer corruption in electronic mail.

       •  Long string values are split at a blank and continued onto the next line with leading indentation.

       •  A single blank line separates adjacent bibliography entries.

       •  Text outside BibTeX entries is passed through verbatim.

       •  Outer parentheses around entries are converted to braces.

       •  Personal names in <u>author</u> and <u>editor</u> field values are normalized to the form ``P. D. Q.   Bach'',  from
          ``P.D.Q. Bach'' and ``Bach, P.D.Q.''.

       •  Hyphen sequences in page numbers are converted to en-dashes.

       •  Month values are converted to standard BibTeX string abbreviations.

       •  In  titles,  sequences  of  upper-case  characters at brace level zero are braced to protect them from
          being converted to lower-case letters by some bibliography styles.

       •  CODEN, ISBN (International Standard Book Number) and ISSN (International Standard Serial Number) entry
          values are examined to verify the checksums of each listed number, and  correct  ISBN  hyphenation  is
          automatically supplied.

       The  standardized  format  of the output of <b>bibclean</b> facilitates the later application of simple filters,
       such  as  <b><a href="../man1/bibcheck.1.html">bibcheck</a></b>(1),  <b><a href="../man1/bibdup.1.html">bibdup</a></b>(1),  <b><a href="../man1/bibextract.1.html">bibextract</a></b>(1),  <b><a href="../man1/bibindex.1.html">bibindex</a></b>(1),  <b><a href="../man1/bibjoin.1.html">bibjoin</a></b>(1),  <b><a href="../man1/biblabel.1.html">biblabel</a></b>(1),   <b><a href="../man1/biblook.1.html">biblook</a></b>(1),
       <b><a href="../man1/biborder.1.html">biborder</a></b>(1),  <b><a href="../man1/bibsort.1.html">bibsort</a></b>(1), <b><a href="../man1/citefind.1.html">citefind</a></b>(1), and <b><a href="../man1/citetags.1.html">citetags</a></b>(1), to process the text, and also is the one expected
       by the GNU Emacs BibTeX support functions.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Command-line switches may be abbreviated to a unique leading prefix, and letter case is <u>not</u>  significant.
       All  options  are  parsed before any input bibliography files are read, no matter what their order on the
       command line.  Options that correspond to a yes/no setting of a flag have a form with a prefix  "no-"  to
       set  the  flag  to  <u>no</u>.   For  such  options,  the  last setting determines the flag value used.  That is
       significant when options are also specified in initialization files (see the <b>INITIALIZATION</b> <b>FILES</b>  manual
       section).

       The  leading  hyphen  that distinguishes an option from a filename may be doubled, for compatibility with
       GNU and POSIX conventions.  Thus, <b>-author</b> and <b>--author</b> are equivalent.

       To avoid confusion with options, if a filename begins with a hyphen, it must be disguised  by  a  leading
       absolute or relative directory path, e.g., <u>/tmp/-foo.bib</u> or <u>./-foo.bib</u>.

       <b>-author</b>                     Display  an  author  credit  on  the  standard  error  unit, <u>stderr</u>, and then
                                   terminate with a success return code.  Sometimes  an  executable  program  is
                                   separated  from its documentation and source code; this option provides a way
                                   to recover from that.

       <b>-copyleft</b>                   Display copyright information on the standard error unit,  <u>stderr</u>,  and  then
                                   terminate with a success return code.

       <b>-copyright</b>                  Display  copyright  information  on the standard error unit, <u>stderr</u>, and then
                                   terminate with a success return code.

       <b>-error-log</b> <u>filename</u>         Redirect <u>stderr</u> to the indicated file, which then contains all of  the  error
                                   and  warning  messages.   This option is provided for those systems that have
                                   difficulty redirecting <u>stderr</u>.

       <b>-help</b> or <b>-?</b>                 Display a help message on <u>stderr</u>, giving a usage description, similar to this
                                   section of the manual pages, and then terminate with a success return code.

       <b>-ISBN-file</b> <u>filename</u>         Provide an explicit ISBN-range initialization file.  It  is  processed  <u>after</u>
                                   any system-wide and job-wide ISBN initialization files found on the <b>PATH</b> (for
                                   VAX  VMS,  <b>SYS$SYSTEM</b>)  and  <b>BIBINPUTS</b>  search  paths,  respectively, and may
                                   override them.  The ISBN initialization file name can be changed  at  compile
                                   time,  or  at  run  time  through  a  setting  of  the  environment  variable
                                   <b>BIBCLEANISBN</b>, but  defaults  to  <u>.bibclean.isbn</u>  on  UNIX,  and  <u>bibclean.isb</u>
                                   elsewhere.   For  further  details,  see the <b>ISBN</b> <b>INITIALIZATION</b> <b>FILES</b> manual
                                   section.

       <b>-init-file</b> <u>filename</u>         Provide an explicit value pattern initialization file.  It is processed <u>after</u>
                                   any system-wide and job-wide initialization files found on the <b>PATH</b> (for  VAX
                                   VMS,  <b>SYS$SYSTEM</b>)  and <b>BIBINPUTS</b> search paths, respectively, and may override
                                   them.   It  in  turn  may  be  overridden  by  a   subsequent   file-specific
                                   initialization  file.  The initialization file name can be changed at compile
                                   time,  or  at  run  time  through  a  setting  of  the  environment  variable
                                   <b>BIBCLEANINI</b>,  but  defaults  to  <u>.bibcleanrc</u>  on  UNIX,  and  to <u>bibclean.ini</u>
                                   elsewhere.  For further details, see the <b>INITIALIZATION</b> <b>FILES</b> manual section.

       <b>-keyword-file</b> <u>filename</u>      Provide an explicit keyword initialization file.  It is processed  <u>after</u>  any
                                   system-wide  and job-wide keyword initialization files found on the <b>PATH</b> (for
                                   VAX VMS, <b>SYS$SYSTEM</b>)  and  <b>BIBINPUTS</b>  search  paths,  respectively,  and  may
                                   override  them.   The  keyword  initialization  file  name  can be changed at
                                   compile time, or at run time through a setting of  the  environment  variable
                                   <b>BIBCLEANKEY</b>,   but  defaults  to  <u>.bibclean.key</u>  on  UNIX,  and  <u>bibclean.key</u>
                                   elsewhere.  For further details, see the <b>KEYWORD</b> <b>INITIALIZATION</b> <b>FILES</b>  manual
                                   section.

       <b>-max-width</b> <u>nnn</u>              <b>bibclean</b>  normally  limits  output  line  widths to 72 characters, and in the
                                   interests of consistency, that value should not  be  changed.   Occasionally,
                                   special-purpose  applications  may  require different maximum line widths, so
                                   this option provides that capability.  The number following the  option  name
                                   can  be  specified  in  decimal,  octal  (starting  with  0),  or hexadecimal
                                   (starting with 0x).   A  zero  or  negative  value  is  interpreted  to  mean
                                   unlimited,  so  <b>-max-width</b> <u>0</u> can be used to ensure that each field/value pair
                                   appears on a single line.

                                   When <b>-no-prettyprint</b> requests <b>bibclean</b> to act  as  a  lexical  analyzer,  the
                                   default line width is unlimited, unless overridden by this option.

                                   When  <b>bibclean</b>  is  prettyprinting,  line  wrapping  is done only at a space.
                                   Consequently, a long non-blank character sequence may result  in  the  output
                                   exceeding the requested line width.

                                   When  <b>bibclean</b>  is  lexing,  line  wrapping is done by inserting a backslash-
                                   newline pair when the specified maximum is reached, so no  line  length  ever
                                   exceeds the maximum.

       <b>-[no-]align-equals</b>          With the positive form, align the equals sign in key/value assignments at the
                                   same  column,  separated by a single space from the value string.  Otherwise,
                                   the equals sign follows the key, separated by a single space.  Default: <u>no</u>.

       <b>-[no-]brace-protect</b>         Protect uppercase and mixedcase words at  brace-level  zero  with  braces  to
                                   prevent downcasing by some BibTeX styles.  Default: <u>yes</u>.

       <b>-[no-]check-values</b>          With  the  positive form, apply heuristic pattern matching to field values in
                                   order to detect possible errors (e.g., ``<u>year</u> <u>=</u> <u>"192"</u>'' instead of  ``<u>year</u>  <u>=</u>
                                   <u>"1992"</u>''), and issue warnings when unexpected patterns are found.

                                   That  checking  is  usually  beneficial,  but  if  it produces too many bogus
                                   warnings for a particular bibliography file, you  can  disable  it  with  the
                                   negative form of this option.  Default: <u>yes</u>.

       <b>-[no-]debug-match-failures</b>  With  the  positive  form,  print out a warning when a value pattern fails to
                                   match a value string.

                                   That is helpful in debugging new patterns, but  because  the  output  can  be
                                   voluminous,  you  should  use  this  option  only  with small test files, and
                                   initialization files that eliminate all patterns apart from the ones that you
                                   are testing.  Default: <u>no</u>.

       <b>-[no-]delete-empty-values</b>   With the positive form, remove all field/value pairs for which the  value  is
                                   an  empty  string.   That  is helpful in cleaning up bibliographies generated
                                   from text  editor  templates.  Compare  this  option  with  <b>-[no-]remove-OPT-</b>
                                   <b>prefixes</b> described below.  Default: <u>no</u>.

       <b>-[no-]file-position</b>         With  the  positive  form, give detailed file position information in warning
                                   and error messages.  Default: <u>no</u>.

       <b>-[no-]fix-accents</b>           With  the  positive  form,  normalize  TeX  accents  in   annotes,   authors,
                                   booktitles, editors, notes, remarks, and titles.  Default: <u>no</u>.

       <b>-[no-]fix-braces</b>            With  the  positive  form, normalize bracing in annotes, authors, booktitles,
                                   editors, notes, remarks,  and  titles,  by  removing  unnecessary  levels  of
                                   braces.  Default: <u>no</u>.

       <b>-[no-]fix-degrees</b>           With  the  positive form, remove spaces in author/editor fields inside braces
                                   after letter-ending periods.  That makes reductions from <u>J.</u> <u>J.</u>  <u>{Thomson,</u>  <u>M.</u>
                                   <u>A.,</u>  <u>F.</u>  <u>R.</u> <u>S.}</u>, <u>Frederick</u> <u>{Soddy,</u> <u>B.</u> <u>A.</u> <u>(Oxon.)}</u>, and <u>John</u> <u>A.</u> <u>{Cable,</u> <u>M.</u> <u>A.,</u>

                                   <b>F.R.S.}</b>,  <b>Frederick</b>  <b>{Soddy,</b>  <b>B.A.</b> <b>(Oxon.)}</b>, and <b>John</b> <b>A.</b> <b>{Cable,</b> <b>M.A.,</b> <b>M.Ed.,</b>
                                   <b>Dipl.Deutsch</b> <b>(Marburg),</b> <b>A.L.C.M.}</b>, respectively.

                                   In journals in the humanities and history of science,  as  well  as  in  some
                                   scientific journals until well into the 20th Century, academic, honorary, and
                                   professional  titles  and  degrees  are  commonly attached to personal names.
                                   Even though modern publishing practice avoids such decorations, for accuracy,
                                   bibliography entries should preferably retain  them.   Journal  typographical
                                   practice generally follows the reductions described here.

       <b>-[no-]fix-font-changes</b>      With  the positive form, supply an additional brace level around font changes
                                   in titles to protect against downcasing by some BibTeX styles.  Font  changes
                                   that already have more than one level of braces are not modified.

                                   For  example,  if  a  title  contains  the  Latin  phrase  <u>{\em</u> <u>Dictyostelium</u>
                                   <u>discoideum}</u> or <u>{\em</u> <u>{D}ictyostelium</u> <u>discoideum}</u>, then downcasing  incorrectly
                                   converts  the  phrase to lower-case letters.  Most BibTeX users are surprised
                                   that bracing the initial letters does not prevent the downcase  action.   The
                                   correct  coding is <u>{{\em</u> <u>Dictyostelium</u> <u>discoideum}}</u>.  However, there are also
                                   legitimate cases where an  extra  level  of  bracing  wrongly  protects  from
                                   downcasing.   Consequently,  <b>bibclean</b> normally does <u>not</u> supply an extra level
                                   of braces, but if  you  have  a  bibliography  where  the  extra  braces  are
                                   routinely missing, you can use this option to supply them.

                                   If  you  think that you need this option, it is <u>strongly</u> recommended that you
                                   apply <b>bibclean</b> to your bibliography file with and without  <b>-fix-font-changes</b>,
                                   then  compare  the two output files to ensure that extra braces are not being
                                   supplied in titles where they should not be present.  You must  decide  which
                                   of the two output files is the better choice, then repair the incorrect title
                                   bracing by hand.

                                   Because  font  changes  in  titles are uncommon, except for cases of the type
                                   that this option is designed to correct, it should do more  good  than  harm.
                                   Default: <u>no</u>.

       <b>-[no-]fix-initials</b>          With  the  positive  form,  insert  a  space  after a period following author
                                   initials.  Default: <u>yes</u>.

       <b>-[no-]fix-math</b>              With the positive form,  improve  readability  of  math  mode  in  titles  by
                                   inserting  spaces  around  operators,  deleting  other unnecessary space, and
                                   removing  braces  around  single-character   subscripts   and   superscripts.
                                   Default: <u>no</u>.

       <b>-[no-]fix-names</b>             With the positive form, reorder <u>author</u> and <u>editor</u> name lists to remove commas
                                   at  brace  level  zero,  placing  first  names or initials before last names.
                                   Default: <u>yes</u>.

       <b>-[no-]German-style</b>          With the positive form, interpret quote characters ["]  inside  <u>braced</u>  value
                                   strings  at  brace level 1 according to the conventions of the TeX style file
                                   <u>german.sty</u>, which overloads quote to simplify  input  and  representation  of
                                   German  umlaut  accents,  sharp-s  (es-zet),  ligature  separators, invisible
                                   hyphens, raised/lowered quotes, French guillemets, and discretionary hyphens.
                                   Recognized  character  combinations  are  braced  to  prevent   BibTeX   from
                                   interpreting the quote as a string delimiter.

                                   Quoted  strings  receive  no  special  handling from this option, and because
                                   German nouns in titles must anyway be protected from the downcasing operation
                                   of most BibTeX  bibliography  styles,  German  value  strings  that  use  the
                                   overloaded quote character can always be entered in the form "{...}", without
                                   the need to specify this option at all.

                                   Default: <u>no</u>.

       <b>-[no-]keep-linebreaks</b>       Normally, line breaks inside value strings are collapsed into a single space,
                                   so that long value strings can later be broken to provide lines of reasonable
                                   length.

                                   With  the positive form, linebreaks are preserved in value strings.  If <b>-max-</b>
                                   <b>width</b> is set to zero, this  preserves  the  original  line  breaks.   Spacing
                                   <u>outside</u>  value  strings remains under <b>bibclean</b>'s control, and is not affected
                                   by this option.

                                   Default: <u>no</u>.

       <b>-[no-]keep-parbreaks</b>        With the positive form, preserve paragraph breaks (either formfeeds, or lines
                                   containing only spaces) in value strings.   Normally,  paragraph  breaks  are
                                   collapsed  into  a single space.  Spacing <u>outside</u> value strings remains under
                                   <b>bibclean</b>'s control, and is not affected by this option.  Default: <u>no</u>.

       <b>-[no-]keep-preamble-spaces</b>  With the positive form, preserve all whitespace  in  @Preamble{...}  entries.
                                   Default: <u>no</u>.

       <b>-[no-]keep-spaces</b>           With  the  positive  form,  preserve  all spaces in value strings.  Normally,
                                   multiple spaces are collapsed into a single space.  This option can  be  used
                                   together with <b>-keep-linebreaks</b>, <b>-keep-parbreaks</b>, and <b>-max-width</b> <u>0</u> to preserve
                                   the  form  of  value strings while still providing syntax and value checking.
                                   Spacing <u>outside</u> value strings remains under <b>bibclean</b>'s control,  and  is  not
                                   affected by this option.  Default: <u>no</u>.

       <b>-[no-]keep-string-spaces</b>    With  the  positive  form,  preserve  all whitespace in @String{...} entries.
                                   Default: <u>no</u>.

       <b>-[no-]parbreaks</b>             With the negative form, a paragraph break  (either  a  formfeed,  or  a  line
                                   containing  only  spaces)  is  not  permitted  in  value  strings, or between
                                   field/value pairs.  That may  be  useful  to  quickly  trap  runaway  strings
                                   arising from mismatched delimiters.  Default: <u>yes</u>.

       <b>-[no-]prettyprint</b>           Normally,  <b>bibclean</b> functions as a prettyprinter.  However, with the negative
                                   form of this option, it acts as  a  lexical  analyzer  instead,  producing  a
                                   stream  of  lexical  tokens.   See  the  <b>LEXICAL</b>  <b>ANALYSIS</b> manual section for
                                   further details.  Default: <u>yes</u>.

       <b>-[no-]print-ISBN-table</b>      With the positive form, print the ISBN-range table on <u>stderr</u>, then  terminate
                                   with a success return code.

                                   That action is taken after all command-line options are processed, and before
                                   any  input  files  are read (other than those that are values of command-line
                                   options).

                                   The format of the output ISBN-range table is acceptable for input as an  ISBN
                                   initialization  file  (see  the  <b>ISBN</b>  <b>INITIALIZATION</b>  <b>FILES</b> manual section).
                                   Default: <u>no</u>.

       <b>-[no-]print-keyword-table</b>   With the positive form, print the keyword  initialization  table  on  <u>stderr</u>,
                                   then terminate with a success return code.

                                   That action is taken after all command-line options are processed, and before
                                   any  input  files  are read (other than those that are values of command-line
                                   options).

                                   The format of  the  output  table  is  acceptable  for  input  as  a  keyword
                                   initialization  file  (see  the <b>KEYWORD</b> <b>INITIALIZATION</b> <b>FILES</b> manual section).
                                   Default: <u>no</u>.

       <b>-[no-]print-patterns</b>        With the positive form, print the value  patterns  read  from  initialization
                                   files  as they are added to internal tables.  Use this option to check newly-
                                   added patterns, or to see what patterns are being used.

                                   When <b>bibclean</b> is compiled with native pattern-matching  code  (the  default),
                                   those patterns are the ones that are used in checking value strings for valid
                                   syntax,  and  all  of them are specified in initialization files, rather than
                                   hard-coded into the program.  For further  details,  see  the  <b>INITIALIZATION</b>
                                   <b>FILES</b> manual section.  Default: <u>no</u>.

       <b>-[no-]quiet</b>                 This option is the opposite of <b>-[no-]warning</b>; it exists for user convenience,
                                   and  for  compatibility with other programs that use <b>-q</b>  for quiet operation,
                                   without warning messages.

       <b>-[no-]read-init-files</b>       With the negative form, suppress loading of system-, user-, and file-specific
                                   initialization files.   Initializations  then  come  <u>only</u>  from  those  files
                                   explicitly given by <b>-init-file</b> <u>filename</u> options.  Default: <u>yes</u>.

       <b>-[no-]remove-OPT-prefixes</b>   With  the positive form, remove the ``OPT'' prefix from each field name where
                                   the corresponding value is <u>not</u> an empty string.  The prefix ``OPT''  must  be
                                   entirely in upper-case to be recognized.

                                   This  option  is  for bibliographies generated with the help of the GNU Emacs
                                   BibTeX editing  support,  which  generates  templates  with  optional  fields
                                   identified  by  the ``OPT'' prefix.  Although the function <u>M-x</u> <u>bibtex-remove-</u>
                                   <u>OPT</u> normally bound to the keystrokes  <u>C-c</u>  <u>C-o</u>  does  the  job,  users  often
                                   forget,  with  the  result that BibTeX does not recognize the field name, and
                                   ignores the value string.  Compare this option with <b>-[no-]delete-empty-values</b>
                                   described above.  Default: <u>no</u>.

       <b>-[no-]scribe</b>                With the positive form, accept input syntax conforming to the Scribe document
                                   system.  The output is converted to conform to BibTeX syntax.  See the <b>SCRIBE</b>
                                   <b>BIBLIOGRAPHY</b> <b>FORMAT</b> manual section for further details.  Default: <u>no</u>.

       <b>-[no-]trace-file-opening</b>    With the positive form, record in the error log file the names of  all  files
                                   that   <b>bibclean</b>  attempts  to  open.   Use  this  option  to  identify  where
                                   initialization files are located.  Default: <u>no</u>.

       <b>-[no-]warnings</b>              With the positive form, allow all warning messages.  The negative form is <u>not</u>
                                   recommended because it may mask problems that should be  repaired.   Default:
                                   <u>yes</u>.

       <b>-output-file</b> <u>filename</u>       Supply an alternate output file to replace <u>stdout</u>.  If the filename cannot be
                                   opened for output, execution terminates immediately with a nonzero exit code.

       <b>-version</b>                    Display  the  program  version  number  on  <u>stderr</u>, and then terminate with a
                                   success return code.   That  includes  an  indication  of  who  compiled  the
                                   program, the host name on which it was compiled, the time of compilation, and
                                   the  type  of  string-value  matching code selected, when that information is
                                   available to the compiler.

</pre><h4><b>ERROR</b> <b>RECOVERY</b> <b>AND</b> <b>WARNINGS</b></h4><pre>
       When <b>bibclean</b> detects an error, it issues an error message to both <u>stderr</u> and <u>stdout</u>.  That way, the user
       is clearly notified, and the output bibliography also contains the message at the point of error.

       Error messages begin with a distinctive pair of queries, ??, beginning in column 1, followed by the input
       file name and line number.  If the <b>-file-position</b> option was specified, they also contain the  input  and
       output positions of the current file, entry, and value.  Each position includes the file byte number, the
       line  number,  and  the  column  number.   In the event of a runaway string argument, the entry and value
       positions should precisely pinpoint the erroneous bibliography entry, and  the  file  positions  indicate
       where it was detected, which may be rather later in the files.

       Warning messages identify possible problems, and are therefore sent only to <u>stderr</u>, and not to <u>stdout</u>, so
       they  never  appear  in  the  output  file.   They  are identified by a distinctive pair of percents, %%,
       beginning in column 1, and as with error messages, may be followed  by  file  position  messages  if  the
       <b>-file-position</b> option was specified.

       For  convenience,  the first line of each error and warning message sent to <u>stderr</u> is formatted according
       to the expectations of the GNU Emacs <u>next-error</u> command.  You can invoke  <b>bibclean</b>  with  the  Emacs  <u>M-x</u>
       <u>compile&lt;RET&gt;bibclean</u>  <u>filename.bib</u> <u>&gt;filename.new</u> command, then use the <u>next-error</u> command, normally bound
       to <u>C-x</u> <u>`</u> (that's a grave, or back, accent), to move to the location of the error in the input file.

       If error messages are ignored, and left in the output bibliography file, they precipitates an error  when
       the bibliography is next processed with BibTeX.

       After  issuing  an error message, <b>bibclean</b> then resynchronizes its input by copying it verbatim to <u>stdout</u>
       until a new bibliography entry is recognized on a line in which the first non-blank character is  an  at-
       sign  (@).   That ensures that nothing is lost from the input file(s), allowing corrections to be made in
       either the input or the output files.  However, if  <b>bibclean</b>  detects  an  internal  error  in  its  data
       structures,  it terminates abruptly without further input or output processing; that kind of error should
       never happen, and if it does, it should be reported immediately to the author of the program.  Errors  in
       initialization files, and running out of dynamic memory, also immediately terminate <b>bibclean</b>.

</pre><h4><b>SEARCH</b> <b>PATHS</b></h4><pre>
       Versions  of  <b>bibclean</b>  before 3.00 found some of their initialization files in the same directory as the
       executable program.  That design choice means that those files can be copied anywhere in the file system,
       and still be found at run time.  Some software distributions, however, prefer to follow the  model  where
       initialization and other related files are instead stored in a directory whose name is related to that of
       the  executable  by  a conventional difference in filepath.  For example, a program might be installed in
       <u>/opt/bin</u>      and      its      associated      files       in       <u>/opt/share/lib/PROGRAMNAME/</u>       or
       <u>/opt/share/lib/PROGRAMNAME/PROGRAMVERSION/</u>.   The  second form is preferable, because it permits multiple
       versions of the same program to be installed, as long as the executable program  names  carry  a  version
       suffix. Thus, a site might have installed programs named <u>bibclean-1.00</u>, <u>bibclean-2.00</u>, <u>bibclean-2.15</u>, and
       <u>bibclean-3.00</u>,  with  the  versionless  name  <u>bibclean</u>  being a symbolic link to whichever version is the
       desired local default.

       With most software packages, the absolute path to the directory containing associated files  is  compiled
       into  the  program,  making it impossible to change the installation locations after the program has been
       built from source code.

       Some packages, however, instead use the location of the executable program to find files by relative path
       at runtime.  In the above example, the program would determine its filesystem location  at  runtime,  say
       <u>/opt/bin</u>,     then     find     its     associated     files     relative    to    that    location    in
       <u>../share/lib/PROGRAMNAME/PROGRAMVERSION/</u>.

       From  version  3.00,  <u>bibclean</u>  uses  that  second  approach,   with   an   associated   directory   like
       <u>../share/lib/bibclean/3.00</u>.   That  allows  an  installation  directory  tree  to be distributed to other
       systems and unbundled <u>anywhere</u> in the file system, as  long  as  the  relative  paths  are  not  changed.
       <u>bibclean</u>  tests  whether its compiled-in library path is a directory on the local system, and if so, uses
       it.  Otherwise, it replaces that path by a reconstructed one based on  the  location  of  the  executable
       program.   If  the  reconstructed  path  for the library directory does not exist, it uses a warning.  In
       either case, it continues normally.

       With the old approach, initialization files on Unix systems were named with a leading period, making them
       `hidden' files for the <u>ls</u> command.  With the new practice, initialization files are no  longer  named  as
       hidden files.

       <b>bibclean</b> can be compiled with one of three different types of pattern matching; the choice is made by the
       installer at compile time:

              •  The original version uses explicit hand-coded tests of value-string syntax.

              •  The second version uses regular-expression pattern-matching host library routines together with
                 regular-expression patterns that come entirely from initialization files.

              •  The third version uses special patterns that come entirely from initialization files.

       The  second and third versions are the ones of most interest here, because they allow the user to control
       what values  are  considered  acceptable.   However,  command-line  options  can  also  be  specified  in
       initialization files, no matter which pattern matching choice was selected.

       When  <b>bibclean</b>  starts,  it  searches  for  initialization  files,  finding  the  first one in the system
       executable program search path (on UNIX and IBM PC DOS, <b>PATH</b>) and the first one in the  <b>BIBINPUTS</b>  search
       path,  and processes them in turn.  Then, when command-line arguments are processed, any additional files
       specified by <b>-init-file</b> <u>filename</u> options are also processed.   Finally,  immediately  before  each  <u>named</u>
       bibliography  file is processed, an attempt is made to process an initialization file with the same name,
       but with the extension changed to <u>.ini</u>.  The default extension  can  be  changed  by  a  setting  of  the
       environment  variable  <b>BIBCLEANEXT</b>.   That scheme permits system-wide, user-wide, session-wide, and file-
       specific initialization files to be supported.

       When input is taken from <u>stdin</u>, there is no file-specific initialization.

       For precise control, the <b>-no-read-init-files</b> option suppresses  all  initialization  files  except  those
       explicitly  named  by  <b>-init-file</b>  <u>filename</u>  options,  either  on  the  command  line,  or  in  requested
       initialization files.

       Recursive execution of initialization files with nested <b>-init-file</b> options is permitted; if the recursion
       is circular, <b>bibclean</b> finally gets a non-fatal initialization file open failure after  opening  too  many
       files.   That terminates further initialization file processing.  As the recursion unwinds, the files are
       all closed, then execution proceeds normally.

       An initialization file may contain empty lines, comments from percent to end of  line  (just  like  TeX),
       option switches, and field/pattern or field/pattern/message assignments.  Leading and trailing spaces are
       ignored.  That is best illustrated by a short example:

       % This is a small bibclean initialization file

       -init-file /u/math/bib/.bibcleanrc  %% departmental patterns

       chapter = "\"D\""                 %% 23

       pages   = "\"D--D\""              %% 23--27

       volume  = "\"D \\an\\d D\""       %% 11 and 12

       year    = \
          "\"dddd, dddd, dddd\"" \
          "Multiple years specified."      %% 1989, 1990, 1991

       -no-fix-names   %% do not modify author/editor lists

       Long logical lines can be split into multiple physical lines by breaking at a backslash-newline pair; the
       backslash-newline pair is discarded.  That processing happens while characters are being read, before any
       further interpretation of the input stream.

       Each  logical  line  must  contain a complete option (and its value, if any), or a complete field/pattern
       pair, or a field/pattern/message triple.

       Comments are stripped during the parsing of the field, pattern, and message values.   The  comment  start
       symbol is not recognized inside quoted strings, so it can be freely used in such strings.

       Comments on logical lines that were input as multiple physical lines via the backslash-newline convention
       must  appear  on  the  <u>last</u>  physical  line;  otherwise,  the remaining physical lines become part of the
       comment.

       Pattern strings must be enclosed in quotation marks; within such strings, a backslash  starts  an  escape
       mechanism that is commonly used in UNIX software.  The recognized escape sequences are:

              <b>\a</b>     alarm bell (octal 007)

              <b>\b</b>     backspace (octal 010)

              <b>\f</b>     formfeed (octal 014)

              <b>\n</b>     newline (octal 012)

              <b>\r</b>     carriage return (octal 015)

              <b>\t</b>     horizontal tab (octal 011)

              <b>\v</b>     vertical tab (octal 013)

              <b>\ooo</b>   character number octal <u>ooo</u> (e.g <b>\012</b> is linefeed).  Up to 3 octal digits may be used.

              <b>\0xhh</b>  character  number  hexadecimal  <u>hh</u>  (e.g., <b>\0x0a</b> is linefeed).  <u>xhh</u> may be in either letter
                     case.  Any number of hexadecimal digits may be used.

       Backslash followed by any other character produces just that character.  Thus, \% gets a literal  percent
       into a string (preventing its interpretation as a comment), \" produces a quotation mark, and \\ produces
       a single backslash.

       An  ASCII  NUL  <u>(\0)</u>  in a string terminates it; that is a feature of the C programming language in which
       <b>bibclean</b> is implemented.

       Field/pattern pairs can be separated by arbitrary space, and optionally, either an equals sign  or  colon
       functioning as an assignment operator.  Thus, the following are equivalent:

       pages="\"D--D\""
       pages:"\"D--D\""
       pages "\"D--D\""
         pages = "\"D--D\""
         pages : "\"D--D\""
       pages   "\"D--D\""

       Each  field  name  can  have  an  arbitrary  number of patterns associated with it; however, they must be
       specified in separate field/pattern assignments.

       An empty pattern string causes previously-loaded patterns for that field  name  to  be  forgotten.   That
       feature permits an initialization file to completely discard patterns from earlier initialization files.

       Patterns for value strings are represented in a tiny special-purpose language that is both convenient and
       suitable  for  bibliography  value-string  syntax  checking.   While  not  as powerful as the language of
       regular-expression patterns, its parsing can be portably implemented in less than 3% of  the  code  in  a
       widely-used regular-expression parser (the GNU <b>regexp</b> package).

       The patterns are represented by the following special characters:

              <b>&lt;space&gt;</b>  one or more spaces

              <b>a</b>        exactly one letter

              <b>A</b>        one or more letters

              <b>d</b>        exactly one digit

              <b>D</b>        one or more digits

              <b>r</b>        exactly one Roman numeral

              <b>R</b>        one or more Roman numerals (i.e. a Roman number)

              <b>w</b>        exactly one word (one or more letters and digits)

              <b>W</b>        one or more space-separated words, beginning and ending with a word

              <b>.</b>        one  `special'  character,  one  of  the  characters &lt;space&gt;!#()*+,-./:;?[]~, a subset of
                       punctuation characters that are typically used in string values

              <b>:</b>        one or more `special' characters

              <b>X</b>        one or more `special'-separated words, beginning and ending with a word

              <b>\x</b>       exactly one x (x is any character), possibly with an escape sequence interpretation given
                       earlier

              <b>x</b>        exactly  the  character  x  (x  is  anything  but  one  of  these   pattern   characters:
                       aAdDrRwW.:&lt;space&gt;\)

       The  <b>X</b>  pattern character is very powerful, but generally inadvisable, because it matches almost anything
       likely to be found in a BibTeX value string.  The reason for providing  pattern  matching  on  the  value
       strings is to uncover possible errors, not mask them.

       There  is  no  provision for specifying ranges or repetitions of characters, but that can usually be done
       with separate patterns.  It is a good idea to accompany the pattern with a comment showing  the  kind  of
       thing  it is expected to match.  Here is a portion of an initialization file giving a few of the patterns
       used to match <u>number</u> value strings:

       number  =       "\"D\""         %% 23
       number  =       "\"A AD\""      %% PN LPS5001
       number  =       "\"A D(D)\""    %% RJ <a href="../man49/34.49.html">34</a>(49)
       number  =       "\"A D\""       %% XNSS 288811
       number  =       "\"A D\\.D\""   %% Version 3.20
       number  =       "\"A-A-D-D\""   %% UMIAC-TR-89-11
       number  =       "\"A-A-D\""     %% CS-TR-2189
       number  =       "\"A-A-D\\.D\"" %% CS-TR-21.7

       For a bibliography that contains only <u>article</u> entries, that list should probably be reduced to  just  the
       first  pattern,  so that anything other than a digit string fails the pattern-match test.  That is easily
       done by keeping bibliography-specific patterns in a corresponding file with extension <u>.ini</u>, because  that
       file is read automatically.

       You  should  be  sure  to  use empty pattern strings in the pattern file to discard patterns from earlier
       initialization files.

       The value strings passed to the pattern matcher contain surrounding quotes, so the patterns should  also.
       However,  you  could  use a pattern specification like "\"D" to match an initial digit string followed by
       anything else; the omission of the final quotation mark \" in the pattern allows  the  match  to  succeed
       without checking that the next character in the value string is a quotation mark.

       Because  the  value strings are intended to be processed by TeX, the pattern matching ignores braces, and
       TeX control sequences, together with any space following those control sequences.  Spaces  around  braces
       are  preserved.   That  convention  allows  the  pattern  fragment  <u>A-AD-D</u>  to match the value string <u>TN-</u>
       <u>K\slash</u> <u>27-70</u>, because the value is implicitly collapsed to <u>TN-K27-70</u> during the matching operation.

       <b>bibclean</b>'s normal action when a string value fails to match any of the corresponding patterns is to issue
       a <u>warning</u> message something like this: <u>"Unexpected</u> <u>value</u> <u>in</u> <u>``year</u> <u>=</u> <u>"192"''</u>.  In  most  cases,  that  is
       sufficient  to  alert  the user to a problem.  In some cases, however, it may be desirable to associate a
       different message with a particular pattern.  That can be done by supplying a  message  string  following
       the  pattern  string.   Format  items <u>%%</u> (single percent), <u>%e</u> (entry name), <u>%f</u> (field name), <u>%k</u> (citation
       key), and <u>%v</u> (string value) are available to get current values expanded in the  messages.   Here  is  an
       example:

       chapter = "\"D:D\"" "Colon found in ``%f = %v''" %% 23:2

       To  be  consistent  with  other  messages  output  by  <b>bibclean</b>,  the  message string should <u>not</u> end with
       punctuation.

       If you wish to make the message an error, rather than just a warning, begin it with  a  query  (?),  like
       this:

       chapter = "\"D:D\"" "?Colon found in ``%f = %v''" %% 23:2

       The query is be included in the output message.

       Escape sequences are supported in message strings, just as they are in pattern strings.  You can use that
       to  advantage  for  fancy  things,  such  as  terminal display mode control.  If you rewrite the previous
       example as

       chapter = "\"D:D\"" \
                 "?\033[7mColon found in ``%f = %v''\033[0m" %% 23:2

       the error message appears in inverse  video  on  display  screens  that  support  ANSI  terminal  control
       sequences.   Such  practice  is not normally recommended, because it may have undesirable effects on some
       output devices.  Nevertheless, you may find it useful for restricted applications.

       For some types of bibliography fields, <b>bibclean</b> contains special-purpose code to  supplement  or  replace
       the pattern matching:

              •  <u>CODEN</u>,  <u>ISBN</u>  and  <u>ISSN</u>  field  values  are  handled that way because their validation requires
                 evaluation of checksums that cannot be expressed by simple patterns; no patterns are even  used
                 in these three cases.

              •  When  <b>bibclean</b>  is  compiled  with  pattern-matching  code support, <u>chapter</u>, <u>number</u>, <u>pages</u>, and
                 <u>volume</u> values are checked only by pattern matching.

              •  <u>month</u> values are first checked against the standard BibTeX month abbreviations, and only if  no
                 match is found are patterns then used.

              •  <u>year</u> values are first checked against patterns, then if no match is found, the year numbers are
                 found and converted to integer values for testing against reasonable bounds.

       Values  for  other  fields are checked only against patterns.  You can provide patterns for <u>any</u> field you
       like, even ones <b>bibclean</b> does not already know about.  New ones are simply added  to  an  internal  table
       that is searched for each string to be validated.

       The  special  field,  <u>key</u>, represents the bibliographic citation key.  It can be given patterns, like any
       other field.  Here is an initialization file pattern assignment that matches an author name, a  colon,  a
       four-digit year, a colon, and an alphabetic string, in the BibNet Project style:

       key = "A:dddd:A"                     %% Knuth:1986:TB

       Notice  that  no  quotation  marks are included in the pattern, because the citation keys are not quoted.
       You can use such patterns to help  enforce  uniform  naming  conventions  for  citation  keys,  which  is
       increasingly important as your bibliography data base grows.

</pre><h4><b>ISBN</b> <b>INITIALIZATION</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>bibclean</b>  contains  a compiled-in table of ISBN ranges and country/language settings that is suitable for
       most applications.

       However, ISBN data change yearly, as new countries adopt ISBNs, and as publishers  are  granted  new,  or
       additional, ISBN prefixes.

       Thus,  from  version  2.12,  <b>bibclean</b> supports reading of run-time ISBN initialization files found on the
       <b>PATH</b> (for VAX VMS, <b>SYS$SYSTEM</b>) and <b>BIBINPUTS</b> search paths, and then any specified by <b>-ISBN-file</b>  <u>filename</u>
       options.

       That  feature  makes  it  possible  to incorporate new ISBN data without having to produce a new <b>bibclean</b>
       release and reinstall the software at end-user sites.

       The format of an ISBN initialization file is  similar  to  that  of  the  <b>bibclean</b>  initialization  files
       described  in  the  preceding section: comments begin with percent and continue to end of line, blank and
       empty lines are ignored, backslash-newline joins adjacent lines, and otherwise,  lines  are  expected  to
       contain  a  required  pair  of  ISBN  country/language-publisher prefixes forming a non-decreasing range,
       optionally followed by one or more words of text that are treated as the  country/language  group  value.
       The  latter value plays no part in ISBN validation, but its presence is strongly recommended, in order to
       make the ISBN table more understandable for humans.

       Here is a short example:
              %% The Faeroes got ISBN assignments between 1993 and 1998
              99918-0         99918-3        Faeroes
              99918-40        99918-61
              99918-900       99918-938
       It is not necessary to repeat the country names on succeeding entries with the same initial number (99918
       in that example); that is handled internally.

       Data from ISBN files normally augment the compiled-in data.  However, if the first prefix begins  with  a
       hyphen,  then  <b>bibclean</b>  deletes  the  first  entry in the table matching that first prefix (ignoring the
       leading hyphen):
              %% Latvia got ISBN ranges between 1993 and 1998
              %% so we remove the old placeholder, then add the
              %% new ranges.
              -9984-0         9984-9         This one is no longer valid

              9984-00         9984-20        Latvia
              9984-500        9984-770
              9984-9000       9984-9984

</pre><h4><b>KEYWORD</b> <b>INITIALIZATION</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>bibclean</b> contains a compiled-in table of keyword mappings that is suitable for  most  applications.   The
       default  settings merely adjust lettercase in certain keyword names, so that, for example, <u>isbn</u> is output
       as <u>ISBN</u>.

       From version 2.12, <b>bibclean</b> supports reading of run-time keyword initialization files found on  the  <b>PATH</b>
       (for  VAX  VMS,  <b>SYS$SYSTEM</b>) and <b>BIBINPUTS</b> search paths, and then any specified by <b>-keyword-file</b> <u>filename</u>
       options.

       That feature makes it possible to incorporate special spellings of new keywords without having to produce
       a new <b>bibclean</b> release and reinstall the software at end-user sites.

       The format of a keyword initialization file is similar to that of the other <b>bibclean</b> initialization files
       described in the preceding sections: comments begin with percent and continue to end of line,  blank  and
       empty  lines  are  ignored,  backslash-newline joins adjacent lines, and otherwise, lines are expected to
       contain a required pair of old and new keyword names.

       Here is a short example:
              %% We want special handling of MathReviews keywords
              mrclass         MRclass
              mrnumber        MRnumber
              mrreviewer      MRreviewer

       Data from keywords files normally augment the compiled-in data.  However, if  the  first  keyword  begins
       with  a  hyphen,  then  <b>bibclean</b> deletes the first entry in the table matching that keyword (ignoring the
       leading hyphen):
              %% Remove special handling of ISBN, ISSN, and LCCN values.
              -issn           ISSN
              -isbn           ISBN
              -lccn           LCCN
       Even though the second keyword in each deletion pair is not used, it still must be specified.

       Notice that this feature can be used to regularize keyword names, but use it with care, in order to avoid
       producing duplicate key names in output BibTeX entries:
              %% Map variations of keywords into a common name:
              keys            keywords
              keywds          keywords
              keyword         keywords
              keywrd          keywords
              keywrds         keywords
              searchkey       keywords

</pre><h4><b>LEXICAL</b> <b>ANALYSIS</b></h4><pre>
       When <b>-no-prettyprint</b> is specified, <b>bibclean</b> acts as  a  lexical  analyzer  instead  of  a  prettyprinter,
       producing output in lines of the form

              &lt;token-number&gt;&lt;tab&gt;&lt;token-name&gt;&lt;tab&gt;"&lt;token-value&gt;"

       Each  output  line  contains  a  single complete token, identified by a small integer number for use by a
       computer program, a token type name for human readers, and a string value in quotes.

       Special characters in the token value string are represented with ANSI/ISO Standard C  escape  sequences,
       so  all characters other than NUL are representable, and multi-line values can be represented in a single
       line.

       Here are the token numbers and token type names that can  appear  in  the  output  when  <b>-prettyprint</b>  is
       specified:

               0   UNKNOWN
               1   ABBREV
               2   AT
               3   COMMA
               4   COMMENT
               5   ENTRY
               6   EQUALS
               7   FIELD
               8   INCLUDE
               9   INLINE
              10   KEY
              11   LBRACE
              12   LITERAL
              13   NEWLINE
              14   PREAMBLE
              15   RBRACE
              16   SHARP
              17   SPACE
              18   STRING
              19   VALUE

       Programs  that parse such output should also be prepared for lines beginning with the warning prefix, %%,
       or the error prefix, ??, and for ANSI/ISO Standard C line-number directives of the form
              # line 273 "texbook1.bib"
       that record the line number and file name of the current input file.

       If a <b>-max-width</b> <u>nnn</u> command-line option was specified, long output lines  are  wrapped  at  a  backslash-
       newline  pair,  and  consequently, software that processes the lexical token stream should be prepared to
       collapse such wrapped lines back into single lines.

       As an example of the use of <b>-no-prettyprint</b>, the UNIX command pipeline

       A certain amount of processing has been done on the tokens.   In  particular,  delimiters  equivalent  to
       braces have been replaced by braces, and braced strings have become quoted strings.

       The  LITERAL  token  type  is used for arbitrary text that <b>bibclean</b> does not examine further, such as the
       contents of a @Preamble{...} or a @Comment{...}.

       The UNKNOWN token type should never appear in the output stream.  It is  used  internally  to  initialize
       token type variables.

</pre><h4><b>SCRIBE</b> <b>BIBLIOGRAPHY</b> <b>FORMAT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>bibclean</b>'s  support  for  the Scribe bibliography format is based on the syntax description in the Scribe
       Introductory User's Manual, 3rd Edition, May 1980.  Scribe was originally  developed  by  Brian  Reid  at
       Carnegie-Mellon  University,  and  was  marketed  by Unilogic, Ltd., later renamed to Scribe Systems, and
       apparently now long defunct.

       The BibTeX bibliography format was strongly influenced by Scribe, and indeed, with care, it  is  possible
       to  share  bibliography files between the two systems.  Nevertheless, there are some differences, so here
       is a summary of features of the Scribe bibliography file format:

       (1)   Letter case is not significant in field names and entry names,  but  case  is  preserved  in  value
             strings.

       (2)   In  field/value  pairs,  the  field and value may be separated by one of three characters: =, /, or
             space.  Space may optionally surround these separators.

       (3)   Value delimiters are any of these seven pairs: { }   [ ]   ( )   &lt; &gt;   ' '   " "   ` `

       (4)   Value delimiters may not be nested, even  though  with  the  first  four  delimiter  pairs,  nested
             balanced delimiters would be unambiguous.

       (5)   Delimiters  can  be  omitted  around values that contain only letters, digits, sharp (#), ampersand
             (&amp;), period (.), and percent (%).

       (6)   Outside of delimited values, a literal at-sign (@) is represented by doubled at-signs (@@).

       (7)   Bibliography entries begin with @name, as for BibTeX, but any of the seven Scribe  value  delimiter
             pairs  may  be  used to surround the values in field/value pairs.  As in (4), nested delimiters are
             forbidden.

       (8)   Arbitrary space may separate entry names from the following delimiters.

       (9)   @Comment is a special command whose delimited value is discarded.  As in (4), nested delimiters are
             forbidden.

       (10)  The special form

             @Begin{comment}
              ...
             @End{comment}

             permits  encapsulating  arbitrary  text  containing  any  characters  or  delimiters,  other   than
             ``@End{comment}''.   Any  of  the  seven  delimiter  pairs  may be used around the word ``comment''
             following the ``@Begin'' or ``@End''; the delimiters in the two cases need not  be  the  same,  and
             consequently, ``@Begin{comment}''/``@End{comment}'' pairs may <u>not</u> be nested.

       (11)  The <u>key</u> field is required in each bibliography entry.

       (12)  A  backslashed  quote  in  a string is assumed to be a TeX accent, and braced appropriately.  While
             such accents do not conform to Scribe syntax, Scribe-format bibliographies  have  been  found  that
             appear to be intended for TeX processing.

       Because  of  that  loose  syntax,  <b>bibclean</b>'s  normal  error detection heuristics are less effective, and
       consequently, Scribe mode input is not the default; it must be explicitly requested.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>BIBCLEANEXT</b>   File extension of bibliography-specific initialization files.  Default: <u>.ini</u>.

       <b>BIBCLEANINI</b>   Name of <b>bibclean</b> initialization files.  Default:  <u>.bibcleanrc</u>  (UNIX),  <u>bibclean.ini</u>  (non-
                     UNIX).

       <b>BIBCLEANISBN</b>  Name  of  <b>bibclean</b> ISBN initialization files.  Default: <u>.bibclean.isbn</u> (UNIX), <u>bibclean.isb</u>
                     (non-UNIX).

       <b>BIBCLEANKEY</b>   Name of <b>bibclean</b> keyword initialization files.  Default: <u>.bibclean.key</u> (UNIX), <u>bibclean.key</u>
                     (non-UNIX).

       <b>BIBINPUTS</b>     Search path for <b>bibclean</b> and BibTeX input files.  On UNIX, it is a colon-separated list  of
                     directories  that  are  searched  in  order  from  first to last.  It is not an error for a
                     specified directory to not exist.

                     On other operating systems, the directory names should be separated by  whatever  character
                     is used in system search path specifications, such as a semicolon on IBM PC DOS.

       <b>PATH</b>          On  Atari  TOS,  IBM  PC  DOS,  IBM PC OS/2, Microsoft NT, and UNIX, search path for system
                     executable files.  The system-wide <b>bibclean</b> initialization file is  searched  for  in  that
                     path.

       <b>SYS$SYSTEM</b>    On  VAX  VMS,  search  path  for  system  executable  files  and  the  system-wide <b>bibclean</b>
                     initialization file.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <u>*.bib</u>          BibTeX and Scribe bibliography data base files.

       <u>*.ini</u>          File-specific initialization files.

       <u>.bibclean.isbn</u> UNIX system-wide and user-specific ISBN initialization files.

       <u>.bibclean.key</u>  UNIX system-wide and user-specific keyword initialization files.

       <u>.bibcleanrc</u>    UNIX system-wide and user-specific initialization files.

       <u>bibclean.ini</u>   Non-UNIX system-wide and user-specific initialization files.

       <u>bibclean.isb</u>   Non-UNIX system-wide and user-specific ISBN initialization files.

       <u>bibclean.key</u>   Non-UNIX system-wide and user-specific keyword initialization files.
