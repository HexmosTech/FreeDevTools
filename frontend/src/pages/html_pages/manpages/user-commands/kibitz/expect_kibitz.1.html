</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       kibitz - allow two people to interact with one shell

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>kibitz</b> [ <u>kibitz-args</u> ] <u>user</u> [ <u>program</u> <u>program-args...</u>  ]
       <b>kibitz</b> [ <u>kibitz-args</u> ] <u>user@host</u> [ <u>program</u> <u>program-args...</u>  ]

</pre><h4><b>INTRODUCTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>kibitz</b> allows two (or more) people to interact with one shell (or any arbitrary program).  Uses include:

              •   A novice user can ask an expert user for help.  Using <b>kibitz</b>, the expert can see what the user
                  is doing, and offer advice or show how to do it right.

              •   By running <b>kibitz</b> and then starting a full-screen editor, people may carry out a conversation,
                  retaining the ability to scroll backwards, save the entire conversation, or even edit it while
                  in progress.

              •   People  can  team  up on games, document editing, or other cooperative tasks where each person
                  has strengths and weaknesses that complement one another.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       To start <b>kibitz</b>, user1 runs kibitz with the argument of the user to kibitz.  For example:

            kibitz user2

       <b>kibitz</b> starts a new shell (or another program, if given on the command line), while  prompting  user2  to
       run  <b>kibitz</b>.   If  user2  runs  <b>kibitz</b>  as directed, the keystrokes of both users become the input of the
       shell.  Similarly, both users receive the output from the shell.

       To terminate <b>kibitz</b> it suffices to terminate the shell itself.  For example, if either user types ^D (and
       the shell accepts this to be EOF), the shell terminates followed by <b>kibitz</b>.

       Normally, all characters are passed uninterpreted.  However, if  the  escape  character  (described  when
       <b>kibitz</b>  starts) is issued, the user may talk directly to the <b>kibitz</b> interpreter.  Any <b><a href="../man1/Expect.1.html">Expect</a></b>(1) or <b><a href="../man3/Tcl.3.html">Tcl</a></b>(3)
       commands may be given.  Also, job control may be used while in the interpreter, to, for example,  suspend
       or restart <b>kibitz</b>.

       Various  processes  can provide various effects.  For example, you can emulate a two-way <b><a href="../man1/write.1.html">write</a></b>(1) session
       with the command:

            kibitz user2 sleep 1000000

</pre><h4><b>ARGUMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>kibitz</b> takes arguments, these should also be separated by whitespace.

       The <b>-noproc</b> flag runs <b>kibitz</b> with no process underneath.  Characters are  passed  to  the  other  <b>kibitz</b>.
       This  is  particularly  useful  for  connecting  multiple  interactive processes together.  In this mode,
       characters are not echoed back to the typist.

       <b>-noescape</b> disables the escape character.

       <b>-escape</b> <u>char</u> sets the escape character.  The default escape character is ^].

       <b>-silent</b> turns off informational messages describing what kibitz is doing to initiate a connection.

       <b>-tty</b> <u>ttyname</u> defines the tty to which the invitation should be sent.

       If you start <b>kibitz</b> to user2 on a remote computer, <b>kibitz</b> performs a <b>rlogin</b> to the remote  computer  with
       your  current username. The flag <b>-proxy</b> <u>username</u> causes <b>rlogin</b> to use <u>username</u> for the remote login (e.g.
       if your account on the remote computer has a different username). If the <b>-proxy</b> flag is not given, <b>kibitz</b>
       tries to determine your current username by (in that order) inspecting the environment variables USER and
       LOGNAME, then by using the commands <b>whoami</b> and <b>logname</b>.

       The arguments <b>-noescape</b> and <b>-escape</b> can also be given by user2 when prompted to run <b>kibitz</b>.

</pre><h4><b>MORE</b> <b>THAN</b> <b>TWO</b> <b>USERS</b></h4><pre>
       The current implementation of kibitz explicitly understands only two users, however,  it  is  nonetheless
       possible  to have a three (or more) -way kibitz, by kibitzing another <b>kibitz</b>.  For example, the following
       command runs <b>kibitz</b> with the current user, user2, and user3:

            % kibitz user2 kibitz user3

       Additional users may be added by simply appending more "kibitz user" commands.

       The <b>xkibitz</b> script is similar to <b>kibitz</b> but supports the ability to add additional users (and drop  them)
       dynamically.

</pre><h4><b>CAVEATS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>kibitz</b>  assumes  the 2nd user has the same terminal type and size as the 1st user.  If this assumption is
       incorrect, graphical programs may display oddly.

       <b>kibitz</b> handles character graphics, but cannot handle bitmapped graphics.  Thus,

            % xterm -e kibitz    will work
            % kibitz xterm       will not work

       However, you can get the effect of the latter command by using <b>xkibitz</b> (see SEE ALSO below).  <b>kibitz</b> uses
       the same permissions as used by rlogin, rsh, etc.  Thus, you can only <b>kibitz</b> to users at hosts for  which
       you can rlogin.  Similarly, <b>kibitz</b> will prompt for a password on the remote host if rlogin would.

       If  you  <b>kibitz</b>  to users at remote hosts, <b>kibitz</b> needs to distinguish your prompt from other things that
       may precede it during login.  (Ideally, the end of it is preferred but any part should suffice.)  If  you
       have  an  unusual  prompt,  set  the  environment  variable  EXPECT_PROMPT  to  an <b><a href="../man1/egrep.1.html">egrep</a></b>(1)-style regular
       expression.  Brackets should be preceded with one backslash in ranges, and three backslashes for  literal
       brackets.  The default prompt r.e. is "($|%|#) ".

       <b>kibitz</b> requires the <b>kibitz</b> program on both hosts.  <b>kibitz</b> requires <b><a href="../man1/expect.1.html">expect</a></b>(1).

       By  comparison,  the <b>xkibitz</b> script uses the X authorization mechanism for inter-host communication so it
       does not need to login, recognize your prompt, or require kibitz on the remote  host.   It  does  however
       need permission to access the other X servers.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       An  early version of Sun's tmpfs had a bug in it that causes <b>kibitz</b> to blow up.  If <b>kibitz</b> reports "error
       flushing ...: Is a directory" ask Sun for patch #100174.

       If your Expect is not compiled with multiple-process support (i.e., you do not have a working  select  or
       poll), you will not be able to run kibitz.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       The  environment  variable SHELL is used to determine the shell to start, if no other program is given on
       the command line.

       If the environment variable EXPECT_PROMPT exists, it is taken as a regular expression which  matches  the
       end of your login prompt (but does not otherwise occur while logging in). See also CAVEATS above.

       If  the  environment  variables  USER or LOGNAME are defined, they are used to determine the current user
       name for a <b>kibitz</b> to a remote computer. See description of the <b>-proxy</b> option in ARGUMENTS above.
