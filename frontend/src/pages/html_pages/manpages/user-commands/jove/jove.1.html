       jove - an interactive display-oriented text editor

       <b>jove</b>  [ <b>-d</b> <u>directory</u> ] [ <b>-D</b> <u>debugfile</u> ] [ <b>-l</b> <u>libdir</u> ] [ <b>-s</b> <u>sharedir</u> ] [ <b>-ls</b> <u>bothdir</u> ] [ <b>-J</b> ] [ <b>-j</b> ] [ <b>-w</b><u>n</u>

       <b>jove</b> <b>-r</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       JOVE is Jonathan's Own Version of Emacs.  It is based on the original EMACS  editor  written  at  MIT  by
       Richard  Stallman.   Although JOVE is meant to be compatible with EMACS, there are some major differences
       between the two editors and you shouldn't rely on their behaving identically.

       JOVE works on any reasonable display terminal that is described in the <u>termcap</u> file (see  <a href="../man5/TERMCAP.5.html">TERMCAP</a>(5)  for
       more  details).  When you start up JOVE, it checks to see whether you have your <u>TERM</u> environment variable
       set.  On most systems that will automatically be set up for you, but if it's not JOVE will ask  you  what
       kind  of  terminal  you are using.  To avoid having to type this every time you run JOVE you can set your
       <u>TERM</u> environment variable yourself.  How you do this depends on which shell you are running.  If you  are
       running the C Shell, as most of you are, you type

            % setenv TERM <u>type</u>

       and with the Bourne Shell, you type

            $ TERM= <u>type</u> ; export TERM

       where  <u>type</u>  is  the name of the kind of terminal you are using (e.g., vt100).  If neither of these works
       get somebody to help you.

</pre><h4><b>INVOKING</b> <b>JOVE</b></h4><pre>
       If you run JOVE with no arguments you will be placed in an empty buffer,  called  <u>Main.</u>   Otherwise,  any
       arguments you supply are considered file names and each is ``given'' its own buffer.  Only the first file
       is  actually read in — reading other files is deferred until you actually try to use the buffers they are
       attached to.  This is for efficiency's sake: most of the time, when you run JOVE on a big list of  files,
       you end up editing only a few of them.

       The names of all of the files specified on the command line are saved in a buffer, called <u>*minibuf*.</u>  The
       mini-buffer  is a special JOVE buffer that is used when JOVE is prompting for some input to many commands
       (for example, when JOVE is prompting for a file name).  When you are being prompted for a file name,  you
       can  type  ^N  (that's  Control-N)  and  ^P to cycle through the list of files that were specified on the
       command line.  The file name will be inserted where you are typing and then you can edit  it  as  if  you
       typed it in yourself.

       JOVE recognizes the following switches:

       <b>-d</b> <u>dirname</u>
              <u>dirname</u>  is  taken to be the name of the current directory.  This is for systems that don't have a
              version of C shell that automatically maintains the  <u>CWD</u>  environment  variable.   If  <b>-d</b>  is  not
              specified  on  a  system  without  a  modified  C  shell, JOVE will have to figure out the current
              directory itself, and that can be slow.  You can simulate the modified  C  shell  by  putting  the
              following lines in your C shell initialization file (.cshrc):

                   alias cd        'cd \!*; setenv CWD $cwd'
                   alias popd      'popd \!*; setenv CWD $cwd'
                   alias pushd     'pushd \!*; setenv CWD $cwd'
              <b>-D</b> <u>debugfile</u>  <u>debugfile</u>  is  created  if missing, and some internal debug output is written to it.
              Only for developers (or filing with bug reports on interactive-shell misbehaviour)

       <b>-l</b> <u>libdir</u>
              Allows the user to specify the directory in which supporting programs (recover, portsrv)  required
              by  JOVE  can  be found (default /usr/lib/jove).  Within JOVE, this setting will be visible as the
              <u>lib-dir-pathname</u> variable.  If JOVE was built to fit on machines with very little memory,  without
              the  features  for post-crash recovery or interactive processes, then this option is not relevant.
              If <u>libdir</u> is a relative path, then the directory from which the running JOVE  binary  was  started
              will be prepended to it.

       <b>-s</b> <u>sharedir</u>
              Allows  the  user to specify the directory in which default initialization files, command help and
              primary JOVE tutorial can be found (default /usr/share/jove). Within JOVE, this  setting  will  be
              visible  as  the  <u>share-dir-pathname</u> variable.  If <u>sharedir</u> is a relative path, then the directory
              from which the running Jove binary was started will be prepended to it.

       <b>-ls</b> <u>bothdir</u>
              Allows the user to specify the directory in which binary files and initialization  files  required
              by JOVE can be found.  <b>-sl</b> is an alias for this option.

       <b>-J</b>     Inhibits reading of the system-wide initialization file (/usr/share/jove/jove.rc).

       <b>-j</b>     Inhibits reading of the user's initialization file (<a href="file:~/.joverc">~/.joverc</a>).

       <b>+</b><u>n</u>     Reads  the file designated by the following argument, and positions point at the <u>n'th</u> line instead
              of the (default) first line.  This can be specified more than once but it doesn't  make  sense  to
              use  it twice on the same file; in that case the second one wins.  If no numeric argument is given
              after the +, the point is positioned at the end of the file.

       <b>+/</b><u>pattern</u>
              Reads the file designated by the following argument, and positions point at the first match of the
              pattern.

       <b>-p</b> <u>file</u>
              Parses the error messages in <u>file</u>.  The error messages are assumed to be in a  format  similar  to
              the C compiler, LINT, or GREP output.

       <b>-t</b> <u>tag</u> Runs the <u>find-tag</u> command on <u>tag</u> (see <a href="../man1/ctags.1.html">ctags</a>(1)).

       <b>-T</b>     starts  JOVE  in  <u>teach-jove</u>  mode,  loading  the  JOVE  tutorial into a buffer (unsaved) with the
              filename <u><a href="file:~/teach-jove">~/teach-jove</a></u>.  This replaces the old <b>teachjove</b> command.

       <b>-w</b><u>n</u>    Divides the window into <u>n</u> windows (if <u>n</u> is omitted, it is taken to be 2).  Subsequent files in the
              list are read in and displayed in succeeding windows.

</pre><h4><b>RECOVERING</b> <b>BUFFERS</b> <b>AFTER</b> <b>A</b> <b>CRASH</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>-r</b> option of jove runs the JOVE recover program.  Use this when the system crashes, or JOVE  crashes,
       or  you  accidentally  get logged out while in JOVE.  If there are any buffers to be recovered, this will
       find them.

       Recover looks for JOVE buffers that are left around and are owned by  you.   (You  cannot  recover  other
       peoples'  buffers,  obviously.)   If there were no buffers that were modified at the time of the crash or
       there were but recover can't get its hands on them, you will be informed with  the  message,  ``There  is
       nothing  to recover.''  Otherwise, recover prints the date and time of the version of the buffers it has,
       and then waits for you type a command.

       To get a list of the buffers recover knows about, use the <u>list</u> command.  This will list all  the  buffers
       and  the  files and the number of lines associated with them.  Next to each buffer is a number.  When you
       want to recover a buffer, use the <u>get</u> command.  The syntax is <u>get</u> <u>buffer</u> <u>filename</u> where <u>buffer</u> is  either
       the  buffer's  name or the number at the beginning of the line.  If you don't type the buffer name or the
       filename, recover will prompt you for them.

       If there are a lot of buffers and you want to recover all of them, use the <u>recover</u>  command.   This  will
       recover  each  buffer  to  the name of the buffer with ``.#'' prepended to the name (so that the original
       isn't over-written).  It asks for each file and if you want to restore that buffer to that name you  type
       ``yes''.   If  you  want  to recover the file but to a different name, just type the new name in.  If you
       type ``no'' recover will skip that file and go on to the next one.

       If you want to look at a buffer before deciding to recover it, use the <u>print</u>  command.   The  syntax  for
       this is <u>print</u> <u>buffer</u> where <u>buffer</u> again is either its name or the number.  You can type ^C if you want to
       abort printing the file to the terminal, and recover will respond with an appropriate message.

       When  you're  done  and  have all the buffers you want, type the <u>quit</u> command to leave.  You will then be
       asked whether it's okay to delete the tmp files.  Most of the  time  that's  okay  and  you  should  type
       ``yes''.   When  you  say that, JOVE removes all traces of those buffers and you won't be able to look at
       them again.  (If you recovered some buffers they will still be around, so don't worry.)   So,  if  you're
       not  sure  whether  you've gotten all the buffers, you should answer ``no'' so that you'll be able to run
       recover again at a later time (presumably after you've figured out which ones  you  want  to  save).   If
       there were more than one crashed JOVE session, <u>quit</u> will move you on to dealing with the next one instead
       of exiting.

       If  you  type  ^C  at  any time other than when you're printing a file to the terminal, recover will exit
       without a word.  If you do this but wish you hadn't, just type ``jove -r'' to the shell  again,  and  you
       will be put back with no loss.

</pre><h4><b>GETTING</b> <b>HELP</b></h4><pre>
       Once  in  JOVE,  there are several commands available to get help.  To execute any JOVE command, you type
       ``&lt;ESC&gt; X command-name'' followed by &lt;Return&gt;.  To get a list of all the JOVE commands you  type  ``&lt;ESC&gt;
       X''  followed by ``?''.  The <u>describe-bindings</u> command can be used to get a list containing each key, and
       its associated command (that is, the command that gets executed when you type that key).  If you want  to
       save  the  list  of  bindings,  you can set the jove variable <u>send-typeout-to-buffer</u> to ON (using the <u>set</u>
       command), and then execute the <u>describe-bindings</u> command.  This will create a buffer and put  in  it  the
       bindings  list it normally would have printed on the screen.  Then you can save that buffer to a file and
       print it to use as a quick reference card.  (See VARIABLES below.)

       Once you know the name of a command, you can find out what it does  with  the  <u>describe-command</u>  command,
       which  you  can  invoke quickly by typing ``ESC ?''.  The <u>apropos</u> command will give you a list of all the
       command with a specific string in their names.  For example, if you want to know the  names  of  all  the
       commands that are concerned with windows, you can run ``apropos'' with the keyword <u>window.</u>

       If  the  initialization  file  has  provided  specific  keybindings  for your terminal, it should also be
       possible to view the keyboard layout with the keychart macro.

       If you're not familiar with the EMACS command set, it would be worth your while to use run TEACHJOVE.  Do
       do that, just type ``teachjove'' to your shell and you will be placed in JOVE in a  file  which  contains
       directions.  I highly recommend this for beginners; you may save yourself a lot of time and headaches.

</pre><h4><b>KEY</b> <b>BINDINGS</b> <b>and</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       You  can  alter the key bindings in JOVE to fit your personal tastes.  That is, you can change what a key
       does every time you strike it.  For example, by default the ^N key is bound to the command <u>next-line</u>  and
       so  when you type it you move down a line.  If you want to change a binding or add a new one, you use the
       <u>bind-to-key</u> command.  The syntax is ``bind-to-key &lt;command&gt; key''.

       You can also change the way JOVE behaves in little ways by changing the value of some variables with  the
       <u>set</u>  command.   The syntax is ``set &lt;variable&gt; value'', where value is a number or a string, or ``on'' or
       ``off'', depending on the context.  For example, if you want JOVE to  make  backup  files,  you  set  the
       ``make-backup-files''  variable  to ``on''.  To see the value of a variable, use the ``print &lt;variable&gt;''
       command.

</pre><h4><b>INITIALIZATION</b></h4><pre>
       JOVE first reads the system-wide initialization file (/usr/share/jove/jove.rc) which provides  reasonable
       defaults for your installation and loads standard macros.  It will normally observe your TERM environment
       variable  in order to provide terminal-specific key bindings and a map of your keyboard (see the standard
       ``keychart'' macro).

       JOVE  then  automatically  reads  further  commands  from  the  initialization  file  called  ``.joverc''
       (``jove.rc''  under  MSDOS)  in  your HOME directory.  In this file you can place commands that you would
       normally type in JOVE.  If you like to rearrange the key bindings and set some variables every  time  you
       get into JOVE, you should put them in your initialization file.  Here are a few lines from mine:
            set match-regular-expressions on
            1 auto-execute-command auto-fill /tmp/Re\|.*drft
            bind-to-key i-search-forward ^\
            bind-to-key i-search-reverse ^R
            bind-to-key find-tag-at-point ^[^T
            bind-to-key scroll-down ^C
            bind-to-key grow-window ^Xg
            bind-to-key shrink-window ^Xs
       (Note  that the Control Characters can be either two character sequences (e.g. ^ and C together as ^C) or
       the actual control character.  If you want to use an ^ by itself you must BackSlash it (e.g., bind-to-key
       grow-window ^X\^ binds grow-window to ``^X^'').

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       If the variable <b>LC_CTYPE</b> (see <b><a href="../man5/environ.5.html">environ</a></b>(5)) is not set in the environment, the operational behavior of JOVE
       for the <b>LC_CTYPE</b> locale category is determined by the value of the <b>LANG</b> environment variable.  If  <b>LC_ALL</b>
       is  set, its contents are used to override both the <b>LANG</b> and the <b>LC_CTYPE</b> variable.  If none of the above
       variables is set in the environment, the "C" (U.S. style) locale determines how JOVE behaves.

       <b>LC_CTYPE</b>
              Determines how JOVE handles characters. When <b>LC_CTYPE</b> is set to a valid value,  JOVE  can  display
              and  handle  text  and  filenames  containing  valid  characters  for  that locale. In particular,
              characters will be correctly recognised as  upper  or  lower  case  and  displayed  if  printable.
              However  JOVE  cannot  display or handle Extended Unix Code (EUC) characters which are more than 1
              byte wide.  In the "C" locale, only characters from 7-bit ASCII are valid (all characters with the
              eighth bit set being displayed in octal). In the "iso_8859_1" locale (if supported by the OS), the
              full Latin-1 alphabet is available. The JOVE variable ``lc-ctype''  can  be  used  to  change  the
              locale while JOVE is running.

</pre><h4><b>SOME</b> <b>MINOR</b> <b>DETAILS</b></h4><pre>
       You  should  type  ^\  instead  of  ^S in many instances.  For example, the way to search for a string is
       documented as being ``^S'' but in reality you should type  ``^\''.   This  is  because  ^S  is  the  XOFF
       character  (what  gets  sent  when  you  type  the  NO SCROLL key), and clearly that won't work.  The XON
       character is ``^Q'' (what gets sent when you type NO SCROLL again) which is documented as the way to do a
       quoted-insert.  The alternate key for this is ``^^'' (typed as ``^`'' on vt100's  and  its  look-alikes).
       If you want to enable ^S and ^Q and you know what you are doing, you can put the line:
            set allow-^S-and-^Q on
       in your initialization file.

       If  your  terminal  has a metakey and you turn on the ``meta-key'' variable, JOVE will use it to generate
       commands which would otherwise start with an ESC.  JOVE will automatically turn on  ``meta-key''  if  the
       METAKEY  environment  variable  exists.  This is useful for if you have different terminals (e.g., one at
       home and one at work) and one has a metakey and the other doesn't.  However, if a locale which recognises
       8-bit characters is in force, a metakey may be better used to generate the extra characters (so leave the
       ``meta-key'' variable off).
