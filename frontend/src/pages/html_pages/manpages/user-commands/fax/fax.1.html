</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       fax - make, send, receive, view or print a fax

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>fax</b> <b>help</b>

       <b>fax</b> <b>make</b> [<b>-l</b>] <u>file</u>

       <b>fax</b> <b>send</b> [<b>-l</b>] [<b>-v</b>] { <b>-m</b> | <u>number</u> } <u>filename</u>...

       <b>fax</b> [ <b>receive</b> [<b>-v</b>] [ <u>filename-prefix</u> ] ]

       <b>fax</b> { <b>print</b> | <b>view</b> | <b>rm</b> } <u>filename</u>...

       <b>fax</b> { <b>queue</b> | <b>status</b> [<u>t</u>] |  <b>start</b> | <b>stop</b> }

       <b>fax</b> <b>answer</b>

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-l</b>       use low (96 line per inch) resolution

       <b>-v</b>       display verbose messages for debugging

       <b>-m</b>       the phone call has already been dialed manually

       The commands make, send, receive, view and queue may be abbreviated to their first characters (e.g. ``fax
       q'').

       Assignments  of  the  form  <u>VARIABLE</u><b>=</b><u>value</u>  may  appear before the command name to temporarily change the
       values of most fax script variables (e.g. ``fax PAGE=a4 print letter.001'')

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>fax</b> provides a simple user interface to the <a href="../man1/efax.1.html">efax</a>(1) and <a href="../man1/efix.1.html">efix</a>(1) programs.  It allows you to send text  or
       Postscript  files  as  faxes and receive, print or preview received faxes.  The <b>fax</b> <b>help</b> command prints a
       summary of the possible commands.

       To send a fax, the original files need to be converted from ASCII or Postscript into a particular bit-map
       format (TIFF with Group 3 encoding).  This can be done automatically by the <b>fax</b> <b>send</b> command or  you  can
       use  the  <b>fax</b>  <b>make</b>  command to do the conversion before sending the fax.  The conversion will create one
       file per page.  These files will have the name of the original file with the page number as an additional
       suffix.  For example, running <b>fax</b> <b>make</b> <b>doc.ps</b> on the two-page postscript file doc.ps would  generate  the
       files doc.ps.001 and doc.ps.002.

       When  sending  a  fax with the <b>fax</b> <b>send</b> command you may dial the number manually and use the <b>-m</b> option or
       you may give the phone number on the command line.  The names of the files to be sent are  given  on  the
       command  line, usually by using wildcards.  For example, to send a multi-page fax consisting of the files
       doc.ps.001, doc.ps.002, and so on, you could use the command <b>fax</b> <b>send</b>  <b>555-1212</b>  <b>doc.ps.0*</b>  (if  you  had
       already  run  the <b>fax</b> <b>make</b> command) or simply <b>fax</b> <b>send</b> <b>555-1212</b> <b>doc.ps</b>.  If the number is busy the script
       will wait and try again.

       Use the <b>fax</b> <b>receive</b> command to answer the phone and receive a fax.  If  a  file  name  is  specified  the
       received fax will be stored in files with the given file name plus an extension equal to the page number.
       If  no  options  are  given, the received fax will be stored in files having a name given by the date and
       time and an extension equal to the page number.  For example, a fax  received  beginning  on  July  4  at
       3:05:20 pm will generate files 0704150520.001, 0704150520.002, and so on.

       The <b>fax</b> <b>print</b>, <b>fax</b> <b>view</b>, and <b>fax</b> <b>rm</b> commands are used to print, preview or remove received fax files.  As
       with the send command the file names are usually given using wildcards.

       If  efax  has  been  installed for automatic fax reception you can use the <b>fax</b> <b>queue</b> command to check for
       files in the incoming spool directory.  The fax script can also be configured to print received faxes  or
       e-mail  them  as  MIME  attachments  with  type image/tiff-f.  For convenience the <b>fax</b> <b>print</b>, <b>view</b> and <b>rm</b>
       commands will first check for the named files in this spool directory.  The <b>fax</b> <b>status</b> command shows  the
       status  of the automatic receive process once, or every <u>t</u> seconds.  Privileged users can use the <b>fax</b> <b>stop</b>
       and <b>fax</b> <b>start</b> commands to stop and restart the fax reception daemon.

       The <b>fax</b> <b>answer</b> command is used for  unattended  reception  of  faxes.   It  is  normally  placed  in  the
       <a href="../man5/inittab.5.html">inittab</a>(5) or <a href="../man5/ttytab.5.html">ttytab</a>(5) file and is run automatically by <a href="../man8/init.8.html">init</a>(8).

       The <b>-v</b> option displays verbose messages.

       Other features of the fax script are documented within the script:

       <b>-</b>  a directory that lets you specify recipients by name instead of number

       <b>-</b>  the <b>fax</b> <b>new</b> command to create a simple cover page and start up a text editor

       <b>-</b>  the <b>fax</b> <b>makefont</b> command converts a Postscript font to a bit-mapped font for use in headers or text

</pre><h4><b>RESOLUTION</b></h4><pre>
       Faxes  can  be  created at low (98 lines per inch) or high (196 lpi) resolution.  Almost all fax machines
       will operate at either resolution.  By default files are created at high resolution but you can  use  the
       optional <b>-l</b> argument to create files at low resolution.

</pre><h4><b>SESSION</b> <b>LOGS</b></h4><pre>
       The modem commands and responses together with status and error messages are written to file.  If the fax
       is successfully sent or received the log file is removed.  Otherwise a message is printed showing the log
       file name.  Please send a copy of this file when reporting problems with efax.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       The  fax  script will `source' the optional shell scripts <b>/etc/efax.rc</b>, <b><a href="file:~/.efaxrc">~/.efaxrc</a></b> and/or <b>./.efaxrc</b> before
       processing command-line arguments.  These files can be used to set script variables to custom values  for
       a particular system, user and/or directory.

       The  following  files  are  created in the FAXDIR spool directory when automatic fax reception is enabled
       (see the fax script).  DEV represents the name of the fax modem  device  file  in  <a href="file:/dev">/dev</a>  (e.g.  cua1  for
       /dev/cua1).

       DEV.<u>n</u>     the log file created by the fax answer daemon with process id <u>n</u>

       DEV.log   contains  collected  log  files  for  device  DEV.  Log files showing a termination status of 1
                 (device busy) or 4 (no response from modem) are not added to this file.

       DEV.stop  created by the fax stop command to prevent the fax daemon from starting up.
