       viewfax - display fax files in an X11 window

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>viewfax</b>   [<b>-fnluirvW24</b>]   [<b>-h</b><u>height</u>]  [<b>-w</b><u>width</u>]  [<b>-z</b><u>zoom</u>]  [<b>-d</b><u>display</u>]  [<b>-g</b><u>wxh+x+y</u>]  [<b>-b</b><u>bell</u>]  [<b>-m</b><u>memory</u>]
       <u>filename...</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>viewfax</b> displays one or more fax files in an X11 window.  The input files may be either raw,  single-page
       faxes  received  by  a  fax  modem  with a program such as <b><a href="../man1/mgetty.1.html">mgetty</a>(1),</b> or tiff files such as those used by
       <b>hylafax.</b>  The first (or only) page of "PC-Research"-style (DigiFAX) files  produced  by  the  <b>ghostscript</b>
       dfaxhigh or dfaxlow drivers can also be displayed.

       Input  files  using  any  common  fax  encoding  such as group 3 (1 and 2 dimensional) and group 4 can be
       displayed.

       The fax images are rendered at full resolution and then successively scaled down by a linear factor of  2
       prior  to display, until they fit on the screen.  The display can be controlled interactively using mouse
       and keyboard commands.  The left mouse button expands the image by a factor of two and the  right  button
       reduces  it  by the same factor.  If the image is bigger than the available window size, the middle mouse
       button can be used to reposition it within the window.  Hold down the middle button  while  dragging  the
       image to its new position.

       If the mouse has a scroll-wheel it can be used to move an oversized image vertically.  With the shift key
       depressed,  the  wheel scrolls through the pages.  The shift sense is inverted if <b>viewfax</b> is started with
       <b>-W</b> on the command-line.

       Further interaction is controlled by single-key commands:

       <b>h</b> <b>or</b> <b>Help</b>
              displays a page of help information.  Type 'q' to return to the original document.

       <b>p</b> <b>or</b> <b>Prior</b> <b>or</b> <b>PgUP</b> <b>or</b> <b>-</b> <b>or</b> <b>BackSpace</b>
              displays the previous page from the command-line list.

       <b>n</b> <b>or</b> <b>Next</b> <b>or</b> <b>PgDn</b> <b>or</b> <b>+</b> <b>or</b> <b>space</b>
              displays the next page from the command-line list.

       <b>Shift</b> <b>HOME</b>
              displays the first page from the command-line list.

       <b>Shift</b> <b>END</b>
              displays the last page from the command-line list.

       <b>z</b>      zoom in (same as right mouse button).

       <b>Shift</b> <b>Z</b>
              zoom out (same as left mouse button).

       <b>u</b>      turns the image upside down, which is useful if the fax was originally fed the wrong way into  the
              machine.

       <b>Shift</b> <b>U</b>
              turns this and all following pages upside down.

       <b>l</b>      turns the image through 90 degrees, to view landscape text.

       <b>Shift</b> <b>L</b>
              turns this and all following pages sideways.

       <b>m</b>      produce a left/right mirror image of the page.

       <b>Shift</b> <b>M</b>
              mirror this and all following pages.

       <b>cursor</b> <b>arrows</b>
              reposition the displayed image if it exceeds the window size.

       <b>HOME</b>   repositions so that the top left corner is visible.

       <b>END</b>    makes the bottom right corner visible.

       <b>Print</b>  if  the environment variable VIEWFAX_PRINT is defined, the current page is printed.  All pages are
              printed with Shift Print.

       <b>e</b>      if the environment variable VIEWFAX_EDIT is defined, the current page is  passed  to  the  editor.
              All input files can be edited with Shift e.

       <b>q</b>      terminates the program.

       <b>Shift</b> <b>Q</b>
              terminates  the program with non-zero exit status.  Can be used to abort a shell script, e.g. when
              the user is previewing an outbound fax and decides not to send it.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>viewfax</b> is designed to "do the right thing" when given just a filename.  Special  cases  can  be  handled
       with  the  following options.  (Note that tiff-files contain a header which overrides the <b>-f,</b> <b>-n,</b> <b>-h,</b> <b>-w,</b>
       <b>-l,</b> <b>-m,</b> and <b>-u</b> flags.)

       <b>-f</b>     indicates that raw input files are fine resolution (7.7 lines/mm)  faxes.   This  is  the  default
              unless the filename begins with "fn".  Tiff and "PC-Research" (DigiFAX) files are self-specifying.

       <b>-n</b>     indicates  that  raw  input  files  are normal resolution (3.85 lines/mm) faxes.  Each fax line is
              duplicated in the displayed image to give approximately equal vertical and horizontal scales.

       <b>-h</b><u>height</u>
              specifies the number of fax lines.  If this option is missing, <b>viewfax</b> counts the number of  lines
              in the input file.

       <b>-w</b><u>width</u>
              specifies the number of pixels in each scan-line.  The default value is 1728.

       <b>-l</b>     display in landscape mode.

       <b>-u</b>     turn the image upside down.

       <b>-i</b>     invert pixels (black/white).

       <b>-b</b>     preferred  warning  style:  'a'  for  audible bell (console beep), 'v' for visible bell (flash the
              window), 'n' for neither.  'v' is the default.

       <b>-d</b> <b>or</b> <b>-display</b>
              use specified X server

       <b>-g</b> <b>or</b> <b>-geometry</b>
              the preferred size and position of the window, specified as <u>width</u>x<u>height</u>+<u>x</u>+<u>y</u>.  If  a  position  is
              given  (x  and  y values), <b>viewfax</b> asks the window manager to place the window there.  The initial
              size of the window is constrained to be at most <u>width</u>x<u>height</u>.

              If the window is subsequently resized due to the user zooming in or out, the geometry is taken  as
              a constraint on the screen area which may be used by <b>viewfax.</b>

              If  you do not supply a geometry value, everything works fine with ICCCM-compliant window managers
              like <b>olwm,</b> <b>mwm,</b> <b>twm,</b> and <b>tvtwm</b>.  When fully zoomed out the <b>viewfax</b> window will occupy  the  entire
              screen.

              Users  of  <b>fvwm</b>  will  notice that the title bar and left border are moved off screen when <b>viewfax</b>
              repositions the window to (0,0).  A workaround is to use -geometry +5+23  when  using  <b>fvwm.</b>   The
              proper fix would be for someone to update the routine HandleConfigureRequest() in fvwm/events.c to
              correspond to the code in twm/events.c.

       <b>-m</b><u>memory</u> <u>limit</u>
              each page is kept in memory after being fetched and expanded, which saves time if the user returns
              to it in the same session.  To prevent viewfax from using all the available swap space, a limit is
              placed  on the total size of cached images.  This defaults to 4 MBytes, enough for about 6 typical
              pages.  If the memory limit is exceeded, old images are discarded and must be reloaded  from  disk
              if  the  user  returns  to  them.   The  operation of this mechanism is transparent apart from the
              occasional delays due to reloading.  The value specified on the command line can be suffixed <b>k</b>  or
              <b>m</b> for kilo- or megabytes.

       <b>-r</b>     the  bit  order of the bytes in the input file is reversed.  The fax specification deals only with
              serial data transmission.  Modem manufacturers have to  decide  whether  the  first  bit  received
              should  be  placed  in  the  most  significant  or  the least significant position in a byte.  The
              consensus is to pack most significant first, but the  -r  flag  is  available  to  deal  with  the
              opposite order.

       <b>-v</b>     produce some informative messages (verbose mode).

       <b>-z</b><u>zoom</u> specifies an initial zoom factor.  A full-scale fax will usually not fit on the screen.  If the <b>-z</b>
              option is not specified, <b>viewfax</b> scales the image by a power of 2 such that it is fully visible at
              a  reduced size.  The user can then use the mouse buttons (see above) to view expanded portions of
              the image.

       <b>-2</b>     Assume that raw input files use group 3 two dimensional coding.

       <b>-4</b>     Assume that raw input files use group 4 coding.  The number of fax lines (-h option)  is  required
              in this case.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>VIEWFAX_PRINT</b>
              Defines a command that will print one or more fax pages.

       <b>VIEWFAX_EDIT</b>
              Defines a command that will calls an editor on one or more fax pages.

       These  two  variables  are  optional.   If a variable is undefined, the corresponding keyboard command is
       ignored.  If the variable is defined, it should contain the name of a command or executable  script  that
       performs  the desired function.  The command should process a single page if called with a -p <u>page-number</u>
       argument.  Alternatively, if can be called with just a list of filenames, meaning that all  pages  should
       be processed.

       Here  is  an oversimplified example of a print command.  Note that it assumes that the format is tiff and
       will fail when handed a raw fax file.
         VIEWFAX_PRINT=printfax

         /usr/local/bin/printfax:
         #!<a href="file:/bin/sh">/bin/sh</a>
         case "$1" in
         -p) shift
             dopt=`expr $1 - 1`
             shift
             tiff2ps -d ${dopt} -2 -h 11.69 -w 8.27 "$1" | lp
             ;;
         *)  tiff2ps -2 -h 11.69 -w 8.27 "$*" | lp
             ;;
         esac

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       The user interface does not comply with any known style guide.
       The help text looks moth-eaten because it is encoded as a fax.  This avoids dealing with X11 fonts.
       The program does not refer to the X resources database.
