</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       fax2tiff - create a TIFF Class F fax file from raw fax data

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>fax2tiff</b> [ <u>options</u> ] [ <b>-o</b> <u>output.tif</u> ] <u>input.raw</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Fax2tiff</u>  creates  a  TIFF  file  containing CCITT Group 3 or Group 4 encoded data from one or more files
       containing ``raw'' Group 3 or Group 4 encoded data (typically obtained directly from a  fax  modem).   By
       default,  each  row of data in the resultant TIFF file is 1-dimensionally encoded and padded or truncated
       to 1728 pixels, as needed.  The resultant image is a set of low  resolution  (98  lines/inch)  or  medium
       resolution  (196 lines/inch) pages, each of which is a single strip of data.  The generated file conforms
       to the TIFF Class F (FAX) specification for storing facsimile data.  This means, in particular, that each
       page of the data does <b>not</b> include the trailing <u>return</u> <u>to</u> <u>control</u> (RTC) code; as required for transmission
       by the CCITT Group 3 specifications.  The old, ``classic'', format is created if the <b>-c</b> option  is  used.
       (The Class F format can also be requested with the <b>-f</b> option.)

       The default name of the output image is <u>fax.tif</u>; this can be changed with the <b>-o</b> option.  Each input file
       is  assumed  to  be  a  separate page of facsimile data from the same document.  The order in which input
       files are specified on the command line is the order in which the resultant pages appear  in  the  output
       file.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Options that affect the interpretation of input data are:

       <b>-3</b>     Assume input data is CCITT Group 3 encoded (default).

       <b>-4</b>     Assume input data is CCITT Group 4 encoded.

       <b>-U</b>     Assume input data is uncompressed (Group 3 or Group 4).

       <b>-1</b>     Assume  input data is encoded with the 1-dimensional version of the CCITT Group 3 Huffman encoding
              algorithm (default).

       <b>-2</b>     Assume input data is 2-dimensional version of the CCITT Group 3 Huffman encoding algorithm.

       <b>-P</b>     Assume input data is <b>not</b> EOL-aligned (default). This option has effect with Group 3 encoded  input
              only.

       <b>-A</b>     Assume input data is EOL-aligned. This option has effect with Group 3 encoded input only.

       <b>-M</b>     Treat input data as having bits filled from most significant bit (MSB) to most least bit (LSB).

       <b>-L</b>     Treat  input  data  as having bits filled from least significant bit (LSB) to most significant bit
              (MSB) (default).

       <b>-B</b>     Assume input data was encoded with black as 0 and white as 1.

       <b>-W</b>     Assume input data was encoded with black as 1 and white as 0 (default).

       <b>-R</b>     Specify the vertical resolution, in lines/inch, of the input images.  By default input are assumed
              to have a vertical resolution of 196 lines/inch.  If images are low resolution facsimile, a  value
              of 98 lines/inch should be specified.

       <b>-X</b>     Specify  the  width, in pixels, of the input images.  By default input are assumed to have a width
              of 1728 pixels.

       Options that affect the output file format are:

       <b>-o</b>     Specify the name of the output file.

       <b>-7</b>     Force output to be compressed with the CCITT Group 3 Huffman encoding algorithm (default).

       <b>-8</b>     Force output to be compressed with the CCITT Group 4 Huffman encoding.

       <b>-u</b>     Force output to be uncompressed (Group 3 or Group 4).

       <b>-5</b>     Force output to be encoded with the 1-dimensional version of the CCITT Group  3  Huffman  encoding
              algorithm.

       <b>-6</b>     Force  output  to  be encoded with the 2-dimensional version of the CCITT Group 3 Huffman encoding
              algorithm (default).

       <b>-a</b>     Force the last bit of each <u>End</u> <u>Of</u> <u>Line</u> (EOL) code to land  on  a  byte  boundary  (default).  This
              ``zero  padding'' will be reflected in the contents of the <u>Group3Options</u> tag of the resultant TIFF
              file. This option has effect with Group 3 encoded output only.

       <b>-p</b>     Do not EOL-align output. This option has effect with Group 3 encoded output only.

       <b>-c</b>     Generate "classic" Group 3 TIFF format.

       <b>-f</b>     Generate TIFF Class F (TIFF/F) format (default).

       <b>-m</b>     Force output data to have bits filled from most significant bit (MSB) to most least bit (LSB).

       <b>-l</b>     Force  output data to have bits filled from least significant bit (LSB) to  most  significant  bit
              (MSB) (default).

       <b>-r</b>     Specify  the  number  of  rows  (scanlines)  in each strip of data written to the output file.  By
              default (or when value <b>0</b> is specified), <u>tiffcp</u> attempts to set the rows/strip that no more than  8
              kilobytes  of  data  appear  in a strip (with except of G3/G4 compression schemes). If you specify
              special value <b>-1</b> it will results in infinite number of the rows per strip. The entire  image  will
              be the one strip in that case. This is default in case of G3/G4 output compression schemes.

       <b>-s</b>     Stretch the input image vertically by writing each input row of data twice to the output file.

       <b>-v</b>     Force <u>fax2tiff</u> to print the number of rows of data it retrieved from the input file.

       <b>-z</b>     Force output to be compressed with the LZW encoding.

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       The following warnings and errors come from the decoding routines in the library.

       <b>Warning,</b>  <b>%s:</b> <b>Premature</b> <b>EOL</b> <b>at</b> <b>scanline</b> <b>%d</b> <b>(x</b> <b>%d).\n</b>.  The input data had a row that was shorter than the
       expected width.  The row is padded with white.

       <b>%s:</b> <b>Premature</b> <b>EOF</b> <b>at</b> <b>scanline</b> <b>%d</b> <b>(x</b> <b>%d).\n</b>.  The decoder ran out of data in the  middle  of  a  scanline.
       The resultant row is padded with white.

       <b>%s:</b>  <b>Bad</b>  <b>code</b>  <b>word</b> <b>at</b> <b>row</b> <b>%d,</b> <b>x</b> <b>%d\n</b>.  An invalid Group 3 <u>code</u> was encountered while decoding the input
       file.  The row number and horizontal position is given.  The remainder of the  input  row  is  discarded,
       while the corresponding output row is padded with white.

       <b>%s:</b>  <b>Bad</b>  <b>2D</b>  <b>code</b>  <b>word</b>  <b>at</b> <b>scanline</b> <b>%d.\n</b>.  An invalid Group 4 or 2D Group 3 <u>code</u> was encountered while
       decoding the input file.  The row number and horizontal position is given.  The remainder  of  the  input
       row is discarded, while the corresponding output row is padded with white.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Input  data  are  assumed  to  have  a a ``top left'' orientation; it should be possible to override this
       assumption from the command line.
