</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       nhlf90 - Command for compiling Fortran code that uses the NCAR Graphics high-level utilities.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>nhlf90</b> [<b>-ngmath</b>] [<b>-ncarbd</b>] [<b>-ngmathbd</b>] [<b>-netcdf</b>] [<b>-hdf</b>] ...

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>nhlf90</u>  is  a  script that invokes the FORTRAN 90 compiler/linker with the proper NCAR Graphics LLU (low-
       level utility) and HLU (high-level utility) libraries.  Arguments presented  above  are  associated  with
       NCAR  Graphics.   All  other  arguments  and  options are identical to the f90 command on your particular
       machine; arguments that include quoted strings may have to be enclosed in single quotes.

       In order to run <u>nhlf90</u>, you must have your NCARG_ROOT environment variable set to the directory  pathname
       where  the NCAR Graphics libraries, binaries, and include files were installed.  If you are not sure what
       NCARG_ROOT should be set to, please check with your system administrator or the site  representative  for
       NCAR  Graphics.  If the NCAR Graphics libraries, binaries, and include files were not installed under one
       root directory,  then  you  will  need  to  set  the  environment  variables  NCARG_LIB,  NCARG_BIN,  and
       NCARG_INCLUDE instead.  Please see "man ncargintro" for more information.

       Note that, on some systems, if you supply your own binary libraries in addition to the ones automatically
       referenced by <u>nhlf90</u>, all the libraries must have been created in a similar fashion.

       <u>OPTIONS</u>

       -ngmath
              Links in the NCAR Graphics ngmath library.

       -ncarbd
              Use  this  option for compilers that appear to be having trouble initializing blockdata variables.
              It will cause a small subroutine to be linked  in  that  helps  force  the  loading  of  blockdata
              initialization routines.

       -ngmathbd
              Just  like with the <b>-ncarbd</b> option, use this option for compilers that appear to be having trouble
              initializing Ngmath-related blockdata variables. It will cause a small subroutine to be linked  in
              that helps force the loading of Ngmath blockdata initialization routines.

              Note: this option doesn't need to be specified separately if you are already including the <b>-ncarbd</b>
              and <b>-ngmath</b> options.

       -netcdf
              Links in the netCDF library.  This library is not part of NCAR Graphics, so check with your system
              administrator  if you need it installed.  You can obtain a copy of it by doing an anonymous ftp to
              unidata.ucar.edu.

       -hdf   Links in the HDF library.  This library is not part of NCAR Graphics, so check  with  your  system
              administrator  if you need it installed.  You can obtain a copy of it by doing an anonymous ftp to
              ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu.
