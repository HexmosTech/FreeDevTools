       latex2rtf - Convert a LaTeX file to an RTF file

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       latex2rtf [-hlpFSVW] [ -d# ] [ -D# ] [ -M# ]  [ -se#] [ -sf#] [ -t# ] [ -Z# ] [ -a <u>auxfile</u> ] [ -b <u>bblfile</u>
       ]  [ -C <u>codepage</u> ]  [ -i <u>language</u> ] [ -o <u>outputfile</u> ] [ -P <u>/path/to/cfg</u> ] [ -T <u>/path/to/tmp</u> ] [ <u>inputfile</u>
       ]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>latex2rtf</u> command converts a LaTeX file into RTF text format. The text and  much  of  the  formatting
       information is translated to RTF.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-a</b> <b>auxfile</b>
              Used  to specify a particular cross-referencing file.  When this option is omitted, the <u>auxfile</u> is
              assumed to be the same as <u>inputfile</u> with the .tex suffix replaced by .aux.

       <b>-b</b> <b>bblfile</b>
              Used to specify a particular bibliography file When this option is omitted, the <u>bblfile</u> is assumed
              to be the same as <u>inputfile</u> with the .tex suffix replaced by .bbl.

       <b>-C</b> <b>codepage</b>
              used to specify the character set (code page) used in the LaTeX document for non-ansi  characters.
              <u>codepage</u>  may  be  one  of  the following: ansinew, applemac, cp437, cp437de, cp850, cp852, cp855,
              cp865, cp866, decmulti, cp1250, cp1252, koi8-r, koi8-u, latin1, latin2,  latin3,  latin4,  latin5,
              latin9,  maccyr,  macukr,  next,  raw, raw437, raw852, raw1250, raw1251, and raw1253.  The default
              behavior is to use ansinew (same as cp1252).  For convenience, just the numbers 437,  437de,  850,
              852, 855, 866, 1250 or 1252 may be specified.

              The  raw  character set encoding prevents any 8-bit character translation.  The RTF file is marked
              to use the same encoding as the default encoding for the program interpreting the RTF file.   This
              is  particularly  useful  when  translating  a  file written in a language (e.g., czech) that maps
              poorly into the ansinew (western european) character set.

       <b>-d#</b>    Write extra debugging output to stderr.  Higher numbers cause more debugging output and range from
              0 (only errors) to 6 (absurdly many messages). The default is 1 (Warnings and Errors only).

       <b>-D</b> <b>dots_per_inch</b>
              Used to specify the number of dots per inch in equations that are converted  to  bitmaps  and  for
              graphics that must be converted.  Default is 300 dpi.

       <b>-E#</b>    where  #  selects the type of figure handling desired.  RTF does not support insertion of PS, PDF,
              or EPS file types.  These figures must be converted to a bitmap format  and  then  inserted.   One
              trick  is  to insert the filenames into the RTF file and then in post-processing, insert the file.
              These options can be added together.
              -E3 insert all figures (DEFAULT)
              -E0 no figures in the RTF
              -E1 insert figures having RTF-supported formats
              -E2 convert and insert unsupported figure formats
              -E4 insert only filenames for supported file formats
              -E8 insert only filenames for unsupported file formats

       <b>-f</b> <b>use</b> <b>fields</b>
              -f0 do not use fields in RTF.  This is handy when primitive RTF editors are being used to view the
              RTF output.
              -f1 use fields for equations but not \ref and \cite.
              -f2 use fields for \ref and \cite but not equations.
              -f3 use fields when possible.  This is the default and is most useful when the RTF file  is  being
              exported to be used in Word.  This retains the most information from the original LaTeX file.

       <b>-F</b>     use  LaTeX  to  create  bitmaps  for  all  figures.  This may help when figures are not translated
              properly.

       <b>-h</b>     Print a short usage note

       <b>-i</b> <b>language</b>
              used to set the idiom or language used in the LaTeX document <u>language</u> may be one of the  following
              afrikaans,  bahasa,  basque,  brazil,  breton,  catalan,  croatian, czech, danish, dutch, english,
              esperanto, estonian, finnish, french, galician, german, icelandic, irish,italian, latin, lsorbian,
              magyar, norsk, nynorsk, polish, portuges, romanian, russian,  samin,  scottish,  serbian,  slovak,
              slovene, spanish, swedish, turkish, usorbian, welsh.  The default is english.

       <b>-l</b>     Assume LaTeX source uses ISO 8859-1 (Latin-1) special characters (default behavior).

       <b>-o</b> <b>outputfile</b>
              Redirect  output to <u>outputfile</u> Unless an <u>outputfile</u> is specified with the -o option, the resulting
              RTF is produced in a file with .tex replaced by .rtf.

       <b>-M#</b>    where # selects the type of equation conversion.
              -M1 displayed equations to RTF
              -M2 inline equations to RTF
              -M4 displayed equations to bitmap
              -M8 inline equations to bitmap
              -M16 insert Word comment field containing the raw LaTeX equation
              -M32 insert raw LaTeX equation delimited by $...$ and \[...\]
              -M64 displayed equations to EPS files with filenames in RTF
              -M128 inline equations to EPS files with filenames in RTF

       These options may be added together to get different results
              -M0 no equations fields in the RTF.
              -M3 converts both inline and displayed equations to RTF (DEFAULT).
              -M12 converts inline and displayed equations to bitmaps.
              -M192 converts inline and displayed equations to eps files and inserts a tag in RTF.
              Bitmap conversion requires a working latex2png script.  Producing bitmaps is slow.

       <b>-p</b>     Escape printed parentheses in mathematical formulas, as some versions of Word (e.g Word 2000) have
              deep psychological problems with EQ fields  using  quoted  parentheses.   If  Word  displays  some
              formulas with parentheses as 'Error!', try this option.  See also the -S option.

       <b>-P</b> <b>/path/to/cfg</b>
              used to specify the directory that contains the @code{.cfg} files

       <b>-se#</b>   selects the scale for equation conversion, where # is the scale factor (default 1.00).

       <b>-sf#</b>   selects the scale for figure conversion, where # is the scale factor (default 1.00).

       <b>-S</b>     Use  semicolons  to separate arguments in RTF fields.  This is needed when the machine opening the
              RTF file has a version of Word that uses commas for decimal points.  This also can fix  displaying
              some formulas as 'Error!'  You may also need to try the -p option.

       <b>-t#</b>    selects the type of table conversion.
              -t1 convert tables to RTF (default)
              -t2 convert tables to bitmaps

       <b>-T</b> <b>/path/to/tmp</b>
              used to specify the folder where to put temporary files.

       <b>-V</b>     Prints version on standard output and exits.

       <b>-W</b>     Emit  warnings  directly  in  RTF  file.   Handy  for  catching  things that do not get translated
              correctly.

       <b>-Z#</b>    Add # close braces to end of RTF file.  (Handy when file is not converted correctly and  will  not
              open in another word processor.)

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       The  configuration  files  are  searched  first  in  any  directory specified by -P, then in the location
       specified by the environment variable  RTFPATH,  and  finally  in  the  location  CFGDIR  specified  when
       <u>latex2rtf</u>  was  compiled.   If  the  configuration  files  are  not  found  then  <u>latex2rtf</u>  aborts.  The
       configuration  files  allow  additional  fonts  to  be  recognized,  additional  simple  commands  to  be
       translation, and additional commands to be ignored.

</pre><h4><b>CAUTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  input  file  must  be  a  valid  LaTeX file. Use LaTeX to find and fix errors before converting with
       <u>latex2rtf.</u>

       The configuration files <b>direct.cfg</b> and <b>fonts.cfg</b> are in the correct directory.  You may  have  to  change
       <b>fonts.cfg</b> or <b>direct.cfg</b> to suit your needs.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Some might consider RTF to be a bug.

       Some environments are currently ignored.

       Translation without a LaTeX generated .aux file is poor.

</pre><h4><b>REPORTING</b> <b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Report  bugs  to  to  the bug tracking system at <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/latex2rtf/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/latex2rtf/</a>.  Only report
       bugs for the latest version of <u>latex2rtf</u> that is available.  Please identify your operating system.

       If the program produces wrong output or  does  not  work  for  you,  INCLUDE  A  SHORT  LATEX  FILE  that
       demonstrates  the  problem.   The  shorter  the LaTeX file, the quicker your bug will get addressed.  Bug
       reports with non-existent LaTeX files are not welcomed by the developers.  Do  not  bother  to  send  RTF
       files, since these are usually unhelpful.
