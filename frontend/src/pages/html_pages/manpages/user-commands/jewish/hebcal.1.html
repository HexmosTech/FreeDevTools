</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       With  no  arguments,  <b>hebcal</b> will print to stdout the dates of the Jewish holidays in the current secular
       year.  Each line is prefixed with a Gregorian date of the form mm/dd/yyyy.

       By specifying <u>month,</u> <u>day,</u> or <u>year,</u> output can be limited to a particular month or date  in  a  particular
       year.   Note  that  <u>year</u>  is usually a four-digit integer, so 92 is during the Roman period, not the late
       twentieth century.  If the Hebrew dates option is turned on, this number represents the  Jewish  calendar
       year.  <u>month</u> is a number from 1..12, or the name of a Jewish calendar month.  <u>day</u> is a number from 1..31.

       For example, the command

            hebcal 10 1992

       will print out the holidays occurring in October of 1992 C.E., while the command

            hebcal Tish 5752

       will print dates of interest in the month of Tishrei in Jewish calendar year 5752.

       Note:  hebcal  92  is  <u>not</u>  the  same  as hebcal 1992.  The year is assumed to be complete, so the former
       calendar precedes the latter by nineteen centuries.

       A few other bells and whistles include the weekly <u>sedra</u> as well as the day of the week, the count of  the
       <u>omer,</u> and the Hebrew date.

       Output from hebcal can be used to drive <a href="../man1/calendar.1.html">calendar</a>(1).  Day-to-day use for hebcal is provided for in the <b>-T</b>
       and <b>-t</b> switches, which print out Jewish calendar entries for the current date.

       To get a quick-reference online help, type

            hebcal help

       at the command prompt.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-8</b>     Use 8-bit Hebrew (ISO-8859-8-Logical).

       <b>-a</b>     Use Ashkenazi Hebrew.

       <b>-b</b> <u>mins</u>
              Set candle-lighting to occur <u>mins</u> minutes before sundown

       <b>-c</b>     Add <u>approximate</u> candle-lighting times.  See below.

       <b>-C</b> <u>city</u>
              Set latitude, longitude, and timezone according to <u>city</u>.  This option implies the <b>-c</b> option.

       <b>-d</b>     Print the Hebrew date for the entire date range.

       <b>-D</b>     Print the Hebrew date for dates with some events

       <b>-e</b>     Change the output format to European-style dates: dd.mm.yyyy

       <b>-E</b>     Output 24-hour times (e.g., 18:37 instead of 6:37)

       <b>-F</b>     Output the Daf Yomi for the entire date range

       <b>-g</b>     <b>--iso-8601</b> Emit ISO-8601 dates, i.e. YYYY-MM-DD

       <b>-h</b>     Suppress holidays in output.  User-defined calendar events are unaffected by this switch.

       <b>-H</b>     When  the  <b>-H</b>  switch  is  used,  all dates specified on the command line are assumed to be Hebrew
              dates.  So for instance,

                   example% hebcal -H 5754

              will print data for 5754, starting in Tishrei, and ending in Elul.   Hebcal  is  smart  enough  to
              detect a Hebrew month and infer that you want a Hebrew date range, so you could type

                   example% hebcal tish 5754

              The  <b>-H</b>  switch  would  be  superfluous  in this case.  Invoking hebcal with just the <b>-H</b> switch by
              itself will print data for the current Hebrew year, starting in Tishrei.

       <b>-i</b>     Use the Israeli sedra scheme when used in conjunction with <b>-S</b> or <b>-s.</b>  This has no effect if the <b>-S</b>
              or <b>-s</b> switches are unused.

       <b>-I</b> <u>file</u>
              Read extra events from <u>file.</u>  These events are printed regardless  of  the  <b>-h</b>  suppress  holidays
              switch.

              There is one holiday per line in <b>file,</b> each with the format

                   <u>month</u> <u>day</u> <u>description</u>

              where <u>month</u> is a string identifying the Jewish month in question <u>day</u> is a number from 1 to 30, and
              <u>description</u> is a newline-terminated string describing the holiday.  An example might be

                   Adar 1 Start cleaning kitchen for Passover.
                   Adar 1 Start cleaning kitchen for Passover.

       <b>-l</b> <u>deg</u><b>,</b><u>min</u>
              Set  the  latitude  for  solar  calculations  to <u>deg</u> degrees and <u>min</u> minutes.  Negative values are
              south.

       <b>-L</b> <u>deg</u><b>,</b><u>min</u>
              Set the longitude for solar calculations to <u>deg</u> degrees and <u>min</u> minutes.   Note:  Negative  values
              are <b>east.</b>

       <b>--lang</b> <u>lang</u>
              Display  calendar  in  the <u>lang</u> language, which must be specified as one of the ISO 639-1 codes of
              “ashkenazi”, “ashkenazi_litvish”, “ashkenazi_poylish”,  “ashkenazi_standard”,  “es”,  “fi”,  “fr”,
              “he”, “hu”, “pl”, “ru”

       <b>-m</b> <u>mins</u>
              Set havdalah to occur <u>mins</u> minutes after sundown

       <b>-M</b>     Print the molad on shabbat mevorchim

       <b>-o</b>     Add the count of the <u>omer</u> to the output.

       <b>-r</b>     Use  a  tab-delineated  format,  and somewhat terser strings.  Instead of saying “ 13th day of the
              omer ” hebcal will say “ Omer: 13 ”

       <b>-s</b>     Add the weekly <u>sedra</u> to the output on Saturdays.  See <b>-i.</b>

       <b>-S</b>     Add the weekly <u>sedra</u> to the output every day.  When this option is invoked, every time  a  day  is
              printed,  the torah reading for the Saturday on or immediately following that date is printed.  If
              there is no reading for the next Saturday, then nothing is printed.  See <b>-i.</b>

       <b>-t</b>     Print calendar information for today's date only.  <b>-d</b> and <b>-o</b> are asserted with this option.

       <b>-T</b>     Same as <b>-t</b>, only without the Gregorian date.  This option is useful in login scripts, just to  see
              what's happening today in the Jewish calendar.

       <b>-w</b>     Add the day of the week to the output.

       <b>-W</b>     Weekly view.  Omer, dafyomi, and non-date-specific zemanim are shown once a week, on the day which
              corresponds to the first day in the range.

       <b>-x</b>     Suppress Rosh Chodesh

       <b>-y</b>     Print only the last two digits of the year.

       <b>--years</b>  <b>n</b>
              Generate events for <u>n</u> years (default 1)

       <b>-Y</b> <u>file</u>
              Read a table of yahrtzeit dates from <u>file.</u>  These events are printed regardless of the <b>-h</b> suppress
              holidays switch.

              There is one death-date per line in <u>file,</u> each with the format

                   <u>month</u> <u>day</u> <u>year</u> <u>description</u>

              where  <u>month</u>, <u>day</u> and <u>year</u> form the  <b>Gregorian</b> date of death.  <u>description</u> is a newline-terminated
              string to be printed on the <u>yahrtzeit.</u>  An example might be

                   12 29 1957 Menachem Mendel's yahrtzeit.
                   5 15 1930 Benjamin's yahrtzeit.

       <b>-z</b> <u>timezone</u>
              Use the specified <u>timezone</u>, overriding the -C (localize to city) switch

       <b>-Z</b>     <b>(Experimental)</b> Add zemanim (Alot HaShachar; Misheyakir;  Kriat  Shema,  sof  zeman;  Tefilah,  sof
              zeman; Chatzot hayom; Mincha Gedolah; Mincha Ketanah; Plag HaMincha; Tzait HaKochavim)

</pre><h4><b>CANDLE-LIGHTING</b> <b>TIMES</b></h4><pre>
       Hebcal's  candlelighting  times  are  only  approximations.  If you ever have any doubts about its times,
       consult your local halachic authority.  If you enter geographic coordinates above the  arctic  circle  or
       below the antarctic circle, the times are guaranteed to be wrong.

       Hebcal  contains  a  small  database of cities with their associated geographic information and time-zone
       information.  The geographic and time information necessary to calculate sundown times can come to hebcal
       any of three ways:

       1)     The default: the system manager sets a default city when the program is compiled.

       2)     Hebcal looks in the environment variable <b>HEBCAL_CITY</b> for the name of a city in hebcal's  database,
              and if it finds one, hebcal will make that the new default city.

       3)     1  and 2 may be overridden by command line arguments, including those specified in the <b>HEBCAL_OPTS</b>
              environment variable.  The most natural way to do this is to use the <b>-c</b> <u>city</u> command.   This  will
              localize hebcal to <u>city.</u>  A list of the cities hebcal knows about can be obtained by typing

                   hebcal cities

              at the command prompt.  If the city you want isn't on that list, you can directly control hebcal's
              geographic information with the <b>-l,</b> <b>-L</b> <b>-z</b> switches.  Note that changing the geographic coordinates
              causes the timezone to default to UTC.

       For a status report on customizations, type type

            hebcal info

       at the command prompt.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       To find the days of the <u>omer</u> in 1997, printing the days of the week:

              example% hebcal -how 1997
              4/23/97 Wed, 1st day of the Omer
              4/24/97 Thu, 2nd day of the Omer
              4/25/97 Fri, 3rd day of the Omer
               .
               .
               .
              6/9/97 Mon, 48th day of the Omer
              6/10/97 Tue, 49th day of the Omer

       To print only the weekly <u>sedrot</u> of Nisan 5770

              example% hebcal -hs Nisan 5770
              3/20/2010 Parashat Vayikra
              3/27/2010 Parashat Tzav
              4/10/2010 Parashat Shmini

       To find out what's happening in the Jewish calendar today, use

              example% hebcal -TS
              19 of Nisan, 5752
              Parshat Achrei Mot
              Pesach V (CH"M)
              4th day of the Omer

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Hebcal</b> uses two environment variables:

       <b>HEBCAL_CITY</b>
              <b>Hebcal</b> uses this value as the default city for sunset calculations.  A list of available cities is
              available with from hebcal with the command:

                   hebcal cities

       <b>HEBCAL_OPTS</b>
              The  value  of  this  variable  is automatically processed as if it were typed at the command line
              <u>before</u> any other actual command-line arguments.

       The latest version of the code is available on the hebcal project homepage.

       The original motivation for the algorithms in this program was the <u>Tur</u> <u>Shulchan</u> <u>Aruch.</u>

       For version 3, much of the program was rewritten using Emacs 19's calendar routines by Edward M. Reingold
       and Nachum Dershowitz.  Their program is extremely clear and provides many instructive examples  of  fine
       calendar code in emacs LISP.

       A  well  written treatment of the Jewish calendar for the layman can be found in <u>Understanding</u> <u>the</u> <u>Jewish</u>
       <u>Calendar</u> by Rabbi Nathan Bushwick.  A more complete bibliography on the topic can be found there, as well
       as in the <u>Encyclopedia</u> <u>Judaica</u> entry on the calendar.

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>hebcal</b> <b>help</b>
              Prints a shorter version of this manpage, with comments on each option.

       <b>hebcal</b> <b>info</b>
              Prints the version number and default values of the program.

       <b>hebcal</b> <b>cities</b>
              Prints a list of cities which hebcal knows about, suitable as arguments to the <b>-C</b> <u>city</u> option.  If
              your city does not appear on this list, put the necessary defaults in the <b>HEBCAL_OPTS</b>  environment
              variable.

       <b>hebcal</b> <b>copying</b>
              Prints the GNU license, with information about copying the program.  See below.

       <b>hebcal</b> <b>warranty</b>
              Tells you how there's NO WARRANTY for hebcal.

</pre><h4><b>DISCLAIMER</b></h4><pre>
       This is just a program I wrote during summer school and while avoiding my senior project.  It should  not
       be invested with any sort of halachic authority.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Hebrew dates are only valid before sundown on that secular date.  An option to control this will be added
       in a later release.

       Negative longitudes are <u>east</u> of Greenwich.

       Some combinations of options produce weird results, e.g.,

            hebcal -dH nisan 5744
            hebcal -dH 5744

       This comes into play when you use the <b>HEBCAL_OPTS</b> environment variable.

       The  sunup/sundown  routines aren't accurate enough.  If you enter geographic coordinates above the artic
       circle or below the antarctic circle, the times are guaranteed to be wrong.

       Hebcal only translates between the Gregorian calendar and  the  Jewish  calendar.  This  means  that  the
       results  will be at least partly useless where and when the Gregorian calendar was not used, e.g., before
       1752 in Britain and before circa 1918 in Russia.  See the Wikipedia entry for “Daylight saving time”  for
       a  splendid  chart  depicting  when the changeover from the Julian to the Gregorian calendars occurred in
       various places.

       Hebcal cannot handle date computations before 2 C.E.  Sorry.
