</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       getpib - Qualcomm Atheros PIB Data Extractor

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>getpib</b> <u>file</u> <u>offset</u> <u>format</u> [<u>length</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This  program is a companion to program <b>setpib</b> and is designed to support shell scripts.  It extracts PIB
       file parameters so that a scripting language can evaluate, manipulate or store them with minimal  effort.
       Good scripting skills and some imagination may be required to make effective use of this program.

       Users  having  a detailed knowledge of PIB content and structure can make extremely effective use of this
       program; however, Atheros is under no obligation to provide customers with the offset, length  or  format
       of PIB file parameters.

       This program is part of the Qualcomm Atheros Powerline Toolkit.  See the <b>AMP</b> man page for an overview and
       installation instructions.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       - <b>c</b> <u>character</u>
              The  appended  character.  Append this character each line of output instead of newline.  Use this
              to create a comma separated list of value, for example, by specifying a comma.

       -<b>n</b>     Append a newline to the output.

       -<b>q</b>     Enable quiet mode which has no effect.

       -<b>v</b>     Verbose mode.  Does nothing.

       -<b>?</b>,--<b>help</b>
              Print program help summary on stdout.  This option takes precedence  over  other  options  on  the
              command line.

       -<b>!</b>,--<b>version</b>
              Print  program  version information on stdout.  This option takes precedence over other options on
              the command line.  Usethis option when sending screen dumps to Atheros Technical Support  so  that
              they know exactly which version of the Linux Toolkit you are using.

</pre><h4><b>ARGUMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>file</u>   The  PIB  filename.   This  argument  is  required  and must appear first on the command line.  No
              assumptions are made based on filename and no  filename  conventions  are  enforced;  however,  an
              invalid PIB file will be rejected.

       <u>offset</u> The  data offset in bytes expressed in hexadecimal.  This argument is required and must follow the
              filename.  A leading "<b>0x</b>" prefix is optional.  The data <u>offset</u> plus the data <u>length</u> cannot  exceed
              the file extent.

       <u>format</u> The  output  format.   This  argument  is required and must follow the offset.  Some formats imply
              fixed data length.  Others formats are for variable length data.  The fixed data formats are <b>byte</b>,
              <b>word</b>, <b>long</b>, <b>hfid</b>, <b>mac</b> and <b>key</b>.  The variable data formats are <b>data</b>  and  <b>text</b>.   The  formats  are
              described in the next section.

       <u>length</u> The  data  length  in bytes expressed in decimal.  This argument is only required for the the data
              formats <b>data</b> and <b>text</b>.  The data <u>offset</u> plus the data <u>length</u> cannot exceed the file  extent.   The
              data <u>length</u> cannot exceed <b>1024</b>.

</pre><h4><b>FORMATS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>byte</b>   Extract  1  byte  and  display it as an unsigned decimal integer value.  The offset advances  byte
              before starting another extraction.

       <b>word</b>   Extract 2 consecutive bytes and display them as an unsigned decimal  integer  value  after  endian
              conversion.  The offset advances  bytes before starting another extraction.

       <b>long</b>   Extract  4  consecutive  bytes  and display them as an unsigned decimal integer value after endian
              conversion.  The offset advances <b>4</b> bytes before starting another extraction.

       <b>huge</b>   Extract 8 consecutive bytes and display them as an unsigned decimal  integer  value  after  endian
              conversion.  The offset advances <b>8</b> bytes before starting another extraction.

       <b>xbyte</b>  Extract  1  byte  and display it as a hexadecimal integer value.  The offset advances  byte before
              starting another extraction.

       <b>xword</b>  Extract 2 consecutive bytes  and  display  them  as  a  hexadecimal  integer  value  after  endian
              conversion.  The offset advances  bytes before starting another extraction.

       <b>xlong</b>  Extract  4  consecutive  bytes  and  display  them  as  a  hexadecimal  integer value after endian
              conversion.  The offset advances <b>4</b> bytes before starting another extraction.

       <b>xhuge</b>  Extract 8 consecutive bytes  and  display  them  as  a  hexadecimal  integer  value  after  endian
              conversion.  The offset advances <b>8</b> bytes before starting another extraction.

       <b>data</b> <u>length</u>
              Extract the specified number of bytes and display them as a hexadecimal string with no punctuation
              to  separate  octets.   The  offset advances <u>length</u> bytes before starting another extraction.  The
              minimum length is <b>1</b>.  The maximum length is <b>1024</b>.

       <b>mac</b>    Extract 6 bytes and display them as a colon-separated hexadecimal string.  The offset  advances  6
              bytes  before  starting  another extraction.  This is similar to "<b>data</b> <b>6</b>" but colons separate each
              octet.

       <b>key</b>    Extract 16 bytes and display them as a colon-separated hexadecimal string.  The offset advances 16
              bytes before starting another extraction.  This is similar to "<b>data</b> <b>16</b>" but colons  separate  each
              octet.

       <b>hfid</b>   Extract 64 consecutive bytes and display them as an ASCII string that terminates at the first non-
              printable  character.   The  offset advances <b>64</b> bytes before starting another extraction.  This is
              equivalent to "<b>text</b> <b>64</b>".

       <b>skip</b> <u>length</u>
              Advance the specified number of bytes without displaying anything.  The offset advances by  <u>length</u>
              bytes before starting another extraction.  The minimum length is <b>1</b>.  The maximum length is <b>1024</b>.

       <b>text</b> <u>length</u>
              Extract  the  specified number of bytes and display them as an ASCII string that terminates at the
              first non-printable character.  The offset advances the specified number of bytes before  starting
              another extraction.

</pre><h4><b>TR-069</b></h4><pre>
       <b>accesspassword</b>
              Extract 65 consecutive bytes and display them as an ASCII string that terminates at the first non-
              printable  character.   The  offset  advances  <b>65</b>  bytes before starting another extraction.  This
              format is equivalent to "<b>text</b> <b>65</b>".

       <b>accessusername</b>
              Extract 33 consecutive bytes and display them as an ASCII string that terminates at the first non-
              printable character.  The offset advances <b>33</b>  bytes  before  starting  another  extraction.   This
              format is equivalent to "<b>text</b> <b>33</b>".

       <b>adminpassword</b>
              Extract 33 consecutive bytes and display them as an ASCII string that terminates at the first non-
              printable  character.   The  offset  advances  <b>33</b>  bytes before starting another extraction.  This
              format is equivalent to "<b>text</b> <b>33</b>".

       <b>adminusername</b>
              Extract 33 consecutive bytes and display them as an ASCII string that terminates at the first non-
              printable character.  The offset advances <b>33</b>  bytes  before  starting  another  extraction.   This
              format is equivalent to "<b>text</b> <b>33</b>".

       <b>password</b>
              Extract  257  consecutive  bytes  and display them as an ASCII string that terminates at the first
              non-printable character.  The offset advances <b>257</b> bytes before starting another extraction.   This
              format is equivalent to "<b>text</b> <b>257</b>".

       <b>url</b>    Extract  257  consecutive  bytes  and display them as an ASCII string that terminates at the first
              non-printable character.  The offset advances <b>257</b> bytes before starting another extraction.   This
              format is equivalent to "<b>text</b> <b>257</b>".

       <b>username</b>
              Extract  257  consecutive  bytes  and display them as an ASCII string that terminates at the first
              non-printable character.  The offset advances <b>257</b> bytes before starting another extraction.   This
              format is equivalent to "<b>text</b> <b>257</b>".

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       The  following  example  extracts  one  byte  from  offset <b>01F7</b> of PIB file <b>abc.pib</b> and displays it as an
       unsigned decimal integer string.  No length specification is  needed  because  the  <b>byte</b>  format  has  an
       implied  length of <b>1</b> byte.  The displayed value is <b>232</b> because the <b>byte</b> format is decimal.  We could have
       specified "<b>data</b> <b>1</b>" to display the byte in hexadecimal.  The return prompt appears  on  the  display  line
       because option <b>-n</b> was omitted.

          # getpib abc.pib 01F7 byte
          232#

       The  next  example extracts two bytes at offset <b>01F7</b> and displays them as a hexadecimal string.  A length
       of <b>2</b> is needed because the <b>data</b> format is variable length.  We could have  specified  "<b>word</b>"  to  display
       these bytes as an unsigned decimal integer string.  The hexadecimal string consists two octets <b>E8</b> and <b>8A</b>.
       The  first  byte  is the same one extracted in the last example.  The return prompt appears on a new line
       because option <b>-n</b> was present.

          # getpib abc.pib 01F7 data 2 -n
          E88A
          #
