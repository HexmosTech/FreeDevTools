</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       lprng_certs - lprng SSL certificate management

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>lprng_certs</b> <b>option</b>
        Options:
         init     - make directory structure
         newca    - make new root CA
         defaults - set new default values for certs
         gen      - generate user, server, or signing cert
         index [dir] - index cert files
         verify [cert] - verify cert file
         encrypt keyfile
                  - set or change keyfile password

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>lprng_certs</b> program is used to manage SSL certificates for the LPRng software.  There SSL certificate
       structure  consists  of a hierarchy of certificates.  The LPRng software assumes that the following types
       of certificates will be used:

       CA or root
              A top level or self-signed certificate.

       signing
              A certificate that can be used to sign other certificates.  This is  signed  by  the  root  CA  or
              another signing certificate.

       user   A certificate used by a user to identify themselves to the lpd server.

       server A certificate used by the <u>lpd</u> server to identify themselves to the user or other <u>lpd</u> servers.

</pre><h4><b>Signing</b> <b>Certificates</b></h4><pre>
       All  of the signing certificates, including the root certificate (root CA), /etc/lprng/ssl.ca/ca.crt, are
       in the same directory as the root CA file.  Alternately, all of the signing certs can be concatenated and
       put into a single file, which by convention is assumed to have  the  same  name  as  the  root  CA  file,
       /etc/lprng/ssl.ca/ca.crt.   The  <b>ssl_ca_file</b>,  <b>ssl_ca_path</b>,  and  <b>ssl_ca_key</b>  printcap  and configuration
       options can be used to specify the locations of the root CA files, a  directory  containing  the  signing
       certificate files, and the private key file for the root CA file respectively.

       The   root   certificate   (root   CA   file)   /etc/lprng/ssl.ca/ca.crt   has   a   private   key   file
       /etc/lprng/ssl.ca/ca.key as well.  By convention, the private keys  for  the  other  signing  certificate
       files are stored in the certificate file.

       The  OpenSSL software requires that this directory also contain a set of hash files which are, in effect,
       links to these files.

       By default, all signing certificates are assumed to be in the same directory as the root certificate.

</pre><h4><b>Server</b> <b>Certificates</b></h4><pre>
       The certificate used by the <u>lpd</u> server are kept in another directory.  These files do not  need  to  have
       hash  links  to  them.   By  convention,  the  private keys for these certificate files are stored in the
       certificate file.  The server certificate file is specified by the <b>ssl_server_cert</b> and  has  the  default
       value  /etc/lprng/ssl.server/server.crt.   This  file  contains  the  cert  and  private key.  The server
       certificate password  file is specified by the <b>ssl_server_password</b> option with the default value

       and contains the password used to decrypt the servers private key and use it  for  authentication.   This
       key file should be read only by the <u>lpd</u> server.

</pre><h4><b>User</b> <b>Certificates</b></h4><pre>
       The  certificates  used  by  users  are  kept  in  a  separate directory in the users home directory.  By
       convention, the private keys for these certificate files are stored in the certificate file.

       The user  certificate  file  is  specified  by  the  <b>LPR_SSL_FILE</b>  environment  variable,  otherwise  the
       <b>${HOME}/.lpr/client.crt</b>  is  used.  The password is taken from the file specified by the <b>LPR_SSL_PASSWORD</b>
       environment variable, otherwise the <b>${HOME}/.lpr/client.pwd</b> file is read.

</pre><h4><b>USING</b> <b>LPRNG_CERTS</b></h4><pre>
       The organization of the SSL certificates used by LPRng is similar to that used by other programs such  as
       the  <b>Apache</b>  <b>mod_ssl</b>  support.  The <b>lprng_certs</b> program is used to create the directory structure, create
       certificates for the root CA, signing, user and  servers.   In  order  to  make  management  simple,  the
       following support is provided.

</pre><h4><b>lprng_certs</b> <b>init</b></h4><pre>
       This  command  creates  the  directories  used by the lpd server.  It is useful when setting up a new <b>lpd</b>
       server.

</pre><h4><b>lprng_certs</b> <b>newca</b></h4><pre>
       This command creates a self-signed certificate, suitable for use as a root CA certificate.  It also  sets
       up a set of default values for other certificate creation.

</pre><h4><b>lprng_certs</b> <b>defaults</b></h4><pre>
       This command is used to modify the set of default values.

       The  default  values  are  listed  and  should  be  self-explanatory,  except for the value of the <b>signer</b>
       certificate.  By default, the root CA can be used to sign certificates.  However, a  signing  certificate
       can  be  used  as well.  This allows delegation of signing authority without compromising the security of
       the root CA.

</pre><h4><b>lprng_certs</b> <b>gen</b></h4><pre>
       This is used to generate a user, server, or signing certificate.

</pre><h4><b>lprng_certs</b> <b>index</b></h4><pre>
       This is used to create the indexes for the signing certificates.

</pre><h4><b>lprng_certs</b> <b>verify</b> <b>[cert]</b></h4><pre>
       This checks the certificate file using the Openssl <b>openssl</b> <b>verify</b> command.

</pre><h4><b>lprng_certs</b> <b>encrypt</b> <b>keyfile</b></h4><pre>
       This removes all key information from the key file, reencrypts the key  information,  and  the  puts  the
       encrypted key information in the file.

</pre><h4><b>LPRng</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Option                   Purpose
       ssl_ca_path              directory holding the SSL signing certs
       ssl_ca_file              file holding the root CA or all SSL signing certs
       ssl_server_cert          cert file for the server
       ssl_server_password      file containing password for server server
       ${HOME}/.lpr/client.crt  client certificate file
       ${HOME}/.lpr/client.pwd  client certificate private key password

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       LPR_SSL_FILE             client certificate file
       LPR_SSL_PASSWORD         client certificate private key password

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       The following exit values are returned:

       <b>zero</b> <b>(0)</b>       Successful completion.

       <b>non-zero</b> <b>(!=0)</b> An error occurred.
