</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       htop, pcp-htop - interactive process viewer

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>htop</b> [<b>-dCFhpustvH</b>]
       <b>pcp-htop</b> [<b>-dCFhpustvH</b>] [<b>--host/-h</b> <b>host</b>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>htop</b> is a cross-platform ncurses-based process viewer.

       It is similar to <b>top</b>, but allows you to scroll vertically and horizontally, and interact using a pointing
       device  (mouse).   You  can  observe  all  processes running on the system, along with their command line
       arguments, as well as view them in a tree format, select multiple processes and act on them all at once.

       Tasks related to processes (killing, renicing) can be done without entering their PIDs.

       <b>pcp-htop</b> is a version of <b>htop</b> built using the Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) Metrics  API  (see  <b><a href="../man1/PCPIntro.1.html">PCPIntro</a></b>(1),
       <b><a href="../man3/PMAPI.3.html">PMAPI</a></b>(3)),  allowing  to  extend  <b>htop</b>  to  display values from arbitrary metrics.  See the section below
       titled <b>CONFIG</b> <b>FILES</b> for further details.

</pre><h4><b>COMMAND-LINE</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.

       <b>-d</b> <b>--delay=DELAY</b>
              Delay between updates, in tenths of a second. If the delay value is less than 1, it  is  increased
              to  1,  i.e.  1/10 second. If the delay value is greater than 100, it is decreased to 100, i.e. 10
              seconds.

       <b>-C</b> <b>--no-color</b> <b>--no-colour</b>
              Start <b>htop</b> in monochrome mode

       <b>-F</b> <b>--filter=FILTER</b>
              Filter processes by terms matching the commands. The terms are  matched  case-insensitive  and  as
              fixed strings (not regexs). You can separate multiple terms with "|".

       <b>-h</b> <b>--help</b>
              Display a help message and exit

       <b>-p</b> <b>--pid=PID,PID...</b>
              Show only the given PIDs

       <b>-s</b> <b>--sort-key</b> <b>COLUMN</b>
              Sort  by  this column (use --sort-key help for a column list).  This will force a list view unless
              you specify -t at the same time.  Sorting in tree mode applies to  the  direct  children  of  each
              process.

       <b>-u</b> <b>--user=USERNAME|UID</b>
              Show only the processes of a given user

       <b>-U</b> <b>--no-unicode</b>
              Do not use unicode but ASCII characters for graph meters

       <b>-M</b> <b>--no-mouse</b>
              Disable support of mouse control

       <b>--readonly</b>
              Disable all system and process changing features

       <b>-V</b> <b>--version</b>
              Output version information and exit

       <b>-t</b> <b>--tree</b>
              Show  processes  in  tree view. This can be used to force a tree view when requesting a sort order
              with -s.

       <b>-H</b> <b>--highlight-changes=DELAY</b>
              Highlight new and old processes

       <b>--drop-capabilities[=off|basic|strict]</b>
              Linux only; this option needs to have been enabled at compile-time and requires libcap support  at
              runtime.
              Drop  unneeded  Linux  capabilities.   In  strict  mode  features  like  killing, changing process
              priorities  and  reading  process  delay  accounting  information  will  not  work  due  to  fewer
              capabilities being held.

</pre><h4><b>INTERACTIVE</b> <b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       The following commands are supported while in <b>htop</b>:

       <b>Tab,</b> <b>Shift-Tab</b>
            Select  the  next / the previous screen tab to display.  You can enable showing the screen tab names
            in the Setup screen (F2).

       <b>Up,</b> <b>Alt-k</b>
            Select (highlight) the previous process in the process list. Scroll the list if necessary.

       <b>Down,</b> <b>Alt-j</b>
            Select (highlight) the next process in the process list. Scroll the list if necessary.

       <b>Left,</b> <b>Alt-h</b>
            Scroll the process list left.

       <b>Right,</b> <b>Alt-l</b>
            Scroll the process list right.

       <b>PgUp,</b> <b>PgDn</b>
            Scroll the process list up or down one window.

       <b>Home</b> Scroll to the top of the process list and select the first process.

       <b>End</b>  Scroll to the bottom of the process list and select the last process.

       <b>Ctrl-A,</b> <b>^</b>
            Scroll left to the beginning of the process entry (i.e. beginning of line).

       <b>Ctrl-E,</b> <b>$</b>
            Scroll right to the end of the process entry (i.e. end of line).

       <b>Space</b>
            Tag or untag a process. Commands that can operate on multiple  processes,  like  "kill",  will  then
            apply over the list of tagged processes, instead of the currently highlighted one.

       <b>c</b>    Tag  the  current  process  and  its children. Commands that can operate on multiple processes, like
            "kill", will then apply over the list of tagged processes, instead of the currently highlighted one.

       <b>U</b>    Untag all processes (remove all tags added with the Space or c keys).

       <b>s</b>    Trace process system calls: if <a href="../man1/strace.1.html">strace</a>(1) is installed, pressing this  key  will  attach  it  to  the
            currently selected process, presenting a live update of system calls issued by the process.

       <b>l</b>    Display  open  files for a process: if <a href="../man1/lsof.1.html">lsof</a>(1) is installed, pressing this key will display the list
            of file descriptors opened by the process.

       <b>w</b>    Display the command line of the selected process in a separate screen, wrapped onto  multiple  lines
            as needed.

       <b>x</b>    Display the active file locks of the selected process in a separate screen.

       <b>F1,</b> <b>h,</b> <b>?</b>
            Go to the help screen

       <b>F2,</b> <b>S</b>
            Go  to  the setup screen, where you can configure the meters displayed at the top of the screen, set
            various display options, choose among color schemes, and select  which  columns  are  displayed,  in
            which order.

       <b>F3,</b> <b>/</b>
            Incrementally  search  the  command  lines  of  all  the displayed processes. The currently selected
            (highlighted) command will update as you type. While in search mode, pressing F3 will cycle  through
            matching occurrences.  Pressing Shift-F3 will cycle backwards.

            Alternatively  the  search can be started by simply typing the command you are looking for, although
            for the first character normal key bindings take precedence.

       <b>F4,</b> <b>\</b>
            Incremental process filtering: type in part of a process command line and only processes whose names
            match will be shown. To cancel filtering, enter the Filter option again and press Esc.  The matching
            is done case-insensitive. Terms are fixed strings (no regex).  You can separate multiple terms  with
            "|".

       <b>F5,</b> <b>t</b>
            Tree  view:  organize  processes  by  parenthood,  and  layout the relations between them as a tree.
            Toggling the key will switch between tree and your previously selected sort view. Selecting  a  sort
            view will exit tree view.

       <b>F6,</b> <b>&lt;,</b> <b>&gt;</b>
            Selects  a  field for sorting, also accessible through &lt; and &gt;.  The current sort field is indicated
            by a highlight in the header.

       <b>F7,</b> <b>]</b>
            Increase the selected process's priority (subtract from 'nice' value).  This can only be done by the
            superuser.

       <b>F8,</b> <b>[</b>
            Decrease the selected process's priority (add to 'nice' value)

       <b>Shift-F7,</b> <b>}</b>
            Increase the selected process's autogroup priority (subtract from autogroup 'nice' value).  This can
            only be done by the superuser.

       <b>Shift-F8,</b> <b>{</b>
            Decrease the selected process's autogroup priority (add to autogroup 'nice' value)

       <b>F9,</b> <b>k</b>
            "Kill" process: sends a signal which is selected in a menu, to one  or  a  group  of  processes.  If
            processes  were  tagged,  sends the signal to all tagged processes.  If none is tagged, sends to the
            currently selected process.

       <b>F10,</b> <b>q</b>
            Quit

       <b>I</b>    Invert the sort order: if sort order is increasing, switch to decreasing, and vice-versa.

       <b>+,</b> <b>-,</b> <b>*</b>
            When in tree view mode, expand or collapse subtree. When a subtree is collapsed a "+" sign shows  to
            the  left  of  the  process name.  Pressing "*" will expand or collapse all children of PIDs without
            parents, so typically PID 1 (init) and PID 2 (kthreadd on Linux, if kernel threads are shown).

       <b>a</b> <b>(on</b> <b>multiprocessor</b> <b>machines)</b>
            Set CPU affinity: mark which CPUs a process is allowed to use.

       <b>u</b>    Show only processes owned by a specified user.

       <b>N</b>    Sort by PID.

       <b>M</b>    Sort by memory usage (top compatibility key).

       <b>P</b>    Sort by processor usage (top compatibility key).

       <b>T</b>    Sort by time (top compatibility key).

       <b>F</b>    "Follow" process: if the sort order causes the currently selected process to move in the list,  make
            the  selection  bar  follow  it.  This  is useful for monitoring a process: this way, you can keep a
            process always visible on screen. When a movement key is used, "follow" loses effect.

       <b>K</b>    Hide kernel threads: prevent the threads belonging the kernel to be displayed in the  process  list.
            (This is a toggle key.)

       <b>H</b>    Hide  user  threads:  on  systems  that  represent them differently than ordinary processes (such as
            recent NPTL-based systems), this can hide threads from userspace  processes  in  the  process  list.
            (This is a toggle key.)

       <b>O</b>    Hide  containerized  processes: prevent processes running in a container from being displayed in the
            process list. (This is a toggle key.)

       <b>p</b>    Show full paths to running programs, where applicable. (This is a toggle key.)

       <b>Z</b>    Pause/resume process updates.

       <b>m</b>    Merge exe, comm and cmdline, where applicable. (This is a toggle key.)

       <b>Ctrl-L</b>
            Refresh: redraw screen and recalculate values.

       <b>Numbers</b>
            PID search: type in process ID and the selection highlight will be moved to it.

</pre><h4><b>COLUMNS</b></h4><pre>
       The following columns can display data about each process. A value of '-' in all the rows indicates  that
       a column is unsupported on your system, or currently unimplemented in <b>htop</b>.  The names below are the ones
       used  in the "Available Columns" section of the setup screen. If a different name is shown in <b>htop</b>'s main
       screen, it is shown below in parenthesis.

       <b>Command</b>
            The full command line of the process (i.e. program name and arguments).

            If the option 'Merge exe, comm and cmdline in Command' (toggled by  the  'm'  key)  is  active,  the
            executable path (<a href="file:/proc/">/proc/</a>[pid]/exe) and the command name (<a href="file:/proc/">/proc/</a>[pid]/comm) are also shown merged with
            the command line, if available.

            The  program  basename  is  highlighted  if set in the configuration. Additional highlighting can be
            configured for stale executables (cf. EXE column below).

            The Command column should be the last column in each screen as can get very long  and  profits  from
            being able to extend its length dynamically.

       <b>COMM</b> The command name of the process obtained from <a href="file:/proc/">/proc/</a>[pid]/comm, if readable.

            Requires Linux kernel 2.6.33 or newer.

       <b>EXE</b>  The  abbreviated  basename  of  the  executable  of  the  process, obtained from <a href="file:/proc/">/proc/</a>[pid]/exe, if
            readable. htop is able to read this file on  linux  for  ALL  the  processes  only  if  it  has  the
            capability CAP_SYS_PTRACE or root privileges.

            The basename is marked in red if the executable used to run the process has been replaced or deleted
            on  disk  since  the  process  started.  The  information  is obtained by processing the contents of
            <a href="file:/proc/">/proc/</a>[pid]/exe.

            Furthermore the basename is marked in yellow if any library is reported as having been  replaced  or
            deleted  on disk since it was last loaded. The information is obtained by processing the contents of
            <a href="file:/proc/">/proc/</a>[pid]/maps.

            When deciding the color the  replacement  of  the  main  executable  always  takes  precedence  over
            replacement  of  any  other  library.  If  only  the  memory map indicates a replacement of the main
            executable, this will show as if any other library had been replaced or deleted.

            This additional color markup can be configured in the "Display Options" section of the setup screen.

            Displaying EXE requires CAP_SYS_PTRACE and PTRACE_MODE_READ_FSCRED.

       <b>PID</b>  The process ID.

       <b>STATE</b> <b>(S)</b>
            The state of the process:
               <b>S</b> for sleeping
               <b>I</b> for idle (longer inactivity than sleeping on platforms that distinguish)
               <b>R</b> for running
               <b>D</b> for disk sleep (uninterruptible)
               <b>Z</b> for zombie (waiting for parent to read its exit status)
               <b>T</b> for traced or suspended (e.g by SIGTSTP)
               <b>W</b> for paging

       <b>PPID</b> The parent process ID.

       <b>PGRP</b> The process's group ID.

       <b>SESSION</b> <b>(SID)</b>
            The process's session ID.

       <b>TTY</b>  The controlling terminal of the process.

       <b>MINFLT</b>
            The number of page faults happening in the main memory.

       <b>CMINFLT</b>
            The number of minor faults for the process's waited-for children (see MINFLT above).

       <b>MAJFLT</b>
            The number of page faults happening out of the main memory.

       <b>CMAJFLT</b>
            The number of major faults for the process's waited-for children (see MAJFLT above).

       <b>UTIME</b> <b>(UTIME+)</b>
            The user CPU time, which is the amount of time the process has spent executing on the  CPU  in  user
            mode (i.e. everything but system calls), measured in clock ticks.

       <b>STIME</b> <b>(STIME+)</b>
            The  system  CPU  time,  which  is the amount of time the kernel has spent executing system calls on
            behalf of the process, measured in clock ticks.

       <b>CUTIME</b> <b>(CUTIME+)</b>
            The children's user CPU time, which is the amount of time the  process's  waited-for  children  have
            spent executing in user mode (see UTIME above).

       <b>CSTIME</b> <b>(CSTIME+)</b>
            The  children's  system  CPU time, which is the amount of time the kernel has spent executing system
            calls on behalf of all the process's waited-for children (see STIME above).

       <b>PRIORITY</b> <b>(PRI)</b>
            The kernel's internal priority for the process, usually just its nice value plus  twenty.  Different
            for real-time processes.

       <b>NICE</b> <b>(NI)</b>
            The  nice  value of a process, from 19 (low priority) to -20 (high priority). A high value means the
            process is being nice, letting others have a higher  relative  priority.  The  usual  OS  permission
            restrictions for adjusting priority apply.

       <b>STARTTIME</b> <b>(START)</b>
            The time the process was started.

            process's executable instructions).

       <b>M_LRS</b> <b>(LIB)</b>
            The library size of the process.

       <b>M_SWAP</b> <b>(SWAP)</b>
            The size of the process's swapped pages.

       <b>M_PSS</b> <b>(PSS)</b>
            The  proportional  set  size, same as M_RESIDENT but each page is divided by the number of processes
            sharing it.

       <b>M_M_PSSWP</b> <b>(PSSWP)</b>

       <b>PERCENT_CPU</b> <b>(CPU%)</b>
            The  percentage  of  the  CPU  time that the process is currently using.  This is the default way to
            represent CPU usage in Linux. Each process can consume up to 100% which means the full  capacity  of
            the core it is running on. This is sometimes called "Irix mode" e.g. in <b><a href="../man1/top.1.html">top</a></b>(1).

       <b>PERCENT_NORM_CPU</b> <b>(NCPU%)</b>
            The  percentage of the CPU time that the process is currently using normalized by CPU count. This is
            sometimes called "Solaris mode" e.g. in <b><a href="../man1/top.1.html">top</a></b>(1).

       <b>PERCENT_MEM</b> <b>(MEM%)</b>
            The percentage of memory the process is currently using (based  on  the  process's  resident  memory
            size, see M_RESIDENT above).

       <b>USER</b> The username of the process owner, or the user ID if the name can't be determined.

            On  Linux  the  username  is highlighted if the process has elevated privileges, i.e. if it has been
            started from binaries with file capabilities set or retained Linux  capabilities,  via  the  ambient
            set, after switching from the root user.

       <b>TIME</b> <b>(TIME+)</b>
            The  time,  measured  in  clock ticks that the process has spent in user and system time (see UTIME,

       <b>SYSCW</b> <b>(WR_SYSC)</b>
            The number of <a href="../man2/write.2.html">write</a>(2) syscalls for the process.

       <b>RBYTES</b> <b>(IO_RBYTES)</b>
            Bytes of <a href="../man2/read.2.html">read</a>(2) I/O for the process.

</pre><h4><b>EXTERNAL</b> <b>LIBRARIES</b></h4><pre>
       While  <b>htop</b> depends on most of the libraries it uses at build time there are two noteworthy exceptions to
       this rule. These exceptions both relate to data displayed in meters displayed in the header of  <b>htop</b>  and
       were  intentionally  created  as  optional  runtime dependencies instead.  These exceptions are described
       below:

       <b>libsystemd</b>
              The bindings for libsystemd are used in the SystemD  meter  to  determine  the  number  of  active
              services and the overall system state. Looking for the functions to determine these information at
              runtime  allows  for builds to support these meters without forcing the package manager to install
              these libraries on systems that otherwise don't use systemd.

              Summary: no build time dependency, optional runtime dependency on <b>libsystemd</b> via dynamic  loading,
              with <b><a href="../man1/systemctl.1.html">systemctl</a>(1)</b> fallback.

       <b>libsensors</b>
              The  bindings  for libsensors are used for the CPU temperature readings in the CPU usage meters if
              displaying the temperature is enabled through the setup screen. In order for <b>htop</b>  to  show  these
              temperatures   correctly   though,   a  proper  configuration  of  libsensors  through  its  usual
              configuration files is assumed and that all CPU cores correspond to temperature sensors  from  the
              <b>coretemp</b>  driver  with core 0 corresponding to a sensor labelled "Core 0". The package temperature
              may be given as "Package id 0". If missing it is inferred as the maximum value from the  available
              per-core readings.

              Summary:  build  time  dependency  on <b><a href="../man3/libsensors.3.html">libsensors</a>(3)</b> C header files, optional runtime dependency on
              <b><a href="../man3/libsensors.3.html">libsensors</a>(3)</b> via dynamic loading.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIG</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       By default  <b>htop</b>  reads  its  configuration  from  the  XDG-compliant  path  <u><a href="file:~/.config/htop/htoprc">~/.config/htop/htoprc</a></u>.   The
       configuration  file is overwritten upon clean exit by <b>htop</b>'s in-program Setup configuration, so it should
       not be hand-edited.  If no user configuration exists <b>htop</b> tries to  read  the  system-wide  configuration
       from <u>/etc/htoprc</u> and as a last resort, falls back to its hard coded defaults.

       You  may  override  the location of the configuration file using the $HTOPRC environment variable (so you
       can have multiple configurations for different machines that share the same home directory, for example).

       The <b>pcp-htop</b> utility makes use of <u>htoprc</u> in a similar way.  However,  <b>pcp-htop</b>  reads  its  configuration
       from  a  path  more  conventionally  used  by Performance Co-Pilot tools, <u><a href="file:~/.pcp/htop/htoprc">~/.pcp/htop/htoprc</a></u>, in order to
       provide separate configuration when both <b>htop</b> and <b>pcp-htop</b> are installed and in use.   <b>pcp-htop</b>  supports
       additional  configuration  files below the same directory allowing new meters, columns and screen tabs to
       be added via the Setup screen (F2).  This displays additional  Available  Meters,  Available  Column  and
       Screen Tabs for each meter, column or screen configuration file.

       These  <b>pcp-htop</b>  configuration files are read once at startup.  The format of these files is described in
       detail in the <b><a href="../man5/pcp-htop.5.html">pcp-htop</a></b>(5) manual page.

       This functionality makes available many thousands of Performance Co-Pilot metrics  for  display  by  <b>pcp-</b>
       <b>htop</b>,  as  well  as  the  ability  to display custom metrics added at individual sites.  Applications and
       services instrumented using the OpenMetrics format <b>https://openmetrics.io</b> can also be displayed  by  <b>pcp-</b>
       <b>htop</b> if the <b><a href="../man1/pmdaopenmetrics.1.html">pmdaopenmetrics</a></b>(1) component is configured.

       The  configuration  for  both <b>htop</b> and <b>pcp-htop</b> is only saved when a clean exit is performed. Sending any
       signal will cause <u>all</u> <u>configuration</u> <u>changes</u> <u>to</u> <u>be</u> <u>lost.</u>

</pre><h4><b>MEMORY</b> <b>SIZES</b></h4><pre>
       Memory sizes in <b>htop</b> are displayed in a human-readable form.  Sizes are printed in powers of  1024  using
       binary  IEC  units.   If  no suffix is shown the units are implicitly K as in KiB (kibibyte, 1 KiB = 1024
       bytes).

       The decision to use this convention was made in order to conserve  screen  space  and  make  memory  size
       representations  consistent  throughout  <b>htop</b> as allocations are granular to full memory pages (4 KiB for
       most platforms).
