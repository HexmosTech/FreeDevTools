</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       gramophone2 -  GRAMophone is an algorithmic generator of music composition.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSYS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>gramophone2</b> [-c|-d] sourcefile [midifile]

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>-c</u>     is an option allowing you to control the syntax of the source without generating music.

       <u>-d</u>     is  an option allowing you to activate debug mode, with video output of the composition and player
              parameters plus the generated notes.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       In GRAMophone, the music is generated using two kinds of formal grammar: Chomsky's  regular  grammar  (or
       Type  3)  for  a  TOP DOWN approach to the composition and a reduced version of Lindenmayer grammar for a
       BOTTOM UP approach.

</pre><h4><b>BASIC</b> <b>CONCEPT</b> <b>OF</b> <b>GRAMophone</b></h4><pre>
       GRAMophone is partly based on an idea of Jon McCormack's, who invented  the  idea  of  a  virtual  player
       (virtual  musician).  The player in question is associated with a MIDI track, and interprets instructions
       telling it what to do.  Generally, they  say  play  notes  (send  MIDI  messages).  GRAMophone's  players
       together make up an orchestra, which plays a composition.

       Any  number  of  players  can play a composition, but in practice the hardware used might impose an upper
       limit.

       In general every player plays an instrument and each has a different set of grammar rules.  An individual
       player is characterised by a set of parameters which are shared by the whole orchestra and/or a  personal
       parameter set.

       The orchestra's parameters consist of:

              the kind of grammar used (Chomsky or Lindenmayer);

              the metronome;

              the measure;

              the number of iterations used in the production process.

       Each individual player's parameters consist of:

              the kind of grammar used (Chomsky or Lindenmayer);

              the instrument;

              the MIDI channel associated with the player;

              the number of iterations used in the production process;

       A player's notes have a current state consisting of:

              octave

              volume

              duration

              release

       These  characteristics  can  be controlled parametrically by a player declaring its associated variables.
       GRAMophone, then, allows  for  the  non-deterministic  generation  of  music,  using  either  Chomsky  or
       Lindenmayer grammar.

</pre><h4><b>GUIDE</b> <b>TO</b> <b>GRAMophone</b></h4><pre>
       "Give Me A" (The "Hello, World!" for GRAMophone")

       To  introduce  you to the basic ideas, here is the simplest algorithmic composition that can be generated
       with GRAMophone: this composition simply generates the note A and is presented through both  the  Chomsky
       and Lindenmayer methods.

       composition "Give Me A" of "Schroeder" {

         //this composition generates the A note with the Chomsky grammar

         grammar chomsky
         tempo 120
         time_signature 4/4
         %
         player Schroeder {
           instrument 0
           %
           @composition-&gt;A[,,,];
         }
       }

       composition "Give Me A" of "Schroeder" {
         //this composition generates the A note with the Lindenmayer grammar
         grammar lindenmayer
         tempo 120
         time_signature 4/4
         %
         player Schroeder {
           instrument 0
           %
           axiom-&gt;A[,,,];
         }
       }

       THE KEYWORDS composition E of

       All  compositions  must  begin  with  the  keyword  composition followed by a string (in inverted commas)
       containing the name of the composition. This must be followed by  the  keyword  of  then  another  string
       containing the copyright of the piece.

       THE COMPOSITION BLOCK

       The  composition  block  is placed in brackets. It is subdivided into three sections: one section defines
       parameters of the composition, one declares and initiates any global variables and an  orchestra  section
       where  the  players  who will 'play' the piece are defined. The first two sections are separated by the %
       symbol.

       THE player KEYWORD

       Each player is defined with the keyword player, followed by an identifier.

       THE player BLOCK

       The player block is placed in brackets and is divided  into  three  sections:  one  section  defines  the
       parameters  of  the track associated with the player, one declares any local variables for the player and
       one is for the formal rules. The first two sections are separated by the % symbol.

       COMMENTS

       In GRAMophone, comments are C-like: they must begin with  the  character  pair  '/*'  and  end  with  the
       character  pair '*<a href="file:/.">/.</a>' There must be no space between the asterisk and the slash. Everything between these
       pairs of symbols will be ignored by the GRAMophone parser.  Whole lines of comments may also be included.
       Lines of comments begin with the symbol // and end at the  end  of  the  line,  as  in  the  two  initial
       examples.

       Section defining the composition's parameters

       The parameters shared by all the orchestra's players are declared here. The parameters that may be
       declared are:

              grammar

              resolution

              iterations

              tempo

              time_signature

       This section must end with the % symbol.

       grammar

       This  parameter  is  obligatory and defines the kind of grammar to be used in the generation. This can be
       either chomsky or lindenmayer.

       resolution

       This parameter defines the number of time units of 1/4 duration. If omitted, the default value  480  will
       be used.

       iterations

       This  parameter  defines the number of iterations contained in the generation. Its meaning depends on the
       kind of grammar chosen, as explained below. If omitted, the default value 1 will be used.

       tempo

       This parameter defines the composition's rhythm. If omitted, the default value 120 will be used.

       time_signature

       This parameter defines the composition's measure. If omitted, the default value 4/4 will be used.

       Section declaring the composition's global variables

       The variables control the parameters of a note's attributes, as explained below.

       Section defining the player's parameters

       Each player's personal parameters and variables are declared here. The personal parameters that may be
       declared are:

              instrument

              channel

              iterations

              This section must end with the % symbol.

              instrument

       This parameter indicates the player's instrument type. GRAMophone's instrument set is the same as that of
       General MIDI. The acceptable range of values is 0 to 127; there are therefore 128 instruments to choose
       from. A table showing the instrument codes appears below:

       This parameter defines which Midi channel will be associated with  the  player.  There  are  16  possible
       channels.  Channel  10 is reserved for percussion instruments. If omitted, the default channel value 1 is
       used.

       iterations

       This parameter defines the number of iterations in the generation. Its meaning depends  on  the  kind  of
       grammar  chosen,  as  explained  below.  If the iterations parameter has been included in the composition
       declarations, the latter declaration will be ignored.

       Section declaring the player's local variables

       The variables control the parameters of a note's attributes, as explained below.

       Notes in GRAMophone

       HOW NOTES ARE WRITTEN DOWN IN GRAMophone

       Notes are the first category of terminal symbols GRAMophone.

       GRAMophone uses the English notation for notes:

                   A B C D E F G

       The names of notes must be written in capital letters.  The flat and sharp symbols are represented by 'b'
       and '#' respectively; no space should appear between these symbols and the name of the note: A#, Gb, etc.

       NOTE ATTRIBUTES

       Notes can have four attributes  in  GRAMophone:  octave,  velocity,  duration  and  release.  The  octave
       attribute  varies between -2 and 8, while the velocity and release attributes vary from 0 to 127.  If the
       note is written without attributes, then the following default values are used:  3  for  octave,  64  for
       velocity  and  release. The current default value for duration is a crotchet. In the example, "Give me A"
       is written simply as A[,,,]. This means that an A is generated at the third octave, with  a  duration  of
       1/4 and a velocity and release of 64.

       DEFINING THE ATTRIBUTES OF A NOTE

       The  attributes of a note are defined by writing them inside the square brackets which follow the name of
       the note, without spaces. A note can have four attributes at most and each attribute type may  have  only
       one value.

       The attributes must be defined in the following order:

              octave

              velocity

              duration

              release

       If all three attributes are not defined, the default value is used for the missing ones.

       Here are some examples of notes with attributes:

              C[2,  50+60/2,  240*4,]  -  plays a C at the second octave, with a velocity of 80, duration of 960
              (minim with a resolution of 480) and a release of 64 (default value);

              Db[4,,,] - plays a  D flat at the fourth octave, using the default values for  velocity,  duration
              and release;

              F#[,,,] - use the default values for all the attributes;

       Incorrect examples are:

              Db[3, 127, 960, 64, x] - too many attributes (x is a variable).

       PAUSE

       Pauses  are  another  category  of terminal symbol in GRAMophone.  They are indicated by the letter R and
       only take a duration type attribute. If unspecified, the default resolution value is used. Attributes are
       defined in the same way as for notes.

       Here are some examples of pauses:

              R[480/2] - pause with a duration of 240;

              R[] - use the default value for the attribute of type duration.

       CHORDS

       Chords are the final category of terminal symbol used in GRAMophone. A chord is a series of notes  played
       simultaneously. In GRAMophone, notes played in a chord are enclosed between two '^' symbols.

       Here are some examples of chords:

              ^C[,,,]E[,,,]G[,,,]^ - plays a C major chord, using each note's default values.

              ^A[2,80,240,]C[2,,240,]E[2,,240,]^  -  plays an A minor chord with duration 1/8, with all notes at
              the second octave and velocity 64 (default value), with the first note of the chord played with  a
              velocity of 80 and the remaining two at a velocity of 64 (default value).

       THE ROLE OF R IN COMPLEX CHORDS

            The  notes  of  a chord do not always have the same duration. For example it is possible that, while
       the note C[2,,1920,] of duration 4/4 is playing, the musician has to play four crotchets in the following
       order: C[,,,], E[,,,], G[,,,], Bb[,,,]. There has to be a  way  of  telling  GRAMophone  that  the  notes
       C[2,,1920,]  and  C[,,,] must start at the same time, that E[,,,] must begin after a pause of 1/4, G[,,,]
       after 2/4 and Bb[,,,] after 3/4. In GRAMophone this is written as follows:

       ^C[2,,1920,]C[,,,]R[]E[,,,]R[960]G[,,,]R[1440]Bb[,,,]^

       In other words, every note in the chord can be preceded by a pause definition representing  the  time  to
       wait  before  playing the note.       It does not matter which order you write the notes down in a chord.
       The chord in the example above can also be written:

       ^R[]E[,,,]C[2,,1920,]R[1440]Bb[,,,]C[,,,]R[960]G[,,,]^

       IDENTIFIERS

       Some of GRAMophone's language entities, variables, macros and non-terminal symbols in Chomsky grammar for
       example, must have names by which they can be identified. These names  are  called  identifiers  and  are
       chosen  by  the  composer.   GRAMophone's  identifiers  follow  the  system  of  identifiers  used in the
       programming language Pascal. In fact an identifier is made up of a  letter  followed  by  a  sequence  of
       letters or digits. GRAMophone's identifiers must also be written in lower case.

       Chomsky Grammar

       NON-TERMINAL SYMBOLS

       In  Chomsky  grammar  non-terminal  symbols  are  used  to  give  a  structure  or 'style' to the musical
       composition. They are written with an '@' immediately followed by an identifier. The Chomsky grammar used
       by GRAMophone is context free so the head of the production can only be a non-terminal.

       THE NON-TERMINAL SYMBOL @composition

       This non-terminal symbol, which corresponds to the final composition of a single player, is obligatory.

       PRODUCTION OPERATOR

       This is defined by the character sequence '-&gt;' and separates the head of the production from the body.

       BODY OF THE PRODUCTION

       This may contain sequences of  terminal  (notes,  pauses  and  chords)  and  non-terminal  symbols.  Each
       production must end with a semi-colon.

       | (OR) OPERATOR

       A  production  may  be  non-deterministic:  in  other  words  it  may  present two or more choices during
       generation. The body of a non-deterministic production is made up of the various choices separated by the
       | operator. For example

       @non_det-&gt;A[,,,]B[,,,]@Seq1|^A[,,,]B[,,,]C[,,,]^@Seq2R[]C[,,,];

       is a non-deterministic production.

       MEANING OF ITERATION IN CHOMSKY GRAMMAR

       In Chomsky grammar a production may  include  cycles,  i.e.  production  bodies  containing  non-terminal
       symbols that refer to the production actually being produced. For example:

       @Sequenza1-&gt;B[,,,]A[,,,]C[,,,]@Sequenza1;

       To  avoid  an  infinite  loop during generation, the non-terminal symbol @Sequenza1 is processed an equal
       number of times to the iterations parameter.

       Lindenmayer Grammar

       Lindenmayer grammar only deals with terminal symbols and GRAMophone's version can be context-free or work
       in a polyphonic context. Therefore, single notes or chords can appear at the head of the production.  All
       productions are separated by a semi-colon.

       AXIOM

       This is the initial production from which generation begins. It is obligatory.  PRODUCTION OPERATOR

       This is defined by the character sequence '-&gt;' and separates the head of the production from the body.

       | (OR) OPERATOR

       A  production  may  be  non-deterministic:  in  other  words  it  may  present two or more choices during
       generation. The body of a non-deterministic production is made up of the various choices separated by the
       | operator. For example

       A[,,,]-&gt;A[,,,]B[,,,]|C[,,,]D[,,,];

       is a non-deterministic production.

       MEANING OF ITERATIONS IN LINDENMAYER GRAMMAR

       At each step all the grammar's productions are simultaneously applied to the note string.  In  this  case
       the iterations parameter represents the number of steps to be carried out.

       Use of variables

       DECLARATION AND INITIALISATION OF VARIABLES

       GRAMophone is able to control the attributes of a note parametrically through the use of variables. These
       variables  are  declared  in  the player's declaration section and may be of the following types: octave,
       velocity, duration and msb. A variable  is  declared  by  writing  its  type  followed  by  one  or  more
       identifiers  separated by a comma. The declaration must end with a semi-colon. A player's identifier must
       be declared only once.

       The following are correct declarations:

              velocity x, y;

              octave oct, z;

              duration w;

       The following are incorrect declarations:

              velocity x, x;

              octave z;

              duration z;

       Following the declaration section and before the grammar it is possible to initialise variables by  means
       of the = operator.

       The following is an example of declaration and initialisation:

              velocity x;

              x=0;

       USING VARIABLES WITH NOTES

       Variables are used in note attribute expressions. GRAMophone controls the types within expressions, so it
       is not possible to add an octave variable to a velocity variable, for example.

       The following is an example of a note variable:

              velocity x;

              duration z, w;

              A[4,x,z+w,].

       EXAMPLE
       composition "Crescendo" of "Schroeder" {

         //this composition generates 64 A notes with a growing velocity

         grammar chomsky
         tempo 120
         time_signature 4/4
         iterations 64
         %
         player Schroeder {
           instrument 40
           %
           velocity x=0;

           @composition-&gt;A[,x=x+1,,]@composition;
         }
       }

       CONDITIONS

       In  both  Chomsky  and  Lindenmayer grammars it is possible to define conditions for the variables in the
       production body. If the condition is true, the production is executed; otherwise it is not.  A  condition
       is  defined  immediately  after the name of the production by means of the '?' symbol, followed by one or
       more Boolean expressions.

       The Boolean operators are:

              !         not

              &amp;&amp;        and

              ||        or

       The relational operators are:

              ==        uguale

              !=        diverso

              &lt;         minore

              &gt;         maggiore

              &lt;=        minore o uguale

              &gt;=        maggiore o uguale

       The following is an example of a conditional production.

       @battuta?x!=0-&gt;A[,x=x-10,,]@battuta;

       which means: while x is not equal to zero, generate the @battuta production; otherwise do not.

       Discography, GRAMophone's library

       GRAMophone is able to include external libraries, called discographies. To include  a  discography  in  a
       source  file, use the keyword discography followed by its file name. A discography can be included at any
       point in the source file, as long as its contents match the position of the  source  where  it  has  been
       included.

       Macros

       Macros  can  be defined using the keyword define, followed by a lower-case identifier and a string placed
       in inverted commas. Macros must be defined at  the  beginning  of  the  source  composition,  before  the
       composition  keyword. For example, in order to simply write a instead of A[,,,], the following macro must
       be defined: define a "A[,,,]"

       Functions in GRAMophone

       THE repeat() FUNCTION

       The repeat() function takes an msb type value plus a Chomsky or  Lindenmayer  sequence.  It  enables  the
       included sequence to be repeated a number of times that is equal to the msb type value.

       THE rand() FUNCTION

       The  rand()  function  takes an expression and returns a random value which is less than the value of the
       expression.

       Melodic operators in GRAMophone

       transpose()

       The transpose() operator takes an msb type value plus a Chomsky or Lindenmayer sequence. It  generates  a
       sequence in which all the notes in the relevant sequence are transposed by a number of semitones equal to
       the msb type value.

       inversion()

       The  inversion()  operator  takes a Chomsky or Lindenmayer sequence. It generates a sequence in which the
       intervals between the first and the other notes in the sequence taken are calculated in reverse.

       retrograde()

       The retrograde() operator takes a Chomsky or Lindenmayer sequence. It generates a sequence which  is  the
       contrary of the sequence inserted.
