</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       fierce - DNS scanner that helps locate non-contiguous IP space and hostnames against specified domains.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>fierce</b>  [-h]  [--domain DOMAIN] [--connect] [--wide] [--traverse TRAVERSE] [--search SEARCH [SEARCH ...]]
       [--range  RANGE]  [--delay  DELAY]  [--subdomains  SUBDOMAINS   [SUBDOMAINS   ...]   |   --subdomain-file
       SUBDOMAIN_FILE] [--dns-servers DNS_SERVERS [DNS_SERVERS ...] | --dns-file DNS_FILE] [--tcp]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Fierce  is  a  semi-lightweight  scanner  that helps locate non-contiguous IP space and hostnames against
       specified domains. It's really meant as a pre-cursor to nmap, OpenVAS, nikto, etc,  since  all  of  those
       require  that you already know what IP space you are looking for.  This does not perform exploitation and
       does not scan the whole internet indiscriminately. It is meant specifically to locate likely targets both
       inside and outside a corporate network.  Because it uses DNS primarily you will often find mis-configured
       networks that leak internal address space. That's especially  useful  in  targeted  malware.   Originally
       written  by RSnake along with others at <a href="http://ha.ckers.org/">http://ha.ckers.org/</a>.  This is simply a conversion to Python 3 to
       simplify and modernize the codebase.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
         -h, --help            show this help message and exit
         --domain DOMAIN       domain name to test
         --connect             attempt HTTP connection to non-RFC 1918 hosts
         --wide                scan entire class c of discovered records
         --traverse TRAVERSE   scan IPs near discovered records, this won't enter adjacent class c's
         --search SEARCH [SEARCH ...]
                               filter on these domains when expanding lookup
         --range RANGE         scan an internal IP range, use cidr notation
         --delay DELAY         time to wait between lookups
         --subdomains SUBDOMAINS [SUBDOMAINS ...]
                               use these subdomains
         --subdomain-file SUBDOMAIN_FILE
                               use subdomains specified in this file (one per line)
         --dns-servers DNS_SERVERS [DNS_SERVERS ...]
                               use these dns servers for reverse lookups
         --dns-file DNS_FILE   use dns servers specified in this file for reverse lookups (one per line)
         --tcp                 use TCP instead of UDP

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Something basic:
              $ fierce --domain google.com --subdomains accounts admin ads

       Traverse IPs near discovered domains to search for contiguous blocks with the `--traverse` flag:
              $ fierce --domain facebook.com --subdomains admin --traverse 10

       Limit nearby IP traversal to certain domains with the `--search` flag:
              $ fierce --domain facebook.com --subdomains admin --search fb.com fb.net

       Attempt an `HTTP` connection on domains discovered with the `--connect` flag:
              $ fierce --domain stackoverflow.com --subdomains mail --connect

       Exchange speed for breadth with the `--wide` flag, which looks for nearby  domains  on  all  IPs  of  the
       [/24](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing#IPv4_CIDR_blocks)   of   a  discovered
       domain:
              $ fierce --domain facebook.com --wide

       Zone  transfers  are  rare  these  days,   but   they   give   us   the   keys   to   the   DNS   castle.
       [zonetransfer.me](https://digi.ninja/projects/zonetransferme.php)  is  a  very useful service for testing
       for and learning about zone transfers:
              $ fierce --domain zonetransfer.me

       To save the results to a file for later use we can simply redirect output:
              $ fierce --domain zonetransfer.me &gt; output.txt

       Internal networks will often have large blocks of contiguous IP space assigned.  We  can  scan  those  as
       well:
              $ fierce --dns-servers 10.0.0.1 --range 10.0.0.0/24

                                                                                                       <u><a href="../man1/FIERCE.1.html">FIERCE</a></u>(1)
