</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       lame - create mp3 audio files

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       lame [options] &lt;infile&gt; &lt;outfile&gt;

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       LAME  is  a  program  which  can  be used to create compressed audio files.  (Lame ain't an MP3 encoder).
       These audio files can be played back by popular MP3 players such as mpg123  or  madplay.   To  read  from
       stdin, use "-" for &lt;infile&gt;.  To write to stdout, use "-" for &lt;outfile&gt;.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Input options:

       <b>-r</b>     Assume  the input file is raw pcm.  Sampling rate and mono/stereo/jstereo must be specified on the
              command line.  For each stereo sample, LAME expects the input data  to  be  ordered  left  channel
              first,  then right channel. By default, LAME expects them to be signed integers with a bitwidth of
              16 and stored in little-endian.  Without <b>-r,</b> LAME will perform several <u>fseek()'s</u> on the input file
              looking for WAV and AIFF headers.
              Might not be available on your release.

       <b>-x</b>     Swap bytes in the input file (or output file when using <b>--decode).</b>
              For sorting out little endian/big endian type problems.  If your encodings sounds like static, try
              this first.
              Without using <b>-x,</b> LAME will treat input file as native endian.

       <b>-s</b> <u>sfreq</u>
              <u>sfreq</u> = 8/11.025/12/16/22.05/24/32/44.1/48

              Required only for raw PCM input files.  Otherwise it will be determined from  the  header  of  the
              input file.

              LAME  will  automatically  resample  the  input  file  to  one of the supported MP3 samplerates if
              necessary.

       <b>--bitwidth</b> <u>n</u>
              Input bit width per sample.
              <u>n</u> = 8, 16, 24, 32 (default 16)

              Required only for raw PCM input files.  Otherwise it will be determined from  the  header  of  the
              input file.

       <b>--signed</b>
              Instructs  LAME that the samples from the input are signed (the default for 16, 24 and 32 bits raw
              pcm data).

              Required only for raw PCM input files.

       <b>--unsigned</b>
              Instructs LAME that the samples from the input are unsigned (the default for 8 bits raw pcm  data,
              where 0x80 is zero).

              Required only for raw PCM input files and only available at bitwidth 8.

       <b>--little-endian</b>
              Instructs LAME that the samples from the input are in little-endian form.

              Required only for raw PCM input files.

       <b>--big-endian</b>
              Instructs LAME that the samples from the input are in big-endian form.

              Required only for raw PCM input files.

       <b>--mp1input</b>
              Assume the input file is a MPEG Layer I (ie MP1) file.
              If  the  filename ends in ".mp1" LAME will assume it is a MPEG Layer I file.  For stdin or Layer I
              files which do not end in .mp1 you need to use this switch.

       <b>--mp2input</b>
              Assume the input file is a MPEG Layer II (ie MP2) file.
              If the filename ends in ".mp2" LAME will assume it is a MPEG Layer II file.  For stdin or Layer II
              files which do not end in .mp2 you need to use this switch.

       <b>--mp3input</b>
              Assume the input file is a MP3 file.
              Useful for downsampling from one mp3 to another.  As an example, it can be  useful  for  streaming
              through an IceCast server.
              If the filename ends in ".mp3" LAME will assume it is an MP3.  For stdin or MP3 files which do not
              end in .mp3 you need to use this switch.

       <b>--nogap</b> <u>file1</u> <u>file2</u> <u>...</u>
              gapless encoding for a set of contiguous files

       <b>--nogapout</b> <u>dir</u>
              output dir for gapless encoding (must precede --nogap)

       <b>--out-dir</b> <u>dir</u>
              If no explicit output file is specified, a file will be written at given path.  Ignored when using
              piped/streamed input

       Operational options:

       <b>-m</b> <u>mode</u>
              <u>mode</u> = s, j, f, d, m, l, r

              Joint-stereo is the default mode for stereo files.

              <b>(s)imple</b> <b>stereo</b> <b>(Forced</b> <b>LR)</b>
              In  this mode, the encoder makes no use of potentially existing correlations between the two input
              channels.  It can, however, negotiate the bit demand between both channel, i.e. give  one  channel
              more bits if the other contains silence or needs less bits because of a lower complexity.

              <b>(j)oint</b> <b>stereo</b>
              In  this  mode,  the  encoder  can  use  (on a frame by frame basis) either L/R stereo or mid/side
              stereo.  In mid/side stereo, the mid (L+R) and side (L-R) channels are encoded, and more bits  are
              allocated  to the mid channel than the side channel.  When there isn't too much stereo separation,
              this effectively increases the bandwidth, so having higher quality with the same amount of bits.

              Using mid/side stereo inappropriately can result  in  audible  compression  artifacts.   Too  much
              switching  between mid/side and regular stereo can also sound bad.  To determine when to switch to
              mid/side stereo, LAME uses a much more sophisticated algorithm than the one described in  the  ISO
              documentation.

              <b>(f)orced</b> <b>MS</b> <b>stereo</b>
              Forces  all frames to be encoded with mid/side stereo. It should be used only if you are sure that
              every frame of the input file has very little stereo separation.

              <b>(d)ual</b> <b>channel</b>
              In this mode, the 2 channels will be  totally  independently  encoded.   Each  channel  will  have
              exactly  half of the bitrate.  This mode is designed for applications like dual languages encoding
              (for example: English in one channel and French in the  other).   Using  this  encoding  mode  for
              regular stereo files will result in a lower quality encoding.

              <b>(m)ono</b>
              The  input will be encoded as a mono signal.  If it was a stereo signal, it will be downsampled to
              mono.  The downmix is calculated as the sum of the left and right channel,  attenuated  by  6  dB.
              Also note that, if using a stereo RAW PCM stream, you need to use the -a parameter.

              <b>(l)eft</b> <b>channel</b> <b>only</b>
              The  input  will be encoded as a mono signal.  If it was a stereo signal, the left channel will be
              encoded only.

              <b>(r)ight</b> <b>channel</b> <b>only</b>
              The input will be encoded as a mono signal.  If it was a stereo signal, the right channel will  be
              encoded only.

       <b>-a</b>     Mix the stereo input file to mono and encode as mono.
              The downmix is calculated as the sum of the left and right channel, attenuated by 6 dB.

              This  option is only needed in the case of raw PCM stereo input (because LAME cannot determine the
              number of channels in the input file).  To encode a stereo RAW PCM input file as mono, use <b>lame</b> <b>-a</b>
              <b>-m</b> <b>m</b>

              For WAV and AIFF input files, using <b>-m</b> <b>m</b> will always produce a mono .mp3 file from both  mono  and
              stereo input.

       <b>--freeformat</b>
              Produces a free format bitstream.  With this option, you can use <b>-b</b> with any bitrate higher than 8
              kbps.

              However, even if an mp3 decoder is required to support free bitrates at least up to 320 kbps, many
              players are unable to deal with it.

              Tests have shown that the following decoders support free format:
              <b>in_mpg123</b> up to 560 kbps
              <b>l3dec</b> up to 310 kbps
              <b>LAME</b> up to 640 kbps
              <b>MAD</b> up to 640 kbps

       <b>--decode</b>
              Uses LAME for decoding to a wav file.  The input file can be any input type supported by encoding,
              including layer II files.  LAME uses a fork of mpglib known as HIP for decoding.

              If <b>-t</b> is used (disable wav header), LAME will output raw pcm in native endian format.  You can use
              <b>-x</b> to swap bytes order.

              This option is not usable if the MP3 decoder was <b>explicitly</b> disabled in the build of LAME.

       <b>-t</b>     Disable writing of the INFO Tag on encoding.
              This  tag is embedded in frame 0 of the MP3 file.  It includes some information about the encoding
              options of the file, and in VBR it lets VBR aware players correctly seek and compute playing times
              of VBR files.

              When <b>--decode</b> is specified (decode to WAV), this flag will disable writing of the WAV header.  The
              output will be raw pcm, native endian format.  Use <b>-x</b> to swap bytes.

       <b>--comp</b> <u>arg</u>
              Instead of choosing bitrate, using this option, user can choose compression ratio to achieve.

       <b>--scale</b> <u>n</u>
       <b>--scale-l</b> <u>n</u>
       <b>--scale-r</b> <u>n</u>
              Scales input (every channel, only left channel or only right channel) by <u>n.</u>  This just  multiplies
              the PCM data (after it has been converted to floating point) by <u>n.</u>

              <u>n</u> &gt; 1: increase volume
              <u>n</u> = 1: no effect
              <u>n</u> &lt; 1: reduce volume

              Use  with  care,  since  most MP3 decoders will truncate data which decodes to values greater than
              32768.

       <b>--replaygain-fast</b>
              Compute ReplayGain fast but slightly inaccurately.

              This computes "Radio" ReplayGain on the input  data  stream  after  user‐specified  volume‐scaling
              and/or resampling.

              The  ReplayGain  analysis  does <u>not</u> affect the content of a compressed data stream itself, it is a
              value stored in the header of a sound file.  Information on the  purpose  of  ReplayGain  and  the
              algorithms used is available from <b><a href="http://www.replaygain.org/">http://www.replaygain.org/</a>.</b>

              Only  the "RadioGain" Replaygain value is computed, it is stored in the LAME tag.  The analysis is
              performed with the reference volume equal to 89dB.  Note: the reference volume  has  been  changed
              from 83dB on transition from version 3.95 to 3.95.1.

              This switch is enabled by default.

              See also: <b>--replaygain-accurate,</b> <b>--noreplaygain</b>

       <b>--replaygain-accurate</b>
              Compute ReplayGain more accurately and find the peak sample.

              This  computes "Radio" ReplayGain on the decoded data stream, finds the peak sample by decoding on
              the fly the encoded data stream and stores it in the file.

              The ReplayGain analysis does <u>not</u> affect the content of a compressed data stream itself,  it  is  a
              value  stored  in  the  header  of a sound file.  Information on the purpose of ReplayGain and the
              algorithms used is available from <b><a href="http://www.replaygain.org/">http://www.replaygain.org/</a>.</b>

              By default, LAME performs ReplayGain analysis on the input data (after the  user‐specified  volume
              scaling).   This behavior might give slightly inaccurate results because the data on the output of
              a  lossy  compression/decompression  sequence  differs  from  the  initial   input   data.    When
              <b>--replaygain-accurate</b>  is  specified  the  mp3  stream gets decoded on the fly and the analysis is
              performed on the decoded data stream.  Although theoretically  this  method  gives  more  accurate
              results, it has several disadvantages:

               *   tests have shown that the difference between the ReplayGain values computed on the input data
                   and  decoded  data  is usually not greater than 0.5dB, although the minimum volume difference
                   the human ear can perceive is about 1.0dB

               *   decoding on the fly significantly slows down the encoding process

              The apparent advantage is that:

               *   with <b>--replaygain-accurate</b> the real peak sample is determined and stored in  the  file.   The
                   knowledge of the peak sample can be useful to decoders (players) to prevent a negative effect
                   called 'clipping' that introduces distortion into the sound.

              Only  the "RadioGain" ReplayGain value is computed, it is stored in the LAME tag.  The analysis is
              performed with the reference volume equal to 89dB.  Note: the reference volume  has  been  changed
              from 83dB on transition from version 3.95 to 3.95.1.

              This option is not usable if the MP3 decoder was <b>explicitly</b> disabled in the build of LAME.  (Note:
              if  LAME  is  compiled without the MP3 decoder, ReplayGain analysis is performed on the input data
              after user-specified volume scaling).

              See also: <b>--replaygain-fast,</b> <b>--noreplaygain</b> <b>--clipdetect</b>

       <b>--noreplaygain</b>
              Disable ReplayGain analysis.

              By default ReplayGain analysis is enabled. This switch disables it.

              See also: <b>--replaygain-fast,</b> <b>--replaygain-accurate</b>

       <b>--clipdetect</b>
              Clipping detection.

              Enable <b>--replaygain-accurate</b> and print a message whether clipping occurs and how  far  in  dB  the
              waveform is from full scale.

              This option is not usable if the MP3 decoder was <b>explicitly</b> disabled in the build of LAME.

              See also: <b>--replaygain-accurate</b>

       <b>--preset</b>  <b>type</b> <b>|</b> <b>[cbr]</b> <b>kbps</b>

       <b>--noasm</b>  <b>type</b>
              Disable  specific  assembly  optimizations ( <b>mmx</b> / <b>3dnow</b> / <b>sse</b> ).  Quality will not increase, only
              speed will be reduced.  If you have problems running Lame on a Cyrix/Via processor, disabling  mmx
              optimizations might solve your problem.

       Noise shaping &amp; psycho acoustic algorithms:

       <b>-q</b> <u>qual</u>
              0 &lt;= <u>qual</u> &lt;= 9

              Bitrate is of course the main influence on quality.   The  higher  the  bitrate,  the  higher  the
              quality.   But  for  a  given  bitrate,  we  have  a  choice  of  algorithms to determine the best
              scalefactors and Huffman encoding (noise shaping).

              For CBR and ABR, the following table applies:

              <b>-q</b> <b>0:</b>
              Use the best algorithms (Best Huffman coding search, full outer loop, and the highest precision of
              several parameters).

              <b>-q</b> <b>1</b> <b>to</b> <b>q</b> <b>4:</b>
              Similar to -q 0 without the full outer loop and decreasing precision  of  parameters  the  further
              from q0. -q 3 is the default.

              <b>-q</b> <b>5</b> <b>and</b> <b>-q</b> <b>6:</b>
              Same as -q 7, but enables noise shaping and increases subblock gain

              <b>-q</b> <b>7</b> <b>to</b> <b>-q</b> <b>9:</b>
              Same  as -f. Very fast, OK quality. Psychoacoustics are used for pre-echo and mid/side stereo, but
              no noise-shaping is done.

              For the default VBR mode since LAME 3.98, the following table applies :

              <b>-q</b> <b>0</b> <b>to</b> <b>-q</b> <b>4:</b>
              include all features of the other modes and additionally use the best search when applying Huffman
              coding.

              <b>-q</b> <b>5</b> <b>and</b> <b>-q</b> <b>6:</b>
              include all features of -q7, calculate and consider actual quantisation  noise,  and  additionally
              enable subblock gain.

              <b>-q</b> <b>7</b> <b>to</b> <b>-q</b> <b>9</b>
              This  level  uses  a  psymodel but does not calculate quantisation noise when encoding: it takes a
              quick guess.

       <b>-f</b>     Alias of <b>-q</b> <b>7</b>

       CBR (constant bitrate, the default) options:

       <b>-b</b> <u>n</u>   For MPEG-1 (sampling frequencies of 32, 44.1 and 48 kHz)
              <u>n</u> = 32, 40, 48, 56, 64, 80, 96, 112, 128, 160, 192, 224, 256, 320

              For MPEG-2 (sampling frequencies of 16, 22.05 and 24 kHz)
              <u>n</u> = 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56, 64, 80, 96, 112, 128, 144, 160

              For MPEG-2.5 (sampling frequencies of 8, 11.025 and 12 kHz)
              <u>n</u> = 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56, 64

              Default is 128 for MPEG1 and 64 for MPEG2 and 32 for MPEG2.5
               (64, 32 and 16 respectively in case of mono).

       <b>--cbr</b>  enforce use of constant bitrate. Used to disable VBR or ABR encoding even if  their  settings  are
              enabled.

       ABR (average bitrate) options:

       <b>--abr</b> <u>n</u>
              Turns  on encoding with a targeted average bitrate of n kbits, allowing to use frames of different
              sizes.  The allowed range of <u>n</u> is 8 - 310, you can use any integer value within that range.

              It can be combined with the <b>-b</b> and <b>-B</b> switches like: <b>lame</b> <b>--abr</b> <u>123</u> <b>-b</b> <u>64</u> <b>-B</b> <u>192</u> <u>a.wav</u> <u>a.mp3</u> which
              would limit the allowed frame sizes between 64 and 192 kbits.

              The use of <b>-B</b> is NOT RECOMMENDED.  A 128 kbps CBR bitstream, because of  the  bit  reservoir,  can
              actually  have  frames  which use as many bits as a 320 kbps frame.  VBR modes minimize the use of
              the bit reservoir, and thus need to allow 320 kbps frames to  get  the  same  flexibility  as  CBR
              streams.

       VBR (variable bitrate) options:

       <b>-v</b>     use variable bitrate <b>(--vbr-new)</b>

       <b>--vbr-old</b>
              Invokes the oldest, most tested VBR algorithm.  It produces very good quality files, though is not
              very fast.  This has, up through v3.89, been considered the "workhorse" VBR algorithm.

       <b>--vbr-new</b>
              Invokes the newest VBR algorithm.  During the development of version 3.90, considerable tuning was
              done on this algorithm, and it is now considered to be on par with the original <b>--vbr-old.</b>  It has
              the  added  advantage  of  being very fast (over twice as fast as <b>--vbr-old</b> ). This is the default
              since 3.98.

       <b>-V</b> <u>n</u>   0 &lt;= <u>n</u> &lt;= 9.999
              Enable VBR (Variable BitRate) and specifies the value of VBR quality (default = 4). Decimal values
              can be specified, like 4.51.
              0 = highest quality.

       ABR and VBR options:

       <b>-b</b> <u>bitrate</u>
              For MPEG-1 (sampling frequencies of 32, 44.1 and 48 kHz)
              <u>n</u> = 32, 40, 48, 56, 64, 80, 96, 112, 128, 160, 192, 224, 256, 320

              For MPEG-2 (sampling frequencies of 16, 22.05 and 24 kHz)
              <u>n</u> = 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56, 64, 80, 96, 112, 128, 144, 160

              For MPEG-2.5 (sampling frequencies of 8, 11.025 and 12 kHz)
              <u>n</u> = 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56, 64

              Specifies the minimum bitrate to be used.  However, in order to avoid wasted space,  the  smallest
              frame size available will be used during silences.

       <b>-B</b> <u>bitrate</u>
              For MPEG-1 (sampling frequencies of 32, 44.1 and 48 kHz)
              <u>n</u> = 32, 40, 48, 56, 64, 80, 96, 112, 128, 160, 192, 224, 256, 320

              For MPEG-2 (sampling frequencies of 16, 22.05 and 24 kHz)
              <u>n</u> = 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56, 64, 80, 96, 112, 128, 144, 160

              For MPEG-2.5 (sampling frequencies of 8, 11.025 and 12 kHz)
              <u>n</u> = 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56, 64

              Specifies the maximum allowed bitrate.

              Note:  If  you own an mp3 hardware player build upon a MAS 3503 chip, you must set maximum bitrate
              to no more than 224 kpbs.

       <b>-F</b>     Strictly enforce the <b>-b</b> option.
              This is mainly for use with hardware players that do not support low bitrate mp3.

              Without this option, the minimum bitrate will be ignored for passages of analog silence, i.e. when
              the music level is below the absolute threshold of human hearing (ATH).

       Experimental options:

       <b>-X</b> <u>n</u>   0 &lt;= <u>n</u> &lt;= 7

              When LAME searches for a "good" quantization, it has to compare the actual one with the  best  one
              found  so  far.   The  comparison says which one is better, the best so far or the actual.  The <b>-X</b>
              parameter selects between different approaches to make this decision, <b>-X0</b> being the default mode:

              <b>-X0</b>
              The criteria are (in order of importance):
              * less distorted scalefactor bands
              * the sum of noise over the thresholds is lower
              * the total noise is lower

              <b>-X1</b>
              The actual is better if the maximum noise over all scalefactor bands is less than the best so far.

              <b>-X2</b>
              The actual is better if the total sum of noise is lower than the best so far.

              <b>-X3</b>
              The actual is better if the total sum of noise is lower than the best so far and the maximum noise
              over all scalefactor bands is less than the best so far plus 2dB.

              <b>-X4</b>
              Not yet documented.

              <b>-X5</b>
              The criteria are (in order of importance):
              * the sum of noise over the thresholds is lower
              * the total sum of noise is lower

              <b>-X6</b>
              The criteria are (in order of importance):
              * the sum of noise over the thresholds is lower
              * the maximum noise over all scalefactor bands is lower
              * the total sum of noise is lower

              <b>-X7</b>
              The criteria are:
              * less distorted scalefactor bands
              or
              * the sum of noise over the thresholds is lower

       <b>-Y</b>     lets LAME ignore noise in sfb21, like in CBR

       MP3 header/stream options:

       <b>-e</b> <u>emp</u> <u>emp</u> = n, 5, c

              n = (none, default)
              5 = 0/15 microseconds
              c = citt j.17

              All this does is set a flag in the bitstream.  If you have a PCM input file where one of the above
              types of (obsolete) emphasis has been applied, you can set  this  flag  in  LAME.   Then  the  mp3
              decoder should de-emphasize the output during playback, although most decoders ignore this flag.

              A better solution would be to apply the de-emphasis with a standalone utility before encoding, and
              then encode without <b>-e.</b>

       <b>-c</b>     Mark the encoded file as being copyrighted.

       <b>-o</b>     Mark the encoded file as being a copy.

       <b>-p</b>     Turn on CRC error protection.
              It  will  add  a cyclic redundancy check (CRC) code in each frame, allowing to detect transmission
              errors that could occur on the MP3 stream.  However,  it  takes  16  bits  per  frame  that  would
              otherwise be used for encoding, and then will slightly reduce the sound quality.

       <b>--nores</b>
              Disable  the  bit  reservoir.  Each frame will then become independent from previous ones, but the
              quality will be lower.

       <b>--strictly-enforce-ISO</b>
              With this option, LAME will enforce the 7680 bit limitation on total frame size.
              This results in  many  wasted  bits  for  high  bitrate  encodings  but  will  ensure  strict  ISO
              compatibility.  This compatibility might be important for hardware players.

       Filter options:

       <b>--lowpass</b> <u>freq</u>
              Set a lowpass filtering frequency in kHz.  Frequencies above the specified one will be cutoff.

       <b>--lowpass-width</b> <u>freq</u>
              Set the width of the lowpass filter.  The default value is 15% of the lowpass frequency.

       <b>--highpass</b> <u>freq</u>
              Set an highpass filtering frequency in kHz.  Frequencies below the specified one will be cutoff.

       <b>--highpass-width</b> <u>freq</u>
              Set the width of the highpass filter in kHz.  The default value is 15% of the highpass frequency.

       <b>--resample</b> <u>sfreq</u>
              <u>sfreq</u> = 8, 11.025, 12, 16, 22.05, 24, 32, 44.1, 48
              Select output sampling frequency (only supported for encoding).
              If not specified, LAME will automatically resample the input when using high compression ratios.

       ID3 tag options:

       <b>--tt</b> <u>title</u>
              audio/song title (max 30 chars for version 1 tag)

       <b>--ta</b> <u>artist</u>

              (track and total each 1 to 255. Providing just the track number  creates  v1.1  tag,  providing  a
              total forces v2.0).

              "TXXX=description=content"

       <b>--add-id3v2</b>
              force addition of version 2 tag

              pad version 1 tag with spaces instead of nulls

       <b>--pad-id3v2</b>
              same as --pad-id3v2-size 128

       <b>--pad-id3v2-size</b> <b>num</b>
              adds version 2 tag, pad with extra "num" bytes

       <b>--genre-list</b>
              print alphabetically sorted ID3 genre list and exit

       <b>--ignore-tag-errors</b>
              ignore errors in values passed for tags, use defaults in case an error occurs

       Analysis options:

       <b>-g</b>     run graphical analysis on &lt;infile&gt;.  &lt;infile&gt; can also be a .mp3 file.  (This feature is a compile
              time option.  Your binary may for speed reasons be compiled without this.)

</pre><h4><b>ID3</b> <b>TAGS</b></h4><pre>
       LAME is able to embed ID3 v1, v1.1 or v2 tags inside the encoded MP3 file.  This allows one to have  some
       useful  information  about  the music track included inside the file.  Those data can be read by most MP3
       players.

       Lame will smartly choose which tags to use.  It will add ID3 v2 tags only if the input comments won't fit
       in v1 or v1.1 tags, i.e. if they are more than 30 characters.  In this case, both v1 and v2 tags will  be
       added, to ensure reading of tags by MP3 players which are unable to read ID3 v2 tags.

</pre><h4><b>ENCODING</b> <b>MODES</b></h4><pre>
       LAME  is  able  to  encode  your music using one of its 3 encoding modes: constant bitrate (CBR), average
       bitrate (ABR) and variable bitrate (VBR).

       <b>Constant</b> <b>Bitrate</b> <b>(CBR)</b>
              This is the default encoding mode, and also the most basic.  In this mode, the bitrate will be the
              same for the whole file.  It means that each part of your mp3 file will be using the  same  number
              of bits.  The musical passage being a difficult one to encode or an easy one, the encoder will use
              the  same  bitrate,  so  the  quality  of  your mp3 is variable.  Complex parts will be of a lower
              quality than the easiest ones.  The main advantage is that the final files size won't  change  and
              can be accurately predicted.

       <b>Average</b> <b>Bitrate</b> <b>(ABR)</b>
              In  this mode, you choose the encoder will maintain an average bitrate while using higher bitrates
              for the parts of your music that need more bits.  The result will be of higher  quality  than  CBR
              encoding  but  the  average  file size will remain predictable, so this mode is highly recommended
              over CBR.  This encoding mode is similar to what is referred as vbr in  AAC  or  Liquid  Audio  (2
              other compression technologies).

       <b>Variable</b> <b>bitrate</b> <b>(VBR)</b>
              In this mode, you choose the desired quality on a scale from 9 (lowest quality/biggest distortion)
              to 0 (highest quality/lowest distortion).  Then encoder tries to maintain the given quality in the
              whole  file by choosing the optimal number of bits to spend for each part of your music.  The main
              advantage is that you are able to specify the quality level  that  you  want  to  reach,  but  the
              inconvenient is that the final file size is totally unpredictable.

</pre><h4><b>PRESETS</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>--preset</b> switches are aliases over LAME settings.

       To activate these presets:

       For VBR modes (generally highest quality):

       <b>--preset</b> <b>medium</b>
              This preset should provide near transparency to most people on most music.

       <b>--preset</b> <b>standard</b>
              This preset should generally be transparent to most people on most music and is already quite high
              in quality.

       <b>--preset</b> <b>extreme</b>
              If  you  have  extremely  good  hearing  and similar equipment, this preset will generally provide
              slightly higher quality than the <b>standard</b> mode.

       For CBR 320kbps (highest quality possible from the <b>--preset</b> switches):

       <b>--preset</b> <b>insane</b>
              This preset will usually be overkill for most people and most situations, but if you must have the
              absolute highest quality with no regard to filesize, this is the way to go.

       For ABR modes (high quality per given bitrate but not as high as VBR):

       <b>--preset</b>  <b>kbps</b>
              Using this preset will usually give you good quality at a specified  bitrate.   Depending  on  the
              bitrate  entered,  this  preset will determine the optimal settings for that particular situation.
              While this approach works, it is not nearly as flexible as VBR, and usually will  not  attain  the
              same level of quality as VBR at higher bitrates.

       <b>cbr</b>    If  you  use  the  ABR mode (read above) with a significant bitrate such as 80, 96, 112, 128, 160,
              192, 224, 256, 320, you can use the <b>--preset</b> <b>cbr</b>  <b>kbps</b> option to force CBR mode  encoding  instead
              of  the  standard  ABR  mode.  ABR does provide higher quality but CBR may be useful in situations
              such as when streaming an MP3 over the Internet may be important.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Fixed bit rate jstereo 128kbs encoding:

              <b>lame</b> <b>-b</b> <u>128</u> <u>sample.wav</u> <u>sample.mp3</u>

       Fixed bit rate jstereo 128 kbps encoding, highest quality:

              <b>lame</b> <b>-q</b> <b>0</b> <b>-b</b> <u>128</u> <u>sample.wav</u> <u>sample.mp3</u>

       To disable joint stereo encoding (slightly faster, but less quality at bitrates &lt;= 128 kbps):

              <b>lame</b> <b>-m</b> <u>s</u> <u>sample.wav</u> <u>sample.mp3</u>

       Variable bitrate (use -V n to adjust quality/filesize):

              <b>lame</b> <b>-V</b> <u>2</u> <u>sample.wav</u> <u>sample.mp3</u>

       Streaming mono 22.05 kHz raw pcm, 24 kbps output:

              <b>cat</b> <u>inputfile</u> <b>|</b> <b>lame</b> <b>-r</b> <b>-m</b> <u>m</u> <b>-b</b> <u>24</u> <b>-s</b> <u>22.05</u> <u>-</u> <u>-</u> <b>&gt;</b> <u>output</u>

       Streaming mono 44.1 kHz raw pcm, with downsampling to 22.05 kHz:
