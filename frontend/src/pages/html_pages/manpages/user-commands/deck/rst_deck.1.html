       rst_deck - Convert simulation deck to a deck ready for restart

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>rst_deck</b> [<u>OPTIONS</u>] <u>ECL_DECK_FILENAME</u> <u>RESTART_SOURCE</u> [<u>BASENAME_RESTART_DECK</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  rst_deck  program  will load a simulation deck and parameters for a restart and reformat the deck to
       become a restart deck. Before the updated deck is  output  the  program  will  update  the  SOLUTION  and
       SCHEDULE  sections.  All  keywords from the SOLUTION section will be cleared <a href="../man1/out.1.html">out</a>(1) and a RESTART keyword
       will be inserted. In the SCHEDULE section the program can either remove all keywords up until the restart
       date, or alternatively insert SKIPREST immediately following the SCHEDULE keyword.

       When creating the updated restart deck the program can either  link  to  unmodified  include  files  with
       INCLUDE  statements,  create a copy of deck structure in an alternative location or create one large file
       with all keywords in the same file. Apart from the alterations to support restart the output deck will be
       equivalent to the input deck, but formatting is not retained and comments have been stripped away.

       Arguments:

       1. The data file we are starting with.

       2. The restart source; this can either be a basename with an optional path

              prefix and a :N to restart from step N; alternatively you can point to an existing  restart  file.
              If you point to an existing restart file the input will be validated in several ways:

              a) Unified/multiple files will be checked against the UNIFIN setting of

              the deck.

              b) Formatted/unformatted will be checked against the FMTIn setting of the

              deck.

              c) If a single file like <u>/path/to/case/HISTORY.X0067</u> is given as argument the

              :N notation to denote report step should not be used.

              If  the  restart  argument  is  given  as  the path to an existing file the content of the RESTART
              keyword will be updated to contain the correct path from the location of the restart deck  to  the
              location of the restart file. This path awareness will be fooled if the restart deck is redirected
              from stdout to a path different from cwd. If the restart argument is given as an absolute filename
              the  RESTART  keyword  will  have an absolute path, if the restart argument is a relative path the
              RESTART keyword will get a relative path - although an absolute path will be used if  the  restart
              file  and  the  output deck have different roots. If the restart argument is given as a string not
              pointing to an existing file it will be inserted verbatim in the restart deck.

              A restart step value of 0 is interpreted as a dry run - a deck which  has  not  been  set  up  for
              restart will be written out.

       3. Basename of the restart deck we create, can optionally contain a path prefix;

              the  path  will  be  created if it does not already exist. This argument is optional, if it is not
              provided the program will dump a restart deck  on  stdout.  If  the  argument  corresponds  to  an
              existing directory the restart case will get the same name as the base case.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-s</b>: Manipulate the SCHEDULE section by inserting a SKIPREST keyword immediately

              following the SCHEDULE keyword. If the <b>-s</b> option is not used the SCHEDULE section will be modified
              by removing all keywords until we reach the restart date.

       <b>-m</b>: [share|inline|copy] The restart deck can reuse the unmodified include files

              from  the  base case, this is mode 'share' and is the default. With mode 'inline' the restart deck
              will be one long file and with mode 'copy' the file structure of the base case will  be  retained.
              The default if no <b>-m</b> option is given is the 'share' mode.

              In  the  case  of 'share' and 'copy' the correct path to include files will be negotiated based on
              the path given to the output case in the third argument.  If the restart deck is passed to  stdout
              the include files will be resolved based on output in cwd.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLE</b></h4><pre>
              rst_deck <u>/path/to/history/HISTORY.DATA</u> rst/HISTORY:30 <u>/path/to/rst/RESTART</u> <b>-s</b>

       1: The program has a compiled list of keywords which will be retained in the

              SOLUTION section. The current value of that list is: RPTRST
