       wmlv - Very simple text-based WML deck viewer

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This  is  a  very  simple text-based WML deck viewer. It doesn't have any concept of WMLscript, definable
       widgets, images or tables. It just runs through the source putting it out as it thinks is best.

       Use it as "wmlv file.wml [card]" where [card] is an optional card to show from the deck (default  is  the
       first encountered).

       The  end result should see the output from wmld being passed to here, thereby creating a viewer which can
       handle bytecode too.

       An X version of this is being planned which should be able to handle the definable  widgets,  images  and
       tables. WMLscript is still beyond me at the minute.

       Usage: ./wmlv file.wml [card ID]
