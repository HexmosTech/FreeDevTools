</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       ar86 - Create, modify, and extract from archive file

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ar86</b> <u>operation</u> <b>archive</b> [<u>file...</u>]

       <b>ar86</b> <u>positional-op</u> <b>member</b> <b>archive</b> [<u>file</u>...]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>ar86</b>  program  is  used  to  create,  examine  and  modify  archive files produced by the Dev86/ELKS
       toolchain.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>ar86</b> command requires that the operation to be performed on the archive be  specified  as  the  first
       option.  If  the operation is positional then the next option is the archive member marking the position.
       This is followed by the archive file name and any list of file names.

   <b>Operations</b>
       One of the following operations can be specified

       <b>d</b>      <u>delete</u> the listed files from the archive.

       <b>m</b>      <u>move</u> the named files. By default files are moved to the end of the  archive  unless  a  positional
              modifier is present.

       <b>p</b>      <u>print</u>  the  contents  of  archive  members  to standard out. If a file list is included only those
              members are printed. If the <b>v</b> modifier is present each file's contents are preceded by a new line,
              a line with the string <b>member</b>, a space character, the member name, and two following newlines.

       <b>q</b>      <u>quickly</u> add the files to the end of the archive without checking to see if they already  exist  in
              the  archive.  This operation will ignore any positional modifiers. Creates the archive file if it
              does not exist.

       <b>r</b>      <u>replace</u> archive members with the files listed. If the file name is not present in the  archive  it
              is  added to the end of the archive (or to any explicitly specified position). Creates the archive
              file if it does not exist.

       <b>t</b>      <u>table</u>; list the file names of archive members. If a file list is present only those files that are
              present in the archive are listed.  The <b>v</b> modifier prints member attributes.

       <b>x</b>      <u>extract</u> the named files from the archive into the current directory. If no files are specified all
              the archive members will be extracted.

   <b>Modifiers</b>
       The following modifiers may be used with the operations

       <b>o</b>      <u>original</u> time stamps from the archive are preserved for extracted files when possible.

       <b>s</b>      <u>symbol</u> update; this option may be used by itself to force  an  update  to  the  symbol  definition
              section of the archive (the <b>__.SYMDEF</b> member). If any files are specified they will be replaced as
              if the <b>r</b> operation had been specified. If no symbol definition section exists one is created. This
              option will also creates the archive file if it does not exist.

       <b>u</b>      <u>update</u>  files in the archive during a <b>r</b> (<u>replace</u>) operation. The files are added to the archive in
              exactly the same manner as <u>replace</u> except that an existing archive member will be retained (in its
              original position) if it has a modified more recently than the file being added.  Note  that  this
              modifier acts as if a <b>r</b> operation has been specified (even it has not), and will actually override
              any other previously specified operation.

       <b>v</b>      <u>verbose</u>; print additional diagnostic messages while processing the archive.

   <b>Positional</b> <b>Modifiers</b>
       The  following  modifiers  specify  where  in  the  archive  files are moved to or added. If any of these
       modifiers are specified then the second option to <b>ar86</b> must be the name of an archive member.

       <b>a</b>      <u>after</u>; files are placed after the specified archive member.

       <b>b</b>      <u>before</u>; files are placed before the specified archive member.

       <b>i</b>      same as <b>b</b>.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       To see the contents of an archive

              ar86 tv libfile.a

       To add some files to an archive

              ar86 r libfile.a file1.o file2.o

       to add some files after a member named mem.o and to update the symbol table

              ar86 rsa mem.o libfile.a file1.o file2.o

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       A <b>l</b> modifier will be accepted but ignored.

</pre><h4><b>RESTRICTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       This command is intended for use only with object files created using the Dev86/ELKS toolchain.
