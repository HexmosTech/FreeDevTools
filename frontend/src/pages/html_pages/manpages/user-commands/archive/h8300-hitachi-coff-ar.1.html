       ar - create, modify, and extract from archives

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       ar [<b>-X32_64</b>] [<b>-</b>]<u>p</u>[<u>mod</u> [<u>relpos</u>] [<u>count</u>]] <u>archive</u> [<u>member</u>...]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  GNU <b>ar</b> program creates, modifies, and extracts from archives.  An <u>archive</u> is a single file holding a
       collection of other files in a structure that makes it possible to retrieve the original individual files
       (called <u>members</u> of the archive).

       The original files' contents, mode (permissions), timestamp,  owner,  and  group  are  preserved  in  the
       archive, and can be restored on extraction.

       GNU  <b>ar</b>  can  maintain  archives  whose members have names of any length; however, depending on how <b>ar</b> is
       configured on your system, a limit on member-name length may be imposed for  compatibility  with  archive
       formats  maintained with other tools.  If it exists, the limit is often 15 characters (typical of formats
       related to a.out) or 16 characters (typical of formats related to coff).

       <b>ar</b> is considered a binary utility because archives of this sort are most often used as <u>libraries</u>  holding
       commonly needed subroutines.

       <b>ar</b>  creates an index to the symbols defined in relocatable object modules in the archive when you specify
       the modifier <b>s</b>.  Once created, this index is updated in the archive whenever <b>ar</b> makes  a  change  to  its
       contents  (save  for  the  <b>q</b>  update  operation).  An archive with such an index speeds up linking to the
       library, and allows routines in the library to call each other without regard to their placement  in  the
       archive.

       You  may  use <b>nm</b> <b>-s</b> or <b>nm</b> <b>--print-armap</b> to list this index table.  If an archive lacks the table, another
       form of <b>ar</b> called <b>ranlib</b> can be used to add just the table.

       GNU <b>ar</b> is designed to be compatible with two different facilities.  You can control  its  activity  using
       command-line  options,  like the different varieties of <b>ar</b> on Unix systems; or, if you specify the single
       command-line option <b>-M</b>, you can control it with a script  supplied  via  standard  input,  like  the  MRI
       ``librarian'' program.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       GNU  <b>ar</b>  allows  you  to  mix  the operation code <u>p</u> and modifier flags <u>mod</u> in any order, within the first
       command-line argument.

       If you wish, you may begin the first command-line argument with a dash.

       The <u>p</u> keyletter specifies what operation to execute; it may be any of the following, but you must specify
       only one of them:

       <b>d</b>   <u>Delete</u> modules from the archive.  Specify the names of  modules  to  be  deleted  as  <u>member</u>...;  the
           archive is untouched if you specify no files to delete.

           If you specify the <b>v</b> modifier, <b>ar</b> lists each module as it is deleted.

       <b>m</b>   Use this operation to <u>move</u> members in an archive.

           The  ordering  of  members  in  an archive can make a difference in how programs are linked using the
           library, if a symbol is defined in more than one member.

           If no modifiers are used with "m", any members you name in the <u>member</u> arguments are moved to the  <u>end</u>
           of the archive; you can use the <b>a</b>, <b>b</b>, or <b>i</b> modifiers to move them to a specified place instead.

       <b>p</b>   <u>Print</u>  the  specified  members  of  the  archive,  to the standard output file.  If the <b>v</b> modifier is
           specified, show the member name before copying its contents to standard output.

           If you specify no <u>member</u> arguments, all the files in the archive are printed.

       <b>q</b>   <u>Quick</u> <u>append</u>; Historically, add the files <u>member</u>... to the  end  of  <u>archive</u>,  without  checking  for
           replacement.

           The  modifiers  <b>a</b>, <b>b</b>, and <b>i</b> do <u>not</u> affect this operation; new members are always placed at the end of
           the archive.

           The modifier <b>v</b> makes <b>ar</b> list each file as it is appended.

           Since the point of this operation is speed, the archive's symbol table index is not updated, even  if
           it already existed; you can use <b>ar</b> <b>s</b> or <b>ranlib</b> explicitly to update the symbol table index.

           However, too many different systems assume quick append rebuilds the index, so GNU <b>ar</b> implements <b>q</b> as
           a synonym for <b>r</b>.

       <b>r</b>   Insert the files <u>member</u>... into <u>archive</u> (with <u>replacement</u>). This operation differs from <b>q</b> in that any
           previously existing members are deleted if their names match those being added.

           If  one  of  the  files  named  in <u>member</u>... does not exist, <b>ar</b> displays an error message, and leaves
           undisturbed any existing members of the archive matching that name.

           By default, new members are added at the end of the file; but you may use one of the modifiers <b>a</b>,  <b>b</b>,
           or <b>i</b> to request placement relative to some existing member.

           The  modifier  <b>v</b> used with this operation elicits a line of output for each file inserted, along with
           one of the letters <b>a</b> or <b>r</b> to indicate whether the file  was  appended  (no  old  member  deleted)  or
           replaced.

       <b>t</b>   Display  a  <u>table</u> listing the contents of <u>archive</u>, or those of the files listed in <u>member</u>... that are
           present in the archive.  Normally only the member name is shown; if you also want to  see  the  modes
           (permissions),  timestamp,  owner,  group,  and  size,  you can request that by also specifying the <b>v</b>
           modifier.

           If you do not specify a <u>member</u>, all files in the archive are listed.

           If there is more than one file with the same name (say, <b>fie</b>) in an archive (say <b>b.a</b>), <b>ar</b>  <b>t</b>  <b>b.a</b>  <b>fie</b>
           lists only the first instance; to see them all, you must ask for a complete listing---in our example,
           <b>ar</b> <b>t</b> <b>b.a</b>.

       <b>x</b>   <u>Extract</u>  members (named <u>member</u>) from the archive.  You can use the <b>v</b> modifier with this operation, to
           request that <b>ar</b> list each name as it extracts it.

           If you do not specify a <u>member</u>, all files in the archive are extracted.

       A number of modifiers (<u>mod</u>) may  immediately  follow  the  <u>p</u>  keyletter,  to  specify  variations  on  an
       operation's behavior:

       <b>a</b>   Add  new  files  <u>after</u>  an existing member of the archive.  If you use the modifier <b>a</b>, the name of an
           existing archive member must be present as the <u>relpos</u> argument, before the <u>archive</u> specification.

       <b>b</b>   Add new files <u>before</u> an existing member of the archive.  If you use the modifier <b>b</b>, the  name  of  an
           existing  archive  member  must  be present as the <u>relpos</u> argument, before the <u>archive</u> specification.
           (same as <b>i</b>).

       <b>c</b>   <u>Create</u> the archive.  The specified <u>archive</u> is always created if it did not exist, when you request an
           update.  But a warning is issued unless you specify in advance that you expect to create it, by using
           this modifier.

       <b>f</b>   Truncate names in the archive.  GNU <b>ar</b> will normally permit file names  of  any  length.   This  will
           cause  it to create archives which are not compatible with the native <b>ar</b> program on some systems.  If
           this is a concern, the <b>f</b> modifier may be used to  truncate  file  names  when  putting  them  in  the
           archive.

       <b>i</b>   Insert new files <u>before</u> an existing member of the archive.  If you use the modifier <b>i</b>, the name of an
           existing  archive  member  must  be present as the <u>relpos</u> argument, before the <u>archive</u> specification.
           (same as <b>b</b>).

       <b>l</b>   This modifier is accepted but not used.

       <b>N</b>   Uses the <u>count</u> parameter.  This is used if there are multiple entries in the archive  with  the  same
           name.  Extract or delete instance <u>count</u> of the given name from the archive.

       <b>o</b>   Preserve  the  <u>original</u>  dates of members when extracting them.  If you do not specify this modifier,
           files extracted from the archive are stamped with the time of extraction.

       <b>P</b>   Use the full path name when matching names in the archive.  GNU <b>ar</b> can not create an archive  with  a
           full  path name (such archives are not POSIX complaint), but other archive creators can.  This option
           will cause GNU <b>ar</b> to match file names using a complete  path  name,  which  can  be  convenient  when
           extracting a single file from an archive created by another tool.

       <b>s</b>   Write  an  object-file  index into the archive, or update an existing one, even if no other change is
           made to the archive.  You may use this modifier flag either with any operation, or alone.  Running <b>ar</b>
           <b>s</b> on an archive is equivalent to running <b>ranlib</b> on it.

       <b>S</b>   Do not generate an archive symbol table.  This can speed up  building  a  large  library  in  several
           steps.  The resulting archive can not be used with the linker.  In order to build a symbol table, you
           must omit the <b>S</b> modifier on the last execution of <b>ar</b>, or you must run <b>ranlib</b> on the archive.

       <b>u</b>   Normally,  <b>ar</b> <b>r</b>... inserts all files listed into the archive.  If you would like to insert <u>only</u> those
           of the files you list that are newer than existing members of the same names, use this modifier.  The
           <b>u</b> modifier is allowed only for the operation <b>r</b> (replace).  In particular, the combination <b>qu</b>  is  not
           allowed, since checking the timestamps would lose any speed advantage from the operation <b>q</b>.

       <b>v</b>   This  modifier  requests  the  <u>verbose</u>  version  of an operation.  Many operations display additional
           information, such as filenames processed, when the modifier <b>v</b> is appended.

       <b>V</b>   This modifier shows the version number of <b>ar</b>.

       <b>ar</b> ignores an initial option spelt <b>-X32_64</b>, for compatibility with AIX.  The behaviour produced  by  this
       option  is  the  default  for GNU <b>ar</b>.  <b>ar</b> does not support any of the other <b>-X</b> options; in particular, it
       does not support <b>-X32</b> which is the default for AIX <b>ar</b>.
