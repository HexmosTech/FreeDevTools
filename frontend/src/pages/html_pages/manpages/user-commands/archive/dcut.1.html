</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       dcut - Debian archive command file upload tool

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>dcut</b> [-h] [-d] [-c <u>FILE</u>] [-m <u>MAINTAINER</u>] [-k <u>KEYID</u>] [-O <u>FILENAME</u>] [-P] [-s] [-U <u>FILENAME</u>] [-i <u>FILENAME</u>]
       [-v] [<u>HOST</u>] SUBCOMMAND ...

       <b>dcut</b> [<u>OPTIONS</u>] [<u>HOST</u>] SUBCOMMAND [<u>SUB-COMMAND</u> <u>OPTIONS</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>dcut</b> can create and/or upload command files understood by the debian archive kit ("dak") software. It
       provides an extensible interface so that third party authors can easily integrate more sub-commands.
       Hence, your running instance of <b>dcut</b> may understand more commands than these documented here. Refer to
       the respective documentations for these commands.

       Similar to <b>dput</b>, a <u>HOST</u> can be specified as a target site for the command file. Likewise, the same
       default host selection criteria apply. It also parses the same configuration files described there.

       It should be noted that this does not support the same interface as the old dput binary. Please be sure
       to double-check scripts that depend on old-style dput’s interface.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-c,</b> <b>--config</b>=FILE
           Configuration file to parse.

       <b>-d,</b> <b>--debug</b>
           Enable debug messages. Repeat twice to increase the verbosity level.

       <b>-f,</b> <b>--force</b>
           Bypass all sanity checks and upload the commands file as is. Use with caution.

       <b>-m,</b> <b>--maintainer</b>=MAINTAINER
           Use <u>MAINTAINER</u> for the uploader field and GnuPG key selection. Provide it as a full identity, that is
           in "J Uploader &lt;<a href="mailto:yourid@example.com">yourid@example.com</a>&gt;" format. This has no effect when the <b>upload</b> command is used.

       <b>-k,</b> <b>--keyid</b>=KEYID
           Use <u>KEYID</u> as a key for signing. Default is to use DEBEMAIL and DEBFULLNAME, or whatever identity was
           provided with <b>--maintainer</b>. This has no effect when the <b>upload</b> command is used.

       <b>-O,</b> <b>--output</b>=FILENAME
           Write the resulting commands file to <u>FILENAME</u> instead of uploading it. This option should not be used
           with the <b>upload</b> command. The selected <u>FILENAME</u> won’t be overwritten if it exists already. This is
           very helpful for testing that things work correctly.

       <b>-P,</b> <b>--passive</b>
           Force FTP passive mode when uploading the package through FTP. This option is deprecated - use
           profiles instead.

       <b>-s,</b> <b>--simulate</b>
           Simulate the upload only. This runs all pre-upload checks, initializes the upload handler but does
           not actually store any file.

       <b>-i,</b> <b>--input</b>=FILENAME
           Ignored silently for compatibility with old-style dput command lines.

       <b>-v,</b> <b>--version</b>
           Print version information and exit

       <b>HOST</b>
           Target host to upload a package. It has the same behavior and semantics as <b><a href="../man1/dput.1.html">dput</a>(1)</b><u>s</u> <u>'HOST</u> argument.
           It also uses the same profiles from it.

</pre><h4><b>SUB-COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       Sub-commands are actually implementing commands understood by be archive software. They can take
       individual arguments which must appear after specifying the actual desired sub-command.

   <b>cancel</b>
       Cancel an upload entirely. The upload is referred to as a changes file name existing <b>remote</b> in the
       incoming or deferred queues.

       <b>OPTIONS</b>

           Takes one argument

           <b>-f</b>, <b>--file</b>=<u>FILENAME</u>
               The changes file name which refers to the upload to be cancelled.

   <b>migrate</b>
       Accept or reject an upload from a policy queue into the underlying suite. Underneath, this issues a
       <u>.dak-commands</u> file with command <u>process-upload</u>. The upload is selected via two arguments identifying the
       source package name and the source version.

       For migrating source package foobar in version 1.2.3-4+deb42u1, you might use:

           dcut security-master migrate foobar 1.2.3-4+deb42u1

       <b>OPTIONS</b>

           <b>--reject</b>
               Rather than accepting and thus migrating the upload, remove the associated packages from the
               policy queue without transferring them to the underlying suite.

   <b>rm</b>
       Remove a lost or wrongly uploaded file from the incoming directory. The argument is interpreted as a path
       fragment by the archive software. Therefore, to delete a filename from a deferred queue, refer to it by
       using the full path

       For example, to delete a broken upload in the DELAYED queue, use the command

           dcut rm -f DELAYED/X-day/foobar.deb

       Alternatively, the <u>--searchdirs</u> argument instructs the archive software to search for a file name in all
       directory. Hence, this command is equivalent to the command before:

           dcut rm --searchdirs -f foobar.deb

       <b>OPTIONS</b>

           Takes at least one argument

           <b>-f</b>, <b>--file</b>=<u>FILENAME</u>
               The file name to be removed. This argument can be repeated, and also knows about the shell
               wildcards *, ?, and []. However, please keep your local shell replacements in mind when supplying
               shell meta characters. You may need to escape them or provide them within quotes.

           <b>--searchdirs</b>
               Search in all directories for the given file. Only supported for files in the DELAYED queue.

   <b>dm</b>
       Manage Debian Maintainer (DM) upload permissions. Debian Developers can grant or revoke them package
       upload permissions using this command. Takes the Debian Maintainer and the action to perform as argument.

       Note, dcut will not perform any validation for conflicting arguments within <b>--allow</b> and <b>--deny</b> below.
       This handling is left to the archive software, which is currently processing <b>--allow</b> before <b>--deny</b> as an
       implementation detail.

       <b>OPTIONS</b>

           <b>--uid</b>
               Any searchable, unique identity to identify an existing Debian Maintainer. This can be a (full)
               name an e-mail address or a GnuPG fingerprint of any existing Debian Maintainer. Note, the
               identity provided must be known in the DM keyring installed on your local system. The keyring is
               used to validate the supplied argument and makes sure the identity hint supplied matches <b>exactly</b>
               one DM. If the user you want to change ACLs on is not known to the local DM keyring, you can
               provide the <b>full</b> GPG user ID as argument, and pass --force, to cause dcut to bypass any argument
               checking/translation. Please note, this will generate a commands file which will be uploaded
               literally as is. Use with caution.

           <b>--allow</b>=PACKAGE

           <b>--allow</b> PACKAGE LIST
               Source package(s) where permissions to upload should be granted. Give a space-separated list of
               packages to apply permissions to more than one package at once. If multiple <u>--allow</u> options are
               given, the last one takes precedence.

           <b>--deny</b>=PACKAGE

           <b>--deny</b> PACKAGE LIST
               Source package(s) where permissions to upload should be denied. Give a space-separated list of
               packages to apply permissions to more than one package at once. If multiple <u>--deny</u> options are
               given, the last one takes precedence.

   <b>reschedule</b>
       Reschedule an upload. This command can move a deferred upload to any other deferred queue.

       <b>OPTIONS</b>

           Takes two arguments

           <b>-f</b>, <b>--file</b>=<u>FILENAME</u>
               file name to be rescheduled

           <b>-d</b>, <b>--days</b>=<u>DAYS</u>
               Reschedule the upload to DAYS days. Takes a numeric argument from 0 to 15 corresponding to the
               respective delayed queues. Note, 0-day is not the same as uploading to incoming straight.

   <b>upload</b>
       This is a pseudo-command (that is, it is handled within dcut and not forwarded to the archive kit) which
       uploads a locally existing commands file as is.

       However, no checks are performed for this file. Use with caution.

       <b>OPTIONS</b>

           Takes one argument

           <b>-f</b>, <b>--file</b>=<u>FILENAME</u>
               A local file name which is uploaded as is to the archive software.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>0</b>
           Success

       <b>1</b>
           A runtime check returned an error

       <b>2</b>
           An internal error was detected, for example while loading configuration files

       <b>3</b>
           An upload error was detected, for example a permission or authentication problem while uploading
           files
