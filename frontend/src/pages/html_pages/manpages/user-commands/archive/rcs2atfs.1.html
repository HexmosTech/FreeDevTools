       rcs2atfs - convert RCS archives to AtFS format

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>rcs2atfs</b> [<b>-o</b> <u>outputfile</u>] [ <b>-q</b>] <u>archive</u> ...
       <b>rcs2atfs</b> [<b>-o</b> <u>outputfile</u>] [ <b>-q</b>] <b>-R</b> <u>directory</u> ...

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Rcs2atfs</b>  converts version histories from RCS archives to ShapeTools' AtFS format. It uses <u><a href="../man1/rlog.1.html">rlog</a></u>(1) to get
       information about an RCS archive and issues shell commands (usually through a pipe directly  to  <a href="file:/bin/sh">/bin/sh</a>)
       to check out the RCS revisions and check the files in as AtFS versions, trying to keep as many attributes
       as possible.

       <b>The</b> <b>RCS</b> <b>archives</b> <b>are</b> <b>left</b> <b>unchanged.</b>

       It  is  recommended  to  create  a  special  directory  with  the name RCS for the RCS archives, but AtFS
       histories are <u>always</u> kept in a special directory AtFS.

       <b>Rcs2atfs</b> treats its arguments as names of RCS archives.  These can be the  names  of  the  archive  files
       themselves, ending with ,v, or the names of the files stored in the archives.

       If  the  <b>-R</b>  option  is  given,  the  arguments are interpreted as directory names.  <b>Rcs2atfs</b> recursively
       descends each directory tree (symbolic links are followed) and converts the RCS archives  it  finds.  The
       correspondig AtFS archives are created where the RCS archives are found.

       <b>Rcs2atfs</b>  tries  to  keep  the  revision numbers of the RCS history also as AtFS version numbers. This is
       impossible if an RCS history contains branches. In this case the revisions are saved as AtFS versions  in
       the  order  of their check-in date. In either case the RCS revision number is kept as a symbolic name for
       the corresponding AtFS version, e.g. the AtFS version of RCS revision 1.2 will  have  the  symbolic  name
       ``r1.2''.

   <b>Attributes</b> <b>that</b> <b>don't</b> <b>change:</b>
       •
        author

       •
        log message

       •
        comment leader

       •
        description

       •
        symbolic names (with the exception of the <u>additional</u> symbolic name derived from the RCS revision number)

   <b>Other</b> <b>attributes:</b>
       mtime  set to the check-in date of the RCS revision

       state  The value of this attribute is given to the AtFS attribute RCSstate.  If it has the value Exp, the
              state  of  the  AtFS  version  will  be  saved,  if  Stab, it will be proposed, if Rel, it will be
              published.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-R</b>     (recursive)
              The arguments are treated as  directories.   <b>Rcs2atfs</b>  recursively  descends  the  directory  tree
              (symbolic links are followed) and builds an AtFS archive for each RCS archive it finds.

       <b>-o</b> <u>outputfile</u>
              <b>rcs2atfs</b>  writes shell commands to <u>outputfile</u>, not directly to <a href="file:/bin/sh">/bin/sh</a>, and no conversion is done.
              If this shell script is executed from the directory where <b>rcs2atfs</b> was invoked, the  archives  are
              converted as if <b>rcs2atfs</b> had been invoked without <b>-o</b>.
              The main use of this option is to investigate problems with the conversion of archives.

       <b>-q</b>     (quiet)
              The names and revision numbers of converted archives are not echoed on standard output.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       The command

              rcs2atfs -R $HOME/development

       traverses the directory tree $HOME/development and converts every RCS archive in it into an AtFS archive.
       During  the  conversion,  the  name  of every RCS archive and every revision number is echoed on standard
       output.

              rcs2atfs -q RCS/*

       Each archive in the RCS directory is converted to an AtFS history. The names and revision numbers of  the
       converted archives are not echoed.

       <a href="../man1/sh.1.html">sh</a>(1), <a href="../man1/rcsintro.1.html">rcsintro</a>(1), <a href="../man1/rcs.1.html">rcs</a>(1), <a href="../man1/rlog.1.html">rlog</a>(1), <a href="../man1/co.1.html">co</a>(1), <a href="../man1/vcintro.1.html">vcintro</a>(1), <a href="../man1/save.1.html">save</a>(1), <a href="../man1/vadm.1.html">vadm</a>(1), <a href="../man1/utime.1.html">utime</a>(1)

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Warnings</b>
       -R flag not set, directory skipped
              If the <b>-R</b> flag is not set, directories given as arguments in the command line are ignored.

       locked version(s) exist
              A  revision  of  the  specified  RCS  history is locked. This is not really a problem, but perhaps
              <b>rcs2atfs</b> does not convert the most recent version of the file.

       branches exist, can't keep revision numbers
              If the RCS history contains branches, the numbers of AtFS versions cannot be the same as those  of
              the corresponding RCS revisions.

       symbolic name to non-existent revision
              <u>rlog</u> has reported a symbolic name of a revision that does not exist in this archive. Probably this
              never happens (I don't know), but if, the symbolic name is ignored.

   <b>Errors</b>
       ATFS history exists, file skipped
              The  specified file is already known to AtFS as a history or a busy version. This file will nor be
              converted.

       colon after symbolic name missing, file skipped
       revision not found, file skipped
       date not found, file skipped
       author not found, file skipped
       status not found, file skipped
       rlog information missing, file skipped

              These messages indicate problems with the <u>rlog</u> output,  perhaps  an  old  rlog  version  is  used.
              (<b>rcs2atfs</b> works correctly with <u>rlog</u> version 5.5.)
              The specified file will not be converted.

       rlog command failed, file skipped
              For  some  unknown  reason  <u>rlog</u>  returned  a  non-zero exit status.  <u>rlog</u> should have provided an
              explanatory message.

   <b>Fatal</b> <b>Errors</b>
       popen to rlog command failed
              The <u>rlog</u> command could not be invoked.

       popen to shell failed
              The shell could not be invoked.

       no more core
              <b>Rcs2atfs</b> could not allocate enough memory.  The  amount  of  memory  in  your  machine  should  be
              increased.

   <b>Internal</b> <b>Errors</b>
       Oops? Unknown reader state in readin_rcsfile!
       revision numbers corrupted
       number of revisions is wrong!

              You should never see these error messages.

</pre><h4><b>CAVEATS</b></h4><pre>
       If  <b>rcs2atfs</b>  visits  the same RCS archive twice (e.g. because a symbolic link is followed to a directory
       which is also accessed directly), the check for existing AtFS archives may be done a second  time  before
       the  conversion commands from the first visit are executed by the shell. This results in lots of annoying
       messages and duplicate AtFS versions of RCS revisions. To avoid this, make  sure  that  <b>rcs2atfs</b>  doesn't
       reach a directory twice.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Rcs2atfs</b> is rather slow since it invokes a shell command for every action.

       Attribute  citations  in  files  are  not  translated  from  RCS  to  AtFS  (e.g.   ``$Header: ... $'' to
       ``$__Header$'').

       <b>Rcs2atfs</b> strongly relies on the format of <u>rlog</u>'s output. Since I don't  know  any  other  <u>rlog</u>  than  our
       version (5.5), it may fail to work with other versions.

       Due  to the lack of serious RCS archives, <b>rcs2atfs</b> isn't thoroughly tested yet. (Well, we use ShapeTools.
       :-)
