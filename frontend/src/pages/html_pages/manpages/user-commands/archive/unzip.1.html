</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       unzip - list, test and extract compressed files in a ZIP archive

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>unzip</b> [<b>-Z</b>] [<b>-cflptTuvz</b>[<b>abjnoqsCDKLMUVWX$/:^</b>]] <u>file</u>[<u>.zip</u>] [<u>file(s)</u> ...]  [<b>-x</b> <u>xfile(s)</u> ...] [<b>-d</b> <u>exdir</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>unzip</u>  will  list,  test,  or  extract  files  from a ZIP archive, commonly found on MS-DOS systems.  The
       default behavior (with no options) is to extract into the current directory (and subdirectories below it)
       all files from the specified ZIP archive.  A  companion  program,  <u><a href="../man1/zip.1.html">zip</a></u>(1),  creates  ZIP  archives;  both
       programs are compatible with archives created by PKWARE's <u>PKZIP</u> and <u>PKUNZIP</u> for MS-DOS, but in many cases
       the program options or default behaviors differ.

</pre><h4><b>ARGUMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>file</u>[<u>.zip</u>]
              Path  of  the  ZIP  archive(s).   If  the  file specification is a wildcard, each matching file is
              processed in an order determined by the operating system (or file system).  Only the filename  can
              be  a  wildcard;  the  path itself cannot.  Wildcard expressions are similar to those supported in
              commonly used Unix shells (<u>sh</u>, <u>ksh</u>, <u>csh</u>) and may contain:

              *      matches a sequence of 0 or more characters

              ?      matches exactly 1 character

              [...]  matches any single character found inside the brackets; ranges are specified by a beginning
                     character, a hyphen, and an ending character.  If an exclamation point or a caret  (`!'  or
                     `^')  follows  the  left  bracket,  then  the  range  of  characters within the brackets is
                     complemented (that is, anything <u>except</u> the characters inside the brackets is  considered  a
                     match).  To specify a verbatim left bracket, the three-character sequence ``[[]'' has to be
                     used.

              (Be  sure  to quote any character that might otherwise be interpreted or modified by the operating
              system, particularly under Unix and VMS.)  If no matches are found, the specification  is  assumed
              to  be  a  literal filename; and if that also fails, the suffix .zip is appended.  Note that self-
              extracting ZIP files are supported, as with any other ZIP archive; just specify  the  .exe  suffix
              (if any) explicitly.

       [<u>file(s)</u>]
              An  optional list of archive members to be processed, separated by spaces.  (VMS versions compiled
              with VMSCLI defined must delimit files with commas instead.  See <b>-v</b> in  <b>OPTIONS</b>  below.)   Regular
              expressions (wildcards) may be used to match multiple members; see above.  Again, be sure to quote
              expressions that would otherwise be expanded or modified by the operating system.

       [<b>-x</b> <u>xfile(s)</u>]
              An  optional  list  of  archive members to be excluded from processing.  Since wildcard characters
              normally match (`/') directory separators (for exceptions see the option <b>-W</b>), this option  may  be
              used  to  exclude  any files that are in subdirectories.  For example, ``unzip foo *.[ch] -x */*''
              would extract all C source files in the main directory, but none in any  subdirectories.   Without
              the <b>-x</b> option, all C source files in all directories within the zipfile would be extracted.

       [<b>-d</b> <u>exdir</u>]
              An  optional  directory  to  which to extract files.  By default, all files and subdirectories are
              recreated in the current directory; the <b>-d</b> option allows  extraction  in  an  arbitrary  directory
              (always  assuming  one  has permission to write to the directory).  This option need not appear at
              the end of the command line; it is also accepted before the zipfile specification (with the normal
              options), immediately after the zipfile specification, or between the <u>file(s)</u> and the  <b>-x</b>  option.
              The  option  and directory may be concatenated without any white space between them, but note that
              this may cause normal shell behavior  to  be  suppressed.   In  particular,  ``-d ~''  (tilde)  is
              expanded  by Unix C shells into the name of the user's home directory, but ``-d~'' is treated as a
              literal subdirectory ``<b>~</b>'' of the current directory.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Note that, in order to support obsolescent hardware, <u>unzip</u>'s usage screen is limited to 22  or  23  lines
       and  should  therefore  be considered only a reminder of the basic <u>unzip</u> syntax rather than an exhaustive
       list of all possible flags.  The exhaustive list follows:

       <b>-Z</b>     <u><a href="../man1/zipinfo.1.html">zipinfo</a></u>(1) mode.  If the first option on the command line is <b>-Z</b>, the remaining options  are  taken
              to be <u><a href="../man1/zipinfo.1.html">zipinfo</a></u>(1) options.  See the appropriate manual page for a description of these options.

       <b>-A</b>     [OS/2, Unix DLL] print extended help for the DLL's programming interface (API).

       <b>-c</b>     extract files to stdout/screen (``CRT'').  This option is similar to the <b>-p</b> option except that the
              name  of  each  file  is  printed  as  it is extracted, the <b>-a</b> option is allowed, and ASCII-EBCDIC
              conversion is automatically performed if appropriate.  This option is  not  listed  in  the  <u>unzip</u>
              usage screen.

       <b>-f</b>     freshen  existing  files,  i.e.,  extract only those files that already exist on disk and that are
              newer than the disk copies.  By default <u>unzip</u> queries before overwriting, but the <b>-o</b> option may be
              used to suppress the  queries.   Note  that  under  many  operating  systems,  the  TZ  (timezone)
              environment variable must be set correctly in order for <b>-f</b> and <b>-u</b> to work properly (under Unix the
              variable  is  usually set automatically).  The reasons for this are somewhat subtle but have to do
              with the differences between DOS-format file times  (always  local  time)  and  Unix-format  times
              (always  in  GMT/UTC) and the necessity to compare the two.  A typical TZ value is ``PST8PDT'' (US
              Pacific time with automatic adjustment for Daylight Savings Time or ``summer time'').

       <b>-l</b>     list archive files (short format).  The names, uncompressed file sizes and modification dates  and
              times of the specified files are printed, along with totals for all files specified.  If UnZip was
              compiled  with  OS2_EAS  defined,  the  <b>-l</b>  option also lists columns for the sizes of stored OS/2
              extended attributes (EAs) and OS/2 access control lists (ACLs).  In addition, the zipfile  comment
              and  individual  file  comments (if any) are displayed.  If a file was archived from a single-case
              file system (for example, the old MS-DOS FAT file  system)  and  the  <b>-L</b>  option  was  given,  the
              filename is converted to lowercase and is prefixed with a caret (^).

       <b>-p</b>     extract  files  to  pipe (stdout).  Nothing but the file data is sent to stdout, and the files are
              always extracted in binary format, just as they are stored (no conversions).

       <b>-t</b>     test archive files.  This option extracts each specified file  in  memory  and  compares  the  CRC
              (cyclic  redundancy  check,  an  enhanced  checksum) of the expanded file with the original file's
              stored CRC value.

       <b>-T</b>     [most OSes] set the timestamp on the archive(s) to that of the newest  file  in  each  one.   This
              corresponds  to <u>zip</u>'s <b>-go</b> option except that it can be used on wildcard zipfiles (e.g., ``unzip -T
              \*.zip'') and is much faster.

       <b>-u</b>     update existing files and create new ones if needed.  This option performs the  same  function  as
              the <b>-f</b> option, extracting (with query) files that are newer than those with the same name on disk,
              and  in  addition  it  extracts  those  files that do not already exist on disk.  See <b>-f</b> above for
              information on setting the timezone properly.

       <b>-v</b>     list archive files (verbose format) or show diagnostic version info.  This option has evolved  and
              now  behaves  as both an option and a modifier.  As an option it has two purposes:  when a zipfile
              is specified with no other options, <b>-v</b> lists archive files verbosely, adding to the basic <b>-l</b>  info
              the compression method, compressed size, compression ratio and 32-bit CRC.  In contrast to most of
              the  competing  utilities,  <u>unzip</u> removes the 12 additional header bytes of encrypted entries from
              the compressed size numbers.   Therefore,  compressed  size  and  compression  ratio  figures  are
              independent  of  the entry's encryption status and show the correct compression performance.  (The
              complete size of the encrypted compressed data stream for zipfile entries is reported by the  more
              verbose  <u><a href="../man1/zipinfo.1.html">zipinfo</a></u>(1) reports, see the separate manual.)  When no zipfile is specified (that is, the
              complete command is simply ``unzip -v''), a diagnostic screen is  printed.   In  addition  to  the
              normal  header  with release date and version, <u>unzip</u> lists the home Info-ZIP ftp site and where to
              find a list of other ftp and non-ftp sites; the target operating system for which it was compiled,
              as well as (possibly) the hardware on which it was compiled, the compiler and  version  used,  and
              the  compilation  date;  any special compilation options that might affect the program's operation
              (see also <b>DECRYPTION</b> below); and any options stored in environment variables  that  might  do  the
              same  (see  <b>ENVIRONMENT</b>  <b>OPTIONS</b> below).  As a modifier it works in conjunction with other options
              (e.g., <b>-t</b>) to produce more verbose or debugging output; this is not yet fully implemented but will
              be in future releases.

       <b>-z</b>     display only the archive comment.

</pre><h4><b>MODIFIERS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-a</b>     convert text files.  Ordinarily all files are extracted exactly as they are stored (as  ``binary''
              files).   The  <b>-a</b> option causes files identified by <u>zip</u> as text files (those with the `t' label in
              <u>zipinfo</u> listings, rather than `b') to be automatically extracted as such, converting line endings,
              end-of-file characters and the character set itself as necessary.  (For example,  Unix  files  use
              line  feeds  (LFs)  for  end-of-line  (EOL)  and have no end-of-file (EOF) marker; Macintoshes use
              carriage returns (CRs) for EOLs; and most PC operating systems use CR+LF for  EOLs  and  control-Z
              for  EOF.  In addition, IBM mainframes and the Michigan Terminal System use EBCDIC rather than the
              more common ASCII character set, and NT supports Unicode.)  Note that <u>zip</u>'s identification of text
              files is by no means perfect; some ``text'' files may actually be binary and  vice  versa.   <u>unzip</u>
              therefore prints ``[text]'' or ``[binary]'' as a visual check for each file it extracts when using
              the  <b>-a</b>  option.   The  <b>-aa</b>  option  forces  all  files to be extracted as text, regardless of the
              supposed file type.  On VMS, see also <b>-S</b>.

       <b>-b</b>     [general] treat all files as binary (no text conversions).  This is a shortcut for <b>---a</b>.

       <b>-b</b>     [Tandem] force the creation files with filecode type 180 ('C') when extracting Zip entries  marked
              as "text". (On Tandem, <b>-a</b> is enabled by default, see above).

       <b>-b</b>     [VMS]  auto-convert binary files (see <b>-a</b> above) to fixed-length, 512-byte record format.  Doubling
              the option (<b>-bb</b>) forces all files to be extracted in this  format.  When  extracting  to  standard
              output  (<b>-c</b>  or <b>-p</b> option in effect), the default conversion of text record delimiters is disabled
              for binary (<b>-b</b>) resp. all (<b>-bb</b>) files.

       <b>-B</b>     [when compiled with UNIXBACKUP defined] save a backup copy of each overwritten  file.  The  backup
              file  is gets the name of the target file with a tilde and optionally a unique sequence number (up
              to 5 digits) appended.  The sequence number is applied whenever another  file  with  the  original
              name  plus  tilde already exists.  When used together with the "overwrite all" option <b>-o</b>, numbered
              backup files are never created. In this case, all backup files are named as the original file with
              an appended tilde, existing backup files are deleted without notice.  This feature works similarly
              to the default behavior of <u><a href="../man1/emacs.1.html">emacs</a></u>(1) in many locations.

              Example: the old copy of ``foo'' is renamed to ``foo~''.

              Warning: Users should be aware that the <b>-B</b> option does not prevent loss of existing data under all
              circumstances.  For example, when <u>unzip</u> is run in overwrite-all mode, an existing ``foo~'' file is
              deleted before <u>unzip</u> attempts to rename ``foo'' to  ``foo~''.   When  this  rename  attempt  fails
              (because  of  a  file  locks,  insufficient  privileges,  or ...), the extraction of ``foo~'' gets
              cancelled, but the old backup file is already lost.  A  similar  scenario  takes  place  when  the
              sequence  number  range  for  numbered  backup  files  gets  exhausted (99999, or 65535 for 16-bit
              systems).  In this case, the backup file with the maximum sequence number is deleted and  replaced
              by the new backup version without notice.

       <b>-C</b>     use  case-insensitive  matching for the selection of archive entries from the command-line list of
              extract selection patterns.  <u>unzip</u>'s philosophy is ``you get what you  ask  for''  (this  is  also
              responsible  for the <b>-L</b>/<b>-U</b> change; see the relevant options below).  Because some file systems are
              fully case-sensitive (notably those under the Unix operating system) and because both ZIP archives
              and <u>unzip</u> itself are portable across platforms, <u>unzip</u>'s default behavior is to match both wildcard
              and literal filenames case-sensitively.  That is, specifying ``makefile'' on the command line will
              <u>only</u> match ``makefile'' in the archive,  not  ``Makefile''  or  ``MAKEFILE''  (and  similarly  for
              wildcard  specifications).   Since  this  does  not  correspond  to  the  behavior  of  many other
              operating/file systems (for example, OS/2 HPFS, which preserves mixed case but is not sensitive to
              it), the <b>-C</b> option may be used to force all filename  matches  to  be  case-insensitive.   In  the
              example  above,  all three files would then match ``makefile'' (or ``make*'', or similar).  The <b>-C</b>
              option affects file specs in both the normal file list and the excluded-file list (xlist).

              Please note that the <b>-C</b> option does neither affect the search for the zipfile(s) nor the  matching
              of  archive  entries  to  existing files on the extraction path.  On a case-sensitive file system,
              <u>unzip</u> will never try to overwrite a file ``FOO'' when extracting an entry ``foo''!

       <b>-D</b>     skip restoration of timestamps for extracted items.  Normally, <u>unzip</u> tries to  restore  all  meta-
              information  for  extracted  items  that  are  supplied  in  the  Zip  archive (and do not require
              privileges or impose a security risk).  By specifying <b>-D</b>, <u>unzip</u> is told to suppress restoration of
              timestamps for directories explicitly created from Zip archive entries.  This option only  applies
              to  ports  that  support  setting timestamps for directories (currently ATheOS, BeOS, MacOS, OS/2,
              Unix, VMS, Win32, for other <u>unzip</u> ports, <b>-D</b> has no effect).   The  duplicated  option  <b>-DD</b>  forces
              suppression  of  timestamp  restoration  for  all extracted entries (files and directories).  This
              option results in setting the timestamps for all extracted entries to the current time.

              On VMS, the default setting for this option is <b>-D</b> for consistency with the  behaviour  of  BACKUP:
              file  timestamps  are  restored, timestamps of extracted directories are left at the current time.
              To enable restoration of directory timestamps, the negated option <b>--D</b>  should  be  specified.   On
              VMS,  the  option <b>-D</b> disables timestamp restoration for all extracted Zip archive items.  (Here, a
              single <b>-D</b> on the command line combines with the default <b>-D</b> to do what  an  explicit  <b>-DD</b>  does  on
              other systems.)

       <b>-E</b>     [MacOS only] display contents of MacOS extra field during restore operation.

       <b>-F</b>     [Acorn only] suppress removal of NFS filetype extension from stored filenames.

       <b>-F</b>     [non-Acorn  systems  supporting  long  filenames  with  embedded commas, and only if compiled with
              ACORN_FTYPE_NFS defined] translate filetype information from ACORN RISC OS extra field blocks into
              a NFS filetype extension and append it to the names of the  extracted  files.   (When  the  stored
              filename  appears  to  already have an appended NFS filetype extension, it is replaced by the info
              from the extra field.)

       <b>-i</b>     [MacOS only] ignore filenames stored in MacOS extra fields. Instead, the most compatible  filename
              stored in the generic part of the entry's header is used.

       <b>-I</b> <u>CHARSET</u>
              [UNIX only] Specify a character encoding for UNIX and other archives.

       <b>-j</b>     junk  paths.   The  archive's directory structure is not recreated; all files are deposited in the
              extraction directory (by default, the current one).

       <b>-J</b>     [BeOS only] junk file attributes.  The file's BeOS file attributes  are  not  restored,  just  the
              file's data.

       <b>-J</b>     [MacOS  only]  ignore  MacOS  extra fields.  All Macintosh specific info is skipped. Data-fork and
              resource-fork are restored as separate files.

       <b>-K</b>     [AtheOS, BeOS, Unix only] retain  SUID/SGID/Tacky  file  attributes.   Without  this  flag,  these
              attribute bits are cleared for security reasons.

       <b>-L</b>     convert  to  lowercase  any  filename  originating  on  an uppercase-only operating system or file
              system.  (This was <u>unzip</u>'s default behavior in releases prior to 5.11; the new default behavior is
              identical to the old behavior with the <b>-U</b> option, which is now obsolete and will be removed  in  a
              future  release.)   Depending on the archiver, files archived under single-case file systems (VMS,
              old MS-DOS FAT, etc.) may be stored as all-uppercase names; this can be ugly or inconvenient  when
              extracting  to  a  case-preserving  file  system such as OS/2 HPFS or a case-sensitive one such as
              under Unix.  By default <u>unzip</u>  lists  and  extracts  such  filenames  exactly  as  they're  stored
              (excepting  truncation,  conversion of unsupported characters, etc.); this option causes the names
              of all files from certain systems to be converted to lowercase.  The <b>-LL</b> option forces  conversion
              of every filename to lowercase, regardless of the originating file system.

       <b>-M</b>     pipe  all  output  through an internal pager similar to the Unix <u><a href="../man1/more.1.html">more</a></u>(1) command.  At the end of a
              screenful of output, <u>unzip</u> pauses with a ``--More--'' prompt; the next screenful may be viewed  by
              pressing  the  Enter (Return) key or the space bar.  <u>unzip</u> can be terminated by pressing the ``q''
              key and, on some systems, the Enter/Return  key.   Unlike  Unix  <u><a href="../man1/more.1.html">more</a></u>(1),  there  is  no  forward-
              searching or editing capability.  Also, <u>unzip</u> doesn't notice if long lines wrap at the edge of the
              screen,  effectively  resulting  in the printing of two or more lines and the likelihood that some
              text will scroll off the top of the screen before being viewed.  On some  systems  the  number  of
              available lines on the screen is not detected, in which case <u>unzip</u> assumes the height is 24 lines.

       <b>-n</b>     never  overwrite  existing  files.   If  a  file  already exists, skip the extraction of that file
              without prompting.  By default <u>unzip</u> queries before extracting any file that already  exists;  the
              user  may  choose  to overwrite only the current file, overwrite all files, skip extraction of the
              current file, skip extraction of all existing files, or rename the current file.

       <b>-N</b>     [Amiga] extract file comments as Amiga filenotes.  File comments are created with the -c option of
              <u><a href="../man1/zip.1.html">zip</a></u>(1), or with the -N option of the Amiga port of <u><a href="../man1/zip.1.html">zip</a></u>(1), which stores filenotes as comments.

       <b>-o</b>     overwrite existing files without prompting.  This is a dangerous option, so use it with care.  (It
              is often used with <b>-f</b>, however, and is the only way to overwrite directory EAs under OS/2.)

       <b>-O</b> <u>CHARSET</u>
              [UNIX only] Specify a character encoding for DOS, Windows and OS/2 archives.

       <b>-P</b> <u>password</u>
              use <u>password</u> to decrypt encrypted zipfile entries (if any).  <b>THIS</b> <b>IS</b>  <b>INSECURE!</b>   Many  multi-user
              operating  systems  provide  ways  for any user to see the current command line of any other user;
              even on stand-alone systems there is always the threat of over-the-shoulder peeking.  Storing  the
              plaintext  password  as  part  of  a  command line in an automated script is even worse.  Whenever
              possible, use the non-echoing, interactive prompt to enter  passwords.   (And  where  security  is
              truly  important, use strong encryption such as Pretty Good Privacy instead of the relatively weak
              encryption provided by standard zipfile utilities.)

       <b>-q</b>     perform operations quietly (<b>-qq</b> = even quieter).  Ordinarily <u>unzip</u> prints the names of  the  files
              it's  extracting  or  testing,  the  extraction  methods, any file or zipfile comments that may be
              stored in the archive, and possibly a summary when finished with each archive.  The <b>-q</b>[<b>q</b>]  options
              suppress the printing of some or all of these messages.

       <b>-s</b>     [OS/2,  NT,  MS-DOS]  convert  spaces in filenames to underscores.  Since all PC operating systems
              allow spaces in  filenames,  <u>unzip</u>  by  default  extracts  filenames  with  spaces  intact  (e.g.,
              ``EA DATA. SF'').   This  can  be awkward, however, since MS-DOS in particular does not gracefully
              support spaces in filenames.  Conversion of spaces to underscores can eliminate the awkwardness in
              some cases.

       <b>-S</b>     [VMS] convert text files (<b>-a</b>, <b>-aa</b>) into Stream_LF record format, instead of the text-file default,
              variable-length record format.  (Stream_LF is the default  record  format  of  VMS  <u>unzip</u>.  It  is
              applied  unless  conversion  (<b>-a</b>,  <b>-aa</b>  and/or  <b>-b</b>,  <b>-bb</b>)  is requested or a VMS-specific entry is
              processed.)

       <b>-U</b>     [UNICODE_SUPPORT only] modify or disable UTF-8 handling.  When UNICODE_SUPPORT is  available,  the
              option <b>-U</b> forces <u>unzip</u> to escape all non-ASCII characters from UTF-8 coded filenames as ``#Uxxxx''
              (for  UCS-2  characters, or ``#Lxxxxxx'' for unicode codepoints needing 3 octets).  This option is
              mainly provided for debugging purpose when the fairly new UTF-8 support is suspected to mangle  up
              extracted filenames.

              The  option  <b>-UU</b>  allows  to  entirely  disable  the  recognition of UTF-8 encoded filenames.  The
              handling of filename codings within <u>unzip</u> falls back to the behaviour of previous versions.

              [old, obsolete usage] leave filenames uppercase if created under MS-DOS, VMS, etc.  See <b>-L</b> above.

       <b>-V</b>     retain (VMS) file version numbers.  VMS files can be stored with a version number, in  the  format
              file.ext;##.   By default the ``;##'' version numbers are stripped, but this option allows them to
              be retained.  (On file systems that limit filenames to particularly  short  lengths,  the  version
              numbers may be truncated or stripped regardless of this option.)

       <b>-W</b>     [only  when WILD_STOP_AT_DIR compile-time option enabled] modifies the pattern matching routine so
              that both `?' (single-char wildcard) and `*' (multi-char wildcard)  do  not  match  the  directory
              separator  character  `/'.   (The two-character sequence ``**'' acts as a multi-char wildcard that
              includes the directory separator in its matched characters.)  Examples:

           "*.c" matches "foo.c" but not "mydir/foo.c"
           "**.c" matches both "foo.c" and "mydir/foo.c"
           "*/*.c" matches "bar/foo.c" but not "baz/bar/foo.c"
           "??*/*" matches "ab/foo" and "abc/foo"
                   but not "a/foo" or "a/b/foo"

              This modified behaviour is equivalent to the pattern matching style used by the shells of some  of
              UnZip's  supported target OSs (one example is Acorn RISC OS).  This option may not be available on
              systems where the Zip archive's internal directory separator character `/' is allowed  as  regular
              character  in native operating system filenames.  (Currently, UnZip uses the same pattern matching
              rules for both wildcard zipfile specifications and zip entry selection  patterns  in  most  ports.
              For  systems  allowing `/' as regular filename character, the -W option would not work as expected
              on a wildcard zipfile specification.)

       <b>-X</b>     [VMS, Unix, OS/2, NT, Tandem] restore owner/protection info (UICs and ACL entries) under  VMS,  or
              user  and  group  info (UID/GID) under Unix, or access control lists (ACLs) under certain network-
              enabled versions of OS/2 (Warp Server with IBM LAN Server/Requester 3.0 to 5.0; Warp Connect  with
              IBM  Peer 1.0), or security ACLs under Windows NT.  In most cases this will require special system
              privileges, and doubling the  option  (<b>-XX</b>)  under  NT  instructs  <u>unzip</u>  to  use  privileges  for
              extraction;  but  under  Unix, for example, a user who belongs to several groups can restore files
              owned by any of those groups, as long as the user IDs match his or her own.   Note  that  ordinary
              file  attributes  are  always restored--this option applies only to optional, extra ownership info
              available on some operating systems.  [NT's access control lists do not appear  to  be  especially
              compatible  with OS/2's, so no attempt is made at cross-platform portability of access privileges.
              It is not clear under what conditions this would ever be useful anyway.]

       <b>-Y</b>     [VMS] treat archived file name endings of ``.nnn'' (where ``nnn'' is a decimal  number) as if they
              were VMS version numbers (``;nnn'').  (The default is to treat them as file types.)  Example:
                   "a.b.3" -&gt; "a.b;3".

       <b>-$</b>     [MS-DOS, OS/2, NT] restore the volume label  if  the  extraction  medium  is  removable  (e.g.,  a
              diskette).   Doubling the option (<b>-$$</b>) allows fixed media (hard disks) to be labelled as well.  By
              default, volume labels are ignored.

       <b>-/</b> <u>extensions</u>
              [Acorn only] overrides the extension list  supplied  by  Unzip$Ext  environment  variable.  During
              extraction,  filename extensions that match one of the items in this extension list are swapped in
              front of the base name of the extracted file.

       <b>-:</b>     [all but Acorn, VM/CMS, MVS, Tandem] allows to extract archive members into locations  outside  of
              the  current  ``  extraction  root folder''. For security reasons, <u>unzip</u> normally removes ``parent
              dir'' path components (``../'') from the names of extracted file.  This safety  feature  (new  for
              version  5.50)  prevents  <u>unzip</u> from accidentally writing files to ``sensitive'' areas outside the
              active extraction folder tree head.  The <b>-:</b> option lets <u>unzip</u> switch back to  its  previous,  more
              liberal  behaviour,  to allow exact extraction of (older) archives that used ``../'' components to
              create multiple directory trees at the level of the current extraction folder.  This  option  does
              not  enable writing explicitly to the root directory (``/'').  To achieve this, it is necessary to
              set the extraction target folder to root (e.g. <b>-d</b> <b>/</b> ).  However, when the <b>-:</b> option is  specified,
              it  is  still possible to implicitly write to the root directory by specifying enough ``../'' path
              components within the zip archive.  Use this option with extreme caution.

       <b>-^</b>     [Unix only] allow control characters in names of extracted ZIP archive entries.  On Unix,  a  file
              name  may  contain any (8-bit) character code with the two exception '/' (directory delimiter) and
              NUL (0x00, the C  string  termination  indicator),  unless  the  specific  file  system  has  more
              restrictive  conventions.   Generally,  this  allows  to  embed  ASCII control characters (or even
              sophisticated control sequences) in file names, at least on 'native' Unix file systems.   However,
              it  may  be  highly suspicious to make use of this Unix "feature".  Embedded control characters in
              file names might have nasty side effects when displayed on screen by  some  listing  code  without
              sufficient  filtering.   And,  for  ordinary  users, it may be difficult to handle such file names
              (e.g. when trying to specify it for open, copy, move, or  delete  operations).   Therefore,  <u>unzip</u>
              applies  a  filter  by  default  that  removes  potentially  dangerous control characters from the
              extracted file names. The <b>-^</b> option allows to override this filter in the rare case that  embedded
              filename control characters are to be intentionally restored.

       <b>-2</b>     [VMS]  force unconditionally conversion of file names to ODS2-compatible names.  The default is to
              exploit the destination file system, preserving case and extended file name characters on an  ODS5
              destination  file  system;  and  applying  the  ODS2-compatibility  file name filtering on an ODS2
              destination file system.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>unzip</u>'s default behavior may be modified via options placed in an environment variable.  This can be done
       with any option, but it is probably most useful with the <b>-a</b>, <b>-L</b>, <b>-C</b>, <b>-q</b>, <b>-o</b>, or <b>-n</b> modifiers:  make <u>unzip</u>
       auto-convert text files by default, make it convert filenames from uppercase systems to  lowercase,  make
       it  match names case-insensitively, make it quieter, or make it always overwrite or never overwrite files
       as it extracts them.  For example, to make <u>unzip</u> act as quietly as possible, only reporting  errors,  one
       would use one of the following commands:

         Unix Bourne shell:
              UNZIP=-qq; export UNZIP

         Unix C shell:
              setenv UNZIP -qq

         OS/2 or MS-DOS:
              set UNZIP=-qq

         VMS (quotes for <u>lowercase</u>):
              define UNZIP_OPTS "-qq"

       Environment  options  are,  in  effect, considered to be just like any other command-line options, except
       that they are effectively the first options on the command line.  To override an environment option,  one
       may  use  the  ``minus  operator'' to remove it.  For instance, to override one of the quiet-flags in the
       example above, use the command

       unzip --q[<u>other</u> <u>options</u>] zipfile

       The first hyphen is the normal switch character, and the second is a minus sign, acting on the q  option.
       Thus  the  effect  here is to cancel one quantum of quietness.  To cancel both quiet flags, two (or more)
       minuses may be used:

       unzip -t--q zipfile
       unzip ---qt zipfile

       (the two are equivalent).  This may seem awkward or confusing, but  it  is  reasonably  intuitive:   just
       ignore the first hyphen and go from there.  It is also consistent with the behavior of Unix <u><a href="../man1/nice.1.html">nice</a></u>(1).

       As  suggested  by the examples above, the default variable names are UNZIP_OPTS for VMS (where the symbol
       used to install <u>unzip</u> as a foreign command would otherwise be confused with  the  environment  variable),
       and  UNZIP  for  all  other  operating systems.  For compatibility with <u><a href="../man1/zip.1.html">zip</a></u>(1), UNZIPOPT is also accepted
       (don't ask).  If both  UNZIP  and  UNZIPOPT  are  defined,  however,  UNZIP  takes  precedence.   <u>unzip</u>'s
       diagnostic  option  (<b>-v</b>  with no zipfile name) can be used to check the values of all four possible <u>unzip</u>
       and <u>zipinfo</u> environment variables.

       The timezone variable (TZ) should be set according to the local timezone in order for the <b>-f</b>  and  <b>-u</b>  to
       operate  correctly.  See the description of <b>-f</b> above for details.  This variable may also be necessary to
       get timestamps of extracted files to be set correctly.  The WIN32 (Win9x/ME/NT4/2K/XP/2K3) port of  <u>unzip</u>
       gets  the  timezone  configuration  from the registry, assuming it is correctly set in the Control Panel.
       The TZ variable is ignored for this port.

</pre><h4><b>DECRYPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Encrypted  archives  are  fully  supported  by  Info-ZIP  software,  but  due  to  United  States  export
       restrictions,  de-/encryption  support  might be disabled in your compiled binary.  However, since spring
       2000, US export restrictions have been liberated, and our source archives do now include full crypt code.
       In case you need binary distributions with crypt support enabled, see the file ``WHERE'' in any  Info-ZIP
       source or binary distribution for locations both inside and outside the US.

       Some compiled versions of <u>unzip</u> may not support decryption.  To check a version for crypt support, either
       attempt  to  test  or  extract  an encrypted archive, or else check <u>unzip</u>'s diagnostic screen (see the <b>-v</b>
       option above) for ``[decryption]'' as one of the special compilation options.

       As noted above, the <b>-P</b> option may be used to supply a password on the command line,  but  at  a  cost  in
       security.   The  preferred  decryption  method  is  simply  to  extract  normally; if a zipfile member is
       encrypted, <u>unzip</u> will prompt for the password without echoing what is typed.  <u>unzip</u> continues to use  the
       same  password  as long as it appears to be valid, by testing a 12-byte header on each file.  The correct
       password will always check out against the header, but there is  a  1-in-256  chance  that  an  incorrect
       password will as well.  (This is a security feature of the PKWARE zipfile format; it helps prevent brute-
       force attacks that might otherwise gain a large speed advantage by testing only the header.)  In the case
       that an incorrect password is given but it passes the header test anyway, either an incorrect CRC will be
       generated  for the extracted data or else <u>unzip</u> will fail during the extraction because the ``decrypted''
       bytes do not constitute a valid compressed data stream.

       If the first password fails the header check on some file, <u>unzip</u> will prompt for another password, and so
       on until all files are extracted.  If a password is not known, entering a null password (that is, just  a
       carriage return or ``Enter'') is taken as a signal to skip all further prompting.  Only unencrypted files
       in  the  archive(s)  will  thereafter  be  extracted.  (In fact, that's not quite true; older versions of
       <u><a href="../man1/zip.1.html">zip</a></u>(1) and <u><a href="../man1/zipcloak.1.html">zipcloak</a></u>(1) allowed null passwords, so <u>unzip</u> checks each encrypted file to  see  if  the  null
       password works.  This may result in ``false positives'' and extraction errors, as noted above.)

       Archives  encrypted  with  8-bit passwords (for example, passwords with accented European characters) may
       not be portable across systems and/or other archivers.  This problem  stems  from  the  use  of  multiple
       encoding  methods  for  such characters, including Latin-1 (ISO 8859-1) and OEM code page 850.  DOS <u>PKZIP</u>
       2.04g uses the OEM code page; Windows <u>PKZIP</u> 2.50 uses Latin-1 (and is  therefore  incompatible  with  DOS
       <u>PKZIP</u>);  Info-ZIP  uses  the  OEM  code  page on DOS, OS/2 and Win3.x ports but ISO coding (Latin-1 etc.)
       everywhere else; and Nico Mak's <u>WinZip</u> 6.x does not allow 8-bit passwords at all.  <u>UnZip</u> 5.3  (or  newer)
       attempts to use the default character set first (e.g., Latin-1), followed by the alternate one (e.g., OEM
       code  page)  to test passwords.  On EBCDIC systems, if both of these fail, EBCDIC encoding will be tested
       as a last resort.  (EBCDIC is not tested on non-EBCDIC systems, because there are no known archivers that
       encrypt using EBCDIC encoding.)  ISO character encodings other than Latin-1 are not supported.   The  new
       addition  of  (partially)  Unicode  (resp.   UTF-8)  support in <u>UnZip</u> 6.0 has not yet been adapted to the
       encryption password handling in <u>unzip</u>.  On systems that use UTF-8 as  native  character  encoding,  <u>unzip</u>
       simply  tries  decryption  with  the  native  UTF-8  encoded password; the built-in attempts to check the
       password in translated encoding have not yet been adapted for UTF-8 support and will consequently fail.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       To use <u>unzip</u> to  extract  all  members  of  the  archive  <u>letters.zip</u>  into  the  current  directory  and
       subdirectories below it, creating any subdirectories as necessary:

       unzip letters

       To extract all members of <u>letters.zip</u> into the current directory only:

       unzip -j letters

       To test <u>letters.zip</u>, printing only a summary message indicating whether the archive is OK or not:

       unzip -tq letters

       To test <u>all</u> zipfiles in the current directory, printing only the summaries:

       unzip -tq \*.zip

       (The  backslash  before  the asterisk is only required if the shell expands wildcards, as in Unix; double
       quotes could have been used instead, as in the source examples below.)  To extract to standard output all
       members of <u>letters.zip</u> whose names end in <u>.tex</u>, auto-converting to the local end-of-line  convention  and
       piping the output into <u><a href="../man1/more.1.html">more</a></u>(1):

       unzip -ca letters \*.tex | more

       To extract the binary file <u>paper1.dvi</u> to standard output and pipe it to a printing program:

       unzip -p articles paper1.dvi | dvips

       To extract all FORTRAN and C source files--*.f, *.c, *.h, and Makefile--into the <a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a> directory:

       unzip source.zip "*.[fch]" Makefile -d <a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a>

       (the double quotes are necessary only in Unix and only if globbing is turned on).  To extract all FORTRAN
       and  C  source files, regardless of case (e.g., both *.c and *.C, and any makefile, Makefile, MAKEFILE or
       similar):

       unzip -C source.zip "*.[fch]" makefile -d <a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a>

       To extract any such files but convert any uppercase MS-DOS or VMS names  to  lowercase  and  convert  the
       line-endings of all of the files to the local standard (without respect to any files that might be marked
       ``binary''):

       unzip -aaCL source.zip "*.[fch]" makefile -d <a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a>

       To extract only newer versions of the files already in the current directory, without querying (NOTE:  be
       careful  of unzipping in one timezone a zipfile created in another--ZIP archives other than those created
       by Zip 2.1 or later contain no timezone information, and a ``newer'' file from an eastern  timezone  may,
       in fact, be older):

       unzip -fo sources

       To  extract  newer  versions  of  the  files already in the current directory and to create any files not
       already there (same caveat as previous example):

       unzip -uo sources

       To display a diagnostic screen showing  which  <u>unzip</u>  and  <u>zipinfo</u>  options  are  stored  in  environment
       variables, whether decryption support was compiled in, the compiler with which <u>unzip</u> was compiled, etc.:

       unzip -v

       In the last five examples, assume that UNZIP or UNZIP_OPTS is set to -q.  To do a singly quiet listing:

       unzip -l file.zip

       To do a doubly quiet listing:

       unzip -ql file.zip

       (Note that the ``.zip'' is generally not necessary.)  To do a standard listing:

       unzip --ql file.zip
       or
       unzip -l-q file.zip
       or
       unzip -l--q file.zip
       (Extra minuses in options don't hurt.)

</pre><h4><b>TIPS</b></h4><pre>
       The  current  maintainer,  being  a  lazy sort, finds it very useful to define a pair of aliases:  tt for
       ``unzip -tq'' and ii for ``unzip -Z'' (or ``zipinfo'').  One may then simply type ``tt zipfile'' to  test
       an  archive,  something  that  is worth making a habit of doing.  With luck <u>unzip</u> will report ``No errors
       detected in compressed data of zipfile.zip,'' after which one may breathe a sigh of relief.

       The maintainer also finds it useful to set the UNZIP environment variable to ``-aL'' and  is  tempted  to
       add ``-C'' as well.  His ZIPINFO variable is set to ``-z''.

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       The exit status (or error level) approximates the exit codes defined by PKWARE and takes on the following
       values, except under VMS:

              0      normal; no errors or warnings detected.

              1      one  or more warning errors were encountered, but processing completed successfully anyway.
                     This includes zipfiles where one or more files was skipped due to  unsupported  compression
                     method or encryption with an unknown password.

              2      a  generic  error  in  the  zipfile  format  was  detected.   Processing may have completed
                     successfully anyway; some broken zipfiles created by  other  archivers  have  simple  work-
                     arounds.

              3      a severe error in the zipfile format was detected.  Processing probably failed immediately.

              4      <u>unzip</u> was unable to allocate memory for one or more buffers during program initialization.

              5      <u>unzip</u>  was  unable  to  allocate  memory  or  unable to obtain a tty to read the decryption
                     password(s).

              6      <u>unzip</u> was unable to allocate memory during decompression to disk.

              7      <u>unzip</u> was unable to allocate memory during in-memory decompression.

              8      [currently not used]

              9      the specified zipfiles were not found.

              10     invalid options were specified on the command line.

              11     no matching files were found.

              50     the disk is (or was) full during extraction.

              51     the end of the ZIP archive was encountered prematurely.

              80     the user aborted <u>unzip</u> prematurely with control-C (or similar)

              81     testing or extraction of one or more files failed due to unsupported compression methods or
                     unsupported decryption.

              82     no files were found due to bad decryption password(s).  (If even one file  is  successfully
                     processed, however, the exit status is 1.)

       VMS  interprets  standard  Unix  (or PC) return values as other, scarier-looking things, so <u>unzip</u> instead
       maps them into VMS-style status codes.  The current mapping is as follows:   1 (success) for normal exit,
       0x7fff0001 for warning errors, and (0x7fff000? + 16*normal_unzip_exit_status) for all other errors, where
       the `?' is 2 (error) for <u>unzip</u> values 2, 9-11 and 80-82, and 4 (fatal error) for the remaining ones (3-8,
       50, 51).  In addition, there is a compilation option to expand upon this behavior:  defining RETURN_CODES
       results in a human-readable explanation of what the error status means.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Multi-part archives are not  yet  supported,  except  in  conjunction  with  <u>zip</u>.   (All  parts  must  be
       concatenated  together  in  order, and then ``zip -F'' (for <u>zip</u> <u>2.x</u>) or ``zip -FF'' (for <u>zip</u> <u>3.x</u>) must be
       performed on the concatenated archive in order to ``fix'' it.  Also, <u>zip</u> <u>3.0</u> and later can combine multi-
       part (split) archives into a combined single-file archive using ``zip -s- inarchive -O outarchive''.  See
       the <u>zip</u> <u>3</u> manual page for more information.)  This  will  definitely  be  corrected  in  the  next  major
       release.

       Archives  read  from  standard  input  are not yet supported, except with <u>funzip</u> (and then only the first
       member of the archive can be extracted).

       Archives encrypted with 8-bit passwords (e.g., passwords with accented European characters)  may  not  be
       portable across systems and/or other archivers.  See the discussion in <b>DECRYPTION</b> above.

       <u>unzip</u>'s  <b>-M</b>  (``more'')  option tries to take into account automatic wrapping of long lines. However, the
       code may fail to detect the correct wrapping  locations.  First,  TAB  characters  (and  similar  control
       sequences)  are  not  taken  into  account,  they  are handled as ordinary printable characters.  Second,
       depending on the actual system / OS port, <u>unzip</u> may not detect the true screen geometry but  rather  rely
       on  "commonly used" default dimensions.  The correct handling of tabs would require the implementation of
       a query for the actual tabulator setup on the output console.

       Dates, times and permissions of stored directories are not restored except under Unix. (On Windows NT and
       successors, timestamps are now restored.)

       [MS-DOS] When extracting or testing files from an archive on a defective floppy diskette, if the ``Fail''
       option is chosen from DOS's ``Abort, Retry, Fail?'' message, older versions of <u>unzip</u> may hang the system,
       requiring a reboot.  This problem appears to be fixed, but control-C (or control-Break) can still be used
       to terminate <u>unzip</u>.

       Under DEC Ultrix, <u>unzip</u> would sometimes fail on long zipfiles (bad CRC, not always  reproducible).   This
       was  apparently due either to a hardware bug (cache memory) or an operating system bug (improper handling
       of page faults?).  Since Ultrix has been abandoned in favor of Digital Unix (OSF/1), this may not  be  an
       issue anymore.

       [Unix] Unix special files such as FIFO buffers (named pipes), block devices and character devices are not
       restored  even  if  they  are  somehow  represented  in  the zipfile, nor are hard-linked files relinked.
       Basically the only file types restored by <u>unzip</u> are regular files, directories and symbolic (soft) links.

       [OS/2] Extended attributes for existing directories are only updated if the <b>-o</b> (``overwrite all'') option
       is given.  This is a limitation of the operating system; because directories only have  a  creation  time
       associated with them, <u>unzip</u> has no way to determine whether the stored attributes are newer or older than
       those  on  disk.   In  practice  this may mean a two-pass approach is required:  first unpack the archive
       normally (with or without freshening/updating existing files), then overwrite just the directory  entries
       (e.g., ``unzip -o foo */'').

       [VMS]  When  extracting  to  another directory, only the <u>[.foo]</u> syntax is accepted for the <b>-d</b> option; the
       simple Unix <u>foo</u> syntax is silently ignored (as is the less common VMS <u>foo.dir</u> syntax).

       [VMS] When the file being extracted already exists, <u>unzip</u>'s query only allows  skipping,  overwriting  or
       renaming;  there  should  additionally  be a choice for creating a new version of the file.  In fact, the
       ``overwrite'' choice does create a new version; the old version is not overwritten or deleted.
