</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       dtrx - cleanly extract many archive types

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       dtrx [OPTIONS] ARCHIVE [ARCHIVE ...]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       dtrx  extracts  archives  in  a  number  of  different formats; it currently supports tar, zip (including
       self-extracting .exe files), cpio, rpm, deb, gem, 7z, cab, rar, lzh, arj, and  InstallShield  files.   It
       can also decompress files compressed with gzip, bzip2, lzma, xz, lrzip, lzip, or compress.

       In  addition  to providing one command to handle many different archive types, dtrx also aids the user by
       extracting contents consistently.  By default, everything will be written to a dedicated directory that's
       named after the archive.  dtrx will also change the permissions to ensure that the  owner  can  read  and
       write all those files.

       To run dtrx, simply call it with the archive(s) you wish to extract as arguments.  For example:

          $ dtrx coreutils-5.*.tar.gz

       You  may  specify URLs as arguments as well.  If you do, dtrx will use <u>wget</u> <u>-c</u> to download the URL to the
       current directory and then extract what it downloads.  This may fail if you already have a  file  in  the
       current directory with the same name as the file you're trying to download.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       dtrx supports a number of options to mandate specific behavior:

       <b>-r</b>, <b>--recursive</b>
              With  this  option, dtrx will search inside the archives you specify to see if any of the contents
              are themselves archives, and extract those as well.

       <b>--one</b>, <b>--one-entry</b>
              Normally, if an archive only contains one file or directory with a name  that  doesn't  match  the
              archive's,  dtrx  will  ask you how to handle it.  With this option, you can specify ahead of time
              what should happen.  Possible values are:

              <b>inside</b> Extract the file/directory inside another directory named after the archive.  This  is  the
                     default.

              <b>rename</b> Extract  the  file/directory in the current directory, and then rename it to match the name
                     of the archive.

              <b>here</b>   Extract the file/directory in the current directory.

       <b>-o</b>, <b>--overwrite</b>
              Normally, dtrx will avoid extracting into a directory that already exists, and instead try to find
              an alternative name to use.  If this option is listed, dtrx will use the default directory name no
              matter what.

       <b>-f</b>, <b>--flat</b>
              Extract all archive contents into the current directory, instead of their own dedicated directory.
              This is handy if you have multiple archive files which all need to  be  extracted  into  the  same
              directory structure.  Note that existing files may be overwritten with this option.

       <b>-n</b>, <b>--noninteractive</b>
              dtrx  will  normally  ask  the  user  how to handle certain corner cases, such as how to handle an
              archive that only contains one file.  This option suppresses those questions;  dtrx  will  instead
              use sane, conservative defaults.

       <b>-l</b>, <b>-t</b>, <b>--list</b>, <b>--table</b>
              Don't extract the archives; just list their contents on standard output.

       <b>-m</b>, <b>--metadata</b>
              Extract the metadata from .deb and .gem archives, instead of their normal contents.

       <b>-q</b>, <b>--quiet</b>
              Suppress warning messages.  List this option twice to make dtrx silent.

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b>
              Show the files that are being extracted.  List this option twice to print debugging information.

       <b>--help</b> Display basic help.

       <b>--version</b>
              Display dtrx's version, copyright, and license information.
