</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       rar - archive files with compression

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>rar</b> <u>&lt;command&gt;</u> <u>[-&lt;switch</u> <u>1&gt;</u> <u>-&lt;switch</u> <u>N&gt;]</u> <u>archive</u> <u>[files...]</u> <u>[@listfiles...]</u> <u>[path_to_extract]</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This manual page documents briefly the <b>rar</b> archiver.
       This  manual page was written for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution because the original program does not
       have a manual page.
       Commands and options described here are as of <b>rar</b> 7.11.

       <b>rar</b> is a program for creating and manipulating .rar archives.

</pre><h4><b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       After the program name comes a command and then optional switches with dashes before them.
       A summary of commands is included below.  For a complete description, run <b>rar</b> <b>-?</b>

       <b>a</b>      Add files to archive.

       <b>c</b>      Add archive comment. Comment length is limited to 256 KB.

       <b>ch</b>     Change archive parameters.  Can be used with most of archive modification options.

       <b>cw</b>     Write archive comment to a specified file.

       <b>d</b>      Delete files from archive.

       <b>e</b>      Extract files to current directory. Does not create any subdirectories.

       <b>f</b>      Freshen files in archive.  Updates those files changed since they  were  packed  to  the  archive.
              This command will not add new to the archive.

       <b>k</b>      Lock archive.  Any command which intend to change the archive will be ignored.

       <b>l[t[a],b]</b>
              List content of archive [technical[all], bare].
               'lt' displays the detailed file information in multiline mode.  Commands 'lt', 'lta' and 'lb' are
              equal to 'vt', 'vta' and 'vb' correspondingly.

       <b>m[f]</b>   Move  to  archive  [files  only].   Directories will not be removed if 'f' modifier is used and/or
              '-ed' switch is applied.

       <b>p</b>      Print file to stdout.

       <b>r</b>      Repair archive. For further details look in <b>rar.txt</b>.

       <b>rc</b>     Reconstruct missing volumes using recovery volumes (.rev files).  You need to specify any existing
              volume as the archive name, for example, 'rar rc backup.part03.rar'.

       <b>rn</b>     Rename archived files.

       <b>rr[N]</b>  Add data recovery record. Optionally, redundant information (recovery record) may be added  to  an
              archive.

       <b>rv[N]</b>  Create  recovery  volumes  (.rev files), which can be later used to reconstruct missing files in a
              volume set.  This command has sense only for multivolume archives.  For further  details  look  in
              <b>rar.txt</b>.

       <b>s[name|-]</b>
              Convert  archive  to  or  from  SFX.  The  archive  is  merged  with SFX-module in the user's home
              directory.

       <b>t</b>      Test archive files.

       <b>u</b>      Update files in archive. Adds files not already in the archive and  updates  files  changed  since
              they were packed to the archive.

       <b>v[t[a],b]</b>
              Verbosely list archive [technical]

       <b>x</b>      Extract files with full path.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>NOTE:</b> Every switch must be separated by a whitespace.  They cannot be put together.

       <b>-?</b>     Display  help on commands and switches. The same as when none or an illegal command line option is
              entered.

       <b>--</b>     This switch tells to RAR that there is no more switches in the command line. It could  be  useful,
              if  either  archive or file name starts from '-' character. Without '--' switch such name would be
              treated as switch.

       <b>-@[+]</b>  Disable [enable] file lists.

       <b>-ad[1,2]</b>
              Alternate destination path.

       <b>-ag[format]</b>
              Generate archive name using the current date and time.  Appends the  current  date  string  to  an
              archive  name  when  creating  an  archive. Useful for daily backups.  For further details look in
              <b>rar.txt</b>.

       <b>-ai</b>    Ignore file attributes.

       <b>-am[s,r]</b>
              Archive name and time [save, restore]

       <b>-ap&lt;path&gt;</b>
              Set path inside archive. This path is merged to file names when adding files  to  an  archive  and
              removed from file names when extracting.

       <b>-as</b>    Synchronize archive contents.
              If  this  switch is used when archiving, those archived files which are not present in the list of
              the currently added files, will be deleted from archive. It is convenient to use  this  switch  in
              combination with -u (update) to synchronize contents of an archive and an archiving directory.

       <b>-cfg-</b>  Disable reading configuration and environment.

       <b>-cl</b>    Convert file names to lower case.

       <b>-cu</b>    Convert file names to upper case.

       <b>-c-</b>    Disable showing comments.

       <b>-df</b>    Delete  files  after  archiving. This switch in combination with the command "a" performs the same
              action as the command "m".

       <b>-dh</b>    Open shared files.  Allows one to process files opened by other applications for writing.

       <b>-ds</b>    Do not sort files while adding to a solid archive.

       <b>-dw</b>    Wipe files after archiving.

       <b>-ed</b>    Do not add empty directories.

       <b>-ep</b>    Exclude paths from names.

       <b>-ep1</b>   Exclude base dir from names.

       <b>-ep2</b>   Expand paths to full. Store full file paths (except a drive letter  and  leading  path  separator)
              when archiving.

       <b>-ep4&lt;path&gt;</b>
              Exclude the path prefix from names.

       <b>-e[+]&lt;attr&gt;</b>
              Set file exclude [or include] attributes.

       <b>-f</b>     Freshen files. May be used with archive extraction or creation.

       <b>-hp[password]</b>
              Encrypt  both  file data and headers.  The password is case-sensitive. If you omit the password on
              the command line, you will be prompted with message "Enter password".

       <b>-ht[b|c]</b>
              Select hash type [BLAKE2,CRC32] for file checksum.

       <b>-id[c,d,n,p,q]</b>
              Display or disable messages.

       <b>-ierr</b>  Send all messages to stderr.

              Control notification sounds.

       <b>-iver</b>  Display the version number

       <b>-k</b>     Lock archive.
              Any command which intends to change the archive will be ignored.

       <b>-kb</b>    Keep broken extracted files.

       <b>-log[f][=name]</b>
              Write names to log file.

       <b>-m&lt;0..5&gt;</b>
              Set compression level (0-store...3-default...5-best). By  default  <b>rar</b>  uses  -m3  method  (Normal
              compression).

       <b>-mc&lt;par&gt;</b>
              Set advanced compression parameters.  For further details look in <b>rar.txt</b>.

       <b>-md&lt;size&gt;[k,m,g]</b>

              selects the optimal number of threads automatically.

       <b>-n&lt;file&gt;</b>
              Additionally filter included files.

       <b>-n@</b>    Read additional filter masks from stdin.

       <b>-n@&lt;list&gt;</b>

       <b>-r</b>     Recurse subdirectories.

       <b>-r-</b>    Disable recursion.

       <b>-r0</b>    Similar to -r, but when used with the commands 'a', 'u', 'f', 'm' will recurse subdirectories only
              for wildcard names.

       <b>-rr[N]</b> Add data recovery record.

       <b>-rv[N]</b> Create recovery volumes.  <b>-s</b> Create solid archive.

       <b>-ta[mcao]&lt;d&gt;</b>
              Process files modified after &lt;d&gt; YYYYMMDDHHMMSS date.
