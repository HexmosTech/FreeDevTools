</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       nulib2 - package and compress (archive) files

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>nulib2</b> -command[modifiers] <u>archive</u> <u>[</u> <u>filenames</u> <u>]</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>nulib2</u> is a disk and file archiver for NuFX (ShrinkIt) files.  It can add files to and extract files from
       <u>.SHK</u>,  <u>.BXY</u>,  <u>.SEA</u>  (as  created by GS/ShrinkIt), and <u>.BSE</u> files.  In addition, it can extract files from
       <u>.BNY</u> and <u>.BQY</u> Binary II archives.

       When extracting, testing, or listing the contents of an archive, you can  specify  "-"  for  the  archive
       name.   The  archive  will  be  read from stdin.  (If the archive is Binary II, you must specify the "-b"
       flag.)

       Filenames are considered case-sensitive.

       This man page contains a summary of available options.  For full documentation and the  latest  versions,
       visit <a href="http://www.nulib.com/">http://www.nulib.com/</a>.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-h</b>     Get verbose help output.

       <b>-a</b>     Add  files  to an archive.  If the archive does not exist, a new one will be created.  The list of
              files to add must be given.

       <b>-d</b>     Delete files from an archive.  The set of files to delete must be provided.

       <b>-i</b>     Integrity test.  If no files are listed, all files in the archive are tested.

       <b>-p</b>     Pipe extraction.  All extracted files are written to stdout instead of a  file  on  disk.   Normal
              archive progress messages are suppressed.

       <b>-t</b>     Table of contents.  Provides a simple list of files in the archive, one per line.

       <b>-v</b>     Verbose table of contents.  Output similar to what ShrinkIt displays is shown.

       <b>-x</b>     Extract files from an archive.  If no files are listed, all files in the archive are extracted.

</pre><h4><b>MODIFIERS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-c</b>     Comments.   When  extracting,  comments  will  be displayed.  When adding, you will be prompted to
              enter a one-line comment for every file.

       <b>-e</b>     Preserve  ProDOS  file   types.    See   the   ProDOS   File   Type   Preservation   document   on
              <a href="http://www.nulib.com/">http://www.nulib.com/</a> for details on how this works.

       <b>-ee</b>    Preserve  file  types,  using  extended  names.   A file extension is appended to extracted files.
              Useful on operating systems like Windows, where filename extensions are  important.   When  adding
              files, <u>nulib2</u> will try to guess at correct file types by examining the filename extension.

       <b>-f</b>     Freshen  files.   When  adding,  files  in  the  archive  that  are  older  than files on disk are
              "freshened", meaning that no new files are added, and files that are the same age or newer  aren't
              touched.  Works similarly when extracting.

       <b>-j</b>     Junk  directory names.  Only the filename is kept; the rest of the pathname is thrown away.  Empty
              directories aren't stored.  Works when adding or extracting.

       <b>-k</b>     Store files as disk images.  Files that are a multiple of 512 bytes will be added as  disk  images
              rather than normal files.  This does not override the "-e" flag.

       <b>-l</b>     Auto-convert  text  files.   A reasonably smart algorithm is used to identify which files are text
              and which aren't during extraction.  It then converts whatever EOL indicator is being used by  the
              text file into something appropriate for the current system.

       <b>-ll</b>    Auto-convert  all  files.   All  files being extracted are considered text, and will be converted.
              Don't use this unless you're sure you need it.

       <b>-r</b>     Recurse into subdirectories.  When adding, this causes <u>nulib2</u> to descend into  subdirectories  and
              store all of the files found.  When extracting, testing, or deleting, this causes the files listed
              to match against all records whose prefix matches, allowing you to extract, test, or delete entire
              subdirectories from the archive.

       <b>-u</b>     Update  files.   When  adding, files in the archive that are older than files on disk are updated.
              Files in the archive that are the same age or newer aren't touched.   New  files  will  be  added.
              Works similarly when extracting.

       <b>-b</b>     Binary  II.   Forces  NuLib2  to  treat  the archive as Binary II.  Useful for opening NuFX-in-BNY
              archives (.BXY) if you want to strip the wrapper  off.   You  must  specify  this  for  Binary  II
              archives on stdin.

       <b>-0</b>     Don't  use  compression.  Files added will be stored without compression.  (Note that's dash-zero,
              not dash-oh.)

       <b>-z</b>     Use "deflate" compression.  This option is only available if libz was  linked  against.   Archives
              created with this algorithm will not be usable on an Apple II.

       <b>-zz</b>    Use  "bzip2"  compression.   This option is only available if libbz2 was linked against.  Archives
              created with this algorithm will not be usable on an Apple II.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       A simple example:

              nulib2 a foo.shk *

       creates the archive <u>foo.shk</u> (assuming it doesn't exist) and stores  all  of  the  files  in  the  current
       directory in it, in compressed form.

       If  you wanted to add all the files in the current directory, as well as all files in all subdirectories,
       you could use:

              nulib2 ar foo.shk *

       to recursively descend into the directory tree.

       Using the command:

              nulib2 xe foo.shk

       would extract all files from <u>foo.shk,</u> preserving ProDOS file types.  If you then used the command:

              nulib2 aer foo.shk *

       you would add the files, preserving the file types of anything that was extracted with the "-e" flag set.

       A handy way to look at text documents is to use:

              nulib2 xeel foo.shk

       to convert end-of-line terminators (e.g. CRLF to LF) as the files are being extracted.   The  "-ee"  flag
       adds ".TXT" to all files with a ProDOS file type of TXT ($04).
