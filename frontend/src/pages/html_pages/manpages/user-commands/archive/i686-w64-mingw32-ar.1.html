       ar - create, modify, and extract from archives

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       ar [<b>-X32_64</b>] [<b>-</b>]<u>p</u>[<u>mod</u>] [<b>--plugin</b> <u>name</u>] [<b>--target</b> <u>bfdname</u>] [<b>--output</b> <u>dirname</u>] [<b>--record-libdeps</b> <u>libdeps</u>]
       [<b>--thin</b>] [<u>relpos</u>] [<u>count</u>] <u>archive</u> [<u>member</u>...]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The GNU <b>ar</b> program creates, modifies, and extracts from archives.  An <u>archive</u> is a single file holding a
       collection of other files in a structure that makes it possible to retrieve the original individual files
       (called <u>members</u> of the archive).

       The original files' contents, mode (permissions), timestamp, owner, and group are preserved in the
       archive, and can be restored on extraction.

       GNU <b>ar</b> can maintain archives whose members have names of any length; however, depending on how <b>ar</b> is
       configured on your system, a limit on member-name length may be imposed for compatibility with archive
       formats maintained with other tools.  If it exists, the limit is often 15 characters (typical of formats
       related to a.out) or 16 characters (typical of formats related to coff).

       <b>ar</b> is considered a binary utility because archives of this sort are most often used as <u>libraries</u> holding
       commonly needed subroutines.  Since libraries often will depend on other libraries, <b>ar</b> can also record
       the dependencies of a library when the <b>--record-libdeps</b> option is specified.

       <b>ar</b> creates an index to the symbols defined in relocatable object modules in the archive when you specify
       the modifier <b>s</b>.  Once created, this index is updated in the archive whenever <b>ar</b> makes a change to its
       contents (save for the <b>q</b> update operation).  An archive with such an index speeds up linking to the
       library, and allows routines in the library to call each other without regard to their placement in the
       archive.

       You may use <b>nm</b> <b>-s</b> or <b>nm</b> <b>--print-armap</b> to list this index table.  If an archive lacks the table, another
       form of <b>ar</b> called <b>ranlib</b> can be used to add just the table.

       GNU <b>ar</b> can optionally create a <u>thin</u> archive, which contains a symbol index and references to the original
       copies of the member files of the archive.  This is useful for building libraries for use within a local
       build tree, where the relocatable objects are expected to remain available, and copying the contents of
       each object would only waste time and space.

       An archive can either be <u>thin</u> or it can be normal.  It cannot be both at the same time.  Once an archive
       is created its format cannot be changed without first deleting it and then creating a new archive in its
       place.

       Thin archives are also <u>flattened</u>, so that adding one thin archive to another thin archive does not nest
       it, as would happen with a normal archive.  Instead the elements of the first archive are added
       individually to the second archive.

       The paths to the elements of the archive are stored relative to the archive itself.

       GNU <b>ar</b> is designed to be compatible with two different facilities.  You can control its activity using
       command-line options, like the different varieties of <b>ar</b> on Unix systems; or, if you specify the single
       command-line option <b>-M</b>, you can control it with a script supplied via standard input, like the MRI
       "librarian" program.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       GNU <b>ar</b> allows you to mix the operation code <u>p</u> and modifier flags <u>mod</u> in any order, within the first
       command-line argument.

       If you wish, you may begin the first command-line argument with a dash.

       The <u>p</u> keyletter specifies what operation to execute; it may be any of the following, but you must specify
       only one of them:

       <b>d</b>   <u>Delete</u>  modules  from  the  archive.   Specify  the  names of modules to be deleted as <u>member</u>...; the
           archive is untouched if you specify no files to delete.

           If you specify the <b>v</b> modifier, <b>ar</b> lists each module as it is deleted.

       <b>m</b>   Use this operation to <u>move</u> members in an archive.

           The ordering of members in an archive can make a difference in how  programs  are  linked  using  the
           library, if a symbol is defined in more than one member.

           If  no modifiers are used with "m", any members you name in the <u>member</u> arguments are moved to the <u>end</u>
           of the archive; you can use the <b>a</b>, <b>b</b>, or <b>i</b> modifiers to move them to a specified place instead.

       <b>p</b>   <u>Print</u> the specified members of the archive, to the standard  output  file.   If  the  <b>v</b>  modifier  is
           specified, show the member name before copying its contents to standard output.

           If you specify no <u>member</u> arguments, all the files in the archive are printed.

       <b>q</b>   <u>Quick</u>  <u>append</u>;  Historically,  add  the  files  <u>member</u>... to the end of <u>archive</u>, without checking for
           replacement.

           The modifiers <b>a</b>, <b>b</b>, and <b>i</b> do <u>not</u> affect this operation; new members are always placed at the  end  of
           the archive.

           The modifier <b>v</b> makes <b>ar</b> list each file as it is appended.

           Since the point of this operation is speed, implementations of <b>ar</b> have the option of not updating the
           archive's  symbol  table if one exists.  Too many different systems however assume that symbol tables
           are always up-to-date, so GNU <b>ar</b> will rebuild the table even with a quick append.

           Note - GNU <b>ar</b> treats the command <b>qs</b> as a synonym for <b>r</b> - replacing  already  existing  files  in  the
           archive and appending new ones at the end.

       <b>r</b>   Insert the files <u>member</u>... into <u>archive</u> (with <u>replacement</u>). This operation differs from <b>q</b> in that any
           previously existing members are deleted if their names match those being added.

           If  one  of  the  files  named  in <u>member</u>... does not exist, <b>ar</b> displays an error message, and leaves
           undisturbed any existing members of the archive matching that name.

           By default, new members are added at the end of the file; but you may use one of the modifiers <b>a</b>,  <b>b</b>,
           or <b>i</b> to request placement relative to some existing member.

           The  modifier  <b>v</b> used with this operation elicits a line of output for each file inserted, along with
           one of the letters <b>a</b> or <b>r</b> to indicate whether the file  was  appended  (no  old  member  deleted)  or
           replaced.

       <b>s</b>   Add an index to the archive, or update it if it already exists.  Note this command is an exception to
           the  rule  that there can only be one command letter, as it is possible to use it as either a command
           or a modifier.  In either case it does the same thing.

       <b>t</b>   Display a <u>table</u> listing the contents of <u>archive</u>, or those of the files listed in <u>member</u>...  that  are
           present  in the archive.  Normally only the member name is shown, but if the modifier <b>O</b> is specified,
           then the corresponding offset of the member is also displayed.  Finally, in order to  see  the  modes
           (permissions), timestamp, owner, group, and size the <b>v</b> modifier should be included.

           If you do not specify a <u>member</u>, all files in the archive are listed.

           If  there  is  more than one file with the same name (say, <b>fie</b>) in an archive (say <b>b.a</b>), <b>ar</b> <b>t</b> <b>b.a</b> <b>fie</b>
           lists only the first instance; to see them all, you must ask for a complete listing---in our example,
           <b>ar</b> <b>t</b> <b>b.a</b>.

       <b>x</b>   <u>Extract</u> members (named <u>member</u>) from the archive.  You can use the <b>v</b> modifier with this operation,  to
           request that <b>ar</b> list each name as it extracts it.

           If you do not specify a <u>member</u>, all files in the archive are extracted.

           Files cannot be extracted from a thin archive, and there are restrictions on extracting from archives
           created  with  <b>P</b>: The paths must not be absolute, may not contain "..", and any subdirectories in the
           paths must exist.  If it is desired to avoid these restrictions then  used  the  <b>--output</b>  option  to
           specify an output directory.

       A  number  of  modifiers  (<u>mod</u>)  may  immediately  follow  the  <u>p</u>  keyletter, to specify variations on an
       operation's behavior:

       <b>a</b>   Add new files <u>after</u> an existing member of the archive.  If you use the modifier <b>a</b>,  the  name  of  an
           existing archive member must be present as the <u>relpos</u> argument, before the <u>archive</u> specification.

       <b>b</b>   Add  new  files  <u>before</u> an existing member of the archive.  If you use the modifier <b>b</b>, the name of an
           existing archive member must be present as the <u>relpos</u> argument,  before  the  <u>archive</u>  specification.
           (same as <b>i</b>).

       <b>c</b>   <u>Create</u> the archive.  The specified <u>archive</u> is always created if it did not exist, when you request an
           update.  But a warning is issued unless you specify in advance that you expect to create it, by using
           this modifier.

       <b>D</b>   Operate  in  <u>deterministic</u>  mode.   When  adding files and the archive index use zero for UIDs, GIDs,
           timestamps, and use consistent file modes for all files.  When this option is used,  if  <b>ar</b>  is  used
           with  identical  options  and identical input files, multiple runs will create identical output files
           regardless of the input files' owners, groups, file modes, or modification times.

           If <u>binutils</u> was configured with <b>--enable-deterministic-archives</b>, then this mode is on by default.  It
           can be disabled with the <b>U</b> modifier, below.

       <b>f</b>   Truncate names in the archive.  GNU <b>ar</b> will normally permit file names  of  any  length.   This  will
           cause  it to create archives which are not compatible with the native <b>ar</b> program on some systems.  If
           this is a concern, the <b>f</b> modifier may be used to  truncate  file  names  when  putting  them  in  the
           archive.

       <b>i</b>   Insert new files <u>before</u> an existing member of the archive.  If you use the modifier <b>i</b>, the name of an
           existing  archive  member  must  be present as the <u>relpos</u> argument, before the <u>archive</u> specification.
           (same as <b>b</b>).

       <b>l</b>   Specify dependencies  of  this  library.   The  dependencies  must  immediately  follow  this  option
           character, must use the same syntax as the linker command line, and must be specified within a single
           argument.   I.e.,  if  multiple  items  are needed, they must be quoted to form a single command line
           argument.  For example <b>l</b> <b>"-L/usr/local/lib</b> <b>-lmydep1</b> <b>-lmydep2"</b>

       <b>N</b>   Uses the <u>count</u> parameter.  This is used if there are multiple entries in the archive  with  the  same
           name.  Extract or delete instance <u>count</u> of the given name from the archive.

       <b>o</b>   Preserve  the  <u>original</u>  dates of members when extracting them.  If you do not specify this modifier,
           files extracted from the archive are stamped with the time of extraction.

       <b>O</b>   Display member offsets inside the archive. Use together with the <b>t</b> option.

       <b>P</b>   Use the full path name when matching or storing names in the archive.   Archives  created  with  full
           path names are not POSIX compliant, and thus may not work with tools other than up to date GNU tools.
           Modifying  such  archives  with  GNU  <b>ar</b>  without  using <b>P</b> will remove the full path names unless the
           archive is a thin archive.  Note that <b>P</b> may be useful when adding files to a  thin  archive  since  <b>r</b>
           without <b>P</b> ignores the path when choosing which element to replace.  Thus

                   ar rcST archive.a subdir/file1 subdir/file2 file1

           will  result  in  the  first  "subdir/file1"  being replaced with "file1" from the current directory.
           Adding <b>P</b> will prevent this replacement.

       <b>s</b>   Write an object-file index into the archive, or update an existing one, even if no  other  change  is
           made to the archive.  You may use this modifier flag either with any operation, or alone.  Running <b>ar</b>
           <b>s</b> on an archive is equivalent to running <b>ranlib</b> on it.

       <b>S</b>   Do  not  generate  an  archive  symbol  table.  This can speed up building a large library in several
           steps.  The resulting archive can not be used with the linker.  In order to build a symbol table, you
           must omit the <b>S</b> modifier on the last execution of <b>ar</b>, or you must run <b>ranlib</b> on the archive.

       <b>T</b>   Deprecated alias for <b>--thin</b>.  <b>T</b> is not recommended  because  in  many  ar  implementations  <b>T</b>  has  a
           different meaning, as specified by X/Open System Interface.

       <b>u</b>   Normally,  <b>ar</b> <b>r</b>... inserts all files listed into the archive.  If you would like to insert <u>only</u> those
           of the files you list that are newer than existing members of the same names, use this modifier.  The
           <b>u</b> modifier is allowed only for the operation <b>r</b> (replace).  In particular, the combination <b>qu</b>  is  not
           allowed, since checking the timestamps would lose any speed advantage from the operation <b>q</b>.

           Note  -  if  an archive has been created in a deterministic manner, eg via the use of the <b>D</b> modifier,
           then replacement will always happen and the <b>u</b> modifier will be ineffective.

       <b>U</b>   Do <u>not</u> operate in <u>deterministic</u> mode.  This is the inverse of the <b>D</b> modifier, above: added files  and
           the archive index will get their actual UID, GID, timestamp, and file mode values.

           This is the default unless <u>binutils</u> was configured with <b>--enable-deterministic-archives</b>.

       <b>v</b>   This  modifier  requests  the  <u>verbose</u>  version  of an operation.  Many operations display additional
           information, such as filenames processed, when the modifier <b>v</b> is appended.

       <b>V</b>   This modifier shows the version number of <b>ar</b>.

       The <b>ar</b> program also supports some command-line options which are neither modifiers nor actions, but which
       do change its behaviour in specific ways:

       <b>--help</b>
           Displays the list of command-line options supported by <b>ar</b> and then exits.

       <b>--version</b>
           Displays the version information of <b>ar</b> and then exits.

       <b>-X32_64</b>
           <b>ar</b> ignores an initial option spelled <b>-X32_64</b>, for compatibility with AIX.  The behaviour produced  by
           this  option  is  the  default  for  GNU  <b>ar</b>.   <b>ar</b>  does  not support any of the other <b>-X</b> options; in
           particular, it does not support <b>-X32</b> which is the default for AIX <b>ar</b>.

       <b>--plugin</b> <u>name</u>
           The optional command-line switch <b>--plugin</b> <u>name</u> causes <b>ar</b> to load the plugin called  <u>name</u>  which  adds
           support for more file formats, including object files with link-time optimization information.

           This option is only available if the toolchain has been built with plugin support enabled.

           If  <b>--plugin</b>  is not provided, but plugin support has been enabled then <b>ar</b> iterates over the files in
           <u>${libdir}/bfd-plugins</u> in alphabetic order and the first plugin that claims the object in question  is
           used.

           Please  note  that this plugin search directory is <u>not</u> the one used by <b>ld</b>'s <b>-plugin</b> option.  In order
           to make <b>ar</b> use the  linker plugin it must be copied into the  <u>${libdir}/bfd-plugins</u>  directory.   For
           GCC  based  compilations  the  linker  plugin  is  called  <u>liblto_plugin.so.0.0.0</u>.   For  Clang based
           compilations it is called <u>LLVMgold.so</u>.  The GCC plugin is always backwards  compatible  with  earlier
           versions, so it is sufficient to just copy the newest one.

       <b>--target</b> <u>target</u>
           The optional command-line switch <b>--target</b> <u>bfdname</u> specifies that the archive members are in an object
           code format different from your system's default format.  See

       <b>--output</b> <u>dirname</u>
           The <b>--output</b> option can be used to specify a path to a directory into which archive members should be
           extracted.  If this option is not specified then the current directory will be used.

           Note  -  although  the  presence  of this option does imply a <b>x</b> extraction operation that option must
           still be included on the command line.

       <b>--record-libdeps</b> <u>libdeps</u>
           The <b>--record-libdeps</b> option is identical to the <b>l</b> modifier, just handled in long form.

       <b>--thin</b>
           Make the specified <u>archive</u> a <u>thin</u> archive.  If it already  exists  and  is  a  regular  archive,  the
           existing members must be present in the same directory as <u>archive</u>.

       <b>@</b><u>file</u>
           Read  command-line  options  from <u>file</u>.  The options read are inserted in place of the original @<u>file</u>
           option.  If <u>file</u> does not exist, or cannot be read, then the option will be  treated  literally,  and
           not removed.

           Options  in <u>file</u> are separated by whitespace.  A whitespace character may be included in an option by
           surrounding the entire option in  either  single  or  double  quotes.   Any  character  (including  a
           backslash)  may be included by prefixing the character to be included with a backslash.  The <u>file</u> may
           itself contain additional @<u>file</u> options; any such options will be processed recursively.
