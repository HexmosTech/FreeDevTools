</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       marc - archive merger

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>marc</b> <u>tgtarc</u> <u>srcarc</u> [ <u>files</u> ... ]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Reads <u>files</u> from the arc archive <u>srcarc</u> and add them to the arc archive <u>tgtarc</u>.

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Arc</u>  has  been  in use in the CP/M and MSDOS world for many years.  Thom Henderson developed the original
       version, but it is important to note that <u>arc</u> is based on the  file  compression  theories  developed  by
       Huffman,  Welch, Knott, Knuth, and many other scientists. This implementation is based on version 5.21 of
       the MSDOS program.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Arc</u> behaves just like the PC version of the program; all functions of the "usage"  display  are  working.
       Full  compatibility  with  PC  ARC files is maintained, the price for which is that <u>arc</u> doesn't like long
       filenames, and can only archive files with names of up to 12 characters.   It  will  *sometimes*  do  The
       Right Thing with them, but I suggest you put long-winded filenames in a "shar" before <u>arc</u>ing them.

       There shouldn't be any problems, (hah!) but if you find any, please send them to me at:
