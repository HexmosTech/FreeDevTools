</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       dar_split - dar helper to split an archive over several tapes

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       dar_split [-b &lt;bytes&gt;] [-r &lt;rate&gt;] { [-c &lt;count&gt;] split_input | [-s] split_output } &lt;filename&gt;

       dar_split -V

       dar_split -h

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>dar_split</b> is to be used with dar to read or write a large archive from or to several tapes.

</pre><h4><b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>dar_split</b> has two modes of operation: split_input and split_output

       split_input         in this mode, dar_split copies &lt;filename&gt; to its standard output. &lt;filename&gt; may be a
                           special  device  like  /dev/tape  or  any  other inode that has the ability to access
                           removable volumes. When dar_split reaches the end of &lt;filename&gt; it suspends and waits
                           for the user to press the return key in order to continue. In the meanwhile the  user
                           can rewind and change the tape. When dar_split is awaken again, it reopens &lt;filename&gt;
                           and  sends  its  content to its standard output as if it was the continuation of what
                           was read so far before reaching the end of file.

       split_output        in this mode dar_split copies its standard input to &lt;filename&gt;. However if &lt;filename&gt;
                           is full, dar_split suspends and waits for the user to press the return key  in  order
                           to  continue.  In  the  meanwhile,  the  user  can  rewind  and change the tape. When
                           dar_split is awaken again, it reopens &lt;filename&gt; and continues to copy to  &lt;filename&gt;
                           what  was  not  yet  written  previously. Pay attention to the fact that if you don't
                           change the destination media, the continuation  of  data  copy  may  erase  what  was
                           written so far depending on the type of media.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       -s                  this option is only available in split_output mode an leads dar_split to perform sync
                           writes  in  place  of  normal  writes.  This  has  the drawback to drastically reduce
                           performances but may be necessary under certain  circumstances  where  the  operating
                           system  cache  reports  a  write  operation  as successful while the cache underlying
                           medium is already full.

       -b &lt;bytes&gt;          this option makes read and write system call not exceeding the given amount of  bytes
                           instead  of  by  default using the maximum amount the system permits. This may reduce
                           performances as it will require dar_split to make more system  call  to  achieve  the
                           same  operation,  but  can  cope  this way with some devices that accept only limited
                           buffer size per system call.

       -r &lt;rate&gt;           this option limits the transfer rate to the given value in bytes per second.

       -c &lt;count&gt;          this option limit the number of tape dar_split will read data from. If  you  know  by
                           advance this number, this avoid you having to stop by hand dar_split once the archive
                           has  been fully read. It will stop once the end of file of the &lt;count&gt; last file will
                           be reached. This option is of course only available in split_input mode.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b> <b>OF</b> <b>USE</b></h4><pre>
       creating an archive over several tapes

              dar -c - ...possibily other dar options... | dar_split split_output /dev/tape

       Here dar generates the archive to its standard output which is read by dar_split and copied to /dev/tape.
       When the tape reaches its send, dar_split asks for the user to hit return to continue.

       reading an archive splitted over several tapes

              dar_split split_input /dev/tape | dar -t - --sequential-read ...possibily other dar options...

       Here dar_split reads /dev/tape and sends its content to dar which *must* be  used  in  --senquential-read
       mode  in  order  to  read an archive from its standard input without the help of dar_slave. When the tape
       reaches its end, dar_split asks for the user to hit return to continue.

       Note that dar_split can also be used with tar for the same purpose as with dar:

              tar -cz ... | dar_split split_output /dev/tape

       without -f option nor TAPE environment variable, tar sends the tar archive to stdout, which  get  fet  to
       dar_split for slicing

              dar_split split_input /dev/tape | tar -tz

       without  -f  option nor TAPE environement variable, tar read the tar archive from stdin, however you must
       specify the correct option corresponding to the compression used at archive creation time.

       The advantage here is to be able to save a huge dar or tar archive on several tapes that could be  either
       partially  filled or having different sizes, without having to calculate in advance the size of slices to
       specify. The drawback is that this implies sequential reading for dar (for tar also, but  tar  cannot  do
       else).

</pre><h4><b>With</b> <b>or</b> <b>without</b> <b>filesystem</b></h4><pre>
       You  can  use  dar_split  with  floppies,  zip/jazz  disks  or usb key too, but it has many disadvantages
       compared to the normal way of using this media: doing that way avoids you relying on a  filesystem,  thus
       you  cannot  have  direct  access to file contents, which dar knows how to take advantage of, and you are
       instead stuck with sequential read access which is long as it requires reading the  whole  archive  (same
       way as tar does).

       When  instead  using  dar  alone  in  normal mode (non sequential reading mode using filenames instead of
       standard input/output), you have the opportunity to create redundancy data beside dar  slices  thanks  to
       par2,  which  is not possible without a filesystem. At restoration time, thanks to dar archive's catalog,
       dar can directly seek to the  file's  data  you  want  to  restore,  which  is  very  quick  compared  to
       reading/unciphering/uncompressing the whole archive...

       Note  that copying tape contents generated by dar_split to different files which name would correspond to
       dar slices, does not make a valid multi-sliced archive because the slice  header  is  missing  in  slices
       (except in the first). You can however concatenate all the pieces of data generated by dar_split and have
       a valid single sliced dar archive that you can use in direct access mode. However attention must be paied
       not  to  add any extra data after data generated by dar through dar_split (in particular if the last tape
       was not full), in that case you can only read the archive with --sequential-read mode.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>CODES</b></h4><pre>

       2         could not open source or destination files

</pre><h4><b>SIGNALS</b></h4><pre>
