       dar_xform - disk archive "re-slicer"

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       dar_xform [options] [&lt;path&gt;/]source [&lt;path&gt;/]destination

       dar_xform -h

       dar_xform -V

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>dar_xform</b> changes the size of slices of an existing archive.

       Source is the basename of the existing archive, destination is the basename of the archive to be created.
       If  source  basename is "-", the archive is read from standard input. If the destination basename is "-",
       the archive is written to standard output and -s option is not available.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       -h                  displays help usage.

       -V                  displays version information.

       -b                  make the terminal ring when user  interaction  is  required  (like  for  example  the
                           creation of a new slice when using the -p option)

       -s &lt;number&gt;         Size  of the slices in bytes. If the number is followed by k (or K), M, G, T or P the
                           size is in kilobytes, megabytes,  gigabytes,  terabytes  or  petabytes  respectively.
                           Example:  by  default  "20M"  means 20 megabytes it is the same as giving 20971520 as
                           argument (see also -aSI and -abinary options). If -s is not present the  backup  will
                           be  written  to  a  single  slice  whatever  the  size of the backup may be (there is
                           probably some filesystem limitation, thus you might expect problems  with  file  size
                           over 2 gigabytes, depending on your filesystem).

       -S &lt;number&gt;         -S gives the size of the first slice which may be chosen independently of the size of
                           following slices. This option needs -s and by default, the size of the first slice is
                           the same as the one of the following slices.

       -p [&lt;integer&gt;]      pauses  before  writing  to  a  new  slice (this requires -s). By default there is no
                           pause, all slices are output in the same directory, up to the end of  the  backup  or
                           until the filesystem is full. In this later case, the user is informed of the lack of
                           disk  space  and  dar  stops  for  user  interaction.  As  soon as some disk space is
                           available, the user can continue the backup. The optional integer  that  this  option
                           can  receive  tells  dar to only pause very 'n' slice. Giving 3 for 'n' will make dar
                           pause only after slices 3, 6, 9 and so on. If this  integer  is  not  specified,  the
                           behavior is as if '1' was given as argument which makes dar pause after each slice.

       -n                  Do not allow overwriting of any slice.

       -w                  Do  not  warn  before  overwriting slice. By default (no -n and no -w) overwriting is
                           allowed but a warning is issued before proceeding.

       -E &lt;string&gt;         the string is a command-line to be launched between the  slices  of  the  destination
                           archive. See <a href="../man1/dar.1.html">dar</a>(1) man page (same option) for more information.

       -F &lt;string&gt;         the string is a command-line to be launched between the slices of the source archive.
                           See <a href="../man1/dar.1.html">dar</a>(1) man page (same option) for more information.

       -aSI[-unit[s]]      when  using  k M G T E Z Y prefixes to define a size, use the SI meaning: multiple of
                           10^3 (a Mega is 1,000,000).

       -abinary[-unit[s]]  when using k M G T E Z Y prefixes to define  a  size,  use  the  historical  computer
                           science meaning: multiple of 2^10  (a Mega is 1,048,576).

       -aSI and -abinary can be used several times, they affect all prefix which follow even those found in file
       included  by  -B  option up to the next -a... occurrence. Note that if in a file included by -B option an
       -abinary or -aSI is met, it affects all the following prefix even those outside the included  files  (for
       example in the following "-B some.dcf -s 1K" 1K may be equal to 1000 or 1024 depending on the presence of
       an  -aSI or -abinary in the file some.dcf. By default (before any -aSI/binary argument has been reached),
       binary interpretation of suffix is done (for compatibility with older versions).

       -Q                  Do not display any message on stderr when not launched from a terminal  (for  example
                           when  launched from an at job or crontab). Remains that any question to the user will
                           be assumed a 'no' answer, which most of the time will abort the program.

       -^ perm[:user[:group]]
                           defines the permission and ownership to use for created slices.

       -3  &lt;algo&gt;          Beside each created slice is generated  an  on-fly  hash  file  using  the  specified
                           algorithm.  Available  algorithm  are  "md5"  and  "sha1", by default no hash file is
                           generated. This option description is more detailed in dar man page (where it has the
                           same designation as here).

       -9 &lt;src_num&gt;[,&lt;dst_num&gt;]
                           Defines the minimum number of digit to use for the source archive and eventually  for
                           the  destination archive. If the source has not been defined with a minimum number of
                           digits and you want to specify a number of digits for the  destination  archive,  use
                           zero (or one) as value for src_num. If dst_num is not provided, it defaults to 1. See
                           the same option in dar man page for more details.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       Dar_xform is not concerned by encryption or compression. It does not need to be aware of it to be able to
       change the slice scheme. Thus, it is not able to uncompress or uncipher an archive.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>CODES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>dar_xform</b> uses the same exit status as dar does, see <a href="../man1/dar.1.html">dar</a>(1) man page.

</pre><h4><b>SIGNALS</b></h4><pre>
       Any  signal  sent  to  dar_xform  will  abort  the  program immediately, there is no way to have a proper
       termination before the end of the process
