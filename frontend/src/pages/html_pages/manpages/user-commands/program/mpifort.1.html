</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       mpifort -  Compiles and links MPI programs written in Fortran 90

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This  command  can  be used to compile and link MPI programs written in Fortran.  It provides the options
       and any special libraries that are needed to compile and link MPI programs.

       It is important to use this command, particularly when linking programs, as  it  provides  the  necessary
       libraries.

</pre><h4><b>COMMAND</b> <b>LINE</b> <b>ARGUMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-show</b>  - Show the commands that would be used without running them
       <b>-help</b>  - Give short help
       <b>-fc=name</b>
              -  Use  compiler  <u>name</u> instead of the default choice.  Use this only if the compiler is compatible
              with the MPICH library (see below)
       <b>-config=name</b>
              - Load a configuration file for a particular compiler.  This allows a single <u>mpifort</u> command to be
              used with multiple compilers.
       <b>-compile_info</b>
              - Show the steps for compiling a program.  This option can be used to see what options and include
              paths are used by mpifort.
       <b>-link_info</b>
              - Show the steps for linking a program.  This option can be used to see what options and libraries
              are used by mpifort.
       <b>-profile=name</b>
              - Use the MPI profiling given by name.  See below for details
       <b>-echo</b>  - Show exactly what this program is doing.  This option should normally not be used.
       <b>-static</b>
              - mpi - Use a statically  compile  MPI  library,  but  shared  libraries  for  all  of  the  other
              dependencies.
       <b>others</b> -  are  passed to the compiler or linker.  For example, <u>-c</u> causes files to be compiled, <u>-g</u> selects
              compilation with debugging on most systems, and <u>-o</u> <u>name</u> causes linking with the output  executable
              given the name <u>name</u> .

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       The  environment  variables  <u>MPICH_FC</u>  may be used to select different Fortran compiler and linker.  Note
       that since MPICH is built with a particular C and Fortran compiler, change the compilers used  can  cause
       problems.  Use this only if you could intermix code compiled with the different compilers.

</pre><h4><b>COMPATIBLE</b> <b>COMPILERS</b></h4><pre>
       The  MPI library may be used with any compiler that uses the same lengths for basic data objects (such as
       <u>long</u> <u>double</u> ) and that uses compatible run-time libraries.  On many systems, the  various  compilers  are
       compatible  and  may  be used interchangeably.  There are exceptions; if you use the <u>MPICH_FC</u> environment
       variable or the <u>-fc=name</u> command-line argument to override the choice of compiler and encounter problems,
       try reconfiguring MPICH with the new compiler and installing MPICH  in  a  separate  location.   See  the
       installation manual for more details.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       To compile a single file <u>foo.f</u> , use
       mpifort -c foo.f

       To link the output and make an executable, use
       mpifort -o foo foo.o

       Combining compilation and linking in a single command
       mpifort -o foo foo.f

       is a convenient way to build simple programs.

</pre><h4><b>SELECTING</b> <b>A</b> <b>PROFILING</b> <b>LIBRARY</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>-profile=name</u> argument allows you to specify an MPI profiling library to be used.  <u>name</u> can have two
       forms:

       A library in the same directory as the MPI library
       The name of a profile configuration file

       If <u>name</u> is a library, then this library is included before the MPI library.  This allows the  simple  use
       of libraries that make use of the MPI profiling interface and that are installed in the same directory as
       the MPI library.

       If  <u>name.conf</u>  is  the  name  of a file in the sysconfdir directory, then this is read and may define the
       following variables:
       <b>PROFILE_PRELIB</b>
              - Libraries (and paths) to include before the MPI library
       <b>PROFILE_POSTLIB</b>
              - Libraries to include after the MPI library
       <b>PROFILE_INCPATHS</b>
              - C preprocessor arguments for any include files For example, to add <u>/usr/local/myprof/include</u>  to
              the  include path and the library <u>libmyprof.a</u> in <u>/usr/local/myprof/lib</u> to the link step, you could
              create the file <u>myprof.conf</u> with the lines

              PROFILE_PRELIB="-L/usr/local/myprof/lib -lmyprof"
              PROFILE_INCPATHS="-I/usr/local/myprof/include"

              and place it in the sysconfdir directory (this directory is set at configure time  when  MPICH  is
              built).   Then  using the command-line argument <u>-profile=myprof</u> will cause these definitions to be
              added to the relevant compile commands.
