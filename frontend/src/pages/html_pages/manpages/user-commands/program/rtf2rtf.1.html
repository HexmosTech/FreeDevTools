</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       rtf2rtf - programs to postprocess the raw RTF generated by the mapping files

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>rtf2rtf</b> <u>[options]</u> <u>..</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  documents  briefly the <b>rtf2rtf</b> commands.  This manual page was written for the Debian
       GNU/Linux distribution because the original program does not have a manual page for rtf2rtf.

       <b>rtf2rtf</b> is a program to postprocess the raw RTF generated by the mapping files.

       It is used by other programs in sgml-tools (v1), and usually normal  user  does  not  need  to  use  this
       program directly.

       Following is quoted from the README in the source tree.

       I'm  not proud of this code. It's a hack foisted upon a hack, nested within another hack or two.  It sort
       of works well enough for my purposes (generating WinHelp .RTF files  for  my  documents),  but  it  could
       definitely  use  a redesign/rewrite. It started as a simple perturbation of the html2html filter, but got
       ugly very quickly...

       I shamelessly blame the RTF format for most of the hackery here -- RTF is not a _language_ like LaTeX  or
       ROFF  --  it's  just  a  file  format.  So,  we can't rely on RTF to do even simple things like "insert a
       paragraph break here only if the previous token was not also a paragraph break. Since the SGML front  end
       has  no  conditional processing capabilities, multiple blank likes in the SGML get translated to multiple
       para breaks in the RTF. That's why we use a "lex" filter (rtf2rtf) to postprocess the raw  RTF  generated
       by the mapping files.

       Again:  I  offer  this to the Linuxdoc community with the hopes that it will be useful to others and that
       someone else can help flesh out the missing pieces. What? Missing pieces?  Yes,  recall  that  I  say  it
       works  "well  enough  for my purposes".  The replacement files (general, mapping) started out like as the
       latex replacement files.  Much of them still _are_ the latex replacement files.  I only  converted  those
       parts  that  are  actually  used  by  my  documents.  Your  documents may require more of the files to be
       translated to RTF.

       Since I'm using these mappings for actual documentation, I plan on maintaining this  backend,  so  please
       send  me  any  improvements -- I'll coordinate with Greg to make sure they get into the the next official
       release.
