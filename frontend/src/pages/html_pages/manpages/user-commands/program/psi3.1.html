</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       psi3 - master execution driver for the PSI programs

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  program  <b>psi3</b>  reads your input deck, determines what type of calculation you are trying to perform,
       and runs the appropriate programs.  <b>psi3</b> reads the file /usr/local/psi3/share/psi.dat by  default.   This
       file  contains macros for some standard calculations.  Psi is very flexible, however, and anything in the
       psi.dat file can be overridden by the user.  Thus, all that is written below should be taken with a grain
       of salt.  Experimentation is the best way to learn the <b>psi3</b> command, and nothing  that  is  written  here
       should  be  taken as gospel.  A good place to look for syntax is in the psi.dat file.  Hopefully this man
       page and the psi.dat file should tell you all you need to know to get started.

</pre><h4><b>COMMAND-LINE</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The following command-line arguments are available:

       <u>-i</u> or <u>-f</u>
              This flag is used to specify the input file name, e.g.  <b>psi3</b> <b>-i</b> <b>h2o.in</b> where <b>h2o.in</b> is the name of
              input file. By default, <b>psi3</b> and PSI modules that it calls will look for <b>input.dat</b> <b>.</b>

       <u>-o</u>     This flag is used to specify the output file name, e.g.  <b>psi3</b> <b>-o</b> <b>h2o.out</b> where <b>h2o.in</b> is the  name
              of output file. By default, <b>psi3</b> and PSI modules that it calls will look for <b>output.dat</b> <b>.</b>

       <u>-p</u>     This  flag  is  used  to  specify  the PSI file prefix, e.g.  <b>psi3</b> <b>-p</b> <b>h2o.dzp</b> where <b>h2o.dzp</b> is the
              prefix that will be used for all PSI files. By default, <b>psi3</b> and PSI modules that  it  calls  will
              use <b>psi</b> for the file prefix. Hence, the checkpoint file is by default called <b>psi.32</b> <b>.</b>

       <u>--noinput</u> or <u>-n</u>
              This tells <b>psi3</b> driver not to run <b>input</b> program. This flag is useful for scripting and debugging.

       <u>--check</u> or <u>-c</u>
              This  tells  <b>psi3</b>  driver  to  check  the  input and print out the list of programs which would be
              executed. Equivalent to setting <b>CHECK=TRUE</b> in the input file.

       <u>--messy</u> or <u>-m</u>
              This tells <b>psi3</b> driver not to run cleanup program <b>psiclean</b> <b>.</b>   Usually,  the  cleanup  program  is
              invoked via the <b>$done</b> macro defined in <b>psi.dat</b> <b>.</b>  This flag is useful for scripting and debugging.

</pre><h4><b>INPUT</b> <b>FORMAT</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>psi3</b> program searches through the default keyword path (first <b>PSI</b> and then <b>DEFAULT</b>) for the following
       keywords:

       <b>JOBTYPE</b> <b>=</b> <u>string</u>
              This  tells  the <b>psi3</b> driver program what kind of calculation you want to run.  Acceptable choices
              are: <b>SP</b> (for a single-point energy computation), <b>OPT</b> (for an optimization, either using  gradients
              or  energies),  <b>FREQ</b>  (for  harmonic  vibrational  frequencies), <b>FC</b> (for force constants by finite
              differences of internal coordinates ), <b>SYMM_FC</b> (for  force  constants  by  finite  differences  of
              internal  coordinates,  symmetric  modes  only),  <b>DISP</b> (for a series of single-points at different
              displaced geometries), <b>DBOC</b>  (to  compute  the  Diagonal  Born-Oppenheimer  Correction  [DBOC]  to
              electronic energy).  The default is <b>SP</b>.

       <b>WFN</b> <b>=</b> <u>string</u>
              This  is  the  type  of  wavefunction which is ultimately desired.  As of this writing, acceptable
              values for WFN are SCF, MP2, CCSD, CCSD_T, DETCI, CASSCF,  and  RASSCF.   Having  WFN  defined  as
              anything  else  is not necessarily bad, but don't expect <b>psi3</b> to be able to figure out what to do.
              If you have a non-standard WFN, then it would probably be best to provide  an  EXEC  section  (see
              below).  There is no default.

       <b>REFERENCE</b> <b>=</b> <u>string</u>
              This specifies the reference wavefunction desired.  It can be one of <b>RHF</b> (for a closed shell spin-
              restricted Hartree-Fock), <b>ROHF</b> (for an open-shell spin-restricted Hartree-Fock), <b>UHF</b> (for an open-
              shell  spin-unrestricted  Hartree-Fock), or <b>TWOCON</b> (for a two configuration singlet).  The default
              is <b>RHF</b>.

       <b>DERTYPE</b> <b>=</b> <u>string</u>
              This specifies the order of derivative that is to eventually be done.  The default is <b>NONE</b>.

       <b>OPT</b> <b>=</b> <u>boolean</u>
              Set this equal to true if you are performing a  geometry  optimization.   The  default  is  false.
              Note: This is an old keyword which is now obsolete; it has been replaced by the <b>JOBTYPE</b> keyword.

       <b>NOPT</b> <b>=</b> <u>integer</u>
              This gives the maximum number of iterations if OPT is true.  The default is 1.

       <b>DISP</b> <b>=</b> <u>boolean</u>
              Set this equal to true if you are performing a finite displacements.  The default is false.  Note:
              This is an old keyword which is now obsolete; it has been replaced by the <b>JOBTYPE</b> keyword.

       <b>NDISP</b> <b>=</b> <u>integer</u>
              This gives the maximum number of displacements if DISP is true.  The default is 1.

       <b>NCASITER</b> <b>=</b> <u>integer</u>
              This gives the maximum number of CASSCF iterations if WFN = CASSCF.  The default is 1.

       <b>CHECK</b> <b>=</b> <u>boolean</u>
              If  this  is true, then <b>psi3</b> will parse your input deck, and print out the sequence of commands to
              be executed.  The default is false.

       <b>EXEC</b> <b>=</b> <u>string_vector</u>
              The EXEC vector contains a list of commands to be executed by  <b>psi3</b>.   Explicit  commands  can  be
              entered  in  double quotes, or preset variables can be entered using the convention $<u>variable</u> (see
              examples below).  Thus if you want to run <b>ints</b> at some point, you could have

              psi: (
                exec = (
                  ...
                  "ints"
                  ...
                  )
                )

              or

              psi: (
                ints = "ints"
                exec = (
                  ...
                  $ints
                  ...
                  )
                )

              in your input.

</pre><h4><b>LOOP</b> <b>CONTROL</b></h4><pre>
       Loop control is handled via the "repeat" and "end" built-in commands.  The syntax is

        repeat <u>n</u>  [commands to be executed] end

       where <u>n</u> is the number of times to repeat the loop.  An inspection of the psi.dat file will show that this
       is how geometry optimizations and finite displacements are performed;  in these cases <u>n</u> is set  equal  to
       NOPT or NDISP.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Let's say you want to do an scf geometry optimization. Your <b>psi3</b> input could then be:

       default: (
         jobtype = opt
         wfn = scf
         dertype = first
         reference = rhf
         nopt = 5
         ...
         )

       What  <b>psi3</b>  would  do  with this is look in psi.dat or your input for a variable called SCFCLOSEDFIRSTOPT
       (you see, <b>psi</b> catenates the values (roughly) for WFN, REFERENCE, DERTYPE, and OPT/DISP, in  approximately
       that  order  (case  doesn't  matter)),  and  then  executes the commands defined in the SCFCLOSEDFIRSTOPT
       vector.  Got it?

       So now, let's say you want to run a program "myscf" instead of whatever scf <b>psi3</b> thinks you  should  run.
       What you would do is put the line

        scf = "myscf"

       in your input.

       Okay,  one last example, then you're on your own.  I want to run <b>proper</b> after <b>deriv</b> in my scf gradient. I
       would have several ways to do this.

       1) Brute force

              default: (
                exec = (
                 repeat 5
                   "cints"
                   "cscf"
                   $deriv       % this is defined in psi.dat as "cints --deriv1"
                   "oeprop"
                   $geomupdate  % this is defined in psi.dat
                 end
                 $done
                 )
                )

       2) Elegant

              default: (
                SCFFirst = ($ints $scf $deriv $oeprop)
                )

       3) Obscure

              default: (
                deriv = ("cints --deriv1" "oeprop")
                )

              And there are others.  The only limit is your own tortured imagination.

       Like I said, the best way to find out what <b>psi3</b> can do is to look in psi.dat,  and  to  play  around  for
       awhile.  The CHECK option is very useful for this.  Good luck!

                                                 25 August, 2003                                         <u><a href="../man1/psi3.1.html">psi3</a></u>(1)
