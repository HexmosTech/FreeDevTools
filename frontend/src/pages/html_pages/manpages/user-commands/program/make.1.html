</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       make - GNU make utility to maintain groups of programs

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>make</b> [<u>OPTION</u>]... [<u>TARGET</u>]...

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>make</u> utility will determine automatically which pieces of a large program need to be recompiled, and
       issue the commands to recompile them.  The manual describes the GNU implementation  of  <b>make</b>,  which  was
       written  by Richard Stallman and Roland McGrath, and is currently maintained by Paul Smith.  Our examples
       show C programs, since they are very common, but you can use <b>make</b> with  any  programming  language  whose
       compiler  can  be run with a shell command.  In fact, <b>make</b> is not limited to programs.  You can use it to
       describe any task where some files must be updated automatically from others whenever the others change.

       To prepare to use <b>make</b>, you must write a file called the <u>makefile</u> that describes the relationships  among
       files  in  your program, and the states the commands for updating each file.  In a program, typically the
       executable file is updated from object files, which are in turn made by compiling source files.

       Once a suitable makefile exists, each time you change some source files, this simple shell command:

              <b>make</b>

       suffices to perform all necessary recompilations.  The <b>make</b> program uses the makefile description and the
       last-modification times of the files to decide which of the files need to be updated.  For each of  those
       files, it issues the commands recorded in the makefile.

       <b>make</b>  executes  commands  in  the  <u>makefile</u> to update one or more target <u>names</u>, where <u>name</u> is typically a
       program.  If no <b>-f</b> option is present, <b>make</b>  will  look  for  the  makefiles  <u>GNUmakefile</u>,  <u>makefile</u>,  and
       <u>Makefile</u>, in that order.

       Normally  you  should  call your makefile either <u>makefile</u> or <u>Makefile</u>.  (We recommend <u>Makefile</u> because it
       appears prominently near the beginning of a directory listing, right near other important files  such  as
       <u>README</u>.)   The  first  name  checked, <u>GNUmakefile</u>, is not recommended for most makefiles.  You should use
       this name if you have a makefile that is specific to GNU <b>make</b>,  and  will  not  be  understood  by  other
       versions of <b>make</b>.  If <u>makefile</u> is '-', the standard input is read.

       <b>make</b>  updates  a  target if it depends on prerequisite files that have been modified since the target was
       last modified, or if the target does not exist.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-b</b>, <b>-m</b>
            These options are ignored for compatibility with other versions of <b>make</b>.

       <b>-B</b>, <b>--always-make</b>
            Unconditionally make all targets.

       <b>-C</b> <u>dir</u>, <b>--directory</b>=<u>dir</u>
            Change to directory <u>dir</u> before reading the makefiles or doing anything else.  If multiple <b>-C</b> options
            are specified, each is interpreted relative to the previous one: <b>-C</b> / <b>-C</b> etc  is  equivalent  to  <b>-C</b>
            /etc.  This is typically used with recursive invocations of <b>make</b>.

       <b>-d</b>   Print  debugging information in addition to normal processing.  The debugging information says which
            files are being considered for remaking, which file-times are being compared and with what  results,
            which  files  actually  need  to  be  remade,  which  implicit  rules  are  considered and which are
            applied---everything interesting about how <b>make</b> decides what to do.

       <b>--debug</b><u>[=FLAGS]</u>
            Print debugging information in addition to normal processing.  If the <u>FLAGS</u> are  omitted,  then  the
            behavior is the same as if <b>-d</b> was specified.  <u>FLAGS</u> may be <u>a</u> for all debugging output (same as using
            <b>-d</b>),  <u>b</u> for basic debugging, <u>v</u> for more verbose basic debugging, <u>i</u> for showing implicit rules, <u>j</u> for
            details on invocation of commands, and <u>m</u> for debugging while remaking makefiles.  Use <u>n</u>  to  disable
            all previous debugging flags.

       <b>-e</b>, <b>--environment-overrides</b>
            Give variables taken from the environment precedence over variables from makefiles.

       <b>-f</b> <u>file</u>, <b>--file</b>=<u>file</u>, <b>--makefile</b>=<u>FILE</u>
            Use <u>file</u> as a makefile.

       <b>-i</b>, <b>--ignore-errors</b>
            Ignore all errors in commands executed to remake files.

       <b>-I</b> <u>dir</u>, <b>--include-dir</b>=<u>dir</u>
            Specifies  a  directory  <u>dir</u>  to  search  for included makefiles.  If several <b>-I</b> options are used to
            specify several directories, the directories are  searched  in  the  order  specified.   Unlike  the
            arguments  to other flags of <b>make</b>, directories given with <b>-I</b> flags may come directly after the flag:
            <b>-I</b><u>dir</u> is allowed, as well as  <b>-I</b>  <u>dir</u>.   This  syntax  is  allowed  for  compatibility  with  the  C
            preprocessor's <b>-I</b> flag.

       <b>-j</b> [<u>jobs</u>], <b>--jobs</b>[=<u>jobs</u>]
            Specifies the number of <u>jobs</u> (commands) to run simultaneously.  If there is more than one <b>-j</b> option,
            the  last  one is effective.  If the <b>-j</b> option is given without an argument, <b>make</b> will not limit the
            number of jobs that can run simultaneously. When <b>make</b> invokes a <b>sub-make,</b> all instances of make will
            coordinate to run the specified number of jobs at a time; see the  section  <b>PARALLEL</b>  <b>MAKE</b>  <b>AND</b>  <b>THE</b>
            <b>JOBSERVER</b> for details.

       <b>--jobserver-fds</b> [<u>R,W</u>]
            Internal  option <b>make</b> uses to pass the jobserver pipe read and write file descriptor numbers to <b>sub-</b>
            <b>makes</b>; see the section <b>PARALLEL</b> <b>MAKE</b> <b>AND</b> <b>THE</b> <b>JOBSERVER</b> for details

       <b>-k</b>, <b>--keep-going</b>
            Continue as much as possible after an error.  While the target that failed, and those that depend on
            it, cannot be remade, the other dependencies of these targets can be processed all the same.

       <b>-l</b> [<u>load</u>], <b>--load-average</b>[=<u>load</u>]
            Specifies that no new jobs (commands) should be started if there are others  jobs  running  and  the
            load  average is at least <u>load</u> (a floating-point number).  With no argument, removes a previous load
            limit.

       <b>-L</b>, <b>--check-symlink-times</b>
            Use the latest mtime between symlinks and target.

       <b>-n</b>, <b>--just-print</b>, <b>--dry-run</b>, <b>--recon</b>
            Print  the  commands  that  would  be  executed,  but  do  not  execute  them  (except  in   certain
            circumstances).

       <b>-o</b> <u>file</u>, <b>--old-file</b>=<u>file</u>, <b>--assume-old</b>=<u>file</u>
            Do not remake the file <u>file</u> even if it is older than its dependencies, and do not remake anything on
            account of changes in <u>file</u>.  Essentially the file is treated as very old and its rules are ignored.

       <b>-O</b>[<u>type</u>], <b>--output-sync</b>[=<u>type</u>]
            When  running multiple jobs in parallel with <b>-j</b>, ensure the output of each job is collected together
            rather than interspersed with output from other jobs.  If <u>type</u> is not specified  or  is  <b>target</b>  the
            output  from the entire recipe for each target is grouped together.  If <u>type</u> is <b>line</b> the output from
            each command line within a recipe is grouped together.  If <u>type</u> is <b>recurse</b>  output  from  an  entire
            recursive make is grouped together.  If <u>type</u> is <b>none</b> output synchronization is disabled.

       <b>-p</b>, <b>--print-data-base</b>
            Print  the  data  base  (rules  and  variable  values) that results from reading the makefiles; then
            execute as usual or as otherwise specified.  This also prints the version information given  by  the
            <b>-v</b>  switch  (see  below).   To  print  the data base without trying to remake any files, use <u>make</u> <u>-p</u>
            <u>-f/dev/null</u>.

       <b>-q</b>, <b>--question</b>
            ``Question mode''.  Do not run any commands, or print anything; just return an exit status  that  is
            zero if the specified targets are already up to date, nonzero otherwise.

       <b>-r</b>, <b>--no-builtin-rules</b>
            Eliminate  use  of  the  built-in  implicit  rules.  Also clear out the default list of suffixes for
            suffix rules.

       <b>-R</b>, <b>--no-builtin-variables</b>
            Don't define any built-in variables.

       <b>-s</b>, <b>--silent</b>, <b>--quiet</b>
            Silent operation; do not print the commands as they are executed.

       <b>-S</b>, <b>--no-keep-going</b>, <b>--stop</b>
            Cancel the effect of the <b>-k</b> option.  This is never necessary except in a  recursive  <b>make</b>  where  <b>-k</b>
            might  be  inherited  from  the  top-level  <b>make</b> via MAKEFLAGS or if you set <b>-k</b> in MAKEFLAGS in your
            environment.

       <b>-t</b>, <b>--touch</b>
            Touch files (mark them up to date without really changing them) instead of running  their  commands.
            This is used to pretend that the commands were done, in order to fool future invocations of <b>make</b>.

       <b>--trace</b>
            Information  about  the  disposition  of each target is printed (why the target is being rebuilt and
            what commands are run to rebuild it).

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--version</b>
            Print the version of the <b>make</b> program plus a copyright, a list of authors and a notice that there is
            no warranty.

       <b>-w</b>, <b>--print-directory</b>
            Print a message containing the working directory before and after other  processing.   This  may  be
            useful for tracking down errors from complicated nests of recursive <b>make</b> commands.

       <b>--no-print-directory</b>
            Turn off <b>-w</b>, even if it was turned on implicitly.

       <b>-W</b> <u>file</u>, <b>--what-if</b>=<u>file</u>, <b>--new-file</b>=<u>file</u>, <b>--assume-new</b>=<u>file</u>
            Pretend  that  the  target  <u>file</u> has just been modified.  When used with the <b>-n</b> flag, this shows you
            what would happen if you were to modify that file.  Without <b>-n</b>, it is almost the same as  running  a
            <u>touch</u>  command  on  the given file before running <b>make</b>, except that the modification time is changed
            only in the imagination of <b>make</b>.

       <b>--warn-undefined-variables</b>
            Warn when an undefined variable is referenced.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       GNU <b>make</b> exits with a status of zero if all makefiles were successfully parsed and no targets  that  were
       built failed.  A status of one will be returned if the <b>-q</b> flag was used and <b>make</b> determines that a target
       needs to be rebuilt.  A status of two will be returned if any errors were encountered.

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       The  full  documentation  for  <b>make</b> is maintained as a Texinfo manual.  If the <b>info</b> and <b>make</b> programs are
       properly installed at your site, the command

              <b>info</b> <b>make</b>

       should give you access to the complete manual. Additionally, the  manual  is  also  available  online  at
       <u>https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/index.html</u>

</pre><h4><b>PARALLEL</b> <b>MAKE</b> <b>AND</b> <b>THE</b> <b>JOBSERVER</b></h4><pre>
       Using  the  <u>-j</u>  option,  the user can instruct <b>make</b> to execute tasks in parallel. By specifying a numeric
       argument to <u>-j</u> the user may specify an upper limit of the number of parallel tasks to be run.

       When the build environment is such that a top level <b>make</b> invokes <b>sub-makes</b>  (for  instance,  a  style  in
       which  each sub-directory contains its own <u>Makefile</u>), no individual instance of <b>make</b> knows how many tasks
       are running in parallel, so keeping the number of tasks under the upper limit would be impossible without
       communication between all the <b>make</b> instances running. While solutions like  having  the  top  level  <b>make</b>
       serve  as a central controller are feasible, or using other synchronization mechanisms like shared memory
       or sockets can be created, the current implementation uses a simple shared pipe.

       This pipe is created by the top-level <b>make</b> process, and passed on to all the <b>sub-makes</b>.   The  top  level
       <b>make</b> process writes <b>N-1</b> one-byte tokens into the pipe (The top level <b>make</b> is assumed to reserve one token
       for  itself).  Whenever any of the <b>make</b> processes (including the top-level <b>make</b>) needs to run a new task,
       it reads a byte from the shared pipe. If there are no tokens left, it must wait for a token to be written
       back to the pipe. Once the task is completed, the <b>make</b> process writes a token back to the pipe (and thus,
       if the tokens had been exhausted, unblocking the first <b>make</b> process that was waiting to  read  a  token).
       Since only <b>N-1</b> tokens were written into the pipe, no more than <b>N</b> tasks can be running at any given time.

       If  the  job  to be run is not a <b>sub-make</b> then <b>make</b> will close the jobserver pipe file descriptors before
       invoking the commands, so that the command can not interfere with the <u>jobserver</u>, and the command does not
       find any unusual file descriptors.
