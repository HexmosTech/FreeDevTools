</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       bzip3 - an efficient statistical file compressor and spiritual successor to bzip2

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>bzip3</b> [ <b>-BbcdehftV</b> ] [ <u>filenames</u> <u>...</u>  ]

       <b>bz3cat</b> is equivalent to <b>bzip3</b> <b>-dc</b>

       <b>bunzip3</b> is equivalent to <b>bzip3</b> <b>-d</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Compress  or  decompress  a  file  using  run  length encoding and Lempel Ziv prediction, followed by the
       Burrows-Wheeler transform and arithmetic coding.  <b>bzip3,</b> like its ancestor <b>bzip2,</b> excels  at  compressing
       text or source code.

       The command-line options are deliberately very similar to those of <b>bzip2,</b> but they are not identical.

       <b>bzip3</b> expects at most two filenames intertwined with flags.  <b>bzip3</b> will by default not overwrite existing
       files.  If this behaviour is intended, use the -f flag.

       If  no  file names are specified, <b>bzip3</b> will compress from standard input to standard output, refusing to
       output binary data to a terminal. The -e flag (encode) is implied.

       <b>bunzip3</b> (or, <b>bzip3</b> <b>-d</b> equivalently) decompresses  data  from  standard  input  to  the  standard  output,
       refusing to read from a terminal.

       If  two files are specified, the first one is used in place of standard input, and the second one is used
       in place of standard output.

       If the -c flag is present, bzip3 will read from the specified file and output  data  to  standard  output
       instead.  Otherwise,  if decoding, <b>bzip3</b> will try to guess the decompressed filename by removing the <u>.bz3</u>
       extension. If not present, an error will be reported. If encoding, the output filename will be  generated
       by appending the <u>.bz3</u> extension to the input filename.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-B</b> <b>--batch</b>
              Enable  batch  mode.  By  default, <b>bzip3</b> will error if more than two files are passed, and the two
              files specified are always treated as input and output. The batch mode  makes  <b>bzip3</b>  treat  every
              file  as  input,  so  for  example  <u>bzip3</u>  <u>-Bd</u> <u>*.bz3</u> will decompress all <u>.bz3</u> files in the current
              directory.

       <b>-b</b> <b>--block</b> <b>N</b>
              Set the block size to N mebibytes. The minimum is 1MiB, the maximum is 511MiB.

       <b>-c</b> <b>--stdout</b>
              Force writing output data to the standard output if one file is specified.

       <b>-d</b> <b>--decode</b>
              Force decompression.

       <b>-e/-z</b> <b>--encode</b>
              Force compression (default behaviour).

       <b>-f</b> <b>--force</b>
              Overwrite existing files.

       <b>-h</b> <b>--help</b>
              Display a help message and exit.

       <b>-j</b> <b>--jobs</b> <b>N</b>
              Set the amount of parallel worker threads that process one block each.

       <b>--rm</b>   Remove the input files after successful compression or decompression. This is silently ignored  if
              output is stdout.

       <b>-k</b> <b>--keep</b>
              Keep  (don't  delete)  the input files. Set by default, provided only for compatibility with other
              compressors.

       <b>-v</b> <b>--verbose</b>
              Set verbose output mode to see compression statistics.

       <b>-V</b> <b>--version</b>
              Display version information and exit.

       <b>-t</b> <b>--test</b>
              Verify the validity of compressed blocks.

       <b>--</b>     Treat all subsequent arguments as file names, even if they start with a dash. This is so  you  can
              handle files with names beginning with a dash.

</pre><h4><b>FILE</b> <b>FORMAT</b></h4><pre>
       Compression  is  performed as long as the input block is longer than 64 bytes. Otherwise, it's coded as a
       literal block. In all other cases, the compressed data is written  to  the  file.  The  file  format  has
       constant  overhead  of  9  bytes  per file and from 9 to 17 bytes per block. Random data is coded so that
       expansion is generally under 0.8%.

       <b>bzip3</b> uses 32-bit CRC to ensure that the decompressed version of a file is  identical  to  the  original.
       This guards against corruption of the compressed data.

</pre><h4><b>MEMORY</b> <b>MANAGEMENT</b></h4><pre>
       The  -b flag sets the block size in mebibytes (MiB). The default is 16 MiB. Compression and decompression
       memory usage can be estimated as:

              6 x block size

       Larger block sizes usually give rapidly diminishing returns.  It is also important to appreciate that the
       decompression memory requirement is set at compression time by the choice of block size.  In general, try
       and use the largest block size memory constraints allow, since that maximises the  compression  achieved.
       Compression and decompression speed are virtually unaffected by block size.
