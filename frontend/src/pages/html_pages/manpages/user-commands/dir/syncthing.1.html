</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Syncthing  lets  you  synchronize  your  files  bidirectionally  across  multiple devices. This means the
       creation, modification or deletion of files on one machine will automatically be replicated to your other
       devices. We believe your data is your data alone and you deserve to choose where it is stored.  Therefore
       Syncthing  does not upload your data to the cloud but exchanges your data across your machines as soon as
       they are online at the same time.

       The <b>syncthing</b> core application is a command-line program which usually runs in the background and handles
       the synchronization. It provides a built-in, HTML and JavaScript based user interface  to  be  controlled
       from  a  web  browser. This frontend communicates with the core application through some HTTP APIs, which
       other apps like graphical system integration helpers can use as well, for greatest flexibility. A link to
       reach the GUI and API is printed among the first few log messages.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--allow-newer-config</b>
              Try loading a config file written by a newer program version, instead of failing immediately.

       <b>--audit</b>
              Write events to timestamped file <b>audit-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.log</b>.

       <b>--auditfile=&lt;file|-|--&gt;</b>
              Use specified file or stream (<b>"-"</b> for stdout, <b>"--"</b> for stderr) for audit events, rather  than  the
              timestamped default file name.

       <b>--browser-only</b>
              Open the web UI in a browser for an already running Syncthing instance.

       <b>--device-id</b>
              Print device ID to command line.

       <b>--generate=&lt;dir&gt;</b>
              Generate key and config in specified dir, then exit.

       <b>--gui-address=&lt;address&gt;</b>
              Override GUI listen address. Set this to an address (<b>0.0.0.0:8384</b>) or a URL (<b><a href="http://0.0.0.0">http://0.0.0.0</a>:8384</b>).
              Supported schemes are <b>http</b> for plain HTTP, <b>https</b> for HTTP over TLS, <b>unix</b> for plain Unix sockets or
              <b>unixs</b>    for    TLS    over    Unix    sockets.    A   Unix   socket   could   look   like   this:
              <b>unix:///run/syncthing/syncthing.socket</b>  (notice  the  three  slashes:  two  as  part  of  the  URL
              structure, one to specify an absolute path).

       <b>--gui-apikey=&lt;string&gt;</b>
              Override the API key needed to access the GUI / REST API.

       <b>--gui-password=&lt;password|-&gt;</b>
              Specify  new GUI authentication password, to update the config file.  Read from the standard input
              stream if only a single dash (<b>-</b>) is given.  A plaintext password is hashed before writing  to  the
              config file, but an already bcrypt-hashed input is stored verbatim.  As a special case, giving the
              existing password hash as password will leave it untouched.

       <b>--gui-user=&lt;username&gt;</b>
              Specify new GUI authentication user name, to update the config file.

       <b>--help,</b> <b>-h</b>
              Show help text about command line usage.  Context-sensitive depending on the given subcommand.

       <b>--home=&lt;dir&gt;</b>
              Set   common   configuration   and   data   directory.  The  default  configuration  directory  is
              <b>$XDG_STATE_HOME/syncthing</b> or <b>$HOME/.local/state/syncthing</b>  (Unix-like),  <b>$HOME/Library/Application</b>
              <b>Support/Syncthing</b> (Mac) and <b>%LOCALAPPDATA%\Syncthing</b> (Windows).

       <b>--config=&lt;dir&gt;</b>
              Set configuration directory. Alternative to <b>--home</b> and must be used together with <b>--data</b>.

       <b>--data=&lt;dir&gt;</b>
              Set data (e.g. database) directory. Alternative to <b>--home</b> and must be used together with <b>--config</b>.

       <b>--logfile=&lt;filename&gt;</b>
              Set destination filename for logging (use <b>"-"</b> for stdout, which is the default option).

       <b>--logflags=&lt;flags&gt;</b>
              Select information in log line prefix. The <b>--logflags</b> value is a sum of the following:

              • 1: Date

              • 2: Time

              • 4: Microsecond time

              • 8: Long filename

              • 16: Short filename

              To  prefix  each  log line with date and time, set <b>--logflags=3</b> (1 + 2 from above). The value 0 is
              used to disable all of the above. The default is to show time only (2).

       <b>--log-max-old-files=&lt;num&gt;</b>
              Number of old files to keep (zero to keep only  current).   Applies  only  when  log  rotation  is
              enabled through <b>--log-max-size</b>.

       <b>--log-max-size=&lt;num&gt;</b>
              Maximum size of any log file (zero to disable log rotation).

       <b>--no-browser</b>
              Do not start a browser.

       <b>--no-console</b>
              Hide the console window. (On Windows only)

       <b>--no-default-folder</b>
              Don’t  create  a  default folder when generating an initial configuration / starting for the first
              time.

       <b>--no-restart</b>
              Do not restart Syncthing when it exits. The monitor process will still run to handle  crashes  and
              writing to logfiles (if configured to).

       <b>--no-upgrade</b>
              Disable automatic upgrades.  Equivalent to the <b>STNOUPGRADE</b> environment variable, see below.

       <b>--paths</b>
              Print the paths used for configuration, keys, database, GUI overrides, default sync folder and the
              log file.

       <b>--paused</b>
              Start with all devices and folders paused.

       <b>--reset-database</b>
              Reset the database, forcing a full rescan and resync. Create <u>.stfolder</u> folders in each sync folder
              if  they  do  not  already  exist. <b>Caution</b>: Ensure that all sync folders which are mountpoints are
              already mounted.  Inconsistent versions may result if the mountpoint is later mounted and contains
              older versions.

       <b>--reset-deltas</b>
              Reset delta index IDs, forcing a full index exchange.

       <b>--skip-port-probing</b>
              Don’t try to find unused random ports for the GUI and listen address when  generating  an  initial
              configuration / starting for the first time.

       <b>--unpaused</b>
              Start with all devices and folders unpaused.

       <b>--upgrade</b>
              Perform upgrade.

       <b>--upgrade-check</b>
              Check for available upgrade.

       <b>--upgrade-to=&lt;url&gt;</b>
              Force upgrade directly from specified URL.

       <b>--verbose</b>
              Print verbose log output.

       <b>--version</b>
              Show version.

       <b>--to=&lt;dir&gt;</b>
              Destination directory where files should be stored after decryption.

       <b>--verify-only</b>
              Don’t write decrypted files to disk (but verify plaintext hashes).

       <b>--password=&lt;pw&gt;</b>
              Folder  password  for  decryption  /  verification.   Can  be  passed  through the <b>FOLDER_PASSWORD</b>
              environment variable instead to avoid recording in a shell’s history buffer or sniffing  from  the
              running processes list.

       <b>--folder-id=&lt;id&gt;</b>
              Folder ID of the encrypted folder, if it cannot be determined automatically.

       <b>--token-path=&lt;file&gt;</b>
              Path to the token file within the folder (used to determine folder ID).

       <b>--continue</b>
              Continue processing next file in case of error, instead of aborting.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>CODES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>0</b>      Success / Shutdown

       <b>1</b>      Error

       <b>2</b>      Upgrade not available

       <b>3</b>      Restarting

       <b>4</b>      Upgrading

       Exit  codes  over  125 are usually returned by the shell/binary loader/default signal handler. Exit codes
       over 128+N on Unix usually represent the signal which caused the process to exit. For example,  <b>128</b>  <b>+</b>  <b>9</b>
       <b>(SIGKILL)</b> <b>=</b> <b>137</b>.

</pre><h4><b>SUBCOMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       The  command  line  syntax  actually  supports  different modes of operation through several subcommands,
       specified as the first argument.  If omitted, the default <b>serve</b> is assumed.

       The initial setup of a device ID and default configuration can be called  explicitly  with  the  <b>generate</b>
       subcommand.   It can also update the configured GUI authentication credentials, without going through the
       REST API.  An existing device certificate is left untouched.  If the configuration file  already  exists,
       it  is  validated and updated to the latest configuration schema, including adding default values for any
       new options.

       The <b>decrypt</b> subcommand is used in conjunction  with  untrusted  (encrypted)  devices,  see  the  relevant
       section  on  <u>decryption</u> for details.  It does not depend on Syncthing to be running, but works on offline
       data.

       To work with the REST API for debugging or automating things in Syncthing, the  <b>cli</b>  subcommand  provides
       easy  access  to individual features.  It basically saves the hassle of handling HTTP connections and API
       authentication.

       The available subcommands are  grouped  into  several  nested  hierarchies  and  some  parts  dynamically
       generated  from  the  running  Syncthing instance.  On every level, the <b>--help</b> option lists the available
       properties, actions and commands for the user to discover interactively.  The top-level groups are:

       <b>config</b> Access the live configuration in a running instance over the REST API to retrieve (get) or  update
              (set)  values  in a fine-grained way.  The hierarchy is based on the same structure as used in the
              JSON / XML representations.

       <b>show</b>   Show system properties and status of a running instance.  The output is passed  on  directly  from
              the REST API response and therefore requires parsing JSON format.

       <b>operations</b>
              Control  the  overall  program  operation  such  as  restarting  or  handling upgrades, as well as
              triggering some actions on a per-folder basis.  Can also configure  the  default  ignore  patterns
              from a plain text ignore file.

       <b>errors</b> Examine pending error conditions that need attention from the user, or acknowledge (clear) them.

       <b>debug</b>  Various  tools  to  aid in diagnosing problems or collection information for bug reports.  Some of
              these commands access the database directly and can therefore only  work  when  Syncthing  is  not
              running.

       <b>-</b> <b>(a</b> <b>single</b> <b>dash)</b>
              Reads  subsequent  commands  from the standard input stream, without needing to call the <b>syncthing</b>
              <b>cli</b> command over and over.  Exits on any invalid command or when EOF (end-of-file) is received.

</pre><h4><b>PROXIES</b></h4><pre>
       Syncthing can use a SOCKS, HTTP, or HTTPS proxy to talk to the outside  world.  The  proxy  is  used  for
       outgoing  connections  only  -  it  is not possible to accept incoming connections through the proxy. The
       proxy is configured through the environment variable <b>all_proxy</b>. Somewhat unusually, this variable must be
       named in lower case - it is not “ALL_PROXY”. For example:

          $ export all_proxy=socks://192.0.2.42:8081

</pre><h4><b>DEVELOPMENT</b> <b>SETTINGS</b></h4><pre>
       The following environment variables modify Syncthing’s behavior  in  ways  that  are  mostly  useful  for
       developers.  Use  with  care.   If  you  start  Syncthing  from  within  service managers like systemd or
       supervisor, path expansion may not be supported.

       <b>STTRACE</b>
              Used to increase the debugging verbosity in specific or all facilities, generally mapping to a  Go
              package.  Enabling any of these also enables microsecond timestamps, file names plus line numbers.
              Enter a comma-separated string  of  facilities  to  trace.  <b>syncthing</b>  <b>--help</b>  always  outputs  an
              up-to-date list. The valid facility strings are:
