</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Xpra is a tool which allows you to run X programs — usually on a remote host  —  and  then  direct  their
       display  to  your  local  machine, disconnect from these programs, and reconnect from the same or another
       machine, all without losing any state.   It  differs  from  standard  X  forwarding  in  that  it  allows
       disconnection  and  reconnection  without  disrupting  the forwarded application; it differs from VNC and
       similar remote display technologies in that xpra can run <u>rootless</u>: i.e., applications forwarded  by  xpra
       appear  on  your desktop as normal windows managed by your window manager, rather than being all "trapped
       in a box together".  Xpra also uses a  custom  protocol  that  is  self-tuning  and  relatively  latency-
       insensitive,  and  thus is usable over network connections that are too slow or unreliable for standard X
       forwarding.  Xpra can also be used to shadow an existing X11 display, or in desktop mode where it behaves
       more like VNC.

       By default the Xpra server announces available sessions (username and display number)  via  mDNS  to  the
       local network. Use <b>mdns=no</b> to disable it.

</pre><h4><b>CONNECTION</b> <b>STRINGS</b></h4><pre>
       Xpra supports many types of connection strings (some may require extra packages to be installed):

   <b>:DISPLAY</b>
       Local displays: this is the simplest form and is only valid for the current local displays of the current
       user.

   <b>tcp://[USERNAME@]HOST:PORT[/DISPLAY]</b>
       TCP  mode  uses port numbers and not display numbers. If multiple displays are available through a single
       TCP port (ie: using a proxy server), then one can also specify the display number.

   <b>ssl://[USERNAME@]HOST:PORT[/DISPLAY]</b>
       SSL adds a secure socket layer on top of the TCP mode.

   <b>vsock://[USERNAME[:PASSWORD]@]HOST:PORT</b>
       Almost identical to the TCP mode, but using AF_VSOCK for transport.

   <b>ws://[USERNAME[:PASSWORD]@]HOST:PORT/[DISPLAY]</b>
       Connect using websocket protocol.

   <b>wss://[USERNAME[:PASSWORD]@]HOST:PORT/[DISPLAY]</b>
       Connect using secure websocket protocol. (websocket with SSL)

   <b>ssh://[USERNAME[:PASSWORD]@]HOST[:SSH_PORT]/[DISPLAY][?QUERYSTRING]</b>
       Connect using secure shell. (SSH)

       Further options can be specified using the <b>--ssh</b> command line option.  The <b>QUERYSTRING</b>  can  be  used  to
       specify  an ssh proxy: ?proxy=ssh://[USERNAME[:PASSWORD]@]HOST[:SSH_PORT] xpra will then establish an SSH
       connection to the specified "proxy" host, and from that host xpra will set up an SSH  connection  to  the
       xpra server.

       For  backwards  compatibility,  SSH mode also supports the syntax: <b>ssh:[USERNAME[:PASSWORD]@]HOST:DISPLAY</b>
       but this form does not support specifying the SSH  port  number.   Older  versions  also  used  the  form
       <b>protocol:host:port</b>,  but  users  are  encouraged  to  move  to  a  more  standard URI format using <b>://</b> as
       separator.

       The password need only be specified when the server authentication module requires it.  (ie:  often  when
       authenticating against MS Windows servers, or with <b>multifile</b> and <b>sqlite</b> authentication modules)

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>xpra</b> <b>start</b> <u>:7</u>
            Start  an  xpra  server using display number <u>:7</u>.  Note: using <b>DISPLAY=</b><u>:7</u> <u>xterm</u> to start applications
            against a specific display is not recommended. Always prefer  using  xpra's  <b>--start=</b>  command  line
            option instead.  See this next example:

       <b>xpra</b> <b>start</b> --start=firefox
            Start  an  xpra  server, choosing a display automatically and start firefox on that virtual display.
            No window will appear until you attach with <b>xpra</b> <b>attach</b>.  The start child commands will  inherit  an
            environment tailored for running under xpra.

       <b>xpra</b> <b>start</b> <u>ssh://bigbox/7</u> <u>--start=xterm</u>
            Start an xpra server on <u>bigbox</u> with an xterm in it, and connect to it.

       <b>xpra</b> <b>start-desktop</b> <b>--start=xfce4-session</b>
            Start an xfce session in a nested X11 server on an automatically assigned display number.

       <b>xpra</b> <b>list</b>
            Show a list of xpra servers you have running on the current host.

       <b>xpra</b> <b>list-windows</b>
            Show  a  list of xpra servers you have running on the current host, including the session name and a
            list of windows.  (only if the session can be queried using <u>xpra</u> <u>info</u>)

       <b>xpra</b> <b>list-mdns</b>
            Show a list of xpra servers found via mDNS. (local network)

       <b>xpra</b> <b>showconfig</b>
            Shows the configuration that would be used with other sub-commands, taking into account the  command
            line arguments.

       <b>xpra</b> <b>showsetting</b> [<b>SETTING1..</b>]
            Shows  the  value  of  a  specific  configuration setting and which configuration directory set this
            value.

       <b>xpra</b> <b>attach</b> <u>:7</u>
            Attach to the xpra server that is using local display number <u>:7</u>.  Any apps running  on  that  server
            will appear on your screen.

       <b>xpra</b> <b>attach</b> <u>ssh://foo@frodo/7</u>
            Use  ssh to attach to the xpra server that is running on machine <u>frodo</u> as user <u>foo</u> and using display
            <u>:7</u>.  Any apps running on that server will appear on your local screen.

       <b>xpra</b> <b>start</b> <b>:7</b> <b>--start=screen</b>
            Start an xpra server and a <b><a href="../man1/screen.1.html">screen</a></b>(1) session.  If any of the applications inside screen  attempt  to
            use X, they will be directed to the xpra server.

</pre><h4><b>DISPLAYS</b></h4><pre>
       Understanding the basic idea of displays is critical to using xpra successfully.

       The  idea comes from standard X.  If you have multiple X servers running on the same host, then there has
       to be some way to distinguish them.  X does this by assigning each server a small, unique integer  called
       (perhaps  confusingly) its "display".  In the common case of a desktop machine that has only one X server
       running, that server uses display ":0" (or sometimes you'll see ":0.0", which is effectively  the  same).
       When  an application starts under X, it needs to know how to find the right X server to use; it does this
       by checking the environment variable <b>$DISPLAY</b>.

       Xpra faces a similar problem — there may be multiple xpra servers running on the same host,  as  well  as
       multiple  X  servers.   It  solves this problem by re-using X's solution — each xpra server has a display
       associated with it.  This display functions as both  an  X  display  (for  when  xpra  is  talking  to  X
       applications) and as an identifier by which xpra clients (like <b>xpra</b> <b>attach</b>) can locate the xpra server.

       You  may  omit  the display number when using <b>xpra</b> <b>start</b>: a display will be chosen for you automatically.
       The display number chosen will be shown in the log output, you should also be able to see  it  with  <b>xpra</b>
       <b>list</b>.  On Microsoft Windows and Mac OSX, the display number should be omitted.

       Otherwise,  when  starting an xpra server, you may want to specify the name of the display to use.  To do
       this, simply pick any number you like and stick a colon in front of it.  For instance :7, :12, and  :3117
       are all valid display names.  Just keep in mind that:

       •      Every  X or xpra server that is running on a single machine must use a different display name.  If
              you pick a number that is already in use then xpra will not work.

       •      The first few numbers (0, 1, 2) are commonly used by real X servers.

       •      Everyone who connects to a given machine using <b><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></b>(1) with X forwarding enabled will  also  use  a
              display number; ssh generally picks numbers near ten (10, 11, 12, ...).

       When  specifying  an xpra server to a client program like <b>xpra</b> <b>attach</b>, <b>xpra</b> <b>detach</b>, <b>xpra</b> <b>stop</b>, <b>xpra</b> <b>exit</b>,
       <b>xpra</b> <b>version</b>, <b>xpra</b> <b>info</b>, <b>xpra</b> <b>list</b> or <b>xpra</b> <b>screenshot</b> then you can use a display of the form <b>:</b><u>DISPLAY</u>  to
       refer to a server on the local host, or one of the form <b>ssh://</b><u>[USER@]HOST</u><b>/</b><u>DISPLAY</u> to refer to a server on
       a  remote  host; xpra will automatically connect to the remote host using <b><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></b>(1).  Generally, if you have
       only one xpra session running on a machine (which you can verify by running <b>xpra</b> <b>list</b> on  that  machine),
       then  you  can  omit  the  number  entirely; <b>xpra</b> <b>attach</b> alone will attach to the lone xpra server on the
       current machine regardless of its number, <b>xpra</b> <b>attach</b> <b>ssh://frodo</b> will similarly attach to the lone  xpra
       session on a remote machine.

       Connecting  using  the  display  number assumes that the client and server use the same configuration for
       socket directories, or at least that the client can find at least one of the directories used by the unix
       domain sockets (see <u>bind</u>, <u>socket-dir</u> and <u>socket-dirs</u>).

       If the xpra server was given the <b>--bind-tcp</b>, <b>--bind-ssl</b> <b>--bind-udp</b>=<u>[HOST]:PORT</u>, <b>--bind-ws</b>, <b>--bind-wss</b>  or
       <b>--bind-vsock</b>  option  when  started  then  you  can  also  connect  to  it  using  a  display of the form
       <b>tcp://HOST:PORT[/DISPLAY]</b>,             <b>udp://HOST:PORT[/DISPLAY]</b>,              <b>ssl://HOST:PORT[/DISPLAY]</b>,
       <b>ws://HOST:PORT[/DISPLAY]</b>, <b>wss://HOST:PORT[/DISPLAY]</b> or <b>vsock://HOST:PORT[/DISPLAY]</b>.

</pre><h4><b>SUBCOMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>xpra</b> <b>start</b>
       This  command  starts  a  new xpra server, including any necessary setup.  (When starting a remote server
       with the <b>ssh://HOST/DISPLAY</b> syntax, the new session will also be attached.)

   <b>xpra</b> <b>start-desktop</b>
       Starts a nested X11 server, all child commands will be started in the nested X11 server.

   <b>xpra</b> <b>attach</b>
       This command attaches to a running xpra server, and forwards any applications using that server to appear
       on your current screen.

   <b>xpra</b> <b>detach</b>
       Detaches the given xpra display.

   <b>xpra</b> <b>screenshot</b>
       Takes a screenshot and saves it to the filename specified.  Note: screenshots can only be  taken  when  a
       client is attached.

   <b>xpra</b> <b>version</b>
       Queries the server version and prints it out.  Note: older servers may not support this feature.

   <b>xpra</b> <b>info</b>
       Queries the server for version, status and statistics.

   <b>xpra</b> <b>top</b>
       Shows the server's key health attributes.

   <b>xpra</b> <b>control</b>
       Modify  the  server  at  runtime by issuing commands.  The list of commands can be obtained by specifying
       "help" as command.  Some of those commands may support a "help" mode themselves.

   <b>xpra</b> <b>initenv</b>
       This internal command creates the <b>run-xpra</b> script used with ssh connections.

   <b>xpra</b> <b>stop</b>
       This command attaches to a running xpra server,  and  requests  that  it  terminates  immediately.   This
       generally causes any applications using that server to terminate as well.

   <b>xpra</b> <b>exit</b>
       This command attaches to a running xpra server, and requests that it terminates immediately.  Unlike <b>xpra</b>
       <b>stop</b>, the Xvfb process and its X11 clients (if any) will be left running.

   <b>xpra</b> <b>showconfig</b>
       This  commands  shows  the  configuration which would be used given the arguments provided.  You can also
       specify as extra arguments the specific options that should be displayed, or use the special value <u>all</u> to
       display all the options including the ones which are normally not displayed because they are not relevant
       on the given system.

   <b>xpra</b> <b>list</b>
       This command finds all xpra servers that have been started by the current user on  the  current  machine,
       and lists them.

   <b>xpra</b> <b>upgrade</b>
       This  command  starts  a new xpra server, but instead of creating it from scratch, it attaches to another
       existing server, tells it to exit, and takes over managing the applications that it was managing  before.
       As  the  name suggests, the main use case is to replace a server running against an older version of xpra
       with a newer version, without having to restart your session.  Any currently-running <b>xpra</b> <b>attach</b>  command
       will exit and need to be restarted.

   <b>xpra</b> <b>upgrade-desktop</b>
       Same  as  <u>upgrade</u> but for servers started using <u>start-desktop</u>.  It is possible to upgrade seamless server
       into a desktop server and vice versa.

   <b>xpra</b> <b>shadow</b>
       This command shadows an existing X11 display. If there is only one X11 display active and its  number  is
       below 10, it can be auto-detected.

       Note  that  this mode of operation uses screenscraping which is far less efficient. Using a video encoder
       (h264 or vp8) is highly recommended for this mode of operation.

   <b>xpra</b> <b>proxy</b>
       This command allows a single server to proxy connections for multiple others, potentially  serving  as  a
       load  balancing  or  authentication  entry  point  for  many sessions.  The proxy server will spawn a new
       process for each proxy connection, this proxy process will create  an  unauthenticated  new  unix  domain
       socket which can be used with the subcommands <b>info</b>, <b>version</b> and <b>stop</b>.

   <b>Important</b> <b>Note</b>
       Some platforms and package managers may choose to only build the client and not the server. In this case,
       only the <b>attach</b> subcommand will be available.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>General</b> <b>options</b>
       <b>--version</b>
              Displays xpra's version number.

       <b>-h,</b> <b>--help</b>
              Displays a summary of command line usage.

       <b>-d</b> <u>FILTER1,FILTER2,...</u>, <b>--debug</b>=<u>FILTER1,FILTER2,...</u>
              Enable debug logging.  The special value <b>all</b> enables all debugging.

       <b>--mmap</b>=<u>yes</u>|<u>no</u>|<u>ABSOLUTEFILENAME</u>
              Enable  or  disable  memory  mapped  pixel  data  transfer.   By  default  it  is normally enabled
              automatically if the server and the client reside on the same filesystem namespace.   This  method
              of  data  transfer  offers much lower overheads and reduces both CPU consumption and local network
              traffic.  When attaching, you can also specify an absolute  path  where  the  mmap  file  will  be
              created.

       <b>--mmap-group</b>=<u>GROUP</u>
              Sets  the  mmap  file's  gid  to  the  group  specified, and sets the permissions to 660.  This is
              necessary to share the mmap file across user accounts.  You can also use the special <u>GROUP</u> values:

              <b>no</b>     Disable the functionality, the mmap file will use the default file permissions and  default
                     group ownership.

              <b>SOCKET</b> The  group  used  will  be  the same one as found on the unix domain socket file the client
                     connects to.  Obviously, this can only work when connecting to unix domain sockets.

              <b>auto</b>   Will use the 'xpra' group if the user is a member, otherwise it will fallback to  the  same
                     behaviour as <u>SOCKET</u>.

       <b>--windows</b>=<u>yes</u>|<u>no</u>
              Enable  or  disable the forwarding of windows. This is usually the primary use for xpra and should
              be enabled.

       <b>--min-size</b>=<u>WIDTH</u>x<u>HEIGHT</u>
              Sets the minimum size for all decorated windows.

       <b>--max-size</b>=<u>WIDTH</u>x<u>HEIGHT</u>
              Sets the maximum size for all windows.

       <b>--readonly</b>=<u>yes</u>|<u>no</u>
              Read only mode ignores all keyboard and mouse activity.

       <b>--clipboard</b>=<u>yes</u>|<u>no|clipboard-type</u>
              Enable or disable clipboard synchronization.  If disabled on the server, no clients will  be  able
              to  use  clipboard  synchronization  at  all.  If  turned  off on the client, only this particular
              connection will ignore clipboard data from the server.   This  can  also  be  used  to  specify  a
              different  clipboard  implementation.   The  clipboard  types available will vary from platform to
              platform and also depend on build time environment and options so  this  is  best  left  on  <b>auto</b>.
              Other clipboard types available may include:

              <b>translated</b>
                     Clipboard which can translate from one type of selection to another

              <b>GDK</b>    The most complete clipboard implementation, includes full X11 support

              <b>default</b>
                     Fallback clipboard, with limited X11 support

              <b>OSX</b>    OSX specific clipboard

       <b>--clipboard-direction</b>=<u>to-server</u>|<u>to-client</u>|<u>both</u>|<u>disabled</u>
              Choose the direction of the clipboard synchronization.

       <b>--pulseaudio</b>=<u>yes</u>|<u>no</u>
              Enable or disable the starting of a pulseaudio server with the session.

       <b>--pulseaudio-command</b>=<u>SERVER-START-COMMAND</u>
              Specifies  the  pulseaudio  command  to  use  to start the pulseaudio server, unless disabled with
              <b>pulseaudio=no</b>.

       <b>--session-name</b>=<u>VALUE</u>
              Sets the name of this session. This value may be used in notifications, utilities, tray menu, etc.
              Setting this value on the server provides a default value which may be overridden on the client.

       <b>--encoding</b>=<u>ENCODING</u>
              This specifies the image encoding to use, there are a number of encodings  supported:  <b>jpeg</b>,  <b>png</b>,
              <b>png/P</b>,  <b>png/L</b>, <b>webp</b>, <b>rgb</b>, <b>vp8</b>, <b>vp9</b>, <b>h264</b> and <b>h265</b> (some may not be available in your environment).
              The default option is <b>auto</b> which allows the server to select the best encoding automatically.

              <b>auto</b>   default mode: the built-in heuristics will choose the most appropriate encoding

              <b>png</b>    compressed and lossless, can be quite slow.

              <b>png/P</b>  compressed and lossy: it uses a colour palette, which means better  compression  but  still
                     slow.

              <b>png/L</b>  compressed and lossy: grayscale only using a palette.

              <b>rgb</b>    a  raw  pixel  format  (lossless)  compressed  with  lz4, lzo or zlib (see <u>compressors</u>) the
                     compression ratio is lower, but it is by far the fastest encoding available.

              <b>webp</b>   can be used in lossy or lossless mode, useful for  graphical  applications,  it  compresses
                     better than jpeg and is reasonably fast except at high resolutions.

              <b>jpeg</b>   can be useful for graphical applications, it is lossy and usually very fast.

              <b>vp8</b>    lossy video encoding which always uses colour subsampling.  Fast at encoding and decoding.

              <b>vp9</b>    Video  encoding  which  supports  both  lossy  and lossless modes, available if your ffmpeg
                     library version is recent enough.

              <b>h264</b>   One of the best encoding available: it is fast, efficient and tunable via the  quality  and
                     speed options.

              <b>h265</b>   Far too slow at encoding, avoid.

       The  default  encoding  which  is  automatically  selected  if you do not specify one will depend on what
       options are available on both the server and the client: <b>rgb</b> is always available (builtin), <b>jpeg</b> and  <b>png</b>
       require  the  Python  Imaging  Library, <b>vp8</b>, <b>vp9</b>, <b>webp</b>, <b>h264</b> and <b>h265</b> all require their respective shared
       libraries, as well as the xpra codec that uses them.

       Note: when selecting a video encoding (usually <b>h264</b>, <b>vp8</b> or <b>vp9</b>), it will only be used if the  screen  is
       updating quickly enough, some of the smaller screen updates will also be sent using one of the other non-
       video encodings.

       <b>--video-scaling</b>=<u>on</u>|<u>off</u>|<u>SCALING</u>
              How  much  automatic video downscaling should be used, from 1 (rarely) to 100 (aggressively), 0 to
              disable.  Video scaling is normally used with video regions or very large windows (especially full
              screen windows) to try to maintain a  decent  framerate.   Video  downscaling  negatively  affects
              visual quality and will cause automatic refreshes (if enabled), it is most useful on video content
              where it saves a considerable amount of bandwidth.

       <b>--socket-dir</b>=<u>DIR</u>
              Location  where  to  write  and  look for the Xpra socket files.  The default location varies from
              platform to platform ("<a href="file:~/.xpra">~/.xpra</a>" on most Posix systems).  If  unspecified,  the  first  value  from
              <b>socket-dirs</b>  will  be  used.   It  may  also  be  specified  using the XPRA_SOCKET_DIR environment
              variable.

              When using the socket-dir option, it is generally necessary to specify <b>socket-dir</b>  or  <b>socket-dirs</b>
              on all following commands, for xpra to work with the open sessions.

              By  specifying  a  shared directory this can be coupled with the <u>mmap-group</u> and <u>socket-permissions</u>
              option to connect Xpra sessions across user accounts with shared memory acceleration.

       <b>--socket-dirs</b>=<u>DIR</u>
              Specifies the directories where to look for existing sockets if a specific one was not  set  using
              <b>socket-dir</b>.   You  may  specify each directory using a new <b>--socket-dirs</b> command line argument, or
              joined together by the path separator (<b>:</b> on Posix).  The paths will be expanded.   (ie:  <u>--socket-</u>
              <u>dirs=<a href="file:~/.xpra">~/.xpra</a>:<a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a></u>)

       <b>--file-transfer</b>=<u>on</u>|<u>off</u>
              Enable file transfers.

       <b>--open-files</b>=<u>on</u>|<u>off</u>
              This  option  may be used to allow the remote end to automatically open files after they have been
              uploaded.  This may be a security risk if you are using xpra to constrain  what  the  clients  can
              execute on the server.

       <b>--forward-xdg-open</b>=<u>on</u>|<u>off</u>
              Intercept execution of <u>xdg-open</u> and forward the request to the client.

       <b>--open-command</b>=<u>COMMAND</u>
              The command to use for opening files and URLs.

       <b>--bandwidth-limit</b>=<u>BITSPERSECOND</u>
              Restrict  bandwidth  usage to below the limit given.  The client's value cannot raise the limit of
              the server.  The value may be specified using standard units, ie: <u>1Mbps</u> or <u>500K</u>.   In  <u>auto</u>  mode,
              the client will set the bandwidth limit value to 80% of the maximum speed of the network interface
              it is using to connect to the server.

   <b>Options</b> <b>for</b> <b>start,</b> <b>start-desktop,</b> <b>upgrade,</b> <b>proxy</b> <b>and</b> <b>shadow</b>
       <b>--daemon</b>=<u>yes</u>|<u>no</u>
              By  default, the xpra server puts itself into the background, i.e. 'daemonizes', and redirects its
              output to a log file.  This can be used to prevent that behavior (useful mostly for debugging).

       <b>--resize-display</b>=<u>yes</u>|<u>no</u>
              Resize the virtual display to match the resolution of the client currently connected.   This  only
              applies to the <u>start</u> and <u>start-desktop</u> subcommands.

       <b>--fake-xinerama</b>=<u>PATH</u>|<u>auto</u>|<u>no</u>
              Specify  the  path  to  the  <b>libfakeXinerama.so</b>  library which will be injected into all the child
              processes the server starts using <u>LD_PRELOAD</u>.  This can also be  disabled  or  set  to  <u>auto</u>:  the
              server will then try to locate the library itself.  This only applies to the <u>start</u> subcommand.

       <b>--chdir</b>=<u>DIR</u>
              Change to this directory after daemonizing.

       <b>--uid</b>=<u>UID</u> and <b>--gid</b>=<u>GID</u>
              When launching the server as root, these options can be used to drop privileges to the given UID /
              GID.

       <b>--pidfile</b>=<u>FILENAME</u>
              Writes  the server process ID to this file on startup.  If the file has not been replaced, it will
              be deleted when the server exits.

       <b>--bind</b>=<u>BIND_LOCATION</u>
              Create a local Unix domain socket (on Unix) or named-pipe (on MS Windows)  for  each  <b>bind</b>  option
              specified.

              This  option  can be specified multiple times to specify multiple socket locations.  These sockets
              support local connections with the <b>:7</b>-style display  address,  and  remote  connections  with  the
              <b>ssh://frodo/7</b>-style display address.

              Local sockets may also process HTTP / Websocket connections if the <b>html</b> switch is enabled.

              The location can take the form:

              <b>none</b>   do not create a socket

              <b>auto</b>   backwards compatible default which uses the current <u>socket-dir</u>

              <b>DIRECTORY/</b>
                     create a socket in the directory specified, if the directory does not exist then it will be
                     created  -  you  should  include  the trailing slash to prevent the confusion with the <u>PATH</u>
                     form:

              <b>PATH</b>   create the socket using the path specified

       <b>--bind-tcp</b>=<u>[HOST]:PORT</u>
              Create a TCP socket for each <b>--bind-tcp</b> option specified.  If the host portion  is  omitted,  then
              127.0.0.1  (localhost)  will  be  used.  If you wish to accept connections on all interfaces, pass
              0.0.0.0 for the host portion.

              Using this switch without using the <u>tcp-auth</u> option is not recommended, and is  a  major  security
              risk  (especially  when  passing 0.0.0.0)!  Anyone at all may connect to this port and access your
              session.

              TCP sockets may also process HTTP / Websocket connections if the  <b>html</b>  switch  is  enabled.   TCP
              sockets may also be upgraded to SSL sockets if the <b>ssl</b> switch is enabled.

       <b>--bind-udp</b>=<u>[HOST]:PORT</u>
              Create  a  UDP  socket for each <b>--bind-udp</b> option specified.  If the host portion is omitted, then
              127.0.0.1 (localhost) will be used.  If you wish to accept connections  on  all  interfaces,  pass
              0.0.0.0 for the host portion.

              Using  this  switch  without using the <u>udp-auth</u> option is not recommended, and is a major security
              risk (especially when passing 0.0.0.0)!  Anyone at all may connect to this port  and  access  your
              session.   UDP  sessions are trivial to hijack for anyone able to sniff even just a single packet,
              it should only be used in very specific use-cases, and never over unsecured networks.

       <b>--bind-ws</b>=<u>[HOST]:PORT</u>
              Create an HTTP / Websocket listener.  See <b>bind-tcp</b> for host restrictions, you should use the <b>auth-</b>
              <b>ws</b> to secure access.

       <b>--bind-wss</b>=<u>[HOST]:PORT</u>
              Create an HTTPS / Secure Websocket listener.  See <b>bind-tcp</b> for host restrictions, you  should  use
              the <b>auth-wss</b> to secure access.

       <b>--bind-ssl</b>=<u>[HOST]:PORT</u>
              Just like --bind-tcp but for SSL sockets.  See <u>ssl-auth</u> and the other SSL options.

       <b>--bind-rfb</b>=<u>[HOST]:PORT</u>
              Listens  for  RFB connections on the given port.  These sockets are only supported with the <b>start-</b>
              <b>desktop</b> and <b>shadow</b> modes.

       <b>--bind-vsock</b>=<u>CID:PORT</u>
              Create a VSOCK socket for each <b>--bind-vsock</b> option specified.

       <b>--auth</b>=<u>MODULE[:OPTION=VALUE]</u>
              Specifies the authentication module to use for unix domain sockets created using the <b>bind</b>  switch.
              Authentication modules can validate a username and password against a variety of backend modules:

              <b>allow</b>  always allows authentication - this is dangerous and should only be used for testing

              <b>fail</b>   always fails authentication, useful for testing

              <b>env</b>    matches  against  the  environment variable specified by the <u>name</u> option (which defaults to
                     <b>XPRA_PASSWORD</b>).  ie: <b>--auth=env:name=SOME_OTHER_ENV_VAR_NAME</b>.

              <b>password</b>
                     matches   against   the   password    specified    using    the    <u>value</u>    option.     ie:
                     <b>--auth=password:value=YOURPASSWORD</b>.  Note: this command line option may be exposed to other
                     processes on the same system.

              <b>file</b>   checks  the  password  against  the  password  data  found  in the file specified using the
                     <b>filename</b> option.  ie: <b>--auth=file:filename=./password.txt</b>.

                     The contents of this file will be treated as binary data,  there  are  no  restrictions  on
                     character  encodings  or  file  size.   Beware of trailing newline characters which will be
                     included in the password data.

              <b>multifile</b>
                     checks the username and password against the file specified using the filename option.  The
                     file must contain each user credentials on one line of the form:

                     <u>username|password|uid|gid|displays|env_opts|session_opts</u>

                     It is not possible to have usernames or password that contain the pipe character <u>|</u> which is
                     used as delimiter, or newlines and carriage returns.  This  module  is  deprecated,  <u>sqlite</u>
                     should be used instead.

              <b>sqlite</b>

              <b>mysql</b>

              <b>sql</b>    checks  the  username  and  password  against  the sqlite database file specified using the
                     <u>filename</u> option (for the <u>sqlite</u> backend), or the database specified using  the  <u>uri</u>  option
                     (<u>mysql</u>  and  <u>sql</u> backends).  The authentication will be processed using the following query
                     (which is configurable using the <u>password_query</u> option): <u>SELECT</u> <u>password</u> <u>FROM</u>  <u>users</u>  <u>WHERE</u>
                     <u>username=(?)</u>   The  sessions  available  for  each  user  will  be  queried using: (this is
                     configurable using the <u>sessions_query</u> option):  <u>SELECT</u>  <u>uid,</u>  <u>gid,</u>  <u>displays,</u>  <u>env_options,</u>
                     <u>session_options</u>  <u>FROM</u>  <u>users</u>  <u>WHERE</u>  <u>username=(?)</u>   Multiple displays may be specified as a
                     comma separated list.

              <b>hosts</b>  checks the host using the system's <u>tcp-wrappers</u> library.  (Posix only, and not available on
                     Mac OS) See <u>hosts.allow</u> and <u>hosts.deny</u> for details.

              <b>exec</b>   Executes the command specified using the <u>command</u> attribute, the arguments to  this  command
                     are:  a description of the access request and the <u>timeout</u> value. (also configurable) If the
                     command is not specified, the system will try to locate and  use  the  <u>auth_dialog</u>  utility
                     which  is  shipped with xpra.  The command should return 0 to allow access, any other value
                     will deny access.

              <b>peercred</b>
                     checks the unix domain socket peer  credentials  using  <u>SO_PEERCRED</u>.   This  authentication
                     module is only available on some Posix compliant operating systems. This module will verify
                     that  the  operating  system  provides  the  uid  and gid of the process that initiated the
                     connection.  Access can be restricted by supplying a colon separated list of valid <u>uid</u>s and
                     <u>gid</u>s that are allowed to connect.  Those id values may be specified using numerical  values
                     or  using the usernames / group names.  This module is different from the others in that it
                     will not require the client to supply  a  username  or  password,  as  those  are  ignored.
                     Environment  variables  and  pseudo-environment  variables  may also be used as values, eg:
                     <b>--auth=peercred:uid=\$UID:fred,gid=xpra</b>.

              <b>pam</b>    validates the username and password using the PAM system

              <b>win32</b>  validates the username and password using Microsoft Windows authentication (only  available
                     on this platform)

              <b>sys</b>    chooses the appropriate system authentication module automatically (either <b>pam</b> or <b>win32</b>)

              <b>kerberos-password</b>
                     validates  the  username  and password using kerberos authentication.  Warning: this module
                     does not use kerberos tickets and the password will be sent in plain text  to  the  server.
                     This should only be used for testing.

              <b>kerberos-ticket</b>
                     validates a kerberos ticket obtained by the client.

              <b>gss</b>    validates a GSS ticket obtained by the client.

              <b>u2f</b>    requests a U2F token from the client.

              <b>ldap</b>   validates the username and password against an LDAP server, using the <u>python-ldap</u> library.

              <b>ldap3</b>  validates the username and password against an LDAP server, using the python <u>ldap3</u> library.

       <b>--tcp-auth</b>=<u>MODULE</u>
              Just  like the <b>auth</b> switch, except this one only applies to TCP sockets (sockets defined using the
              <b>bind-tcp</b> switch).

       <b>--udp-auth</b>=<u>MODULE</u>
              Just like the <b>tcp-auth</b> switch, except this one only applies to UDP sockets (sockets defined  using
              the <b>bind-udp</b> switch).

       <b>--ws-auth</b>=<u>MODULE</u>
              Just  like  the <b>auth</b> switch, except this one only applies to ws sockets: sockets defined using the
              <b>bind-ws</b> switch, or TCP sockets upgraded to websockets. (if the <b>html</b> option is enabled).

       <b>--wss-auth</b>=<u>MODULE</u>
              Just like the <b>auth</b> switch, except this one only applies to wss sockets: sockets defined using  the
              <b>bind-wss</b> switch, ws sockets upgraded to SSL (if the <b>ssl</b> option is enabled) or TCP sockets upgraded
              to SSL and then to wss.  (if both the <b>ssl</b> and <b>html</b> options are enabled).

       <b>--ssl-auth</b>=<u>MODULE</u>
              Just  like the <b>auth</b> switch, except this one only applies to SSL sockets: sockets defined using the
              <b>bind-ssl</b> switch, or TCP sockets upgraded by <b>ssl=auto</b> or <b>ssl=on</b>.

       <b>--rfb-auth</b>=<u>MODULE</u>
              Authentication module to use for the <b>bind-rfb</b> sockets.

       <b>--vsock-auth</b>=<u>MODULE</u>
              Just like the <b>auth</b> switch, except this one only applies to VSOCK sockets  (sockets  defined  using
              the <b>bind-vsock</b> switch).

       <b>--challenge-handlers</b>=<u>MODULE:options</u>
              Configures  which challenge handlers are used by the client and in which order. This option may be
              repeated to specify multiple handlers, which can be useful if  the  server  sends  more  than  one
              authentication    challenge.     The    default    value    is:    <u>all</u>   which   corresponds   to:
              <u>uri,file,env,kerberos,gss,u2f,prompt</u>.

              <b>uri</b>    Use the password specified on the connection string, if any.

              <b>file</b>   The filename used to store the password can be specified using  the  <u>filename</u>  option.   If
                     this  option  is  not  specified, it will fallback to using the password filename specified
                     with the <u>password-file</u> switch.

              <b>env</b>    Use the password specified using the environment variable specified using the <u>name</u>  option,
                     which defaults to <u>XPRA_PASSWORD</u> if unspecified.

              <b>u2f</b>    Requests a token from a U2F device.

              <b>prompt</b> Prompt the user for the value.  Terminal clients prompt using text input, GUI clients use a
                     dialog.

       <b>--min-port</b>=<u>PORT</u>
              The  minimum  port number allowed when creating UDP and TCP sockets.  You can use a lower value to
              allow unprivileged users to bind to privileged ports when starting sessions via  the  system  wide
              proxy server.  The default value is 1024 which is the standard value for privileged ports.

       <b>--mdns</b>=<u>yes</u>|<u>no</u>
              Enable or disable the publication of new sessions via mDNS.

       <b>--dbus-launch</b>=<u>COMMAND</u>|<u>no</u>
              Start the session within a dbus-launch context, you can specify the dbus launch command to use, or
              turn it off completely.  Some features may not be available without a dbus context.

       <b>--dbus-proxy</b>=<u>yes</u>|<u>no</u>
              Allows the client to forward dbus calls to the server.

       <b>--dbus-control</b>=<u>yes</u>|<u>no</u>
              Start a dbus server which can be used to interact with the server process.

   <b>Options</b> <b>for</b> <b>start,</b> <b>start-desktop,</b> <b>upgrade</b>
       <b>--exec-wrapper</b>=<u>CMD</u>
              A  wrapper command which is prepended to all start commands.  Typically, this is used for starting
              all sub-commands via VirtualGL.

       <b>--start</b>=<u>CMD</u>
              After starting the server, runs the command <u>CMD</u> using the default shell.  The command is run  with
              its <b>$DISPLAY</b> set to point to the newly-started server.  This option may be given multiple times to
              start multiple commands.

       <b>--start-child</b>=<u>CMD</u>
              Identical to <b>--start</b>, except that the commands are taken into account by <b>--exit-with-children</b>.

       <b>--start-after-connect</b>=<u>CMD</u>
              Wait for the first client to connect before starting the command.

       <b>--start-child-after-connect</b>=<u>CMD</u>
              Wait for the first client to connect before starting the child command.  See <u>start-child</u>.

       <b>--start-on-connect</b>=<u>CMD</u>
              Execute this command every time a client connects.

       <b>--start-child-on-connect</b>=<u>CMD</u>
              Execute this child command every time a client connects.  See <u>start-child</u>.

       <b>--start-on-last-client-exit</b>=<u>CMD</u>
              Execute this command every time a client disconnects and there are no other clients left.

       <b>--start-child-on-last-client-exit</b>=<u>CMD</u>
              Execute  this  child  command every time a client disconnects and there are no other clients left.
              See <u>start-child</u>.

       <b>--terminate-children</b>=<u>yes</u>|<u>no</u>
              On server <b>stop</b>, terminate all the child commands that have been started by the server.  This  does
              not  affect  server <b>exit</b>.  Most child commands are tied to the display so they are normally forced
              to shutdown anyway, but this gives them more time to cleanup properly and  can  be  used  to  stop
              background commands that aren't tied to a display.

       <b>--exit-with-children</b>=<u>yes</u>|<u>no</u>
              This option may only be used if <b>--start-child</b> is also given.  If it is given, then the xpra server
              will monitor the status of the children started by <b>--start-child</b>, and will automatically terminate
              itself when the last of them has exited.

       <b>--exit-with-client</b>=<u>yes</u>|<u>no</u>
              The server will terminate when the last client disconnects.

       <b>--env</b>=<u>KEY=VALUE</u>
              Extra  environment  variables  which will only affect commands started using fB--start or <b>--start-</b>
              <b>child</b>.

       <b>--start-new-commands</b>=<u>yes</u>|<u>no</u>
              Allow clients to ask the server to execute new commands.  (this can also be used via  the  control
              channel)

       <b>--start-via-proxy</b>=<u>yes</u>|<u>no</u>|<u>auto</u>
              If  enabled,  the  <b>start</b>  and <b>start-desktop</b> subcommands will be delegated to the system wide proxy
              server instance.  With <u>auto</u> mode, this delegation will only occur if the system wide proxy  server
              is found.

       <b>--systemd-run</b>=<u>yes</u>|<u>no</u>|<u>auto</u>
              Wrap server start commands with systemd-run.

       <b>--systemd-run-args</b>=<u>ARGS</u>
              Command line arguments passed to systemd-run.

       <b>--use-display</b>
              Use  an existing display rather than starting one with xvfb.  You are responsible for starting the
              display yourself.  This can also be used to rescue an existing display whose xpra server  instance
              crashed or for running xpra against an accelerated X11 server.

       <b>--displayfd</b>=<u>FD</u>
              The xpra server will write the display number back on this file descriptor as a newline-terminated
              string.   This  is  most  useful  when  the display number is not specified with the xpra <u>start</u> or
              <u>start-desktop</u> subcommands.

       <b>--xvfb</b>=<u>CMD</u>
              When starting a seamless server, xpra starts a virtual X server to run the clients  on.   If  your
              Xvfb  is  installed in a funny location, or you want to use some other virtual X server, then this
              switch allows you to specify how to run your preferred X server  executable.   The  default  value
              used depends on your platform.  For more information, see: https://xpra.org/Xdummy.html

       <b>--sync-xvfb</b>=<u>DELAY</u>
              The  windows  are  normally  only  displayed on the client(s), they are not painted on the virtual
              display.  Some applications like screen recorders may want to capture the window contents, you can
              use this option to enable painting with a configurable delay  (in  milliseconds).   Warning:  this
              extra painting is expensive and quite slow, which is why it is not enabled by default.

       <b>--attach</b>=<u>yes</u>|<u>no</u>|<u>auto</u>
              Once the server has started, immediately connect a client to it.  With the value <b>auto</b>, a client is
              started for remote servers only. (servers specified via a network URI)

   <b>Options</b> <b>for</b> <b>start,</b> <b>start-desktop,</b> <b>upgrade,</b> <b>shadow</b>
       <b>--tcp-proxy</b>=<u>HOST:PORT</u>
              Specifies  the address to which non-xpra packets will be forwarded.  This can be used to share the
              same TCP port with another TCP servers, usually a web server.  xpra clients will connect as usual,
              but any client that does not speak the xpra protocol will be forwarded to the alternative server.

       <b>--html</b>=<u>on</u>|<u>off</u>|<u>auto</u>|<u>webrootpath</u>
              Respond to HTTP requests on the TCP port(s) and local sockets.  This requires at least one TCP  or
              local  socket  to be configured using the matching <b>bind</b> option.  The <b>auto</b> mode will enable support
              if possible.  By default the server will provide access to the HTML5 client.  You can also specify
              your own web root path as argument.

       <b>--rfb-upgrade</b>=<u>DELAY</u>
              Allows RFB clients (ie: VNC) to connect to a plain TCP socket.  If no data is received after <u>DELAY</u>
              seconds, the server will send a RFB handshake.  This option is only applicable to servers  started
              in <u>start-desktop</u> or <u>shadow</u> modes.

       <b>--video-encoders</b>=<u>ENCODERS</u>
              Specifies the video encoders to try to load.  By default, all of them are loaded, but one may want
              to  specify  a  more  restrictive list of encoders.  Use the special value 'help' to get a list of
              options.  Use the value 'none' to not load any video encoders.

       <b>--csc-modules</b>=<u>MODULES</u>
              Specifies the colourspace conversion modules to try to load.  By default, all of them are  loaded,
              but  one  may want to specify a more restrictive list of modules.  Use the special value 'help' to
              get a list of options.  Use the value 'none' to not load any colourspace conversion modules.

       <b>--socket-permissions</b>=<u>ACCESS-MODE</u>
              Specifies the file permissions on the server's unix domain sockets.   Defaults  to  600.  This  is
              ignored when <u>mmap-group</u> is enabled.

   <b>Options</b> <b>for</b> <b>start,</b> <b>start-desktop,</b> <b>upgrade</b> <b>and</b> <b>attach</b>
       <b>--encryption</b>=<u>CIPHER</u>
              Specifies  the  cipher  to use for securing the connection from prying eyes.  This option requires
              the use of the <b>--encryption-keyfile</b> option.  The only cipher supported at present is <u>AES</u>,  if  the
              client  requests  encryption  it  will be used by both the client and server for all communication
              after the initial password verification, but only if the server supports this feature too.   Note:
              this  feature has not been extensively reviewed and as it is it should not be considered safe from
              determined attackers.

       <b>--tcp-encryption</b>=<u>CIPHER</u>
              Just like the <b>encryption</b> switch, except this one only applies  to  TCP  sockets  (sockets  defined
              using the <b>bind-tcp</b> switch).

       <b>--encryption-keyfile</b>=<u>FILENAME</u>
              Specifies  the  key to use with the encryption cipher specified with <b>--encryption</b>.  The client and
              server must use the same keyfile contents.

       <b>--tcp-encryption-keyfile</b>=<u>FILENAME</u>
              Just like the <b>encryption-keyfile</b> switch, except this one only  applies  to  TCP  sockets  (sockets
              defined using the <b>bind-tcp</b> switch).

       <b>--idle-timeout</b>=<u>IDLETIMEOUT</u>
              The  connection  will be terminated if there is no user activity (mouse clicks or key presses) for
              the given amount of time (in seconds). Use the value 0 to disable this timeout.

       <b>--server-idle-timeout</b>=<u>IDLETIMEOUT</u>
              The server will exit if there are no active connections for the given amount of time (in seconds).
              Use the value 0 to disable this timeout.

       <b>--clipboard-filter-file</b>=<u>FILENAME</u>
              Name of a file containing regular expressions, any  clipboard  data  that  matches  one  of  these
              regular  expressions  will  be  dropped.   Note:  at present this only applies to copying from the
              machine where this option is used, not to it.

       <b>--dpi</b>=<u>VALUE</u>
              The 'dots per inch' value that client applications should  try  to  honour.   This  numeric  value
              should  be  in the range 10 to 500 to be useful.  Many applications will only read this value when
              starting up, so connecting to an existing session started with a different DPI value may not  have
              the desired effect.

       <b>--pixel-depth</b>=<u>VALUE</u>
              When  starting  a  server,  this  switch  controls  the bits per pixel of the virtual framebuffer.
              Possible values: 0 (auto), 16, 24, 30.  When starting a client, this switch controls  the  picture
              rendering  with  the  opengl  backend:  values higher than 24 will enable deep color, the value 24
              enables regular true color rendering. Use the value 0 to let the client decide  if  the  rendering
              will  benefit  from  using deep color. (this is only supported on some Posix clients) Other values
              should not be used.

       <b>--cursors</b>=<u>yes</u>|<u>no</u>
              Enable or disable forwarding of custom application mouse cursors.  Client applications may  change
              the  mouse  cursor  at any time, which will cause the new cursor's pixels to be sent to the client
              each time.  This disables the feature.

       <b>--notifications</b>=<u>yes</u>|<u>no</u>
              Enable or disable forwarding of system  notifications.   System  notifications  require  the  xpra
              server  to  have  its own instance of a dbus daemon, if it is missing a warning will be printed on
              startup.  This switch disables the feature entirely, and avoids the warning.

       <b>--input-method</b>=<u>METHOD</u>
              Specify which input method to configure.  This sets a number of environment variables which should
              be honoured by applications started with the <b>start-child</b> option.

              The following <u>METHOD</u>s are currently supported:

              <b>none</b>   Disable input methods completely and prevent it from interfering with keyboard input.  This
                     is the default.

              <b>keep</b>   Keeps the environment unchanged. You are responsible for ensuring it is correct.

              <b>xim</b>    Enables the X Input Method.

              <b>IBus</b>   Enables the Intelligent Input Bus.

              <b>SCIM</b>   Enables the Smart Common Input Method.

              <b>uim</b>    Enables the Universal Input Method.

       Any other value will also be set up, but will trigger a warning.

       <b>--xsettings</b>=<u>yes</u>|<u>no</u>
              Enable  or  disable  xsettings  synchronization.   Xsettings are only forwarded from posix clients
              connecting to real posix servers (not shadows).

       <b>--system-tray</b>=<u>yes</u>|<u>no</u>
              Enable or disable forwarding of system tray icons.  This feature requires client support  and  may
              not be available on all platforms.

       <b>--bell</b>=<u>yes</u>|<u>no</u>
              Enable or disable forwarding of the system bell.

       <b>--webcam</b>=<u>yes</u>|<u>no</u>
              Enable or disable webcam forwarding.

       <b>--mousewheel</b>=<u>on</u>|<u>off</u>|<u>invert</u>|<u>invert-x</u>|<u>invert-y</u>|<u>invert-z</u>
              Mouse wheel handling: can be used to disable mouse wheel forwarding or to invert some or all axes.

       <b>--remote-logging</b>=<u>yes</u>|<u>no</u>|<u>both</u>
              Allow  the  client to forward its log output to the server.  The client can specify the value <u>both</u>
              to both send it to the server and keep it locally.

       <b>--av-sync</b>=<u>yes</u>|<u>no</u>
              Enable or disable audio-video synchronization.  The video data will  be  delayed  so  that  it  is
              displayed  in sync with the audio.  Note: this only applies to video regions, either auto-detected
              via the builtin heuristics or specified using the dbus interface.

   <b>Options</b> <b>for</b> <b>attach</b>
       <b>--modal-windows</b>=<u>yes</u>|<u>no</u>
              Honour modal windows.  This may have undesirable  side  effects  when  multiple  applications  are
              forwarded  through the same xpra server: modal windows will be made modal for all the applications
              forwarded by xpra rather than just the one application which owns that window.

       <b>--password-file</b>=<u>FILENAME</u>
              Supply the password to be used for connecting to a server that uses authentication. See <u>auth</u>, <u>tcp-</u>
              <u>auth</u>, <u>ssl-auth</u>  and  <u>vsock-auth</u>  for  details.   Alternatively,  you  may  use  the  <u>XPRA_PASSWORD</u>
              environment variable.

       <b>--opengl</b>=(<u>yes</u>|<u>no</u>|<u>auto</u>)[:<u>backend</u>]
              Use OpenGL accelerated rendering on the client.  The default is to detect if the graphics card and
              drivers are supported (<u>auto</u> mode), but one can also disable OpenGL (<u>no</u>) or force it enabled (<u>yes</u>).
              On  some  platforms,  it  is  also possible to specify which backends should be used, only <u>gtk</u> and
              <u>native</u>  are  currently  supported  and  only  on  X11  platforms.    ie:   <u>opengl=yes:native</u>,   or
              <u>opengl=auto:gtk,native</u>.

       <b>--webcam</b>=<u>yes</u>|<u>no</u>|<u>/dev/deviceXXX</u>|<u>DEVICEID</u>
              Enable or disable webcam forwarding.  The webcam device to use can also be specified.

       <b>-z</b><u>LEVEL</u>, <b>--compress</b>=<u>LEVEL</u>
              Select  the  level of compression xpra will use when transmitting data over the network.  With the
              <b>lz4</b> and <b>lzo</b> compressors, there are only two possible values: 0  (meaning  no  compression)  and  1
              (compression enabled).  The <b>zlib</b> compressor supports values between 0 (meaning no compression) and
              9, inclusive. It should only be used when <b>lz4</b> and <b>lzo</b> are not available.

              This compression is not used on pixel data (except when using the <b>rgb</b> encoding).

       <b>--quality</b>=<u>VALUE</u>
              This  option sets a fixed image compression quality for lossy encodings (<b>jpeg</b>, <b>webp</b>, <b>h264</b>/<b>h265</b> and
              <b>vp8</b>/<b>vp9</b>).  First, one of those lossy encodings must be enabled with <b>--encoding</b>.  Values range from
              1  (lowest  quality,  high  compression  -  generally  unusable)  to  100  (highest  quality,  low
              compression).   Specify  a value of zero to let the system tune the quality dynamically to achieve
              the best bandwidth usage possible.  It is usually best not to use this option and use  <b>min-quality</b>
              instead.

       <b>--min-quality</b>=<u>MIN-QUALITY</u>
              This  option sets the minimum encoding quality allowed when the quality option is set to automatic
              mode.

       <b>--speed</b>=<u>SPEED</u>
              This option sets the encoding speed.  Slower compresses more, faster  will  give  better  latency.
              The  system  normally  uses  a variable speed, this option forces a fixed speed setting to be used
              instead.  It is usually best not to use this option and use <b>min-speed</b> instead.

       <b>--min-speed</b>=<u>MIN-SPEED</u>
              This option sets the minimum encoding speed allowed when the speed  option  is  set  to  automatic
              mode.

       <b>--auto-refresh-delay</b>=<u>DELAY</u>
              This  option  sets  a  delay  after which the windows are automatically refreshed using a lossless
              frame.  The delay is a floating-point number and is in seconds.  This option is enabled by default
              with a delay of 0.25 seconds.  This option is only relevant when using a lossy encoding.

       <b>--shortcut-modifiers</b>=<u>MODIFIERS</u>
              Defines the default shortcut modifiers required by the <u>key-shortcuts</u>, these modifiers can then  be
              referred to as <u>#</u>.  The default value is 'auto' which evaluates to <u>Meta+Shift</u> on most platforms.

       <b>--key-shortcut</b>=<u>KEY:ACTION</u>
              Can  be  specified multiple times to add multiple key shortcuts.  These keys will be caught by the
              client and trigger the action specified and the key presses will not be passed on to the server.

              The <u>KEY</u> specification may include keyboard modifiers in the  form  <b>[modifier+]*key</b>,  for  example:
              <u>Shift+F10</u>  or  <u>Shift+Control+B</u>.   You  can refer to the <u>shorcut-modifers</u> option value using <u>#</u>, ie:
              <u>#+F1</u>.

              If no shortcuts are defined on the command line, the default builtin list will be used.

              Some of the actions may allow arguments (ie:  the  <u>log</u>  action  does),  in  which  case  they  are
              specified in the usual programming style syntax: <u>ACTION(ARG1,</u> <u>ARG2,</u> <u>etc)</u>
              String  arguments  must  be  quoted  (both  single  and  double  quotes are supported) and numeric
              arguments must not be quoted.  Beware the the parenthesis and quotes must usually be escaped  when
              used from a shell command line.  Example: <u>--key-shortcut=Meta+Shift+F7:log\(\'hello\'\)</u>

              The following <u>ACTION</u>s are currently defined:

              <b>quit</b>   Disconnect the xpra client.

              <b>log("MESSAGE")</b>
                     Sends <u>MESSAGE</u> to the log.

              <b>show_session_info[("TabName")]</b>
                     Shows the session information window. The optional <u>TabName</u> allows the information tab shown
                     to be selected. Use the value <u>help</u> to get the list of options.

              <b>show_menu</b>
                     Shows the menu normally found in the system tray.

              <b>show_start_new_command</b>
                     Shows the start new command dialog.

              <b>magic_key</b>
                     Placeholder which can be used by some client toolkits.

              <b>void</b>   Does  not  do  anything, and can therefore be used to prevent certain key combinations from
                     ever being sent to the server.

              <b>refresh_window</b>
                     Force the currently focused window to be refreshed.

              <b>refresh_all_windows</b>
                     Force all windows to be refreshed.

              <b>toggle_keyboard_grab</b>
                     The keyboard will be grabbed / ungrabbed by the current window.

              <b>toggle_pointer_grab</b>
                     The pointer will be grabbed and confined to the current window.

              <b>toggle_fullscreen</b>
                     Make the current window fullscreen / unfullscreen.

              <b>toggle_debug</b>
                     Turn debugging on or off.

              <b>scaleup</b>
                     Increase the current value of <b>desktop-scaling</b>.

              <b>scaledown</b>
                     Decrease the current value of <b>desktop-scaling</b>.

              <b>scalereset</b>
                     Reset the <b>desktop-scaling</b> to its original value.

              <b>scalingoff</b>
                     Turn off <b>desktop-scaling</b>.

              <b>increase_quality</b>
                     Increase the <b>min-quality</b> or <b>quality</b> setting (whichever one is currently in use).

              <b>decrease_quality</b>
                     Decrease the <b>min-quality</b> or <b>quality</b> setting (whichever one is currently in use).

              <b>increase_speed</b>
                     Increase the <b>min-speed</b> or <b>speed</b> setting (whichever one is currently in use).

              <b>decrease_speed</b>
                     Decrease the <b>min-speed</b> or <b>speed</b> setting (whichever one is currently in use).

       <b>--sharing</b>=<u>yes</u>|<u>no</u>|<u>auto</u>
              Sharing allows more than one client to connect to the same session.  This must be enabled on  both
              the  server  and  all  co-operating clients to function.  When used server-side, the default value
              <u>auto</u> allows the clients to decide if they are willing to share the  session.   When  used  client-
              side,  the  default value <u>auto</u> evaluates to <u>no</u>.  To allow sharing to work with unix domain sockets
              (either using local connections or via ssh), you should create at least  one  socket  in  a  group
              accessible  directory.  On  Posix  with  a default configuration, being a member of the <u>xpra</u> group
              should be enough to create a socket in <u>/run/xpra</u>. You must also ensure  that  the  permissions  of
              this socket file allow group access, see <u>socket-permissions</u>.

       <b>--lock</b>=<u>yes</u>|<u>no</u>|<u>auto</u>
              Locking allows a client to refuse to hand over the session to a new client.  The session may still
              be shared with multiple clients (see the <u>sharing</u> option), but otherwise the server will reject new
              clients.   When used server-side, the default value <u>auto</u> allows the clients to decide if they want
              to lock the session.  When used client-side, the default value <u>auto</u> evaluates to <u>no</u>.

       <b>--keyboard-sync</b>=<u>yes</u>|<u>no</u>
              Normally the key presses and key release events are sent to the server as they occur so  that  the
              server  can maintain a consistent keyboard state.  Disabling synchronization can prevent keys from
              repeating unexpectedly on high latency links but it may also disrupt applications which access the
              keyboard directly (games, etc.).

       <b>--keyboard-raw</b>=<u>yes</u>|<u>no</u>
              Tells the server to process all keyboard input untranslated.  Both the client and the server  must
              be using the same type of keyboard interface. (ie: both using X11)

       <b>--keyboard-layout</b>=<u>LAYOUTSTRING</u>
              The keyboard layout is normally detected automatically.  This option overrides it.

       <b>--keyboard-layouts</b>=<u>LAYOUTS</u>
              The list of keyboard layouts to enable.

       <b>--keyboard-variant</b>=<u>VARIANT</u>
              Override for the keyboard layout variant.

       <b>--keyboard-variants</b>=<u>VARIANTS</u>
              Override for the keyboard layout variants.

       <b>--keyboard-options</b>=<u>OPTIONS</u>
              Override for the keyboard options sent to the server.

       <b>--swap-keys</b>=<u>YES|NO</u>
              This option only applies to MacOS clients, it swaps the <u>command</u> and <u>control</u> keys and is enabled by
              default.

       <b>--sound-source</b>=<u>PLUGIN</u>
              Specifies  the  GStreamer sound plugin used for capturing the sound stream.  This affects "speaker
              forwarding" on the server, and "microphone" forwarding on the client.  To get a  list  of  options
              use  the  special  value  'help'.   It  is also possible to specify plugin options using the form:
              <u>--sound-source=</u> <u>pulsedevice=device.alsa_input.pci-0000_00_14.2.analog-stereo</u>

       <b>--speaker</b>=<u>on</u>|<u>off</u>|<u>disabled</u> and <b>--microphone</b>=<u>on</u>|<u>off</u>|<u>disabled</u>|<u>on:DEVICE</u>|<u>off:DEVICE</u>
              Sound input and output forwarding support: <u>on</u> will start the forwarding as soon as the  connection
              is established, <u>off</u> will require the user to enable it via the menu, <u>disabled</u> will prevent it from
              being  used and the menu entry will be disabled.  With microphone forwarding, you may also be able
              to specify which device to use.

       <b>--speaker-codec</b>=<u>CODEC</u> and <b>--microphone-codec</b>=<u>CODEC</u>
              Specify the codec(s) to use for sound output (speaker) or input (microphone).  This parameter  can
              be  specified multiple times and the order in which the codecs are specified defines the preferred
              codec order.  Use the special value 'help' to get a list of options.  When  unspecified,  all  the
              available codecs are allowed and the first one is used.

       <b>--title</b>=<u>VALUE</u>
              Sets  the  text  shown  as  window  title.   The  string  supplied can make use of remote metadata
              placeholders which will be populated at runtime with the  values  from  the  remote  server.   The
              default value used is "@title@ on @client-machine@".

              The following placeholders are defined:

              <b>@title@</b>
                     Will be replaced by the remote window's title.

              <b>@client-machine@</b>
                     Will  be  replaced  by  the  hostname  of  the  system where the application is running, if
                     provided, the xpra server's hostname otherwise.

              <b>@server-machine@</b>
                     Will be replaced by the hostname of the xpra server.

              <b>@server-display@</b>
                     Will be replaced by the name of the display on which the application is running.

       <b>--border</b>=<u>BORDER</u>
              Specifies the color and size of the border to draw inside every xpra window.  This can be used  to
              easily  distinguish  xpra  windows  running on remote hosts from local windows.  The <u>BORDER</u> can be
              specified using standard color names (ie: <u>red</u>, or <u>orange</u>) or using the web hexadecimal syntax (ie:
              <u>#F00</u> or <u>#FF8C00</u>). The special color name "<u>auto</u>" will derive  the  color  from  the  server  target
              address  (the connection string) so that connecting to the same target should always give the same
              color.  You may also specify the size of the border in pixels, ie: <u>--border</u>=<u>yellow,10</u>.

       <b>--window-icon</b>=<u>FILENAME</u>
              Path to the default image which will be used for all windows.  This  icon  may  be  shown  in  the
              window's  bar,  its  iconified state or task switchers.  This depends on the operating system, the
              window manage and the application may override this too.

       <b>--window-close</b>=<u>ACTION</u>
              Choose what action to take when the window is closed by the client.  The following actions can  be
              used:

              <b>auto</b>   The  client  will  figure  out what is best based on the window type.  This is the default.
                     ie: it will use <u>disconnect</u> shadow sessions, Iforward <u>for</u> <u>seamless</u> <u>windows.</u>

              <b>forward</b>
                     The event will be forwarded to the server.

              <b>ignore</b> Do nothing.

              <b>disconnect</b>
                     Disconnect from the server.

              <b>shutdown</b>
                     Shutdown the server.

       <b>--desktop-scaling</b>=<u>off</u>|<u>on</u>|<u>auto</u>|<u>VALUE</u>
              Desktop scaling allows the windows to be scaled by the  client.   Downscaling  will  mostly  waste
              bandwidth,  upscaling  allows  the window's pixels to be sent over the wire at a lower resolution,
              saving bandwidth and CPU time.  This option can also be used to request a specific scaling  value.
              For  best  results,  use  <b>opengl</b>  client  rendering,  the  other  display backends may show visual
              artifacts when scaling.  Note: the scaling may  also  be  adjusted  at  runtime  through  keyboard
              shortcuts if those are configured.

              The <u>desktop-scaling</u> value can take the form:

              <b>off</b>    scaling will be disabled

              <b>on</b>     scaling will be allowed, but it will start unscaled

              <b>auto</b>   scaling  will  be  allowed and a scaling value will be automatically chosen if the client's
                     desktop is large (bigger desktops will use higher scaling values)

              <b>scaling-value</b>
                     scaling will be enabled and use the  given  value,  specified  as  a  number,  fraction  or
                     percentage. ie: <b>2</b>, <b>3/2</b> or <b>150%</b>.

              <b>pair</b>   the  scaling  will  be  enabled  and use a different value for the X and Y axis. ie: <b>3x2</b> or
                     <b>3/2x4/3</b>

              <b>desktop-size</b>
                     the scaling will be enabled and the server will render to the given size. ie: <b>1600x1200</b>

       <b>--tray</b>=<u>yes</u>|<u>no</u> Enable or disable the system tray.  Not available on OSX since  the  dock  icon  is  always
       shown.

       <b>--delay-tray</b>
              Waits for the first window or notification to appear before showing the system tray. (posix only)

       <b>--tray-icon</b>=<u>FILENAME</u>
              Specifies  the icon shown in the dock/tray.  By default it uses a simple default 'xpra' icon.  (On
              Microsoft Windows, the icon must be in <b>ico</b> format.)

       <b>--enable-pings</b>
              The client and server will exchange ping and  echo  packets  which  are  used  to  gather  latency
              statistics.  Those statistics can be seen using the <b>xpra</b> <b>info</b> command.

   <b>Options</b> <b>for</b> <b>attach,</b> <b>stop,</b> <b>info,</b> <b>screenshot,</b> <b>version</b>
       <b>--ssh</b>=<u>CMD</u>
              When  you  use  an  <b>ssh:</b>  address  to  connect  to  a remote display, xpra runs <b><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></b>(1) to make the
              underlying connection. By default, it does this by running the command "ssh". If your ssh  program
              is  in  an  unusual  location,  has an unusual name, or you want to pass special options to change
              ssh's behavior, then you can use the <b>--ssh</b> switch to tell xpra how to run ssh.

              For example, if you want to use arcfour encryption, then you should run

                     <b>xpra</b> <b>attach</b> <b>--ssh</b>=<u>"ssh</u> <u>-c</u> <u>arcfour"</u> <u>ssh://frodo/7</u>

              <u>Note:</u> Don't bother to enable ssh compression; this is redundant with xpra's own  compression,  and
              will just waste your CPU.  See also xpra's <b>--compress</b> switch.

              On  MS  Windows,  where  backslashes are used to separate path elements and where spaces are often
              used  as  part  of  paths,  you  need  to  add   quotes   around   paths.   (ie:   <b>ssh="C:\Program</b>
              <b>Files\Xpra\Plink.exe"</b> <b>-ssh</b> <b>-agent</b>)

       <b>--exit-ssh</b>=<u>yes</u>|<u>no</u>
              Choose whether the SSH client process should be forcibly terminated when xpra disconnects from the
              server.   If  you  are using SSH connection sharing, you may want to avoid stopping the SSH master
              process instance spawned by xpra as it may be used by other SSH sessions.  Note:  the  <b>exit-ssh=no</b>
              detaches  the  SSH  process from the terminal which prevents the SSH process from interacting with
              the terminal input, this disables the keyboard interaction required for password input,  host  key
              verification, etc..

       <b>--remote-xpra</b>=<u>CMD</u>
              When  connecting  to  a  remote  server  over  ssh, xpra needs to be able to find and run the xpra
              executable on the remote host.  If this executable is in  a  non-standard  location,  or  requires
              special  environment  variables  to  be set before it can run, then accomplishing this may be non-
              trivial.  If running <b>xpra</b> <b>attach</b> <b>ssh:something</b> fails because it cannot find the remote xpra,  then
              you can use this option to specify how to run xpra on the remote host.

              That  said,  this  option  should  not be needed in normal usage, as xpra tries quite hard to work
              around the above problems.  If you find yourself needing it often, then that may  indicate  a  bug
              that we would appreciate hearing about.

   <b>SSL</b> <b>Options</b>
       <b>--ssl</b>=<u>on</u>|<u>auto</u>|<u>off</u>|<u>tcp</u>|<u>www</u>
              Whether  to enable SSL on TCP sockets and for what purpose.  The TCP sockets will automatically be
              upgraded to SSL when SSL packets are received.

              <b>auto</b>   The server will try to guess what protocol to use  for  each  new  SSL  connection:  either
                     xpra's native protocol or https / websocket (wss)

              <b>tcp</b>    The SSL sockets will only be used for xpra's native protocol

              <b>www</b>    The SSL sockets will only be used for https and websocket (wss)
       If  SSL  is  enabled,  then  a  <b>ssl-cert</b> is required.  Authentication, if required, will use the <b>ssl-auth</b>
       module specified, and fallback to <b>tcp-auth</b> or <b>auth</b> unless the value <u>none</u> is specified.

       The remaining options mirror the Python ssl module attributes.  Please refer to  that  documentation  and
       bear  in  mind  that  configuring  SSL  for  security is not trivial, and definitely not just a matter of
       <u>enabling</u> <u>SSL</u>. See: https://docs.python.org/2/library/ssl.html Some options  may  not  be  available  with
       older versions of Python.

       Summary: <b>--ssl-key</b>=<u>KEYFILE</u> The key file to use.

       <b>--ssl-cert</b>=ERTFILEORDIR
              Certificate file, required for server SSL support.

       <b>--ssl-protocol</b>=PROTOCOLVERSION
              Specifies which version of the SSL protocol to use.

       <b>--ssl-ca-certs</b>=CACERTSFILE
              The  ca_certs  file  contains  a  set of concatenated 'certification authority' certificates. If a
              directory is specified, it should contain the certificates.

       <b>--ssl-ca-data</b>=ERTDATA
              Certificate data.

       <b>--ssl-ciphers</b>=CIPHERS
              Sets the available ciphers, it should be a string in the OpenSSL cipher list format.

       <b>--ssl-client-verify-mode</b>=<u>none</u>|<u>optional</u>|<u>required</u>
              Whether to try to verify the client's certificates and how to behave if verification fails.

       <b>--ssl-server-verify-mode</b>=<u>none</u>|<u>optional</u>|<u>required</u>
              Whether to try to verify the server's certificates and how to behave if verification fails.

       <b>--ssl-verify-flags</b>=<u>FLAGS</u>
              The flags for certificate verification operations.

       <b>--ssl-check-hostname</b>=<u>yes</u>|<u>no</u>
              Whether to match the peer cert's hostname.

       <b>--ssl-options</b>=<u>options</u>
              Set of SSL options enabled on this context.

       <b>ENVIRONMENT</b>

       <b>DISPLAY</b>
              <b>xpra</b> <b>start</b> <b>--start-child</b>=<u>...</u> sets this variable in the environment of the child to  point  to  the
              xpra display.

              <b>xpra</b>  <b>attach</b>,  on  the  other  hand,  uses  this  variable  to  determine which display the remote
              applications should be shown on.

              fIXPRA_PASSWORD <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>with</b> <b>xpra</b> <b>attach</b> <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>password-file</b> <b>option.</b>

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <u>xpra.conf</u> stores default values for most options.  There is  a  global  configuration  file  in  <u><a href="file:/etc">/etc</a></u>  or
       <u><a href="file:/usr/local/etc">/usr/local/etc</a></u>,  and each user may override those defaults by creating the file <u>.xpra/xpra.conf</u>.  You can
       also split the options into multiple files  by  placing  them  in  a  <u>conf.d</u>  directory  with  the  <u>.conf</u>
       extension.   Depending  on  OS and version, xpra uses the directory <u><a href="file:~/.xpra">~/.xpra</a></u> or <u><a href="file:/run/">/run/</a>&lt;uid&gt;/xpra</u> to store a
       number of files.  (The examples below are given for the display <u>:7</u>.)

       <u><a href="file:~/.xpra/">~/.xpra/</a>:7</u>
              The unix domain socket that clients use to contact the xpra server, if  the  system  configuration
              uses this directory.

       <u><a href="file:~/.xpra/">~/.xpra/</a>:7.log</u>
              When  run  in  daemon  mode  (the default), the xpra server directs all output to this file.  This
              includes all debugging output, if debugging is enabled.

       <u><a href="file:~/.xpra/run-xpra">~/.xpra/run-xpra</a></u>
              A shell script that, when run, starts up xpra with the  correct  python  interpreter,  PYTHONPATH,
              PATH,  location of the main xpra script, etc.  Automatically generated by <b>xpra</b> <b>initenv</b>, <b>xpra</b> <b>start</b>
              and used by <b>xpra</b> <b>attach</b> (see also the discussion of <b>--remote-xpra</b>).

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Xpra has no test suite.

       Xpra does not fully handle all aspects of the  X  protocol;  for  instance,  fancy  input  features  like
       pressure-sensitivity  on tablets, some window manager hints, and probably other more obscure parts of the
       X protocol.  It does, however, degrade gracefully, and patches  for  each  feature  would  be  gratefully
       accepted.

       The  xpra  server  allocates  an over-large framebuffer when using Xvfb; this wastes memory.  If the Xvfb
       does not support RandR this can also cause applications to misbehave  (e.g.  by  letting  menus  go  off-
       screen). This is not a problem when using Xdummy, see the <b>--xvfb</b>= switch for details.  Conversely, if the
       framebuffer  is  ever insufficiently large, clients will misbehave in other ways (e.g., input events will
       be misdirected).
