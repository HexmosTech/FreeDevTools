</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       flist, flists - list the number of nmh messages in given sequences

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>

       <b>flist</b> [<b>-help</b>] [<b>-version</b>] [<u>+folder1</u> [<u>+folder2</u> ...]]  [<b>-sequence</b> <u>name1</u> [<b>-sequence</b> <u>name2</u> ...]]  [<b>-all</b> |
            <b>-noall</b>] [<b>-showzero</b> | <b>-noshowzero</b>] [<b>-recurse</b> | <b>-norecurse</b>] [<b>-fast</b> | <b>-nofast</b>] [<b>-alpha</b> | <b>-noalpha</b>]

       <b>flists</b> is equivalent to <b>flist</b> <b>-all</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>flist</b> is used to search a list of folders and display the number of messages in these folders that are in
       a  given  sequence or set of sequences (for example the “<u>unseen</u>” sequence).  This is especially useful if
       you use some mechanism such as <b>slocal</b> or <b>procmail</b> (typically in conjunction with  <b>rcvstore</b>)  to  pre-sort
       your mail into different folders before you view it.

       By default, the command <b>flist</b> will search the current folder for the given sequence or sequences (usually
       “<u>unseen</u>”).  If (possibly multiple) folders are specified on the command line with <u>+folder</u>, then all these
       folders  are searched for the given sequence(s).  <b>flist</b> will display for each folder searched, the number
       of messages in each of the specified sequences, and the total number of messages.

       The <b>-sequence</b> switch specifies the sequence to which messages should belong.  This switch  may  be  given
       multiple  times to specify multiple sequences.  If it is not given, then the default is to search for all
       the sequences specified by the “<u>Unseen-Sequence</u>” profile component.  For more  details  about  sequences,
       read <u><a href="../man5/mh-sequence.5.html">mh-sequence</a></u>(5).

       Typically,  <b>flist</b>  will  produce  a line for each sequence, for every folder that is searched, even those
       which do not contain any messages in the given sequence.  Specifying  <b>-noshowzero</b>  will  cause  <b>flist</b>  to
       print  only  those folder/sequence combinations where the folder has a non-zero number of messages in the
       given sequence.

       If <b>-recurse</b> is given, then for each folder that is searched, <b>flist</b> will  also  recursively  descend  into
       those folders to search subfolders for the given sequence.

       If  <b>-fast</b> is given, only the names of the folders searched will be displayed, and <b>flist</b> will suppress all
       other output.  If this option is used in conjunction with <b>-noshowzero</b>, then <b>flist</b>  will  only  print  the
       names of those folders searched that contain messages in in at least one of the specified sequences.

   <b>Multiple</b> <b>Folders</b>
       If  the  <b>-all</b> switch is given (and no folders are specified with <u>+folder</u>), then <b>flist</b> will search all the
       folders in the top level of the users nmh directory.  These folders are all  preceded  by  the  read-only
       folders, which occur as “<u>atr-cur-</u>” entries in the user's <b>nmh</b> context.

       An example of the output of <b>flist</b> <b>-all</b> is:

            /work/Mail  has  5 in sequence unseen (private); out of  46
            inbox+      has 10 in sequence unseen          ; out of 153
            junklist    has  0 in sequence unseen          ; out of  63
            postmaster  has  1 in sequence unseen          ; out of   3

       The “+” after <u>inbox</u> indicates that it is the current folder.

       The  “private” flag indicates that the given sequence for that folder is private.  See <u><a href="../man5/mh-sequence.5.html">mh-sequence</a></u>(5) for
       details about private sequences.

       If the option <b>-all</b> and <u>+folder</u> are both specified, then <b>flist</b> will search this folder, and all its  first
       level subfolders for the given sequence.  You may specify multiple folders in this way.

       If <b>flist</b> is invoked by a name ending with “s” (e.g.  <b>flists</b>), then the switch <b>-all</b> is assumed by default.

       The  sorting  order  for the listing is alphabetical (with <b>-alpha</b>), or in a priority order defined by the
       “<u>Flist-Order</u>” profile entry (with <b>-noalpha</b>).  Each item in the “<u>Flist-Order</u>” is a folder name or a folder
       name pattern that uses * to match zero or more characters.  Longer matching patterns have precedence over
       shorter matching patterns.  For example:

            Flist-Order: personal petproject mh* * admin *junk

       This order puts a few interesting folders first, such as those with mail  addressed  to  you  personally,
       those  about  a  pet  project, and those about mh-related things.  It places uninteresting folders at the
       end, and it puts everything else in the middle in alphabetical order.

       $HOME/.mh_profile   The user's profile.

</pre><h4><b>PROFILE</b> <b>COMPONENTS</b></h4><pre>
       Path:               To determine the user's nmh directory.
       mh-sequences:       File that contains public sequences.
       Unseen-Sequence:    The name of the unseen message sequence.
       Flist-Order:        To sort folders by priority.

</pre><h4><b>CONTEXT</b></h4><pre>
       If <u>+folder</u> is given, it will become the current folder.  If multiple folders  are  given,  the  last  one
       specified will become the current folder.
