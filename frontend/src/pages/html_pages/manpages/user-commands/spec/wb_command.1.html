       <b>-annotation-resample</b> RESAMPLE AN ANNOTATION FILE TO DIFFERENT MESHES

              wb_command <b>-annotation-resample</b>

              &lt;annotation-in&gt;  - the annotation file to resample &lt;annotation-out&gt; - name of resampled annotation
              file

              [-surface-pair] - repeatable - pair of surfaces for resampling surface

              annotations for one structure &lt;source-surface&gt; - the midthickness surface of the current mesh the

              annotations use

              &lt;target-surface&gt; - the midthickness surface of the mesh the

              annotations should be transferred to

              Resample an annotation file from the source mesh to the target mesh.

              Only annotations in surface space are modified, no  changes  are  made  to  annotations  in  other
              spaces.   The <b>-surface-pair</b> option may be repeated for additional structures used by surface space
              annotations.

       <b>-backend-average-dense-roi</b> CONNECTOME DB BACKEND COMMAND FOR CIFTI AVERAGE DENSE ROI

              wb_command <b>-backend-average-dense-roi</b>

              &lt;index-list&gt; - comma separated list of cifti indexes to average &lt;out-file&gt; -  file  to  write  the
              average row to

              This  command is probably not the one you are looking for, try <b>-cifti-average-dense-roi</b>.  It takes
              the list of cifti files to average from standard input, and writes its output  as  little  endian,
              32-bit integer of row size followed by the row as 32-bit floats.

       <b>-backend-average-roi-correlation</b> CONNECTOME DB BACKEND COMMAND FOR CIFTI AVERAGE ROI CORRELATION

              wb_command <b>-backend-average-roi-correlation</b>

              &lt;index-list&gt; - comma separated list of cifti indexes to average and then

              correlate

              &lt;out-file&gt; - file to write the average row to

              This  command is probably not the one you are looking for, try <b>-cifti-average-roi-correlation</b>.  It
              takes the list of cifti files to average from standard input, and  writes  its  output  as  little
              endian, 32-bit integer of row size followed by the row as 32-bit floats.

       <b>-border-export-color-table</b> WRITE BORDER NAMES AND COLORS AS TEXT

              wb_command <b>-border-export-color-table</b>

              &lt;border-file&gt; - the input border file &lt;table-out&gt; - output - the output text file

              [-class-colors] - use class colors instead of the name colors

              Takes   the   names   and   colors   of  each  border,  and  writes  it  to  the  same  format  as
              <b>-metric-label-import</b> expects.  By default,  the  borders  are  colored  by  border  name,  specify
              <b>-class-colors</b>  to  color them by class instead.  The key values start at 1 and follow the order of
              the borders in the file.

       <b>-border-file-export-to-caret5</b> EXPORT BORDER FILE TO CARET5 FILE FORMAT

              wb_command <b>-border-file-export-to-caret5</b>

              &lt;border-file&gt; - workbench border file &lt;output-file-prefix&gt; - prefix for name of output caret5

              border/borderproj/bordercolor files

              [-surface] - repeatable - specify an input surface

              &lt;surface-in&gt; - a surface file for unprojection of borders

              A Workbench border file may contain borders for multiple structures  and  borders  that  are  both
              projected and unprojected.  It also contains a color table for the borders.

              Caret5  has  both border (unprojected) and border projection (projected) files.  In addition, each
              Caret5 border or border projection file typically contains data for  a  single  structure.  Caret5
              also uses a border color file that associates colors with the names of the borders.

              This  command  will  try  to  output  both Caret5 border and border projection files.  Each output
              border/border projection file will contains data for one structure so  there  may  be  many  files
              created.  The structure name is included in the name of each border or border projection file that
              is created.

              One Caret5 border color file will also be produced by this command.

              Providing  surface(s) as input parameters is optional, but recommended.  Surfaces may be needed to
              create both projected and/or unprojected coordinates of borders.  If there is a failure to produce
              an output border or border projection due to a missing surface with  the  matching  structure,  an
              error message will be displayed and some output files will not be created.

              When writing new files, this command will overwrite a file with the same name.

       <b>-border-length</b> REPORT LENGTH OF BORDERS

              wb_command <b>-border-length</b>

              &lt;border&gt; - the input border file &lt;surface&gt; - the surface to measure the borders on

              [-corrected-areas] - vertex areas to use instead of computing them from

              the surface &lt;area-metric&gt; - the corrected vertex areas, as a metric

              [-separate-pieces] - report lengths for multi-part borders as separate

              numbers

              [-hide-border-name] - don't print border name before each output

       For each border, print its length along the surface, in mm.
              If a border

              has  multiple  parts,  their  lengths  are  summed  before  printing,  unless  <b>-separate-pieces</b> is
              specified.

              The <b>-corrected-areas</b> option is intended for when the length  is  not  meaningfully  measurable  on
              individual  surfaces,  it  is  only  an approximate correction for the reduction in structure of a
              group average surface.

       <b>-border-merge</b> MERGE BORDER FILES INTO A NEW FILE

              wb_command <b>-border-merge</b>

              &lt;border-file-out&gt; - output - the output border file

              [-border] - repeatable - specify an input border file

              &lt;border-file-in&gt; - a border file to use borders from

              [-select] - repeatable - select a single border to use

              &lt;border&gt; - the border number or name

              [-up-to] - use an inclusive range of borders

              &lt;last-border&gt; - the number or name of the last column to include

              [-reverse] - use the range in reverse order

              Takes one or more border files and makes a new border file from the borders in them.

              Example: wb_command <b>-border-merge</b> out.border <b>-border</b> first.border <b>-select</b> 1 <b>-border</b> second.border

              This example would take  the  first  border  from  first.border,  followed  by  all  borders  from
              second.border, and write these to out.border.

       <b>-border-resample</b> RESAMPLE A BORDER FILE TO A DIFFERENT MESH

              wb_command <b>-border-resample</b>

              &lt;border-in&gt;  -  the border file to resample &lt;current-sphere&gt; - a sphere surface with the mesh that
              the metric is

              currently on

              &lt;new-sphere&gt; - a sphere surface that is in register with &lt;current-sphere&gt;

              and has the desired output mesh

              &lt;border-out&gt; - output - the output border file

              Resamples a border file, given two spherical surfaces that are in  register.   Only  borders  that
              have the same structure as current-sphere will be resampled.

       <b>-border-to-rois</b> MAKE METRIC ROIS FROM BORDERS

              wb_command <b>-border-to-rois</b>

              &lt;surface&gt;  -  the  surface the borders are drawn on &lt;border-file&gt; - the border file &lt;metric-out&gt; -
              output - the output metric file

              [-border] - create ROI for only one border

              &lt;name&gt; - the name of the border

              [-inverse] - use inverse selection (outside border)

              [-include-border] - include vertices the border is closest to

              By default, draws ROIs inside all borders in the border file, as separate metric columns.

       <b>-border-to-vertices</b> DRAW BORDERS AS VERTICES IN A METRIC FILE

              wb_command <b>-border-to-vertices</b>

              &lt;surface&gt; - the surface the borders are drawn on &lt;border-file&gt; - the border  file  &lt;metric-out&gt;  -
              output - the output metric file

              [-border] - create ROI for only one border

              &lt;name&gt; - the name of the border

              Outputs  a  metric  with  1s  on  vertices  that follow a border, and 0s elsewhere.  By default, a
              separate metric column is created for each border.

       <b>-cifti-all-labels-to-rois</b> MAKE ROIS FROM ALL LABELS IN A CIFTI LABEL MAP

              wb_command <b>-cifti-all-labels-to-rois</b>

              &lt;label-in&gt; - the input cifti label file &lt;map&gt; - the number  or  name  of  the  label  map  to  use
              &lt;cifti-out&gt; - output - the output cifti file

              The  output cifti file is a dscalar file with a column (map) for each label in the specified input
              map, other than the ??? label, each of which contains a binary ROI of all brainordinates that  are
              set to the corresponding label.

              Most of the time, specifying '1' for the &lt;map&gt; argument will do what is desired.

       <b>-cifti-average</b> AVERAGE CIFTI FILES

              &lt;weight&gt; - the weight to use

       Averages cifti files together.
              Files without <b>-weight</b> specified are given

       a weight of 1.
              If <b>-exclude-outliers</b> is specified, at each element, the

              data  across  all  files  is taken as a set, its unweighted mean and sample standard deviation are
              found, and values outside the specified number  of  standard  deviations  are  excluded  from  the
              (potentially weighted) average at that element.

       treated as weighting functions, including negative values.
              For

              efficiency,  ensure  that  everything  that is not intended to be used is zero in the ROI map.  If
              <b>-cifti-roi</b> is  specified,  <b>-left-roi</b>,  <b>-right-roi</b>,  <b>-cerebellum-roi</b>,  and  <b>-vol-roi</b>  must  not  be

              This  command  is used to convert a full CIFTI matrix to/from formats that can be used by programs
              that don't understand CIFTI.  You must specify  exactly  one  of  <b>-to-gifti-ext</b>,  <b>-from-gifti-ext</b>,
              <b>-to-nifti</b>, <b>-from-nifti</b>, <b>-to-text</b>, or <b>-from-text</b>.

              If you want to write an existing CIFTI file with a different CIFTI version, see <b>-file-convert</b>, and
              its <b>-cifti-version-convert</b> option.

              If  you  want  part of the CIFTI file as a metric, label, or volume file, see <b>-cifti-separate</b>.  If
              you want to create a CIFTI file from metric and/or volume files, see the <b>-cifti-create-</b>* commands.

              If you want to import a matrix that is restricted to an ROI, first create a  template  CIFTI  file
              matching  that ROI using a <b>-cifti-create-</b>* command.  After importing to CIFTI, you can then expand
              the file into a standard brainordinates space with <b>-cifti-create-dense-from-template</b>.  If you want
              to  export  only  part  of  a  CIFTI  file,  first  create  an  roi-restricted  CIFTI  file   with
              <b>-cifti-restrict-dense-mapping</b>.

              The  <b>-transpose</b>  option  to  <b>-from-gifti-ext</b>  is  needed  if  the  replacement  binary  file is in
              column-major order.

              The <b>-unit</b> options accept these values:

              For each row (or each row inside an roi if <b>-roi-override</b> is specified),  correlate  to  all  other

              suboption, but you may specify the other -*-roi suboptions together.

              When using the <b>-fisher-z</b> option, the output is NOT a Z-score, it is artanh(r), to do further  math
              on this output, consider using <b>-cifti-math</b>.

              Restricting  the  memory  usage will make it calculate the output in chunks, and if the input file
              size is more than 70% of the memory limit, it will also read through the input file  as  rows  are
              required,  resulting in several passes through the input file (once per chunk).  Memory limit does
              not need to be an integer, you may also specify 0 to calculate a single output row at a time (this
              may be very slow).

              Label names are specified on a separate line from their value and color, in  order  to  let  label
              names  contain  spaces.  Whitespace is trimmed from both ends of the label name, but is kept if it
              is in the middle of a label.  Do not specify the "unlabeled" key in the file, it is assumed that 0
              means not labeled unless <b>-unlabeled-value</b> is specified.  The value of &lt;key&gt; specifies  what  value

              This would change the current label with key '3' to use the key '5' instead, 5 would use 8, and  8
              would use 2.  Any collision in key values results in the label that was not specified in the remap
              file  getting  remapped  to  an otherwise unused key.  Remapping more than one key to the same new

              one <b>-var</b> option (to get the output layout from), even if the &lt;name&gt; specified in it isn't used  in
              &lt;expression&gt;.

              To  select  a single column from a 2D file (most cifti files are 2D), use <b>-select</b> 1 &lt;index&gt;, where
              &lt;index&gt; is 1-based.  To select a single row from a 2D file, use <b>-select</b> 2 &lt;index&gt;.  Where  <b>-select</b>
              is  not  used,  the  cifti  files  must  have  compatible mappings (e.g., brain models and parcels
              mappings must match exactly except for parcel names).  Use <b>-override-mapping-check</b>  to  skip  this
              checking.

              Filenames  are  not  valid  in  &lt;expression&gt;,  use a variable name and a <b>-var</b> option with matching
              &lt;name&gt; to specify an input file.  The format of &lt;expression&gt; is as follows:

              Expressions consist of constants, variables,  operators,  parentheses,  and  functions,  in  infix
              notation,  such  as  'exp(<b>-x</b>  +  3)  *  scale'.   Variables  are  strings of any length, using the
              characters a-z, A-Z, 0-9, and _, but may not take the name of a named constant.  Currently,  there
              is only one named constant, PI.  The operators are +, -, *, /, ^, &gt;, &lt;, &gt;=, &lt;=, ==, !=, !, &amp;&amp;, ||.
              These behave as in C, except that ^ is exponentiation, i.e. pow(x, y), and takes higher precedence
              than  other  binary  operators  (also, '-3^-4^-5' means '-(3^(-(4^-5)))').  The &lt;=, &gt;=, ==, and !=
              operators are given a small amount of wiggle room, equal to one millionth of the  smaller  of  the
              absolute values of the values being compared.

              Comparison  and  logical  operators  return  0 or 1, you can do masking with expressions like 'x *
              (mask &gt; 0)'.  For all logical operators, an input is considered true iff it  is  greater  than  0.
              The expression '0 &lt; x &lt; 5' is not syntactically wrong, but it will NOT do what is desired, because
              it  is evaluated left to right, i.e. '((0 &lt; x) &lt; 5)', which will always return 1, as both possible
              results of a comparison are less than 5.  A warning is generated if an expression of this type  is
              detected.  Use something like 'x &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; x &lt; 5' to get the desired behavior.

              Whitespace  between  elements  is  ignored,  ' sin ( 2 * x ) ' is equivalent to 'sin(2*x)', but 's
              in(2*x)' is an error.  Implied multiplication is not allowed, the expression '2x' will  be  parsed
              as  a  variable.   Parentheses  are  (),  do not use [] or {}.  Functions require parentheses, the
              expression 'sin x' is an error.

              The following functions are supported:

              sin: 1 argument, the sine of the argument (units are radians) cos: 1 argument, the cosine  of  the
              argument  (units  are  radians)  tan:  1 argument, the tangent of the argument (units are radians)
              asin: 1 argument, the inverse of sine of the argument, in radians acos: 1 argument, the inverse of

              anything.   Input  volumes must line up with the output of <b>-cifti-separate</b>.  For dtseries/dscalar,
              use COLUMN, and if your dconn matrix will be fully  symmetric,  COLUMN  is  more  efficient.   The
              <b>-volume-all</b>  option  must not be specified when using a <b>-volume</b> option.  A <b>-metric</b> option must not
              be specified when using a <b>-label</b> option, and is not recommended on a label-type cifti  file.   For
              each &lt;structure&gt; argument, use one of the following strings:

       Resample cifti data to a different brainordinate space.
              Use COLUMN for

       the direction to resample dscalar, dlabel, or dtseries.
              Resampling both

              dimensions of a dconn requires running this command twice, once with COLUMN and once with ROW.  If
              you are resampling a dconn and your machine has a large amount of memory, you might consider using
              <b>-cifti-resample-dconn-memory</b>   to   avoid   writing  and  rereading  an  intermediate  file.   The
              &lt;template-direction&gt; argument should usually be COLUMN, as dtseries, dscalar, and dlabel all  have
              brainordinates  on  that  direction.   If  spheres are not specified for a surface structure which
              exists in the cifti files, its data is copied without resampling or dilation.   Dilation  is  done
              with  the  'nearest'  method, and is done on &lt;new-sphere&gt; for surface data.  Volume components are
              padded before dilation so that dilation doesn't run into the edge of the component  bounding  box.

              data.

              The recommended resampling methods are ADAP_BARY_AREA and CUBIC (cubic spline), except  for  label

              is  superior.   Note  that  wb_command assumes that world matrices transform source coordinates to
              target coordinates, while other tools may use affines that transform target coordinates to  source
              coordinates.

              The ITK format is used by ANTS.

              NIFTI world warpfields can be used directly on mm coordinates via sampling the three subvolumes at
              the  coordinate  and  adding  the  sampled  values  to  the coordinate vector.  They use the NIFTI

              NOTE:  this command does not invert the warpfield, and to warp a surface, you must use the inverse

              wb_command <b>-create-signed-distance-volume</b>

              [-winding] - winding method for point inside surface test

              &lt;method&gt; - name of the method (default EVEN_ODD)

       Computes the signed distance function of the surface.
              Exact distance is

              calculated  by  finding  the  closest  point  on  any surface triangle to the center of the voxel.
              Approximate distance is calculated starting with these distances, using dijkstra's method  with  a
              neighborhood of voxels.  Specifying too small of an exact distance may produce unexpected results.
              Valid specifiers for winding methods are as follows:

              EVEN_ODD (default) NEGATIVE NONZERO NORMALS

              The  NORMALS  method uses the normals of triangles and edges, or the closest triangle hit by a ray
              from the point.  This method may be slightly faster, but is only reliable  for  a  closed  surface
              that  does not cross through itself.  All other methods count entry (positive) and exit (negative)
              crossings of a vertical ray from the point, then counts as inside if the total is  odd,  negative,
              or nonzero, respectively.

              3 5 5 8 8 2

              This  would change the current label with key '3' to use the key '5' instead, 5 would use 8, and 8
              would use 2.  Any collision in key values results in the label that was not specified in the remap
              file getting remapped to an otherwise unused key.  Remapping more than one key  to  the  same  new
              key,  or  the  same  key  to more than one new key, results in an error.  This will not change the
              appearance of the file when displayed, as it will change the key values in the data  at  the  same
              time.

              used, exactly one of <b>-area-surfs</b> or <b>-area-metrics</b> must be specified.

              The  ADAP_BARY_AREA method is recommended for label data, because it should be better at resolving
              vertices that are near multiple labels, or in case of  downsampling.   Midthickness  surfaces  are
              recommended for the vertex areas for most data.

              The  <b>-largest</b> option results in nearest vertex behavior when used with BARYCENTRIC, as it uses the
              value of the source vertex that has the largest weight.

              When <b>-largest</b> is not specified, the vertex weights  are  summed  according  to  which  label  they

              the surface &lt;area-metric&gt; - the corrected vertex areas, as a metric

              [-legacy-cutoff] - use the v1.3.2 method of choosing how many vertices to

              use when calulating the dilated value with weighted method

              For all metric vertices that are designated as bad, if they neighbor a non-bad vertex with data or
              are within the specified distance of such a  vertex,  replace  the  value  with  a  distance-based
              weighted  average  of nearby non-bad vertices that have data, otherwise set the value to zero.  No
              matter how small &lt;distance&gt; is, dilation will always use at least the immediate neighbor vertices.
              If <b>-nearest</b> is specified, it will use the value from the closest non-bad vertex with  data  within
              range instead of a weighted average.

              If  <b>-bad-vertex-roi</b>  is  specified,  all vertices with a positive ROI value are bad.  If it is not
              specified, only vertices that have data, with a value of zero,  are  bad.   If  <b>-data-roi</b>  is  not
              specified, all vertices are assumed to have data.

              Note  that  the <b>-corrected-areas</b> option uses an approximate correction for the change in distances
              along a group average surface.

              To get the behavior of version 1.3.2 or earlier, use '-legacy-cutoff <b>-exponent</b> 2'.

              Finds extrema in a metric file, such that no two extrema of the same type are within &lt;distance&gt; of
              each other.  The extrema are labeled as <b>-1</b> for minima, 1 for maxima, 0 otherwise.  If <b>-only-maxima</b>
              or <b>-only-minima</b> is specified, then it will ignore  extrema  not  of  the  specified  type.   These
              options are mutually exclusive.

              If <b>-roi</b> is specified, not only is data outside the roi not used, but any vertex on the edge of the
              ROI  will  never  be  counted  as  an extrema, in case the ROI cuts across a gradient, which would
              otherwise generate extrema where there should be none.

              If <b>-sum-columns</b> is specified, these extrema columns are summed, and the output has a single column

              the surface &lt;area-metric&gt; - the corrected vertex areas, as a metric

              [-average-normals] - average the normals of each vertex with its

              neighbors before using them to compute the gradient

              At  each  vertex,  the immediate neighbors are unfolded onto a plane tangent to the surface at the
              vertex (specifically, perpendicular to the normal).  The gradient is computed using  a  regression
              between  the  unfolded  positions of the vertices and their values.  The gradient is then given by
              the slopes of the regression, and reconstructed as a 3D gradient vector.  By  default,  takes  the
              gradient  of  all  columns,  with no presmoothing, across the whole surface, without averaging the
              normals of the surface among neighbors.

              When using <b>-corrected-areas</b>, note that it  is  an  approximate  correction.   Doing  smoothing  on
              individual surfaces before averaging/gradient is preferred, when possible, in order to make use of
              the original surface structure.

              Specifying  an  ROI  will  restrict  the  gradient  to  only use data from where the ROI metric is
              positive, and output zeros anywhere the ROI metric is not positive.

              By default, the first column of the roi metric is used for all input columns.  When <b>-match-columns</b>
              is specified to the <b>-roi</b> option, the input and roi metrics must have the same number  of  columns,
              and  for  each  input  column's  index,  the  same column index is used in the roi metric.  If the
              <b>-match-columns</b> option to <b>-roi</b> is used while the <b>-column</b> option is also used, the number of columns
              of the roi metric must match the input metric, and it will use the roi column with  the  index  of
              the selected input column.

              The  vector  output  metric  is organized such that the X, Y, and Z components from a single input
              column are consecutive columns.

              &lt;labelname&gt; &lt;key&gt; &lt;red&gt; &lt;green&gt; &lt;blue&gt; &lt;alpha&gt; ...

              Label names are specified on a separate line from their value and color, in  order  to  let  label
              names  contain  spaces.  Whitespace is trimmed from both ends of the label name, but is kept if it
              is in the middle of a label.  Do not specify the "unlabeled" key in the file, it is assumed that 0
              means not labeled unless <b>-unlabeled-value</b> is specified.  The value of &lt;key&gt; specifies  what  value
              in  the  imported  file  should  be used as this label (these same key values are also used in the
              output file).  The values of &lt;red&gt;, &lt;green&gt;, &lt;blue&gt; and &lt;alpha&gt; must be integers from  0  to  255,
              and  will  specify  the  color  the  label  is drawn as (alpha of 255 means fully opaque, which is
              probably what you want).

              By default, it will create new label names with names like LABEL_5 for any values encountered that
              are not mentioned in the list file, specify <b>-discard-others</b> to instead set  these  values  to  the

              [-repeat] - reuse a single column for each column of calculation

              This command evaluates &lt;expression&gt; at each surface vertex independently.  There must be at  least
              one  <b>-var</b>  option  (to get the structure, number of vertices, and number of columns from), even if
              the &lt;name&gt; specified in it isn't used in &lt;expression&gt;.  All metrics must have the same  number  of
              vertices.   Filenames  are  not  valid in &lt;expression&gt;, use a variable name and a <b>-var</b> option with
              matching &lt;name&gt; to specify an input file.  If the <b>-column</b> option is given to any <b>-var</b> option, only
              one column is used from that file.  If <b>-repeat</b> is specified, the file must either  have  only  one
              column, or have the <b>-column</b> option specified.  All files that don't use <b>-repeat</b> must have the same
              number of columns requested to be used.  The format of &lt;expression&gt; is as follows:

              Expressions  consist  of  constants,  variables,  operators,  parentheses, and functions, in infix
              notation, such as 'exp(<b>-x</b> + 3)  *  scale'.   Variables  are  strings  of  any  length,  using  the
              characters  a-z, A-Z, 0-9, and _, but may not take the name of a named constant.  Currently, there
              is only one named constant, PI.  The operators are +, -, *, /, ^, &gt;, &lt;, &gt;=, &lt;=, ==, !=, !, &amp;&amp;, ||.
              These behave as in C, except that ^ is exponentiation, i.e. pow(x, y), and takes higher precedence
              than other binary operators (also, '-3^-4^-5' means '-(3^(-(4^-5)))').  The &lt;=,  &gt;=,  ==,  and  !=
              operators  are  given  a small amount of wiggle room, equal to one millionth of the smaller of the
              absolute values of the values being compared.

              Comparison and logical operators return 0 or 1, you can do masking  with  expressions  like  'x  *
              (mask  &gt;  0)'.   For  all logical operators, an input is considered true iff it is greater than 0.
              The expression '0 &lt; x &lt; 5' is not syntactically wrong, but it will NOT do what is desired, because
              it is evaluated left to right, i.e. '((0 &lt; x) &lt; 5)', which will always return 1, as both  possible
              results  of a comparison are less than 5.  A warning is generated if an expression of this type is
              detected.  Use something like 'x &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; x &lt; 5' to get the desired behavior.

              Whitespace between elements is ignored, ' sin ( 2 * x ) ' is  equivalent  to  'sin(2*x)',  but  's
              in(2*x)'  is  an error.  Implied multiplication is not allowed, the expression '2x' will be parsed
              as a variable.  Parentheses are (), do not use []  or  {}.   Functions  require  parentheses,  the
              expression 'sin x' is an error.

              used, exactly one of <b>-area-surfs</b> or <b>-area-metrics</b> must be specified.

              The  ADAP_BARY_AREA method is recommended for ordinary metric data, because it should use all data
              while downsampling, unlike BARYCENTRIC.  The recommended areas option for most data is  individual
              midthicknesses   for   individual   data,   and  averaged  vertex  area  metrics  from  individual
              midthicknesses for group average data.

              The <b>-current-roi</b> option only masks the input, the output may be slightly  dilated  in  comparison,
              consider using <b>-metric-mask</b> on the output when using <b>-current-roi</b>.

              The  <b>-largest</b>  option  results  in  nearest  vertex  behavior  when  used  with BARYCENTRIC.  When
              resampling a binary metric, consider thresholding  at  0.5  after  resampling  rather  than  using
              <b>-largest</b>.

              argument  to  <b>-overlap-logic</b> must be one of ALLOW, CLOSEST, or EXCLUDE.  ALLOW is the default, and
              means that ROIs are treated independently and may  overlap.   CLOSEST  means  that  ROIs  may  not
              overlap,  and  that  no ROI contains vertices that are closer to a different seed vertex.  EXCLUDE
              means that ROIs may not overlap, and that any vertex within range of more than one  ROI  does  not

              The <b>-fix-zeros</b> option causes the smoothing to not use an input value if  it  is  zero,  but  still
              write a smoothed value to the vertex.  This is useful for zeros that indicate lack of information,
              preventing  them  from  pulling  down  the  intensity of nearby vertices, while giving the zero an
              extrapolated value.

              The <b>-corrected-areas</b> option is intended for when it is unavoidable to smooth on  a  group  average
              surface,  it  is  only an approximate correction for the reduction of structure in a group average
              surface.  It is better to smooth the data on individuals before averaging, when feasible.

              Valid values for &lt;method&gt; are:

              GEO_GAUSS_AREA - uses a geodesic gaussian kernel, and normalizes based on vertex area in order  to
              work more reliably on irregular surfaces

              GEO_GAUSS_EQUAL  -  uses a geodesic gaussian kernel, and normalizes assuming each vertex has equal
              importance

              GEO_GAUSS - matches geodesic gaussian smoothing from caret5, but does not check kernels for having
              unequal importance

              The  GEO_GAUSS_AREA  method  is  the  default  because  it  is   usually   the   correct   choice.
              GEO_GAUSS_EQUAL  may  be  the correct choice when the sum of vertex values is more meaningful then
              the surface integral (sum of values .* areas), for instance when smoothing vertex areas  (the  sum
              is  the total surface area, while the surface integral is the sum of squares of the vertex areas).
              The GEO_GAUSS method is not recommended, it exists mainly to replicate  methods  of  studies  done
              with caret5's geodesic smoothing.

              Threshold-free cluster enhancement is a method to increase the  relative  value  of  regions  that
              would  form  clusters  in  a  standard  thresholding test.  This is accomplished by evaluating the
              integral of:

              e(h, p)^E * h^H * dh

              at each vertex p, where h ranges from 0 to the maximum value in the  data,  and  e(h,  p)  is  the
              extent  of the cluster containing vertex p at threshold h.  Negative values are similarly enhanced
              by negating the data, running the same process, and negating the result.

              When using <b>-presmooth</b> with <b>-corrected-areas</b>, note that it is an approximate correction within  the
              smoothing algorithm (the TFCE correction is exact).  Doing smoothing on individual surfaces before
              averaging/TFCE  is  preferred,  when possible, in order to better tie the smoothing kernel size to
              the original feature size.

              The TFCE method is explained in: Smith  SM,  Nichols  TE.,  "Threshold-free  cluster  enhancement:
              addressing  problems  of  smoothing,  threshold dependence and localisation in cluster inference."

              images only and DO NOT create any output images

       <b>----------------------------------------------------------------------</b>

              Render content of browser windows displayed in a scene into image file(s).

              If none of the "-size" options are specified, the default is "-size-window" (Output image is  size
              of the window that was saved in the scene).

              For the "-size" options that accept a width and/or height, the values default to number of pixels.
              To express the width and/or height in physical units (inches, centimeters, etc.), use the "-units"
              option.   When  physical units are used, the pixel width and height are derived using the physical
              width/height and the image resolution (see the "-resolution" option).

              Note that scenes created prior to version 1.2 (May 2016) do not contain information about the size
              of the window.  Therefore, one must use the "-size-width-height" option.

              Examples:

       Generate an image of the second scene.
              Width and height of image is

              width and height of window saved in the scene.

              wb_command <b>-scene-capture-image</b> myscene.scene 2 image2.jpg

              Generate an image of the second scene with a margin around sides of the image. Width and height of
              image is width and height of window saved in the scene.

       wb_command <b>-scene-capture-image</b> myscene.scene 2 image2.jpg
              <b>-margin</b> 10

              Generate an image of the second scene that is 6 inches  width  with  300  pixels  per  inch.   The
              resulting  width is 1800 pixels.  The resulting height of the image is a function of the width and
              the aspect ratio (height divided by width) of the window size saved in the scene.

              wb_command  <b>-scene-capture-image</b>  myscene.scene  2  image21.jpg  \  <b>-size-width</b>  6  <b>-units</b>  INCHES
              <b>-resolution</b> 300 PIXELS_PER_INCH

              Print  information  about  the  size  of  the  output image for the second scene (no image file is
              created) using a width of 4.5 centimeters.

       <b>-scene-file-merge</b> REARRANGE SCENES INTO A NEW FILE

              wb_command <b>-scene-file-merge</b>

              &lt;scene-file-out&gt; - output - the output scene file

              [-scene-file] - repeatable - specify a scene file to use scenes from

              &lt;scene-file&gt; - the input scene file

              [-scene] - repeatable - specify a scene to use

              &lt;scene&gt; - the scene number or name

              [-up-to] - use an inclusive range of scenes

              &lt;last-column&gt; - the number or name of the last scene to include

              [-reverse] - use the range in reverse order

              Takes  one  or  more scene files and constructs a new scene file by concatenating specified scenes
              from them.

              Example: wb_command <b>-scene-file-merge</b>  out.scene  <b>-scene-file</b>  first.scene  <b>-scene</b>  1  <b>-scene-file</b>
              second.scene

              This  example  would  take  the  first  scene  from  first.scene,  followed  by  all  scenes  from
              second.scene, and write these scenes to out.scene.

       <b>-scene-file-relocate</b> RECREATE SCENE FILE IN NEW LOCATION

              wb_command <b>-scene-file-relocate</b>

              &lt;input-scene&gt; - the scene file to use &lt;output-scene&gt; - output - the new scene file to create

              Scene files contain internal relative paths, such that moving or copying a scene file  will  cause
              it to lose track of the files it refers to.  This command makes a modified copy of the scene file,
              changing the relative paths to refer to the new relative locations of the files.

       <b>-scene-file-update</b> UPDATE SCENE FILE

              wb_command <b>-scene-file-update</b>

              &lt;input-scene-file&gt;  -  the  input  scene  file  &lt;output-scene-file&gt; - the new scene file to create
              &lt;scene-name-or-number&gt; - name or number (starting at one) of the scene in

              the scene file

              [-fix-map-palette-settings] - Fix palette settings for files with change

              in number of maps

              [-remove-missing-files] - Remove missing files from SpecFile

              [-error] - Abort command if there is an error performing any of the

              operations on the scene file

              [-verbose] - Print names of files that have palettes updated

              [-copy-map-one-palette] - repeatable - Copy palettes settings from first

              map to all maps in a data file &lt;Data File Name Suffix&gt; - Name of palette mapped data file (cifti,

              metric, volume)

              [-data-file-add] - repeatable - Add a data file to scene's loaded files

       &lt;Name of data file&gt; - Name of data file.
              If a data file not in the

              current directory, it is best to use an absolute path (a relative path may work).   Instead  of  a
              data  file, this value may be the name of a text file (must end in ".txt") that contains the names
              of one or more data files, one per line.

              Example on UNIX to create a text file containing all CIFTI scalar

              files in the current directory with absolute paths: ls <b>-d</b> $PWD/*dscalar.nii  &gt; file.txt

              [-data-file-remove] - repeatable - Remove a data file from scene's loaded

              files &lt;Name of data file&gt; - Name of data file.  If a data file not in the

              current directory, it is best to use an absolute path (a relative path may work).   Instead  of  a
              data  file, this value may be the name of a text file (must end in ".txt") that contains the names
              of one or more data files, one per line.

              Example on UNIX to create a text file containing all CIFTI scalar

              files in the current directory with absolute paths: ls <b>-d</b> $PWD/*dscalar.nii  &gt; file.txt

              This command will update a scene for specific changes in data files.

              "-fix-map-palette-settings" will find all data files that have had a change in the number of  maps
              since  the scene scene was created.  If the file has its "Apply to All Maps" property enabled, the
              palette setting in the first map is copied to all maps in  the  file.   Note:  This  modifies  the
              palette settings for the file in the scene (data file is NOT modified).

              "-copy-map-one-palette"  will  copy the palette settings from the first map to all other maps in a
              data file.  This option is typically used when the number of maps in  a  data  file  changes.   It
              changes  the  palette  settings  in  the scene that are applied to the data file when the scene is
              loaded (the data file is not modified).  The name of the data file specified on the  command  line
              is  matched  to  the end of file names in the scene.  This allows matching multiple files if their
              names end with the same characters.  It also allows including a relative path when there  is  more
              than one file with the same name but in different paths and only one of the files to be updated.

              "-remove-missing-files"  Any  files  that fail to load when the scene is read will be removed from
              the scene.  Thus, if one deletes files prior to running with this option, the  deleted  files  are
              removed from the scene.

              "-error"  If  this  option  is  provided  and  there is an error while performing any of the scene
              operations, the command will immediately cease processing and the output scene file  will  not  be
              created.  Otherwise any errors will be listed after the command finishes.

       <b>-set-map-names</b> SET THE NAME OF ONE OR MORE MAPS IN A FILE

              wb_command <b>-set-map-names</b>

              &lt;data-file&gt; - the file to set the map names of

              reference surface that defines the signed distance

              function

              &lt;metric&gt; - output - the output metric

              [-winding] - winding method for point inside surface test

              &lt;method&gt; - name of the method (default EVEN_ODD)

              Compute  the  signed  distance function of the reference surface at every vertex on the comparison
              surface.  NOTE: this relation is NOT symmetric, the line from a vertex to the closest point on the
              'ref' surface (the one that defines the signed distance function) will only align with the  normal
              of the 'ref' surface.  Valid specifiers for winding methods are as follows:

              EVEN_ODD (default) NEGATIVE NONZERO NORMALS

              The  NORMALS  method uses the normals of triangles and edges, or the closest triangle hit by a ray
              from the point.  This method may be slightly faster, but is only reliable  for  a  closed  surface
              that  does not cross through itself.  All other methods count entry (positive) and exit (negative)
              crossings of a vertical ray from the point, then counts as inside if the total is  odd,  negative,
              or nonzero, respectively.

       <b>-spec-file-merge</b> MERGE TWO SPEC FILES INTO ONE

              wb_command <b>-spec-file-merge</b>

              output spec file

              The output spec file contains every file that is in either of the input spec files.

       <b>-spec-file-relocate</b> RECREATE SPEC FILE IN NEW LOCATION

              wb_command <b>-spec-file-relocate</b>

              &lt;input-spec&gt; - the spec file to use &lt;output-spec&gt; - output - the new spec file to create

              Spec files contain internal relative paths, such that moving or copying a spec file will cause  it
              to  lose  track  of  the files it refers to.  This command makes a modified copy of the spec file,
              changing the relative paths to refer to the new relative locations of the files.

       <b>-surface-affine-regression</b> REGRESS THE AFFINE TRANSFORM BETWEEN SURFACES ON THE SAME MESH

              wb_command <b>-surface-affine-regression</b>

              output - the output affine file

              Use  linear  regression  to  compute an affine that minimizes the sum of squares of the coordinate
              differences between the target surface and the warped source surface.  Note that this has  a  bias
              to  shrink the surface that is being warped.  The output is written as a NIFTI 'world' matrix, see
              <b>-convert-affine</b> to convert it for use in other software.

       <b>-surface-apply-affine</b> APPLY AFFINE TRANSFORM TO SURFACE FILE

              wb_command <b>-surface-apply-affine</b>

              &lt;in-surf&gt; - the surface to transform &lt;affine&gt; - the affine file &lt;out-surf&gt; - output -  the  output
              transformed surface

              [-flirt] - MUST be used if affine is a flirt affine

              &lt;source-volume&gt;  -  the source volume used when generating the affine &lt;target-volume&gt; - the target
              volume used when generating the affine

              For flirt matrices, you must use the <b>-flirt</b> option, because flirt  matrices  are  not  a  complete
              description  of the coordinate transform they represent.  If the <b>-flirt</b> option is not present, the
              affine must be a nifti 'world' affine, which can be obtained with the <b>-convert-affine</b> command,  or
              aff_conv from the 4dfp suite.

              output transformed surface

              [-fnirt] - MUST be used if using a fnirt warpfield

              &lt;forward-warp&gt; - the forward warpfield

              NOTE:  warping a surface requires the INVERSE of the warpfield used to warp the volume it lines up
              with.  The header of the forward warp is needed  by  the  <b>-fnirt</b>  option  in  order  to  correctly
              interpret the displacements in the fnirt warpfield.

              If the <b>-fnirt</b> option is not present, the warpfield must be a nifti 'world' warpfield, which can be
              obtained with the <b>-convert-warpfield</b> command.

              &lt;stddev-metric-out&gt; - output - the output metric for 3D sample

              standard deviation

              [-uncertainty] - compute caret5 'uncertainty'

              &lt;uncert-metric-out&gt; - output - the output metric for uncertainty

              [-surf] - repeatable - specify a surface to include in the average

              &lt;surface&gt; - a surface file to average

              [-weight] - specify a weighted average

              &lt;weight&gt; - the weight to use (default 1)

              The  3D  sample  standard  deviation is computed as 'sqrt(sum(squaredlength(xyz - mean(xyz)))/(n -
              1))'.

              Uncertainty  is  a  legacy  measure  used  in  caret5,  and  is  computed  as  'sum(length(xyz   -
              mean(xyz)))/n'.

              When weights are used, the 3D sample standard deviation treats them as reliability weights.

       <b>-surface-cut-resample</b> RESAMPLE A CUT SURFACE

              wb_command <b>-surface-cut-resample</b>

              &lt;surface-in&gt; - the surface file to resample &lt;current-sphere&gt; - a sphere surface with the mesh that
              the input surface

              is currently on

              &lt;new-sphere&gt; - a sphere surface that is in register with &lt;current-sphere&gt;

              and has the desired output mesh

              &lt;surface-out&gt; - output - the output surface file

              Resamples  a  surface  file,  given  two  spherical  surfaces  that  are in register.  Barycentric
              resampling is used, because it is usually better for resampling surfaces, and because it is needed
              to figure out the new topology anyway.

       <b>-surface-distortion</b> MEASURE DISTORTION BETWEEN SURFACES

              wb_command <b>-surface-distortion</b>

              &lt;surface-reference&gt;  -  the  reference  surface  &lt;surface-distorted&gt;  -  the   distorted   surface
              &lt;metric-out&gt; - output - the output distortion metric

              [-smooth] - smooth the area data

              &lt;sigma&gt; - the size of the smoothing kernel in mm, as sigma by default

              [-fwhm] - kernel size is FWHM, not sigma

              [-caret5-method] - use the surface distortion method from caret5

              [-edge-method] - calculate distortion of edge lengths rather than areas

              [-local-affine-method] - calculate distortion by the local affines

              between triangles

              [-log2] - apply base-2 log transform

              This  command, when not using <b>-caret5-method</b>, <b>-edge-method</b>, or <b>-local-affine-method</b>, is equivalent
              to  using  <b>-surface-vertex-areas</b>  on  each  surface,  smoothing  both  output  metrics  with   the
              GEO_GAUSS_EQUAL  method  on the surface they came from if <b>-smooth</b> is specified, and then using the
              formula 'ln(distorted/reference)/<a href="../man2/ln.2.html">ln</a>(2)' on the smoothed results.

              When using <b>-caret5-method</b>, it uses the surface distortion method from caret5, which takes the base
              2 log of the ratio of tile areas, then averages those results at each vertex, and then smooths the
              result on the reference surface.

              When using <b>-edge-method</b>, the <b>-smooth</b> option is ignored, and the  output  at  each  vertex  is  the
              average of 'abs(ln(refEdge/distortEdge)/<a href="../man2/ln.2.html">ln</a>(2))' over all edges connected to the vertex.

       When using <b>-local-affine-method</b>, the <b>-smooth</b> option is ignored.
              The

              output  is  two  columns,  the  first  is the area distortion ratio, and the second is anisotropic
              strain.  These are calculated by an affine transform between matching triangles, and then averaged
              across the triangles of a vertex.

       <b>-surface-flip-lr</b> MIRROR A SURFACE THROUGH THE YZ PLANE

              wb_command <b>-surface-flip-lr</b>

              &lt;surface&gt; - the surface to flip &lt;surface-out&gt; - output - the output flipped surface

              This command negates the x coordinate of each vertex, and flips the surface normals, so  that  you
              have  a  surface  of  opposite  handedness  with the same features and vertex correspondence, with
              normals consistent with the original surface.  That is, if the input surface  has  normals  facing
              outward, the output surface will also have normals facing outward.

       <b>-surface-flip-normals</b> FLIP ALL TILES ON A SURFACE

              wb_command <b>-surface-flip-normals</b>

              &lt;surface&gt; - the surface to flip the normals of &lt;surface-out&gt; - output - the output surface

              Flips  all  triangles on a surface, resulting in surface normals being flipped the other direction
              (inward vs outward).  If you transform a surface with an affine that has negative determinant,  or
              a  warpfield  that  similarly  flips  the  surface, you may end up with a surface that has normals
              pointing inwards, which may have display problems.  Using this command will solve that problem.

       <b>-surface-generate-inflated</b> SURFACE GENERATE INFLATED

              wb_command <b>-surface-generate-inflated</b>

              &lt;anatomical-surface-in&gt; - the anatomical surface &lt;inflated-surface-out&gt;  -  output  -  the  output
              inflated surface &lt;very-inflated-surface-out&gt; - output - the output very inflated surface

              [-iterations-scale] - optional iterations scaling

              &lt;iterations-scale-value&gt; - iterations-scale value

              Generate  inflated  and  very  inflated surfaces. The output surfaces are 'matched' (have same XYZ
              range) to the anatomical  surface.  In  most  cases,  an  iterations-scale  of  1.0  (default)  is
              sufficient.   However,  if  the  surface  contains  a  large  number of vertices (150,000), try an

       <b>-surface-geodesic-distance</b> COMPUTE GEODESIC DISTANCE FROM ONE VERTEX TO THE ENTIRE SURFACE

              wb_command <b>-surface-geodesic-distance</b>

              &lt;surface&gt; - the surface to compute on &lt;vertex&gt; - the vertex  to  compute  geodesic  distance  from
              &lt;metric-out&gt; - output - the output metric

              [-naive] - use only neighbors, don't crawl triangles (not recommended)

              [-limit] - stop at a certain distance

              &lt;limit-mm&gt; - distance in mm to stop at

              [-corrected-areas] - vertex areas to use instead of computing them from

              the surface &lt;area-metric&gt; - the corrected vertex areas, as a metric

              Unless  <b>-limit</b>  is  specified,  computes  the  geodesic  distance from the specified vertex to all
              others.  The result is output as a single column metric file, with a value of <b>-1</b> for vertices that
              the distance was not computed for.

              The <b>-corrected-areas</b> option should be used when the input is  a  group  average  surface  -  group
              average  surfaces  have significantly less surface area than individual surfaces do, and therefore
              distances measured on them would be smaller than measuring them on individual surfaces.   In  this
              case,  the  input  to this option should be a group average of the output of <b>-surface-vertex-areas</b>
              for each subject.

              If <b>-naive</b> is not specified, the algorithm uses not just immediate neighbors,  but  also  neighbors
              derived from crawling across pairs of triangles that share an edge.

              [-roi] - only output distances for vertices inside an ROI

              &lt;roi-metric&gt; - the ROI as a metric file

              [-limit] - stop at a specified distance

              &lt;limit-mm&gt; - distance in mm to stop at

              [-corrected-areas] - vertex areas to use instead of computing them from

              the surface &lt;area-metric&gt; - the corrected vertex areas, as a metric

              [-naive] - use only neighbors, don't crawl triangles (not recommended)

              Computes geodesic distance from every vertex to every vertex, outputting a single-hemisphere dconn
              file.  If you are only interested in a few vertices, see <b>-surface-geodesic-distance</b>.  When  <b>-limit</b>
              is specified, any vertex beyond the limit is assigned the value <b>-1</b>.

              The  <b>-roi</b>  option  makes  the  output file smaller by not outputting distances to or from vertices
              outside the ROI, but paths are still allowed to go outside the ROI when finding distances to other
              vertices.

              The <b>-corrected-areas</b> option should be used when the input is  a  group  average  surface  -  group
              average  surfaces  have significantly less surface area than individual surfaces do, and therefore
              distances measured on them would be smaller than measuring them on individual surfaces.   In  this
              case,  the  input  to this option should be a group average of the output of <b>-surface-vertex-areas</b>
              for each subject.

              If <b>-naive</b> is not specified, the algorithm uses not just immediate neighbors,  but  also  neighbors

              [-gaussian] - generate a gaussian kernel instead of a flat ROI

              the surface &lt;area-metric&gt; - the corrected vertex areas, as a metric

              For each vertex in the list file, a column in the output metric is created, and an ROI around that
              vertex is drawn in that column.  Each metric column will have zeros outside the geodesic  distance
              spacified  by &lt;limit&gt;, and by default will have a value of 1.0 inside it.  If the <b>-gaussian</b> option
              is specified, the values inside the ROI will instead form a gaussian with the specified  value  of
              sigma, normalized so that the sum of the nonzero values in the metric column is 1.0.  The &lt;method&gt;
              argument  to  <b>-overlap-logic</b> must be one of ALLOW, CLOSEST, or EXCLUDE.  ALLOW is the default, and
              means that ROIs are treated independently and may  overlap.   CLOSEST  means  that  ROIs  may  not
              overlap,  and  that  no ROI contains vertices that are closer to a different seed vertex.  EXCLUDE
              means that ROIs may not overlap, and that any vertex within range of more than one  ROI  does  not
              belong to any ROI.

              [-recenter] - recenter the sphere by means of the bounding box

              This command may be useful if you have used <b>-surface-resample</b> to  resample  a  sphere,  which  can
              suffer  from  problems  generally not present in <b>-surface-sphere-project-unproject</b>.  If the sphere
              should already be centered around the origin, using <b>-recenter</b> may still shift it  slightly  before
              changing the radius, which is likely to be undesireable.

              If  &lt;sphere-in&gt;  is not close to spherical, or not centered around the origin and <b>-recenter</b> is not

              recommended for surface resampling, but is provided for completeness.

              The  BARYCENTRIC  method  is  generally  recommended for anatomical surfaces, in order to minimize

       <b>-surface-sphere-project-unproject</b> COPY REGISTRATION DEFORMATIONS TO DIFFERENT SPHERE

              wb_command <b>-surface-sphere-project-unproject</b>

              &lt;sphere-in&gt; - a sphere with the desired output mesh &lt;sphere-project-to&gt; -  a  sphere  that  aligns
              with sphere-in &lt;sphere-unproject-from&gt; - &lt;sphere-project-to&gt; deformed to the desired

              output space

              &lt;sphere-out&gt; - output - the output sphere

              Background:  A  surface registration starts with an input sphere, and moves its vertices around on
              the sphere until it matches the template data.  This means that the  registration  deformation  is
              actually  represented  as the difference between two separate files - the starting sphere, and the
              registered  sphere.   Since  the  starting  sphere  of  the  registration  may  not  have   vertex
              correspondence  to  any  other  sphere  (often,  it is a native sphere), it can be inconvenient to
              manipulate or compare these deformations across subjects, etc.

              The purpose of this command is to be able to apply these deformations onto a  new  sphere  of  the
              user's  choice,  to  make it easier to compare or manipulate them.  Common uses are to concatenate
              two successive separate registrations (e.g. Human to Chimpanzee, and then Chimpanzee  to  Macaque)
              or inversion (for dedrifting or symmetric registration schemes).

              &lt;sphere-in&gt;  must  already  be  considered  to  be  in  alignment  with one of the two ends of the
              registration (if your registration is Human to Chimpanzee, &lt;sphere-in&gt; must be  in  register  with
              either Human or Chimpanzee).  The 'project-to' sphere must be the side of the registration that is
              aligned  with &lt;sphere-in&gt; (if your registration is Human to Chimpanzee, and &lt;sphere-in&gt; is aligned
              with Human, then 'project-to' should be the original Human sphere).  The  'unproject-from'  sphere
              must be the remaining sphere of the registration (original vs deformed/registered).  The output is
              as  if you had run the same registration with &lt;sphere-in&gt; as the starting sphere, in the direction
              of deforming the 'project-to' sphere to create the 'unproject-from' sphere.

              Note that this command cannot check for you what spheres are aligned with other spheres, and using
              the wrong spheres or in the incorrect order will not necessarily cause an error message.  In  some
              cases, it may be useful to use a new, arbitrary sphere as the input, which can be created with the
              <b>-surface-create-sphere</b> command.

              Example  1: You have a Human to Chimpanzee registration, and a Chimpanzee to Macaque registration,
              and want to combine them.  If you use the Human sphere registered to Chimpanzee as sphere-in,  the
              Chimpanzee  standard  sphere  as  project-to,  and  the Chimpanzee sphere registered to Macaque as
              unproject-from, the output will be the Human sphere in register with the Macaque.

              Example 2: You have a Human to Chimpanzee registration, but what you really want is  the  inverse,
              that  is,  the sphere as if you had run the registration from Chimpanzee to Human.  If you use the
              Chimpanzee standard sphere as sphere-in, the Human sphere registered to Chimpanzee as  project-to,
              and  the  standard  Human  sphere  as  unproject-from, the output will be the Chimpanzee sphere in
              register with the Human.

              Technical details: Each vertex of &lt;sphere-in&gt; is projected to a triangle  of  &lt;sphere-project-to&gt;,
              and   its   new  position  is  determined  by  the  position  of  the  corresponding  triangle  in
              &lt;sphere-unproject-from&gt;.  The output is a sphere with the topology of &lt;sphere-in&gt;, but coordinates
              shifted   by   the    deformation    from    &lt;sphere-project-to&gt;    to    &lt;sphere-unproject-from&gt;.
              &lt;sphere-project-to&gt;  and  &lt;sphere-unproject-from&gt;  must  have the same topology as each other, but
              &lt;sphere-in&gt; may have any topology.

              table

       Creates a label volume from an integer-valued volume file.
              The label

              name  and  color  information  is stored in the volume header in a nifti extension, with a similar
              format as  in  caret5,  see  <b>-volume-help</b>.   You  may  specify  the  empty  string  (use  "")  for
              &lt;label-list-file&gt;, which will be treated as if it is an empty file.  The label list file must have
              the following format (2 lines per label):

              &lt;labelname&gt; &lt;key&gt; &lt;red&gt; &lt;green&gt; &lt;blue&gt; &lt;alpha&gt; ...

              Label  names  are  specified  on a separate line from their value and color, in order to let label
              names contain spaces.  Whitespace is trimmed from both ends of the label name, but is kept  if  it
              is in the middle of a label.  Do not specify the "unlabeled" key in the file, it is assumed that 0
              means  not  labeled unless <b>-unlabeled-value</b> is specified.  The value of &lt;key&gt; specifies what value
              in the imported file should be used as this label (these same key values  are  also  used  in  the
              output  file).   The  values of &lt;red&gt;, &lt;green&gt;, &lt;blue&gt; and &lt;alpha&gt; must be integers from 0 to 255,
              and will specify the color the label is drawn as (alpha  of  255  means  fully  opaque,  which  is
              probably what you want).

              By default, it will create new label names with names like LABEL_5 for any values encountered that
              are  not  mentioned  in  the list file, specify <b>-discard-others</b> to instead set these values to the
              "unlabeled" key.

              &lt;subvolume&gt; - the subvolume number or name

              &lt;remap-file&gt; should have lines of the form 'oldkey newkey', like so:

              3 5 5 8 8 2

              This  would change the current label with key '3' to use the key '5' instead, 5 would use 8, and 8
              would use 2.  Any collision in key values results in the label that was not specified in the remap
              file getting remapped to an otherwise unused key.  Remapping more than one key  to  the  same  new
              key,  or  the  same  key  to more than one new key, results in an error.  This will not change the
              appearance of the file when displayed, as it will change the key values in the data  at  the  same
              time.

              The ribbon mapping method

              constructs a polyhedron from the vertex's neighbors on each surface, and estimates the  amount  of
              this  polyhedron's  volume  that  falls  inside  any  nearby  voxels,  to use as the weights for a
              popularity comparison.  If <b>-thin-columns</b> is specified, the polyhedron uses the edge midpoints  and
              triangle  centroids,  so  that  neighboring  vertices do not have overlapping polyhedra.  This may
              require increasing <b>-voxel-subdiv</b> to get enough samples in each voxel to reliably land inside these
              smaller polyhedra.  The volume ROI is useful to exclude  partial  volume  effects  of  voxels  the
              surfaces  pass  through,  and  will  cause the mapping to ignore voxels that don't have a positive
              value in the mask.  The subdivision number specifies how it approximates the amount of the  volume
              the  polyhedron  intersects,  by  splitting each voxel into NxNxN pieces, and checking whether the
              center of each piece is inside the polyhedron.  If you have very large voxels, consider increasing
              this if you get unexpected unlabeled vertices in your output.

              [-repeat] - reuse a single subvolume for each subvolume of calculation

       This command evaluates &lt;expression&gt; at each voxel independently.
              There

              must  be  at least one <b>-var</b> option (to get the volume space from), even if the &lt;name&gt; specified in
              it isn't used in &lt;expression&gt;.  All volumes must have the same volume space.   Filenames  are  not
              valid  in  &lt;expression&gt;,  use a variable name and a <b>-var</b> option with matching &lt;name&gt; to specify an
              input file.  If the <b>-subvolume</b> option is given to any <b>-var</b> option, only one subvolume is used from
              that file.  If <b>-repeat</b> is specified, the file must either have only one  subvolume,  or  have  the
              <b>-subvolume</b>  option  specified.   All  files  that  don't  use <b>-repeat</b> must have the same number of
              subvolumes requested to be used.  The format of &lt;expression&gt; is as follows:

              Expressions consist of constants, variables,  operators,  parentheses,  and  functions,  in  infix
              notation,  such  as  'exp(<b>-x</b>  +  3)  *  scale'.   Variables  are  strings of any length, using the
              characters a-z, A-Z, 0-9, and _, but may not take the name of a named constant.  Currently,  there
              is only one named constant, PI.  The operators are +, -, *, /, ^, &gt;, &lt;, &gt;=, &lt;=, ==, !=, !, &amp;&amp;, ||.
              These behave as in C, except that ^ is exponentiation, i.e. pow(x, y), and takes higher precedence
              than  other  binary  operators  (also, '-3^-4^-5' means '-(3^(-(4^-5)))').  The &lt;=, &gt;=, ==, and !=
              operators are given a small amount of wiggle room, equal to one millionth of the  smaller  of  the
              absolute values of the values being compared.

              Comparison  and  logical  operators  return  0 or 1, you can do masking with expressions like 'x *
              (mask &gt; 0)'.  For all logical operators, an input is considered true iff it  is  greater  than  0.
              The expression '0 &lt; x &lt; 5' is not syntactically wrong, but it will NOT do what is desired, because
              it  is evaluated left to right, i.e. '((0 &lt; x) &lt; 5)', which will always return 1, as both possible
              results of a comparison are less than 5.  A warning is generated if an expression of this type  is
              detected.  Use something like 'x &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; x &lt; 5' to get the desired behavior.

              Whitespace  between  elements  is  ignored,  ' sin ( 2 * x ) ' is equivalent to 'sin(2*x)', but 's
              in(2*x)' is an error.  Implied multiplication is not allowed, the expression '2x' will  be  parsed
              as  a  variable.   Parentheses  are  (),  do not use [] or {}.  Functions require parentheses, the
              expression 'sin x' is an error.

              By default, smooths all subvolumes with

              Threshold-free  cluster  enhancement  is  a  method to increase the relative value of regions that
              would form clusters in a standard thresholding test.   This  is  accomplished  by  evaluating  the
              integral of:

              e(h, p)^E * h^H * dh

              at each voxel p, where h ranges from 0 to the maximum value in the data, and e(h, p) is the extent
              of  the  cluster  containing  voxel  p  at threshold h.  Negative values are similarly enhanced by
              negating the data, running the same process, and negating the result.

              This method  is  explained  in:  Smith  SM,  Nichols  TE.,  "Threshold-free  cluster  enhancement:
              addressing  problems  of  smoothing,  threshold dependence and localisation in cluster inference."

              [-subvol-select] - select a single subvolume to map

              &lt;subvol&gt; - the subvolume number or name

       You must specify exactly one mapping method.
              Enclosing voxel uses the

              value from the voxel the vertex lies inside, while trilinear does a 3D linear interpolation  based
              on the voxels immediately on each side of the vertex's position.

              The ribbon mapping method constructs a polyhedron from the vertex's neighbors on each surface, and
              estimates  the  amount  of this polyhedron's volume that falls inside any nearby voxels, to use as
              the weights for sampling.  If <b>-thin-columns</b> is specified, the polyhedron uses the  edge  midpoints
              and  triangle centroids, so that neighboring vertices do not have overlapping polyhedra.  This may
              require increasing <b>-voxel-subdiv</b> to get enough samples in each voxel to reliably land inside these
              smaller polyhedra.  The volume ROI is useful to exclude  partial  volume  effects  of  voxels  the
              surfaces  pass  through,  and  will  cause the mapping to ignore voxels that don't have a positive
              value in the mask.  The subdivision number specifies how it approximates the amount of the  volume
              the  polyhedron  intersects,  by  splitting each voxel into NxNxN pieces, and checking whether the
              center of each piece is inside the polyhedron.  If you have very large voxels, consider increasing
              this if you get zeros in your output.  The <b>-gaussian</b> option makes it  act  more  like  the  myelin
              method,  where  the  distance  of  a  voxel  from  &lt;surface&gt; is used to downweight the voxel.  The
              <b>-interpolate</b> suboption, instead of doing a weighted  average  of  voxels,  interpolates  from  the
              volume  at  the subdivided points inside the ribbon.  If using both <b>-interpolate</b> and the <b>-weighted</b>
              suboption  to  <b>-volume-roi</b>,  the  roi  volume  weights  are  linearly  interpolated,  unless   the
              <b>-interpolate</b>  method  is  ENCLOSING_VOXEL, in which case ENCLOSING_VOXEL is also used for sampling
              the roi volume weights.

              The myelin style method uses part of the caret5 myelin mapping command to do the mapping: for each
              surface vertex, take all voxels that are in a cylinder with radius and height  equal  to  cortical
              thickness,  centered  on  the vertex and aligned with the surface normal, and that are also within
              the ribbon ROI, and apply a gaussian kernel with the specified sigma to them to get the weights to
              use.   The  <b>-legacy-bug</b>  flag  reverts  to  the  unintended  behavior  present  from  the  initial
              implementation up to and including v1.2.3, which had only the tangential cutoff and a bounding box
              intended to be larger than where the cylinder cutoff should have been.

       <b>-volume-vector-operation</b> DO A VECTOR OPERATION ON VOLUME FILES

              wb_command <b>-volume-vector-operation</b>

              &lt;vectors-a&gt;  -  first  vector input file &lt;vectors-b&gt; - second vector input file &lt;operation&gt; - what

              [-normalize-output] - normalize output vectors (not valid for dot

              product)

              [-magnitude] - output the magnitude of the result (not valid for dot

              product)

              Does a vector operation on two volume files (that must have a multiple of 3  subvolumes).   Either
              of  the inputs may have multiple vectors (more than 3 subvolumes), but not both (at least one must
              have exactly 3 subvolumes).  The <b>-magnitude</b> and <b>-normalize-output</b> options  may  not  be  specified
              together, or with the DOT operation.  The &lt;operation&gt; parameter must be one of the following:

       <b>-volume-warpfield-affine-regression</b> REGRESS AFFINE FROM WARPFIELD

              wb_command <b>-volume-warpfield-affine-regression</b>

              [-roi] - only consider voxels within a mask (e.g., a brain mask)

              &lt;roi-vol&gt; - the mask volume

              [-fnirt] - input is a fnirt warpfield

              &lt;source-volume&gt; - the source volume used when generating the fnirt

              warpfield

              [-flirt-out] - write output as a flirt matrix rather than a world

              coordinate   transform   &lt;source-volume&gt;  -  the  volume  you  want  to  apply  the  transform  to
              &lt;target-volume&gt; - the target space you want the transformed volume to

              match

              For all voxels in the warpfield, do a regression that predicts the post-warp coordinate  from  the
              source  coordinate.   When  <b>-roi</b> is specified, only consider voxels with a value greater than 0 in
              &lt;roi-vol&gt;.

              The default is to expect the warpfield to be in relative world  coordinates  (mm  space),  and  to
              write the output as a world affine (mm space to mm space).  If you are using FSL-created files and
              utilities, specify <b>-fnirt</b> and <b>-flirt</b> as needed, as their coordinate conventions are different.

              &lt;roi-volume&gt; - the roi, as a volume file

              [-match-maps] - each subvolume of input uses the corresponding

              [-sum] - compute weighted sum

              [-show-map-name] - print map index and name before each output

              For  each  subvolume  of  the  input,  a  line  of  text  is printed, resulting from the specified
              operation.  If <b>-weight-volume</b> is not specified, each voxel's volume is used.   Use  <b>-subvolume</b>  to
              only  give  output  for  a single subvolume.  If the <b>-roi</b> option is used without <b>-match-maps</b>, then
              each line will contain as many numbers as there are  maps  in  the  ROI  file,  separated  by  tab
              characters.  Exactly one of <b>-mean</b>, <b>-stdev</b>, <b>-percentile</b> or <b>-sum</b> must be specified.

              Using <b>-sum</b> without <b>-weight-volume</b> is equivalent to integrating with respect to volume.
