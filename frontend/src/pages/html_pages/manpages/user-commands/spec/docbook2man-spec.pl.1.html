</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       docbook2man-spec.pl - convert DocBook RefEntries to man pages

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>sgmlspl</b> <b>docbook2man-spec.pl</b>

       <b>onsgmls</b> [ <u>sgml</u> <u>document</u> ]<b>|</b> <b>sgmlspl</b> <b>docbook2man-spec.pl</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>docbook2man</b>  is a sgmlspl spec file that produced man pages (using the -man macros) from DocBook RefEntry
       markup.

       The program reads ESIS produced by onsgmls (or other SGML parsers) from standard input.  Markup not found
       in RefEntry is discarded.

       Its output, the converted man pages, are written to the current directory.  If RefMeta information is not
       specified in a RefEntry, then the man page will be written to standard output.

       The file <u>manpage.links</u> will also be created, which contains any aliases of the manpages generated.   This
       file is in the format:

       <u>&lt;man</u> <u>page&gt;</u> <u>&lt;alias</u>
       <u>manpage&gt;</u>

       The  <u>manpage.refs</u>  file  keeps track of XRef references.  Note that if the input document has any forward
       references, then <b>docbook2man</b> may have to be invoked twice  (the  first  time  updating  <u>manpage.refs</u>)  to
       resolve them.

</pre><h4><b>REQUIREMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       The SGMLSpm package from CPAN.  This package includes the sgmlspl script that is also needed.

</pre><h4><b>LIMITATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Trying <b>docbook2man</b> on non-DocBook or non-conformant SGML results in undefined behavior. :-)

       This program is a slow, dodgy Perl script.

       This  program does not come close to supporting all the possible markup in DocBook, and may produce wrong
       output in some cases with supported markup.

</pre><h4><b>TO</b> <b>DO</b></h4><pre>
       Obvious stuff:

       • Fix <b>docbook2man</b> breakages found in the test documents, especially <u>weird.sgml</u>.

       • Add new element handling and fix existing handling.  Be robust.

       • Produce cleanest, readable man output as possible (unlike some other converters).  Follow Linux  <b><a href="../man7/man.7.html">man</a></b>(7)
         convention.   As conversion to man pages is usually not done very often, it is better to be slower/more
         complicated than to produce wrong output.  Also if someone wants to give up using DocBook for  whatever
         reason, the last-converted man pages can then be maintained manually.

       • Make  it faster. I think most of the speed problems so far is with parsing ESIS.  Rewrite <u>SGMLS.pm</u> with
         C and/or get input directly from <b>SP</b>.

       • Support other (human) languages.  But what to do with non-ASCII charsets?  SGMLSpm doesn't report  them
         and  <b>roff</b>  does  not  grok  them.   [Comment:  text  after  enclosed  lists  (and SS blocks) will break
         docbook2man] If we do this, more people can use DocBook.
