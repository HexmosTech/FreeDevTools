</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       uucp - Unix to Unix copy

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>uucp</b> [ options ] source-file destination-file

       <b>uucp</b> [ options ] source-file... destination-directory

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>uucp</u>  command  copies  files  between systems.  Each <u>file</u> argument is either a pathname on the local
       machine or is of the form

              system!path

       which is interpreted as being on a remote system.  In the first form, the contents of the first file  are
       copied to the second.  In the second form, each source file is copied into the destination directory.

       A file be transferred to or from <u>system2</u> via <u>system1</u> by using

              system1!system2!path.

       Any  pathname that does not begin with / or ~ will be appended to the current directory (unless the <b>-W</b> or
       <b>--noexpand</b> option is used); this resulting path will  not  necessarily  exist  on  a  remote  system.   A
       pathname  beginning  with a simple ~ starts at the UUCP public directory; a pathname beginning with ~name
       starts at the home directory of the named user.  The ~ is interpreted on the  appropriate  system.   Note
       that some shells will interpret a simple ~ to the local home directory before <u>uucp</u> sees it; to avoid this
       the ~ must be quoted.

       Shell  metacharacters  ?  *  [  ]  are interpreted on the appropriate system, assuming they are quoted to
       prevent the shell from interpreting them first.

       The copy does not take place immediately, but is queued up for the  <u>uucico</u>  (8)  daemon;  the  daemon  is
       started  immediately  unless the <b>-r</b> or <b>--nouucico</b> switch is given.  In any case, the next time the remote
       system is called the file(s) will be copied.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The following options may be given to <u>uucp.</u>

       <b>-c,</b> <b>--nocopy</b>
            Do not copy local source files to the spool directory.  If they are removed before  being  processed
            by  the <u>uucico</u> (8) daemon, the copy will fail.  The files must be readable by the <u>uucico</u> (8) daemon,
            and by the invoking user.   This is the default.

       <b>-C,</b> <b>--copy</b>
            Copy local source files to the spool directory.

       <b>-d,</b> <b>--directories</b>
            Create all necessary directories when doing the copy.  This is the default.

       <b>-f,</b> <b>--nodirectories</b>
            If any necessary directories do not exist for the destination path, abort the copy.

       <b>-R,</b> <b>--recursive</b>
            If any of the source file names are directories, copy their contents recursively to the  destination
            (which must itself be a directory).

       <b>-g</b> <b>grade,</b> <b>--grade</b> <b>grade</b>
            Set  the grade of the file transfer command.  Jobs of a higher grade are executed first.  Grades run
            0 ... 9 A ... Z a ... z from high to low.

       <b>-m,</b> <b>--mail</b>
            Report completion or failure of the file transfer by <u>mail</u> (1).

       <b>-n</b> <b>user,</b> <b>--notify</b> <b>user</b>
            Report completion or failure of the file transfer by <u>mail</u> (1)  to  the  named  user  on  the  remote
            system.

       <b>-r,</b> <b>--nouucico</b>
            Do not start <u>uucico</u> (8) daemon immediately; merely queue up the file transfer for later execution.

       <b>-j,</b> <b>--jobid</b>
            Print  jobid  on  standard  output.   The  job may be later cancelled by passing the jobid to the <b>-k</b>
            switch of <u>uustat</u> (1).  It is possible for some complex operations to produce more than one jobid, in
            which case each will be printed on a separate line.  For example
                 uucp sys1!~user1/file1 sys2!~user2/file2 ~user3
            will generate two separate jobs, one for the system <u>sys1</u> and one for the system <u>sys2.</u>

       <b>-W,</b> <b>--noexpand</b>
            Do not prepend remote relative path names with the current directory.

       <b>-t,</b> <b>--uuto</b>
            This option is used by the <u>uuto</u> shell script.  It causes <u>uucp</u> to interpret  the  final  argument  as
            <u>system!user.</u>   The file(s) are sent to <u><a href="file:~/receive/USER/LOCAL">~/receive/USER/LOCAL</a></u> on the remote system, where <u>USER</u> is from
            the final argument and <u>LOCAL</u> is the local UUCP system name.  Also, <u>uucp</u> will act as though  <u>--notify</u>
            <u>user</u> were specified.

       <b>-x</b> <b>type,</b> <b>--debug</b> <b>type</b>
            Turn  on particular debugging types.  The following types are recognized: abnormal, chat, handshake,
            uucp-proto, proto, port, config, spooldir, execute,  incoming,  outgoing.   Only  abnormal,  config,
            spooldir and execute are meaningful for <u>uucp.</u>

            Multiple  types may be given, separated by commas, and the <b>--debug</b> option may appear multiple times.
            A number may also be given, which will turn on that many types from the foregoing list; for example,
            <b>--debug</b> <b>2</b> is equivalent to <b>--debug</b> <b>abnormal,chat.</b>

       <b>-I</b> <b>file,</b> <b>--config</b> <b>file</b>
            Set configuration file to use.  This option may not  be  available,  depending  upon  how  <u>uucp</u>  was
            compiled.

       <b>-v,</b> <b>--version</b>
            Report version information and exit.

       <b>--help</b>
            Print a help message and exit.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Some of the options are dependent on the capabilities of the <u>uucico</u> (8) daemon on the remote system.

       The <u>-n</u> and <u>-m</u> switches do not work when transferring a file from one remote system to another.

       File modes are not preserved, except for the execute bit.  The resulting file is owned by the uucp user.
