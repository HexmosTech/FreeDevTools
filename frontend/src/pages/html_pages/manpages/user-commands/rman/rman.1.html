       PolyglotMan,  rman  - reverse compile man pages from formatted form to a number of source formats: ASCII,
       roff, TkMan, Tk, Sections, HTML, SGML, MIME, LaTeX, LaTeX2e, RTF, POD.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       rman [ <u>options</u> ] [ <u>file</u> ]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Up-to-date instructions can be found at <a href="http://polyglotman.sourceforge.net/rman.html">http://polyglotman.sourceforge.net/rman.html</a>

       <u>PolyglotMan</u>  takes man pages from most of the popular flavors of UNIX and transforms them into any  of  a
       number  of  text  source formats. PolyglotMan was formerly known as RosettaMan. The name of the binary is
       still called <u>rman</u>, for scripts that  depend  on  that  name;  mnemonically,  just  think  "reverse  man".
       Previously  <u>PolyglotMan</u>  required pages to be formatted by <a href="../man1/nroff.1.html">nroff</a>(1) prior to its processing. With version
       3.0, it <u>prefers</u> <u>[tn]roff</u> <u>source</u> and usually produces results that are better yet. And  source  processing
       is the only way to translate tables. Source format translation is not as mature as formatted, however, so
       try formatted translation as a backup.

       In  parsing [tn]roff source, one could implement an arbitrarily large subset of [tn]roff, which I did not
       and will not do, so the results can be off. I did implement a significant subset of  those  used  in  man
       pages,  however,  including  tbl  (but  not eqn), if tests, and general macro definitions, so usually the
       results look great. If they don't, format the page with  nroff  before  sending  it  to  PolyglotMan.  If
       PolyglotMan  doesn't  recognize a key macro used by a large class of pages, however, e-mail me the source
       and a uuencoded nroff-formatted page and I'll see what I can do. When running PolyglotMan with  man  page
       source that includes or redirects to other [tn]roff source using the .so (source or inclusion) macro, you
       should be in the parent directory of the page, since pages are written with this assumption. For example,
       if you are translating /usr/share/man/man1/ls.1, first cd into /usr/share/man.

       <u>PolyglotMan</u>   accepts man pages from: SunOS, Sun Solaris, Hewlett-Packard HP-UX, AT&amp;T System V, OSF/1 aka
       Digital UNIX, DEC Ultrix, SGI IRIX, Linux, FreeBSD, SCO. Source processing works for: SunOS, Sun Solaris,
       Hewlett-Packard HP-UX, AT&amp;T System V, OSF/1 aka Digital UNIX, DEC Ultrix. It can produce printable ASCII-
       only (control characters stripped), section headers-only,  Tk,  TkMan,  [tn]roff  (traditional  man  page
       source),  XML,  HTML, MIME, LaTeX, LaTeX2e, RTF, Perl 5 POD. A modular architecture permits easy addition
       of additional output formats.

       The latest version of PolyglotMan is available from <u><a href="http://polyglotman.sourceforge.net/">http://polyglotman.sourceforge.net/</a></u> .

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The following options should not be used with any others and  exit  PolyglotMan  without  processing  any
       input.

       -h|--help      Show list of command line options and exit.

       -v|--version   Show version number and exit.

       <u>You</u> <u>should</u> <u>specify</u> <u>the</u> <u>filter</u> <u>first,</u> <u>as</u> <u>this</u> <u>sets</u> <u>a</u> <u>number</u> <u>of</u> <u>parameters,</u> <u>and</u> <u>then</u> <u>specify</u> <u>other</u> <u>options.</u>

       -f|--filter &lt;ASCII|roff|TkMan|Tk|Sections|HTML|XML|MIME|LaTeX|LaTeX2e|RTF|POD&gt;
                      Set the output filter. Defaults to ASCII.

       -S|--source    PolyglotMan tries to automatically determine whether its input is source or formatted; use
                      this option to declare source input.

       -F|--format|--formatted
                      PolyglotMan tries to automatically determine whether its input is source or formatted; use
                      this option to declare formatted input.

       -l|--title <u>printf-string</u>
                      In HTML mode this sets the &lt;TITLE&gt; of the man pages, given the same parameters as <u>-r</u> .

       -r|--reference|--manref <u>printf-string</u>
                      In  HTML  and  XML  modes this sets the URL form by which to retrieve other man pages. The
                      string can use two supplied parameters: the man  page  name  and  its  section.  (See  the
                      Examples  section.)   If  the  string  is null (as if set from a shell by "-r ''"), `-' or
                      `off', then man page references will not be HREFs, just set in  italics.  If  your  printf
                      supports XPG3 positions specifier, this can be quite flexible.

       -V|--volumes <u>&lt;colon-separated</u> <u>list&gt;</u>
                      Set  the list of valid volumes to check against when looking for cross-references to other
                      man pages. Defaults to <u>1:2:3:4:5:6:7:8:9:o:l:n:p</u> (volume names can be multicharacter).  If
                      an  non-whitespace  string in the page is immediately followed by a left parenthesis, then
                      one of the valid volumes, and ends  with  optional  other  characters  and  then  a  right
                      parenthesis--then  that  string is reported as a reference to another manual page. If this
                      -V string starts with an equals sign, then no optional characters are allowed between  the
                      match  to  the  list  of  valids and the right parenthesis. (This option is needed for SCO
                      UNIX.)

       The following options apply only when formatted pages are given as input. They do not  apply  to  or  are
       always handled correctly with the source.

       -b|--subsections
                      Try to recognize subsection titles in addition to section titles.  This can cause problems
                      on some UNIX flavors.

       -K|--nobreak   Indicate manual pages don't have page breaks, so don't look for footers and headers around
                      them.  (Older  nroff  -man  macros always put in page breaks, but lately some vendors have
                      realized that printouts are made through <a href="../man1/troff.1.html">troff</a>(1), whereas nroff -man is  used  to  format
                      pages  for  reading  on  screen, and so have eliminated page breaks.) <u>PolyglotMan</u>  usually
                      gets this right even without this flag.

       -k|--keep      Keep headers and footers, as a canonical report at the end of the  page.  changeleft  Move
                      changebars, such as those found in the Tcl/Tk manual pages, to the left. --&gt; notaggressive
                      <u>Disable</u>   aggressive  man  page  parsing.  Aggressive manual, which is on by default, page
                      parsing elides headers and footers, identifies sections and more. --&gt;

       -n|--name <u>name</u> Set name of man page (used in roff format). If the filename is given in the form " <u>name</u>  .
                      <u>section</u>  ", the name and section are automatically determined. If the page is being parsed
                      from [tn]roff source and it has a .TH line, this information is extracted from that line.

       -p|--paragraph paragraph mode toggle. The filter determines whether lines should be  linebroken  as  they
                      were  by  nroff,  or  whether  lines should be flowed together into paragraphs. Mainly for
                      internal use.

       -s|section <u>#</u>   Set volume (aka section) number of man  page  (used  in  roff  format).   tables  Turn  on
                      aggressive table parsing. --&gt;

       -t|--tabstops <u>#</u>
                      For  those  macros sets that use tabs in place of spaces where possible in order to reduce
                      the number of characters used, set tabstops every <u>#</u>  columns. Defaults to 8.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b> <b>ON</b> <b>FILTER</b> <b>TYPES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>ROFF</b>
       Some flavors of UNIX ship man page without [tn]roff source, making one's laser printer little more than a
       laser-powered daisy wheel.  This filter tries to intuit the original [tn]roff directives, which can  then
       be recompiled by [tn]roff.

   <b>TkMan</b>
       <a href="../man1/TkMan.1.html">TkMan</a>(1),  a hypertext man page browser, uses <u>PolyglotMan</u> to show man pages without the (usually) useless
       headers and footers on each page. It also collects section and (optionally) subsection heads  for  direct
       access  from  a  pulldown  menu.  TkMan  and Tcl/Tk, the toolkit in which it's written, are available via
       anonymous ftp from <u><a href="ftp://ftp.smli.com/pub/tcl/">ftp://ftp.smli.com/pub/tcl/</a></u>

   <b>Tk</b>
       This option outputs the text in a series of Tcl lists consisting of  text-tags  pairs,  where  tag  names
       roughly  correspond  to  HTML.   This  output  can  be  inserted  into  a Tk text widget by doing an <u>eval</u>
       <u>&lt;textwidget&gt;</u> <u>insert</u> <u>end</u> <u>&lt;text&gt;</u> . This format should be relatively easily parsible by other programs  that
       want both the text and the tags. See also ASCII.

   <b>ASCII</b>
       When  printed on a line printer, man pages try to produce special text effects by overstriking characters
       with themselves (to produce bold) and underscores (underlining). Other text processing software, such  as
       text  editors,  searchers,  and  indexers,  must  counteract  this.  The  ASCII  filter  strips away this
       formatting. Piping nroff output through <u>col</u> <u>-b</u>  also strips away this formatting, but  it  leaves  behind
       unsightly page headers and footers. Also see Tk.

   <b>Sections</b>
       Dumps section and (optionally) subsection titles. This might be useful for another program that processes
       man pages.

   <b>HTML</b>
       With  a simple extension to a HTTP server for <a href="../man1/Mosaic.1.html">Mosaic</a>(1) or other World Wide Web browser, <u>PolyglotMan</u>  can
       produce high quality HTML on the fly. Several such extensions and pointers to several others are included
       in <u>PolyglotMan</u> 's <u>contrib</u>  directory.

   <b>XML</b>
       This is appoaching the Docbook DTD, but I'm hoping that someone with a real interest in this will  polish
       the tags generated. Try it to see how close the tags are now.

   <b>MIME</b>
       MIME  (Multipurpose  Internet Mail Extensions) as defined by RFC 1563, good for consumption by MIME-aware
       e-mailers or as Emacs (&gt;=19.29) enriched documents.

   <b>LaTeX</b> <b>and</b> <b>LaTeX2e</b>
       Why not?

   <b>RTF</b>
       Use output on Mac or NeXT or whatever. Maybe take random man pages and integrate them better with  NeXT's
       documentation system.  Maybe NeXT has its own man page macros that do this.

   <b>PostScript</b> <b>and</b> <b>FrameMaker</b>
       To produce PostScript, use <u>groff</u>  or <u>psroff</u> . To produce FrameMaker MIF, use FrameMaker's builtin filter.
       In  both cases you need <u>[tn]roff</u>  source, so if you only have a formatted version of the manual page, use
       <u>PolyglotMan</u> 's roff filter first.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       To convert the <u>formatted</u>  man page named <u>ls.1</u>  back into [tn]roff source form:

       <u>rman</u> <u>-f</u> <u>roff</u> <u>/usr/local/man/cat1/ls.1</u> <u>&gt;</u> <u>/usr/local/man/man1/ls.1</u>

       Long man pages are often compressed to conserve space (compression is especially effective  on  formatted
       man  pages  as many of the characters are spaces). As it is a long man page, it probably has subsections,
       which we try to separate out (some macro sets don't distinguish subsections well enough  for  <u>PolyglotMan</u>
       to detect them). Let's convert this to LaTeX format:

       <u>pcat</u> <u>/usr/catman/a_man/cat1/automount.z</u> <u>|</u> <u>rman</u> <u>-b</u> <u>-n</u> <u>automount</u> <u>-s</u> <u>1</u> <u>-f</u> <u>latex</u> <u>&gt;</u> <u>automount.man</u>

       Alternatively, <u>man</u> <u>1</u> <u>automount</u> <u>|</u> <u>rman</u> <u>-b</u> <u>-n</u> <u>automount</u> <u>-s</u> <u>1</u> <u>-f</u> <u>latex</u> <u>&gt;</u> <u>automount.man</u>

       For HTML/Mosaic users, <u>PolyglotMan</u>  can, without modification of the source code, produce HTML links that
       point  to  other  HTML  man  pages  either  pregenerated  or  generated  on  the  fly. First let's assume
       pregenerated HTML versions of man pages stored in <u>/usr/share/man/html</u> .  Generate these  one-by-one  with
       the following form:
       <u>rman</u>      <u>-f</u>     <u>html</u>     <u>-r</u>     <u>'http:/usr/share/man/html/%s.%s.html'</u>     <u>/usr/share/man/cat1/ls.1</u>     <u>&gt;</u>
       <u>/usr/share/man/html/ls.1.html</u>

       If you've extended your HTML client to generate HTML on the fly you should use something like:
       <u>rman</u> <u>-f</u> <u>html</u> <u>-r</u> <u>'http:<a href="file:~/bin/man2html">~/bin/man2html</a>?%s:%s'</u> <u>/usr/share/man/cat1/ls.1</u>
       when generating HTML.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS/INCOMPATIBILITIES</b></h4><pre>
       <u>PolyglotMan</u>  is not perfect in all cases, but it usually does a good job, and in  any  case  reduces  the
       problem of converting man pages to light editing.

       Tables  in formatted pages, especially H-P's, aren't handled very well. Be sure to pass in source for the
       page to recognize tables.

       The man pager <u><a href="../man1/woman.1.html">woman</a></u>(1) applies its own idea of formatting for man pages, which can confuse <u>PolyglotMan</u>  .
       Bypass <u>woman</u>  by passing the formatted manual page text directly into <u>PolyglotMan</u> .

       The  [tn]roff  output format uses fB to turn on boldface. If your macro set requires .B, you'll have to a
       postprocess the <u>PolyglotMan</u> output.
