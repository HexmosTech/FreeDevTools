       diskseek, diskseekd - disk seek daemon; simulates Messy Dos' drive cleaning effect

</pre><h4><b>Note</b></h4><pre>
       This  manpage  has  been  automatically  generated  from  fdutils's texinfo documentation.  However, this
       process is only approximative, and some items, such as cross-references, footnotes and indices  are  lost
       in  this  translation  process.   Indeed,  these  items have no appropriate representation in the manpage
       format.  Moreover, only the items specific  to  each  command  have  been  translated,  and  the  general
       information about fdutils has been dropped in the manpage version.  Thus I strongly advise you to use the
       original texinfo doc.

       *      To generate a printable copy from the texinfo doc, run the following commands:

                     <b>./configure;</b> <b>make</b> <b>dvi;</b> <b>dvips</b> <b>fdutils.dvi</b>

       *      To generate a HTML copy,  run:

                     <b>./configure;</b> <b>make</b> <b>html</b>

              A pre-made HTML can be found at: `<a href="http://www.tux.org/pub/knaff/fdutils">http://www.tux.org/pub/knaff/fdutils</a>'

       *      To generate an info copy (browsable using emacs' info mode), run:

                     <b>./configure;</b> <b>make</b> <b>info</b>

       The  texinfo doc looks most pretty when printed or as HTML.  Indeed, in the info version certain examples
       are difficult to read due to the quoting conventions used in info.

</pre><h4><b>Description</b></h4><pre>
       Several people have noticed that Linux has a bad  tendency  of  killing  floppy  drives.  These  failures
       remained  completely  mysterious,  until  somebody  noticed  that  they  were  due to huge layers of dust
       accumulating in the floppy drives. This cannot happen  under  Messy  Dos,  because  this  excuse  for  an
       operating  system  is  so  unstable  that  it  crashes roughly every 20 minutes (actually less if you are
       running Windows).  When rebooting, the BIOS seeks the drive, and by doing this, it shakes the dust out of
       the drive mechanism. diskseekd simulates this effect by seeking the drive periodically.  If it is  called
       as diskseek, the drive is sought only once.

</pre><h4><b>Options</b></h4><pre>
       The syntax for diskseekd is as follows:

          diskseekd [-d <u>drive</u>] [-i <u>interval</u>] [-p <u>pidfile</u>]

       -d <u>drive</u>
              Selects the drive to seek.  By default, drive 0 (`/dev/fd0') is sought.

       -i <u>interval</u>
              Selects  the  cleaning interval, in seconds.  If the interval is 0, a single seek is done. This is
              useful when calling diskseek from a crontab.  The default is 1000 seconds (about 16  minutes)  for
              diskseekd and 0 for diskseek.

       -p <u>pidfile</u>
              Stores   the   process   id   of  the  diskseekd  daemon  into  <u>pidfile</u>  instead  of  the  default
              `/var/run/diskseekd.pid'.

</pre><h4><b>Bugs</b></h4><pre>
       1.     Other aspects of Messy Dos' flakiness are not simulated.

       2.     This section lacks a few smileys.
