</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       <b>gpg</b> - OpenPGP encryption and signing tool

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>gpg</b> [<b>--homedir</b> <u>dir</u>] [<b>--options</b> <u>file</u>] [<u>options</u>] <u>command</u> [<u>args</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>gpg</b>  is the OpenPGP part of the GNU Privacy Guard (GnuPG). It is a tool to provide digital encryption and
       signing services using the OpenPGP standard. <b>gpg</b> features complete key management and all the  bells  and
       whistles you would expect from a full OpenPGP implementation.

       There  are  two  main  versions  of GnuPG: GnuPG 1.x and GnuPG 2.x.  GnuPG 2.x supports modern encryption
       algorithms and thus should be preferred over GnuPG 1.x.  You only need to use GnuPG 1.x if your  platform
       doesn't  support  GnuPG  2.x,  or you need support for some features that GnuPG 2.x has deprecated, e.g.,
       decrypting data created with PGP-2 keys.

       If you are looking for version 1 of GnuPG, you may find that version installed under the name <b>gpg1</b>.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       The program returns 0 if there are no severe errors, 1 if at least a signature was bad, and  other  error
       codes for fatal errors.

       Note that signature verification requires exact knowledge of what has been signed and by whom it has been
       signed.   Using  only  the  return code is thus not an appropriate way to verify a signature by a script.
       Either make proper use or the status codes or use the <b>gpgv</b> tool which has been designed to make signature
       verification easy for scripts.

</pre><h4><b>WARNINGS</b></h4><pre>
       Use a good password for your user account and make sure that all security issues are always fixed on your
       machine.  Also employ diligent physical protection to your machine.  Consider to use a good passphrase as
       a last resort protection to your secret key in the case your machine gets stolen.  It is  important  that
       your secret key is never leaked.  Using an easy to carry around token or smartcard with the secret key is
       often a advisable.

       If  you  are  going to verify detached signatures, make sure that the program knows about it; either give
       both filenames on the command line or use ‘-’ to specify STDIN.

       For scripted or other unattended use of <b>gpg</b> make sure to use the machine-parseable interface and not  the
       default interface which is intended for direct use by humans.  The machine-parseable interface provides a
       stable  and  well  documented  API  independent  of  the locale or future changes of <b>gpg</b>.  To enable this
       interface use the options <b>--with-colons</b> and <b>--status-fd</b>.  For certain operations the option  <b>--command-fd</b>
       may  come  handy  too.   See this man page and the file ‘<u>DETAILS</u>’ for the specification of the interface.
       Note that the GnuPG ``info'' pages as well as the PDF version of the GnuPG manual features a  chapter  on
       unattended  use of GnuPG.  As an alternative the library <b>GPGME</b> can be used as a high-level abstraction on
       top of that interface.

</pre><h4><b>INTEROPERABILITY</b></h4><pre>
       GnuPG tries to be a very flexible implementation of the OpenPGP standard. In particular, GnuPG implements
       many of the optional parts of the standard, such as the SHA-512 hash, and the ZLIB and BZIP2  compression
       algorithms. It is important to be aware that not all OpenPGP programs implement these optional algorithms
       and   that   by   forcing   their  use  via  the  <b>--cipher-algo</b>,  <b>--digest-algo</b>,  <b>--cert-digest-algo</b>,  or
       <b>--compress-algo</b> options in GnuPG, it is possible to create a perfectly valid  OpenPGP  message,  but  one
       that cannot be read by the intended recipient.

       There  are  dozens  of  variations  of OpenPGP programs available, and each supports a slightly different
       subset of these optional algorithms.  For example, until recently, no (unhacked) version of PGP supported
       the BLOWFISH cipher algorithm. A message using BLOWFISH simply could not  be  read  by  a  PGP  user.  By
       default,  GnuPG  uses  the  standard  OpenPGP  preferences system that will always do the right thing and
       create messages that are usable by all recipients, regardless of which OpenPGP  program  they  use.  Only
       override this safe default if you really know what you are doing.

       If  you  absolutely  must override the safe default, or if the preferences on a given key are invalid for
       some reason, you are far better off using the <b>--pgp6</b>, <b>--pgp7</b>, or <b>--pgp8</b> options. These options  are  safe
       as  they  do not force any particular algorithms in violation of OpenPGP, but rather reduce the available
       algorithms to a "PGP-safe" list.

</pre><h4><b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       Commands are not distinguished from options except for  the  fact  that  only  one  command  is  allowed.
       Generally speaking, irrelevant options are silently ignored, and may not be checked for correctness.

       <b>gpg</b>  may  be  run  with  no  commands.  In  this case it will print a warning perform a reasonable action
       depending on the type of file it is given as input (an encrypted message is  decrypted,  a  signature  is
       verified, a file containing keys is listed, etc.).

       If you run into any problems, please add the option <b>--verbose</b> to the invocation to see more diagnostics.

   <b>Commands</b> <b>not</b> <b>specific</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>function</b>

       <b>--version</b>
              Print  the  program  version  and  licensing  information.   Note  that you cannot abbreviate this
              command.

       <b>--help</b>
       <b>-h</b>     Print a usage message summarizing the most useful command-line  options.   Note  that  you  cannot
              arbitrarily abbreviate this command (though you can use its short form <b>-h</b>).

       <b>--warranty</b>
              Print warranty information.

       <b>--dump-options</b>
              Print a list of all available options and commands.  Note that you cannot abbreviate this command.

   <b>Commands</b> <b>to</b> <b>select</b> <b>the</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation</b>

       <b>--sign</b>
       <b>-s</b>     Sign  a  message.  This  command  may  be combined with <b>--encrypt</b> (to sign and encrypt a message),
              <b>--symmetric</b> (to sign and symmetrically encrypt a message), or both <b>--encrypt</b> and  <b>--symmetric</b>  (to
              sign and encrypt a message that can be decrypted using a secret key or a passphrase).  The signing
              key  is  chosen  by  default  or  can  be  set explicitly using the <b>--local-user</b> and <b>--default-key</b>
              options.

       <b>--clear-sign</b>
       <b>--clearsign</b>
              Make a cleartext signature.  The content in a cleartext signature is readable without any  special
              software.  OpenPGP  software  is  only  needed  to verify the signature.  cleartext signatures may
              modify end-of-line whitespace for platform independence and are not  intended  to  be  reversible.
              The  signing  key  is  chosen  by  default  or  can  be  set explicitly using the <b>--local-user</b> and
              <b>--default-key</b> options.

       <b>--detach-sign</b>
       <b>-b</b>     Make a detached signature.

       <b>--encrypt</b>
       <b>-e</b>     Encrypt data to one or more public keys. This command may be combined with  <b>--sign</b>  (to  sign  and
              encrypt  a message), <b>--symmetric</b> (to encrypt a message that can be decrypted using a secret key or
              a passphrase), or <b>--sign</b> and <b>--symmetric</b> together (for a signed  message  that  can  be  decrypted
              using a secret key or a passphrase).  <b>--recipient</b> and related options specify which public keys to
              use for encryption.

       <b>--symmetric</b>
       <b>-c</b>     Encrypt  with a symmetric cipher using a passphrase. The default symmetric cipher used is AES-128,
              but may be chosen with the <b>--cipher-algo</b> option. This command may be combined with <b>--sign</b>  (for  a
              signed  and symmetrically encrypted message), <b>--encrypt</b> (for a message that may be decrypted via a
              secret key or a passphrase), or <b>--sign</b> and <b>--encrypt</b> together (for a signed message  that  may  be
              decrypted  via  a  secret  key  or  a  passphrase).   <b>gpg</b> caches the passphrase used for symmetric
              encryption so that a decrypt  operation  may  not  require  that  the  user  needs  to  enter  the
              passphrase.  The option <b>--no-symkey-cache</b> can be used to disable this feature.

       <b>--store</b>
              Store only (make a simple literal data packet).

       <b>--decrypt</b>
       <b>-d</b>     Decrypt  the  file  given  on  the command line (or STDIN if no file is specified) and write it to
              STDOUT (or the file specified with <b>--output</b>). If the decrypted file is signed,  the  signature  is
              also verified. This command differs from the default operation, as it never writes to the filename
              which is included in the file and it rejects files that don't begin with an encrypted message.

       <b>--verify</b>
              Assume that the first argument is a signed file and verify it without generating any output.  With
              no  arguments,  the  signature  packet  is  read  from  STDIN.  If only one argument is given, the
              specified file is expected to include a complete signature.

              With more than one argument, the first argument should specify a file with  a  detached  signature
              and  the  remaining  files should contain the signed data. To read the signed data from STDIN, use
              ‘-’ as the second filename.  For security reasons, a detached signature will not read  the  signed
              material from STDIN if not explicitly specified.

              Note:  If  the  option <b>--batch</b> is not used, <b>gpg</b> may assume that a single argument is a file with a
              detached signature, and it will try to find a matching data file by  stripping  certain  suffixes.
              Using  this  historical feature to verify a detached signature is strongly discouraged; you should
              always specify the data file explicitly.

              Note: When verifying a cleartext signature, <b>gpg</b> verifies only what makes up the  cleartext  signed
              data  and  not  any  extra  data  outside  of the cleartext signature or the header lines directly
              following the dash marker line.  The option <b>--output</b> may be used to write out  the  actual  signed
              data,  but  there are other pitfalls with this format as well.  It is suggested to avoid cleartext
              signatures in favor of detached signatures.

              Note: To check whether a file was signed by a certain key the option <b>--assert-signer</b> can be  used.
              As  an  alternative  the <b>gpgv</b> tool can be used.  <b>gpgv</b> is designed to compare signed data against a
              list of trusted keys and returns with success only for a good signature.  It has  its  own  manual
              page.

       <b>--multifile</b>
              This  modifies  certain other commands to accept multiple files for processing on the command line
              or read from STDIN with each filename on a separate  line.  This  allows  for  many  files  to  be
              processed  at  once.  <b>--multifile</b>  may  currently  be  used  along  with  <b>--verify</b>, <b>--encrypt</b>, and
              <b>--decrypt</b>. Note that <b>--multifile</b> <b>--verify</b> may not be used with detached signatures.

       <b>--verify-files</b>
              Identical to <b>--multifile</b> <b>--verify</b>.

       <b>--encrypt-files</b>
              Identical to <b>--multifile</b> <b>--encrypt</b>.

       <b>--decrypt-files</b>
              Identical to <b>--multifile</b> <b>--decrypt</b>.

       <b>--list-keys</b>
       <b>-k</b>
       <b>--list-public-keys</b>
              List the specified keys.  If no keys are specified, then  all  keys  from  the  configured  public
              keyrings are listed.

              Never  use  the  output of this command in scripts or other programs.  The output is intended only
              for humans and its format is likely to change.  The <b>--with-colons</b> option emits  the  output  in  a
              stable, machine-parseable format, which is intended for use by scripts and other programs.

       <b>--list-secret-keys</b>
       <b>-K</b>     List  the specified secret keys.  If no keys are specified, then all known secret keys are listed.
              A <b>#</b> after the initial tags <b>sec</b> or <b>ssb</b> means that the secret key or subkey is currently not usable.
              We also say that this key has been taken offline (for example, a primary key can be taken  offline
              by  exporting  the  key using the command <b>--export-secret-subkeys</b>).  A <b>&gt;</b> after these tags indicate
              that the key is stored on a smartcard.  See also <b>--list-keys</b>.

       <b>--check-signatures</b>
       <b>--check-sigs</b>
              Same as <b>--list-keys</b>, but  the  key  signatures  are  verified  and  listed  too.   Note  that  for
              performance  reasons  the  revocation  status of a signing key is not shown.  This command has the
              same effect as using <b>--list-keys</b> with <b>--with-sig-check</b>.

              The status of the verification is indicated by a flag directly following the "sig" tag  (and  thus
              before  the  flags  described  below.   A  "!"  indicates that the signature has been successfully
              verified, a "-" denotes a bad signature and a "%" is used if an error occurred while checking  the
              signature  (e.g. a non supported algorithm).  Signatures where the public key is not available are
              not listed; to see their keyids the command <b>--list-sigs</b> can be used.

              For each signature listed, there are several flags in between the signature status flag and keyid.
              These flags give additional information about each key signature.  From left to  right,  they  are
              the  numbers  1-3  for  certificate  check  level  (see <b>--ask-cert-level</b>), "L" for a local or non-
              exportable signature (see <b>--lsign-key</b>), "R" for  a  nonRevocable  signature  (see  the  <b>--edit-key</b>
              command "nrsign"), "P" for a signature that contains a policy URL (see <b>--cert-policy-url</b>), "N" for
              a  signature  that  contains  a  notation (see <b>--cert-notation</b>), "X" for an eXpired signature (see
              <b>--ask-cert-expire</b>), and the numbers 1-9 or "T" for 10 and above to indicate trust signature levels
              (see the <b>--edit-key</b> command "tsign").

       <b>--locate-keys</b>
       <b>--locate-external-keys</b>
              Locate the keys given as arguments.  This command basically uses the same algorithm as  used  when
              locating  keys  for encryption and may thus be used to see what keys <b>gpg</b> might use.  In particular
              external methods as defined by <b>--auto-key-locate</b> are used to locate a key if the arguments  comain
              valid mail addresses.  Only public keys are listed.

              The  variant  <b>--locate-external-keys</b> does not consider a locally existing key and can thus be used
              to force the refresh of a key via the defined external methods.  If a fingerprint is given and and
              the methods defined by --auto-key-locate define LDAP  servers,  the  key  is  fetched  from  these
              resources; defined non-LDAP keyservers are skipped.

       <b>--show-keys</b>
              This  commands  takes  OpenPGP keys as input and prints information about them in the same way the
              command <b>--list-keys</b> does for locally stored key.  In addition the list options <b>show-unusable-uids</b>,
              <b>show-unusable-subkeys</b>, <b>show-notations</b>  and  <b>show-policy-urls</b>  are  also  enabled.   As  usual  for
              automated processing, this command should be combined with the option <b>--with-colons</b>.

       <b>--fingerprint</b>
              List  all  keys  (or the specified ones) along with their fingerprints. This is the same output as
              <b>--list-keys</b> but with the additional output of a line with the fingerprint. May  also  be  combined
              with  <b>--check-signatures</b>.   If this command is given twice, the fingerprints of all secondary keys
              are listed too.  This command also forces pretty printing of fingerprints if the keyid format  has
              been set to "none".

       <b>--list-packets</b>
              List  only  the  sequence  of packets.  This command is only useful for debugging.  When used with
              option <b>--verbose</b> the actual MPI values are dumped and not  only  their  lengths.   Note  that  the
              output of this command may change with new releases.

       <b>--edit-card</b>
       <b>--card-edit</b>
              Present  a  menu to work with a smartcard. The subcommand "help" provides an overview on available
              commands.    For    a    detailed    description,    please    see    the    Card     HOWTO     at
              https://gnupg.org/documentation/howtos.html#GnuPG-cardHOWTO   .   Please  note  that  the  command
              "openpgp" can be used to switch  to  the  OpenPGP  application  of  cards  which  by  default  are
              presenting another application (e.g. PIV).

       <b>--card-status</b>
              Show the content of the smart card.

       <b>--change-pin</b>
              Present  a  menu to allow changing the PIN of a smartcard. This functionality is also available as
              the subcommand "passwd" with the <b>--edit-card</b> command.

       <b>--delete-keys</b> <u>name</u>
              Remove key from the public keyring. In batch mode either <b>--yes</b> is required  or  the  key  must  be
              specified  by  fingerprint.  This is a safeguard against accidental deletion of multiple keys.  If
              the exclamation mark syntax is used with the fingerprint of a subkey only that subkey is  deleted;
              if  the  exclamation mark is used with the fingerprint of the primary key the entire public key is
              deleted.

       <b>--delete-secret-keys</b> <u>name</u>
              Remove key from the secret keyring. In batch mode the key must be specified by  fingerprint.   The
              option  <b>--yes</b>  can  be  used  to  advise gpg-agent not to request a confirmation.  This extra pre-
              caution is done because <b>gpg</b> can't be sure that the secret key (as controlled by gpg-agent) is only
              used for the given OpenPGP  public  key.   If  the  exclamation  mark  syntax  is  used  with  the
              fingerprint of a subkey only the secret part of that subkey is deleted; if the exclamation mark is
              used with the fingerprint of the primary key only the secret part of the primary key is deleted.

       <b>--delete-secret-and-public-key</b> <u>name</u>
              Same  as <b>--delete-key</b>, but if a secret key exists, it will be removed first. In batch mode the key
              must be specified by fingerprint.  The option <b>--yes</b> can be used to advise gpg-agent not to request
              a confirmation.

       <b>--export</b>
              Either export all keys from  all  keyrings  (default  keyring  and  those  registered  via  option
              <b>--keyring</b>),  or  if  at  least  one  name is given, those of the given name. The exported keys are
              written to STDOUT or to the file given with option <b>--output</b>.  Use together with  <b>--armor</b>  to  mail
              those keys.

       <b>--send-keys</b> <u>keyIDs</u>
              Similar  to  <b>--export</b>  but sends the keys to a keyserver.  Fingerprints may be used instead of key
              IDs.  Don't send your complete keyring to a keyserver --- select only those keys which are new  or
              changed by you.  If no <u>keyIDs</u> are given, <b>gpg</b> does nothing.

              Take  care: Keyservers are by design write only systems and thus it is not possible to ever delete
              keys once they have been send to a keyserver.

       <b>--export-secret-keys</b>
       <b>--export-secret-subkeys</b>
              Same as <b>--export</b>, but exports the secret keys instead.  The exported keys are written to STDOUT or
              to the file given with option <b>--output</b>.  This command is often used along with the option  <b>--armor</b>
              to  allow for easy printing of the key for paper backup; however the external tool <b>paperkey</b> does a
              better job of creating backups on paper.  Note that exporting a secret key can be a security  risk
              if the exported keys are sent over an insecure channel.

              The  second  form of the command has the special property to render the secret part of the primary
              key useless; this is a GNU extension to OpenPGP and other implementations can not be  expected  to
              successfully  import  such a key.  Its intended use is in generating a full key with an additional
              signing subkey on a dedicated machine.  This command then exports the key without the primary  key
              to the main machine.

              GnuPG  may  ask  you  to enter the passphrase for the key.  This is required, because the internal
              protection method of the secret key is different from the one specified by the OpenPGP protocol.

       <b>--export-ssh-key</b>
              This command is used to export  a  key  in  the  OpenSSH  public  key  format.   It  requires  the
              specification  of  one  key  by  the  usual means and exports the latest valid subkey which has an
              authentication capability to STDOUT or to the file given with option <b>--output</b>.   That  output  can
              directly be added to ssh's ‘<u>authorized_key</u>’ file.

              By  specifying the key to export using a key ID or a fingerprint suffixed with an exclamation mark
              (!), a specific subkey or the primary key can be exported.  This does not even  require  that  the
              key has the authentication capability flag set.

       <b>--import</b>
       <b>--fast-import</b>
              Import/merge  keys.  This adds the given keys to the keyring. The fast version is currently just a
              synonym.

              There are a few other options which control how this command works.   Most  notable  here  is  the
              <b>--import-options</b> <b>merge-only</b> option which does not insert new keys but does only the merging of new
              signatures, user-IDs and subkeys.

       <b>--receive-keys</b> <u>keyIDs</u>
       <b>--recv-keys</b> <u>keyIDs</u>
              Import the keys with the given <u>keyIDs</u> from a keyserver.

       <b>--refresh-keys</b>
              Request  updates from a keyserver for keys that already exist on the local keyring. This is useful
              for updating a key with the latest signatures, user IDs, etc. Calling this with no arguments  will
              refresh the entire keyring.

       <b>--search-keys</b> <u>names</u>
              Search  the  keyserver  for  the given <u>names</u>. Multiple names given here will be joined together to
              create the search string for the keyserver.  Note that keyservers search for <u>names</u> in a  different
              and  simpler  way  than  gpg does.  The best choice is to use a mail address.  Due to data privacy
              reasons keyservers may even not even allow searching by user id or mail address and thus may  only
              return results when being used with the <b>--recv-key</b> command to search by key fingerprint or keyid.

       <b>--fetch-keys</b> <u>URIs</u>
              Retrieve  keys  located  at  the  specified  <u>URIs</u>.  Note that different installations of GnuPG may
              support different protocols (HTTP, FTP, LDAP, etc.).  When using HTTPS the  system  provided  root
              certificates are used by this command.

       <b>--update-trustdb</b>
              Do  trust  database  maintenance. This command iterates over all keys and builds the Web of Trust.
              This is an interactive command because it may have to ask for the "ownertrust"  values  for  keys.
              The  user  has  to  give  an  estimation  of  how far she trusts the owner of the displayed key to
              correctly certify (sign) other keys. GnuPG only asks for the ownertrust value if it  has  not  yet
              been assigned to a key. Using the <b>--edit-key</b> menu, the assigned value can be changed at any time.

       <b>--check-trustdb</b>
              Do  trust database maintenance without user interaction. From time to time the trust database must
              be updated so that expired keys or signatures and the resulting changes in the Web of Trust can be
              tracked. Normally, GnuPG will calculate when this is  required  and  do  it  automatically  unless
              <b>--no-auto-check-trustdb</b>  is  set.  This command can be used to force a trust database check at any
              time. The processing is identical to that of <b>--update-trustdb</b> but it skips keys  with  a  not  yet
              defined "ownertrust".

              For  use  with  cron  jobs, this command can be used together with <b>--batch</b> in which case the trust
              database check is done only if a check is needed. To force a run even in batch mode add the option
              <b>--yes</b>.

       <b>--export-ownertrust</b>
              Send the ownertrust values to STDOUT. This is useful for backup purposes as these values  are  the
              only ones which can't be re-created from a corrupted trustdb.  Example:
                  gpg --export-ownertrust &gt; otrust.txt

       <b>--import-ownertrust</b>
              Update  the  trustdb  with the ownertrust values stored in <b>files</b> (or STDIN if not given); existing
              values will be overwritten.  In case of a severely damaged trustdb and if you have a recent backup
              of the ownertrust values (e.g. in the file ‘<u>otrust.txt</u>’), you  may  re-create  the  trustdb  using
              these commands:
                  cd <a href="file:~/.gnupg">~/.gnupg</a>
                  rm trustdb.gpg
                  gpg --import-ownertrust &lt; otrust.txt

       <b>--rebuild-keydb-caches</b>
              When  updating  from version 1.0.6 to 1.0.7 this command should be used to create signature caches
              in the keyring. It might be handy in other situations too.

       <b>--print-md</b> <u>algo</u>
       <b>--print-mds</b>
              Print message digest of algorithm <u>algo</u> for all given files or STDIN.  With the second form  (or  a
              deprecated "*" for <u>algo</u>) digests for all available algorithms are printed.

       <b>--gen-random</b> <u>0|1|2|16|30</u> <u>count</u>
              Emit  <u>count</u>  random  bytes of the given quality level 0, 1 or 2. If <u>count</u> is not given or zero, an
              endless sequence of random bytes will be emitted.  If used with <b>--armor</b> the output will be  base64
              encoded.   The  special  level  16 uses a quality level of 1 and outputs an endless stream of hex-
              encoded octets.  The special level 30 outputs random as 30 zBase-32 characters.

       <b>--gen-prime</b> <u>mode</u> <u>bits</u>
              Use the source, Luke :-). The output format is subject to change with any release.

       <b>--enarmor</b>
       <b>--dearmor</b>
              Pack or unpack an arbitrary input into/from an OpenPGP ASCII armor.  This is a GnuPG extension  to
              OpenPGP  and  in  general  not very useful.  The <b>--dearmor</b> command can also be used to dearmor PEM
              armors.

       <b>--unwrap</b>
              This option modifies the command <b>--decrypt</b> to output the  original  message  with  the  encryption
              layer  removed.   Thus  the  output  will  be an OpenPGP data structure which often means a signed
              OpenPGP message.  Note that this option may or may not remove a compression layer which  is  often
              found beneath the encryption layer.

       <b>--tofu-policy</b> <b>{auto|good|unknown|bad|ask}</b> <u>keys</u>
              Set the TOFU policy for all the bindings associated with the specified <u>keys</u>.  For more information
              about  the  meaning of the policies, see: [trust-model-tofu].  The <u>keys</u> may be specified either by
              their fingerprint (preferred) or their keyid.

   <b>How</b> <b>to</b> <b>manage</b> <b>your</b> <b>keys</b>

       This section explains the main commands for key management.

       <b>--quick-generate-key</b> <u>user-id</u> <b>[</b><u>algo</u> <b>[</b><u>usage</u> <b>[</b><u>expire</u><b>]]]</b>
       <b>--quick-gen-key</b>
              This is a simple  command  to  generate  a  standard  key  with  one  user  id.   In  contrast  to
              <b>--generate-key</b>  the  key  is  generated  directly  without  the need to answer a bunch of prompts.
              Unless the option <b>--yes</b> is given, the key creation will be canceled if the given user  id  already
              exists in the keyring.

              If  invoked directly on the console without any special options an answer to a ``Continue?'' style
              confirmation prompt is required.  In case the user id already  exists  in  the  keyring  a  second
              prompt to force the creation of the key will show up.

              If  <u>algo</u> or <u>usage</u> are given, only the primary key is created and no prompts are shown.  To specify
              an expiration date but still create a primary and subkey use ``default'' or ``future-default'' for
              <u>algo</u> and ``default'' for <u>usage</u>.  For a description of these optional  arguments  see  the  command
              <b>--quick-add-key</b>.   The  <u>usage</u>  accepts  also  the  value  ``cert''  which  can be used to create a
              certification only primary key; the default is to a create certification and signing key.

              The <u>expire</u> argument can be used to specify an expiration date for the key.   Several  formats  are
              supported;  commonly  the ISO formats ``YYYY-MM-DD'' or ``YYYYMMDDThhmmss'' are used.  To make the
              key expire in N seconds, N days, N weeks, N months, or N years use ``seconds=N'', ``Nd'',  ``Nw'',
              ``Nm'',  or ``Ny'' respectively.  Not specifying a value, or using ``-'' results in a key expiring
              in a reasonable default interval.  The values ``never'', ``none'' can be used  for  no  expiration
              date.

              If  this  command  is  used with <b>--batch</b>, <b>--pinentry-mode</b> has been set to <b>loopback</b>, and one of the
              passphrase options (<b>--passphrase</b>, <b>--passphrase-fd</b>, or <b>--passphrase-file</b>)  is  used,  the  supplied
              passphrase is used for the new key and the agent does not ask for it.  To create a key without any
              protection <b>--passphrase</b> <b>''</b> may be used.

              To  create an OpenPGP key from the keys available on the currently inserted smartcard, the special
              string ``card'' can be used for <u>algo</u>.  If the card features an encryption and a signing  key,  gpg
              will  figure  them  out  and  creates  an  OpenPGP key consisting of the usual primary key and one
              subkey.  This works only with  certain  smartcards.   Note  that  the  interactive  <b>--full-gen-key</b>
              command  allows  one to do the same but with greater flexibility in the selection of the smartcard
              keys.

              Note that it is possible to create a primary key and a  subkey  using  non-default  algorithms  by
              using ``default'' and changing the default parameters using the option <b>--default-new-key-algo</b>.

       <b>--quick-set-expire</b> <u>fpr</u> <u>expire</u> <b>[*|</b><u>subfprs</u><b>]</b>
              With two arguments given, directly set the expiration time of the primary key identified by <u>fpr</u> to
              <u>expire</u>.  To remove the expiration time <b>0</b> can be used.  With three arguments and the third given as
              an asterisk, the expiration time of all non-revoked and not yet expired subkeys are set to <u>expire</u>.
              With more than two arguments and a list of fingerprints given for <u>subfprs</u>, all non-revoked subkeys
              matching these fingerprints are set to <u>expire</u>.

       <b>--quick-add-key</b> <u>fpr</u> <b>[</b><u>algo</u> <b>[</b><u>usage</u> <b>[</b><u>expire</u><b>]]]</b>
              Directly  add  a  subkey  to  the  key  identified  by  the fingerprint <u>fpr</u>.  Without the optional
              arguments an encryption subkey is added.  If any of the arguments are given a more specific subkey
              is added.

              <u>algo</u> may be any of the supported algorithms or curve names given in the  format  as  used  by  key
              listings.   To  use  the default algorithm the string ``default'' or ``-'' can be used.  Supported
              algorithms are ``rsa'', ``dsa'', ``elg'', ``ed25519'', ``cv25519'', and  other  ECC  curves.   For
              example  the  string  ``rsa''  adds  an  RSA key with the default key length; a string ``rsa4096''
              requests that the key length is 4096 bits.  The string ``future-default''  is  an  alias  for  the
              algorithm  which  will likely be used as default algorithm in future versions of gpg.  To list the
              supported ECC curves the command <b>gpg</b> <b>--with-colons</b> <b>--list-config</b> <b>curve</b> can be used.

              Depending on the given <u>algo</u> the subkey may either be an encryption subkey or a signing subkey.  If
              an algorithm is capable of signing and encryption and such a subkey is  desired,  a  <u>usage</u>  string
              must  be  given.   This  string  is  either  ``default''  or  ``-'' to keep the default or a comma
              delimited list (or space delimited list) of keywords: ``sign'' for a signing subkey, ``auth''  for
              an  authentication subkey, and ``encr'' for an encryption subkey (``encrypt'' can be used as alias
              for ``encr'').  The valid combinations depend on the algorithm.

              The <u>expire</u> argument can be used to specify an expiration date for the key.   Several  formats  are
              supported;  commonly  the ISO formats ``YYYY-MM-DD'' or ``YYYYMMDDThhmmss'' are used.  To make the
              key expire in N seconds, N days, N weeks, N months, or N years use ``seconds=N'', ``Nd'',  ``Nw'',
              ``Nm'',  or ``Ny'' respectively.  Not specifying a value, or using ``-'' results in a key expiring
              in a reasonable default interval.  The values ``never'', ``none'' can be used  for  no  expiration
              date.

       <b>--quick-add-adsk</b> <u>fpr</u> <u>adskfpr</u>
              Directly  add  an  Additional  Decryption  Subkey  to  the  key identified by the fingerprint <u>fpr</u>.
              <u>adskfpr</u> is the fingerprint of another key's encryption subkey.  A subkey  is  commonly  used  here
              because   by   default   a   primary   key   has   no   encryption  capability.   Use  the  option
              <b>--with-subkey-fingerprint</b> with a list command to display the subkey fingerprints.

       <b>--generate-key</b>
       <b>--gen-key</b>
              Generate a new key pair using the current default parameters.  This is  the  standard  command  to
              create  a  new  key.  In addition to the key a revocation certificate is created and stored in the
              ‘<u>openpgp-revocs.d</u>’ directory below the GnuPG home directory.

       <b>--full-generate-key</b>
       <b>--full-gen-key</b>
              Generate a new  key  pair  with  dialogs  for  all  options.   This  is  an  extended  version  of
              <b>--generate-key</b>.

              There  is  also  a  feature  which allows you to create keys in batch mode. See the manual section
              ``Unattended key generation'' on how to use this.

       <b>--generate-revocation</b> <u>name</u>
       <b>--gen-revoke</b> <u>name</u>
              Generate a revocation certificate for the complete  key.   To  only  revoke  a  subkey  or  a  key
              signature, use the <b>--edit</b> command.

              This command merely creates the revocation certificate so that it can be used to revoke the key if
              that  is  ever  needed.   To  actually revoke a key the created revocation certificate needs to be
              merged with the key to revoke.  This is done by importing the  revocation  certificate  using  the
              <b>--import</b>  command.   Then the revoked key needs to be published, which is best done by sending the
              key to a keyserver (command <b>--send-key</b>) and by exporting (<b>--export</b>) it to a  file  which  is  then
              send to frequent communication partners.

       <b>--generate-designated-revocation</b> <u>name</u>
       <b>--desig-revoke</b> <u>name</u>
              Generate a designated revocation certificate for a key. This allows a user (with the permission of
              the keyholder) to revoke someone else's key.

       <b>--edit-key</b>
              Present  a  menu which enables you to do most of the key management related tasks.  It expects the
              specification of a key on the command line.

              <b>uid</b> <u>n</u>  Toggle selection of user ID or photographic user ID with index <u>n</u>.  Use <b>*</b> to select all  and
                     <b>0</b> to deselect all.

              <b>key</b> <u>n</u>  Toggle selection of subkey with index <u>n</u> or key ID <u>n</u>.  Use <b>*</b> to select all and <b>0</b> to deselect
                     all.

              <b>sign</b>   Make  a signature on key of user <b>name</b>. If the key is not yet signed by the default user (or
                     the users given with <b>-u</b>), the program displays the information of the key  again,  together
                     with  its  fingerprint  and asks whether it should be signed. This question is repeated for
                     all users specified with <b>-u</b>.

              <b>lsign</b>  Same as "sign" but the signature is marked as non-exportable and will  therefore  never  be
                     used by others. This may be used to make keys valid only in the local environment.

              <b>nrsign</b> Same  as  "sign"  but  the  signature is marked as non-revocable and can therefore never be
                     revoked.

              <b>tsign</b>  Make a trust signature. This is a signature that  combines  the  notions  of  certification
                     (like a regular signature), and trust (like the "trust" command). It is generally useful in
                     distinct  communities or groups to implement the concept of a Trusted Introducer.  For more
                     information please read the sections ``Trust  Signature''  and  ``Regular  Expression''  in
                     RFC-4880.

              Note  that  "l"  (for local / non-exportable), "nr" (for non-revocable, and "t" (for trust) may be
              freely mixed and prefixed to "sign" to create a signature of any type desired.

       If the option <b>--only-sign-text-ids</b> is specified, then any non-text based user ids (e.g., photo IDs)  will
       not be selected for signing.

              <b>delsig</b> Delete  a  signature. Note that it is not possible to retract a signature, once it has been
                     send to the public (i.e. to a keyserver).  In that case you better use <b>revsig</b>.

              <b>revsig</b> Revoke a signature. For every signature which has been generated by one of the secret keys,
                     GnuPG asks whether a revocation certificate should be generated.

              <b>check</b>  Check the signatures on all selected user IDs.  With the extra option  <b>selfsig</b>  only  self-
                     signatures are shown.

              <b>adduid</b> Create an additional user ID.

              <b>addphoto</b>
                     Create  a photographic user ID. This will prompt for a JPEG file that will be embedded into
                     the user ID. Note that a very large JPEG will make for a very large  key.  Also  note  that
                     some  programs will display your JPEG unchanged (GnuPG), and some programs will scale it to
                     fit in a dialog box (PGP).

              <b>showphoto</b>
                     Display the selected photographic user ID.

              <b>deluid</b> Delete a user ID or photographic user ID.  Note that it is not possible to retract  a  user
                     id, once it has been send to the public (i.e. to a keyserver).  In that case you better use
                     <b>revuid</b>.

              <b>revuid</b> Revoke a user ID or photographic user ID.

              <b>primary</b>
                     Flag  the  current  user  id  as the primary one, removes the primary user id flag from all
                     other user ids and sets the timestamp of all affected  self-signatures  one  second  ahead.
                     Note  that  setting  a photo user ID as primary makes it primary over other photo user IDs,
                     and setting a regular user ID as primary makes it primary over other regular user IDs.

              <b>keyserver</b>
                     Set a preferred keyserver for the specified user ID(s). This allows  other  users  to  know
                     where  you  prefer  they get your key from. See <b>--keyserver-options</b> <b>honor-keyserver-url</b> for
                     more on how this works.  Setting a value of "none" removes an existing preferred keyserver.

              <b>notation</b>
                     Set a name=value notation for the specified user ID(s). See <b>--cert-notation</b> for more on how
                     this works. Setting a value of "none" removes all notations, setting  a  notation  prefixed
                     with  a  minus  sign  (-)  removes  that notation, and setting a notation name (without the
                     =value) prefixed with a minus sign removes all notations with that name.

              <b>pref</b>   List preferences from the selected user ID. This  shows  the  actual  preferences,  without
                     including any implied preferences.

              <b>showpref</b>
                     More  verbose  preferences  listing for the selected user ID. This shows the preferences in
                     effect by  including  the  implied  preferences  of  3DES  (cipher),  SHA-1  (digest),  and
                     Uncompressed  (compression)  if  they  are  not already included in the preference list. In
                     addition, the preferred keyserver and signature notations (if any) are shown.

              <b>setpref</b> <u>string</u>
                     Set the list of user ID preferences to <u>string</u> for all (or  just  the  selected)  user  IDs.
                     Calling  setpref with no arguments sets the preference list to the default (either built-in
                     or set via <b>--default-preference-list</b>), and calling setpref with "none" as the argument sets
                     an empty preference list. Use <b>gpg</b> <b>--version</b> to get a list  of  available  algorithms.  Note
                     that  while  you can change the preferences on an attribute user ID (aka "photo ID"), GnuPG
                     does not select keys via attribute user IDs so these preferences will not be used by GnuPG.
                     Note that an unattended version of this command is available as <b>--quick-update-pref</b>.

                     When setting preferences, you should list the algorithms in the order which you'd  like  to
                     see  them used by someone else when encrypting a message to your key.  If you don't include
                     3DES, it will be automatically added at the end.  Note that there are many factors that  go
                     into  choosing  an  algorithm (for example, your key may not be the only recipient), and so
                     the remote OpenPGP application being used to send to you may or may not follow  your  exact
                     chosen  order  for  a  given  message.   It will, however, only choose an algorithm that is
                     present on the preference list of every recipient key.  See also the INTEROPERABILITY  WITH
                     OTHER OPENPGP PROGRAMS section below.

              <b>addkey</b> Add a subkey to this key.

              <b>addcardkey</b>
                     Generate a subkey on a card and add it to this key.

              <b>keytocard</b>
                     Transfer  the selected secret subkey (or the primary key if no subkey has been selected) to
                     a smartcard. The secret key in the keyring will be replaced by a stub if the key  could  be
                     stored  successfully on the card and you use the save command later. Only certain key types
                     may be transferred to the card. A sub menu allows you to select on what card to  store  the
                     key.  Note  that  it  is not possible to get that key back from the card - if the card gets
                     broken your secret key will be lost unless you have a backup somewhere.

              <b>bkuptocard</b> <u>file</u>
                     Restore the given <u>file</u> to a card. This command may be used to  restore  a  backup  key  (as
                     generated  during  card initialization) to a new card. In almost all cases this will be the
                     encryption key. You should use this command only with the corresponding public key and make
                     sure that the file given as argument is indeed the  backup  to  restore.  You  should  then
                     select  2 to restore as encryption key.  You will first be asked to enter the passphrase of
                     the backup key and then for the Admin PIN of the card.

              <b>keytotpm</b>
                     Transfer the selected secret subkey (or the primary key if no subkey has been selected)  to
                     TPM form.  The secret key in the keyring will be replaced by the TPM representation of that
                     key,  which  can  only  be  read  by the particular TPM that created it (so the keyfile now
                     becomes locked to  the  laptop  containing  the  TPM).   Only  certain  key  types  may  be
                     transferred  to  the TPM (all TPM 2.0 systems are mandated to have the rsa2048 and nistp256
                     algorithms but newer TPMs may have more). Note that the key itself is not transferred  into
                     the  TPM,  merely encrypted by the TPM in-place, so if the keyfile is deleted, the key will
                     be lost.  Once transferred to TPM representation, the key file can never be converted  back
                     to  non-TPM  form and the key will die when the TPM does, so you should first have a backup
                     on secure offline storage of the actual secret key file before conversion.  It is essential
                     to use the physical system TPM that you have rw permission  on  the  TPM  resource  manager
                     device (/dev/tpmrm0).  Usually this means you must be a member of the tss group.

              <b>delkey</b> Remove  a subkey (secondary key). Note that it is not possible to retract a subkey, once it
                     has been send to the public (i.e. to a keyserver).  In that case  you  better  use  <b>revkey</b>.
                     Also note that this only deletes the public part of a key.

              <b>revkey</b> Revoke a subkey.

              <b>expire</b> Change  the  key or subkey expiration time. If a subkey is selected, the expiration time of
                     this subkey will be changed. With no selection, the key expiration of the  primary  key  is
                     changed.

              <b>trust</b>  Change the owner trust value for the key. This updates the trust-db immediately and no save
                     is required.

              <b>disable</b>
              <b>enable</b> Disable or enable an entire key. A disabled key can not normally be used for encryption.

              <b>addrevoker</b>
                     Add  a  designated  revoker to the key. This takes one optional argument: "sensitive". If a
                     designated revoker is marked as sensitive, it will not be exported by default (see  export-
                     options).

              <b>addadsk</b>
                     Add an Additional Decryption Subkey.  The user is asked to enter the fingerprint of another
                     encryption  subkey.   Note  that  the  exact fingerprint of another key's encryption subkey
                     needs to be  entered.   This  is  because  commonly  the  primary  key  has  no  encryption
                     capability.   Use  the  option <b>--with-subkey-fingerprint</b> with a list command to display the
                     subkey fingerprints.

              <b>passwd</b> Change the passphrase of the secret key.

              <b>toggle</b> This is dummy command which exists only for backward compatibility.

              <b>clean</b>  Compact (by removing all signatures except the selfsig) any  user  ID  that  is  no  longer
                     usable  (e.g.  revoked, or expired). Then, remove any signatures that are not usable by the
                     trust calculations.  Specifically, this removes any signature that does not  validate,  any
                     signature  that  is  superseded  by  a  later signature, revoked signatures, and signatures
                     issued by keys that are not present on the keyring.

              <b>minimize</b>
                     Make the key as small as possible. This removes all signatures from each user ID except for
                     the most recent self-signature.

              <b>change-usage</b>
                     Change the usage flags (capabilities) of the primary key or of subkeys.  These usage  flags
                     (e.g.  Certify,  Sign, Authenticate, Encrypt) are set during key creation.  Sometimes it is
                     useful to have the opportunity to change them (for example to add Authenticate) after  they
                     have been created.  Please take care when doing this; the allowed usage flags depend on the
                     key algorithm.

              <b>cross-certify</b>
                     Add  cross-certification  signatures  to  signing subkeys that may not currently have them.
                     Cross-certification signatures protect against a subtle attack against signing subkeys. See
                     <b>--require-cross-certification</b>.  All new keys generated have this signature by  default,  so
                     this command is only useful to bring older keys up to date.

              <b>save</b>   Save all changes to the keyring and quit.

              <b>quit</b>   Quit the program without updating the keyring.

              The  listing  shows  you the key with its secondary keys and all user IDs.  The primary user ID is
              indicated by a dot, and selected keys or user IDs are indicated by an asterisk.  The  trust  value
              is  displayed  with  the  primary  key:  "trust" is the assigned owner trust and "validity" is the
              calculated validity of the key.  Validity values  are  also  displayed  for  all  user  IDs.   For
              possible values of trust, see: [trust-values].

       <b>--sign-key</b> <u>name</u>
              Signs  a public key with your secret key. This is a shortcut version of the subcommand "sign" from
              <b>--edit-key</b>.

       <b>--lsign-key</b> <u>name</u>
              Signs a public key with your secret key but marks it as non-exportable. This is a shortcut version
              of the subcommand "lsign" from <b>--edit-key</b>.

       <b>--quick-sign-key</b> <u>fpr</u> <b>[</b><u>names</u><b>]</b>
       <b>--quick-lsign-key</b> <u>fpr</u> <b>[</b><u>names</u><b>]</b>
              Directly sign a key from the passphrase without any further user interaction.  The <u>fpr</u> must be the
              verified primary fingerprint of a key in the local keyring. If no <u>names</u> are given, all useful user
              ids are signed; with given [<u>names</u>] only useful user ids matching one of these  names  are  signed.
              By default, or if a name is prefixed with a '*', a case insensitive substring match is used.  If a
              name is prefixed with a '=' a case sensitive exact match is done.

              The  command  <b>--quick-lsign-key</b>  marks the signatures as non-exportable.  If such a non-exportable
              signature already exists the <b>--quick-sign-key</b> turns it into a exportable signature.  If  you  need
              to  update  an existing signature, for example to add or change notation data, you need to use the
              option <b>--force-sign-key</b>.

              This command uses reasonable defaults and thus does not provide the full flexibility of the "sign"
              subcommand from <b>--edit-key</b>.  Its intended use is to help unattended key  signing  by  utilizing  a
              list of verified fingerprints.

       <b>--quick-add-uid</b> <u>user-id</u> <u>new-user-id</u>
              This  command  adds  a new user id to an existing key.  In contrast to the interactive sub-command
              <b>adduid</b> of <b>--edit-key</b> the <u>new-user-id</u> is added verbatim with only leading and trailing white  space
              removed, it is expected to be UTF-8 encoded, and no checks on its form are applied.

       <b>--quick-revoke-uid</b> <u>user-id</u> <u>user-id-to-revoke</u>
              This  command  revokes a user ID on an existing key.  It cannot be used to revoke the last user ID
              on key (some non-revoked user ID must remain), with revocation  reason  ``User  ID  is  no  longer
              valid''.   If  you  want  to  specify  a  different  revocation reason, or to supply supplementary
              revocation text, you should use the interactive sub-command <b>revuid</b> of <b>--edit-key</b>.

       <b>--quick-revoke-sig</b> <u>fpr</u> <u>signing-fpr</u> <b>[</b><u>names</u><b>]</b>
              This command revokes the key signatures  made  by  <u>signing-fpr</u>  from  the  key  specified  by  the
              fingerprint  <u>fpr</u>.  With <u>names</u> given only the signatures on user ids of the key matching any of the
              given names are affected (see <b>--quick-sign-key</b>).  If a  revocation  already  exists  a  notice  is
              printed  instead  of  creating a new revocation; no error is returned in this case.  Note that key
              signature revocations may be superseded by a newer key signature and in turn again revoked.

       <b>--quick-set-primary-uid</b> <u>user-id</u> <u>primary-user-id</u>
              This command sets or updates the primary user ID flag on an existing key.  <u>user-id</u>  specifies  the
              key  and  <u>primary-user-id</u>  the user ID which shall be flagged as the primary user ID.  The primary
              user ID flag is removed from all other user ids and the timestamp of all affected  self-signatures
              is set one second ahead.

       <b>--quick-update-pref</b> <u>user-id</u>
              This  command updates the preference list of the key to the current default value (either built-in
              or set via <b>--default-preference-list</b>).  This is the unattended version of of  using  "setpref"  in
              the  <b>--key-edit</b>  menu  without  giving  a  list.   Note that you can show the preferences in a key
              listing by using <b>--list-options</b> <b>show-pref</b> or <b>--list-options</b> <b>show-pref-verbose</b>.   You  should  also
              re-distribute updated keys to your peers.

       <b>--change-passphrase</b> <u>user-id</u>
       <b>--passwd</b> <u>user-id</u>
              Change  the  passphrase of the secret key belonging to the certificate specified as <u>user-id</u>.  This
              is a shortcut for the sub-command <b>passwd</b> of the <b>--edit-key</b> menu.  When  using  together  with  the
              option  <b>--dry-run</b>  this  will  not  actually  change  the  passphrase  but  check that the current
              passphrase is correct.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>gpg</b> features a bunch of options to control the exact behaviour and to change the default configuration.

       Long options can be put in an options file (default "<a href="file:~/.gnupg/gpg.conf">~/.gnupg/gpg.conf</a>"). Short  option  names  will  not
       work  - for example, "armor" is a valid option for the options file, while "a" is not. Do not write the 2
       dashes, but simply the name of the option and any required arguments. Lines with  a  hash  ('#')  as  the
       first  non-white-space  character  are  ignored.  Commands  may  be put in this file too, but that is not
       generally useful as the command will execute automatically with every execution of gpg.

       Please remember that option parsing stops as soon as a non-option is encountered, you can explicitly stop
       parsing by using the special option <b>--</b>.

   <b>How</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>the</b> <b>configuration</b>

       These options are used to change the configuration and most of them are usually found in the option file.

       <b>--default-key</b> <u>name</u>
              Use <u>name</u> as the default key to sign with. If this option is not used, the default key is the first
              key found in the secret keyring.  Note that <b>-u</b> or <b>--local-user</b> overrides this option.  This option
              may be given multiple times.  In this case, the last key for which a secret key  is  available  is
              used.  If there is no secret key available for any of the specified values, GnuPG will not emit an
              error message but continue as if this option wasn't given.

       <b>--default-recipient</b> <u>name</u>
              Use  <u>name</u>  as default recipient if option <b>--recipient</b> is not used and don't ask if this is a valid
              one. <u>name</u> must be non-empty.

       <b>--default-recipient-self</b>
              Use the default key as default recipient if option <b>--recipient</b> is not used and don't ask  if  this
              is  a  valid  one.  The  default  key is the first one from the secret keyring or the one set with
              <b>--default-key</b>.

       <b>--no-default-recipient</b>
              Reset <b>--default-recipient</b> and <b>--default-recipient-self</b>.  Should not be used in an option file.

       <b>-v,</b> <b>--verbose</b>
              Give more information during processing. If used twice, the input data is listed in detail.

       <b>--no-verbose</b>
              Reset verbose level to 0.  Should not be used in an option file.

       <b>-q,</b> <b>--quiet</b>
              Try to be as quiet as possible.  Should not be used in an option file.

       <b>--batch</b>
       <b>--no-batch</b>
              Use batch mode.  Never ask, do not allow interactive commands.  <b>--no-batch</b> disables  this  option.
              Note  that even with a filename given on the command line, gpg might still need to read from STDIN
              (in particular if gpg figures that the input is a detached signature and no  data  file  has  been
              specified).   Thus  if  you  do  not  want  to  feed  data  via STDIN, you should connect STDIN to
              ‘<u>/dev/null</u>’.

              It is highly recommended to use this option along with the options <b>--status-fd</b>  and  <b>--with-colons</b>
              for any unattended use of <b>gpg</b>.  Should not be used in an option file.

       <b>--no-tty</b>
              Make  sure  that  the  TTY (terminal) is never used for any output.  This option is needed in some
              cases because GnuPG sometimes prints warnings to the TTY even if <b>--batch</b> is used.

       <b>--yes</b>  Assume "yes" on most questions.  Should not be used in an option file.

       <b>--no</b>   Assume "no" on most questions.  Should not be used in an option file.

       <b>--list-filter</b> <b>{select=</b><u>expr</u><b>}</b>
              A list filter can be used to output only  certain  keys  during  key  listing  commands.  For  the
              available property names, see the description of <b>--import-filter</b>.

       <b>--list-options</b> <u>parameters</u>
              This is a space or comma delimited string that gives options used when listing keys and signatures
              (that   is,  <b>--list-keys</b>,  <b>--check-signatures</b>,  <b>--list-public-keys</b>,  <b>--list-secret-keys</b>,  and  the
              <b>--edit-key</b> functions).  Options can be prepended with a <b>no-</b> (after the two  dashes)  to  give  the
              opposite meaning.  The options are:

              <b>show-photos</b>
                     Causes  <b>--list-keys</b>,  <b>--check-signatures</b>,  <b>--list-public-keys</b>,  and  <b>--list-secret-keys</b>  to
                     display any photo IDs attached to the key.  Defaults to no. See also <b>--photo-viewer</b>.   Does
                     not  work  with <b>--with-colons</b>: see <b>--attribute-fd</b> for the appropriate way to get photo data
                     for scripts and other frontends.

              <b>show-usage</b>
                     Show usage information for keys and subkeys in the standard key listing.  This is a list of
                     letters indicating the allowed usage for a key (<b>E</b>=encryption,  <b>S</b>=signing,  <b>C</b>=certification,
                     <b>A</b>=authentication).  Defaults to yes.

              <b>show-policy-urls</b>
                     Show policy URLs in the  <b>--check-signatures</b> listings.  Defaults to no.

              <b>show-notations</b>
              <b>show-std-notations</b>
              <b>show-user-notations</b>
                     Show  all,  IETF  standard,  or  user-defined signature notations in the <b>--check-signatures</b>
                     listings. Defaults to no.

              <b>show-keyserver-urls</b>
                     Show any preferred keyserver URL in the <b>--check-signatures</b> listings. Defaults to no.

              <b>show-uid-validity</b>
                     Display the calculated validity of user IDs during key listings.  Defaults to yes.

              <b>show-unusable-uids</b>
                     Show revoked and expired user IDs in key listings. Defaults to no.

              <b>show-unusable-subkeys</b>
                     Show revoked and expired subkeys in key listings. Defaults to no.

              <b>show-unusable-sigs</b>
                     Show key signature made using weak or unsupported algorithms.

              <b>show-keyring</b>
                     Display the keyring name at the head of key listings to show  which  keyring  a  given  key
                     resides on. Defaults to no.

              <b>show-sig-expire</b>
                     Show  signature  expiration  dates (if any) during <b>--check-signatures</b> listings. Defaults to
                     no.

              <b>show-sig-subpackets</b>
                     Include signature subpackets in the key listing. This option can take an optional  argument
                     list  of the subpackets to list. If no argument is passed, list all subpackets. Defaults to
                     no. This option is only meaningful when using <b>--with-colons</b> along with <b>--check-signatures</b>.

              <b>show-only-fpr-mbox</b>
                     For each user-id which has a valid mail address print only the fingerprint followed by  the
                     mail address.

              <b>sort-sigs</b>
                     With --list-sigs and --check-sigs sort the signatures by keyID and creation time to make it
                     easier  to  view the history of these signatures.  The self-signature is also listed before
                     other signatures. Defaults to yes.

       <b>--verify-options</b> <u>parameters</u>
              This is a space or comma delimited string that  gives  options  used  when  verifying  signatures.
              Options can be prepended with a `no-' to give the opposite meaning. The options are:

              <b>show-photos</b>
                     Display  any  photo  IDs present on the key that issued the signature.  Defaults to no. See
                     also <b>--photo-viewer</b>.

              <b>show-policy-urls</b>
                     Show policy URLs in the signature being verified. Defaults to yes.

              <b>show-notations</b>
              <b>show-std-notations</b>
              <b>show-user-notations</b>
                     Show all, IETF standard,  or  user-defined  signature  notations  in  the  signature  being
                     verified. Defaults to IETF standard.

              <b>show-keyserver-urls</b>
                     Show any preferred keyserver URL in the signature being verified.  Defaults to yes.

              <b>show-uid-validity</b>
                     Display  the  calculated  validity  of  the  user IDs on the key that issued the signature.
                     Defaults to yes.

              <b>show-unusable-uids</b>
                     Show revoked and expired user IDs during signature verification.  Defaults to no.

              <b>show-primary-uid-only</b>
                     Show only the primary user ID during signature verification.  That is all the AKA lines  as
                     well as photo Ids are not shown with the signature verification status.

       <b>--enable-large-rsa</b>
       <b>--disable-large-rsa</b>
              With  --generate-key  and  --batch,  enable  the creation of RSA secret keys as large as 8192 bit.
              Note: 8192 bit is more than is  generally  recommended.   These  large  keys  don't  significantly
              improve  security, but they are more expensive to use, and their signatures and certifications are
              larger.  This option is only available if the binary was build with large-secmem support.

       <b>--enable-dsa2</b>
       <b>--disable-dsa2</b>
              Enable hash truncation for all DSA keys even for old DSA Keys up to 1024 bit.  This  is  also  the
              default  with  <b>--openpgp</b>.   Note that older versions of GnuPG also required this flag to allow the
              generation of DSA larger than 1024 bit.

       <b>--photo-viewer</b> <u>string</u>
              This is the command line that should be run to view a  photo  ID.  "%i"  will  be  expanded  to  a
              filename  containing  the  photo. "%I" does the same, except the file will not be deleted once the
              viewer exits.  Other flags are "%k" for the key ID, "%K" for the long key ID,  "%f"  for  the  key
              fingerprint,  "%t" for the extension of the image type (e.g. "jpg"), "%T" for the MIME type of the
              image (e.g. "image/jpeg"), "%v" for the single-character calculated validity of  the  image  being
              viewed  (e.g. "f"), "%V" for the calculated validity as a string (e.g.  "full"), "%U" for a base32
              encoded hash of the user ID, and "%%" for an actual percent sign. If neither %i or %I are present,
              then the photo will be supplied to the viewer on standard input.

              On Unix the default viewer is <b>xloadimage</b> <b>-fork</b> <b>-quiet</b> <b>-title</b> <b>'KeyID</b> <b>0x%k'</b> <b>STDIN</b> with a fallback to
              <b>display</b> <b>-title</b> <b>'KeyID</b> <b>0x%k'</b> <b>%i</b> and finally to <b>xdg-open</b> <b>%i</b>.  On Windows  <b>!ShellExecute</b>  <b>400</b>  <b>%i</b>  is
              used;  here  the  command  is  a  meta  command  to  use  that API call followed by a wait time in
              milliseconds which is used to give the viewer time to read the temporary  image  file  before  gpg
              deletes  it  again.   Note that if your image viewer program is not secure, then executing it from
              gpg does not make it secure.

       <b>--exec-path</b> <u>string</u>
              Sets a list of directories to search for photo viewers If not provided photo viewers use the  <b>PATH</b>
              environment variable.

       <b>--keyring</b> <u>file</u>
              Add  <u>file</u>  to  the  current  list  of keyrings. If <u>file</u> begins with a tilde and a slash, these are
              replaced by the $HOME directory. If the filename does not contain a slash, it is assumed to be  in
              the GnuPG home directory ("<a href="file:~/.gnupg">~/.gnupg</a>" unless <b>--homedir</b> or $GNUPGHOME is used).

              Note  that  this adds a keyring to the current list. If the intent is to use the specified keyring
              alone, use <b>--keyring</b> along with <b>--no-default-keyring</b>.

              If the option <b>--no-keyring</b> has been used no keyrings will be used at all.

              Note that if the option <b>use-keyboxd</b> is enabled in ‘<u>common.conf</u>’, no keyrings are used at  all  and
              keys are all maintained by the keyboxd process in its own database.

       <b>--primary-keyring</b> <u>file</u>
              This  is  a varian of <b>--keyring</b> and designates <u>file</u> as the primary public keyring. This means that
              newly imported keys (via <b>--import</b> or keyserver <b>--recv-from</b>) will go to this keyring.

       <b>--secret-keyring</b> <u>file</u>
              This is an obsolete option and ignored.  All secret keys are  stored  in  the  ‘<u>private-keys-v1.d</u>’
              directory below the GnuPG home directory.

       <b>--trustdb-name</b> <u>file</u>
              Use  <u>file</u>  instead  of  the  default  trustdb.  If <u>file</u> begins with a tilde and a slash, these are
              replaced by the $HOME directory. If the filename does not contain a slash, it is assumed to be  in
              the GnuPG home directory (‘<u><a href="file:~/.gnupg">~/.gnupg</a></u>’ if <b>--homedir</b> or $GNUPGHOME is not used).

       <b>--homedir</b> <u>dir</u>
              Set the name of the home directory to <u>dir</u>. If this option is not used, the home directory defaults
              to  ‘<u><a href="file:~/.gnupg">~/.gnupg</a></u>’.  It is only recognized when given on the command line.  It also overrides any home
              directory stated through the environment variable ‘<u>GNUPGHOME</u>’ or (on Windows systems) by means  of
              the Registry entry <u>HKCU\Software\GNU\GnuPG:HomeDir</u>.

              On  Windows  systems it is possible to install GnuPG as a portable application.  In this case only
              this command line option is considered, all other ways to set a home directory are ignored.

       <b>--display-charset</b> <u>name</u>
              Set the name of the native character set. This is used to convert some informational strings  like
              user IDs to the proper UTF-8 encoding.  Note that this has nothing to do with the character set of
              data  to  be  encrypted or signed; GnuPG does not recode user-supplied data. If this option is not
              used, the default character set is determined from the current locale.  A  verbosity  level  of  3
              shows the chosen set.  This option should not be used on Windows.  Valid values for <u>name</u> are:

              <b>iso-8859-1</b>
                     This is the Latin 1 set.

              <b>iso-8859-2</b>
                     The Latin 2 set.

              <b>iso-8859-15</b>
                     This is currently an alias for the Latin 1 set.

              <b>koi8-r</b> The usual Russian set (RFC-1489).

              <b>utf-8</b>  Bypass all translations and assume that the OS uses native UTF-8 encoding.

       <b>--utf8-strings</b>
       <b>--no-utf8-strings</b>
              Assume  that command line arguments are given as UTF-8 strings. The default (<b>--no-utf8-strings</b>) is
              to assume that arguments are encoded in the character set as specified by <b>--display-charset</b>. These
              options affect all following arguments. Both options may be  used  multiple  times.   This  option
              should not be used in an option file.

              This  option  has  no effect on Windows.  There the internal used UTF-8 encoding is translated for
              console input and output.  The command line arguments are expected as Unicode  and  translated  to
              UTF-8.   Thus  when  calling  this  program  from another, make sure to use the Unicode version of
              CreateProcess.

       <b>--options</b> <u>file</u>
              Read options from <u>file</u> and do not try to read them from the default options file  in  the  homedir
              (see <b>--homedir</b>). This option is ignored if used in an options file.

       <b>--no-options</b>
              Shortcut  for  <b>--options</b>  <b>/dev/null</b>.  This  option is detected before an attempt to open an option
              file.  Using this option will also prevent the creation of a ‘<u><a href="file:~/.gnupg">~/.gnupg</a></u>’ homedir.

       <b>-z</b> <u>n</u>
       <b>--compress-level</b> <u>n</u>
       <b>--bzip2-compress-level</b> <u>n</u>
       <b>--no-compress</b>
              Set compression level to <u>n</u> for the ZIP and ZLIB compression algorithms. The default is to use  the
              default  compression level of zlib (normally 6). <b>--bzip2-compress-level</b> sets the compression level
              for the BZIP2 compression algorithm (defaulting to 6 as well). This is  a  different  option  from
              <b>--compress-level</b>  since  BZIP2 uses a significant amount of memory for each additional compression
              level.

              Option <b>-z</b> sets both. A value of 0 for <u>n</u> disables compression.  A value of  -1  forces  compression
              using the default level.  Option <b>--no-compress</b> is identical to <b>-z0</b>.

              Except  for  the  <b>--store</b>  command compression is always used unless <b>gpg</b> detects that the input is
              already compressed.  To inhibit the  use  of  compression  use  <b>-z0</b>  or  <b>--no-compress</b>;  to  force
              compression  use  <b>-z-1</b> or option <b>z</b> with another compression level than the default as indicated by
              -1.  Note that this overriding of the default deection works only with <b>z</b> and  not  with  the  long
              variant of this option.

       <b>--bzip2-decompress-lowmem</b>
              Use  a different decompression method for BZIP2 compressed files. This alternate method uses a bit
              more than half the memory, but also runs at half the speed.  This  is  useful  under  extreme  low
              memory circumstances when the file was originally compressed at a high <b>--bzip2-compress-level</b>.

       <b>--mangle-dos-filenames</b>
       <b>--no-mangle-dos-filenames</b>
              Older  version  of  Windows cannot handle filenames with more than one dot. <b>--mangle-dos-filenames</b>
              causes GnuPG to replace (rather than add to) the extension of an output  filename  to  avoid  this
              problem. This option is off by default and has no effect on non-Windows platforms.

       <b>--ask-cert-level</b>
       <b>--no-ask-cert-level</b>
              When  making  a  key signature, prompt for a certification level. If this option is not specified,
              the certification level  used  is  set  via  <b>--default-cert-level</b>.  See  <b>--default-cert-level</b>  for
              information  on  the  specific  levels  and  how  they are used. <b>--no-ask-cert-level</b> disables this
              option. This option defaults to no.

       <b>--default-cert-level</b> <u>n</u>
              The default to use for the check level when signing a key.

              0 means you make no particular claim as to how carefully you verified the key.

              1 means you believe the key is owned by the person who claims to own it but you could not, or  did
              not  verify the key at all. This is useful for a "persona" verification, where you sign the key of
              a pseudonymous user.

              2 means you did casual verification of the key. For example, this could mean that you verified the
              key fingerprint and checked the user ID on the key against a photo ID.

              3 means you did extensive verification of the key. For example, this could mean that you  verified
              the  key fingerprint with the owner of the key in person, and that you checked, by means of a hard
              to forge document with a photo ID (such as a passport) that the name of the key owner matches  the
              name  in  the  user  ID  on the key, and finally that you verified (by exchange of email) that the
              email address on the key belongs to the key owner.

              Note that the examples given above for levels 2 and 3 are just that: examples. In the end,  it  is
              up to you to decide just what "casual" and "extensive" mean to you.

              This option defaults to 0 (no particular claim).

       <b>--min-cert-level</b>
              When  building  the  trust database, treat any signatures with a certification level below this as
              invalid. Defaults to 2, which disregards level 1 signatures. Note  that  level  0  "no  particular
              claim" signatures are always accepted.

       <b>--trusted-key</b> <u>long</u> <u>key</u> <u>ID</u> <u>or</u> <u>fingerprint</u>
              Assume  that  the specified key (which should be given as fingerprint) is as trustworthy as one of
              your own secret keys. This option is useful if you don't want to keep your secret keys (or one  of
              them)  online but still want to be able to check the validity of a given recipient's or signator's
              key.  If the given key is not locally available but an LDAP keyserver is  configured  the  missing
              key is imported from that server.

       <b>--add-desig-revoker</b> <b>[sensitive:]</b><u>fingerprint</u>
              Add  the  key  specified  by  <u>fingerprint</u>  as  a designated revoker to newly created keys.  If the
              fingerprint is prefixed with the keyword ``sensitive:'' that info is normally not exported wit the
              key.  This option may be given several time to add more  than  one  designated  revoker.   If  the
              keyword  ``clear'' is used instead of a fingerprint, all designated options previously encountered
              are discarded.  Designated revokers  are  marked  on  the  key  as  non-revocable.   Note  that  a
              designated revoker specified using a parameter file will also be added to the key.

       <b>--trust-model</b> <b>{pgp|classic|tofu|tofu+pgp|direct|always|auto}</b>
              Set what trust model GnuPG should follow. The models are:

              <b>pgp</b>    This  is the Web of Trust combined with trust signatures as used in PGP 5.x and later. This
                     is the default trust model when creating a new trust database.

              <b>classic</b>
                     This is the standard Web of Trust as introduced by PGP 2.

              <b>tofu</b>

                     TOFU stands for Trust On First Use.  In this experimental trust model, the first time a key
                     is seen, it is memorized.  If later another key with a user id with the same email  address
                     is  seen,  both  keys are marked as suspect.  In that case, the next time either is used, a
                     warning is displayed describing the conflict, why it might have occurred (either  the  user
                     generated a new key and failed to cross sign the old and new keys, the key is forgery, or a
                     man-in-the-middle  attack is being attempted), and the user is prompted to manually confirm
                     the validity of the key in question.

                     Because a potential attacker is able to control the email address  and  thereby  circumvent
                     the conflict detection algorithm by using an email address that is similar in appearance to
                     a  trusted  email  address,  whenever a message is verified, statistics about the number of
                     messages signed with the key are shown.  In this way, a user can  easily  identify  attacks
                     using fake keys for regular correspondents.

                     When  compared with the Web of Trust, TOFU offers significantly weaker security guarantees.
                     In particular, TOFU only helps ensure consistency (that is, that the binding between a  key
                     and  email  address  doesn't change).  A major advantage of TOFU is that it requires little
                     maintenance to use correctly.  To use the web of trust properly, you need to actively  sign
                     keys and mark users as trusted introducers.  This is a time-consuming process and anecdotal
                     evidence  suggests  that  even  security-conscious  users  rarely  take the time to do this
                     thoroughly and instead rely on an ad-hoc TOFU process.

                     In the TOFU model, policies are associated with bindings between keys and  email  addresses
                     (which  are extracted from user ids and normalized).  There are five policies, which can be
                     set manually using the <b>--tofu-policy</b> option.  The default  policy  can  be  set  using  the
                     <b>--tofu-default-policy</b> option.

                     The  TOFU  policies  are:  <b>auto</b>,  <b>good</b>,  <b>unknown</b>,  <b>bad</b> and <b>ask</b>.  The <b>auto</b> policy is used by
                     default (unless overridden by <b>--tofu-default-policy</b>) and  marks  a  binding  as  marginally
                     trusted.   The  <b>good</b>,  <b>unknown</b>  and <b>bad</b> policies mark a binding as fully trusted, as having
                     unknown trust or as having trust never, respectively.  The <b>unknown</b>  policy  is  useful  for
                     just  using TOFU to detect conflicts, but to never assign positive trust to a binding.  The
                     final policy, <b>ask</b> prompts the user to indicate the  binding's  trust.   If  batch  mode  is
                     enabled  (or  input is inappropriate in the context), then the user is not prompted and the
                     <b>undefined</b> trust level is returned.

              <b>tofu+pgp</b>
                     This experimental trust model combines TOFU with  the  Web  of  Trust.   This  is  done  by
                     computing  the trust level for each model and then taking the maximum trust level where the
                     trust levels are ordered as follows: <b>unknown</b> <b>&lt;</b> <b>undefined</b> <b>&lt;</b> <b>marginal</b> <b>&lt;</b> <b>fully</b>  <b>&lt;</b>  <b>ultimate</b>  <b>&lt;</b>
                     <b>expired</b> <b>&lt;</b> <b>never</b>.

                     By  setting  <b>--tofu-default-policy=unknown</b>,  this model can be used to implement the web of
                     trust with TOFU's conflict detection algorithm, but  without  its  assignment  of  positive
                     trust values, which some security-conscious users don't like.

              <b>direct</b> Key  validity  is  set  directly by the user and not calculated via the Web of Trust.  This
                     model is solely based on the key and  does  not  distinguish  user  IDs.   Note  that  when
                     changing  to  another  trust  model the trust values assigned to a key are transformed into
                     ownertrust values, which also indicate how you trust the owner of the  key  to  sign  other
                     keys.

              <b>always</b> Skip  key  validation and assume that used keys are always fully valid. You generally won't
                     use this unless you are using some external validation scheme. This option also  suppresses
                     the "[uncertain]" tag printed with signature checks when there is no evidence that the user
                     ID  is  bound  to  the  key.   Note  that  this trust model still does not allow the use of
                     expired, revoked, or disabled keys.

              <b>auto</b>   Select the trust model depending on whatever the internal trust database says. This is  the
                     default  model  if  such  a  database  already exists.  Note that a tofu trust model is not
                     considered here and must be enabled explicitly.

       <b>--always-trust</b>
              Identical to <b>--trust-model</b> <b>always</b>.

       <b>--assert-signer</b> <u>fpr_or_file</u>
              This option checks whether at least one valid signature on a file has been made with the specified
              key.  The key is  either  specified  as  a  fingerprint  or  a  file  listing  fingerprints.   The
              fingerprint  must  be  given  or  listed in compact format (no colons or spaces in between).  This
              option can be given multiple times and each fingerprint is checked against the signing key as well
              as the corresponding primary key.  If <u>fpr_or_file</u> specifies a file, empty  lines  are  ignored  as
              well as all lines starting with a hash sign.  With this option gpg is guaranteed to return with an
              exit  code of 0 if and only if a signature has been encountered, is valid, and the key matches one
              of the fingerprints given by this option.

       <b>--assert-pubkey-algo</b> <u>algolist</u>
              During data signature verification this options checks  whether  the  used  public  key  algorithm
              matches  the algorithms given by <u>algolist</u>.  This option can be given multiple times to concatenate
              more algorithms to the list; the delimiter of the list are either commas or spaces.

              The algorithm names given in the list may either be verbatim names like "ed25519" with an optional
              leading single equal sign, or being prefixed with "&gt;", "&gt;=", "&lt;=", or "&lt;".  That  prefix  operator
              is  applied  to  the  number  part  of the algorithm name; for example 2048 in "rsa2048" or 384 in
              "brainpoolP384r1".  If the the leading non-digits in the name matches, the prefix operator is used
              to compare the number part, a trailing suffix is ignored in this case.  For example  an  algorithm
              list  "&gt;rsa3000,  &gt;=brainpool384r1,  =ed25519"  allows  RSA  signatures  with more that 3000 bits,
              Brainpool curves 384 and 512, and the ed25519 algorithm.

              With this option gpg (and also gpgv) is guaranteed to return with an exit code of 0 if and only if
              all valid signatures on data are made using a matching algorithm from the given list.

       <b>--auto-key-locate</b> <u>mechanisms</u>
       <b>--no-auto-key-locate</b>
              GnuPG can automatically locate and retrieve keys as needed using this option.  This  happens  when
              encrypting   to   an   email   address   (in  the  "<a href="mailto:user@example.com">user@example.com</a>"  form),  and  there  are  no
              "<a href="mailto:user@example.com">user@example.com</a>" keys on the local keyring.  This option takes  any  number  of  the  mechanisms
              listed  below,  in  the  order  they  are to be tried.  Instead of listing the mechanisms as comma
              delimited arguments, the option may also be given several times to add more mechanism.  The option
              <b>--no-auto-key-locate</b> or the mechanism "clear" resets the list.  The default is "local,wkd".

              <b>cert</b>   Locate a key using DNS CERT, as specified in RFC-4398.

              <b>dane</b>   Locate a key using DANE, as specified in draft-ietf-dane-openpgpkey-05.txt.

              <b>wkd</b>    Locate a key using the Web Key Directory protocol.

              <b>ldap</b>   Using DNS Service Discovery, check the domain in question for any LDAP keyservers  to  use.
                     If  this  fails,  attempt  to  locate  the  key  using the PGP Universal method of checking
                     ‘ldap://keys.(thedomain)’.

              <b>ntds</b>   Locate the key using the Active Directory (Windows only).  This method also allows  one  to
                     search by fingerprint using the command <b>--locate-external-key</b>.  Note that this mechanism is
                     actually a shortcut for the mechanism ‘keyserver’ but using "ldap:///" as the keyserver.

              <b>keyserver</b>
                     Locate a key using a keyserver.  This method also allows one to search by fingerprint using
                     the command <b>--locate-external-key</b> if any of the configured keyservers is an LDAP server.

              <b>keyserver-URL</b>
                     In addition, a keyserver URL as used in the <b>dirmngr</b> configuration may be used here to query
                     that  particular keyserver.  This method also allows one to search by fingerprint using the
                     command <b>--locate-external-key</b> if the URL specifies an LDAP server.

              <b>local</b>  Locate the key using the local keyrings.  This mechanism allows  the  user  to  select  the
                     order  a  local  key  lookup is done.  Thus using ‘--auto-key-locate local’ is identical to
                     <b>--no-auto-key-locate</b>.

              <b>nodefault</b>
                     This flag disables the standard local key lookup, done before any of the mechanisms defined
                     by the <b>--auto-key-locate</b> are tried.  The position of this mechanism in the  list  does  not
                     matter.  It is not required if <b>local</b> is also used.

              <b>clear</b>  Clear  all  defined  mechanisms.   This  is useful to override mechanisms given in a config
                     file.  Note that a <b>nodefault</b> in <u>mechanisms</u> will also be cleared unless it  is  given  after
                     the <b>clear</b>.

       <b>--auto-key-import</b>
       <b>--no-auto-key-import</b>
              This  is  an  offline  mechanism  to  get  a  missing key for signature verification and for later
              encryption to this key.  If this option is enabled and a signature includes an embedded key,  that
              key  is  used to verify the signature and on verification success the key is imported. The default
              is <b>--no-auto-key-import</b>.

              On the sender (signing) site the option <b>--include-key-block</b> needs to be used  to  put  the  public
              part of the signing key as “Key Block subpacket” into the signature.

       <b>--auto-key-retrieve</b>
       <b>--no-auto-key-retrieve</b>
              These  options  enable or disable the automatic retrieving of keys from a keyserver when verifying
              signatures made by keys that are not on the local keyring.  The default is <b>--no-auto-key-retrieve</b>.

              The order of methods tried to lookup the key is:

              1. If the option <b>--auto-key-import</b> is set and the signatures includes an embedded key, that key is
              used to verify the signature and on verification success that key is imported.

              2. If a preferred keyserver is specified in the signature and the  option  <b>honor-keyserver-url</b>  is
              active  (which  is  not  the  default),  that  keyserver  is  tried.  Note that the creator of the
              signature uses the  option  <b>--sig-keyserver-url</b>  to  specify  the  preferred  keyserver  for  data
              signatures.

              3.  If the signature has the Signer's UID set (e.g. using <b>--sender</b> while creating the signature) a
              Web Key Directory (WKD) lookup is done.  This is the default configuration but can be disabled  by
              removing WKD from the auto-key-locate list or by using the option <b>--disable-signer-uid</b>.

              4. If any keyserver is configured and the Issuer Fingerprint is part of the signature (since GnuPG
              2.1.16), the configured keyservers are tried.

              Note  that  this  option makes a "web bug" like behavior possible.  Keyserver or Web Key Directory
              operators can see which keys you request, so by sending you a message signed by a  brand  new  key
              (which  you  naturally  will  not  have on your local keyring), the operator can tell both your IP
              address and the time when you verified the signature.

       <b>--keyid-format</b> <b>{none|short|0xshort|long|0xlong}</b>
              Select how to display key IDs.  "none" does not show the key ID at all but shows  the  fingerprint
              in  a  separate line.  "short" is the traditional 8-character key ID.  "long" is the more accurate
              (but less convenient) 16-character key ID.  Add an "0x" to  either  to  include  an  "0x"  at  the
              beginning  of  the  key  ID,  as  in  0x99242560.   Note that this option is ignored if the option
              <b>--with-colons</b> is used.

       <b>--keyserver</b> <u>name</u>
              This option is deprecated - please use the <b>--keyserver</b> in ‘<u>dirmngr.conf</u>’ instead.

              Use <u>name</u> as your keyserver. This is the server that <b>--receive-keys</b>, <b>--send-keys</b>, and <b>--search-keys</b>
              will communicate with to receive keys from, send keys to, and search for keys on.  The  format  of
              the  <u>name</u>  is  a  URI:  `scheme:[//]keyservername[:port]'  The  scheme  is  the type of keyserver:
              "hkp"/"hkps" for the HTTP (or compatible) keyservers or "ldap"/"ldaps" for  the  LDAP  keyservers.
              Note  that your particular installation of GnuPG may have other keyserver types available as well.
              Keyserver schemes are case-insensitive.

              Most keyservers synchronize with each other, so there is generally no need to send  keys  to  more
              than  one  server.  The  keyserver  <b>hkp://keys.gnupg.net</b>  uses round robin DNS to give a different
              keyserver each time you use it.

       <b>--keyserver-options</b> <b>{</b><u>name</u><b>=</b><u>value</u><b>}</b>
              This is a space or comma delimited string that gives options for the  keyserver.  Options  can  be
              prefixed  with a `no-' to give the opposite meaning. Valid import-options or export-options may be
              used here as well to apply to importing (<b>--recv-key</b>)  or  exporting  (<b>--send-key</b>)  a  key  from  a
              keyserver. While not all options are available for all keyserver types, some common options are:

              <b>include-revoked</b>
                     When  searching for a key with <b>--search-keys</b>, include keys that are marked on the keyserver
                     as revoked. Note that not all keyservers differentiate between revoked and unrevoked  keys,
                     and  for  such keyservers this option is meaningless. Note also that most keyservers do not
                     have cryptographic verification of key revocations, and so  turning  this  option  off  may
                     result in skipping keys that are incorrectly marked as revoked.

              <b>include-disabled</b>
                     When  searching for a key with <b>--search-keys</b>, include keys that are marked on the keyserver
                     as disabled. Note that this option is not used with HKP keyservers.

              <b>auto-key-retrieve</b>
                     This is an obsolete alias for the option <b>auto-key-retrieve</b>.  Please do not use it; it  will
                     be removed in future versions..

              <b>honor-keyserver-url</b>
                     When  using  <b>--refresh-keys</b>, if the key in question has a preferred keyserver URL, then use
                     that preferred keyserver to refresh the key from. In addition, if auto-key-retrieve is set,
                     and the signature being verified has a preferred keyserver URL,  then  use  that  preferred
                     keyserver  to fetch the key from. Note that this option introduces a "web bug": The creator
                     of the key can see when the keys is refreshed.  Thus this option is not enabled by default.

              <b>include-subkeys</b>
                     When receiving a key, include subkeys as potential targets. Note that this  option  is  not
                     used with HKP keyservers, as they do not support retrieving keys by subkey id.

              <b>timeout</b>
              <b>http-proxy=</b><u>value</u>
              <b>verbose</b>
              <b>debug</b>
              <b>check-cert</b>

              <b>ca-cert-file</b>
                     These options have no more function since GnuPG 2.1.  Use the <b>dirmngr</b> configuration options
                     instead.

       The  default list of options is: "self-sigs-only, repair-keys, repair-pks-subkey-bug, export-attributes".
       However, if the actual used source is an LDAP server "no-self-sigs-only" is  assumed  unless  "self-sigs-
       only" has been explicitly configured.

       <b>--completes-needed</b> <u>n</u>
              Number of completely trusted users to introduce a new key signer (defaults to 1).

       <b>--marginals-needed</b> <u>n</u>
              Number of marginally trusted users to introduce a new key signer (defaults to 3)

       <b>--tofu-default-policy</b> <b>{auto|good|unknown|bad|ask}</b>
              The  default  TOFU  policy  (defaults  to  <b>auto</b>).   For more information about the meaning of this
              option, see: [trust-model-tofu].

       <b>--max-cert-depth</b> <u>n</u>
              Maximum depth of a certification chain (default is 5).

       <b>--no-sig-cache</b>
              Do not cache the verification status of key signatures.  Caching gives a much  better  performance
              in  key  listings.  However,  if  you  suspect  that your public keyring is not safe against write
              modifications, you can use this option to disable the caching. It probably does not make sense  to
              disable  it because all kind of damage can be done if someone else has write access to your public
              keyring.

       <b>--auto-check-trustdb</b>
       <b>--no-auto-check-trustdb</b>
              If GnuPG feels that its information about the Web of Trust has to  be  updated,  it  automatically
              runs   the   <b>--check-trustdb</b>   command   internally.   This  may  be  a  time  consuming  process.
              <b>--no-auto-check-trustdb</b> disables this option.

       <b>--use-agent</b>
       <b>--no-use-agent</b>
              This is dummy option. <b>gpg</b> always requires the agent.

       <b>--gpg-agent-info</b>
              This is dummy option. It has no effect when used with <b>gpg</b>.

       <b>--agent-program</b> <u>file</u>
              Specify an agent program to be used for secret key operations.  The default value is determined by
              running <b>gpgconf</b> with the option <b>--list-dirs</b>.  Note  that  the  pipe  symbol  (<b>|</b>)  is  used  for  a
              regression test suite hack and may thus not be used in the file name.

       <b>--dirmngr-program</b> <u>file</u>
              Specify   a   dirmngr   program   to   be  used  for  keyserver  access.   The  default  value  is
              ‘<u><a href="file:///usr/lib/w3m/cgi-bin/w3mman2html.cgi?dirmngr">/usr/bin/dirmngr</a></u>’.

       <b>--disable-dirmngr</b>
              Entirely disable the use of the Dirmngr.

       <b>--no-autostart</b>
              Do not start the gpg-agent or the dirmngr if it has not  yet  been  started  and  its  service  is
              required.   This  option  is  mostly useful on machines where the connection to gpg-agent has been
              redirected to another machines.  If dirmngr is required on the remote machine, it may  be  started
              manually using <b>gpgconf</b> <b>--launch</b> <b>dirmngr</b>.

       <b>--lock-once</b>
              Lock  the  databases  the  first  time  a  lock is requested and do not release the lock until the
              process terminates.

       <b>--lock-multiple</b>
              Release the locks every time a lock  is  no  longer  needed.  Use  this  to  override  a  previous
              <b>--lock-once</b> from a config file.

       <b>--lock-never</b>
              Disable  locking  entirely. This option should be used only in very special environments, where it
              can be assured that only one process is accessing those files. A bootable  floppy  with  a  stand-
              alone encryption system will probably use this. Improper usage of this option may lead to data and
              key corruption.

       <b>--exit-on-status-write-error</b>
              This  option  will  cause write errors on the status FD to immediately terminate the process. That
              should in fact be the default but it never worked this way and thus we need an  option  to  enable
              this,  so  that the change won't break applications which close their end of a status fd connected
              pipe too early. Using this option along with  <b>--enable-progress-filter</b>  may  be  used  to  cleanly
              cancel long running gpg operations.

       <b>--limit-card-insert-tries</b> <u>n</u>
              With <u>n</u> greater than 0 the number of prompts asking to insert a smartcard gets limited to N-1. Thus
              with a value of 1 gpg won't at all ask to insert a card if none has been inserted at startup. This
              option  is  useful  in  the  configuration  file  in  case  an application does not know about the
              smartcard support and waits ad infinitum for an inserted card.

       <b>--no-random-seed-file</b>
              GnuPG uses a file to  store  its  internal  random  pool  over  invocations.   This  makes  random
              generation  faster; however sometimes write operations are not desired. This option can be used to
              achieve that with the cost of slower random generation.

       <b>--no-greeting</b>
              Suppress the initial copyright message.

       <b>--no-secmem-warning</b>
              Suppress the warning about "using insecure memory".

       <b>--no-permission-warning</b>
              Suppress the warning about unsafe file and home directory (<b>--homedir</b>) permissions. Note  that  the
              permission checks that GnuPG performs are not intended to be authoritative, but rather they simply
              warn about certain common permission problems. Do not assume that the lack of a warning means that
              your system is secure.

              Note  that the warning for unsafe <b>--homedir</b> permissions cannot be suppressed in the gpg.conf file,
              as this would allow an attacker to place an unsafe gpg.conf file in place, and use  this  file  to
              suppress  warnings  about  itself. The <b>--homedir</b> permissions warning may only be suppressed on the
              command line.

       <b>--require-secmem</b>
       <b>--no-require-secmem</b>
              Refuse to run if GnuPG cannot get secure memory. Defaults to no (i.e. run, but give a warning).

       <b>--require-cross-certification</b>
       <b>--no-require-cross-certification</b>
              When verifying a signature  made  from  a  subkey,  ensure  that  the  cross  certification  "back
              signature"  on  the  subkey  is  present and valid.  This protects against a subtle attack against
              subkeys that can sign.  Defaults to <b>--require-cross-certification</b> for <b>gpg</b>.

       <b>--expert</b>
       <b>--no-expert</b>
              Allow the user to do certain nonsensical or "silly" things like signing an expired or revoked key,
              or certain potentially incompatible things like generating unusual key types. This  also  disables
              certain  warning messages about potentially incompatible actions. As the name implies, this option
              is for experts only. If you don't fully understand the implications of what it allows you  to  do,
              leave this off. <b>--no-expert</b> disables this option.

   <b>Key</b> <b>related</b> <b>options</b>

       <b>--recipient</b> <u>name</u>
       <b>-r</b>     Encrypt  for  user  id <u>name</u>. If this option or <b>--hidden-recipient</b> is not specified, GnuPG asks for
              the user-id unless <b>--default-recipient</b> is given.

       <b>--hidden-recipient</b> <u>name</u>
       <b>-R</b>     Encrypt for user ID <u>name</u>, but hide the key ID of this user's key. This option helps  to  hide  the
              receiver  of  the message and is a limited countermeasure against traffic analysis. If this option
              or <b>--recipient</b> is not specified, GnuPG asks for the user ID unless <b>--default-recipient</b> is given.

       <b>--recipient-file</b> <u>file</u>
       <b>-f</b>     This option is similar to <b>--recipient</b> except that it encrypts to a key stored in the  given  file.
              <u>file</u> must be the name of a file containing exactly one key.  <b>gpg</b> assumes that the key in this file
              is fully valid.

       <b>--hidden-recipient-file</b> <u>file</u>
       <b>-F</b>     This  option is similar to <b>--hidden-recipient</b> except that it encrypts to a key stored in the given
              file.  <u>file</u> must be the name of a file containing exactly one key.  <b>gpg</b> assumes that  the  key  in
              this file is fully valid.

       <b>--encrypt-to</b> <u>name</u>
              Same as <b>--recipient</b> but this one is intended for use in the options file and may be used with your
              own  user-id  as  an  "encrypt-to-self".  These keys are only used when there are other recipients
              given either by use of <b>--recipient</b> or by the asked user id.  No trust checking  is  performed  for
              these user ids and even disabled keys can be used.

       <b>--hidden-encrypt-to</b> <u>name</u>
              Same  as  <b>--hidden-recipient</b>  but this one is intended for use in the options file and may be used
              with your own user-id as a hidden "encrypt-to-self". These keys are only used when there are other
              recipients given either by use of <b>--recipient</b> or by the asked  user  id.   No  trust  checking  is
              performed for these user ids and even disabled keys can be used.

       <b>--no-encrypt-to</b>
              Disable the use of all <b>--encrypt-to</b> and <b>--hidden-encrypt-to</b> keys.

       <b>--group</b> <b>{</b><u>name</u><b>=</b><u>value</u><b>}</b>
              Sets  up a named group, which is similar to aliases in email programs.  Any time the group name is
              a recipient (<b>-r</b> or <b>--recipient</b>), it will be expanded to the values specified. Multiple groups with
              the same name are automatically merged into a single group.

              The values are <b>key</b> <b>IDs</b> or fingerprints, but any key description is accepted.  Note  that  a  value
              with  spaces  in  it will be treated as two different values. Note also there is only one level of
              expansion --- you cannot make an group that points to another group. When used  from  the  command
              line,  it may be necessary to quote the argument to this option to prevent the shell from treating
              it as multiple arguments.

       <b>--ungroup</b> <u>name</u>
              Remove a given entry from the <b>--group</b> list.

       <b>--no-groups</b>
              Remove all entries from the <b>--group</b> list.

       <b>--local-user</b> <u>name</u>
       <b>-u</b>     Use <u>name</u> as the key to sign with. Note that this option overrides <b>--default-key</b>.

       <b>--sender</b> <u>mbox</u>
              This option has two purposes.  <u>mbox</u> must either be a complete user ID  containing  a  proper  mail
              address or just a plain mail address.  The option can be given multiple times.

              When  creating  a  signature  this  option  tells  gpg  the signing key's user id used to make the
              signature and embeds that user ID into the created signature (using OpenPGP's ``Signer's User ID''
              subpacket).  If the option is given multiple times a suitable user ID is picked.  However, if  the
              signing key was specified directly by using a mail address (i.e. not by using a fingerprint or key
              ID) this option is used and the mail address is embedded in the created signature.

              When  verifying  a  signature <u>mbox</u> is used to restrict the information printed by the TOFU code to
              matching user IDs.  If the option is used and  the  signature  contains  a  ``Signer's  User  ID''
              subpacket  that  information is is also used to restrict the printed information.  Note that GnuPG
              considers only the mail address part of a User ID.

              If this option or the said subpacket is available the TRUST lines as printed by  option  <b>status-fd</b>
              correspond  to  the  corresponding  User  ID;  if no User ID is known the TRUST lines are computed
              directly on the key and do not give any information about the User ID.  In the latter case it  his
              highly  recommended to scripts and other frontends to evaluate the VALIDSIG line, retrieve the key
              and print all User IDs along with their validity (trust) information.

       <b>--try-secret-key</b> <u>name</u>
              For hidden recipients GPG needs to know the keys to use for trial decryption.  The  key  set  with
              <b>--default-key</b> is always tried first, but this is often not sufficient.  This option allows setting
              more  keys  to be used for trial decryption.  Although any valid user-id specification may be used
              for <u>name</u> it makes sense to use at least the long keyid to avoid ambiguities.  Note that  gpg-agent
              might  pop  up  a  pinentry  for  a  lot keys to do the trial decryption.  If you want to stop all
              further trial decryption you may use close-window button instead of the cancel button.

       <b>--try-all-secrets</b>
              Don't look at the key ID as stored in the message but try all secret keys  in  turn  to  find  the
              right decryption key. This option forces the behaviour as used by anonymous recipients (created by
              using  <b>--throw-keyids</b>  or  <b>--hidden-recipient</b>)  and  might  come  handy in case where an encrypted
              message contains a bogus key ID.

       <b>--skip-hidden-recipients</b>
       <b>--no-skip-hidden-recipients</b>
              During decryption skip all anonymous recipients.  This option helps in the case  that  people  use
              the  hidden  recipients  feature  to  hide  their own encrypt-to key from others.  If one has many
              secret keys this may lead to a major annoyance because all keys  are  tried  in  turn  to  decrypt
              something  which  was  not  really  intended  for  it.   The drawback of this option is that it is
              currently not possible to decrypt a message which includes real anonymous recipients.

   <b>Input</b> <b>and</b> <b>Output</b>

       <b>--armor</b>
       <b>-a</b>     Create ASCII armored output.  The default is to create the binary OpenPGP format.

       <b>--no-armor</b>
              Assume the input data is not in ASCII armored format.

       <b>--output</b> <u>file</u>
       <b>-o</b> <u>file</u>
              Write output to <u>file</u>.  To write to stdout use <b>-</b> as the filename.

       <b>--max-output</b> <u>n</u>
              This option sets a limit on the number of bytes that will be generated  when  processing  a  file.
              Since OpenPGP supports various levels of compression, it is possible that the plaintext of a given
              message  may be significantly larger than the original OpenPGP message. While GnuPG works properly
              with such messages, there is often a desire to set a maximum file  size  that  will  be  generated
              before processing is forced to stop by the OS limits. Defaults to 0, which means "no limit".

       <b>--chunk-size</b> <u>n</u>
              The  AEAD  encryption  mode  encrypts  the  data  in chunks so that a receiving side can check for
              transmission errors or tampering at the end of each chunk and does not need to  delay  this  until
              all data has been received.  The used chunk size is 2^<u>n</u> byte.  The lowest allowed value for <u>n</u> is 6
              (64 byte) and the largest is the default of 22 which creates chunks not larger than 4 MiB.

       <b>--input-size-hint</b> <u>n</u>
              This  option  can  be  used to tell GPG the size of the input data in bytes.  <u>n</u> must be a positive
              base-10 number.  This option is only useful if the input is not taken from a file.   GPG  may  use
              this  hint  to  optimize  its buffer allocation strategy.  It is also used by the <b>--status-fd</b> line
              ``PROGRESS'' to provide a value for ``total'' if that is not available by other means.

       <b>--key-origin</b> <u>string</u><b>[,</b><u>url</u><b>]</b>
              gpg can track the origin of a key. Certain origins are implicitly known (e.g. keyserver,  web  key
              directory)  and  set.   For a standard import the origin of the keys imported can be set with this
              option.  To list the possible values use "help" for <u>string</u>.  Some origins can  store  an  optional
              <u>url</u> argument.  That URL can appended to <u>string</u> after a comma.

       <b>--import-options</b> <u>parameters</u>
              This  is  a  space or comma delimited string that gives options for importing keys. Options can be
              prepended with a `no-' to give the opposite meaning. The options are:

              <b>import-local-sigs</b>
                     Allow importing key signatures marked as "local". This is not  generally  useful  unless  a
                     shared keyring scheme is being used.  Defaults to no.

              <b>keep-ownertrust</b>
                     Normally  possible  still  existing  ownertrust  values  of  a  key are cleared if a key is
                     imported.  This  is  in  general  desirable  so  that  a  formerly  deleted  key  does  not
                     automatically  gain  an  ownertrust  values  merely due to import.  On the other hand it is
                     sometimes necessary to re-import a trusted set of keys again but keeping  already  assigned
                     ownertrust values.  This can be achieved by using this option.

              <b>repair-pks-subkey-bug</b>
                     During  import,  attempt  to repair the damage caused by the PKS keyserver bug (pre version
                     0.9.6) that mangles keys with multiple subkeys. Note that this cannot completely repair the
                     damaged key as some crucial data is removed by the keyserver, but it does at least give you
                     back  one  subkey.  Defaults  to  no  for  regular  <b>--import</b>  and  to  yes  for   keyserver
                     <b>--receive-keys</b>.

              <b>import-show</b>
              <b>show-only</b>
                     Show a listing of the key as imported right before it is stored.  This can be combined with
                     the  option  <b>--dry-run</b>  to  only  look at keys; the option <b>show-only</b> is a shortcut for this
                     combination.  The command <b>--show-keys</b> is another shortcut for  this.   Note  that  suffixes
                     like '#' for "sec" and "sbb" lines may or may not be printed.

              <b>import-export</b>
                     Run  the entire import code but instead of storing the key to the local keyring write it to
                     the output.  The export option <b>export-dane</b> affect the output.  This option can for  example
                     be used to remove all invalid parts from a key without the need to store it.

              <b>merge-only</b>
                     During  import,  allow  key  updates  to existing keys, but do not allow any new keys to be
                     imported. Defaults to no.

              <b>import-clean</b>
                     After import, compact (remove all signatures except the self-signature) any user  IDs  from
                     the new key that are not usable.  Then, remove any signatures from the new key that are not
                     usable.   This  includes  signatures  that  were issued by keys that are not present on the
                     keyring. This option is the same as running the <b>--edit-key</b> command  "clean"  after  import.
                     Defaults to no.

              <b>self-sigs-only</b>
                     Accept only self-signatures while importing a key.  All other key signatures are skipped at
                     an early import stage.  This option can be used with <b>keyserver-options</b> to mitigate attempts
                     to  flood  a  key  with  bogus signatures from a keyserver.  The drawback is that all other
                     valid key signatures, as required by the Web of Trust are also  not  imported.   Note  that
                     when  using  this  option  along with import-clean it suppresses the final clean step after
                     merging the imported key into the existing key.

              <b>ignore-attributes</b>
                     Ignore all attribute user IDs (photo IDs) and their signatures while importing a key.

              <b>repair-keys</b>
                     After import, fix various problems with the keys.  For example, this  reorders  signatures,
                     and strips duplicate signatures.  Defaults to yes.

              <b>bulk-import</b>
                     When used the keyboxd (option <b>use-keyboxd</b> in ‘<u>common.conf</u>’) does the import within a single
                     transaction.

              <b>import-minimal</b>
                     Import  the smallest key possible. This removes all signatures except the most recent self-
                     signature on each user ID. This option is  the  same  as  running  the  <b>--edit-key</b>  command
                     "minimize" after import.  Defaults to no.

              <b>restore</b>
              <b>import-restore</b>
                     Import  in key restore mode.  This imports all data which is usually skipped during import;
                     including all GnuPG specific data.  All other contradicting options are overridden.

       <b>--import-filter</b> <b>{</b><u>name</u><b>=</b><u>expr</u><b>}</b>
       <b>--export-filter</b> <b>{</b><u>name</u><b>=</b><u>expr</u><b>}</b>
              These options define an import/export filter which are applied to the  imported/exported  keyblock
              right  before  it  will  be  stored/written.   <u>name</u>  defines  the  type of filter to use, <u>expr</u> the
              expression to evaluate.  The option can be used several times which then appends  more  expression
              to the same <u>name</u>.

              The available filter types are:

              <b>keep-uid</b>
                     This  filter  will  keep  a user id packet and its dependent packets in the keyblock if the
                     expression evaluates to true.

              <b>drop-subkey</b>
                     This filter drops the selected subkeys.  Currently only implemented for --export-filter.

              <b>drop-sig</b>
                     This filter drops the selected  key  signatures  on  user  ids.   Self-signatures  are  not
                     considered.  Currently only implemented for --import-filter.

              <b>select</b> This filter is only implemented by <b>--list-filter</b>.  All property names may be used.

       For  the  syntax  of  the  expression  see  the chapter "FILTER EXPRESSIONS".  The property names for the
       expressions depend on the actual filter type and are indicated in the following  table.   Note  that  all
       property names may also be used by <b>--list-filter</b>.

       Property  names  may  be prefix with a scope delimited by a slash.  Valid scopes are "pub" for public and
       secret primary keys, "sub" for public and secret subkeys, "uid" for for user-ID packets,  and  "sig"  for
       signature packets.  Invalid scopes are currently ignored.

       The available properties are:

              <b>uid</b>    A string with the user id.  (keep-uid)

              <b>mbox</b>   The addr-spec part of a user id with mailbox or the empty string.  (keep-uid)

              <b>algostr</b>
                     A string with the key algorithm description.  For example "rsa3072" or "ed25519".

              <b>key_algo</b>
                     A number with the public key algorithm of a key or subkey packet.  (drop-subkey)

              <b>key_size</b>
                     A number with the effective key size of a key or subkey packet.  (drop-subkey)

              <b>key_created</b>
              <b>key_created_d</b>
                     The  first  is  the timestamp a public key or subkey packet was created.  The second is the
                     same but given as an ISO string, e.g. "2016-08-17". (drop-subkey)

              <b>key_expires</b>
              <b>key_expires_d</b>
                     The expiration time of a public key or subkey or 0 if it does not expire.   The  second  is
                     the same but given as an ISO date string or an empty string e.g. "2038-01-19".

              <b>fpr</b>    The hexified fingerprint of the current subkey or primary key.  (drop-subkey)

              <b>primary</b>
                     Boolean indicating whether the user id is the primary one.  (keep-uid)

              <b>expired</b>
                     Boolean indicating whether a user id (keep-uid), a key (drop-subkey), or a signature (drop-
                     sig) expired.

              <b>revoked</b>
                     Boolean indicating whether a user id (keep-uid) or a key (drop-subkey) has been revoked.

              <b>disabled</b>
                     Boolean indicating whether a primary key is disabled.

              <b>secret</b> Boolean indicating whether a key or subkey is a secret one.  (drop-subkey)

              <b>usage</b>  A  string  indicating  the  usage  flags  for the subkey, from the sequence ``ecsa?''.  For
                     example, a subkey capable of just signing and authentication would be an  exact  match  for
                     ``sa''. (drop-subkey)

              <b>sig_created</b>
              <b>sig_created_d</b>
                     The  first  is  the  timestamp  a signature packet was created.  The second is the same but
                     given as an ISO date string, e.g. "2016-08-17". (drop-sig)

              <b>sig_expires</b>
              <b>sig_expires_d</b>
                     The expiration time of a signature packet or 0 if it does not expire.  The  second  is  the
                     same but given as an ISO date string or an empty string e.g. "2038-01-19".

              <b>sig_algo</b>
                     A number with the public key algorithm of a signature packet. (drop-sig)

              <b>sig_digest_algo</b>
                     A number with the digest algorithm of a signature packet. (drop-sig)

              <b>origin</b> A string with the key origin or a question mark.  For example the string ``wkd'' is used if
                     a key originated from a Web Key Directory lookup.

              <b>lastupd</b>
                     The timestamp the key was last updated from a keyserver or the Web Key Directory.

              <b>url</b>    A string with the the URL associated wit the last key lookup.

       <b>--export-options</b> <u>parameters</u>
              This  is  a space or comma delimited string that gives options for exporting keys.  Options can be
              prepended with a `no-' to give the opposite meaning.  The options are:

              <b>export-local-sigs</b>
                     Allow exporting key signatures marked as "local". This is not  generally  useful  unless  a
                     shared keyring scheme is being used.  Defaults to no.

              <b>export-attributes</b>
                     Include attribute user IDs (photo IDs) while exporting. Not including attribute user IDs is
                     useful  to export keys that are going to be used by an OpenPGP program that does not accept
                     attribute user IDs.  Defaults to yes.

              <b>export-sensitive-revkeys</b>
                     Include designated revoker information that was marked as "sensitive". Defaults to no.

              <b>backup</b>
              <b>export-backup</b>
                     Export for use as a backup.  The exported data includes all data which is needed to restore
                     the key or keys later with GnuPG.  The format is basically the OpenPGP format but  enhanced
                     with GnuPG specific data.  All other contradicting options are overridden.

              <b>export-clean</b>
                     Compact (remove all signatures from) user IDs on the key being exported if the user IDs are
                     not  usable.  Also,  do  not  export  any  signatures  that  are  not usable. This includes
                     signatures that were issued by keys that are not present on the keyring. This option is the
                     same as running the <b>--edit-key</b> command "clean" before export except that the local copy  of
                     the key is not modified. Defaults to no.

              <b>export-minimal</b>
                     Export  the smallest key possible. This removes all signatures except the most recent self-
                     signature on each user ID. This option is  the  same  as  running  the  <b>--edit-key</b>  command
                     "minimize" before export except that the local copy of the key is not modified. Defaults to
                     no.

              <b>export-revocs</b>
                     Export  only  standalone  revocation  certificates of the key.  This option does not export
                     revocations of 3rd party certificate revocations.

              <b>export-dane</b>
                     Instead of outputting the key material output OpenPGP DANE records suitable to put into DNS
                     zone files.  An ORIGIN line is printed before each record to allow diverting the records to
                     the corresponding zone file.

              <b>mode1003</b>
                     Enable the use of a new secret key export format.  This format avoids the re-encryption  as
                     required  with  the current OpenPGP format and also improves the security of the secret key
                     if it has been protected with a passphrase.  Note that an unprotected key is exported as-is
                     and thus not secure; the general rule to convey secret keys in an  OpenPGP  encrypted  file
                     still applies with this mode.  Versions of GnuPG before 2.4.0 are not able to import such a
                     secret file.

       <b>--with-colons</b>
              Print  key  listings delimited by colons. Note that the output will be encoded in UTF-8 regardless
              of any <b>--display-charset</b> setting. This format is useful when GnuPG  is  called  from  scripts  and
              other  programs  as  it is easily machine parsed. The details of this format are documented in the
              file ‘<u>doc/DETAILS</u>’, which is included in the GnuPG source distribution.

       <b>--fixed-list-mode</b>
              Do not merge primary user ID and primary key in <b>--with-colon</b> listing mode and print all timestamps
              as seconds since 1970-01-01.  Since GnuPG 2.0.10, this mode is always used and thus this option is
              obsolete; it does not harm to use it though.

       <b>--legacy-list-mode</b>
              Revert to the pre-2.1 public key list mode.  This only affects the human readable output  and  not
              the  machine interface (i.e. <b>--with-colons</b>).  Note that the legacy format does not convey suitable
              information for elliptic curves.

       <b>--with-fingerprint</b>
              Same as the command <b>--fingerprint</b> but changes only the format  of  the  output  and  may  be  used
              together with another command.

       <b>--with-subkey-fingerprint</b>
              If  a  fingerprint  is printed for the primary key, this option forces printing of the fingerprint
              for all subkeys.  This could also be achieved by using the <b>--with-fingerprint</b> twice but  by  using
              this option along with keyid-format "none" a compact fingerprint is printed.

       <b>--with-v5-fingerprint</b>
              In  a colon mode listing emit "fp2" lines for version 4 OpenPGP keys having a v5 style fingerprint
              of the key.

       <b>--with-icao-spelling</b>
              Print the ICAO spelling of the fingerprint in addition to the hex digits.

       <b>--with-keygrip</b>
              Include the keygrip in the key listings.  In <b>--with-colons</b> mode  this  is  implicitly  enable  for
              secret keys.

       <b>--with-key-origin</b>
              Include  the locally held information on the origin and last update of a key in a key listing.  In
              <b>--with-colons</b> mode this is always printed.  This data is currently experimental and shall  not  be
              considered part of the stable API.

       <b>--with-wkd-hash</b>
              Print  a  Web  Key  Directory  identifier  along  with  each  user ID in key listings.  This is an
              experimental feature and semantics may change.

       <b>--with-secret</b>
              Include info about the presence of a secret key in public key listings done with <b>--with-colons</b>.

   <b>OpenPGP</b> <b>protocol</b> <b>specific</b> <b>options</b>

       <b>-t,</b> <b>--textmode</b>
       <b>--no-textmode</b>
              Treat input files as text and store them in the OpenPGP canonical text form with  standard  "CRLF"
              line  endings.  This  also  sets the necessary flags to inform the recipient that the encrypted or
              signed data is text and may need its line endings converted back  to  whatever  the  local  system
              uses.  This  option  is  useful  when communicating between two platforms that have different line
              ending conventions (UNIX-like to Mac, Mac to Windows, etc). <b>--no-textmode</b>  disables  this  option,
              and is the default.

       <b>--force-v3-sigs</b>
       <b>--no-force-v3-sigs</b>

       <b>--force-v4-certs</b>
       <b>--no-force-v4-certs</b>
              These options are obsolete and have no effect since GnuPG 2.1.

       <b>--force-ocb</b>
       <b>--force-aead</b>
              Force  the  use  of  AEAD  encryption  over MDC encryption.  AEAD is a modern and faster way to do
              authenticated encryption than the old MDC method.  <b>--force-aead</b> is an alias and  deprecated.   See
              also option <b>--chunk-size</b>.

       <b>--force-mdc</b>
       <b>--disable-mdc</b>
              These  options  are  obsolete and have no effect since GnuPG 2.2.8.  The MDC is always used unless
              the keys indicate that an AEAD algorithm can be used in which case AEAD is used.  But note: If the
              creation of a legacy non-MDC message is exceptionally required, the option  <b>--rfc2440</b>  allows  for
              this.

       <b>--disable-signer-uid</b>
              By  default  the  user ID of the signing key is embedded in the data signature.  As of now this is
              only done if the signing key has been specified with <b>local-user</b> using  a  mail  address,  or  with
              <b>sender</b>.    This   information  can  be  helpful  for  verifier  to  locate  the  key;  see  option
              <b>--auto-key-retrieve</b>.

       <b>--include-key-block</b>
       <b>--no-include-key-block</b>
              This option is used to embed the actual signing key into a data signature.  The  embedded  key  is
              stripped  down  to  a  single  user  id  and  includes  only the signing subkey used to create the
              signature as well as as valid encryption subkeys.  All other info is removed from the key to  keep
              it  and  thus  the  signature  small.   This option is the OpenPGP counterpart to the <b>gpgsm</b> option
              <b>--include-certs</b> and allows the recipient of a signed message to  reply  encrypted  to  the  sender
              without  using  any  online directories to lookup the key.  The default is <b>--no-include-key-block</b>.
              See also the option <b>--auto-key-import</b>.

       <b>--personal-cipher-preferences</b> <u>string</u>
              Set the list of personal cipher preferences to <u>string</u>.   Use  <b>gpg</b>  <b>--version</b>  to  get  a  list  of
              available  algorithms,  and  use <b>none</b> to set no preference at all.  This allows the user to safely
              override the algorithm chosen by the recipient  key  preferences,  as  GPG  will  only  select  an
              algorithm  that  is  usable by all recipients.  The most highly ranked cipher in this list is also
              used for the <b>--symmetric</b> encryption command.

       <b>--personal-digest-preferences</b> <u>string</u>
              Set the list of personal digest preferences to <u>string</u>.   Use  <b>gpg</b>  <b>--version</b>  to  get  a  list  of
              available  algorithms,  and  use <b>none</b> to set no preference at all.  This allows the user to safely
              override the algorithm chosen by the recipient  key  preferences,  as  GPG  will  only  select  an
              algorithm  that is usable by all recipients.  The most highly ranked digest algorithm in this list
              is also used when signing without encryption (e.g. <b>--clear-sign</b> or <b>--sign</b>).

       <b>--personal-compress-preferences</b> <u>string</u>
              Set the list of personal compression preferences to <u>string</u>.  Use <b>gpg</b> <b>--version</b> to get  a  list  of
              available  algorithms,  and  use <b>none</b> to set no preference at all.  This allows the user to safely
              override the algorithm chosen by the recipient  key  preferences,  as  GPG  will  only  select  an
              algorithm  that is usable by all recipients.  The most highly ranked compression algorithm in this
              list is also used when there are no recipient keys to consider (e.g. <b>--symmetric</b>).

       <b>--s2k-cipher-algo</b> <u>name</u>
              Use  <u>name</u>  as  the  cipher   algorithm   for   symmetric   encryption   with   a   passphrase   if
              <b>--personal-cipher-preferences</b> and <b>--cipher-algo</b> are not given.  The default is AES-128.

       <b>--s2k-digest-algo</b> <u>name</u>
              Use  <u>name</u>  as  the  digest algorithm used to mangle the passphrases for symmetric encryption.  The
              default is SHA-1.

       <b>--s2k-mode</b> <u>n</u>
              Selects how passphrases for symmetric encryption are mangled. If <u>n</u> is 0 a plain passphrase  (which
              is  in  general  not  recommended) will be used, a 1 adds a salt (which should not be used) to the
              passphrase and a 3 (the default) iterates the whole process a number of times (see <b>--s2k-count</b>).

       <b>--s2k-count</b> <u>n</u>
              Specify how many times the passphrases mangling for symmetric encryption is repeated.  This  value
              may range between 1024 and 65011712 inclusive.  The default is inquired from gpg-agent.  Note that
              not  all  values  in  the 1024-65011712 range are legal and if an illegal value is selected, GnuPG
              will round up to the nearest legal value.  This option is only meaningful if <b>--s2k-mode</b> is set  to
              the default of 3.

   <b>Compliance</b> <b>options</b>

       These options control what GnuPG is compliant to. Only one of these options may be active at a time. Note
       that  the  default  setting of this is nearly always the correct one. See the INTEROPERABILITY WITH OTHER
       OPENPGP PROGRAMS section below before using one of these options.

       <b>--gnupg</b>
              Use standard GnuPG behavior. This is  essentially  OpenPGP  behavior  (see  <b>--openpgp</b>),  but  with
              extension  from  the  proposed  update  to OpenPGP and with some additional workarounds for common
              compatibility problems in different versions of PGP.  This is the default option,  so  it  is  not
              generally  needed,  but it may be useful to override a different compliance option in the gpg.conf
              file.

       <b>--openpgp</b>
              Reset all packet, cipher and digest options to  strict  OpenPGP  behavior.   This  option  implies
              <b>--allow-old-cipher-algos</b>.    Use   this  option  to  reset  all  previous  options  like  <b>--s2k-*</b>,
              <b>--cipher-algo</b>, <b>--digest-algo</b> and <b>--compress-algo</b> to OpenPGP compliant values. All PGP  workarounds
              are disabled.

       <b>--rfc4880</b>
              Reset  all  packet,  cipher  and  digest options to strict RFC-4880 behavior.  This option implies
              <b>--allow-old-cipher-algos</b>.  Note that this is currently the same thing as <b>--openpgp</b>.

       <b>--rfc4880bis</b>
              Reset all packet, cipher and digest options  to  strict  according  to  the  proposed  updates  of
              RFC-4880.

       <b>--rfc2440</b>
              Reset  all packet, cipher and digest options to strict RFC-2440 behavior.  Note that by using this
              option encryption packets are created in a legacy mode without MDC protection.  This is  dangerous
              and  should thus only be used for experiments.  This option implies <b>--allow-old-cipher-algos</b>.  See
              also option <b>--ignore-mdc-error</b>.

       <b>--pgp6</b> This option is obsolete; it is handled as an alias for <b>--pgp7</b>

       <b>--pgp7</b> Set up all options to be as PGP 7 compliant as possible. This  allowed  the  ciphers  IDEA,  3DES,
              CAST5,AES128,  AES192,  AES256,  and  TWOFISH.,  the  hashes  MD5,  SHA1  and  RIPEMD160,  and the
              compression algorithms none  and  ZIP.   This  option  implies  <b>--escape-from-lines</b>  and  disables
              <b>--throw-keyids</b>,

       <b>--pgp8</b> Set  up  all  options  to  be as PGP 8 compliant as possible. PGP 8 is a lot closer to the OpenPGP
              standard than previous versions of PGP, so  all  this  does  is  disable  <b>--throw-keyids</b>  and  set
              <b>--escape-from-lines</b>.   All  algorithms  are  allowed  except  for  the  SHA224, SHA384, and SHA512
              digests.

       <b>--compliance</b> <u>string</u>
              This option can be used instead of one of the options above.  Valid  values  for  <u>string</u>  are  the
              above  option  names  (without the double dash) and possibly others as shown when using "help" for
              <u>string</u>.

       <b>--min-rsa-length</b> <u>n</u>
              This option adjusts the compliance mode "de-vs" for stricter key size requirements.  For  example,
              a value of 3000 turns rsa2048 and dsa2048 keys into non-VS-NfD compliant keys.

       <b>--require-compliance</b>
              To check that data has been encrypted according to the rules of the current compliance mode, a gpg
              user needs to evaluate the status lines.  This is allows frontends to handle compliance check in a
              more  flexible way.  However, for scripted use the required evaluation of the status-line requires
              quite some effort; this option can be used instead to make sure that the gpg process exits with  a
              failure  if the compliance rules are not fulfilled.  Note that this option has currently an effect
              only in "de-vs" mode.

   <b>Doing</b> <b>things</b> <b>one</b> <b>usually</b> <b>doesn't</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b>

       <b>-n</b>
       <b>--dry-run</b>
              Don't make any changes (this is not completely implemented).

       <b>--list-only</b>
              Changes the behaviour of some commands. This is like <b>--dry-run</b> but different in  some  cases.  The
              semantic  of  this  option  may  be  extended  in  the  future. Currently it only skips the actual
              decryption pass and therefore enables a fast listing of the encryption keys.

       <b>-i</b>
       <b>--interactive</b>
              Prompt before overwriting any files.

       <b>--compatibility-flags</b> <u>flags</u>
              Set compatibility flags to work around problems due to non-compliant keys or data.  The <u>flags</u>  are
              given  as  a  comma  separated list of flag names and are OR-ed together.  The special flag "none"
              clears the list and allows one to start over with an empty list.  To get a list of available flags
              the sole word "help" can be used.

       <b>--debug-level</b> <u>level</u>
              Select the debug level for investigating problems. <u>level</u> may be a numeric value or by a keyword:

              <b>none</b>   No debugging at all.  A value of less than 1 may be used instead of the keyword.

              <b>basic</b>  Some basic debug messages.  A value between 1 and 2 may be used instead of the keyword.

              <b>advanced</b>
                     More verbose debug messages.  A value between 3 and 5 may be used instead of the keyword.

              <b>expert</b> Even more detailed messages.  A value between 6 and 8 may be used instead of the keyword.

              <b>guru</b>   All of the debug messages you can get. A value greater than 8 may be used  instead  of  the
                     keyword.  The creation of hash tracing files is only enabled if the keyword is used.

       How  these  messages  are mapped to the actual debugging flags is not specified and may change with newer
       releases of this program. They are however carefully selected to best aid in debugging.

       <b>--debug</b> <u>flags</u>
              Set debug flags.  All flags are or-ed and <u>flags</u> may be given in C syntax (e.g.  0x0042)  or  as  a
              comma  separated  list of flag names.  To get a list of all supported flags the single word "help"
              can be used. This option is only useful for debugging and the behavior  may  change  at  any  time
              without notice.

       <b>--debug-all</b>
              Set all useful debugging flags.

       <b>--debug-iolbf</b>
              Set stdout into line buffered mode.  This option is only honored when given on the command line.

       <b>--debug-set-iobuf-size</b> <u>n</u>
              Change  the buffer size of the IOBUFs to <u>n</u> kilobyte.  Using 0 prints the current size.  Note well:
              This is a maintainer only option and may thus be changed or removed at any time without notice.

       <b>--debug-allow-large-chunks</b>
              To facilitate software tests and experiments this option allows one to specify a limit of up to  4
              EiB (<b>--chunk-size</b> <b>62</b>).

       <b>--debug-ignore-expiration</b>
              This  option  tries  to  override  certain  key  expiration  dates.  It is only useful for certain
              regression tests.

       <b>--faked-system-time</b> <u>epoch</u>
              This option is only useful for testing; it sets the system time back or forth to  <u>epoch</u>  which  is
              the number of seconds elapsed since the year 1970.  Alternatively <u>epoch</u> may be given as a full ISO
              time string (e.g. "20070924T154812").

              If  you suffix <u>epoch</u> with an exclamation mark (!), the system time will appear to be frozen at the
              specified time.

       <b>--full-timestrings</b>
              Change the format of printed creation and expiration times from just the  date  to  the  date  and
              time.  This is in general not useful and the same information is anyway available in <b>--with-colons</b>
              mode.  These longer strings are also not well aligned with other printed data.

       <b>--enable-progress-filter</b>
              Enable  certain  PROGRESS  status  outputs.  This  option  allows  frontends to display a progress
              indicator while gpg is processing larger files.  There is a slight performance overhead using it.

       <b>--status-fd</b> <u>n</u>
              Write special status strings to the file descriptor <u>n</u>.  See the file DETAILS in the  documentation
              for a listing of them.

       <b>--status-file</b> <u>file</u>
              Same as <b>--status-fd</b>, except the status data is written to file <u>file</u>.

       <b>--logger-fd</b> <u>n</u>
              Write log output to file descriptor <u>n</u> and not to STDERR.

       <b>--log-file</b> <u>file</u>
       <b>--logger-file</b> <u>file</u>
              Same  as <b>--logger-fd</b>, except the logger data is written to file <u>file</u>.  Use ‘<u>socket://</u>’ to log to s
              socket.

       <b>--log-time</b>
              Prefix all log output with a timestamp even if no log file is used.

       <b>--attribute-fd</b> <u>n</u>
              Write attribute subpackets to the file descriptor <u>n</u>. This is most useful for use with <b>--status-fd</b>,
              since the status messages are needed to separate  out  the  various  subpackets  from  the  stream
              delivered to the file descriptor.

       <b>--attribute-file</b> <u>file</u>
              Same as <b>--attribute-fd</b>, except the attribute data is written to file <u>file</u>.

       <b>--comment</b> <u>string</u>
       <b>--no-comments</b>
              Use  <u>string</u>  as  a  comment string in cleartext signatures and ASCII armored messages or keys (see
              <b>--armor</b>). The default behavior is not to use a comment string. <b>--comment</b> may be repeated  multiple
              times  to  get multiple comment strings. <b>--no-comments</b> removes all comments.  It is a good idea to
              keep the length of a single comment below 60 characters  to  avoid  problems  with  mail  programs
              wrapping  such  lines.  Note that comment lines, like all other header lines, are not protected by
              the signature.

       <b>--emit-version</b>
       <b>--no-emit-version</b>
              Force inclusion of the version string in ASCII armored output.  If given once only the name of the
              program and the major number is emitted, given twice the minor is also emitted, given  thrice  the
              micro  is  added,  and  given  four  times  an  operating  system  identification is also emitted.
              <b>--no-emit-version</b> (default) disables the version line.

       <b>--sig-notation</b> <b>{</b><u>name</u><b>=</b><u>value</u><b>}</b>
       <b>--cert-notation</b> <b>{</b><u>name</u><b>=</b><u>value</u><b>}</b>
       <b>-N,</b> <b>--set-notation</b> <b>{</b><u>name</u><b>=</b><u>value</u><b>}</b>
              Put the name value pair into the signature as notation data.  <u>name</u> must consist only of  printable
              characters  or  spaces,  and  must  contain a '@' character in the form <a href="mailto:keyname@domain.example.com">keyname@domain.example.com</a>
              (substituting the appropriate keyname and domain name,  of  course).   This  is  to  help  prevent
              pollution  of  the  IETF  reserved  notation namespace. The <b>--expert</b> flag overrides the '@' check.
              <u>value</u> may be any printable string; it will be encoded in UTF-8, so  you  should  check  that  your
              <b>--display-charset</b>  is set correctly. If you prefix <u>name</u> with an exclamation mark (!), the notation
              data will be flagged as critical (rfc4880:5.2.3.16).  <b>--sig-notation</b>  sets  a  notation  for  data
              signatures.  <b>--cert-notation</b>  sets  a notation for key signatures (certifications). <b>--set-notation</b>
              sets both.

              There are special codes that may be used in notation names. "%k" will be expanded into the key  ID
              of  the  key  being  signed,  "%K"  into  the  long  key ID of the key being signed, "%f" into the
              fingerprint of the key being signed, "%s" into the key ID of the key making  the  signature,  "%S"
              into  the long key ID of the key making the signature, "%g" into the fingerprint of the key making
              the signature (which might be a subkey), "%p" into the fingerprint of the primary key of  the  key
              making  the  signature, "%c" into the signature count from the OpenPGP smartcard, and "%%" results
              in a single "%". %k, %K, and %f are only meaningful when making a key  signature  (certification),
              and %c is only meaningful when using the OpenPGP smartcard.

       <b>--known-notation</b> <u>name</u>
              Adds  <u>name</u>  to  a list of known critical signature notations.  The effect of this is that gpg will
              not mark a signature with a critical signature notation of  that  name  as  bad.   Note  that  gpg
              already knows by default about a few critical signatures notation names.

       <b>--sig-policy-url</b> <u>string</u>
       <b>--cert-policy-url</b> <u>string</u>
       <b>--set-policy-url</b> <u>string</u>
              Use  <u>string</u>  as  a  Policy  URL  for  signatures  (rfc4880:5.2.3.20).   If  you  prefix it with an
              exclamation mark (!), the policy URL packet will be flagged as critical. <b>--sig-policy-url</b>  sets  a
              policy  url  for  data  signatures.  <b>--cert-policy-url</b>  sets  a  policy  url  for  key  signatures
              (certifications). <b>--set-policy-url</b> sets both.

              The same %-expandos used for notation data are available here as well.

       <b>--sig-keyserver-url</b> <u>string</u>
              Use <u>string</u> as a preferred keyserver URL for data signatures. If you prefix it with an  exclamation
              mark (!), the keyserver URL packet will be flagged as critical.

              The same %-expandos used for notation data are available here as well.

       <b>--set-filename</b> <u>string</u>
              Use  <u>string</u> as the filename which is stored inside messages.  This overrides the default, which is
              to use the actual filename of the file  being  encrypted.   Using  the  empty  string  for  <u>string</u>
              effectively removes the filename from the output.

       <b>--for-your-eyes-only</b>
       <b>--no-for-your-eyes-only</b>
              Set  the  `for  your  eyes only' flag in the message. This causes GnuPG to refuse to save the file
              unless the <b>--output</b> option is given, and PGP to use a "secure  viewer"  with  a  claimed  Tempest-
              resistant    font    to    display    the   message.   This   option   overrides   <b>--set-filename</b>.
              <b>--no-for-your-eyes-only</b> disables this option.

       <b>--use-embedded-filename</b>
       <b>--no-use-embedded-filename</b>
              Try to create a file with a name as embedded in the data. This can be a  dangerous  option  as  it
              enables overwriting files.  Defaults to no.  Note that the option <b>--output</b> overrides this option.

       <b>--cipher-algo</b> <u>name</u>
              Use  <u>name</u>  as  cipher  algorithm.  Running the program with the command <b>--version</b> yields a list of
              supported algorithms. If this is not used the cipher algorithm is selected  from  the  preferences
              stored  with  the  key. In general, you do not want to use this option as it allows you to violate
              the OpenPGP standard.  The option <b>--personal-cipher-preferences</b> is the safe way to accomplish  the
              same thing.

       <b>--digest-algo</b> <u>name</u>
              Use  <u>name</u> as the message digest algorithm. Running the program with the command <b>--version</b> yields a
              list of supported algorithms. In general, you do not want to use this option as it allows  you  to
              violate  the  OpenPGP  standard.   The  option  <b>--personal-digest-preferences</b>  is  the safe way to
              accomplish the same thing.

       <b>--compress-algo</b> <u>name</u>
              Use compression algorithm <u>name</u>. "zlib"  is  RFC-1950  ZLIB  compression.  "zip"  is  RFC-1951  ZIP
              compression  which  is used by PGP.  "bzip2" is a more modern compression scheme that can compress
              some things better than zip or zlib, but at the cost of more memory used  during  compression  and
              decompression.  "uncompressed"  or  "none"  disables  compression. If this option is not used, the
              default behavior is to examine the recipient key preferences to see which algorithms the recipient
              supports. If all else fails, ZIP is used for maximum compatibility.

              ZLIB may give better compression results than ZIP, as the compression window size is  not  limited
              to  8k.  BZIP2  may  give  even better compression results than that, but will use a significantly
              larger amount of memory while compressing and decompressing. This may be significant in low memory
              situations. Note, however, that PGP (all  versions)  only  supports  ZIP  compression.  Using  any
              algorithm  other  than ZIP or "none" will make the message unreadable with PGP. In general, you do
              not want to use this option as it  allows  you  to  violate  the  OpenPGP  standard.   The  option
              <b>--personal-compress-preferences</b> is the safe way to accomplish the same thing.

       <b>--cert-digest-algo</b> <u>name</u>
              Use  <u>name</u>  as  the  message digest algorithm used when signing a key. Running the program with the
              command <b>--version</b> yields a list of supported algorithms.  Be aware that if you choose an algorithm
              that GnuPG supports but other OpenPGP implementations do not, then some users will not be able  to
              use  the  key signatures you make, or quite possibly your entire key.  Note also that a public key
              algorithm must be compatible with the specified digest  algorithm;  thus  selecting  an  arbitrary
              digest algorithm may result in error messages from lower crypto layers or lead to security flaws.

       <b>--disable-cipher-algo</b> <u>name</u>
              Never  allow  the  use  of <u>name</u> as cipher algorithm.  The given name will not be checked so that a
              later loaded algorithm will still get disabled.

       <b>--disable-pubkey-algo</b> <u>name</u>
              Never allow the use of <u>name</u> as public key algorithm.  The given name will not be checked so that a
              later loaded algorithm will still get disabled.

       <b>--throw-keyids</b>
       <b>--no-throw-keyids</b>
              Do not put the recipient key IDs into encrypted messages. This helps to hide the receivers of  the
              message  and  is  a  limited  countermeasure  against  traffic  analysis.  ([Using a little social
              engineering anyone who is able to  decrypt  the  message  can  check  whether  one  of  the  other
              recipients  is  the  one  he  suspects.])   On the receiving side, it may slow down the decryption
              process because all available secret keys must be tried.  <b>--no-throw-keyids</b> disables this  option.
              This option is essentially the same as using <b>--hidden-recipient</b> for all recipients.

       <b>--not-dash-escaped</b>
              This option changes the behavior of cleartext signatures so that they can be used for patch files.
              You  should not send such an armored file via email because all spaces and line endings are hashed
              too. You can not use this option for data which has 5 dashes at the beginning  of  a  line,  patch
              files  don't  have  this.  A  special armor header line tells GnuPG about this cleartext signature
              option.

       <b>--escape-from-lines</b>
       <b>--no-escape-from-lines</b>
              Because some mailers change lines starting with "From " to "&gt;From " it  is  good  to  handle  such
              lines in a special way when creating cleartext signatures to prevent the mail system from breaking
              the  signature.  Note  that  all  other  PGP  versions  do  it  this way too.  Enabled by default.
              <b>--no-escape-from-lines</b> disables this option.

       <b>--passphrase-repeat</b> <u>n</u>
              Specify how many times <b>gpg</b> will request a new passphrase be repeated.  This is useful for  helping
              memorize  a  passphrase.   Defaults  to  1  repetition;  can be set to 0 to disable any passphrase
              repetition.  Note that a <u>n</u> greater than 1 will pop up the pinentry window  <u>n</u>+1  times  even  if  a
              modern pinentry with two entry fields is used.

       <b>--passphrase-fd</b> <u>n</u>
              Read  the passphrase from file descriptor <u>n</u>. Only the first line will be read from file descriptor
              <u>n</u>. If you use 0 for <u>n</u>, the passphrase will be read from STDIN. This can only be used if  only  one
              passphrase is supplied.

              Note  that  since  Version  2.0  this  passphrase is only used if the option <b>--batch</b> has also been
              given. Since Version 2.1 the <b>--pinentry-mode</b> also needs to be set to <b>loopback</b>.

       <b>--passphrase-file</b> <u>file</u>
              Read the passphrase from file <u>file</u>. Only the first line will be read from file <u>file</u>. This can only
              be used if only one passphrase is supplied. Obviously,  a  passphrase  stored  in  a  file  is  of
              questionable  security  if  other users can read this file. Don't use this option if you can avoid
              it.

              Note that since Version 2.0 this passphrase is only used if  the  option  <b>--batch</b>  has  also  been
              given. Since Version 2.1 the <b>--pinentry-mode</b> also needs to be set to <b>loopback</b>.

       <b>--passphrase</b> <u>string</u>
              Use <u>string</u> as the passphrase. This can only be used if only one passphrase is supplied. Obviously,
              this  is  of  very  questionable security on a multi-user system. Don't use this option if you can
              avoid it.

              Note that since Version 2.0 this passphrase is only used if  the  option  <b>--batch</b>  has  also  been
              given. Since Version 2.1 the <b>--pinentry-mode</b> also needs to be set to <b>loopback</b>.

       <b>--pinentry-mode</b> <u>mode</u>
              Set the pinentry mode to <u>mode</u>.  Allowed values for <u>mode</u> are:

              <b>default</b>
                     Use the default of the agent, which is <b>ask</b>.

              <b>ask</b>    Force the use of the Pinentry.

              <b>cancel</b> Emulate use of Pinentry's cancel button.

              <b>error</b>  Return a Pinentry error (``No Pinentry'').

              <b>loopback</b>
                     Redirect Pinentry queries to the caller.  Note that in contrast to Pinentry the user is not
                     prompted again if he enters a bad password.

       <b>--no-symkey-cache</b>
              Disable  the passphrase cache used for symmetrical en- and decryption.  This cache is based on the
              message specific salt value (cf. <b>--s2k-mode</b>).

       <b>--request-origin</b> <u>origin</u>
              Tell gpg to assume that the operation ultimately originated at <u>origin</u>.  Depending  on  the  origin
              certain  restrictions  are  applied  and  the  Pinentry  may  include an extra note on the origin.
              Supported values for <u>origin</u> are: <b>local</b> which is the default, <b>remote</b> to indicate a remote origin or
              <b>browser</b> for an operation requested by a web browser.

       <b>--command-fd</b> <u>n</u>
              This is a replacement for the deprecated shared-memory IPC mode.  If this option is enabled,  user
              input  on  questions is not expected from the TTY but from the given file descriptor. It should be
              used together with <b>--status-fd</b>. See the file doc/DETAILS in the source distribution for details on
              how to use it.

       <b>--command-file</b> <u>file</u>
              Same as <b>--command-fd</b>, except the commands are read out of file <u>file</u>

       <b>--allow-non-selfsigned-uid</b>
       <b>--no-allow-non-selfsigned-uid</b>
              Allow the import and use of keys with user IDs which are not self-signed. This is not recommended,
              as a non self-signed user ID is trivial to forge. <b>--no-allow-non-selfsigned-uid</b> disables.

       <b>--allow-freeform-uid</b>
              Disable all checks on the form of the user ID while generating a new one. This option should  only
              be  used  in  very special environments as it does not ensure the de-facto standard format of user
              IDs.

       <b>--ignore-time-conflict</b>
              GnuPG normally checks that the timestamps associated  with  keys  and  signatures  have  plausible
              values.  However, sometimes a signature seems to be older than the key due to clock problems. This
              option makes these checks just a warning. See also <b>--ignore-valid-from</b>  for  timestamp  issues  on
              subkeys.

       <b>--ignore-valid-from</b>
              GnuPG  normally does not select and use subkeys created in the future.  This option allows the use
              of such keys and thus exhibits the pre-1.0.7 behaviour. You should  not  use  this  option  unless
              there is some clock problem. See also <b>--ignore-time-conflict</b> for timestamp issues with signatures.

       <b>--ignore-crc-error</b>
              The  ASCII  armor  used  by  OpenPGP  is  protected by a CRC checksum against transmission errors.
              Occasionally the CRC gets mangled somewhere on the transmission channel  but  the  actual  content
              (which  is  protected  by  the OpenPGP protocol anyway) is still okay. This option allows GnuPG to
              ignore CRC errors.

       <b>--ignore-mdc-error</b>
              This option changes a MDC integrity protection failure into a warning.  It is required to  decrypt
              old  messages  which did not use an MDC.  It may also be useful if a message is partially garbled,
              but it is necessary to get as much data as possible out of that garbled message.  Be aware that  a
              missing  or failed MDC can be an indication of an attack.  Use with great caution; see also option
              <b>--rfc2440</b>.

       <b>--allow-old-cipher-algos</b>
              Old cipher algorithms like 3DES, IDEA, or CAST5 encrypt data  using  blocks  of  64  bits;  modern
              algorithms  use  blocks of 128 bit instead.  To avoid certain attack on these old algorithms it is
              suggested not to encrypt more than 150 MiByte using the same key.  For this reason  gpg  does  not
              allow the use of 64 bit block size algorithms for encryption unless this option is specified.

       <b>--allow-weak-digest-algos</b>
              Signatures  made  with known-weak digest algorithms are normally rejected with an ``invalid digest
              algorithm'' message.  This option allows the  verification  of  signatures  made  with  such  weak
              algorithms.   MD5 is the only digest algorithm considered weak by default.  See also <b>--weak-digest</b>
              to reject other digest algorithms.

       <b>--weak-digest</b> <u>name</u>
              Treat the specified digest algorithm as weak.  Signatures made over weak  digests  algorithms  are
              normally  rejected.  This  option  can be supplied multiple times if multiple algorithms should be
              considered weak.  See also <b>--allow-weak-digest-algos</b> to disable rejection of weak digests.  MD5 is
              always considered weak, and does not need to be listed explicitly.

       <b>--allow-weak-key-signatures</b>
              To avoid a minor risk of collision attacks on third-party key signatures made using  SHA-1,  those
              key signatures are considered invalid.  This options allows one to override this restriction.

       <b>--override-compliance-check</b>
              This was a temporary introduced option and has no more effect.

       <b>--no-default-keyring</b>
              Do  not  add  the  default  keyring  to the list of keyrings. Note that GnuPG needs for almost all
              operations a keyring. Thus if you use this option  and  do  not  provide  alternate  keyrings  via
              <b>--keyring</b>, then GnuPG will still use the default keyring.

              Note  that  if the option <b>use-keyboxd</b> is enabled in ‘<u>common.conf</u>’, no keyrings are used at all and
              keys are all maintained by the keyboxd process in its own database.

       <b>--no-keyring</b>
              Do not use any keyring at all.  This overrides the default and all options which specify keyrings.

       <b>--skip-verify</b>
              Skip the signature verification step. This may be used  to  make  the  decryption  faster  if  the
              signature verification is not needed.

       <b>--with-key-data</b>
              Print key listings delimited by colons (like <b>--with-colons</b>) and print the public key data.

       <b>--list-signatures</b>
       <b>--list-sigs</b>
              Same as <b>--list-keys</b>, but the signatures are listed too.  This command has the same effect as using
              <b>--list-keys</b>  with <b>--with-sig-list</b>.  Note that in contrast to <b>--check-signatures</b> the key signatures
              are not verified.  This command can be used to create a list of signing keys missing in the  local
              keyring; for example:

               gpg --list-sigs --with-colons USERID | \
                 awk -F: '$1=="sig" &amp;&amp; $2=="?" {if($13){print $13}else{print $5}}'

       <b>--fast-list-mode</b>
              Changes  the  output  of  the list commands to work faster; this is achieved by leaving some parts
              empty. Some applications don't need the user ID and the trust information given in  the  listings.
              By using this options they can get a faster listing. The exact behaviour of this option may change
              in future versions.  If you are missing some information, don't use this option.

       <b>--no-literal</b>
              This is not for normal use. Use the source to see for what it might be useful.

       <b>--set-filesize</b>
              This is not for normal use. Use the source to see for what it might be useful.

       <b>--show-session-key</b>
              Display  the  session  key used for one message. See <b>--override-session-key</b> for the counterpart of
              this option.

              We think that Key Escrow is a Bad Thing; however the  user  should  have  the  freedom  to  decide
              whether  to go to prison or to reveal the content of one specific message without compromising all
              messages ever encrypted for one secret key.

              You can also use this option if you receive an encrypted message which is abusive or offensive, to
              prove to the administrators of the messaging system that the ciphertext transmitted corresponds to
              an inappropriate plaintext so they can take action against the offending user.

       <b>--override-session-key</b> <u>string</u>
       <b>--override-session-key-fd</b> <u>fd</u>
              Don't use the public key but the session key <u>string</u> respective the  session  key  taken  from  the
              first line read from file descriptor <u>fd</u>.  The format of this string is the same as the one printed
              by <b>--show-session-key</b>. This option is normally not used but comes handy in case someone forces you
              to  reveal  the content of an encrypted message; using this option you can do this without handing
              out the secret key.  Note that using <b>--override-session-key</b> may reveal  the  session  key  to  all
              local  users  via  the  global  process  table.   Often  it  is useful to combine this option with
              <b>--no-keyring</b>.

       <b>--ask-sig-expire</b>
       <b>--no-ask-sig-expire</b>
              When making a data signature, prompt for an expiration time. If this option is not specified,  the
              expiration time set via <b>--default-sig-expire</b> is used. <b>--no-ask-sig-expire</b> disables this option.

       <b>--default-sig-expire</b>
              The  default  expiration  time  to  use  for  signature  expiration.  Valid  values are "0" for no
              expiration, a number followed by the letter d (for days), w (for weeks), m (for months), or y (for
              years) (for example "2m" for two months, or "5y" for five years), or an absolute date in the  form
              YYYY-MM-DD. Defaults to "0".

       <b>--ask-cert-expire</b>
       <b>--no-ask-cert-expire</b>
              When  making  a key signature, prompt for an expiration time. If this option is not specified, the
              expiration time set via <b>--default-cert-expire</b> is used. <b>--no-ask-cert-expire</b> disables this option.

       <b>--default-cert-expire</b>
              The default expiration time to use for key signature expiration.  Valid  values  are  "0"  for  no
              expiration, a number followed by the letter d (for days), w (for weeks), m (for months), or y (for
              years)  (for example "2m" for two months, or "5y" for five years), or an absolute date in the form
              YYYY-MM-DD. Defaults to "0".

       <b>--default-new-key-algo</b> <u>string</u>
              This option can be used to change the default algorithms for key generation. The <u>string</u> is similar
              to the arguments required for the command <b>--quick-add-key</b> but slightly different.  For example the
              current default of <b>"rsa2048/cert,sign+rsa2048/encr"</b> (or <b>"rsa3072"</b>) can be changed to the value  of
              what  we  currently  call  future default, which is <b>"ed25519/cert,sign+cv25519/encr"</b>.  You need to
              consult the source code to learn the details.  Note that the advanced key generation commands  can
              always be used to specify a key algorithm directly.

       <b>--no-auto-trust-new-key</b>
              When  creating  a  new key the ownertrust of the new key is set to ultimate.  This option disables
              this and the user needs to manually assign an ownertrust value.

       <b>--force-sign-key</b>
              This option modifies the behaviour of the commands <b>--quick-sign-key</b>,  <b>--quick-lsign-key</b>,  and  the
              "sign"  sub-commands of <b>--edit-key</b> by forcing the creation of a key signature, even if one already
              exists.

       <b>--forbid-gen-key</b>
              This option is intended for use in the global config file to disallow  the  use  of  generate  key
              commands.  Those commands will then fail with the error code for Not Enabled.

       <b>--allow-secret-key-import</b>
              This is an obsolete option and is not used anywhere.

       <b>--allow-multiple-messages</b>

       <b>--no-allow-multiple-messages</b>
              These are obsolete options; they have no more effect since GnuPG 2.2.8.

       <b>--enable-special-filenames</b>
              This option enables a mode in which filenames of the form ‘<u>-&amp;n</u>’, where n is a non-negative decimal
              number, refer to the file descriptor n and not to a file with that name.

       <b>--no-expensive-trust-checks</b>
              Experimental use only.

       <b>--preserve-permissions</b>
              Don't  change  the  permissions  of a secret keyring back to user read/write only. Use this option
              only if you really know what you are doing.

       <b>--default-preference-list</b> <u>string</u>
              Set the list of default preferences to <u>string</u>. This preference list  is  used  for  new  keys  and
              becomes the default for "setpref" in the <b>--edit-key</b> menu.

       <b>--default-keyserver-url</b> <u>name</u>
              Set  the  default  keyserver  URL  to  <u>name</u>. This keyserver will be used as the keyserver URL when
              writing a new self-signature on a key, which includes key generation and changing preferences.

       <b>--list-config</b>
              Display various internal configuration parameters of GnuPG. This option is intended  for  external
              programs  that  call  GnuPG  to  perform  tasks,  and  is  thus not generally useful. See the file
              ‘<u>doc/DETAILS</u>’ in the source distribution for the details  of  which  configuration  items  may  be
              listed. <b>--list-config</b> is only usable with <b>--with-colons</b> set.

       <b>--list-gcrypt-config</b>
              Display various internal configuration parameters of Libgcrypt.

       <b>--gpgconf-list</b>
              This command is similar to <b>--list-config</b> but in general only internally used by the <b>gpgconf</b> tool.

       <b>--gpgconf-test</b>
              This  is  more  or  less  dummy action.  However it parses the configuration file and returns with
              failure if the configuration file would prevent <b>gpg</b> from startup.  Thus it may be used  to  run  a
              syntax check on the configuration file.

       <b>--chuid</b> <u>uid</u>
              Change  the current user to <u>uid</u> which may either be a number or a name.  This can be used from the
              root account to run gpg for another user.  If <u>uid</u> is not the current UID a standard  PATH  is  set
              and the envvar GNUPGHOME is unset.  To override the latter the option <b>--homedir</b> can be used.  This
              option  has  only an effect when used on the command line.  This option has currently no effect at
              all on Windows.

   <b>Deprecated</b> <b>options</b>

       <b>--show-photos</b>
       <b>--no-show-photos</b>
              Causes <b>--list-keys</b>, <b>--list-signatures</b>, <b>--list-public-keys</b>,  <b>--list-secret-keys</b>,  and  verifying  a
              signature to also display the photo ID attached to the key, if any. See also <b>--photo-viewer</b>. These
              options    are   deprecated.   Use   <b>--list-options</b>   <b>[no-]show-photos</b>   and/or   <b>--verify-options</b>
              <b>[no-]show-photos</b> instead.

       <b>--show-keyring</b>
              Display the keyring name at the head of key listings to show which keyring a given key resides on.
              This option is deprecated: use <b>--list-options</b> <b>[no-]show-keyring</b> instead.

       <b>--show-notation</b>
       <b>--no-show-notation</b>
              Show signature notations in the <b>--list-signatures</b> or <b>--check-signatures</b> listings as well  as  when
              verifying  a  signature  with  a  notation in it. These options are deprecated. Use <b>--list-options</b>

       <b>--show-policy-url</b>
       <b>--no-show-policy-url</b>
              Show policy URLs in the <b>--list-signatures</b> or <b>--check-signatures</b> listings as well as when verifying
              a  signature  with  a  policy  URL  in  it.  These  options  are  deprecated.  Use  <b>--list-options</b>
              <b>[no-]show-policy-url</b> and/or <b>--verify-options</b> <b>[no-]show-policy-url</b> instead.

       <b>--personal-aead-preferences</b> <u>string</u>

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>gpg</b> <b>-se</b> <b>-r</b> <b>Bob</b> <b>file</b>
              sign and encrypt for user Bob

       <b>gpg</b> <b>--clear-sign</b> <b>file</b>
              make a cleartext signature

       <b>gpg</b> <b>-sb</b> <b>file</b>
              make a detached signature

       <b>gpg</b> <b>-u</b> <b>0x12345678</b> <b>-sb</b> <b>file</b>
              make a detached signature with the key 0x12345678

       <b>gpg</b> <b>--list-keys</b> <b>user_ID</b>
              show keys

       <b>gpg</b> <b>--fingerprint</b> <b>user_ID</b>
              show fingerprint

       <b>gpg</b> <b>--verify</b> <b>pgpfile</b>
       <b>gpg</b> <b>--verify</b> <b>sigfile</b> <b>[datafile]</b>
              Verify  the signature of the file but do not output the data unless requested.  The second form is
              used for detached signatures, where <b>sigfile</b> is the detached signature  (either  ASCII  armored  or
              binary)  and  <b>datafile</b> are the signed data; if this is not given, the name of the file holding the
              signed data is constructed by cutting off the extension (".asc" or ".sig") of <b>sigfile</b> or by asking
              the user for the filename.  If the option <b>--output</b> is also used the signed data is written to  the
              file specified by that option; use <b>-</b> to write the signed data to stdout.

</pre><h4><b>HOW</b> <b>TO</b> <b>SPECIFY</b> <b>A</b> <b>USER</b> <b>ID</b></h4><pre>
       There  are  different ways to specify a user ID to GnuPG.  Some of them are only valid for <b>gpg</b> others are
       only good for <b>gpgsm</b>.  Here is the entire list of ways to specify a key:

       <b>By</b> <b>key</b> <b>Id.</b>
              This format is deduced from the length of the string and its content or <b>0x</b> prefix. The key  Id  of
              an  X.509  certificate are the low 64 bits of its SHA-1 fingerprint.  The use of key Ids is just a
              shortcut, for all automated processing the fingerprint should be used.

              When using <b>gpg</b> an exclamation mark (!) may be appended to force using  the  specified  primary  or
              secondary key and not to try and calculate which primary or secondary key to use.

              The  last  four  lines of the example give the key ID in their long form as internally used by the
              OpenPGP protocol. You can see the long key ID using the option <b>--with-colons</b>.

         234567C4
         0F34E556E
         01347A56A
         0xAB123456

         234AABBCC34567C4
         0F323456784E56EAB
         01AB3FED1347A5612
         0x234AABBCC34567C4

       <b>By</b> <b>fingerprint.</b>
              This format is deduced from the length of the string and its content or the <b>0x</b> prefix.  Note, that
              only the 20 byte version fingerprint  is  available  with  <b>gpgsm</b>  (i.e.  the  SHA-1  hash  of  the
              certificate).

              When  using  <b>gpg</b>  an  exclamation mark (!) may be appended to force using the specified primary or
              secondary key and not to try and calculate which primary or secondary key to use.

              The best way to specify a key Id is by using the fingerprint.  This avoids any ambiguities in case
              that there are duplicated key IDs.

         1234343434343434C434343434343434
         123434343434343C3434343434343734349A3434
         0E12343434343434343434EAB3484343434343434
         0xE12343434343434343434EAB3484343434343434

       <b>gpgsm</b> also accepts colons between each pair of hexadecimal digits because this is the  de-facto  standard
       on  how  to present X.509 fingerprints.  <b>gpg</b> also allows the use of the space separated SHA-1 fingerprint
       as printed by the key listing commands.

       <b>By</b> <b>exact</b> <b>match</b> <b>on</b> <b>OpenPGP</b> <b>user</b> <b>ID.</b>
              This is denoted by a leading equal sign. It does not make sense for X.509 certificates.

       <b>By</b> <b>exact</b> <b>match</b> <b>on</b> <b>an</b> <b>email</b> <b>address.</b>
              This is indicated by enclosing the email address in the usual way with left and right angles.

       <b>By</b> <b>partial</b> <b>match</b> <b>on</b> <b>an</b> <b>email</b> <b>address.</b>
              This is indicated by prefixing the search string with an <b>@</b>.  This  uses  a  substring  search  but
              considers only the mail address (i.e. inside the angle brackets).

       <b>By</b> <b>exact</b> <b>match</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject's</b> <b>DN.</b>
              This is indicated by a leading slash, directly followed by the RFC-2253 encoded DN of the subject.
              Note  that  you  can't  use  the  string  printed  by  <b>gpgsm</b> <b>--list-keys</b> because that one has been
              reordered and modified for better readability; use <b>--with-colons</b> to print the  raw  (but  standard
              escaped) RFC-2253 string.

       <b>By</b> <b>exact</b> <b>match</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>issuer's</b> <b>DN.</b>
              This  is indicated by a leading hash mark, directly followed by a slash and then directly followed
              by the RFC-2253 encoded DN of the issuer.  This should return the Root cert of  the  issuer.   See
              note above.

       <b>By</b> <b>exact</b> <b>match</b> <b>on</b> <b>serial</b> <b>number</b> <b>and</b> <b>issuer's</b> <b>DN.</b>
              This is indicated by a hash mark, followed by the hexadecimal representation of the serial number,
              then followed by a slash and the RFC-2253 encoded DN of the issuer. See note above.

         #4F03/CN=Root Cert,O=Poets,L=Paris,C=FR

       <b>By</b> <b>keygrip.</b>
              This  is  indicated  by an ampersand followed by the 40 hex digits of a keygrip.  <b>gpgsm</b> prints the

       <b>By</b> <b>substring</b> <b>match.</b>
              This is the default mode but applications may want to explicitly  indicate  this  by  putting  the
              asterisk in front.  Match is not case sensitive.

       <b>.</b> <b>and</b> <b>+</b> <b>prefixes</b>
              These  prefixes  are reserved for looking up mails anchored at the end and for a word search mode.
              They are not yet implemented and using them is undefined.

              Please note that we have reused the hash mark identifier which was used in old GnuPG  versions  to
              indicate the so called local-id.  It is not anymore used and there should be no conflict when used
              with X.509 stuff.

              Using  the RFC-2253 format of DNs has the drawback that it is not possible to map them back to the
              original encoding, however we don't have to do this because our key database stores this  encoding
              as meta data.

</pre><h4><b>FILTER</b> <b>EXPRESSIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The  options  <b>--import-filter</b>  and  <b>--export-filter</b>  use  expressions  with  this syntax (square brackets
       indicate an optional part and curly braces a repetition, white space between the elements are allowed):

                  [lc] {[{flag}] PROPNAME op VALUE [lc]}

       The name of a property (<u>PROPNAME</u>) may only consist of letters, digits and underscores.   The  description
       for  the  filter  type  describes  which  properties  are  defined.   If an undefined property is used it
       evaluates to the empty string.  Unless otherwise noted, the <u>VALUE</u> must always be given and may not be the
       empty string.  No quoting is defined for the value, thus the value may not contain the strings <b>&amp;&amp;</b> or  <b>||</b>,
       which are used as logical connection operators.  The flag <b>--</b> can be used to remove this restriction.

       Numerical  values  are  computed  as long int; standard C notation applies.  <u>lc</u> is the logical connection
       operator; either <b>&amp;&amp;</b> for a conjunction or <b>||</b> for a disjunction.  A conjunction is assumed at the begin  of
       an  expression.   Conjunctions have higher precedence than disjunctions.  If <u>VALUE</u> starts with one of the
       characters used in any <u>op</u> a space after the <u>op</u> is required.

       The supported operators (<u>op</u>) are:

       <b>=~</b>     Substring must match.

       <b>!~</b>     Substring must not match.

       <b>=</b>      The full string must match.

       <b>&lt;&gt;</b>     The full string must not match.

       <b>==</b>     The numerical value must match.

       <b>!=</b>     The numerical value must not match.

       <b>&lt;=</b>     The numerical value of the field must be LE than the value.

       <b>&lt;</b>      The numerical value of the field must be LT than the value.

       <b>&gt;</b>      The numerical value of the field must be GT than the value.

       <b>&gt;=</b>     The numerical value of the field must be GE than the value.

       <b>-le</b>    The string value of the field must be less or equal than the value.

       <b>-lt</b>    The string value of the field must be less than the value.

       <b>-gt</b>    The string value of the field must be greater than the value.

       <b>-ge</b>    The string value of the field must be greater or equal than the value.

       <b>-n</b>     True if value is not empty (no value allowed).

       <b>-z</b>     True if value is empty (no value allowed).

       <b>-t</b>     Alias for "PROPNAME != 0" (no value allowed).

       <b>-f</b>     Alias for "PROPNAME == 0" (no value allowed).

       Values for <u>flag</u> must be space separated.  The supported flags are:

       <b>--</b>     <u>VALUE</u> spans to the end of the expression.

       <b>-c</b>     The string match in this part is done case-sensitive.

       <b>-t</b>     Leading and trailing spaces are not removed from <u>VALUE</u>.  The optional single  space  after  <u>op</u>  is
              here required.

       The  filter  options  concatenate  several specifications for a filter of the same type.  For example the
       four options in this example:

                 --import-filter keep-uid="uid =~ Alfa"
                 --import-filter keep-uid="&amp;&amp; uid !~ Test"
                 --import-filter keep-uid="|| uid =~ Alpha"
                 --import-filter keep-uid="uid !~ Test"

       which is equivalent to

                 --import-filter \
                  keep-uid="uid =~ Alfa" &amp;&amp; uid !~ Test" || uid =~ Alpha" &amp;&amp; "uid !~ Test"

       imports only the user ids of a key containing the strings "Alfa" or "Alpha" but not the string "test".

</pre><h4><b>TRUST</b> <b>VALUES</b></h4><pre>
       Trust values are used to indicate ownertrust and validity of keys and user IDs.  They are displayed  with
       letters or strings:

       <b>-</b>
       <b>unknown</b>
              No ownertrust assigned / not yet calculated.

       <b>e</b>
       <b>expired</b>

              Trust calculation has failed; probably due to an expired key.

       <b>q</b>
       <b>undefined,</b> <b>undef</b>
              Not enough information for calculation.

       <b>n</b>
       <b>never</b>  Never trust this key.

       <b>m</b>
       <b>marginal</b>
              Marginally trusted.

       <b>f</b>
       <b>full</b>   Fully trusted.

       <b>u</b>
       <b>ultimate</b>
              Ultimately trusted.

       <b>r</b>
       <b>revoked</b>
              For validity only: the key or the user ID has been revoked.

       <b>?</b>
       <b>err</b>    The program encountered an unknown trust value.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       There are a few configuration files to control certain aspects of <b>gpg</b>'s operation. Unless noted, they are
       expected in the current home directory (see: [option --homedir]).

       <b>gpg.conf</b>
              This  is  the  standard  configuration file read by <b>gpg</b> on startup.  It may contain any valid long
              option; the leading two dashes may not be entered and the option may  not  be  abbreviated.   This
              default  name may be changed on the command line (see: [gpg-option --options]).  You should backup
              this file.

       <b>common.conf</b>
              This is an optional configuration file read by <b>gpg</b> on startup.  It may contain options  pertaining
              to all components of GnuPG.  Its current main use is for the "use-keyboxd" option.  If the default
              home  directory  ‘<u><a href="file:~/.gnupg">~/.gnupg</a></u>’  does not exist, GnuPG creates this directory and a ‘<u>common.conf</u>’ file
              with "use_keyboxd".

       Note  that  on  larger  installations,  it  is  useful  to  put  predefined  files  into  the   directory
       ‘<u>/etc/skel/.gnupg</u>’ so that newly created users start up with a working configuration.  For existing users
       a small helper script is provided to create these files (see: [addgnupghome]).

       For  internal  purposes  <b>gpg</b>  creates  and maintains a few other files; They all live in the current home
       directory (see: [option --homedir]).  Only the <b>gpg</b> program may modify these files.

       <b><a href="file:~/.gnupg">~/.gnupg</a></b>
              This is the default home directory which is used if neither the environment variable <b>GNUPGHOME</b> nor
              the option <b>--homedir</b> is given.

       <b><a href="file:~/.gnupg/pubring.gpg">~/.gnupg/pubring.gpg</a></b>
              The public keyring using a legacy format.  You should backup this file.

              If this file is not available,  <b>gpg</b>  defaults  to  the  new  keybox  format  and  creates  a  file
              ‘<u>pubring.kbx</u>’  unless  that  file  already  exists  in  which case that file will also be used for
              OpenPGP keys.

              Note that in the case that both files, ‘<u>pubring.gpg</u>’ and ‘<u>pubring.kbx</u>’ exists but the  latter  has
              no OpenPGP keys, the legacy file ‘<u>pubring.gpg</u>’ will be used.  Take care: GnuPG versions before 2.1
              will  always  use  the file ‘<u>pubring.gpg</u>’ because they do not know about the new keybox format. In
              the case that you have to use GnuPG 1.4 to decrypt archived data you should keep this file.

       <b><a href="file:~/.gnupg/pubring.gpg.lock">~/.gnupg/pubring.gpg.lock</a></b>
              The lock file for the public keyring.

       <b><a href="file:~/.gnupg/pubring.kbx">~/.gnupg/pubring.kbx</a></b>
              The public keyring using the new keybox format.  This file  is  shared  with  <b>gpgsm</b>.   You  should
              backup this file.  See above for the relation between this file and it predecessor.

              To  convert  an  existing ‘<u>pubring.gpg</u>’ file to the keybox format, you first backup the ownertrust
              values, then rename ‘<u>pubring.gpg</u>’ to ‘<u>publickeys.backup</u>’, so it won’t be recognized by  any  GnuPG
              version, run import, and finally restore the ownertrust values:

         $ cd <a href="file:~/.gnupg">~/.gnupg</a>
         $ gpg --export-ownertrust &gt;otrust.lst
         $ mv pubring.gpg publickeys.backup
         $ gpg --import-options restore --import publickeys.backup
         $ gpg --import-ownertrust otrust.lst

       <b><a href="file:~/.gnupg/pubring.kbx.lock">~/.gnupg/pubring.kbx.lock</a></b>
              The lock file for ‘<u>pubring.kbx</u>’.

       <b><a href="file:~/.gnupg/secring.gpg">~/.gnupg/secring.gpg</a></b>
              The  legacy  secret keyring as used by GnuPG versions before 2.1.  It is not used by GnuPG 2.1 and
              later.  You may want to keep it in case you have to use GnuPG 1.4 to decrypt archived data.

       <b><a href="file:~/.gnupg/secring.gpg.lock">~/.gnupg/secring.gpg.lock</a></b>
              The lock file for the legacy secret keyring.

       <b><a href="file:~/.gnupg/.gpg-v21-migrated">~/.gnupg/.gpg-v21-migrated</a></b>
              File indicating that a migration to GnuPG 2.1 has been done.

       <b><a href="file:~/.gnupg/trustdb.gpg">~/.gnupg/trustdb.gpg</a></b>
              The trust database.  There is no need to backup this file; it is better to backup  the  ownertrust
              values (see: [option --export-ownertrust]).

       <b><a href="file:~/.gnupg/trustdb.gpg.lock">~/.gnupg/trustdb.gpg.lock</a></b>
              The lock file for the trust database.

       <b><a href="file:~/.gnupg/random_seed">~/.gnupg/random_seed</a></b>
              A file used to preserve the state of the internal random pool.

       <b><a href="file:~/.gnupg/openpgp-revocs.d/">~/.gnupg/openpgp-revocs.d/</a></b>
              This  is  the  directory  where  gpg  stores pre-generated revocation certificates.  The file name
              corresponds to the OpenPGP fingerprint of the respective key.  It is  suggested  to  backup  those
              certificates  and if the primary private key is not stored on the disk to move them to an external
              storage device.  Anyone who can access these files is able to revoke the corresponding  key.   You
              may  want  to print them out.  You should backup all files in this directory and take care to keep
              this backup closed away.

       Operation is further controlled by a few environment variables:

       <b>HOME</b>   Used to locate the default home directory.

       <b>GNUPGHOME</b>
              If set directory used instead of "<a href="file:~/.gnupg">~/.gnupg</a>".

       <b>GPG_AGENT_INFO</b>
              This variable is obsolete; it was used by GnuPG versions before 2.1.

       <b>PINENTRY_USER_DATA</b>
              This value is passed via gpg-agent to pinentry.  It is useful to convey  extra  information  to  a
              custom pinentry.

       <b>COLUMNS</b>
       <b>LINES</b>  Used to size some displays to the full size of the screen.

       <b>LANGUAGE</b>
              Apart  from  its use by GNU, it is used in the W32 version to override the language selection done
              through the Registry.  If used and set to a valid and available language name (<u>langid</u>),  the  file
              with  the translation is loaded from <u>gpgdir</u><b>/gnupg.nls/</b><u>langid</u><b>.mo</b><u>.</u>  <u>Here</u> <u>gpgdir</u> <u>is</u> <u>the</u> <u>directory</u> <u>out</u>
              <u>of</u> <u>which</u> <u>the</u> <u>gpg</u> <u>binary</u> <u>has</u> <u>been</u> <u>loaded.</u>  <u>If</u> <u>it</u> <u>can't</u> <u>be</u> <u>loaded</u> <u>the</u> <u>Registry</u> <u>is</u> <u>tried</u> <u>and</u> <u>as</u>  <u>last</u>
              <u>resort</u> <u>the</u> <u>native</u> <u>Windows</u> <u>locale</u> <u>system</u> <u>is</u> <u>used.</u>

       <b>GNUPG_BUILD_ROOT</b>
              This  variable  is  only  used  by  the  regression test suite as a helper under operating systems
              without proper support to figure out the name of a process' text file.

       <b>GNUPG_EXEC_DEBUG_FLAGS</b>
              This variable allows one to enable diagnostics for process management.  A numeric decimal value is
              expected.  Bit 0 enables general diagnostics, bit 1 enables certain warnings on Windows.

       When calling the gpg-agent component <b>gpg</b> sends a set of environment variables to gpg-agent.  The names of
       these variables can be listed using the command:

           gpg-connect-agent 'getinfo std_env_names' /bye | awk '$1=="D" {print $2}'

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>gpg</b> is often used as a backend engine by other software.  To help with this a machine interface has  been
       defined  to  have  an  unambiguous way to do this.  The options <b>--status-fd</b> and <b>--batch</b> are almost always
       required for this.

   <b>Programmatic</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>GnuPG</b>

       Please consider using GPGME instead of calling <b>gpg</b> directly.  GPGME offers a stable,  backend-independent
       interface for many cryptographic operations.  It supports OpenPGP and S/MIME, and also allows interaction
       with various GnuPG components.

       GPGME  provides  a  C-API, and comes with bindings for C++, Qt, and Python.  Bindings for other languages
       are available.

   <b>Ephemeral</b> <b>home</b> <b>directories</b>

       Sometimes you want to contain effects of some operation, for example you want to import a key to  inspect
       it,  but  you  do  not  want  this key to be added to your keyring.  In earlier versions of GnuPG, it was
       possible to specify alternate keyring files for both public and secret keys.  In modern  GnuPG  versions,
       however, we changed how secret keys are stored in order to better protect secret key material, and it was
       not possible to preserve this interface.

       The  preferred  way  to  do  this  is to use ephemeral home directories.  This technique works across all
       versions of GnuPG.

       Create a temporary directory, create (or copy) a configuration that meets your needs, make <b>gpg</b>  use  this
       directory  either using the environment variable <u>GNUPGHOME</u>, or the option <b>--homedir</b>.  GPGME supports this
       too on a per-context basis, by modifying the engine info of contexts.  Now execute whatever operation you
       like, import and export key material as necessary.  Once finished, you can  delete  the  directory.   All
       GnuPG backend services that were started will detect this and shut down.

   <b>The</b> <b>quick</b> <b>key</b> <b>manipulation</b> <b>interface</b>

       Recent  versions  of  GnuPG  have  an  interface to manipulate keys without using the interactive command
       <b>--edit-key</b>.  This interface was added mainly for the benefit of GPGME (please consider using  GPGME,  see
       the  manual  subsection  ``Programmatic  use  of GnuPG'').  This interface is described in the subsection
       ``How to manage your keys''.

   <b>Unattended</b> <b>key</b> <b>generation</b>

       The command <b>--generate-key</b> may be used along with the option <b>--batch</b> for unattended key generation.  This
       is the most flexible way of generating keys, but it is also the most complex  one.   Consider  using  the
       quick  key  manipulation  interface  described  in  the  previous subsection ``The quick key manipulation
       interface''.

       The parameters for the key are either read from stdin or given as a file on the command line.  The format
       of the parameter file is as follows: Text only, line length is limited to about 1000  characters.   UTF-8
       encoding  must  be  used to specify non-ASCII characters.  Empty lines are ignored.  Leading and trailing
       white space is ignored.  A hash sign as the first non white space character  indicates  a  comment  line.
       Control  statements are indicated by a leading percent sign, their arguments are separated by white space
       from the keyword.  Parameters are specified by a keyword, followed by a colon; arguments are separated by
       white space.  The first parameter must be ‘Key-Type’ but control statements may be placed anywhere.   The
       order  of  the  parameters  does  not matter except for ‘Key-Type’.  The parameters are only used for the
       generated keyblock (primary and subkeys); parameters from previous sets are not used.  Some syntax checks
       may be performed.  Key commences when either  the  end  of  the  parameter  file  is  reached,  the  next
       ‘Key-Type’ parameter is encountered, or the control statement ‘%commit’ is encountered.

       Control statements:

       <b>%echo</b> <u>text</u>
              Print <u>text</u> as diagnostic.

       <b>%dry-run</b>
              Suppress actual key generation (useful for syntax checking).

       <b>%commit</b>
              Perform the key generation.  Note that an implicit commit is done at the next  parameter.

       <b>%pubring</b> <u>filename</u>
              Do  not  write  the key to the default or commandline given keyring but to <u>filename</u>.  This must be
              given before the first commit to take place, duplicate  specification  of  the  same  filename  is
              ignored,  the last filename before a commit is used.  The filename is used until a new filename is
              used (at commit points) and all keys are written to that file. If a new filename  is  given,  this
              file is created (and overwrites an existing one).

              See  the previous subsection ``Ephemeral home directories'' for a more robust way to contain side-
              effects.

       <b>%secring</b> <u>filename</u>
              This option is a no-op for GnuPG 2.1 and later.

              See the previous subsection ``Ephemeral home directories''.

       <b>%ask-passphrase</b>
       <b>%no-ask-passphrase</b>
              This option is a no-op since GnuPG version 2.1.

       <b>%no-protection</b>
              Using this option allows the creation of keys without any passphrase protection.  This  option  is
              mainly intended for regression tests.

       <b>%transient-key</b>
              If  given  the keys are created using a faster and a somewhat less secure random number generator.
              This option may be used for keys which are only used for a short time  and  do  not  require  full
              cryptographic  strength.   It  takes  only  effect  if  used  together  with the control statement
              ‘%no-protection’.

       General Parameters:

       <b>Key-Type:</b> <u>algo</u>
              Starts a new parameter block by giving the type of the primary key. The algorithm must be  capable
              of  signing.   This  is a required parameter.  <u>algo</u> may either be an OpenPGP algorithm number or a
              string with the algorithm name.  The special value ‘default’ may be used for <u>algo</u>  to  create  the
              default  key  type;  in  this case a ‘Key-Usage’ shall not be given and ‘default’ also be used for
              ‘Subkey-Type’.

       <b>Key-Length:</b> <u>nbits</u>
              The requested length of the generated key in bits.  The default is returned by running the command
              ‘gpg --gpgconf-list’.  For ECC keys this parameter is ignored.

       <b>Key-Curve:</b> <u>curve</u>
              The requested elliptic curve of the generated key.  This is a required parameter for ECC keys.  It
              is ignored for non-ECC keys.

       <b>Key-Grip:</b> <u>hexstring</u>
              This is optional and used to generate a CSR or certificate for  an  already  existing  key.   Key-
              Length will be ignored when given.

       <b>Key-Usage:</b> <u>usage-list</u>
              Space  or  comma  delimited list of key usages.  Allowed values are ‘encrypt’, ‘sign’, and ‘auth’.
              This is used to generate the key flags.  Please make sure that the algorithm is  capable  of  this
              usage.   Note  that  OpenPGP  requires  that  all primary keys are capable of certification, so no
              matter what usage is given here, the ‘cert’ flag will be on.  If no ‘Key-Usage’ is  specified  and
              the  ‘Key-Type’ is not ‘default’, all allowed usages for that particular algorithm are used; if it
              is not given but ‘default’ is used the usage will be ‘sign’.

       <b>Subkey-Type:</b> <u>algo</u>
              This generates a secondary key (subkey).  Currently only one subkey  can  be  handled.   See  also
              ‘Key-Type’ above.

       <b>Subkey-Length:</b> <u>nbits</u>
              Length of the secondary key (subkey) in bits.  The default is returned by running the command ‘gpg
              --gpgconf-list’.

       <b>Subkey-Curve:</b> <u>curve</u>
              Key curve for a subkey; similar to ‘Key-Curve’.

       <b>Subkey-Usage:</b> <u>usage-list</u>
              Key usage lists for a subkey; similar to ‘Key-Usage’.

       <b>Passphrase:</b> <u>string</u>
              If  you  want  to  specify  a passphrase for the secret key, enter it here.  Default is to use the
              Pinentry dialog to ask for a passphrase.

       <b>Name-Real:</b> <u>name</u>
       <b>Name-Comment:</b> <u>comment</u>
       <b>Name-Email:</b> <u>email</u>
              The three parts of a user name.  Remember to use UTF-8 encoding here.  If you don't  give  any  of
              them, no user ID is created.

       <b>Expire-Date:</b> <u>iso-date</u><b>|(</b><u>number</u><b>[d|w|m|y])</b>
              Set the expiration date for the key (and the subkey).  It may either be entered in ISO date format
              (e.g. "20000815T145012") or as number of days, weeks, month or years after the creation date.  The
              special  notation  "seconds=N"  is  also  allowed  to  specify a number of seconds since creation.
              Without a letter days are assumed.  Note that there is no check done on the overflow of  the  type
              used  by  OpenPGP  for  timestamps.   Thus  you  better make sure that the given value make sense.
              Although OpenPGP works with time intervals, GnuPG uses an absolute value internally and  thus  the
              last year we can represent is 2105.

       <b>Creation-Date:</b> <u>iso-date</u>
              Set  the  creation  date of the key as stored in the key information and which is also part of the
              fingerprint  calculation.   Either  a  date  like  "1986-04-26"   or   a   full   timestamp   like
              "19860426T042640"  may  be  used.   The  time  is  considered  to  be  UTC.   The special notation
              "seconds=N" may be used to directly specify a the number of seconds since Epoch (Unix  time).   If
              it is not given the current time is used.

       <b>Preferences:</b> <u>string</u>
              Set  the cipher, hash, and compression preference values for this key.  This expects the same type
              of string as the sub-command ‘setpref’ in the <b>--edit-key</b> menu.

       <b>Revoker:</b> <u>algo</u><b>:</b><u>fpr</u> <b>[sensitive]</b>
              Add a designated revoker to the generated key.  Algo is the public key algorithm of the designated
              revoker (i.e. RSA=1, DSA=17, etc.)  <u>fpr</u> is the fingerprint of the designated revoker.  <u>fpr</u> may not
              contain spaces or colons.  The optional ‘sensitive’ flag marks the designated revoker as sensitive
              information.  Only v4 and v5 keys may be designated revokers.

       <b>Keyserver:</b> <u>string</u>
              This is an optional parameter that specifies the preferred keyserver URL for the key.

       <b>Handle:</b> <u>string</u>
              This is an optional parameter only used with the status  lines  KEY_CREATED  and  KEY_NOT_CREATED.
              <u>string</u>  may  be  up  to  100 characters and should not contain spaces.  It is useful for batch key
              generation to associate a key parameter block with a status line.

       Here is an example on how to create a key in an ephemeral home directory:
         $ export GNUPGHOME="$(mktemp -d)"
         $ cat &gt;foo &lt;&lt;EOF
              %echo Generating a basic OpenPGP key
              Key-Type: DSA
              Key-Length: 1024
              Subkey-Type: ELG-E
              Subkey-Length: 1024
              Name-Real: Joe Tester

              Passphrase: abc
              # Do a commit here, so that we can later print "done" :-)
              %commit
              %echo done
         EOF
         $ gpg --batch --generate-key foo
          [...]
         $ gpg --list-secret-keys
         /tmp/tmp.0NQxB74PEf/pubring.kbx

       If you want to create a key with the default algorithms you would use these parameters:
              %echo Generating a default key
              Key-Type: default
              Subkey-Type: default

              %commit
              %echo done

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       On older systems this program should be installed as setuid(root).  This  is  necessary  to  lock  memory
       pages.  Locking  memory  pages prevents the operating system from writing memory pages (which may contain
       passphrases or other sensitive material) to disk. If you get no warning  message  about  insecure  memory
       your  operating  system supports locking without being root. The program drops root privileges as soon as
       locked memory is allocated.

       Note also that some systems (especially laptops) have the ability to ``suspend to disk'' (also  known  as
       ``safe  sleep''  or ``hibernate'').  This writes all memory to disk before going into a low power or even
       powered off mode.  Unless measures are taken in  the  operating  system  to  protect  the  saved  memory,
       passphrases or other sensitive material may be recoverable from it later.

       Before you report a bug you should first search the mailing list archives for similar problems and second
       check whether such a bug has already been reported to our bug tracker at <b>https://bugs.gnupg.org</b>.
