</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       datezone - Convert DATE/TIMEs between timezones.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>datezone</b> [<u>OPTION</u>]...  [<u>ZONENAME</u>]... [<u>DATE/TIME</u>]...

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Convert DATE/TIMEs between timezones.  If DATE/TIME is omitted, it defaults to `now'.

       DATE/TIME can also be one of the following specials
         - `now'           interpreted as the current (UTC) time stamp
         - `time'          the time part of the current (UTC) time stamp
         - `today'         the current date (according to UTC)
         - `tomo[rrow]'    tomorrow's date (according to UTC)
         - `y[ester]day'   yesterday's date (according to UTC)

       When DATE/TIME is a date (i.e. the time component is omitted) the result will show the timezone offset at
       the end of that day.

       When  DATE/TIME  is a time (i.e. the date component is omitted) the conversion takes place on the date as
       specified by --base|-b, by default the current date.

       Recognized <u>OPTION</u>s:

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
              display this help and exit

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--version</b>
              output version information and exit

       <b>-q</b>, <b>--quiet</b>
              Suppress message about date/time or zonename parser errors and fix-ups.  The default is to print a
              warning or the fixed up value and return error code 2.

       <b>-b</b>, <b>--base</b>=<u>DT</u>
              For underspecified input use DT as a fallback to fill in missing fields.  Also used for  ambiguous
              format  specifiers  to  position  their  range  on the absolute time line.  Must be a date/time in
              ISO8601 format.  If omitted defaults to the current date/time.

       <b>-i</b>, <b>--input-format</b>=<u>STRING</u>...
              Input format, can be used multiple times.  Each date/time will  be  passed  to  the  input  format
              parsers  in  the  order they are given, if a date/time can be read successfully with a given input
              format specifier string, that value will be used.

       <b>--from-locale</b>=<u>LOCALE</u>
              Interpret dates on stdin or the command line as coming from the locale  LOCALE,  this  would  only
              affect month and weekday names as input formats have to be specified explicitly.

       <b>--from-zone</b>=<u>ZONE</u>
              Interpret dates on stdin or the command line as coming from the time zone ZONE.

       <b>--next</b> Show next transition from/to DST.

       <b>--prev</b> Show previous transition from/to DST.

</pre><h4><b>FORMAT</b> <b>SPECS</b></h4><pre>
       Format specs in dateutils are similar to posix' strftime().

       However, due to a broader range of supported calendars dateutils must employ different rules.

       Date specs:
         %a  The abbreviated weekday name
         %A  The full weekday name
         %_a The weekday name shortened to a single character (MTWRFAS)
         %b  The abbreviated month name
         %B  The full month name
         %_b The month name shortened to a single character (FGHJKMNQUVXZ)
         %c  The count of the weekday within the month (range 00 to 05)
         %C  The count of the weekday within the year (range 00 to 53)
         %d  The day of the month, 2 digits (range 00 to 31)
         %D  The day of the year, 3 digits (range 000 to 366)
         %F  Equivalent to %Y-%m-%d (ymd's canonical format)
         %g  ISO week date year without the century (range 00 to 99)
         %G  ISO week date year including the century
         %j  Equivalent to %D
         %m  The month in the current calendar (range 00 to 12)
         %Q  The quarter of the year (range Q1 to Q4)
         %q  The number of the quarter (range 01 to 04)
         %s  The number of seconds since the Epoch.
         %u  The weekday as number (range 01 to 07, Sunday being 07)
         %U  The week count,  day of week is Sun (range 00 to 53)
         %V  The ISO week count,  day of week is Mon (range 01 to 53)
         %w  The weekday as number (range 00 to 06, Sunday being 00)
         %W  The week count,  day of week is Mon (range 00 to 53)
         %y  The year without a century (range 00 to 99)
         %Y  The year including the century
         %_y The year shortened to a single digit
         %Z  The zone offset in hours and minutes (HH:MM) with
             a preceding sign (+ for offsets east of UTC, - for offsets
             west of UTC)

         %Od The day as roman numerals
         %Om The month as roman numerals
         %Oy The two digit year as roman numerals
         %OY The year including the century as roman numerals

         %rs In time systems whose Epoch is different from the unix Epoch, this
             selects the number of seconds since then.
         %rY In calendars with years that don't coincide with the Gregorian
             years, this selects the calendar's year.

         %dth  The day of the month as an ordinal number, 1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.
         %mth  The month of the year as an ordinal number, 1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.

         %db The business day of the month (since last month's ultimo)
         %dB Number of business days until this month's ultimo

       Time specs:
         %H  The hour of the day using a 24h clock, 2 digits (range 00 to 23)
         %I  The hour of the day using a 12h clock, 2 digits (range 01 to 12)
         %M  The minute (range 00 to 59)
         %N  The nanoseconds (range 000000000 to 999999999)
         %p  The string AM or PM, noon is PM and midnight is AM.
         %P  Like %p but in lowercase
         %S  The  (range 00 to 60, 60 is for leap seconds)
         %T  Equivalent to %H:%M:%S

       General specs:
         %n  A newline character
         %t  A tab character
         %%  A literal % character

       Modifiers:
         %O  Modifier to turn decimal numbers into Roman numerals
         %r  Modifier to turn units into real units
         %0  Modifier to turn on zero prefixes
         %SPC  Modifier to turn on space prefixes
         %-  Modifier to turn off prefixes altogether
         th  Suffix, read and print ordinal numbers
         b   Suffix, treat days as business days

       By design dates before 1601-01-01 are not supported.

       For conformity here is a list of calendar designators and their corresponding format string:
         ymd     %Y-%m-%d
         ymcw    %Y-%m-%c-%w
         ywd     %rY-W%V-%u
         bizda   %Y-%m-%db
         lilian     n/a
         ldn        n/a
         julian     n/a
         jdn        n/a
         matlab     n/a
         mdn        n/a

       These   designators  can  be  used  as  output  format  string,  moreover,  @code{lilian}/@code{ldn}  and
       @code{julian}/@code{jdn} can also be used as input format string.
