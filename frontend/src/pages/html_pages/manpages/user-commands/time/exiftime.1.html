</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       <b>exiftime</b> - display or adjust date &amp; time Exif tags; list files ordered by their Exif date &amp; time tags

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>exiftime</b> [<b>-filqw</b>] [<b>-s</b> <u>delim</u>] [<b>-t</b>[<b>acdg</b>]] [<b>-v</b>[<b>+</b>|<b>-</b>]<u>val</u>[<b>ymwdHMS</b>]] <u>file</u> <u>...</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       When  invoked  without  arguments, the <b>exiftime</b> utility displays the Exif date and time tags contained in
       each input <u>file</u> to the standard output.  Otherwise, depending on the  options  specified,  <b>exiftime</b>  will
       operate on only the chosen tags, will adjust the date and time, will write an adjusted time to each <u>file</u>,
       or will list each <u>file</u> in ascending order by date and time.

       Most  digital  cameras  include  one or more date and time tags in the Exif data added to the image files
       they produce.  These tags are:

       Image Created
           The date and time the image was created or changed.  This is the most common tag.

       Image Generated
           The date and time the original image data was generated (i.e., when picture was taken).

       Image Digitized
           The date and time the image was stored as digital data.

       The format for these tags is "YYYY:MM:DD HH:MM:SS" with the time shown in 24-hour format.   The  <b>exiftime</b>
       utility cannot add a tag if it does not already exist in <u>file</u>.

       By  default, <b>exiftime</b> will simply print out any of the three date and time flags in each input <u>file</u>.  The
       <b>-l</b> flag will produce a listing of each input <u>file</u> in date/time order, suitable for use in  further  image
       processing (e.g., production of a Web catalog) when filename ordering is not useful.

       The  <b>-v</b>  flag  may be used to vary, or adjust, dates and times.  When used with the <b>-w</b> flag, which writes
       the adjusted date and time to each input <u>file</u>, one may, for example, process a batch of files  to  adjust
       for a camera's incorrectly set clock.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       -f     Write adjusted date and time tags without prompting for confirmation.

       -i     Output  a prompt to standard error before overwriting a date and time tag with the adjusted value.
              If the response from the standard input begins with 'y' or 'Y',  the  tag  is  overwritten.   This
              option is default behavior.

       -l     List  each input <u>file</u> in ascending order by timestamp.  By default, it uses the Image Created tag.
              In the absence of an Image Created tag, first Image  Generated  then  Image  Digitized  are  used.
              Alternatively,  the  <b>-t</b>  flag may be used to specify the timestamp preference for ordering.  If no
              date and time tags are present, the OS's epoch is used.  This flag overrides all others but the <b>-t</b>
              flag.

       -q     Do not output details of a date and time adjustment to standard out when using the <b>-w</b> flag.

       -s     Separate field name and value with the string <u>delim</u>.  The default is ': '.

       -t     Select the date and time tags for display or adjustment when followed by one or  more  of  <b>a</b>  (all
              tags), <b>c</b> (Image Created), <b>d</b> (Image Digitized), or <b>g</b> (Image Generated).

       -v     Adjust  the date and time tags' second, minute, hour, month day, week day, month or year according
              to <u>val</u>.  If <u>val</u> is preceded with a plus or minus sign, the date is adjusted forwards or  backwards
              according  to  the remaining string; otherwise the relevant part of the date is set.  The date can
              be adjusted as many times as required using these flags.  Flags are processed in the order given.

              When providing an absolute value (rather than a relative adjustment), seconds  are  in  the  range
              0-59,  minutes  are  in  the  range 0-59, hours are in the range 0-23, month days are in the range
              1-31, week days are in the range 0-6 (Sun-Sat), months are in the range 1-12 (Jan-Dec)  and  years
              are in the range 80-38 or 1980-2038.

              If  <u>val</u> is numeric, one of either <b>y</b>, <b>m</b>, <b>w</b>, <b>d</b>, <b>H</b>, <b>M</b>, or <b>S</b> must be used to specify which part of the
              date is to be adjusted.

              The week day or month may be specified using a name rather than a number.  If a name is used  with
              the plus (or minus) sign, the date will be put forwards (or backwards) to the next (previous) date
              that matches the given week day or month.  This will not adjust the date, if the given week day or
              month is the same as the current one.

              When  the  date is adjusted to a specific value that doesn't actually exist (for example March 26,
              1:30 BST 2000 in the Europe/London timezone), the date will be silently adjusted forwards in units
              of one hour until it reaches a valid time.  When the date is adjusted to  a  specific  value  that
              occurs  twice  (for example October 29, 1:30 2000), the resulting timezone will be set so that the
              date matches the earlier of the two times.  In all cases, daylight savings time considerations are
              ignored.

              Refer to the examples below for further details.

       -w     Write the adjusted date and time tags.  By default, any of the three date and time tags present in
              the file are adjusted; otherwise, only those specified with the <b>-t</b> flag are adjusted.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       The command

              exiftime example1.jpg

       will display:

              Image Created: 2003:09:12 17:05:37
              Image Generated: 2003:09:12 17:05:37
              Image Digitized: 2003:09:12 17:05:37

       The command

              exiftime -tcd example1.jpg

       will display:

              Image Created: 2003:09:12 17:05:37
              Image Digitized: 2003:09:12 17:05:37

       The command

              exiftime -v+3H example1.jpg

       will adjust each time forward by three hours and display:

              Image Created: 2003:09:12 20:05:37
              Image Generated: 2003:09:12 20:05:37
              Image Digitized: 2003:09:12 20:05:37

       The command

              exiftime -v+5d -v-7M -fw -tg *.jpg

       will adjust the date ahead five days and the time back seven minutes and write the adjusted date and time
       to the Image Generated tag without a prompt for confirmation  for  all  files  that  match  "*.jpg".   It
       displays:

              example1.jpg:
              Image Generated: 2003:09:12 17:05:37 -&gt; 2003:09:17 16:58:37

              example2.jpg:
              Image Generated: 2004:01:22 17:07:02 -&gt; 2004:01:27 17:00:02

       The command

              exiftime -l -tdg *.jpg

       will list all files that match "*.jpg", one per line, in ascending timestamp order.  It'll attempt to use
       the  following timestamp values, in order: Image Digitized, Image Generated, Image Created, and, finally,
       the OS's epoch.

</pre><h4><b>STANDARDS</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>exiftime</b>  utility   was   developed   using   the   2003   draft   Exif   standard,   version   2.21
       (<a href="http://tsc.jeita.or.jp/">http://tsc.jeita.or.jp/</a>).

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Does  not support the Exif tags SubsecTime, SubsecTimeOriginal, or SubsecTimeDigitized.  Does not support
       manufacturer-specific date and time tags.

</pre><h4><b>AUTHOR</b></h4><pre>
