</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>sunclock</u> is an X11 application that displays a map of the Earth and shows the illuminated portion of  the
       globe.   In  addition  to providing local time for the default timezone, it also displays GMT time, legal
       and solar time of major cities, their latitude and longitude, the mutual distances of arbitrary locations
       on Earth, the position at zenith of Sun and Moon. Sunclock can display meridians, parallels, tropics  and
       arctic  circles.  It  has  builtin  functions that accelerate the speed of time and show the evolution of
       seasons. Sunclock can be internationalized for various western languages. It is possible to customize the
       app-default file and enter additional city entries.

       Sunclock can commute between two states, the "clock window"  and  the  "map  window".  The  clock  window
       displays  a  small  map  of  the  Earth and therefore occupies little space on the screen, while the "map
       window" displays a large map and  offers  more  advanced  functions.  The  Sunclock  package  includes  a
       resizable  and  zoomable vector map . External Earth maps can also be loaded (starting with version 3.51,
       formats .jpg, .gif, .png, .xpm or .xpm.gz, .vmf can be read [.vmf is the specific vector  map  format  of
       sunclock]).  Some additional formats could be added in the future.

       The map window can work in five different modes:

       - "Legal time" mode: legal time of default time zone and GMT time are displayed.

       -  "Coordinate"  mode:  by  clicking on a city, users get coordinates (latitude, longitude) of that city,
       legal time and sunrise/sunset.

       - "Solar" mode: by clicking on a point of the map (either a city or another point), solar  time  and  day
       length are shown.

       -  "Hour  Extension" mode: displays solar times from 00:00 to 23:00 in bottom strip, according to the Sun
       position.

       - "Distance" mode: shows distances in km and miles between two arbitrary locations.

       Depending on the mode chosen, the bottom line shows a short text displaying  the  requested  information.
       The  bottom line can be scrolled to the right or to the left by pressing the PageUp/PageDown and Home/End
       key arrows.

       A further functionality is the "Progress" feature, which allows one to accelerate the evolution of  time,
       so  as  to  observe the evolution of day/night periods and seasons. By default, the Sun and Moon are also
       shown on the map (rather, the  positions  of  Earth  where  Sun  and  Moon  are  at  zenith  are  shown).
       Coordinates of meridians, parallels, cities, the names of cities can be displayed on the map.

       All  functionalities  can be accessed though GUI actions on the main window or the auxiliary windows. The
       main window is resizable by pulling the window edges - as the current window manager permits  it.   There
       are 5 auxiliary windows:

       -  Menu  Window. This is the main menu, which offers a wide list of actions.  The menu window is launched
       by typing 'H' or clicking on the bottom strip with the  left  mouse  button  once.  Each  action  can  be
       obtained  by  using  the  indicated  keyboard shortcut or by clicking with the mouse on the corresponding
       entry. Upper/lower case is irrelevant, except for options or actions which have  more  than  2  switches.
       Lower  case  then  rotates  the  switches  in one direction, upper case in the other direction. For those
       switches, the left mouse button will have the same effect as lower case, and the right mouse  button  the
       same effect as upper case.

       -  File  Selector  window.  It  can be accessed by clicking on the upper part of the main window with the
       middle mouse button. It allows one to select the Earth image file  (in  formats  *.vmf  *.xpm,  *.xpm.gz,
       *.jpg, *.gif, *.png) to be loaded.

       -  Zoom  window. It can be accessed by clicking on the upper part of the main window with the right mouse
       button. The zoom window allows one to select a specific area on the Earth, to translate or zoom it up  to
       100  times. High resolutions (larger than 10) are only recommended with the "huge" Earthmap of 11 Mbytes,
       which offers clean images up to 20 times magnification at least.

       - Urban selector window. Allows one to modify interactively the list of shown cities and locations.

       - Option window. Allows one to reconfigure pretty much  everything  on  the  fly  (colors,  fonts,  etc),
       exactly as with the command line options.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The  program  does  not  use the Xt nor any other more advanced toolkit, and hence only (!) those options
       explicitly enumerated below may be used.  The only  needed  resource  is  the  list  of  coordinates  and
       timezones  of  cities  to  be  displayed. The system administrator can possibly customize the system-wide
       prepackaged config file Sunclockrc before installing the package, while users can tweak their  individual
       configuration  file  <a href="file:~/.sunclockrc">~/.sunclockrc</a>  at any time. The individual config file <a href="file:~/.sunclockrc">~/.sunclockrc</a> is read *after*
       the system wide config file Sunclockrc, and therefore its settings override  those  of  the  system  wide
       config. The command line options can be used to override <a href="file:~/.sunclockrc">~/.sunclockrc</a> itself.

       <b>-help</b>  Show brief help and exit.

       <b>-listmenu</b>
              Explanations on the actions available from the builtin menu.

       <b>-version</b>
              Show program version and exit.

       <b>-verbose</b>
              Make  Sunclock  verbose.  The  program  then  sends  to  stderr  some  information on the internal
              operations performed. This is disabled by default.

       <b>-silent</b>
              Make Sunclock silent about internal operations performed. This is the default.

       <b>-citycheck</b>
              At start-up, check that there are no repetitions in the list of cities (a city is considered to be
              repeated if it appears twice under the same name,  with  coordinates  differing  by  at  most  0.5
              degree).  By default no check is performed on Sunclockrc - which is supposedly correctly set up...

       <b>-display</b>  <b>dispname</b>
              Give the name of the X server to contact.

       <b>-language</b>  <b>name</b>
              Select language to be used in the sunclock menu and help.

       <b>-title</b> <b>name</b>
              Change  the  specification  of  the  string  which  should appear in the title bar of the main and
              auxiliary windows. Default is the application name, i.e., sunclock.

       <b>-classname</b> <b>name</b>
              Change the specification of class application name. Default is Sunclock. Other specifications  can
              be  passed  so  that aware window managers might use it for configuration purposes. You might e.g.
              pass -classname NoTitle-Sticky, and configure properly your WM so that it removes the  title  bar,
              and  make  the  window  sticky  with  respect  to  the Desktop Pager. With fvwm, you could use for
              instance

       Style "*NoTitle*"    NoTitle, WindowListHit, Sticky

       Style "*ShowTitle*"  Title, WindowListHit, Slippery

       Style "*Sticky*"     Sticky

       to specify such a behaviour.

       <b>-setfont</b>  <b>&lt;field&gt;|&lt;fontsetting&gt;{|&lt;languages&gt;}</b>
              Select the font for the given text field (clockstrip, menustrip, city, coord,  menu).  Optionally,
              one  can  specify a list of languages for which this font setting should apply. If the &lt;languages&gt;
              option is not specified, the font setting applies to all languages.

       <b>-rcfile</b>  <b>filename</b>
              Read a configuration file that is different from the user default <a href="file:~/.sunclockrc">~/.sunclockrc</a> (if this option is
              not set, the user config file defaults to <a href="file:~/.sunclockrc">~/.sunclockrc</a>). Notice that the app-default config  file
              Sunclockrc is read first, and the file set by the -rcfile option is read afterwards; therefore its
              settings  override  those  set  by  the  system  wide config file. Reading further config files is
              possible at runtime, using the option window. Set -rcfile with a void string ""  if  you  wish  to
              bypass the user config file step.

       <b>-sharedir</b>  <b>directory</b>
              Set   the   directory   where   system   wide   shared   Earthmaps   are   located.    Default  is
              /usr/share/sunclock/earthmaps.

       <b>-image</b>  <b>*.jpg</b> <b>(or</b> <b>*.gif,</b> <b>*.png,</b> <b>*.vmf,</b> <b>*.xpm,</b> <b>*.xpm.gz)</b>
              Start sunclock with an Earth map image loaded in the clock and map windows. The same map  is  then
              used for both windows, but the clock image is usually scaled down.

       <b>-mapimage</b>  <b>*.jpg</b> <b>(or</b> <b>*.gif,</b> <b>*.png,</b> <b>*.vmf,</b> <b>*.xpm,</b> <b>*.xpm.gz)</b>
              Start sunclock with an Earth map image loaded in the map window.

       <b>-clockimage</b>  <b>*.jpg</b> <b>(or</b> <b>*.gif,</b> <b>*.png,</b> <b>*.vmf,</b> <b>*.xpm,</b> <b>*.xpm.gz)</b>
              Start sunclock with an Earth map image loaded in the clock window.

       <b>-zoomimage</b>  <b>*.jpg</b> <b>(or</b> <b>*.gif,</b> <b>*.png,</b> <b>*.vmf,</b> <b>*.xpm,</b> <b>*.xpm.gz)</b>
              Use specified file as image in the zoom widget

       <b>-colorlevel</b>  <b>level=0,1,2,3</b>
              Sets  the  color  level  (0=monochrome,  1=few  colors,  2=many  colors,  3=full colors). With the
              "monochrome" setting, day and night appear respectively  as  mapbgcolor  (white  by  default)  and
              mapfgcolor  (black  by  default),  and  no  shading  is available; all other features (city names,
              coordinates) appear also as monochrome.  With the "few colors" setting, the menus and  city  spots
              can   be  represented  with  dedicated  colors,  but  the  meridians/parallels/tropics  are  still
              monochrome. With the "many colors" oprions,  meridians/parallels/tropics  can  also  be  drawn  in
              color.   In  these  first 3 modes, only .vmf vector maps can be loaded.  These modes save a lot of
              CPU power - since a simple algorithm of inversion of colors is used to set colors of all points in
              the map.  Monochrome mode can be useful for very slow CPUs, such as those  in  use  in  PDAs  with
              black  and  white  screen. The full color mode (level=3) allows one to load jpeg or other colorful
              images; day and night can be drawn with various  shading  parameters.  This  is  the  default  and
              recommended mode if you have a reasonably recent machine with enough video RAM.

       <b>-dock</b>  This  option  is  meant to give sunclock the ability to be docked in the window manager buttons or
              menu bar, providing that the WM offers this possibility without requiring special hints (fvwm2  or
              windowmaker  or  afterstep will work perfectly well for that purpose, KDE or Gnome won't...) Under
              the -dock option, sunclock locks the size of the first launched window,  which  is  necessarily  a
              small clock. Also, that initial window can no longer be closed by typing 'K' or 'Q'. (The only way
              to  exit  the  application, then, is to kill it with xkill, or to undock it first with the -undock
              option from the Option window).  The user might want to customize the size and suitable options so
              that sunclock fits with the size of the dockable applets. As an example, sunclock could be invoked
              as follows:

              sunclock    -language    fr    -nobottomline    -dock    -clockgeom    63x42+2+190     -dateformat
              "%H:%M:%S|%a%_%d%_%b|%b%_%Y|%j%_%U/52" -command "xdiary"

       <b>-undock</b>
              Undocks  sunclock.  This  option  has no other effect than reallowing the use of options that were
              "frozen" under -dock. It can be used e.g. to exit the application when sunclock has  been  started
              in dock mode.

       <b>-synchro</b>
              With  this option, sunclock updates all windows simultaneously. This, of course, requires more CPU
              time and may slow down sunclock's operation if too many windows have been opened. The  default  is
              to update only the active window.

       <b>-nosynchro</b>
              With this option, sunclock only updates the active window. This is the default.

       <b>-clock</b> Start in the clock state. This is the default and thus need not be specified.

       <b>-dateformat</b> <b>string1|string2|...</b>
              Set  the  format(s)  used  in  the text output in the bottom strip of the clock.  The default date
              format consists of 3 strings:

         %H:%M%_%a%_%d%_%b%_%y|%H:%M:%S%_%Z|%a%_%j/%t%_%U/52

       Here %H,%M,%S stand for hour, minutes, seconds, %a for dayname, %b for monthname, %d for monthday number,
       %j for yearday number, %m for month number, %y for year last two digits,  %Y  for  year  number,  %t  for
       number  of  days  in year (365 or 366), %Z for timezone, %U for week number (week #1 is the week with the
       first thursday of the year); all other characters are reproduced as such, except %_ which  stands  for  a
       blank  space,  %% which stands for % and %| which stands for |. The vertical bar | is used as a delimiter
       to indicate successive time formats. There can be as many formats as desired, and  the  actual  selection
       cycles  through  all these formats by clicking on the bottom strip with the mouse. The first string (i.e.
       the one preceding the first bar) is taken as the default format. There are a few other switches, such  as
       %h for hour in 12-hour mode, %P fo AM/PM indicator, %G for hour in GMT time, %N for minutes in GMT time.

       <b>-map</b>   Start in the map state.  Useful to start right away with advanced functionalities.

       <b>-decimal</b>
              Initializes coordinate values of geographical data in decimal degrees.  However, this can still be
              switched at runtime.

       <b>-dms</b>   Initializes  coordinate values of geographical data in degrees, minutes and seconds. However, this
              can still be switched at runtime.

       <b>-menu</b>  Raise the menu window along with the main (map, clock) window.

       <b>-nomenu</b>
              Don't raise the menu window along with the main (map, clock) window.  This is the default.

       <b>-selector</b>
              Raise the selector window along with the main (map, clock) window.

       <b>-noselector</b>
              Don't raise the selector window along with the main (map, clock) window.  This is the default.

       <b>-zoom</b>  Raise the zoom window along with the main (map, clock) window.

       <b>-nozoom</b>
              Don't raise the zoom window along with the main (map, clock) window.  This is the default.

       <b>-option</b>
              Raise the option window along with the main (map, clock) window.

       <b>-nooption</b>
              Don't raise the option window along with the main (map, clock) window.  This is the default.

       <b>-urban</b> Raise the urban window along with the main (map, clock) window.

       <b>-nourban</b>
              Don't raise the urban window along with the main (map, clock) window.  This is the default.

       <b>-aspect</b>  <b>mode</b>
              Sets the aspect mode, i.e. the way by  which  zooming  behaves  with  respect  to  horizontal  and
              vertical  directions.  Mode  =  0 means that no synchronizations are made, mode = 1 means that the
              zoom factors are always made to be equal, mode = 2 (the more subtle one) means that the horizontal
              and vertical zoom factors are adjusted so that the region located near the central  point  of  the
              zoomed  area  will  be  conformal  to  its  actual  geometry  on Earth, i.e. will not appear to be
              distorted horizontally or vertically.  This won't be true elsewhere,  though,  especially  if  the
              zoomed area is large.

       <b>-zoomsync</b>
              When the option is set, the zoom window will open in synchronization mode: any zooming action made
              from the main map or from the zoom window will take place as the mouse button is released (or as a
              key is pressed).  This is the default when the zoom window has not been opened (synchronization is
              automatically set).

       <b>-nozoomsync</b>
              When  set,  the  zoom  window  will open in non-synchro mode. Synchronizing the zoom will still be
              possible, though, by clicking on the "Synchro" button. By default, synchronization does not  occur
              when the zoom window is opened, unless option -zoomsync has been set.

       <b>-mapmode</b> <b>*</b> <b>(single</b> <b>character</b> <b>=</b> <b>C,</b> <b>D,</b> <b>E,</b> <b>L</b> <b>or</b> <b>S)</b>
              Start  the  map  functions  in  mode (C)oordinates, (D)istances, hour (E)xtension, (L)egal time or
              (S)olar time respectively. Any other specification is ignored. Default is legal time mode.

       <b>-placement</b> <u>&lt;choice&gt;</u> <u>(random,</u><b>fixed,</b><u>center,</u><b>NW,</b><u>NE,</u><b>SW,</b><u>SE)</u>
              Specify whether commuting between clock and map windows should proceed with letting the the window
              centers, respectively, the NW, NE, SW, SE corners fixed,  or  rather  whether  it  should  operate
              randomly, or through user defined placement. Default is NW placement.

       <b>-placementshift</b> <u>x</u> <u>y</u>
              Relative  displacement  &lt;clock  window&gt;  --&gt; &lt;map window&gt;, to apply with respect to the -placement
              specification. If placement is NW, then the NW window corner will move by (x,y) pixels. Default is
              (0,0), i.e.  no modification to apply to the -placement specification.

       <b>-extrawidth</b> <u>value</u>
              When using the 'enlarge window' command specified by key '&gt;', the width of the full X  display  is
              used,  minus  some  default width equal to 10 pixels.  This is enough the accommodate the width of
              window borders of most window managers. In case it is not, -extrawidth  &lt;value&gt;  can  be  used  to
              change this setting.

       <b>-clockgeom</b> <u>(width)x(height)+(x</u><b>coord)+(y</b><u>coord)</u>
              Specify  the  geometry  of  the  clock  window, i.e. its size and position (absolute position with
              respect to the left upper corner of the screen).

       <b>-mapgeom</b> <u>(width)x(height)+(x</u><b>coord)+(y</b><u>coord)</u>
              Specify the geometry of the map window, i.e. its size and position (absolute position with respect
              to the left upper corner of the screen).

       <b>-menugeom</b> <u>+(x</u><b>coord)+(y</b><u>coord)</u>
              Specify the relative position (x = horizontal shift, y = vertical shift) of the menu  window  with
              respect to the main window, starting from the bottom edge of the main window (from its top edge in
              case  of  SW  or  SE  placements, see above). The y value may need an adjustment, according to the
              height of the title bar allocated by the window manager, if any.  In the case of the menu  window,
              width and height solely depend on the menufont, and therefore any given specification of width and
              height is ignored. The default relative position is x = 0, y = 30.

       <b>-selgeom</b> <u>(width)x(height)+(x</u><b>coord)+(y</b><u>coord)</u>
              Specify  the  geometry  of the selector window. The position specification is relative to the main
              window (or to the menu, when the  menu  is  raised).   See  above  option  -menugeom  for  further
              explanations. The default geometry of the selector window is 600x180+0+30.

       <b>-zoomgeom</b> <u>(width)x(height)+(x</u><b>coord)+(y</b><u>coord)</u>
              Specify the geometry of the zoom window. The position specification is relative to the main window
              (or  to  the menu, when the menu is raised).  See above option -menugeom for further explanations.
              The default geometry of the zoom window is 500x320+0+30.

       <b>-optiongeom</b> <u>(width)x(height)+(x</u><b>coord)+(y</b><u>coord)</u>
              Specify the geometry of the option window. The position specification  is  relative  to  the  main
              window  (or  to  the  menu,  when  the  menu  is  raised).  See above option -menugeom for further
              explanations. The height specification depends solely on the selected menufont  and  is  therefore
              ignored. The default geometry of the option window is 630x80+0+30.

       <b>-urbangeom</b> <u>+(x</u><b>coord)+(y</b><u>coord)</u>
              Specify  the relative position (x = horizontal shift, y = vertical shift) of the urban window with
              respect to the main window (or to the menu, when the menu is raised). See above  option  -menugeom
              for further explanations.

       <b>-auxilgeom</b> <u>+(x</u><b>coord)+(y</b><u>coord)</u>
              Specify  the relative position (x = horizontal shift, y = vertical shift) of the auxiliary windows
              (menu, zoom, selector, option). All relative displacements are set to (x,y).

       <b>-mag</b> <u>value</u>
              Rescale the image by a magnification factor equal to &lt;value&gt;, which must be at least equal to 1.0.
              This means that the window only shows a fraction of the entire map namely, 1/&lt;value&gt; x  1/&lt;value&gt;.
              Default value is 1.0.

       <b>-magx</b> <u>value</u>
              Same as for the -mag option, but only the x direction (width) is rescaled.  Default value for magx
              is 1.0.

       <b>-magy</b> <u>value</u>
              Same  as  for  the  -mag option, but only the y direction (height) is rescaled.  Default value for
              magy is 1.0.

       <b>-dx</b> <u>value</u> <u>(degrees)</u>
              Options -dx and -dy allow one to set the longitude, respectively the  latitude,  of  the  city  or
              location  at  which  the  zoom  area  should  be centered.  The values should be given in degrees.
              Default (dx,dy) is (0.0,0.0).

       <b>-dy</b> <u>value</u> <u>(degrees)</u>
              See -dx above.

       <b>-coastlines</b>
              In the builtin vector map, generate coast lines without filling the land areas.

       <b>-contour</b>
              As before, but use a smart algorithm which eliminates lines, especially at lower  resolutions  (in
              case  the  coasts  are  very  irregular,  some  parts  may disappear but the overall picture looks
              sharper).

       <b>-landfill</b>
              In the builtin vector map, fill the land areas without generating coast lines.

       <b>-fillmode</b> <u>0,1,2</u>
              Fillmode=0 is equivalent to -coastlines, fillmode=1 is equivalent to -contour, and  fillmode=2  is
              equivalent to -landfill.

       <b>-dottedlines</b>
              Use dotted lines to represent meridians and parallels.

       <b>-plainlines</b>
              Use plain lines to represent meridians and parallels.

       <b>-bottomline</b>
              Draw  a  line  at  the bottom of the map, to separate the map from the text strip showing time and
              coordinates.

       <b>-nobottomline</b>
              Don't draw the bottom line. This is the default.

       <b>-command</b> <u>string</u>
              Specify an external action or program that will be called through keyboard shortcut  'x'.  Default
              is empty command.

       <b>-helpcommand</b> <u>string</u>
              Specify  an  external  action  or program that will be called through keyboard shortcut double 'h'
              (call help). Default is "xterm -fn 9x15 -cr green -ms red -e man sunclock &amp;".

       <b>-jump</b> <u>number[unit]</u> <u>(where</u> <u>unit=s,m,h,d,M,Y)</u>
              Number of seconds (respectively minutes, hour, days, Months, Years) by which the current date  and
              time  should  be  shifted.  No blank space should separate the number and its unit. If the unit is
              absent, the number is understood to be expressed by default in seconds.  Useful  to  get  sunclock
              display information on earlier or later epochs.

       <b>-progress</b> <u>number[unit]</u> <u>(where</u> <u>unit=s,m,h,d,M,Y)</u>
              Number  of seconds (respectively minutes, hour, days, Months, Years) by which the time progression
              should operate. No blank space should separate the number and its unit. If the unit is absent, the
              number is understood to be expressed by default in seconds. Useful to  get  sunclock  progress  by
              other  steps than the predefined ones (by default the steps cycle between the values 1 mn, 1 hour,
              1 day, 7 days, 30 days).

       <b>-rootdx</b> <u>value</u> <u>(between</u> <u>0.0</u> <u>and</u> <u>1.0)</u>
              Options -rootdx and -rootdy allow one to set the position where the sunclock map is copied on  the
              root  window  in  rootwindow  or screensaver modes. '-rootdx 0.0' means on the left side, '-rootdx
              1.0' on the right side, '-rootdy 0.0' means at the top, '-rootdy 1.0' at the bottom  of  the  root
              window. Default is 0.5 for both values, i.e. a centered map.

       <b>-rootdy</b> <u>value</u> <u>(degrees)</u>
              See -rootdx above.

       <b>-fixedrootpos</b>
              Use  the above rootdx and rootdy values to fix the position of the map on the root window. This is
              the default unless -screensaver has been specified.

       <b>-randomrootpos</b>
              Instead of using the above rootdx and rootdy values to fix the position of the  map  on  the  root
              window,  just  use a random position instead.  This is the default in case the -screensaver option
              has been set.

       <b>-screensaver</b>
              Start sunclock in screensaver mode (no window nor any GUI controls are available in that case, and
              the only way to terminate the program is to kill it explicitly).

       <b>-noscreensaver</b>
              Do not start sunclock in screensaver mode. This is the default.

       <b>-rootperiod</b> <u>value</u> <u>(in</u> <u>seconds,</u> <u>between</u> <u>1</u> <u>and</u> <u>120</u> <u>sec)</u>
              Set the period for refreshing the root window. Default is 30 seconds.  This takes effect only when
              writing the map onto the root window is active (strike twice on '[' or hit the relevant box in the
              Option window).  Writing onto the root window is disabled by using the ']' key.

       <b>-animation</b>
              Start the animation mode right away when sunclock is launched.

       <b>-noanimation</b>
              Don't start the animation mode when sunclock is launched -  this  is  the  default.  Sunclock  can
              anyway switch between the animation/noanimation modes by typing key ' (apostrophe) at runtime.

       <b>-animateperiod</b> <u>value</u> <u>(in</u> <u>seconds,</u> <u>between</u> <u>0</u> <u>and</u> <u>5</u> <u>sec)</u>
              Set  the  period for animating the map. Default is 0 seconds, which means that images are switched
              as fast as sunclock can compute them. Otherwise time is shifted by the current progress value  (as
              set  by  the  -progess option) after waiting the number of seconds prescribed by the animateperiod
              value.  This takes effect only when the animation is active (strike  on  the  '  key  or  hit  the
              relevant box in the Option window).

       <b>-addcity</b> <u>size|name|latitude|longitude|timezone</u>

       where  name  is  the  ascii  name  of  the place to be shown on the map.  The first argument "size" is an
       nonnegative integer meant to indicate the size of the city (1: major city, 2:  important  city,  3:  less
       important  city,  ...).  The  argument  "size"  can  also  be  set  to  0,  with the effect of hiding the
       corresponding city, while keeping in memory all of its other parameters. The city can then be shown again
       with Latitude and longitude are floating point numbers representing  the  geographical  location  of  the
       place.  Western  longitudes and southern latitudes should be entered as negative numbers. timezone is the
       name of the timezone that the place is in. This should be the name of a  file  under  <a href="file:/usr/share/zoneinfo">/usr/share/zoneinfo</a>
       (or whatever directory is used on your system), incorrect timezones cause the clock to display GMT. It is
       also  possible  to  reference  a  file  in  a  directory  relative  to  <a href="file:/usr/share/zoneinfo">/usr/share/zoneinfo</a>  for  example
       Canada/Eastern instead of EST5EDT.

       <b>-city</b> <u>name</u> <u>(name|lat|lon)</u>
              Initialize program so as to display data of city 'name', respectively  (name,  with  latitude  and
              longitude  specified).  This  becomes  effective only if the above mentioned city is listed in the
              systemwide RC file Sunclockrc or in the user's private <a href="file:~/.sunclockrc.">~/.sunclockrc.</a> The operating mode is set to
              Coordinates mode.

       <b>-position</b> <u>latitude|longitude</u>
              Initialize program so as to display  data  of  the  position  specified  by  two  coordinates  (in
              degrees).  The  operating  mode  is  set to Solar time mode.  Notice that with a vertical bar | (a
              blank space is also admitted instead of a |).

       <b>-addcity</b> <u>size|name|lat|lon|tz</u>
              Adds a city in the list of cities to be displayed on the map. They must be defined  by  exactly  5
              parameters:  size,  name,  latitude,  longitude,  timezone,  in  this order, with parameters being
              separated by a vertical bar |. Blank characters may appear in the name if double quotes  are  used
              to  mark  the  group  of  parameters  (but  there  shouldn't  be any blank characters in the other
              parameters). In the RC config file, blank characters should be replaced by the octal character 037
              (i.e. Ctrl-Q Ctrl-_ within emacs).

       <b>-removecity</b> <u>name</u> <u>(name|lat|lon)</u>
              Removes name (respectively name|lat|lon) from the list of cities to be displayed. Same remarks  as
              above for blank characters.

       <b>-citycategories</b> <u>value</u>
              Specifies  the  maximal  number of city categories: categories range from 1 (highest catgory, i.e.
              major city) to some maximum number. The option -citycategories specifies that maximum  number.  It
              can only be used at start-up, not at runtime. The default value is 5.

       <b>-spotsizes</b> <u>s1|s2|s3|...</u> <u>(0&lt;=si&lt;=5,</u> <u>1&lt;=i&lt;=citycategories)</u>
              With  this  setting,  major  cities  (category  1)  will  be represented by the symbol of size s1,
              category 2 cities by the symbol off size s2, etc.  The default  setting  is  -spotsize  1|2|3|4|5.
              Assigning  size  si=0  means  that  the  corresponding  category  of  cities  (rank i) will not be
              displayed.  If there are less data than the number of city categories (5  by  default),  the  last
              given  data  is  repeated  as many times as needed, e.g.  -spotsizes 2 is equivalent to -spotsizes
              2|2|2|2|2.  Example: specifying -spotsizes 0|2|0|3|0 will let appear only city categories 2 and 4,
              but those of category 4 will appear with the symbol normally allocated to cities  of  category  3.
              This is useful in combination with the option -sizelimits (see below).

       <b>-sizelimits</b> <u>w1|w2|w3|...</u>
              (wi  = zoom width values, 1&lt;=i&lt;=citycategories) With this setting, cities of rank i=1,2,3,... will
              appear if (and only if) the width of the zoomed map is at least equal to wi (as it would appear if
              the Earth would be entirely displayed...) . The default is  0|580|2500|6000|12000  (no  constraint
              for  major  cities,  rank  4  cities  appear only if the width is at least 6000 pixels, e.g. if an
              original window of width 800, say, has  been  applied  a  zoom  at  least  equal  to  7.5).   Thus
              -sizelimits  0  is  equivalent  to  -sizelimits  0|0|0|0|0,  -sizelimits  0|400  is  equivalent to
              -sizelimits 0|400|400|400|400.

       <b>-shading</b> <u>mode=0,1,2,3,4,5</u>
              Start sunclock with the specified shading mode. Mode 0 means that the night area is not displayed.
              In higher modes, the night area is displayed, with increasingly sophisticated shading  algorithms.
              Mode  1  stands  for  no  shading  (i.e. just bright and dark colors are shown). Mode 2 shades the
              terminator area -- the area in which the sun is partially hidden by the horizon. Mode 3 shades the
              region in which there is  still  substantial  luminosity  left  after  sunset  (depending  on  the
              diffusion  parameter  below).   Default  is  3˚  below horizon. Mode 4 additionally represents the
              luminosity values in all parts of  the  illuminated  area.  Mode  5  represents  the  gradient  of
              luminosity  from  the  brightest  area (facing the sun) to the darkest area (opposite to the sun);
              this has nothing to do, though, with the actual luminosity values.

       <b>-nonight</b>
              Start sunclock with the night region not drawn. This is equivalent to -shading 0.

       <b>-night</b> Start sunclock with the night region in plain shading mode. This is equivalent to -shading 1.

       <b>-terminator</b>
              Equivalent to -shading 2

       <b>-twilight</b>
              Equivalent to -shading 3

       <b>-luminosity</b>
              Equivalent to -shading 4

       <b>-lightgradient</b>
              Equivalent to -shading 5

       <b>-diffusion</b> <u>value</u> <u>(degrees)</u>
              Sets the amplitude of the area in which diffusion of light in the atmosphere is  still  sufficient
              to keep some luminosity after sunset.  Default is 3 degrees.

       <b>-refraction</b> <u>value</u> <u>(degrees)</u>
              Sets  the value of the refraction angle for tangential sun rays at sunset.  This is related to the
              fact that the sun sometimes looks bigger at  sunset.   Changing  the  refraction  degree  slightly
              affects the computation of sunrise and sunset times. Default is 0.1 degree.

       <b>-darkness</b> <u>value</u> <u>(in</u> <u>the</u> <u>range</u> <u>0.0</u> <u>...</u> <u>1.0)</u>
              Sets  the  contrast between day and night areas. A 0.0 value means that the night area will not be
              distinguishable from day, while 1.0 means that it will be completely black. Default is 0.5.

       <b>-colorscale</b> <u>value</u> <u>(integer</u> <u>in</u> <u>the</u> <u>range</u> <u>1</u> <u>...</u> <u>256)</u>
              Sets the number of color subdvisions which will be in use for  producing  shading,  that  is,  the
              number of colors ranging from bright colors (day) to dark colors (night). Default is 16.

       <b>-meridianmode</b> <b>mode=0,1,2,3</b>
              Start  sunclock  with  meridians  displayed  or not, according to the mode, mode=0 : no meridians,
              mode=1 : meridians drawn, mode=2 : meridians drawn with labels at the bottom, mode=3  :  meridians
              drawn with labels at the top.  The default mode is 0 (no meridians).

       <b>-parallelmode</b> <b>mode=0,1,2,3</b>
              Start  sunclock  with  parallels  displayed  or not, according to the mode, mode=0 : no parallels,

              parallels drawn with labels at the right hand side. The default mode is 0 (no parallels).

       <b>-meridianspacing</b> <b>value</b> <b>(degree)</b>
              Specify how many degrees (or fractions of degree) should separate meridians drawn on the map.

       <b>-parallelspacing</b> <b>value</b> <b>(degree)</b>
              Specify how many degrees (or fractions of degree) should separate parallels drawn on the map.

       <b>-citymode</b> <b>mode=0,1,2,3</b>
              Start  sunclock  with cities displayed or not, according to the mode, mode=0 : no cities, mode=1 :
              cities drawn, mode=2  :  cities  drawn  with  their  names,  mode=3  :  cities  drawn  with  their
              coordinates.  The default mode is 1 (cities shown without names or coordinates).

       <b>-tropics</b>
              Start sunclock with tropics and arctic circles displayed (by default, they aren't).

       <b>-sun</b>   Start sunclock with the Sun position displayed (by default, it is).

       <b>-moon</b>  Start sunclock with the Moon position displayed (by default, it is).

       <b>-notropics</b> <b>-nosun</b> <b>-nomoon</b>
              These options just negate the above ones.

       <b>-objectmode</b> <u>mode=0,1,2</u>
              Mode=0  stands  for  no objects (Sun, Moon) at all, mode=1 for objects just drawn by their symbol,
              mode=2 for objects drawn with their  symbol  and  coordinates  in  decimal  degrees  (or  degrees,
              minutes, seconds, using the ˚ key switch).

       <b>-reformat</b>
              This  option  only  produces  an  effect when a *.vmf file is loaded. The file is then reformatted
              according to the allowed syntax and normal line length, and printed  to  stdout.  To  capture  the
              aoutput, one should redirect the standard output to a file (with a '&gt; file' as usual).

       <b>-vmfcolors</b> <u>color1|color2|color3...</u>
              Redefine  the  list  of colors to be used in the .vmf file. This option has no effect when loading
              files with other formats. Default is NULL string (so that the  default  colors  are  loaded).  The
              string  "|" is also considered to be a void string and can be used in the option widget to enforce
              default colors back.

       <b>-vmfrange</b> <u>a|b|c|d</u>
              Define the range in which point coordinates (latitude, longitude) should vary in the *.vmf  files,
              default  is  -90|90|-180|180.  This  option  can be useful in combination with -reformat to make a
              linear change of coordinates in a *.vmf file.

       <b>-vmcoordformat</b> <u>format</u>
              Set the format for the output of double values produced via  the  -reformat  option.  The  default
              format  is  "%7.3f  %8.3f" (format for latitude and longitude, respectively), unless the -vmfrange
              has been modified, in which case the default becomes "%g %g" (from the POSIX  rules,  this  stands
              for 6 significant digits in any position).

       <b>-vmfflags</b> <u>number</u>
              Sets the flags (integer value) for a *.vmf file. Each bit is a distinct flag. The zeroth order bit
              (i.e. &amp;1) determines whether features which have their own zeroth bit set are to be drawn in clock
              window  mode (if the zeroth bit is not set, the feature will always be drawn). Other bits are used
              to control whether given features are to be drawn or not. For instance setting  -vmfflags  2  with
              timezones.vmf  will let the timezone regions appear, while -vmfflags 6 will also show the timezone
              boundary lines. (Only bits 0, 1, 2 are currently used in timezones.vmf).

       <b>-setcolor</b> <u>field|color</u>
              Sets the color of a specified field in the sunclock widgets.  The color can be  specified  as  any
              litteral  value  (red,  yellow,  etc..., as defined in the resource file rgb.txt), or as a 6 digit
              hexadecimal value #ijklmn, or even 12 digits (for 48 bits displays!) The field can take any of the
              following values (between parentheses, the meaning and default value):

       clockbg (clock background color; White)

       clockfg (clock foreground color; Black)

       <u>sunclock</u> calculates the position of the Sun using the algorithm in chapter 18 of:

       <u>Astronomical</u> <u>Formulae</u> <u>for</u> <u>Calculators</u> by Jean Meeus, Third Edition, Richmond: Willmann-Bell, 1985.

       and  projects  the  illuminated  area  onto  the  map  image  by an equidistributed (latitude, longitude)
       cylindrical projection.  The Sun's position is calculated to better than one arc-second in accuracy.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Sunclock makes intensive use of pointers and memory allocation/deallocation, so memory leaks might  still
       be  possible  under  some  circumstances.  However, the program has been thoroughly debugged, and crashes
       seem to be rather rare. As new features are introduced, older ones may become broken during the phase  of
       development :-(

       The  illuminated area shown is the area which would be sunlit if the Earth atmosphere would be absolutely
       uniform.  The actual illuminated area may depend on  weather,  temperature,  atmospheric  refraction  and
       diffusion, etc.

</pre><h4><b>AUTHORS</b></h4><pre>
       John  Walker,  Autodesk,  Inc.,  &lt;<a href="mailto:kelvin@acad.uu.NET">kelvin@acad.uu.NET</a>&gt;,  wrote  the  original  Suntools program from which
       sunclock is derived.

       John  Mackin,  Basser  Department  of  Computer  Science,  University  of  Sydney,   Sydney,   Australia,
       &lt;<a href="mailto:john@cs.su.oz.AU">john@cs.su.oz.AU</a>&gt;, wrote the X11 version out of Suntools.

       Stephen  Martin,  Fujitsu  Systems  Business of Canada, <a href="mailto:smartin@fujitsu.ca">smartin@fujitsu.ca</a>, added support for interactive
       map.

       Jean-Pierre Demailly, Université de Grenoble  I,  <a href="mailto:demailly@fourier.ujf-grenoble.fr">demailly@fourier.ujf-grenoble.fr</a>  worked  out  versions
       3.xx,  which  add  many new major features (loading maps, shading, zoom functionalities, configuration of
       options on the fly at runtime, through a point and click GUI interface).
