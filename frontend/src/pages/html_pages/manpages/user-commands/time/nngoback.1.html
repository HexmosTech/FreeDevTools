</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       nngoback - make news articles unread on a day-by-day basis (nn)

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>nngoback</b> [ -<b>NQvi</b> ] [-<b>d</b>] <u>days</u> [ <u>group</u> ]...

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>nngoback</u>  will  rewind  the  .newsrc record file of <b><a href="../man1/nn.1.html">nn</a></b>(1) one or more <u>days</u>.  It can be used to rewind all
       groups, or only a specified set of <u>groups</u>.  In other words, <u>nngoback</u> can mark news  articles  which  have
       arrived on the system during the last <u>days</u> days unread.

       Only  <u>subscribed</u>  groups that occur in the current presentation sequence are rewound.  That means that if
       no <u>group</u> arguments are specified, all groups occurring in the sequence defined in the <u>init</u> file  will  be
       rewound.  Otherwise, only the groups specified on the argument line will be rewound.

       When a group is rewound, the information about selections, partially read digests etc. are discarded.  It
       will print notifications about this unless the -<b>Q</b> (quiet) option is used.

       If  the  -<b>i</b>  (interactive)  option  is  specified, <u>nngoback</u> will report for each how many articles <u>can</u> <u>be</u>
       marked unread, and ask for confirmation before going back in that group.

       If the -<b>v</b> (verbose) option is specified, <u>nngoback</u> will report how many articles are marked unread.

       If the -<b>N</b> (no-update) option is specified, <u>nngoback</u> will perform the entire  goback  operation,  but  not
       update the .newsrc file.

       If  you are not up-to-date with your news reading, you can also use <b>nngoback</b> to catch up to only have the
       last few days of news waiting to be read in the following way:
            nn -a0
            nngoback 3
       The <b>nn</b> command will mark all articles in all groups as read (answer <u>all</u> to the catch-up  question.)   The
       following <b>nngoback</b> will then make the last three days of news unread again.

       Examples:

       nngoback 0
              Mark the articles which have arrived today as unread.

       nngoback 1
              Mark the articles which have arrived yesterday and today as unread.

       nngoback 6
              Mark the articles which have arrived during the last week as unread.

       You cannot go more than 14 days back with <u>nngoback</u>.  (You can change this limit as described below.)

</pre><h4><b>THE</b> <b>BACK_ACT</b> <b>DAEMON</b></h4><pre>
       It  is a prerequisite for the use of <u>nngoback</u> that the script <b>back_act</b> is executed at an appropriate time
       once (and only once) every day.  Preferably this is done by <b>cron</b> right  before  the  bacth  of  news  for
       `today' is received.  <b>back_act</b> will maintain copies of the active file for the last 14 days.

       Optionally,  the  <b>back_act</b>  program accepts a single numerical argument specifying how many copies of the
       active file it should maintain.  This is useful if news is expired after 7 days, in  which  case  keeping
       more than 7 days of active file copies is wasteful.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <a href="file:~/.newsrc">~/.newsrc</a>            The record of read articles.
       <a href="file:~/.newsrc.goback">~/.newsrc.goback</a>     The original rc file before goback.
       $db/active.<u>N</u>         The <u>N</u> days `old' active file.
       $master/back_act     Script run by cron to maintain old active files.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>nngoback</b>  does  not  check  the  age of the `old' active files; it will blindly believe that active.0 was
       created today, and that active.7 is really seven days old!  Therefore, the <u>back_act</u> script should be  run
       once and only once every day for <u>nngoback</u> to work properly.

       The days are counted relative to the time the active files were copied.
