</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       perf-list - List all symbolic event types

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>perf</u> <u>list</u> [&lt;options&gt;]
                   [hw|sw|cache|tracepoint|pmu|sdt|metric|metricgroup|event_glob]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This command displays the symbolic event types which can be selected in the various perf commands with
       the -e option.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       -d, --desc
           Print extra event descriptions. (default)

       --no-desc
           Don’t print descriptions.

       -v, --long-desc
           Print longer event descriptions.

       --debug
           Enable debugging output.

       --details
           Print how named events are resolved internally into perf events, and also any extra expressions
           computed by perf stat.

       --deprecated
           Print deprecated events. By default the deprecated events are hidden.

       --unit
           Print PMU events and metrics limited to the specific PMU name. (e.g. --unit cpu, --unit msr, --unit
           cpu_core, --unit cpu_atom)

       -j, --json
           Output in JSON format.

       -o, --output=
           Output file name. By default output is written to stdout.

</pre><h4><b>EVENT</b> <b>MODIFIERS</b></h4><pre>
       Events can optionally have a modifier by appending a colon and one or more modifiers. Modifiers allow the
       user to restrict the events to be counted. The following modifiers exist:

           u - user-space counting
           k - kernel counting
           h - hypervisor counting
           I - non idle counting
           G - guest counting (in KVM guests)
           H - host counting (not in KVM guests)
           p - precise level
           P - use maximum detected precise level
           S - read sample value (PERF_SAMPLE_READ)
           D - pin the event to the PMU
           W - group is weak and will fallback to non-group if not schedulable,
           e - group or event are exclusive and do not share the PMU
           b - use BPF aggregration (see perf stat --bpf-counters)
           R - retire latency value of the event

       The <u>p</u> modifier can be used for specifying how precise the instruction address should be. The <u>p</u> modifier
       can be specified multiple times:

           0 - SAMPLE_IP can have arbitrary skid
           1 - SAMPLE_IP must have constant skid
           2 - SAMPLE_IP requested to have 0 skid
           3 - SAMPLE_IP must have 0 skid, or uses randomization to avoid
               sample shadowing effects.

       For Intel systems precise event sampling is implemented with PEBS which supports up to precise-level 2,
       and precise level 3 for some special cases

       On AMD systems it is implemented using IBS OP (up to precise-level 2). Unlike Intel PEBS which provides
       levels of precision, AMD core pmu is inherently non-precise and IBS is inherently precise. (i.e.
       ibs_op//, ibs_op//p, ibs_op//pp and ibs_op//ppp are all same). The precise modifier works with event
       types 0x76 (cpu-cycles, CPU clocks not halted) and 0xC1 (micro-ops retired). Both events map to IBS
       execution sampling (IBS op) with the IBS Op Counter Control bit (IbsOpCntCtl) set respectively (see the
       Core Complex (CCX) → Processor x86 Core → Instruction Based Sampling (IBS) section of the [AMD Processor
       Programming Reference (PPR)] relevant to the family, model and stepping of the processor being used).

       Manual Volume 2: System Programming, 13.3 Instruction-Based Sampling). Examples to use IBS:

           perf record -a -e cpu-cycles:p ...    # use ibs op counting cycles
           perf record -a -e r076:p ...          # same as -e cpu-cycles:p
           perf record -a -e r0C1:p ...          # use ibs op counting micro-ops

</pre><h4><b>RAW</b> <b>HARDWARE</b> <b>EVENT</b> <b>DESCRIPTOR</b></h4><pre>
       Even when an event is not available in a symbolic form within perf right now, it can be encoded in a per
       processor specific way.

       For instance on x86 CPUs, N is a hexadecimal value that represents the raw register encoding with the
       layout of IA32_PERFEVTSELx MSRs (see [Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual
       Volume 3B: System Programming Guide] Figure 30-1 Layout of IA32_PERFEVTSELx MSRs) or AMD’s PERF_CTL MSRs
       (see the Core Complex (CCX) → Processor x86 Core → MSR Registers section of the [AMD Processor
       Programming Reference (PPR)] relevant to the family, model and stepping of the processor being used).

       Note: Only the following bit fields can be set in x86 counter registers: event, umask, edge, inv, cmask.
       Esp. guest/host only and OS/user mode flags must be setup using EVENT MODIFIERS.

       Example:

       If the Intel docs for a QM720 Core i7 describe an event as:

           Event  Umask  Event Mask
           Num.   Value  Mnemonic    Description                        Comment

           A8H      01H  LSD.UOPS    Counts the number of micro-ops     Use cmask=1 and
                                     delivered by loop stream detector  invert to count
                                                                        cycles

       raw encoding of 0x1A8 can be used:

           perf stat -e r1a8 -a sleep 1
           perf record -e r1a8 ...

       It’s also possible to use pmu syntax:

           perf record -e r1a8 -a sleep 1
           perf record -e cpu/r1a8/ ...
           perf record -e cpu/r0x1a8/ ...

       Some processors, like those from AMD, support event codes and unit masks larger than a byte. In such
       cases, the bits corresponding to the event configuration parameters can be seen with:

           cat <a href="file:/sys/bus/event_source/devices/">/sys/bus/event_source/devices/</a>&lt;pmu&gt;/format/&lt;config&gt;

       Example:

       If the AMD docs for an EPYC 7713 processor describe an event as:

           Event  Umask  Event Mask
           Num.   Value  Mnemonic                        Description

           28FH     03H  op_cache_hit_miss.op_cache_hit  Counts Op Cache micro-tag
                                                         hit events.

       raw encoding of 0x0328F cannot be used since the upper nibble of the EventSelect bits have to be
       specified via bits 32-35 as can be seen with:

           cat <a href="file:/sys/bus/event_source/devices/cpu/format/event">/sys/bus/event_source/devices/cpu/format/event</a>

       raw encoding of 0x20000038F should be used instead:

           perf stat -e r20000038f -a sleep 1
           perf record -e r20000038f ...

       It’s also possible to use pmu syntax:

           perf record -e r20000038f -a sleep 1
           perf record -e cpu/r20000038f/ ...
           perf record -e cpu/r0x20000038f/ ...

       You should refer to the processor specific documentation for getting these details. Some of them are
       referenced in the SEE ALSO section below.

</pre><h4><b>ARBITRARY</b> <b>PMUS</b></h4><pre>
       perf also supports an extended syntax for specifying raw parameters to PMUs. Using this typically
       requires looking up the specific event in the CPU vendor specific documentation.

       The available PMUs and their raw parameters can be listed with

           ls <a href="file:/sys/bus/event_source/devices/">/sys/bus/event_source/devices/</a>*/format

       For example the raw event "LSD.UOPS" core pmu event above could be specified as

           perf stat -e cpu/event=0xa8,umask=0x1,name=LSD.UOPS_CYCLES,cmask=0x1/ ...

           or using extended name syntax

           perf stat -e cpu/event=0xa8,umask=0x1,cmask=0x1,name=\'LSD.UOPS_CYCLES:cmask=0x1\'/ ...

</pre><h4><b>PER</b> <b>SOCKET</b> <b>PMUS</b></h4><pre>
       Some PMUs are not associated with a core, but with a whole CPU socket. Events on these PMUs generally
       cannot be sampled, but only counted globally with perf stat -a. They can be bound to one logical CPU, but
       will measure all the CPUs in the same socket.

       This example measures memory bandwidth every second on the first memory controller on socket 0 of a Intel
       Xeon system

           perf stat -C 0 -a uncore_imc_0/cas_count_read/,uncore_imc_0/cas_count_write/ -I 1000 ...

       Each memory controller has its own PMU. Measuring the complete system bandwidth would require specifying
       all imc PMUs (see perf list output), and adding the values together. To simplify creation of multiple
       events, prefix and glob matching is supported in the PMU name, and the prefix <u>uncore</u><b>_</b> is also ignored
       when performing the match. So the command above can be expanded to all memory controllers by using the
       syntaxes:

           perf stat -C 0 -a imc/cas_count_read/,imc/cas_count_write/ -I 1000 ...
           perf stat -C 0 -a *imc*/cas_count_read/,*imc*/cas_count_write/ -I 1000 ...

       This example measures the combined core power every second

           perf stat -I 1000 -e power/energy-cores/  -a

</pre><h4><b>ACCESS</b> <b>RESTRICTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       For non root users generally only context switched PMU events are available. This is normally only the
       events in the cpu PMU, the predefined events like cycles and instructions and some software events.

       Other PMUs and global measurements are normally root only. Some event qualifiers, such as "any", are also
       root only.

       This can be overridden by setting the kernel.perf_event_paranoid sysctl to -1, which allows non root to
       use these events.

       For accessing trace point events perf needs to have read access to <a href="file:/sys/kernel/tracing">/sys/kernel/tracing</a>, even when
       perf_event_paranoid is in a relaxed setting.

</pre><h4><b>TOOL/HWMON</b> <b>EVENTS</b></h4><pre>
       Some events don’t have an associated PMU instead reading values available to software without
       perf_event_open. As these events don’t support sampling they can only really be read by tools like perf
       stat.

       Tool events provide times and certain system parameters. Examples include duration_time, user_time,
       system_time and num_cpus_online.

       Hwmon events provide easy access to hwmon sysfs data typically in /sys/class/hwmon. This information
       includes temperatures, fan speeds and energy usage.

</pre><h4><b>TRACING</b></h4><pre>
       Some PMUs control advanced hardware tracing capabilities, such as Intel PT, that allows low overhead
       execution tracing. These are described in a separate intel-pt.txt document.

</pre><h4><b>PARAMETERIZED</b> <b>EVENTS</b></h4><pre>
       Some pmu events listed by <u>perf-list</u> will be displayed with <u>?</u> in them. For example:

           hv_gpci/dtbp_ptitc,phys_processor_idx=?/

       This means that when provided as an event, a value for <u>?</u> must also be supplied. For example:

           perf stat -C 0 -e 'hv_gpci/dtbp_ptitc,phys_processor_idx=0x2/' ...

       EVENT QUALIFIERS:

       It is also possible to add extra qualifiers to an event:

       percore:

       Sums up the event counts for all hardware threads in a core, e.g.:

           perf stat -e cpu/event=0,umask=0x3,percore=1/

</pre><h4><b>EVENT</b> <b>GROUPS</b></h4><pre>
       Perf supports time based multiplexing of events, when the number of events active exceeds the number of
       hardware performance counters. Multiplexing can cause measurement errors when the workload changes its
       execution profile.

       When metrics are computed using formulas from event counts, it is useful to ensure some events are always
       measured together as a group to minimize multiplexing errors. Event groups can be specified using { }.

           perf stat -e '{instructions,cycles}' ...

       The number of available performance counters depend on the CPU. A group cannot contain more events than
       available counters. For example Intel Core CPUs typically have four generic performance counters for the
       core, plus three fixed counters for instructions, cycles and ref-cycles. Some special events have
       restrictions on which counter they can schedule, and may not support multiple instances in a single
       group. When too many events are specified in the group some of them will not be measured.

       Globally pinned events can limit the number of counters available for other groups. On x86 systems, the
       NMI watchdog pins a counter by default. The nmi watchdog can be disabled as root with

           echo 0 &gt; <a href="file:/proc/sys/kernel/nmi_watchdog">/proc/sys/kernel/nmi_watchdog</a>

       Events from multiple different PMUs cannot be mixed in a group, with some exceptions for software events.

</pre><h4><b>LEADER</b> <b>SAMPLING</b></h4><pre>
       perf also supports group leader sampling using the :S specifier.

           perf record -e '{cycles,instructions}:S' ...
           perf report --group

       Normally all events in an event group sample, but with :S only the first event (the leader) samples, and
       it only reads the values of the other events in the group.

       However, in the case AUX area events (e.g. Intel PT or CoreSight), the AUX area event must be the leader,
       so then the second event samples, not the first.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Without options all known events will be listed.

       To limit the list use:

        1. <u>hw</u> or <u>hardware</u> to list hardware events such as cache-misses, etc.

        2. <u>sw</u> or <u>software</u> to list software events such as context switches, etc.

        3. <u>cache</u> or <u>hwcache</u> to list hardware cache events such as L1-dcache-loads, etc.

        4. <u>tracepoint</u> to list all tracepoint events, alternatively use <u>subsys_glob:event_glob</u> to filter by
           tracepoint subsystems such as sched, block, etc.

        5. <u>pmu</u> to print the kernel supplied PMU events.

        6. <u>sdt</u> to list all Statically Defined Tracepoint events.

        7. <u>metric</u> to list metrics

        8. <u>metricgroup</u> to list metricgroups with metrics.

        9. If none of the above is matched, it will apply the supplied glob to all events, printing the ones
           that match.

       10. As a last resort, it will do a substring search in all event names.

       One or more types can be used at the same time, listing the events for the types specified.

       Support raw format:

        1. <u>--raw-dump</u>, shows the raw-dump of all the events.

        2. <u>--raw-dump</u> <u>[hw|sw|cache|tracepoint|pmu|event_glob]</u>, shows the raw-dump of a certain kind of events.
