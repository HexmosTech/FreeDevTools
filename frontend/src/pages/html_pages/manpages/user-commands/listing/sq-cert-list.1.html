       sq cert list - List certificates and user IDs

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>sq</b> <b>cert</b> <b>list</b> [<u>OPTIONS</u>] <u>FINGERPRINT|KEYID|PATTERN</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       List certificates and user IDs.

       List  certificates  and  user  IDs that match a query, are usable, and can be authenticated.  By default,
       bindings (certificate and user ID pairs) must be fully authenticated.  If  no  certificates  or  bindings
       match a query, then the command returns a non-zero exit code.

       If  no  queries are provided, then all bindings that are usable, and can be authenticated are listed.  If
       there are no such bindings, the command still succeeds.

       By default, unusable certificates, i.e., those that are not valid according to the policy,  are  revoked,
       or  are  not  live, are skipped.  Likewise, user ID self signatures and certifications that are not valid
       according to the policy, and user IDs that are revoked are skipped.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Subcommand</b> <b>options</b>
       <b>--amount</b>=<u>AMOUNT</u>
              The required amount of trust

              120 indicates full authentication; values less than 120  indicate  partial  authentication.   When
              `--certification-network`  is  passed,  this defaults to 1200, i.e., this command tries to find 10
              paths.

       <b>--cert</b>=<u>FINGERPRINT|KEYID</u>
              List certificates with the specified fingerprint or key ID

              Note: fingerprints and key IDs are self-authenticating identifiers.  As such, a  certificate  with
              the  specified  fingerprint  or  key  ID  is  considered  authenticated;  no  user  IDs have to be
              authenticated.

       <b>--cert-domain</b>=<u>DOMAIN</u>
              List bindings with user IDs that contain an email address in the specified domain

              A user ID's domain is extracted from the email  address,  if  any,  and  is  normalized  by  doing
              puny-code normalization.

       <b>--cert-email</b>=<u>EMAIL</u>
              List bindings with user IDs that contain the specified email address

              Email  addresses  are  first  normalized by doing puny-code normalization on the domain, and lower
              casing the local part in the so-called empty locale.

       <b>--cert-grep</b>=<u>PATTERN</u>
              List bindings with a user ID that contains the pattern

              Performs a case-insensitive substring search.  Case-folding is done in the empty locale.

       <b>--cert-userid</b>=<u>USERID</u>
              List bindings with the specified user ID

              The user ID must match exactly.

       <b>--certification-network</b>
              Treats the network as a certification network

              Normally, the authentication machinery treats the  Web  of  Trust  network  as  an  authentication
              network  where  a certification only means that the binding is correct, not that the target should
              be treated as a trusted introducer.  In a certification network, the targets of certifications are
              treated as trusted introducers with infinite depth,  and  any  regular  expressions  are  ignored.
              Note:  The trust amount remains unchanged.  This is how most so-called PGP path-finding algorithms
              work.

       <b>--gossip</b>
              Treats all certificates as unreliable trust roots

              This option is useful for figuring out what others think about  a  certificate  (i.e.,  gossip  or
              hearsay).  In other words, this finds arbitrary paths to a particular certificate.

              Gossip  is  useful  in  helping  to  identify alternative ways to authenticate a certificate.  For
              instance, imagine Ed wants to  authenticate  Laura's  certificate,  but  asking  her  directly  is
              inconvenient.   Ed  discovers  that  Micah  has  certified  Laura's certificate, but Ed hasn't yet
              authenticated Micah's certificate.  If Ed is willing to rely on Micah as a trusted introducer, and
              authenticating Micah's certificate is easier than authenticating Laura's certificate, then Ed  has
              learned about an easier way to authenticate Laura's certificate.

              Stable since 1.1.0.

       <b>--show-paths</b>
              Show why a binding is authenticated

              By  default,  only a user ID and certificate binding's degree of authentication (a value between 0
              and 120) is shown.  This changes the output to also show how that value was  computed  by  showing
              the paths from the trust roots to the bindings.

       <b>--unusable</b>
              Show bindings that are unusable

              Normally,  unusable  certificates and bindings are not shown. This option considers bindings, even
              if they are not unusable, because they (or the  certificates)  are  not  valid  according  to  the
              policy, are revoked, or are not live.

              This  option  only  makes  sense  with  `--gossip`, because unusable bindings are still considered
              unauthenticated.

              Stable since 1.1.0.

        <u>FINGERPRINT|KEYID|PATTERN</u>
              List certs that match the pattern

              If the pattern appears to be a fingerprint or key ID, it is  treated  as  if  it  were  passed  to
              `--cert`,  which matches on the certificate's fingerprint.  Otherwise, it is treated as if it were
              passed to `--cert-grep`, which matches on user IDs.
