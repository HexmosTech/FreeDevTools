       render_expired - expires a list of map tiles so that they get re-rendered.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>render_expired</b> [<u>options</u>]<u>&lt;</u>expire.list

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This manual page documents briefly the <b>render_expired</b> command.

       <b>render_expired</b>  is  a helper utility that takes a list of map tiles from stdin and expires them such that
       they will get re-rendered.  Render_expired has three potential strategies of how to expire map tiles:  1)
       Render tiles directly: Render_expired can connect to the renderd socket and submit rendering requests for
       expired  tiles directly 2) Delete tiles: Render_expired can delete expired tiles from disk. The next time
       the tile then gets viewed it will get re-rendered, assuming a dynamic rendering setup  like  mod_tile  is
       installed  3)  Mark tiles as dirty: A dynamic tile rendering system like mod_tile decides if a tile needs
       re-rendering by comparing the timestamp of the tile with the time of the planet-import-complet timestamp.
       Render_expired can set the timestamp of a tile back many years, ensuring it is older than the  db  import
       time, thus causeing the tile to be considered dirty and in need for re-render.

       These  three  strategies  can be combined and applied at different zoom levels. E.g. Zoom level 17-18 get
       deleted, z11 - z16 get marked dirty and z6 - z10 get rendered directly.

       Render_expired takes a list of tiles from stdin which should be expired. The format of the  list  is  one
       tile per line specified as z/x/y.  1/0/1 1/1/1 1/0/0 1/1/0

       render_expired will automatically expand the list to cover the effected tiles at other zoom levels.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       This program follows the usual GNU command line syntax, with long options starting with two dashes (`-').
       A summary of options is included below.

       <b>-m</b>|--map=MAP
              Specify the style-sheet for which to expire tiles. The default is "default".

       <b>-s</b>|--socket=SOCKET|HOSTNAME:PORT
              Specify the location of the renderd socket or hostname and port to connect to.

       <b>-n</b>|--num-threads=N
              Specify  the  number  of  parallel  requests  to renderd. Should renderd have less threads active,
              requests will be queued. The default is 1.  default if <b>--append</b> is not specified.

       <b>-t</b>|--tile-dir=DIR
              Specify the base directory where the rendered tiles are. The default is '/var/cache/renderd/tiles'

       <b>-z</b>|--min-zoom=ZOOM
              Filter input to only render tiles greater or equal to this zoom level (default is 0)

       <b>-Z</b>|--max-zoom=ZOOM
              Filter input to only render tiles less than or equal to this zoom level (default is 18)

       <b>-d</b>|--delete-from=ZOOM
              When expiring tiles of ZOOM or higher, delete them instead of re-rendering (default is off)

       <b>-T</b>|--touch-from=ZOOM
              when expiring tiles of ZOOM or higher, touch them instead of re-rendering (default is off)

       --no-progress
              Disable display of progress messages (default is off)

       <b>-h</b>|--help
              Print out a help text for render_expired

       <b>-V</b>|--version
              Print out the version number for render_expired
