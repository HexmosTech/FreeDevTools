</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ftnchek</b>  (short  for  Fortran  checker)  is designed to detect certain errors in a Fortran program that a
       compiler usually does not.  <b>ftnchek</b> is not primarily intended to detect syntax errors.  Its purpose is to
       assist the user in finding semantic errors.  Semantic errors are legal in the Fortran  language  but  are
       wasteful or may cause incorrect operation.  For example, variables which are never used may indicate some
       omission  in the program; uninitialized variables contain garbage which may cause incorrect results to be
       calculated; and variables which are not declared may not have the intended type.  <b>ftnchek</b> is intended  to
       assist  users  in the debugging of their Fortran program.  It is not intended to catch all syntax errors.
       This is the function of the compiler.  Prior to using <b>ftnchek</b>, the user should verify  that  the  program
       compiles correctly.

       This  document  first  summarizes how to invoke <b>ftnchek</b>.  That section should be read before beginning to
       use <b>ftnchek</b>.  Later sections describe <b>ftnchek</b>'s options in more detail, give an example of its  use,  and
       explain  how  to  interpret  the  output.   The  final sections mention the limitations and known bugs in
       <b>ftnchek</b>.

</pre><h4><b>INVOKING</b> <b>FTNCHEK</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ftnchek</b> is invoked through a command of the form:

                                $ ftnchek [-option -option ...] filename [filename ...]

       The brackets indicate something which is optional.  The brackets themselves are not actually typed.  Here
       options are command-line switches or settings, which control the operation of the program and the  amount
       of information that will be printed out.  If no option is specified, the default action is to print error
       messages, warnings, and informational messages, but not the program listing or symbol tables.

       Each option begins with the '-' character.  (On VAX/VMS or MS-DOS systems you may use either '/' or '-'.)
       For the sake of conformity with an increasingly common convention, options can also begin with '--'.  The
       options are described at greater length in the next section.

       <b>ftnchek</b>  options  fall into two categories: switches, which are either true or false, and settings, which
       have a numeric or string value.  The name of a switch is prefixed by 'no' or 'no-' to turn it  off:  e.g.
       <b>-nopure</b> would turn off the warnings about impure functions. The 'no' prefix can also be used with numeric
       settings,  having  the  effect of turning off the corresponding warnings.  Settings that control lists of
       warnings have a special syntax discussed below.  Only the first 3  characters  of  an  option  name  (not
       counting the '-') need be provided.  A colon may be used in place of an equals sign for numeric or string
       setting assignments; however, we show only the equals sign form below.

       The  switches  and  settings  which  <b>ftnchek</b> currently recognizes are listed below.  For each option, the
       default is the value used if the option is not explicitly specified, while the turn-on is the value  used
       if the option is given without assigning it a value.

       <b>-arguments=</b><u>list</u>
              Control warnings about subprogram type and argument mismatches.  Default = turn-on = all.

       <b>-array=</b><u>list</u>
              Control warnings in checking array arguments of subprograms.  Default = turn-on = all.

       <b>-brief</b> Use shorter format for some error messages.  Default = no.

       <b>-calltree=</b><u>list</u>

              Default = none, turn-on = tree,prune,sort.

              If the <b>-mkhtml</b> option  is  invoked  <u>and</u>  tree  is  the  applied  calltree  option,  a  file  named
              CallTree.html, will be produced depicting the tree in HTML format.

       <b>-check</b> Perform checking.  Default = yes.

       <b>-columns=</b><u>num</u>
              Set maximum line length to <u>num</u> columns. (Beyond this is ignored.)  Turn-on = max = 132.  Default =

              Warn if external subprograms which are invoked are never defined.  Default = yes.

       <b>-f77=</b><u>list</u>
              Control specific warnings about supported extensions to the Fortran 77 Standard.  Default  = none,
              turn-on = all.

       <b>-f90=</b><u>list</u>
              Control specific warnings about supported extensions to the Fortran  77  Standard  that  were  not
              adopted as part of the Fortran 90 Standard.  Default  = none, turn-on = all.

       <b>-f95=</b><u>list</u>

              Define a directory to search for INCLUDE files before  searching  in  the  system-wide  directory.
              Cumulative.  Default = turn-on = none.

       <b>-intrinsic=</b><u>list</u>
              Control  treatment of nonstandard intrinsic functions.  Default = all except <b>vms</b> for Unix version,

       <b>-usage=</b><u>list</u>
              Control warnings about unused or uninitialized variables, common blocks, etc.  Default = turn-on =
              all.

       <b>-vcg</b>   Produce VCG format of call graph.

       <b>-version</b>
              Print version number.  Default = no.

       <b>-volatile</b>
              Assume COMMON  blocks  lose  definition  between  activations.   Default  =  no.  (Obsolete.   Use
              <b>-common=volatile</b> instead.)

       <b>-wordsize=</b><u>num</u>
              Set the default word size for numeric quantities to <u>num</u> bytes.  Default = turn-on = 4 bytes.

       <b>-wrap=</b><u>num</u>
              Set  output  column at which to wrap long error messages and warnings to the next line.  If set to
              0, turn off wrapping.  Default = turn-on = 79.

       When more than one option is used, they should be separated by a blank space, except on systems  such  as
       VMS  where options begin with slash ( / ).  No blank spaces may be placed around the equals sign ( = ) in
       a setting.  ftnchek "?"  will produce a command summary listing all options and settings.

       For settings that take a list of keywords, namely  <b>-arguments</b>,  <b>-array</b>,  <b>-calltree</b>,  <b>-common</b>,  <b>-crossref</b>,
       <b>-f77</b>,  <b>-f90</b>,  <b>-f95</b>,  <b>-intrinsic</b>,  <b>-makedcls</b>,  <b>-mkhtml</b>,  <b>-portability</b>, <b>-pretty</b>, <b>-project</b>, <b>-source</b>, <b>-style</b>,
       <b>-truncation</b>, and <b>-usage</b>, the list consists of keywords separated by commas or colons.   If  the  list  of
       keywords  is  omitted,  the  effect  is  to  set the option to its turn-on value (same as ``all'' in most
       cases).  Also, if the list is omitted, the setting name can be prefixed with <b>no</b> or <b>no-</b> to  turn  off  all
       the  options it controls.  For example, <b>-f77</b> turns on all warnings about nonstandard constructions, while
       <b>-nof77</b> turns them all off.    Three special keywords are:

       <b>help</b>   Print out all the option keywords controlled by the setting, with a  brief  explanation  of  their
              meanings.  This keyword cannot be given in a list with other keywords.

       <b>all</b>    Set all options. This turns on all options controlled by the setting.

       <b>none</b>   Clear all options.  This turns off all options controlled by the setting.

       These  three special keywords must be given in full.  For all other keywords, only as many letters of the
       keyword as are necessary to identify it unambiguously need be given, or a wildcard pattern may  be  used.
       Including  a  keyword  in  the list turns the corresponding option on.  For example, <b>-f77=intrinsic</b> would
       turn on only the warnings about use of nonstandard intrinsic functions.  Prefixing a keyword by <b>no-</b> turns
       its option off.  For example, <b>-pretty=no-long-line</b> turns off warnings about lines exceeding 72 columns in
       length while leaving all other warnings about misleading appearance in effect.  If a setting has  default
       <b>none</b>, you can turn on all options except one or two by using <b>all</b> first.  For example, <b>-f77=all,no-include</b>
       enables  warnings  about  all nonstandard extensions except INCLUDE statements.  If a setting has default
       <b>all</b>,  you  can  turn  off  all  warnings  except  one  or  two  by  using  <b>none</b>  first.    For   example,
       <b>-truncation=none,demotion</b> would turn off all precision related warnings except about demotions.  Wildcard
       patterns  contain  an asterisk to stand for any string of characters.  If a wildcard pattern is used, all
       the warnings that match it are affected.  If <b>no-</b> is prefixed to the pattern, all  the  matching  warnings
       are  turned off, otherwise they are all turned on.  The minimum unambiguous length rule does not apply to
       wildcard matching.    For example, use <b>-usage=no-*var*</b> to turn off  all  warnings  relating  to  variable
       usage  (both  local and common).  (Unix users may need to quote any options containing wildcards in order
       to prevent the shell from attempting to expand them.)  Wildcards are recognized only in lists of  warning
       keywords, not in the top-level options themselves.

       When  <b>ftnchek</b> starts up, it looks for environment variables and also for a preferences file.  Any options
       defined in the environment or in the preferences file are used as  defaults  in  place  of  the  built-in
       defaults.   They  are  over-ridden by any command line options.  See the section on changing the defaults
       for details about the environment options and the preferences file.

       When giving a name of an input file, the extension is optional.  If no extension is given,  <b>ftnchek</b>  will
       first  look for a project file with extension <u>.prj</u>, and will use that if it exists.  If not, then <b>ftnchek</b>
       will look for a Fortran source file with the extension <u>.for</u> for VMS systems, <u>.f</u> for UNIX  systems.   More
       than  one file name can be given to <b>ftnchek</b>, and it will process the modules in all files as if they were
       in a single file.

       Wildcards are allowed in the specification of filenames on the  command  line  for  the  VMS  and  MS-DOS
       versions,  as  also  of  course  under  UNIX and any other system that performs wildcard expansion in the
       command processor.

       If no filename is given, <b>ftnchek</b> will read input from the standard input.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       This section provides a more detailed discussion of <b>ftnchek</b> command-line options.  Options and  filenames
       may  be  interspersed on a command line.  Most options are positional: each option remains in effect from
       the point it is encountered until it is overridden by a later change.  Thus for example, the listing  may
       be  suppressed  for  some  files  and  not for others.  Exceptions are: the <b>-intrinsic</b>, <b>-pointersize</b>, and
       <b>-wordsize</b> settings, which cannot be changed once processing of input files has started;  the  <b>-arguments</b>,
       <b>-array</b>,  <b>-calltree</b>,  <b>-common</b>,  <b>-crossref</b>,  <b>-extern</b>,  <b>-reference</b>,  <b>-resources</b>,  <b>-sort</b>, <b>-vcg</b>, and <b>-volatile</b>
       options, where the action depends only on the value of the option after the processing of input files  is
       finished; and the <b>-include</b> setting, which is cumulative.

       The option names in the following list are in alphabetical order.

       <b>-arguments=</b><u>list</u>
              Controls  warnings  about mismatches between actual and dummy subprogram arguments, and also about
              mismatches between expected and actual subprogram type.  (An actual argument is an argument passed
              to the subprogram by the caller; a dummy argument is an argument received by the subprogram.)   By
              default, all warnings are turned on.

              The  <u>list</u>  consists of keywords separated by commas or colons.  Since all these warnings are on by
              default, include a keyword prefixed by <b>no-</b> to turn off a  particular  warning.   There  are  three
              special  keywords: <b>all</b> to turn on all the warnings about arguments, <b>none</b> to turn them all off, and
              <b>help</b> to print the list of all the keywords with a brief explanation of each.  If <u>list</u> is  omitted,
              <b>-arguments</b>  is  equivalent  to  <b>-arguments=all</b>, and <b>-noarguments</b> is equivalent to <b>-arguments=none</b>.
              The warning keywords with their meanings are as follows:

              <b>arrayness</b>:
                    warn about inconsistent use of arguments that are arrays.  These  warnings  can  be  further
                    controlled by the <b>-array</b> option.

              <b>type</b>:
                  warn about dummy arguments of a different data type from the actual arguments.

              <b>function-type</b>:
                  warn  if  the  invocation  assumes  the  function's  return  value is a different type than it
                  actually is.  Also warns if a function is called as a subroutine, or vice-versa.

              <b>number</b>:
                  warn about invoking a subprogram with a different number  of  arguments  than  the  subprogram
                  expects.

              For  compatibility  with  previous  versions  of  <b>ftnchek</b>,  a numeric form of this setting is also
              accepted: the <u>list</u> is replaced by a number from 0 to 3.  A value of 0 turns all the warnings  off,
              1 turns on only <b>number</b>, 2 turns on all except <b>number</b>, and 3 turns all the warnings on.

              This setting does not apply to checking invocations of intrinsic functions or statement functions,
              which can only be turned off by the <b>-nocheck</b> option.

              See also: <b>-array</b>, <b>-library</b>, <b>-usage</b>.

       <b>-array=</b><u>list</u>
              Controls  the  degree  of  strictness  in  checking  agreement between actual and dummy subprogram
              arguments that are arrays.  The warnings controlled by this setting  are  for  constructions  that
              might  legitimately  be  used  by  a knowledgeable programmer, but that often indicate programming
              errors.  By default, all warnings are turned on.

              The <u>list</u> consists of keywords separated by commas or colons.  Since all these warnings are  on  by
              default,  include  a  keyword  prefixed  by <b>no-</b> to turn off a particular warning.  There are three
              special keywords: <b>all</b> to turn on all the warnings about array arguments, <b>none</b>  to  turn  them  all
              off,  and <b>help</b> to print the list of all the keywords with a brief explanation of each.  If <u>list</u> is
              omitted, <b>-array</b> is equivalent to <b>-array=all</b>, and  <b>-noarray</b>  is  equivalent  to  <b>-array=none</b>.   The
              warning keywords with their meanings are as follows:

              <b>dimensions</b>:
                  warn  if  the  arguments differ in their number of dimensions, or if the actual argument is an
                  array element while the dummy argument is a whole array.

              <b>size</b>:
                  warn if both arguments are arrays, but they differ in number of elements.

              For compatibility with previous versions of <b>ftnchek</b>,  a numeric  form  of  this  setting  is  also
              accepted:  the <u>list</u> is replaced by a number from 0 to 3.  A value of 0 turns all the warnings off,
              1 turns on only <b>dimensions</b>, 2 turns on only <b>size</b>, and 3 turns all the warnings on.

              Note: A warning is always given regardless of this setting if the  actual  argument  is  an  array
              while  the  dummy argument is a scalar variable, or if the actual argument is a scalar variable or
              expression while the dummy argument is an array.  These cases are seldom  intentional.   (To  turn
              off  even  these  warnings,  use <b>-arguments=no-arrayness</b>.)  No warning is ever given if the actual
              argument is an array element while the dummy argument is a scalar variable.   Variable-dimensioned
              arrays  and arrays dimensioned with 1 or asterisk match any number of array elements.  There is no
              check of whether multi-dimensional arrays agree in the size of each dimension separately.

              See also: <b>-arguments</b>, <b>-library</b>, <b>-usage</b>.

       <b>-brief</b>
              Selects a shorter format for some warning messages.  At present, the only warnings  controlled  by
              this  flag  are  those  that  are printed at the end of processing each subprogram.  These include
              warnings about variables that are set but not used or used before set, variable names that do  not
              conform  to the Fortran 77 standard, etc.  (These warnings may be suppressed entirely depending on
              other flags, such as the <b>-usage</b> or <b>-f77</b> flags.)  In the default format each variable is listed  on
              a separate line, along with the line number where the variable is declared, set or used, according
              to  the nature of the warning.  The briefer format simply lists all variables to which the warning
              applies, with up to 4 variables per line.

              See also: <b>-quiet</b>.

       <b>-calltree=</b><u>list</u>
              Causes <b>ftnchek</b> to print out the call structure of the complete program.

              The <u>list</u> consists of keywords separated by commas or colons.  There are two special keywords: <b>none</b>
              to turn off all the options, and <b>help</b> to  print  the  list  of  all  the  keywords  with  a  brief
              explanation  of  each.  (The keyword <b>all</b> turns on all the options, but should not normally be used
              since only one format should be specified.)  If  <u>list</u>  is  omitted,  <b>-calltree</b>  is  equivalent  to
              <b>-calltree=tree</b>,  and  <b>-nocalltree</b>  is  equivalent  to <b>-calltree=none</b>.  By default no call graph is
              printed.

              If the -mkhtml option  is  invoked  <u>and</u>  tree  is  the  applied  calltree  option,  a  file  named
              CallTree.html,  will also be produced depicting the tree in HTML format.  This file is useful as a
              starting point for browsing the HTML files describing each component of the program.

              The keywords which control which format is used are as follows:

              <b>tree</b>:
                  produce the call graph in tree format.

              <b>reference</b>:
                  produce the call graph in who-calls-who format (same as <b>-reference</b> switch).

              <b>vcg</b>:
                  produce the call graph in VCG format (same as <b>-vcg</b> switch).

              Only one of the formats <b>tree</b>, <b>reference</b>, or <b>vcg</b> may be specified.

              The following keywords control options affecting the output:

              <b>prune</b>:
                  prune repeated subtrees (applicable only with <b>tree</b>).  This the default.

              <b>sort</b>:
                  sort children of each routine into alphabetical order.  This is the default.

              See the discussion of the <b>-reference</b> and <b>-vcg</b> flags for details about these formats.

              For <b>tree</b> format, The call graph is printed out starting from the main program, which is listed  on
              the  first  line at the left margin.  Then on the following lines, each routine called by the main
              program is listed, indented a few spaces, followed by the subtree starting at that routine.

              In the default mode, if a routine is called by more than one other routine, its  call  subtree  is
              printed  only  the  first  time  it  is encountered Later calls give only the routine name and the
              notice ``(see above)''.  To have the subtree printed for  each  occurrence  of  the  routine,  use
              option <b>no-prune</b>.

              Note  that the call tree will be incomplete if any of the input files are project files containing
              more than one module that were created in <b>-library</b> mode.  See  the  discussion  of  project  files
              below.

              Technical points: Each list of routines called by a given routine is printed in alphabetical order
              unless the <b>no-sort</b> option is given.  If multiple main programs are found, the call tree of each is
              printed  separately.  If no main program is found, a report to that effect is printed out, and the
              call trees of any top-level non-library  routines  are  printed.   This  flag  only  controls  the
              printing  of  the  call  tree:  <b>ftnchek</b> constructs the call tree in any case because it is used to
              determine which library modules will be cross-checked.  See the discussion of the <b>-library</b> flag.

              For compatibility with previous versions of <b>ftnchek</b>,  a numeric  form  of  this  setting  is  also
              accepted:  the  <u>list</u>  is replaced by a number from 0 to 15.  This number is formed from 1 for <b>tree</b>
              format, 2 for <b>reference</b> format, or 3 for <b>vcg</b> format, plus 4 for <b>no-prune</b>, and 8 for <b>no-sort</b>.

              See also: <b>-crossref</b>, <b>-library</b>, <b>-reference</b>, <b>-sort</b>, <b>-symtab</b>, <b>-vcg</b>.

       <b>-check</b>
              This switch is provided so that errors and warning messages can be turned off when <b>ftnchek</b> is used
              for purposes other than finding bugs, such as making declarations or printing the call  tree.   It
              is positional, so after turning all checks off, selected checks can be turned back on.  The effect
              of  <b>-nocheck</b>  is to put all switches, numeric settings, and settings controlling lists of warnings
              to their turn-off values, as if they had all been specified with the  -no  prefix.   Switches  and
              settings  that  specify  options  and  modes  of  operation, rather than controlling warnings, are
              unaffected.  These are <b>-columns</b>, <b>-crossref</b>,  <b>-include</b>,  <b>-intrinsic</b>,  <b>-library</b>,  <b>-list</b>,  <b>-makedcls</b>,
              <b>-novice</b>, <b>-output</b>, <b>-pointersize</b>, <b>-project</b>, <b>-quiet</b>, <b>-reference</b>, <b>-resources</b>, <b>-sort</b>, <b>-source</b>, <b>-symtab</b>,
              <b>-vcg</b>, <b>-version</b>, <b>-wordsize</b>, and <b>-wrap</b>.  Default = yes.

              Parse  errors  (syntax  errors  due to unrecognized or malformed statements) are not suppressed by
              this switch, since the results may be incorrect if <b>ftnchek</b> has not parsed the program correctly.

              There are some miscellaneous errors and warning messages that are  not  controlled  by  any  other
              switch,  and  so can be turned off only by this switch.  Note that using <b>-check</b> following <b>-nocheck</b>
              only has the effect of turning these special warnings back on, and does not restore all the checks
              it turned off.  These warnings are:

              o   Module contains no executable statements.

              o   In free source form, missing space where space is required (e.g.  between  a  keyword  and  an
                  identifier) or space present where none is allowed (e.g. within an identifier).

              o   Zero or negative length specification in a data type declaration of the form type*len.

              o   Invalid operand(s) in an expression.

              o   Array assigned to scalar.

              o   Type mismatch between DO index and bounds.

              o   Undefined common block declared in SAVE statement.

              o   Intrinsic function explicitly declared with an incompatible type.

              o   Unknown intrinsic function explicitly declared in an INTRINSIC statement.

              o   Intrinsic function passed as a subprogram argument is not declared in an INTRINSIC statement.

              o   Intrinsic function or statement function invoked incorrectly.

              o   Function does not set return value prior to RETURN statement.

              o   Parameter  constant value not evaluated (this is <b>ftnchek</b>'s fault, and it is just informing you
                  of the fact).

              o   Entry point of a subprogram is later used as a different subprogram's name.

              o   Unknown keyword used in an I/O statement.

              o   Illegal label reference (e.g. GOTO refers to a non-executable statement; I/O statement  refers
                  to a non-format statement).

              See also: <b>-errors</b>.

       <b>-columns=</b><u>num</u>
              Set  maximum statement length to <u>num</u> columns.  (Beyond this is ignored.)  This setting is provided
              to allow checking of programs which may violate the Fortran standard limit of 72 columns  for  the
              length  of a statement.  According to the standard, all characters past column 72 are ignored.  If
              this setting is used when the <b>-f77=long-line</b> option is in effect, a warning will be given for  any
              lines in which characters past column 72 are processed.  Turn-on = max = 132.  Default = 72.

              This  setting  does  not  suppress warnings about the presence of characters beyond column 72.  To
              process code with meaningful program text beyond column 72, use this setting and be sure the  <b>-f77</b>
              <b>long-line</b> option is off.  To process code with sequence numbers in columns 73 to 80, leave the the
              columns setting at the default value and use the <b>-pretty=no-long-line</b> flag.

              See also: <b>-f77</b>, <b>-pretty</b>.

       <b>-common=</b><u>list</u>
              This  setting  controls  the  strictness  of  checking of COMMON blocks.  By default, all warnings
              except <b>volatile</b> are turned on.

              The <u>list</u> consists of keywords separated by commas or colons.  Since most of these warnings are  on
              by  default,  include a keyword prefixed by <b>no-</b> to turn off a particular warning.  There are three
              special keywords: <b>all</b> to turn on all the warnings, <b>none</b> to turn them all off, and  <b>help</b>  to  print
              the  list  of  all  the keywords with a brief explanation of each.  If <u>list</u> is omitted, <b>-common</b> is
              equivalent to <b>-common=dimensions,exact,length,type</b>, and <b>-nocommon</b> is equivalent  to  <b>-common=none</b>.
              The warning keywords with their meanings are as follows:

              <b>dimensions</b>:
                  corresponding  arrays  in  each  declaration  of  a  block  must  agree  in size and number of
                  dimensions.  This option only has an effect when used together with <b>exact</b>.

              <b>exact</b>:
                  the comparison of two  blocks  is  done  variable-by-variable  rather  than  simply  requiring
                  agreement  between  corresponding  storage locations.  Use this if all declarations of a given
                  COMMON block are supposed to be identical, which is a good programming practice.

              <b>length</b>:
                  warn if different declarations of the same block are not equal in total length.   The  Fortran
                  77  Standard  requires each named common block, but not blank common, to be the same length in
                  all modules of the program.

              <b>type</b>:
                  in each declaration of a given COMMON block, corresponding memory locations (words  or  bytes)
                  must  agree  in  data type.  If used together with <b>exact</b>, this will require that corresponding
                  variables agree in data type.

              <b>volatile</b>:
                  Assume that COMMON blocks are volatile.

              Many Fortran programmers assume that variables, whether local or in COMMON, are static, i.e.  that
              once  assigned a value, they retain that value permanently until assigned a different value by the
              program.  However, in fact the Fortran 77 Standard does not require this to be  the  case.   Local
              variables  may  become  undefined  between  activations  of  a  module in which they are declared.
              Similarly, COMMON blocks may become undefined if no module in which they are declared  is  active.
              (The  technical  term  for entities with this behavior is ``automatic'', but <b>ftnchek</b> uses the word
              ``volatile'' since it is clearer to the nonspecialist.)  Only COMMON blocks  declared  in  a  SAVE
              statement, or declared in the main program or in a block data subprogram remain defined as long as
              the  program  is running.  Variables and COMMON blocks that can become undefined at some point are
              called volatile.

              If the <b>-common=volatile</b> flag is turned on, <b>ftnchek</b> will warn you if it  finds  a  volatile  COMMON
              block.   If,  at  the  same time, the <b>-usage=com-block-volatile</b>  option is turned on (which is the
              default), <b>ftnchek</b> will try to check whether such a block  can  lose  its  defined  status  between
              activations of the modules where it is declared.  <b>ftnchek</b> does not do a very good job of this: the
              rule used is to see whether the block is declared in two separated subtrees of the call tree.  For
              instance,  this  would  be  the  case  if two modules, both called from the main program, shared a
              volatile COMMON block.  A block can also become undefined between two successive calls of the same
              subprogram, but <b>ftnchek</b> is not smart enough to tell whether a subprogram can be called  more  than
              once, so this case is not checked for.

              The <b>-common=volatile</b> flag does not affect the way <b>ftnchek</b> checks the usage of local variables.

              For  compatibility  with  previous  versions  of  <b>ftnchek</b>,  a numeric form of this setting is also
              accepted: the <u>list</u> is replaced by a number from 0 to 3.  A value of 0 turns all the warnings  off,
              1  or  greater  turns  on  <b>type</b>, 2 or greater turns on <b>length</b>, and 3 turns on <b>dimensions</b> and <b>exact</b>
              also.  The numeric form cannot turn on the <b>volatile</b> option.

              See also: <b>-library</b>, <b>-usage</b>.

       <b>-crossref=</b><u>list</u>
              Prints cross-reference tables.  Default = none.

              The <u>list</u> consists of keywords separated by commas or colons.  The keywords with their meanings are
              as follows:

              <b>calls</b>:
                    table lists each subprogram followed by a list of routines that call it.  This listing omits
                    library modules that  are  not  in  the  call  tree  of  the  main  program.   The  list  is
                    alphabetized.

              <b>common</b>:
                    table  lists  each  COMMON  block  followed by a list of the routines that access it.  These
                    listed routines are those in which some variables in the  COMMON  block  are  accessed,  not
                    simply  those  routines that declare the block.  (To find out what routines declare a COMMON
                    block but do not use it, see the <b>-usage</b> flag.)

              <b>labels</b>:
                    table lists each label followed by a list of all references to it.   A  label  reference  is
                    denoted  by  the line number and statement type of the referring statement.   The label list
                    is in sequential order.  The references are listed in the order they are encountered in  the
                    program.

              See also: <b>-calltree</b>, <b>-reference</b>, <b>-sort</b>, <b>-symtab</b>, <b>-vcg</b>.

       <b>-declare</b>
              If this flag is set, all identifiers whose datatype is not declared in each module will be listed.
              This  flag is useful for helping to find misspelled variable names, etc.  The same listing will be
              given if the module contains an IMPLICIT NONE statement.  Default = no.

              See also: <b>-sixchar</b>, <b>-usage</b>.

       <b>-division</b>
              This switch is provided to help users spot potential division by zero problems.  If this switch is
              selected, every division except by a constant will be flagged.  (It is assumed that  the  user  is
              intelligent enough not to divide by a constant which is equal to zero!)  Default = no.

              See also: <b>-portability</b>, <b>-truncation</b>.

       <b>-errors=</b><u>num</u>
              Set  the  maximum  number  of  error  messages  in a ``cascade''.  During checking of agreement of
              subprogram arguments, common block declarations, and  so  forth,  sometimes  a  single  case  will
              generate  a  long string of warnings.  Often this simply indicates some other cause than a genuine
              item-by-item mismatch, such as for example a varible missing from one  list.   So  in  such  cases
              <b>ftnchek</b> stops printing the warnings after the cascade limit is reached, and the trailer ``etc...''
              is  printed to indicate that there were more errors not printed.  If you think that these warnings
              are likely to be genuine, use this setting to see more of them.  Turn-on = default = 3, max = 999.
              A value of 0 means no limit.

              This setting does not set an overall limit on the number  of  error  messages  printed,  only  the
              number  printed  in any one cascade.  Most types of warnings and error messages are not subject to
              the cascade effect and so are not affected by this setting.  To turn off warnings  generally,  use
              the individual warning control options or the <b>-nocheck</b> option.

              See also: <b>-check</b>.

       <b>-extern</b>
              Causes  <b>ftnchek</b>  to  report  whether  any  subprograms  invoked  by the program are never defined.
              Ordinarily, if <b>ftnchek</b> is being run  on  a  complete  program,  each  subprogram  other  than  the
              intrinsic functions should be defined somewhere.  Turn off this switch if you just want to check a
              subset  of files which form part of a larger complete program.  Subprogram arguments will still be
              checked for correctness.  Default = yes.

              The <b>-extern</b> flag  is  now  superseded  by  the  <b>-usage=ext-undefined</b>  option.   For  the  sake  of
              convenience,   the   <b>-extern</b>   flag   is   retained,   so   that   <b>-noextern</b>   is   equivalent  to
              <b>-usage=no-ext-undefined</b> option.  The <b>-extern</b> switch may be retired eventually.

              See also: <b>-library</b>.

       <b>-f77=</b><u>list</u>
              Use this setting to catch language  extensions  which  violate  the  Fortran  77  Standard.   Such
              extensions  may cause your program not to be portable.  Examples include the use of underscores in
              variable names; variable names  longer  than  six  characters;  statement  lines  longer  than  72
              characters;  and  nonstandard  statements  such  as  the DO ... ENDDO structure.  <b>ftnchek</b> does not
              report on the use of lowercase letters.  By default, all warnings are turned off.

              This setting provides detailed control over the warnings about supported extensions to the Fortran
              77 Standard.  (Further details about the extensions themselves are given below in the  section  on
              Extensions.)   The  <u>list</u>  consists  of  keywords  separated  by commas or colons.  There are three
              special keywords: <b>all</b> to turn on all the warnings about nonstandard extensions, <b>none</b> to turn  them
              all off, and <b>help</b> to print the list of all the keywords with a brief explanation of each.  If <u>list</u>
              is  omitted,  <b>-f77</b>  is equivalent to <b>-f77=all</b>, and <b>-nof77</b> is equivalent to <b>-f77=none</b>.  The warning
              keywords with their meanings are as follows:

              <b>accept-type</b>:
                    ACCEPT and TYPE I/O statements.

              <b>array-bounds</b>:
                    Expressions defining array bounds that contain array elements or function references.

              <b>assignment-stmt</b>:
                    Assignment statements involving arrays.  In Fortran 90, an array can be assigned to  another
                    array  of  compatible  shape,  or  a  scalar  can be assigned to an array.  Neither of these
                    assignments is permitted in Fortran 77.

                    A related warning occurs when an array is assigned to a scalar.  Since this is illegal  also
                    in Fortran 90, it is always warned about regardless of the <b>-f77</b> setting (unless all checking
                    is turned off with the <b>-nocheck</b> flag).

              <b>attribute-based-decl</b>:
                    Type declarations in the new Fortran 90 attribute-based style.  This style of declaration is
                    distinguished  by the use of a double colon (::) between the list of attributes and the list
                    of declared variables.  This option also controls warnings for use of Fortran 90  length  or
                    kind  specifiers  in  type  declarations.   (Although  these  specifiers can be used in non-
                    attribute-based declarations, they are controlled by this option to avoid  proliferation  of
                    <b>-f77</b> options.)

              <b>automatic-array</b>:
                    Local  (not  dummy) arrays which have variable size.  These would correspond to arrays whose
                    storage would have to be dynamically allocated at run time.

              <b>backslash</b>:
                    Unix  backslash  escape  in  strings.   This   warning   will   be   given   only   if   the
                    <b>-source=unix-backslash</b>   setting   is  specified  to  cause  the  escape  interpretation  of
                    backslash..

              <b>byte</b>: BYTE data type declaration.

              <b>case-construct</b>:
                    The SELECT CASE construct.

              <b>character</b>:
                    Extensions to the Fortran 77 standard regarding  character  data.   At  present,  this  only
                    controls  warnings  about  character  variables  declared  with zero or negative length.  In
                    Fortran 77, all character variables must be of positive length.  In Fortran 90, they can  be
                    zero length, and declarations that specify negative lengths are permitted, turning into zero
                    for  the  declared  length.   Note:  because  negative  length  specifiers  may  indicate  a
                    programming error, the warning about them is given even if this option is turned off, and is
                    suppressed only by the <b>-nocheck</b> flag.

              <b>common-subprog-name</b>:
                    Common block and subprogram having the same name.

              <b>construct-name</b>:
                    Use of a construct-name to label a control statement.

              <b>continuation</b>:
                    More than 19 successive continuation lines.

              <b>cpp</b>:  Unix C preprocessor directives in the source code.

              <b>cray-pointer</b>:
                    ``Cray pointer'' syntax.

              <b>cycle-exit</b>:
                    The CYCLE and EXIT statements.

              <b>d-comment</b>:
                    Debugging comments starting with D in the source code.

              <b>dec-tab</b>:
                    DEC Fortran style tab-formatted source code.   This  warning  will  be  given  only  if  the
                    <b>-source=dec-tab</b> setting is specified to cause interpretation of tabs in this style.

              <b>do-enddo</b>:
                    DO loop extensions: terminal statement label omitted, END DO, and WHILE.

              <b>double-complex</b>:
                    Double precision complex datatype.

              <b>format-dollarsign</b>:
                    Dollar sign control code in FORMAT statements.

              <b>format-edit-descr</b>:
                    Nonstandard edit descriptors in FORMAT statements.

              <b>function-noparen</b>:
                    Function definition without parentheses.

              <b>implicit-none</b>:
                    IMPLICIT NONE statement.

              <b>include</b>:
                    INCLUDE statement.

              <b>inline-comment</b>:
                    Inline comments starting with an exclamation point.

              <b>internal-list-io</b>:
                    List-directed I/O to or from an internal file.

              <b>intrinsic</b>:
                    Nonstandard intrinsic functions.

              <b>io-keywords</b>
                    Nonstandard keywords used in I/O statements.  These fall into three groups.  The first group
                    includes keywords that are accepted in Fortran 90:
                                                   ACTION    PAD        READWRITE
                                                   ADVANCE   POSITION   SIZE
                                                   DELIM     READ       WRITE
                                                   EOR
                    The second group comprises the following VMS Fortran keywords:
                                           BLOCKSIZE         EXTENDSIZE       READONLY
                                           BUFFERCOUNT       INITIALSIZE      RECORDSIZE
                                           CARRIAGECONTROL   MAXREC           RECORDTYPE
                                           DEFAULTFILE       NAME (in OPEN)   SHARED
                                           DISP              NOSPANBLOCK      TYPE
                                           DISPOSE           ORGANIZATION
                    (The  keyword  NAME is standard only in the INQUIRE statement.)  The third group consists of
                    the following IBM/MVS keyword:
                                                            NUM
                    This flag also controls a warning about use of ACCESS='APPEND', which is  accepted  by  some
                    compilers.  The value of 'APPEND' is not valid for any I/O specifier in standard Fortran 77,
                    and in Fortran 90 'APPEND' should be used as a value of the POSITION specifier, not  ACCESS.

              <b>long-line</b>:
                    Statements with meaningful code past 72 columns.  This warning is given only if the <b>-columns</b>
                    setting has been used to increase the statement field width.

              <b>long-name</b>:
                    Identifiers over 6 characters long.

              <b>mixed-common</b>:
                    Mixed character and noncharacter data in COMMON block.

              <b>mixed-expr</b>:
                    Nonstandard  type  combinations  in  expressions, for example DOUBLE PRECISION with COMPLEX,
                    assigning hollerith to integer, logical operations on integers.

              <b>name-dollarsign</b>:
                    Dollar sign used as a character in identifiers.

              <b>name-underscore</b>:
                    Underscore used as a character in identifiers.

              <b>namelist</b>:
                    NAMELIST statement.

              <b>param-implicit-type</b>:
                    Implicit typing of a parameter by the data type of the value  assigned.   This  warning  can
                    only    occur    if    implicit    parameter    typing   has   been   turned   on   by   the
                    <b>-source=param-implicit-type</b> option, or if the PARAMETER statement is of the nonstandard form
                    without parentheses.  If this option  is  turned  on,  then  any  instances  where  implicit
                    parameter  typing  occurs  will  be  warned  about.   If you want to be warned only in those
                    instances  where  the  implicit   data   type   differs   from   the   default   type,   use
                    <b>-portability=param-implicit-type</b>  instead.   According  to the Fortran 77 standard, the data
                    type of a parameter is given by the same rules as for a variable, and if  necessary  a  type
                    conversion is done when the value is assigned.

              <b>param-intrinsic</b>:
                    Intrinsic  function  or  exponentiation  by  a  real used to define the value of a PARAMETER
                    definition.

              <b>param-noparen</b>:
                    PARAMETER statement without parentheses.  The user should be aware  that  the  semantics  of
                    this  form  of  the  statement  differs  from  that  of the standard form: in this form, the
                    parameter takes its data type from the value assigned, rather than having its  default  data
                    type based on the first letter of the parameter name.  (This form of the PARAMETER statement
                    was introduced by DEC before the Fortran 77 standard was defined, and should be avoided.)

              <b>pointer</b>:
                    Fortran  90  standard pointer-related syntax, including POINTER, TARGET and ALLOCATABLE type
                    declarations, ALLOCATE, DEALLOCATE, and NULLIFY statements, and pointer assignment using =&gt;.

              <b>quad-constant</b>:
                    Quad precision real constants, e.g. of the form 1.23Q4.

              <b>quotemark</b>:
                    Strings delimited by quote marks rather than apostrophes.

              <b>relops</b>:
                    Relational (comparison) operators composed of punctuation, namely: &lt; &lt;= == /= &gt; &gt;=.

              <b>semicolon</b>:
                    Semicolon used as statement separator.

              <b>statement-order</b>:
                    Statements out  of  the  sequence  mandated  by  the  Standard.   The  allowed  sequence  is
                    illustrated in Table 1 in the section on Interpreting the Output.

              <b>typeless-constant</b>:
                    Typeless constants, for example Z'19AF'.

              <b>type-size</b>:
                    Type declarations specifying a size, for example REAL*8.

              <b>variable-format</b>:
                    Variable repeat specification or field size in FORMAT.  These are of the form &lt; <u>expr</u> &gt;.

              <b>vms-io</b>:
                    Obsolete.  Now has the same meaning as the <b>io-keywords</b> keyword.

              See also: <b>-f90</b>, <b>-f95</b>, <b>-portability</b>, <b>-pretty</b>, <b>-style</b>, <b>-wordsize</b>.

       <b>-f90=</b><u>list</u>
              This setting provides detailed control over the warnings about supported extensions to the Fortran
              77  Standard that were not adopted as part of the Fortran 90 Standard.  Note that <b>ftnchek</b> does not
              support the full Fortran 90 language.  However, it does support some common extensions to  Fortran
              77 that were prevalent before Fortran 90 was defined.  Some of these extensions became part of the
              Fortran  90 Standard, but others did not.  The <b>-f90</b> setting warns only about the latter.  That is,
              this flag covers things that are neither legal Fortran 77 nor legal Fortran  90.   Therefore,  the
              warnings controlled by this flag are basically a subset of the warnings controlled by <b>-f77</b>.  There
              are  a  few  cases,  described  below,  where  the circumstances in which the warning is given are
              slightly different for the two flags.

              The <u>list</u> consists of keywords separated by commas or colons.  There are  three  special  keywords:
              <b>all</b>  to turn on all the warnings about nonstandard extensions, <b>none</b> to turn them all off, and <b>help</b>
              to print the list of all the keywords with a brief explanation of each.  If <u>list</u> is omitted,  <b>-f90</b>
              is equivalent to <b>-f90=all</b>, and <b>-nof90</b> is equivalent to <b>-f90=none</b>.

              The  following  keywords  have identical meanings for <b>-f90</b> as for <b>-f77</b>.  The reader is referred to
              the explanations under <b>-f77</b>.
                                     <b>accept-type</b>   <b>double-complex</b>        <b>param-noparen</b>
                                     <b>backslash</b>     <b>format-dollarsign</b>     <b>cray-pointer</b>
                                     <b>byte</b>          <b>format-edit-descr</b>     <b>quad-constant</b>
                                     <b>cpp</b>           <b>function-noparen</b>      <b>type-size</b>
                                     <b>d-comment</b>     <b>name-dollarsign</b>       <b>variable-format</b>
                                     <b>dec-tab</b>       <b>param-implicit-type</b>   <b>vms-io</b>

              The keywords which differ somewhat from the corresponding <b>-f77</b> keywords are as follows.

              <b>continuation</b>:
                    The limit on the number of continuation lines for a statement in fixed source  form  is  the
                    same,  namely  19,  in  Fortran  90  as in Fortran 77.  For free source form the limit is 39
                    continuation lines, and a line containing a continuation mark cannot be otherwise  empty  or
                    contain only a comment.

              <b>intrinsic</b>:
                    This  is  the  same  as for <b>-f77</b> except for the intrinsic functions defined in MIL-STD 1753,
                    which are all included in Fortran 90, and so are not warned about.  (See  <b>-intrinsic</b>  for  a
                    list.)

              <b>io-keywords</b>:
                    This is the same as for <b>-f77</b> except that no warnings are given for the I/O keywords that are
                    standard in Fortran 90.

              <b>long-line</b>:
                    Although the Fortran 90 Standard allows lines longer than 72 characters in free source form,
                    this  restriction  still  applies to fixed source form.  In free source form the line length
                    limit is 132 characters, and unlike fixed form, <b>ftnchek</b> does not  allow  this  limit  to  be
                    increased.

              <b>mixed-expr</b>:
                    This  is  the  same  as  for <b>-f77</b> except for expressions mixing extended precision real with
                    complex data types, which are permitted in Fortran 90.

              <b>statement-order</b>:
                    This is similar  to  the  corresponding  <b>-f77</b>  warning,  but  applies  the  somewhat  looser
                    restrictions  on  statement  order  of  the  Fortran 90 Standard.  In particular, Fortran 90
                    allows  DATA  statements  and  statement-function  definitions   to   be   intermixed   with
                    specification statements.

              <b>typeless-constant</b>:
                    In  Fortran  90,  binary,  octal,  and hexadecimal constants of the form B'ddd', O'ddd', and
                    Z'ddd', respectively, are permitted.  Here 'ddd' represents a  string  of  digits.   <b>ftnchek</b>
                    recognizes  these forms, as well as a variant of the form X'ddd' for a hexadecimal constant,
                    and other variants in which the base indicator B, O, Z,  or  X  follows  the  digit  string.
                    These  variants were not adopted in Fortran 90, so only they are warned about when this flag
                    is turned on.

              See also: <b>-f77</b>, <b>-f95</b>, <b>-portability</b>, <b>-pretty</b>, <b>-style</b>, <b>-wordsize</b>.

       <b>-f95=</b><u>list</u>
              This setting provides detailed control over warnings about standard Fortran 77 features that  were
              deleted  from the Fortran 95 Standard.  Unlike the <b>-f77</b> and <b>-f90</b> settings, these warnings apply to
              syntax which is legal Fortran 77.  However, since  these  features  have  been  deleted  from  the
              Standard,  it  is  possible  that  programs  containing  them  will  be unacceptable to some newer
              compilers.

              The <u>list</u> consists of keywords separated by commas or colons.  There are  three  special  keywords:
              <b>all</b>  to turn on all the warnings about nonstandard extensions, <b>none</b> to turn them all off, and <b>help</b>
              to print the list of all the keywords with a brief explanation of each.  If <u>list</u> is omitted,  <b>-f95</b>
              is equivalent to <b>-f95=all</b>, and <b>-nof95</b> is equivalent to <b>-f95=none</b>.  The warning keywords with their
              meanings are as follows.

              <b>real-do</b>:
                    A DO variable of any real numeric type.

              <b>pause</b>:
                    The PAUSE statement.

              <b>assign</b>:
                    The ASSIGN statement, assigned GOTO, or assigned format.

              <b>h-edit</b>:
                    The H edit descriptor in a format.

              There  is one other Fortran 77 syntax feature that was deleted in Fortran 95, namely  branching to
              an ENDIF from outside the IF block.  However, <b>ftnchek</b> is unable to analyze program flow, and so it
              does not provide a warning for this.

              See also: <b>-f77</b>, <b>-f90</b>, <b>-portability</b>, <b>-pretty</b>, <b>-style</b>, <b>-wordsize</b>.

       <b>-help</b>
              Prints a list of all the command-line options with a short description  of  each  along  with  its
              default value.  This command is identical in function to the <b>``?''</b>  argument, and is provided as a
              convenience  for  those  systems  in  which  the  question mark has special meaning to the command
              interpreter.  Default = no.

              The help listing also prints the version number and patch level of <b>ftnchek</b> and a copyright notice.

              Note: the ``default'' values printed  in  square  brackets  in  the  help  listing  are,  strictly
              speaking,  not  the built-in defaults but the current values after any environment options and any
              command-line options preceding the <b>-help</b> option have been processed.

              See also: <b>-novice</b>, <b>-version</b>, and <b>help</b> option of all settings that take a list of keywords.

       <b>-identifier-chars=</b><u>list</u>
              Define non-alphanumeric characters that may be used in  identifiers.   By  default,  <b>ftnchek</b>  only
              accepts  the  dollar  sign and underscore as non-alphanumeric characters in identifier names.  The
              characters in the <u>list</u> replace whatever set of accepted non-alphanumeric characters was previously
              in effect.  Thus, if dollar sign or underscore are not included  in  the  list,  they  lose  their
              status as acceptable characters.

              This option is provided to enable <b>ftnchek</b> to handle source files containing non-standard identifer
              names  that  may  be  needed,  for  example, to access certain operating system services.  See the
              section on Limitations and Extensions for the treatment of identifiers containing these characters
              in implicit typing.

              Using <b>-noidentifer-chars</b> turns off acceptance of non-alphanumeric characters entirely.

              See also: <b>-source</b>.

       <b>-include=</b><u>path</u>
              Specifies a directory to be searched for files specified  by  INCLUDE  statements.   Unlike  other
              command-line  options,  this  setting is cumulative; that is, if it is given more than once on the
              command line, all the directories so specified are placed on a list that will be searched  in  the
              same  order  as they are given.  The order in which <b>ftnchek</b> searches for a file to be included is:
              the current directory; the directory specified by environment variable FTNCHEK_INCLUDE if any; the
              directories specified by any <b>-include</b> options; the directory  specified  by  environment  variable
              INCLUDE;  and  finally in a standard system-wide directory (<a href="file:/usr/include">/usr/include</a> for UNIX, SYS$LIBRARY for
              VMS, and \include for MSDOS).

              See also: <b>-f77</b>, <b>-source</b>.

       <b>-intrinsic=</b><u>list</u>
              Controls whether <b>ftnchek</b> recognizes certain nonstandard intrinsic  functions  as  intrinsic.   The
              <u>list</u>  consists of keywords separated by commas or colons.  Some of the keywords control whether to
              recognize certain groups of functions, and other keywords control the expected syntax for invoking
              some nonstandard intrinsics.  Include a keyword to turn on recognition of the corresponding set of
              intrinsics or to allow the corresponding syntax.  Include a keyword prefixed by <b>no-</b>  to  turn  off
              that recognition.

              There  are  three  special  keywords:  <b>all</b>  turns on recognition of all the nonstandard intrinsics
              (listed below) and accepts either syntax for those that have variations.  Use  <b>none</b>  to  turn  off
              recognition of all nonstandard intrinsics except those noted below.  Use <b>help</b> to print the list of
              all  the  keywords with a brief explanation of each.  If <u>list</u> is omitted, <b>-intrinsic</b> is equivalent
              to <b>-intrinsic=all</b>, and <b>-nointrinsic</b> is equivalent to <b>-intrinsic=none</b>.

              The nonstandard intrinsic functions needed to support  the  nonstandard  extended  precision  data
              types  (double  complex  and quad precision) are always recognized.  The intrinsics for the double
              complex data type are:
                                                CDABS   CDSQRT   DREAL   ZLOG

               The intrinsics for the quad precision and quad complex types are:
                                               CQABS    QARCOS   QEXT     QNINT

                                               CQSIN    QCMPLX   QINT     QSIN

                                               IQNINT   QDIM     QMIN1    QTANH
                                               QABS     QEXP     QMOD     SNGLQ
               The keywords controlling recognition of other nonstandard intrinsic functions are as follows:

              <b>extra</b>:
                    recognize the following commonly available nonstandard intrinsics (all except EXIT  and  LOC
                    are defined in MIL-STD 1753):
                                                   BTEST   IBCLR   IEOR    ISHFTC
                                                   EXIT    IBITS   IOR     LOC
                                                   IAND    IBSET   ISHFT   NOT

              <b>unix</b>: recognize these common Unix-specific intrinsic functions:
                                                 ABORT    GMTIME   LTIME    SRAND
                                                 AND      IARGC    OR       SYSTEM
                                                 GETARG   IRAND    RAND     TIME
                                                 GETENV   LSHIFT   RSHIFT   XOR

              <b>vms</b>:  recognize these common VMS-specific intrinsic functions:
                                                   DATE     IDATE   SECNDS   TIME
                                                   ERRSNS   RAN     SIZEOF

              <b>iargc-no-argument</b>:
                    specify that IARGC may be invoked with no arguments.

              <b>iargc-one-argument</b>:
                    specify that IARGC may be invoked with one argument.

              <b>rand-no-argument</b>:
                    specify that RAND and IRAND may be invoked with no arguments.

              <b>rand-one-argument</b>:
                    specify that RAND and IRAND may be invoked with one argument.

              The <b>no-argument</b> and <b>one-argument</b> keywords work as follows: turning the option on causes <b>ftnchek</b> to
              accept  the corresponding syntax for invocation of the function, without excluding the possibility
              of the alternative syntax.  Turning the option off causes  the  corresponding  syntax  not  to  be
              accepted.   If  both  options are turned on at once (the default), then either syntax is accepted.
              Turning both options off at once would not  be  meaningful.   These  options  have  no  effect  if
              recognition of Unix intrinsics has been turned off.

              Note  that  this  setting  does  not  control whether non-standard warnings are issued about these
              functions.  It controls whether the functions are assumed to be intrinsic or not, which determines
              how their usage is checked.  When functions in any of these sets are included,  their  invocations
              will be checked according to the rules for the intrinsic functions; otherwise they will be checked
              as  normal  (user-written)  external  functions.   The non-standard warnings are controlled by the
              <b>-f77=intrinsic</b> option.

              The default value of this setting is equivalent to <b>-intrinsic=all</b>  followed  by  <b>-intrinsic=no-vms</b>
              for  the  Unix  version, <b>-intrinsic=no-unix</b> for the VMS version, and <b>-intrinsic=no-unix,no-vms</b> for
              other versions.

              Note: In versions of <b>ftnchek</b> prior to 2.10, the <b>-intrinsic</b> flag took a numeric argument instead of
              a list of options.  For the sake of users who may have written scripts invoking  <b>ftnchek</b>  in  this
              way,  the  numeric  form  is  still  accepted.   The numeric form of the setting consists of three
              digits.  The ones digit selects the set of intrinsic functions  to  be  supported.   The  digit  0
              selects  only Fortran 77 standard intrinsics plus those needed to support the nonstandard extended
              precision data types.  The digit 1 is equivalent to <b>extra</b>, 2 is equivalent to <b>extra,unix</b>, and 3 is
              equivalent to <b>extra,vms</b>.  The tens digit of this setting controls the syntax of the RAND intrinsic
              function, and the hundreds digit controls the syntax of the IARGC  function.   For  these  digits,
              specify 0 to require invocation with no argument, 1 to require one argument, and 2 to allow either
              form.

              See also: <b>-f77</b>.

       <b>-library</b>
              This  switch is used when a number of subprograms are contained in a file, but not all of them are
              used by the application.  Normally, <b>ftnchek</b> warns you if any subprograms  are  defined  but  never
              used.  This switch will suppress these warnings.  Default = no.

              This  switch also controls which subprogram calls and COMMON block declarations are checked.  If a
              file is read with the <b>-library</b> flag in  effect,  the  subprogram  calls  and  COMMON  declarations
              contained  in a routine in that file will be checked only if that routine is in the main program's
              call tree.  On the other hand, if the <b>-library</b> switch is turned off, then <b>ftnchek</b> checks the calls
              of every routine by every other routine, regardless of whether those routines could ever  actually
              be invoked at run time, and likewise all COMMON block declarations are compared for agreement.

              The difference between this switch and the <b>-usage=no-ext-unused</b> option for subprograms is that the
              latter  suppresses  only  the  warning  about  routines being declared but not used.  The <b>-library</b>
              switch goes further and excludes unused routines processed while it is in effect from  all  cross-
              checking of arguments and COMMON block declarations as well.

              (If  there is no main program anywhere in the set of files that <b>ftnchek</b> has read, so that there is
              no call tree, then <b>ftnchek</b> will look for any non-library routines that are not called by any other
              routine, and use these as substitutes for the main program  in  constructing  the  call  tree  and
              deciding  what  to  check.   If  no such top-level non-library routines are found, then all inter-
              module calls and all COMMON declarations will be checked.)

              See also: <b>-arguments</b>, <b>-calltree</b>, <b>-common</b>, <b>-extern</b>, <b>-usage</b>.

       <b>-list</b>
              Specifies that a listing of the Fortran program is to  be  printed  out  with  line  numbers.   If
              <b>ftnchek</b> detects an error, the error message follows the program line with a caret ( ^ ) specifying
              the  location  of the error.  If no source listing was requested, <b>ftnchek</b> will still print out any
              line containing an error, to aid the user in determining where the error occurred.  Default = no.

              See also: <b>-output</b>, \fB-symtab<b>,</b> <b>fB-quiet</b>.

       <b>-makedcls=</b><u>list</u>
              Prepare a neatly-formatted file of declarations of variables, common blocks, and  namelist  lists,
              for possible merging into the source code.  The declarations are stored in a file of the same name
              as the source code, but with the extension changed to <u>.dcl</u>.  If no declarations are written to the
              file, it is deleted to reduce clutter from empty files.

              If  input  comes  from  standard  input, instead of a named file, then declarations are written to
              standard output.

              Variables are declared in alphabetical order within each declaration class and type, with  integer
              variables first, because of their later possible use in array dimensions.

              PARAMETER  statements  are  an  exception  to  the alphabetical order rule, because the Fortran 77
              Standard requires that the expressions defining parameter  values  refer  only  to  constants  and
              already-defined parameter names.  This forces the original source file order of such statements to
              be preserved in the declaration files.

              Explicit  declaration  of  <u>all</u> variables is considered good modern programming practice.  By using
              compiler options to reject undeclared variables, misspelled variable  names  (or  names  extending
              past  column  72)  can  be  caught at compile time.  Explicit declarations also greatly facilitate
              changing floating-point precision with filters such as  <b><a href="../man1L/dtoq.1L.html">dtoq</a></b>(1L),  <b><a href="../man1L/dtos.1L.html">dtos</a></b>(1L),  <b><a href="../man1L/fd2s.1L.html">fd2s</a></b>(1L),  <b><a href="../man1L/fs2d.1L.html">fs2d</a></b>(1L),
              <b><a href="../man1L/qtod.1L.html">qtod</a></b>(1L),  and  <b><a href="../man1L/stod.1L.html">stod</a></b>(1L).  These programs are capable of changing types of explicit floating-point
              type declarations, intrinsic functions, and constants, but because they do not carry out  rigorous
              lexical  and  grammatical  analysis  of the Fortran source code, they cannot provide modified type
              declarations for undeclared variables.  Default setting = 0, turn-on = 1.

              Various options for the form of the declarations file are controlled by the <u>list</u>,  which  consists
              of  keywords  separated by commas or colons.  There are three special keywords: <b>all</b> to turn on all
              the options, <b>none</b> to turn them all off, and <b>help</b> to print the list of  all  the  keywords  with  a
              brief  explanation of each.  If <u>list</u> is omitted, <b>-makedcls</b> is equivalent to <b>-makedcls=declarations</b>
              (i.e. produce the declarations file using the default options), and <b>-nomakedcls</b> is  equivalent  to
              <b>-makedcls=none</b>.

              For  compatibility  with  previous  versions  of  <b>ftnchek</b>,  a numeric form of this setting is also
              accepted:  the <u>list</u> is replaced by a number which is the sum of the numbers in parentheses  beside
              the keywords in the following list.  The warning keywords with their meanings are as follows:

              <b>declarations</b> (1):
                    Write  a declaration file.  (This is implied by any of the other options, and can be omitted
                    if any other options are given.)

              <b>undeclared-only</b> (2):
                    By default, all variables are included in the declaration file.  With this  option,  include
                    only  <u>undeclared</u>  variables.   This  setting  is  useful if you want to check for undeclared
                    variables, since Fortran source files with all variables properly declared will  not  result
                    in  a <u>.dcl</u> file.  With this option, common blocks and namelist lists will not be included in
                    the declaration file, since by their nature they cannot be undeclared.

              <b>compact</b> (4):
                    The declarations are normally prettyprinted to line up neatly in common columns, as  in  the
                    declaration  files  output  by  the  Extended  PFORT Verifier, <b><a href="../man1L/pfort.1L.html">pfort</a></b>(1L).  This option value
                    selects instead compact output, without column alignment.

              <b>use-continuation-lines</b> (8):
                    Causes continuation lines to be used where permissible.  The  default  is  to  begin  a  new
                    declaration on each line.  This option is appropriate to use together with <b>compact</b>.

              <b>keywords-lowercase</b> (16):
                    Output Fortran keywords in lowercase, instead of the default uppercase.

              <b>vars-and-consts-lowercase</b> (32):
                    Output  variables  and constants in lowercase, instead of the default uppercase.   Character
                    string constants are not affected by this option.

              <b>exclude-sftran3</b> (64):
                    Omit declarations of internal  integer  variables  produced  by  the  SFTRAN3  preprocessor,
                    <b><a href="../man1L/xsf3.1L.html">xsf3</a></b>(1L),  as  part of the translation of structured Fortran statements to ordinary Fortran.
                    These variables have six-character names of the form <u>NPRddd</u>,  <u>NXdddd</u>,  <u>N2dddd</u>,  and  <u>N3dddd</u>,
                    where <u>d</u> is a decimal digit.  Because they are invisible in the SFTRAN3 source code, and will
                    change  if  the  SFTRAN3 code is modified, such variables should not be explicitly declared.
                    Instead, they should just assume the default  Fortran  INTEGER  data  type  based  on  their
                    initial letter, <u>N</u>.

              <b>asterisk-comment</b> (128):
                    Use an asterisk as the comment character; the default is otherwise 'C'.

              <b>comment-char-lowercase</b> (256):
                    Use 'c' instead of 'C' or '*' as the comment character.

              <b>suppress-array-dimensions</b> (512):
                    Suppress  dimensioning of arrays in the generated declarations.  This option is for use with
                    code lacking type declarations, to allow the declaration files to be inserted without change
                    into the code.  Since the code will have  dimension  statements  already,  dimensioning  the
                    array  variables  in  the type statements of the declaration file is redundant.  This option
                    should be used only in conjunction with option 2 =  undeclared-only  because  otherwise  any
                    arrays that were dimensioned in a type statement will lose their dimensioning.

              <b>free-form</b> (1024):
                    Produce  declarations  in  free  source  form.  This mode is automatically used if the input
                    source is free form.  Use this option to produce declarations in free form even if the input
                    is in fixed form.  Free form declarations are indented only 2 columns instead of 6, use  the
                    exclamation  mark  as the comment character, and indicate continuation lines by an ampersand
                    at the end of the line to be continued.

              The declaration files contain distinctive comments that mark the start and end of declarations for
              each program unit, to facilitate using text editor macros for merging the declarations  back  into
              the source code.

              The <b>ftnchek</b> distribution includes a program, <b>dcl2inc</b>, which processes declaration files to produce
              files  containing  declarations of all COMMON blocks, in a form suitable for use as INCLUDE files.
              See the <b><a href="../man1L/dcl2inc.1L.html">dcl2inc</a></b>(1L) man page for the details of its use.

              See also: <b>-mkhtml</b>.

       <b>-mkhtml=</b><u>list</u>
              Produce HTML documentation from source. Creates individual HTML files from  ftnchek  analysis  and
              code  comments.  All  comments  immediately  preceding  and  following  the function or subroutine
              definition are captured to the HTML file. No reformatting of source comments  is  performed  other
              than  stripping  of  FORTRAN  comment  characters.   In  addition,  the  HTML file lists the local
              variables declared, common block variables used, functions and subroutines called, I/O unit usage,
              and other information about each subprogram.  Usually you will also want to specify <b>-call=tree</b>  to
              create the root HTML file CallTree.html.  (Perhaps this file should be named index.html.)

              Various  options  for  the  form  of  the HTML files are controlled by the <u>list</u>, which consists of
              keywords separated by commas or colons.  There are three special keywords: <b>all</b> to turn on all  the
              options,  <b>none</b>  to  turn them all off, and <b>help</b> to print the list of all the keywords with a brief
              explanation of each.  If <u>list</u> is omitted, <b>-mkhtml</b> is equivalent to <b>-mkhtml=documents</b> (i.e. produce
              the HTML document files using the default options), and <b>-nomkhtmls</b> is equivalent to <b>-mkhtml=none</b>.

              For the sake of simplicity, the options for <b>-mkhtml</b> are the same as those for <b>-makedcls</b> except for
              those that are inapplicable.  Likewise,  a numeric form of this setting can be used, formed as the
              sum of the numbers in parentheses in the list below.  The warning keywords with their meanings are
              as follows:

              <b>documents</b> (1):
                    Create the HTML documents.  (This is implied by any of the other options, and can be omitted
                    if any other options are given.)

              <b>compact</b> (4):
                    The declarations are normally prettyprinted to line  up  neatly  in  common  columns.   This
                    option value selects instead compact output, without column alignment.

              <b>use-continuation-lines</b> (8):
                    Causes  continuation  lines  to be used instead of beginning a new declaration on each line.
                    This option is appropriate to use together with <b>compact</b>.

              <b>keywords-lowercase</b> (16):
                    Output Fortran keywords in lowercase, instead of the default uppercase.

              <b>vars-and-consts-lowercase</b> (32):
                    Output variables and constants in lowercase, instead of the default  uppercase.    Character
                    string constants are not affected by this option.

              <b>exclude-sftran3</b> (64):
                    Omit  declarations  of  internal  integer  variables  produced  by the SFTRAN3 preprocessor,
                    <b><a href="../man1L/xsf3.1L.html">xsf3</a></b>(1L).  (See <b>-makedcls</b> for discussion.)

              <b>suppress-array-dimensions</b> (512):
                    Suppress  dimensioning  of  arrays  in  the  generated  declarations.   This   is   normally
                    undesirable,  but  is  available  if for some reason you do not want the array dimensions to
                    appear in the HTML.

              <b>free-form</b> (1024):
                    Produce variable declarations in free source form.  This mode is automatically used  if  the
                    input  source  is free form.  This mainly affects the form of continuation lines if they are
                    used.

              See also: <b>-calltree</b>, <b>-makedcls</b>.

       <b>-novice</b>
              This flag is intended to provide more helpful output for beginners.  It has two effects:

              (a) provides an extra message to the effect that a function that is used but not defined  anywhere
                  might  be an array which the user forgot to declare in a DIMENSION statement (since the syntax
                  of an array reference is the same as that of a function reference).

              (b) modifies the form of the error messages and warnings.  If the flag is turned off by <b>-nonovice</b>,
                  these messages are printed in a style more resembling UNIX <b>lint</b>.

              Default = yes.

       <b>-output=</b><u>filename</u>
              This setting is provided for convenience on systems which do not allow easy redirection of  output
              from  programs.   When this setting is given, the output which normally appears on the screen will
              be sent instead to the named file.  Note, however, that operational errors of <b>ftnchek</b> itself (e.g.
              out of space or cannot open file) will still be  sent  to  the  screen.   The  extension  for  the
              filename is optional, and if no extension is given, the extension <u>.lis</u> will be used.

       <b>-pointersize=</b><u>num</u>
              Specifies the size of a ``Cray pointer'' variable to be <u>num</u> bytes.  Default = turn-on = 4 bytes.

              The  pointer  size  is used to inform precision mismatch warnings involving pointer variables, for
              example when a pointer is assigned a value from an allocation routine, or passed as  a  subprogram
              parameter.

              See also: <b>-f77</b>, <b>-portability</b>, <b>-truncation</b>, <b>-wordsize</b>.

       <b>-portability=</b><u>list</u>
              <b>ftnchek</b> will give warnings for a variety of non-portable usages.  Examples include the use of tabs
              except  in  comments  or  inside strings, the use of Hollerith constants, and the equivalencing of
              variables of different data types.  This option does not produce warnings for supported extensions
              to the Fortran 77 Standard, which may also cause portability problems.  To catch  those,  use  the
              <b>-f77</b> setting.  By default, all warnings are turned off.

              This setting provides detailed control over the warnings about possible portability problems.  The
              <u>list</u> consists of keywords separated by commas or colons.  There are three special keywords: <b>all</b> to
              turn  on  all  the warnings about nonportable usages, <b>none</b> to turn them all off, and <b>help</b> to print
              the list of all the keywords with a brief explanation of each.  If <u>list</u> is  omitted,  <b>-portability</b>
              is  equivalent  to  <b>-portability=all</b>,  and <b>-noportability</b> is equivalent to <b>-portability=none</b>.  The
              warning keywords with their meanings are as follows:

              <b>backslash</b>:
                    Backslash character in strings.  Since some compilers  treat  the  backslash  as  an  escape
                    character,  its  presence can cause problems even though it is used in a standard-conforming
                    way.

              <b>common-alignment</b>:
                    COMMON block variables not in descending order of storage size.  Some compilers require this
                    ordering because of storage alignment requirements.

              <b>hollerith</b>:
                    Hollerith constants (other than within FORMAT specifications).  The Hollerith data type is a
                    feature of Fortran IV that has been deleted in the Fortran 77 standard.  It is superseded by
                    the character data type.  Storing Hollerith data in variables of a numeric or  logical  data
                    type is nonportable due to differing word sizes.

              <b>long-string</b>:
                    String constants, variables, or expressions over 255 chars long.

              <b>mixed-equivalence</b>:
                    Variables of different data types equivalenced.

              <b>mixed-size</b>:
                    Variables  declared  with default precision used with variables given explicit precision, in
                    expressions, assignments, or as arguments.  For example, if a variable declared as REAL*8 is
                    treated as equivalent to DOUBLE PRECISION.

              <b>real-do</b>:
                    Non-integer DO loop index and bounds.  These can cause a program's results to depend on  the
                    hardware characteristics of the particular computer used.

              <b>param-implicit-type</b>:
                    Implicit  typing  of  a parameter by the data type of the value assigned, if it differs from
                    the default type.  This warning can only occur if implicit parameter typing has been  turned
                    on  by  the  <b>-source=param-implicit-type</b>  option,  or  if  the PARAMETER statement is of the
                    nonstandard form without parentheses.  If this option is turned on, then any instances where
                    implicit parameter typing occurs and where the implicit type is different from  the  default
                    type  based  on  the  first  letter  of  the parameter name, will be warned about.  Implicit
                    parameter typing can change the semantics of statements where the parameter is used, causing
                    portability problems.

              <b>tab</b>:  Tabs in source code.  Tabs are interpreted differently by different compilers.  This warning
                    will be given only once, at the end of the file.

              See also: <b>-f77</b>, <b>-f90</b>, <b>-f95</b>, <b>-pretty</b>, <b>-style</b>, <b>-wordsize</b>.

       <b>-pretty=</b><u>list</u>
              Controls certain messages related to the appearance of the source code.  These warn  about  things
              that  might  make a program less readable or be deceptive to the reader.  By default, all warnings
              are turned on.

              This setting provides detailed control over the warnings about appearance.  The <u>list</u>  consists  of
              keywords  separated  by commas or colons.  Since all warnings are on by default, include a keyword
              prefixed by <b>no-</b> to turn off a particular warning.  There are three special keywords: <b>all</b>  to  turn
              on all the warnings about misleading appearances, <b>none</b> to turn them all off, and <b>help</b> to print the
              list  of  all  the  keywords  with  a  brief  explanation of each.  If <u>list</u> is omitted, <b>-pretty</b> is
              equivalent to <b>-pretty=all</b>, and <b>-nopretty</b> is equivalent to <b>-pretty=none</b>.  The warning keywords with
              their meanings are as follows:

              <b>alternate-return</b>:
                    A RETURN statement has a constant specifying an alternate return point that is not between 0
                    and the number of dummy arguments that are labels.  This is legal, and has the  same  effect
                    as  a  RETURN with no alternate return expression, but suggests that the programmer intended
                    to use an alternate return label that is not provided.

              <b>embedded-space</b>:
                    Space embedded in variable names or in multi-character operators such as **.

              <b>continuation</b>:
                    Continuation mark following a comment line.

              <b>long-line</b>:
                    Lines (except comments) over  72  columns  in  width  (beyond  72  is  normally  ignored  by
                    compiler).

              <b>missing-space</b>:
                    Lack of space between variable and a preceding keyword.

              <b>multiple-common</b>:
                    COMMON  block  declared  in  multiple statements.  No warning is given if the statements are
                    consecutive except for comment lines.

              <b>multiple-namelist</b>:
                    NAMELIST declared in multiple statements.   No  warning  is  given  if  the  statements  are
                    consecutive except for comment lines.

              <b>parentheses</b>:
                    Parentheses  around a variable by itself.  As a subprogram argument, this makes the argument
                    an expression, not modifiable by the subprogram.

              Note that in free source form, extra space and missing space  are  forbidden  by  the  Fortran  90
              Standard,  and  are  not  mere style violations.  In this case the warnings are replaced by syntax
              error messages, and can be turned off only by using <b>-nocheck</b>.

              See also: <b>-f77</b>, <b>-portability</b>, <b>-style</b>.

       <b>-project=</b><u>list</u>
              <b>ftnchek</b> will create a project file from each source file that is input while this option is turned
              on.  The project file will be given the same name as the input file, but with the extension <u>.f</u>  or
              <u>.for</u>  replaced by <u>.prj</u>.  (If input is from standard input, the project file is named <u>ftnchek.prj</u>.)
              Default = none.

              The <u>list</u> consists of keywords separated by commas or colons.  There are  three  special  keywords:
              <b>all</b>  to  turn on all the options, <b>none</b> to turn them all off, and <b>help</b> to print the list of all the
              keywords with a brief explanation of  each.   If  <u>list</u>  is  omitted,  <b>-project</b>  is  equivalent  to
              <b>-project=all</b>, and <b>-noproject</b> is equivalent to <b>-project=none</b>.  The keywords with their meanings are
              as follows:

              <b>create</b>:
                    Produce  a  project  file.  The default is not to produce a project file.  If this option is
                    not turned on, the other options have no effect.

              <b>trim-calls</b>:
                    Trim the amount of information stored in the project file about subprogram declarations  and
                    calls.  This is the default.  Turn this option off only in rare situations.  (See discussion
                    below.)   The amount of trimming varies depending on the <b>-library</b> flag.  More information is
                    trimmed if that flag is turned on.

              <b>trim-common</b>:
                    Trim the number of common block declarations stored  in  the  project  file.   This  is  the
                    default.   Turn  this  option  off  only  in rare situations.  (See discussion below.)  This
                    option has no effect if the <b>-library</b> flag is turned  off:  when  not  in  library  mode,  no
                    trimming of common block declarations is done regardless of this option.

              A  project  file  contains  a  summary  of  information  from the source file, for use in checking
              agreement among FUNCTION, SUBROUTINE, and COMMON usages in other  files.   It  allows  incremental
              checking,  which  saves time whenever you have a large set of files containing shared subroutines,
              most of which seldom change.  You can run <b>ftnchek</b> once on each file with the  <b>-project</b>  flag  set,
              creating  the  project files.  Usually you would also set the <b>-library</b> and <b>-noextern</b> flags at this
              time, to suppress messages  relating  to  consistency  with  other  files.   Only  error  messages
              pertaining  to  each file by itself will be printed at this time.  Thereafter, run <b>ftnchek</b> without
              these flags on all the project files together, to check consistency  among  the  different  files.
              All  messages  internal  to the individual files will now be omitted.  Only when a file is altered
              will a new project file need to be made for it.

              Naturally, when the <b>-project</b> option is turned on, <b>ftnchek</b> will not read project files as input.

              Ordinarily, the trim options should be left on when you intend to create project files for  future
              input  to  <b>ftnchek</b>.   Since  trimming  is on by default, this means that simply giving the command
              <b>-project</b> with no option list is the recommended mode.  The trim options are  provided  only  as  a
              convenience  for  those who want to make use of project files for purposes other than checking the
              program with <b>ftnchek</b>.  To use project files for their intended purpose, the  trim  options  should
              not be turned off.

              Project  files  contain  only information needed for checking agreement between files.  This means
              that a project file is of no use if all modules of the complete program are contained in a  single
              file.

              A more detailed discussion is given in the section on Using Project Files.

       <b>-pure</b>
              Assume  functions are ``pure'', i.e., they will not have side effects by modifying their arguments
              or variables in a COMMON block.  When this flag is in effect, <b>ftnchek</b> will base its  determination
              of  set  and  used  status  of  the  actual arguments on the assumption that arguments passed to a
              function are not altered.  It will also issue a warning if a function is found to  modify  any  of
              its arguments or any COMMON variables.  Default = yes.

              When this flag is turned off, actual arguments passed to functions will be handled the same way as
              actual arguments passed to subroutines.  This means that <b>ftnchek</b> will assume that arguments may be
              modified by the functions.  No warnings will be given if a function is found to have side effects.
              Because  stricter  checking  is possible if functions are assumed to be pure, you should turn this
              flag off only if your program actually uses functions with side effects.

       <b>-quiet</b>
              This option reduces the amount of output relating to normal operation, so that error messages  are
              more apparent.  This option is provided for the convenience of users who are checking large suites
              of  files.   The  eliminated output includes the names of project files, and the message reporting
              that no syntax errors were found.  It  also  eliminates  some  blank  lines  that  are  ordinarily
              included  for  clarity.  (Some of this output is turned back on by the <b>-list</b> and <b>-symtab</b> options.)
              Default = no.

              Note: the way to remember the difference  between the <b>-quiet</b> and <b>-brief</b>  is  that  <b>-quiet</b>  doesn't
              suppress any warning-related information, whereas <b>-brief</b> does.

              See also: <b>-brief</b>.

       <b>-reference</b>
              Specifies  that  a who-calls-who table be printed.  This table lists each subprogram followed by a
              list of the routines it calls.  This switch is equivalent to <b>-calltree=reference</b>.  Default = no.

              The reference list omits routines called by unused library modules.  Thus  it  contains  the  same
              information  as for the call-tree format, namely the hierarchy of subprogram calls, but printed in
              a  different  way.   This  prints  out  a  breadth-first  traversal  of  the  call  tree   whereas
              <b>-calltree=tree</b> prints out a depth-first traversal.

              See also: <b>-calltree</b>, <b>-crossref</b>, <b>-library</b>, <b>-sort</b>, <b>-symtab</b>, <b>-vcg</b>.

       <b>-resources</b>
              Prints  the  amount  of  resources used by <b>ftnchek</b> in processing the program.  This listing may be
              useful in analyzing the size and complexity of a program.  It can also  help  in  choosing  larger
              sizes  for  <b>ftnchek</b>'s  internal  tables  if  they  are  too small to analyze a particular program.
              Default = no.

              In this listing, the term ``chunk size'' is the size of the blocks of memory  allocated  to  store
              the  item  in  question,  in  units  of  the size of one item, not necessarily in bytes.  When the
              initially allocated space is filled up, more memory is allocated in  chunks  of  this  size.   The
              following is an explanation of the items printed:

              <u>Source</u> <u>lines</u> <u>processed:</u>
                  Total  number  of  lines  of code, with separate totals for statement lines and comment lines.
                  Comment lines include lines with 'C' or '*' in column 1 as  well  as  blank  lines  and  lines
                  containing  only an inline comment.  Statement lines are all other lines, including lines that
                  have an inline comment following some code.  Continuation lines are counted as separate lines.
                  Lines in include files are counted each time the file is included.

              <u>Total</u> <u>executable</u> <u>statements:</u>
                  Number of statements in the  program,  other  than  specification,  data,  statement-function,
                  FORMAT, ENTRY, and END statements.

              <u>Total</u> <u>number</u> <u>of</u> <u>modules:</u>
                  A  module  is any external subprogram, including the main program, subroutines, functions, and
                  block data units.  This count is of modules defined within the source, not modules referenced.
                  Statement functions are not included.  A subprogram with multiple entry points is only counted
                  once.

              <u>Total</u> <u>statement</u> <u>labels</u> <u>defined</u>
                  Number of labels attached to statements (often called statement  numbers).   The  total  label
                  count for the entire program is given, as well as the maximum number in any single subprogram.

              <u>Max</u> <u>identifier</u> <u>name</u> <u>chars:</u>
                  Number  of  characters  used  for  storing  identifier  names.   An  identifier is a variable,
                  subprogram, or common block name.  Local names are those of local variables in  a  subprogram,
                  whereas  global  names  refer  to subprogram and common block names, as well as dummy argument
                  names and common variable names.  Actual argument text (up to 15 characters for each argument)
                  is also included here.  The space used for local names is not recovered at  the  end  of  each
                  module,  so  this  number,  like  global  space,  grows  until  the whole program is analyzed.
                  Unfortunately, this figure may include some text stored more than once, although  a  heuristic
                  is used that will avoid duplicates in many cases.

              <u>Max</u> <u>token</u> <u>text</u> <u>chars:</u>
                  A  token  is the smallest syntactic unit of the FORTRAN language above the level of individual
                  characters. For instance a token can be a variable name, a numerical constant, a  quoted  text
                  string,  or  a punctuation character.  Token text is stored while a module is being processed.
                  For technical reasons, single-character tokens are not included in this total.  Items that are
                  not represented in the symbol table may be duplicated.  The space for token text is  recovered
                  at the end of each module, so this figure represents the maximum for any one module.

              <u>Max</u> <u>local</u> <u>symbols:</u>
                  This  is the largest number of entries in the local symbol table for any module.  Local symbol
                  table entries include all variables and parameters, common block names,  statement  functions,
                  external  subprograms and intrinsic functions referenced by the module.  Literal constants are
                  not stored in the local symbol table.

              <u>Max</u> <u>global</u> <u>symbols:</u>
                  This is the number of entries in the global symbol table at the  end  of  processing.   Global
                  symbol  table entries include external subprogram and common block names.  Intrinsic functions
                  and statement functions are not included.

              <u>Max</u> <u>number</u> <u>of</u> <u>tokenlists:</u>
                  A token list is a sequence of tokens representing the actual  or  dummy  argument  list  of  a
                  subprogram,  or  the  list  of variables in a common block or namelist.  Therefore this number
                  represents the largest sum of  COMMON,  CALL,  NAMELIST  and  ENTRY  statements  and  function
                  invocations for any one module.  The space is recovered at the end of each module.

              <u>Max</u> <u>token</u> <u>list/tree</u> <u>space:</u>
                  This is the largest number of tokens in all the token lists and token trees of any one module.
                  A  token  tree is formed when analyzing an expression: each operand is a leaf of the tree, and
                  the operators are the nodes.  Therefore this number is a measure of the maximum complexity  of
                  an individual module.  For instance a module with many long arithmetic expressions will have a
                  high number.  Note that unlike token text described above, the number of tokens is independent
                  of the length of the variable names or literal constants in the expressions.

              <u>Number</u> <u>of</u> <u>subprogram</u> <u>invocations:</u>
                  This  is  the  sum  over all modules of the number of CALL statements and function invocations
                  (except intrinsic functions and statement functions).

              <u>Number</u> <u>of</u> <u>common</u> <u>block</u> <u>decls:</u>
                  This is the sum over all modules of the number of common block declarations.   That  is,  each
                  declaration  of  a  block  in  a different module is counted separately.  (The standard allows
                  multiple declarations of a block within the  same  module;  these  are  counted  as  only  one
                  declaration since they are equivalent to a single long declaration.)

              <u>Number</u> <u>of</u> <u>array</u> <u>dim</u> <u>&amp;</u> <u>param</u> <u>ptrs:</u>
                  This  is  the  sum  over all modules of the number of array dimension and parameter definition
                  text strings saved for use by the <b>-makedcls</b> option.  The length of the  text  strings  is  not
                  counted.  Each dimension of a multidimensional array is counted separately.

              These  numbers  are  obviously  not  the same when project files are used in place of the original
              source code.  Even the numbers  for  global  entities  may  be  different,  since  some  redundant
              information is eliminated in project files.

       <b>-sixchar</b>
              One  of the goals of the <b>ftnchek</b> program is to help users to write portable Fortran programs.  One
              potential source of nonportability is  the  use  of  variable  names  that  are  longer  than  six
              characters.   Some  compilers  just  ignore the extra characters.  This behavior could potentially
              lead to two different variables being considered as  the  same.   For  instance,  variables  named
              AVERAGECOST  and AVERAGEPRICE are the same in the first six characters.  If you wish to catch such
              possible conflicts, use this flag.  Default = no.

              Use the <b>-f77=long-names</b> if you want to list <u>all</u> variables longer than  six  characters,  not  just
              those pairs that are the same in the first six.

              See also: <b>-f77</b>, <b>-portability</b>.

       <b>-sort</b>
              Specifies  that  a  sorted  list  of  all modules used in the program be printed.  This list is in
              ``prerequisite'' order, i.e. each module is printed only after all the modules from  which  it  is
              called  have  been  printed.   This  is also called a ``topological sort'' of the call tree.  Each
              module is listed only once.  Routines that are not in the  call  tree  of  the  main  program  are
              omitted.   If  there  are  any cycles in the call graph (illegal in standard Fortran) they will be
              detected and diagnosed.  Default = no.

              See also: <b>-calltree</b>, <b>-crossref</b>, <b>-reference</b>, <b>-symtab</b>, <b>-vcg</b>.

       <b>-source=</b><u>list</u>
              This setting controls certain options about the  form  of  the  Fortran  source  code.   The  <u>list</u>
              consists of keywords separated by commas or colons.  There are three special keywords: <b>all</b> to turn
              on all the options, <b>none</b> to turn them all off, and <b>help</b> to print the list of all the keywords with
              a  brief  explanation  of  each.   If  <u>list</u>  is omitted, <b>-source</b> is equivalent to <b>-source=all</b>, and
              <b>-nosource</b> is equivalent to <b>-source=none</b>.

              For compatibility with previous versions of <b>ftnchek</b>, a  numeric  form  of  this  setting  is  also
              accepted:   the <u>list</u> is replaced by a number which is the sum of the numbers in parentheses beside
              the keywords in the following list.  (The <b>fixed</b> and <b>free</b> options do not have numeric values.)  The
              warning keywords with their meanings are as follows:

              <b>fixed</b>:
                    Interpret the source as fixed form (with supported extensions such as exclamation  mark  for
                    comments).  Statements must be in columns 7 to 72 (unless the <b>-cols</b> setting has been used to
                    change  this),  and  blanks  are not significant outside character context (but warned about
                    under the <b>-pretty</b> option).  This is the default mode unless the  source  file  extension  is
                    <u>.f90</u> or <u>.F90</u>.  this option cannot be given together with <b>-source=free</b>.

              <b>free</b>: Interpret the source as free form.  Statements may be anywhere in columns 1 to 132, comments
                    can  only  begin  with  an  exclamation mark, and blanks are required in some places such as
                    between identifiers and keywords.  This is the default mode if the source file extension  is
                    <u>.f90</u> or <u>.F90</u>.  This option cannot be given together with <b>-source=fixed</b> or <b>-source=dec-tab</b>

              <b>dec-tab</b> (1):
                    Accept DEC-style tab-formatted source.  A line beginning with an initial tab will be treated
                    as a new statement line unless the character after the tab is a nonzero digit, in which case
                    it is treated as a continuation line.  The next column after the tab or continuation mark is
                    taken as column 7.  A warning will be given in the case where the line is a continuation, if
                    <b>-f77=dec-tab</b> is in effect.

              <b>vms-include</b> (2):
                    Accept VMS-style INCLUDE statements.  These follow the normal syntax, but with the following
                    additional  features: (1) the file extension, if not given, defaults to the same as a normal
                    source file extension; and (2) the option /LIST or /NOLIST can be appended to  the  include-
                    file name, to control listing of its contents.

              <b>unix-backslash</b> (4):
                    Handle UNIX-style backslash escapes in character strings.  The escape sequence following the
                    backslash  will  be  evaluated  according to the ANSI standard for strings in C: up to three
                    digits signify an octal value, an x signifies the start of a hexadecimal  constant,  any  of
                    the  letters  a  b f n r t signify special control codes, and any other character (including
                    newline) signifies the character itself.  When this source  code  option  is  in  effect,  a
                    warning will be given if the <b>-f77=backslash</b> setting is specified.

                    The  default  behavior  is  to  treat  the  backslash like any other normal character, but a
                    warning about portability will be generated if the <b>-portability</b> flag is set.  Because of the
                    fact that some compilers treat the backslash in  a  nonstandard  way,  it  is  possible  for
                    standard-conforming  programs  to  be  non-portable  if  they use the backslash character in
                    strings.

                    Since <b>ftnchek</b> does not do much with the interpreted string, it is seldom  necessary  to  use
                    this option.  It is needed in order to avoid spurious warnings only if (a) the program being
                    checked uses backslash to embed an apostrophe or quote mark in a string instead of using the
                    standard  mechanism  of doubling the delimiter; (b) the backslash is used to escape the end-
                    of-line in order to continue a string across multiple  source  lines;  or  (c)  a  PARAMETER
                    definition uses an intrinsic string function such as LEN with such a string as argument, and
                    that value is later used to define array dimensions, etc.

              <b>param-implicit-type</b> (8):
                    Implicit  typing  of  a parameter by the data type of the value assigned.  Some non-standard
                    compilers may allow the data type of the value to override the Fortran 77 default type of  a
                    parameter that is based on the first letter of the parameter name.  This option only applies
                    to  PARAMETER  statements  of the standard form which has parentheses.  A parameter that has
                    been explicitly declared in a type  statement  prior  to  the  PARAMETER  statement  is  not
                    affected  by  this  option.   A  warning will be given under the <b>-f77=param-implicit-type</b> or
                    <b>-portability=param-implicit-type</b> option.

                    Note that this implicit typing is treated as equivalent to an explicit type declaration  for
                    the  parameter.   Therefore,  if  you use <b>-makedcls=undeclared-only</b> to generate declarations
                    only of undeclared variables, these parameters will <u>not</u> be included.

              <b>dec-param-standard-type</b> (16):
                    Follow the Fortran 77 rule for data typing of  DEC  Fortran  style  parameters.   These  are
                    declared  using  a  nonstandard  form  of  the  PARAMETER statement which lacks parentheses.
                    According to DEC Fortran, parameters defined by this form of the statement have  their  data
                    type  given  by the data type of the value assigned.  Use this option to tell <b>ftnchek</b> not to
                    follow this rule but instead to use the same rule  as  for  standard  PARAMETER  statements.
                    This option does not apply to PARAMETER statements of the standard form.

              By default, all these source code options are turned off, except for the <b>vms-include</b> option, which
              is on by default in the VMS version..

              See also: <b>-f77</b>, <b>-include</b>, <b>-portability</b>.

       <b>-style=</b><u>list</u>
              Provides  extra-picky warnings about obsolescent or old-fashioned programming constructions.  This
              option is helpful for efforts  to  follow  a  modern  programming  style.   (Most  of  the  things
              complained  about  under  this  option  are  forbidden in the <b>F</b> <b>subset</b> <b>language.)</b>  <b>By</b> <b>default,</b> <b>all</b>
              <b>warnings</b> <b>are</b> <b>turned</b> <b>off.</b>

              The <u>list</u> consists of keywords separated by commas or colons.  There are  three  special  keywords:
              <b>all</b>  to  turn on all the options, <b>none</b> to turn them all off, and <b>help</b> to print the list of all the
              keywords with a brief  explanation  of  each.   If  <u>list</u>  is  omitted,  <b>-style</b>  is  equivalent  to
              <b>-style=all</b>,  and  <b>-nostyle</b> is equivalent to <b>-style=none</b>.  The warning keywords with their meanings
              are as follows:

              <b>block-if</b>:
                    Complain about arithmetic IF statement.  Accept block IF or logical  IF  (which  controls  a
                    single statement).

              <b>construct-name</b>:
                    Complain  about unnamed block constructs: IF, DO, and SELECT CASE.  Note that if a construct
                    name is present on the opening statement of a construct, then it is required to  be  present
                    on  all  other  component  statements (ELSE, END IF, etc.) of the construct.  In that case a
                    missing construct name on those statements generates  a  syntax  error  regardless  of  this
                    option.   The  purpose  of  this  option  is  to  warn if the construct completely lacks the
                    optional name.

              <b>distinct-do</b>:
                    Complain if two DO loops share a common terminator statement.

              <b>do-construct</b>:
                    Complain if terminator of a DO loop is anything other than an END DO or CONTINUE  statement.
                    This  is  the  requirement  in order for the loop to meet the Fortran 90 definition of a do-
                    construct.

              <b>do-enddo</b>:
                    Complain if terminator of a DO loop is anything other  than  an  END  DO  statement.   (This
                    option overrides the <b>do-construct</b> option, being even stricter.)

              <b>end-name</b>:
                    Complain about the absence of the subprogram name on structured END statements.

              <b>format-stmt</b>:
                    Complain about the presence of FORMAT statements.  Only the FORMAT statements themselves are
                    flagged, not the references to them in I/O lists.

              <b>goto</b>: Complain  about  the  presence of unconditional, computed or assigned GOTO statements.  Also
                    complain about alternate returns (but not about labels as subprogram arguments).

              <b>labeled-stmt</b>:
                    Complain about the presence of labels (numbers) on statements other than FORMAT  statements.
                    (Since  FORMAT  statements  are arguably convenient and not readily abused, complaints about
                    them are controlled by the separate <b>format-stmt</b> keyword.)

              <b>program-stmt</b>:
                    Complain about the absence of a PROGRAM statement at the head of the main program.

              <b>structured-end</b>:
                    Complain about the use of a  plain  END  statement  to  end  a  subprogram,  rather  than  a
                    structured END statement (END PROGRAM, END SUBROUTINE, END FUNCTION, or END BLOCK DATA).

       <b>-symtab</b>
              A  symbol  table  will  be  printed  out for each module, listing all identifiers mentioned in the
              module.  This table gives the name of each variable, its datatype, and the  number  of  dimensions
              for  arrays.   An  asterisk (*) indicates that the variable has been implicitly typed, rather than
              being named in an explicit type declaration statement.   The  table  also  lists  all  subprograms
              invoked by the module, all COMMON blocks declared, etc.  Default = no.

              Also,  for  each module, a label table will be printed.  The table lists each label defined in the
              module; the line on which said statement label is defined; and  the  statement  type  (executable,
              format, or specification).  The labels are listed in sequential order.

              Also  printed  is  a  table describing the I/O units used by the module, together with information
              about how they are used: what operations are  performed,  whether  the  access  is  sequential  or
              direct, and whether the I/O is formatted or unformatted.

       <b>-truncation=</b><u>list</u>
              Warn  about  possible  truncation  (or  roundoff)  errors.   Most  of these are related to integer
              arithmetic.  By default, all warnings are turned on.

              This setting provides detailed control over the warnings about possible  truncation  errors.   The
              <u>list</u>  consists  of  keywords separated by commas or colons.  Since all warnings are on by default,
              include a keyword prefixed by <b>no-</b> to turn off a  particular  warning.   There  are  three  special
              keywords: <b>all</b> to turn on all the warnings about truncation, <b>none</b> to turn them all off, and <b>help</b> to
              print  the  list  of  all  the  keywords  with  a  brief explanation of each.  If <u>list</u> is omitted,
              <b>-truncation</b> is equivalent to <b>-truncation=all</b>, and <b>-notruncation</b> is equivalent to <b>-truncation=none</b>.
              The warning keywords with their meanings are as follows:

              <b>int-div-exponent</b>:
                    use of the result of integer division as an exponent.  This suggests that a real quotient is
                    intended.  An example would be writing X**(1/3) to evaluate the cube root of X. The  correct
                    expression is X**(1./3.).

              <b>int-div-real</b>:
                    Conversion  of  an  expression  involving an integer division to real.  This suggests that a
                    real quotient is intended.

              <b>int-div-zero</b>:
                    division in an integer constant expression that yields a result of zero.

              <b>int-neg-power</b>:
                    exponentiation of an integer by a negative  integer  (which  yields  zero  unless  the  base
                    integer is 1 in magnitude).  This suggests that a real base is intended.

              <b>promotion</b>:
                    automatic  conversion of a lower precision quantity to one of higher precision.  The loss of
                    accuracy for real variables in this process is comparable to the corresponding demotion.  No
                    warning is given for promotion of integer quantities to real since this is ordinarily exact.

              <b>real-do-index</b>:
                    use of a non-integer DO index in a loop with integer bounds.  An integer DO index with  real
                    bounds is always warned about regardless of this setting.

              <b>real-subscript</b>:
                    use of a non-integer array subscript.

              <b>significant-figures</b>:
                    overspecifying  a  single  precision  constant.   This  may indicate that a double precision
                    constant was intended.

              <b>size-demotion</b>:
                    automatic conversion of a higher precision quantity to one of lower precision  of  the  same
                    type.   This  warning only occurs when an explicit size is used in declaring the type of one
                    or both operands in an assignment.  For example, a warning wil  be  issued  where  a  REAL*8
                    variable  is  assigned  to  a  REAL  variable, if the default wordsize of 4 is in effect.  A
                    warning is also issued if a long integer is assigned to a shorter one, for  example,  if  an
                    INTEGER  expression  is  assigned  to an INTEGER*2 variable.  There is one exception to this
                    last case, namely if the right hand side of the assignment is a small literal constant (less
                    than 128).  <b>type-demotion</b>: automatic conversion of a higher precision  quantity  to  one  of
                    lower  precision  of different type.  This warning includes conversion of real quantities to
                    integer, double precision to single precision real, and assignment  of  a  longer  character
                    string to a shorter one.

              The  warnings  about  promotion  and  demotion  also  apply  to complex constants, considering the
              precision to be that of the real or imaginary part.  Warnings about promotions and  demotions  are
              given only when the conversion is done automatically, e.g. in expressions of mixed precision or in
              an  assignment  statement.  If intrinsic functions such as INT are used to perform the conversion,
              no warning is given.

              See also: <b>-portability</b>, <b>-wordsize</b>.

       <b>-usage=</b><u>list</u>
              Warn about unused or possible uninitialized variables, unused common blocks, undefined  or  unused
              statement labels, and unused or undefined subprograms.  By default, all warnings are turned on.

              This  setting  provides  detailed control over the warnings about possible usage errors.  The <u>list</u>
              consists of keywords separated by commas or colons.  Since all warnings are on by default, include
              a keyword prefixed by <b>no-</b> to turn off a particular warning.  There are three special keywords: <b>all</b>
              to turn on all the warnings about usage, <b>none</b> to turn them all off, and <b>help</b> to print the list  of
              all  the  keywords  with a brief explanation of each.  If <u>list</u> is omitted, <b>-usage</b> is equivalent to
              <b>-usage=all</b>, and <b>-nousage</b> is equivalent to <b>-usage=none</b>.  These warnings cover four main  categories
              of  objects:  subprogram  dummy arguments, common blocks and variables, subprograms and functions,
              and local variables.  Warnings include undefined items, multiply defined items, unused items, etc.
              The warning keywords with their meanings are as follows:

              <b>arg-alias</b>:
                    a scalar dummy argument is actually the same as another and is (or may  be)  modified.   The
                    Fortran  77  standard  (section 15.9.3.6) prohibits modifying an argument that is aliased to
                    another.

              <b>arg-array-alias</b>:
                    a dummy argument which is an array or array element is in the same array as another  and  is
                    modified.   This  flag  is  similar  to  <b>arg-alias</b>  but provides separate control over array
                    arguments.  It is harder to tell if aliasing is occurring in  the  case  of  arrays,  so  if
                    <b>ftnchek</b>  gives too many false warnings, this flag allows the array-related ones to be turned
                    off without suppressing the warnings for scalars.

              <b>arg-common-alias</b>:
                    a scalar dummy argument is the same as a common variable in the subprogram,  and  either  is
                    modified.   This  is  also prohibited by the Fortran 77 standard.  If common checking is not
                    exact (see the <b>-common</b> setting), it is harder to tell  if  aliasing  is  occurring,  so  the
                    warning  is  given  if  the  variable  is anywhere in a common block that is declared by the
                    subprogram.

              <b>arg-common-array-alias</b>:
                    a dummy argument which is an array or array element  is  in  the  same  array  as  a  common
                    variable,  and  either  is  modified.   If common checking is not exact, the variable can be
                    anywhere in a common block that is declared by the subprogram.

              <b>arg-const-modified</b>:
                    a subprogram modifies an argument which is a constant or  an  expression.   Such  an  action
                    could cause anomalous behavior of the program.

              <b>arg-unused</b>:
                    a  dummy  argument  is  declared  but never used.  This is similar to the <b>var-unused</b> keyword
                    described below, but applies only to arguments.

              <b>com-block-unused</b>:
                    a common block is declared but none of the variables in it are used by any subprogram.  This
                    warning is suppressed if the common strictness setting is 0.

              <b>com-block-volatile</b>:
                    a common block may lose the definition of its contents if common blocks are volatile.   This
                    option  only has an effect if the <b>-common=volatile</b> flag is in effect.  See the discussion of
                    the <b>-common</b> setting above.

              <b>com-var-set-unused</b>:
                    a common variable is assigned a value, but its value is not used by  any  subprogram.   This
                    warning is suppressed if the common strictness setting is 0.

              <b>com-var-uninitialized</b>:
                    a   common  variable's  value  is  used  in  some  subprogram,  but  is  not  set  anywhere.
                    Unfortunately, <b>ftnchek</b> does not do a thorough enough analysis of  the  calling  sequence  to
                    know  which  routines  are  called before others.  So warnings about this type of error will
                    only be given for cases in which a variable is used in some routine but not set in any other
                    routine.   Checking of individual COMMON variables is done only if the <b>-common</b> setting is  3
                    (variable  by  variable  agreement).   This  warning  is suppressed if the common strictness
                    setting is 0.

              <b>com-var-unused</b>:
                    a common variable is declared but not used by any subprogram.  This warning is suppressed if
                    the common strictness setting is 0.

              <b>do-index-modified</b>:
                    a variable that is the index of a DO loop is modified by some statement within the range  of
                    the  loop.   The  Standard  permits  an  active  DO  variable  to  be  modified  only by the
                    incrementation mechanism of the DO statement.

              <b>ext-multiply-defined</b>:
                    an external (a subroutine or function) is defined more than once.  Definition of an external
                    means providing the body of its source code.

              <b>ext-declared-only</b>:
                    a name is declared in an EXTERNAL statement in some module,  but  is  not  defined  or  used
                    anywhere.

              <b>ext-undefined</b>:
                    an  external  is  used (invoked) but not defined anywhere.  This option is equivalent to the
                    <b>-external</b> flag.  If the subprogram is invoked more than once, those invocations  will  still
                    be checked for consistency.

              <b>ext-unused</b>:
                    an external is defined (its subprogram body is present) but it is not used.  A subprogram is
                    considered  unused  even  if  it is invoked by some other subprogram, if it cannot be called
                    from any thread of  execution  starting  with  the  main  program.   The  agreement  of  the
                    subprogram's  arguments with its invocations is still checked even if this warning is turned
                    off.  If there is no main program, then this warning is issued only if the subprogram is not
                    invoked anywhere.  This warning is suppressed in library mode,  but  library  mode  has  the
                    additional effect of suppressing argument checking for unused routines.

              <b>label-undefined</b>:
                    a statement refers to a label that has not been defined.

              <b>label-unused</b>:
                    a statement label is defined, but never referred to.

              <b>var-set-unused</b>:
                    a local variable is assigned a value, but that value is not used.

              <b>var-uninitialized</b>:
                    a  local  variable's  value  may  be  used before it is assigned.  Sometimes <b>ftnchek</b> makes a
                    mistake in the warnings about local variable usage.  Usually it errs on the side of giving a
                    warning where no problem exists, but in rare cases it may fail to  warn  where  the  problem
                    does  exist.  See the section on Bugs for examples.  If variables are equivalenced, the rule
                    used by <b>ftnchek</b> is that a reference to any  variable  implies  the  same  reference  to  all
                    variables  it  is  equivalenced  to.   For arrays, the rule is that a reference to any array
                    element is treated as a reference to all elements of the array.

              <b>var-unused</b>:
                    a local variable is declared (for instance, in a type declaration) but is not  used  in  the
                    module.   Does  not  apply  to  dummy  arguments:  warnings about them are controlled by the
                    keyword <b>arg-unused</b> described above.

              Note: In versions of <b>ftnchek</b> prior to 2.10, the <b>-usage</b> flag took a numeric argument instead  of  a
              list of options.  For the sake of users who may have written scripts invoking <b>ftnchek</b> in this way,
              the  numeric  form is still accepted.  The numeric setting is composed of three digits.  The first
              digit (hundreds place) controls warnings about subprograms (functions and subroutines), the second
              digit (tens place) warnings about common blocks and common variables,, and the third  digit  (ones
              place)  warnings  about local variables.  Each digit controls warnings according to the convention
              that a 1 means warn about undefined items and variables that are used before set, a 2  means  warn
              about items that are unused, and a 3 means warn about both types.  These numbers are now converted
              to  the  appropriate values for the above-listed keywords, except for <b>com-block-volatile</b>, which is
              not affected by the numeric argument.

       <b>-vcg</b>
              Produce the call graph in the form of a VCG graph description.  This description is written  to  a
              separate  file, with the same stem as the file containing the main program, and suffix <u>.vcg</u>.  This
              file is able to be given directly to <b><a href="../man1L/xvcg.1L.html">xvcg</a></b>(1L) to visualize the call graph.  (If input is from  the
              standard input, then the graph description is sent to standard output.)  This switch is equivalent
              to <b>-calltree=vcg</b>.  Default = no.

              The  VCG  description  as  created  is  more complex than it need be. VCG allows graphs and nested
              subgraphs: each subroutine is created as a subgraph nested  inside  its  calling  routines.   This
              allows you to interactively display subgraphs or summarise them.

              The <b>-vcg</b> option for <b>ftnchek</b> was written by Dr. Philip Rubini of Cranfield University, UK.

              <b>xvcg</b>  is a graph visualisation tool which runs under the X windows system.  It is freely available
              from ftp.cs.uni-sb.de. It was written by G. Sander of the University of Saarland, Germany.

              See also: <b>-calltree</b>, <b>-crossref</b>, <b>-reference</b>, <b>-sort</b>.

       <b>-version</b>
              This option causes <b>ftnchek</b> to print a line giving the version  number,  release  date,  and  patch
              level  of  the  program.  If no files are given, it then exits.  If files are given, the effect of
              this option is to include the patch level (normally omitted) in the version information printed at
              the start of processing.  Default = no.

              See also: <b>-help</b>.

       <b>-volatile</b>
              Assume that COMMON blocks are volatile.  Default = no.

              This flag is superseded by <b>-common=volatile</b>, and should no longer be used.  It may  be  eliminated
              in a future release of <b>ftnchek</b>.

              See also: <b>-common</b>, <b>-usage</b>.

       <b>-wordsize=</b><u>num</u>
              Specifies the default word size to be <u>num</u> bytes.  This is the size of logical and single-precision
              numeric  variables that are not given explicit precisions.  (Explicit precisions for non-character
              variables are an extension to the Fortran 77 Standard, and are given by type declarations such  as
              REAL*8  X.)   Double-precision  and complex variables will be twice this value, and double complex
              variables four times.  Quad-precision constants and intrinsic function results will be four  times
              this  value.   Note  that variables declared as REAL*16 will be regarded as quad precision only if
              the word size is 4 bytes.  Default = turn-on = 4 bytes.

              The word size value does not matter for checking standard-conforming programs that do not  declare
              explicit  precisions  for  non-character  variables  or  store  Hollerith data in variables.  This
              setting also does not affect the default size of character variables,  which  is  always  1  byte.
              Hollerith constants also are assumed to occupy 1 byte per character.

              The  word  size  is  used  to determine whether truncation occurs in assignment statements, and to
              catch precision mismatches in subprogram  argument  lists  and  common  block  lists.   The  exact
              warnings   that   are  issued  will  depend  on  the  status  of  other  flags.   Under  both  the
              <b>-portability=mixed-size</b> and the <b>-nowordsize</b> flag, any mixing of explicit  with  default  precision
              objects  (character  expressions  not  included)  is  warned  about.   This  applies to arithmetic
              expressions containing both types of objects, and to subprogram arguments  and  COMMON  variables.
              Under control of the <b>-truncation=demotion</b> and <b>promotion</b> options, a warning is given for assignment
              of  an  expression  to  a shorter variable of the same type, or for promotion of a lower precision
              value to higher precision in an arithmetic expression or an assignment statement.

              Giving a word size of 0, or equivalently, using <b>-nowordsize</b> means that no default  value  will  be
              assumed.   This  is  equivalent  to  specifying  <b>-portability=mixed-size</b>.  Use it to find cases of
              mixing default and explicit precision, for example to flag  places  where  REAL*8  is  treated  as
              equivalent to DOUBLE PRECISION.

              See also: <b>-pointersize</b>, <b>-portability</b>, <b>-truncation</b>.

       <b>-wrap=</b><u>col</u>
              Controls  the  wrapping  of error messages.  Long error messages that would run past the specified
              column will be broken up into  separate  lines  between  the  words  of  the  message  for  better
              readability.  If turned off with <b>-nowrap</b>, each separate error message will be printed on one line,
              leaving it up to the display to wrap the message or truncate it.  Default = turn-on = 79.

</pre><h4><b>CHANGING</b> <b>THE</b> <b>DEFAULTS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ftnchek</b>  includes  two mechanisms for changing the default values of all options: by defining environment
       variables or by creating a preferences file.  When <b>ftnchek</b> starts up, it looks in its environment for any
       variables whose names are composed by prefixing the string FTNCHEK_ onto the uppercased  version  of  the
       option name.  If such a variable is found, its value is used to specify the default for the corresponding
       switch  or  setting.   In the case of settings (for example, the <b>-common</b> strictness setting) the value of
       the environment variable is read as the default setting value.  In the  case  of  switches,  the  default
       switch will be taken as true or yes unless the environment variable has the value 0 or NO.

       Note  that the environment variable name must be constructed with the full-length option name, which must
       be in uppercase.  For example, to make <b>ftnchek</b> print a source listing by  default,  set  the  environment
       variable  FTNCHEK_LIST  to  1 or YES or anything other than 0 or NO.  The names FTNCHEK_LIS (not the full
       option name) or ftnchek_list (lower case) would not be recognized.

       Here are some examples of how to set environment variables on various systems.  For simplicity,  all  the
       examples set the default <b>-list</b> switch to YES.

       1. UNIX, Bourne shell:        $ FTNCHEK_LIST=YES
                                     $ export FTNCHEK_LIST

       2. UNIX, C shell:             % setenv FTNCHEK_LIST YES

       3. VAX/VMS:                   $ DEFINE FTNCHEK_LIST YES

       4. MSDOS:                     $ SET FTNCHEK_LIST=YES

       After  processing  any environment variables, ftnchek looks for a preferences file containing options and
       settings.  It will search in the following order, using only the first file found: (1) <u>.ftnchekrc</u> in  the
       current directory, (2) <u>ftnchek.ini</u> in the current directory, (3) <u>.ftnchekrc</u> in the user's home directory,
       (4)  <u>ftnchek.ini</u>  in  the home directory.  If such a file is found, the options defined in it are used as
       defaults in place of the built-in defaults and overriding any defaults set in the environment..

       Each option or setting in the preferences file must be on a separate line.  They are given  in  the  same
       form  as  on  the  command line, except without the initial dash.  The preferences file can contain blank
       lines and comments.  Comments are introduced at any point in a line by a space character (blank  or  tab)
       or the '#' character, and are terminated by the end of the line.

       Command-line  options  override  the  defaults set in the environment or in the preferences file, in  the
       same way as they override the built-in defaults.

</pre><h4><b>USING</b> <b>PROJECT</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       This section contains detailed information on how to use project files most effectively, and how to avoid
       some pitfalls.

       One can divide the checks <b>ftnchek</b> does  into  two  categories,  local  and  global.   Local  checking  is
       restricted  to  within a single routine, and catches things like uninitialized variables, unintended loss
       of precision in arithmetic expressions, etc.  This sort of  checking  can  be  done  on  each  subprogram
       independently.   Furthermore, local checking of a subprogram does not need to be repeated when some other
       subprogram is changed.  Global checking catches things like calling a subroutine with the wrong  argument
       types,  or disagreeing in common block declarations.  It requires looking at the whole set of subprograms
       interacting with each other.

       The purpose of project files is to allow the local checking and global checking steps  to  be  separated.
       Assuming that each subprogram is in its own source file, you can run <b>ftnchek</b> once on each one to do local
       checking  while  suppressing  global  checking.   Then  <b>ftnchek</b>  can be run once on all the project files
       together to do the global checking.  The sample makefile below shows how  to  automate  this  task.   The
       ``.f.prj''  target  updates  a  project file for a particular file any time the source file changes.  The
       information needed for global checking is saved in the project  file.   The  ``check''  target  does  the
       combined  global  checking.   Typically ``make check'' would repeat the ``ftnchek -project'' step only on
       changed source files, then do the global check.  This is obviously a big advantage  for  large  programs,
       when many subprograms seldom if ever change.

       It  is  best when using project files to place each subprogram in a separate source file.  If each source
       file may contain more than one subprogram,  it complicates the definition  of  ``local''  and  ``global''
       checking  because  there is some inter-module checking that is contained within a file.  <b>ftnchek</b> tries to
       do the right thing in this case, but there are some complications (described below) due to the  trade-off
       between avoiding re-doing cross-checks and preserving information about the program's structure.

       Ordinarily, to do the least amount of re-checking, project files should be created with the <b>-library</b> flag
       in  effect  and  trimming turned on.  In this mode, the information saved in the project file consists of
       all subprogram declarations, all subprogram invocations not resolved by declarations in  the  same  file,
       and  one  instance of each COMMON block declaration.  This is the minimum amount of information needed to
       check agreement between files.

       If the source file contains more than one routine, there are some possible problems that can  arise  from
       creating  the  project  file in library mode, because the calling hierarchy among routines defined within
       the file is lost.  Also, if the routines in the file make use of  COMMON  blocks  that  are  shared  with
       routines  in  other files, there will not be enough information saved for the correct checking of set and
       used status of COMMON blocks and COMMON variables according to the <b>-usage</b> setting.  Therefore if you plan
       to use project files when <b>-usage</b> checking is turned on (which is the default situation), and if  multiple
       routines  in  one project file share COMMON blocks with routines in other files, the project files should
       be created with the <b>-library</b> flag turned off.  In this  mode,  <b>ftnchek</b>  saves,  besides  the  information
       listed  above, one invocation of each subprogram by any other subprogram in the same file, and all COMMON
       block declarations.  This means that the project file will be larger than necessary, and that when it  is
       read  in,  <b>ftnchek</b>  may  repeat  some  inter-module  checks that it already did when the project file was
       created.  If each project file contains only one module, there is no loss of information in creating  the
       project files in library mode.

       Because of the possible loss of information entailed by creating a project file with the <b>-library</b> flag in
       effect,  whenever  that project file is read in later, it will be treated as a library file regardless of
       the current setting of the <b>-library</b> flag.  On the other hand, a project file created  with  library  mode
       turned off can be read in later in either mode.

       The foregoing discussion assumes that the trimming options of the <b>-project</b> setting are turned on when the
       project  file is created.  This is the normal situation.  The <b>no-trim</b> options of the <b>-project</b> setting are
       provided in case one wants to use the project files for purposes other than  checking  the  program  with
       <b>ftnchek</b>.   For instance, one could write a Perl script to analyze the project files for information about
       how the different subprograms are called.  You should not use the <b>no-trim</b> options to deal with the issues
       of information loss discussed above, since they cause more information than necessary to be stored.  This
       makes the project files bigger and causes <b>ftnchek</b> to do more work later when it reads them to check  your
       complete  program.   Ordinarily,  you  should  use the <b>-library</b> option to control how much information to
       store for later use by <b>ftnchek</b> in checking your program.

       Here is an example of how to use the UNIX <b>make</b> utility to automatically create a new  project  file  each
       time  the corresponding source file is altered, and to check the set of files for consistency.  Add these
       lines to your makefile.  The example assumes that a macro OBJS has been defined which lists all the names
       of object files to be linked together to form the complete executable program.  (In  this  makefile,  the
       indented  lines should each begin with a tab, not blanks.)  If any source file contains multiple routines
       that share common blocks among themselves, then the no-com-\* option should  be  removed  from  NOGLOBAL,
       and/or drop the -library flag.
           # tell make what a project file suffix is
           .SUFFIXES: .prj

           # these options suppress global checks.
           NOGLOBAL=-usage=no-ext-undefined,no-com-\*

           # tell make how to create a .prj file from a .f file
           .f.prj:
                   ftnchek -project $(NOGLOBAL) -library $&lt;

           # set up macro PRJS containing project filenames
           PRJS= $(OBJS:.o=.prj)

           # "make check" will check everything that has been changed.
           check: $(PRJS)
                   ftnchek $(PRJS)

       When  a  program  uses  many  routines  defined  in a large number of different source files in different
       directories, it can be cumbersome to specify all the different project files needed to check the  program
       properly.   To  deal with such cases, <b>ftnchek</b> allows project files to be concatenated into a single large
       file.  This single file can then be given to <b>ftnchek</b> to provide the information for checking the  use  of
       any  or all of the routines defined in the combined project files.  When using such a ``library'' project
       file, you may want <b>ftnchek</b>'s error reports to document precisely the name of the file where the  specific
       function  is defined.  If the various source files are in several directories, an error report that gives
       only the file name may be ambiguous, and rather should include the path to the file.  The solution is  to
       create  each  of  the individual project files by giving the complete path to the source file.  Then this
       complete path will appear in the error reports.  For example, suppose that all of the library  subprogram
       source  files  are  in  subdirectories of a directory named /util/lib.  Then the individual project files
       could first be created by a command such as
       find /util/lib -name '*.f' -exec ftnchek -project '{}' ';'
       (Possibly other options would be provided to <b>ftnchek</b> as  discussed  above.   Also,  this  step  could  be
       handled  instead  by  a revised makefile rule that would provide the complete source file path instead of
       just the local name when invoking <b>ftnchek</b>.)  Next, concatenate all of these project files manually.
       find /util/lib -name '*.prj' -exec cat '{}' ';' &gt; ourlib.prj
       Then a program source file can be checked by using the command
       ftnchek prog.f ... -lib ourlib.prj
       and an error message related to any library routine will include the full path to  the  routine's  source
       file.

       At  present,  there  is  no archive utility like <b>ar</b> to manage the contents of a concatenated project file
       like the one in the illustration above.  If changes are made to one of the library routines, the only way
       to update the combined project file is to concatenate all the individual project files once again.   Such
       a utility would be quite easy to write.  Someone should do so and contribute it to the <b>ftnchek</b> effort.

           Actual arg NUMS in module AVENUM line 43 file average.f is type real

       According to <b>ftnchek</b>, the program contains variables which may  be  used  before  they  are  assigned  an
       initial  value, and variables which are not needed.  <b>ftnchek</b> also warns the user that an integer quotient
       has been converted to a real. This may assist the user in catching an unintended roundoff  error.   Since
       the  <b>-symtab</b>  flag was given, <b>ftnchek</b> prints out a table containing identifiers from the local module and
       their corresponding datatype and number of dimensions.  Finally, <b>ftnchek</b> warns that the  function  COMPAV
       is not used with the proper type of arguments.

       With <b>ftnchek</b>'s help, we can debug the program.  We can see that there were the following errors:

       1.  SUM and COUNT should have been converted to real before doing the division.

       2.  SUM should have been initialized to 0 before entering the loop.

       3.  AVG was never printed out after being calculated.

       4.  NUMS should have been declared INTEGER instead of REAL.

       We  also  see  that  I, not J, should have been declared INTEGER in function COMPAV. Also, MAXNOS was not
       declared as INTEGER, nor COMPAV as REAL, in program AVENUM.  These are not errors, but they may  indicate
       carelessness.  As it happened, the default type of these variables coincided with the intended type.

       Here is the corrected program, and its output when run:

</pre><h4><b>INTERPRETING</b> <b>THE</b> <b>OUTPUT</b></h4><pre>
       The messages given by <b>ftnchek</b> include not only syntax errors but also warnings and informational messages
       about things that are legal Fortran but that may indicate errors or carelessness.  Most of these messages
       can  be  turned off by command-line options.  Which option controls each message depends on the nature of
       the condition being warned about.  See the  descriptions  of  the  command-line  flags  in  the  previous
       sections,  and  of  individual messages below.  Each message is prefixed with a word or phrase indicating
       the nature of the condition and its severity.

       ``Error'' means a syntax error.  The simplest kind of syntax errors are typographical errors, for example
       unbalanced parentheses or misspelling of a keyword.  This type of error  is  caught  by  the  parser  and
       appears with the description ``parse error'' or ``syntax error'' (depending on  the version of the parser
       generator  and  whether  it is GNU <b>bison</b> or UNIX <b>yacc</b>).  This type of error message cannot be suppressed.
       Be aware that this type of error often means that <b>ftnchek</b> has  not  properly  interpreted  the  statement
       where  the  error  occurs,  so  that  its subsequent checking operations will be compromised.  You should
       eliminate all syntax errors before proceeding to interpret the other messages <b>ftnchek</b> gives.

       ``Warning: Nonstandard syntax'' indicates an extension to Fortran that <b>ftnchek</b> supports but that  is  not
       according  to  the Fortran 77 Standard.  The extensions that <b>ftnchek</b> accepts are described in the section
       on Extensions below.  One example is the DO ... ENDDO construction.  If a program uses these  extensions,
       warnings  will  be  given according to specifications under the <b>-f77</b> setting.  The default behavior is to
       give no warnings.

       ``Warning'' in other cases means a condition that is suspicious but that may or may not be a  programming
       error.  Frequently these conditions are legal under the standard.  Some are illegal but do not fall under
       the  heading  of  syntax  errors.   Usage  errors are one example.  These refer to the possibility that a
       variable may be used before it has been assigned a value (generally an error),  or  that  a  variable  is
       declared  but  never  used  (harmless  but  may indicate carelessness).  The amount of checking for usage
       errors is controlled by the <b>-usage</b> flag, which specifies the maximum amount of checking by default.

       Truncation warnings cover situations in which accuracy may be lost unintentionally, for  example  when  a
       double  precision value is assigned to a real variable.  These warnings are controlled by the <b>-truncation</b>
       setting, which is on by default.

       ``Nonportable usage'' warns about some feature that may not be accepted by some compilers even though  it
       is  not  contrary  to  the  Fortran  77 Standard, or that may cause the program to perform differently on
       different platforms.  For example, equivalencing real and integer variables  is  usually  a  non-portable
       practice.   The  use  of  extensions  to  the  standard  language  is,  of course, another source of non-
       portability, but this is handled as a separate case.  To check a program for true portability,  both  the
       <b>-portability</b>  and  the  <b>-f77</b>  flags  should be used.  They are both turned off by default.  The <b>-wordsize</b>
       setting is provided to check only those nonportable usages that depend on a particular machine wordsize.

       ``Possibly misleading appearance'' is used for legal constructions that may not mean what they appear  to
       mean  at  first  glance.   For example, Fortran is insensitive to blank space, so extraneous space within
       variable names or the lack of space between a keyword and a variable can convey the wrong  impression  to
       the reader.  These messages can be suppressed by turning off the <b>-pretty</b> flag, which is on by default.

       Other  messages that are given after all the files are processed, and having to do with agreement between
       modules, do not use the word ``warning'' but generally fall into that category.   Examples  include  type
       mismatches  between  corresponding variables in different COMMON block declarations, or between dummy and
       actual arguments of a subprogram.  These warnings are controlled by the <b>-common</b> and  <b>-arguments</b>  settings
       respectively.  By default both are set for maximum strictness of checking.

       Another  group  of  warnings  about  conditions  that  are  often harmless refer to cases where the array
       properties of a variable passed as a subprogram argument differ between the two routines.  For  instance,
       an  array  element  might  be passed to a subroutine that expects a whole array.  This is a commonly-used
       technique for processing single rows or columns  of  two-dimensional  arrays.   However,  it  could  also
       indicate  a  programming error.  The <b>-array</b> setting allows the user to adjust the degree of strictness to
       be used in checking this kind of agreement between actual and dummy  array  arguments.   By  default  the
       strictness is maximum.

       ``Oops''  indicates  a technical problem, meaning either a bug in <b>ftnchek</b> or that its resources have been
       exceeded.

       The syntax error messages and warnings include the filename along with the line number and column number.
       <b>ftnchek</b> has two different options for the appearance of these error messages.  If <b>-novice</b> is  in  effect,
       which  is  the default, the messages are in a style approximating normal English.  (In default style, the
       filename is not printed in messages within the body of the program if <b>-list</b> is  in  effect.)   The  other
       style  of  error  messages  is  selected  by  the <b>-nonovice</b> option.  In this style, the appearance of the
       messages is similar to that of the UNIX <b>lint</b> program.

       <b>ftnchek</b> is still blind to some kinds of syntax errors.  The two most important ones are detailed checking
       of FORMAT statements, and almost anything to do with control of execution flow by means of  IF,  DO,  and
       GOTO  statements: namely correct nesting of control structures, matching of opening statements such as IF
       ... THEN with closing statements such as ENDIF, and the proper use of statement labels  (numbers).   Most
       compilers will catch these errors.  See the section on Limitations for a more detailed discussion.

       If  <b>ftnchek</b>  gives  you a syntax error message when the compiler does not, it may be because your program
       contains an extension to standard Fortran which is accepted by the compiler but not by <b>ftnchek</b>.  (See the
       section on Extensions.)  On a VAX/VMS system, you can use the compiler  option  /STANDARD  to  cause  the
       compiler to accept only standard Fortran.  On most UNIX or UNIX-like systems, this can be accomplished by
       setting the flag <b>-ansi.</b>

       Many  of the messages given by <b>ftnchek</b> are self-explanatory.  Those that need some additional explanation
       are listed below in alphabetical order.

       <u>Common</u> <u>block</u> <u>NAME:</u> <u>data</u> <u>type</u> <u>mismatch</u> <u>at</u> <u>position</u> <u>n</u>
              The <u>n</u>-th variable in the COMMON block differs in data type in two different  declarations  of  the
              COMMON block.  By default (<b>-common</b> strictness level 3), <b>ftnchek</b> is very picky about COMMON blocks:
              the  variables  listed in them must match exactly by data type and array dimensions.  That is, the
              legal pair of declarations in different modules:
                   COMMON /COM1/ A,B
              and
                   COMMON /COM1/ <a href="../man2/A.2.html">A</a>(2)
              will cause <b>ftnchek</b> to give warnings at strictness level 3.  These two declarations  are  legal  in
              Fortran  since they both declare two real variables.  At strictness level 1 or 2, no warning would
              be given in this example, but the warning would be given if there were a data type  mismatch,  for
              instance, if B were declared INTEGER.  Controlled by <b>-common</b> setting.

       <u>Common</u> <u>block</u> <u>NAME</u> <u>has</u> <u>long</u> <u>data</u> <u>type</u> <u>following</u> <u>short</u> <u>data</u> <u>type</u>
              Some  compilers  require alignment of multi-byte items so that each item begins at an address that
              is a multiple of the item size.  Thus if a short (e.g. single-precision real) item is followed  by
              a long (e.g.  double precision real) item, the latter may not be aligned correctly.  Controlled by
              <b>-portability=common-alignment</b> option.

       <u>Common</u> <u>block</u> <u>NAME</u> <u>has</u> <u>mixed</u> <u>character</u> <u>and</u> <u>non-character</u> <u>variables</u>
              The  ANSI  standard requires that if any variable in a COMMON block is of type CHARACTER, then all
              other variables in the  same  COMMON  block  must  also  be  of  type  CHARACTER.   Controlled  by
              <b>-f77=mixed-common</b> option.

       <u>Common</u> <u>block</u> <u>NAME:</u> <u>varying</u> <u>length</u>
              For  <b>-common</b> setting level 2, this message means that a COMMON block is declared to have different
              numbers of words in two different subprograms.  A word is the amount of storage  occupied  by  one
              integer  or  real  variable.  For <b>-common</b> setting level 3, it means that the two declarations have
              different numbers of variables, where an array of any size is considered one  variable.   This  is
              not  necessarily  an  error, but it may indicate that a variable is missing from one of the lists.
              Note that according to the Fortran 77 Standard, it is an error for named COMMON  blocks  (but  not
              blank  COMMON)  to  differ  in  number  of  words in declarations in different modules.  Given for
              <b>-common</b> setting 2 or 3.

       <u>Error:</u> <u>Badly</u> <u>formed</u> <u>logical/relational</u> <u>operator</u> <u>or</u> <u>constant</u>

       <u>Error:</u> <u>Badly</u> <u>formed</u> <u>real</u> <u>constant</u>
              The syntax analyzer has found the start of one of the special words that  begin  and  end  with  a
              period  (e.g. .EQ.), or the start of a numeric constant, but did not succeed in finding a complete
              item of that kind.

       <u>Error:</u> <u>cannot</u> <u>be</u> <u>adjustable</u> <u>size</u> <u>in</u> <u>module</u> <u>NAME</u>
              A character variable cannot be declared with a size that is an asterisk in parentheses  unless  it
              is a dummy argument, a parameter, or the name of the function defined in the module.

       <u>Error:</u> <u>cannot</u> <u>be</u> <u>declared</u> <u>in</u> <u>SAVE</u> <u>statement</u> <u>in</u> <u>module</u> <u>NAME</u>
              Only local variables and common blocks can be declared in a SAVE statement.

       <u>Error:</u> <u>No</u> <u>path</u> <u>to</u> <u>this</u> <u>statement</u>
              <b>ftnchek</b>  will  detect  statements  which  are ignored or by-passed because there is no foreseeable
              route to the statement.  For example, an unnumbered statement (a  statement  without  a  statement
              label), occurring immediately after a GOTO statement, cannot possibly be executed.

       <u>Error:</u> <u>Parse</u> <u>error</u>
              This means that the parser, which analyzes the Fortran program into expressions, statements, etc.,
              has been unable to find a valid interpretation for some portion of a statement in the program.  If
              your  compiler does not report a syntax error at the same place, the most common explanations are:
              (1) use of an extension to ANSI standard Fortran that is not recognized by  <b>ftnchek</b>,  or  (2)  the
              statement requires more lookahead than <b>ftnchek</b> uses (see section on Bugs).

              NOTE:  This  message  means  that  the  affected  statement  is not interpreted.  Therefore, it is
              possible that <b>ftnchek</b>'s subsequent processing will be in error,  if  it  depends  on  any  matters
              affected by this statement (type declarations, etc.).

       <u>Error:</u> <u>Syntax</u> <u>error</u>
              This  is  the  same  as  ``Error:  Parse  error'' (see above).  It is generated if your version of
              <b>ftnchek</b> was built using the UNIX <b>yacc</b> parser generator rather than GNU <b>bison</b>.

       <u>Identifiers</u> <u>which</u> <u>are</u> <u>not</u> <u>unique</u> <u>in</u> <u>first</u> <u>six</u> <u>chars</u>
              Warns that two identifiers which are longer than 6  characters  do  not  differ  in  the  first  6
              characters.   This  is  for  portability:  they  may not be considered distinct by some compilers.
              Controlled by <b>-sixchar</b> option.

       <u>Nonportable</u> <u>usage:</u> <u>argument</u> <u>precision</u> <u>may</u> <u>not</u> <u>be</u> <u>correct</u> <u>for</u> <u>intrinsic</u> <u>function</u>
              The precision of an argument passed to an intrinsic function may be incorrect on  some  computers.
              Issued  when  a  numeric variable declared with explicit precision (e.g.  REAL*8 X) is passed to a
              specific intrinsic function (e.g. DSQRT(X)).  Controlled by <b>-portability=mixed-size</b> and <b>-wordsize</b>.

       <u>Nonportable</u> <u>usage:</u> <u>character</u> <u>constant/variable</u> <u>length</u> <u>exceeds</u> <u>255</u>
              Some compilers do not support character strings more than 255 characters in length.  Controlled by
              <b>-portability=long-string</b>.

       <u>Nonportable</u> <u>usage:</u> <u>File</u> <u>contains</u> <u>tabs</u>
              <b>ftnchek</b> expands tabs to be equivalent to spaces up to the next column which is a  multiple  of  8.
              Some  compilers treat tabs differently, and also it is possible that files sent by electronic mail
              will have the tabs converted to blanks in some way.  Therefore files containing tabs  may  not  be
              compiled correctly after being transferred.  <b>ftnchek</b> does not give this message if tabs only occur
              within comments or character constants.  Controlled by <b>-portability=tab</b>.

       <u>Nonportable</u> <u>usage:</u> <u>non-integer</u> <u>DO</u> <u>loop</u> <u>bounds</u>
              This  warning  is  only  given  when  the DO index and bounds are non-integer.  Use of non-integer
              quantities in a DO statement may cause  unexpected  errors,  or  different  results  on  different
              machines, due to roundoff effects.  Controlled by <b>-portability=real-do</b>.

       <u>Possibly</u> <u>it</u> <u>is</u> <u>an</u> <u>array</u> <u>which</u> <u>was</u> <u>not</u> <u>declared</u>
              This  message  is  appended  to  warnings  related to a function invocation or to an argument type
              mismatch, for which the possibility exists that what appears to be a function is actually meant to
              be an array.  If the programmer forgot to dimension an array, references  to  the  array  will  be
              interpreted  as  function  invocations.   This  message will be suppressed if the name in question
              appears in an EXTERNAL or INTRINSIC statement.  Controlled by the <b>-novice</b> option.

       <u>Possibly</u> <u>misleading</u> <u>appearance:</u> <u>characters</u> <u>past</u> <u>72</u> <u>columns</u>
              The program is being processed with the statement field width at its standard  value  of  72,  and
              some  nonblank characters have been found past column 72.  In this case, <b>ftnchek</b> is not processing
              the characters past column 72, and is notifying the user that  the  statement  may  not  have  the
              meaning  that  it  appears  to  have.   These characters might be intended by the programmer to be
              significant, but they will be ignored by the compiler.  Controlled by <b>-pretty=long-line</b>.

       <u>Possibly</u> <u>misleading</u> <u>appearance:</u> <u>Common</u> <u>block</u> <u>declared</u> <u>in</u> <u>more</u> <u>than</u> <u>one</u> <u>statement</u>
              Such multiple declarations are legal and have the same effect as a continuation  of  the  original
              declaration of the block.  This warning is only given if the two declarations are separated by one
              or more intervening statements.  Controlled by <b>-pretty=multiple-common</b>.

       <u>Possibly</u> <u>misleading</u> <u>appearance:</u> <u>Continuation</u> <u>follows</u> <u>comment</u> <u>or</u> <u>blank</u> <u>line</u>
              <b>ftnchek</b>  issues  this  warning  message  to  alert  the user that a continuation of a statement is
              interspersed with comments, making it easy to overlook.  Controlled by <b>-pretty=continuation</b>.

       <u>Possibly</u> <u>misleading</u> <u>appearance:</u> <u>Extraneous</u> <u>parentheses</u>
              Warns about parentheses surrounding a variable by itself in an expression.  When  a  parenthesized
              variable  is  passed  as  an  argument  to  a subprogram, it is treated as an expression, not as a
              variable whose value can be modified by the called routine.  Controlled by <b>-pretty=parentheses</b>.

       <u>Subprogram</u> <u>NAME:</u> <u>argument</u> <u>data</u> <u>type</u> <u>mismatch</u> <u>at</u> <u>position</u> <u>n</u>
              The subprogram's <u>n</u>-th actual argument (in the CALL or the usage of a function) differs in datatype
              or precision from the <u>n</u>-th dummy argument  (in  the  SUBROUTINE  or  FUNCTION  declaration).   For
              instance, if the user defines a subprogram by
                   SUBROUTINE SUBA(X)
                   REAL X
              and elsewhere invokes SUBA by
                   CALL <a href="../man2/SUBA.2.html">SUBA</a>(2)
              <b>ftnchek</b>  will  detect  the error.  The reason here is that the number 2 is integer, not real.  The
              user should have written
                   CALL SUBA(2.0)

              When checking an argument which is a subprogram, <b>ftnchek</b> must be able to determine whether it is a
              function or a subroutine.  The rules used by <b>ftnchek</b> to do this are as follows: If the subprogram,
              besides being passed as an actual argument, is also invoked directly elsewhere in the same module,
              then its type is determined by that usage.  If not, then if the name of the  subprogram  does  not
              appear  in  an  explicit  type  declaration, it is assumed to be a subroutine; if it is explicitly
              typed it is taken as a function.  Therefore, subroutines passed as actual arguments need  only  be
              declared by an EXTERNAL statement in the calling module, whereas functions must also be explicitly
              typed in order to avoid generating this error message.  Controlled by <b>-arguments</b> setting.

       <u>Subprogram</u> <u>NAME:</u> <u>argument</u> <u>arrayness</u> <u>mismatch</u> <u>at</u> <u>position</u> <u>n</u>
              Similar  to  the  preceding  situation,  but  the  subprogram  dummy  argument  differs  from  the
              corresponding actual argument in its number of dimensions or number of  elements.   Controlled  by
              <b>-array</b> together with <b>-arguments</b> settings.

       <u>Subprogram</u> <u>NAME:</u> <u>argument</u> <u>mismatch</u> <u>at</u> <u>position</u> <u>n</u>
              A  character dummy argument is larger than the corresponding actual argument, or a Hollerith dummy
              argument is larger than the corresponding actual argument.  Controlled by <b>-arguments</b> setting.

       <u>Subprogram</u> <u>NAME:</u> <u>argument</u> <u>usage</u> <u>mismatch</u>
              <b>ftnchek</b> detects a possible conflict between the way a subprogram uses an argument and the  way  in
              which  the  argument  is  supplied  to  the  subprogram.  The conflict can be one of two types, as
              outlined below.

          <u>Dummy</u> <u>arg</u> <u>is</u> <u>modified,</u> <u>Actual</u> <u>arg</u> <u>is</u> <u>const</u> <u>or</u> <u>expr</u>
              A dummy argument is an argument as named in a SUBROUTINE or FUNCTION statement and used within the
              subprogram.  An actual argument is an argument as passed  to  a  subroutine  or  function  by  the
              caller.   <b>ftnchek</b> is saying that a dummy argument is modified by the subprogram, implying that its
              value is changed in the calling module.   The  corresponding  actual  argument  should  not  be  a
              constant  or expression, but rather a variable or array element which can be legitimately assigned
              to.  Controlled by the <b>-usage=arg-const-modified</b> option.

          <u>Dummy</u> <u>arg</u> <u>used</u> <u>before</u> <u>set,</u> <u>Actual</u> <u>arg</u> <u>not</u> <u>set</u>
              Here a dummy argument may be used in the subprogram before having a value assigned to  it  by  the
              subprogram.   The  corresponding  actual argument should have a value assigned to it by the caller
              prior to invoking the subprogram.  Controlled by the <b>-usage=var-uninitialized</b> option.

              This warning is not affected by the <b>-arguments</b> setting.

       <u>Subprogram</u> <u>NAME</u> <u>invoked</u> <u>inconsistently</u>
              Here the mismatch is between the datatype of the subprogram itself as used  and  as  defined.  For
              instance, if the user declares
                   INTEGER FUNCTION COUNT(A)
              and invokes COUNT in another module as
                   N = COUNT(A)
              without  declaring  its  datatype,  it will default to real type, based on the first letter of its
              name.  The calling module should have included the declaration
                   INTEGER COUNT

              Given for <b>-arguments</b> setting 2 or 3.

       <u>Subprogram</u> <u>NAME:</u>  <u>varying</u> <u>length</u> <u>argument</u> <u>lists:</u>
              An inconsistency has been found between the number of dummy arguments  (parameters)  a  subprogram
              has  and  the  number  of  actual arguments given it in an invocation.  <b>ftnchek</b> keeps track of all
              invocations of subprograms (CALL statements and expressions using  functions)  and  compares  them
              with  the  definitions  of  the  subprograms  elsewhere  in the source code.  The Fortran compiler
              normally does not catch this type of error.  Given for <b>-arguments</b> setting 1 or 3.

       <u>Variable</u> <u>not</u> <u>declared.</u>  <u>Type</u> <u>has</u> <u>been</u> <u>implicitly</u> <u>defined</u>
              When printing the symbol table for a module, <b>ftnchek</b> will flag with an  asterisk  all  identifiers
              that  are  not  explicitly  typed  and  will  show the datatype that was assigned through implicit
              typing.  This provides support for users who wish to declare  all  variables  as  is  required  in
              Pascal  or  some other languages.  This message appears only when the <b>-symtab</b> option is in effect.
              Alternatively, use the <b>-declare</b> flag if you want to get a list of all undeclared variables.

       <u>Variables</u> <u>declared</u> <u>but</u> <u>never</u> <u>referenced</u>
              Detects any identifiers that were declared in your program but  were  never  used,  either  to  be
              assigned  a  value or to have their value accessed.  Variables in COMMON are excluded.  Controlled
              by the <b>-usage=var-unused</b> option.

       <u>Variables</u> <u>set</u> <u>but</u> <u>never</u> <u>used</u>
              <b>ftnchek</b> will notify the user when a variable has been assigned a value, but the  variable  is  not
              otherwise  used  in  the  program.   Usually  this  results  from an oversight.  Controlled by the
              <b>-usage=var-set-unused</b> option.

       <u>Variables</u> <u>used</u> <u>before</u> <u>set</u>
              This message indicates that an identifier is used to compute a value prior to its  initialization.
              Such  usage  may  lead  to  an  incorrect  value  being  computed,  since its initial value is not
              controlled.  Controlled by the <b>-usage=var-uninitialized</b> option.

       <u>Variables</u> <u>may</u> <u>be</u> <u>used</u> <u>before</u> <u>set</u>
              Similar to used before set except that <b>ftnchek</b> is not able to determine its status with certainty.
              <b>ftnchek</b> assumes a variable may be used before set if the first usage of the variable occurs  prior
              in the program text to its assignment.  Controlled by the <b>-usage=var-uninitialized</b> option.

       <u>Warning:</u> <u>DO</u> <u>index</u> <u>is</u> <u>not</u> <u>integer</u>
              This  warning  is  only  given  when  the  DO bounds are integer, but the DO index is not.  It may
              indicate a failure to declare the index to  be  an  integer.   Controlled  by  <b>-truncation=real-do</b>

       <u>Warning:</u> <u>integer</u> <u>quotient</u> <u>expr</u> <u>...</u> <u>converted</u> <u>to</u> <u>real</u>
              The  quotient  of  two integers results in an integer type result, in which the fractional part is
              dropped.  If such an integer expression involving division is later converted to a real  datatype,
              it  may  be  that  a real type division had been intended.  Controlled by <b>-truncation=int-div-real</b>
              option.

       <u>Warning:</u> <u>Integer</u> <u>quotient</u> <u>expr</u> <u>...</u> <u>used</u> <u>in</u> <u>exponent</u>
              The quotient of two integers results in an integer type result, in which the  fractional  part  is
              dropped.   If  such  an  integer expression is used as an exponent, it is quite likely that a real
              type division was intended.  Controlled by <b>-truncation=int-div-exponent</b> option.

       <u>Warning:</u> <u>NAME</u> <u>not</u> <u>set</u> <u>when</u> <u>RETURN</u> <u>encountered</u>
              The way that functions in Fortran return a value is by assigning the value  to  the  name  of  the
              function.   This  message  indicates  that  the function was not assigned a value before the point
              where a RETURN statement was found.  Therefore it is possible that the function  could  return  an
              undefined value.

       <u>Warning:</u> <u>Nonstandard</u> <u>syntax:</u> <u>adjustable</u> <u>size</u> <u>cannot</u> <u>be</u> <u>concatenated</u> <u>here</u>
              The  Fortran  77  Standard (sec. 6.2.2) forbids concatenating character variables whose size is an
              asterisk in parentheses, except in an assignment statement.   Controlled by <b>-f77=mixed-expr</b>.

       <u>Warning:</u> <u>Nonstandard</u> <u>syntax</u> <u>:</u> <u>significant</u> <u>characters</u> <u>past</u> <u>72</u> <u>columns</u>
              This warning is given under the <b>-f77=long-line</b> setting if the <b>-columns</b> setting has  been  used  to
              increase  the statement field width, and a statement has meaningful program text beyond column 72.
              Standard Fortran ignores all text in those columns, but some compilers do not.  Thus  the  program
              may be treated differently by different compilers.

       <u>Warning:</u> <u>Nonstandard</u> <u>syntax</u> <u>:</u> <u>Statement</u> <u>out</u> <u>of</u> <u>order.</u>
              <b>ftnchek</b>  will  detect  statements that are out of the sequence specified for ANSI standard Fortran
              77.  Table 1 illustrates the allowed sequence of statements in the Fortran  language.   Statements
              which  are  out  of order are nonetheless interpreted by <b>ftnchek</b>, to prevent ``cascades'' of error
              messages.  The sequence counter is also rolled back to prevent repetition of the error message for
              a block of similar statements.  Controlled by the <b>-f77=statement-order</b> option.

              <b>ftnchek</b>  has  detected  an  assignment  statement which has a real expression on the right, but an

              explicitly  convert  the  real  expression to integer using the INT or NINT intrinsic function, no
              warning will be printed.  A similar message  is  printed  if  a  double  precision  expression  is
              assigned to a single precision variable, etc.  Controlled by <b>-truncation=demotion</b> option.

       <u>Warning:</u> <u>subscript</u> <u>is</u> <u>not</u> <u>integer</u>
              Since  array  subscripts are normally integer quantities, the use of a non-integer expression here
              may signal an error.  Controlled by <b>-truncation=real-subscript</b> option.

       <u>Warning:</u> <u>Unknown</u> <u>intrinsic</u> <u>function</u>
              This message warns the user that a name declared in an INTRINSIC statement is unknown to  <b>ftnchek</b>.
              Probably  it  is  a  nonstandard intrinsic function, and so the program will not be portable.  The
              function will be treated by <b>ftnchek</b> as a user-defined function.  This warning is not suppressed by
              any option, since it affects <b>ftnchek</b>'s  analysis  of  the  program.   However,  if  the  intrinsic
              function  is  in  one  of the supported sets of nonstandard intrinsics, you can use the <b>-intrinsic</b>
              setting to cause <b>ftnchek</b> to recognize it.

</pre><h4><b>LIMITATIONS</b> <b>AND</b> <b>EXTENSIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ftnchek</b> accepts ANSI standard Fortran-77  programs  with  some  minor  limitations  and  numerous  common
       extensions.

       <b>Limitations</b>:
              The  dummy  arguments  in  statement functions are treated like ordinary variables of the program.
              That is, their scope is the entire subprogram, not just the statement function definition.

              The checking of FORMAT statements is lax, tolerating  missing  separators  (comma,  etc.)  between
              format  descriptors  in  places  where  the  Standard  requires  them,  and  allowing <u>.d</u> fields on
              descriptors  that  should  not  have  them.   It  does  warn  under  <b>-f77=format-edit-descr</b>  about
              nonstandard descriptor types (like O), and supported extensions.

              There  are  some  syntactic  extensions and Fortran 90 elements that <b>ftnchek</b> accepts but does very
              little checking.  For instance, pointer usage (whether the nonstandard Cray syntax or the  Fortran
              90  syntax)  is  not  checked  other than for set and used status.  It is hoped that some day more
              thorough checking will be implemented, but for now the user should regard the acceptance of  these
              syntactic  features  simply  as  a  convenience  to  enable checking of other aspects of code that
              contains them.  See the section Extensions for specifics about what features are accepted but  not
              fully checked.

              If  a  user-supplied  subprogram  has  the same name as one of the nonstandard intrinsic functions
              recognized by <b>ftnchek</b>, it must be declared in an EXTERNAL statement in any  routine  that  invokes
              it.  Otherwise it will be subject to the checking normally given to the intrinsic function.  Since
              the  nonstandard  intrinsics  are  not  standard,  this  EXTERNAL statement is not required by the
              Fortran  77  Standard.   Using  the  <b>-intrinsic=none</b>  setting,  recognition  of  most  nonstandard
              intrinsics  (excepting  only  those  needed to support the double complex data type) can be turned
              off.  See the lists of supported nonstandard intrinsic  functions  under  the  discussion  of  the
              <b>-intrinsic</b> setting above.

       <b>Extensions</b>:
              All of these extensions (except lower-case characters) will generate warnings if the relevant <b>-f77</b>
              option  is  set.   Some of the extensions listed below are part of the Fortran-90 Standard.  These
              are indicated by the notation (F90).

              Tabs are permitted, and translated into equivalent blanks which correspond to tab  stops  every  8
              columns.   The  standard  does not recognize tabs.  Note that some compilers allow tabs, but treat
              them differently.  The treatment defined for DEC FORTRAN can be achieved using the <b>-source=dec-tab</b>
              setting.

              Strings may be delimited by either quote marks  or  apostrophes.   A  sequence  of  two  delimiter
              characters is interpreted as a single embedded delimiter character.  (F90)

              Strings  may  contain  UNIX-style backslash escape sequences.  They will be interpreted as such if
              the <b>-source=unix-backslash</b> setting is given.  Otherwise the backslash character will be treated as
              a normal printing character.

              Source code can be in either Fortran 90 free format or traditional fixed format.  (F90)

              A semicolon is allowed as a statement separator.  (F90)

              Lower case characters are permitted, and are converted internally to uppercase except in character
              strings.  The standard specifies upper case only, except in comments and strings.  (F90)

              Hollerith constants are permitted, in accordance with the Fortran 77 Standard, appendix  C.   They
              should not be used in expressions, or confused with datatype CHARACTER.

              The  letter 'D' (upper or lower case) in column 1 is treated as the beginning of a comment.  There
              is no option to treat such lines as statements instead of comments.

              Statements may be longer than 72 columns provided that the setting <b>-columns</b> was used  to  increase
              the limit.  According to the standard, all text from columns 73 through 80 is ignored, and no line
              may be longer than 80 columns.

              Variable  names  may  be  longer  than six characters.  The standard specifies six as the maximum.
              <b>ftnchek</b> permits names up to 31 characters long (F90).

              Variable names may contain underscores and dollar signs (or  other  non-alphabetic  characters  as
              specified  by  the  <b>-identifier-chars</b>  option).   These  characters  are  are  treated the same as
              alphabetic letters.  The default type for variables beginning with these characters is  REAL.   In
              IMPLICIT  type  statements  specifying  a  range  of  characters, the dollar sign follows Z and is
              followed by underscore.  (Any other user-defined characters are treated the  same  as  the  dollar
              sign.)  Fortran 90 permits underscores in variable names.

              The  UNIX  version  tolerates the presence of preprocessor directives, namely lines beginning with
              the pound sign (#).  These are treated  as  comments,  except  for  #line  directives,  which  are
              interpreted,  and  are  used  to  set  the line number and source file name for warnings and error
              messages.  Note that #include directives are not processed by <b>ftnchek</b>.  Programs that use them for
              including source files should be passed through the preprocessor before being  input  to  <b>ftnchek</b>.
              As  noted  below,  <b>ftnchek</b>  does  process  INCLUDE  statements, which have a different syntax.  An
              optional program, <b><a href="../man1L/ftnpp.1L.html">ftnpp</a></b>(1L) (available separately) provides  preprocessing that  properly  handles
              INCLUDE files.

              The  Fortran  90  DO ...  ENDDO control structure is permitted.  The CYCLE and EXIT statements are
              accepted.  All of these may have an optional  do-construct  name,  but  construct  names  are  not
              checked for consistency. (F90)

              The Fortran 90 SELECT CASE construct is accepted. (F90)

              Construct names are also accepted on IF, THEN, ELSE, ENDIF and SELECT CASE statements. (F90)

              The ACCEPT and TYPE statements (for terminal I/O) are permitted, with the same syntax as PRINT.

              The  so-called  ``Cray pointer'' syntax is tolerated. It is not the same as the Fortran 90 POINTER
              statement.  There is no real checking of the statement other than basic syntax.  The form of  this
              statement is
                 POINTER (<u>pointer</u>, <u>pointee</u>) [,(<u>pointer</u>, <u>pointee</u>)]
              The  pointer  variables  are  assigned  a  data type of INTEGER *4.  Usage checking of the pointee
              variables is suppressed, since in practice they are accessed indirectly via the pointers.

              The following Fortran 90 pointer related syntaxes are accepted: ALLOCATABLE, POINTER,  and  TARGET
              statements  and  the  same  attributes  in  type  declarations;  ALLOCATE, DEALLOCATE, and NULLIFY
              executable statements; pointer assignment using =&gt; operator; and the intrinsic functions ALLOCATED
              and ASSOCIATED.  Little semantic checking of pointer variables and operations is done beyond basic
              set and used status.  For instance, there is no checking for such errors as dangling pointers,  or
              use of unallocated arrays.

              Statements  may  have  any  number of continuation lines.  The Fortran 77 and Fortran 90 standards
              allow a maximum of 19 in fixed source form.  The Fortran 90 standard allows a  maximum  of  39  in
              free source form.

              Relational  (comparison)  operators  composed of punctuation, namely: &lt; &lt;= == /= &gt; &gt;= are allowed.
              (F90)

              Inline comments, beginning with an exclamation mark, are permitted.  (F90)

              NAMELIST I/O is supported.  The syntax is the same as in Fortran 90.

              FORMAT statements can contain a dollar  sign  to  indicate  suppression  of  carriage-return.   An
              integer expression enclosed in angle brackets can be used anywhere in a FORMAT statement where the
              Fortran 77 Standard allows an integer constant (except for the length of a Hollerith constant), to
              provide a run-time value for a repeat specification or field width.

              Nonstandard keywords are allowed in I/O statements, corresponding to those in VMS Fortran.

              The  IMPLICIT  NONE  statement  is supported.  The meaning of this statement is that all variables
              must have their data types  explicitly  declared.   Rather  than  flag  the  occurrences  of  such
              variables  with  syntax  error messages, <b>ftnchek</b> waits till the end of the module, and then prints
              out a list of all undeclared variables, as it does for the <b>-declare</b> option.  (F90)

              Data types INTEGER, REAL,  COMPLEX,  and  LOGICAL  are  allowed  to  have  an  optional  precision
              specification  in  type  declarations.   For  instance, REAL*8 means an 8-byte floating point data
              type.  The REAL*8 datatype is not necessarily considered equivalent to DOUBLE PRECISION, depending
              on the <b>-wordsize</b> setting.  The  Fortran  77  Standard  allows  a  length  specification  only  for
              CHARACTER data.

              <b>ftnchek</b>  supports  the  DOUBLE  COMPLEX  type  specification for a complex quantity whose real and
              imaginary parts are double precision.  Mixed-mode arithmetic  involving  single-precision  complex
              with double-precision real data, prohibited under the Standard, yields a double complex result.

              Combined type declarations and data-statement-like initializers are accepted.  These have the form
              of  a  standard  Fortran 77 type declaration, followed by a slash-delimited list of constants like
              that used in a DATA statement.  An example of the syntax is
                   INTEGER  N / 100 /
              This bastard form of initializing declaration was not adopted in Fortran  90.   Such  declarations
              should be written using the standard form described below, which is accepted by <b>ftnchek</b>.

              There  is  limited  support  for  Fortran  90  attribute-based  type  declarations.  This style of
              declaration is distinguished by the use of a double colon (::) between the list of attributes  and
              the  list  of  declared variables.  The features supported may be adequate for novice programmers,
              but are not yet sufficient for professional-quality Fortran 90 programs.  I hope  to  add  support
              for  more  features in future releases.  I invite volunteers to assist in this task.  See the ToDo
              file in the source code distribution for details.  The attributes currently accepted, besides  all
              the  usual  data  types, are DIMENSION, EXTERNAL, INTRINSIC, PARAMETER, and SAVE.  The new form of
              declaration also allows  assignment  of  values  to  the  variables  declared.   At  present,  the
              (LEN=<u>value)</u>  form  of  specifying  character lengths is also accepted.  Kind specifications, using
              (KIND=<u>value)</u> are parsed but are not processed: all kinds are treated as default kind.  Also, there
              is little checking of these declarations beyond basic syntax.

              Many commonly  found  nonstandard  intrinsic  functions  are  provided.   See  the  discussion  of
              <b>-intrinsic</b> for a list of functions and how to control which ones are recognized.

              Argument checking is not tight for those nonstandard intrinsics that take arrays or mixed argument
              types.

              <b>ftnchek</b>  permits the INCLUDE statement, which causes inclusion of the text of the given file.  The
              syntax is
                   INCLUDE '<u>filename</u>'
              This is compatible with Fortran 90.  If the <b>-source=vms-include</b> option is given,  <b>ftnchek</b>  follows
              VMS  conventions  with  respect  to  this  statement: it assumes a default extension of <u>.for</u> if no
              filename extension is given, and allows the qualifier /[NO]LIST following the filename, to control
              the listing of the included file.  There is no support for including VMS text modules.

              In diagnostic output relating to items contained in include files, the location of  the  error  is
              specified  by  both its location in the include file and the location in the parent file where the
              file was included.

              <b>ftnchek</b> accepts PARAMETER statements which lack parentheses.  These will be warned  about  if  the
              <b>-f77=param-noparen</b> flag is given.

              <b>ftnchek</b>  accepts  PARAMETER  definitions  that involve intrinsic functions and exponentiation by a
              non-integer exponent.  Both of these cases are prohibited by the Fortran 77 Standard, and will  be
              warned  about  if  the  <b>-f77=param-intrinsic</b>  flag  is given.  If an intrinsic function value is a
              compile-time integer constant, <b>ftnchek</b> will evaluate it.   This  allows  better  checking  if  the
              parameter  is  used  in declaring array sizes.  Fortran 90 allows intrinsic functions in PARAMETER
              definitions.

              The intrinsic functions that are evaluated are:
                                             ABS     IABS   DIM     IDIM    MAX
                                             MAX0    MIN    MIN0    MOD     SIGN
                                             ISIGN   LEN    ICHAR   INDEX

              The functions of integer arguments are evaluated  only  if  the  arguments  are  integer  constant
              expressions.    (These   may  involve  integer  constants,  parameters,  and  evaluated  intrinsic
              functions.)  The function LEN is evaluated  if  its  argument  is  an  expression  involving  only
              character  constants  and variables whose length is not adjustable.  The functions ICHAR and INDEX
              are evaluated only if the arguments are character constants.  <b>ftnchek</b> gives a warning if it  needs
              the value of some intrinsic function that is not evaluated.

</pre><h4><b>NEW</b> <b>FEATURES</b></h4><pre>
       Here are the changes from Version 3.2 to Version 3.3:

       1.  Front-end  has  been  rewritten for unlimited lookahead, eliminating the longstanding bug that caused
           incorrect interpretation of statements whose ambiguity was not resolved in the first line.

       2.  The <b>-mkhtml</b> option is now available in the MS-DOS version.

       3.  Added support for Fortran 90 pointer related syntax: ALLOCATE, DEALLOCATE,  and  NULLIFY  statements;
           the  ALLOCATABLE,  POINTER and TARGET attributes in type declarations; the pointer assigment operator
           =&gt; and intrinsic functions ALLOCATED and  ASSOCIATED;  and  deferred-shape  array  declarations.   At
           present  these  new syntax features are accepted but not properly checked.  This feature was added by
           Robert Landrito.

       4.  The <b>-f77</b> and <b>-f90</b> <b>pointer</b> option controlling warnings about ``Cray pointers''  has  been  renamed  to
           <b>cray-pointer</b>.   The  <b>-f77=pointer</b> option now instead controls warnings for code containing Fortran 90
           pointer-related syntax.

       5.  Re-implemented <b>-mkhtml</b> processing so it is now much faster on source files containing many routines.

       6.  Changed the arrangement of the test  directory  so  there  is  no  longer  any  need  to  modify  the
           distribution in order to run the test suite (<u>check.bat</u>) under MS-DOS.

       7.  Fixed bug in reading numeric settings on command line when setting name abbreviated to 3 characters.

       8.  Fixed bug causing spurious warning for a GOTO referring to a labeled END statement when the statement
           before END was a FORMAT.

       9.  New  flag  <b>-f77=character</b> to control warnings about extensions to the Fortran 77 character data type.
           Accompanying this new flag is support for Fortran 90 rules for character variable  declarations  that
           evaluate to zero or negative length, allowing them and treating negative length values as zero.

       10. Fixed minor bug in printing of comments and blank lines following last END statement in <b>-list</b> mode.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ftnchek</b>  still  has  much room for improvement.  Your feedback is appreciated.  We want to know about any
       bugs you notice.  Bugs include not only cases in which <b>ftnchek</b> issues an error  message  where  no  error
       exists,  but  also  if <b>ftnchek</b> fails to issue a warning when it ought to.  Note, however, that <b>ftnchek</b> is
       not intended to catch all syntax errors (see section on Limitations).  Also, it is not considered  a  bug
       for  a variable to be reported as used before set, if the reason is that the usage of the variable occurs
       prior in the text to where the variable is set.  For instance,  this  could  occur  when  a  GOTO  causes
       execution  to  loop backward to some previously skipped statements.  <b>ftnchek</b> does not analyze the program
       flow, but assumes that statements occurring earlier in the text are executed before the following ones.

       We especially want to know if <b>ftnchek</b> crashes for any reason.  It is  not  supposed  to  crash,  even  on
       programs  with  syntax  errors.   Suggestions  are  welcomed for additional features which you would find
       useful.  Tell us if any of <b>ftnchek</b>'s messages are incomprehensible.   Comments  on  the  readability  and
       accuracy of this document are also welcome.

       You  may  also suggest support for additional extensions to the Fortran language.  These will be included
       only if it is felt that the extensions are sufficiently widely accepted by compilers.

       If you find a bug in <b>ftnchek</b>, first consult the list of known bugs below to see if it  has  already  been
       reported.   Also  check  the  section entitled ``Limitations and Extensions'' above for restrictions that
       could be causing the problem.  If you do not find the problem documented in either  place,  then  send  a
       report including

       1.  The operating system and CPU type on which <b>ftnchek</b> is running.

       2.  The  version  of  <b>ftnchek</b>  and values of any environment options or settings defined in startup file.
           (Capturing the output of ftnchek -help is useful for this.)

       3.  A brief description of the bug.

       4.  If possible, a small sample program showing the bug.

       The  report  should  be  sent  to  Dr.  Robert  Moniot  (see  contact  information  in  section  entitled
       ``Installation and Support'').

       Highest priority will be given to bugs which cause <b>ftnchek</b> to crash.

       Certain problems that arise when checking large programs can be fixed by increasing the sizes of the data
       areas  in  <b>ftnchek</b>.   (These  problems are generally signaled by error messages beginning with ``Oops''.)
       The simplest way to increase the table sizes is by recompiling <b>ftnchek</b> with the LARGE_MACHINE macro  name
       defined.  Consult the makefile and README file for the method of doing this.

       The following is a list of known bugs.

       1.  Bug:  Used-before-set  message  is  suppressed for any variable which is used as the loop index in an
           implied-do loop, even if it was in fact used  before  being  set  in  some  earlier  statement.   For
           example, consider J in the statement

                 WRITE(5,*) (A(J), J=1,10)

           Here  <b>ftnchek</b>  parses  the  I/O  expression, A(J), where J is used, before it parses the implied loop
           where J is set.  Normally this would cause <b>ftnchek</b> to report a spurious used-before-set  warning  for
           J.   Since this report is usually in error and occurs fairly commonly, <b>ftnchek</b> suppresses the warning
           for J altogether.

           Prognosis: A future version of  <b>ftnchek</b> is planned which will handle implied-do loops correctly.

       2.  Bug: Variables used (not as arguments) in statement-function subprograms  do  not  have  their  usage
           status updated when the statement function is invoked.

           Prognosis: To be fixed in a future version of <b>ftnchek</b>.

       3.  Bug:  VAX  version  does  not  expand wildcards in filenames on the command line if they are followed
           without space by an option, e.g.  ftnchek *.f/calltree would not expand the  *.f.   This  is  because
           VMS-style  options  without intervening space are not supported by the GNU shell_mung routine that is
           used to expand wildcards.

           Prognosis: unlikely to be fixed.

       4.  Bug: checking for nonstandard format edit descriptors is done  only  in  FORMAT  statements,  not  in
           character strings used as formats.

           Prognosis: may be fixed someday.

</pre><h4><b>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ftnchek</b>  was designed by Dr. Robert Moniot, professor at Fordham University.  During the academic year of
       1988-1989, Michael Myers and Lucia Spagnuolo developed the program to perform the variable usage  checks.
       During  the following year it was augmented by Lois Bigbie to check subprogram arguments and COMMON block
       declarations.  Brian Downing assisted with the implementation of the INCLUDE statement.  John Quinn wrote
       the common block usage checks.  Heba Elsayed wrote the label  table  printout  and  label  usage  checks.
       Nelson  H.  F.  Beebe  of  the  University  of Utah added most of the new code to implement the <b>-makedcls</b>
       feature and wrote the dcl2inc script.  The <b>-mkhtml</b> feature was contributed by Mark McVeigh  of  Framatome
       ANP, Inc.  The <b>-reference</b> feature was contributed by Gerome Emmanuel, Ecole des mines, U. Nancy (slightly
       modified).   The  <b>-vcg</b>  option  was  contributed  by  Dr. Philip Rubini of Cranfield University, UK.  The
       support for Cray pointer syntax was provided by John Dannenhoffer of United Technologies Research Center.
       John C. Bollinger of Indiana University added the parser syntax for the SELECT  CASE  construct.   Robert
       Landrito  added the parser syntax for F90 pointer-related features.  Additional features will be added as
       time permits.  As of Version 2.5, the name was changed from <b>forchek</b> to <b>ftnchek</b>, to avoid confusion with a
       similar program named <b>forcheck</b>, developed earlier at Leiden University.

</pre><h4><b>INSTALLATION</b> <b>AND</b> <b>SUPPORT</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>ftnchek</b>  program  is free software.  It can be obtained by anonymous ftp from many software servers,
       including <a href="ftp://netlib.org/fortran">ftp://netlib.org/fortran</a> .  Note that  on  Netlib  the  distribution  is  named  <u>ftnchek.tar.gz</u>
       whereas  on  most other servers the file name includes the version number, e.g. <u>ftnchek-3.3.0.tar.gz</u>.  If
       the file extension is <u>.Z</u>, uncompress with the Unix <b><a href="../man1/uncompress.1.html">uncompress</a></b>(1) utility.  If the file extension is  <u>.gz</u>,
       uncompress with the GNU <b><a href="../man1L/gunzip.1L.html">gunzip</a></b>(1L) program.  Then use <b><a href="../man1/tar.1.html">tar</a></b>(1) to unpack the files into a subdirectory.

       Installation  requires  a  C  compiler  for  your  computer.   See  the  INSTALL  file  provided with the
       distribution for instructions on installing <b>ftnchek</b> on your system.   Executable  binary  for  particular
       systems   such   as  IBM  PC  or  Macintosh,  as  available,  can  be  obtained  by  anonymous  ftp  from
       <a href="ftp://ftp.dsm.fordham.edu/pub/ftnchek">ftp://ftp.dsm.fordham.edu/pub/ftnchek</a> .  Assistance in preparing such executable binary forms is welcome.

       The <b>nroff</b> version of this document is named <u>ftnchek.man</u>.  On UNIX systems, this file can be used  as  the
       man  page, but actually it is a multi-purpose source file which is used to produce the other forms of the
       documentation.  The cleaned-up man page document,  created  during  installation  of  <b>ftnchek</b>,  is  named
       <u>ftnchek.1</u>.   The distribution also includes a plain ASCII version named <u>ftnchek.doc</u>, a PostScript version
       named <u>ftnchek.ps</u>, an HTML version in directory <u>html</u>, and a VMS HELP version named <u>ftnchek.hlp</u>.

       Information about the latest version and the status of the project can be obtained by visiting  <b>ftnchek</b>'s
       home  page,  <a href="http://www.dsm.fordham.edu/~ftnchek">http://www.dsm.fordham.edu/~ftnchek</a>  .   For further information and to report bugs, you may
       contact Dr. Robert Moniot, whose contact information can be found by  a  Web  search  for  his  name  and
       Fordham  University.   (E-mail address is not provided here because it attracts unsolicited commercial e-
       mail, but it is easily constructed by combining his last name with the name of the university and the edu
       domain.)
