</pre><h4><b>PROLOG</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       vi — screen-oriented (visual) display editor

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       vi <b>[</b>-rR<b>]</b> <b>[</b>-c <u>command</u><b>]</b> <b>[</b>-t <u>tagstring</u><b>]</b> <b>[</b>-w <u>size</u><b>]</b> <b>[</b><u>file</u>...<b>]</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This  utility  shall  be  provided on systems that both support the User Portability Utilities option and
       define the POSIX2_CHAR_TERM symbol.  On other systems it is optional.

       The <u>vi</u> (visual) utility is a screen-oriented text editor. Only the open and visual modes  of  the  editor
       are  described  in  POSIX.1‐2008;  see the line editor <u>ex</u> for additional editing capabilities used in <u>vi</u>.
       The user can switch back and forth between <u>vi</u> and <u>ex</u> and execute <u>ex</u> commands from within <u>vi</u>.

       This reference page uses the term  <u>edit</u>  <u>buffer</u>  to  describe  the  current  working  text.  No  specific
       implementation  is  implied  by  this  term. All editing changes are performed on the edit buffer, and no
       changes to it shall affect any file until an editor command writes the file.

       When using <u>vi</u>, the terminal screen acts as a window into the editing buffer. Changes made to the  editing
       buffer  shall be reflected in the screen display; the position of the cursor on the screen shall indicate
       the position within the editing buffer.

       Certain terminals do not have all the capabilities necessary to support the complete <u>vi</u> definition.  When
       these  commands  cannot be supported on such terminals, this condition shall not produce an error message
       such as ``not an editor command'' or report a syntax error. The  implementation  may  either  accept  the
       commands  and  produce  results  on the screen that are the result of an unsuccessful attempt to meet the
       requirements of  this  volume  of  POSIX.1‐2017  or  report  an  error  describing  the  terminal-related
       deficiency.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>vi</u> utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <u>Section</u> <u>12.2</u>, <u>Utility</u> <u>Syntax</u>
       <u>Guidelines</u>, except that <b>'+'</b> may be recognized as an option delimiter as well as <b>'-'</b>.

       The following options shall be supported:

       <b>-c</b> <u>command</u>
                 See the <u>ex</u> command description of the <b>-c</b> option.

       <b>-r</b>        See the <u>ex</u> command description of the <b>-r</b> option.

       <b>-R</b>        See the <u>ex</u> command description of the <b>-R</b> option.

       <b>-t</b> <u>tagstring</u>
                 See the <u>ex</u> command description of the <b>-t</b> option.

       <b>-w</b> <u>size</u>   See the <u>ex</u> command description of the <b>-w</b> option.

</pre><h4><b>OPERANDS</b></h4><pre>
       See the OPERANDS section of the <u>ex</u> command for a description of the operands supported by the <u>vi</u> command.

</pre><h4><b>STDIN</b></h4><pre>
       If  standard input is not a terminal device, the results are undefined.  The standard input consists of a
       series of commands and input text, as described in the EXTENDED DESCRIPTION section.

       If a read from the standard input returns an error, or if the editor  detects  an  end-of-file  condition
       from the standard input, it shall be equivalent to a SIGHUP asynchronous event.

</pre><h4><b>INPUT</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       See  the  INPUT  FILES section of the <u>ex</u> command for a description of the input files supported by the <u>vi</u>
       command.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       See the ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES section of the <u>ex</u> command for the environment  variables  that  affect  the
       execution of the <u>vi</u> command.

</pre><h4><b>ASYNCHRONOUS</b> <b>EVENTS</b></h4><pre>
       See  the  ASYNCHRONOUS  EVENTS section of the <u>ex</u> for the asynchronous events that affect the execution of
       the <u>vi</u> command.

</pre><h4><b>STDOUT</b></h4><pre>
       If standard output is not a terminal device, undefined results occur.

       Standard output may be used for writing prompts to the user, for informational messages, and for  writing
       lines from the file.

</pre><h4><b>STDERR</b></h4><pre>
       If standard output is not a terminal device, undefined results occur.

       The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.

</pre><h4><b>OUTPUT</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       See  the OUTPUT FILES section of the <u>ex</u> command for a description of the output files supported by the <u>vi</u>
       command.

</pre><h4><b>EXTENDED</b> <b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       If the terminal does not have the capabilities necessary to support an  unspecified  portion  of  the  <u>vi</u>
       definition,   implementations   shall  start  initially  in  <u>ex</u>  mode  or  open  mode.  Otherwise,  after
       initialization, <u>vi</u> shall be in command mode; text input mode can be entered by one  of  several  commands
       used  to  insert  or  change text. In text input mode, &lt;ESC&gt; can be used to return to command mode; other
       uses of &lt;ESC&gt; are described later in this section; see <u>Terminate</u> <u>Command</u> <u>or</u> <u>Input</u> <u>Mode</u>.

   <b>Initialization</b> <b>in</b> <b>ex</b> <b>and</b> <b>vi</b>
       See <u>Initialization</u> <u>in</u> <u>ex</u> <u>and</u> <u>vi</u> for a description of <u>ex</u> and <u>vi</u> initialization for the <u>vi</u> utility.

   <b>Command</b> <b>Descriptions</b> <b>in</b> <b>vi</b>
       The following symbols are used in this reference page to represent arguments to commands.

       <u>buffer</u>  See the description of <u>buffer</u> in the EXTENDED DESCRIPTION section of the <u>ex</u> utility; see  <u>Command</u>
               <u>Descriptions</u> <u>in</u> <u>ex</u>.

               In  open  and  visual mode, when a command synopsis shows both [<u>buffer</u>] and [<u>count</u>] preceding the
               command name, they can be specified in either order.

       <u>count</u>   A positive integer used as an optional argument to most commands, either to give a  repeat  count
               or as a size. This argument is optional and shall default to 1 unless otherwise specified.

               The  Synopsis lines for the <u>vi</u> commands &lt;control&gt;‐G, &lt;control&gt;‐L, &lt;control&gt;‐R, &lt;control&gt;‐], <b>%</b>, <b>&amp;</b>,
               <b>^</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>m</b>, <b>M</b>, <b>Q</b>, <b>u</b>, <b>U</b>, and <b>ZZ</b> do not have <u>count</u> as an optional argument. Regardless, it  shall  not
               be an error to specify a <u>count</u> to these commands, and any specified <u>count</u> shall be ignored.

       <u>motion</u>  An  optional  trailing  argument  used  by  the  <b>!</b>,  <b>&lt;</b>, <b>&gt;</b>, <b>c</b>, <b>d</b>, and <b>y</b> commands, which is used to
               indicate the region of text that shall be affected by the command. The motion can be  either  one
               of  the  command characters repeated or one of several other <u>vi</u> commands (listed in the following
               table). Each of the applicable commands specifies the region of text  matched  by  repeating  the
               command;  each  command  that  can  be  used  as a motion command specifies the region of text it
               affects.

               Commands that take <u>motion</u> arguments operate on either  lines  or  characters,  depending  on  the
               circumstances.  When  operating on lines, all lines that fall partially or wholly within the text
               region specified for the command shall be affected. When operating on characters, only the  exact
               characters  in  the  specified  text region shall be affected. Each motion command specifies this
               individually.

               When commands that may be motion commands are not used as motion commands,  they  shall  set  the
               current position to the current line and column as specified.

               The following commands shall be valid cursor motion commands:

                   &lt;apostrophe&gt;       (    -    j    H
                   &lt;carriage-return&gt;  )    $    k    L
                   &lt;comma&gt;            [[   %    l    M
                   &lt;control&gt;-H        ]]   _    n    N
                   &lt;control&gt;-N        {    ;    t    T
                   &lt;control&gt;-P        }    ?    w    W
                   &lt;grave-accent&gt;     ^    b    B
                   &lt;newline&gt;          +    e    E
                   &lt;space&gt;            |    f    F
                   &lt;zero&gt;             /    h    G

               Any  <u>count</u>  that is specified to a command that has an associated motion command shall be applied
               to the motion command. If a <u>count</u> is applied to  both  the  command  and  its  associated  motion
               command, the effect shall be multiplicative.

       The following symbols are used in this section to specify locations in the edit buffer:

       <u>current</u> <u>character</u>
               The character that is currently indicated by the cursor.

       <u>end</u> <u>of</u> <u>a</u> <u>line</u>
               The  point  located  between  the  last non-&lt;newline&gt; (if any) and the terminating &lt;newline&gt; of a
               line. For an empty line, this location coincides with the beginning of the line.

       <u>end</u> <u>of</u> <u>the</u> <u>edit</u> <u>buffer</u>
               The location corresponding to the end of the last line in the edit buffer.

       The following symbols are used in this section to specify command actions:

       <u>bigword</u> In the POSIX locale, <u>vi</u> shall recognize four kinds of <u>bigwords</u>:

                1. A maximal sequence of non-&lt;blank&gt; characters preceded and followed by &lt;blank&gt;  characters  or
                   the beginning or end of a line or the edit buffer

                2. One or more sequential blank lines

                3. The first character in the edit buffer

                4. The last non-&lt;newline&gt; in the edit buffer

       <u>word</u>    In the POSIX locale, <u>vi</u> shall recognize five kinds of words:

                1. A maximal sequence of letters, digits, and underscores, delimited at both ends by:

                   --  Characters other than letters, digits, or underscores

                   --  The beginning or end of the edit buffer

                2. A  maximal  sequence  of  characters  other  than  letters,  digits,  underscores, or &lt;blank&gt;
                   characters, delimited at both ends by:

                   --  A letter, digit, underscore

                   --  &lt;blank&gt; characters

                   --  The beginning or end of a line

                   --  The beginning or end of the edit buffer

                5. The last non-&lt;newline&gt; in the edit buffer

       <u>section</u> <u>boundary</u>
               A <u>section</u> <u>boundary</u> is one of the following:

                1. A line whose first character is a &lt;form-feed&gt;

                2. A line whose first character is an open curly brace (<b>'{'</b>)

                3. A line whose first character is a &lt;period&gt; and whose second and third characters match a two-
                   character pair in the <b>sections</b> edit option (see <u>ex</u>)

                4. A line whose first character is a &lt;period&gt; and whose only other character matches  the  first
                   character  of a two-character pair in the <b>sections</b> edit option, where the second character of
                   the two-character pair is a &lt;space&gt;

                5. The first line of the edit buffer

                6. The last line of the edit buffer if the last line of the edit buffer is empty or if it  is  a
                   <b>]]</b> or <b>}</b> command; otherwise, the last non-&lt;newline&gt; of the last line of the edit buffer

       <u>paragraph</u> <u>boundary</u>

                   character of a two-character pair in the <u>paragraphs</u> edit option, where the  second  character
                   of the two-character pair is a &lt;space&gt;

                4. One or more sequential blank lines

       <u>remembered</u> <u>search</u> <u>direction</u>
               See the description of <u>remembered</u> <u>search</u> <u>direction</u> in <u>ex</u>.

       <u>sentence</u> <u>boundary</u>
               A <u>sentence</u> <u>boundary</u> is one of the following:

                1. A paragraph boundary

                2. The first non-&lt;blank&gt; that occurs after a paragraph boundary

                3. The  first  non-&lt;blank&gt;  that  occurs  after  a  &lt;period&gt; (<b>'.'</b>), &lt;exclamation-mark&gt; (<b>'!'</b>), or

                   closing parenthesis (<b>')'</b>),  closing  brackets  (<b>']'</b>),  double-quote  (<b>'"'</b>),  or  single-quote
                   (&lt;apostrophe&gt;)  characters  can  appear  between  the  punctuation  mark  and the two &lt;space&gt;
                   characters or end-of-line

       In the remainder of the description of the <u>vi</u> utility, the term ``buffer line'' refers to a line  in  the
       edit  buffer  and  the  term  ``display  line'' refers to the line or lines on the display screen used to
       display one buffer line. The term ``current line'' refers to a specific ``buffer line''.

       If there are display lines on the screen for which there are no corresponding buffer lines  because  they
       correspond  to lines that would be after the end of the file, they shall be displayed as a single &lt;tilde&gt;
       (<b>'~'</b>) character, plus the terminating &lt;newline&gt;.

       The last line of the screen shall be used to report errors or display informational  messages.  It  shall
       also  be used to display the input for ``line-oriented commands'' (<b>/</b>, <b>?</b>, <b>:</b>, and <b>!</b>).  When a line-oriented
       command is executed, the editor shall enter text input mode on the last line on  the  screen,  using  the
       respective command characters as prompt characters. (In the case of the <b>!</b>  command, the associated motion
       shall  be  entered  by  the  user before the editor enters text input mode.) The line entered by the user
       shall be terminated by a &lt;newline&gt;, a non-&lt;control&gt;‐V-escaped &lt;carriage-return&gt;, or unescaped &lt;ESC&gt;.   It
       is  unspecified if more characters than require a display width minus one column number of screen columns
       can be entered.

       If any command is executed that overwrites a portion of the screen other than the last line of the screen
       (for example, the <u>ex</u> <b>suspend</b> or <b>!</b>  commands), other than the <u>ex</u> <b>shell</b> command, the user shall be prompted
       for a character before the screen is refreshed and the edit session continued.

       &lt;tab&gt; characters shall take up the number of columns on the screen set by the <b>tabstop</b>  edit  option  (see
       <u>ex</u>),  unless  there  are  less  than that number of columns before the display margin that will cause the
       displayed line to be folded; in this case, they shall only take up the  number  of  columns  up  to  that
       boundary.

       The  cursor  shall  be placed on the current line and relative to the current column as specified by each
       command described in the following sections.

       In open mode, if the current line is not already displayed, then it shall be displayed.

       In visual mode, if the current line is not  displayed,  then  the  lines  that  are  displayed  shall  be
       expanded,  scrolled,  or  redrawn to cause an unspecified portion of the current line to be displayed. If
       the screen is redrawn, no more than the number of display lines specified by the value of the <b>window</b> edit
       option shall be displayed (unless the current line cannot  be  completely  displayed  in  the  number  of
       display  lines  specified by the <b>window</b> edit option) and the current line shall be positioned as close to
       the center of the displayed lines as possible (within the constraints imposed by the distance of the line
       from the beginning or end of the edit buffer). If the current line  is  before  the  first  line  in  the
       display  and  the  screen  is scrolled, an unspecified portion of the current line shall be placed on the
       first line of the display. If the current line is after the last line in the display and  the  screen  is
       scrolled, an unspecified portion of the current line shall be placed on the last line of the display.

       In  visual  mode, if a line from the edit buffer (other than the current line) does not entirely fit into
       the lines at the bottom of the display that are available for its presentation, the editor may choose not
       to display any portion of the line. The lines of the display that do  not  contain  text  from  the  edit
       buffer for this reason shall each consist of a single <b>'@'</b> character.

       In  visual  mode,  the  editor  may  choose for unspecified reasons to not update lines in the display to
       correspond to the underlying edit buffer text. The lines of the display that do not correctly  correspond
       to  text  from  the  edit  buffer  for  this  reason  shall  consist  of a single <b>'@'</b> character (plus the
       terminating &lt;newline&gt;), and the &lt;control&gt;‐R command shall cause  the  editor  to  update  the  screen  to
       correctly represent the edit buffer.

       Open and visual mode commands that set the current column set it to a column position in the display, and
       not  a character position in the line. In this case, however, the column position in the display shall be
       calculated for an infinite width display; for example, the column related to a character that is part  of
       a  line  that  has  been  folded onto additional screen lines will be offset from the display line column
       where the buffer line begins, not from the beginning of a particular display line.

       The display cursor column in the display is based on the value of the current column,  as  follows,  with
       each rule applied in turn:

        1. If  the  current column is after the last display line column used by the displayed line, the display
           cursor column shall be set to the last display line column occupied by the last non-&lt;newline&gt; in  the
           current line; otherwise, the display cursor column shall be set to the current column.

        2. If  the  character  of  which  some  portion is displayed in the display line column specified by the
           display cursor column requires more than a single display line column:

            a. If in text input mode, the display cursor column shall be adjusted  to  the  first  display  line
               column in which any portion of that character is displayed.

            b. Otherwise,  the  display cursor column shall be adjusted to the last display line column in which
               any portion of that character is displayed.

       The current column shall not be changed by these adjustments to the display cursor column.

       If an error occurs during the parsing or execution of a <u>vi</u> command:

        *  The terminal shall be alerted. Execution of the <u>vi</u> command shall stop, and the cursor  (for  example,
           the current line and column) shall not be further modified.

        *  Unless  otherwise  specified  by  the  following  command  sections,  it  is  unspecified  whether an
           informational message shall be displayed.

        *  Any partially entered <u>vi</u> command shall be discarded.

        *  If the <u>vi</u> command resulted from a <b>map</b> expansion, all characters from  that  <b>map</b>  expansion  shall  be
           discarded, except as otherwise specified by the <b>map</b> command (see <u>ex</u>).

        *  If  the  <u>vi</u>  command  resulted  from  the  execution  of  a buffer, no further commands caused by the
           execution of the buffer shall be executed.

       If in open mode, the &lt;control&gt;‐B command shall behave identically to the <b>z</b>  command.  Otherwise,  if  the
       current line is the first line of the edit buffer, it shall be an error.

       If  the  <b>window</b>  edit option is less than 3, display a screen where the last line of the display shall be

       The  matching  character  shall  be  the  parenthesis,  bracket, or curly brace matching the parenthesis,
       bracket, or curly brace, respectively, that was at the current position or that was found on the  current
       line.

       Matching shall be determined as follows, for an open parenthesis:

        1. Set a counter to 1.

        2. Search forwards until a parenthesis is found or the end of the edit buffer is reached.

        3. If the end of the edit buffer is reached, it shall be an error.

        4. If an open parenthesis is found, increment the counter by 1.

        5. If a close parenthesis is found, decrement the counter by 1.

        6. If the counter is zero, the current character is the matching character.

       Matching for a close parenthesis shall be equivalent, except that the search shall be backwards, from the
       starting  character to the beginning of the buffer, a close parenthesis shall increment the counter by 1,
       and an open parenthesis shall decrement the counter by 1.

       Matching for brackets and curly braces shall be equivalent, except that searching shall be done for  open
       and  close brackets or open and close curly braces. It is implementation-defined whether other characters
       are searched for and matched as well.

       text input mode) executed as a result of  map  expansions,  shall  not  change  the  value  of  the  last
       repeatable command.

       Repeated  commands  with associated motion commands shall repeat the motion command as well; however, any
       specified <u>count</u> shall replace the <u>count</u>(s) that were originally specified to the repeated command or  its
       associated motion command.

       If  the motion component of the repeated command is <b>f</b>, <b>F</b>, <b>t</b>, or <b>T</b>, the repeated command shall not set the
       remembered search character for the <b>;</b> and <b>,</b> commands.

       If the repeated command is <b>p</b> or <b>P</b>, and the buffer associated with that command was a numeric buffer named
       with a number less than 9, the buffer associated with the repeated command shall be set to be the  buffer
       named by the name of the previous buffer logically incremented by 1.

       If  the  repeated  character  is  a  text  input  command, the input text associated with that command is
       repeated literally:

        *  Input characters are neither macro or abbreviation-expanded.

        *  Input characters are not interpreted in any special way with the exception that &lt;newline&gt;, &lt;carriage-
           return&gt;, and &lt;control&gt;‐T behave as described in <u>Input</u> <u>Mode</u> <u>Commands</u> <u>in</u> <u>vi</u>.

   <b>Find</b> <b>Regular</b> <b>Expression</b>
       <u>Synopsis</u>:

                     /

       If the input line contains no non-&lt;newline&gt; characters, it shall be equivalent to a line containing  only
       the  last  regular expression encountered. The enhanced regular expressions supported by <u>vi</u> are described
       in <u>Regular</u> <u>Expressions</u> <u>in</u> <u>ex</u>.

       Otherwise, the line shall be interpreted as one or more regular expressions, optionally  followed  by  an
       address offset or a <u>vi</u> <b>z</b> command.

       If  the  regular  expression  is  not  the  last regular expression on the line, or if a line offset or <b>z</b>
       command is specified, the regular expression shall be terminated by an  unescaped  <b>'/'</b>  character,  which
       shall  not be used as part of the regular expression.  If the regular expression is not the first regular
       expression on the line, it shall be preceded by zero or more &lt;blank&gt; characters, a &lt;semicolon&gt;,  zero  or
       more  &lt;blank&gt;  characters,  and  a  leading  <b>'/'</b> character, which shall not be interpreted as part of the
       regular expression. It shall be an error to precede any regular expression with any characters other than
       these.

       Each search shall begin from the character after the first character of the last match (or, if it is  the
       first  search,  after  the  cursor). If the <b>wrapscan</b> edit option is set, the search shall continue to the
       character before the starting cursor character; otherwise, to the end of the edit buffer. It shall be  an
       error  if  any  search  fails  to  find  a  match,  and  an informational message to this effect shall be
       displayed.

       An optional address offset (see <u>Addressing</u> <u>in</u> <u>ex</u>) can be specified after the last regular  expression  by
       including  a  trailing <b>'/'</b> character after the regular expression and specifying the address offset. This
       offset will be from the line containing the match for the last regular expression specified. It shall  be
       an  error  if  the line offset would indicate a line address less than 1 or greater than the last line in
       the edit buffer. An address offset of zero shall be supported. It shall be an error to follow the address
       offset with any other characters than &lt;blank&gt; characters.

       If not used as a motion command, an optional <b>z</b> command (see <u>Redraw</u> <u>Window</u>) can  be  specified  after  the
       last  regular expression by including a trailing <b>'/'</b> character after the regular expression, zero or more
       &lt;blank&gt; characters, a <b>'z'</b>, zero or more &lt;blank&gt; characters, an optional new  <b>window</b>  edit  option  value,
       zero  or  more  &lt;blank&gt; characters, and a location character. The effect shall be as if the <b>z</b> command was
       executed after the <b>/</b> command. It shall be an error to follow the <b>z</b> command with any other characters than
       &lt;blank&gt; characters.

       The remembered search direction shall be set to forward.

       If used as a motion command:

        1. It shall be an error if the last match references the same  character  in  the  edit  buffer  as  the
           starting cursor.

        2. If  any  address  offset  is  specified,  the last match shall be adjusted by the specified offset as
           described previously.

        3. If the starting cursor is after the last match, then the locations of the  starting  cursor  and  the
           last match in the edit buffer shall be logically swapped.

        4. If  any address offset is specified, the text region shall consist of all lines containing characters
           from the starting cursor to the last match line, inclusive, and any text copied to a buffer shall  be
           in line mode.

        5. Otherwise, if the starting line is empty or the starting cursor is at or before the first non-&lt;blank&gt;
           non-&lt;newline&gt;  of the starting line, and the last match line is empty or the last match starts at the
           first character of the last match line, the  text  region  shall  consist  of  all  lines  containing
           characters  from  the starting cursor to the line before the last match line, inclusive, and any text
           copied to a buffer shall be in line mode.

        6. Otherwise, if the last match line is empty or the last match begins at a character at or  before  the
           first  non-&lt;blank&gt; non-&lt;newline&gt; of the last match line, the region of text shall be from the current
           cursor to the last non-&lt;newline&gt; of the line before the last match  line,  inclusive,  and  any  text
           copied to a buffer shall be in character mode.

        7. Otherwise, the region of text shall be from the current cursor (inclusive), to the first character of
           the last match (exclusive), and any text copied to a buffer shall be in character mode.

       If not used as a motion command:

       <u>Current</u>  <u>line</u>:  If  a  match  is  found,  set  to  the last matched line plus the address offset, if any;
       otherwise, unchanged.

       <u>Current</u> <u>column</u>: Set to the last column on which any portion of the first character in  the  last  matched

       If <u>count</u> is not specified, it shall default to the  <b>window</b>  edit  option  -1.  The  <b>z</b>  command  shall  be
       equivalent  to  the  <u>ex</u>  <b>z</b>  command,  with a type character of <b>=</b> and a <u>count</u> of <u>count</u> -2, except that the
       current line and current column shall be set as  follows,  and  the  <b>window</b>  edit  option  shall  not  be

                     <b>[</b><u>line</u><b>]</b> z <b>[</b><u>count</u><b>]</b> <u>character</u>

       If <u>line</u> is not specified, it shall default to the current line. If <u>line</u> is specified, but is greater than
       the number of lines in the edit buffer, it shall default to the number of lines in the edit buffer.

       If  <u>count</u> is specified, the value of the <b>window</b> edit option shall be set to <u>count</u> (as described in the <u>ex</u>
       <b>window</b> command), and the screen shall be redrawn.

       <u>line</u> shall be placed as specified by the following characters:

       &lt;newline&gt;, &lt;carriage-return&gt;
             Place the beginning of the line on the first line of the display.

       .     Place the beginning of the line in the center of the display. The middle line of the display  shall
             be calculated as described for the <b>M</b> command.

       -     Place an unspecified portion of the line on the last line of the display.

       +     If  <u>line</u>  was  specified,  equivalent  to  the &lt;newline&gt; case. If <u>line</u> was not specified, display a
             screen where the first line of the display shall be (current last line) +1. If there are  no  lines
             after the last line in the display, it shall be an error.

       ^     If  <u>line</u>  was  specified,  display  a  screen  where  the last line of the display shall contain an
             unspecified portion of the first line of a display that had an unspecified portion of the specified
             line on the last line of the display. If this calculation results in a line before the beginning of
             the edit buffer, display the first screen of the edit buffer.

             Otherwise, display a screen where the last line of the display shall contain an unspecified portion
             of (current first line -1). If this calculation results in a line before the beginning of the  edit
             buffer, it shall be an error.

       <u>Current</u> <u>line</u>: If <u>line</u> and the <b>'^'</b> character were specified:

        1. If  the  first screen was displayed as a result of the command attempting to display lines before the
           beginning of the edit buffer: if the first screen was already displayed, unchanged; otherwise, set to
           (current first line -1).

        2. Otherwise, set to the last line of the display.

       If <u>line</u> and the <b>'+'</b> character were specified, set to the first line of the display.

       Otherwise, if <u>line</u> was specified, set to <u>line</u>.

       Otherwise, unchanged.

       <u>Current</u> <u>column</u>: Set to non-&lt;blank&gt;.

   <b>Exit</b>
       <u>Synopsis</u>:

                     ZZ

       This command shall be equivalent to the <u>ex</u> <b>xit</b> command with no addresses, trailing <b>!</b>,  or  filename  (see
       the <u>ex</u> <b>xit</b> command).

   <b>Input</b> <b>Mode</b> <b>Commands</b> <b>in</b> <b>vi</b>
       In  text input mode, the current line shall consist of zero or more of the following categories, plus the
       terminating &lt;newline&gt;:

        1. Characters preceding the text input entry point

           Characters in this category shall not be modified during text input mode.

        2. <b>autoindent</b> characters

           <b>autoindent</b> characters shall be automatically inserted into each line that is created  in  text  input
           mode, either as a result of entering a &lt;newline&gt; or &lt;carriage-return&gt; while in text input mode, or as
           an  effect  of the command itself; for example, <b>O</b> or <b>o</b> (see the <u>ex</u> <b>autoindent</b> command), as if entered
           by the user.

           It shall be possible to erase <b>autoindent</b> characters with the &lt;control&gt;‐D command; it  is  unspecified
           whether  they  can  be  erased  by  &lt;control&gt;‐H, &lt;control&gt;‐U, and &lt;control&gt;‐W characters. Erasing any
           <b>autoindent</b> character turns the glyph into erase-columns and  deletes  the  character  from  the  edit
           buffer, but does not change its representation on the screen.

        3. Text input characters

           Text  input characters are the characters entered by the user. Erasing any text input character turns
           the glyph into erase-columns and deletes the character from the edit buffer, but does not change  its
           representation on the screen.

           Each text input character entered by the user (that does not have a special meaning) shall be treated
           as follows:

            a. The  text  input  character  shall  be appended to the last character in the edit buffer from the
               first, second, or third categories.

            b. If there are no erase-columns on the screen, the text  input  command  was  the  <b>R</b>  command,  and
               characters  in  the  fifth  category  from  the  original  line  follow the cursor, the next such
               character shall be deleted from the edit buffer. If the <b>slowopen</b> edit  option  is  not  set,  the
               corresponding glyph on the screen shall become erase-columns.

            c. If  there  are  erase-columns on the screen, as many columns as they occupy, or as are necessary,
               shall be overwritten to display the text input character. (If only part of a  multi-column  glyph
               is  overwritten,  the remainder shall be left on the screen, and continue to be treated as erase-
               columns; it is unspecified whether the remainder of the glyph is modified in any way.)

            d. If additional display line columns are needed to display the text input character:

                i.  If the <b>slowopen</b> edit option is  set,  the  text  input  characters  shall  be  displayed  on
                    subsequent display line columns, overwriting any characters displayed in those columns.

               ii.  Otherwise,  any  characters  currently  displayed on or after the column on the display line
                    where the text input character is to be displayed  shall  be  pushed  ahead  the  number  of
                    display line columns necessary to display the rest of the text input character.

        4. Erase-columns

           Erase-columns  are  not  logically  part of the edit buffer, appearing only on the screen, and may be
           overwritten on the screen by subsequent text input characters. When text input mode ends, all  erase-
           columns shall no longer appear on the screen.

           Erase-columns  are  initially  the  region  of text specified by the <b>c</b> command (see <u>Change</u>); however,
           erasing <b>autoindent</b> or text input characters causes the glyphs of the erased characters to be  treated
           as erase-columns.

        5. Characters  following  the text region for the <b>c</b> command, or the text input entry point for all other
           commands

           Characters in this category shall not be modified during text input  mode,  except  as  specified  in
           category  3.b.  for  the  <b>R</b>  text input command, or as &lt;blank&gt; characters deleted when a &lt;newline&gt; or
           &lt;carriage-return&gt; is entered.

       It is unspecified whether it is an error to attempt to erase past  the  beginning  of  a  line  that  was
       created  by  the entry of a &lt;newline&gt; or &lt;carriage-return&gt; during text input mode. If it is not an error,
       the editor shall behave as if the erasing character was entered immediately after  the  last  text  input
       character entered on the previous line, and all of the non-&lt;newline&gt; characters on the current line shall
       be treated as erase-columns.

       When text input mode is entered, or after a text input mode character is entered (except as specified for
       the special characters below), the cursor shall be positioned as follows:

        1. On the first column that displays any part of the first erase-column, if one exists

        2. Otherwise,  if  the  <b>slowopen</b>  edit  option  is  set, on the first display line column after the last
           character in the first, second, or third categories, if one exists

        3. Otherwise, the first column that displays any part of the first character in the fifth  category,  if
           one exists

        4. Otherwise,  the  display  line  column  after  the  last  character  in  the  first, second, or third
           categories, if one exists

        5. Otherwise, on column position 1

       The characters that are updated on the screen during text input mode are unspecified, other than that the
       last text input character shall always be updated, and, if the <b>slowopen</b>  edit  option  is  not  set,  the
       current cursor character shall always be updated.

       The following specifications are for command characters entered during text input mode.

   <b>NUL</b>
       <u>Synopsis</u>:

                     NUL

       If  the  first  character  of  the text input is a NUL, the most recently input text shall be input as if
       entered by the user, and then text input mode shall be exited. The text shall be  input  literally;  that
       is,  characters  are  neither  macro  or abbreviation expanded, nor are any characters interpreted in any
       special manner. It is unspecified whether implementations shall support more than 256 bytes of remembered
       input text.

   <b>&lt;control&gt;-D</b>
       <u>Synopsis</u>:

                     &lt;control&gt;-D

       The &lt;control&gt;‐D character shall have no special meaning when in  text  input  mode  for  a  line-oriented
       command (see <u>Command</u> <u>Descriptions</u> <u>in</u> <u>vi</u>).

       This command need not be supported on block-mode terminals.

       If  the  cursor  does  not  follow  an  <b>autoindent</b> character, or an <b>autoindent</b> character and a <b>'0'</b> or <b>'^'</b>
       character:

        1. If the cursor is in column position 1, the &lt;control&gt;‐D character shall be discarded  and  no  further
           action taken.

       If  in text input mode for a line-oriented command, and there are no characters to erase, text input mode
       shall be terminated, no further action shall be done for this command, and the current  line  and  column
       shall be unchanged.

       If  there are characters other than <b>autoindent</b> characters that have been input on the current line before

</pre><h4><b>APPLICATION</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>RATIONALE</b></h4><pre>
       See the RATIONALE for <u>ex</u> for more information on <u>vi</u>.  Major portions  of  the  <u>vi</u>  utility  specification
       point  to  <u>ex</u>  to  avoid  inadvertent divergence. While <u>ex</u> and <u>vi</u> have historically been implemented as a
       single utility, this is not required by POSIX.1‐2008.

       It is recognized that portions of <u>vi</u> would be difficult, if not impossible, to  implement  satisfactorily
       on a block-mode terminal, or a terminal without any form of cursor addressing, thus it is not a mandatory
       requirement  that  such  features  should  work on all terminals. It is the intention, however, that a <u>vi</u>
       implementation should provide the full set of capabilities on all terminals capable of supporting them.

       Historically, <u>vi</u> exited immediately if the standard input was not a terminal. POSIX.1‐2008  permits,  but
       does  not require, this behavior. An end-of-file condition is not equivalent to an end-of-file character.
       A common end-of-file character, &lt;control&gt;‐D, is historically a <u>vi</u> command.

       The text in  the  STDOUT  section  reflects  the  usage  of  the  verb  <u>display</u>  in  this  section;  some
       implementations  of  <u>vi</u>  use  standard output to write to the terminal, but POSIX.1‐2008 does not require
       that to be the case.

       Historically, implementations reverted to open mode if the terminal  was  incapable  of  supporting  full
       visual  mode.  POSIX.1‐2008  requires  this  behavior.  Historically, the open mode of <u>vi</u> behaved roughly
       equivalently to the visual mode, with the exception that only a single line from  the  edit  buffer  (one
       ``buffer  line'') was kept current at any time. This line was normally displayed on the next-to-last line
       of a terminal with cursor addressing (and the last line performed its normal visual functions  for  line-
       oriented  commands and messages). In addition, some few commands behaved differently in open mode than in
       visual mode. POSIX.1‐2008 requires conformance to historical practice.

       Historically, <u>ex</u> and <u>vi</u> implementations have expected text to proceed in the usual  European/Latin  order
       of  left  to  right,  top  to  bottom. There is no requirement in POSIX.1‐2008 that this be the case. The
       specification was deliberately written using words like ``before'', ``after'', ``first'', and ``last'' in
       order to permit implementations to support the natural text order of the language.

       Historically, lines past the end of the edit buffer were marked with  single  &lt;tilde&gt;  (<b>'~'</b>)  characters;
       that  is, if the one-based display was 20 lines in length, and the last line of the file was on line one,
       then lines 2-20 would contain only a single <b>'~'</b> character.

       Historically, the <u>vi</u> editor attempted to display only complete lines at the bottom of the screen (it  did
       display  partial  lines  at  the top of the screen). If a line was too long to fit in its entirety at the
       bottom of the screen, the screen lines where the line would have been displayed were displayed as  single
       <b>'@'</b>  characters, instead of displaying part of the line. POSIX.1‐2008 permits, but does not require, this
       behavior. Implementations are encouraged to attempt always to display a complete line at  the  bottom  of
       the screen when doing scrolling or screen positioning by buffer lines.

       Historically,  lines marked with <b>'@'</b> were also used to minimize output to dumb terminals over slow lines;
       that is, changes local to the cursor were updated, but changes to lines on the screen that were not close
       to the cursor were simply marked with an <b>'@'</b> sign instead of being updated to  match  the  current  text.
       POSIX.1‐2008  permits,  but  does  not  require  this  feature because it is used ever less frequently as
       terminals become smarter and connections are faster.

   <b>Initialization</b> <b>in</b> <b>ex</b> <b>and</b> <b>vi</b>
       Historically, <u>vi</u> always had a line in the edit buffer,  even  if  the  edit  buffer  was  ``empty''.  For
       example:

        1. The <u>ex</u> command <b>=</b> executed from visual mode wrote ``1'' when the buffer was empty.

        2. Writes  from  visual  mode  of  an empty edit buffer wrote files of a single character (a &lt;newline&gt;),
           while writes from <u>ex</u> mode of an empty edit buffer wrote empty files.

        3. Put and read commands into an empty edit buffer left an empty line at the top of the edit buffer.

       For consistency, POSIX.1‐2008 does not permit any of these behaviors.

       Historically, <u>vi</u> did not always return the terminal  to  its  original  modes;  for  example,  ICRNL  was
       modified if it was not originally set. POSIX.1‐2008 does not permit this behavior.

   <b>Command</b> <b>Descriptions</b> <b>in</b> <b>vi</b>
       Motion  commands are among the most complicated aspects of <u>vi</u> to describe. With some exceptions, the text
       region and buffer type effect of a motion command on a <u>vi</u> command are described on a case-by-case  basis.
       The  descriptions  of  text  regions  in  POSIX.1‐2008  are  not intended to imply direction; that is, an
       inclusive region from line <u>n</u> to line <u>n</u>+5 is identical to a region from line <u>n</u>+5 to line <u>n</u>.   This  is  of
       more than academic interest—movements to marks can be in either direction, and, if the <b>wrapscan</b> option is
       set, so can movements to search points. Historically, lines are always stored into buffers in text order;
       that  is,  from  the start of the edit buffer to the end. POSIX.1‐2008 requires conformance to historical
       practice.

       Historically, command counts were applied to any  associated  motion,  and  were  multiplicative  to  any
       supplied  motion  count.  For example, <b>2cw</b> is the same as <b>c2w</b>, and <b>2c3w</b> is the same as <b>c6w</b>.  POSIX.1‐2008
       requires this behavior. Historically, <u>vi</u> commands that used bigwords, words, paragraphs, and sentences as
       objects treated groups of empty lines, or lines that contained only &lt;blank&gt;  characters,  inconsistently.
       Some  commands  treated  them as a single entity, while others treated each line separately. For example,
       the <b>w</b>, <b>W</b>, and <b>B</b> commands treated groups of empty lines as individual words; that is,  the  command  would
       move  the  cursor  to each new empty line. The <b>e</b> and <b>E</b> commands treated groups of empty lines as a single
       word; that is, the first use would move past the group of lines. The <b>b</b> command would  just  beep  at  the
       user,  or  if  done from the start of the line as a motion command, fail in unexpected ways. If the lines
       contained only (or ended with) &lt;blank&gt; characters, the <b>w</b> and <b>W</b> commands would just beep at the user,  the
       <b>E</b>  and  <b>e</b> commands would treat the group as a single word, and the <b>B</b> and <b>b</b> commands would treat the lines
       as individual words. For consistency and simplicity of specification, POSIX.1‐2008 requires that  all  <u>vi</u>
       commands  treat groups of empty or blank lines as a single entity, and that movement through lines ending
       with &lt;blank&gt; characters be consistent with other movements.

       Historically, <u>vi</u> documentation indicated that any number of double-quotes were skipped after  punctuation
       marks  at sentence boundaries; however, implementations only skipped single-quotes. POSIX.1‐2008 requires
       both to be skipped.

       Historically, the first and last characters in the edit buffer  were  word  boundaries.  This  historical
       practice is required by POSIX.1‐2008.

       Historically,  <u>vi</u>  attempted  to update the minimum number of columns on the screen possible, which could
       lead to misleading information being displayed.  POSIX.1‐2008 makes no requirements other than  that  the
       current  character  being  entered is displayed correctly, leaving all other decisions in this area up to
       the implementation.

       Historically, lines were arbitrarily folded between columns of  any  characters  that  required  multiple
       column  positions  on  the screen, with the exception of tabs, which terminated at the right-hand margin.
       POSIX.1‐2008 permits the former and requires the latter. Implementations that do  not  arbitrarily  break
       lines between columns of characters that occupy multiple column positions should not permit the cursor to
       rest on a column that does not contain any part of a character.

       The  historical  <u>vi</u>  had  a  problem in that all movements were by buffer lines, not by display or screen
       lines. This is often the right thing to do; for example, single line movements, such as <b>j</b>  or  <b>k</b>,  should
       work  on  buffer lines. Commands like <b>dj</b>, or <b>j.</b>, where <b>.</b>  is a change command, only make sense for buffer
       lines. It is not, however,  the  right  thing  to  do  for  screen  motion  or  scrolling  commands  like
       &lt;control&gt;‐D,  &lt;control&gt;‐F,  and  <b>H</b>.  If the window is fairly small, using buffer lines in these cases can
       result in completely random motion; for example, <b>1</b>&lt;control&gt;<b>‐D</b> can result in a completely changed  screen,
       without  any  overlap. This is clearly not what the user wanted. The problem is even worse in the case of
       the <b>H</b>, <b>L</b>, and <b>M</b> commands—as they position the cursor at the first non-&lt;blank&gt; of the line, they  may  all
       refer to the same location in large lines, and will result in no movement at all.

       In  addition, if the line is larger than the screen, using buffer lines can make it impossible to display
       parts of the line—there are not any commands that do not display the beginning of the line in  historical
       <u>vi</u>,  and  if  both  the  beginning and end of the line cannot be on the screen at the same time, the user
       suffers. Finally, the page and half-page scrolling commands historically moved to the  first  non-&lt;blank&gt;
       in the new line. If the line is approximately the same size as the screen, this is inadequate because the
       cursor before and after a &lt;control&gt;‐D command will refer to the same location on the screen.

       Implementations  of  <u>ex</u>  and  <u>vi</u>  exist  that  do  not  have these problems because the relevant commands
       (&lt;control&gt;‐B, &lt;control&gt;‐D, &lt;control&gt;‐F, &lt;control&gt;‐U, &lt;control&gt;‐Y, &lt;control&gt;‐E, <b>H</b>, <b>L</b>, and  <b>M)</b>  operate  on
       display (screen) lines, not (edit) buffer lines.

       POSIX.1‐2008 does not permit this behavior by default because the standard developers believed that users
       would  find  it  too  confusing.  However,  historical  practice has been relaxed. For example, <u>ex</u> and <u>vi</u>
       historically attempted, albeit sometimes unsuccessfully, to never put part of a line on the last lines of
       a screen; for example, if a line would not fit in its entirety, no part of the line  was  displayed,  and
       the  screen  lines corresponding to the line contained single <b>'@'</b> characters. This behavior is permitted,
       but not required by POSIX.1‐2008, so that it is possible for implementations to  support  long  lines  in
       small  screens  more  reasonably  without changing the commands to be oriented to the display (instead of
       oriented to the buffer). POSIX.1‐2008 also permits implementations to refuse  to  edit  any  edit  buffer
       containing a line that will not fit on the screen in its entirety.

       The  display  area (for example, the value of the <b>window</b> edit option) has historically been ``grown'', or
       expanded, to display new text when local movements are  done  in  displays  where  the  number  of  lines
       displayed  is  less than the maximum possible. Expansion has historically been the first choice, when the
       target line is less than the maximum possible expansion value away. Scrolling has historically  been  the
       next  choice,  done  when the target line is less than half a display away, and otherwise, the screen was
       redrawn. There were exceptions, however, in that <u>ex</u> commands generally always caused  the  screen  to  be
       redrawn.  POSIX.1‐2008 does not specify a standard behavior because there may be external issues, such as
       connection speed, the number of characters  necessary  to  redraw  as  opposed  to  scroll,  or  terminal
       capabilities that implementations will have to accommodate.

       The  current  line  in POSIX.1‐2008 maps one-to-one to a buffer line in the file. The current column does
       not. There are two different column values that are described by POSIX.1‐2008. The first is  the  current
       column  value as set by many of the <u>vi</u> commands. This value is remembered for the lifetime of the editor.
       The second column value is the actual position on the screen where the cursor  rests.  The  two  are  not
       always  the  same.  For example, when the cursor is backed by a multi-column character, the actual cursor
       position on the screen has historically been the last column of the character in command  mode,  and  the
       first column of the character in input mode.

       Commands  that  set the current line, but that do not set the current cursor value (for example, <b>j</b> and <b>k</b>)
       attempt to get as close as possible to the remembered column  position,  so  that  the  cursor  tends  to
       restrict  itself  to a vertical column as the user moves around in the edit buffer. POSIX.1‐2008 requires
       conformance to historical practice, requiring that the display location of the cursor on the display line
       be adjusted from the current column value as necessary to support this historical behavior.

       Historically, only a single line (and for some terminals, a single line minus  1  column)  of  characters
       could  be  entered  by  the  user  for  the line-oriented commands; that is, <b>:</b>, <b>!</b>, <b>/</b>, or <b>?</b>.  POSIX.1‐2008
       permits, but does not require, this limitation.

       Historically, ``soft'' errors in <u>vi</u> caused  the  terminal  to  be  alerted,  but  no  error  message  was
       displayed.  As a general rule, no error message was displayed for errors in command execution in <u>vi</u>, when
       the  error  resulted  from  the  user  attempting an invalid or impossible action, or when a searched-for
       object was not found.  Examples of soft errors included <b>h</b> at the left margin, &lt;control&gt;‐B or  <b>[[</b>  at  the
       beginning  of the file, <b>2G</b> at the end of the file, and so on. In addition, errors such as <b>%</b>, <b>]]</b>, <b>}</b>, <b>)</b>, <b>N</b>,
       <b>n</b>, <b>f</b>, <b>F</b>, <b>t</b>, and <b>T</b> failing to find the searched-for object were soft as well. Less consistently, <b>/</b>  and  <b>?</b>
       displayed  an error message if the pattern was not found, <b>/</b>, <b>?</b>, <b>N</b>, and <b>n</b> displayed an error message if no
       previous regular expression had been specified, and <b>;</b> did not display an error message if no previous  <b>f</b>,
       <b>F</b>,  <b>t</b>,  or  <b>T</b>  command  had  occurred. Also, behavior in this area might reasonably be based on a runtime
       evaluation of the speed of a network connection.   Finally,  some  implementations  have  provided  error
       messages  for  soft  errors  in order to assist naive users, based on the value of a verbose edit option.
       POSIX.1‐2008 does not list specific errors for which an error message shall be displayed. Implementations
       should conform to historical practice in the absence of any strong reason to diverge.

   <b>Page</b> <b>Backwards</b>
       The &lt;control&gt;‐B and &lt;control&gt;‐F commands historically considered it an error to attempt to page past  the
       beginning  or  end  of  the  file,  whereas  the &lt;control&gt;‐D and &lt;control&gt;‐U commands simply moved to the
       beginning or end of the file. For consistency, POSIX.1‐2008 requires the latter  behavior  for  all  four
       commands.   All  four  commands  still  consider  it  an  error  if  the current line is at the beginning
       (&lt;control&gt;‐B, &lt;control&gt;‐U) or end (&lt;control&gt;‐F, &lt;control&gt;‐D) of the file. Historically,  the  &lt;control&gt;‐B
       and  &lt;control&gt;‐F  commands  skip two lines in order to include overlapping lines when a single command is
       entered. This makes less sense in the  presence  of  a  <u>count</u>,  as  there  will  be,  by  definition,  no
       overlapping  lines.  The  actual  calculation  used  by  historical  implementations of the <u>vi</u> editor for
       &lt;control&gt;‐B was:

           ((current first line) - count x (window edit option)) +2

       and for &lt;control&gt;‐F was:

           ((current first line) + count x (window edit option)) -2

       This calculation does not work well when intermixing commands  with  and  without  counts;  for  example,
       <b>3</b>&lt;control&gt;‐F  is not equivalent to entering the &lt;control&gt;‐F command three times, and is not reversible by
       entering the &lt;control&gt;‐B command three times. For consistency with other <u>vi</u> commands  that  take  counts,
       POSIX.1‐2008 requires a different calculation.

   <b>Scroll</b> <b>Forward</b>
       The  4BSD  and  System  V implementations of <u>vi</u> differed on the initial value used by the <b>scroll</b> command.
       4BSD used:

           ((window edit option) +1) /2

       while System V used the value  of  the  <b>scroll</b>  edit  option.  The  System  V  version  is  specified  by
       POSIX.1‐2008 because the standard developers believed that it was more intuitive and permitted the user a
       method of setting the scroll value initially without also setting the number of lines that are displayed.

   <b>Scroll</b> <b>Forward</b> <b>by</b> <b>Line</b>
       Historically,  the  &lt;control&gt;‐E  and  &lt;control&gt;‐Y  commands  considered it an error if the last and first
       lines, respectively, were  already  on  the  screen.  POSIX.1‐2008  requires  conformance  to  historical
       practice.  Historically,  the  &lt;control&gt;‐E  and  &lt;control&gt;‐Y  commands  had  no  effect in open mode. For
       simplicity and consistency of specification, POSIX.1‐2008 requires that they behave as usual, albeit with
       a single line screen.

   <b>Clear</b> <b>and</b> <b>Redisplay</b>
       The historical &lt;control&gt;‐L command refreshed the screen exactly  as  it  was  supposed  to  be  currently
       displayed,  replacing  any  <b>'@'</b>  characters for lines that had been deleted but not updated on the screen
       with refreshed <b>'@'</b> characters. The intent of the &lt;control&gt;‐L command is to refresh when  the  screen  has
       been accidentally overwritten; for example, by a <b>write</b> command from another user, or modem noise.

   <b>Redraw</b> <b>Screen</b>
       The  historical &lt;control&gt;‐R command redisplayed only when necessary to update lines that had been deleted
       but not updated on the screen and that were flagged with <b>'@'</b> characters. There is no requirement that the
       screen be in any way refreshed if no lines of this form are  currently  displayed.  POSIX.1‐2008  permits
       implementations to extend this command to refresh lines on the screen flagged with <b>'@'</b> characters because
       they are too long to be displayed in the current framework; however, the current line and column need not
       be modified.

   <b>Search</b> <b>for</b> <b>tagstring</b>
       Historically,  the  first  non-&lt;blank&gt; at or after the cursor was the first character, and all subsequent
       characters that were word characters, up to the end of the line, were included.  For  example,  with  the
       cursor  on  the  leading &lt;space&gt; or on the <b>'#'</b> character in the text <b>"#bar@"</b>, the tag was <b>"#bar"</b>.  On the
       character <b>'b'</b> it was <b>"bar"</b>, and on the <b>'a'</b> it was <b>"ar"</b>.  POSIX.1‐2008 requires this behavior.

   <b>Replace</b> <b>Text</b> <b>with</b> <b>Results</b> <b>from</b> <b>Shell</b> <b>Command</b>
       Historically, the <b>&lt;</b>, <b>&gt;</b>, and <b>!</b>  commands considered most cursor motions other than  line-oriented  motions
       an error; for example, the command <b>&gt;/foo&lt;CR&gt;</b> succeeded, while the command <b>&gt;l</b> failed, even though the text
       region  described  by  the  two  commands  might  be  identical. For consistency, all three commands only
       consider entire lines and not partial lines, and the region is  defined  as  any  line  that  contains  a
       character that was specified by the motion.

   <b>Move</b> <b>to</b> <b>Matching</b> <b>Character</b>
       Other  matching  characters  have  been  left implementation-defined in order to allow extensions such as
       matching <b>'&lt;'</b> and <b>'&gt;'</b> for searching HTML, or <b>#ifdef</b>, <b>#else</b>, and <b>#endif</b> for searching C source.

   <b>Repeat</b> <b>Substitution</b>
       POSIX.1‐2008 requires that any <b>c</b> and <b>g</b> flags specified to the previous  substitute  command  be  ignored;
       however, the <b>r</b> flag may still apply, if supported by the implementation.

   <b>Return</b> <b>to</b> <b>Previous</b> <b>(Context</b> <b>or</b> <b>Section)</b>
       The  <b>[[</b>,  <b>]]</b>,  <b>(</b>, <b>)</b>, <b>{</b>, and <b>}</b> commands are all affected by ``section boundaries'', but in some historical
       implementations not all of the commands recognize the same section boundaries.  This  is  a  bug,  not  a
       feature,  and  a  unique  section-boundary algorithm was not described for each command. One special case
       that is preserved is that the sentence command moves to the end of the last line of the edit buffer while
       the other commands go to the beginning, in order to preserve the traditional character cut  semantics  of
       the  sentence  command.  Historically,  <u>vi</u> section boundaries at the beginning and end of the edit buffer
       were the first non-&lt;blank&gt; on the first and last lines of the edit buffer if one exists;  otherwise,  the
       last character of the first and last lines of the edit buffer if one exists. To increase consistency with
       other section locations, this has been simplified by POSIX.1‐2008 to the first character of the first and
       last lines of the edit buffer, or the first and the last lines of the edit buffer if they are empty.

       Sentence  boundaries were problematic in the historical <u>vi</u>.  They were not only the boundaries as defined
       for the section and paragraph commands, but they were the first non-&lt;blank&gt;  that  occurred  after  those
       boundaries,  as  well. Historically, the <u>vi</u> section commands were documented as taking an optional window
       size as a <u>count</u> preceding the command. This was not implemented in historical versions,  so  POSIX.1‐2008
       requires that the <u>count</u> repeat the command, for consistency with other <u>vi</u> commands.

   <b>Repeat</b>
       Historically,  mapped  commands  other  than  text  input commands could not be repeated using the <b>period</b>
       command. POSIX.1‐2008 requires conformance to historical practice.

       The restrictions on the interpretation of special characters (for example, &lt;control&gt;‐H) in the repetition
       of text input mode commands is intended to match  historical  practice.  For  example,  given  the  input
       sequence:

           iab&lt;control&gt;-H&lt;control&gt;-H&lt;control&gt;-Hdef&lt;escape&gt;

       the  user  should  be  informed  of an error when the sequence is first entered, but not during a command
       repetition. The  character  &lt;control&gt;‐T  is  specifically  exempted  from  this  restriction.  Historical
       implementations  of  <u>vi</u>  ignored  &lt;control&gt;‐T  characters  that were input in the original command during
       command repetition. POSIX.1‐2008 prohibits this behavior.

   <b>Find</b> <b>Regular</b> <b>Expression</b>
       Historically, commands did not affect the line searched to or from if the motion command was a search (<b>/</b>,
       <b>?</b>, <b>N</b>, <b>n</b>) and the final position was the start/end of the line. There were some special cases and  <u>vi</u>  was
       not  consistent.  POSIX.1‐2008 does not permit this behavior, for consistency. Historical implementations
       permitted but were unable to handle searches as motion commands that wrapped (that is, due  to  the  edit
       option  <b>wrapscan</b>)  to  the  original  location. POSIX.1‐2008 requires that this behavior be treated as an
       error.

       Historically, the syntax <b>"/RE/0"</b> was used to force the command to cut text  in  line  mode.  POSIX.1‐2008
       requires conformance to historical practice.

       Historically,  in  open  mode,  a <b>z</b> specified to a search command redisplayed the current line instead of
       displaying the current screen with the current  line  highlighted.  For  consistency  and  simplicity  of
       specification, POSIX.1‐2008 does not permit this behavior.

       Historically,  trailing  <b>z</b>  commands  were permitted and ignored if entered as part of a search used as a
       motion command. For consistency and simplicity  of  specification,  POSIX.1‐2008  does  not  permit  this
       behavior.

   <b>Execute</b> <b>an</b> <b>ex</b> <b>Command</b>
       Historically,  <u>vi</u> implementations restricted the commands that could be entered on the colon command line
       (for  example,  <b>append</b>  and  <b>change</b>),  and  some  other  commands  were  known  to  cause  them  to  fail
       catastrophically.  For consistency, POSIX.1‐2008 does not permit these restrictions. When executing an <u>ex</u>
       command by entering <b>:</b>, it is not possible to enter a &lt;newline&gt; as part  of  the  command  because  it  is
       considered  the  end  of the command.  A different approach is to enter <u>ex</u> command mode by using the <u>vi</u> <b>Q</b>
       command (and later resuming visual mode with the <u>ex</u> <b>vi</b> command). In  <u>ex</u>  command  mode,  the  single-line
       limitation does not exist. So, for example, the following is valid:

           Q
           s/break here/break\
           here/
           vi

       POSIX.1‐2008 requires that, if the <u>ex</u> command overwrites any part of the screen that would be erased by a
       refresh,  <u>vi</u>  pauses  for a character from the user. Historically, this character could be any character;
       for example, a character input by the user before the message appeared, or even a mapped character.  This
       is  probably  a  bug,  but implementations that have tried to be more rigorous by requiring that the user
       enter a specific character, or that the user enter a character after the message was displayed, have been
       forced by user indignation back into historical behavior. POSIX.1‐2008 requires conformance to historical
       practice.

   <b>Shift</b> <b>Left</b> <b>(Right)</b>
       Refer to the Rationale for the <b>!</b>  and <b>/</b> commands. Historically, the <b>&lt;</b> and <b>&gt;</b> commands sometimes moved  the
       cursor  to  the  first  non-&lt;blank&gt;  (for  example  if  the  command was repeated or with <b>_</b> as the motion
       command), and sometimes left it unchanged. POSIX.1‐2008 does not  permit  this  inconsistency,  requiring
       instead that the cursor always move to the first non-&lt;blank&gt;.  Historically, the <b>&lt;</b> and <b>&gt;</b> commands did not
       support  buffer  arguments,  although some implementations allow the specification of an optional buffer.
       This behavior is neither required nor disallowed by POSIX.1‐2008.

   <b>Execute</b>
       Historically, buffers could execute other buffers, and loops,  infinite  and  otherwise,  were  possible.
       POSIX.1‐2008 requires conformance to historical practice. The *<u>buffer</u> syntax of <u>ex</u> is not required in <u>vi</u>,
       because  it is not historical practice and has been used in some <u>vi</u> implementations to support additional
       scripting languages.

   <b>Reverse</b> <b>Case</b>
       Historically, the <b>~</b> command ignored any associated <u>count</u>, and acted only on the characters in the current
       line. For consistency with other <u>vi</u> commands, POSIX.1‐2008 requires that an associated <u>count</u> act  on  the
       next  <u>count</u>  characters,  and that the command move to subsequent lines if warranted by <u>count</u>, to make it
       possible to modify large pieces of text in a reasonably efficient manner. There exist <u>vi</u>  implementations
       that  optionally  require an associated motion command for the <b>~</b> command. Implementations supporting this
       functionality are encouraged to base it on the <b>tildedop</b> edit option  and  handle  the  text  regions  and
       cursor positioning identically to the <b>yank</b> command.

   <b>Append</b>
       Historically,  <u>count</u>s specified to the <b>A</b>, <b>a</b>, <b>I</b>, and <b>i</b> commands repeated the input of the first line <u>count</u>
       times, and did not repeat the subsequent lines of the input text. POSIX.1‐2008 requires that  the  entire
       text input be repeated <u>count</u> times.

   <b>Move</b> <b>Backward</b> <b>to</b> <b>Preceding</b> <b>Word</b>
       Historically,  <u>vi</u>  became  confused  if  word  commands  were  used  as  motion  commands in empty files.
       POSIX.1‐2008 requires that this be an error. Historical implementations of <u>vi</u> had a large number of  bugs
       in  the  word  movement  commands,  and  they  varied greatly in behavior in the presence of empty lines,
       ``words'' made up of a single character, and lines containing only &lt;blank&gt;  characters.  For  consistency
       and simplicity of specification, POSIX.1‐2008 does not permit this behavior.

   <b>Change</b> <b>to</b> <b>End-of-Line</b>
       Some  historical  implementations of the <b>C</b> command did not behave as described by POSIX.1‐2008 when the <b>$</b>
       key was remapped because they were implemented by pushing the <b>$</b> key onto the input queue and reprocessing
       it. POSIX.1‐2008 does not permit this behavior. Historically, the <b>C</b>, <b>S</b>,  and  <b>s</b>  commands  did  not  copy
       replaced  text  into  the  numeric buffers. For consistency and simplicity of specification, POSIX.1‐2008
       requires that they behave like their respective <b>c</b> commands in all respects.

   <b>Delete</b>
       Historically, lines in open mode that were deleted were scrolled up, and an  <b>@</b>  glyph  written  over  the
       beginning  of  the line. In the case of terminals that are incapable of the necessary cursor motions, the
       editor erased the deleted line from the screen. POSIX.1‐2008 requires conformance to historical practice;
       that is, if the terminal cannot display the <b>'@'</b> character, the line cannot remain on the screen.

   <b>Delete</b> <b>to</b> <b>End-of-Line</b>
       Some historical implementations of the <b>D</b> command did not behave as described by POSIX.1‐2008 when  the  <b>$</b>
       key was remapped because they were implemented by pushing the <b>$</b> key onto the input queue and reprocessing
       it. POSIX.1‐2008 does not permit this behavior.

   <b>Join</b>
       An  historical  oddity of <u>vi</u> is that the commands <b>J</b>, <b>1J</b>, and <b>2J</b> are all equivalent. POSIX.1‐2008 requires
       conformance to historical practice.  The <u>vi</u> <b>J</b> command is specified in terms of the <u>ex</u> <b>join</b>  command  with
       an  <u>ex</u> command <u>count</u> value. The address correction for a <u>count</u> that is past the end of the edit buffer is
       necessary for historical compatibility for both <u>ex</u> and <u>vi</u>.

   <b>Mark</b> <b>Position</b>
       Historical practice is that only lowercase letters, plus backquote and single-quote,  could  be  used  to
       mark  a  cursor  position.  POSIX.1‐2008  requires  conformance  to  historical  practice, but encourages
       implementations to support other characters as marks as well.

   <b>Repeat</b> <b>Regular</b> <b>Expression</b> <b>Find</b> <b>(Forward</b> <b>and</b> <b>Reverse)</b>
       Historically, the <b>N</b> and <b>n</b> commands could not be used as motion components for the  <b>c</b>  command.  With  the
       exception of the <b>cN</b> command, which worked if the search crossed a line boundary, the text region would be
       discarded, and the user would not be in text input mode. For consistency and simplicity of specification,
       POSIX.1‐2008 does not permit this behavior.

   <b>Insert</b> <b>Empty</b> <b>Line</b> <b>(Below</b> <b>and</b> <b>Above)</b>
       Historically,  counts  to  the <b>O</b> and <b>o</b> commands were used as the number of physical lines to open, if the
       terminal was dumb and the <b>slowopen</b> option was not set. This was intended to minimize  traffic  over  slow
       connections and repainting for dumb terminals. POSIX.1‐2008 does not permit this behavior, requiring that
       a  <u>count</u>  to the open command behave as for other text input commands. This change to historical practice
       was made for consistency, and because a superset of the functionality is provided by  the  <b>slowopen</b>  edit
       option.

   <b>Put</b> <b>from</b> <b>Buffer</b> <b>(Following</b> <b>and</b> <b>Before)</b>
       Historically,  <u>count</u>s to the <b>p</b> and <b>P</b> commands were ignored if the buffer was a line mode buffer, but were
       (mostly) implemented as described in POSIX.1‐2008 if the buffer was  a  character  mode  buffer.  Because
       implementations  exist  that  do  not  have  this limitation, and because pasting lines multiple times is
       generally useful, POSIX.1‐2008 requires that <u>count</u> be supported for all <b>p</b> and <b>P</b> commands.

       Historical implementations of <u>vi</u> were widely known to have major  problems  in  the  <b>p</b>  and  <b>P</b>  commands,
       particularly  when  unusual  regions  of  text  were copied into the edit buffer. The standard developers
       viewed these as bugs, and they are not permitted for consistency and simplicity of specification.

       Historically, a <b>P</b> or <b>p</b> command (or an <u>ex</u> <b>put</b> command executed from open or visual mode)  executed  in  an
       empty  file,  left  an  empty  line  as  the  first  line  of the file. For consistency and simplicity of
       specification, POSIX.1‐2008 does not permit this behavior.

   <b>Replace</b> <b>Character</b>
       Historically, the <b>r</b> command did not correctly handle the <u>erase</u> and <u>word</u> <u>erase</u>  characters  as  arguments,
       nor  did  it  handle  an  associated <u>count</u> greater than 1 with a &lt;carriage-return&gt; argument, for which it
       replaced <u>count</u> characters with a single &lt;newline&gt;.  POSIX.1‐2008 does not permit these inconsistencies.

       Historically, the <b>r</b> command permitted the &lt;control&gt;‐V escaping of entered characters, such as  &lt;ESC&gt;  and
       the  &lt;carriage-return&gt;;  however,  it  required  two  leading  &lt;control&gt;‐V  characters  instead  of  one.
       POSIX.1‐2008 requires that this be changed for consistency with the other text input commands of <u>vi</u>.

       Historically, it is an error to enter the <b>r</b> command if there are less than <u>count</u> characters at  or  after
       the  cursor in the line. While a reasonable and unambiguous extension would be to permit the <b>r</b> command on
       empty lines, it would require that too large a <u>count</u> be adjusted to match the number of characters at  or
       after the cursor for consistency, which is sufficiently different from historical practice to be avoided.
       POSIX.1‐2008 requires conformance to historical practice.

   <b>Replace</b> <b>Characters</b>
       Historically,  if  there  were  <b>autoindent</b>  characters  in  the  line on which the <b>R</b> command was run, and
       <b>autoindent</b> was set, the first &lt;newline&gt; would be properly indented and no characters would be replaced by
       the &lt;newline&gt;.  Each additional &lt;newline&gt;  would  replace  <u>n</u>  characters,  where  <u>n</u>  was  the  number  of
       characters that were needed to indent the rest of the line to the proper indentation level. This behavior
       is a bug and is not permitted by POSIX.1‐2008.

   <b>Undo</b>
       Historical  practice for cursor positioning after undoing commands was mixed. In most cases, when undoing
       commands that affected a single line, the cursor was moved to the start of  added  or  changed  text,  or
       immediately  after  deleted  text. However, if the user had moved from the line being changed, the column
       was either set to the first non-&lt;blank&gt;, returned to the origin of the command,  or  remained  unchanged.
       When  undoing  commands  that  affected multiple lines or entire lines, the cursor was moved to the first
       character in the first line restored. As an example of how inconsistent this was, a search,  followed  by
       an  <b>o</b> text input command, followed by an <b>undo</b> would return the cursor to the location where the <b>o</b> command
       was entered, but a <b>cw</b> command followed by an <b>o</b> command followed by an <b>undo</b> would return the cursor to the
       first non-&lt;blank&gt; of the line. POSIX.1‐2008 requires the most useful of these behaviors, and discards the
       least useful, in the interest of consistency and simplicity of specification.

   <b>Yank</b>
       Historically, the <b>yank</b> command did not move to the end of the motion if the motion  was  in  the  forward
       direction.  It moved to the end of the motion if the motion was in the backward direction, except for the
       <b>_</b> command, or for the <b>G</b> and <b>'</b> commands when the end of the motion was  on  the  current  line.  This  was
       further  complicated  by the fact that for a number of motion commands, the <b>yank</b> command moved the cursor
       but did not update the screen; for example, a subsequent command would move the cursor from  the  end  of
       the  motion,  even  though  the  cursor  on the screen had not reflected the cursor movement for the <b>yank</b>
       command. POSIX.1‐2008 requires that all <b>yank</b> commands associated with backward motions move the cursor to
       the end of the motion for consistency, and specifically, to make <b>'</b> commands as  motions  consistent  with
       search patterns as motions.

   <b>Yank</b> <b>Current</b> <b>Line</b>
       Some historical implementations of the <b>Y</b> command did not behave as described by POSIX.1‐2008 when the <b>'_'</b>
       key  was  remapped  because  they  were  implemented  by  pushing  the  <b>'_'</b>  key onto the input queue and
       reprocessing it. POSIX.1‐2008 does not permit this behavior.

   <b>Redraw</b> <b>Window</b>
       Historically, the <b>z</b> command always redrew the screen. This is permitted but not required by POSIX.1‐2008,
       because of the frequent use of the <b>z</b> command in macros such as <b>map</b> <b>n</b> <b>nz.</b>  for screen positioning, instead
       of its use to change the screen size.  The standard developers believed that expanding or  scrolling  the
       screen  offered  a  better  interface  for  users.  The  ability to redraw the screen is preserved if the
       optional new window size is specified, and in the &lt;control&gt;‐L and &lt;control&gt;‐R commands.

       The semantics of <b>z^</b> are confusing at best. Historical practice is that the screen before the screen  that
       ended with the specified line is displayed. POSIX.1‐2008 requires conformance to historical practice.

       Historically,  the  <b>z</b> command would not display a partial line at the top or bottom of the screen. If the
       partial line would normally have been displayed at the bottom of the screen, the command worked, but  the
       partial  line was replaced with <b>'@'</b> characters. If the partial line would normally have been displayed at
       the top of the screen,  the  command  would  fail.  For  consistency  and  simplicity  of  specification,
       POSIX.1‐2008 does not permit this behavior.

       Historically,  the  <b>z</b>  command  with  a  line specification of 1 ignored the command. For consistency and
       simplicity of specification, POSIX.1‐2008 does not permit this behavior.

       Historically, the <b>z</b> command did not set the cursor column to the first non-&lt;blank&gt; for the  character  if
       the  first  screen  was  to  be  displayed,  and was already displayed. For consistency and simplicity of
       specification, POSIX.1‐2008 does not permit this behavior.

   <b>Input</b> <b>Mode</b> <b>Commands</b> <b>in</b> <b>vi</b>
       Historical implementations of <u>vi</u> did not permit the user to erase more than a single line of input, or to
       use normal erase characters such as <u>line</u> <u>erase</u>, <u>worderase</u>, and <u>erase</u> to erase <b>autoindent</b>  characters.  As
       there  exist  implementations of <u>vi</u> that do not have these limitations, both behaviors are permitted, but
       only historical practice is required. In the case of these extensions, <u>vi</u> is required  to  pause  at  the
       <b>autoindent</b> and previous line boundaries.

       Historical  implementations  of  <u>vi</u>  updated  only  the  portion  of  the screen where the current cursor
       character was displayed. For example, consider the <u>vi</u> input keystrokes:

           iabcd&lt;escape&gt;0C&lt;tab&gt;

       Historically,  the  &lt;tab&gt;  would  overwrite  the  characters  <b>"abcd"</b>  when  it   was   displayed.   Other
       implementations  replace  only the <b>'a'</b> character with the &lt;tab&gt;, and then push the rest of the characters
       ahead of the cursor. Both implementations  have  problems.  The  historical  implementation  is  probably
       visually nicer for the above example; however, for the keystrokes:

           iabcd&lt;ESC&gt;0R&lt;tab&gt;&lt;ESC&gt;

       the  historical  implementation  results  in the string <b>"bcd"</b> disappearing and then magically reappearing
       when the &lt;ESC&gt; character is entered. POSIX.1‐2008 requires the former behavior  when  overwriting  erase-
       columns—that  is,  overwriting  characters  that  are no longer logically part of the edit buffer—and the
       latter behavior otherwise.

       Historical implementations of <u>vi</u> discarded the &lt;control&gt;‐D and  &lt;control&gt;‐T  characters  when  they  were
       entered  at  places where their command functionality was not appropriate. POSIX.1‐2008 requires that the
       &lt;control&gt;‐T functionality always be available, and that &lt;control&gt;‐D be treated as any other key when  not
       operating on <b>autoindent</b> characters.

   <b>NUL</b>
       Some  historical  implementations  of  <u>vi</u>  limited  the  number of characters entered using the NUL input
       character to 256 bytes. POSIX.1‐2008 permits this limitation; however, implementations are encouraged  to
       remove this limit.

   <b>&lt;control&gt;‐D</b>
       See  also  Rationale  for  the  input  mode command &lt;newline&gt;.  The hidden assumptions in the &lt;control&gt;‐D
       command (and in the <u>vi</u> <b>autoindent</b> specification in general) is that &lt;space&gt; characters take up  a  single
       column on the screen and that &lt;tab&gt; characters are comprised of an integral number of &lt;space&gt; characters.

   <b>&lt;newline&gt;</b>
       Implementations  are  permitted  to  rewrite <b>autoindent</b> characters in the line when &lt;newline&gt;, &lt;carriage-
       return&gt;, &lt;control&gt;‐D, and &lt;control&gt;‐T  are  entered,  or  when  the  <b>shift</b>  commands  are  used,  because
       historical  implementations have both done so and found it necessary to do so. For example, a &lt;control&gt;‐D
       when the cursor is preceded by a single &lt;tab&gt;, with <b>tabstop</b> set to 8,  and  <b>shiftwidth</b>  set  to  3,  will
       result in the &lt;tab&gt; being replaced by several &lt;space&gt; characters.

   <b>&lt;control&gt;‐T</b>
       See also the Rationale for the input mode command &lt;newline&gt;.  Historically, &lt;control&gt;‐T only worked if no
       non-&lt;blank&gt; characters had yet been input in the current input line. In addition, the characters inserted
       by  &lt;control&gt;‐T  were  treated  as <b>autoindent</b> characters, and could not be erased using normal user erase
       characters.  Because implementations exist that do not have these limitations, and as moving to a  column
       boundary is generally useful, POSIX.1‐2008 requires that both limitations be removed.

   <b>&lt;control&gt;‐V</b>
       Historically,  <u>vi</u>  used  <b>^V</b>,  regardless  of  the  value  of  the literal-next character of the terminal.
       POSIX.1‐2008 requires conformance to historical practice.

       The uses described for &lt;control&gt;‐V can  also  be  accomplished  with  &lt;control&gt;‐Q,  which  is  useful  on
       terminals  that use &lt;control&gt;‐V for the down-arrow function. However, most historical implementations use
       &lt;control&gt;‐Q for the <u>termios</u> START character, so the editor will generally  not  receive  the  &lt;control&gt;‐Q
       unless  <b>stty</b>  <b>ixon</b> mode is set to off. (In addition, some historical implementations of <u>vi</u> explicitly set
       <b>ixon</b> mode to on, so it was difficult for the user to set it  to  off.)  Any  of  the  command  characters
       described in POSIX.1‐2008 can be made ineffective by their selection as <u>termios</u> control characters, using
       the <u>stty</u> utility or other methods described in the System Interfaces volume of POSIX.1‐2017.

   <b>&lt;ESC&gt;</b>
       Historically,  SIGINT  alerted  the terminal when used to end input mode. This behavior is permitted, but
       not required, by POSIX.1‐2008.
