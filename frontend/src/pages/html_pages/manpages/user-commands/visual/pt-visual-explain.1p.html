</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       pt-visual-explain - Format EXPLAIN output as a tree.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       Usage: pt-visual-explain [OPTIONS] [FILES]

       pt-visual-explain transforms EXPLAIN output into a tree representation of the query plan.  If FILE is
       given, input is read from the file(s).  With no FILE, or when FILE is -, read standard input.

       Examples:

         pt-visual-explain &lt;file_containing_explain_output&gt;

         pt-visual-explain -c &lt;file_containing_query&gt;

         mysql -e "explain select * from mysql.user" | pt-visual-explain

</pre><h4><b>RISKS</b></h4><pre>
       Percona Toolkit is mature, proven in the real world, and well tested, but all database tools can pose a
       risk to the system and the database server.  Before using this tool, please:

       •   Read the tool's documentation

       •   Review the tool's known "BUGS"

       •   Test the tool on a non-production server

       •   Backup your production server and verify the backups

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       pt-visual-explain  reverse-engineers  MySQL's  EXPLAIN  output into a query execution plan, which it then
       formats as a left-deep tree -- the same way the plan is represented inside MySQL.  It is possible  to  do
       this  by hand, or to read EXPLAIN's output directly, but it requires patience and expertise.  Many people
       find a tree representation more understandable.

       You can pipe input into pt-visual-explain or specify a  filename  at  the  command  line,  including  the
       magical '-' filename, which will read from standard input.  It can do two things with the input: parse it
       for  something  that  looks  like  EXPLAIN  output, or connect to a MySQL instance and run EXPLAIN on the
       input.

       When parsing its input, pt-visual-explain understands three formats: tabular like that shown in the mysql
       command-line client, vertical like that created by using the \G line terminator in the mysql command-line
       client, and tab separated.  It ignores any lines it doesn't know how to parse.

       When executing the input, pt-visual-explain replaces everything in the  input  up  to  the  first  SELECT
       keyword with 'EXPLAIN SELECT,' and then executes the result.  You must specify "--connect" to execute the
       input as a query.

       Either  way,  it  builds  a tree from the result set and prints it to standard output.  For the following
       query,

        select * from sakila.film_actor join sakila.film using(film_id);

       pt-visual-explain generates this query plan:

        JOIN
        +- Bookmark lookup
        |  +- Table
        |  |  table          film_actor
        |  |  possible_keys  idx_fk_film_id
        |  +- Index lookup
        |     key            film_actor-&gt;idx_fk_film_id
        |     possible_keys  idx_fk_film_id
        |     key_len        2
        |     ref            sakila.film.film_id
        |     rows           2
        +- Table scan
           rows           952
           +- Table
              table          film
              possible_keys  PRIMARY

       The query plan is left-deep, depth-first search, and the tree's root is the output node -- the last  step
       in the execution plan.  In other words, read it like this:

       1.  Table scan the 'film' table, which accesses an estimated 952 rows.

       2.  For  each  row, find matching rows by doing an index lookup into the film_actor-&gt;idx_fk_film_id index
           with the value from sakila.film.film_id, then a bookmark lookup into the film_actor table.

</pre><h4><b>MODULES</b></h4><pre>
       This program is actually a runnable module, not just an ordinary Perl script.  In  fact,  there  are  two
       modules  embedded  in  it.   This  makes  unit testing easy, but it also makes it easy for you to use the
       parsing and tree-building functionality if you want.

       The ExplainParser package accepts a string and parses whatever it thinks looks like EXPLAIN  output  from
       it.  The synopsis is as follows:

        require "pt-visual-explain";
        my $p    = ExplainParser-&gt;new();
        my $rows = $p-&gt;parse("some text");
        # $rows is an arrayref of hashrefs.

       The  ExplainTree  package  accepts a set of rows and turns it into a tree.  For convenience, you can also
       have it delegate to ExplainParser and parse text for you.  Here's the synopsis:

        require "pt-visual-explain";
        my $e      = ExplainTree-&gt;new();
        my $tree   = $e-&gt;parse("some text", \%options);
        my $output = $e-&gt;pretty_print($tree);
        print $tree;

</pre><h4><b>ALGORITHM</b></h4><pre>
       This section explains the algorithm that converts EXPLAIN into a tree.  You may be interested in  reading
       this  if you want to understand EXPLAIN more fully, or trying to figure out how this works, but otherwise
       this section will probably not make your life richer.

       The tree can be built by examining the id, select_type, and table columns of each  row.   Here's  what  I
       know about them:

       The id column is the sequential number of the select.  This does not indicate nesting; it just comes from
       counting  SELECT  from  the  left  of  the  SQL  statement.  It's like capturing parentheses in a regular
       expression.  A UNION RESULT row doesn't have an id, because it isn't a SELECT.  The source code  actually
       refers to UNIONs as a fake_lex, as I recall.

       If  two  adjacent  rows have the same id value, they are joined with the standard single-sweep multi-join
       method.

       The select_type column tells a) that a new sub-scope has opened b) what kind of relationship the row  has
       to the previous row c) what kind of operation the row represents.

       •   SIMPLE means there are no subqueries or unions in the whole query.

       •   PRIMARY means there are, but this is the outermost SELECT.

       •   [DEPENDENT]  UNION  means  this  result  is UNIONed with the previous result (not row; a result might
           encompass more than one row).

       •   UNION RESULT terminates a set of UNIONed results.

       •   [DEPENDENT|UNCACHEABLE] SUBQUERY means a new sub-scope is opening.  This is the kind of subquery that
           happens in a WHERE clause, SELECT list or whatnot; it does not return a so-called "derived table."

       •   DERIVED is a subquery in the FROM clause.

       Tables that are JOINed all have the same select_type.  For example, if you JOIN  three  tables  inside  a
       dependent subquery, they'll all say the same thing: DEPENDENT SUBQUERY.

       The  table  column  usually  specifies  the  table  name  or  alias,  but  may  also  say  &lt;derivedN&gt;  or
       &lt;unionN,N...N&gt;.  If it says &lt;derivedN&gt;, the row represents an access to the temporary  table  that  holds
       the  result of the subquery whose id is N.  If it says &lt;unionN,..N&gt; it's the same thing, but it refers to
       the results it UNIONs together.

       Finally, order matters.  If a row's id is less than the one before it, I think that means it is dependent
       on something other than the one before it.  For example,

        explain select
           (select 1 from sakila.film),
           (select 2 from sakila.film_actor),
           (select 3 from sakila.actor);

        | id | select_type | table      |
        +----+-------------+------------+
        |  1 | PRIMARY     | NULL       |
        |  4 | SUBQUERY    | actor      |
        |  3 | SUBQUERY    | film_actor |
        |  2 | SUBQUERY    | film       |

       If the results were in order 2-3-4, I think that would mean 3 is a subquery of 2, 4 is a subquery  of  3.
       As  it  is,  this means 4 is a subquery of the nearest previous recent row with a smaller id, which is 1.
       Likewise for 3 and 2.

       This structure is hard to programmatically build into a tree for the same reason it's hard to  understand
       by  inspection:  there  are  both  forward and backward references.  &lt;derivedN&gt; is a forward reference to
       selectN, while &lt;unionM,N&gt; is a backward reference to selectM and selectN.  That makes recursion and other
       tree-building algorithms hard to get right (NOTE: after  implementation,  I  now  see  how  it  would  be
       possible  to deal with both forward and backward references, but I have no motivation to change something
       that works).  Consider the following:

        select * from (
           select 1 from sakila.actor as actor_1
           union
           select 1 from sakila.actor as actor_2
        ) as der_1
        union
        select * from (
           select 1 from sakila.actor as actor_3
           union all
           select 1 from sakila.actor as actor_4
        ) as der_2;

        | id   | select_type  | table      |
        +------+--------------+------------+
        |  1   | PRIMARY      | &lt;derived2&gt; |
        |  2   | DERIVED      | actor_1    |
        |  3   | UNION        | actor_2    |
        | NULL | UNION RESULT | &lt;union2,3&gt; |
        |  4   | UNION        | &lt;derived5&gt; |
        |  5   | DERIVED      | actor_3    |
        |  6   | UNION        | actor_4    |
        | NULL | UNION RESULT | &lt;union5,6&gt; |
        | NULL | UNION RESULT | &lt;union1,4&gt; |

       This would be a lot easier to work with if it looked like this (I've bracketed the id on rows I moved):

        | id   | select_type  | table      |
        +------+--------------+------------+
        | [1]  | UNION RESULT | &lt;union1,4&gt; |
        |  1   | PRIMARY      | &lt;derived2&gt; |
        | [2]  | UNION RESULT | &lt;union2,3&gt; |
        |  2   | DERIVED      | actor_1    |
        |  3   | UNION        | actor_2    |
        |  4   | UNION        | &lt;derived5&gt; |
        | [5]  | UNION RESULT | &lt;union5,6&gt; |
        |  5   | DERIVED      | actor_3    |
        |  6   | UNION        | actor_4    |

       In fact, why not re-number all the ids, so the PRIMARY row becomes 2, and so on?  That would make it even
       easier to read.  Unfortunately that would also have the effect  of  destroying  the  meaning  of  the  id
       column,  which  I  think  is important to preserve in the final tree.  Also, though it makes it easier to
       read, it doesn't make it easier to manipulate programmatically; so it's fine to leave  them  numbered  as
       they are.

       The  goal  of re-ordering is to make it easier to figure out which rows are children of which rows in the
       execution plan.  Given the reordered list and some row whose table is &lt;union...&gt; or &lt;derived&gt;, it is easy
       to find the beginning of the slice of rows that should be child nodes in the tree: you just look for  the
       first row whose ID is the same as the first number in the table.

       The  next  question is how to find the last row that should be a child node of a UNION or DERIVED.   I'll
       start with DERIVED, because the solution makes UNION easy.

       Consider how MySQL numbers the SELECTs sequentially according to their  position  in  the  SQL,  left-to-
       right.   Since a DERIVED table encloses everything within it in a scope, which becomes a temporary table,
       there are only two things to think about: its child subqueries and unions (if any), and its next siblings
       in the scope that encloses it.  Its children will all have an id greater than it does, by definition,  so
       any later rows with a smaller id terminate the scope.

       Here's  an  example.   The  middle derived table here has a subquery and a UNION to make it a little more
       complex for the example.

        explain select 1
        from (
           select film_id from sakila.film limit 1
        ) as der_1
        join (
           select film_id, actor_id, (select count(*) from sakila.rental) as r
           from sakila.film_actor limit 1
           union all
           select 1, 1, 1 from sakila.film_actor as dummy
        ) as der_2 using (film_id)
        join (
           select actor_id from sakila.actor limit 1
        ) as der_3 using (actor_id);

       Here's the output of EXPLAIN:

        | id   | select_type  | table      |
        |  1   | PRIMARY      | &lt;derived2&gt; |
        |  1   | PRIMARY      | &lt;derived6&gt; |
        |  1   | PRIMARY      | &lt;derived3&gt; |
        |  6   | DERIVED      | actor      |
        |  3   | DERIVED      | film_actor |
        |  4   | SUBQUERY     | rental     |
        |  5   | UNION        | dummy      |
        | NULL | UNION RESULT | &lt;union3,5&gt; |
        |  2   | DERIVED      | film       |

       The siblings all have id 1, and the middle one I care about is derived3.  (Notice MySQL  doesn't  execute
       them  in  the  order  I  defined  them, which is fine).  Now notice that MySQL prints out the rows in the
       opposite order I defined the subqueries: 6, 3, 2.  It always seems to do this, and there might  be  other
       methods  of  finding  the  scope  boundaries including looking for the lower boundary of the next largest
       sibling, but this is a good enough heuristic.  I am forced to rely on it for non-DERIVED subqueries, so I
       rely on it here too.  Therefore, I decide that everything greater than or  equal  to  3  belongs  to  the
       DERIVED scope.

       The rule for UNION is simple: they consume the entire enclosing scope, and to find the component parts of
       each  one,  you  find each part's beginning as referred to in the &lt;unionN,...&gt; definition, and its end is
       either just before the next one, or if it's the last part, the end is the end of the scope.

       This is only simple because UNION consumes the entire scope, which is either the entire statement, or the
       scope of a DERIVED table.  This is because a UNION cannot be a sibling  of  another  UNION  or  a  table,
       DERIVED or not.  (Try writing such a statement if you don't see it intuitively).  Therefore, you can just
       find  the  enclosing scope's boundaries, and the rest is easy.  Notice in the example above, the UNION is
       over &lt;union3,5&gt;, which includes the row with id 4 -- it includes every row between 3 and 5.

       Finally, there are non-derived subqueries to deal with as well.  In this case I can't look at siblings to
       find the end of the scope as I did for DERIVED.  I have to trust that MySQL executes depth-first.  Here's
       an example:

        explain
        select actor_id,
        (
           select count(film_id)
           + (select count(*) from sakila.film)
           from sakila.film join sakila.film_actor using(film_id)
           where exists(
              select * from sakila.actor
              where sakila.actor.actor_id = sakila.film_actor.actor_id
           )
        )
        from sakila.actor;

        | id | select_type        | table      |
        |  1 | PRIMARY            | actor      |
        |  2 | SUBQUERY           | film       |
        |  2 | SUBQUERY           | film_actor |
        |  4 | DEPENDENT SUBQUERY | actor      |
        |  3 | SUBQUERY           | film       |

       In order, the tree should be built like this:

       •   See row 1.

       •   See row 2.  It's a higher id than 1, so it's a subquery, along with  every  other  row  whose  id  is
           greater than 2.

       •   Inside  this  scope,  see  2  and  2 and JOIN them.  See 4.  It's a higher id than 2, so it's again a
           subquery; recurse.  After that, see 3, which is also higher; recurse.

       But the only reason the nested subquery didn't include select 3 is because select 4 came first.  In other
       words, if EXPLAIN looked like this,

        | id | select_type        | table      |
        |  1 | PRIMARY            | actor      |
        |  2 | SUBQUERY           | film       |
        |  2 | SUBQUERY           | film_actor |
        |  3 | SUBQUERY           | film       |
        |  4 | DEPENDENT SUBQUERY | actor      |

       I would be forced to assume upon seeing select 3 that select 4 is a subquery  of  it,  rather  than  just
       being the next sibling in the enclosing scope.  If this is ever wrong, then the algorithm is wrong, and I
       don't see what could be done about it.

       UNION  is  a  little  more  complicated  than just "the entire scope is a UNION," because the UNION might
       itself be inside an enclosing scope that's only indicated by the first item inside the UNION.  There  are
       only three kinds of enclosing scopes: UNION, DERIVED, and SUBQUERY.  A UNION can't enclose a UNION, and a
       DERIVED has its own "scope markers," but a SUBQUERY can wholly enclose a UNION, like this strange example
       on the empty table t1:

        explain select * from t1 where not exists(
           (select t11.i from t1 t11) union (select t12.i from t1 t12));

        |   id | select_type  | table      | Extra                          |
        +------+--------------+------------+--------------------------------+
        |    1 | PRIMARY      | t1         | const row not found            |
        |    2 | SUBQUERY     | NULL       | No tables used                 |
        |    3 | SUBQUERY     | NULL       | no matching row in const table |
        |    4 | UNION        | t12        | const row not found            |
        | NULL | UNION RESULT | &lt;union2,4&gt; |                                |

       The UNION's backward references might make it look like the UNION encloses the subquery, but studying the
       query  makes it clear this isn't the case.  So when a UNION's first row says SUBQUERY, it is this special
       case.

       By the way, I don't fully understand this query plan; there are 4 numbered SELECT in the plan, but only 3
       in the query.  The parens around the  UNIONs  are  meaningful.   Removing  them  will  make  the  EXPLAIN
       different.  Please tell me how and why this works if you know.

       Armed  with  this knowledge, it's possible to use recursion to turn the parent-child relationship between
       all the rows into a tree representing the execution plan.

       MySQL prints the rows in execution order, even the forward and backward references.  At any given  scope,
       the rows are processed as a left-deep tree.  MySQL does not do "bushy" execution plans.  It begins with a
       table,  finds  a  matching row in the next table, and continues till the last table, when it emits a row.
       When it runs out, it backtracks till it can find the next row  and  repeats.   There  are  subtleties  of
       course,  but  this is the basic plan.  This is why MySQL transforms all RIGHT OUTER JOINs into LEFT OUTER
       JOINs and cannot do FULL OUTER JOIN.

       This means in any given scope, say

        | id   | select_type  | table      |
        |  1   | SIMPLE       | tbl1       |
        |  1   | SIMPLE       | tbl2       |
        |  1   | SIMPLE       | tbl3       |

       The execution plan looks like a depth-first traversal of this tree:

              JOIN
             /    \
           JOIN  tbl3
          /    \
        tbl1   tbl2

       The JOIN might not be a JOIN.  It might be a subquery, for example.  This comes from the type  column  of
       EXPLAIN.   The  documentation  says  this  is  a "join type," but I think "access type" is more accurate,
       because it's "how MySQL accesses rows."

       pt-visual-explain decorates the tree significantly more than just turning rows into nodes.  Each node may
       get a series of transformations that turn it into a subtree of more than one node.  For example, an index
       scan not marked with 'Using index' must do a bookmark lookup into the table rows; that  is  a  three-node
       subtree.   However,  after  the  above node-ordering and scoping stuff, the rest of the process is pretty
       simple.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       This tool accepts additional command-line arguments.  Refer to the "SYNOPSIS" and usage  information  for
       details.

       --ask-pass
           Prompt for a password when connecting to MySQL.

       --charset
           short form: -A; type: string

           Default  character  set.   If  the  value  is utf8, sets Perl's binmode on STDOUT to utf8, passes the
           mysql_enable_utf8 option to DBD::mysql, and runs SET NAMES UTF8 after connecting to MySQL.  Any other
           value sets binmode on STDOUT without the utf8 layer, and runs SET NAMES after connecting to MySQL.

       --clustered-pk
           Assume that PRIMARY KEY index accesses don't need to do a bookmark lookup to retrieve rows.  This  is
           the case for InnoDB.

       --config
           type: Array

           Read  this  comma-separated  list of config files; if specified, this must be the first option on the
           command line.

       --connect
           Treat input as a query, and obtain EXPLAIN output by connecting  to  a  MySQL  instance  and  running
           EXPLAIN  on  the  query.   When  this  option  is given, pt-visual-explain uses the other connection-
           specific options such as "--user" to connect to the MySQL instance.  If you have a .my.cnf  file,  it
           will read it, so you may not need to specify any connection-specific options.

       --database
           short form: -D; type: string

           Connect to this database.

       --defaults-file
           short form: -F; type: string

           Only read mysql options from the given file.  You must give an absolute pathname.

       --format
           type: string; default: tree

           Set output format.

           The default is a terse pretty-printed tree. The valid values are:

            Value  Meaning
            =====  ================================================
            tree   Pretty-printed terse tree.
            dump   Data::Dumper output (see Data::Dumper for more).

       --help
           Show help and exit.

       --host
           short form: -h; type: string

           Connect to host.

       --password
           short form: -p; type: string

           Password  to use when connecting.  If password contains commas they must be escaped with a backslash:
           "exam\,ple"

       --pid
           type: string

           Create the given PID file.  The tool won't start if the PID  file  already  exists  and  the  PID  it
           contains  is different than the current PID.  However, if the PID file exists and the PID it contains
           is no longer running, the tool will overwrite the PID file with the current PID.   The  PID  file  is
           removed automatically when the tool exits.

       --port
           short form: -P; type: int

           Port number to use for connection.

       --set-vars
           type: Array

           Set the MySQL variables in this comma-separated list of "variable=value" pairs.

           By default, the tool sets:

              wait_timeout=10000

           Variables specified on the command line override these defaults.  For example, specifying "--set-vars
           wait_timeout=500" overrides the defaultvalue of 10000.

           The tool prints a warning and continues if a variable cannot be set.

       --socket
           short form: -S; type: string

           Socket file to use for connection.

       --user
           short form: -u; type: string

           User for login if not current user.

       --version
           Show version and exit.

</pre><h4><b>DSN</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       These  DSN  options are used to create a DSN.  Each option is given like "option=value".  The options are
       case-sensitive, so P and p are not the same option.  There cannot be whitespace before or after  the  "="
       and  if  the  value  contains  whitespace  it  must be quoted.  DSN options are comma-separated.  See the
       percona-toolkit manpage for full details.

       •   A

           dsn: charset; copy: yes

           Default character set.

       •   D

           dsn: database; copy: yes

           Default database.

       •   F

           dsn: mysql_read_default_file; copy: yes

           Only read default options from the given file

       •   h

           dsn: host; copy: yes

           Connect to host.

       •   p

           dsn: password; copy: yes

           Password to use when connecting.  If password contains commas they must be escaped with a  backslash:
           "exam\,ple"

       •   P

           dsn: port; copy: yes

           Port number to use for connection.

       •   S

           dsn: mysql_socket; copy: yes

           Socket file to use for connection.

       •   u

           dsn: user; copy: yes

           User for login if not current user.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       The  environment  variable "PTDEBUG" enables verbose debugging output to STDERR.  To enable debugging and
       capture all output to a file, run the tool like:

          PTDEBUG=1 pt-visual-explain ... &gt; FILE 2&gt;&amp;1

       Be careful: debugging output is voluminous and can generate several megabytes of output.

</pre><h4><b>SYSTEM</b> <b>REQUIREMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       You need Perl, DBI, DBD::mysql, and some core packages that ought to be installed in any  reasonably  new
       version of Perl.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
