</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       mdns-scan - Scan for mDNS/DNS-SD services published on the local network

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>mdns-scan</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       mdns-scan  is  a  tool  for scanning for mDNS/DNS-SD published services on the local network. It issues a
       mDNS PTR query to the special RR _services._dns-sd._udp.local for retrieving  a  list  of  all  currently
       registered services on the local link.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>mdns-scan</b> has no commandline options.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       mdns-scan  is  not  a  good mDNS citizen since it queries continuously for services and doesn't implement
       features like Duplicate Suppression. It is intended for usage as a debugging tool only.

       mdns-scan is incomplete since it doesn't resolve mDNS services for you - it just dumps their PTR RRs.  To
       understand these records you need minimal knowledge of DNS-SD and how it works.

       mdns-scan  does  not terminate on its own behalf. It scans for services continuously until the user kills
       it by pressing C-c.

       mdns-scan does not rely on a local mDNS responder daemon. It has no dependencies besides the GNU libc. It
       has been tested on Linux only.

       mdns-scan does NOT scan for local mDNS enabled hosts or  A/AAAA  RRs,  it  scans  for  DNS-SD  registered
       services, nothing else.
