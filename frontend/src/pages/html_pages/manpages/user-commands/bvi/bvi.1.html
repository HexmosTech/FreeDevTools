       bvi, bview - visual editor for binary files

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       bvi-1.4.1

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>bvi</b>   [<b>-R</b>] [<b>-c</b> <u>cmd</u>] [<b>-f</b> <u>script</u>] [<b>-s</b> <u>skip</u>] [<b>-e</b> <u>end</u>] [<b>-n</b> <u>length</u>] <u>file</u>...
       <b>bview</b> [<b>-R</b>] [<b>-c</b> <u>cmd</u>] [<b>-f</b> <u>script</u>] [<b>-s</b> <u>skip</u>] [<b>-e</b> <u>end</u>] [<b>-n</b> <u>length</u>] <u>file</u>...

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>file</u>...
           A   list   of  filenames.  The first one will be the current file and will be read into  the  buffer.
           The  cursor  will  be  positioned on the first line of the buffer.  You can get to  the  other  files
           with the ":next" command.

       <b>-R</b>  "Readonly":  The  readonly  flag  is  set for all the files, preventing accidental overwriting with a
           write command.

       <b>-s</b> <u>skip</u>
           causes bvi to load a file not from the start but from  offset  <u>skip</u>.   Skip  offset  bytes  from  the
           beginning of the input.  By default, offset is interpreted as a decimal number.  With a leading 0x or
           0X, offset is interpreted as a hexadecimal number, otherwise, with a leading 0, offset is interpreted
           as  an  octal  number.  Appending the character b, k, or m to offset causes it to be interpreted as a
           multiple of 512, 1024, or 1048576, respectively.

       <b>-e</b> <u>end</u>
           causes bvi to load a file not till end but till address <u>end</u>.

       <b>-n</b> <u>length</u>
           causes bvi not to load the complete file but only <u>length</u> bytes.

       <b>-c</b> <u>cmd</u>
           <u>cmd</u> will be  executed  after  the  first file  has been read. If the  <u>cmd</u>  contains spaces  it   must
           be enclosed in double quotes (this depends on  the  shell  that  is  used).

       <b>-f</b> <u>script</u>
           This  command  provides  a means for collecting a series of "ex" (colon) commands into a script file,
           then using this file to edit other files. Since there is no binary stream editor "bsed", you can  use
           this option to make several global changes in a binary file.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Bvi stands for "Binary VIsual editor".  Bvi is a screen oriented editor for binary files; its command set
       is  based  on  that of the <u><a href="../man1/vi.1.html">vi</a></u>(1) text editor.  As bvi is a binary editor, it does not have the concept of
       "lines".  All end-of-lines (EOLs) are simply bytes.  Therefore bvi's commands  are  different  from  vi's
       commands for all line-oriented commands (see below).

</pre><h4><b>COMPARISON</b></h4><pre>
       The main differences between Vi and Bvi are:

       The  screen is divided in three sections or panes: The byte offset (extreme left), the hex pane (middle),
       and an ascii pane (right) which shows as printable characters those bytes in the  hex  pane.   On  an  80
       column  terminal  there will be sixteen hex values and their ASCII values on each screen line.  Note that
       (as one would expect) the first byte has the offset '0' (zero).

       You can toggle between the hex and ascii windows with the tab key  (TAB).   Toggling  between  these  two
       windows does not change the current position (offset) within the file.

       No  "lines"  concept:  Files  are  treated  as  one  long  stream of bytes.  The characters "newline" and
       "carriage return" are not special, id est they never mark the end of lines.  Therefore the lines  on  the
       screen  do  not  represent lines in the usual way.  Data is broken across screen lines arbitrarily.  As a
       consequence there are no commands in bvi from ex or vi that are based on line  numbers,  eg  "dd",  "yy",
       'C',  'S',  'o',  'O'.   This  also  changes the meaning of "range" before the ":write" command to a byte
       offset, ie the command ":100,200w foo" writes all *bytes* (not lines) from offset 100 to  offset  200  to
       the file "foo".

       No  "text  objects":  There  are  also  no  text-specific arrangements like words, paragraphs, sentences,
       sections and so on.

       Extended "ruler": The bottom line of the screen shows the current address (byte offset) and  the  current
       character in these notations:

               octal, hexadecimal, decimal and ascii.

       Search patterns: All search commands understand these special characters:

            .    any character
            []   set of characters
            *    zero or more occurrences of previous char or set

       But  as  there is no concept of lines you cannot use the standard symbols ("anchors") for "begin-of-line"
       ('^') and "end-of-line" ('$').  Searching for the start/end of lines must be done  explicitly  by  adding
       these special characters to your search pattern using these meta sequences:

               \n   newline
               \r   return
               \t   tab
               \0   binary zero

       Additional search commands: Similar to the text search commands there are additional hex-search functions
       '\'  and  '#'  which  allow  one to search for any byte value.  Example:  "\62 76 69" will search for the
       string "bvi".  Spaces between hex value are optional, so searching for "6775636B6573" will find "guckes".

       Changing the length of data (insertion, deletion) moves the data to other addresses; this is bad for many
       cases (eg. databases, program files) and is thus disabled by default. You can  enable  this  commands  by
       typing

            :set memmove

       <b>BVI</b> <b>Modes:</b>

       Command Mode (Normal Mode):

       Input is treated as command.  Note that command mode is the default mode after startup and after escaping
       from input mode.  Use ESC (escape) to cancel a partial (uncompleted) command.

       Input Mode:

       Input  is  treated as replacement of current characters or (after the end of the file) is appended to the
       current file.  This mode is entered from command mode by typing one of 'i', 'I', 'A', 'r', or  'R'.   You
       can  enter  the  characters  from  the  keyboard  (in the ASCII window) or hexadecimal values (in the HEX
       window).  Type TAB to switch between these two windows.  Type ESC to finish the current input and  return
       to command mode.  Type CTRL-C to cancel current command abnormally.

       Command line mode (Last Line Mode or : mode):

       Similar  to  vi,  this  mode  is  entered  by  typing  one  of the characters : / ? \ # !  The command is
       terminated and executed by typing a carriage return; to cancel a partially typed  command,  type  ESC  to
       cancel the current command and return to command mode.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       The  editor recognizes the environment variable BVIINIT as  a command  (or  list of commands) to run when
       it starts up. If this variable is undefined, the editor  checks  for  startup  commands   in   the   file
       <u><a href="file:~/.bvirc">~/.bvirc</a></u>   file,  which  you  must  own.   However,  if  there is a <u>.bvirc</u> owned by you  in  the  current
       directory,  the  editor takes its startup commands from this file - overriding both the file in your home
       directory  and the environment variable.

</pre><h4><b>TERMINOLOGY</b></h4><pre>
       Characters names are abbreviated as follows:
            Abbr.     ASCII     name      aka
            CR        010       carriage return

            ^Z        026       control-z
            ESC       027       escape         aka ESC
            DEL       127       delete

         DEL         (delete or rubout) interrupts

       <b>File</b> <b>manipulation:</b>
         ZZ          if file modified, write and exit;
                     otherwise, exit
         :w          write changed buffer to file
         :w!         write changed buffer to file, overriding
                     read-only ("forced" write)
         :q          quit when no changes have been made
         :q!         quit and discard all changes
         :e <u>file</u>     edit <u>file</u>
         :e!         re-read current file, discard all changes
         :e #        edit the alternate file
         :e! #       edit the alternate file, discard changes
         :w  <u>file</u>    write current buffer to <u>file</u>
         :w! <u>file</u>    write current buffer to <u>file</u> overriding
                     read-only (this "overwrites" the file)
         :sh         run the command as set with option "shell",
                     then return
         :!<u>cmd</u>       run the command <u>cmd</u> from "shell", then
                     return
         :n          edit next file in the argument list
         :f          show current filename, modified flag,
                     current byte offset, and percentage of
                     current position within buffer
         ^G          same as :f

       <b>Additional</b> <b>edit</b> <b>commands</b>
         You  can  insert/append/change  bytes in ASCII/binary/decimal/ hexadecimal or octal representation. You
       can enter several (screen) lines of input. A line with only  a  period  (.)  in  it  will  terminate  the
       command.  You  must  not  type  in  values  greater  than a byte value. This causes an abandonment of the
       command.  Pressing the CR key does not insert a newline - character into the file. If you use ASCII  mode
       you can use the special characters \n, \r, \t and \0.

         :i aCR      insert bytes (ASCII) at cursor position
         :a bCR      append bytes (Binary) at end of file
         :c hCR      change bytes (hexadecimal) at cursor position

       <b>Bit-level</b> <b>operations</b>
         :and <u>n</u>      bitwise 'and' operation with value <u>n</u>
         :or  <u>n</u>      bitwise 'or' operation with value <u>n</u>
         :xor <u>n</u>      bitwise 'xor' operation with value <u>n</u>
         :neg        two's   complement
         :not        logical negation
         :sl <u>i</u>       shift  each byte <u>i</u> bits to the left
         :sr <u>i</u>       shift  each byte <u>i</u> bits to the right
         :rl <u>i</u>       rotate each byte <u>i</u> bits to the left
         :rr <u>i</u>       rotate each byte <u>i</u> bits to the right

       <b>Command</b> <b>mode</b> <b>addresses</b>
         :w foo         write current buffer to a file
                        named "foo"
         :5,10w foo     copy byte 5 through 100 into as
                        file named foo
         :.,.+20w foo   copy the current byte and the next

       <b>Positioning</b> <b>within</b> <b>file:</b>
         ^B      backward screen
         ^F      forward  screen
         ^D      scroll down half screen

       <b>Marking</b> <b>and</b> <b>returning:</b>
         m<u>x</u>      mark current position with lower-case letter <u>x</u>
                 Note: this command works for all lower-case letters
         '<u>x</u>      move cursor to mark <u>x</u> in ASCII section
         `<u>x</u>      move cursor to mark <u>x</u> in HEX section
         ''      move cursor to previous context in ASCII section
         ``      move cursor to previous context in HEX section

       <b>Line</b> <b>positioning:</b>
         H           jump to first      line on screen ("top")
         L           jump to last       line on screen ("low")
         M           jump to middle     line on screen ("middle")
         -           jump onto previous line on screen

         CR          same as +
         DOWN or j   next     line, same column
         UP   or k   previous line, same column

       <b>Character</b> <b>positioning:</b>

         $           end of screen line
         l or RIGHT  jump onto next byte (within current
                     screen line)
         h or LEFT   jump onto previous byte (within current
                     screen line)
         ^H          same as LEFT
         space       same as RIGHT
         f<u>x</u>          find next     occurrence of character <u>x</u>
         F<u>x</u>          find previous occurrence of character <u>x</u>
         <u>n</u>⎪          jump onto <u>n</u>th byte/character within current
                     line

       <b>Strings:</b>
         (works similar to the <u><a href="../man1/strings.1.html">strings</a></u>(1) command)
         Note:  "Words" are defined as strings of "nonprinting
         characters".
         e       jump to next     end   of word
         w       jump to next     begin of word
         b       jump to previous begin of word
         W       forward to next string delimited with a
                 \0 or \n
         B       back to previous string delimited with a
                 nonprinting char

       <b>Corrections</b> <b>during</b> <b>insert:</b>
         ^H      erase last character (backspace)
         erase   your erase character, same as ^H (backspace)
         ESC     ends insertion, back to command mode

       <b>Append</b> <b>and</b> <b>replace:</b>
         A       append at end of file
         rx      replace current bte with char 'x'
         R       enter replace mode; for all subsequent input,
                 the  current  byte is overwritten with the next             input character; leave replace mode
       with ESC.

       <b>Miscellaneous</b> <b>Operations:</b>
         TAB     toggle between ASCII and HEX section

       <b>Yank</b> <b>and</b> <b>Put:</b>
         3ySPACE yank 3 characters
         p       insert contents of yank buffer
         o       replace text with content of yank buffer
         P       put back at end of file

       <b>Undo,</b> <b>Redo:</b>
         u       undo last change
                 Note:  Only the last change can be undone.
                 Therefore this commands toggles between the
                 last and second-t-last state of the buffer.
