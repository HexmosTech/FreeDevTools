</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       lepton-tragesym - create Lepton EDA symbols from structured text files

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>lepton-tragesym</b> <u>SOURCE-FILE</u> <u>SYMBOL-FILE</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>lepton-tragesym</b> creates lepton-schematic symbols from structured text files.

       <b>lepton-tragesym</b> can:

       •      create  pins,  their elements (clocksign, negation bubble), and attributes (“pinnumber”, “pinseq”,
              “pintype”, and “pinlabel”);

       •      sort the pins alphabetically by their attributes;

       •      rotate pinlabel attributes of the top and bottom pins if requested;

       •      swap words in the pinlabel attributes if requested (only for attributes of the right and top pins,
              in the latter case only if rotation is also requested);

       •      do some syntax checking to the input file.

</pre><h4><b>SOURCE</b> <b>FILE</b> <b>FORMAT</b></h4><pre>
   <b>General</b>
       Source file is a text file consisting of three sections:
       • <b>[geda_attr]</b>
       • <b>[options]</b>
       • <b>[pins]</b>

       Section name should be enclosed in square brackets.

       Empty lines, lines consisting of whitespaces only, as well as lines  beginning  with  the  character  '#'
       (comments) are silently ignored.

   <b>[options]</b>
       The section contains export settings.  The following settings are supported:

       •      <b>wordswap</b> (<u>boolean</u>)
              Swap  labels if the pin is on the right side and contains space between words, that is, looks like
              this: “PB1 (CLK)”.  That may be useful for micro controller port labels.

       •      <b>rotate_labels</b> (<u>boolean</u>)
              Rotate the “pinlabel” attribute of the top and bottom pins by 90 degrees.  This may be useful  for
              large symbols like FPGAs with more than 100 pins.

       •      <b>sort_labels</b> (<u>boolean</u>)
              Sort the pins by their “pinlabel” attributes, which is useful for address ports, busses, etc.

       •      <b>generate_pinseq</b> (<u>boolean</u>)
              Automatically  generate “pinseq” attributes for those pins whose corresponding field in the source
              file is empty.  The generated attribute values are  numbers  incremented  in  the  order  the  pin
              description lines appear in the <b>[pins]</b> section except for already existing numbers.

       •      <b>sym_width</b> (<u>integer</u>)
              Minimum box width of the resulting symbol.

       •      <b>pinwidthvertical</b> (<u>integer</u>)
              The vertical distance between pins on the left or right hand side of the symbol.

       •      <b>pinwidthhorizontal</b> (<u>integer</u>)
              The horizontal distance between pins on the top or bottom of the symbol.

              The  boolean  values  are specified in the source file by the words “yes” or “on” meaning TRUE and
              “no” or “off” meaning FALSE.

   <b>[geda_attr]</b>
       The section contains the list of Lepton symbol attributes (“name=value” pairs) which you  would  want  to
       see  in  the symbol file.  The attribute names may be separated by the equal or tabulation character (“=”
       or “\t”).  The tab separator is supported for convenient export from spreadsheet programs.

   <b>[pins]</b>
       The section contains the description of symbol pins to be made, one pin per line.   The  pin  description
       consists of seven tab separated fields, any of which may contain empty value (no character between tabs).
       The fields define the following pin attributes and properties:

       1. “pinnumber” attribute
          The “pinnumber” attribute represents the physical number of the component pin.

       2. “pinseq” attribute
          The “pinseq” attribute is used in Lepton to assign pin numbers for slotted components and by the SPICE
          backends to output pins in right order.  Leave the field blank if it doesn't matter.

       3. “pintype” attribute
          The  “pintype” attribute defines the pin function (input, output, power, etc.) and can be one of “in”,
          “out”, “io”, “oc”, “oe”, “pas”, “tp”, “tri”, “clk”, or “pwr”.   The  attribute  is  used  by  the  DRC
          backends to check component interconnection validity.

       4. pin style
          Pin style determines the appearance of the pin.  It can be one of “line” (simple pin), “dot” (pin with
          negation  bubble),  “clk”  (pin  with clock symbol), “dotclk” (bubble and clock), “spacer” (not a pin,
          just additional empty space between two pins),  or  “none”  (to  add  a  virtual  pin  via  the  “net”
          attribute).

       5. pin position
          Pin  position determines the side of the component the pin should be placed on.  It can be “l” (left),
          “r” (right), “t” (top), “b” (bottom), or empty (“”) when the  pin  should  be  defined  in  the  “net”
          attribute.

       6. pin net
          Specifies the net name of the pin to define via the “net” attribute, for example, “Vcc” or “GND”.

       7. “pinlabel” attribute
          The  “pinlabel”  attribute  represents  the  visible pin label defining its name in the component, for
          example “A” (anode) or “C” (cathode) in a diode symbol.  Negation lines can be added  with  “\_”,  for
          example,  “\_enable\_”.   If  you want to add the character “\”, use “\\” as escape sequence.  This is
          supported by `lepton-schematic`.
