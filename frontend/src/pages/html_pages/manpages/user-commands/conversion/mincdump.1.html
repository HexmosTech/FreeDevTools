       mincdump - Convert minc files to ASCII form (CDL)

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>

       mincdump [-c] [-h] [-v <u>var1,...</u>]  [-b <u>lang</u>] [-f <u>lang</u>] [-l <u>len</u>] [-n <u>name</u>] [-p <u>f_digits[,d_digits]</u>] <u>file</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>mincdump</b>  is  based  upon  the  netCDF tool <b>ncdump</b>, modified to work with both MINC 1 (netCDF) and MINC 2
       (HDF5) format files.  It is intended for use primarily with scripts  such  as  <b>mincdiff</b>  and  <b>mincheader</b>.
       Since it was not created at the Montreal Neurological Insititute it does not follow the usual conventions
       for MINC programs.

       <b>mincdump</b> generates an ASCII representation of a specified minc file on standard output.  The ASCII repre‐
       sentation  is in a form called CDL (``network Common Data form Language'') that can be viewed, edited, or
       serve as input to <b>ncgen</b>.  <b>ncgen</b> is a companion program that can generate a binary minc file  from  a  CDL
       file.   Hence <b>ncgen</b> and <b>mincdump</b> can be used as inverses to transform the data representation between bi‐
       nary and ASCII representations.  See <b>ncgen</b> for a description of CDL and netCDF representations.

       <b>mincdump</b> defines a default format used for each type of netCDF data, but this can be changed if a `C_for‐
       mat' attribute is defined for a netCDF variable.  In this case, <b>mincdump</b>  will  use  the  `C_format'  at‐
       tribute  to  format each value.  For example, if floating-point data for the netCDF variable `Z' is known
       to be accurate to only three significant digits, it would be appropriate to use the variable attribute

              Z:C_format = "%.3g"

       <b>mincdump</b> may also be used as a simple browser for netCDF data files, to display the dimension  names  and
       sizes;  variable names, types, and shapes; attribute names and values; and optionally, the values of data
       for all variables or selected variables in a netCDF file.

       <b>mincdump</b> uses `_' to represent data values that are equal to the `NC_FillValue' attribute for a variable,
       intended to represent data that has not yet been written.  If a variable has no `NC_FillValue' attribute,
       the default fill value for the variable type is used if the variable is not of byte type.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-c</b>     Show the values of <u>coordinate</u> variables (variables that are also dimensions) as well as the decla‐
              rations of all dimensions, variables, and attribute values.  Data values of  non-coordinate  vari‐
              ables are not included in the output.  This is the most suitable option to use for a brief look at
              the structure and contents of a netCDF file.

       <b>-h</b>     Show only the <u>header</u> information in the output, that is the declarations of dimensions, variables,
              and  attributes but no data values for any variables.  The output is identical to using the <b>-c</b> op‐
              tion except that the values of coordinate variables are not included.  (At most one of  <b>-c</b>  or  <b>-h</b>
              options may be present.)

       <b>-v</b> <u>var1,...,varn</u>
              The  output  will include data values for the specified variables, in addition to the declarations
              of all dimensions, variables, and attributes.  One or more variables must be specified by name  in
              the  comma-delimited  list  following this option.  The list must be a single argument to the com‐
              mand, hence cannot contain blanks or other white space characters.  The named  variables  must  be
              valid  netCDF variables in the input-file.  The default, without this option and in the absence of
              the <b>-c</b> or <b>-h</b> options, is to include data values for <u>all</u> variables in the output.

       <b>-b</b> <u>lang</u>
              A brief annotation in the form of a CDL comment (text beginning with the characters  ``//'')  will
              be included in the data section of the output for each `row' of data, to help identify data values
              for  multidimensional variables.  If <u>lang</u> begins with `C' or `c', then C language conventions will
              be used (zero-based indices, last dimension varying fastest).  If <u>lang</u> begins  with  `F'  or  `f',
              then  Fortran  language  conventions  will  be  used  (one-based  indices, first dimension varying
              fastest).  In either case, the data will be presented in the same order; only the annotations will
              differ.  This option is useful for browsing through large volumes of multidimensional data.

       <b>-f</b> <u>lang</u>
              Full annotations in the form of trailing CDL comments (text beginning with the characters  ``//'')
              for  every  data  value (except individual characters in character arrays) will be included in the
              data section.  If <u>lang</u> begins with `C' or `c', then C language conventions  will  be  used  (zero-
              based indices, last dimension varying fastest).  If <u>lang</u> begins with `F' or `f', then Fortran lan‐
              guage  conventions  will  be used (one-based indices, first dimension varying fastest).  In either
              case, the data will be presented in the same order; only the annotations will differ.  This option
              may be useful for piping data into other filters, since each data  value  appears  on  a  separate
              line, fully identified.

       <b>-l</b> <u>len</u> Changes  the  default maximum line length (80) used in formatting lists of non-character data val‐
              ues.

       <b>-n</b> <u>name</u>
              CDL requires a name for a netCDF data set, for use by <b>ncgen</b> <b>-b</b> in generating a default netCDF file
              name.  By default, <u>mincdump</u> constructs this name from the last component of the  pathname  of  the
              input netCDF file by stripping off any extension it has.  Use the <b>-n</b> option to specify a different
              name.   Although  the  output  file name used by <b>ncgen</b> <b>-b</b> can be specified, it may be wise to have
              <u>mincdump</u> change the default name to avoid inadvertently overwriting a valuable  netCDF  file  when
              using  <b>mincdump</b>,  editing the resulting CDL file, and using <b>ncgen</b> <b>-b</b> to generate a new netCDF file
              from the edited CDL file.

       <b>-p</b> <u>float_digits[,double_digits]</u>
              Specifies default precision (number of significant digits) to use in displaying floating-point  or
              double precision data values for attributes and variables.  If specified, this value overrides the
              value of the `C_format' attribute for any variable that has such an attribute.  Floating-point da‐
              ta  will  be  displayed with <u>float_digits</u> significant digits.  If <u>double_digits</u> is also specified,
              double-precision values will be displayed with that many significant digits.  In  the  absence  of
              any  <b>-p</b>  specifications, floating-point and double-precision data are displayed with 7 and 15 sig‐
              nificant digits respectively.  CDL files can be made smaller if less precision  is  required.   If
              both floating-point and double-presision precisions are specified, the two values must appear sep‐
              arated  by a comma (no blanks) as a single argument to the command.  If you really want every last
              bit of precision from the netCDF file represented in the CDL file for all possible  floating-point
              values,  you  will  have to specify this with <b>-p</b> <b>9,17</b> (according to Theorem 15 of the paper listed
              under REFERENCES).

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Look at the structure of the data in the netCDF file `<b>foo.mnc</b>':

              mincdump -c foo.mnc

       Produce an annotated CDL version of the structure and data in the netCDF file  `<b>foo.mnc</b>',  using  C-style
       indexing for the annotations:

              mincdump -b c foo.mnc &gt; foo.cdl

       Output  data  for  only  the  variables  `uwind' and `vwind' from the netCDF file `<b>foo.mnc</b>', and show the
       floating-point data with only three significant digits of precision:

              mincdump -v uwind,vwind -p 3 foo.mnc

       Produce a fully-annotated (one data value per line) listing of the data for the variable  `omega',  using
       Fortran  conventions  for  indices,  and  changing  the  netCDF dataset name in the resulting CDL file to
       `omega':

              mincdump -v omega -f fortran -n omega foo.mnc &gt; Z.cdl

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Character arrays that contain a null-byte are treated like C strings, so no  characters  after  the  null
       byte appear in the output.

       Multidimensional  character  string arrays are not handled well, since the CDL syntax for breaking a long
       character string into several shorter lines is weak.

       There should be a way to specify that the data should be displayed in `record' order, that  is  with  the
       all the values for `record' variables together that have the same value of the record dimension.
