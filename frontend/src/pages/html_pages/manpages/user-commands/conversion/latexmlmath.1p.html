        --includestyles            allows processing raw *.sty files
                                   (normally it avoids this)

        --strict                   be more strict about errors.
        --documentid=id            assign an id to the document root.
        --debug=package            enables debugging output for the
                                   named package
        --inputencoding=enc specify the input encoding.
        --VERSION                  show version number and exit.
        --help                     shows this help message.
        --                         ends options

       If <u>texmath</u> is '-', "latexmlmath" reads the TeX from standard input.  If any of the output files are '-',
       the result is printed on standard output.

   <b>Input</b> <b>notes</b>
       Note that, unless you are reading <u>texmath</u> from standard input, the <u>texmath</u> string will be processed by
       whatever shell you are using before "latexmlmath" even sees it.  This means that many so-called meta
       characters, such as backslash and star,  may confuse the shell or be changed.  Consequently, you will
       need to quote and/or slashify the input appropriately.  Most particularly, "\" will need to be doubled to
       "\\" for "latexmlmath" to see it as a control sequence.

       Using "--" to explicitly end the option list is useful for cases when the math starts with a minus (and
       would otherwise be interpreted as an option, probably an unrecognized one). Alternatively, wrapping the
       <u>texmath</u> with {} will hide the minus.

       Simple examples:

         latexmlmath \\frac{-b\\pm\\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}
         echo "\\sqrt{b^2-4ac}" | latexmlmath --pmml=quad.mml -

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b> <b>AND</b> <b>ARGUMENTS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Conversion</b> <b>Options</b>
       These options specify what formats the math should be converted to.  In each case, the destination file
       is given.  Except for mathimage, the file can be given as '-', in which case the result is printed to
       standard output.

       If no conversion option is specified, the default is to output presentation MathML to standard output.

       "--mathimage"=<u>file</u>
           Requests conversion to png images.

       "--mathsvg"=<u>file</u>
           Requests conversion to svg images.

       "--magnification="<u>factor</u>
           Specifies the magnification used for math image. Default is 1.75.

       "--presentationmathml"=<u>file</u>
           Requests conversion to Presentation MathML.

       "--linelength"<u>=number</u>
           (Experimental)  Line-breaks  the  generated  Presentation  MathML so that it is no longer than <u>number</u>
           `characters'.

       "--plane1"
           Converts the content of Presentation  MathML  token  elements  to  the  appropriate  Unicode  Plane-1
           codepoints according to the selected font, when applicable.

       "--hackplane1"
           Converts  the  content  of  Presentation  MathML  token  elements  to the appropriate Unicode Plane-1
           codepoints according to the selected font, but only for the mathvariants double-struck,  fraktur  and
           script.   This  gives  support  for  current  (as of August 2009) versions of Firefox and MathPlayer,
           provided a sufficient set of fonts is available (eg. STIX).

       "--contentmathml"=<u>file</u>
           Requests conversion to Content MathML.  <b>Note</b> that this conversion is only partially implemented.

       "--openmath"=<u>file</u>
           Requests conversion to OpenMath.  <b>Note</b> that this conversion is only partially implemented.

       "--unicodemath"=<u>file</u>
           Requests conversion to UnicodeMath (an unstructured Unicode string).

       "--XMath"=<u>file</u>
           Requests conversion to LaTeXML's internal format.

</pre><h4><b>Other</b> <b>Options</b></h4><pre>
       "--preload"=<u>module</u>
           Requests the loading of an optional module or package.  This may be useful if the TeX code  does  not
           specifically   require   the   module   (eg.   through   input  or  usepackage).   For  example,  use
           "--preload=LaTeX.pool" to force LaTeX mode.

       "--includestyles"
           This optional allows processing of style files (files with extensions "sty",  "cls",  "clo",  "cnf").
           By  default,  these  files  are  ignored   unless  a latexml implementation of them is found (with an
           extension of "ltxml").

           These style files generally fall into two classes:  Those  that  merely  affect  document  style  are
           ignorable  in  the  XML.   Others  define new markup and document structure, often using deeper LaTeX
           macros to achieve their ends.  Although the  omission  will  lead  to  other  errors  (missing  macro
           definitions),  it  is  unlikely that processing the TeX code in the style file will lead to a correct
           document.

       "--path"=<u>dir</u>
           Add <u>dir</u> to the search paths used when searching for files, modules, style files, etc;  somewhat  like
           TEXINPUTS.  This option can be repeated.

       "--documentid"=<u>id</u>
           Assigns  an ID to the root element of the XML document.  This ID is generally inherited as the prefix
           of ID's on all other elements within the document.  This  is  useful  when  constructing  a  site  of
           multiple documents so that all nodes have unique IDs.

       "--quiet"
           Reduces the verbosity of output during processing, used twice is pretty silent.

       "--verbose"
           Increases  the verbosity of output during processing, used twice is pretty chatty.  Can be useful for
           getting more details when errors occur.

       "--strict"
           Specifies a strict processing mode. By default, undefined  control  sequences  and  invalid  document
           constructs  (that  violate the DTD) give warning messages, but attempt to continue processing.  Using
           --strict makes them generate fatal errors.

       "--inputencoding="<u>encoding</u>
           Specify the input encoding, eg. "--inputencoding=iso-8859-1".  The encoding  must  be  one  known  to
           Perl's  Encode package.  Note that this only enables the translation of the input bytes to UTF-8 used
           internally by LaTeXML, but does not affect catcodes.  It is usually better to  use  LaTeX's  inputenc
           package.  Note that this does not affect the output encoding, which is always UTF-8.

       "--VERSION"
           Shows the version number of the LaTeXML package..

       "--debug"=<u>package</u>
           Enables debugging output for the named package. The package is given without the leading LaTeXML::.

       "--help"
           Shows this help message.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       This  program  runs  much  slower  than  would  seem  justified.  This is a result of the relatively slow
       initialization including loading TeX and LaTeX macros and the  schema.   Normally,  this  cost  would  be
       ammortized over large documents, whereas, in this case, we're processing a single math expression.
