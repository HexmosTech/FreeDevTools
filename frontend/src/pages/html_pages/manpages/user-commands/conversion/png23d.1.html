</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>png23d</u> is a tool which converts a PNG  image  into  a  three  dimensional  file  suitable  for  modelling
       applications especially for 3D printers.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-V</b>     Display the program version and exit.

       <b>-v</b>     Make the program produce verbose output.

       <b>-t</b>     The  colour  which  is  used  for  transparent  output. Valid range is 0 to 255(default) or 'x' to
              disable.

       <b>-l</b>     The number of levels into which the colour-space is divided. Valid range  is  1(default)  to  256.
              Note  that  as of version 1.0 not all output generators obey this parameter or may use a different
              finish type to that specified if the parameter is not 1.

       <b>-w</b>     The output target width (x dimension). The source PNG width is used by default.

       <b>-h</b>     The output target height (y dimension). Note most outputs will simply ignore  this  parameter  and
              retain the original image aspect ratio based on the width parameter.

       <b>-d</b>     The output target depth (z dimension) The number of levels specified is used as the default.

       <b>-o</b>     Specifies the output type
              pgm     Output  a  PGM  format  bitmap.  This  can  be  used  to verify the level and quantisation
                      parameters are set correctly.
              rscad   Output a scad format file for use with <b>OpenSCAD</b>.  This file will be comprised of  a  union
                      of cubes. The finish cannot be controlled (it is raw blocks) and the resulting scad object
                      may be very complex.
              scad    Output  a scad format file for use with <b>OpenSCAD</b>.  This file will be comprised of a single
                      polyhedron mesh.  For larger images this polygon will be  exceptionally  complex  and  may
                      contain many thousands of triangles.
              stl     Output  a  binary  stereolithography  format  file.   These  files are comprised of simple
                      triangles, the output can be directly used by several 3D printing systems.  The  generated
                      meshes are a convex manifold but are not simplified.
              astl    Same as the stl entry but generates a textural file instead of binary.

       <b>-f</b>     Specifies  the  finish  out the output 3D mesh the default is <b>cube</b> which keeps all the cube faces.
              The <b>smooth</b> option uses a marching square algotithm to gives sloped edges and reduces jaggies.  The
              <b>rect</b>  finish  is  for  the  rscad  output type only. The <b>surface</b> type generates a simple heightmap
              surface.

       <b>-O</b>     Specify the mesh optimisation level of 0, 1(the default) or 2.
              0   No mesh optimisation will be performed. This will be fast to execute but  the  resulting  mesh
                  will  be  exceptionally  complex  and  will  almost certainly require additional processing in
                  another tool such as meshlab.
              1   Mesh simplification using edge removal algorithm will be performed. This process is relatively
                  fast and the result maintains the exact blocky geometry from the generation process. Typically
                  this produces reasonable results for non complex extrusions.
              2   Mesh simplification using quadratic surface removal. This has not yet been implemented! Use  a
                  tool such as meshlab if you require this type of simplification.

       <b>-b</b>     The   bloom   filter   complexity   which   controls   the  size  of  the  filter  and  number  of
              iterations(functions) used by vertex indexing as part of the mesh  simplification  process.  Valid
              range  is  0  to 16 with a default of 2. Most users will never need to alter this parameter. It is
              useful only if they are experiencing a high filter miss rate on exceptionally large meshes with 10
              million facets or more).

       <b>-m</b>     The filename to save the mesh optimisation debug output to. This is a generated  html  file  which
              graphically  shows  each  stage  of  the  mesh  simplification.  This is useful only for debugging
              purposes and for images above a few hundred  facets  the  output  can  run  to  many  hundreds  of
              megabytes.

       <b>input</b>  Specifies the source PNG file to convert from.

       <b>output</b> Specifies the output file.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       To convert from <u>foo.png</u> to <u>foo.scad</u> in scad polyhedron output format:

              png23d -o pscad foo.png foo.scad

       To convert from <u>foo.png</u> to <u>foo.stl</u> in binary STL output format with smooth finish:

              png23d -f smooth -o stl foo.png foo.scad

       To  convert  from  <u>foo.png</u>  to  <u>foo.stl</u>  in ascii STL output format with smooth finish and 50 unit output
       width:

              png23d -f smooth -o astl -w 50 foo.png foo.scad
