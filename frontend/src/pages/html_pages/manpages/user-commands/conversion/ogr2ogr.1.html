</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ogr2ogr</b>  can  be  used  to convert simple features data between file formats. It can also perform various
       operations during the process, such as spatial or attribute selection, reducing the  set  of  attributes,
       setting the output coordinate system or even reprojecting the features during translation.

       <b>--help</b> Show this help message and exit

       <b>--help-general</b>
              Gives a brief usage message for the generic GDAL commandline options and exit.

       <b>-if</b> <b>&lt;format&gt;</b>
              Format/driver  name  to  be  attempted to open the input file(s). It is generally not necessary to
              specify it, but it can be used to skip automatic driver detection, when it  fails  to  select  the
              appropriate  driver.   This  option  can  be  repeated  several times to specify several candidate
              drivers.  Note that it does not force those drivers to  open  the  dataset.  In  particular,  some
              drivers have requirements on file extensions.

              New in version 3.2.

       <b>-of</b> <b>&lt;format_name&gt;,</b> <b>-f</b> <b>&lt;format_name&gt;</b>
              Output  file  format name, e.g. <b>ESRI</b> <b>Shapefile</b>, <b>MapInfo</b> <b>File</b>, <b>PostgreSQL</b>.  Starting with GDAL 2.3,
              if not specified, the format is guessed from the extension (previously was ESRI Shapefile).

       <b>-append</b>
              Append to existing layer instead of creating new. This option also enables <u>-update</u>.

       <b>-upsert</b>
              New in version 3.6.

              Variant of <u>-append</u> where the <u>OGRLayer::UpsertFeature()</u> operation  is  used  to  insert  or  update
              features instead of appending with <u>OGRLayer::CreateFeature()</u>.

              This is currently implemented only in a few drivers: <u>GPKG</u> <u>--</u> <u>GeoPackage</u> <u>vector</u> and <u>MongoDBv3</u>.

              The  upsert  operation  uses  the  FID of the input feature, when it is set and is a "significant"
              (that is the FID column name is not the empty string), as the key to update existing features.  It
              is crucial to make sure that the FID in the source and target layers are consistent.

              For  the GPKG driver, it is also possible to upsert features whose FID is unset or non-significant
              (<u>-unsetFid</u> can be used to ignore the FID from the source feature), when there is a  UNIQUE  column
              that is not the integer primary key.

       <b>-overwrite</b>
              Delete the output layer and recreate it empty

       <b>-update</b>
              Open existing output datasource in update mode rather than trying to create a new one

       <b>-select</b> <b>&lt;field_list&gt;</b>
              Comma-delimited list of fields from input layer to copy to the new layer.

              Starting  with GDAL 3.9, field names with spaces, commas or double-quote should be surrounded with
              a starting and ending double-quote character, and double-quote characters in a field  name  should
              be escaped with backslash.

              Depending  on  the  shell  used,  this  might  require  further  quoting.  For  example, to select
              <b>regular_field</b>, <b>a_field_with</b> <b>space,</b> <b>and</b> <b>comma</b> and <b>a</b> <b>field</b> <b>with</b> <b>"</b> <b>double</b> <b>quote</b> with a Unix shell:

                 -select "regular_field,\"a_field_with space, and comma\",\"a field with \\\" double quote\""

              A field is only selected once, even if mentioned several times in the list and if the input  layer
              has duplicate field names.

              Geometry fields can also be specified in the list.

              All  fields are selected when -select is not specified. Specifying the empty string can be used to
              disable selecting any attribute field, and only keep geometries.

              Note this setting cannot be used together with <b>-append</b>. To control the selection  of  fields  when
              appending to a layer, use <b>-fieldmap</b> or <b>-sql</b>.

       <b>-progress</b>
              Display progress on terminal. Only works if input layers have the "fast feature count" capability.

       <b>-sql</b> <b>&lt;sql_statement&gt;|@&lt;filename&gt;</b>
              SQL  statement  to  execute.  The resulting table/layer will be saved to the output. Starting with
              GDAL 2.1, the <b>@filename</b> syntax can be used  to  indicate  that  the  content  is  in  the  pointed
              filename. (Cannot be used with <u>-spat_srs</u>.)

       <b>-dialect</b> <b>&lt;dialect&gt;</b>
              SQL  dialect.  In  some  cases can be used to use the (unoptimized) <u>OGR</u> <u>SQL</u> <u>dialect</u> instead of the
              native SQL of an RDBMS by passing the <b>OGRSQL</b> dialect value.  The <u>SQL</u> <u>SQLite</u> <u>dialect</u> dialect can be
              chosen with the <b>SQLITE</b> and  <b>INDIRECT_SQLITE</b>  dialect  values,  and  this  can  be  used  with  any
              datasource.

       <b>-where</b> <b>&lt;restricted_where&gt;</b>
              Attribute  query  (like  SQL  WHERE).  Starting with GDAL 2.1, the <b>@filename</b> syntax can be used to
              indicate that the content is in the pointed filename.

       <b>-skipfailures</b>
              Continue after a failure, skipping the failed feature.

       <b>-spat</b> <b>&lt;xmin&gt;</b> <b>&lt;ymin&gt;</b> <b>&lt;xmax&gt;</b> <b>&lt;ymax&gt;</b>
              spatial query extents, in the SRS of the source layer(s) (or the one  specified  with  <b>-spat_srs</b>).
              Only  features  whose geometry intersects the extents will be selected. The geometries will not be
              clipped unless <b>-clipsrc</b> is specified.

       <b>-spat_srs</b> <b>&lt;srs_def&gt;</b>
              Override spatial filter SRS. (Cannot be used with <u>-sql</u>.)

       <b>-geomfield</b> <b>&lt;field&gt;</b>
              Name of the geometry field on which the spatial filter operates on.

       <b>-dsco</b> <b>&lt;NAME&gt;=&lt;VALUE&gt;</b>
              Dataset creation option (format specific)

       <b>-lco</b> <b>&lt;NAME&gt;=&lt;VALUE&gt;</b>
              Layer creation option (format specific)

       <b>-nln</b> <b>&lt;name&gt;</b>
              Assign an alternate name to the new layer

       <b>-nlt</b> <b>&lt;type&gt;</b>
              Define the geometry type for the created layer. One of <b>NONE</b>, <b>GEOMETRY</b>, <b>POINT</b>, <b>LINESTRING</b>, <b>POLYGON</b>,
              <b>GEOMETRYCOLLECTION</b>,  <b>MULTIPOINT</b>,  <b>MULTIPOLYGON</b>,  <b>MULTILINESTRING</b>,  <b>CIRCULARSTRING</b>,  <b>COMPOUNDCURVE</b>,
              <b>CURVEPOLYGON</b>,  <b>MULTICURVE</b>, and <b>MULTISURFACE</b> non-linear geometry types. Add <b>Z</b>, <b>M</b>, or <b>ZM</b> to the type
              name to specify coordinates with elevation, measure, or elevation  and  measure.  <b>PROMOTE_TO_MULTI</b>
              can  be  used  to automatically promote layers that mix polygon or multipolygons to multipolygons,
              and layers that mix linestrings or  multilinestrings  to  multilinestrings.  Can  be  useful  when
              converting  shapefiles  to  PostGIS  and  other  target  drivers  that implement strict checks for
              geometry types.  <b>CONVERT_TO_LINEAR</b> can be used to to convert non-linear geometry types into linear
              geometry types by approximating them, and <b>CONVERT_TO_CURVE</b> to promote a  non-linear  type  to  its
              generalized  curve  type  (<b>POLYGON</b>  to  <b>CURVEPOLYGON</b>,  <b>MULTIPOLYGON</b> to <b>MULTISURFACE</b>, <b>LINESTRING</b> to
              <b>COMPOUNDCURVE</b>, <b>MULTILINESTRING</b> to <b>MULTICURVE</b>). Starting with version 2.1 the type can  be  defined
              as  measured  ("25D"  remains  as  an  alias for single "Z"). Some forced geometry conversions may
              result in invalid geometries, for example when forcing conversion of multi-part multipolygons with
              <b>-nlt</b> <b>POLYGON</b>, the resulting polygon will break the Simple Features rules.

              Starting  with  GDAL  3.0.5,  <b>-nlt</b>  <b>CONVERT_TO_LINEAR</b>  and  <b>-nlt</b>  <b>PROMOTE_TO_MULTI</b>  can  be   used
              simultaneously.

       <b>-dim</b> <b>&lt;val&gt;</b>
              Force  the  coordinate  dimension  to val (valid values are <b>XY</b>, <b>XYZ</b>, <b>XYM</b>, and <b>XYZM</b> - for backwards
              compatibility <b>2</b> is an alias for <b>XY</b> and <b>3</b> is an  alias  for  <b>XYZ</b>).  This  affects  both  the  layer
              geometry  type,  and  feature  geometries.  The  value can be set to <b>layer_dim</b> to instruct feature
              geometries to be promoted to the coordinate dimension declared by the layer.  Support  for  M  was
              added in GDAL 2.1.

       <b>-a_srs</b> <b>&lt;srs_def&gt;</b>
              Assign an output SRS, but without reprojecting (use <u>-t_srs</u> to reproject)

              The   coordinate   reference   systems   that   can  be  passed  are  anything  supported  by  the
              <u>OGRSpatialReference::SetFromUserInput()</u>  call,  which  includes  EPSG  Projected,  Geographic   or
              Compound CRS (i.e. EPSG:4296), a well known text (WKT) CRS definition, PROJ.4 declarations, or the
              name of a .prj file containing a WKT CRS definition.

       <b>-a_coord_epoch</b> <b>&lt;epoch&gt;</b>
              New in version 3.4.

              Assign  a  coordinate  epoch,  linked with the output SRS. Useful when the output SRS is a dynamic
              CRS. Only taken into account if <u>-a_srs</u> is used.

       <b>-t_srs</b> <b>&lt;srs_def&gt;</b>
              Reproject/transform to this SRS on output, and assign it as output SRS.

              A source SRS must be available for reprojection to occur. The source SRS will be  by  default  the
              one found in the source layer when it is available, or as overridden by the user with <u>-s_srs</u>

              The   coordinate   reference   systems   that   can  be  passed  are  anything  supported  by  the
              <u>OGRSpatialReference::SetFromUserInput()</u>  call,  which  includes  EPSG  Projected,  Geographic   or
              Compound CRS (i.e. EPSG:4296), a well known text (WKT) CRS definition, PROJ.4 declarations, or the
              name of a .prj file containing a WKT CRS definition.

       <b>-t_coord_epoch</b> <b>&lt;epoch&gt;</b>
              New in version 3.4.

              Assign  a  coordinate  epoch,  linked with the output SRS. Useful when the output SRS is a dynamic
              CRS.  Only  taken  into  account  if  <u>-t_srs</u>  is  used.  It  is  also  mutually   exclusive   with
              <u>-a_coord_epoch</u>.

              Before PROJ 9.4, <u>-s_coord_epoch</u> and <u>-t_coord_epoch</u> were mutually exclusive, due to lack of support
              for transformations between two dynamic CRS.

       <b>-s_srs</b> <b>&lt;srs_def&gt;</b>
              Override  source  SRS. If not specified the SRS found in the input layer will be used. This option
              has only an effect if used together with <u>-t_srs</u> to reproject.

              The  coordinate  reference  systems  that  can  be  passed   are   anything   supported   by   the
              <u>OGRSpatialReference::SetFromUserInput()</u>   call,  which  includes  EPSG  Projected,  Geographic  or
              Compound CRS (i.e. EPSG:4296), a well known text (WKT) CRS definition, PROJ.4 declarations, or the
              name of a .prj file containing a WKT CRS definition.

       <b>-xyRes</b> <b>"&lt;val&gt;[</b> <b>m|mm|deg]"</b>
              New in version 3.9.

              Set/override the geometry X/Y coordinate resolution. If only a numeric value is specified,  it  is
              assumed  to  be  expressed  in  the  units  of  the  target SRS.  The m, mm or deg suffixes can be
              specified to indicate that the value must be interpreted as being in meter, millimeter or degree.

              When specifying this option, the <u>OGRGeometry::SetPrecision()</u> method is run on geometries (that are
              not curves) before passing them to the output driver, to avoid generating invalid  geometries  due
              to the potentially reduced precision (unless the <u>OGR_APPLY_GEOM_SET_PRECISION</u> configuration option
              is set to <b>NO</b>)

              If  neither  this  option nor <u>-unsetCoordPrecision</u> are specified, the coordinate resolution of the
              source layer, if available, is used.

       <b>-zRes</b> <b>"&lt;val&gt;[</b> <b>m|mm]"</b>
              New in version 3.9.

              Set/override the geometry Z coordinate resolution. If only a numeric value  is  specified,  it  is
              assumed  to be expressed in the units of the target SRS.  The m or mm suffixes can be specified to
              indicate that the value must be interpreted as being in meter  or  millimeter.   If  neither  this
              option  nor  <u>-unsetCoordPrecision</u> are specified, the coordinate resolution of the source layer, if
              available, is used.

       <b>-mRes</b> <b>&lt;val&gt;</b>
              New in version 3.9.

              Set/override   the   geometry   M   coordinate   resolution.    If   neither   this   option   nor
              <u>-unsetCoordPrecision</u>  are  specified, the coordinate resolution of the source layer, if available,
              is used.

       <b>-unsetCoordPrecision</b>
              New in version 3.9.

              Prevent the geometry coordinate resolution from being set on target layer(s).

       <b>-s_coord_epoch</b> <b>&lt;epoch&gt;</b>
              New in version 3.4.

              Assign a coordinate epoch, linked with the source SRS. Useful when the source  SRS  is  a  dynamic
              CRS. Only taken into account if <u>-s_srs</u> is used.

              Before PROJ 9.4, <u>-s_coord_epoch</u> and <u>-t_coord_epoch</u> were mutually exclusive, due to lack of support
              for transformations between two dynamic CRS.

       <b>-ct</b> <b>&lt;string&gt;</b>
              A PROJ string (single step operation or multiple step string starting with +proj=pipeline), a WKT2
              string  describing  a  CoordinateOperation,  or  a  <u>urn:ogc:def:coordinateOperation:EPSG::XXXX</u> URN
              overriding the default transformation from the source to the target CRS.

              It must take into account the axis order of the source and target CRS, that is typically include a
              <b>step</b>  <b>proj=axisswap</b>  <b>order=2,1</b>  at  the  beginning  of  the  pipeline  if  the  source   CRS   has
              northing/easting  axis  order,  and/or  at  the  end  of  the  pipeline  if  the  target  CRS  has
              northing/easting axis order.

              New in version 3.0.

       <b>-preserve_fid</b>
              Use the FID of the source features instead of letting the output driver automatically assign a new
              one (for formats that require a FID). If not in append mode, this behavior is the default  if  the
              output  driver  has  a  FID layer creation option, in which case the name of the source FID column
              will be used and source feature IDs will be attempted  to  be  preserved.  This  behavior  can  be
              disabled by setting <b>-unsetFid</b>.  This option is not compatible with <b>-explodecollections</b>.

       <b>-fid</b> <b>&lt;fid&gt;</b>
              If provided, only the feature with the specified feature id will be processed.  Operates exclusive
              of  the  spatial or attribute queries. Note: if you want to select several features based on their
              feature id, you can also use the fact the 'fid' is a special field  recognized  by  OGR  SQL.  So,
              <u>-where</u> <u>"fid</u> <u>in</u> <u>(1,3,5)"</u> would select features 1, 3 and 5.

       <b>-limit</b> <b>&lt;nb_features&gt;</b>
              Limit the number of features per layer.

       <b>-oo</b> <b>&lt;NAME&gt;=&lt;VALUE&gt;</b>
              Input dataset open option (format specific).

       <b>-doo</b> <b>&lt;NAME&gt;=&lt;VALUE&gt;</b>
              Destination dataset open option (format specific), only valid in -update mode.

       <b>-gt</b> <b>&lt;n&gt;</b>
              Group n features per transaction (default 100 000). Increase the value for better performance when
              writing  into  DBMS  drivers  that have transaction support. <b>n</b> can be set to unlimited to load the
              data into a single transaction.

       <b>-ds_transaction</b>
              Force the use of a dataset level transaction (for drivers that support such mechanism), especially
              for drivers such as FileGDB that only support dataset level transaction in emulation mode.

       <b>-clipsrc</b> <b>[&lt;xmin&gt;</b> <b>&lt;ymin&gt;</b> <b>&lt;xmax&gt;</b> <b>&lt;ymax&gt;]|WKT|&lt;datasource&gt;|spat_extent</b>
              Clip geometries (before potential reprojection) to one of the following:

              • the specified bounding box (expressed in source SRS)

              • a WKT geometry (POLYGON or MULTIPOLYGON expressed in source SRS)

              • one or more geometries selected from a datasource

              • the spatial extent of the -spat option if you use the spat_extent keyword.

              When specifying a datasource, you will generally want  to  use  -clipsrc  in  combination  of  the
              -clipsrclayer, -clipsrcwhere or -clipsrcsql options.

       <b>-clipsrcsql</b> <b>&lt;sql_statement&gt;</b>
              Select desired geometries from the source clip datasource using an SQL query.

       <b>-clipsrclayer</b> <b>&lt;layername&gt;</b>
              Select the named layer from the source clip datasource.

       <b>-clipsrcwhere</b> <b>&lt;expression&gt;</b>
              Restrict desired geometries from the source clip layer based on an attribute query.

       <b>-clipdst</b> <b>[&lt;xmin&gt;</b> <b>&lt;ymin&gt;</b> <b>&lt;xmax&gt;</b> <b>&lt;ymax&gt;]|&lt;WKT&gt;|&lt;datasource&gt;</b>
              Clip geometries (after potential reprojection) to one of the following:

              • the specified bounding box (expressed in destination SRS)

              • a WKT geometry (POLYGON or MULTIPOLYGON expressed in destination SRS)

              • one or more geometries selected from a datasource

              When  specifying  a  datasource,  you  will generally want to use -clipdst in combination with the
              -clipdstlayer, -clipdstwhere or -clipdstsql options.

       <b>-clipdstsql</b> <b>&lt;sql_statement&gt;</b>
              Select desired geometries from the destination clip datasource using an SQL query.

       <b>-clipdstlayer</b> <b>&lt;layername&gt;</b>
              Select the named layer from the destination clip datasource.

       <b>-clipdstwhere</b> <b>&lt;expression&gt;</b>
              Restrict desired geometries from the destination clip layer based on an attribute query.

       <b>-wrapdateline</b>
              Split geometries crossing the dateline meridian (long. = +/- 180deg)

       <b>-datelineoffset</b>
              Offset from dateline in degrees (default long. = +/- 10deg, geometries within  170deg  to  -170deg
              will be split)

       <b>-simplify</b> <b>&lt;tolerance&gt;</b>
              Distance tolerance for simplification. Note: the algorithm used preserves topology per feature, in
              particular for polygon geometries, but not for a whole layer.

              The specified value of this option is the tolerance used to merge consecutive points of the output
              geometry  using  the  <u>OGRGeometry::Simplify()</u>  method The unit of the distance is in georeferenced
              units of the source vector dataset.  This option is applied before  the  reprojection  implied  by
              <u>-t_srs</u>

       <b>-segmentize</b> <b>&lt;max_dist&gt;</b>
              The  specified  value of this option is the maximum distance between two consecutive points of the
              output geometry before intermediate points are added.  The unit of the distance  is  georeferenced
              units of the source raster.  This option is applied before the reprojection implied by <u>-t_srs</u>

       <b>-makevalid</b>
              Run          the          <u>OGRGeometry::MakeValid()</u>          operation,         followed         by
              <u>OGRGeometryFactory::removeLowerDimensionSubGeoms()</u>,  on  geometries  to  ensure  they  are   valid
              regarding the rules of the Simple Features specification.

       <b>-skipinvalid</b>
              Run  the  <u>OGRGeometry::IsValid()</u>  operation on geometries to check if they are valid regarding the
              rules of the Simple Features specification.  If they are not, the feature is skipped.  This  check
              is done after all other geometry operations.

       <b>-fieldTypeToString</b> <b>All|&lt;type1&gt;[,&lt;type2&gt;]...</b>
              Converts any field of the specified type to a field of type string in the destination layer. Valid
              types  are  :  <b>Integer</b>,  <b>Integer64</b>,  <b>Real</b>,  <b>String</b>,  <b>Date</b>,  <b>Time</b>,  <b>DateTime</b>,  <b>Binary</b>, <b>IntegerList</b>,
              <b>Integer64List</b>, <b>RealList</b>, <b>StringList</b>. Special value <b>All</b> can  be  used  to  convert  all  fields  to
              strings.   This is an alternate way to using the CAST operator of OGR SQL, that may avoid typing a
              long SQL query. Note that this does not influence the field types used by the source  driver,  and
              is  only  an afterwards conversion.  Also note that this option is without effects on fields whose
              presence and type is hard-coded in the output driver (e.g KML, GPX)

       <b>-mapFieldType</b> <b>{&lt;srctype&gt;|All=&lt;dsttype&gt;[,&lt;srctype2&gt;=&lt;dsttype2&gt;]...}</b>
              Converts any field of the specified type to another type. Valid types are  :  <b>Integer</b>,  <b>Integer64</b>,
              <b>Real</b>,  <b>String</b>,  <b>Date</b>,  <b>Time</b>,  <b>DateTime</b>,  <b>Binary</b>, <b>IntegerList</b>, <b>Integer64List</b>, <b>RealList</b>, <b>StringList</b>.
              Types can also include subtype between parenthesis, such as <b>Integer(Boolean)</b>,  <b>Real(Float32)</b>,  ...
              Special  value  <b>All</b> can be used to convert all fields to another type. This is an alternate way to
              using the CAST operator of  OGR  SQL,  that  may  avoid  typing  a  long  SQL  query.  This  is  a
              generalization  of  -fieldTypeToString.  Note that this does not influence the field types used by
              the source driver, and is only an afterwards conversion.  Also note that this  option  is  without
              effects on fields whose presence and type is hard-coded in the output driver (e.g KML, GPX)

       <b>-dateTimeTo</b> <b>{UTC|UTC(+|-)&lt;HH&gt;|UTC(+|-)&lt;HH&gt;:&lt;MM&gt;}</b>
              Converts  date  time values from the timezone specified in the source value to the target timezone
              expressed with <u>-dateTimeTo</u>.  Datetime whose timezone is unknown or localtime are not modified.

              HH must be in the [0,14] range and MM=00, 15, 30 or 45.

       <b>-unsetFieldWidth</b>
              Set field width and precision to 0.

       <b>-splitlistfields</b>
              Split fields of type StringList, RealList or IntegerList into as many fields of type String,  Real
              or Integer as necessary.

       <b>-maxsubfields</b> <b>&lt;val&gt;</b>
              To  be  combined  with  <b>-splitlistfields</b>  to  limit the number of subfields created for each split
              field.

       <b>-explodecollections</b>
              Produce one feature for each geometry in any kind of  geometry  collection  in  the  source  file,
              applied  after any <b>-sql</b> option. This options is not compatible with <b>-preserve_fid</b> but <b>-sql</b> <b>"SELECT</b>
              <b>fid</b> <b>AS</b> <b>original_fid,</b> <b>*</b> <b>FROM</b> <b>..."</b> can be used to store the original FID if needed.

       <b>-zfield</b> <b>&lt;field_name&gt;</b>
              Uses the specified field to fill the Z coordinate of geometries.

       <b>-gcp</b> <b>&lt;ungeoref_x&gt;</b> <b>&lt;ungeoref_y&gt;</b> <b>&lt;georef_x&gt;</b> <b>&lt;georef_y&gt;</b> <b>[&lt;elevation&gt;]</b>
              Use the indicated ground control point to compute a coordinate transformation.  The transformation
              method can be selected by specifying the <u>-order</u> or <u>-tps</u> options.  Note that  unlike  raster  tools
              such as gdal_edit or gdal_translate, GCPs are not added to the output dataset.  This option may be
              provided multiple times to provide a set of GCPs (at least 2 GCPs are needed).

       <b>-order</b> <b>&lt;n&gt;</b>
              Order  of  polynomial used for warping (1 to 3). The default is to select a polynomial order based
              on the number of GCPs.

       <b>-tps</b>   Force use of thin plate spline transformer based on available GCPs.

       <b>-fieldmap</b>
              Specifies the list of field indexes to be copied from the source to  the  destination.  The  (n)th
              value  specified in the list is the index of the field in the target layer definition in which the
              n(th) field of the source layer must be copied. Index count starts  at  zero.  To  omit  a  field,
              specify a value of -1. There must be exactly as many values in the list as the count of the fields
              in  the  source  layer.  We  can  use  the 'identity' setting to specify that the fields should be
              transferred by using the same order.  This setting should be used along with the <b>-append</b> setting.

       <b>-addfields</b>
              This is a specialized version of <b>-append</b>. Contrary  to  <b>-append</b>,  <b>-addfields</b>  has  the  effect  of
              adding,  to  existing  target layers, the new fields found in source layers. This option is useful
              when merging files that have non-strictly identical structures. This might  not  work  for  output
              formats  that  don't  support adding fields to existing non-empty layers. Note that if you plan to
              use -addfields, you may need to combine it with -forceNullable, including for the initial import.

       <b>-relaxedFieldNameMatch</b>
              Do field name matching between source and existing target layer in  a  more  relaxed  way  if  the
              target driver has an implementation for it.

       <b>-forceNullable</b>
              Do not propagate not-nullable constraints to target layer if they exist in source layer.

       <b>-unsetDefault</b>
              Do not propagate default field values to target layer if they exist in source layer.

       <b>-unsetFid</b>
              Can  be  specified  to prevent the name of the source FID column and source feature IDs from being
              re-used for the target layer. This option can for example be useful if selecting  source  features
              with a ORDER BY clause.

       <b>-emptyStrAsNull</b>
              New in version 3.3.

              Treat empty string values as null.

       <b>-resolveDomains</b>
              New in version 3.3.

              When  this  is  specified,  any  selected  field  that  is  linked to a coded field domain will be
              accompanied by an additional field (<b>{dstfield}_resolved</b>), that will contain the description of the
              coded value.

       <b>-nomd</b>  To disable copying of metadata from source dataset and layers into target dataset and layers, when
              supported by output driver.

       <b>-mo</b> <b>&lt;META-TAG&gt;=&lt;VALUE&gt;</b>
              Passes a metadata key and value to set on the output dataset, when supported by output driver.

       <b>-noNativeData</b>
              To disable copying of native data, i.e. details of source format not captured by OGR  abstraction,
              that are otherwise preserved by some drivers (like GeoJSON) when converting to same format.

              New in version 2.1.

       <b>&lt;dst_dataset_name&gt;</b>
              Output dataset name.

       <b>&lt;src_dataset_name&gt;</b>
              Source dataset name.

       <b>&lt;layer_name&gt;</b>
              One  or  more source layer names to copy to the output dataset. If no layer names are passed, then
              all source layers are copied.

</pre><h4><b>PERFORMANCE</b> <b>HINTS</b></h4><pre>
       When writing into transactional  DBMS  (SQLite/PostgreSQL,MySQL,  etc...),  it  might  be  beneficial  to
       increase  the  number  of  INSERT  statements  executed  between BEGIN TRANSACTION and COMMIT TRANSACTION
       statements. This number is specified with the -gt option. For example, for  SQLite,  explicitly  defining
       -gt  65536  ensures optimal performance while populating some table containing many hundreds of thousands
       or millions of rows. However, note that -skipfailures overrides -gt and sets the size of transactions  to
       1.

       For  PostgreSQL,  the <u>PG_USE_COPY</u> config option can be set to YES for a significant insertion performance
       boost. See the PG driver documentation page.

       More generally, consult the documentation page of the input and output drivers for performance hints.

</pre><h4><b>KNOWN</b> <b>ISSUES</b></h4><pre>
       Starting with GDAL 3.8, ogr2ogr uses internally an Arrow array based API (cf <u>RFC</u> <u>86:</u> <u>Column-oriented</u> <u>read</u>
       <u>API</u> <u>for</u> <u>vector</u> <u>layers</u>) for some source formats (in particular GeoPackage or FlatGeoBuf), and for the most
       basic types of operations, to improve performance.  This substantial change in the ogr2ogr internal logic
       has required a number of fixes throughout the GDAL 3.8.x bugfix releases to fully stabilize  it,  and  we
       believe  most  issues  are resolved with GDAL 3.9.  If you hit errors not met with earlier GDAL versions,
       you may specify <b>--config</b> <b>OGR2OGR_USE_ARROW_API</b> <b>NO</b> on the ogr2ogr command line  to  opt  for  the  classic
       algorithm using an iterative feature based approach. If that flag is needed with GDAL &gt;= 3.9, please file
       an issue on the <u>GDAL</u> <u>issue</u> <u>tracker</u>.

</pre><h4><b>C</b> <b>API</b></h4><pre>
       This utility is also callable from C with <u>GDALVectorTranslate()</u>.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       • Basic conversion from Shapefile to GeoPackage:

                ogr2ogr output.gpkg input.shp

       • Change the coordinate reference system from <b>EPSG:4326</b> to <b>EPSG:3857</b>:

                ogr2ogr -s_srs EPSG:4326 -t_srs EPSG:3857 output.gpkg input.gpkg

       • Example appending to an existing layer:

                ogr2ogr -append -f PostgreSQL PG:dbname=warmerda abc.tab

       • Clip input layer with a bounding box (&lt;xmin&gt; &lt;ymin&gt; &lt;xmax&gt; &lt;ymax&gt;):

                ogr2ogr -spat -13.931 34.886 46.23 74.12 output.gpkg natural_earth_vector.gpkg

       • Filter Features by a <b>-where</b> clause:

                ogr2ogr -where "\"POP_EST\" &lt; 1000000" \
                  output.gpkg natural_earth_vector.gpkg ne_10m_admin_0_countries

       More examples are given in the individual format pages.

</pre><h4><b>ADVANCED</b> <b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       • Reprojecting from ETRS_1989_LAEA_52N_10E to EPSG:4326 and clipping to a bounding box:

                ogr2ogr -wrapdateline -t_srs EPSG:4326 -clipdst -5 40 15 55 france_4326.shp europe_laea.shp

       • Using the <b>-fieldmap</b> setting. The first field of the source layer is used to fill the third field (index
         2  = third field) of the target layer, the second field of the source layer is ignored, the third field
         of the source layer used to fill the fifth field of the target layer.

                ogr2ogr -append -fieldmap 2,-1,4 dst.shp src.shp

       • Outputting geometries with the CSV driver.

         By default, this driver does not preserve geometries on layer creation by default.  An  explicit  layer
         creation option is needed:

                ogr2ogr -lco GEOMETRY=AS_XYZ TrackWaypoint.csv TrackWaypoint.kml

       • Extracting only geometries.

         There are different situations, depending if the input layer has a named geometry column, or not. First
         check, with ogrinfo if there is a reported geometry column.

                ogrinfo -so CadNSDI.gdb.zip PLSSPoint | grep 'Geometry Column'
                Geometry Column = SHAPE

         In  that  situation  where  the  input  format is a FileGeodatabase, it is called SHAPE and can thus be
         referenced directly in a SELECT statement.

                ogr2ogr -sql "SELECT SHAPE FROM PLSSPoint" \
                  -lco GEOMETRY=AS_XY -f CSV /vsistdout/ CadNSDI.gdb.zip

         For a shapefile with a unnamed geometry column, <b>_ogr_geometry_</b>  can  be  used  as  a  special  name  to
         designate the implicit geometry column, when using the default <u>OGR</u> <u>SQL</u> dialect. The name begins with an
         underscore  and SQL syntax requires that it must appear between double quotes.  In addition the command
         line interpreter may require that double quotes are escaped and the final SELECT statement  could  look
         like:

                ogr2ogr -sql "SELECT \"_ogr_geometry_\" FROM PLSSPoint" \
                  -lco GEOMETRY=AS_XY -f CSV /vsistdout/ CadNSDI.shp

         If  using the <u>SQL</u> <u>SQLite</u> dialect, the special geometry name is <b>geometry</b> when the source geometry column
         has no name.

                ogr2ogr -sql "SELECT geometry FROM PLSSPoint" -dialect SQLite \
                  -lco GEOMETRY=AS_XY -f CSV /vsistdout/ CadNSDI.shp
