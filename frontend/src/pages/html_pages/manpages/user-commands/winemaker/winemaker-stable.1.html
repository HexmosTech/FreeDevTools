</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>winemaker</b>  is a perl script designed to help you bootstrap the process of converting your Windows sources
       to Winelib programs.

       In order to do this <b>winemaker</b> can perform the following operations:

       - rename your source files and directories to lowercase in the event they got all uppercased  during  the
       transfer.

       - perform DOS to Unix (CRLF to LF) conversions.

       -  scan  the  include  statements  and  resource  file references to replace the backslashes with forward
       slashes.

       - during the above step <b>winemaker</b> will also perform a case insensitive search of the referenced  file  in
       the include path and rewrite the include statement with the right case if necessary.

       -  <b>winemaker</b> will also check other more exotic issues like <u>#pragma</u> <u>pack</u> usage, use of <u>afxres.h</u> in non MFC
       projects, and more. Whenever it encounters something out of the ordinary, it will warn you about it.

       - <b>winemaker</b> can also scan a complete directory tree at once, guess what are the executables and libraries
       you are trying to build, match them with source files, and generate the corresponding <u>Makefile</u>.

       - finally <b>winemaker</b> will generate a global <u>Makefile</u> for normal use.

       - <b>winemaker</b> knows about MFC-based project and will generate customized files.

       - <b>winemaker</b> can read existing project files. It supports dsp, dsw, vcproj and sln files.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--nobanner</b>
              Disable the printing of the banner.

       <b>--backup</b>
              Perform a backup of all the modified source files. This is the default.

       <b>--nobackup</b>
              Do not backup modified source files.

       <b>--nosource-fix</b>
              Do no try to fix the source files (e.g. DOS to Unix conversion). This prevents complaints  if  the
              files are readonly.

       <b>--lower-all</b>
              Rename all files and directories to lowercase.

       <b>--lower-uppercase</b>
              Only  rename  files  and directories that have an all uppercase name.  So <u>HELLO.C</u> would be renamed
              but not <u>World.c</u>.

       <b>--lower-none</b>
              Do not rename files and directories to lower case. Note that this does not prevent the renaming of
              a file if its extension cannot be handled as is, e.g. ".Cxx". This is the default.

       <b>--lower-include</b>
              When the file corresponding to an include statement (or other form of file reference for  resource
              files) cannot be found, convert that filename to lowercase. This is the default.

       <b>--nolower-include</b>
              Do not modify the include statement if the referenced file cannot be found.

       <b>--guiexe</b> | <b>--windows</b>
              Assume  a  graphical  application  when an executable target or a target of unknown type is found.
              This is the default.

       <b>--cuiexe</b> | <b>--console</b>
              Assume a console application when an executable target or a target of unknown type is found.

       <b>--dll</b>  Assume a dll when a target of unknown type is found, i.e. when <b>winemaker</b> is  unable  to  determine
              whether it is an executable, a dll, or a static library,

       <b>--lib</b>  Assume  a  static library when a target of unknown type is found, i.e. when <b>winemaker</b> is unable to
              determine whether it is an executable, a dll, or a static library,

       <b>--mfc</b>  Specify that the targets are MFC based. In such a case <b>winemaker</b> adapts the  include  and  library
              paths accordingly, and links the target with the MFC library.

       <b>--nomfc</b>
              Specify  that  targets  are  not  MFC-based.  This  option  disables  use of MFC libraries even if
              <b>winemaker</b> encounters files <u>stdafx.cpp</u> or <u>stdafx.h</u> that would cause it to enable MFC  automatically
              if neither <b>--nomfc</b> nor <b>--mfc</b> was specified.

       <b>-D</b><u>macro</u>[<b>=</b><u>defn</u>]
              Add the specified macro definition to the global list of macro definitions.

       <b>-I</b><u>dir</u>  Append the specified directory to the global include path.

       <b>-P</b><u>dir</u>  Append the specified directory to the global dll path.

       <b>-i</b><u>dll</u>  Add the Winelib library to the global list of Winelib libraries to import.

       <b>-L</b><u>dir</u>  Append the specified directory to the global library path.

       <b>-l</b><u>library</u>
              Add the specified library to the global list of libraries to link with.

       <b>--nodlls</b>
              Do  not  use  the  standard set of Winelib libraries for imports.  That is, any DLL your code uses
              must be explicitly passed with  <b>-i</b>  options.   The  standard  set  of  libraries  is:  <u>odbc32.dll</u>,
              <u>odbccp32.dll</u>, <u>ole32.dll</u>, <u>oleaut32.dll</u> and <u>winspool.drv</u>.

       <b>--nomsvcrt</b>
              Set  some options to tell <b>winegcc</b> not to compile against msvcrt.  Use this option if you have cpp-
              files that include <u>&lt;string&gt;</u>.

       <b>--interactive</b>
              Use interactive mode. In this mode <b>winemaker</b> will ask you to confirm the list of targets for  each
              directory, and then to provide directory and target specific options.

       <b>--single-target</b> <u>name</u>
              Specify that there is only one target, called <u>name</u>.

       <b>--generated-files</b>
              Generate the <u>Makefile</u>. This is the default.

       <b>--nogenerated-files</b>
              Do not generate the <u>Makefile</u>.

       <b>--wine32</b>
              Generate  a  32-bit  target.  This  is  useful  on wow64 systems.  Without that option the default
              architecture is used.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Here is a typical <b>winemaker</b> use:

       $ winemaker --lower-uppercase -DSTRICT .

       The above tells <b>winemaker</b> to scan the current directory and its subdirectories for source files. Whenever
       if finds a file or directory which name is all uppercase, it should rename it  to  lowercase.  It  should
       then  fix  all  these  source  files  for  compilation with Winelib and generate <u>Makefile</u>s.  The <b>-DSTRICT</b>
       specifies that the <b>STRICT</b> macro must be set when compiling these sources.  Finally  a  <u>Makefile</u>  will  be
       created.

       The next step would be:

       $ make

       If  at  this point you get compilation errors (which is quite likely for a reasonably sized project) then
       you should consult the Winelib User Guide to find tips on how to resolve them.

       For an MFC-based project you would have to run the following commands instead:

       $ winemaker --lower-uppercase --mfc .
       $ make

       For an existing project-file you would have to run the following commands:

       $ winemaker myproject.dsp
       $ make

</pre><h4><b>TODO</b> <b>/</b> <b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       In some cases you will have to edit the <u>Makefile</u> or source files manually.

       Assuming that the windows executable/library is available, we could use <b>winedump</b> to determine  what  kind
       of  executable  it  is  (graphical or console), which libraries it is linked with, and which functions it
       exports (for libraries). We could then restore all these settings for the corresponding Winelib target.

       Furthermore <b>winemaker</b> is not very good at finding the library containing the executable: it  must  either
       be in the current directory or in the <b>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</b>.

       <b>winemaker</b> does not support message files and the message compiler yet.

       Bugs can be reported on the <b>Wine</b> <b>bug</b> <b>tracker</b>.
