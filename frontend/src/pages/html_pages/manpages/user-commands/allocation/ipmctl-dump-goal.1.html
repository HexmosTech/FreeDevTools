</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       ipmctl-dump-goal - Stores the current configured memory allocation settings to a file

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           ipmctl dump [OPTIONS] -destination (path) -system -config

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Store the currently configured memory allocation settings for all PMem modules in the system to a file in
       order to replicate the configuration elsewhere. Apply the stored memory allocation settings using the
       command Section [Load Memory Allocation Goal].

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       -h, -help
           Displays help for the command.

       -ddrt
           Used to specify DDRT as the desired transport protocol for the current invocation of ipmctl.

       -smbus
           Used to specify SMBUS as the desired transport protocol for the current invocation of ipmctl.

           <b>Note</b>

           The -ddrt and -smbus options are mutually exclusive and may not be used together.

       -lpmb
           Used to specify large transport payload size for the current invocation of ipmctl.

       -spmb
           Used to specify small transport payload size for the current invocation of ipmctl.

           <b>Note</b>

           The -lpmb and -spmb options are mutually exclusive and may not be used together.

       -o (text|nvmxml), -output (text|nvmxml)
           Changes the output format. One of: "text" (default) or "nvmxml".

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Stores the memory allocation settings from all the PMem modules into the file "config.txt".

           ipmctl dump -destination config.txt -system -config

</pre><h4><b>LIMITATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       In order to successfully execute this command:

       •   The caller must have the appropriate privileges.

       •   Only memory allocation settings for manageable PMem modules that have been successfully applied by
           the BIOS are stored in the file. Unconfigured PMem modules are not included, nor are memory
           allocation goals that have not been applied.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>DATA</b></h4><pre>
       The CLI will indicate the overall status of the operation when complete. If a failure occurs when dumping
       the memory allocation from multiple PMem modules, the process will stop and the output file will be
       removed.

       The output file is formatted as an ASCII file with one row per PMem module containing the following comma
       separated values.

       SocketID
           Identifier for the socket the PMem module is associated with.

       DimmHandle
           PMem module device handle.

       Capacity
           Total capacity of the PMem module in GiB.

       MemorySize
           Capacity of the PMem module allocated as Memory Mode in GiB.

       AppDirect1Size
           Capacity of the PMem module allocated for the first App Direct interleave set in GiB.

       AppDirect1Format
           Bit mask representing the interleave format of the first App Direct interleave set.

       AppDirect1Index
           Unique index of the first App Direct interleave set.

       AppDirect2Size
           Capacity of the PMem module allocated for the second App Direct interleave set in GiB.

       AppDirect2Format
           Bit mask representing the interleave format of the second App Direct interleave set.

       AppDirect2Index
           Unique index of the second App Direct interleave set.
