</pre><h4><b>PROLOG</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       talk — talk to another user

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       talk <u>address</u> <b>[</b><u>terminal</u><b>]</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>talk</u> utility is a two-way, screen-oriented communication program.

       When first invoked, <u>talk</u> shall send a message similar to:

           Message from &lt;<u>unspecified</u> <u>string</u>&gt;
           talk: connection requested by <u>your_address</u>
           talk: respond with: talk <u>your_address</u>

       to the specified <u>address</u>.  At this point, the recipient of the message can reply by typing:

           talk <u>your_address</u>

       Once  communication  is established, the two parties can type simultaneously, with their output displayed
       in separate regions of the screen. Characters shall be processed as follows:

        *  Typing the &lt;alert&gt; character shall alert the recipient's terminal.

        *  Typing &lt;control&gt;‐L shall cause the sender's screen regions to be refreshed.

        *  Typing the erase and kill characters shall affect the sender's terminal in the  manner  described  by
           the  <b>termios</b>  interface  in the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <u>Chapter</u> <u>11</u>, <u>General</u> <u>Terminal</u>
           <u>Interface</u>.

        *  Typing the interrupt or end-of-file characters shall terminate the local <u>talk</u> utility. Once the  <u>talk</u>
           session  has  been  terminated on one side, the other side of the <u>talk</u> session shall be notified that
           the <u>talk</u> session has been terminated and shall be able to do nothing except exit.

        *  Typing characters from <u>LC_CTYPE</u> classifications <b>print</b> or <b>space</b> shall cause  those  characters  to  be
           sent to the recipient's terminal.

        *  When  and only when the <u>stty</u> <b>iexten</b> local mode is enabled, the existence and processing of additional
           special control characters and multi-byte or single-byte functions shall be implementation-defined.

        *  Typing other non-printable characters  shall  cause  implementation-defined  sequences  of  printable
           characters to be sent to the recipient's terminal.

       Permission  to  be  a  recipient  of  a <u>talk</u> message can be denied or granted by use of the <u>mesg</u> utility.
       However, a user's privilege may further constrain the domain of accessibility of other users'  terminals.
       The <u>talk</u> utility shall fail when the user lacks appropriate privileges to perform the requested action.

       Certain  block-mode  terminals  do  not  have  all the capabilities necessary to support the simultaneous
       exchange of messages required for <u>talk</u>.   When  this  type  of  exchange  cannot  be  supported  on  such
       terminals,  the implementation may support an exchange with reduced levels of simultaneous interaction or
       it may report an error describing the terminal-related deficiency.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>OPERANDS</b></h4><pre>
       The following operands shall be supported:

       <u>address</u>   The recipient of the <u>talk</u> session. One form of <u>address</u> is the &lt;<u>user</u> <u>name</u>&gt;, as returned  by  the
                 <u>who</u> utility. Other address formats and how they are handled are unspecified.

       <u>terminal</u>  If the recipient is logged in more than once, the <u>terminal</u> argument can be used to indicate the
                 appropriate terminal name. If <u>terminal</u> is not specified, the <u>talk</u> message shall be displayed on
                 one  or  more accessible terminals in use by the recipient. The format of <u>terminal</u> shall be the
                 same as that returned by the <u>who</u> utility.

</pre><h4><b>STDIN</b></h4><pre>
       Characters read from standard input shall be copied to the recipient's terminal in an unspecified manner.
       If standard input is not a terminal, talk shall write a diagnostic  message  and  exit  with  a  non-zero
       status.

</pre><h4><b>INPUT</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of <u>talk</u>:

       <u>LANG</u>      Provide a default value for the internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See the
                 Base  Definitions  volume  of POSIX.1‐2017, <u>Section</u> <u>8.2</u>, <u>Internationalization</u> <u>Variables</u> for the
                 precedence  of  internationalization  variables  used  to  determine  the  values   of   locale
                 categories.)

       <u>LC_ALL</u>    If  set  to a non-empty string value, override the values of all the other internationalization
                 variables.

       <u>LC_CTYPE</u>  Determine the locale for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of text  data  as  characters
                 (for example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments and input files). If
                 the  recipient's  locale  does  not use an <u>LC_CTYPE</u> equivalent to the sender's, the results are
                 undefined.

       <u>LC_MESSAGES</u>
                 Determine the locale that should be used to  affect  the  format  and  contents  of  diagnostic
                 messages written to standard error and informative messages written to standard output.

       <u>NLSPATH</u>   Determine the location of message catalogs for the processing of <u>LC_MESSAGES</u>.

       <u>TERM</u>      Determine  the  name  of  the  invoker's  terminal  type. If this variable is unset or null, an
                 unspecified default terminal type shall be used.

</pre><h4><b>ASYNCHRONOUS</b> <b>EVENTS</b></h4><pre>
       When the <u>talk</u> utility receives a SIGINT signal, the utility shall terminate and exit with a zero  status.
       It shall take the standard action for all other signals.

</pre><h4><b>STDOUT</b></h4><pre>
       If standard output is a terminal, characters copied from the recipient's standard input may be written to
       standard  output.  Standard  output also may be used for diagnostic messages. If standard output is not a
       terminal, <u>talk</u> shall exit with a non-zero status.

</pre><h4><b>STDERR</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>OUTPUT</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>EXTENDED</b> <b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       The following exit values shall be returned:

        0    Successful completion.

       &gt;0    An error occurred or <u>talk</u> was invoked on a terminal incapable of supporting it.

</pre><h4><b>CONSEQUENCES</b> <b>OF</b> <b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       Default.

       <u>The</u> <u>following</u> <u>sections</u> <u>are</u> <u>informative.</u>

</pre><h4><b>APPLICATION</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       Because the handling of non-printable, non-&lt;space&gt; characters is tied to the <u>stty</u> description of  <b>iexten</b>,
       implementation  extensions within the terminal driver can be accessed.  For example, some implementations
       provide line editing functions with certain control character sequences.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>RATIONALE</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>write</u> utility was included in this volume of POSIX.1‐2017 since it can be implemented on all terminal
       types. The <u>talk</u> utility, which cannot be implemented  on  certain  terminals,  was  considered  to  be  a
       ``better''  communications  interface.  Both  of  these  programs  are  in  widespread  use on historical
       implementations.  Therefore, both utilities have been specified.

       All references to networking abilities (<u>talk</u>ing to a user  on  another  system)  were  removed  as  being
       outside the scope of this volume of POSIX.1‐2017.

       Historical  BSD and System V versions of <u>talk</u> terminate both of the conversations when either user breaks
       out of the session. This can lead to adverse consequences if a user unwittingly continues to  enter  text
       that  is  interpreted  by the shell when the other terminates the session. Therefore, the version of <u>talk</u>
       specified by this volume of POSIX.1‐2017 requires both users  to  terminate  their  end  of  the  session
       explicitly.

       Only messages sent to the terminal of the invoking user can be internationalized in any way:

        *  The original ``Message from &lt;<u>unspecified</u> <u>string</u>&gt; ...''  message sent to the terminal of the recipient
           cannot  be  internationalized  because the environment of the recipient is as yet inaccessible to the
           <u>talk</u> utility. The environment of the invoking party is irrelevant.

        *  Subsequent communication between the two parties cannot be internationalized because the two  parties
           may  specify  different  languages in their environment (and non-portable characters cannot be mapped
           from one language to another).

        *  Neither party can be required to communicate in a language other than C and/or the one  specified  by
           their environment because unavailable terminal hardware support (for example, fonts) may be required.

       The  text  in  the  STDOUT  section reflects the usage of the verb ``display'' in this section; some <u>talk</u>
       implementations actually use standard output to write to the terminal, but this  volume  of  POSIX.1‐2017
       does not require that to be the case.

       The  format of the terminal name is unspecified, but the descriptions of <u>ps</u>, <u>talk</u>, <u>who</u>, and <u>write</u> require
       that they all use or accept the same format.

       The handling of non-printable characters is  partially  implementation-defined  because  the  details  of
       mapping  them  to printable sequences is not needed by the user. Historical implementations, for security
       reasons, disallow the transmission of non-printable characters  that  may  send  commands  to  the  other
       terminal.
