</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
                 <b><a href="file:~/.mixxx/">~/.mixxx/</a></b>
                 The directory where mixxx stores its user data.

                 <b><a href="file:~/.mixxx/mixxxdb.sqlite">~/.mixxx/mixxxdb.sqlite</a></b>
                 The mixxx library file.  <u>Warning:</u> Deleting your library will lose all of  your  metadata.  This
                 includes  saved  hotcues,  loops,  comments,  ratings, and other library related metadata. Only
                 delete your library if you are fine with losing these.

                 The directory where mixxx stores any additional analysis data that can't fit into  the  library
                 file.  Currently  only the waveforms are saved here. If you delete your library file you should
                 also delete this folder as the waveforms around 1MB each and are unusable without  the  library
                 that generated them.

                 The  directory where mixxx stores user controller mappings.  All mappings that are created with
                 the MIDI learning wizard are saved here. If there are mappings for a controller in the  default
                 resource directory and this directory mixxx will use the one saved here.

                 <b>/usr/share/mixxx</b>
                 The  directory  where  mixxx  stores  its  default  resources  like  skins, MIDI/HID controller
                 mappings, keyboard mappings, and translations.
