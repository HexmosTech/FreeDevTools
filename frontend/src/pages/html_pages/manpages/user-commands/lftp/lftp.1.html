</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       This man page documents lftp version 4.8.1.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>lftp</b> is a file transfer program that allows sophisticated FTP, HTTP and other connections to other hosts.
       If  <u>site</u>  is  specified  then lftp will connect to that site otherwise a connection has to be established
       with the open command.

       <b>lftp</b> can handle several file access methods - FTP, FTPS, HTTP, HTTPS, HFTP, FISH, SFTP  and  file  (HTTPS
       and  FTPS  are only available when lftp is compiled with GNU TLS or OpenSSL library). You can specify the
       method to use in `open URL' command, e.g. `open <a href="http://www.us.kernel.org/pub/linux">http://www.us.kernel.org/pub/linux</a>'.  HFTP  is  ftp-over-
       http-proxy   protocol.   It   can   be  used  automatically  instead  of  FTP  if  ftp:proxy  is  set  to
       `<a href="http://proxy">http://proxy</a>[:port]'. Fish is a protocol working over an ssh connection to a unix  account.  SFtp  is  a
       protocol implemented in SSH2 as SFTP subsystem.

       Besides  FTP-like  protocols,  lftp  has support for BitTorrent protocol as `torrent' command. Seeding is
       also supported.

       Every operation in <b>lftp</b> is reliable, that is any non-fatal error is handled properly and the operation is
       repeated. So if downloading breaks, it will be restarted from the point automatically. Even if FTP server
       does not support the REST command, <b>lftp</b> will try to retrieve the file from the very beginning  until  the
       file is transferred completely.

       <b>lftp</b> has shell-like command syntax allowing you to launch several commands in parallel in background (&amp;).
       It  is  also possible to group commands within () and execute them in background. All background jobs are
       executed in the same single process. You can bring a foreground job to background with ^Z (c-z) and  back
       with  command  `wait'  (or `fg' which is alias to `wait'). To list running jobs, use command `jobs'. Some
       commands allow redirecting their output (cat, ls, ...) to file or via pipe to external command.  Commands
       can be executed conditionally based on termination status of previous command (&amp;&amp;, ||).

       If you exit <b>lftp</b> before all jobs are not finished yet, <b>lftp</b> will move itself to nohup mode in background.
       The same thing happens with a real modem hangup or when you close an xterm.

       <b>lftp</b>  has  built-in  mirror  which  can  download or update a whole directory tree. There is also reverse
       mirror (mirror -R) which uploads or updates a directory tree  on  server.  Mirror  can  also  synchronize
       directories between two remote servers, using FXP if available.

       There  is  command  `at'  to  launch a job at specified time in current context, command `queue' to queue
       commands for sequential execution for current server, and much more.

       On startup, <b>lftp</b> executes <u>/etc/lftp.conf</u> and then  <u><a href="file:~/.lftprc">~/.lftprc</a></u>  and  <u><a href="file:~/.lftp/rc">~/.lftp/rc</a></u>  (or  <u><a href="file:~/.config/lftp/rc">~/.config/lftp/rc</a></u>  if
       <u><a href="file:~/.lftp">~/.lftp</a></u>  does not exist).  You can place aliases and `set' commands there. Some people prefer to see full
       protocol debug, use `debug' to turn the debug on. Use `debug 3' to see only greeting messages  and  error
       messages.

       <b>lftp</b>  has  a  number of settable variables. You can use `set -a' to see all variables and their values or
       `set -d' to see list of defaults.  Variable names can be abbreviated and prefix can be omitted unless the
       rest becomes ambiguous.

       If lftp was compiled with OpenSSL (configure  --with-openssl)  it  includes  software  developed  by  the
       OpenSSL Project for use in the OpenSSL Toolkit. (<a href="http://www.openssl.org/">http://www.openssl.org/</a>)

   <b>Commands</b>
       <b>!</b> <u>shell</u> <u>command</u>

       Launch shell or shell command.

              !ls

       To do a directory listing of the local host.

       <b>alias</b>  [<u>name</u> [<u>value</u>]]

       Define  or  undefine  alias  <u>name</u>.  If  <u>value</u> is omitted, the alias is undefined, else it takes the value
       <u>value</u>. If no argument is given the current aliases are listed.

              alias dir ls -lF
              alias less zmore

       <b>at</b> <u>time</u> [ -- <u>command</u> ]

       Wait until the given time and execute given (optional) command. See also <b><a href="../man1/at.1.html">at</a></b>(1).

       <b>attach</b>  [<u>PID</u>]

       Attach the terminal to specified backgrounded lftp process.

       <b>bookmark</b>  [<u>subcommand</u>]

       The bookmark command controls bookmarks.

       Site names can be used in the <u>open</u> command directly as-is or in any command that accepts input URLs using
       the <u>bm:site/path</u> format.
              add &lt;name&gt; [&lt;loc&gt;]   add current place or given location to bookmarks and bind to given name
              del &lt;name&gt;           remove bookmark with name
              edit                 start editor on bookmarks file
              import &lt;type&gt;        import foreign bookmarks
              list                 list bookmarks (default)

       <b>cache</b>  [<u>subcommand</u>]

       The cache command controls local memory cache.  The following subcommands are recognized:
       stat        print cache status (default)
       on|off      turn on/off caching
       flush       flush cache
       size <u>lim</u>    set memory limit, -1 means unlimited
       expire <u>Nx</u>   set cache expiration time to <u>N</u> seconds (<u>x</u>=s) minutes (<u>x</u>=m) hours (<u>x</u>=h) or days (<u>x</u>=d)

       <b>cat</b> <u>files</u>

       cat outputs the remote file(s) to stdout.  (See also <b>more</b>, <b>zcat</b> and <b>zmore</b>)

       <b>cd</b> rdir

       Change current remote directory.  The previous remote directory is stored as `-'. You can do  `cd  -'  to
       change  the  directory  back.  The previous directory for each site is also stored on disk, so you can do
       `open site; cd -' even after lftp restart.

       <b>chmod</b> [<b>OPTS</b>] <u>mode</u> <u>files...</u>

       Change permission mask on remote files. The mode  can  be  an  octal  number  or  a  symbolic  mode  (see
       <a href="../man1/chmod.1.html">chmod</a>(1)).

              -c, --changes     like verbose but report only when a change is made
              -f, --quiet       suppress most error messages
              -v, --verbose     output a diagnostic for every file processed
              -R, --recursive   change files and directories recursively

       <b>close</b> [<b>-a</b>]

       Close idle connections.  By default only with the current server, use -a to close all idle connections.

       <b>cls</b> [<b>OPTS</b>] <u>files...</u>

       `cls'  tries  to  retrieve  information  about specified files or directories and outputs the information
       according to format options. The difference between `ls' and `cls' is that `ls' requests  the  server  to
       format file listing, and `cls' formats it itself, after retrieving all the needed information.

              -1                         single-column output
              -a, --all                  show dot files

              -l, --long                 use a long listing format
              -q, --quiet                don't show status
              -s, --size                 print size of each file
                  --filesize             if printing size, only print size for files
              -i, --nocase               case-insensitive pattern matching
              -I, --sortnocase           sort names case-insensitively
              -D, --dirsfirst            list directories first
                  --sort=OPT             "name", "size", "date"
              -S                         sort by file size
                  --user, --group,

                  --block-size=SIZ   use SIZ-byte blocks
              -b, --bytes            print size in bytes
              -c, --total            produce a grand total
              -d, --max-depth=N      print  the  total  for a directory (or file, with --all) only if it is N or
                                     fewer levels below the command line argument;  --max-depth=0 is the same as
                                     --summarize
              -F, --files            print number of files instead of sizes

              -k, --kilobytes        like --block-size=1024
              -m, --megabytes        like --block-size=1048576
              -S, --separate-dirs    do not include size of subdirectories

       <b>echo</b> [<b>-n</b>] <u>string</u>

       Prints (echos) the given string to the display.

       <b>edit</b> [<b>OPTS</b>] <u>file</u>

       Retrieve remote file to a temporary location, run a local editor on  it  and  upload  the  file  back  if
       changed. Options:
              -k        keep the temporary file
              -o &lt;temp&gt; explicit temporary file location

       <b>eval</b> [<b>-f</b> <u>format</u> ] <u>args...</u>

       without  -f  it  executes  given  arguments  as  a command. With -f, arguments are transformed into a new
       command. The format can contain plain  text  and  placeholders  $0...$9  and  $@,  corresponding  to  the
       arguments.

       <b>exit</b> [<b>bg</b>] [<b>top</b>] [<b>parent</b>] [<b>kill</b>] [<u>code</u>]

       exit  will  exit  from  lftp or move to background if there are active jobs. If no job is active, <u>code</u> is
       passed to operating system as lftp's termination status. If <u>code</u>  is  omitted,  the  exit  code  of  last
       command is used.

       `exit  bg'  forces  moving  to  background when cmd:move-background is false.  `exit top' makes top level
       `shell' (internal lftp command executor) terminate.  `exit  parent'  terminates  the  parent  shell  when
       running  a  nested  script.   `exit  kill'  kills  all  numbered  jobs before exiting. The options can be
       combined, e.g.  `at 08:00 -- exit top kill &amp;' kills all jobs and makes lftp exit at specified time.

       <b>fg</b>

       Alias for `wait'.

       <b>find</b> [<b>OPTS</b>] <u>directory...</u>

       List files in the directory (current directory by default)  recursively.   This  can  help  with  servers
       lacking ls -R support. You can redirect output of this command. Options:
              -d <u>MD</u>, --max-depth=<u>MD</u>   specify maximum scan depth
              -l,    --ls             use long listing format

       <b>ftpcopy</b>

       Obsolete. Use one of the following instead:
              get ftp://... -o ftp://...
              get -O ftp://... file1 file2...
              put ftp://...
              mput <a href="ftp://.../">ftp://.../</a>*
              mget -O ftp://... <a href="ftp://.../">ftp://.../</a>*
       or  other  combinations  to  get FXP transfer (directly between two FTP servers).  lftp would fallback to
       plain copy (via client) if FXP transfer cannot be initiated or ftp:use-fxp is false.

       <b>get</b> [<b>-E</b>] [<b>-a</b>] [<b>-c</b>] [<b>-e</b>] [<b>-P</b> <u>N</u>] [<b>-O</b> <u>base</u>] <u>rfile</u> [<b>-o</b> <u>lfile</u>] ...

       Retrieve the remote file <u>rfile</u> and store it as the local file <u>lfile</u>.  If  -o  is  omitted,  the  file  is
       stored  to  local  file  named  as  base name of <u>rfile</u>. You can get multiple files by specifying multiple
       instances of <u>rfile</u> (and -o <u>lfile</u>). Does not expand wildcards, use <b>mget</b> for that.
              -c          continue, reget
              -E          delete source files after successful transfer
              -e          delete target file before the transfer
              -a          use ascii mode (binary is the default)
              -P <u>N</u>        download <u>N</u> files in parallel
              -O &lt;base&gt;   specifies base directory or URL where files should be placed

       Examples:
              get README
              get README -o debian.README
              get README README.mirrors
              get README -o debian.README README.mirrors -o debian.mirrors
              get README -o <a href="ftp://some.host.org/debian.README">ftp://some.host.org/debian.README</a>
              get README -o <a href="ftp://some.host.org/debian-dir/">ftp://some.host.org/debian-dir/</a>   <b>(end</b> <b>slash</b> <b>is</b> <b>important)</b>

       <b>get1</b> [<u>OPTS</u>] <u>rfile</u>

       Transfer a single file. Options:
              -o &lt;lfile&gt;                  destination file name (default - basename of rfile)
              -c                          continue, reget
              -E                          delete source files after successful transfer
              -a                          use ascii mode (binary is the default)
              -d                          create the directory of the target file
              --source-region=&lt;from-to&gt;   transfer specified region of source file
              --target-position=&lt;pos&gt;     position in target file to write data at

       <b>glob</b>  [<u>OPTS</u>] [<u>command</u>] <u>patterns</u>

       Glob given patterns containing metacharacters and pass result to given command or return appropriate exit
       code.
              -f            plain files (default)
              -d            directories
              -a            all types
              --exist       return zero exit code when the patterns expand to non-empty list
              --not-exist   return zero exit code when the patterns expand to an empty list

       Examples:
              glob echo *
              glob --exist *.csv &amp;&amp; echo "There are *.csv files"

       <b>help</b> [<u>cmd</u>]

       Print help for <u>cmd</u> or if no <u>cmd</u> was specified print a list of available commands.

       <b>history</b> [<b>OPTS</b>] [<u>cnt</u>]

       View or manipulate the command history.  Optional argument <u>cnt</u> specifies the number of history  lines  to
       list, or "all" to list all entries.  Options:
              -w &lt;file&gt; Write history to file.
              -r &lt;file&gt; Read history from file; appends to current history.
              -c        Clear the history.
              -l        List the history (default).

       <b>jobs</b> [<u>OPTS</u>] [<u>job_no...</u>]

       <b>lpwd</b>

       Print current working directory on local machine.

       <b>ls</b> <u>params</u>

       List  remote  files. You can redirect output of this command to file or via pipe to external command.  By
       default, ls output is cached, to see new listing use <b>rels</b> or <b>cache</b> <b>flush.</b>

       <b>mget</b> [<b>-c</b>] [<b>-d</b>] [<b>-a</b>] [<b>-E</b>] [<b>-e</b>] [<b>-P</b> <u>N</u>] [<b>-O</b> <u>base</u>] <u>files</u>

       Gets selected files with expanded wildcards.

              -c          continue, reget.
              -d          create directories the same as file names and get  the  files  into  them  instead  of

              -O &lt;base&gt;   specifies base directory or URL where files should be placed

       <b>mirror</b> [<u>OPTS</u>] [<u>source</u> [<u>target</u>]]

       Mirror specified source directory to the target directory.

       By default the source is remote and the target is a local directory.  When using -R, the source directory
       is local and the target is remote.  If the target directory is omitted, base name of the source directory
       is used.  If both directories are omitted, current local and remote directories are used.

       The source and/or the target may be URLs pointing to directories.

       If  the  target  directory  ends  with  a  slash (except the root directory) then base name of the source
       directory is appended.

                                                  caution).  Top level directory is not  removed  if  it's  name
                                                  ends with a slash.
                       --Move                     same as --Remove-source-dirs
              -a                                  same as --allow-chown --allow-suid --no-umask
       <u>RX</u> is an extended regular expression, just like in <b><a href="../man1/egrep.1.html">egrep</a></b>(1).

       <u>GP</u> is a glob pattern, e.g. `*.zip'.

       Include  and  exclude options can be specified multiple times. It means that a file or directory would be
       mirrored if it matches an include and does not match to excludes after the include,  or  does  not  match
       anything and the first check is exclude. Directories are matched with a slash appended.

       Note  that symbolic links are not created when uploading to remote server, because FTP protocol cannot do
       it. To upload files the links refer to, use `mirror -RL' command (treat symbolic links as files).

       For options --newer-than and --older-than you can either specify a file or time specification  like  that
       used  by <b><a href="../man1/at.1.html">at</a></b>(1) command, e.g.  `now-7days' or `week ago'. If you specify a file, then modification time of
       that file will be used.

       Verbosity level can be selected using --verbose=level option or by several -v options, e.g. -vvv.  Levels
       are:
              0 - no output (default)
              1 - print actions
              2 - +print not deleted file names (when -e is not specified)
              3 - +print directory names which are mirrored

       --only-newer  turns  off  file  size  comparison  and  uploads/downloads only newer files even if size is
       different. By default older files are transferred and replace newer ones.

       --upload-older allows replacing newer remote files with older ones (when the target side is remote). Some
       remote back-ends cannot preserve timestamps so the default is to keep newer files.

       Recursion mode can be one of `always', `never',  `missing',  `newer'.  With  the  option  `newer'  mirror
       compares  timestamps  of  directories and enters a directory only if it is older or missing on the target
       side. Be aware that when a file changes the directory timestamp  may  stay  the  same,  so  mirror  won't
       process that directory.

       The  options  --file  and  --directory  may  be  used  multiple  times  and even mixed provided that base
       directories of the paths are the same.

       You can mirror between two servers if you specify URLs instead of directories.  FXP is automatically used
       for transfers between FTP servers, if possible.

       Some FTP servers hide dot-files by default (e.g. <u>.htaccess</u>), and show them only when LIST command is used
       with -a option. In such case try to use `set ftp:list-options -a'.

       The recursion modes `newer' and `missing' conflict with --scan-all-first, --depth-first,  --no-empty-dirs
       and setting mirror:no-empty-dirs=true.

       <b>mkdir</b> [<b>-p</b>] [<b>-f</b>] <u>dir(s)</u>

       Make  remote  directories.  If -p is used, make all components of paths.  The -f option makes mkdir quiet
       and suppresses messages.

       <b>module</b> <u>module</u> [ <u>args</u> ]

       Load given module using <b><a href="../man3/dlopen.3.html">dlopen</a></b>(3) function. If module name does not contain a slash, it  is  searched  in
       directories  specified  by  module:path  variable.   Arguments  are  passed  to module_init function. See
       README.modules for technical details.

       <b>more</b> <u>files</u>

       Same as `cat <u>files</u> | more'. if <b>PAGER</b> is set, it is used as filter.  (See also <b>cat</b>, <b>zcat</b> and <b>zmore</b>)

       <b>mput</b> [<b>-c</b>] [<b>-d</b>] [<b>-a</b>] [<b>-E</b>] [<b>-e</b>] [<b>-P</b> <u>N</u>] [<b>-O</b> <u>base</u>] <u>files</u>

       Upload files with wildcard expansion. By default it uses the base name of local name as remote one.  This
       can be changed by `-d' option.
              -c          continue, reput
              -d          create  directories  the  same as in file names and put the files into them instead of
                          current directory
              -E          delete source files after successful transfer (dangerous)
              -e          delete target file before the transfer
              -a          use ascii mode (binary is the default)
              -P <u>N</u>        upload <u>N</u> files in parallel
              -O &lt;base&gt;   specifies base directory or URL where files should be placed

       <b>mrm</b> <u>file(s)</u>

       Same as `glob rm'. Removes specified file(s) with wildcard expansion.

       <b>mmv</b> [<b>-O</b> <u>directory</u>] <u>file(s)</u> <u>directory</u>

       Move specified files to a target directory. The target directory can be specified after -O option  or  as
       the last argument.

              -O &lt;dir&gt;   specifies the target directory where files should be placed

       <b>mv</b> <u>file1</u> <u>file2</u>

       Rename  <u>file1</u>  to <u>file2</u>. No wildcard exmapsion is performed.  If you give more than two arguments, or the
       last argument ends with a slash, then <b>mmv</b> command is executed instead.

       <b>nlist</b> [<u>args</u>]

       List remote file names

       <b>open</b> [<u>OPTS</u>] <u>site</u>

       Select a server by host name, URL or bookmark. When an URL or bookmark is given, automatically change the
       current working directory to the directory of the URL.  Options:
              -e <u>cmd</u>            execute the command just after selecting the server
              -u <u>user</u>[,<u>pass</u>]    use the user/password for authentication

              -B                don't look up bookmarks
              --user <u>user</u>       use the user for authentication
              --password <u>pass</u>   use the password for authentication
              --env-password    take password from <b>LFTP_PASSWORD</b> environment variable
              <u>site</u>              host name, URL or bookmark name

       <b>pget</b> [<u>OPTS</u>] <u>rfile</u> [<b>-o</b> <u>lfile</u>]

       Gets the specified file using several connections. This can speed up transfer,  but  loads  the  net  and
       server heavily impacting other users. Use only if you really have to transfer the file ASAP.  Options:
              -c           continue transfer. Requires <u>lfile.lftp-pget-status</u> file.
              -n <u>maxconn</u>   set maximum number of connections (default is taken from <b>pget:default-n</b> setting)

       <b>put</b> [<b>-E</b>] [<b>-a</b>] [<b>-c</b>] [<b>-e</b>] [<b>-P</b> <u>N</u>] [<b>-O</b> <u>base</u>] <u>lfile</u> [<b>-o</b> <u>rfile</u>]

       Upload  <u>lfile</u>  with remote name <u>rfile</u>. If -o omitted, the base name of <u>lfile</u> is used as remote name. Does
       not expand wildcards, use <b>mput</b> for that.
              -o &lt;rfile&gt;   specifies remote file name (default - basename of lfile)
              -c           continue, reput. It requires permission to overwrite remote files
              -E           delete source files after successful transfer (dangerous)
              -e           delete target file before the transfer

              -P <u>N</u>         upload <u>N</u> files in parallel
              -O &lt;base&gt;    specifies base directory or URL where files should be placed

       <b>pwd</b> [<b>-p</b>]

       Print current remote URL. Use `-p' option to show password in the URL.

       <b>queue</b> [<b>-n</b> <u>num</u> ] <u>cmd</u>

       Add the given command to queue for sequential execution. Each site has  its  own  queue.  `-n'  adds  the
       command  before  the  given  item in the queue. Don't try to queue `cd' or `lcd' commands, it may confuse
       lftp. Instead do the cd/lcd before `queue' command, and it will remember the place in which  the  command
       is  to  be  done.  It is possible to queue up an already running job by `queue wait &lt;jobno&gt;', but the job
       will continue execution even if it is not the first in queue.

       `queue stop' will stop the queue, it will not execute any new commands, but  already  running  jobs  will
       continue  to  run.  You  can use `queue stop' to create an empty stopped queue. `queue start' will resume
       queue execution.  When you exit lftp, it will start all stopped queues automatically.

       `queue' with no arguments will either create a stopped queue or print queue status.

       <b>queue</b> <b>--delete|-d</b> [<u>index</u> <u>or</u> <u>wildcard</u> <u>expression</u>]

       Delete one or more items from the queue. If no argument is given, the last entry in the queue is deleted.

       <b>queue</b> <b>--move|-m</b> &lt;<u>index</u> <u>or</u> <u>wildcard</u> <u>expression</u>&gt; [<u>index</u>]

       Move the given items before the given queue index, or to the end if no destination is given.

              -q   Be quiet.
              -v   Be verbose.
              -Q   Output in a format that can be used to re-queue. Useful with --delete.

       Examples:
              &gt; get file &amp;
              [1] get file
              &gt; queue wait 1
              &gt; queue get another_file
              &gt; cd a_directory
              &gt; queue get yet_another_file

              queue -d 3             Delete the third item in the queue.
              queue -m 6 4           Move the sixth item in the queue before the fourth.
              queue -m "get*zip" 1   Move all commands matching "get*zip" to the beginning of the  queue.   (The
                                     order of the items is preserved.)
              queue -d "get*zip"     Delete all commands matching "get*zip".

       <b>quote</b> <u>cmd</u>

       For FTP - send the command uninterpreted. Use with caution - it can lead to unknown remote state and thus
       will  cause  reconnect.  You  cannot be sure that any change of remote state because of quoted command is
       solid - it can be reset by reconnect at any time.

       For HTTP - specific to HTTP action. Syntax: ``quote &lt;command&gt; [&lt;args&gt;]''.  Command may be  ``set-cookie''
       or ``post''.
              open <a href="http://www.site.net">http://www.site.net</a>
              quote set-cookie "variable=value; othervar=othervalue"
              set http:post-content-type application/x-www-form-urlencoded
              quote post /cgi-bin/script.cgi "var=value&amp;othervar=othervalue" &gt; local_file

       For  FISH - send the command uninterpreted. This can be used to execute arbitrary commands on server. The
       command must not take input or print ### at new line beginning. If it does, the protocol will become  out
       of sync.
              open fish://server
              quote find -name \*.zip

       <b>reget</b> <u>rfile</u> [<b>-o</b> <u>lfile</u>]

              -c &lt;count&gt;    maximum number of iterations
              -d &lt;delay&gt;    delay between iterations
              --while-ok    stop when command exits with non-zero code
              --until-ok    stop when command exits with zero code
              --weak        stop when lftp moves to background.

       Examples:

       Sleep given time interval and exit. Interval is in seconds by default, but can be suffixed with 'm', 'h',
       'd' for minutes, hours and days respectively.  See also <b>at</b>.

       <b>slot</b> [<u>name</u>]

       Select  specified  slot  or list all slots allocated. A slot is a connection to a server, somewhat like a
       virtual console. You can create multiple slots connected to different servers and  switch  between  them.
       You can also use <u>slot:name</u> as a pseudo-URL evaluating to that slot location.

       Default readline binding allows quick switching between slots named 0-9 using Meta-0 - Meta-9 keys (often
       you can use Alt instead of Meta).

       <b>source</b> <u>file</u>
       <b>source</b> <b>-e</b> <u>command</u>

       Execute commands recorded in file <u>file</u> or returned by specified external command.
              source <a href="file:~/.lftp/rc">~/.lftp/rc</a>
              source -e echo help

       <b>suspend</b>

       Stop  lftp  process. Note that transfers will be also stopped until you continue the process with shell's
       fg or bg commands.

       <b>torrent</b> [<b>OPTS</b>] <u>torrent-files...</u>

       Start BitTorrent process for the given <u>torrent-files</u>, which can be a local  file,  URL,  magnet  link  or
       plain  <u>info_hash</u>  written  in  hex  or  base32.   Local  wildcards are expanded. Existing files are first
       validated unless <u>--force-valid</u> option is given. Missing  pieces  are  downloaded.  Files  are  stored  in
       specified  <u>directory</u>  or  current  working  directory  by  default. Seeding continues until ratio reaches
       <u>torrent:stop-on-ratio</u> setting or time of <u>torrent:seed-max-time</u> runs out.

       Options:
              -O &lt;directory&gt;           specifies base directory where files should be placed
              --force-valid            skip file validation (if you are sure they are ok).
              --only-new               stop if the metadata is known already or the torrent is complete.
              --only-incomplete        stop if the torrent is already complete.
              --dht-bootstrap=&lt;node&gt;   bootstrap DHT by sending a query to specified <u>node</u>.  This  option  should
                                       be used just once to fill the local node cache.  Port number may be given
                                       after  colon,  default  is  6881.  Here are some nodes for bootstrapping:
                                       dht.transmissionbt.com, router.utorrent.com, router.bittorrent.com.
              --share                  share specified file or directory using BitTorrent protocol. Magnet  link
                                       is printed when it's ready.

       <b>user</b> <u>user</u> [<u>pass</u>]
       <b>user</b> <u>URL</u> [<u>pass</u>]

       Use  specified  info for remote login. If you specify an URL with user name, the entered password will be
       cached so that future URL references can use it.

       <b>version</b>

       Print <b>lftp</b> version.

       <b>wait</b> [<u>jobno</u>]
       <b>wait</b> <b>all</b>

       <b>zmore</b> <u>files</u>

       Same as more, but filter each file through zcat. (See also <b>cat</b>, <b>zcat</b> and <b>more</b>)

   <b>Settings</b>
       On startup, lftp executes <u><a href="file:~/.lftprc">~/.lftprc</a></u> and <u><a href="file:~/.lftp/rc">~/.lftp/rc</a></u> (or <u><a href="file:~/.config/lftp/rc">~/.config/lftp/rc</a></u> if <u><a href="file:~/.lftp">~/.lftp</a></u> does not exist).  You
       can place aliases and `set' commands there. Some people prefer to see full protocol debug, use `debug' to

              means off.

       <b>cmd:ls-default</b> (string)
              default ls argument

       <b>cmd:move-background</b> (boolean)

       <b>cmd:move-background-detach</b> (boolean)
              when true (default), lftp detaches itself from the control terminal when moving to background,  it
              is  possible to attach back using `attach' command; when false, lftp tricks the shell to move lftp
              to background process group and continues to run, then  fg  shell  command  brings  lftp  back  to
              foreground unless it has done all jobs and terminated.

       <b>cmd:prompt</b> (string)
              The prompt. lftp recognizes the following backslash-escaped special characters that are decoded as
              follows:
              <b>\@</b>     insert @ if the current remote site user is not default
              <b>\a</b>     an ASCII bell character (07)
              <b>\e</b>     an ASCII escape character (033)
              <b>\h</b>     the remote hostname you are connected to
              <b>\n</b>     newline
              <b>\s</b>     the name of the client (lftp)
              <b>\S</b>     current slot name
              <b>\u</b>     the username of the remote site user you are logged in as
              <b>\U</b>     the URL of the remote site (e.g., <a href="ftp://g437.ub.gu.se/home/james/src/lftp">ftp://g437.ub.gu.se/home/james/src/lftp</a>)
              <b>\v</b>     the version of <b>lftp</b> (e.g., 2.0.3)
              <b>\w</b>     the current working directory at the remote site
              <b>\W</b>     the base name of the current working directory at the remote site

              <b>\\</b>     a backslash
              <b>\?</b>     skips next character if previous substitution was empty.
              <b>\[</b>     begin  a  sequence  of  non-printing  characters,  which  could be used to embed a terminal
                     control sequence into the prompt
              <b>\]</b>     end a sequence of non-printing characters

       <b>cmd:parallel</b> (number)
              Number of jobs run in parallel in non-interactive mode.  For  example,  this  may  be  useful  for
              scripts  with  multiple  `get'  commands. Note that setting this to a value greater than 1 changes
              conditional execution behaviour, basically makes it inconsistent.

       <b>cmd:queue-parallel</b> (number)
              Number of jobs run in parallel in a queue.

       <b>cmd:remote-completion</b> (boolean)
              a boolean to control whether or not lftp uses remote completion. When true, <b>Tab</b> key guesses if the
              word being completed should be a remote file name. <b>Meta-Tab</b> does remote completion always. So  you
              can force remote completion with <b>Meta-Tab</b> when <b>cmd:remote-completion</b> is false or when the guess is
              wrong.

       <b>cmd:save-cwd-history</b> (boolean)
              when   true,   lftp   saves   last   CWD   of  each  site  to  <u><a href="file:~/.local/share/lftp/cwd_history">~/.local/share/lftp/cwd_history</a></u>  or
              <u><a href="file:~/.lftp/cwd_history">~/.lftp/cwd_history</a></u>, allowing to do ``cd -'' after lftp restart. Default is true.

       <b>cmd:save-rl-history</b> (boolean)
              when true, lftp saves readline history to <u><a href="file:~/.local/share/lftp/rl_history">~/.local/share/lftp/rl_history</a></u> or <u><a href="file:~/.lftp/rl_history">~/.lftp/rl_history</a></u>  on
              exit.  Default is true.

       <b>cmd:show-status</b> (boolean)
              when false, lftp does not show status line on terminal. Default is true.

       <b>cmd:set-term-status</b> (boolean)
              when true, lftp updates terminal status if supported (e.g. xterm). The closure for this setting is
              the terminal type from TERM environment variable.

       <b>cmd:status-interval</b> (time<b>interval)</b>
              the time interval between status updates.

       <b>cmd:stifle-rl-history</b> (number)
              the number of lines to keep in readline history.

       <b>cmd:term-status</b> (string)
              the  format string to use to display terminal status. The closure for this setting is the terminal
              type from TERM environment variable. Default uses ``tsl'' and ``fsl'' termcap values.

              The following escapes are supported:
              \a   bell
              \e   escape
              \n   new line
              \s   "lftp"
              \v   lftp version
              \T   the status string

       <b>cmd:time-style</b> (string)
              This setting is the default value for cls --time-style option.

       <b>cmd:trace</b> (boolean)
              when true, lftp prints the commands it executes (like sh -x).

       <b>cmd:verify-host</b> (boolean)
              if true, lftp resolves host name immediately in `open' command.  It is also possible to  skip  the
              check for a single `open' command if `&amp;' is given, or if ^Z is pressed during the check.

       <b>cmd:verify-path</b> (boolean)
              if  true, lftp checks the path given in `cd' command.  It is also possible to skip the check for a
              single `cd' command if `&amp;' is given, or if ^Z is pressed during the check.  Examples:
              set cmd:verify-path/hftp://* false
              cd directory &amp;

       <b>cmd:verify-path-cached</b> (boolean)
              When false, `cd' to a directory known from cache as existent will succeed immediately.   Otherwise
              the verification will depend on cmd:verify-path setting.

       <b>color:use-color</b> (tri-boolean)
              when  true,  cls command and completion output colored file listings according to color:dir-colors

       <b>dns:cache-size</b> (number)
              maximum number of DNS cache entries.

       <b>dns:fatal-timeout</b> (time interval)
              limit the time for DNS queries. If DNS server is unavailable too long, lftp will fail to resolve a
              given host name. Set to `never' to disable.

       <b>dns:order</b> (list of protocol names)
              sets  the  order  of  DNS  queries. Default is ``inet6 inet'' which means first look up address in
              inet6 family, then inet and use them in that order.  To disable  inet6  (AAAA)  lookup,  set  this
              variable to ``inet''.

       <b>dns:use-fork</b> (boolean)
              if true, lftp will fork before resolving host address. Default is true.

       <b>dns:max-retries</b> (number)
              If  zero,  there  is  no limit on the number of times lftp will try to lookup an address.  If &gt; 0,

       <b>dns:name</b> (string)
              This setting can be used to substitute a host name alias with another name or IP address. The host
              name alias is used as the setting closure, the substituted name or IP address  is  in  the  value.
              Multiple names or IP addresses can be separated by comma.

              file fragmentation in pget and torrent commands.

       <b>fish:auto-confirm</b> (boolean)
              when true, lftp answers ``yes'' to all ssh questions, in particular to the question  about  a  new
              host key. Otherwise it answers ``no''.

       <b>fish:charset</b> (string)

              the program to use for connecting to remote server. It should support `-l' option for  user  name,
              `-p'  for  port  number. Default is `ssh -a -x'. You can set it to `rsh', for example. For private
              key authentication add `-i' option with the key file.

       <b>fish:shell</b> (string)
              use specified shell on server side. Default is /bin/sh. On some systems, <a href="file:/bin/sh">/bin/sh</a> exits when  doing
              cd  to a non-existent directory. lftp can handle that but it has to reconnect. Set it to <a href="file:/bin/bash">/bin/bash</a>
              for such systems if bash is installed.

       <b>ftp:acct</b> (string)
              Send this string in ACCT command after login. The result is ignored.  The closure for this setting

       <b>ftp:client</b> (string)
              the name of FTP client to send with CLNT command, if supported by server.  If it is empty, then no
              CLNT command will be sent.

       <b>ftp:compressed-re</b> (regex)

              exception is the loopback interface.

       <b>ftp:fix-pasv-address</b> (boolean)
              if  true, lftp will try to correct address returned by server for PASV command in case when server
              address is in public network and PASV returns an address from a private network. In this case lftp
              would substitute server address instead of the one returned by PASV command, port number would not
              be changed.  Default is true.

       <b>ftp:fxp-passive-source</b> (boolean)
              if true, lftp will try to set up source FTP server in passive mode  first,  otherwise  destination
              one.  If  first  attempt  fails, lftp tries to set them up the other way. If the other disposition
              fails too, lftp falls back to plain copy. See also ftp:use-fxp.

       <b>ftp:home</b> (string)
              Initial directory. Default is empty string which means auto. Set this to `/' if you don't like the

              If true, lftp uses control connection address instead of the one returned in PASV reply  for  data
              connection. This can be useful for broken NATs.  Default is false.

       <b>ftp:list-empty-ok</b> (boolean)
              if  set  to  false, empty lists from LIST command will be treated as incorrect, and another method
              (NLST) will be used.

       <b>ftp:list-options</b> (string)
              sets options which are always appended to LIST command. It can be useful to set this  to  `-a'  if
              server does not show dot (hidden) files by default.  Default is empty.

       <b>ftp:mode-z-level</b> (number)
              compression level (0-9) for uploading with MODE Z.

       <b>ftp:nop-interval</b> (seconds)
              delay  between NOOP commands when downloading tail of a file. This is useful for FTP servers which
              send "Transfer complete" message before flushing data transfer. In such cases  NOOP  commands  can
              prevent connection timeout.

       <b>ftp:passive-mode</b> (boolean)
              sets  passive  FTP  mode.  This  can be useful if you are behind a firewall or a dumb masquerading
              router. In passive mode lftp uses PASV command, not the PORT command which is used in active mode.
              In passive mode lftp itself makes the data connection to the server; in  active  mode  the  server
              connects to lftp for data transfer. Passive mode is the default.

       <b>ftp:port-ipv4</b> (ipv4 address)
              specifies  an  IPv4  address  to  send with PORT command. Default is empty which means to send the
              address of local end of control connection.

       <b>ftp:port-range</b> (from-to)
              allowed port range for the local side of the data connection.  Format is  min-max,  or  `full'  or
              `any' to indicate any port. Default is `full'.

       <b>ftp:prefer-epsv</b> (boolean)
              use EPSV as preferred passive mode. Default is `false'.

       <b>ftp:proxy</b> (URL)
              specifies  FTP  proxy  to  use.   To disable proxy set this to empty string. Note that it is a FTP
              proxy which uses FTP protocol, not FTP over HTTP. Default value is taken from environment variable
              <b>ftp_proxy</b> if it starts with ``ftp://''. If your FTP proxy requires  authentication,  specify  user
              name  and password in the URL.  If ftp:proxy starts with http:// then hftp protocol (FTP over HTTP
              proxy) is used instead of FTP automatically.

       <b>ftp:proxy-auth-type</b> (string)
              When set to ``joined'', lftp sends ``user@<a href="mailto:proxy_user@ftp.example.org">proxy_user@ftp.example.org</a>'' as user name to proxy,  and
              ``password@proxy_password'' as password.

              When  set  to ``joined-acct'', lftp sends ``<a href="mailto:user@ftp.example.org">user@ftp.example.org</a> proxy_user'' (with space) as user
              name to proxy. The site password is sent as usual and  the  proxy  password  is  expected  in  the
              following ACCT command.

              When  set  to  ``open'',  lftp  first  sends  proxy  user  and  proxy  password  and  then  ``OPEN
              ftp.example.org'' followed by ``USER user''.  The site password is then sent as usual.

              When set to ``user''  (default),  lftp  first  sends  proxy  user  and  proxy  password  and  then
              ``<a href="mailto:user@ftp.example.org">user@ftp.example.org</a>'' as user name.  The site password is then sent as usual.

              When  set to ``proxy-user@host'', lftp first sends ``USER <a href="mailto:proxy_user@ftp.example.org">proxy_user@ftp.example.org</a>'', then proxy
              password. The site user and password are then sent as usual.

       <b>ftp:rest-list</b> (boolean)
              allow usage of REST command before LIST command. This might be useful for large  directories,  but
              some FTP servers silently ignore REST before LIST.

       <b>ftp:rest-stor</b> (boolean)
              if  false,  lftp  will  not try to use REST before STOR. This can be useful for some buggy servers
              which corrupt (fill with zeros) the file if REST followed by STOR is used.

       <b>ftp:retry-530</b> (regex)
              Retry on server reply 530 for PASS command if text matches this regular expression.  This  setting
              should  be  useful  to  distinguish  between overloaded server (temporary condition) and incorrect
              password (permanent condition).

       <b>ftp:retry-530-anonymous</b> (regex)
              Additional regular expression for anonymous login, like ftp:retry-530.

       <b>ftp:site-group</b> (string)
              Send this string in SITE GROUP command after login. The result is ignored.  The closure  for  this
              setting has format <u>user@host</u>.

       <b>ftp:skey-allow</b> (boolean)
              allow sending skey/opie reply if server appears to support it. On by default.

       <b>ftp:skey-force</b> (boolean)
              do  not  send  plain  text  password  over the network, use skey/opie instead. If skey/opie is not
              available, assume failed login. Off by default.

       <b>ftp:ssl-allow</b> (boolean)
              if true, try to negotiate SSL connection with FTP server  for  non-anonymous  access.  Default  is
              true. This and other SSL settings are only available if lftp was compiled with an ssl/tls library.

       <b>ftp:ssl-auth</b> (string)
              the  argument  for  AUTH  command,  can  be  one  of  SSL,  TLS,  TLS-P,  TLS-C.   See RFC4217 for
              explanations. By default TLS or SSL will be used, depending on FEAT reply.

       <b>ftp:ssl-data-use-keys</b> (boolean)
              if true, lftp loads ssl:key-file for protected data connection too. When false, it does  not,  and
              the server can match data and control connections by session ID.  Default is true.

       <b>ftp:ssl-force</b> (boolean)
              if true, refuse to send password in clear when server does not support SSL.  Default is false.

       <b>ftp:ssl-protect-data</b> (boolean)
              if  true,  request SSL connection for data transfers. This provides privacy and transmission error
              correction. Was cpu-intensive on old CPUs. Default is true.

       <b>ftp:ssl-protect-fxp</b> (boolean)
              if true, request SSL connection for data transfer between two FTP servers in  FXP  mode.  CPSV  or
              SSCN  command  will  be used in that case. If SSL connection fails for some reason, lftp would try
              unprotected FXP transfer unless ftp:ssl-force is set for any of the two servers. Default is true.

       <b>ftp:ssl-protect-list</b> (boolean)
              if true, request SSL connection for file list transfers. Default is true.

       <b>ftp:ssl-use-ccc</b> (boolean)
              if true, lftp would issue CCC command after logon, thus disable ssl protection  layer  on  control
              connection.

       <b>ftp:stat-interval</b> (time interval)
              interval between STAT commands. Default is 1 second.

       <b>ftp:strict-multiline</b> (boolean)
              when  true,  lftp strictly checks for multiline reply format (expects it to end with the same code
              as it started with). When false, this check is relaxed.

       <b>ftp:sync-mode</b> (boolean)
              if true, lftp will send one command at a time and wait for response. This might be useful  if  you
              are  using  a  buggy FTP server or router. When it is off, lftp sends a pack of commands and waits
              for responses - it speeds up operation when round trip time is significant.  Unfortunately it does
              not work with all FTP servers and some routers have troubles with it, so it is on by default.

       <b>ftp:timezone</b> (string)
              Assume this timezone for time in listings returned by LIST  command.   This  setting  can  be  GMT
              offset  [+|-]HH[:MM[:SS]] or any valid TZ value (e.g. Europe/Moscow or MSK-3MSD,M3.5.0,M10.5.0/3).
              The default is GMT.  Set it to an empty value to assume local timezone  specified  by  environment
              variable TZ.

       <b>ftp:too-many-re</b> (regexp)
              Decrease the dynamic connection limit when 421 reply line matches this regular expression.

       <b>ftp:trust-feat</b> (string)
              When  true,  assume  that  FEAT returned data are correct and don't use common protocol extensions
              like SIZE, MDTM, REST if they are not listed.  Default is false.

       <b>ftp:use-abor</b> (boolean)
              if false, lftp does not send ABOR command but closes data connection immediately.

       <b>ftp:use-allo</b> (boolean)
              when true, lftp sends ALLO command before uploading a file.

       <b>ftp:use-feat</b> (boolean)
              when true (default), lftp uses FEAT command to determine extended features of ftp server.

       <b>ftp:use-fxp</b> (boolean)
              if true, lftp will try to set up direct connection between two ftp servers.

       <b>ftp:use-hftp</b> (boolean)
              when ftp:proxy points to an http proxy, this setting selects hftp method (GET,  HEAD)  when  true,
              and CONNECT method when false. Default is true.

       <b>ftp:use-ip-tos</b> (boolean)
              when  true,  lftp  uses  IPTOS_LOWDELAY  for  control  connection  and  IPTOS_THROUGHPUT  for data
              connections.

       <b>ftp:lang</b> (boolean)
              the language selected with LANG command, if supported as indicated by FEAT  response.  Default  is
              empty which means server default.

       <b>ftp:use-mdtm</b> (boolean)
              when true (default), lftp uses MDTM command to determine file modification time.

       <b>ftp:use-mdtm-overloaded</b> (boolean)
              when  true,  lftp  uses two argument MDTM command to set file modification time on uploaded files.
              Default is false.

       <b>ftp:use-mlsd</b> (boolean)
              when true, lftp will use MLSD command for directory listing if supported by the server.

       <b>ftp:use-mode-z</b> (boolean)
              when true, lftp will use "MODE Z" if supported by the server to perform compressed transfers.

       <b>ftp:use-pret</b> (tri-boolean)
              When set to auto, usage of PRET command depends on FEAT server reply. Otherwise this setting tells
              whether to use it or not. PRET command informs the server about the file to be transferred  before
              PORT or PASV commands, so that the server can adjust the data connection parameters.

       <b>ftp:use-site-idle</b> (boolean)
              when true, lftp sends `SITE IDLE' command with net:idle argument. Default is false.

       <b>ftp:use-site-utime</b> (boolean)
              when  true,  lftp  sends 5-argument `SITE UTIME' command to set file modification time on uploaded
              files. Default is true.

       <b>ftp:use-site-utime2</b> (boolean)
              when true, lftp sends 2-argument `SITE UTIME' command to set file modification  time  on  uploaded
              files.  Default  is true.  If 5-argument `SITE UTIME' is also enabled, 2-argument command is tried
              first.

       <b>ftp:use-size</b> (boolean)
              when true (default), lftp uses SIZE command to determine file size.

       <b>ftp:use-stat</b> (boolean)
              if true, lftp sends STAT command in FXP mode transfer to know how much data has been  transferred.
              See also ftp:stat-interval. Default is true.

       <b>ftp:use-stat-for-list</b> (boolean)
              when  true, lftp uses STAT instead of LIST command. By default `.' is used as STAT argument. Using
              STAT, lftp avoids creating data connection for directory listing.  Some  servers  require  special
              options for STAT, use ftp:list-options to specify them (e.g. <b>-la</b>).

       <b>ftp:use-telnet-iac</b> (boolean)
              when  true  (default),  lftp  uses  TELNET IAC command and follows TELNET protocol as specified in
              RFC959. When false, it does not follow TELNET protocol and thus does not double 255  (0xFF,  0377)
              character and does not prefix ABOR and STAT commands with TELNET IP+SYNCH signal.

       <b>ftp:use-tvfs</b> (tri-boolean)
              When set to auto, usage of TVFS feature depends on FEAT server reply. Otherwise this setting tells
              whether  to  use  it  or  not.  In short, if a server supports TVFS feature then it uses unix-like
              paths.

       <b>ftp:use-utf8</b> (boolean)
              if true, lftp sends `OPTS UTF8 ON' to the  server  to  activate  UTF-8  encoding  (if  supported).
              Disable it if the file names have a different encoding and the server has a trouble with it.

       <b>ftp:use-quit</b> (boolean)
              if true, lftp sends QUIT before disconnecting from ftp server. Default is true.

       <b>ftp:verify-address</b> (boolean)
              verify  that  data  connection comes from the network address of control connection peer. This can
              possibly prevent data connection spoofing which can lead to data corruption.  Unfortunately,  this
              can  fail  for  certain ftp servers with several network interfaces, when they do not set outgoing
              address on data socket, so it is disabled by default.

       <b>ftp:verify-port</b> (boolean)
              verify that data connection has port 20 (ftp-data) on its remote end.  This can  possibly  prevent
              data  connection  spoofing  by users of remote host. Unfortunately, too many windows and even unix
              ftp servers forget to set proper port on data connection, thus this check is off by default.

       <b>ftp:web-mode</b> (boolean)
              disconnect after closing data connection. This can be  useful  for  totally  broken  ftp  servers.
              Default is false.

       <b>ftps:initial-prot</b> (string)
              specifies  initial  PROT  setting  for  FTPS  connections. Should be one of: C, S, E, P, or empty.
              Default is empty which means unknown, so that lftp will use PROT command unconditionally. If  PROT
              command turns out to be unsupported, then Clear mode would be assumed.

       <b>hftp:cache</b> (boolean)
              allow server/proxy side caching for ftp-over-http protocol.

       <b>hftp:cache-control</b> (string)
              specify corresponding HTTP request header.

       <b>hftp:decode</b> (boolean)
              when  true,  lftp  automatically  decodes the entity in hftp protocol when Content-Encoding header
              value matches deflate, gzip, compress, x-gzip or x-compress.

       <b>hftp:proxy</b> (URL)
              specifies HTTP proxy for FTP-over-HTTP protocol (hftp). The protocol hftp cannot  work  without  a
              HTTP  proxy,  obviously.   Default value is taken from environment variable <b>ftp_proxy</b> if it starts
              with ``http://'', otherwise from environment variable <b>http_proxy</b>.   If  your  FTP  proxy  requires
              authentication, specify user name and password in the URL.

       <b>hftp:use-allprop</b> (boolean)
              if  true,  lftp will send `&lt;allprop/&gt;' request body in `PROPFIND' requests, otherwise it will send
              an empty request body.

       <b>hftp:use-authorization</b> (boolean)
              if set to off, lftp will send password as part of URL to the proxy. This may be required for  some
              proxies (e.g. M-soft). Default is on, and lftp will send password as part of Authorization header.

       <b>hftp:use-head</b> (boolean)
              if  set  to  off,  lftp  will try to use `GET' instead of `HEAD' for hftp protocol.  While this is
              slower, it may allow lftp to work with some proxies which don't  understand  or  mishandle  ``HEAD
              ftp://'' requests.

       <b>hftp:use-mkcol</b> (boolean)
              if  set  to  off,  lftp  will  try to use `PUT' instead of `MKCOL' to create directories with hftp
              protocol. Default is off.

       <b>hftp:use-propfind</b> (boolean)
              if set to off, lftp will not try to use `PROPFIND' to get directory contents  with  hftp  protocol
              and  use  `GET'  instead.  Default  is off. When enabled, lftp will also use PROPPATCH to set file
              modification time after uploading.

       <b>hftp:use-range</b> (boolean)
              when true, lftp will use Range header for transfer restart.

       <b>hftp:use-type</b> (boolean)
              If set to off, lftp won't try to append `;type=' to URLs passed to  proxy.   Some  broken  proxies
              don't handle it correctly. Default is on.

       <b>http:accept,</b> <b>http:accept-charset,</b> <b>http:accept-encoding,</b> <b>http:accept-language</b> (string)
              specify corresponding HTTP request headers.

       <b>http:authorization</b> (string)
              the  authorization  to use by default, when no user is specified. The format is ``user:password''.
              Default is empty which means no authorization.

       <b>http:cache</b> (boolean)
              allow server/proxy side caching.

       <b>http:cache-control</b> (string)
              specify corresponding HTTP request header.

       <b>http:cookie</b> (string)
              send this cookie to server. A closure is useful here:
                   set cookie/www.somehost.com "param=value"

       <b>http:decode</b> (boolean)
              when true, lftp automatically decodes  the  entity  when  Content-Encoding  header  value  matches
              deflate, gzip, compress, x-gzip or x-compress.

       <b>http:post-content-type</b> (string)
              specifies  value of Content-Type HTTP request header for POST method.  Default is ``application/x-
              www-form-urlencoded''.

       <b>http:proxy</b> (URL)
              specifies HTTP proxy. It is used when lftp works over HTTP protocol.  Default value is taken  from
              environment  variable  <b>http_proxy</b>.   If  your proxy requires authentication, specify user name and
              password in the URL.

       <b>http:put-method</b> (PUT or POST)
              specifies which HTTP method to use on put.

       <b>http:put-content-type</b> (string)
              specifies value of Content-Type HTTP request header for PUT method.

       <b>http:referer</b> (string)
              specifies value for Referer HTTP request header. Single dot `.' expands to current directory  URL.
              Default is `.'. Set to empty string to disable Referer header.

       <b>http:set-cookies</b> (boolean)
              if true, lftp modifies http:cookie variables when Set-Cookie header is received.

       <b>http:use-allprop</b> (boolean)
              if  true,  lftp will send `&lt;allprop/&gt;' request body in `PROPFIND' requests, otherwise it will send
              an empty request body.

       <b>http:use-mkcol</b> (boolean)
              if set to off, lftp will try to use `PUT' instead of  `MKCOL'  to  create  directories  with  HTTP
              protocol. Default is on.

       <b>http:use-propfind</b> (boolean)
              if  set  to  off, lftp will not try to use `PROPFIND' to get directory contents with HTTP protocol
              and use `GET' instead. Default is off. When enabled, lftp will also use PROPPATCH  to  set  `Last-
              Modified' property after a file upload.

       <b>http:use-range</b> (boolean)
              when true, lftp will use Range header for transfer restart.

       <b>http:user-agent</b> (string)
              the string lftp sends in User-Agent header of HTTP request.

       <b>https:proxy</b> (string)
              specifies https proxy. Default value is taken from environment variable <b>https_proxy</b>.

       <b>log:enabled</b> (boolean)
              when  true, the log messages are output. The closure for this and other `log:' variables is either
              `debug' for debug messages or `xfer' for transfer logging.

       <b>log:file</b> (string)
              the target output file for logging. When empty, <b>stderr</b> is used.

       <b>log:level</b> (number)

              when true, mirror doesn't create empty directories (like --no-empty-dirs option).

       <b>mirror:sort-by</b> (string)
              specifies order of file transfers. Valid values are: name, name-desc, size, size-desc, date, date-
              desc. When the value is name or name-desc, then mirror:order setting also  affects  the  order  or
              transfers.

       <b>mirror:order</b> (list of patterns)
              specifies  order  of file transfers when sorting by name. E.g. setting this to "*.sfv *.sum" makes

       <b>mirror:overwrite</b> (boolean)
              when true, mirror will overwrite plain files instead of removing and re-creating them.

       <b>mirror:parallel-directories</b> (boolean)
              if  true,  mirror  will start processing of several directories in parallel when it is in parallel
              mode. Otherwise,  it  will  transfer  files  from  a  single  directory  before  moving  to  other
              directories.

       <b>mirror:parallel-transfer-count</b> (number)
              specifies  number  of  parallel  transfers  mirror  is allowed to start.  You can override it with
              --parallel option.  A closure can be matched against source or  target  host  names,  the  minimum
              number greater than 0 is used.

       <b>mirror:require-source</b> (boolean)
              When true, mirror requires a source directory to be specified explicitly, otherwise it is supposed
              to be the current directory.

       <b>mirror:set-permissions</b> (boolean)
              When  set to off, mirror won't try to copy file and directory permissions.  You can override it by
              --perms option. Default is on.

       <b>mirror:skip-noaccess</b> (boolean)
              when true, mirror does not  try  to  download  files  which  are  obviously  inaccessible  by  the

       <b>module:path</b> (string)
              colon  separated  list  of  directories  to  look  for  modules. Can be initialized by environment
              variable LFTP_MODULE_PATH. Default is `PKGLIBDIR/VERSION:PKGLIBDIR'.

       <b>net:connection-limit</b> (number)
              maximum number of concurrent connections to the same site. 0 means unlimited.

       <b>net:limit-rate</b> (bytes per second)
              limit  transfer  rate on data connection. 0 means unlimited. You can specify two numbers separated
              by colon to limit download and upload rate separately.  Suffixes are supported,  e.g.  100K  means
              102400.

       <b>net:limit-total-rate</b> (bytes per second)
              limit  transfer  rate  of  all  connections in sum. 0 means unlimited. You can specify two numbers
              separated by colon to limit download and upload rate separately.  Note that sockets  have  receive
              buffers  on  them,  this  can  lead  to  network  link load higher than this rate limit just after
              transfer beginning. You can try to set net:socket-buffer to relatively small value to avoid this.

       If you specify a closure, then rate limitation will be applied to sum of connections to a single matching
       host.

       <b>net:limit-total-max</b> (bytes)
              limit accumulating of unused limit-total-rate. 0 means twice of limit-total-rate.

              from environment variable <b>no_proxy</b>.

       <b>net:persist-retries</b> (number)
              ignore this number of hard errors. Useful to login to buggy FTP servers which reply 5xx when there
              is too many users.

       <b>net:reconnect-interval-base</b> (seconds)
              sets the base minimal time between reconnects. Actual interval depends on  net:reconnect-interval-
              multiplier and number of attempts to perform an operation.

       <b>net:reconnect-interval-max</b> (seconds)
              sets  maximum  reconnect  interval.  When  current interval after multiplication by net:reconnect-
              interval-multiplier reaches this value (or  exceeds  it),  it  is  reset  back  to  net:reconnect-
              interval-base.

       <b>net:reconnect-interval-multiplier</b> (real number)
              sets multiplier by which base interval is multiplied each time new attempt to perform an operation
              fails.  When  the interval reaches maximum, it is reset to base value. See net:reconnect-interval-
              base and net:reconnect-interval-max.

       <b>net:socket-bind-ipv4</b> (ipv4 address)

              the command to validate file integrity. The only argument is the path to the file.

       The name of a variable can be abbreviated unless it becomes ambiguous.  The  prefix  before  `:'  can  be
       omitted  too.  You  can  set  one  variable  several times for different closures, and thus you can get a
       particular settings for particular state. The closure is to be specified after  variable  name  separated
       with slash `/'.

       The closure for `dns:', `net:', `ftp:', `http:', `hftp:' domain variables is currently just the host name
       as  you  specify  it  in  the  `open'  command  (with  some exceptions where closure is meaningless, e.g.
       dns:cache-size).  For some `cmd:' domain variables the closure is current URL without path.   For  `log:'
       domain  variables the closure is either `debug' or `xfer'.  For other variables it is not currently used.
       See examples in the sample <u>lftp.conf</u>.

       Certain commands and settings take a time interval parameter. It has the format  Nx[Nx...],  where  N  is
       time  amount  (floating point) and x is time unit: d - days, h - hours, m - minutes, s - seconds. Default
       unit is second. E.g. 5h30m or 5.5h.  Also the interval can be `infinity', `inf', `never', `forever' -  it
       means infinite interval. E.g. `sleep forever' or `set dns:cache-expire never'.

       Boolean  settings  can  be one of (true, on, yes, 1, +) for a True value or one of (false, off, no, 0, -)
       for a False value.

       Tri-boolean settings have either a boolean value or `auto'.

       Integer settings can have a suffix: k - kibi, m - mebi, g - gigi, etc.  They can also have a prefix: 0  -
       octal, 0x - hexadecimal.

   <b>FTP</b> <b>asynchronous</b> <b>mode</b> <b>(pipelining)</b>
       <b>Lftp</b> can speed up FTP operations by sending several commands at once and then checking all the responses.
       See  ftp:sync-mode  variable. Sometimes this does not work, thus synchronous mode is the default. You can
       try to turn synchronous mode off and see if it works for you. It is  known  that  some  network  software
       dealing  with  address  translation  works incorrectly in the case of several FTP commands in one network
       packet.

       RFC959 says: ``The user-process sending another command before the completion reply would be in violation
       of protocol; but server-FTP processes should queue any commands that arrive while a preceding command  is
       in  progress''.  Also,  RFC1123  says:  ``Implementors  MUST  NOT  assume any correspondence between READ
       boundaries on the control connection and the Telnet EOL sequences (CR LF).'' and ``a single READ from the
       control connection may include more than one FTP command''.

       So it must be safe to send several commands at once, which speeds up operation a lot and  seems  to  work
       with all Unix and VMS based ftp servers. Unfortunately, windows based servers often cannot handle several
       commands in one packet, and so cannot some broken routers.

              The file is used to store last working directories for each site visited.

       <u><a href="file:~/.local/share/lftp/bg/">~/.local/share/lftp/bg/</a></u> or <u><a href="file:~/.lftp/bg/">~/.lftp/bg/</a></u>
              The directory is used to store named sockets for backgrounded lftp processes.

       <u><a href="file:~/.cache/lftp/DHT/">~/.cache/lftp/DHT/</a></u> or <u><a href="file:~/.lftp/DHT/">~/.lftp/DHT/</a>"</u>
              The  directory is used to store DHT id and nodes cache for IPv4 and IPv6.  File name suffix is the
              host name.
