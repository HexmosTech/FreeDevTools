</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       xxdiff - a graphical file comparator and merge tool

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       xxdiff [OPTIONS] &lt;path&gt; &lt;path&gt; [&lt;path&gt;]

</pre><h4><b>OVERVIEW</b></h4><pre>
       <u>xxdiff</u>  is  a  graphical  file  and directories comparison and merge tool. It can be used for viewing the
       differences between two or three files, or two directories, and can be used to produce a merged  version.
       The  texts  of  the two or three files are presented side by side with their differences highlighted with
       colors for easy identification.

       The paths supplied on the command line identify the files to be compared.  The paths may be one of  three
       things:   a  regular  file, a directory or a '-', in which case the input for that path will be read from
       standard input.  If the paths are all directories, a directory diff will be performed.  If at  least  one
       path  is  a  file  or a '-', a file diff will be performed.  If there are directory names along with file
       names, the basename of the file name will be appended to the directory names to find the other  files  to
       compare  with.   If  there  are  multiple file names specified and some directories names as well, xxdiff
       bails out, since it doesn't know which basename to use for the missing one.

       Please consult xxdiff --help for more documentation.
