</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       ccmake - CMake Curses Dialog Command-Line Reference

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
          ccmake [&lt;options&gt;] -B &lt;path-to-build&gt; [-S &lt;path-to-source&gt;]
          ccmake [&lt;options&gt;] &lt;path-to-source | path-to-existing-build&gt;

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>ccmake</b>  executable  is  the CMake curses interface.  Project configuration settings may be specified
       interactively through this GUI.  Brief instructions are provided at the bottom of the terminal  when  the
       program is running.

       CMake   is  a  cross-platform  build  system  generator.   Projects  specify  their  build  process  with
       platform-independent CMake listfiles  included  in  each  directory  of  a  source  tree  with  the  name
       <b>CMakeLists.txt</b>.   Users  build  a  project by using CMake to generate a build system for a native tool on
       their platform.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-S</b> <b>&lt;path-to-source&gt;</b>
              Path to root directory of the CMake project to build.

       <b>-B</b> <b>&lt;path-to-build&gt;</b>
              Path to directory which CMake will use as the root of build directory.

              If the directory doesn't already exist CMake will make it.

       <b>-C</b> <b>&lt;initial-cache&gt;</b>
              Pre-load a script to populate the cache.

              When CMake is first run in an empty build tree, it creates a <b>CMakeCache.txt</b> file and populates  it
              with  customizable settings for the project.  This option may be used to specify a file from which
              to load cache entries before the first pass through the project's  CMake  listfiles.   The  loaded
              entries  take priority over the project's default values.  The given file should be a CMake script
              containing <u>set()</u> commands that use the <b>CACHE</b> option, not a cache-format file.

              References to <u>CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR</u> and <u>CMAKE_BINARY_DIR</u> within the script evaluate  to  the  top-level
              source and build tree.

       <b>-D</b> <b>&lt;var&gt;:&lt;type&gt;=&lt;value&gt;,</b> <b>-D</b> <b>&lt;var&gt;=&lt;value&gt;</b>
              Create or update a CMake <b>CACHE</b> entry.

              When  CMake is first run in an empty build tree, it creates a <b>CMakeCache.txt</b> file and populates it
              with customizable settings for the project.  This option may be used to  specify  a  setting  that
              takes  priority  over  the  project's default value.  The option may be repeated for as many <b>CACHE</b>
              entries as desired.

              If the <b>:&lt;type&gt;</b> portion is given it must be one  of  the  types  specified  by  the  <u>set()</u>  command
              documentation  for  its  <b>CACHE</b>  signature.   If  the  <b>:&lt;type&gt;</b> portion is omitted the entry will be
              created with no type if it does not exist with a type already.  If a command in the  project  sets
              the type to <b>PATH</b> or <b>FILEPATH</b> then the <b>&lt;value&gt;</b> will be converted to an absolute path.

              This option may also be given as a single argument: <b>-D&lt;var&gt;:&lt;type&gt;=&lt;value&gt;</b> or <b>-D&lt;var&gt;=&lt;value&gt;</b>.

              It's  important to note that the order of <b>-C</b> and <b>-D</b> arguments is significant. They will be carried
              out in the order they are listed, with the last argument taking precedence over the previous ones.
              For example, if you specify <b>-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug</b>, followed by a <b>-C</b> argument with a  file  that
              calls:

                 set(CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE "Release" CACHE STRING "" FORCE)

              then  the  <b>-C</b> argument will take precedence, and <b>CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE</b> will be set to <b>Release</b>. However,
              if the <b>-D</b> argument comes after the <b>-C</b> argument, it will be set to <b>Debug</b>.

              If a <b>set(...</b> <b>CACHE</b> <b>...)</b> call in the <b>-C</b> file does not use <b>FORCE</b>, and a <b>-D</b> argument  sets  the  same
              variable,  the  <b>-D</b>  argument  will  take  precedence  regardless of order because of the nature of
              non-<b>FORCE</b> <b>set(...</b> <b>CACHE</b> <b>...)</b> calls.

       <b>-U</b> <b>&lt;globbing_expr&gt;</b>
              Remove matching entries from CMake <b>CACHE</b>.

              This option may be used to remove one or more variables from  the  <b>CMakeCache.txt</b>  file,  globbing
              expressions  using <b>*</b> and <b>?</b> are supported.  The option may be repeated for as many <b>CACHE</b> entries as
              desired.

              Use with care, you can make your <b>CMakeCache.txt</b> non-working.

       <b>-G</b> <b>&lt;generator-name&gt;</b>
              Specify a build system generator.

              CMake may support multiple native build systems on certain platforms.  A generator is  responsible
              for  generating  a  particular  build  system.   Possible  generator  names  are  specified in the
              <u><a href="../man7/cmake-generators.7.html">cmake-generators</a>(7)</u> manual.

              If not specified, CMake checks the <u>CMAKE_GENERATOR</u> environment variable and otherwise  falls  back
              to a builtin default selection.

       <b>-T</b> <b>&lt;toolset-spec&gt;</b>
              Toolset specification for the generator, if supported.

              Some  CMake  generators  support  a  toolset  specification to tell the native build system how to
              choose a compiler.  See the <u>CMAKE_GENERATOR_TOOLSET</u> variable for details.

       <b>-A</b> <b>&lt;platform-name&gt;</b>
              Specify platform name if supported by generator.

              Some CMake generators support a platform name to be given to the native build system to  choose  a
              compiler or SDK.  See the <u>CMAKE_GENERATOR_PLATFORM</u> variable for details.

       <b>--toolchain</b> <b>&lt;path-to-file&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.21.

              Specify  the  cross compiling toolchain file, equivalent to setting <u>CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE</u> variable.
              Relative paths are interpreted as relative to the build directory, and if not found,  relative  to
              the source directory.

       <b>--install-prefix</b> <b>&lt;directory&gt;</b>
              Added in version 3.21.

              Specify the installation directory, used by the <u>CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX</u> variable. Must be an absolute
              path.

       <b>-Wno-dev</b>
              Suppress developer warnings.

              Suppress  warnings that are meant for the author of the <b>CMakeLists.txt</b> files. By default this will
              also turn off deprecation warnings.

       <b>-Wdev</b>  Enable developer warnings.

              Enable warnings that are meant for the author of the <b>CMakeLists.txt</b> files. By  default  this  will
              also turn on deprecation warnings.

       <b>-Wdeprecated</b>
              Enable deprecated functionality warnings.

              Enable  warnings  for  usage  of  deprecated  functionality,  that are meant for the author of the
              <b>CMakeLists.txt</b> files.

       <b>-Wno-deprecated</b>
              Suppress deprecated functionality warnings.

              Suppress warnings for usage of deprecated functionality, that are meant  for  the  author  of  the
              <b>CMakeLists.txt</b> files.

       <b>-Werror=&lt;what&gt;</b>
              Treat CMake warnings as errors. <b>&lt;what&gt;</b> must be one of the following:

              <b>dev</b>    Make developer warnings errors.

                     Make  warnings that are meant for the author of the <b>CMakeLists.txt</b> files errors. By default
                     this will also turn on deprecated warnings as errors.

              <b>deprecated</b>
                     Make deprecated macro and function warnings errors.

                     Make warnings for usage of deprecated macros and functions, that are meant for  the  author
                     of the <b>CMakeLists.txt</b> files, errors.

       <b>-Wno-error=&lt;what&gt;</b>
              Do not treat CMake warnings as errors. <b>&lt;what&gt;</b> must be one of the following:

              <b>dev</b>    Make  warnings  that  are  meant  for the author of the <b>CMakeLists.txt</b> files not errors. By
                     default this will also turn off deprecated warnings as errors.

              <b>deprecated</b>
                     Make warnings for usage of deprecated macros and functions, that are meant for  the  author
                     of the <b>CMakeLists.txt</b> files, not errors.
