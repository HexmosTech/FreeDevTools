       <b>datalad</b>  <b>annotate-paths</b>  [-h]  [-d  DATASET]  [-r]  [-R  LEVELS]  [--action  LABEL]  [--unavailable-path-
              status LABEL] [--unavailable-path-msg message]  [--nondataset-path-status  LABEL]  [--no-parentds-

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Given paths (or more generally location requests) are inspected and annotated with a  number  of  proper‐
       ties. A list of recognized properties is provided below.

   <b>Recognized</b> <b>path</b> <b>properties</b>
       "action"
         label of the action that triggered the path annotation

       "annexkey"
         annex key for the content of a file

       "logger"
         logger for reporting a message

       "message"
         message (plus possible tsring expansion arguments)

       "orig_request"
         original input by which a path was determined

       "parentds"
         path of dataset containing the annotated path (superdataset
         for subdatasets)

       "path"
         absolute path that is annotated

       "process_content"
         flag that content underneath the path is to be processed

       "process_updated_only"
         flag that only known dataset components are to be processed

       "raw_input"
         flag whether this path was given as raw (non-annotated) input

       "refds"
         path of a reference/base dataset the annotated path is part of

       "registered_subds"
         flag whether a dataset is known to be a true subdataset of
         PARENTDS

       "revision"
         the recorded commit for a subdataset in a superdataset

       "revision_descr"
         a human-readable description of REVISION

       "source_url"
         URL a dataset was installed from

       "staged"
         flag whether a path is known to be "staged" in its containing
         dataset

       "state"
         state indicator for a path in its containing dataset (clean,
         modified, absent (also for files), conflict)

       "status"
         action result status (ok, notneeded, impossible, error)

       "type"
         nature of the path (file, directory, dataset)

       "url"
         registered URL for a subdataset in a superdataset

       In the case of enabled modification detection the results may contain additional properties regarding the
       nature of the modification. See the documentation of the DIFF command for details.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       PATH   path to be annotated. Constraints: value must be a string

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>, <b>--help-np</b>
              show  this  help message. --help-np forcefully disables the use of a pager for displaying the help
              message

       <b>-d</b> <u>DATASET</u>, <b>--dataset</b> <u>DATASET</u>
              an optional reference/base dataset for the paths. Constraints: Value must be a Dataset or a  valid
              identifier of a Dataset (e.g. a path)

       <b>-r</b>, <b>--recursive</b>
              if set, recurse into potential subdataset.

       <b>-R</b> LEVELS, <b>--recursion-limit</b> LEVELS
              limit recursion into subdataset to the given number of levels. Constraints: value must be convert‐
              ible to type 'int'

       <b>--action</b> LABEL
              an "action" property value to include in the path annotation. Constraints: value must be a string

       <b>--unavailable-path-status</b> LABEL
              a  "status"  property  value to include in the annotation for paths that are underneath a dataset,
              but do not exist on the filesystem. Constraints: value must be a string [Default: '']

       <b>--unavailable-path-msg</b> message
              a "message" property value to include in the annotation for paths that are underneath  a  dataset,
              but do not exist on the filesystem. Constraints: value must be a string

       <b>--nondataset-path-status</b> LABEL
              a  "status"  property  value  to  include  in the annotation for paths that are not underneath any
              dataset. Constraints: value must be a string [Default: 'error']

       <b>--no-parentds-discovery</b>
              Flag to disable reports of parent dataset information for any path,  in  particular  dataset  root
              paths. Disabling saves on command run time, if this information is not needed.

       <b>--no-subds-discovery</b>
              Flag  to  disable  reporting  type='dataset' for subdatasets, even when they are not installed, or
              their mount point directory doesn't exist. Disabling saves on command run time, if  this  informa‐
              tion is not needed.

       <b>--revision-change-discovery</b>
              Flag  to disable discovery of changes which were not yet committed. Disabling saves on command run
              time, if this information is not needed.

       <b>--no-untracked-discovery</b>
              Flag to disable discovery of untracked changes. Disabling saves on command run time, if  this  in‐
              formation is not needed.

       <b>--modified</b> [<u>MODIFIED</u>]
              comparison  reference specification for modification detection. This can be (mostly) anything that
              `git diff` understands (commit, treeish, tag, etc). See the documentation of `datalad diff --revi‐
              sion` for details. Unmodified paths will not be annotated. If a requested path  was  not  modified
              but  some  content underneath it was, then the request is replaced by the modified paths and those
              are annotated instead. This option can be used without an argument to test  against  changes  that
              have been made, but have not yet been staged for a commit. Constraints: value must be a string, or
              value must be convertible to type bool

       <b>--version</b>
              show the module and its version which provides the command
