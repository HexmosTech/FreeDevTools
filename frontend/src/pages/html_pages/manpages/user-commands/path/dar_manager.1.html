</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>dar_manager</b>  is  part  of  the Disk Archive suite. Its purpose is to simplify the restoration of a set of
       files present in many backup, full or differential, eventually composed of a set of binary delta patches.
       This is achieved by gathering the catalogue of each archive (this has to be done once). Then, at any time
       you just have to give the relative path to the files you want to restore, dar_manager will call dar  with
       the  proper  options  and  restore the last version of each file (or the last version before given date).
       Note that dar_manager is especially interesting when you have removed some files by  accident  some  time
       ago  and  wish  to  recover  them  from  a  set  of  full and differential backups. It is thus not really
       adapted/efficient to restore the state a full system had at a given time, in particular when  some  files
       have  to  be  removed. For that you would better use dar directly with the corresponding archive(s) up to
       the date for which you wish to restore the state of your Unix system.

       You can restore any file by hand without <b>dar_manager</b> , but if you have a lot of differential backups, you
       may spend a long time to find the archive that contains the last  version  of  your  files.   <b>dar_manager</b>
       simplify  the  process  by  looking in its internal database, built from archive "catalogues" (= table of
       contents) it has been fed with.

</pre><h4><b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       -C, --create [&lt;path&gt;/]&lt;database&gt;
                           creates an empty database that will collect information about several  archives.  The
                           &lt;database&gt; is a filename that is required for -B option. To destroy a &lt;database&gt; just
                           remove the file.

       -B, --base [&lt;path&gt;/]&lt;database&gt;
                           specify  the  database  to read or modify. The &lt;database&gt; file must exist, and have a
                           database structure (see -C option).

       -i, --interactive   use a keyboard interactive text menu to do operations on the given database.  So  you
                           may  avoid  reading the other options described in this manual page, if you wish, and
                           just use the interactive option. You will however always  have  to  create  an  empty
                           database (-C option) and restore files manually (-r option).

       -A, --add [&lt;path&gt;/]&lt;basename&gt; [ [&lt;path&gt;/]&lt;archive_basename&gt;]
                           add an archive to the database. An isolated catalogue can also be used only if it has
                           been  produced  by  dar  version 1.2.0 or above. Why ? Because, an isolated catalogue
                           produced by older version will always tell that no files are saved in the archive  of
                           reference, in that case the solution is to provide the archive itself as argument. An
                           optional  second  argument is the basename of the archive if it is different from the
                           first argument (need for extraction of files). For example you could have an isolated
                           catalogue in first argument and the basename of the original archive (where is stored
                           the data) as second argument. By default,

       -9, --min-digits &lt;num&gt;
                           the slice number zeroed padding to use to get the slices filename (for  more  details
                           see  dar  man  page  at  this  same  option)  <b>dar_manager</b> will look for an archive of
                           reference in the command line used to create each archive, but in some cases, it  may
                           be necessary to specify the archive name (for example if you've changed its name).

       -l, --list          displays  the information about the archives compiled in the database. In particular,
                           a number is given to each archive, which is required to some other option to design a
                           particular archive within the database. Nothing avoids you to feed the database  with
                           several archive of the same basename ! You will just have to guess which one is asked
                           under this name. :-)

       -D, --delete &lt;number&gt;[-&lt;number&gt;]
                           removes  an  archive  (or  a  range  of archive) from the database. The number of the
                           archive (or the min and max number or the archive range) is correspond to those given
                           by the -l option. Note that all archive number greater than the one(s) to  be  delete
                           will  be decremented to keep continuous numbering of the archive inside the database.
                           If a single number is given (not a range), it may be also a negative number, by which
                           it means counting from the end. For example, -1 means the last archive of  the  base,
                           -2 the penultimate, etc.

       -b, --basename &lt;number&gt; &lt;new_archive_basename&gt;
                           this option allows you to rename the archive basename (used when restoring files from
                           it). Here too, the number may be also a negative number.

       -p, --path &lt;number&gt; &lt;path&gt;
                           this option allows you to change the location of a given archive (used when restoring
                           files from it). Here too, a negative number is allowed.

       -o, --options [list of option to pass to dar]
                           Specify  the  option  to use when calling dar. Each call erases the previous setting.
                           Possible <b>dar</b> options are all the available ones except  "-x"   and  simple  arguments
                           (the [list of path]) which will be added by <b>dar_manager</b> itself.

       -d, --dar [&lt;path&gt;]  Set  the  path  to dar. If no argument is given, dar is expected to be located in the
                           PATH

       -r, --restore [list of files or directories to restore]
                           <b>dar_manager</b> will restore all (an only) the  given  files  or  directories,  in  their
                           latest  recorded  status,  or  before  the  date  give  thanks to the -e option. If a
                           directory is given all subfiles and subdirectories are restored  recursively  in  it.
                           You  can  filter  out  some  files  from this recursion thanks to dar usual filtering
                           option (see dar man page) you can provide beside -r using the -e option (see  below).
                           Dar_manager  lead  dar to remove any file, if a file is stored as having been removed
                           at date requested for restoration, it is simply not restored. Thus if you restore  in
                           an  empty  directory  you  will  get  all  the  files and directories you provided to
                           dar_manager in the state they have at the date you asked. File that did  not  existed
                           at  that  time  will  not  be  restored.  However  you  can  restore over an existing
                           installation, dar will then warn you before overwriting files (see -w and -n  options
                           for  dar)  but will still not remove files that were recorded removed from a previous
                           archive of reference.  Note that files listed after -r option,  must  never  have  an
                           absolute  path. They will be restored under the directory specified with -R option of
                           dar (passed to dar using -o  or  -e  options),  or  by  default,  under  the  current
                           directory.

       -w, --when &lt;date&gt;   alters  the  -r  option behavior: still restores the files in the most recent version
                           available but only before the given date (versions of more recent dates are ignored).
                           The     &lt;date&gt;     must     respect      the      following      format      [      [
                           [year/]month/]day-]hour:minute[:second]. For example "22:10" for 10 PM past 10 or the
                           current  day,  "7-22:10" for 10 PM past 10 the 7th of the current month, "3/07-22:10"
                           for the 7th of march at 22:10 of the current year, "2002/03/31-14:00:00" the date  of
                           the  first  dar's  release ;-). The given date must be in the past, of course, and is
                           compared to the "last modification" date of the saved files and not to  the  date  at
                           which  archives have been done. Thus if a file has been changed long ago but saved in
                           a recent (full) archive, it will be elected for restoration even for dates older than
                           the creation of the archive. In the other way, a file saved  long  time  ago  with  a
                           mtime  that  was set to a date in the future will not be elected for restoration when
                           giving the date at which was done the archive.

              Note that the provided date is relative to the system  timezone  which  is  overriden  if  the  TZ
              environement variable is set (see <a href="../man1/tzselect.1.html">tzselect</a>(1) for more details)

       -e, --extra &lt;options&gt;
                           pass  some  more  options  to dar. While the -o options takes all that follows on the
                           command line as argument to pass to dar and write  these  in  the  database,  the  -e
                           option  does not alter the database and has only one argument. In other words, if you
                           need to pass several options to dar through the use of the -e option, you need to use
                           quotes (simple quotes ' or double quotes ") to enclose these options. Example:

                     dar_manager -B database.dmd -e "-w -v -p -b -r -H 1" -r some/files

              while using -o option you must not use quotes:

                     dar_manager -B database.dmd -o -w -v -p -b -r -H 1

       -u, --used &lt;number&gt; list the files that the given archive owns as last version available.  Thus  when  no
                           file  is  listed, the given archive is no more useful in database, and can be removed
                           safely (-D option). If &lt;number&gt; is zero, all available file are  listed,  the  status
                           provided  for each file present in the database is the most recent status. A negative
                           number is allowed for this option (see -D option for details).

       -f, --file &lt;file&gt;   displays in which archive the given file is saved, and what are the modification date
                           (mtime) and change date (ctime).

       -s, --stats         show the number of most recent files  by  archive.  This  helps  to  determine  which
                           archive can be safely removed from the database.

       -m, --move &lt;number&gt; &lt;number&gt;
                           changes  the order of archives in the database. The first number is the number of the
                           archive to move, while the second is the place where it must be shifted to.

                           Archive order is important: An old archive must have a smaller index  than  a  recent
                           archive.  If  you  add  archive to a database in the order they have been created all
                           should be fine. Else if a file has a more recent version in an archive which index is
                           smaller, a warning will be issued (unless -ai option is used). This can occur  if  by
                           mistake  you  added  an archive to the database in the wrong order (old archive added
                           after a recent one), in that case simply using the -m option will let  you  fix  this
                           mistake.  If  instead  the  problem  is  relative to a single file (or a small set of
                           file), you should wonder why this file has its modification date  altered  in  a  way
                           that  it pretends to be older than its really is. Checking for the signs of a rootkit
                           may be a good idea.

       -c, --check         check the database consistency, in particular  the  date  ordering  is  verified  and
                           warning  are  issued  for  each file having more recent version located in an archive
                           with a smaller index inside the database. -ai option makes -c option useless.

       -N, --ignore-options-in-base
                           Do not use the options stored in database when  calling  dar  for  restoration.  This
                           option  is  only  useful  while restoring files from dar_manager, either directly (-r
                           option) or using a batch file (-@ option, see below).

       -k, --ignore-when-removed
                           By default, dar_manager does not ask dar to restore file that have  been  removed  at
                           the  requested date (or in the latest state available). This is useful for example to
                           restore a directory in the state it has at a given date (only files that  existed  at
                           that  time  are  restored).  However  when  you  want to restore a file that has been
                           destroyed by accident, you need to use -k option so you don't have  to  determine  at
                           which date that file existed to be be able to ask dar_manager to restore that file in
                           the  state  it  had  before  that date. In other words, -k option gives a behavior of
                           dar_manager backward compatible with dar_manager released  beside  version  2.3.x  of
                           dar.

       -ai, --alter=ignore-order
                           avoid  dar_manager  to  issue  a  warning for each file not following a chronological
                           order of modification date when the archive number in the database is growing.

       -@, --batch &lt;filename&gt;
                           allows you to do several operations on a given database. All operations  are  defined
                           in the provided &lt;filename&gt; and refer to the same database as defined by the -B switch
                           on  command  line.  This  batch file, must thus not contain neither -B, -C, -i or -ai
                           option (-ai are global to the batch operation). The batch file expected layout is one
                           command per line, thus several arguments (like -l -v for example) may take place on a
                           given line of the file (-v can be found both on command line for verbose output about
                           the batch operation steps, as well as inside the batch file for verbose output  of  a
                           particular  batched  command).  Arguments  are  separated  by  spaces  or tabs, other
                           characters are passed as-is. In consequence, you  should  only  need  to  use  quotes
                           (using  " or ') if you intend to use an argument containing space. Last, comments may
                           be placed on any line beginning by a hash character (#).

       -z, --compression &lt;algo&gt;[:&lt;level&gt;]
                           Available creating or modifying a database content (-C, -A, -D, -m, -i, -L  options),
                           this  option  let  you  set  the compression algorithm and eventually the compression
                           level to use when the database is wrote to file. By default gzip:9 is  use,  but  you
                           can  use  "none"  for  no  compression, "bzip2", "xz" and "lzo" and other compression
                           algorithms (see -z option in dar's man page for an  up  to  date  list  of  available
                           algorithms). Note: this option is only needed if you want to *change* the compression
                           algorithm  or  level. Once defined, either at database creation time using -C option,
                           or modified afterward, the compression scheme is stored in the  database  header  and
                           used for writing down database back to file.

       -Q                  Do  not  display any message on stderr when not launched from a terminal (for example
                           when launched from an at job or crontab). Remains that any question to the user  will
                           be assumed a 'no' answer, which most of the time will abort the program.

       -v, --verbose       displays additional information about what it is doing.

       -h, --help          display help usage

       -V, --version       display software version

                 <b>dar</b>
                  called  from dar_manager has exited with non zero status. Subtract 10 to this exit code to get
                 dar's exit code.

</pre><h4><b>SIGNALS</b></h4><pre>
       dar_manager acts like dar (see dar man page for list of  signals),  upon  certain  signal  reception  dar
       aborts cleanly

</pre><h4><b>LIMITATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       at  most  65534  archives  can  be  compiled  in a given database, which should be enough for most users.
       Dar_manager does not support encrypted archives for now and archive cannot neither be encrypted. See  the
       FAQ for a workaround.
