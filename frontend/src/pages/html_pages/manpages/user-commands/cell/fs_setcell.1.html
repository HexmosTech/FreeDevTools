       fs_setcell - Configures permissions for setuid programs from specified cells

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>fs</b> <b>setcell</b> <b>-cell</b> &lt;<u>cell</u> <u>name</u>&gt;+ [<b>-suid</b>] [<b>-nosuid</b>] [<b>-help</b>]

       <b>fs</b> <b>setce</b> <b>-c</b> &lt;<u>cell</u> <u>name</u>&gt;+ [<b>-s</b>] [<b>-n</b>] [<b>-h</b>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>fs</b> <b>setcell</b> command sets whether the Cache Manager allows programs (and other executable files) from
       each cell named by the <b>-cell</b> argument to run with setuid permission. By default, the Cache Manager allows
       programs from its home cell to run with setuid permission, but not programs from any foreign cells. A
       program belongs to the same cell as the file server machine that houses the volume in which the program's
       binary file resides, as specified in the file server machine's <u>/etc/openafs/server/ThisCell</u> file. The
       Cache Manager determines its own home cell by reading the <u>/etc/openafs/ThisCell</u> file at initialization.

       To enable programs from each specified cell to run with setuid permission, include the <b>-suid</b> flag. To
       prohibit programs from running with setuid permission, include the <b>-nosuid</b> flag, or omit both flags.

       The <b>fs</b> <b>setcell</b> command directly alters a cell's setuid status as recorded in kernel memory, so rebooting
       the machine is unnecessary.  However, non-default settings do not persist across reboots of the machine
       unless the appropriate <b>fs</b> <b>setcell</b> command appears in the machine's AFS initialization file.

       To display a cell's setuid status, issue the <b>fs</b> <b>getcellstatus</b> command.

</pre><h4><b>CAUTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       AFS does not recognize effective UID: if a setuid program accesses AFS files and directories, it does so
       using the current AFS identity of the AFS user who initialized the program, not of the program's owner.
       Only the local file system recognizes effective UID.

       Only members of the system:administrators group can turn on the setuid mode bit on an AFS file or
       directory.

       When the setuid mode bit is turned on, the UNIX "ls -l" command displays the third user mode bit as an
       "s" instead of an "x". However, the "s" does not appear on an AFS file or directory unless setuid
       permission is enabled for the cell in which the file resides.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-cell</b> &lt;<u>cell</u> <u>name</u>&gt;+
           Names  each  cell  for  which  to  set  setuid  status. Provide the fully qualified domain name, or a
           shortened form that disambiguates it from the other cells listed in the local <u>/etc/openafs/CellServDB</u>
           file.

       <b>-suid</b>
           Allows programs from each specified cell to run with setuid privilege.  Provide  it  or  the  <b>-nosuid</b>
           flag, or omit both flags to disallow programs from running with setuid privilege.

       <b>-nosuid</b>
           Prevents  programs  from  each  specified  cell from running with setuid privilege. Provide it or the
           <b>-suid</b> flag, or omit both flags to disallow programs form running with setuid privilege.

       <b>-help</b>
           Prints the online help for this command. All other valid options are ignored.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       The following command enables executable files from the Example Organization  cell  to  run  with  setuid
       privilege on the local machine:

          % fs setcell -cell example.org -suid

</pre><h4><b>PRIVILEGE</b> <b>REQUIRED</b></h4><pre>
       The issuer must be logged in as the local superuser root.
