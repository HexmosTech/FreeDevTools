       &lt;!-- AUTOGENERATED USAGE DESCRIPTIONS --&gt;

</pre><h4><b>Description</b></h4><pre>
       This command shows data about a package and prints it to stdout.

       As an example, to view information about the <b>connect</b> package from the registry, you would run:
         npm view connect

       The default version is <b>&amp;quot;latest&amp;quot;</b> if unspecified.

       Field names can be specified after the package descriptor.
       For example, to show the dependencies of the <b>ronn</b> package at version
       <b>0.3.5</b>, you could do the following:
         npm view <a href="mailto:ronn@0.3.5">ronn@0.3.5</a> dependencies

       You can view child fields by separating them with a period.
       To view the git repository URL for the latest version of <b>npm</b>, you would run the following command:
         npm view npm repository.url

       This makes it easy to view information about a dependency with a bit of
       shell scripting. For example, to view all the data about the version of
       <b>opts</b> that <b>ronn</b> depends on, you could write the following:
         npm view opts@$(npm view ronn dependencies.opts)

       For fields that are arrays, requesting a non-numeric field will return
       all of the values from the objects in the list. For example, to get all
       the contributor email addresses for the <b>express</b> package, you would run:
         npm view express contributors.email

       You may also use numeric indices in square braces to specifically select
       an item in an array field. To just get the email address of the first
       contributor in the list, you can run:
         npm view express contributors[0].email

       If the field value you are querying for is a property of an object, you should run:
         npm view express time'[4.8.0]'

       Multiple fields may be specified, and will be printed one after another.
       For example, to get all the contributor names and email addresses, you
       can do this:
         npm view express contributors.name contributors.email

       "Person" fields are shown as a string if they would be shown as an
       object.  So, for example, this will show the list of <b>npm</b> contributors in
       the shortened string format.  (See <b>package.json</b> for more on this.)
         npm view npm contributors

       If a version range is provided, then data will be printed for every
       matching version of the package.  This will show which version of <b>jsdom</b>
       was required by each matching version of <b>yui3</b>:
         npm view yui3@'&gt;0.5.4' dependencies.jsdom

       To show the <b>connect</b> package version history, you can do
       this:
         npm view connect versions

</pre><h4><b>Configuration</b></h4><pre>
       &lt;!-- AUTOGENERATED CONFIG DESCRIPTIONS --&gt;

</pre><h4><b>Output</b></h4><pre>
       If only a single string field for a single version is output, then it
       will not be colorized or quoted, to enable piping the output to
       another command. If the field is an object, it will be output as a JavaScript object literal.

       If the <b>--json</b> flag is given, the outputted fields will be JSON.

       If the version range matches multiple versions then each printed value
       will be prefixed with the version it applies to.

       If multiple fields are requested, then each of them is prefixed with
       the field name.
