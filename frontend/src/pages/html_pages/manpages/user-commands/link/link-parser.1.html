       link-parser - parse natural language sentences using Link Grammar

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>link-parser</b> --help
       <b>link-parser</b> --version
       <b>link-parser</b> <b>[</b><u>language</u><b>|</b><u>dict_location</u><b>]</b> [--quiet] <b>[</b><u>-&lt;special_"!"_command&gt;</u><b>...]</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>link-parser</b>  is  the  command-line  wrapper  to  the link-grammar natural language parsing library.  This
       library will parse sentences written in English, Russian and other languages,  generating  linkage  trees
       showing  relationships  between  the  subject,  the  verb,  and  various adjectives, adverbs, etc. in the
       sentence.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLE</b></h4><pre>
       <b>link-parser</b>

       Starts the parser interactive shell.  Enter any sentence to parse:

       linkparser&gt; <b>Reading</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>page</b> <b>is</b> <b>informative.</b>

       Found 18 linkages (18 had no P.P. violations)

</pre><h4><b>BACKGROUND</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>link-parser</b> command-line tool is useful for general exploration and  use,  although  it  is  presumed
       that,  for  the  parsing of large quantities of text, developers will create a custom application, making
       use of the link-grammar library.  Several such applications are described on the Link  Grammar  web  page
       (see SEE ALSO below).

       The  theory  of Link Grammar is explained in many academic papers.  In the first of these, Daniel Sleator
       and Davy Temperley, "Parsing English with a Link Grammar"  (1991),  the  authors  defined  a  new  formal
       grammatical  system  called a "link grammar". A sequence of words is in the language of a link grammar if
       there is a way to draw "links" between words in such a way that the local requirements of each  word  are
       satisfied,  the  links do not cross, and the words form a consistent connected graph. The authors encoded
       English grammar into such a system, and wrote <b>link-parser</b> to parse English using this grammar.

       The engine that performs the parsing is separate from the dictionaries describing a language.  Currently,
       the most fully developed, complete dictionaries are for  the  English  and  Russian  languages,  although
       experimental, incomplete dictionaries exist for German and eight other languages.

</pre><h4><b>OVERVIEW</b></h4><pre>
       <b>link-parser</b>,  when  invoked  manually,  starts an interactive shell, taking control of the terminal.  Any
       lines beginning with an exclamation mark are assumed to be  a  "special  command";  these  are  described
       below.   The  command  <b>!help</b> will provide more info; the command <b>!variables</b> will print all of the special
       commands.  These are also called "variables", as almost all commands have a value associated  with  them:
       the command typically enable or disable some function, or they alter some multi-valued setting.

       All  other  input  is treated as a single, English-language sentence; it is parsed, and the result of the
       parse is printed.  The variables control what is printed:   By  default,  an  ASCII-graphics  linkage  is
       printed,  although post-script output is also possible.  The printing of the constituent tree can also be
       enabled. Other output controls include the printing of disjuncts and complete link data.

       In order to analyze sentences, <b>link-parser</b> depends on a link-grammar dictionary.  This contains lists  of
       words  and  associated  metadata  about  their grammatical properties.  An English language dictionary is
       provided by default.  If other language dictionaries are installed in the default search locations, these
       may be explicitly specified by means of a 2-letter ISO language code: so, for example:

           <b>link-parser</b> <b>de</b>

       will start the parser shell with the German dictionary.

       Alternately, the dictionary location can be specified explicitly with either an absolute  or  a  relative
       file path; so, for example:

           <b>link-parser</b> <b>/usr/share/link-grammar/en</b>

       will run <b>link-parser</b> using the English dictionary located in the typical install directory.

       <b>link-parser</b>  can  also  be used in a non-interactive mode ("batch mode") via the <b>-batch</b> option (a special
       command, see below): So, for example:

           <b>cat</b> <b>thesis.txt</b> <b>|</b> <b>link-parser</b> <b>-batch</b>

       will read lines from the file <b>thesis.txt</b>, processing each one as a complete sentence. For sentences  that
       don't have a full parse, it will print
       <b>+++++</b> <b>error</b> <b>N</b>
       (<b>N</b> is a number) to the standard output.

       Alternately, an input file may be specified with the <b>!file</b> <u>filename</u> special command, described below.

       Note that using "batch mode" disables the usual ASCII-graphics linkage printing. The input sentences also
       don't  appear  by  default  on  stdout.   These  features may be re-enabled via special commands; special
       commands may be interspersed with the input.

       Instead of specifying <b>-batch</b> in the command-line, <b>!batch</b> can be specified in the said input file.

       For more details, use <b>!help</b> <b>batch</b> in <b>link-parser</b>'s interactive shell.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--help</b> Print usage and exit.

       <b>--version</b>
              Print program version and configuration details, and exit.

       <b>--quiet</b>
              Suppress the version messages on startup.

   <b>Special</b> <b>!</b> <b>commands</b>
       The special "!" commands can be specified as command-line options in  the  command-line,  or  within  the
       interactive shell itself by prefixing them with "!" on line start.  The full option name does not need to
       be used; only enough letters to make the option unique must be specified.

       When specifying as a command-line option, a special command is proceeded by "-" instead of "!".

       Boolean  variables  may  be  toggled  simply  by giving the <b>!</b><u>varname</u>, for example, <b>!batch</b>.  Setting other
       variables require using an equals sign: <u>!varname=value</u>, for example, <b>!width=100</b>.

       The <b>!help</b> command prints general help. When issued from the interactive shell, it can  get  an  argument,
       usually  a  special  command.   The  <b>!variables</b> command prints all of the current variable settings.  The
       <b>!file</b> command reads input from its argument file.  The <b>!file</b> command is <u>not</u> a variable; it cannot be set.
       It can be used repeatedly.

       The <b>!exit</b> command instructs <b>link-parser</b> to exit.

       The exclamation mark "!" is also a special command by itself, used to inspect the  dictionary  entry  for
       any given word (optionally terminated by a subscript).  Thus two exclamation marks are needed before such
       a  word when doing so from the interactive shell. The wildcard character "*" can be specified as the last
       character of the word in order to find multiple matches.

       Default values of the special commands below are shown in parenthesis. Most of them are the default  ones
       of the link-grammar library.
       Boolean default values are shown as <b>on</b> (1) or <b>off</b> (0).

       <b>!bad</b> (off)
              Enable display of bad linkages.

       <b>!batch</b> (off)
              Enable batch mode.

       <b>!constituents</b> (0)
              Generate constituent output. Its value may be:

              0      Disabled

              1      Treebank-style constituent tree

              2      Flat, bracketed tree [A like [B this B] A]

              3      Flat, treebank-style tree (A like (B this))

       <b>!cost-max</b> (2.7)
              Largest cost to be considered.

       <b>!dialect</b> (no value)
              Use the specified (comma-separated) names.
              They  modify  the  disjunct  cost  of  dictionary  words  whose  expressions contain symbolic cost
              specifications.

       <b>!disjuncts</b> (off)
              Display of disjuncts used.

       <b>!echo</b> (off)
              Echo input sentence.

       <b>!graphics</b> (on)
              Enable graphical display of linkage.  For each linkage, the  sentence  is  printed  along  with  a
              graphical representation of its linkage above it.

              The following notations are used for words in the sentence:

              [word] A word with no linkage.

              word[?].x
                     An unknown word whose POS category x has been found by the parser.

              word[!]
                     An  unknown  word  whose  link-grammar dictionary entry has been assigned by a RegEx.  (Use
                     !morphology=1 to see the said dictionary entry.)

              word[~]
                     There was an unknown word in this position, and it has got replaced, using  a  spell  guess
                     with this word, that is found in the link-grammar dictionary.

              word[&amp;]
                     This word is a part of an unknown word which has been found to consist of two or more words
                     that are in the link-grammar dictionary.

              word.POS
                     This word found in the dictionary as word.POS.

              word.#CORRECTION
                     This word is probably a typo - got linked as an alternative word CORRECTION.

              For dictionaries that support morphology (enable with !morphology=1):

              word=  A prefix morpheme

              =word  A suffix morpheme

              word.= A stem

       <b>!islands-ok</b> (on)
              Use null-linked islands.

       <b>!limit</b> (1000)
              Limit the maximum linkages processed.

       <b>!links</b> (off)
              Enable display of complete link data.

       <b>!null</b> (on)
              Allow null links.

       <b>!morphology</b> (off)
              Display word morphology.  When a word matches a RegEx, show the matching dictionary entry.

       <b>!panic</b> (on)
              Use "panic mode" if a parse cannot be quickly found.
              The command <b>!panic_variables</b> prints the special variables that are used only in "panic mode".

       <b>!postscript</b> (off)
              Generate postscript output.

       <b>!short</b> (16)
              Maximum length of short links.

       <b>!spell</b> (7)
              If zero, no spell and run-on corrections of unknown words are performed.
              Else,  use  up  to  this  many  spell-guesses per unknown word. In that case, the number of run-on
              corrections (word split) of unknown words is not limited.

       <b>!timeout</b> (30)
              Abort parsing after this many seconds.

       <b>!use-sat</b> (off)
              Use Boolean SAT-based parser.

       <b>!verbosity</b> (1)
              Level of detail in output. Some useful values:

              0      No prompt, minimal library messages

              1      Normal verbosity

              2      Show times of the parsing steps

              3      Display some more information messages

              4      Display data file search and locale setup

              5-9    Tokenizer and parser debugging

              10-19  Dictionary debugging

              101    Print all the dictionary connectors, along with their length limit

       <b>!walls</b> (off)
              Display wall words.

       <b>!width</b> (16381)(*)
              The width of the display.
              * When writing to a terminal, this value is set from its width.

       <b>!wordgraph</b> (0)
              Display the wordgraph (word-split graph).

              0      Disabled

              1      Default display

              2      Display parent tokens as subgraphs

              3      Use esoteric display flags as set by !test=wg:FLAGS

       command-help-<u>LL</u>.txt <b>or</b> command-help-<u>LL-CC</u>.txt
              Help text for the <b>!help</b> <u>topic</u> special "!" command.   If  several  such  files  are  provided,  the
              desired  one can be selected by e.g. the LANGUAGE environment variable if it is set to <u>LL</u> or <u>LL-CC</u>
              (default is <b>en</b>). Currently only <b>command-help-en.txt</b> is provided.

       The directory search order for these files is:
              • <u>./</u>
              • <u>data/</u>
              • <u>../</u>
              • <u>../data/</u>
              •  A custom data directory, as set by the API call <b>dictionary_set_data_dir()</b>.
              •  Installation-depended system data directory (*)

              * This location is displayed  as  DICTIONARY_DIR  when  the  <b>--version</b>  argument  is  provided  to
              <b>link-parser</b>  on  the  command  line.   On  windows  it  may  be  relative  to  the location of the
              link-grammar library DLL; in that case the actual location is displayed as "System data directory"
              when <b>link-parser</b> is invoked with -verbosity=4.

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>link-generator</b> command can be used to generate random sentences from a given dictionary.

       Information on the link-grammar shared-library API and the link types used in the parse is  available  at
       the Link Grammar website.

       Peer-reviewed papers explaining Link Grammar can be found at original CMU site.

       The source code of <b>link-parser</b> and the link-grammar library is located at GitHub.

       The mailing list for Link Grammar discussion is at link-grammar Google group.
