</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       ld - The GNU linker

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       ld [<b>options</b>] <u>objfile</u> ...

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ld</b> combines a number of object and archive files, relocates their data and ties up symbol references.
       Usually the last step in compiling a program is to run <b>ld</b>.

       <b>ld</b> accepts Linker Command Language files written in a superset of AT&amp;T's Link Editor Command Language
       syntax, to provide explicit and total control over the linking process.

       This man page does not describe the command language; see the <b>ld</b> entry in "info" for full details on the
       command language and on other aspects of the GNU linker.

       This version of <b>ld</b> uses the general purpose BFD libraries to operate on object files. This allows <b>ld</b> to
       read, combine, and write object files in many different formats---for example, COFF or "a.out".
       Different formats may be linked together to produce any available kind of object file.

       Aside from its flexibility, the GNU linker is more helpful than other linkers in providing diagnostic
       information.  Many linkers abandon execution immediately upon encountering an error; whenever possible,
       <b>ld</b> continues executing, allowing you to identify other errors (or, in some cases, to get an output file
       in spite of the error).

       The GNU linker <b>ld</b> is meant to cover a broad range of situations, and to be as compatible as possible with
       other linkers.  As a result, you have many choices to control its behavior.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The linker supports a plethora of command-line options, but in actual practice few of them are used in
       any particular context.  For instance, a frequent use of <b>ld</b> is to link standard Unix object files on a
       standard, supported Unix system.  On such a system, to link a file "hello.o":

               ld -o &lt;output&gt; /lib/crt0.o hello.o -lc

       This tells <b>ld</b> to produce a file called <u>output</u> as the result of linking the file "/lib/crt0.o" with
       "hello.o" and the library "libc.a", which will come from the standard search directories.  (See the
       discussion of the <b>-l</b> option below.)

       Some of the command-line options to <b>ld</b> may be specified at any point in the command line.  However,
       options which refer to files, such as <b>-l</b> or <b>-T</b>, cause the file to be read at the point at which the
       option appears in the command line, relative to the object files and other file options.  Repeating non-
       file options with a different argument will either have no further effect, or override prior occurrences
       (those further to the left on the command line) of that option.  Options which may be meaningfully
       specified more than once are noted in the descriptions below.

       Non-option arguments are object files or archives which are to be linked together.  They may follow,
       precede, or be mixed in with command-line options, except that an object file argument may not be placed
       between an option and its argument.

       Usually the linker is invoked with at least one object file, but you can specify other forms of binary
       input files using <b>-l</b>, <b>-R</b>, and the script command language.  If <u>no</u> binary input files at all are
       specified, the linker does not produce any output, and issues the message <b>No</b> <b>input</b> <b>files</b>.

       If the linker cannot recognize the format of an object file, it will assume that it is a linker script.
       A script specified in this way augments the main linker script used for the link (either the default
       linker script or the one specified by using <b>-T</b>).  This feature permits the linker to link against a file
       which appears to be an object or an archive, but actually merely defines some symbol values, or uses
       "INPUT" or "GROUP" to load other objects.  Specifying a script in this way merely augments the main
       linker script, with the extra commands placed after the main script; use the <b>-T</b> option to replace the
       default linker script entirely, but note the effect of the "INSERT" command.

       For options whose names are a single letter, option arguments must either follow the option letter
       without intervening whitespace, or be given as separate arguments immediately following the option that
       requires them.

       For options whose names are multiple letters, either one dash or two can precede the option name; for
       example, <b>-trace-symbol</b> and <b>--trace-symbol</b> are equivalent.  Note---there is one exception to this rule.
       Multiple letter options that start with a lower case 'o' can only be preceded by two dashes.  This is to
       reduce confusion with the <b>-o</b> option.  So for example <b>-omagic</b> sets the output file name to <b>magic</b> whereas
       <b>--omagic</b> sets the NMAGIC flag on the output.

       Arguments to multiple-letter options must either be separated from the option name by an equals sign, or
       be given as separate arguments immediately following the option that requires them.  For example,
       <b>--trace-symbol</b> <b>foo</b> and <b>--trace-symbol=foo</b> are equivalent.  Unique abbreviations of the names of multiple-
       letter options are accepted.

       Note---if the linker is being invoked indirectly, via a compiler driver (e.g. <b>gcc</b>) then all the linker
       command line options should be prefixed by <b>-Wl,</b> (or whatever is appropriate for the particular compiler
       driver) like this:

                 gcc -Wl,--start-group foo.o bar.o -Wl,--end-group

       This is important, because otherwise the compiler driver program may silently drop the linker options,
       resulting in a bad link.  Confusion may also arise when passing options that require values through a
       driver, as the use of a space between option and argument acts as a separator, and causes the driver to
       pass only the option to the linker and the argument to the compiler.  In this case, it is simplest to use
       the joined forms of both single- and multiple-letter options, such as:

                 gcc foo.o bar.o -Wl,-eENTRY -Wl,-Map=a.map

       Here is a table of the generic command line switches accepted by the GNU linker:

       <b>@</b><u>file</u>
           Read  command-line  options  from <u>file</u>.  The options read are inserted in place of the original @<u>file</u>
           option.  If <u>file</u> does not exist, or cannot be read, then the option will be  treated  literally,  and
           not removed.

           Options  in <u>file</u> are separated by whitespace.  A whitespace character may be included in an option by
           surrounding the entire option in  either  single  or  double  quotes.   Any  character  (including  a
           backslash)  may be included by prefixing the character to be included with a backslash.  The <u>file</u> may
           itself contain additional @<u>file</u> options; any such options will be processed recursively.

       <b>-a</b> <u>keyword</u>
           This option is supported for HP/UX compatibility.  The <u>keyword</u> argument must be one  of  the  strings
           <b>archive</b>,  <b>shared</b>,  or  <b>default</b>.   <b>-aarchive</b> is functionally equivalent to <b>-Bstatic</b>, and the other two
           keywords are functionally equivalent to <b>-Bdynamic</b>.  This option may be used any number of times.

       <b>--audit</b> <u>AUDITLIB</u>
           Adds <u>AUDITLIB</u> to the "DT_AUDIT" entry of the dynamic section.  <u>AUDITLIB</u> is not checked for existence,
           nor will it use the DT_SONAME specified in the library.  If specified multiple times "DT_AUDIT"  will
           contain  a  colon  separated  list  of audit interfaces to use. If the linker finds an object with an
           audit entry while searching for shared libraries, it will add a corresponding "DT_DEPAUDIT" entry  in
           the  output  file.   This  option  is  only  meaningful  on  ELF  platforms supporting the rtld-audit
           interface.

       <b>-A</b> <u>architecture</u>
       <b>--architecture=</b><u>architecture</u>
           In the current release of <b>ld</b>, this option is useful only for the Intel 960 family  of  architectures.
           In that <b>ld</b> configuration, the <u>architecture</u> argument identifies the particular architecture in the 960
           family, enabling some safeguards and modifying the archive-library search path.

           Future releases of <b>ld</b> may support similar functionality for other architecture families.

       <b>-b</b> <u>input-format</u>
       <b>--format=</b><u>input-format</u>
           <b>ld</b>  may  be  configured  to support more than one kind of object file.  If your <b>ld</b> is configured this
           way, you can use the <b>-b</b> option to specify the binary format for input object files that  follow  this
           option  on  the  command line.  Even when <b>ld</b> is configured to support alternative object formats, you
           don't usually need to specify this, as <b>ld</b> should be configured to expect as a  default  input  format
           the  most  usual  format  on  each  machine.  <u>input-format</u> is a text string, the name of a particular
           format supported by the BFD libraries.  (You can list the available binary formats with <b>objdump</b> <b>-i</b>.)

           You may want to use this option if you are linking files with an unusual binary format.  You can also
           use <b>-b</b> to switch formats explicitly (when linking object files of different formats), by including <b>-b</b>
           <u>input-format</u> before each group of object files in a particular format.

           The default format is taken from the environment variable "GNUTARGET".

           You can also define the input format from a script, using the command "TARGET";

       <b>-c</b> <u>MRI-commandfile</u>
       <b>--mri-script=</b><u>MRI-commandfile</u>
           For compatibility with linkers produced by MRI, <b>ld</b> accepts script  files  written  in  an  alternate,
           restricted  command  language,  described  in  the  MRI  Compatible  Script  Files  section of GNU ld
           documentation.  Introduce MRI script files with the option <b>-c</b>;  use  the  <b>-T</b>  option  to  run  linker
           scripts  written  in  the  general-purpose  <b>ld</b> scripting language.  If <u>MRI-cmdfile</u> does not exist, <b>ld</b>
           looks for it in the directories specified by any <b>-L</b> options.

       <b>-d</b>
       <b>-dc</b>
       <b>-dp</b> These three options are equivalent;  multiple  forms  are  supported  for  compatibility  with  other
           linkers.   They  assign  space to common symbols even if a relocatable output file is specified (with
           <b>-r</b>).  The script command "FORCE_COMMON_ALLOCATION" has the same effect.

       <b>--depaudit</b> <u>AUDITLIB</u>
       <b>-P</b> <u>AUDITLIB</u>
           Adds <u>AUDITLIB</u> to the "DT_DEPAUDIT" entry of  the  dynamic  section.   <u>AUDITLIB</u>  is  not  checked  for
           existence,  nor  will  it  use  the  DT_SONAME specified in the library.  If specified multiple times
           "DT_DEPAUDIT" will contain a colon separated list of audit interfaces to use.  This  option  is  only
           meaningful  on  ELF  platforms  supporting  the  rtld-audit interface.  The -P option is provided for
           Solaris compatibility.

       <b>-e</b> <u>entry</u>
       <b>--entry=</b><u>entry</u>
           Use <u>entry</u> as the explicit symbol for beginning execution of your program,  rather  than  the  default
           entry  point.  If there is no symbol named <u>entry</u>, the linker will try to parse <u>entry</u> as a number, and
           use that as the entry address (the number will be interpreted in base 10; you may use  a  leading  <b>0x</b>
           for base 16, or a leading <b>0</b> for base 8).

       <b>--exclude-libs</b> <u>lib</u><b>,</b><u>lib</u><b>,...</b>
           Specifies  a  list of archive libraries from which symbols should not be automatically exported.  The
           library names may be delimited by commas or colons.  Specifying "--exclude-libs ALL" excludes symbols
           in all archive libraries from automatic export.  This option  is  available  only  for  the  i386  PE
           targeted  port of the linker and for ELF targeted ports.  For i386 PE, symbols explicitly listed in a
           .def file are still exported, regardless of this option.  For ELF targeted ports, symbols affected by
           this option will be treated as hidden.

       <b>--exclude-modules-for-implib</b> <u>module</u><b>,</b><u>module</u><b>,...</b>
           Specifies a list of object files or archive members, from which symbols should not  be  automatically
           exported,  but  which  should  be copied wholesale into the import library being generated during the
           link.  The module names may be delimited by commas or colons, and must match  exactly  the  filenames
           used  by  <b>ld</b>  to  open the files; for archive members, this is simply the member name, but for object
           files the name listed must include and match precisely any path used to specify the input file on the
           linker's command-line.  This option is available only for the i386 PE targeted port  of  the  linker.
           Symbols explicitly listed in a .def file are still exported, regardless of this option.

       <b>-E</b>
       <b>--export-dynamic</b>
       <b>--no-export-dynamic</b>
           When  creating  a  dynamically  linked executable, using the <b>-E</b> option or the <b>--export-dynamic</b> option
           causes the linker to add all symbols to the dynamic symbol table.  The dynamic symbol  table  is  the
           set of symbols which are visible from dynamic objects at run time.

           If  you  do  not  use  either  of these options (or use the <b>--no-export-dynamic</b> option to restore the
           default behavior), the dynamic symbol table will  normally  contain  only  those  symbols  which  are
           referenced by some dynamic object mentioned in the link.

           If  you use "dlopen" to load a dynamic object which needs to refer back to the symbols defined by the
           program, rather than some other dynamic object, then you will probably need to use this  option  when
           linking the program itself.

           You can also use the dynamic list to control what symbols should be added to the dynamic symbol table
           if the output format supports it.  See the description of <b>--dynamic-list</b>.

           Note  that  this  option is specific to ELF targeted ports.  PE targets support a similar function to
           export all symbols from a DLL or EXE; see the description of <b>--export-all-symbols</b> below.

       <b>-EB</b> Link big-endian objects.  This affects the default output format.

       <b>-EL</b> Link little-endian objects.  This affects the default output format.

       <b>-f</b> <u>name</u>
       <b>--auxiliary=</b><u>name</u>
           When creating an ELF shared object, set the internal DT_AUXILIARY field to the specified name.   This
           tells  the  dynamic  linker that the symbol table of the shared object should be used as an auxiliary
           filter on the symbol table of the shared object <u>name</u>.

           If you later link a program against this filter object, then, when you run the program,  the  dynamic
           linker  will  see the DT_AUXILIARY field.  If the dynamic linker resolves any symbols from the filter
           object, it will first check whether there is a definition in the shared object  <u>name</u>.   If  there  is
           one, it will be used instead of the definition in the filter object.  The shared object <u>name</u> need not
           exist.   Thus  the shared object <u>name</u> may be used to provide an alternative implementation of certain
           functions, perhaps for debugging or for machine specific performance.

           This option may be specified more than once.  The DT_AUXILIARY entries will be created in  the  order
           in which they appear on the command line.

       <b>-F</b> <u>name</u>
       <b>--filter=</b><u>name</u>
           When  creating  an  ELF  shared object, set the internal DT_FILTER field to the specified name.  This
           tells the dynamic linker that the symbol table of the shared object which is being created should  be
           used as a filter on the symbol table of the shared object <u>name</u>.

           If  you  later link a program against this filter object, then, when you run the program, the dynamic
           linker will see the DT_FILTER field.  The dynamic linker will resolve symbols according to the symbol
           table of the filter object as usual, but it will actually link to the definitions found in the shared
           object <u>name</u>.  Thus the filter object can be used to select a subset of the symbols  provided  by  the
           object <u>name</u>.

           Some  older  linkers used the <b>-F</b> option throughout a compilation toolchain for specifying object-file
           format for both input and output object files.   The  GNU  linker  uses  other  mechanisms  for  this
           purpose:  the  <b>-b</b>,  <b>--format</b>,  <b>--oformat</b>  options,  the  "TARGET"  command in linker scripts, and the
           "GNUTARGET" environment variable.  The GNU linker will ignore the <b>-F</b> option when not creating an  ELF
           shared object.

       <b>-fini=</b><u>name</u>
           When  creating  an ELF executable or shared object, call NAME when the executable or shared object is
           unloaded, by setting DT_FINI to the address of the function.  By default, the linker uses "_fini"  as
           the function to call.

       <b>-g</b>  Ignored.  Provided for compatibility with other tools.

       <b>-G</b> <u>value</u>
       <b>--gpsize=</b><u>value</u>
           Set  the  maximum  size  of  objects  to  be  optimized  using the GP register to <u>size</u>.  This is only
           meaningful for object file formats such as MIPS ECOFF which supports putting large and small  objects
           into different sections.  This is ignored for other object file formats.

       <b>-h</b> <u>name</u>
       <b>-soname=</b><u>name</u>
           When  creating an ELF shared object, set the internal DT_SONAME field to the specified name.  When an
           executable is linked with a shared object which has a DT_SONAME field, then when  the  executable  is
           run the dynamic linker will attempt to load the shared object specified by the DT_SONAME field rather
           than the using the file name given to the linker.

       <b>-i</b>  Perform an incremental link (same as option <b>-r</b>).

       <b>-init=</b><u>name</u>
           When  creating  an ELF executable or shared object, call NAME when the executable or shared object is
           loaded, by setting DT_INIT to the address of the function.  By default, the linker  uses  "_init"  as
           the function to call.

       <b>-l</b> <u>namespec</u>
       <b>--library=</b><u>namespec</u>
           Add  the  archive or object file specified by <u>namespec</u> to the list of files to link.  This option may
           be used any number of times.  If <u>namespec</u> is of the form <u>:filename</u>, <b>ld</b> will search the  library  path
           for  a  file  called  <u>filename</u>,  otherwise  it  will  search  the  library  path  for  a  file called
           <u>libnamespec.a</u>.

           On systems which support shared libraries, <b>ld</b> may also search for  files  other  than  <u>libnamespec.a</u>.
           Specifically,  on  ELF  and  SunOS  systems,  <b>ld</b>  will  search  a  directory  for  a  library  called
           <u>libnamespec.so</u> before searching for one called <u>libnamespec.a</u>.   (By  convention,  a  ".so"  extension
           indicates  a  shared  library.)   Note  that  this behavior does not apply to <u>:filename</u>, which always
           specifies a file called <u>filename</u>.

           The linker will search an archive only once, at the location where it is  specified  on  the  command
           line.   If  the archive defines a symbol which was undefined in some object which appeared before the
           archive on the command line, the linker will  include  the  appropriate  file(s)  from  the  archive.
           However,  an  undefined  symbol  in  an object appearing later on the command line will not cause the
           linker to search the archive again.

           See the <b>-(</b> option for a way to force the linker to search archives multiple times.

           You may list the same archive multiple times on the command line.

           This type of archive searching is standard for Unix linkers.  However, if you are using  <b>ld</b>  on  AIX,
           note that it is different from the behaviour of the AIX linker.

       <b>-L</b> <u>searchdir</u>
       <b>--library-path=</b><u>searchdir</u>
           Add  path  <u>searchdir</u>  to  the  list of paths that <b>ld</b> will search for archive libraries and <b>ld</b> control
           scripts.  You may use this option any number of times.  The directories are searched in the order  in
           which they are specified on the command line.  Directories specified on the command line are searched
           before  the  default directories.  All <b>-L</b> options apply to all <b>-l</b> options, regardless of the order in
           which the options appear.  <b>-L</b> options do not affect how <b>ld</b> searches for a  linker  script  unless  <b>-T</b>
           option is specified.

           If  <u>searchdir</u>  begins with "=", then the "=" will be replaced by the <u>sysroot</u> <u>prefix</u>, a path specified
           when the linker is configured.

           The default set of paths searched (without being specified with <b>-L</b>) depends on which  emulation  mode
           <b>ld</b> is using, and in some cases also on how it was configured.

           The  paths  can  also  be  specified  in  a  link  script with the "SEARCH_DIR" command.  Directories
           specified this way are searched at the point in which the linker script appears in the command line.

       <b>-m</b> <u>emulation</u>
           Emulate the <u>emulation</u> linker.  You can list  the  available  emulations  with  the  <b>--verbose</b>  or  <b>-V</b>
           options.

           If  the <b>-m</b> option is not used, the emulation is taken from the "LDEMULATION" environment variable, if
           that is defined.

           Otherwise, the default emulation depends upon how the linker was configured.

       <b>-M</b>
       <b>--print-map</b>
           Print a link map to the standard output.  A link map provides information about the  link,  including
           the following:

           •   Where object files are mapped into memory.

           •   How common symbols are allocated.

           •   All  archive  members included in the link, with a mention of the symbol which caused the archive
               member to be brought in.

           •   The values assigned to symbols.

               Note - symbols whose values are computed by  an  expression  which  involves  a  reference  to  a
               previous value of the same symbol may not have correct result displayed in the link map.  This is
               because  the  linker  discards  intermediate  results  and  only  retains  the  final value of an
               expression.  Under such circumstances the linker will display the final value enclosed by  square
               brackets.  Thus for example a linker script containing:

                          foo = 1
                          foo = foo * 4
                          foo = foo + 8

               will produce the following output in the link map if the <b>-M</b> option is used:

                          0x00000001                foo = 0x1
                          [0x0000000c]                foo = (foo * 0x4)
                          [0x0000000c]                foo = (foo + 0x8)

               See <b>Expressions</b> for more information about expressions in linker scripts.

       <b>-n</b>
       <b>--nmagic</b>
           Turn  off  page  alignment  of sections, and disable linking against shared libraries.  If the output
           format supports Unix style magic numbers, mark the output as "NMAGIC".

       <b>-N</b>
       <b>--omagic</b>
           Set the text and data sections to be readable  and  writable.   Also,  do  not  page-align  the  data
           segment,  and  disable  linking  against  shared libraries.  If the output format supports Unix style
           magic numbers, mark the output as "OMAGIC". Note: Although a writable text section is allowed for PE-
           COFF targets, it does not conform to the format specification published by Microsoft.

       <b>--no-omagic</b>
           This option negates most of the effects of the <b>-N</b> option.  It sets the text section to be  read-only,
           and  forces  the data segment to be page-aligned.  Note - this option does not enable linking against
           shared libraries.  Use <b>-Bdynamic</b> for this.

       <b>-o</b> <u>output</u>
       <b>--output=</b><u>output</u>
           Use <u>output</u> as the name for the program produced by <b>ld</b>; if this option  is  not  specified,  the  name
           <u>a.out</u> is used by default.  The script command "OUTPUT" can also specify the output file name.

       <b>-O</b> <u>level</u>
           If  <u>level</u>  is  a  numeric  values  greater  than  zero  <b>ld</b>  optimizes  the  output.   This might take
           significantly longer and therefore probably should only be enabled for  the  final  binary.   At  the
           moment  this  option  only  affects ELF shared library generation.  Future releases of the linker may
           make more use of this option.  Also currently there is no difference in the  linker's  behaviour  for
           different non-zero values of this option.  Again this may change with future releases.

       <b>-q</b>
       <b>--emit-relocs</b>
           Leave  relocation  sections  and  contents  in  fully  linked  executables.   Post  link analysis and
           optimization  tools  may  need  this  information  in  order  to  perform  correct  modifications  of
           executables.  This results in larger executables.

           This option is currently only supported on ELF platforms.

       <b>--force-dynamic</b>
           Force the output file to have dynamic sections.  This option is specific to VxWorks targets.

       <b>-r</b>
       <b>--relocatable</b>
           Generate  relocatable  output---i.e.,  generate an output file that can in turn serve as input to <b>ld</b>.
           This is often called <u>partial</u> <u>linking</u>.  As a side effect, in environments that support  standard  Unix
           magic  numbers,  this option also sets the output file's magic number to "OMAGIC".  If this option is
           not specified, an absolute file is produced.  When linking C++ programs, this option <u>will</u> <u>not</u> resolve
           references to constructors; to do that, use <b>-Ur</b>.

           When an input file does not have the same  format  as  the  output  file,  partial  linking  is  only
           supported  if  that  input  file does not contain any relocations.  Different output formats can have
           further restrictions; for example some "a.out"-based formats do  not  support  partial  linking  with
           input files in other formats at all.

           This option does the same thing as <b>-i</b>.

       <b>-R</b> <u>filename</u>
       <b>--just-symbols=</b><u>filename</u>
           Read  symbol  names  and  their  addresses from <u>filename</u>, but do not relocate it or include it in the
           output.  This allows your output file to refer symbolically to absolute locations of  memory  defined
           in other programs.  You may use this option more than once.

           For  compatibility  with  other ELF linkers, if the <b>-R</b> option is followed by a directory name, rather
           than a file name, it is treated as the <b>-rpath</b> option.

       <b>-s</b>
       <b>--strip-all</b>
           Omit all symbol information from the output file.

       <b>-S</b>
       <b>--strip-debug</b>
           Omit debugger symbol information (but not all symbols) from the output file.

       <b>-t</b>
       <b>--trace</b>
           Print the names of the input files as <b>ld</b> processes them.

       <b>-T</b> <u>scriptfile</u>
       <b>--script=</b><u>scriptfile</u>
           Use <u>scriptfile</u> as the linker script.  This script replaces <b>ld</b>'s default linker  script  (rather  than
           adding  to  it),  so <u>commandfile</u> must specify everything necessary to describe the output file.    If
           <u>scriptfile</u> does not exist in the current directory, "ld" looks for it in the directories specified by
           any preceding <b>-L</b> options.  Multiple <b>-T</b> options accumulate.

       <b>-dT</b> <u>scriptfile</u>
       <b>--default-script=</b><u>scriptfile</u>
           Use <u>scriptfile</u> as the default linker script.

           This option is similar to the <b>--script</b> option except that processing of the script is  delayed  until
           after  the  rest  of  the  command  line  has  been  processed.  This allows options placed after the
           <b>--default-script</b> option on the command line to affect the behaviour of the linker script,  which  can
           be important when the linker command line cannot be directly controlled by the user.  (eg because the
           command line is being constructed by another tool, such as <b>gcc</b>).

       <b>-u</b> <u>symbol</u>
       <b>--undefined=</b><u>symbol</u>
           Force  <u>symbol</u>  to be entered in the output file as an undefined symbol.  Doing this may, for example,
           trigger linking of additional modules from standard libraries.  <b>-u</b> may  be  repeated  with  different
           option  arguments  to  enter additional undefined symbols.  This option is equivalent to the "EXTERN"
           linker script command.

       <b>-Ur</b> For anything other than C++ programs, this option is  equivalent  to  <b>-r</b>:  it  generates  relocatable
           output---i.e.,  an output file that can in turn serve as input to <b>ld</b>.  When linking C++ programs, <b>-Ur</b>
           <u>does</u> resolve references to constructors, unlike <b>-r</b>.  It does not work to use <b>-Ur</b> on files  that  were
           themselves  linked  with  <b>-Ur</b>; once the constructor table has been built, it cannot be added to.  Use
           <b>-Ur</b> only for the last partial link, and <b>-r</b> for the others.

       <b>--unique[=</b><u>SECTION</u><b>]</b>
           Creates a separate output section for every input  section  matching  <u>SECTION</u>,  or  if  the  optional
           wildcard  <u>SECTION</u>  argument is missing, for every orphan input section.  An orphan section is one not
           specifically mentioned in a linker script.  You may use this option multiple  times  on  the  command
           line;  It prevents the normal merging of input sections with the same name, overriding output section
           assignments in a linker script.

       <b>-v</b>
       <b>--version</b>
       <b>-V</b>  Display the version number for <b>ld</b>.  The <b>-V</b> option also lists the supported emulations.

       <b>-x</b>
       <b>--discard-all</b>
           Delete all local symbols.

       <b>-X</b>
       <b>--discard-locals</b>
           Delete  all temporary local symbols.  (These symbols start with system-specific local label prefixes,
           typically <b>.L</b> for ELF systems or <b>L</b> for traditional a.out systems.)

       <b>-y</b> <u>symbol</u>
       <b>--trace-symbol=</b><u>symbol</u>
           Print the name of each linked file in which <u>symbol</u> appears.  This option may be given any  number  of
           times.  On many systems it is necessary to prepend an underscore.

           This  option  is  useful  when  you  have  an  undefined symbol in your link but don't know where the
           reference is coming from.

       <b>-Y</b> <u>path</u>
           Add <u>path</u> to the default library search path.  This option exists for Solaris compatibility.

       <b>-z</b> <u>keyword</u>
           The recognized keywords are:

           <b>combreloc</b>
               Combines multiple reloc sections and sorts them to make dynamic symbol lookup caching possible.

           <b>defs</b>
               Disallows undefined symbols in object files.  Undefined symbols in  shared  libraries  are  still
               allowed.

           <b>execstack</b>
               Marks the object as requiring executable stack.

           <b>initfirst</b>
               This  option  is  only meaningful when building a shared object.  It marks the object so that its
               runtime initialization will occur before the runtime initialization of any other objects  brought
               into  the  process at the same time.  Similarly the runtime finalization of the object will occur
               after the runtime finalization of any other objects.

           <b>interpose</b>
               Marks the object that its symbol table interposes before all symbols but the primary executable.

           <b>lazy</b>
               When generating an executable or shared library, mark it to tell  the  dynamic  linker  to  defer
               function  call resolution to the point when the function is called (lazy binding), rather than at
               load time.  Lazy binding is the default.

           <b>loadfltr</b>
               Marks  the object that its filters be processed immediately at runtime.

           <b>muldefs</b>
               Allows multiple definitions.

           <b>nocombreloc</b>
               Disables multiple reloc sections combining.

           <b>nocopyreloc</b>
               Disables production of copy relocs.

           <b>nodefaultlib</b>
               Marks the object that the search for dependencies of this object will ignore any default  library
               search paths.

           <b>nodelete</b>
               Marks the object shouldn't be unloaded at runtime.

           <b>nodlopen</b>
               Marks the object not available to "dlopen".

           <b>nodump</b>
               Marks the object can not be dumped by "dldump".

           <b>noexecstack</b>
               Marks the object as not requiring executable stack.

           <b>norelro</b>
               Don't create an ELF "PT_GNU_RELRO" segment header in the object.

           <b>now</b> When  generating  an  executable or shared library, mark it to tell the dynamic linker to resolve
               all symbols when the program is started, or when the shared library is linked  to  using  dlopen,
               instead of deferring function call resolution to the point when the function is first called.

           <b>origin</b>
               Marks the object may contain $ORIGIN.

           <b>relro</b>
               Create an ELF "PT_GNU_RELRO" segment header in the object.

           <b>max-page-size=</b><u>value</u>
               Set the emulation maximum page size to <u>value</u>.

           <b>common-page-size=</b><u>value</u>
               Set the emulation common page size to <u>value</u>.

           Other keywords are ignored for Solaris compatibility.

       <b>-(</b> <u>archives</u> <b>-)</b>
       <b>--start-group</b> <u>archives</u> <b>--end-group</b>
           The  <u>archives</u>  should  be  a  list  of  archive files.  They may be either explicit file names, or <b>-l</b>
           options.

           The specified archives are searched  repeatedly  until  no  new  undefined  references  are  created.
           Normally, an archive is searched only once in the order that it is specified on the command line.  If
           a  symbol  in  that  archive  is needed to resolve an undefined symbol referred to by an object in an
           archive that appears later on the command line,  the  linker  would  not  be  able  to  resolve  that
           reference.   By  grouping the archives, they all be searched repeatedly until all possible references
           are resolved.

           Using this option has a significant performance cost.  It is best to  use  it  only  when  there  are
           unavoidable circular references between two or more archives.

       <b>--accept-unknown-input-arch</b>
       <b>--no-accept-unknown-input-arch</b>
           Tells  the  linker  to accept input files whose architecture cannot be recognised.  The assumption is
           that the user knows what they are doing and deliberately wants to link in these unknown input  files.
           This  was  the  default  behaviour  of  the  linker, before release 2.14.  The default behaviour from
           release 2.14 onwards is to reject such input files, and so the <b>--accept-unknown-input-arch</b> option has
           been added to restore the old behaviour.

       <b>--as-needed</b>
       <b>--no-as-needed</b>
           This option affects ELF DT_NEEDED tags for dynamic libraries mentioned on the command line after  the
           <b>--as-needed</b>  option.  Normally the linker will add a DT_NEEDED tag for each dynamic library mentioned
           on the command line, regardless of whether the library is actually needed or not.  <b>--as-needed</b> causes
           a DT_NEEDED tag to only be emitted for a library that satisfies an undefined symbol reference from  a
           regular  object file or, if the library is not found in the DT_NEEDED lists of other libraries linked
           up to that point, an  undefined  symbol  reference  from  another  dynamic  library.   <b>--no-as-needed</b>
           restores the default behaviour.

       <b>--add-needed</b>
       <b>--no-add-needed</b>
           These  two  options  have been deprecated because of the similarity of their names to the <b>--as-needed</b>
           and  <b>--no-as-needed</b>   options.    They   have   been   replaced   by   <b>--copy-dt-needed-entries</b>   and
           <b>--no-copy-dt-needed-entries</b>.

       <b>-assert</b> <u>keyword</u>
           This option is ignored for SunOS compatibility.

       <b>-Bdynamic</b>
       <b>-dy</b>
       <b>-call_shared</b>
           Link  against dynamic libraries.  This is only meaningful on platforms for which shared libraries are
           supported.  This option is normally the default on such platforms.  The different  variants  of  this
           option  are  for  compatibility  with various systems.  You may use this option multiple times on the
           command line: it affects library searching for <b>-l</b> options which follow it.

       <b>-Bgroup</b>
           Set the "DF_1_GROUP" flag in the "DT_FLAGS_1" entry in the dynamic section.  This causes the  runtime
           linker  to  handle lookups in this object and its dependencies to be performed only inside the group.
           <b>--unresolved-symbols=report-all</b> is implied.  This option is only meaningful on  ELF  platforms  which
           support shared libraries.

       <b>-Bstatic</b>
       <b>-dn</b>
       <b>-non_shared</b>
       <b>-static</b>
           Do  not  link  against  shared  libraries.   This  is  only  meaningful on platforms for which shared
           libraries are supported.  The different variants of this option are for  compatibility  with  various
           systems.   You  may  use this option multiple times on the command line: it affects library searching
           for <b>-l</b> options which follow it.  This  option  also  implies  <b>--unresolved-symbols=report-all</b>.   This
           option  can be used with <b>-shared</b>.  Doing so means that a shared library is being created but that all
           of the library's external references must be resolved by pulling in entries from static libraries.

       <b>-Bsymbolic</b>
           When creating a shared library, bind references to global symbols to the definition within the shared
           library, if any.  Normally, it is possible for a program linked against a shared library to  override
           the  definition  within  the  shared  library.  This option is only meaningful on ELF platforms which
           support shared libraries.

       <b>-Bsymbolic-functions</b>
           When creating a shared library, bind references to global function symbols to the  definition  within
           the  shared  library,  if  any.  This option is only meaningful on ELF platforms which support shared
           libraries.

       <b>--dynamic-list=</b><u>dynamic-list-file</u>
           Specify the name of a dynamic list file to the linker.  This is typically used when  creating  shared
           libraries  to  specify a list of global symbols whose references shouldn't be bound to the definition
           within the shared library, or creating dynamically linked executables to specify a  list  of  symbols
           which  should  be added to the symbol table in the executable.  This option is only meaningful on ELF
           platforms which support shared libraries.

           The format of the dynamic list is the same as the version node without  scope  and  node  name.   See
           <b>VERSION</b> for more information.

       <b>--dynamic-list-data</b>
           Include all global data symbols to the dynamic list.

       <b>--dynamic-list-cpp-new</b>
           Provide  the  builtin dynamic list for C++ operator new and delete.  It is mainly useful for building
           shared libstdc++.

       <b>--dynamic-list-cpp-typeinfo</b>
           Provide the builtin dynamic list for C++ runtime type identification.

       <b>--check-sections</b>
       <b>--no-check-sections</b>
           Asks the linker <u>not</u> to check section addresses after they have been assigned to see if there are  any
           overlaps.   Normally the linker will perform this check, and if it finds any overlaps it will produce
           suitable error messages.  The linker does know about,  and  does  make  allowances  for  sections  in
           overlays.   The  default behaviour can be restored by using the command line switch <b>--check-sections</b>.
           Section overlap is not usually checked for relocatable links.  You can force checking in that case by
           using the <b>--check-sections</b> option.

       <b>--copy-dt-needed-entries</b>
       <b>--no-copy-dt-needed-entries</b>
           This option affects the treatment of dynamic libraries referred  to  by  DT_NEEDED  tags  <u>inside</u>  ELF
           dynamic libraries mentioned on the command line.  Normally the linker will add a DT_NEEDED tag to the
           output  binary  for  each  library  mentioned  in  a DT_NEEDED tag in an input dynamic library.  With
           <b>--no-copy-dt-needed-entries</b> specified on the command line however any dynamic libraries  that  follow
           it  will  have  their  DT_NEEDED  entries  ignored.   The  default  behaviour  can  be  restored with
           <b>--copy-dt-needed-entries</b>.

           This option also has an effect on the resolution of symbols in dynamic libraries.  With  the  default
           setting dynamic libraries mentioned on the command line will be recursively searched, following their
           DT_NEEDED  tags  to other libraries, in order to resolve symbols required by the output binary.  With
           <b>--no-copy-dt-needed-entries</b> specified however the searching of dynamic libraries that follow it  will
           stop with the dynamic library itself.  No DT_NEEDED links will be traversed to resolve symbols.

       <b>--cref</b>
           Output  a  cross reference table.  If a linker map file is being generated, the cross reference table
           is printed to the map file.  Otherwise, it is printed on the standard output.

           The format of the table is intentionally simple, so that it may be easily processed by  a  script  if
           necessary.   The  symbols  are printed out, sorted by name.  For each symbol, a list of file names is
           given.  If the symbol is defined, the first file listed is  the  location  of  the  definition.   The
           remaining files contain references to the symbol.

       <b>--no-define-common</b>
           This   option   inhibits  the  assignment  of  addresses  to  common  symbols.   The  script  command
           "INHIBIT_COMMON_ALLOCATION" has the same effect.

           The <b>--no-define-common</b> option allows decoupling the decision to assign addresses  to  Common  symbols
           from  the  choice  of  the output file type; otherwise a non-Relocatable output type forces assigning
           addresses to Common symbols.  Using <b>--no-define-common</b> allows Common symbols that are referenced from
           a shared library to be assigned addresses only in the  main  program.   This  eliminates  the  unused
           duplicate space in the shared library, and also prevents any possible confusion over resolving to the
           wrong  duplicate when there are many dynamic modules with specialized search paths for runtime symbol
           resolution.

       <b>--defsym=</b><u>symbol</u><b>=</b><u>expression</u>
           Create a global symbol in the output file, containing the absolute address given by <u>expression</u>.   You
           may  use  this  option  as many times as necessary to define multiple symbols in the command line.  A
           limited form of arithmetic is  supported  for  the  <u>expression</u>  in  this  context:  you  may  give  a
           hexadecimal  constant  or  the  name  of  an  existing  symbol, or use "+" and "-" to add or subtract
           hexadecimal constants or symbols.  If you need more elaborate expressions, consider using the  linker
           command language from a script.  <u>Note:</u> there should be no white space between <u>symbol</u>, the equals sign
           ("<b>=</b>"), and <u>expression</u>.

       <b>--demangle[=</b><u>style</u><b>]</b>
       <b>--no-demangle</b>
           These  options control whether to demangle symbol names in error messages and other output.  When the
           linker is told to demangle, it tries to present symbol names in a readable fashion: it strips leading
           underscores if they are used by the object file format, and converts C++ mangled  symbol  names  into
           user  readable  names.   Different compilers have different mangling styles.  The optional demangling
           style argument can be used to choose an appropriate demangling style for your compiler.   The  linker
           will  demangle  by default unless the environment variable <b>COLLECT_NO_DEMANGLE</b> is set.  These options
           may be used to override the default.

       <b>-I</b><u>file</u>
       <b>--dynamic-linker=</b><u>file</u>
           Set the name of the dynamic linker.  This is only meaningful when generating dynamically  linked  ELF
           executables.  The default dynamic linker is normally correct; don't use this unless you know what you
           are doing.

       <b>--fatal-warnings</b>
       <b>--no-fatal-warnings</b>
           Treat   all   warnings   as   errors.   The  default  behaviour  can  be  restored  with  the  option
           <b>--no-fatal-warnings</b>.

       <b>--force-exe-suffix</b>
           Make sure that an output file has a .exe suffix.

           If a successfully built fully linked output file does not have a ".exe" or ".dll" suffix, this option
           forces the linker to copy the output file to one of the same name with a ".exe" suffix.  This  option
           is  useful  when  using unmodified Unix makefiles on a Microsoft Windows host, since some versions of
           Windows won't run an image unless it ends in a ".exe" suffix.

       <b>--gc-sections</b>
       <b>--no-gc-sections</b>
           Enable garbage collection of unused input sections.  It is ignored on targets  that  do  not  support
           this  option.   The  default behaviour (of not performing this garbage collection) can be restored by
           specifying <b>--no-gc-sections</b> on the command line.

           <b>--gc-sections</b> decides which input sections are  used  by  examining  symbols  and  relocations.   The
           section containing the entry symbol and all sections containing symbols undefined on the command-line
           will  be  kept,  as  will  sections containing symbols referenced by dynamic objects.  Note that when
           building shared libraries, the linker must assume that any visible symbol is referenced.   Once  this
           initial  set  of  sections  has  been  determined,  the  linker recursively marks as used any section
           referenced by their relocations.  See <b>--entry</b> and <b>--undefined</b>.

           This option can be set when doing a partial link (enabled with option <b>-r</b>).  In this case the root  of
           symbols  kept must be explicitly specified either by an <b>--entry</b> or <b>--undefined</b> option or by a "ENTRY"
           command in the linker script.

       <b>--print-gc-sections</b>
       <b>--no-print-gc-sections</b>
           List all sections removed by garbage collection.  The listing is printed on stderr.  This  option  is
           only  effective  if  garbage  collection has been enabled via the <b>--gc-sections</b>) option.  The default
           behaviour  (of  not  listing  the  sections  that  are  removed)  can  be  restored   by   specifying
           <b>--no-print-gc-sections</b> on the command line.

       <b>--help</b>
           Print a summary of the command-line options on the standard output and exit.

       <b>--target-help</b>
           Print a summary of all target specific options on the standard output and exit.

       <b>-Map=</b><u>mapfile</u>
           Print a link map to the file <u>mapfile</u>.  See the description of the <b>-M</b> option, above.

       <b>--no-keep-memory</b>
           <b>ld</b>  normally  optimizes  for  speed  over memory usage by caching the symbol tables of input files in
           memory.  This option tells <b>ld</b> to instead optimize for memory usage, by rereading the symbol tables as
           necessary.  This may be required if <b>ld</b> runs out of memory space while linking a large executable.

       <b>--no-undefined</b>
       <b>-z</b> <b>defs</b>
           Report unresolved symbol references from regular object files.  This is done even if  the  linker  is
           creating  a  non-symbolic  shared  library.   The  switch  <b>--[no-]allow-shlib-undefined</b>  controls the
           behaviour for reporting unresolved references found in shared libraries being linked in.

       <b>--allow-multiple-definition</b>
       <b>-z</b> <b>muldefs</b>
           Normally when a symbol is defined multiple times, the linker will report a fatal error. These options
           allow multiple definitions and the first definition will be used.

       <b>--allow-shlib-undefined</b>
       <b>--no-allow-shlib-undefined</b>
           Allows or disallows undefined symbols in shared libraries.  This switch is similar to  <b>--no-undefined</b>
           except  that  it  determines  the behaviour when the undefined symbols are in a shared library rather
           than a regular object file.  It does not affect how undefined symbols in  regular  object  files  are
           handled.

           The default behaviour is to report errors for any undefined symbols referenced in shared libraries if
           the  linker  is  being used to create an executable, but to allow them if the linker is being used to
           create a shared library.

           The reasons for allowing undefined symbol references in shared libraries specified at link  time  are
           that:

           •   A  shared library specified at link time may not be the same as the one that is available at load
               time, so the symbol might actually be resolvable at load time.

           •   There are some operating systems, eg BeOS and HPPA, where undefined symbols in  shared  libraries
               are normal.

               The BeOS kernel for example patches shared libraries at load time to select whichever function is
               most  appropriate for the current architecture.  This is used, for example, to dynamically select
               an appropriate memset function.

       <b>--no-undefined-version</b>
           Normally when a symbol has an undefined version, the linker will ignore  it.  This  option  disallows
           symbols with undefined version and a fatal error will be issued instead.

       <b>--default-symver</b>
           Create and use a default symbol version (the soname) for unversioned exported symbols.

       <b>--default-imported-symver</b>
           Create and use a default symbol version (the soname) for unversioned imported symbols.

       <b>--no-warn-mismatch</b>
           Normally  <b>ld</b>  will give an error if you try to link together input files that are mismatched for some
           reason,  perhaps  because  they  have  been  compiled  for  different  processors  or  for  different
           endiannesses.  This option tells <b>ld</b> that it should silently permit such possible errors.  This option
           should only be used with care, in cases when you have taken some special action that ensures that the
           linker errors are inappropriate.

       <b>--no-warn-search-mismatch</b>
           Normally  <b>ld</b>  will  give a warning if it finds an incompatible library during a library search.  This
           option silences the warning.

       <b>--no-whole-archive</b>
           Turn off the effect of the <b>--whole-archive</b> option for subsequent archive files.

       <b>--noinhibit-exec</b>
           Retain the executable output file whenever it is still usable.  Normally, the linker will not produce
           an output file if it encounters errors during the link process; it exits without  writing  an  output
           file when it issues any error whatsoever.

       <b>-nostdlib</b>
           Only  search  library  directories  explicitly  specified  on  the command line.  Library directories
           specified in linker scripts (including linker scripts specified on the command line) are ignored.

       <b>--oformat=</b><u>output-format</u>
           <b>ld</b> may be configured to support more than one kind of object file.  If your  <b>ld</b>  is  configured  this
           way,  you can use the <b>--oformat</b> option to specify the binary format for the output object file.  Even
           when <b>ld</b> is configured to support alternative object formats, you don't usually need to specify  this,
           as  <b>ld</b>  should  be  configured  to  produce  as a default output format the most usual format on each
           machine.  <u>output-format</u> is a text string, the name of  a  particular  format  supported  by  the  BFD
           libraries.   (You  can  list  the  available  binary  formats  with  <b>objdump</b> <b>-i</b>.)  The script command
           "OUTPUT_FORMAT" can also specify the output format, but this option overrides it.

       <b>-pie</b>
       <b>--pic-executable</b>
           Create a position independent executable.   This  is  currently  only  supported  on  ELF  platforms.
           Position  independent  executables  are similar to shared libraries in that they are relocated by the
           dynamic linker to the virtual address the OS chooses for them (which can vary  between  invocations).
           Like normal dynamically linked executables they can be executed and symbols defined in the executable
           cannot be overridden by shared libraries.

       <b>-qmagic</b>
           This option is ignored for Linux compatibility.

       <b>-Qy</b> This option is ignored for SVR4 compatibility.

       <b>--relax</b>
       <b>--no-relax</b>
           An option with machine dependent effects.  This option is only supported on a few targets.

           On  some  platforms  the  <b>--relax</b>  option  performs target specific, global optimizations that become
           possible when the linker resolves  addressing  in  the  program,  such  as  relaxing  address  modes,
           synthesizing  new  instructions,  selecting  shorter  version  of  current instructions, and combinig
           constant values.

           On some platforms these link time global optimizations may make symbolic debugging of  the  resulting
           executable impossible.  This is known to be the case for the Matsushita MN10200 and MN10300 family of
           processors.

           On platforms where this is not supported, <b>--relax</b> is accepted, but ignored.

           On platforms where <b>--relax</b> is accepted the option <b>--no-relax</b> can be used to disable the feature.

       <b>--retain-symbols-file=</b><u>filename</u>
           Retain  <u>only</u>  the  symbols  listed in the file <u>filename</u>, discarding all others.  <u>filename</u> is simply a
           flat file, with one symbol name per line.  This option is especially useful in environments (such  as
           VxWorks) where a large global symbol table is accumulated gradually, to conserve run-time memory.

           <b>--retain-symbols-file</b> does <u>not</u> discard undefined symbols, or symbols needed for relocations.

           You may only specify <b>--retain-symbols-file</b> once in the command line.  It overrides <b>-s</b> and <b>-S</b>.

       <b>-rpath=</b><u>dir</u>
           Add a directory to the runtime library search path.  This is used when linking an ELF executable with
           shared  objects.   All <b>-rpath</b> arguments are concatenated and passed to the runtime linker, which uses
           them to locate shared objects at runtime.  The <b>-rpath</b>  option  is  also  used  when  locating  shared
           objects  which  are  needed by shared objects explicitly included in the link; see the description of
           the <b>-rpath-link</b> option.  If <b>-rpath</b> is not used when linking an ELF executable, the  contents  of  the
           environment variable "LD_RUN_PATH" will be used if it is defined.

           The  <b>-rpath</b>  option  may also be used on SunOS.  By default, on SunOS, the linker will form a runtime
           search patch out of all the <b>-L</b> options it is given.  If a <b>-rpath</b> option is used, the  runtime  search
           path  will  be  formed  exclusively  using  the <b>-rpath</b> options, ignoring the <b>-L</b> options.  This can be
           useful when using gcc, which adds many <b>-L</b> options which may be on NFS mounted file systems.

           For compatibility with other ELF linkers, if the <b>-R</b> option is followed by a  directory  name,  rather
           than a file name, it is treated as the <b>-rpath</b> option.

       <b>-rpath-link=</b><u>dir</u>
           When  using  ELF or SunOS, one shared library may require another.  This happens when an "ld -shared"
           link includes a shared library as one of the input files.

           When the linker encounters such a dependency when doing a non-shared, non-relocatable link,  it  will
           automatically  try  to  locate  the  required shared library and include it in the link, if it is not
           included explicitly.  In such a case, the <b>-rpath-link</b> option specifies the first set  of  directories
           to  search.   The <b>-rpath-link</b> option may specify a sequence of directory names either by specifying a
           list of names separated by colons, or by appearing multiple times.

           This option should be used with caution as it overrides the search  path  that  may  have  been  hard
           compiled  into  a  shared  library.  In such a case it is possible to use unintentionally a different
           search path than the runtime linker would do.

           The linker uses the following search paths to locate required shared libraries:

           1.  Any directories specified by <b>-rpath-link</b> options.

           2.  Any directories specified by <b>-rpath</b> options.  The difference between <b>-rpath</b>  and  <b>-rpath-link</b>  is
               that  directories specified by <b>-rpath</b> options are included in the executable and used at runtime,
               whereas the <b>-rpath-link</b> option is only effective at link time. Searching <b>-rpath</b> in  this  way  is
               only  supported  by  native  linkers  and  cross  linkers  which  have  been  configured with the
               <b>--with-sysroot</b> option.

           3.  On an ELF system, for native linkers, if the <b>-rpath</b> and <b>-rpath-link</b> options were not used, search
               the contents of the environment variable "LD_RUN_PATH".

           4.  On SunOS, if the <b>-rpath</b> option was not used, search any directories specified using <b>-L</b> options.

           5.  For a native linker, the search the contents of the environment variable "LD_LIBRARY_PATH".

           6.  For a native ELF linker, the directories in "DT_RUNPATH" or "DT_RPATH" of a  shared  library  are
               searched  for  shared  libraries needed by it. The "DT_RPATH" entries are ignored if "DT_RUNPATH"
               entries exist.

           7.  The default directories, normally <u><a href="file:/lib">/lib</a></u> and <u><a href="file:/usr/lib">/usr/lib</a></u>.

           8.  For a native linker on an ELF system, if the file <u><a href="file:/etc/ld.so.conf">/etc/ld.so.conf</a></u> exists, the list of directories
               found in that file.

           If the required shared library is not found, the linker will issue a warning and  continue  with  the
           link.

       <b>-shared</b>
       <b>-Bshareable</b>
           Create  a  shared  library.   This is currently only supported on ELF, XCOFF and SunOS platforms.  On
           SunOS, the linker will automatically create a shared library if the <b>-e</b> option is not used  and  there
           are undefined symbols in the link.

       <b>--sort-common</b>
       <b>--sort-common=ascending</b>
       <b>--sort-common=descending</b>
           This option tells <b>ld</b> to sort the common symbols by alignment in ascending or descending order when it
           places them in the appropriate output sections.  The symbol alignments considered are sixteen-byte or
           larger, eight-byte, four-byte, two-byte, and one-byte. This is to prevent gaps between symbols due to
           alignment constraints.  If no sorting order is specified, then descending order is assumed.

       <b>--sort-section=name</b>
           This option will apply "SORT_BY_NAME" to all wildcard section patterns in the linker script.

       <b>--sort-section=alignment</b>
           This option will apply "SORT_BY_ALIGNMENT" to all wildcard section patterns in the linker script.

       <b>--split-by-file[=</b><u>size</u><b>]</b>
           Similar  to  <b>--split-by-reloc</b>  but  creates  a  new  output  section for each input file when <u>size</u> is
           reached.  <u>size</u> defaults to a size of 1 if not given.

       <b>--split-by-reloc[=</b><u>count</u><b>]</b>
           Tries to creates extra sections in the output file so that no  single  output  section  in  the  file
           contains  more  than  <u>count</u>  relocations.   This is useful when generating huge relocatable files for
           downloading into certain real time kernels with the  COFF  object  file  format;  since  COFF  cannot
           represent  more  than  65535  relocations in a single section.  Note that this will fail to work with
           object file formats which do not support arbitrary sections.  The linker will not split up individual
           input sections for redistribution, so if a single input section contains more than <u>count</u>  relocations
           one output section will contain that many relocations.  <u>count</u> defaults to a value of 32768.

       <b>--stats</b>
           Compute  and  display statistics about the operation of the linker, such as execution time and memory
           usage.

       <b>--sysroot=</b><u>directory</u>
           Use <u>directory</u> as the location of the sysroot, overriding the configure-time default.  This option  is
           only supported by linkers that were configured using <b>--with-sysroot</b>.

       <b>--traditional-format</b>
           For some targets, the output of <b>ld</b> is different in some ways from the output of some existing linker.
           This switch requests <b>ld</b> to use the traditional format instead.

           For example, on SunOS, <b>ld</b> combines duplicate entries in the symbol string table.  This can reduce the
           size  of an output file with full debugging information by over 30 percent.  Unfortunately, the SunOS
           "dbx" program can not read the resulting program ("gdb" has no  trouble).   The  <b>--traditional-format</b>
           switch tells <b>ld</b> to not combine duplicate entries.

       <b>--section-start=</b><u>sectionname</u><b>=</b><u>org</u>
           Locate a section in the output file at the absolute address given by <u>org</u>.  You may use this option as
           many  times  as  necessary  to  locate  multiple  sections in the command line.  <u>org</u> must be a single
           hexadecimal integer; for compatibility with other linkers,  you  may  omit  the  leading  <b>0x</b>  usually
           associated  with  hexadecimal  values.  <u>Note:</u> there should be no white space between <u>sectionname</u>, the
           equals sign ("<b>=</b>"), and <u>org</u>.

       <b>-Tbss=</b><u>org</u>
       <b>-Tdata=</b><u>org</u>
       <b>-Ttext=</b><u>org</u>
           Same as <b>--section-start</b>, with ".bss", ".data" or ".text" as the <u>sectionname</u>.

       <b>-Ttext-segment=</b><u>org</u>
           When creating an ELF executable or shared object, it will set the address of the first  byte  of  the
           text segment.

       <b>--unresolved-symbols=</b><u>method</u>
           Determine how to handle unresolved symbols.  There are four possible values for <b>method</b>:

           <b>ignore-all</b>
               Do not report any unresolved symbols.

           <b>report-all</b>
               Report all unresolved symbols.  This is the default.

           <b>ignore-in-object-files</b>
               Report  unresolved  symbols  that are contained in shared libraries, but ignore them if they come
               from regular object files.

           <b>ignore-in-shared-libs</b>
               Report unresolved symbols that come from regular object files, but ignore them if they come  from
               shared libraries.  This can be useful when creating a dynamic binary and it is known that all the
               shared libraries that it should be referencing are included on the linker's command line.

           The   behaviour   for   shared   libraries   on   their   own   can   also   be   controlled  by  the
           <b>--[no-]allow-shlib-undefined</b> option.

           Normally the linker will generate an error message for each reported unresolved symbol but the option
           <b>--warn-unresolved-symbols</b> can change this to a warning.

       <b>--dll-verbose</b>
       <b>--verbose[=</b><u>NUMBER</u><b>]</b>
           Display the version number for <b>ld</b> and list the linker  emulations  supported.   Display  which  input
           files  can and cannot be opened.  Display the linker script being used by the linker. If the optional
           <u>NUMBER</u> argument &gt; 1, plugin symbol status will also be displayed.

       <b>--version-script=</b><u>version-scriptfile</u>
           Specify the name of a version script to the linker.  This is  typically  used  when  creating  shared
           libraries  to  specify  additional  information  about  the  version  hierarchy for the library being
           created.  This option is only fully supported on ELF platforms which support  shared  libraries;  see
           <b>VERSION</b>.   It  is partially supported on PE platforms, which can use version scripts to filter symbol
           visibility in auto-export mode: any symbols marked <b>local</b> in the version script will not be exported.

       <b>--warn-common</b>
           Warn when a common symbol is combined with another common symbol or with a symbol  definition.   Unix
           linkers  allow  this  somewhat  sloppy  practise, but linkers on some other operating systems do not.
           This option allows you to find potential problems from combining global symbols.  Unfortunately, some
           C libraries use this practise, so you may get some warnings about symbols in the libraries as well as
           in your programs.

           There are three kinds of global symbols, illustrated here by C examples:

           <b>int</b> <b>i</b> <b>=</b> <b>1;</b>
               A definition, which goes in the initialized data section of the output file.

           <b>extern</b> <b>int</b> <b>i;</b>
               An undefined reference, which does not allocate space.  There must be either a  definition  or  a
               common symbol for the variable somewhere.

           <b>int</b> <b>i;</b>
               A  common  symbol.  If there are only (one or more) common symbols for a variable, it goes in the
               uninitialized data area of the output file.  The linker merges multiple common  symbols  for  the
               same  variable  into a single symbol.  If they are of different sizes, it picks the largest size.
               The linker turns a common symbol into a declaration,  if  there  is  a  definition  of  the  same
               variable.

           The  <b>--warn-common</b>  option  can  produce  five kinds of warnings.  Each warning consists of a pair of
           lines: the first describes the symbol just encountered, and the second describes the previous  symbol
           encountered with the same name.  One or both of the two symbols will be a common symbol.

           1.  Turning a common symbol into a reference, because there is already a definition for the symbol.

                       &lt;file&gt;(&lt;section&gt;): warning: common of `&lt;symbol&gt;'
                          overridden by definition
                       &lt;file&gt;(&lt;section&gt;): warning: defined here

           2.  Turning  a  common  symbol  into  a  reference,  because  a  later  definition  for the symbol is
               encountered.  This is the same as the previous case, except that the symbols are encountered in a
               different order.

                       &lt;file&gt;(&lt;section&gt;): warning: definition of `&lt;symbol&gt;'
                          overriding common
                       &lt;file&gt;(&lt;section&gt;): warning: common is here

           3.  Merging a common symbol with a previous same-sized common symbol.

                       &lt;file&gt;(&lt;section&gt;): warning: multiple common
                          of `&lt;symbol&gt;'
                       &lt;file&gt;(&lt;section&gt;): warning: previous common is here

           4.  Merging a common symbol with a previous larger common symbol.

                       &lt;file&gt;(&lt;section&gt;): warning: common of `&lt;symbol&gt;'
                          overridden by larger common
                       &lt;file&gt;(&lt;section&gt;): warning: larger common is here

           5.  Merging a common symbol with a previous smaller common symbol.  This is the same as the  previous
               case, except that the symbols are encountered in a different order.

                       &lt;file&gt;(&lt;section&gt;): warning: common of `&lt;symbol&gt;'
                          overriding smaller common
                       &lt;file&gt;(&lt;section&gt;): warning: smaller common is here

       <b>--warn-constructors</b>
           Warn  if  any  global constructors are used.  This is only useful for a few object file formats.  For
           formats like COFF or ELF, the linker can not detect the use of global constructors.

       <b>--warn-multiple-gp</b>
           Warn if multiple global pointer values are required in the output file.  This is only meaningful  for
           certain processors, such as the Alpha.  Specifically, some processors put large-valued constants in a
           special  section.  A special register (the global pointer) points into the middle of this section, so
           that constants can be loaded efficiently via a base-register relative  addressing  mode.   Since  the
           offset  in base-register relative mode is fixed and relatively small (e.g., 16 bits), this limits the
           maximum size of the constant pool.  Thus, in large programs, it is often necessary  to  use  multiple
           global  pointer  values  in order to be able to address all possible constants.  This option causes a
           warning to be issued whenever this case occurs.

       <b>--warn-once</b>
           Only warn once for each undefined symbol, rather than once per module which refers to it.

       <b>--warn-section-align</b>
           Warn if the address of an output section is changed because of alignment.  Typically,  the  alignment
           will  be  set  by an input section.  The address will only be changed if it not explicitly specified;
           that is, if the "SECTIONS" command does not specify a start address for the section.

       <b>--warn-shared-textrel</b>
           Warn if the linker adds a DT_TEXTREL to a shared object.

       <b>--warn-alternate-em</b>
           Warn if an object has alternate ELF machine code.

       <b>--warn-unresolved-symbols</b>
           If the linker is going to report an unresolved symbol (see the option <b>--unresolved-symbols</b>)  it  will
           normally generate an error.  This option makes it generate a warning instead.

       <b>--error-unresolved-symbols</b>
           This  restores  the  linker's  default behaviour of generating errors when it is reporting unresolved
           symbols.

       <b>--whole-archive</b>
           For each archive mentioned on the command line after the <b>--whole-archive</b> option, include every object
           file in the archive in the link, rather than searching the archive for  the  required  object  files.
           This  is  normally  used  to  turn  an archive file into a shared library, forcing every object to be
           included in the resulting shared library.  This option may be used more than once.

           Two notes when using this option from gcc: First, gcc doesn't know about this option, so you have  to
           use  <b>-Wl,-whole-archive</b>.   Second,  don't  forget  to  use  <b>-Wl,-no-whole-archive</b>  after your list of
           archives, because gcc will add its own list of archives to your link and you may not want  this  flag
           to affect those as well.

       <b>--wrap=</b><u>symbol</u>
           Use  a  wrapper  function  for  <u>symbol</u>.   Any  undefined  reference  to  <u>symbol</u>  will  be resolved to
           "__wrap_<u>symbol</u>".  Any undefined reference to "__real_<u>symbol</u>" will be resolved to <u>symbol</u>.

           This can be used to provide a wrapper for a system function.  The wrapper function should  be  called
           "__wrap_<u>symbol</u>".  If it wishes to call the system function, it should call "__real_<u>symbol</u>".

           Here is a trivial example:

                   void *
                   __wrap_malloc (size_t c)
                   {
                     printf ("malloc called with %zu\n", c);
                     return __real_malloc (c);
                   }

           If  you  link other code with this file using <b>--wrap</b> <b>malloc</b>, then all calls to "malloc" will call the
           function "__wrap_malloc" instead.  The call to "__real_malloc" in "__wrap_malloc" will call the  real
           "malloc" function.

           You  may  wish to provide a "__real_malloc" function as well, so that links without the <b>--wrap</b> option
           will succeed.  If you do this, you should not put the definition of "__real_malloc" in the same  file
           as  "__wrap_malloc";  if you do, the assembler may resolve the call before the linker has a chance to
           wrap it to "malloc".

       <b>--eh-frame-hdr</b>
           Request creation of ".eh_frame_hdr" section and ELF "PT_GNU_EH_FRAME" segment header.

       <b>--enable-new-dtags</b>
       <b>--disable-new-dtags</b>
           This linker can create the new dynamic tags in ELF. But the older  ELF  systems  may  not  understand
           them.  If you specify <b>--enable-new-dtags</b>, the dynamic tags will be created as needed.  If you specify
           <b>--disable-new-dtags</b>, no new dynamic tags will be created. By default, the new dynamic  tags  are  not
           created. Note that those options are only available for ELF systems.

       <b>--hash-size=</b><u>number</u>
           Set  the default size of the linker's hash tables to a prime number close to <u>number</u>.  Increasing this
           value can reduce the length of time it takes the linker to perform  its  tasks,  at  the  expense  of
           increasing  the  linker's  memory  requirements.  Similarly reducing this value can reduce the memory
           requirements at the expense of speed.

       <b>--hash-style=</b><u>style</u>
           Set the type of linker's hash table(s).  <u>style</u> can be either "sysv" for classic ELF ".hash"  section,
           "gnu"  for new style GNU ".gnu.hash" section or "both" for both the classic ELF ".hash" and new style
           GNU ".gnu.hash" hash tables.  The default is "sysv".

       <b>--reduce-memory-overheads</b>
           This option reduces memory requirements at ld runtime, at the expense of  linking  speed.   This  was
           introduced  to select the old O(n^2) algorithm for link map file generation, rather than the new O(n)
           algorithm which uses about 40% more memory for symbol storage.

           Another effect of the switch is to set the default hash table size to 1021, which again saves  memory
           at the cost of lengthening the linker's run time.  This is not done however if the <b>--hash-size</b> switch
           has been used.

           The <b>--reduce-memory-overheads</b> switch may be also be used to enable other tradeoffs in future versions
           of the linker.

       <b>--build-id</b>
       <b>--build-id=</b><u>style</u>
           Request  creation of ".note.gnu.build-id" ELF note section.  The contents of the note are unique bits
           identifying this linked file.  <u>style</u> can be "uuid" to use 128 random bits, "sha1" to  use  a  160-bit
           SHA1  hash  on  the  normative  parts  of the output contents, "md5" to use a 128-bit MD5 hash on the
           normative parts of the output contents, or "0x<u>hexstring</u>" to use a chosen bit string specified  as  an
           even number of hexadecimal digits ("-" and ":" characters between digit pairs are ignored).  If <u>style</u>
           is omitted, "sha1" is used.

           The  "md5"  and  "sha1"  styles produces an identifier that is always the same in an identical output
           file, but will be unique among all nonidentical output files.  It is not intended to be compared as a
           checksum for the file's contents.  A linked file may be changed later by other tools, but  the  build
           ID bit string identifying the original linked file does not change.

           Passing  "none"  for  <u>style</u> disables the setting from any "--build-id" options earlier on the command
           line.

       The i386 PE linker supports the <b>-shared</b> option, which causes  the  output  to  be  a  dynamically  linked
       library  (DLL)  instead  of  a  normal  executable.  You should name the output "*.dll" when you use this
       option.  In addition, the linker fully supports the standard "*.def" files, which may be specified on the
       linker command line like an object file (in fact, it should precede archives it exports symbols from,  to
       ensure that they get linked in, just like a normal object file).

       In  addition  to  the  options  common to all targets, the i386 PE linker support additional command line
       options that are specific to the i386 PE target.  Options that take values may be  separated  from  their
       values by either a space or an equals sign.

       <b>--add-stdcall-alias</b>
           If  given,  symbols  with  a  stdcall  suffix  (@<u>nn</u>)  will be exported as-is and also with the suffix
           stripped.  [This option is specific to the i386 PE targeted port of the linker]

       <b>--base-file</b> <u>file</u>
           Use <u>file</u> as the name of a file in which to save the base addresses of all the relocations needed  for
           generating DLLs with <u>dlltool</u>.  [This is an i386 PE specific option]

       <b>--dll</b>
           Create  a  DLL instead of a regular executable.  You may also use <b>-shared</b> or specify a "LIBRARY" in a
           given ".def" file.  [This option is specific to the i386 PE targeted port of the linker]

       <b>--enable-long-section-names</b>
       <b>--disable-long-section-names</b>
           The PE variants of the Coff object format add an extension that permits  the  use  of  section  names
           longer than eight characters, the normal limit for Coff.  By default, these names are only allowed in
           object  files,  as  fully-linked  executable  images  do  not carry the Coff string table required to
           support the longer names.  As a GNU extension, it is possible to allow their use in executable images
           as well, or to (probably pointlessly!)  disallow it in object files,  by  using  these  two  options.
           Executable images generated with these long section names are slightly non-standard, carrying as they
           do  a string table, and may generate confusing output when examined with non-GNU PE-aware tools, such
           as file viewers and dumpers.  However, GDB relies on the use of PE long section names to find Dwarf-2
           debug information sections in an executable image at runtime, and so if neither option  is  specified
           on  the  command-line,  <b>ld</b>  will  enable  long  section names, overriding the default and technically
           correct behaviour, when it finds the presence of debug information while linking an executable  image
           and not stripping symbols.  [This option is valid for all PE targeted ports of the linker]

       <b>--enable-stdcall-fixup</b>
       <b>--disable-stdcall-fixup</b>
           If  the  link finds a symbol that it cannot resolve, it will attempt to do "fuzzy linking" by looking
           for another defined symbol that differs only in the format of the symbol name (cdecl vs stdcall)  and
           will  resolve that symbol by linking to the match.  For example, the undefined symbol "_foo" might be
           linked to the function "_foo@12", or the undefined symbol "_bar@16" might be linked to  the  function
           "_bar".   When  the  linker  does  this, it prints a warning, since it normally should have failed to
           link, but sometimes import libraries generated from third-party dlls may  need  this  feature  to  be
           usable.   If  you  specify <b>--enable-stdcall-fixup</b>, this feature is fully enabled and warnings are not
           printed.  If you specify <b>--disable-stdcall-fixup</b>, this feature is disabled and  such  mismatches  are
           considered to be errors.  [This option is specific to the i386 PE targeted port of the linker]

       <b>--leading-underscore</b>
       <b>--no-leading-underscore</b>
           For  most  targets  default symbol-prefix is an underscore and is defined in target's description. By
           this option it is possible to disable/enable the default underscore symbol-prefix.

       <b>--export-all-symbols</b>
           If given, all global symbols in the objects used to build a DLL will be exported by  the  DLL.   Note
           that  this  is  the  default  if  there otherwise wouldn't be any exported symbols.  When symbols are
           explicitly exported via DEF files or implicitly exported via function attributes, the default  is  to
           not  export  anything  else  unless  this  option  is  given.   Note  that  the symbols "DllMain@12",
           "DllEntryPoint@0", "DllMainCRTStartup@12", and  "impure_ptr"  will  not  be  automatically  exported.
           Also, symbols imported from other DLLs will not be re-exported, nor will symbols specifying the DLL's
           internal  layout  such  as  those  beginning  with "_head_" or ending with "_iname".  In addition, no
           symbols from "libgcc", "libstd++", "libmingw32", or "crtX.o" will be exported.  Symbols  whose  names
           begin  with "__rtti_" or "__builtin_" will not be exported, to help with C++ DLLs.  Finally, there is
           an extensive list of cygwin-private symbols that are not exported (obviously, this  applies  on  when
           building   DLLs   for   cygwin   targets).    These   cygwin-excludes   are:  "_cygwin_dll_entry@12",
           "_cygwin_crt0_common@8",       "_cygwin_noncygwin_dll_entry@12",       "_fmode",       "_impure_ptr",
           "cygwin_attach_dll",  "cygwin_premain0", "cygwin_premain1", "cygwin_premain2", "cygwin_premain3", and
           "environ".  [This option is specific to the i386 PE targeted port of the linker]

       <b>--exclude-symbols</b> <u>symbol</u><b>,</b><u>symbol</u><b>,...</b>
           Specifies a list of symbols which should not be automatically exported.   The  symbol  names  may  be
           delimited by commas or colons.  [This option is specific to the i386 PE targeted port of the linker]

       <b>--exclude-all-symbols</b>
           Specifies  no  symbols  should  be  automatically  exported.  [This option is specific to the i386 PE
           targeted port of the linker]

       <b>--file-alignment</b>
           Specify the file alignment.  Sections in the file  will  always  begin  at  file  offsets  which  are
           multiples  of  this  number.  This defaults to 512.  [This option is specific to the i386 PE targeted
           port of the linker]

       <b>--heap</b> <u>reserve</u>
       <b>--heap</b> <u>reserve</u><b>,</b><u>commit</u>
           Specify the number of bytes of memory to reserve (and optionally commit) to be used as heap for  this
           program.   The  default  is  1Mb  reserved,  4K  committed.   [This option is specific to the i386 PE
           targeted port of the linker]

       <b>--image-base</b> <u>value</u>
           Use <u>value</u> as the base address of your program or dll.  This is the lowest memory location  that  will
           be  used  when your program or dll is loaded.  To reduce the need to relocate and improve performance
           of your dlls, each should have a unique base address and not overlap any other dlls.  The default  is
           0x400000  for executables, and 0x10000000 for dlls.  [This option is specific to the i386 PE targeted
           port of the linker]

       <b>--kill-at</b>
           If given, the stdcall suffixes (@<u>nn</u>) will be stripped from symbols before they are  exported.   [This
           option is specific to the i386 PE targeted port of the linker]

       <b>--large-address-aware</b>
           If  given,  the  appropriate bit in the "Characteristics" field of the COFF header is set to indicate
           that this executable supports virtual addresses greater than 2 gigabytes.  This  should  be  used  in
           conjunction  with  the /3GB or /USERVA=<u>value</u> megabytes switch in the "[operating systems]" section of
           the BOOT.INI.  Otherwise, this bit has no effect.  [This option is specific to PE targeted  ports  of
           the linker]

       <b>--major-image-version</b> <u>value</u>
           Sets  the  major number of the "image version".  Defaults to 1.  [This option is specific to the i386
           PE targeted port of the linker]

       <b>--major-os-version</b> <u>value</u>
           Sets the major number of the "os version".  Defaults to 4.  [This option is specific to the  i386  PE
           targeted port of the linker]

       <b>--major-subsystem-version</b> <u>value</u>
           Sets  the  major  number of the "subsystem version".  Defaults to 4.  [This option is specific to the
           i386 PE targeted port of the linker]

       <b>--minor-image-version</b> <u>value</u>
           Sets the minor number of the "image version".  Defaults to 0.  [This option is specific to  the  i386
           PE targeted port of the linker]

       <b>--minor-os-version</b> <u>value</u>
           Sets  the  minor number of the "os version".  Defaults to 0.  [This option is specific to the i386 PE
           targeted port of the linker]

       <b>--minor-subsystem-version</b> <u>value</u>
           Sets the minor number of the "subsystem version".  Defaults to 0.  [This option is  specific  to  the
           i386 PE targeted port of the linker]

       <b>--output-def</b> <u>file</u>
           The  linker  will  create  the  file  <u>file</u> which will contain a DEF file corresponding to the DLL the
           linker is generating.  This DEF file (which should be called "*.def") may be used to create an import
           library with "dlltool" or may be used as a reference to automatically or implicitly exported symbols.
           [This option is specific to the i386 PE targeted port of the linker]

       <b>--out-implib</b> <u>file</u>
           The linker will create the file <u>file</u> which will contain an import lib corresponding to  the  DLL  the
           linker  is generating. This import lib (which should be called "*.dll.a" or "*.a" may be used to link
           clients against the generated DLL; this behaviour makes it possible  to  skip  a  separate  "dlltool"
           import library creation step.  [This option is specific to the i386 PE targeted port of the linker]

       <b>--enable-auto-image-base</b>
           Automatically  choose  the  image  base  for  DLLs,  unless one is specified using the "--image-base"
           argument.  By using a hash generated from the dllname to create unique image bases for each DLL,  in-
           memory  collisions  and  relocations  which can delay program execution are avoided.  [This option is
           specific to the i386 PE targeted port of the linker]

       <b>--disable-auto-image-base</b>
           Do not automatically generate a unique  image  base.   If  there  is  no  user-specified  image  base
           ("--image-base")  then  use  the  platform default.  [This option is specific to the i386 PE targeted
           port of the linker]

       <b>--dll-search-prefix</b> <u>string</u>
           When linking dynamically to a dll without an import library, search for  "&lt;string&gt;&lt;basename&gt;.dll"  in
           preference  to "lib&lt;basename&gt;.dll". This behaviour allows easy distinction between DLLs built for the
           various "subplatforms": native, cygwin, uwin, pw, etc.   For  instance,  cygwin  DLLs  typically  use
           "--dll-search-prefix=cyg".  [This option is specific to the i386 PE targeted port of the linker]

       <b>--enable-auto-import</b>
           Do  sophisticated  linking of "_symbol" to "__imp__symbol" for DATA imports from DLLs, and create the
           necessary thunking symbols when building the import libraries with those DATA exports. Note:  Use  of
           the  'auto-import'  extension will cause the text section of the image file to be made writable. This
           does not conform to the PE-COFF format specification published by Microsoft.

           Note - use of the 'auto-import' extension will also cause read only  data  which  would  normally  be
           placed into the .rdata section to be placed into the .data section instead.  This is in order to work
           around        a       problem       with       consts       that       is       described       here:
           <a href="http://www.cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/2004-09/msg01101.html">http://www.cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/2004-09/msg01101.html</a>

           Using 'auto-import' generally will 'just work' -- but sometimes you may see this message:

           "variable   '&lt;var&gt;'   can't   be   auto-imported.   Please   read   the   documentation   for    ld's
           "--enable-auto-import" for details."

           This  message occurs when some (sub)expression accesses an address ultimately given by the sum of two
           constants (Win32 import tables only allow one).  Instances where this may occur include  accesses  to
           member  fields  of  struct  variables  imported from a DLL, as well as using a constant index into an
           array variable imported from a DLL.  Any multiword variable (arrays, structs,  long  long,  etc)  may
           trigger  this  error condition.  However, regardless of the exact data type of the offending exported
           variable, ld will always detect it, issue the warning, and exit.

           There are several ways to address this difficulty, regardless  of  the  data  type  of  the  exported
           variable:

           One  way is to use --enable-runtime-pseudo-reloc switch. This leaves the task of adjusting references
           in your client code for runtime environment, so this  method  works  only  when  runtime  environment
           supports this feature.

           A  second  solution  is  to force one of the 'constants' to be a variable -- that is, unknown and un-
           optimizable at compile time.  For arrays, there are two  possibilities:  a)  make  the  indexee  (the
           array's address) a variable, or b) make the 'constant' index a variable.  Thus:

                   extern type extern_array[];
                   extern_array[1] --&gt;
                      { volatile type *t=extern_array; t[1] }

           or

                   extern type extern_array[];
                   extern_array[1] --&gt;
                      { volatile int t=1; extern_array[t] }

           For  structs  (and  most other multiword data types) the only option is to make the struct itself (or
           the long long, or the ...) variable:

                   extern struct s extern_struct;
                   extern_struct.field --&gt;
                      { volatile struct s *t=&amp;extern_struct; t-&gt;field }

           or

                   extern long long extern_ll;
                   extern_ll --&gt;
                     { volatile long long * local_ll=&amp;extern_ll; *local_ll }

           A third method of dealing with this difficulty is to abandon 'auto-import' for the  offending  symbol
           and  mark  it  with  "__declspec(dllimport)".   However, in practise that requires using compile-time
           #defines to indicate whether you are building a DLL, building client code that will link to the  DLL,
           or merely building/linking to a static library.   In making the choice between the various methods of
           resolving  the  'direct address with constant offset' problem, you should consider typical real-world
           usage:

           Original:

                   --foo.h
                   extern int arr[];
                   --foo.c
                   #include "foo.h"
                   void main(int argc, char **argv){
                     printf("%d\n",arr[1]);
                   }

           Solution 1:

                   --foo.h
                   extern int arr[];
                   --foo.c
                   #include "foo.h"
                   void main(int argc, char **argv){
                     /* This workaround is for win32 and cygwin; do not "optimize" */
                     volatile int *parr = arr;
                     printf("%d\n",parr[1]);
                   }

           Solution 2:

                   --foo.h
                   /* Note: auto-export is assumed (no __declspec(dllexport)) */
                   #if (defined(_WIN32) || defined(__CYGWIN__)) &amp;&amp; \
                     !(defined(FOO_BUILD_DLL) || defined(FOO_STATIC))
                   #define FOO_IMPORT __declspec(dllimport)
                   #else
                   #define FOO_IMPORT
                   #endif
                   extern FOO_IMPORT int arr[];
                   --foo.c
                   #include "foo.h"
                   void main(int argc, char **argv){
                     printf("%d\n",arr[1]);
                   }

           A fourth way to avoid this problem is to re-code your library to use a  functional  interface  rather
           than  a data interface for the offending variables (e.g. <u>set_foo()</u> and <u>get_foo()</u> accessor functions).

       <b>--disable-auto-import</b>
           Do not attempt to do sophisticated linking of "_symbol" to  "__imp__symbol"  for  DATA  imports  from
           DLLs.  [This option is specific to the i386 PE targeted port of the linker]

       <b>--enable-runtime-pseudo-reloc</b>
           If  your  code  contains expressions described in --enable-auto-import section, that is, DATA imports
           from DLL with non-zero offset, this switch will create a vector of 'runtime pseudo relocations' which
           can be used by runtime environment to adjust references to such data  in  your  client  code.   [This
           option is specific to the i386 PE targeted port of the linker]

       <b>--disable-runtime-pseudo-reloc</b>
           Do  not  create  pseudo relocations for non-zero offset DATA imports from DLLs.  This is the default.
           [This option is specific to the i386 PE targeted port of the linker]

       <b>--enable-extra-pe-debug</b>
           Show additional debug info related to auto-import symbol thunking.  [This option is specific  to  the
           i386 PE targeted port of the linker]

       <b>--section-alignment</b>
           Sets  the  section alignment.  Sections in memory will always begin at addresses which are a multiple
           of this number.  Defaults to 0x1000.  [This option is specific to the i386 PE targeted  port  of  the
           linker]

       <b>--stack</b> <u>reserve</u>
       <b>--stack</b> <u>reserve</u><b>,</b><u>commit</u>
           Specify the number of bytes of memory to reserve (and optionally commit) to be used as stack for this
           program.   The  default  is  2Mb  reserved,  4K  committed.   [This option is specific to the i386 PE
           targeted port of the linker]

       <b>--subsystem</b> <u>which</u>
       <b>--subsystem</b> <u>which</u><b>:</b><u>major</u>
       <b>--subsystem</b> <u>which</u><b>:</b><u>major</u><b>.</b><u>minor</u>
           Specifies the subsystem under which your program will  execute.   The  legal  values  for  <u>which</u>  are
           "native",  "windows",  "console",  "posix", and "xbox".  You may optionally set the subsystem version
           also.  Numeric values are also accepted for <u>which</u>.  [This option is specific to the i386 PE  targeted

           The  following  options  set  flags  in  the "DllCharacteristics" field of the PE file header: [These
           options are specific to PE targeted ports of the linker]

       <b>--dynamicbase</b>
           The image base address may be relocated  using  address  space  layout  randomization  (ASLR).   This
           feature was introduced with MS Windows Vista for i386 PE targets.

       <b>--forceinteg</b>
           Code integrity checks are enforced.

       <b>--nxcompat</b>
           The  image  is  compatible  with  the Data Execution Prevention.  This feature was introduced with MS
           Windows XP SP2 for i386 PE targets.

       <b>--no-isolation</b>
           Although the image understands isolation, do not isolate the image.

       <b>--no-seh</b>
           The image does not use SEH. No SE handler may be called from this image.

       <b>--no-bind</b>
           Do not bind this image.

       <b>--wdmdriver</b>
           The driver uses the MS Windows Driver Model.

       <b>--tsaware</b>
           The image is Terminal Server aware.

       The 68HC11 and 68HC12 linkers support specific options to control the memory bank switching  mapping  and
       trampoline code generation.

       <b>--no-trampoline</b>
           This  option disables the generation of trampoline. By default a trampoline is generated for each far
           function which is called using a "jsr" instruction (this happens when a pointer to a far function  is
           taken).

       <b>--bank-window</b> <u>name</u>
           This  option  indicates  to the linker the name of the memory region in the <b>MEMORY</b> specification that
           describes the memory bank window.  The definition of such region  is  then  used  by  the  linker  to
           compute paging and addresses within the memory window.

       The following options are supported to control handling of GOT generation when linking for 68K targets.

       <b>--got=</b><u>type</u>
           This  option  tells  the  linker  which  GOT generation scheme to use.  <u>type</u> should be one of <b>single</b>,
           <b>negative</b>, <b>multigot</b> or <b>target</b>.  For more information refer to the Info entry for <u>ld</u>.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       You can change the behaviour  of  <b>ld</b>  with  the  environment  variables  "GNUTARGET",  "LDEMULATION"  and
       "COLLECT_NO_DEMANGLE".

       "GNUTARGET"  determines  the input-file object format if you don't use <b>-b</b> (or its synonym <b>--format</b>).  Its
       value should be one of the BFD names for an input format.  If there is no "GNUTARGET" in the environment,
       <b>ld</b> uses the natural format of the target. If "GNUTARGET"  is  set  to  "default"  then  BFD  attempts  to
       discover  the  input  format  by  examining binary input files; this method often succeeds, but there are
       potential ambiguities, since there is no method of ensuring that the magic number used to specify object-
       file formats is unique.  However,  the  configuration  procedure  for  BFD  on  each  system  places  the
       conventional  format  for  that  system first in the search-list, so ambiguities are resolved in favor of
       convention.

       "LDEMULATION" determines the default emulation if you don't use the <b>-m</b> option.  The emulation can  affect
       various  aspects of linker behaviour, particularly the default linker script.  You can list the available
       emulations with the <b>--verbose</b> or <b>-V</b> options.  If the  <b>-m</b>  option  is  not  used,  and  the  "LDEMULATION"
       environment variable is not defined, the default emulation depends upon how the linker was configured.

       Normally, the linker will default to demangling symbols.  However, if "COLLECT_NO_DEMANGLE" is set in the
       environment,  then  it  will  default  to not demangling symbols.  This environment variable is used in a
       similar fashion by the "gcc" linker wrapper program.  The default may be overridden by the <b>--demangle</b> and
       <b>--no-demangle</b> options.
