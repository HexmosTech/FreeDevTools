</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       ld.lld — ELF linker from the LLVM project

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ld.lld</b> [<u>options</u>] <u>objfile</u> <u>...</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       A  linker takes one or more object, archive, and library files, and combines them into an output file (an
       executable, a shared library, or another object file).  It relocates code and data from the  input  files
       and resolves symbol references between them.

       <b>ld.lld</b>  is  a  drop-in replacement for the GNU BFD and gold linkers.  It accepts most of the same command
       line arguments and linker scripts as GNU linkers.

       <b>ld.lld</b> currently supports i386, x86-64, ARM,  AArch64,  PowerPC32,  PowerPC64,  MIPS32,  MIPS64,  RISC-V,
       AMDGPU,  Hexagon  and SPARC V9 targets.  <b>ld.lld</b> acts as a Microsoft link.exe-compatible linker if invoked
       as <b>lld-link</b> and as macOS's ld if invoked as <b>ld.ld64.</b> All  these  targets  are  always  supported  however
       <b>ld.lld</b> was built, so you can always use <b>ld.lld</b> as a native linker as well as a cross linker.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Many  options have both a single-letter and long form.  When using the long form options other than those
       beginning with the letter <b>o</b> may be specified using either one or two dashes preceding  the  option  name.
       Long options beginning with <b>o</b> require two dashes to avoid confusion with the <b>-o</b> <u>path</u> option.

       <b>--allow-multiple-definition</b>
               Do not error if a symbol is defined multiple times.  The first definition will be used.

       <b>--allow-shlib-undefined</b>
               Allow  unresolved references in shared libraries.  This option is enabled by default when linking
               a shared library.

       <b>--apply-dynamic-relocs</b>
               Apply link-time values for dynamic relocations.

       <b>--ignore-data-address-equality</b>
               Ignore address equality of data. C/C++ requires each data to have a unique address.  This  option
               allows lld to do unsafe optimization that breaks the requirement: create copies of read-only data
               or merge two or more read-only data that happen to have the same value.

       <b>--ignore-function-address-equality</b>
               Ignore  address  equality of functions.  This option allows non-PIC calls to a function with non-

               Pruning policy for the ThinLTO cache.

       <b>--thinlto-jobs</b>=<u>value</u>
               Number of ThinLTO jobs.

       <b>--threads</b>=<u>N</u>
               Number  of  threads.  <b>all</b> (default) means all of concurrent threads supported.  <b>1</b> disables multi-
               threading.

       <b>--time-trace</b>
               Record time trace.

       <b>--time-trace-file</b>=<u>file</u>
               Write time trace output to <u>file</u>.

       <b>--time-trace-granularity</b>=<u>value</u>
               Minimum time granularity (in microseconds) traced by time profiler.

       <b>--trace</b>
               Print the names of the input files.

       <b>--trace-symbol</b>=<u>symbol</u>, <b>-y</b> <u>symbol</u>
               Trace references to <u>symbol</u>.

       <b>--undefined</b>=<u>symbol</u>, <b>-u</b> <u>symbol</u>
               If <u>symbol</u> is not defined after symbol resolution, and there's a static library that  contains  an
               object file defining the symbol, load the member to include the object file in the output file.

       <b>--undefined-glob</b>=<u>pattern</u>
               Synonym  for <b>--undefined</b>, except that it takes a glob pattern.  In a glob pattern, <b>*</b> matches zero
               or more characters, ?  matches any single character, and  <b>[...]</b>  matches  the  characters  within
               brackets.   All symbols that match a given pattern are handled as if they were given as arguments
               of <b>--undefined</b>.

       <b>-v</b>      Display the version number and proceed with linking if object files are specified.

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--version</b>
               Display the version number and exit.

       <b>--verbose</b>
               Verbose mode.

       <b>--version-script</b>=<u>file</u>
               Read version script from <u>file</u>.

       <b>--warn-backrefs</b>
               Warn about reverse or cyclic dependencies to or between static archives.  This  can  be  used  to
               ensure linker invocation remains compatible with traditional Unix-like linkers.

       <b>--warn-backrefs-exclude</b>=<u>glob</u>
               Glob  describing  an  archive  (or an object file within --start-lib) which should be ignored for
               <b>--warn-backrefs</b>

       <b>--warn-common</b>
               Warn about duplicate common symbols.

       <b>--warn-ifunc-textrel</b>
               Warn about using ifunc symbols in conjunction with text relocations.   Older  versions  of  glibc
               library  (2.28  and  earlier) has a bug that causes the segment that includes ifunc symbols to be
               marked as not executable when they are relocated.  As a result, although the program compiles and
               links successfully, it gives segmentation fault when the instruction  pointer  reaches  an  ifunc
               symbol.   Use  -warn-ifunc-textrel  to  let  lld  give  a  warning, if the code may include ifunc
               symbols, may do text relocations and be linked with an older glibc version.  Otherwise, there  is
               no  need  to use it, as the default value does not give a warning.  This flag has been introduced
               in late 2018, has no counter part in ld and gold linkers, and may be removed in the future.

       <b>--warn-unresolved-symbols</b>
               Report unresolved symbols as warnings.

       <b>--whole-archive</b>
               Force load of all members in a static library.

       <b>--wrap</b>=<u>symbol</u>
               Use wrapper functions for symbol.

       <b>-z</b> <u>option</u>
               Linker option extensions.

               <b>dead-reloc-in-nonalloc</b>=<u>section_glob=value</u>
                       Resolve a relocation in a matched non-SHF_ALLOC section referencing a discarded symbol to
                       <u>value</u> Accepts globs, in the event of a section matching more than one  option,  the  last
                       option  takes  precedence.  An  order  of  least  specific  to  most  specific  match  is
                       recommended.

               <b>execstack</b>
                       Make the main stack executable.  Stack  permissions  are  recorded  in  the  PT_GNU_STACK
                       segment.

               <b>force-bti</b>
                       Force  enable  AArch64  BTI  instruction  in  PLT,  warn  if Input ELF file does not have
                       GNU_PROPERTY_AARCH64_FEATURE_1_BTI property.

                       Force enable Intel Indirect Branch Tracking in PLT, warn if an input ELF  file  does  not
                       have GNU_PROPERTY_X86_FEATURE_1_IBT property.

               <b>global</b>  Sets  the  DF_1_GLOBAL  flag in the DYNAMIC section.  Different loaders can decide how to
                       handle this flag on their own.

               <b>ifunc-noplt</b>
                       Do not emit PLT entries for ifunc symbols.  Instead, emit  text  relocations  referencing
                       the  resolver.   This  is  an  experimental optimization and only suitable for standalone
                       environments where text relocations do not have the usual drawbacks.  This option must be
                       combined with the <b>-z</b> <b>notext</b> option.

               <b>initfirst</b>
                       Sets the DF_1_INITFIRST flag to indicate the module should be initialized first.

               <b>interpose</b>
                       Set the DF_1_INTERPOSE flag to indicate to the runtime  linker  that  the  object  is  an
                       interposer.   During symbol resolution interposers are searched after the application but
                       before other dependencies.

               <b>muldefs</b>
                       Do not error if a symbol is defined multiple times.  The first definition will  be  used.
                       This is a synonym for <b>--allow-multiple-definition.</b>

               <b>nocombreloc</b>
                       Disable combining and sorting multiple relocation sections.

               <b>nocopyreloc</b>
                       Disable the creation of copy relocations.

               <b>nodefaultlib</b>
                       Set  the  DF_1_NODEFLIB  flag  to  indicate  that  default library search paths should be
                       ignored.

               <b>nodelete</b>
                       Set the DF_1_NODELETE flag to indicate that the object cannot be unloaded from a process.

               <b>nodlopen</b>
                       Set the DF_1_NOOPEN flag to indicate that the object may not be opened by <u><a href="../man3/dlopen.3.html">dlopen</a></u>(3).

               <b>nognustack</b>
                       Do not emit the PT_GNU_STACK segment.

               <b>norelro</b>
                       Do not indicate that portions of the object should  be  mapped  read-only  after  initial
                       relocation processing.  The object will omit the PT_GNU_RELRO segment.

               <b>notext</b>  Allow  relocations  against  read-only segments.  Sets the DT_TEXTREL flag in the DYNAMIC
                       section.

               <b>now</b>     Set the DF_BIND_NOW flag  to  indicate  that  the  run-time  loader  should  perform  all
                       relocation  processing  as  part of object initialization.  By default relocations may be
                       performed on demand.

               <b>origin</b>  Set the DF_ORIGIN flag to indicate that the object requires $ORIGIN processing.

               <b>pac-plt</b>
                       AArch64 only, use pointer authentication in PLT.

               <b>rela</b>    Use RELA format for dynamic relocations.

               <b>retpolineplt</b>
                       Emit retpoline format PLT entries as a mitigation for CVE-2017-5715.

               <b>rodynamic</b>
                       Make the <b>.dynamic</b> section read-only.  The DT_DEBUG tag will not be emitted.

</pre><h4><b>IMPLEMENTATION</b> <b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ld.lld</b>'s handing of archive files (those with a <u>.a</u> file extension) is different from traditional  linkers
       used on Unix-like systems.

       Traditional  linkers  maintain a set of undefined symbols during linking.  The linker processes each file
       in the order in which it appears on the command line, until the set of undefined symbols  becomes  empty.
       An  object file is linked into the output object when it is encountered, with its undefined symbols added
       to the set.  Upon encountering an archive file  a  traditional  linker  searches  the  objects  contained
       therein, and processes those that satisfy symbols in the unresolved set.

       Handling  mutually  dependent archives may be awkward when using a traditional linker.  Archive files may
       have to be specified multiple times, or the special command line options  <b>--start-group</b>  and  <b>--end-group</b>
       may  be  used  to  have the linker loop over the files in the group until no new symbols are added to the
       set.

       <b>ld.lld</b> records all symbols found in objects and archives as it  iterates  over  command  line  arguments.
       When  <b>ld.lld</b>  encounters  an  undefined  symbol  that  can  be  resolved by an object file contained in a
       previously processed archive file, it immediately extracts and links it into the output object.

       With certain archive inputs <b>ld.lld</b> may produce different results compared  to  traditional  linkers.   In
       practice, large bodies of third party software have been linked with <b>ld.lld</b> without material issues.

       The  <b>--warn-backrefs</b>  option  may  be  used to identify a linker invocation that may be incompatible with
       traditional Unix-like linker behavior.
