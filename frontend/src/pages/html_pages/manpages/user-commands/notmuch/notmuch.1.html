</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       notmuch - thread-based email index, search, and tagging

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>notmuch</b> [option ...] <b>command</b> [arg ...]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Notmuch  is  a command-line based program for indexing, searching, reading, and tagging large collections
       of email messages.

       This page describes how to get started using notmuch from the command line, and gives a brief overview of
       the commands available. For more information on e.g. <b>notmuch</b> <b>show</b> consult the <u>notmuch-show</u> man page, also
       accessible via <b>notmuch</b> <b>help</b> <b>show</b>

       The quickest way to get started with Notmuch is to simply invoke the <b>notmuch</b> command with  no  arguments,
       which will interactively guide you through the process of indexing your mail.

</pre><h4><b>NOTE</b></h4><pre>
       While  the  command-line  program  <b>notmuch</b>  provides powerful functionality, it does not provide the most
       convenient interface for that functionality. More sophisticated interfaces are expected to  be  built  on
       top  of either the command-line interface, or more likely, on top of the notmuch library interface. See ‚Äê
       <u>https://notmuchmail.org</u> for more about alternate interfaces to  notmuch.  The  emacs-based  interface  to
       notmuch  (available  under <b>emacs/</b> in the Notmuch source distribution) is probably the most widely used at
       this time.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Supported global options for <b>notmuch</b> include

       <b>--help</b> <b>[command-name]</b>
              Print a synopsis of available commands and exit. With an optional command name, show the man  page
              for that subcommand.

       <b>--version</b>
              Print the installed version of notmuch, and exit.

       <b>--config=FILE</b>
              Specify  the  configuration  file  to  use.  This  overrides  any  configuration file specified by
              <u>NOTMUCH_CONFIG</u>. The empty string is a permitted and sometimes useful value of  <u>FILE</u>,  which  tells
              <b>notmuch</b> to use only configuration metadata from the database.

       <b>--uuid=HEX</b>
              Enforce  that  the  database  UUID  (a unique identifier which persists until e.g. the database is
              compacted) is HEX; exit with an error if  it  is  not.  This  is  useful  to  detect  rollover  in
              modification counts on messages. You can find this UUID using e.g. <b>notmuch</b> <b>count</b> <b>--lastmod</b>

       All  global  options  except  <b>--config</b>  can  also  be  specified  after the command. For example, <b>notmuch</b>
       <b>subcommand</b> <b>--uuid=HEX</b> is equivalent to <b>notmuch</b> <b>--uuid=HEX</b> <b>subcommand</b>.

</pre><h4><b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>SETUP</b>
       The <b>notmuch</b> <b>setup</b> command is used to configure Notmuch for first use, (or to reconfigure it later).

       The setup command will prompt for your full  name,  your  primary  email  address,  any  alternate  email
       addresses  you  use,  and the directory containing your email archives. Your answers will be written to a
       configuration file in <u>NOTMUCH_CONFIG</u> (if set) or ${HOME}/.notmuch-config . This configuration  file  will
       be  created  with descriptive comments, making it easy to edit by hand later to change the configuration.
       Or you can run <b>notmuch</b> <b>setup</b> again to change the configuration.

       The mail directory you specify can contain any number of sub-directories  and  should  primarily  contain
       only  files  with individual email messages (eg. maildir or mh archives are perfect). If there are other,
       non-email files (such as indexes maintained by other email programs) then notmuch will  do  its  best  to
       detect those and ignore them.

       Mail  storage  that  uses  mbox  format, (where one mbox file contains many messages), will not work with
       notmuch. If that's how your mail is currently stored, it is recommended you first convert it  to  maildir
       format with a utility such as <u><a href="../man1/mb2md.1.html">mb2md</a>(1)</u> <u>before</u> <u>running</u> <b>notmuch</b> <b>setup</b><u>.</u>

       <u>Invoking</u>  <b>notmuch</b>  <u>with</u>  <u>no</u>  <u>command</u> <u>argument</u> <u>will</u> <u>run</u> <b>setup</b> <u>if</u> <u>the</u> <u>setup</u> <u>command</u> <u>has</u> <u>not</u> <u>previously</u> <u>been</u>
       <u>completed.</u>

   <b>OTHER</b> <b>COMMANDS</b>
       Several of the notmuch commands accept search terms with a common syntax.  See  <u>notmuch-search-terms</u>  for
       more details on the supported syntax.

       The  <u>notmuch-search</u>, <u>notmuch-show</u>, <u>notmuch-address</u> and <u>notmuch-count</u> commands are used to query the email
       database.

       The <u>notmuch-reply</u> command is useful for preparing a template for an email reply.

       The <u>notmuch-tag</u> command is the only command available for manipulating database contents.

       The <u>notmuch-dump</u> and <u>notmuch-restore</u> commands can be used to create a textual  dump  of  email  tags  for
       backup purposes, and to restore from that dump.

       The <u>notmuch-config</u> command can be used to get or set settings in the notmuch configuration file.

   <b>EXTERNAL</b> <b>COMMANDS</b>
       If  the given command is not known to notmuch, notmuch tries to execute the external <b>notmuch-&lt;subcommand&gt;</b>
       in <b>PATH</b> instead. This allows users to have their own notmuch related tools to  be  run  via  the  notmuch
       command.  By design, this does not allow notmuch's own commands to be overridden using external commands.
       The environment variable <u>NOTMUCH_CONFIG</u> will be set according to <u>--config</u>, if the latter is present.

   <b>OPTION</b> <b>SYNTAX</b>
       All options accepting an argument can be used with '=' or ':' as a separator. Except for boolean  options
       (which would be ambiguous), a space can also be used as a separator. The following are all equivalent:

          notmuch --config=alt-config config get user.name
          notmuch --config:alt-config config get user.name
          notmuch --config alt-config config get user.name

</pre><h4><b>DUPLICATE</b> <b>MESSAGE</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       Notmuch  considers the <u>Message-ID</u> to be the primary identifier of message. Per <u>RFC</u> <u>5322</u> the <u>Message-ID</u> is
       supposed to be globally unique, but this fails in two distinct ways. When you receive copies of a message
       via a mechanism like <u>Cc</u> or via a mailing list, the copies are typically interchangeable. In the  case  of
       some  broken  mail  sending  software, the same <u>Message-ID</u> is used for completely unrelated messages. The
       options <u>search</u> <u>--duplicate</u> and <u>show</u> <u>--duplicate</u> options provide the user with control over which  message
       file  is  displayed.  Front  ends  will need to provide their own interface, see e.g. the Emacs front-end
       <u>Dealing</u> <u>with</u> <u>duplicates</u>.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       The following environment variables can be used to control the behavior of notmuch.

       <b>NOTMUCH_CONFIG</b>
              Specifies the location of the notmuch configuration file. See <u>notmuch-config</u> for details.

       <b>NOTMUCH_DATABASE</b>
              Specifies the location of the notmuch database. See <u>notmuch-config</u> for details.

       <b>NOTMUCH_PROFILE</b>
              Selects among notmuch configurations. See <u>notmuch-config</u> for details.

       <b>NOTMUCH_TALLOC_REPORT</b>
              Location to write a talloc memory usage report. See  <b>talloc_enable_leak_report_full</b>  in  <u><a href="../man3/talloc.3.html">talloc</a>(3)</u>
              <u>for</u> <u>more</u> <u>information.</u>

       <b>NOTMUCH_DEBUG_QUERY</b>
              If  set  to  a  non-empty  value,  the  notmuch  library  will print (to stderr) Xapian queries it
              constructs.

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       <u>notmuch-address</u>,   <u>notmuch-compact</u>,   <u>notmuch-config</u>,   <u>notmuch-count</u>,    <u>notmuch-dump</u>,    <u>notmuch-hooks</u>,
       <u>notmuch-insert</u>,   <u>notmuch-new</u>,   <u>notmuch-properties</u>,   <u>notmuch-reindex</u>,  <u>notmuch-reply</u>,  <u>notmuch-restore</u>,
