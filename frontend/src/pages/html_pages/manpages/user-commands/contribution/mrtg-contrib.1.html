       mrtg-contrib - Contribution Guidelines for MRTG

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       If you have written an extension to mrtg or created a bug fix, please consider contributing it to the
       project. As I get quite a number of contributions every week, here are a few guidelines which explain how
       to contribute so that I can use the contribution without too much additional work.

   <b>Translations</b>
       MRTG messages have been translated to a number of languages but there are still many which have not been
       covered yet. If you want to add yours, go into the <u>mrtg-2.17.10/translate</u> directory and follow the
       instructions given in the <u>README</u> file.

   <b>Patches</b>
       When you have created your modification or extension to mrtg and want to submit it to me, please crate a
       patch for the files which you have modified.  Do not send entire files unless they are new.

       To create a patch, get hold of a copy of GNU diff (Many Unix systems will have this installed already. In
       the NT world you might want to get <a href="http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/">http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/</a> to get all the nice GNU tools
       available.)  and type

        diff --unified --ignore-space-change old-file new-file &gt; simple.patch

       or if you have modified several files do

        diff --recursive --unified --ignore-space-change old-dir/ new-dir/ &gt;long.patch

   <b>Documentation</b>
       All documentation of mrtg is done with the perl <b>POD</b> system. If you want to learn about it, type

        perldoc perlpod

       and read the instructions. If you have bugfixes or additions to the existing documents, make sure you
       modify the <b>POD</b> files and not the html or txt versions.

       I take documentation very seriously. Whenever you create a new feature for mrtg which you want to get
       included in the official release, your patch must also contain modifications for the relevant <b>pod</b> file in
       the <u>doc</u> tree or for the documentation sections of <u>cfgmaker</u> and <u>indexmaker</u>.
