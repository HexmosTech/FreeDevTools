</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       trisetcmp - Compare triangulations between two Regina data files

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>trisetcmp</b> [ <b>-m</b> | <b>-n</b> ] [ <b>-s</b> ] <u>file1</u> <u>file2</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Compares  all triangulations in the first file against all triangulations in the second file, looking for
       pairs of triangulations that are combinatorially isomorphic.

       The two given files must be Regina data files.  A full list of matches (or a full list of non-matches  if
       <b>-n</b>  is  passed)  is  written  to  standard  output.  A match occurs when some triangulation from <u>file1</u> is
       combinatorially isomorphic to some triangulation from <u>file2</u> (i.e.,  identical  up  to  a  relabelling  of
       tetrahedra and their vertices).

       This  utility  can also do subcomplex testing instead of full isomorphism testing.  See the option <b>-s</b> for
       details.

       This utility compares both 3-manifold and 4-manifold triangulations (but no other dimensions at present).
       However, it will only compare triangulations of the same dimension  -  it  will  not  test  whether  some
       3-manifold triangulation appears as a subcomplex of some other 4-manifold triangulation.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-m</b> <b>(default)</b>
              Output matches only.  All isomorphic matches between triangulations in <u>file1</u> and triangulations in
              <u>file2</u> will be listed.

       <b>-n</b>     Output  non-matches only.  All triangulations from <u>file1</u> with no isomorphic match in <u>file2</u> will be
              listed, and vice versa.

              If <b>-s</b> is passed then non-matches are tested in  one  direction  only,  not  both;  see  below  for
              details.

       <b>-s</b>     Instead of testing triangulations for isomorphism, test whether one triangulation is isomorphic to
              a subcomplex of the other.

              In  the  default  case  of  <b>-m</b>  (output  matches only), this program outputs all instances where a
              triangulation from <u>file1</u> is isomorphic to a subcomplex of a triangulation from <u>file2</u>.

              In the case of <b>-n</b> (output non-matches only), this program outputs all  triangulations  from  <u>file1</u>
              that are not isomorphic to a subcomplex of any triangulation from <u>file2</u>.

</pre><h4><b>INTERNATIONALISATION</b></h4><pre>
       If  any  packets  contain  international  characters,  Regina will attempt to convert these to your local
       character encoding as it writes them to the output.

       You can tell Regina what character  encoding  to  use  by  setting  standard  locale-related  environment
       variables, such as <b>LANG</b>, <b>LC_CTYPE</b> or <b>LC_ALL</b>.

       For  example,  if  <b>LANG</b> is set to en_AU then output will be written in the Western European character set
       ISO-8859-1, and if <b>LANG</b> is set to en_AU.UTF-8 then output will be written in the universal character  set
       UTF-8.

       Typically these environment variables will already be set for you when you install your <b>GNU/Linux</b> system,
       and Regina will just use the right character set out of the box.  See your <b>GNU/Linux</b> system reference for
       further information on supporting different locales.

</pre><h4><b>MACOS</b> <b>USERS</b></h4><pre>
       If  you  downloaded a drag-and-drop app bundle, this utility is shipped inside it.  If you dragged Regina
       to the main Applications folder, you can run it as /Applications/Regina.app/Contents/MacOS/trisetcmp.

</pre><h4><b>WINDOWS</b> <b>USERS</b></h4><pre>
       The command-line utilities are installed beneath the <u>Program</u>  <u>Files</u>  directory;  on  some  machines  this
       directory    is    called   <u>Program</u>   <u>Files</u>   <u>(x86)</u>.    You   can   start   this   utility   by   running
       c:\Program Files\Regina\Regina 7.0\bin\trisetcmp.exe.
