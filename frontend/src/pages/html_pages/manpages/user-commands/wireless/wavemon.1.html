</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       wavemon - a wireless network monitor

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>wavemon</b> <b>[-h]</b> <b>[-i</b> <u>ifname</u> <b>]</b> <b>[-g]</b> <b>[-v]</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>wavemon</u>  is a ncurses-based monitoring application for wireless network devices. It plots levels in real-
       time as well as showing wireless and network related device information.

       The <u>wavemon</u> interface splits into different "screens".  Each screen presents information  in  a  specific
       manner.  For  example,  the  "info"  screen shows current levels as bargraphs, whereas the "level" screen
       represents the same levels as a moving histogram.

       On startup, you'll see (depending on configuration) one of the different monitor screens. At the  bottom,
       you'll  find a <u>menu-bar</u> listing the screens and their activating keys. Each screen is activated by either
       the corresponding function key or the key corresponding to the first character of the  screen  name.  The
       following screens can be selected:

       <b>Info</b> <b>(F1</b> <b>or</b> <b>'i')</b>
              This  is  the  most  comprehensive  screen.  It displays a condensed overview of wireless-specific
              parameters and network statistics, as well as bar graphs.  The layout  is  arranged  into  several
              sub-sections.

              The  <b>Interface</b>  section  at  the  top  shows information about the monitoring interface, including
              interface name, type, ESSID, and available encryption formats.

              Below, in the <b>Levels</b> section, you can see up to four bargraphs showing (1) relative signal quality
              and (2) signal level in dBm. If  the  wireless  driver  also  supports  noise  level  information,
              additionally  (3) noise level in dBm and (4) Signal-Noise-Ratio (SNR) in dB are shown.  The colour
              of the signal level bargraph changes from red to yellow and green at fixed levels.  If  thresholds
              have  been  set,  two  arrows  on  the  signal  level graph will show the positions of the current
              thresholds.

              The <b>Statistics</b>  section  displays  packet  and  byte  counters  and  a  few  other  packet-related
              statistics.

              The  subsequent  <b>Info</b>  subsection  lists  the  current  operational  mode and configuration of the
              wireless interface. What parameters are actually shown depends on the  capabilities  and  selected
              mode of your network device.

              Lastly,  the  <b>Network</b>  section  shows  network-level  parameters. The MAC-address is resolved from
              <b><a href="../man5/ethers.5.html">ethers</a></b>(5). The IPv4 address is shown in CIDR notation (RFC 4632 <u>address</u><b>/</b><u>prefix_len</u> format).  Since
              often  those two values also determine the broadcast address (last 32 - <u>prefix_len</u> bits set to 1),
              that address is shown only if it does not derive from the interface  address  and  prefix  length.
              Likewise,  the  interface  MTU  is  shown only if it differs from the default Ethernet MTU of 1500
              bytes.

       <b>Level</b> <b>histogram</b> <b>(F2</b> <b>or</b> <b>'l')</b>
              This is a full-screen histogram plot showing the evolution of levels with  time.   The  screen  is
              partitioned  into  a  grid,  with  dBm  levels shown in green at the right hand side (depending on
              configuration).  At the very minimum, the evolution of the signal-level is shown. If the  wireless
              driver  also supports noise-level information, additionally a noise graph and associated SNR graph
              appear.

       <b>Scan</b> <b>window</b> <b>(F3</b> <b>or</b> <b>'s')</b>
              A periodically updated network scan, showing access points  and  other  wireless  clients.  It  is
              sorted  depending  on <u>sort_order</u> and <u>sort_ascending</u>, see <b><a href="../man5/wavemonrc.5.html">wavemonrc</a></b>(5).  Each entry starts with the
              ESSID, followed by the colour-coded MAC address and the signal/channel  information.  A  green/red
              MAC  address indicates an (un-)encrypted access point, the colour changes to yellow for non-access
              points (in this case the mode is shown at  the  end  of  the  line).  The  uncoloured  information
              following  the  MAC  address lists relative and absolute signal strengths, channel, frequency, and
              station-specific information.  The station-specific information includes the station type (ESS for
              Access Point, IBSS for Ad-Hoc network), station count and channel utilisation.

              A status line at the bottom informs about the current sort order and a  few  statistics,  such  as
              most  (least)  crowded  channels  (least  crowded  channels  are listed when sorting by descending
              channel).

              The <u>sort_order</u> can also directly be changed via these keyboard shortcuts:  <u>a</u>scending,  <u>d</u>escending;
              by  <u>e</u>ssid,  <u>s</u>ignal,  <u>c</u>hannel  (<u>C</u>  also  with  signal), <u>m</u>ac address, or by <u>o</u>pen access (<u>O</u> also with
              signal).

       <b>Preferences</b> <b>(F7</b> <b>or</b> <b>'p')</b>
              This screen allows you to change all program options such as interface and level scale parameters,
              and to save the new settings to the configuration file. Select a parameter with &lt;up&gt;  and  &lt;down&gt;,
              then  change  the  value  with  &lt;left&gt;  and  &lt;right&gt;. Please refer to <b><a href="../man5/wavemonrc.5.html">wavemonrc</a></b>(5) for an in-depth
              description of applicable settings.

       <b>Help</b> <b>(F8</b> <b>or</b> <b>'h')</b>
              This page might show an online-help.

       <b>About</b> <b>(F9</b> <b>or</b> <b>'a')</b>
              Release information and contact URLs.

       <b>Quit</b> <b>(F10</b> <b>or</b> <b>'q')</b>
              Exit <u>wavemon</u>.

       <b>Note:</b>  some  operations,  such  as  displaying  encryption  information  or  performing  scans,   require
       <b>CAP_NET_ADMIN</b>  privileges  (see  <b><a href="../man7/capabilities.7.html">capabilities</a></b>(7)). For non-root users, these can be enabled by installing
       <u>wavemon</u> setuid-root.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-i</b> <u>interface</u>
              override autodetection and use the specified <u>interface</u>.

       <b>-g</b>     check screen <u>geometry</u>: a minimum size is required for proper display; this flag adds  a  check  to
              ensure it is sufficiently large. Enable this if window does not display properly.

       <b>-h</b>     print help and exit.

       <b>-v</b>     print version information and exit.

</pre><h4><b>Troubleshooting</b></h4><pre>
       wavemon  will  exit  with  <b>'no</b> <b>supported</b> <b>wireless</b> <b>interfaces</b> <b>found'</b> if no usable wireless interfaces were
       detected. Check if your wireless interfaces is otherwise usable, using  e.g.  <u>iw</u>,  <u>iwconfig</u>,  or  similar
       tools.  The  interface  should appear in <a href="file:/proc/net/dev">/proc/net/dev</a> and, if wireless extensions are supported, also in
       /proc/net/wireless. If the interface does not appear, causes can be a  missing  (or  not  loaded)  kernel
       module, or missing firmware, which some cards need to operate.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       LC_NUMERIC
              Influences the grouping of numbers if set. See also <b><a href="../man1/locale.1.html">locale</a></b>(1).

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       $HOME/.wavemonrc
              The local per-user configuration file.
