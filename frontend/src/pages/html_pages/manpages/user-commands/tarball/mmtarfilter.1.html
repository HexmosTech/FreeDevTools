       mmtarfilter - filter a tarball like dpkg does

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       usage: mmtarfilter [-h] [--path-exclude pattern] [--path-include pattern]

              [--pax-exclude  pattern]  [--pax-include  pattern]  [--type-exclude type] [--transform EXPRESSION]
              [--strip-components NUMBER] [--idshift NUM]

       Filters a tarball on standard input by the same rules  as  the  dpkg  <b>--path-exclude</b>  and  <b>--path-include</b>
       options  and  writes  resulting  tarball to standard output. See <a href="../man1/dpkg.1.html">dpkg</a>(1) for information on how these two
       options work in detail. To reuse the exact same semantics as used by dpkg, paths must be given  as  <u>/path</u>
       and not as ./path even though they might be stored as such in the tarball.

       Secondly,  filter out unwanted pax extended headers using <b>--pax-exclude</b> and <b>--pax-include</b>. This is useful
       in cases where  a  tool  only  accepts  certain  xattr  prefixes.  For  example  tar2sqfs  only  supports
       SCHILY.xattr.user.*,       SCHILY.xattr.trusted.*      and      SCHILY.xattr.security.*      but      not
       SCHILY.xattr.system.posix_acl_default.*.

       Both types of options use Unix shell-style wildcards:

              * matches everything ? matches any single character

              [seq] matches any character in seq

              [!seq] matches any character not in seq

       Thirdly, filter out files matching a specific tar archive member type using  <b>--type-exclude</b>.  Valid  type
       names  are  REGTYPE  (regular  file), LNKTYPE (hardlink), SYMTYPE (symlink), CHRTYPE (character special),
       BLKTYPE (block special), DIRTYPE (directory), FIFOTYPE (fifo)  or  their  tar  format  flag  value  (0-6,
       respectively).

       Fourthly, transform the path of tar members using a sed expression just as with GNU tar <b>--transform</b>.

       Fifthly,  strip leading directory components off of tar members. Just as with GNU tar <b>--strip-components</b>,
       tar members that have less or equal components in their path are not passed through.

       Lastly, shift user id and group id of each entry by the  value  given  by  the  <b>--idshift</b>  argument.  The
       resulting uid or gid must not be negative.

   <b>options:</b>
       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
              show this help message and exit

       <b>--path-exclude</b> pattern
              Exclude path matching the given shell pattern. This option can be specified multiple times.

       <b>--path-include</b> pattern
              Re-include a pattern after a previous exclusion. This option can be specified multiple times.

       <b>--pax-exclude</b> pattern
              Exclude  pax  header  matching  the  given globbing pattern. This option can be specified multiple
              times.

       <b>--pax-include</b> pattern
              Re-include a pax header after a previous exclusion.  This option can be specified multiple times.

       <b>--type-exclude</b> type
              Exclude certain member types by their type. Choose types either by their name  (REGTYPE,  LNKTYPE,
              SYMTYPE,  CHRTYPE,  BLKTYPE,  DIRTYPE,  FIFOTYPE)  or  by  their  tar  format  flag  values  (0-6,
              respectively). This option can be specified multiple times.

       <b>--transform</b>, <b>--xform</b> EXPRESSION
              Use sed replace EXPRESSION to transform file names.  This option can be specified multiple times.

       <b>--strip-components</b> NUMBER
              Strip NUMBER leading components from file names

       <b>--idshift</b> NUM
              Integer value by which to shift the uid and gid of each entry
