</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       osmfilter - The experimental OSM filters data

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>osmfilter</b> <u>options</u> [<u>input</u> <u>file</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       THIS  PROGRAM  IS  FOR  EXPERIMENTAL  USE ONLY.  PLEASE EXPECT MALFUNCTION AND DATA LOSS.  SAVE YOUR DATA
       BEFORE STARTING THIS PROGRAM.

       This program filters OpenStreetMap data.

       The input file name must be  supplied  as  command  line  argument.  The  file  must  not  be  a  stream.
       Redirections  from  standard input will not work because the program needs random access to the file. You
       do not need to specify the input format, osmfilter will recognize these formats: .osm  (XML),  .osc  (OSM
       Change File), .osh (OSM Full History), .o5m (speed-optimized) and .o5c (speed-optimized Change File).

       The  output  format  is  .osm  by  default.  If  you want a different format, please specify it using the
       appropriate command line parameter.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--keep</b>=<u>OBJECT_FILTER</u>

              All object types (nodes, ways and relations) will be kept if they meet the filter  criteria.  Same
              applies to dependent objects, e.g. nodes in ways, ways in relations, relations in other relations.
              Please look below for a syntax description of OBJECT_FILTER.

       --keep-nodes=<u>OBJECT_FILTER</u>
       --keep-ways=<u>OBJECT_FILTER</u>
       --keep-relations=<u>OBJECT_FILTER</u>
       --keep-nodes-ways=<u>OBJECT_FILTER</u>
       --keep-nodes-relations=<u>OBJECT_FILTER</u>
       --keep-ways-relations=<u>OBJECT_FILTER</u>

              Same as above, but just for the specified object types.

       <b>--drop</b>=<u>OBJECT_FILTER</u>

              All  object  types  (nodes,  ways  and  relations) which meet the supplied filter criteria will be
              dropped, regardless of meeting the criteria of a keep filter (see above).  Please look below for a
              syntax description of OBJECT_FILTER.

       --drop-nodes=<u>OBJECT_FILTER</u>
       --drop-ways=<u>OBJECT_FILTER</u>
       --drop-relations=<u>OBJECT_FILTER</u>
       --drop-nodes-ways=<u>OBJECT_FILTER</u>
       --drop-nodes-relations=<u>OBJECT_FILTER</u>
       --drop-ways-relations=<u>OBJECT_FILTER</u>

              Same as above, but just for the specified object types.

       <b>--keep-tags</b>=<u>TAG_FILTER</u>

              The in TAG_FILTER specified tags will be allowed on  output.   Please  look  below  for  a  syntax
              description of TAG_FILTER.

       --keep-node-tags=<u>TAG_FILTER</u>
       --keep-way-tags=<u>TAG_FILTER</u>
       --keep-relation-tags=<u>TAG_FILTER</u>
       --keep-node-way-tags=<u>TAG_FILTER</u>
       --keep-node-relation-tags=<u>TAG_FILTER</u>
       --keep-way-relation-tags=<u>TAG_FILTER</u>

              Same as above, but just for the specified object types.

       <b>--drop-tags</b>=<u>TAG_FILTER</u>

              The specified tags will be dropped. This overrules the previously described parameter <b>--keep-tags</b>.
              Please look below for a syntax description of TAG_FILTER.

       --drop-node-tags=<u>TAG_FILTER</u>
       --drop-way-tags=<u>TAG_FILTER</u>
       --drop-relation-tags=<u>TAG_FILTER</u>
       --drop-node-way-tags=<u>TAG_FILTER</u>
       --drop-node-relation-tags=<u>TAG_FILTER</u>
       --drop-way-relation-tags=<u>TAG_FILTER</u>

              Same as above, but just for the specified object types.

       <b>--modify-tags=TAG_MODIFICATION_LIST</b>

              The  specified  tags  will be modified. This is done after any filtering (see --keep, --keep-tags,
              --drop, --drop-tags).  Please look below for a description of TAG_MODIFICATION_LIST.

       --modify-node-tags=TAG_MODIFICATION_LIST
       --modify-way-tags=TAG_MODIFICATION_LIST
       --modify-relation-tags=TAG_MODIFICATION_LIST
       --modify-node-way-tags=TAG_MODIFICATION_LIST
       --modify-node-relation-tags=TAG_MODIFICATION_LIST
       --modify-way-relation-tags=TAG_MODIFICATION_LIST

              Same as above, but just for the specified object types.

       <b>--drop-author</b>

              For most applications the author tags are not needed.  If  you  specify  this  option,  no  author
              information will be written: no changeset, user or timestamp.

       <b>--drop-version</b>

              If  you  want to exclude not only the author information but also the version number, specify this
              option.

       --drop-nodes
       --drop-ways
       --drop-relations

              According to the combination of these parameters, no members  of  the  referred  section  will  be
              written.

       --emulate-osmosis
       --emulate-pbf2osm

              In  case of .osm output format, the program will try to use the same data syntax as Osmosis, resp.
              pbf2osm.

       <b>--fake-author</b>

              If you have dropped author information (<b>--drop-author</b>) that data will be  lost,  of  course.  Some
              programs however require author information on input although they do not need that data. For this
              purpose, you can fake the author information.  o5mfiler will write changeset 1, timestamp 1970.

       <b>--fake-version</b>

              Same  as  <b>--fake-author</b>, but - if .osm xml is used as output format - only the version number will
              be written (version 1).  This is useful if you want to inspect the data with JOSM.

       <b>--fake-lonlat</b>

              Some programs depend on getting longitude/latitude values, even when the object in question  shall
              be deleted. With this option you can have osmfilter to fake these values:
              ... lat="0" lon="0" ...
              Note that this is for XML files only (.osc and .osh).

       <b>-h</b>

              Display a short parameter overview.

       <b>--help</b>

              Display this help.

       <b>--ignore-dependencies</b>

              Usually,  all member nodes of a way which meets the filter criteria will be included as well. Same
              applies to members of included relations. If you activate  this  option,  all  these  dependencies
              between OSM objects will be ignored.

       <b>--out-key</b>=<u>KEYNAME</u>

              The  output  will  contain  no  regular  OSM  data but only statistics: a list of all used keys is
              assembled. Left to each key, the number of occurrences is  printed.   If  KEYNAME  is  given,  the
              program  will  list  all values which are used in connections with this key.  You may use wildcard
              characters  for  KEYNAME,  but  only  at  the  beginning  and/or  at   the   end.   For   example:
              <b>--out-key</b>=<u>addr</u>:*

       <b>--out-count</b>=<u>KEYNAME</u>

              Same as <b>--out-key=</b>, but the list is sorted by the number of occurrences of the keys resp. values.

       <b>--out-osm</b>

              Data will be written in .osm format. This is the default output format.

       <b>--out-osc</b>

              The  OSM  Change  format  will  be  used  for output. Please note that OSM objects which are to be
              deleted are represented by their ids only.

       <b>--out-osh</b>

              For every OSM object, the appropriate 'visible' tag will be added to meet  'full  planet  history'
              specification.

       <b>--out-o5m</b>

              The  .o5m format will be used. This format has the same structure as the conventional .osm format,
              but the data are stored as binary numbers and are therefore much more compact than in .osm format.
              No packing is used, so you can pack .o5m files using every file packer you want,  e.g.  lzo,  bz2,
              etc.

       <b>--out-o5c</b>

              This  is  the  change  file format of .o5m data format. All &lt;delete&gt; tags will not be performed as
              delete actions but converted into .o5c data format.

       <b>-o=</b>&lt;outfile&gt;

              Standard output will be rerouted to the specified file.  If no output format has  been  specified,
              the program will proceed according to the file name extension.

       <b>-t=</b>&lt;tempfile&gt;

              osmfilter  uses  a  temporary file to process interrelational dependencies. This parameter defines
              the name prefix. The default value is "osmfilter_tempfile".

       <b>--parameter-file</b>=<u>FILE</u>

              If you want to supply one ore more command line arguments by a parameter  file,  please  use  this
              option and specify the file name. Within the parameter file, parameters must be separated by empty
              lines.  Line feeds inside a parameter will be converted to spaces.  Lines starting with "// " will
              be treated as comments.

       <b>-v</b> <b>--verbose</b>

              With activated 'verbose' mode, some statistical data and diagnosis data will be displayed.  If  <b>-v</b>
              resp. <b>--verbose</b> is the first parameter in the line, osmfilter will display all input parameters.

   <b>OBJECT_FILTER</b>
       Some  of  the  command  line  arguments need a filter to be specified. This filter definition consists of
       key/val pairs and uses the following syntax:
       "KEY1=VAL1 OP KEY2=VAL2 OP KEY3=VAL3 ..."

              OP is the Boolean operator, it must be either "and" or "or".  As usual, "and"  will  be  processed
              prior to "or". If you want to influence the sequence of processing, you may use brackets to do so.
              Please  note  that  brackets  always  must  be  padded by spaces. Example: lit=yes and ( note=a or
              source=b ) Instead of each "=" you may enter one of these comparison operators: != (not equal), &lt;,
              &gt;, &lt;=, &gt;= The program will use ASCII-alphabetic comparison unless  you  compare  against  a  value
              which is starting with a digit.  If there are different possible values for the same key, you need
              to write the key only once. For example:
              "amenity=restaurant =pub =bar"

              It is allowed to omit the value. In this case, the program will accept every value for the defined
              key. For example:
              "highway= and lit=yes"

              You may use wildcard characters for key or value, but only at the beginning and/or at the end. For
              example:
              "wikipedia:*=highway=*ary  ref_name=*central*"

              Please  be careful with wildcards in keys since only the first key which meets the pattern will be
              processed.  There are three special keys which represent object id, user id and  user  name:  @id,
              @uid and @user. They allow you to search for certain objects or for edits of specific users.

   <b>TAG_FILTER</b>
       The tag filter determines which tags will be kept and which will be not. For example :
       <b>--keep-tags=</b>"highway=motorway =primary"
       will  not  accept  "highway" tags other than "motorway" or "primary". Note that neither the object itself
       will be deleted, nor the remaining tags. If you want to drop every tag which is not mentioned in a  list,
       use this example:
       all highway= amenity= name=

   <b>TAG_MODIFICATION_LIST</b>
       The tag modification list determines which tags will be modified. The example
       <b>--modify-tags="highway=primary</b> <b>to</b> <b>=secondary"</b>
       will  change  every  "primary"  highway into "secondary".  You can also use comparisons or add additional
       tags:
       <b>--modify-way-tags="maxspeed&gt;200</b> <b>add</b> <b>highspeed=yes"</b>

</pre><h4><b>TUNING</b></h4><pre>
       To speed-up the process, the program uses some main memory for a hash table. By default, it uses 1200  MB
       for  storing  a  flag  for every possible node, 150 for the way flags, and 10 relation flags.  Every byte
       holds the flags for 8 ID numbers, i.e., in 1200 MB the program can store 9600 million flags. As there are
       less than 5700 million IDs for nodes at present (May 2018), 720 MB would suffice.  So, for  example,  you
       can  decrease the hash sizes to e.g. 720, 80 and 2 MB (for relations, 2 flags are needed each) using this
       option:
       <b>--hash-memory</b>=<u>720-80-2</u>

       But keep in mind that the OSM database is continuously expanding. For this reason the program-own default
       value is higher than shown in the example, and it may be appropriate to increase it in  the  future.   If
       you  do not want to bother with the details, you can enter the amount of memory as a sum, and the program
       will divide it by itself.  For example:
       <b>--hash-memory</b>=<u>1000</u>

       These 1000 MiB will be split in three parts: 800 for nodes, 150 for ways, and 50 for relations.

       Because we are taking hashes, it is not necessary to provide all the suggested memory; the  program  will
       operate  with  less  hash memory too.  But, in this case, the border filter will be less effective, i.e.,
       some ways and some relations will be left in the output file although they  should  have  been  excluded.
       The  maximum value the program accepts for the hash size is 4000 MiB; If you exceed the maximum amount of
       memory available on your system, the program will try  to  reduce  this  amount  and  display  a  warning
       message.

</pre><h4><b>LIMITATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       When  filtering  whole  OSM  objects  (<b>--keep</b>...=,  <b>--drop</b>...=),  the input file must contain the objects
       ordered by their type: first, all nodes nodes, next, all ways, followed by all relations.

       Usual .osm, .osc, .o5m and o5c files adhere to this condition. This means that you do not have  to  worry
       about this limitation. osmfilter will display an error message if this sequence is broken.

       The number of key/val pairs in each filter parameter is limited to 1000, the length of each key or val is
       limited to 100.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
