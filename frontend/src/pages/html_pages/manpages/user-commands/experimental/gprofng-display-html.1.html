</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       gprofng-display-html - Generate an HTML based directory structure to browse the profiles

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>gprofng</b> <b>display</b> <b>html</b> [<u>option(s)</u>] <u>experiment(s)</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Process one or more experiments to generate a directory containing the <u>index.html</u> file that may be used
       to browse the experiment data.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--version</b>
           Print the version number and exit.

       <b>--help</b>
           Print usage information and exit.

       <b>--verbose</b>
           Enable verbose mode to show diagnostic messages about the processing of the data.  By default verbose
           mode is disabled.

       <b>-d</b> <b>[</b><u>db-vol-size</u><b>],</b> <b>--debug[=</b><u>db-vol-size</u><b>]</b>
           Control the printing of run time debug information to assist with the troubleshooting, or further
           development of this tool.

           The <u>db-vol-size</u> parameter controls the output volume and is one from the list <b>s</b>, <b>S</b>, <b>m</b>, <b>M</b>, <b>l</b>, <b>L</b>, <b>xl</b>,
           or <b>XL</b>.  If <u>db-vol-size</u> is not set, a modest amount of information is printed.  This is equivalent to
           select <b>s</b>, or <b>S</b>.  The volume of data goes up as the size increases.  Note that currently <b>l/L</b> is
           equivalent to <b>xl/XL</b>, but this is expected to change in future updates.  By default debug mode is
           disabled.

       <b>--highlight-percentage=</b><u>value</u>
           Set a percentage value in the interval [0,100] to select and color code source lines, as well as
           instructions, that are within this percentage of the maximum metric value(s).  The default is 90 (%).
           A value of zero disables this feature.

       <b>-o</b> <u>dirname</u><b>,</b> <b>--output=</b><u>dirname</u>
           Use <u>dirname</u> as the directory name to store the results in.  In absence of this option, the default
           name is <b>display.&lt;n&gt;.html</b>.  This directory is created in the current directory.  The number <u>&lt;n&gt;</u> is the
           first positive integer number not in use in this naming scheme.  An existing directory with the same
           name is not overwritten.  In case the directory exists already, an error message is printed and the
           tool terminates.

       <b>-O</b> <u>dirname</u><b>,</b> <b>--overwrite=</b><u>dirname</u>
           Use <u>dirname</u> as the directory name to store the results in.  In absence of this option, the default
           name is <b>display.&lt;n&gt;.html</b>.  This directory is created in the current directory.  The number <u>&lt;n&gt;</u> is the
           first positive integer number not in use in this naming scheme.  An existing directory with the same
           name is silently overwritten.

       <b>-q,</b>  <b>--quiet</b>
           Disable the display of all warning, debug, verbose and any other messages.  If enabled, the settings
           for verbose and debug are accepted, but ignored.  With this option, there is no screen output, other
           than errors.  By default quiet mode is disabled.

       <b>--nowarnings</b>
           Disable the printing of warning messages on stdout.  By default warning messages are printed.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       -   The options and values are case sensitive.

       -   In this release, the option syntax has changed to be more compliant with other tools and commands.

           The options that used to have an <b>on</b> or <b>off</b> value only, now act as a switch.  The option negates the
           default setting.  For example, by default, verbose mode is disabled.  It is enabled by using the
           <b>--verbose</b> option.

           The long options, those starting with "--", that require a value, expect the "=" sign between the
           option and the value.

           While the previous syntax and choices are accepted still, we strongly recommend to change the usage
           of the options according to the new syntax and values.  At some point, these legacy settings may no
           longer be accepted.

           To assist with the transition, a warning message is shown if the legacy syntax, or value, or both,
           are used.

       -   The <b>-hp</b> option is still accepted, but it will be deprecated in a future release.  Use the
           <b>--highlight-percentage</b> option instead.

       -   When setting a directory name for the HTML files to be stored in, make sure that umask is set to the
           correct access permissions.

       -   Regardless of the setting for the warning messages, if there are warnings, they are accessible
           through the main <u>index.html</u> page.

       -   The tool tries to accumulate as many warnings and errors as possible, before taking action.  In this
           way, it is easier to address multiple issues at once.  As a result of this approach, it may be that
           the messages do not show immediately.  In particular, warnings are shown towards the end of the
           execution, but one or more errors will terminate execution before the processing begins.

       The user guide for gprofng is maintained as a Texinfo manual.  If the <b>info</b> and <b>gprofng</b> programs are
       correctly installed, the command <b>info</b> <b>gprofng</b> should give access to this document.
