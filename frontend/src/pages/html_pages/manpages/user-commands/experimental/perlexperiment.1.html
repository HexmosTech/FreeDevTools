       perlexperiment - A listing of experimental features in Perl

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This document lists the current and past experimental features in the perl core. Although all of these
       are documented with their appropriate topics, this succinct listing gives you an overview and basic facts
       about their status.

       So far we've merely tried to find and list the experimental features and infer their inception, versions,
       etc. There's a lot of speculation here.

   <b>Current</b> <b>experiments</b>
       Smart match ("~~")
               Introduced in Perl 5.10.0

               Modified in Perl 5.10.1, 5.12.0

               Will be removed in 5.42.0

               Using this feature triggers warnings in the category "deprecated".

       Aliasing via reference
               Introduced in Perl 5.22.0

               Using this feature triggers warnings in the category "experimental::refaliasing".

               The ticket for this experiment is [perl #14150] &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/14150&gt;.

       use re 'strict';
               Introduced in Perl 5.22.0

               Using this feature triggers warnings in the category "experimental::re_strict".

       Declaring a reference to a variable
               Introduced in Perl 5.26.0

               Using this feature triggers warnings in the category "experimental::declared_refs".

               The ticket for this experiment is [perl #15458] &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/15458&gt;.

               See also: "Declaring a Reference to a Variable" in perlref

       There is an "installhtml" target in the Makefile.
               The ticket for this experiment is [perl #12726] &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/12726&gt;.

       (Limited) Variable-length look-behind
               Introduced in Perl 5.30.0.

               Variability of up to 255 characters is handled.

               Using this feature triggers warnings in the category "experimental::vlb".

               The ticket for this experiment is [perl #18756] &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/18756&gt;.

               See  also:  "(*positive_lookbehind:<u>pattern</u>)"  in  perlre  and "(*negative_lookbehind:<u>pattern</u>)" in
               perlre

       Unicode private use character hooks
               Introduced in Perl 5.30.0.

               This feature is part of an interface intended for internal and  experimental  use  by  the  perl5
               developers.  You are unlikely to encounter it in the wild.

               Using this feature triggers warnings in the category "experimental::private_use".

               The ticket for this experiment is [perl #18758] &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/18758&gt;.

       Unicode property wildcards
               Introduced in Perl 5.30.0.

               This  feature  allows  regular  expression  matching  against  Unicode character properties to be
               expressed more concisely.

               Using this feature triggers warnings in the category "experimental::uniprop_wildcards".

               The ticket for this experiment is [perl #18759] &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/18759&gt;.

       try/catch control structure
               Introduced in Perl 5.34.0.

               Using the optional "finally" block part  of  this  feature  triggers  warnings  in  the  category
               "experimental::try".

               The ticket for this experiment is [perl #18760] &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/18760&gt;

       Use of @_ within subroutine signatures
               Introduced  in  Perl  5.36.0  as  part  of  a  reduction  in the scope of experimental subroutine
               signatures.

               Using the default arguments array (@_) within a subroutine  that  uses  signatures  will  emit  a
               warning  in  the  category "experimental::args_array_with_signatures". This includes @_ directly,
               elements of it such as $_[$index], or situations where the default arguments  array  is  accessed
               implicitly such as "shift" or "pop" without arguments.

       The builtin namespace
               Introduced in Perl 5.36.0.

               Using    certain    functions    of    this   feature   triggers   warnings   in   the   category
               "experimental::builtin".

               In Perl 5.36.0, a new namespace, "builtin", was created for new core functions that will  not  be
               present  in  every  namespace,  but  will  be  available for importing.  The namespace itself was
               considered  experimental  until  Perl  5.39.2.   Some  specific  functions   within   it   remain
               experimental.

               The ticket for this experiment is [perl #19764] &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/19764&gt;.

       The defer block modifier
               Introduced in Perl 5.36.0

               Using this feature triggers warnings in the category "experimental::defer".

               This  feature  adds  a  new  kind of block, a "defer" block, which will not be executed until the
               containing block is being exited.

               The ticket for this experiment is [perl #17949] &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/17949&gt;.

       Extra paired delimiters for quote-like operators
               Introduced in Perl 5.36.0

               Using this feature triggers warnings in the category "experimental::extra_paired_delimiters".

               This feature allows for many non-ASCII pairs of mirroring delimiters, for example:

                   my @array = qw« tinker tailor soldier spy »;

               The ticket for this experiment is [perl #19765] &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/19765&gt;.

   <b>Accepted</b> <b>features</b>
       These features were so wildly successful and played so well with others that we decided to  remove  their
       experimental  status  and  admit  them  as  full, stable features in the world of Perl, lavishing all the
       benefits and luxuries thereof.  They are also awarded +5 Stability and +3 Charisma.

   <b>Removed</b> <b>features</b>
       These features are no longer considered experimental and their functionality has disappeared.  It's  your
       own  fault if you wrote production programs using these features after we explicitly told you not to (see
