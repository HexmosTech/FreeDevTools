       borg-compact - Collect garbage in repository

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       borg [common options] compact [options]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Free repository space by deleting unused chunks.

       borg  compact  analyzes  all  existing  archives  to  find out which repository objects are actually used
       (referenced). It then deletes all unused objects from the repository to free space.

       Unused objects may result from:

       • borg delete or prune usage

       • interrupted backups (maybe retry the backup first before running compact)

       • backup of source files that had an I/O error in the middle of their contents and that were skipped  due
         to this

       • corruption of the repository (e.g. the archives directory having lost entries, see notes below)

       You usually don't want to run <b>borg</b> <b>compact</b> after every write operation, but either regularly (e.g. once a
       month, possibly together with <b>borg</b> <b>check</b>) or when disk space needs to be freed.

       <b>Important:</b>

       After  compacting  it  is  no  longer  possible  to  use <b>borg</b> <b>undelete</b> to recover previously soft-deleted
       archives.

       <b>borg</b> <b>compact</b> might also delete data from archives that were "lost" due to archives directory  corruption.
       Such  archives  could  potentially  be restored with <b>borg</b> <b>check</b> <b>--find-lost-archives</b> <b>[--repair]</b>, which is
       slow. You therefore might not want to do that unless there are signs of lost archives (e.g.  when  seeing
       fatal errors when creating backups or when archives are missing in <b>borg</b> <b>repo-list</b>).
