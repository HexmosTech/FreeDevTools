</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       crsh - Cluster administration tool

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       This documentation is for version: 4.18

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       crsh [-a '&lt;command&gt;'] [-K &lt;seconds&gt;] [-q] [-c '&lt;filename&gt;'] [-x &lt;cols&gt;] [-C '&lt;filename&gt;'] [--debug [[...]
       || &lt;INTEGER&gt;]] [-d] [-e '&lt;[user@]&lt;host&gt;[:port]&gt;'] [--fillscreen] [-f '&lt;font&gt;'] [-h] [-L '[tag]'] [-H] [-o
       '&lt;STRING&gt;'] [-p &lt;port&gt;] [-Q] [-y &lt;rows&gt;] [-s] [-r '&lt;filename&gt;'] [-t '&lt;STRING&gt;'] [-g] [-T '&lt;title&gt;'] [-u]
       [-?] [-A] [-l '&lt;username&gt;'] [-v]

</pre><h4><b>RELATED</b></h4><pre>
       Also see the individual man pages for each of these utilities

       ccon - Use 'console' as the communication method
       csftp - Use 'sftp' as the communication method
       cssh - Use 'ssh' as the communication method
       ctel - Use 'telnet' as the communication method

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The command opens an administration console and an xterm to all specified hosts.  Any text typed into the
       administration console is replicated to all windows.  All windows may also be typed into directly.

       This  tool  is  intended  for (but not limited to) cluster administration where the same configuration or
       commands must be run on each node within the cluster.  Performing these commands all  at  once  via  this
       tool ensures all nodes are kept in sync.

       Connections are opened using rsh which must be correctly installed and configured.

       Extra  caution  should  be  taken  when  editing files as lines may not necessarily be in the same order;
       assuming line 5 is the same across all servers and modifying that is dangerous.  It's  better  to  search
       for  the  specific  line  to be changed and double-check all terminals are as expected before changes are
       committed.

   <b>Further</b> <b>Notes</b>
       Please also see "KNOWN BUGS".

       •   The dotted line on any sub-menu is a tear-off, i.e. click on it and the sub-menu is turned  into  its
           own window.

       •   Unchecking  a hostname on the Hosts sub-menu will unplug the host from the cluster control window, so
           any text typed into the console is not sent to that host.  Re-selecting it will plug it back in.

       •   If your window manager menu bars are obscured by  terminal  windows  see  the  "screen_reserve_XXXXX"
           options in the <u>$HOME/.clusterssh/config</u> file (see "FILES").

       •   If   the   terminals   overlap   too   much   see   the   "terminal_reserve_XXXXX"   options  in  the
           <u>$HOME/.clusterssh/config</u> file (see "FILES").

       •   When using ClusterSSH on a large number of systems to connect to a single system using an SSH utility
           (e.g. you issue a command to to copy a file using scp from the remote computers to a single host) and
           when these connections require authentication (i.e. you are going to authenticate with  a  password),
           the  sshd  daemon  at  that  location  may refuse connections after the number "MaxStartups" limit in
           <u>sshd_config</u> is exceeded.  (If this value is not set, it defaults to 10).  This is expected  behavior;
           sshd  uses  this  mechanism  to  prevent  DoS  attacks  from  unauthenticated  sources.   Please tune
           sshd_config and reload the SSH daemon, or consider using  the  <u><a href="file:~/.ssh/authorized_keys">~/.ssh/authorized_keys</a></u>  mechanism  for
           authentication if you encounter this problem.

       •   If client windows fail to open, try running:

           "crsh -e {single host name}"

           This  will test the mechanisms used to open windows to hosts.  This could be due to either the "-xrm"
           terminal option which enables "AllowSendEvents" (some terminals do not  require  this  option,  other
           terminals have another method for enabling it - see your terminal documentation) or the configuration
           of "rsh".

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Some  of  these  options may also be defined within the configuration file.  Default options are shown as
       appropriate.

       --use-all-a-records, -A
           If  a hostname resolves to multiple IP addresses, toggle whether or not to connect to all of them, or
           just the first one (see also config file entry).

       --username '&lt;username&gt;', -l '&lt;username&gt;'
           Specify the default username to use for connections (if different from the currently logged in user).

</pre><h4><b>ARGUMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       The following arguments are supported:

       [user@]&lt;hostname&gt;[:port] ...
           Open an xterm to the given hostname and connect to the administration  console.   The  optional  port
           number can be used if the server is not listening on the standard port.

       &lt;tag&gt; ...
           Open  a  series  of  xterms  defined  by  &lt;tag&gt;  in one of the supplementary configuration files (see
           "FILES").

           <b>Note:</b> specifying a username on a cluster tag will override any usernames defined in the cluster.

</pre><h4><b>KEY</b> <b>SHORTCUTS</b></h4><pre>
       The following key shortcuts are available within the console window, and all of them may be  changed  via
       the configuration files.

       Control-Shift-plus
           Open  the  'Add  Host(s) or Cluster(s)' dialogue box.  Multiple host or cluster names can be entered,
           separated by spaces.

       Alt-n
           Paste in the hostname part of the specific connection string to each client, minus  any  username  or
           port, e.g.

           "scp <a href="file:/etc/hosts">/etc/hosts</a> server:files/&lt;Alt-n&gt;.hosts"

           would replace the &lt;Alt-n&gt; with the client's name in each window.

       Alt-l
           Paste in the hostname of the server cssh is being run on

       Alt-q
           Quit the program and close all connections and windows.

       Alt-r
           Retile all the client windows.

       Alt-u
           Paste in the username for the connection

       Alt-1
       Alt-2
       Alt-3
       Alt-4
           Run the matching user defined macro on the server and send the output to the client

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Open up a session to 3 servers
           $ crsh server1 server2 server3

       Open up a session to a cluster of servers identified by the tag 'farm1' and give the controlling window a
       specific title, where the tag is defined in one of the default configuration files
           $ crsh -T 'Web Farm Cluster 1' farm1

       Connect to different servers using different login names.  NOTE: this can also be achieved by setting up
       appropriate options in the configuration files.  Do not close the console when the last terminal exits.
           $ crsh user1@server1 admin@server2

       Open up a cluster defined in a non-default configuration file
           $ crsh -c $HOME/cssh.extra_clusters db_cluster

       Override the configured/default port to use 2022 instead
           $ crsh -p 2022 server1 server2

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <u>/etc/clusters</u>, <u>$HOME/.clusterssh/clusters</u>
           These  files  contain  a list of tags to server names mappings.  When any name is used on the command
           line it is checked to see if it is a tag.  If it is a tag, then the tag is replaced with the list  of
           servers.  The format is as follows:

           &lt;tag&gt; [user@]&lt;server&gt;[:port] [user@]&lt;server&gt;[:port] [...]

           e.g.

               # List of servers in live
               live admin1@server1 admin2@server2:2022 server3 server4

           All  comments (marked by a #) and blank lines are ignored.  Tags may be nested, but be aware of using
           recursive tags as they are not checked for.

           Servers can be defined using expansion macros:

           "webservers websvr{a,b,c}"

           would be expanded to

           "webservers websvra websvrb websvrc"

           and

           "webservers websvr{6..9}"

           would be expanded to

           "webservers websvr6 websvr7 websvr8 websvr9"

           Extra  cluster  files  may  also  be  specified  either  as  an  option  on  the  command  line  (see
           "cluster-file")   or   in   the   user's   <u>$HOME/.clusterssh/config</u>  file  (see  "extra_cluster_file"
           configuration option).

           <b>NOTE:</b> the last tag read overwrites any pre-existing tag of that name.

           <b>NOTE:</b> there is a special cluster tag called "default" - any tags or hosts included  within  this  tag
           will be automatically opened if nothing is specified on the command line.

       <u>/etc/tags</u>, <u>$HOME/.clusterssh/tags</u>
           Very similar to <u>clusters</u> files but the definition is reversed.  The format is:

           &lt;host&gt; &lt;tag&gt; [...]

           This  allows  one  host  to be specified as a member of a number of tags.  This format can be clearer
           than using <u>clusters</u> files.

           Extra tag files may be  specified  either  as  an  option  (see  "tag-file")  or  within  the  user's
           <u>$HOME/.clusterssh/config</u> file (see "extra_tag_file" configuration option).

           <b>NOTE:</b> All tags are added together

       <u>/etc/csshrc</u> &amp; <u>$HOME/.clusterssh/config</u>
           This  file  contains  configuration  overrides  -  the  defaults  are as marked.  Default options are
           overwritten first by the global file, and then by the user file.

           <b>NOTE:</b> values for entries do not need to be quoted unless it is required for passing arguments, e.g.

           "terminal_allow_send_events="-xrm '*.VT100.allowSendEvents:true'""

           should be written as

           "terminal_allow_send_events=-xrm '*.VT100.allowSendEvents:true'"

           auto_close = 5
               Close terminal window after this many seconds.  If set to 0 will instead wait on input  from  the
               user in each window before closing. See also --autoclose and --no-autoclose

           auto_quit = 1
               Automatically  quit  after  the  last  client  window  closes.   Set  to  0 to disable.  See also
               --autoquit

           auto_wm_decoration_offsets = no
               Enable or disable alternative algorithm for calculating terminal positioning.

           command_pre =
           command_post =
               Add extra commands around the communication method.  For example:

               command_pre= . $HOME/virtualenvs/default/bin/active ; command_post= | ct

               would allow for using Python virtual  envronments  and  then  piping  all  shell  output  through
               "chromaterm"    for    syntax   highlighting.    Note:   you   must   use   appropriate   command
               separators/terminators to keep the meaning of the command pipline (such as ";"  and  "|"  between
               commands).

               These are not put through macro parsing.

           comms = rsh
               Sets  the  default communication method (initially taken from the name of the program, but can be
               overridden here).

           console_position = &lt;null&gt;
               Set the initial position of the console - if empty then let the window manager decide.  Format is
               '+&lt;x&gt;+&lt;y&gt;', i.e. '+0+0' is top left hand corner of the screen, '+0-70' is bottom left  hand  side
               of screen (more or less).

           external_command_mode = 0600
               File mode bits for the external_command_pipe.

           external_command_pipe = &lt;null&gt;
               Define  the  full  path  to  an external command pipe that can be written to for controlling some
               aspects of ClusterSSH, such as opening sessions to more clusters.

               Commands:

               "open &lt;tag|hostname&gt;" - open new sessions to provided tag or hostname

               "retile" - force window retiling

               e.g.: "echo 'open localhost'" /path/to/external_command_pipe &gt;&gt;

           external_cluster_command = &lt;null&gt;
               Define the full path to an external command that can be used to resolve tags to host names.  This
               command can be written in any language.  The script must accept a list of  tags  to  resolve  and
               output  a  list  of  hosts  (space separated on a single line).  Any tags that cannot be resolved
               should be returned unchanged.

               A non-0 exit code will be counted as an error, a warning will be printed and output ignored.

               If the external command is given a "-L" option it should output a list of tags  (space  separated
               on a single line) it can resolve

           extra_cluster_file = &lt;null&gt;
               Define  an  extra  cluster file in the format of <u>/etc/clusters</u>.  Multiple files can be specified,
               separated by commas.  Both ~ and  $HOME  are  acceptable  as  a  reference  to  the  user's  home
               directory, e.g.

               "extra_cluster_file = <a href="file:~/clusters">~/clusters</a>, $HOME/clus"

           extra_tag_file = &lt;null&gt;
               Define  an extra tag file in the format of <u>/etc/tags</u>.  Multiple files can be specified, separated
               by commas.  Both ~ and $HOME are acceptable as a reference to the user's home directory, e.g.

               "extra_tag_file = <a href="file:~/tags">~/tags</a>, $HOME/tags"

           key_addhost = Control-Shift-plus
               Default key sequence to open AddHost menu.  See "KEY SHORTCUTS" for more information.

           hide_menu = 0

           key_clientname = Alt-n
               Default key sequence to send  cssh  client  names  to  client.   See  "KEY  SHORTCUTS"  for  more
               information.

           key_localname = Alt-l
               Default  key  sequence  to send hostname of local server to client.  See "KEY SHORTCUTS" for more
               information.

           key_paste = Control-v
               Default key sequence to paste text into  the  console  window.   See  "KEY  SHORTCUTS"  for  more
               information.

           key_quit = Control-q
               Default  key sequence to quit the program (will terminate all open windows).  See "KEY SHORTCUTS"
               for more information.

           key_retilehosts = Alt-r
               Default key sequence to retile host windows.  See "KEY SHORTCUTS" for more information.

           key_username = Alt-u
               Default key sequence to send username to client.  See "KEY SHORTCUTS" for more information.

           key_user_3 = Alt-3
           key_user_4 = Alt-4
               Default key sequence to send user defined macros to client.  If the matching  macro_user_1  macro
               is  undefined,  the  sequence  is  passed straight to the terminal.  See "KEY SHORTCUTS" for more
               information.

               the client.  For example,

               "macro_user_1_command=echo echo macro_user_1"

                           would send the text C&lt;echo macro_user_1&gt; into the terminal session.

               "macro_user_1_command=env | grep CSSH"

                           would send the CSSH environment variables to the client.

               The following environment variables are set in the shell of the macro process

               "CSSH_SERVERNAME"
               "CSSH_HOSTNAME"
               "CSSH_USERNAME"
               "CSSH_CONNECTION_STRING"
               "CSSH_CONNECTION_PORT"
               "CSSH_VERSION"
           macros_enabled = yes
               Enable or disable macro replacement.  Note: this affects all the "macro_*" variables above.

           max_addhost_menu_cluster_items = 6
               Maximum number of entries in the 'Add Host' menu cluster list before scrollbars are used

           max_host_menu_items = 30
               Maximum number of hosts to put into the host menu before starting a new column

           menu_host_autotearoff = 0
           menu_send_autotearoff = 0
               When set to non-0 will automatically tear-off the host or send menu at program start

           mouse_paste = Button-2 (middle mouse button)
               Default  key sequence to paste text into the console window using the mouse.  See "KEY SHORTCUTS"
               for more information.

           rsh = /path/to/rsh
           ssh = /path/to/ssh
           telnet = /path/to/telnet
               Set the path to the specific binary to use for the communication  method,  else  uses  the  first
               match found in $PATH

           rsh_args = &lt;blank&gt;
           ssh_args = "-x -o ConnectTimeout=10"
           telnet_args = &lt;blank&gt;
               Sets any arguments to be used with the communication method (defaults to ssh arguments).

               <b>NOTE:</b> The given defaults are based on OpenSSH, not commercial ssh software.

               <b>NOTE:</b> Any "generic" change to the method (e.g., specifying the ssh port to use) should be done in
               the medium's own config file (see "ssh_config" and <u>$HOME/.ssh/config</u>).

           screen_reserve_top = 0
           screen_reserve_bottom = 60
           screen_reserve_left = 0
           screen_reserve_right = 0
               Number  of  pixels from the screen's side to reserve when calculating screen geometry for tiling.
               Setting this to something like 50 will help keep cssh from positioning windows over  your  window
               manager's menu bar if it draws one at that side of the screen.

           terminal = /path/to/xterm
               Path to the X-Windows terminal used for the client.

           terminal_args = &lt;blank&gt;
               Arguments  to  use when opening terminal windows.  Otherwise takes defaults from <u>$HOME/.Xdefaults</u>
               or <u>$HOME/.Xresources</u> file.

           terminal_chdir = 0
               When non-0, set the working directory for each terminal as per 'terminal_chdir_path'

           terminal_chdir_path = $HOME/.clusterssh/work/%s
               Path to use as working directory for each terminal when 'terminal_chdir' is  enabled.   The  path
               provided is passed through the macro parser (see the section above on 'macros_enabled'.

           terminal_font = 6x13
               Font to use in the terminal windows.  Use standard X font notation.

           terminal_reserve_top = 5
           terminal_reserve_bottom = 0
           terminal_reserve_left = 5
           terminal_reserve_right = 0
               Number of pixels from the terminal's side to reserve when calculating screen geometry for tiling.
               Setting  these  will  help  keep cssh from positioning windows over your scroll and title bars or
               otherwise overlapping the windows too much.

           terminal_colorize = 1
               If set to 1 (the default), then  "-bg"  and  "-fg"  arguments  will  be  added  to  the  terminal
               invocation  command-line.   The terminal will be colored in a pseudo-random way based on the host
               name; while the color of a terminal is not easily predicted, it will always be the same color for
               a given host name.  After a while, you will recognize  hosts  by  their  characteristic  terminal
               color.

           terminal_bg_style = dark
               If  set to "dark", the terminal background will be set to black and the foreground to the pseudo-
               random color.  If set to "light", then the foreground  will  be  black  and  the  background  the
               pseudo-random color.  If terminal_colorize is "zero", then this option has no effect.

           terminal_size = 80x24
               Initial  size of terminals to use. NOTE: the number of lines (24) will be decreased when resizing
               terminals for tiling, not the number of characters (80).

           terminal_title_opt = -T
               Option used with "terminal" to set the title of the window

           terminal_allow_send_events = -xrm '*.VT100.allowSendEvents:true'
               Option required by the terminal to allow XSendEvents to be received

           title = cssh
               Title of windows to use for both the console and terminals.

           unmap_on_redraw = no
               Tell Tk to use the UnmapWindow request before redrawing terminal windows.  This defaults to  "no"
               as  it  causes some problems with the FVWM window manager.  If you are experiencing problems with
               redraws, you can set it to "yes" to allow the window to be unmapped before it is repositioned.

           use_all_a_records = 0
               If a hostname resolves to multiple IP addresses, set to 1 to connect to all of them, not just the
               first one found.  See also "--use-all-a-records"}

           use_hotkeys = 1
               Setting to 0 will disable all hotkeys.

           use_natural_sort = 0
               Windows will normally sort in alphabetical order, i.e.: host1, host11, host2.  Setting to this  1
               will  change  the  sort  order,  i.e.:  host1, host2, host11. NOTE: You must have the perl module
               Sort::Naturally installed.

           user = $LOGNAME
               Sets the default user for running commands on clients.

           window_tiling = 1
               Perform window tiling (set to 0 to disable)

           window_tiling_direction = right
               Direction to tile windows, where "right" means starting top left and moving right and then  down,
               and anything else means starting bottom right and moving left and then up

           <b>NOTE:</b> The key shortcut modifiers must be in the form "Control", "Alt" or "Shift", e.g. with the first
           letter capitalised and the rest lower case.  Keys may also be disabled individually by setting to the
           word "null".

       <u>$HOME/.clusterssh/send_menu</u>
           This  (optional)  file  contains items to populate the send menu.  The default entry could be written
           as:

             &lt;send_menu&gt;
               &lt;menu title="Use Macros"&gt;
                   &lt;toggle/&gt;
                   &lt;accelerator&gt;ALT-p&lt;/accelerator&gt;
               &lt;/menu&gt;
               &lt;menu title="Remote Hostname"&gt;
                   &lt;command&gt;%s&lt;/command&gt;
                   &lt;accelerator&gt;ALT-n&lt;/accelerator&gt;
               &lt;/menu&gt;
               &lt;menu title="Local Hostname"&gt;
                   &lt;command&gt;%s&lt;/command&gt;
                   &lt;accelerator&gt;ALT-l&lt;/accelerator&gt;
               &lt;/menu&gt;
               &lt;menu title="Username"&gt;
                   &lt;command&gt;%u&lt;/command&gt;
                   &lt;accelerator&gt;ALT-u&lt;/accelerator&gt;
               &lt;/menu&gt;
               &lt;menu title="Test Text"&gt;
                   &lt;command&gt;echo "ClusterSSH Version: %v%n&lt;/command&gt;
               &lt;/menu&gt;
             &lt;/send_menu&gt;

           Submenus can also be specified as follows:

             &lt;send_menu&gt;
               &lt;menu title="Default Entries"&gt;
                 &lt;detach&gt;yes&lt;/detach&gt;
                 &lt;menu title="Hostname"&gt;
                     &lt;command&gt;%s&lt;/command&gt;
                     &lt;accelerator&gt;ALT-n&lt;/accelerator&gt;
                 &lt;/menu&gt;
               &lt;/menu&gt;
             &lt;/send_menu&gt;

           <b>Caveats:</b>

           There is currently no strict format checking of this file.
           The format of the file may change in the future
           If the file exists, the default entry (Hostname) is not added

           The following replacement macros are available (note: these  can  be  changed  in  the  configuration
           file):

           %s  Hostname part of the specific connection string to each client, minus any username or port

           %u  Username part of the connection string to each client

           %h  Hostname of server where cssh is being run from

           %n  "RETURN" code

           <b>NOTE:</b> requires XML::Simple to be installed

</pre><h4><b>KNOWN</b> <b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       If you have any ideas about how to fix the below bugs, please get in touch and/or provide a patch.

       •   Swapping  virtual  desktops can cause a redraw of all the terminal windows.  This is due to a lack of
           distinction within Tk between switching desktops and minimising/maximising  windows.   Until  Tk  can
           tell the difference between the two events, there is no fix (apart from rewriting everything directly
           in X).

</pre><h4><b>TROUBLESHOOTING</b></h4><pre>
       If you have issues running crsh, first try:

       "crsh -e [user@]&lt;hostname&gt;[:port]"

       This  performs  two  tests to confirm cssh is able to work properly with the settings provided within the
       <u>$HOME/.clusterssh/config</u> file (or internal defaults).

       1.  Test the terminal window works with the options provided

       2.  Test rsh works to a host with the configured arguments

       Configuration options to watch for in ssh are:

       •   SSH doesn't understand "-o ConnectTimeout=10" - remove the option from  the  <u>$HOME/.clusterssh/config</u>
           file

       •   OpenSSH-3.8  using untrusted ssh tunnels - use "-Y" instead of "-X" or use "ForwardX11Trusted yes" in
           <u>$HOME/.ssh/ssh_config</u> (if you change the default ssh options from "-x" to "-X")

</pre><h4><b>SUPPORT</b> <b>AND</b> <b>REPORTING</b> <b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       A  web  site  for  comments,  requests,  bug   reports   and   bug   fixes/patches   is   available   at:
       &lt;https://github.com/duncs/clusterssh&gt;

       If   you   require   support,   please   run   the   following   commands   and   create  an  issue  via:
       &lt;https://github.com/duncs/clusterssh/issues&gt;

       "perl -V"

       "perl -MTk -e 'print $Tk::VERSION,$/'"

       "perl -MX11::Protocol -e 'print $X11::Protocol::VERSION,$/'"

       "cat /etc/csshrc $HOME/.clusterssh/config"

       Using the debug option (--debug) will turn on debugging output.  Repeat the option to increase the amount
       of debug.  However, if possible please only use this option with one host at a time, e.g.  "cssh  --debug
       &lt;host&gt;" due to the amount of output produced (in both main and child windows).
