</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       int6keth - Qualcomm Atheros Ethernet PHY Settings

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>int6keth</b> [<u>options</u>] [<u>device</u>] [<u>device</u>] [...]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Read or write INT6x00 Ethernet PHY Settings using VS_ENET_SETTINGS.

       This program is part of the Qualcomm Atheros Powerline Toolkit.  See the <b>plc</b> man page for an overview and
       installation instructions.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       -<b>a</b> <u>mode</u>
              Advertise auto-negotiate capabilities.  This option takes effect when option <b>-w</b> is present.  It is
              ignored  when  option  <b>-r</b> is present.  Valid values are "<b>1000Full</b>", "<b>100Full</b>", "<b>100Half</b>", "<b>10Full</b>"
              and "<b>10Half</b>".  The default value is no advertisement of capabilities.

       -<b>d</b> <u>mode</u>
              Device duplex transmission mode.  This option takes effect when  option  <b>-w</b>  is  present.   It  is
              ignored  when  option  <b>-r</b>  is  present.  Valid values are "<b>Half</b>" and "<b>Full</b>".  The default value is
              "<b>Half</b>".

       -<b>e</b>     Redirects stderr messages to stdout.  By convention status  and  error  messages  are  printed  on
              stderr while primary program output is printed on stdout.  This option prints all output on stdout
              in cases where this is desired.

       -<b>f</b> <u>control</u>
              Flow  control  enable.   This  option  takes effect when option <b>-w</b> is present.  It is ignored when
              option <b>-r</b> is present.  Valid values are "<b>On</b>", "<b>Off</b>", "<b>Tx</b>" and "<b>Rx</b>".  The default value is "<b>Off</b>".

       -<b>n</b> <u>mode</u>
              Auto-negotiate mode.  This option takes effect when option <b>-w</b> is  present.   It  is  ignored  when
              option <b>-r</b> is present.  Valid values are "<b>On</b>" and "<b>Off</b>".  The default value is "<b>On</b>".

       -<b>p</b> <u>number</u>
              The  ethernet  port  number.   Available  port numbers differ with chipset and firmware version so
              consult the appropriate technical documentation.  Permitted values are <b>0</b> through <b>7</b>.   The  default
              port is <b>0</b>.

       -<b>s</b> <u>speed</u>
              Network  transmission  speed  in mbps.  This option takes effect when option <b>-w</b> is present.  It is
              ignored when option <b>-r</b> is present.  Valid values are "<b>10</b>", "<b>100</b>" and "<b>1000</b>".  The default value is
              "<b>10</b>".

       -<b>i</b> <u>interface</u>
              Select the host Ethernet interface.  All requests are  sent  via  this  host  interface  and  only
              reponses  received  via this host interface are recognized.  The default interface is <b>eth1</b> because
              most people use <b>eth0</b> as their principle network connection; however, if environment  string  "PLC"
              is defined then it takes precedence over the default interface.  This option then takes precedence
              over either default.

       -<b>q</b>     Suppresses status messages on stderr.

       -<b>r</b>     Read  settings  from  the  Ethernet  interface  on the designated port.  If present, or implied by
              default, then options <b>-a</b>, <b>-d</b>, <b>-f</b>, <b>-n</b> and <b>-s</b> have  no  effect.   This  option  and  option  <b>-w</b>  are
              mutually exclusive.

       -<b>v</b>     Print  additional  information  on stdout.  In particular, this option dumps incoming and outgoing
              packets which can be saved as text files for reference.

       -<b>w</b>     Write settings to the Ethernet interface on the specified port.  Be sure to specify  all  settings
              to avoid writing default values.  This option and option <b>-r</b> are mutually exclusive.

       -<b>?</b>,--<b>help</b>
              Print  program  help  summary  on  stdout.  This option takes precedence over other options on the
              command line.

       -<b>?</b>,--<b>version</b>
              Print program version information on stdout.  This option takes precedence over other  options  on
              the  command line.  Use this option when sending screen dumps to Atheros Technical Support so that
              they know exactly which version of the Linux Toolkit you are using.

</pre><h4><b>ARGUMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>device</u> The MAC address of some powerline device.  More than one address may be specified on  the  command
              line.  If more than one address is specified then operations are performed on each device in turn.
              The default address is <b>local</b>.  See <b>DEVICES</b> for information.

</pre><h4><b>DEVICES</b></h4><pre>
       Powerline  devices  use  Ethernet  Media Access Control (MAC) addresses.  A MAC address is a 48-bit value
       entered as 12 hexadecimal digits in upper, lower or mixed character case.  Octets may be  separated  with
       colons  for  clarity.  For example, "00b052000001", "00:b0:52:00:00:01" and "00b052:000001" are valid and
       equivalent.

       The following MAC addresses are special and may be entered by name instead of number.

       <b>all</b>    Same as "broadcast".

       <b>broadcast</b>
              A synonym for the Ethernet broadcast address,  <b>FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF</b>.   All  devices,  whether  local,
              remote  or  foreign recognize messages sent to this address.  A remote device is any device at the
              far end of a powerline connection.  A foreign device is any device not manufactured by Atheros.

       <b>local</b>  A  synonym  for  the  Qualcomm  Atheros  vendor   specific   Local   Management   Address   (LMA),
              <b>00:B0:52:00:00:01</b>.   All  local  Atheros  devices  recognize  this  address but remote and foreign
              devices do not.  A remote device is any device at the  far  end  of  a  powerline  connection.   A
              foreign device is any device not manufactured by Atheros.
