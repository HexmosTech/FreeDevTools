</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       plchostd2 - Qualcomm Atheros Panther/Lynx PLC Host Daemon

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>plchostd2</b> [<b>options</b>] <b>-N</b> <u>nvmfile</u> <b>-P</b> <u>pibfile</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Wait  for  VS_HST_ACTION.IND  messages  from a local device and service them as described in the Qualcomm
       Atheros Firmware Technical Reference  Manual  for  powerline  devices.   Unlike  programs  <b>int6khost</b>  and
       <b>int64host</b>,  this  program  uses operating system features available on POSIX, Unix, BSD and Linux systems
       but not available on Microsoft or VxWorks systems.  This program supports chipsets QCA6410,  QCA7000  and
       QCA7420.

       To use the program, connect a flash-less device to the host via ethernet then start this program with the
       correct  filenames.   The  program  will  automatically  respond  to  device  requests to download memory
       configuration, firmware and/or parameters and upload firmware or and/or parameters under device  control.
       See the Qualcomm Atheros Firmware Technical Reference Manual for more information.

       This program is part of the Qualcomm Atheros Powerline Toolkit.  See the <b>plc</b> man page for an overview and
       installation instructions.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-i</b> <u>interface</u>
              Select  the  host  Ethernet interface.  All requests are sent via this interface and only reponses
              received via this interface are recognized.  The default interface is <b>eth1</b> because most people use
              <b>eth0</b> as their principle network connection; however, if environment string "PLC" is  defined  then
              it  takes  precedence  over  the default interface.  This option then takes precedence over either
              default.

       -<b>N</b> <u>nvmfile</u>
              The file containing the firmware chain used to boot and flash the device.  The file must exist and
              have a valid NVM file format or it will be rejected.  No assumptions are made  based  on  filename
              and no filename conventions are enforced.  The program will not over-write this file.  This option
              and argument are required.

       -<b>n</b> <u>filename</u>
              Use  this  file  to store firmware uploaded from the local device.  The file need not exist but an
              error will occur if it cannot be created or written.  If firmware is uploaded to this file, it  is
              used  for subsequent firmware downloads unless the device requests a factory reset.  In that case,
              the file specified by option -<b>N</b> is used.  This option and argument are optional.  If omitted  then
              the default filename <b>host.pib</b> will be used.

       -<b>P</b> <u>pibfile</u>
              The  file  containing  the parameter chain used to boot and flash the device.  The file must exist
              and have a valid PIB file format or it will  be  rejected.   No  assumptions  are  made  based  on
              filename  and  no  filename  conventions are enforced.  The program will not over-write this file.
              This option and argument are required.

       -<b>p</b> <u>filename</u>
              Use this file to store parameters uploaded from the local device.  The file need not exist but  an
              error  will  occur if it cannot be created or written.  Once parameters are uploaded to this file,
              it is used for subsequent parameter downloads unless the device requests a factory reset.  In that
              case, the file specified by option -<b>P</b> is used.  This option and argument are optional.  If omitted
              then the default filename <b>host.nvm</b> will be used.

       -<b>q</b>     Suppress status messages on stderr.

       -<b>S</b> <u>filename</u>
              The file containing the softloader chain used to flash the device.   The  presence  of  this  file
              causes the device to be flashed once it has booted.  The file must exist and have a valid PIB file
              format  or  it  will  be  rejected.   No  assumptions  are  made based on filename and no filename
              conventions are enforced.  The program will not over-write this file.  This  option  and  argument
              are required.

       -<b>t</b> <u>timeout</u>
              Read  timeout  in  milliseconds.   Values range from 0 through UINT_MAX.  This is the maximum time
              allowed for a response.  The default is shown in brackets on the program menu.

       -<b>v</b>     Print additional information on stdout.  In  particular,  this  option  will  print  incoming  and
              outgoing Ethernet frames on stdout.

       -<b>w</b> <u>wakeup</u>
              Wakeup  time in seconds.  If no VS_HST_ACTION.IND message is received within this time period then
              the process will wakeup and perform periodic functions such as posting network topography  to  the
              server socket specified by option <b>-s</b>.

       -<b>?</b>, --<b>help</b>
              Print  program  help  summary  on  stdout.  This option takes precedence over other options on the
              command line.

       -<b>!</b>, --<b>version</b>
              Print program version information on stdout.  This option takes precedence over other  options  on
              the  command line.  Use this option when sending screen dumps to Atheros Technical Support so that
              they know exactly which version of the Linux Toolkit you are using.

</pre><h4><b>ARGUMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>REFERENCES</b></h4><pre>
       See the Qualcomm Atheros HomePlug AV Firmware Technical Reference Manual for more information.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       The following example starts the host server.  The -<b>N</b> and -<b>P</b> options are always required.   Option  order
       is  not  important.   Control  does not return to the console until the program is terminated by the user
       using CTRL-C or another command line interrupt.

          # plchostd2 -N test.nvm -P test.pib -n temp.nvm -p temp.pib

       The next example does the same but spawns the program as an independent process and  returns  control  to
       the  console.   In this case, that process must be terminated or killed using an appropriate command such
       ad <b>kill</b>.

          # plchostd2 -N test.nvm -P test.pib -n temp.nvm -p temp.pib -d
