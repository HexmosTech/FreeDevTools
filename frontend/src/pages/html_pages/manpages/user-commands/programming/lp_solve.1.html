       lp_solve - a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) solver

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>lp_solve</b> [<u>options</u>] [<u>input</u> <u>file</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>lp_solve</b>  solves  mixed  integer  linear  programming problems. The program accepts models of problems in
       various different formats (including custom formats through XLIs) and attempts to solve them. There are a
       large number of different options which can be used to alter the solving process to  improve  performance
       or get more accurate results.

   <b>lp</b> <b>file</b> <b>format</b>
       The  lp  file  format  is  a  simple, human readable file format for linear programming models. It is the
       default format used by <b>lp_solve</b>.

       The format consists of series of statements, each ending in a semicolon. The first  statement  is  always
       the objective function, followed by any number of constraints, followed by any number of declarations.

       The  objective function consists of an expression to be optimized, optionally prefixed by <b>max:</b> or <b>min:</b> to
       specify which direction to optimize. The default is to maximize.

       Each constraint consists of a relational expression, optionally prefixed by a name followed by  a  colon.
       The  expression  must contain at least one relational operator (<b>&lt;</b>, <b>&lt;=</b>, <b>=</b>, <b>=&gt;</b>, <b>&gt;</b>).  You can specify ranges
       two operators at once (e.g. 2 &lt; x &lt; 4) instead of two separate constraints.

       Declarations can be one of:

       <b>int</b> <u>var1</u> [<b>,</b> <u>var2</u>]... ;
              Marks the variables as integers.

       <b>bin</b> <u>var1</u> [<b>,</b> <u>var2</u>]... ;
              Marks the variables as binary (can only take 0 or 1).

       <b>sec</b> <u>var1</u> [<b>,</b> <u>var2</u>]... ;
              Marks the variables as semi-continuous. These variables can always take the value 0 even if it  is
              outside the variable's range.

       <b>free</b> <u>var1</u> [<b>,</b> <u>var2</u>]... ;
              Marks  the  variables  as  free. These variables have no lower bound, unlike other variables which
              have a default lower bound of 0.

       <b>sos</b> [<u>name</u><b>:</b>] <u>var1</u> [<b>,</b> <u>var2</u>]... [&lt; <u>sostype</u>];
              Marks the variables as part of a special ordered set (SOS). Out of the variables listed, only  one
              can  be non-zero at once. If <u>sostype</u> is specified, then up to that number of variables can be non-
              zero as long as they are all adjacent to each other (e.g. for an <u>sostype</u> of 2, <u>var1</u> and <u>var2</u> could
              be non-zero, but not <u>var1</u> and <u>var3</u>).

       Both C style comments (<b>/*</b> comment here <b>*/</b>) and C++ style comments (<b>//</b> comment until end of line)  can  be
       used anywhere in the file.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>General</b> <b>options</b>
       <b>-wafter</b>
              Writes  the  model after solving it (normally any model conversions are processed before solving).
              This is useful if presolving is used to simplify the model.

       <b>-parse_only</b>
              Parse the input model, but stop before solving it. This can be  used  to  convert  models  between
              formats without solving them.

       <b>-timeout</b> <u>sec</u>
              Timeout if no solution has be found after <u>sec</u> seconds.

       <b>-nonames</b>
              Ignore  variable  and  constraint  names  in  the  input model (this is the same as combining both

       <b>-norownames</b>
              Ignore constraint names in the input model.

              Create a dump of internal model variables after solving the model, to given file.

       <b>-i</b>[<b>a</b>]  Print all intermediate valid solutions. If <b>a</b> is used, prints only non-zero values. Can give useful
              solutions even if the total run time is too long.

   <b>Parameter</b> <b>files</b>
       <b>-rpar</b> <u>filename</u>
              Reads  a  list  of parameters from a file. The parameters file can specify the same options as you
              can by passing arguments to <b>lp_solve</b> but can be more convenient if you  need  to  change  lots  of
              settings.  The  format  of  the  parameters  file  is  in  the  INI  format  often used by Windows
              applications.  All parameters are read from key-value pairs  in  a  single  section.  The  default
              section is <b>[Default]</b>.

       <b>-rparopt</b> '<b>-h</b> <u>header</u>'
              Sets  options  for  reading the parameters file. Currently the only option is <b>-h</b> which changes the
              section within the file to read the parameters from.

       <b>-wpar</b> <u>filename</u>
              Writes a parameters file based on the arguments given to <b>lp_solve</b>.

       <b>-wparopt</b> '<b>-h</b> <u>header</u>'
              Sets options for writing the parameter file. Currently the only option is  <b>-h</b>  which  changes  the
              section within the file to write the parameters to.

   <b>Basis</b> <b>files</b>
       <b>-rbas</b> <u>filename</u>
              Reads  a basis file which is used as the starting point for solving the LP model. Basis files must
              be in MPS basis format.

       <b>-gbas</b> <u>filename</u>
              Computes a basis from a list of initial guesses for each variable. Each line of the given file  is
              in the format: <u>variable</u><b>:</b><u>value</u> where <u>value</u> is the initial guess for <u>variable</u>.

       <b>-wbas</b> <u>filename</u>
              After  solving  the  LP model, writes a basis file in MPS format. This file can be read back using
              <b>-rbas</b>.

              Available options:
              <b>0</b>    no crash basis (default).
              <b>1</b>    most feasible basis.
              <b>2</b>    least degenerate basis.

   <b>Integer</b> <b>and</b> <b>branch</b> <b>and</b> <b>bound</b> <b>options</b>
       <b>-noint</b> Ignore integer restrictions on variables.

       <b>-f</b>     Stops the branch and bound algorithm immediately after finding its first solution.

       <b>-o</b> <u>bound</u>
              Stops the branch and bound algorithm immediately after finding a solution whose objective function
              has a value greater than this bound.

       <b>-b</b> <u>bound</u>
              Sets a lower bound for the objective function. The branch and  bound  algorithm  will  immediately
              reject all solutions lower than this value.

       <b>-depth</b> <u>limit</u>
              Sets  the  depth limit for the branch and bound algorithm. A value of 0 disables depth limiting. A
              negative value sets a relative depth limit based on the number of variables in  the  input  model.
              The default limit is -50.

       <b>-e</b> <u>tolerance</u>
              Sets  the  tolerance  which  is used to determine whether a floating point number is an integer. A
              number has to be within this value of an integer to be considered one. The default value is 1e-7.

       <b>-g</b> <u>tolerance</u>, <b>-ga</b> <u>tolerance</u>
              Sets the absolute MIP gap used by the branch and bound algorithm. This tolerance is the difference
              between the best-found solution yet and the current solution. If the difference  is  smaller  than
              this  tolerance  then  the  solution  (and  all the sub-solutions) is rejected. This can result in
              faster solving times, but results in a solution which is not the  perfect  solution.  The  default
              value is 1e-11.

       <b>-gr</b> <u>tolerance</u>
              Sets  the relative MIP gap used by the branch and bound algorithm. This is similar to the absolute
              tolerance except that the difference is scaled by the best found solution before being compared to
              this tolerance. The default value is 1e-11.

       <b>-c</b>, <b>-cc</b>
              During branch and bound, take the ceiling branch first.

       <b>-cf</b>    During branch and bound, take the floor branch first.

       <b>-ca</b>    During branch and bound, allow the algorithm to decide which branch to take.  This is the default.

       <b>-n</b> <u>solution</u>
              If the branch and bound algorithm produces multiple solutions with  the  same  objective  function
              value, prints the nth solution. Solution numbers start at 1.

       <b>-B</b><u>rule</u> Sets a branch and bound rule to use. The default rules are: <b>-B5</b> <b>-Bg</b> <b>-Bd</b> <b>-Bc</b>

              These rules are mutually exclusive:
              <b>0</b>    select lowest indexed non-integer column.
              <b>1</b>    selection based on distance from the current bounds.
              <b>2</b>    selection based on the largest current bound.
              <b>3</b>    selection based on largest fractional value.
              <b>4</b>    simple, unweighted pseudo-cost of a variable.
              <b>5</b>    extended pseudo-costing strategy based on minimizing the number of integer infeasibilities.
              <b>6</b>    extended  pseudo-costing  strategy  based on maximizing the normal pseudo-cost divided by the
                   number of infeasibilities.

              The above rules can be combined with any of the following:
              <b>w</b>    WeightReverse - select by criterion minimum (worst), rather than criterion maximum (best).
              <b>b</b>    BranchReverse - when <b>-ca</b> is selected, choose the opposite direction.
              <b>g</b>    Greedy
              <b>p</b>    PseudoCost - toggles between weighting based on pseudocost or objective function value.
              <b>f</b>    DepthFirst - select the node that has already been selected before the most number of times.
              <b>r</b>    Randomize - ddds a randomization factor to the score for any node candidate.
              <b>G</b>    GubMode
              <b>d</b>    Dynamic - when <b>-Bf</b> is selected, switch off this mode when a first solution is found.
              <b>s</b>    RestartMode - enables regular restarts of pseudocost value calculations.
              <b>B</b>    BreadthFirst - select the node that has been selected before the fewest number  of  times  or
                   not at all.
              <b>o</b>    AutoOrder - order variables to improve branch-and-bound performance.
              <b>c</b>    ReducedCostFixing - do bound tightening during B&amp;B based of reduced cost info.
              <b>i</b>    StringInit - initialize pseudo-costs by strong branching.

   <b>Simplex</b> <b>algorithm</b> <b>options</b>
       <b>-prim</b>, <b>-simplexpp</b>
              Prefer the primal simplex method for both phase 1 and phase 2.

       <b>-dual</b>, <b>-simplexdd</b>
              Prefer the dual simplex method for both phase 1 and phase 2.

       <b>-simplexdp</b>
              Prefer the dual simplex method for phase 1 and primal method for phase 2. This is the default.

       <b>-simplexpd</b>
              Prefer the primal simplex method for phase 1 and dual method for phase 2.

       <b>-bfp</b> <u>filename</u>
              Sets  the  basis  factorization package to use.  <u>filename</u> refers to a shared library loaded in the
              same way <b>-rxli</b> loads libraries.

       <b>-o</b><u>value</u>
              Sets whether the objective function is stored in the top  row  of  the  constraint  matrix  or  in
              separate  storage.   <b>-o0</b> places the matrix in separate storage, and <b>-o1</b> (the default) places it in
              the constraint matrix.

       <b>-C</b><u>mode</u> Sets the basis crash mode. When base crash is enabled, a heuristic 'crash procedure'  is  executed
              before  the  first  simplex  iteration  to quickly choose a basis matrix that has fewer artificial
              variables. This procedure tends to reduce the number of iterations to optimality since a number of
              iterations are skipped.

       <b>-r</b> <u>value</u>
              Sets the maximum number of pivots between a re-inversion of the  matrix.  For  stability  reasons,
              lp_solve  re-inverts  the matrix on regular times. The default is 250 for the LUSOL bfp and 42 for
              the other BFPs.

       <b>-trej</b> <u>value</u>
              Sets the value that is used as a tolerance pivot element to determine whether a  value  should  be
              considered as 0. The default is 2e-7.

       <b>-epsd</b> <u>value</u>
              Sets  the  value that is used as a tolerance for reduced costs to determine whether a value should
              be considered as 0. The default is 1e-9.

       <b>-epsb</b> <u>value</u>
              Sets the value that is used as a tolerance for the Right Hand Side (RHS) to  determine  whether  a
              value should be considered as 0.  The default is 1e-10.

       <b>-epsel</b> <u>value</u>
              Sets the value that is used as a tolerance for rounding values to zero. The default is 1e-12.

       <b>-epsp</b> <u>value</u>
              Sets  the  value  that  is  used as perturbation scalar for degenerative problems.  The default is
              1e-5.

       <b>-improve</b><u>level</u>
              Sets the iterative improvement level.  <u>level</u> is a number which can be  created  by  combining  the
              different levels below. The default is <b>-improve6</b>.

              <b>0</b>    none.
              <b>1</b>    running accuracy measurement of solved equations on Bx=r.
              <b>2</b>    improve initial dual feasibility by bound flips.
              <b>4</b>    low-cost accuracy monitoring in the dual.
              <b>8</b>    check for primal/dual feasibility at the node level.

       <b>-piv</b><u>rule</u>
              Sets a simplex pivot rule or mode to use. The default rules are: <b>-piv2</b> <b>-piva</b>

              These rules are mutually exclusive:
              <b>0</b>    select first.
              <b>1</b>    select according to Dantzig.
              <b>2</b>    select Devex pricing from Paula Harris.
              <b>3</b>    select steepest edge.

              The above rules can be combined with any of the following modes:
              <b>f</b>    PrimalFallback - when steepest edge (<b>-priv3</b>) is selected, fallback to Devex in primal.
              <b>m</b>    Multiple  -  preliminary  implementation  of  the  multiple  pricing  scheme. This means that
                   attractive candidate entering columns from one  iteration  may  be  used  in  the  subsequent
                   iteration,  avoiding  full updating of reduced costs. In the current implementation, lp_solve
                   only reuses the 2nd best entering column alternative
              <b>a</b>    Adaptive - temporarily use alternative strategy if cycling is detected.
              <b>r</b>    Randomize - adds a small randomization effect to the selected pricer.
              <b>ll</b>   LoopLeft - scan entering/leaving columns left rather than right.
              <b>la</b>   LoopAlternate - scan entering/leaving columns alternating left/right.
              <b>h</b>    HarrisTwoPass - use Harris' primal pivot logic rather than the default.
              <b>t</b>    TrueNormInit - use true norms for Devex and Steepest Edge initializations.

       <b>-degen</b><u>option</u>

   <b>Other</b> <b>solving</b> <b>options</b>
       <b>-presolve</b>[<u>option</u>]
              Enables a presolve option. These options attempt to speed up calculations by simplifying the model
              before solving it. Any of these options can be combined together. If <u>option</u> is not specified,  row
              and  column presolving is enabled (as if <b>-presolverow</b> <b>-presolvecol</b> had been used). The default not
              to presolve.

              Available options:
              <b>row</b>  Rows - presolve rows.
              <b>col</b>  Cols - presolve columns.
              <b>l</b>    LinDep - eliminate linearly dependent rows.
              <b>s</b>    Sos - convert constraints to SOSes (only SOS type 1 handled).
              <b>r</b>    ReduceMip - if the phase 1 solution process finds that a constraint is  redundant  then  this
                   constraint is deleted.
              <b>k</b>    Knapsack - simplification of knapsack-type constraints through addition of an extra variable,
                   which also helps bound the objective function.
              <b>q</b>    ElimEQ2  -  direct  substitution  of  one  variable  in  2-element equality constraints; this
                   requires changes to the constraint matrix.
              <b>m</b>    MergeRows - merges neighboring &gt;= or &lt;= constraints when the vectors are otherwise relatively
                   identical into a single ranged constraint.
              <b>fd</b>   ColFixDual - variable fixing and removal based on considering signs of  the  associated  dual
                   constraint.
              <b>bnd</b>  Bounds - does bound tightening based on full-row constraint information.
              <b>d</b>    Duals - presolve duals.
              <b>f</b>    ImpliedFree - identify implied free variables (releasing their explicit bounds).
              <b>slk</b>  ImpliedSlk-  converts  qualifying equalities to inequalities by converting a column singleton
                   variable to slack.
              <b>g</b>    ReduceGCD - reduce (tighten) coefficients in integer models based on GCD argument.
              <b>b</b>    ProbeFix - attempt to fix binary variables at one of their bounds.
              <b>c</b>    ProbeReduce - attempt to reduce coefficients in binary models.
              <b>rowd</b> RowDominate - identify and delete qualifying constraints that are dominated by  others,  also
                   fixes variables at a bound.
              <b>cold</b> ColDominate  -  deletes variables (mainly binary), that are dominated by others (only one can
                   be non-zero).

       <b>-s</b>[<u>mode</u>] [<u>scalelimit</u>]
              Sets the scaling algorithm and/or scaling limit to use.  <u>scalelimit</u> can  only  be  specified  when
              using  the  mutually  exclusive  integer modes. Omitting <u>mode</u> is the equivalent of using <b>-s4</b>.  The
              default algorithm and limit is: <b>-s1</b> <b>5</b> <b>-si</b> <b>-se</b>

              These rules are mutually exclusive:
              <b>0</b>    no scaling.
              <b>1</b>    geometric scaling.
              <b>2</b>    Curtis-Reid scaling.
              <b>3</b>    scale to convergence using largest absolute value.
              <b>4</b>    numerical range-based scaling.
              <b>5</b>    scale to convergence using logarithmic mean of all values.
              <b>6</b>    scale based on the simple numerical range.
              <b>7</b>    scale quadratic.

              The above rules can be combined with any of the following:
              <b>p</b>    also do power scaling.
              <b>i</b>    also scale integer variables.
              <b>e</b>    ensure no scaled number is outside the range -1..1.

   <b>Model</b> <b>solving</b>
       The following example shows a model being solved by <b>lp_solve</b>.  The  first  line  contains  the  objective
       function to be maximized and the last 3 lines contain the constraints.

       $ <b>cat</b> <b>example.lp</b>
       max: 143 x + 60 y;

       120 x + 210 y &lt;= 15000;
       110 x + 30 y &lt;= 4000;
       x + y &lt;= 75;

       $ <b>lp_solve</b> <b>-S3</b> <b>example.lp</b>
       Value of objective function: 6315.63

       Actual values of the variables:
       x                          21.875
       y                          53.125

       Actual values of the constraints:
       R1                        13781.2
       R2                           4000
       R3                             75
