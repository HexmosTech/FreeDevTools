</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       turing - assistant to learn algorithms and programming languages

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>

       <b>turing</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>turing</b> is an assistant to learn algorithms and programming languages

       Turing is a free and cross-platform app whose main goal is to assist the learning of algorithms and
       programming languages by providing easy-to-use development tools to all.

       It provides a lighter alternative to the well-known Algobox, which is the currently de-facto widely used
       solution.

       It provides two work modes:

       •   Algorithm mode

           •   Uses a "natural" pseudocode language similar to the one used in Algobox and school books.

           •   Assisted development

       •   Program mode

           •   Uses Python, for the more experienced

       In both modes, the code can be debugged and executed step-by-step to facilitate the problem-solving side
       of development.
