</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       <b>PLM</b> - Cross-platform Programming Exerciser

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>plm</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>Programmer's</b>  <b>Learning</b>  <b>Machine</b>  <b>(PLM)</b>  is  a free cross-platform programming exerciser. It lets you
       explore various concepts of programming through interactive exercises, that you can solve in either Java,
       python or scala (see below for the Scala support).  The interface and the whole content  is  thoughtfully
       translated to English and French, and mostly translated to Brazilian and Italian.

       The following lessons are included in this package:

       <b>.</b> <b>Welcome:</b>   Teaches the basics of programming to absolute beginners

       <b>.</b> <b>Maze:</b>      Presents some classical maze escaping algorithms for intermediate

       <b>.</b> <b>Sort:</b>      Focuses  on  the  classical  sorting  algorithms  for  intermediate. One introduction lesson
                    presents the basics of the sorting algorithms while two additional  lessons  apply  them  in
                    more recreating settings.

       <b>.</b> <b>Recursion:</b> Dives into classical logo algorithms for intermediate

       <b>.</b> <b>Turtle</b> <b>Art:</b>
                    Presents  a  few  classical LOGO figures; your imagination will certainly explore this world
                    further.

       <b>.</b> <b>LightBot:</b>  Constitutes a little programmer's brain teaser for intermediate and advanced

       This program is released under the GNU General Public License, while the content is  released  under  the
       CC-BY-SA version. It requires Java version 1.6 or higher, either from OpenJDK or from another vendor.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>PLM</b>  does not accept any command-line switch or options; every elements are configured either through the
       user-defined property file, or within the graphical interface directly.

</pre><h4><b>FUTURE</b> <b>EVOLUTION</b></h4><pre>
       Other lessons are planned to explore new concepts, such as the backtracking, dynamic programming, object-
       oriented programming or the standard libraries of python and Java. Other programming languages  (such  as
       ruby or JavaScript) may be added in the future. We hope that the translation of the interface and content
       to other human languages will be contributed by the community in the future.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <a href="file:~/.plm/plm.properties">~/.plm/plm.properties</a>
              User-configured properties.

       <a href="file:~/.plm/plm.users">~/.plm/plm.users</a>
              List of PLM users defined on this machine.

       <a href="file:~/.plm/">~/.plm/</a>&lt;UUID&gt;/
              Save files for each user. This contains the text that you provided to solve the exercises. You can
              copy  them  over to another machine to continue your work, but you probably don't want to manually
              mess up with these files. If both machines are connected to the Internet, it  is  much  easier  to
              recreate  a  user  with the same UUID on the second machine, and let the PLM synchronize the files
              for you.
