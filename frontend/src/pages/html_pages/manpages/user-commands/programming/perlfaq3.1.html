           &lt;<a href="http://www.cpan.org/misc/olddoc/FMTEYEWTK.tgz">http://www.cpan.org/misc/olddoc/FMTEYEWTK.tgz</a>&gt;  (not  a  man-page  but still useful, a collection of
           various essays on Perl techniques)

       A crude table of contents for the Perl manpage set is found in perltoc.

   <b>How</b> <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>use</b> <b>Perl</b> <b>interactively?</b>
       The typical approach uses the Perl debugger,  described  in  the  <b><a href="../man1/perldebug.1.html">perldebug</a></b>(1)  manpage,  on  an  "empty"
       program, like this:

           perl -de 42

       Now  just  type  in  any  legal Perl code, and it will be immediately evaluated. You can also examine the
       symbol table, get stack  backtraces,  check  variable  values,  set  breakpoints,  and  other  operations
       typically found in symbolic debuggers.

       You  can  also  use  Devel::REPL which is an interactive shell for Perl, commonly known as a REPL - Read,
       Evaluate, Print, Loop. It provides various handy features.

   <b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>which</b> <b>modules</b> <b>are</b> <b>installed</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>system?</b>
       From the command line, you can use the "cpan" command's "-l" switch:

           $ cpan -l

       You can also use "cpan"'s "-a" switch to create an autobundle file that "CPAN.pm" understands and can use
       to re-install every module:

           $ cpan -a

       Inside a Perl program, you can use the ExtUtils::Installed module to show  all  installed  distributions,
       although  it can take awhile to do its magic. The standard library which comes with Perl just shows up as
       "Perl" (although you can get those with Module::CoreList).

           use ExtUtils::Installed;

           my $inst    = ExtUtils::Installed-&gt;new();
           my @modules = $inst-&gt;modules();

       If you want a list of all of the Perl module filenames, you can use File::Find::Rule:

           use File::Find::Rule;

           my @files = File::Find::Rule-&gt;
               extras({follow =&gt; 1})-&gt;
               file()-&gt;
               name( '*.pm' )-&gt;
               in( @INC )
               ;

       If you do not have that module, you can do the same thing with File::Find which is part of  the  standard
       library:

           use File::Find;
           my @files;

           find(
               {
               wanted =&gt; sub {
                   push @files, $File::Find::fullname
                   if -f $File::Find::fullname &amp;&amp; /\.pm$/
               },
               follow =&gt; 1,
               follow_skip =&gt; 2,
               },
               @INC
           );

           print join "\n", @files;

       If you simply need to check quickly to see if a module is available, you can check for its documentation.
       If  you  can  read  the  documentation  the  module  is  most  likely  installed.  If you cannot read the
       documentation, the module might not have any (in rare cases):

           $ perldoc Module::Name

       You can also try to include the module in a one-liner to see if perl finds it:

           $ perl -MModule::Name -e1

       (If you don't receive a "Can't locate ... in @INC" error message, then Perl found  the  module  name  you
       asked for.)

   <b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>debug</b> <b>my</b> <b>Perl</b> <b>programs?</b>
       (contributed by brian d foy)

       Before  you  do anything else, you can help yourself by ensuring that you let Perl tell you about problem
       areas in your code. By turning on warnings and strictures, you can head off many problems before they get
       too big. You can find out more about these in strict and warnings.

           #!<a href="file:///usr/lib/w3m/cgi-bin/w3mman2html.cgi?perl">/usr/bin/perl</a>
           use strict;
           use warnings;

       Beyond that, the simplest debugger is the "print" function. Use it to look at  values  as  you  run  your
       program:

           print STDERR "The value is [$value]\n";

       The Data::Dumper module can pretty-print Perl data structures:

           use Data::Dumper qw( Dumper );
           print STDERR "The hash is " . Dumper( \%hash ) . "\n";

       Perl  comes  with an interactive debugger, which you can start with the "-d" switch. It's fully explained
       in perldebug.

       If you'd like a graphical user interface and you have Tk, you can use "ptkdb". It's on CPAN and available
       for free.

       If you need something much more sophisticated and controllable, Leon Brocard's Devel::ebug (which you can
       call with the "-D" switch as "-Debug") gives you the programmatic hooks into everything you need to write
       your own (without too much pain and suffering).

       You can also use a commercial debugger such as Affrus (Mac OS X), Komodo from  Activestate  (Windows  and
       Mac OS X), or EPIC (most platforms).

   <b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>profile</b> <b>my</b> <b>Perl</b> <b>programs?</b>
       (contributed by brian d foy, updated Fri Jul 25 12:22:26 PDT 2008)

       The "Devel" namespace has several modules which you can use to profile your Perl programs.

       The Devel::NYTProf (New York Times Profiler) does both statement and subroutine profiling. It's available
       from CPAN and you also invoke it with the "-d" switch:

           perl -d:NYTProf some_perl.pl

       It  creates  a  database  of  the  profile  information that you can turn into reports. The "nytprofhtml"
       command turns the data into an HTML report similar to the Devel::Cover report:

           nytprofhtml

       You might also be interested in using the Benchmark to measure and compare code snippets.

       You can read more about profiling in <u>Programming</u> <u>Perl</u>, chapter 20, or <u>Mastering</u> <u>Perl</u>, chapter 5.

       perldebguts documents creating a custom debugger if you need to create a special sort of profiler.  brian
       d    foy    describes    the    process    in   <u>The</u>   <u>Perl</u>   <u>Journal</u>,   "Creating   a   Perl   Debugger",
       &lt;<a href="http://www.ddj.com/184404522">http://www.ddj.com/184404522</a>&gt; , and "Profiling in Perl" &lt;<a href="http://www.ddj.com/184404580">http://www.ddj.com/184404580</a>&gt; .

       Perl.com  has  two  interesting   articles   on   profiling:   "Profiling   Perl",   by   Simon   Cozens,
       &lt;https://www.perl.com/pub/2004/06/25/profiling.html/&gt;    and    "Debugging    and    Profiling   mod_perl
       Applications", by Frank Wiles, &lt;<a href="http://www.perl.com/pub/a/2006/02/09/debug_mod_perl.html">http://www.perl.com/pub/a/2006/02/09/debug_mod_perl.html</a>&gt; .

       Randal L. Schwartz writes  about  profiling  in  "Speeding  up  Your  Perl  Programs"  for  <u>Unix</u>  <u>Review</u>,
       &lt;<a href="http://www.stonehenge.com/merlyn/UnixReview/col49.html">http://www.stonehenge.com/merlyn/UnixReview/col49.html</a>&gt;   ,  and  "Profiling  in  Template  Toolkit  via
       Overriding" for <u>Linux</u> <u>Magazine</u>, &lt;<a href="http://www.stonehenge.com/merlyn/LinuxMag/col75.html">http://www.stonehenge.com/merlyn/LinuxMag/col75.html</a>&gt; .

   <b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>cross-reference</b> <b>my</b> <b>Perl</b> <b>programs?</b>
       The B::Xref module can be used to generate cross-reference reports for Perl programs.

           perl -MO=Xref[,OPTIONS] scriptname.plx

   <b>Is</b> <b>there</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty-printer</b> <b>(formatter)</b> <b>for</b> <b>Perl?</b>
       Perl::Tidy comes with a perl script perltidy which indents and reformats Perl scripts to make them easier
       to read by trying to follow the rules of the perlstyle. If you write Perl, or  spend  much  time  reading
       Perl, you will probably find it useful.

       Of course, if you simply follow the guidelines in perlstyle, you shouldn't need to reformat. The habit of
       formatting  your  code  as  you write it will help prevent bugs. Your editor can and should help you with
       this. The perl-mode or newer cperl-mode for emacs can provide remarkable amounts of help with  most  (but
       not  all)  code,  and even less programmable editors can provide significant assistance. Tom Christiansen
       and many other VI users swear by the following settings in vi and its clones:

           set ai sw=4
           map! ^O {^M}^[O^T

       Put that in your <u>.exrc</u> file (replacing the caret characters with control characters) and away you go.  In
       insert  mode,  ^T  is  for indenting, ^D is for undenting, and ^O is for blockdenting--as it were. A more
       complete         example,         with         comments,         can         be         found          at
       &lt;<a href="http://www.cpan.org/authors/id/T/TO/TOMC/scripts/toms.exrc.gz">http://www.cpan.org/authors/id/T/TO/TOMC/scripts/toms.exrc.gz</a>&gt;

   <b>Is</b> <b>there</b> <b>an</b> <b>IDE</b> <b>or</b> <b>Windows</b> <b>Perl</b> <b>Editor?</b>
       Perl programs are just plain text, so any editor will do.

       If you're on Unix, you already have an IDE--Unix itself. The Unix philosophy is the philosophy of several
       small tools that each do one thing and do it well. It's like a carpenter's toolbox.

       If you want an IDE, check the following (in alphabetical order, not order of preference):

       Eclipse
           &lt;<a href="http://e-p-i-c.sf.net/">http://e-p-i-c.sf.net/</a>&gt;

           The Eclipse Perl Integration Project integrates Perl editing/debugging with Eclipse.

       Kephra
           &lt;<a href="http://kephra.sf.net">http://kephra.sf.net</a>&gt;

           GUI editor written in Perl using wxWidgets and Scintilla with lots of smaller features.  Aims  for  a
           UI  based  on  Perl  principles like TIMTOWTDI and "easy things should be easy, hard things should be
           possible".

       Komodo
           &lt;<a href="http://www.ActiveState.com/Products/Komodo/">http://www.ActiveState.com/Products/Komodo/</a>&gt;

           ActiveState's cross-platform (as of October 2004, that's Windows, Linux, and Solaris), multi-language
           IDE has Perl support, including a regular expression debugger and remote debugging.

       Notepad++
           &lt;<a href="http://notepad-plus.sourceforge.net/">http://notepad-plus.sourceforge.net/</a>&gt;

       Open Perl IDE
           &lt;<a href="http://open-perl-ide.sourceforge.net/">http://open-perl-ide.sourceforge.net/</a>&gt;

           Open Perl IDE is an integrated development environment for writing and debugging  Perl  scripts  with
           ActiveState's ActivePerl distribution under Windows 95/98/NT/2000.

       OptiPerl
           &lt;<a href="http://www.optiperl.com/">http://www.optiperl.com/</a>&gt;

           OptiPerl  is a Windows IDE with simulated CGI environment, including debugger and syntax-highlighting
           editor.

       Padre
           &lt;<a href="http://padre.perlide.org/">http://padre.perlide.org/</a>&gt;

           Padre is cross-platform IDE for Perl written in Perl using wxWidgets to provide  a  native  look  and
           feel. It's open source under the Artistic License. It is one of the newer Perl IDEs.

           Visual Perl is a Visual Studio.NET plug-in from ActiveState.

       Zeus
           &lt;<a href="http://www.zeusedit.com/lookmain.html">http://www.zeusedit.com/lookmain.html</a>&gt;

           Zeus for Windows is another Win32 multi-language editor/IDE that comes with support for Perl.

       For  editors: if you're on Unix you probably have vi or a vi clone already, and possibly an emacs too, so
       you may not need to download anything. In any emacs the cperl-mode (M-x cperl-mode) gives you perhaps the
       best available Perl editing mode in any editor.

       If you are using Windows, you can use any editor that lets you work with plain text, such as  NotePad  or
       WordPad.  Word processors, such as Microsoft Word or WordPerfect, typically do not work since they insert
       all sorts of behind-the-scenes information, although some allow you to save files as "Text Only". You can
       also   download   text   editors   designed   specifically   for   programming,   such   as   Textpad   (
       &lt;<a href="http://www.textpad.com/">http://www.textpad.com/</a>&gt; ) and UltraEdit ( &lt;<a href="http://www.ultraedit.com/">http://www.ultraedit.com/</a>&gt; ), among others.

       If  you  are using MacOS, the same concerns apply. MacPerl (for Classic environments) comes with a simple
       editor. Popular external editors are BBEdit ( &lt;<a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/">http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/</a>&gt; )  or  Alpha  (
       &lt;<a href="http://www.his.com/~jguyer/Alpha/Alpha8.html">http://www.his.com/~jguyer/Alpha/Alpha8.html</a>&gt; ). MacOS X users can use Unix editors as well.

       GNU Emacs
           &lt;<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/windows/ntemacs.html">http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/windows/ntemacs.html</a>&gt;

       MicroEMACS
           &lt;<a href="http://www.microemacs.de/">http://www.microemacs.de/</a>&gt;

       XEmacs
           &lt;<a href="http://www.xemacs.org/Download/index.html">http://www.xemacs.org/Download/index.html</a>&gt;

       Jed &lt;<a href="http://space.mit.edu/~davis/jed/">http://space.mit.edu/~davis/jed/</a>&gt;

       or a vi clone such as

       Vim &lt;<a href="http://www.vim.org/">http://www.vim.org/</a>&gt;

       Vile
           &lt;<a href="http://invisible-island.net/vile/vile.html">http://invisible-island.net/vile/vile.html</a>&gt;

       The following are Win32 multilanguage editor/IDEs that support Perl:

       MultiEdit
           &lt;<a href="http://www.MultiEdit.com/">http://www.MultiEdit.com/</a>&gt;

       SlickEdit
           &lt;<a href="http://www.slickedit.com/">http://www.slickedit.com/</a>&gt;

       ConTEXT
           &lt;<a href="http://www.contexteditor.org/">http://www.contexteditor.org/</a>&gt;

       There  is  also a toyedit Text widget based editor written in Perl that is distributed with the Tk module
       on CPAN. The ptkdb ( &lt;<a href="http://ptkdb.sourceforge.net/">http://ptkdb.sourceforge.net/</a>&gt; )  is  a  Perl/Tk-based  debugger  that  acts  as  a
       development  environment of sorts. Perl Composer ( &lt;<a href="http://perlcomposer.sourceforge.net/">http://perlcomposer.sourceforge.net/</a>&gt; ) is an IDE for
       Perl/Tk GUI creation.

       In addition to an editor/IDE you might be interested in a more powerful shell environment for Win32. Your
       options include

       bash
           from the Cygwin package ( &lt;<a href="http://cygwin.com/">http://cygwin.com/</a>&gt; )

       zsh &lt;<a href="http://www.zsh.org/">http://www.zsh.org/</a>&gt;

       Cygwin is covered by the GNU General Public License (but that shouldn't  matter  for  Perl  use).  Cygwin
       contains (in addition to the shell) a comprehensive set of standard Unix toolkit utilities.

       BBEdit and TextWrangler
           are text editors for OS X that have a Perl sensitivity mode ( &lt;<a href="http://www.barebones.com/">http://www.barebones.com/</a>&gt; ).

   <b>Where</b> <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>Perl</b> <b>macros</b> <b>for</b> <b>vi?</b>
       For     a     complete     version     of    Tom    Christiansen's    vi    configuration    file,    see
       &lt;<a href="http://www.cpan.org/authors/id/T/TO/TOMC/scripts/toms.exrc.gz">http://www.cpan.org/authors/id/T/TO/TOMC/scripts/toms.exrc.gz</a>&gt; , the  standard  benchmark  file  for  vi
       emulators. The file runs best with nvi, the current version of vi out of Berkeley, which incidentally can
       be built with an embedded Perl interpreter--see &lt;<a href="http://www.cpan.org/src/misc/">http://www.cpan.org/src/misc/</a>&gt; .

   <b>Where</b> <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>perl-mode</b> <b>or</b> <b>cperl-mode</b> <b>for</b> <b>emacs?</b>
       Since  Emacs version 19 patchlevel 22 or so, there have been both a perl-mode.el and support for the Perl
       debugger built in. These should come with the standard Emacs 19 distribution.

       Note that the perl-mode of emacs will  have  fits  with  "main'foo"  (single  quote),  and  mess  up  the
       indentation  and  highlighting.  You  are  probably  using  "main::foo"  in new Perl code anyway, so this
       shouldn't be an issue.

       For CPerlMode, see &lt;<a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/CPerlMode">http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/CPerlMode</a>&gt;

   <b>How</b> <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>use</b> <b>curses</b> <b>with</b> <b>Perl?</b>
       The Curses module from CPAN provides a dynamically loadable object module interface to a curses  library.
       A  small  demo  can be found at the directory &lt;<a href="http://www.cpan.org/authors/id/T/TO/TOMC/scripts/rep.gz">http://www.cpan.org/authors/id/T/TO/TOMC/scripts/rep.gz</a>&gt; ;

   <b>How</b> <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>write</b> <b>a</b> <b>GUI</b> <b>(X,</b> <b>Tk,</b> <b>Gtk,</b> <b>etc.)</b> <b>in</b> <b>Perl?</b>
       (contributed by Ben Morrow)

       There are a number of modules which let you write GUIs in Perl. Most GUI toolkits have a perl  interface:
       an incomplete list follows.

       Tk  This  works under Unix and Windows, and the current version doesn't look half as bad under Windows as
           it used to. Some of the gui elements still don't 'feel' quite right, though. The  interface  is  very
           natural  and 'perlish', making it easy to use in small scripts that just need a simple gui. It hasn't
           been updated in a while.

       Wx  This is a Perl binding for the cross-platform wxWidgets toolkit (  &lt;<a href="http://www.wxwidgets.org">http://www.wxwidgets.org</a>&gt;  ).  It
           works  under  Unix,  Win32 and Mac OS X, using native widgets (Gtk under Unix). The interface follows
           the C++ interface closely, but the documentation is a little sparse for someone who doesn't know  the
           library, mostly just referring you to the C++ documentation.

       Gtk and Gtk2
           These  are  Perl  bindings  for  the  Gtk  toolkit  (  &lt;<a href="http://www.gtk.org">http://www.gtk.org</a>&gt;  ). The interface changed
           significantly between versions 1 and 2 so they have separate Perl modules. It runs under Unix,  Win32
           and  Mac OS X (currently it requires an X server on Mac OS, but a 'native' port is underway), and the
           widgets look the same on every platform: i.e., they don't match the native widgets. As with  Wx,  the
           Perl  bindings  follow  the  C  API  closely,  and  the  documentation  requires  you  to  read the C
           documentation to understand it.

       Win32::GUI
           This provides access to most of the Win32 GUI widgets from  Perl.   Obviously,  it  only  runs  under
           Win32,  and  uses native widgets. The Perl interface doesn't really follow the C interface: it's been
           made more Perlish, and the documentation is pretty good. More advanced stuff may require  familiarity
           with the C Win32 APIs, or reference to MSDN.

       CamelBones
           CamelBones  (  &lt;<a href="http://camelbones.sourceforge.net">http://camelbones.sourceforge.net</a>&gt;  )  is  a  Perl  interface to Mac OS X's Cocoa GUI
           toolkit, and as such can be used to produce native GUIs on Mac OS X. It's not on CPAN, as it requires
           frameworks that CPAN.pm doesn't know how to install, but installation is via the standard OSX package
           installer. The Perl API is, again, very close to the ObjC API it's wrapping,  and  the  documentation
           just tells you how to translate from one to the other.

       Qt  There is a Perl interface to TrollTech's Qt toolkit, but it does not appear to be maintained.

       Athena
           Sx  is  an interface to the Athena widget set which comes with X, but again it appears not to be much
           used nowadays.

   <b>How</b> <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>make</b> <b>my</b> <b>Perl</b> <b>program</b> <b>run</b> <b>faster?</b>
       The best way to do this is to come up with a better algorithm. This can often make a dramatic difference.
       Jon Bentley's book <u>Programming</u> <u>Pearls</u> (that's not a misspelling!)  has some good  tips  on  optimization,
       too. Advice on benchmarking boils down to: benchmark and profile to make sure you're optimizing the right
       part,  look for better algorithms instead of microtuning your code, and when all else fails consider just
       buying faster hardware. You will probably want to read the answer to  the  earlier  question  "How  do  I
       profile my Perl programs?" if you haven't done so already.

       A  different  approach  is to autoload seldom-used Perl code. See the AutoSplit and AutoLoader modules in
       the standard distribution for that. Or you could locate the bottleneck and think about writing just  that
       part  in  C,  the  way  we  used  to  take  bottlenecks in C code and write them in assembler. Similar to
       rewriting in C, modules that have critical sections can be written in C (for  instance,  the  PDL  module
       from CPAN).

       If  you're  currently  linking  your  perl  executable  to  a shared <u>libc.so</u>, you can often gain a 10-25%
       performance benefit by rebuilding it to link with a static libc.a instead. This will make a  bigger  perl
       executable,  but  your  Perl programs (and programmers) may thank you for it. See the <u>INSTALL</u> file in the
       source distribution for more information.

       The undump program was an ancient attempt to speed up Perl program by storing the  already-compiled  form
       to  disk.  This is no longer a viable option, as it only worked on a few architectures, and wasn't a good
       solution anyway.

   <b>How</b> <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>make</b> <b>my</b> <b>Perl</b> <b>program</b> <b>take</b> <b>less</b> <b>memory?</b>
       When it comes to time-space tradeoffs, Perl nearly always prefers to throw memory at a  problem.  Scalars
       in  Perl  use  more memory than strings in C, arrays take more than that, and hashes use even more. While
       there's still a lot to be done, recent releases have been addressing these issues.  For  example,  as  of
       5.004, duplicate hash keys are shared amongst all hashes using them, so require no reallocation.

       In some cases, using <b>substr()</b> or <b>vec()</b> to simulate arrays can be highly beneficial. For example, an array
       of  a  thousand booleans will take at least 20,000 bytes of space, but it can be turned into one 125-byte
       bit vector--a considerable memory savings. The standard Tie::SubstrHash module can also help for  certain
       types  of  data  structure.  If  you're  working with specialist data structures (matrices, for instance)
       modules that implement these in C may use less memory than equivalent Perl modules.

       Another thing to try is learning whether your Perl was compiled with the system  malloc  or  with  Perl's
       builtin  malloc.  Whichever  one  it is, try using the other one and see whether this makes a difference.
       Information about malloc is in the <u>INSTALL</u> file in the source distribution. You can find out whether  you
       are using perl's malloc by typing "perl -V:usemymalloc".

       Of  course,  the  best  way  to  save  memory  is to not do anything to waste it in the first place. Good
       programming practices can go a long way toward this:

       Don't slurp!
           Don't read an entire file into memory if you can process it line by line. Or more concretely,  use  a
           loop like this:

               #
               # Good Idea
               #
               while (my $line = &lt;$file_handle&gt;) {
                  # ...
               }

           instead of this:

               #
               # Bad Idea
               #
               my @data = &lt;$file_handle&gt;;
               foreach (@data) {
                   # ...
               }

           When  the files you're processing are small, it doesn't much matter which way you do it, but it makes
           a huge difference when they start getting larger.

       Use map and grep selectively
           Remember that both map and grep expect a LIST argument, so doing this:

                   @wanted = grep {/pattern/} &lt;$file_handle&gt;;

           will cause the entire file to be slurped. For large files, it's better to loop:

                   while (&lt;$file_handle&gt;) {
                           push(@wanted, $_) if /pattern/;
                   }

       Avoid unnecessary quotes and stringification
           Don't quote large strings unless absolutely necessary:

                   my $copy = "$large_string";

           makes 2 copies of $large_string (one for $copy and another for the quotes), whereas

                   my $copy = $large_string;

           only makes one copy.

           Ditto for stringifying large arrays:

               {
               local $, = "\n";
               print @big_array;
               }

           is much more memory-efficient than either

               print join "\n", @big_array;

           or

               {
               local $" = "\n";
               print "@big_array";
               }

       Pass by reference
           Pass arrays and hashes by reference, not by value. For one thing, it's the only way to pass  multiple
           lists  or  hashes  (or  both)  in  a  single  call/return.  It also avoids creating a copy of all the
           contents. This requires some judgement, however, because any changes will be propagated back  to  the
           original  data. If you really want to mangle (er, modify) a copy, you'll have to sacrifice the memory
           needed to make one.

       Tie large variables to disk
           For "big" data stores (i.e. ones that exceed available memory) consider using one of the  DB  modules
           to  store it on disk instead of in RAM. This will incur a penalty in access time, but that's probably
           better than causing your hard disk to thrash due to massive swapping.

   <b>Is</b> <b>it</b> <b>safe</b> <b>to</b> <b>return</b> <b>a</b> <b>reference</b> <b>to</b> <b>local</b> <b>or</b> <b>lexical</b> <b>data?</b>
       Yes. Perl's garbage collection system takes care of this so everything works out right.

           sub makeone {
               my @a = ( 1 .. 10 );
               return \@a;
           }

           for ( 1 .. 10 ) {
               push @many, makeone();
           }

           print $many[4][5], "\n";

           print "@many\n";

   <b>How</b> <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>free</b> <b>an</b> <b>array</b> <b>or</b> <b>hash</b> <b>so</b> <b>my</b> <b>program</b> <b>shrinks?</b>
       (contributed by Michael Carman)

       You usually can't. Memory allocated to lexicals (i.e. <b>my()</b> variables) cannot be reclaimed or reused  even
       if  they  go out of scope. It is reserved in case the variables come back into scope. Memory allocated to
       global variables can be reused (within your program) by using <b>undef()</b> and/or <b>delete()</b>.

       On most operating systems, memory allocated to a program can never be returned to the system. That's  why
       long-running  programs  sometimes  re- exec themselves. Some operating systems (notably, systems that use
       <b><a href="../man2/mmap.2.html">mmap</a></b>(2) for allocating large chunks of memory) can reclaim memory that is no longer  used,  but  on  such
       systems, perl must be configured and compiled to use the OS's malloc, not perl's.

       In  general, memory allocation and de-allocation isn't something you can or should be worrying about much
       in Perl.

       See also "How can I make my Perl program take less memory?"

   <b>How</b> <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>make</b> <b>my</b> <b>CGI</b> <b>script</b> <b>more</b> <b>efficient?</b>
       Beyond the normal measures described to make general Perl programs faster or smaller, a CGI  program  has
       additional  issues.  It may be run several times per second. Given that each time it runs it will need to
       be re-compiled and will often allocate a megabyte or more  of  system  memory,  this  can  be  a  killer.
       Compiling  into  C  <b>isn't</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>you</b> because the process start-up overhead is where the bottleneck
       is.

       There are three popular ways to avoid this overhead. One solution involves running the Apache HTTP server
       (available from &lt;<a href="http://www.apache.org/">http://www.apache.org/</a>&gt; ) with either of the mod_perl or mod_fastcgi plugin modules.

       With mod_perl and the Apache::Registry module  (distributed  with  mod_perl),  httpd  will  run  with  an
       embedded  Perl  interpreter  which  pre-compiles your script and then executes it within the same address
       space without forking. The Apache extension also gives Perl access to the internal server API, so modules
       written in Perl can do just about anything a  module  written  in  C  can.  For  more  on  mod_perl,  see
       &lt;<a href="http://perl.apache.org/">http://perl.apache.org/</a>&gt;

       With  the  FCGI module (from CPAN) and the mod_fastcgi module (available from &lt;<a href="http://www.fastcgi.com/">http://www.fastcgi.com/</a>&gt; )
       each of your Perl programs becomes a permanent CGI daemon process.

       Finally, Plack is a Perl module and toolkit that contains PSGI middleware, helpers and  adapters  to  web
       servers,  allowing you to easily deploy scripts which can continue running, and provides flexibility with
       regards to which web server you use. It can allow existing CGI scripts  to  enjoy  this  flexibility  and
       performance  with  minimal  changes, or can be used along with modern Perl web frameworks to make writing
       and deploying web services with Perl a breeze.

       These solutions can have far-reaching effects on your system and on the way you write your CGI  programs,
       so investigate them with care.

       See also &lt;<a href="http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-category/15_World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI/">http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-category/15_World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI/</a>&gt; .

   <b>How</b> <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>hide</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> <b>for</b> <b>my</b> <b>Perl</b> <b>program?</b>
       Delete  it. :-) Seriously, there are a number of (mostly unsatisfactory) solutions with varying levels of
       "security".

       First of all, however, you <u>can't</u> take away read permission, because the source code has to be readable in
       order to be compiled and interpreted. (That doesn't mean that a CGI script's source is readable by people
       on the web, though--only by people with access to the filesystem.)  So you have to leave the  permissions
       at the socially friendly 0755 level.

       Some  people regard this as a security problem. If your program does insecure things and relies on people
       not knowing how to exploit those insecurities, it is not secure. It is  often  possible  for  someone  to
       determine  the  insecure  things and exploit them without viewing the source. Security through obscurity,
       the name for hiding your bugs instead of fixing them, is little security indeed.

       You can try using  encryption  via  source  filters  (Starting  from  Perl  5.8  the  Filter::Simple  and
       Filter::Util::Call  modules are included in the standard distribution), but any decent programmer will be
       able to decrypt it. You can try using the byte code compiler and interpreter described later in perlfaq3,
       but the curious might still be able to  de-compile  it.  You  can  try  using  the  native-code  compiler
       described  later,  but crackers might be able to disassemble it. These pose varying degrees of difficulty
       to people wanting to get at your code, but none can definitively conceal it (true of every language,  not
       just Perl).

       It  is  very  easy  to  recover  the  source  of  Perl  programs. You simply feed the program to the perl
       interpreter and use the modules in the B:: hierarchy. The B::Deparse module should be able to defeat most
       attempts to hide source. Again, this is not unique to Perl.

       If you're concerned about people profiting from your code, then the bottom line is  that  nothing  but  a
       restrictive  license  will  give you legal security. License your software and pepper it with threatening
       statements like "This is unpublished proprietary software of XYZ Corp.  Your access to it does  not  give
       you  permission  to use it blah blah blah."  We are not lawyers, of course, so you should see a lawyer if
       you want to be sure your license's wording will stand up in court.

   <b>How</b> <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>compile</b> <b>my</b> <b>Perl</b> <b>program</b> <b>into</b> <b>byte</b> <b>code</b> <b>or</b> <b>C?</b>
       (contributed by brian d foy)

       In general, you can't do this. There are some things that may work  for  your  situation  though.  People
       usually  ask  this  question  because  they want to distribute their works without giving away the source
       code, and most solutions trade disk space for convenience.  You  probably  won't  see  much  of  a  speed
       increase either, since most solutions simply bundle a Perl interpreter in the final product (but see "How
       can I make my Perl program run faster?").

       The  Perl  Archive  Toolkit  is  Perl's  analog  to  Java's  JAR.  It's  freely  available  and on CPAN (
       &lt;https://metacpan.org/pod/PAR&gt; ).

       There are also some commercial products that may work for you, although you have to  buy  a  license  for
       them.

       The  Perl Dev Kit ( &lt;<a href="http://www.activestate.com/Products/Perl_Dev_Kit/">http://www.activestate.com/Products/Perl_Dev_Kit/</a>&gt; ) from ActiveState can "Turn your
       Perl programs into ready-to-run executables for HP-UX, Linux, Solaris and Windows."

       Perl2Exe ( &lt;<a href="http://www.indigostar.com/perl2exe.htm">http://www.indigostar.com/perl2exe.htm</a>&gt; ) is a  command  line  program  for  converting  perl
       scripts to executable files. It targets both Windows and Unix platforms.

   <b>How</b> <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>"#!perl"</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>on</b> <b>[MS-DOS,NT,...]?</b>
       For OS/2 just use

           extproc perl -S -your_switches

       as the first line in "*.cmd" file ("-S" due to a bug in cmd.exe's "extproc" handling). For DOS one should
       first  invent  a  corresponding batch file and codify it in "ALTERNATE_SHEBANG" (see the <u>dosish.h</u> file in
       the source distribution for more information).

       The Win95/NT installation, when using the ActiveState port of Perl, will modify the Registry to associate
       the ".pl" extension with the perl interpreter. If you install another port, perhaps  even  building  your
       own  Win95/NT  Perl  from  the  standard  sources  by  using  a Windows port of gcc (e.g., with cygwin or
       mingw32), then you'll have to modify the Registry yourself. In addition to  associating  ".pl"  with  the
       interpreter,   NT   people   can   use:   "SET   PATHEXT=%PATHEXT%;.PL"  to  let  them  run  the  program
       "install-linux.pl" merely by typing "install-linux".

       Under "Classic" MacOS, a perl program will have the appropriate Creator and Type, so that double-clicking
       them will invoke the MacPerl application.  Under Mac OS X, clickable apps  can  be  made  from  any  "#!"
       script using Wil Sanchez' DropScript utility: &lt;<a href="http://www.wsanchez.net/software/">http://www.wsanchez.net/software/</a>&gt; .

       <u>IMPORTANT!</u>:  Whatever  you do, PLEASE don't get frustrated, and just throw the perl interpreter into your
       cgi-bin directory, in order to get your programs working for a web  server.  This  is  an  EXTREMELY  big
       security risk. Take the time to figure out how to do it correctly.

   <b>Can</b> <b>I</b> <b>write</b> <b>useful</b> <b>Perl</b> <b>programs</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>command</b> <b>line?</b>
       Yes.  Read perlrun for more information. Some examples follow.  (These assume standard Unix shell quoting
       rules.)

           # sum first and last fields
           perl -lane 'print $F[0] + $F[-1]' *

           # identify text files
           perl -le 'for(@ARGV) {print if -f &amp;&amp; -T _}' *

           # remove (most) comments from C program
           perl -0777 -pe 's{/\*.*?\*/}{}gs' foo.c

           # make file a month younger than today, defeating reaper daemons
           perl -e '$X=24*60*60; utime(time(),time() + 30 * $X,@ARGV)' *

           # find first unused uid
           perl -le '$i++ while getpwuid($i); print $i'

           # display reasonable manpath
           echo $PATH | perl -nl -072 -e '
           s![^/+]*$!man!&amp;&amp;-d&amp;&amp;!$s{$_}++&amp;&amp;push@m,$_;END{print"@m"}'

       OK, the last one was actually an Obfuscated Perl Contest entry. :-)

   <b>Why</b> <b>don't</b> <b>Perl</b> <b>one-liners</b> <b>work</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>DOS/Mac/VMS</b> <b>system?</b>
       The problem is usually that the command interpreters on those systems have rather different  ideas  about
       quoting  than  the  Unix shells under which the one-liners were created. On some systems, you may have to
       change single-quotes to double ones, which you must <u>NOT</u> do on Unix or Plan9 systems. You might also  have
       to change a single % to a %%.

       For example:

           # Unix (including Mac OS X)
           perl -e 'print "Hello world\n"'

           # DOS, etc.
           perl -e "print \"Hello world\n\""

           # Mac Classic
           print "Hello world\n"
            (then Run "Myscript" or Shift-Command-R)

           # MPW
           perl -e 'print "Hello world\n"'

           # VMS
           perl -e "print ""Hello world\n"""

       The  problem  is  that none of these examples are reliable: they depend on the command interpreter. Under
       Unix, the first two often work. Under DOS, it's entirely possible that neither works.  If  4DOS  was  the
       command shell, you'd probably have better luck like this:

         perl -e "print &lt;Ctrl-x&gt;"Hello world\n&lt;Ctrl-x&gt;""

       Under  the  Mac, it depends which environment you are using. The MacPerl shell, or MPW, is much like Unix
       shells in its support for several quoting variants, except that it makes free use of the Mac's  non-ASCII
       characters as control characters.

       Using  <b>qq()</b>,  q(),  and <b>qx()</b>, instead of "double quotes", 'single quotes', and `backticks`, may make one-
       liners easier to write.

       There is no general solution to all of this. It is a mess.

   <b>Where</b> <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>learn</b> <b>about</b> <b>CGI</b> <b>or</b> <b>Web</b> <b>programming</b> <b>in</b> <b>Perl?</b>
       For modules, get the CGI or LWP modules from CPAN. For textbooks, see the two especially dedicated to web
       stuff in the question on books. For problems and questions related to the web, like "Why  do  I  get  500
       Errors"  or  "Why  doesn't  it run from the browser right when it runs fine on the command line", see the
       troubleshooting guides and references in perlfaq9 or in the CGI MetaFAQ:

           L&lt;<a href="http://www.perl.org/CGI_MetaFAQ.html">http://www.perl.org/CGI_MetaFAQ.html</a>&gt;

       Looking into &lt;https://plackperl.org&gt; and modern Perl web frameworks is highly  recommended,  though;  web
       programming in Perl has evolved a long way from the old days of simple CGI scripts.

   <b>Where</b> <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>learn</b> <b>about</b> <b>object-oriented</b> <b>Perl</b> <b>programming?</b>
       A good place to start is perlootut, and you can use perlobj for reference.

       A  good  book  on OO on Perl is the "Object-Oriented Perl" by Damian Conway from Manning Publications, or
       "Intermediate Perl" by Randal Schwartz, brian d foy, and Tom Phoenix from O'Reilly Media.

   <b>Where</b> <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>learn</b> <b>about</b> <b>linking</b> <b>C</b> <b>with</b> <b>Perl?</b>
       If you want to call C from Perl, start with perlxstut, moving on to perlxs, xsubpp, and perlguts. If  you
       want  to call Perl from C, then read perlembed, perlcall, and perlguts. Don't forget that you can learn a
       lot from looking at how the authors of existing extension modules  wrote  their  code  and  solved  their
       problems.

       You  might  not  need all the power of XS. The Inline::C module lets you put C code directly in your Perl
       source. It handles all the magic to make it work. You still have to learn at least some of the  perl  API
       but you won't have to deal with the complexity of the XS support files.

   <b>I've</b> <b>read</b> <b>perlembed,</b> <b>perlguts,</b> <b>etc.,</b> <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>can't</b> <b>embed</b> <b>perl</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>C</b> <b>program;</b> <b>what</b> <b>am</b> <b>I</b> <b>doing</b> <b>wrong?</b>
       Download  the  ExtUtils::Embed  kit from CPAN and run `make test'. If the tests pass, read the pods again
       and again and again. If they fail, submit a bug report to &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues&gt; with the
       output of "make test TEST_VERBOSE=1" along with "perl -V".

   <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>my</b> <b>script,</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>this</b> <b>message.</b> <b>What</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>mean?</b>
       A complete list of Perl's error messages and warnings with explanatory text can be found in perldiag. You
       can also use the splain program (distributed with Perl) to explain the error messages:

           perl program 2&gt;diag.out
           splain [-v] [-p] diag.out

       or change your program to explain the messages for you:

           use diagnostics;

       or

           use diagnostics -verbose;

   <b>What's</b> <b>MakeMaker?</b>
       (contributed by brian d foy)

       The ExtUtils::MakeMaker module, better known simply as "MakeMaker", turns a Perl script, typically called
       "Makefile.PL", into a Makefile.  The Unix tool "make" uses this file to manage dependencies  and  actions
       to process and install a Perl distribution.
