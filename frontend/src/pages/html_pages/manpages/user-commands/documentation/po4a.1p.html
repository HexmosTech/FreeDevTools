       po4a - update both the PO files and translated documents in one shot

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>po4a</b> [<u>options</u>] <u>config_file</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       po4a (PO for anything) eases the maintenance of documentation translation using the classical gettext
       tools. The main feature of po4a is that it decouples the translation of content from its document
       structure.  Please refer to the page <b><a href="../man7/po4a.7.html">po4a</a></b>(7) for a gentle introduction to this project.

       Upon execution, <b>po4a</b> parses all documentation files specified in its configuration file. It updates the
       PO files (containing the translation) to reflect any change to the documentation, and produce a
       translated documentation by injecting the content's translation (found in the PO files) into the
       structure of the original master document.

       At first, the PO files only contain the strings to translate from the original documentation. This file
       format allows the translators to manually provide a translation for each paragraph extracted by <b>po4a</b>. If
       the documentation is modified after translation, <b>po4a</b> marks the corresponding translations as "fuzzy" in
       the PO file to request a manual review by the translators. The translators can also provide so-called
       "addendum", that are extra content stating for example who did the translation and how to report bugs.

        addendum --&gt;--------------------------------------+

       The workflow of <b>po4a</b> is asynchronous, as suited to open-source projects. The documentation writers author
       the master documents at their own pace. The translators review and update the translations in the PO
       files. The maintainers rerun <b>po4a</b> on need, to reflect any change to the original documentation to the PO
       files, and to produce updated documentation translations, by injecting the latest translation into the
       latest document structure.

       By default, a given translated document is produced when at least 80% of its content is translated. The
       untranslated text is kept in the original language.  The produced documentation thus mixes languages if
       the translation is not complete. You can change the 80% threshold with the <u>--keep</u> option described below.
       Note however that discarding translations as soon as they are not 100% may be discouraging for the
       translators whose work will almost never be shown to the users, while showing "translations" that are too
       incomplete may be troubling for the end users.

       Storing the translated documentation files in the version control system is probably a bad idea, since
       they are automatically generated. The precious files are the PO files, that contain the hard work of your
       fellow translators. Also, some people find it easier to interact with the translators through an online
       platform such as weblate, but this is naturally fully optional.

   <b>Quick</b> <b>start</b> <b>tutorial</b>
       Let's assume you maintain a program named <b>foo</b> which has a man page <u>man/foo.1</u> written in English (the
       bridge language in most open-source projects, but <b>po4a</b> can be used from or to any language). Some times
       ago, someone provided a German translation named <u>man/foo.de.1</u> and disappeared.  This is a problem because
       you just got a bug report saying that your documentation contains a gravely misleading information that
       must be fixed in all languages, but you don't speak German so you can only modify the original, not the
       translation. Now, another contributor wants to contribute a translation to Japanese, a language that you
       don't master either.

       It is time to convert your documentation to <b>po4a</b> to solve your documentation maintenance nightmares. You
       want to update the doc when needed, you want to ease the work of your fellow translators, and you want to
       ensure that your users never see any outdated and thus misleading documentation.

       The conversion includes two steps: setup the po4a infrastructure, and convert the previous German
       translation to salvage the previous work. This latter part is done using po4a-gettextize, as follows. As
       detailed in the documentation of <b><a href="../man1/po4a-gettextize.1.html">po4a-gettextize</a></b>(1), this process rarely fully automatic, but once it's
       done, the <b>de.po</b> file containing the German translation can be integrated in your po4a workflow.

         po4a-gettextize --format man --master foo.1 --localized foo.de.1 --po de.po

       Let's now configure po4a. With the appropriate file layout, your configuration file could be as simple as
       this:

        [po_directory] man/po4a/

        [type: man] man/foo.1 $lang:man/translated/foo.$lang.1

       It specifies that all PO files (containing the work of the translators) are in the <u>man/po4a/</u> directory,
       and that you have only one master file, <u>man/foo.1</u>. If you had several master files, you would have
       several lines similar to the second one. Each such line also specify where to write the corresponding
       translation files. Here, the German translation of <u>man/foo.1</u> is in <u>man/translated/foo.de.1</u>.

       The last thing we need to complete the configuration of <b>po4a</b> is a POT file containing the template
       material that should be used to start a new translation.  Simply create an empty file with the .pot
       extension in the specified po_directory (e.g. <u>man/po4a/foo.pot</u>), and <b>po4a</b> will fill it with the expected
       content.

       Here is a recap of the files in this setup:

         ├── man/
         │   ├── foo.1        &lt;- The original man page, in English
         │   ├── po4a/
         │   │   ├── de.po    &lt;- The German PO translation, from gettextization
         │   │   └── foo.pot  &lt;- The POT template of future translations (empty at first)
         │   └── translated/  &lt;- Directory where the translations will be created
         └── po4a.cfg         &lt;- The configuration file

       Once setup, executing <b>po4a</b> will parse your documentation, update the POT template file, use it to update
       the PO translation files, and use them to update the documentation translation files. All in one command:

               po4a --verbose po4a.cfg

       This is it. <b>po4a</b> is now fully configured. Once you've fixed your error in <u>man/foo.1</u>, the offending
       paragraph in the German translation will be replaced by the fixed text in English. Mixing languages is
       not optimal, but it's the only way to remove errors in translations that you don't even understand, and
       ensure that the content presented to the users is never misleading. Updating the German translation is
       also much easier in the corresponding PO file, so the language mix-up may not last long. Finally, when a
       Japanese translator wants to contribute a new translation, she should rename the foo.pot into ja.po and
       complete the translation. Once you have this file, just drop it in <u>man/po4a/po/</u>. A translated page will
       appear as <u>man/translated/foo.ja.1</u> (provided that enough content is translated) when you run <b>po4a</b> again.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-k</b>, <b>--keep</b>
           Minimal  threshold  for translation percentage to keep (i.e. write) the resulting file (default: 80).
           I.e. by default, files have to be translated at least at 80% to be written on disk.

       <b>-w</b>, <b>--width</b>
           Column at which we should wrap the resulting file if the format supports it (default: 76).

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
           Show a short help message.

       <b>-M</b>, <b>--master-charset</b>
           Charset of the files containing the documents to translate. Note that all master documents  must  use
           the same charset.

       <b>-L</b>, <b>--localized-charset</b>
           Charset  of the files containing the localized documents. Note that all translated documents will use
           the same charset.

       <b>-A</b>, <b>--addendum-charset</b>
           Charset of the addenda. Note that all the addenda should be in the same charset.

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--version</b>
           Display the version of the script and exit.

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b>
           Increase the verbosity of the program.

       <b>-q</b>, <b>--quiet</b>
           Decrease the verbosity of the program.

       <b>-d</b>, <b>--debug</b>
           Output some debugging information.

       <b>-o</b>, <b>--option</b>
           Extra option(s) to pass to the  format  plugin.  See  the  documentation  of  each  plugin  for  more
           information  about  the valid options and their meanings. For example, you could pass '-o tablecells'
           to the AsciiDoc parser, while the text parser would accept '-o tabs=split'.

       <b>-f</b>, <b>--force</b>
           Always generate the POT and PO files, even if <b>po4a</b> considers it is not necessary.

           The default behavior (when <b>--force</b> is not specified) is the following:

               If the POT file already exists, it is regenerated if a master document or the configuration  file
               is  more  recent  (unless  <b>--no-update</b> is provided).  The POT file is also written in a temporary
               document and <b>po4a</b> verifies that the changes are really needed.

               Also, a translation is regenerated only if its master document, the PO file, one of  its  addenda
               or  the  configuration  file is more recent.  To avoid trying to regenerate translations which do
               not pass the threshold test (see <b>--keep</b>), a file with the <u>.po4a-stamp</u> extension  can  be  created
               (see <b>--stamp</b>).

           If a master document includes files, you should use the <b>--force</b> flag because the modification time of
           these included files are not taken into account.

           The PO files are always re-generated based on the POT with <b>msgmerge</b> <b>-U</b>.

       <b>--stamp</b>
           Tells  <b>po4a</b>  to  create stamp files when a translation is not generated because it does not reach the
           threshold. These stamp files are named according  to  the  expected  translated  document,  with  the
           <u>.po4a-stamp</u> extension.

           Note:  This  only activates the creation of the <u>.po4a-stamp</u> files. The stamp files are always used if
           they exist, and they are removed with <b>--rm-translations</b> or when the file is finally translated.

       <b>--no-translations</b>
           Do not generate the translated documents, only update the POT and PO files.

       <b>--no-update</b>
           Do not change the POT and PO files, only the translation may be updated.

       <b>--keep-translations</b>
           Keeps the existing translation files even if the translation doesn't meet the threshold specified  by
           <b>--keep</b>.   This  option  does  not  create  new  translation  files with few content, but it will save
           existing translations which decay because of changes to the master files.

           WARNING: This flag changes the po4a behavior in a rather drastic way: your translated files will  not
           get  updated  at  all  until  the  translation improves. Only use this flag if you prefer shipping an
           outdated translated documentation rather than only shipping an accurate untranslated documentation.

       <b>--rm-translations</b>
           Remove the translated files (implies <b>--no-translations</b>).

       <b>--no-backups</b>
           This flag does nothing since 0.41, and may be removed in later releases.

       <b>--rm-backups</b>
           This flag does nothing since 0.41, and may be removed in later releases.

       <b>--translate-only</b> <u>translated-file</u>
           Translate only the specified file.  It may be useful to speed up processing if a  configuration  file
           contains a lot of files.  Note that this option does not update PO and POT files.  This option can be
           used multiple times.

       <b>--variable</b> <u>var</u><b>=</b><u>value</u>
           Define  a  variable that will be expanded in the <b>po4a</b> configuration file.  Every occurrence of <u>$(var)</u>
           will be replaced by <u>value</u>.  This option can be used multiple times.

       <b>--srcdir</b> <u>SRCDIR</u>
           Set the base directory for all input documents specified in the <b>po4a</b> configuration file.

           If both <u>destdir</u> and <u>srcdir</u> are specified, input files are searched in the following  directories,  in
           order:  <u>destdir</u>,  the current directory and <u>srcdir</u>. Output files are written to <u>destdir</u> if specified,
           or to the current directory.

       <b>--destdir</b> <u>DESTDIR</u>
           Set the base directory for all the output documents specified in the  <b>po4a</b>  configuration  file  (see
           <b>--srcdir</b> above).

   <b>Options</b> <b>modifying</b> <b>the</b> <b>POT</b> <b>header</b>
       <b>--porefs</b> <u>type</u>
           Specify the reference format. Argument <u>type</u> can be one of <b>never</b> to not produce any reference, <b>file</b> to
           only  specify  the  file  without  the  line  number, <b>counter</b> to replace line number by an increasing
           counter, and <b>full</b> to include complete references (default: full).

       <b>--wrap-po</b> <b>no</b>|<b>newlines</b>|<u>number</u> (default: 76)
           Specify how the po file should be wrapped. This gives the choice between either files that are nicely
           wrapped but could lead to git conflicts, or files that are easier to handle automatically, but harder
           to read for humans.

           Historically, the gettext suite has reformatted the po files at the 77th column for  cosmetics.  This
           option  specifies the behavior of po4a. If set to a numerical value, po4a will wrap the po file after
           this column and after newlines in the content. If set to <b>newlines</b>, po4a will only split the msgid and
           msgstr after newlines in the content. If set to <b>no</b>, po4a will not wrap  the  po  file  at  all.   The
           reference comments are always wrapped by the gettext tools that we use internally.

           Note  that  this  option has no impact on how the msgid and msgstr are wrapped, i.e.  on how newlines
           are added to the content of these strings.

       <b>--master-language</b>
           Language of the source files containing the documents to translate. Note that  all  master  documents
           must use the same language.

       <b>--msgid-bugs-address</b> <u>email@address</u>
           Set the report address for msgid bugs. By default, the created POT files have no Report-Msgid-Bugs-To
           fields.

       <b>--copyright-holder</b> <u>string</u>
           Set the copyright holder in the POT header. The default value is "Free Software Foundation, Inc."

       <b>--package-name</b> <u>string</u>
           Set the package name for the POT header. The default is "PACKAGE".

       <b>--package-version</b> <u>string</u>
           Set the package version for the POT header. The default is "VERSION".

   <b>Options</b> <b>to</b> <b>modify</b> <b>the</b> <b>PO</b> <b>files</b>
       <b>--msgmerge-opt</b> <u>options</u>
           Extra options for <b><a href="../man1/msgmerge.1.html">msgmerge</a></b>(1).

           Note: <b>$lang</b> will be extended to the current language.

       <b>--no-previous</b>
           This  option  removes  <b>--previous</b>  from the options passed to <b>msgmerge</b>.  This is necessary to support
           versions of <b>gettext</b> earlier than 0.16.

       <b>--previous</b>
           This option adds <b>--previous</b> to the options passed to <b>msgmerge</b>.  It requires <b>gettext</b>  0.16  or  later,
           and is activated by default.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>FILE</b></h4><pre>
       po4a expects a configuration file as argument. This file must contain the following elements:

       •   The path to the PO files and the list of languages existing in the project;

       •   Optionally,  some  global  options  and so-called configuration aliases that are used as templates to
           configure individual master files;

       •   The list of each master file to translate, along with specific parameters.

       All lines contain a command between square braces, followed by its parameters.  Comments begin  with  the
       char  '#'  and  run  until  the  end of the line. You can escape the end of line to spread a command over
       several lines.

       Some full examples are presented on this page, while other examples can be found in the "t/cfg" directory
       of the source distribution.

   <b>Finding</b> <b>the</b> <b>PO</b> <b>and</b> <b>POT</b> <b>files</b>
       The simplest solution is to explicitly give the path to POT and PO files, as follows:

        [po4a_paths] man/po/project.pot de:man/po/de.po fr:man/po/fr.po

       This specifies the path to the POT file first, and then the paths to the German and French PO files.

       The same information can be written as follows to reduce the risk of copy/paste errors:

        [po4a_langs] fr de
        [po4a_paths] man/po/project.pot $lang:man/po/$lang.po

       The $lang component is automatically expanded using the provided languages list,  reducing  the  risk  of
       copy/paste error when a new language is added.

       You  can further compact the same information by only providing the path to the directory containing your
       translation project, as follows.

        [po_directory] man/po/

       The provided directory must contain a set of PO files, each named <u>XX.po</u> with "XX" the ISO  639-1  of  the
       language  used  in  this  file.  The  directory must also contain a single POT file, with the ".pot" file
       extension. For the first run, this file can be empty but it must exist (po4a cannot guess the name to use
       before the extension).

       Note  that  you  must  choose  only  one  between  "po_directory"  and  "po4a_paths".   The   first   one
       ("po_directory") is more compact, further reduces the risk of copy/paste error, but forces you to use the
       expected project structure and file names. The second one ("po4a_paths"), is more explicit, probably more
       readable, and advised when you setup your first project with po4a.

       <u>Centralized</u> <u>or</u> <u>split</u> <u>PO</u> <u>files?</u>

       By  default,  po4a  produces one single PO file per target language, containing the whole content of your
       translation project. As your project grows, the size of these files may become  problematic.  When  using
       weblate,  it  is  possible  to  specify priorities for each translation segment (i.e., msgid) so that the
       important ones get translated first. Still, some translation teams prefer to split the content in several
       files.

       To have one PO file per master file, you simply have to use the string $master in the  name  of  your  PO
       files on the "[po4a_paths]" line, as follows.

        [po4a_paths] doc/$master/$master.pot $lang:doc/$master/$lang.po

       With this line, po4a will produce separate POT and PO files for each document to translate.  For example,
       if you have 3 documents and 5 languages, this will result in 3 POT files and 15 PO files. These files are
       named  as  specified  on  the  "po4a_paths"  template,  with  $master substituted to the basename of each
       document to translate. In case of name conflict, you can specify the POT file to use as follows, with the
       "pot=" parameter.

       This feature can also be used to group several translated files into the same  POT  file.  The  following
       example  only  produces  2  POT  files:  <u>l10n/po/foo.pot</u>  (containing  the material from <u>foo/gui.xml</u>) and
       <u>l10n/po/bar.pot</u> (containing the material from both <u>bar/gui.xml</u> and <u>bar/cli.xml</u>).

        [po4a_langs] de fr ja
        [po4a_paths] l10n/po/$master.pot $lang:l10n/po/$master.$lang.po
        [type: xml] foo/gui.xml $lang:foo/gui.$lang.xml pot=foo
        [type: xml] bar/gui.xml $lang:bar/gui.$lang.xml pot=bar
        [type: xml] bar/cli.xml $lang:bar/cli.$lang.xml pot=bar

       In split mode, <b>po4a</b> builds a temporary compendium during the PO update, to share the translations between
       all the PO files. If two PO files have different translations for the same string, <b>po4a</b>  will  mark  this
       string  as  fuzzy  and  will  submit  both  translations in all the PO files containing this string. When
       unfuzzied by the translator, the translation is automatically used in every PO files.

   <b>Specifying</b> <b>the</b> <b>documents</b> <b>to</b> <b>translate</b>
       You must also list the documents that should be translated. For each master file, you  must  specify  the
       format  parser  to  use,  the  location  of  the  translated  document  to  produce,  and optionally some
       configuration. File names should be quoted or escaped if they contain spaces. Here is an example:

        [type: sgml] "doc/my stuff.sgml"  "fr:doc/fr/mon truc.sgml"  de:doc/de/mein\ kram.sgml
        [type: man] script fr:doc/fr/script.1 de:doc/de/script.1
        [type: docbook] doc/script.xml fr:doc/fr/script.xml \
                    de:doc/de/script.xml

       But again, these complex lines are difficult to read and modify, e.g. when adding a new language.  It  is
       much simpler to reorganize things using the $lang template as follows:

        [type: sgml]    doc/my_stuff.sgml $lang:doc/$lang/my_stuff.sgml
        [type: man]     script.1          $lang:po/$lang/script.1
        [type: docbook] doc/script.xml    $lang:doc/$lang/script.xml

   <b>Specifying</b> <b>options</b>
       There  is  two  types  of options: <u>po4a</u> <u>options</u> are default values to the po4a command line options while
       <u>format</u> <u>options</u> are used to change the behavior of the format parsers. As a <u>po4a</u> <u>options</u>,  you  could  for
       example specify in your configuration file that the default value of the <b>--keep</b> command line parameter is
       50%  instead  of  80%.  <u>Format</u>  <u>options</u>  are documented on the specific page of each parsing module, e.g.
       <b>Locale::Po4a::<a href="../man3pm/Xml.3pm.html">Xml</a></b>(3pm). You could for example pass <b>nostrip</b> to the XML parser  to  not  strip  the  spaces
       around the extracted strings.

       You  can  pass these options for a specific master file, or even for a specific translation of that file,
       using "opt:" and "opt_XX:" for the "XX" language.  In the following example, the <b>nostrip</b> option is passed
       to the XML parser (for all languages), while  the  threshold  will  be  reduced  to  0%  for  the  French
       translation (that is thus always kept).

        [type:xml] toto.xml $lang:toto.$lang.xml opt:"-o nostrip" opt_fr:"--keep 0"

       In any case, these configuration chunks must be located at the end of the line.  The declaration of files
       must  come  first,  then  the  addendum  if  any  (see below), and then only the options. The grouping of
       configuration chunks is not very important, since elements are internally concatenated  as  strings.  The
       following examples are all equivalent:

         [type:xml] toto.xml $lang:toto.$lang.xml opt:"--keep 20" opt:"-o nostrip" opt_fr:"--keep 0"
         [type:xml] toto.xml $lang:toto.$lang.xml opt:"--keep 20 -o nostrip" opt_fr:"--keep 0"
         [type:xml] toto.xml $lang:toto.$lang.xml opt:--keep opt:20 opt:-o opt:nostrip opt_fr:--keep opt_fr:0

       Note that language specific options are not used when building the POT file. It is for example impossible
       to  pass  <b>nostrip</b>  to  the parser only when building the French translation, because the same POT file is
       used to update every languages. So the only options that can be language-specific are the ones  that  are
       used when producing the translation, as the "--keep" option.

       <u>Configuration</u> <u>aliases</u>

       To  pass  the  same  options to several files, the best is to define a type alias as follows. In the next
       example, "--keep 0" is passed to every Italian translation using this "test" type, that is  an  extension
       of the "man" type.

         [po4a_alias:test] man opt_it:"--keep 0"
         [type: test] man/page.1 $lang:man/$lang/page.1

       You  can  also  extend  an  existing  type  reusing  the  same name for the alias as follows. This is not
       interpreted as as an erroneous recursive definition.

         [po4a_alias:man] man opt_it:"--keep 0"
         [type: man] man/page.1 $lang:man/$lang/page.1

       <u>Global</u> <u>default</u> <u>options</u>

       You can also use "[options]" lines to define options that must be used for all files, regardless of their
       type.

         [options] --keep 20 --option nostrip

       As with the command line options, you can abbreviate the parameters passed in the configuration file:

         [options] -k 20 -o nostrip

       <u>Option</u> <u>priorities</u>

       The options of every sources are concatenated, ensuring that the default values can easily be  overridden
       by more specific options. The order is as follows:

       •   "[options]" lines provide default values that can be overridden by any other source.

       •   Type aliases are then used. Language specific settings override the ones applicable to all languages.

       •   Settings  that are specific to a given master file override both the default ones and the ones coming
           from the type alias. In this case also, language specific settings override the global ones.

       •   Finally, parameters provided on the <b>po4a</b> command line override any settings  from  the  configuration
           file.

       <u>Example</u>

       Here is an example showing how to quote the spaces and quotes:

        [po_directory] man/po/

        [options] --master-charset UTF-8

        [po4a_alias:man] man opt:"-o \"mdoc=NAME,SEE ALSO\""
        [type:man] t-05-config/test02_man.1 $lang:tmp/test02_man.$lang.1 \
                   opt:"-k 75" opt_it:"-L UTF-8" opt_fr:--verbose

   <b>Addendum:</b> <b>Adding</b> <b>extra</b> <b>content</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>translation</b>
       If  you  want  to  add an extra section to the translation, for example to give credit to the translator,
       then you need to define an addendum to the line defining your master  file.  Please  refer  to  the  page
       <b><a href="../man7/po4a.7.html">po4a</a></b>(7) for more details on the syntax of addendum files.

        [type: pod] script fr:doc/fr/script.1 \
                    add_fr:doc/l10n/script.fr.add

       You can also use language templates as follow:

        [type: pod] script $lang:doc/$lang/script.1 \
                    add_$lang:doc/l10n/script.$lang.add

       If an addendum fails to apply, the translation is discarded.

       <u>Modifiers</u> <u>for</u> <u>the</u> <u>addendum</u> <u>declaration</u>

       Addendum  modifiers  can  simplify  the configuration file in the case where not all languages provide an
       addendum, or when the list of addenda changes from one language to the other. The modifier  is  a  single
       char located before the file name.

       <b>?</b> Include <u>addendum_path</u> if this file does exist, otherwise do nothing.

       <b>@</b> <u>addendum_path</u>  is  not  a  regular addendum but a file containing a list of addenda, one by line.  Each
         addendum may be preceded by modifiers.

       <b>!</b> <u>addendum_path</u> is discarded, it  is  not  loaded  and  will  not  be  loaded  by  any  further  addendum
         specification.

       The  following  includes  an addendum in any language, but if only it exists. No error is reported if the
       addendum does not exist.

        [type: pod] script $lang:doc/$lang/script.1  add_$lang:?doc/l10n/script.$lang.add

       The following includes a list of addendum for every language:

        [type: pod] script $lang:doc/$lang/script.1  add_$lang:@doc/l10n/script.$lang.add

   <b>Filtering</b> <b>the</b> <b>translated</b> <b>strings</b>
       Sometimes, you want to hide some strings from the translation process. To that extend,  you  can  give  a
       "pot_in"  parameter to your master file to specify the name of the file to use instead of the real master
       when building the POT file. Here is an example:

         [type:docbook] book.xml          \
                 pot_in:book-filtered.xml \
                 $lang:book.$lang.xml

       With this setting, the strings to translate will be extracted from the <u>book-filtered.xml</u>  (that  must  be
       produced  before  calling  <b>po4a</b>) while the translated files will be built from <u>book.xml</u>. As a result, any
       string that is part of <u>book.xml</u> but not in <u>book-filtered.xml</u> will  not  be  included  in  the  PO  files,
       preventing  the  translators  from  providing  a  translation  for  them.  So  these strings will be left
       unmodified when producing the translated documents.  This naturally decreases the level  of  translation,
       so you may need the "--keep" option to ensure that the document is produced anyway.
