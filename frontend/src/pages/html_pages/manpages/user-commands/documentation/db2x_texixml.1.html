       db2x_texixml - Make Texinfo files from Texi-XML

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>db2x_texixml</b> [options]... [<u>xml-document</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>db2x_texixml</b> converts a Texi-XML document into one or more Texinfo documents.

       If <u>xml-document</u> is not given, then the document to convert comes from standard input.

       The filenames of the Texinfo documents are determined by markup in the Texi-XML source. (If the filenames
       are  not  specified  in  the markup, then <b>db2x_texixml</b> attempts to deduce them from the name of the input
       file. However, the Texi-XML source should specify the filename, because it does not work when  there  are
       multiple output files or when the Texi-XML source comes from standard input.)

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--encoding=</b><u>encoding</u>
              Select  the  character  encoding  used for the output files.  The available encodings are those of
              <b><a href="../man1/iconv.1.html">iconv</a></b>(1).  The default encoding is us-ascii.

              The XML source may contain characters that are not representable in the encoding that you  select;
              in  this case the program will bomb out during processing, and you should choose another encoding.
              (This is guaranteed not to happen with any Unicode encoding such as UTF-8, but  unfortunately  not
              everyone is able to process Unicode texts.)

              If  you  are  using GNU’s version of <b><a href="../man1/iconv.1.html">iconv</a></b>(1), you can affix //TRANSLIT to the end of the encoding
              name to attempt transliterations of any unconvertible characters in the output.  Beware,  however,
              that  the  really  inconvertible  characters  will be turned into another of those damned question
              marks. (Aren’t you sick of this?)

              The suffix //TRANSLIT applied to a Unicode encoding — in particular, utf-8//TRANSLIT — means  that
              the output files are to remain in Unicode, but markup-level character translations using <b>utf8trans</b>
              are  still  to  be  done. So in most cases, an English-language document, converted using <b>--encod‐</b>
              <b>ing=utf-8//TRANSLIT</b> will actually end up as a US-ASCII document, but any untranslatable characters
              will remain as UTF-8 without any  warning  whatsoever.   (Note:  strictly  speaking  this  is  not
              “transliteration”.)   This  method  of  conversion is a compromise over strict <b>--encoding=us-ascii</b>
              processing, which aborts if any untranslatable characters are encountered.

              Note that man pages and Texinfo documents in non-ASCII encodings  (including  UTF-8)  may  not  be
              portable  to older (non-internationalized) systems, which is why the default value for this option
              is us-ascii.

              To suppress any automatic character mapping or encoding conversion  whatsoever,  pass  the  option
              <b>--encoding=utf-8</b>.

       <b>--list-files</b>
              Write a list of all the output files to standard output, in addition to normal processing.

       <b>--output-dir=</b><u>dir</u>
              Specify  the  directory where the output files are placed.  The default is the current working di‐
              rectory.

              This option is ignored if the output is to be written to standard output (triggered by the  option
              <b>--to-stdout</b>).

       <b>--to-stdout</b>
              Write the output to standard output instead of to individual files.

              If  this  option is used even when there are supposed to be multiple output documents, then every‐
              thing is concatenated to standard output.  But beware that most other  programs  will  not  accept
              this concatenated output.

              This option is incompatible with <b>--list-files</b>, obviously.

       <b>--info</b> Pipe the Texinfo output to <b><a href="../man1/makeinfo.1.html">makeinfo</a></b>(1), creating Info files directly instead of Texinfo files.

       <b>--plaintext</b>
              Pipe the Texinfo output to <b>makeinfo</b> <b>--no-headers</b>, thereby creating plain text files.

       <b>--help</b> Show brief usage information and exit.

       <b>--version</b>
              Show version and exit.

       This  program  uses certain other programs for its operation.  If they are not in their default installed
       locations, then use the following options to set their location:

       <b>--utf8trans-program=</b><u>path</u>, <b>--utf8trans-map=</b><u>charmap</u>
              Use the character map <u>charmap</u> with the <b><a href="../man1/utf8trans.1.html">utf8trans</a></b>(1) program, included with docbook2X, found  under
              <u>path</u>.

       <b>--iconv-program=</b><u>path</u>
              The location of the <b><a href="../man1/iconv.1.html">iconv</a></b>(1) program, used for encoding conversions.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Texinfo</b>  <b>language</b>  <b>compatibility</b>.   The Texinfo files generated by <b>db2x_texixml</b> sometimes require Texinfo
       version 4.7 (the latest version) to work properly.  In particular:

       • <b>db2x_texixml</b> relies on <b>makeinfo</b> to automatically add punctuation after a @ref  if  it  it  not  already
         there.  Otherwise  the  hyperlink will not work in the Info reader (although <b>makeinfo</b> will not emit any
         error).

       • The new @comma{} command is used for commas (,) occurring inside argument lists to Texinfo commands, to
         disambiguate it from the comma used to separate different arguments.  The  only  alternative  otherwise
         would be to translate , to .  which is obviously undesirable (but earlier docbook2X versions did this).

         If  you cannot use version 4.7 of <b>makeinfo</b>, you can still use a <b>sed</b> script to perform manually the pro‐
         cedure just outlined.

       <b>Relation</b> <b>of</b> <b>Texi-XML</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>XML</b> <b>output</b> <b>format</b> <b>of</b> <b>makeinfo</b>.  The Texi-XML format used  by  docbook2X  is
       <u>different</u> and incompatible with the XML format generated by <b><a href="../man1/makeinfo.1.html">makeinfo</a></b>(1) with its <b>--xml</b> option.  This sit‐
       uation  arose  partly because the Texi-XML format of docbook2X was designed and implemented independently
       before the appearance of <b>makeinfo</b>’s XML format.  Also Texi-XML is very much geared towards being <u>machine-</u>
       <u>generated</u> <u>from</u> <u>other</u> <u>XML</u> <u>formats</u>, while there seems to be no non-trivial applications of  <b>makeinfo</b>’s  XML
       format.   So  there  is  no  reason at this point for docbook2X to adopt <b>makeinfo</b>’s XML format in lieu of
       Texi-XML.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       • Text wrapping in menus is utterly broken for non-ASCII text.  It is  probably  also  broken  everywhere
         else in the output, but that would be <b>makeinfo</b>’s fault.

       • <b>--list-files</b> might not work correctly with <b>--info</b>. Specifically, when the output Info file get too big,
         <b>makeinfo</b>  will  decide to split it into parts named <u>abc.info-1</u>, <u>abc.info-2</u>, <u>abc.info-3</u>, etc.  <b>db2x_tex‐</b>
         <b>ixml</b> does not know exactly how many of these files there are, though you can just do an <b>ls</b> to find out.
