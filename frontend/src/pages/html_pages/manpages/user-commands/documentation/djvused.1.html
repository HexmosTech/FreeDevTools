</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       djvused - Multi-purpose DjVu document editor.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>djvused</b> <b>[</b><u>options</u><b>]</b> <u>djvufile</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Program  <b>djvused</b>  is  a  powerful  command  line  tool for manipulating multi-page documents, creating or
       editing annotation chunks, creating or editing hidden text layers, pre-computing  thumbnail  images,  and
       more.  The program first reads the DjVu document <u>djvufile</u> and executes a number of djvused commands.

       Djvused  commands  can  be read from a specific file (when option <b>-f</b> is specified), read from the command
       line (when option <b>-e</b> is specified), or read from the standard input (the default).

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-v</b>     Cause <b>djvused</b> to print a  command  line  prompt  before  reading  commands  and  a  brief  message
              describing  how  each  command  was  executed.   This  option is very useful for debugging djvused
              scripts and also for interactively entering djvused commands on the standard input.

       <b>-f</b> <u>scriptfile</u>
              Cause <b>djvused</b> to read commands from file <u>scriptfile</u>.

       <b>-e</b> <u>command</u>
              Cause <b>djvused</b> to execute the commands specified by the option argument <u>commands</u>.  It is  advisable
              to surround the djvused commands by single quotes in order to prevent unwanted shell expansion.

       <b>-s</b>     Cause  <b>djvused</b>  to save the file <u>djvufile</u> after executing the specified commands.  This is similar
              to executing command <b>save</b> immediately before terminating the program.

       <b>-u</b>     Cause <b>djvused</b> to print hidden  text  and  annotations  as  UTF-8  instead  of  encoding  non-ASCII
              characters  with  octal  escape  sequences  for maximal portability. This option is convenient for
              manually editing or viewing the djvused output.  This option also causes the emission of an  UTF-8
              BOM under Windows.

       <b>-n</b>     Cause  <b>djvused</b>  to  disregard save commands.  This is useful for debugging djvused scripts without
              overwriting files on your disk.

</pre><h4><b>DJVUSED</b> <b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       There are many ways to use program <b>djvused</b>.  The following examples illustrate some common uses  of  this
       program.

   <b>Obtaining</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>page</b>
       Command  <b>size</b>  outputs  the  width  and  height  of the selected pages using a HTML friendly syntax.  For
       instance, the following command prints the size of page <u>3</u> of document <u>myfile.djvu</u>.

          <b>djvused</b> <u>myfile.djvu</u> <b>-e</b> <b>'select</b> <b>3;</b> <b>size'</b>

   <b>Extracting</b> <b>the</b> <b>hidden</b> <b>text</b>
       Command <b>print-pure-txt</b> outputs the text associated  with  a  page  or  a  document.   For  instance,  the
       following  shell  command outputs the text for the entire document.  Lines and pages are delimited by the
       usual control characters.

          <b>djvused</b> <u>myfile.djvu</u> <b>-e</b> <b>'print-pure-txt'</b>

       Command <b>print-txt</b> produces a more extensive output describing the structure and the location of the  text
       components.   The syntax of this output is described later in this man page.  For instance, the following
       shell command outputs extended text information for page <u>3</u> of document <u>myfile.djvu</u>.

          <b>djvused</b> <u>myfile.djvu</u> <b>-e</b> <b>'select</b> <b>3;</b> <b>print-txt'</b>

   <b>Extracting</b> <b>the</b> <b>annotations</b>
       Annotation data can be extracted using command <b>print-ant</b>.  The syntax of the annotation data is described
       later in this man page.  For instance, the following shell command outputs the annotation  data  for  the
       first page of document <b>myfile.djvu</b>.

          <b>djvused</b> <u>myfile.djvu</u> <b>-e</b> <b>'select</b> <b>1;</b> <b>print-ant'</b>

       Command  <b>print-ant</b>  only  prints  the  annotations stored in the selected component file.  Command <b>print-</b>
       <b>merged-ant</b> also retrieves annotations from all the component files referenced by the current page  (using
       INCL chunks) and prints the merged information.

   <b>Dumping/restoring</b> <b>annotations</b> <b>and</b> <b>text</b>
       Three  commands,  <b>output-txt</b>,  <b>output-ant</b>,  and  <b>output-all</b>,  produce djvused scripts.  For instance, the
       following shell command produces  a  djvused  script,  <u>myfile.dsed</u>,  that  recreates  all  the  text  and
       annotation data in document <u>myfile.djvu</u>.

          <b>djvused</b> <u>myfile.djvu</u> <b>-e</b> <b>'output-all'</b> <b>&gt;</b> <u>myfile.dsed</u>

       Script  <u>myfile.dsed</u> is a text file that can be easily edited.  The following shell command then recreates
       the text and annotation information in file <u>myfile.djvu</u>.

          <b>djvused</b> <u>myfile.djvu</u> <b>-f</b> <u>myfile.dsed</u> <b>-s</b>

   <b>Extracting</b> <b>a</b> <b>page</b>
       Both commands <b>save-page</b> and <b>save-page-with</b> create a DjVu file representing the selected component file of
       a document.  The following shell command, for instance, creates a file  <u>p05.djvu</u>  containing  page  <u>5</u>  of
       document <u>myfile.djvu</u>.

          <b>djvused</b> <u>myfile.djvu</u> <b>-e</b> <b>'select</b> <b>5;</b> <b>save-page</b> <u>p05.djvu</u><b>'</b>

       Each  page  of  a  document might import data from another component file using the so-called inclusion (
       INCL ) chunks.  Command <b>save-page</b> then produces a file with unresolved references to imported data.  Such
       a file should then be made part of a multi-page document containing the required data in other  component
       files.   On  the  other  hand,  command <b>save-page-with</b> copies all the imported data into the output file.
       This file is directly usable. Yet collecting several such files into a multi-page document might lead  to
       useless data replication.

   <b>Pre-computing</b> <b>thumbnails</b>
       Commands <b>set-thumbnails</b> constructs thumbnails that can be later displayed by DjVu viewers.  The following
       shell command, for instance, computes thumbnails of size <u>64</u>x<u>64</u> pixels for all pages of file <u>myfile.djvu</u>.

          <b>djvused</b> <u>myfile.djvu</u> <b>-e</b> <b>'set-thumbnails</b> <b>64'</b> <b>-s</b>

</pre><h4><b>DJVUSED</b> <b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       Command  lines  might  contain  zero,  one,  or  more djvused commands and an optional comment.  Multiple
       djvused commands must be separated by a semicolon character ';'.  Comments  are  introduced  by  the  '#'
       character and extend until the end of the command line.

   <b>Selection</b> <b>commands</b>
       Multi-page  DjVu  documents are composed of a number of component files.  Most component files describe a
       specific page of a document.  Some component files contain information shared by several  pages  such  as
       shared image data, shared annotations or thumbnails.  Many djvused commands operate on selected component
       files.   All  component files are initially selected.  The following commands are useful for changing the
       selection.

       <b>n</b>      Print the total number of pages in the document.

       <b>ls</b>     List all component files in the document.  Each line contains an optional page  number,  a  letter
              describing  the  component  file  type,  the  size  of  the  component file, and identifier of the
              component file.  Component file type letters <b>P</b>, <b>I</b>, <b>A</b>, and <b>T</b>  respectively  stand  for  page  data,
              shared  image  data, shared annotation data, and thumbnail data.  Page numbers are only listed for
              component files containing page data.  When it is set, the optional page title (see  command  <b>set-</b>
              <b>page-title</b> below) is displayed after the component file identifier.

       <b>select</b> <b>[</b><u>fileid</u><b>]</b>
              Select  the  component  file identified by argument <u>fileid</u>.  Argument <u>fileid</u> must be either a page
              number or a component file identifier.  The <b>select</b> command selects all component  files  when  the
              argument <u>fileid</u> is omitted.

       <b>select-shared-ant</b>
              Select  a component file containing shared annotations.  Only one such component file is supported
              by the current DjVu software.  This component file usually contains annotations pertaining to  the
              whole  document  as  opposed to specific pages.  An error message is displayed if there is no such
              component file.

       <b>create-shared-ant</b>
              Create and select a component file containing shared annotations.  This command only  selects  the
              shared  annotation component file if such a component file already exists.  Otherwise it creates a
              new shared annotation component file and makes sure that it  is  imported  by  all  pages  in  the
              document.

       <b>showsel</b>
              Shows the currently selected component files with the same format as command <b>ls</b>.

   <b>Text</b> <b>and</b> <b>annotation</b> <b>commands</b>
       <b>print-pure-txt</b>
              Print  the  text  stored  in the hidden text layer of the selected pages.  A similar capability is
              offered  by  program  <b>djvutxt</b>.   Structural  information  is  sometimes  represented  by   control
              characters.   Text  from  different  pages is delimited by form feed characters ("\f").  Lines are
              delimited by newline characters ("\n").  Columns, regions, and paragraphs are sometimes  delimited
              by vertical tab ("\013"), group separators ("\035") and unit separators ("\037") respectively.

       <b>print-txt</b>
              Prints  extensive  hidden text information for the selected pages.  This information describes the
              structure of the text on the document page and locates the structural elements in the page  image.
              The syntax of this output is described later in this man page.

       <b>remove-txt</b>
              Remove  the  hidden  text  information from the selected component files.  For instance, executing
              commands <b>select</b> and <b>remove-txt</b> removes all hidden text information from the DjVu document.

       <b>set-txt</b> <b>[</b><u>djvusedtxtfile</u><b>]</b>
              Insert hidden text information into the selected  pages.   The  optional  argument  <u>djvusedtxtfile</u>
              names  a file containing the hidden text information.  This file must contain data similar to what
              is produced by command <b>print-txt</b>.  When the optional argument is omitted, the  program  reads  the
              hidden text information from the djvused script until reaching an end-of-file or a line containing
              a single period.

       <b>output-txt</b>
              Prints  a  djvused  script  that  reconstructs the hidden text information for the selected pages.
              This script can later be edited and executed by invoking program <b>djvused</b> with option <b>-f</b>.

       <b>print-ant</b>
              Prints the annotations of the selected component file.  The annotation data is represented using a
              simple syntax described later in this document.

       <b>print-merged-ant</b>
              Merge the annotations stored in the selected component files with the  annotations  imported  from
              other  component  files  such  as  the  shared annotation component file..  The annotation data is
              represented using a simple syntax described later in this document.

       <b>remove-ant</b>
              Remove the annotation information from the selected  component  files.   For  instance,  executing
              commands <b>select</b> and <b>remove-ant</b> removes all annotation information from the DjVu document.

       <b>set-ant</b> <b>[</b><u>djvusedantfile</u><b>]</b>
              Insert annotations into the selected component file.  The optional argument <u>djvusedantfile</u> names a
              file  containing  the annotation data.  This file must contain data similar to what is produced by
              command <b>print-ant</b>.  When the optional argument is omitted, the program reads the  annotation  data
              from the djvused script itself until reaching an end-of-file or a line containing a single period.

       <b>output-ant</b>
              Print  a djvused script that reconstructs the annotation information for the selected pages.  This
              script can later be edited and executed by invoking program <b>djvused</b> with option <b>-f</b>.

       <b>print-meta</b>
              Print the metadata part of the annotations for the selected component file.  This command displays
              a subset of the information printed by command <b>print-ant</b> using a different syntax.   metadata  are
              organized as key-value pairs.  Each printed line contains the key name such as <b>author</b>, <b>title</b>,etc.,
              followed  by  a  tab  character  ("\t")  and a double-quoted string representing the UTF-8 encoded
              metadata value.

       <b>remove-meta</b>
              Remove the metadata part of the annotations of the selected component files.

       <b>set-meta</b> <b>[</b><u>djvusedmetafile</u><b>]</b>
              Set the metadata part of the annotations of the selected component file.  The  remaining  part  of
              the  annotations is left unchanged.  The optional argument <u>djvusedmetafile</u> names a file containing
              the metadata.  This file must contain data similar to what  is  produced  by  command  <b>print-meta</b>.
              When  the  optional  argument  is  omitted, the program reads the annotation data from the djvused
              script itself until reaching an end-of-file or a line containing a single period.

       <b>print-xmp</b>
              Print the XMP metadata string contained in the annotation chunk of the  selected  component  file.
              This command displays in fact a subset of the information printed by command <b>print-ant</b>.

       <b>remove-xmp</b>
              Removes the XMP tag from the annotation chunk of the selected component file.

       <b>set-xmp</b> <b>[</b><u>xmpfile</u><b>]</b>
              Set  the  XMP metadata part of the annotations of the selected component file.  The remaining part
              of the annotations is left unchanged.  The optional argument <u>xmpfile</u> names a file  containing  the
              XMP  metadata  in  a  format  similar  to  that  produced by command <b>print-xmp</b>.  When the optional
              argument is omitted, the program reads the XMP annotation data  from  the  djvused  script  itself
              until reaching an end-of-file or a line containing a single period.

       <b>output-all</b>
              Print  a  djvused script that reconstructs both the hidden text and the annotation information for
              the selected pages.  This script can later be edited and executed by invoking program <b>djvused</b> with
              option <b>-f</b>.

   <b>Outline/bookmarks</b> <b>commands</b>
       <b>print-outline</b>
              Print the outline of the document.  Nothing is printed if the document contains no outline.

       <b>remove-outline</b>
              Removes the outline from the document.

       <b>set-outline</b> <b>[</b><u>djvusedoutlinefile</u><b>]</b>
              Insert outline information into the document.  The optional argument  <u>djvusedoutlinefile</u>  names  a
              file  containing the outline information.  This file must contain data similar to what is produced
              by command <b>print-outline</b>.  When the optional argument is omitted, the  program  reads  the  hidden
              text  information  from  the  djvused  script until reaching an end-of-file or a line containing a
              single period.

   <b>Thumbnail</b> <b>commands</b>
       <b>set-thumbnails</b> <u>sz</u>
              Compute thumbnails of size <u>sz</u>x<u>sz</u> pixels and insert them into the document.  DjVu viewers can later
              display these thumbnails very efficiently without  need  to  download  the  data  for  each  page.
              Typical thumbnail size range from 48 to 128 pixels.

       <b>remove-thumbnails</b>
              Remove  the  pre-computed  thumbnails from the DjVu document.  New thumbnails can then be computed
              using command <b>set-thumbnails</b>.

   <b>Save</b> <b>commands</b>
       The above commands only modify the memory image of the DjVu document.   The  following  commands  provide
       means to save the modified data into the file system.

       <b>save</b>   Save  the  modified  DjVu document back into the input file <u>djvufile</u> specified by the arguments of
              the program <b>djvused</b>.  Nothing is done if the DjVu  file  was  not  modified.   Passing  option  <b>-s</b>
              program <b>djvused</b> is equivalent to executing command <b>save</b> before exiting the program.

       <b>save-bundled</b> <u>filename</u>
              Save  the  current  DjVu document as a bundled multi-page DjVu document named <u>filename</u>.  A similar
              capability is offered by program <b>djvmcvt</b>.

       <b>save-indirect</b> <u>filename</u>
              Save the current DjVu document as an indirect multi-page DjVu document.  The  index  file  of  the
              indirect document will be named <b>filename</b>.  All other files composing the indirect document will be
              saved  into  the  same  directory  as  the index file.  A similar capability is offered by program
              <b>djvmcvt</b>.

       <b>save-page</b> <u>filename</u>
              Save the selected component file into DjVu file  <u>filename</u>.   The  selected  component  file  might
              import  data  from  another  component  file  using the so-called inclusion ( INCL ) chunks.  This
              command then produces a file with unresolved references to imported data.  Such a file should then
              be made part of a multi-page document containing the required data in other component files.

       <b>save-page-with</b> <u>filename</u>
              Save the selected component file into DjVu file <u>filename</u>.  All data imported from other  component
              files  is  copied  into the output file as well.  This command always produces a usable DjVu file.
              On the other hand, collecting several such files into a multi-page document might lead to  useless
              data replication.

   <b>Miscellaneous</b> <b>commands</b>
       <b>help</b>   Display a help message listing all commands supported by <b>djvused</b>.

       <b>dump</b>   Display  the  EA  IFF  85  structure of the document or of the selected component file.  A similar
              capability is offered by program <b>djvudump</b>.

       <b>size</b>   Display the width and the height of the selected pages.  The dimensions of each page are displayed
              using a syntax suitable for direct insertion into the &lt;EMBED...&gt;&lt;/EMBED&gt; tags. This  command  also
              displays the default page orientation when it is different from zero.

       <b>set-rotation</b> <b>[+-]</b><u>rot</u>
              Changes the default orientation of the selected pages.  The orientation is expressed as an integer
              in  range  0..3 representing a number of 90 degree counter-clockwise rotations.  When the argument
              is preceded by a sign <b>+</b> or <b>-</b>, argument <u>rot</u> counts how many additional 90 degree  counter-clockwise
              rotations  should  be applied to the page. Otherwise, argument <u>rot</u> represents the desired absolute
              page orientation.  Only DjVu pages can be rotated.  Pages represented as a raw IW44  image  cannot
              be rotated.

       <b>set-dpi</b> <u>dpi</u>
              Sets  the  resolution  of  the  page  image  in  dots  per inche.  Argument <u>dpi</u> should be in range
              25..6000.

       <b>set-page-title</b> <u>title</u>
              Sets a page title for the selected page.  When page titles are available, recent versions  of  the
              DjVuLibre  viewers  display these page titles instead of page numbers and also accept them in page
              selection options.  Command <b>ls</b> can be used to see both the page titles and page  identifiers.   To
              unset a page title, simply make it equal to the page identifier.

</pre><h4><b>DJVUSED</b> <b>FILE</b> <b>FORMATS</b></h4><pre>
       Djvused uses a simple parenthesized syntax to represent both annotations and hidden text.

       *  This  syntax  is  the  native  syntax  used  by  DjVu for storing annotations.  Program <b>djvused</b> simply
          compresses the annotation data using the <b><a href="../man1/bzz.1.html">bzz</a></b>(1) algorithm.

       *  This syntax differs from the native syntax used by DjVu for storing the hidden text.  Program  <b>djvused</b>
          performs  the  translations  between  the  compact  binary  representation used by DjVu and the easily
          modifiable parenthesized syntax.

   <b>General</b> <b>syntax</b>
       Djvused files are ASCII text files.  The legal characters  in  djvused  files  are  the  printable  ASCII
       characters and the space, tab, cr, and nl characters.  Using other characters has undefined results.

       Djvused files are composed of a sequence of expressions separated by blank characters (space, tab, cr, or
       nl).  There are four kind of expressions, namely integers, symbols, strings and lists.

       Integers:
              Integer numbers are represented by one or more digits, with the usual interpretation.

       Symbols:
              Symbols,  or  identifiers,  are  sequences  of printable ascii characters representing a name or a
              keyword.  Acceptable characters are the alpha-numeric characters, the underscore  "_",  the  minus
              character  "-",  and  the  hash  character  "#".   Names  should not begin with a digit or a minus
              character.

       Strings:
              Strings denote an arbitrary sequence of bytes, usually interpreted as a sequence of UTF-8  encoded
              characters.   Strings  in  djvused  files  are  similar  to  strings  in the C language.  They are
              surrounded by double quote characters.  Certain sequences of characters starting with a  backslash
              ("\")  have  a special meaning.  A backslash followed by letter "a", "b", "t", "n", "v", "f", "r",
              "\", and stands for the ascii character <a href="../man007/BEL.007.html">BEL</a>(007), <a href="../man008/BS.008.html">BS</a>(008),  <a href="../man009/HT.009.html">HT</a>(009),  <a href="../man010/LF.010.html">LF</a>(010),  <a href="../man011/VT.011.html">VT</a>(011),  <a href="../man012/FF.012.html">FF</a>(012),
              <a href="../man013/CR.013.html">CR</a>(013),  <a href="../man134/BACKSLASH.134.html">BACKSLASH</a>(134)  and <a href="../man042/DOUBLEQUOTE.042.html">DOUBLEQUOTE</a>(042) respectively.  A backslash followed by one to three
              digits stands for the byte whose octal code is expressed  by  the  digits.   All  other  backslash
              sequences are illegal.  All non printable ascii characters must be escaped.

       Lists: Lists  are  sequence  of  expressions  separated  by  blanks  and  surrounded by parentheses.  All
              expressions types are acceptable within a list, including sub-lists.

   <b>Hidden</b> <b>text</b> <b>syntax</b>
       The building blocks of the hidden text syntax are lists representing each  structural  component  of  the
       hidden text.  Structural components have the following form:

          <b>(</b><u>type</u> <u>xmin</u> <u>ymin</u> <u>xmax</u> <u>ymax</u> <b>...</b> <b>)</b>

       The symbol <u>type</u> must be one of <b>page</b>, <b>column</b>, <b>region</b>, <b>para</b>, <b>line</b>, <b>word</b>, or <b>char</b>, listed here by decreasing
       order  of  importance.   The integers <u>xmin</u>, <u>ymin</u>, <u>xmax</u>, and <u>ymax</u> represent the coordinates of a rectangle
       indicating the position of the structural component in the page.  Coordinates are measured in pixels  and
       have their origin at the bottom left corner of the page.  The remaining expressions in the list either is
       a single string representing the encoded text associated with this structural component, or is a sequence
       of structural components with a lesser type.

       The hidden text for each page is simply represented by a single structural element of type <b>page</b>.  Various
       level  of  structural  information  are  acceptable.   For  instance, the page level component might only
       specify a page level string, or might only provide a list of lines, or might  provide  a  full  hierarchy
       down to the individual characters.

   <b>Outline/Bookmark</b> <b>syntax</b>
       The outline syntax is a single list of the form

          <b>(bookmarks</b> <b>...)</b>

       The  first  element  of the list is symbol <b>bookmarks</b>.  The subsequent elements are lists representing the
       toplevel outline entries.  Each outline entry is represented by a list with the following form:

          <b>(</b><u>title</u> <u>url</u> <b>...</b> <b>)</b>

       The string <u>title</u> is the title of the outline  entry.   The  destination  string  <u>url</u>  can  be  either  an
       arbitrary percent encoded URL, or composed of the hash character ("#") followed by a page name or number,
       or composed of the question mark character ("?")  followed by cgi-style arguments interpreted by the djvu
       viewer.  The remaining expressions in the list describe subentries of this outline entry.

   <b>Annotation</b> <b>syntax</b>
       Annotations  are  represented  by  a  sequence  of  annotation  expressions.   The  following  annotation
       expressions are recognized:

       <b>(background</b> <u>color</u><b>)</b>
              Specify the color of the viewer area surrounding the DjVu image.  Colors are represented with  the
              X11 hexadecimal syntax <b>#RRGGBB</b>.  For instance, <b>#000000</b> is black and <b>#FFFFFF</b> is white.

       <b>(zoom</b> <u>zoomvalue</u><b>)</b>
              Specify  the initial zoom factor of the image.  Argument <u>zoomvalue</u> can be one of <b>stretch</b>, <b>one2one</b>,
              <b>width</b>, <b>page</b>, or composed of the letter <b>d</b> followed by a number in range 1  to  999  representing  a
              zoom factor (such as in <b>d300</b> or <b>d150</b> for instance.)

       <b>(mode</b> <u>modevalue</u><b>)</b>
              Specify  the  initial display mode of the image.  Argument <u>modevalue</u> is one of <b>color</b>, <b>bw</b>, <b>fore</b>, or
              <b>back</b>.

       <b>(align</b> <u>horzalign</u> <u>vertalign</u><b>)</b>
              Specify how the image should be aligned on the viewer surface.  By default the image is located in
              the center.  Argument <u>horzalign</u> can be one of <b>left</b>, <b>center</b>, or <b>right</b>.  Argument <u>vertalign</u>  can  be
              one of <b>top</b>, <b>center</b>, or <b>bottom</b>.

       <b>(maparea</b> <u>url</u> <u>comment</u> <u>area</u> <b>...)</b>
              Define an hyper-link for the specified destination.

              Argument <u>url</u> can have one of the following forms:

                 <u>href</u>
                 <b>(url</b> <u>href</u> <u>target</u><b>)</b>

              where <u>href</u> is a string representing the destination and <u>target</u> is a string representing the target
              frame  for the hyper-link, as defined by the HTML anchor tag &lt;A&gt;.  The destination string <u>href</u> can
              be either an arbitrary percent encoded URL, or composed of the hash character ("#") followed by  a
              page  name  or  number,  or  composed  of the question mark character ("?")  followed by cgi-style
              arguments interpreted by the djvu viewer.  Page numbers may be prefixed with an optional  sign  to
              represent a page displacement.  For instance the strings <b>"#-1"</b> and <b>"#+1"</b> can be used to access the
              previous page and the next page.

              Argument  <u>comment</u>  is a string that might be displayed by the viewer when the user moves the mouse
              over the hyper-link.

              Argument <u>area</u> defines the shape and the location  of  the  hyperlink.   The  following  forms  are
              recognized:

                 <b>(rect</b> <u>xmin</u> <u>ymin</u> <u>width</u> <u>height</u><b>)</b>
                 <b>(oval</b> <u>xmin</u> <u>ymin</u> <u>width</u> <u>height</u><b>)</b>
                 <b>(poly</b> <u>x0</u> <u>y0</u> <u>x1</u> <u>y1</u> <b>...</b> <b>)</b>
                 <b>(text</b> <u>xmin</u> <u>ymin</u> <u>width</u> <u>height</u><b>)</b>
                 <b>(line</b> <u>x0</u> <u>y0</u> <u>x1</u> <u>y1</u><b>)</b>

              All  parameters are numbers representing coordinates.  Coordinates are measured in pixels and have
              their origin at the bottom left corner of the page.

              The remaining expressions in the <b>maparea</b> list represent the  visual  effect  associated  with  the
              hyper-link.

              A  first  set  of options defines how borders are drawn for <b>rect</b>, <b>oval</b>, <b>polygon</b>, or <b>text</b> hyperlink
              areas.

                 <b>(none)</b>
                 <b>(xor)</b>
                 <b>(border</b> <u>color</u><b>)</b>
                 <b>(shadow_in</b> <b>[</b><u>thickness</u><b>])</b>
                 <b>(shadow_out</b> <b>[</b><u>thickness</u><b>])</b>
                 <b>(shadow_ein</b> <b>[</b><u>thickness</u><b>])</b>
                 <b>(shadow_eout</b> <b>[</b><u>thickness</u><b>])</b>

              where parameter <u>color</u> has syntax <b>#RRGGBB</b> as described above, and parameter thickness is an integer
              in range 1 to 32.  The last four border options are  only  supported  for  <b>rect</b>  hyperlink  areas.
              Although  the border mode defaults to <b>(xor)</b>, it is wise to always specify the border mode.  Border
              options do not apply to <b>line</b> areas.

              When a border option is specified, the border becomes visible when the user moves the  mouse  over
              the hyperlink. The border may be made always visible by using the following option:

                 <b>(border_avis)</b>

              The  following  two  options  may  be  used  with <b>rect</b> hyperlink areas.  The complete area will be
              highlighted using the specified color at the specified opacity (0-100, default 50).  Some  viewers
              (e.g., <b>djview4</b>) support opacities in range 0-200 with 200 representing a fully opaque color.

                 <b>(hilite</b> <u>color</u><b>)</b>
                 <b>(opacity</b> <u>op</u><b>)</b>

              This is often used with an empty URL for simply emphasizing a specific segment of an image.

              The  following  three options may be used with line areas to specify an optional ending arrow, the
              line width and color.  The default is a black line with width 1 and without arrow.

                 <b>(arrow)</b>
                 <b>(width</b> <u>w</u><b>)</b>
                 <b>(lineclr</b> <u>color</u><b>)</b>

              Finally the following three options can be used with text areas.  The default background color  is
              transparent.   The  default  text  color  is black.  The <b>pushpin</b> option indicates that the text is
              symbolized by a small pushpin icon.  Clicking the icon reveals the text.

                 <b>(backclr</b> <u>bkcolor</u><b>)</b>
                 <b>(textclr</b> <u>txtcolor</u><b>)</b>
                 <b>(pushpin)</b>

       <b>(metadata</b> <b>...</b> <b>(</b><u>key</u> <u>value</u><b>)</b> <b>...</b> <b>)</b>
              Define metadata entries.  Each entry is identified by a symbol <u>key</u> representing the nature of  the
              meta  data  entry.   The  string <u>value</u> represents the value associated with the corresponding key.
              Two sets of keys are noteworthy: keys borrowed from  the  BibTex  bibliography  system,  and  keys
              borrowed  from  the  PDF DocInfo metadata.  BibTex keys are always expressed in lowercase, such as
              <b>year</b>, <b>booktitle</b>, <b>editor</b>, <b>author</b>, etc..  DocInfo keys start  with  an  uppercase  letter,  such  as
              <b>Title</b>,  <b>Author</b>,  <b>Subject</b>,  <b>Creator</b>,  <b>Produced</b>,  <b>Trapped</b>,  <b>CreationDate</b>,  and  <b>ModDate</b>.  The values
              associated with the last two keys should be dates expressed according to RFC 3339.
