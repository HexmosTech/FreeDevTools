</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       htdig - retrieve HTML documents for ht://Dig search engine

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>htdig</b> <u>[options]</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Htdig retrieves HTML documents using the HTTP protocol and gathers information from these documents which
       can later be used to search these documents. This program can be referred to as the search robot.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-</b>      Get  the  list  of  URLs  to  start  indexing  from standard input. This will override the default
              parameter <u>start_url</u> specified in the config file  and the file supplied to the <u>-m</u> option.

       <b>-a</b>     Use alternate work files. Tells htdig to append <u>.work</u> to database files, causing a second copy  of
              the  database  to  be  built.  This  allows  the  original files to be used by htsearch during the
              indexing run.

       <b>-c</b> <u>configfile</u>
              Use the specified <u>configfile</u> instead of the default.

       <b>-h</b> <u>maxhops</u>
              Restrict the dig to documents that are at most <u>maxhops</u> links away from the starting document. This
              only works if option <u>-i</u> is also given.

       <b>-i</b>     Initial. Do not use any old databases. Old databases will be erased before running the program.

       <b>-m</b> <u>filename</u>
              Minimal run. Only index the URLs given in the file <u>filename</u>, ignoring all others. URLs in the file
              should be formatted one URL per line.

       <b>-s</b>     Print statistics about the dig after completion.

       <b>-t</b>     Create an ASCII version of the document database. This  database  is  easy  to  parse  with  other
              programs so that information can be extracted from it for purposes other than searching. One could
              gather some interesting statistics from this database.
              <b>Fieldname</b>                           <b>Value</b>
                  u       URL
                  t       Title
                  a       State
                          (0 normal, 1 not found, 2 not indexed, 3 obsolete)
                  m       Time of last modification reported by the server
                  s       Document Size in bytes
                  H       Excerpt of the document
                  h       Meta Description
                  l       Time of last retrieval
                  L       Count of links in the document or  of <u>outgoing</u> <u>links</u>
                  b       Number of links to the document, also called
                          <u>incoming</u> links or <u>backlinks</u>
                  c       Hop count of this document
                  g       Signature of this document
                          (used to detect duplicates)
                  e       E-Mail address to use for a notification from <u>htnotify</u>
                  n       Date on which such notification is sent
                  S       Subject of the notifcation message
                  d       The text of Incoming links pointing to this document
                          (e.g. &lt;a href="docURL"&gt;description&lt;/a&gt;)
                  A       Anchors in the document (i.e. &lt;A NAME=...)

       <b>-u</b> <u>username:password</u>
              Tells  htdig  to  send  the supplied username and password with each HTTP request. The credentials
              will be encoded using the <u>´Basic´</u> authentication method. There <b>HAS</b> to be a colon (:)  between  the
              username and password.

       <b>-v</b>     Verbose  mode.  This  increases  the  verbosity of the program. Using more than 2 is probably only
              useful for debugging purposes. The default verbose mode (using only one -v) gives a nice  progress
              report while digging. Please consult the section below on the exact format of the progress report.

       <b>FORMAT</b> <b>OF</b> <b>THE</b> <b>PROGRESS</b> <b>REPORT</b> <b>GIVEN</b> <b>IN</b> <b>VERBOSE</b> <b>MODE</b>
              A  line  is  shown for each URL, with 3 numbers before the URL and some symbols after the URL. The
              first number is the number of documents parsed so far, the second is the DocID for this  document,
              and  the  third  is  the  hop  count  of  the  document  (number of hops from one of the start_url
              documents). Signification of the symbols printed after the url:

              <u>"*"</u> is printed for a link already visited

              <u>"+"</u> is printed for a new link just queued

              <u>"-"</u> is output for a link rejected for any of a number of reasons. To find out what  those  reasons
              are, you need to run htdig with at least 3 <u>-v</u> options, i.e. <u>-vvv</u>.

       If there are no "*", "+" or "-" symbols after the URL, it doesn't mean the document was not parsed or was
       empty, but only that no links to other documents were found within it. With more verbose output, these
       symbols will get interspersed in several lines of debugging output.

       <b>FILES</b>

       <b>/etc/htdig/htdig.conf</b>
              The default configuration file.
