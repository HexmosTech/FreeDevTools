</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       texdoctk - GUI for easier access of TeX package and program documentations

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>texdoctk</b> -[aq]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>texdoctk</b>  is  a  GUI  for  easier  access  to  a  large  part  of  the vast amount of package and program
       documentations and tutorials for TeX and its different derivatives (mainly LaTeX). It  is  optimized  and
       included in the teTeX and fpTeX distributions and also available with TeXLive.

       The documentation is grouped into 17 categories; the 18th button of the main panel is inactive by default
       and intended for use with local additions (see section <b>CONFIGURATION</b> below).

       In  the  settings  window  you  see a checkbox in the html-&gt;ps and text-&gt;ps converter menus for switching
       on/off output redirect. This is due to the fact that some converters do not write  their  output  into  a
       file but to stdout by default, so a redirect is needed, e.g.

       a2ps myfile.txt &gt;myfile.ps

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>-v</u>     verbose:  enable  some viewer messages which are otherwise sent to stderr, as well as some warning
              popup windows. This can also be set in a configuration file.

       <u>-a</u>     autoview: autostart viewer if a listbox contains only one item (this  will  frequently  happen  in
              search results). This can also be set in a configuration file.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       The     configuration     is     controlled     by     the     system    default    configuration    file
       ($TEXMFMAIN)/texdoctk/texdocrc.defaults, most of whose entries can though be overridden by the users' own
       optional <a href="file:~/.texdocrc">~/.texdocrc</a> files and/or command line options.

   <b>The</b> <b>Settings</b> <b>menu</b> <b>and</b> <b>configuration</b> <b>files</b>
       The Settings menu is used to change the user-definable settings of  <b>texdoctk</b>  for  the  duration  of  the
       program  call  or  as new defaults. The latter case is the purpose of the Save button, which generates or
       rewrites the user's own <a href="file:~/.texdocrc">~/.texdocrc</a> file. The system defaults cannot be edited with the Settings menu.

       Paths  The TEXMF-type paths on the system are reported,  and  the  user  can  specify  the  name  of  the
              subdirectory of $HOMETEXMF, where the personal documentation is stored.

       General viewer behaviour

              <u>Suppress</u> <u>error</u> <u>messages</u> toggle verbose mode (see option -v); default is off.

              <u>Autostart</u> <u>viewer</u> <u>for</u> <u>one-item</u> <u>listboxes</u> if a listbox contains only one item (see option -a)

              <u>Use</u>  <u>text</u>  <u>viewer</u>  <u>for</u>  <u>unknown</u>  <u>file</u>  <u>format</u>  i.e.  treat the file as plain text. <b>texdoctk</b> should
              recognize the usual file formats and also relate names like README to plain text,  but  some  docs
              may  have  freely  invented  names. Default is on; if switched off, trying to view such files will
              raise an error. The switch does not influence printing: unrecognized formats cannot be printed.

              <u>Change</u> <u>viewer</u> <u>colours</u> using either RGB triplets in the format #rrggbb or the standardized names.

       DVI/PostScript/PDF/HTML/Plain text
              For text files, <b>texdoctk</b> provides an own viewer. If this viewer is disabled,  but  no  alternative
              viewer is specified, <b>texdoctk</b> tries to read the content of the environment variable $PAGER.

              If  you  want  to  print  the  documentations,  you will need converters to turn non-PS files into
              PostScript. Here are some suggestions:

               dvi-&gt;ps: dvips (is part of teTeX) (<a href="http://www.radicaleye.com/dvips.html">http://www.radicaleye.com/dvips.html</a>)

               pdf-&gt;ps: pdf2ps (<a href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost">http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost</a>) or Acrobat Reader (<a href="http://www.adobe.com">http://www.adobe.com</a>)

               html-&gt;ps: html2ps (<a href="http://user.it.uu.se/~jan/html2ps.html">http://user.it.uu.se/~jan/html2ps.html</a>)

               plain text-&gt;ps: a2ps (<a href="http://www-inf.enst.fr/~demaille/a2ps/">http://www-inf.enst.fr/~demaille/a2ps/</a>)

              The html-&gt;ps and text-&gt;ps converter menus for switching on/off output redirect.  This  is  due  to
              the fact that some converters do not write their output into a file but to stdout by default, so a
              redirect is needed, e.g.  <b>a2ps</b> <b>myfile.txt</b> <b>&gt;myfile.ps</b>

       The system-wide configuration file is ($TEXMFMAIN)/texdoctk/texdocrc.defaults and should only be writable
       by  the  administrator of the installation using any text editor. The optional user configuration file is
       <a href="file:~/.texdocrc">~/.texdocrc</a> and can override all but those system settings which affect the installation as a whole.  The
       preferred way of changing it is through the Settings menu.

   <b>The</b> <b>databases</b>
       <b>texdoctk</b>  comes with a default database file ($TEXMFMAIN)/texdoctk/texdoctk.dat with a special format. It
       is divided into 17 sections corresponding to the 17 buttons that are  active  by  default.  Each  section
       begins with a line

       @<u>section_name</u>

       where  <u>section_name</u>  is  the  text as it appears in the button. This title is followed by the descriptive
       entries for each documentation, which have this format:

       <u>package-label</u>;Short description for listbox (opt. <u>package-name</u>);path in doc directory;optional keywords

       (without breaking the line!). Comments (initiated with a #) and empty lines are ignored by  the  program.
       The  second field is the text displayed in the selection listboxes of <b>texdoctk</b>, and you will usually want
       to mention the name of the package in parens along with it; the first field is a  <b>unique</b>  label  for  the
       package  for  internal use of the program which will usually be chosen identical to the package name, but
       can be different if there is more than one documentation file coming with a package.

       The administrator will probably install additional packages in the local texmf  tree.  The  corresponding
       documentation  can  be made accessible by an additional database $TEXMFLOCAL/texdoctk/texdoctk-local.dat.
       Furthermore, individual users possibly install additional packages in  an  texmf  subdirectory  of  their
       $HOME,  for  which  they  can  make  an  individual  database themselves as $TEXMFHOME/texdoctk/texdoctk-
       pers.dat. After creating such files, texhash must be executed.

       Both types of databases must have the same structure as the system  database,  although  they  need  (and
       should)  not include all its sections if there are no additional entries. For example, if the the package
       <u>foo</u> is added to the local tree such that its documentation  file  is  ($TEXMFLOCAL)/doc/latex/foo/foo.dvi
       and  it  is  decided that it fits best into the existing category Graphics, texdoctk-local.dat would look
       like this:

       @Graphics
       foo;Create bells and whistles (foo);latex/foo/foo.dvi;decoration

       The entry for <u>foo</u> will then be appended to the list of entries in the Graphics category. The 18th  button
       can be activated in the same way, but using a new category name; possible entries at the beginning of the
       database which have not been assigned to a category will be assigned to the default Miscellaneous, making
       the  18th  button active with that label. Note that you cannot have more than 18 categories; if there are
       more, only the one defined last will appear and be used.

       If the documentation is included in the .sty file instead of a proper documentation  file,  the  optional
       keywords  should  start  with  -?- directly after the semicolon, where ? is 0, 1, 2 or 3; these are flags
       which indicate in which part of the .sty the instructions are placed and should help <b>texdoctk</b> to  extract
       the documentation from the style and present it without the code, which would normally be of little use.

       0      no specific place, scattered between the code

       1      at  end, behind \endinput; some .sty files have well-organized documentation behind the end of the
              actual code, where TeX doesn't see it upon compilation

       2      at beginning, terminated by %%%%%%; in  some  other  cases,  some  usage  information  is  at  the
              beginning of the .sty as a comment terminated by a line full of %

       3      as 2, but with a blank line as termination

       See the system database for plenty of examples.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
        $TEXMFMAIN/texdoctk/texdocrc.defaults system-wide configuration file

        <a href="file:~/.texdocrc">~/.texdocrc</a> (optional) personal configuration file; can also be created with the Settings menu

        $TEXMFMAIN/texdoctk/texdoctk.dat default database file for documentation files of the distribution

        $TEXMFLOCAL/texdoctk/texdoctk-local.dat (optional) local database file for documentation files

         $TEXMFHOME/texdoctk/texdoctk-pers.dat  (optional)  personal  database  file  of  individual  users  for
       documentation files

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Widget placement in topic toplevels becomes ugly when the toplevel is stretched or shrunk.

       The font in the frame labels of the Settings menu are not forced to the default font;  this  will  become
       visible e.g. at hi-res screens, where the label font is not scaled up.

       Netscape and Mozilla error output will be written to stderr even if the quiet mode was set.
