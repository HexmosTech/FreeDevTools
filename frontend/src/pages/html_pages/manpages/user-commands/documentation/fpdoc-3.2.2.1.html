</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       fpdoc - The FPC Pascal unit documentation generator.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>fpdoc</b>      --input=inputcommand      [--output=output]      [--format=fmt]      [--descr=descriptionfile]
       [--package=packagename] [options]

</pre><h4><b>Description</b></h4><pre>
       <b>fpdoc</b> scans a Free Pascal unit source file and generates documentation for it.  The documentation can  be
       in  various  formats  (currently  HTML and LaTeX) It can read various description files which contain the
       description for the various symbols found in the unit file.

</pre><h4><b>Usage</b></h4><pre>
       You can invoke <b>fpdoc</b> with as the only required argument the 'input' and 'package' arguments.   It  should
       at  least  contain  the name of the unit file for which documentation should be generated and the name of
       the package to which the unit belongs.

</pre><h4><b>Options</b></h4><pre>
       <b>fpdoc</b> has several options, most of them optional, defaults will be used in most cases.

       <b>--content</b>
              This option tells <b>fpdoc</b> to generate a content file. A content file contains  a  list  of  all  the
              possible  anchors  (labels)  in the generated documentation file, and can be used to create cross-
              links in documentation for different units, using the <b>--import</b> option.

       <b>--cputarget=value</b>
              This option tells <b>fpdoc</b>  for  which  CPU  to  generate  documentation.  This  simply  defines  the
              appropriate CPU macros.

       <b>--descr=descfile</b>
              This  option  specifies  the  name  of  a  description  file  <b>descfile</b>  that  contains  the actual
              documentation for the unit.  This option can be  given  several  times,  for  several  description
              files.

       <b>--descr-dir=dir</b>
              This  option  specifies  the name of a directory with XML description files, named <b>dir</b> This option
              can be given several times, for several description directories.  This  option  is  equivalent  to
              specifying all files in the directory with the --descr option.

       <b>--dont-trim</b>
              This  option  tells  fpdoc  not  to  trim  whitespace in the XML files.  By default, whitespace is
              trimmed from the input, which can have undesirable side-effects in for instance PRE tags.

       <b>--dry-run</b>
              This option tells <b>fpdoc</b> not to generate any output, but just parse all input.  This  can  be  used
              with  the  verbose  option  to  check  what  errors  remain in the documentation, or what is still
              missing.

       <b>--format=fmt</b>
              Specifies the format <b>fmt</b> in which the documentation will be  generated.  Currenly,  the  following
              formats are known:

              <u>chm</u>    CHM with 8.3 conforming filenames, for windows mostly.

              <u>dxml</u>   Delphi compatible XML output.

              <u>htm</u>    HTML with 8.3 conforming filenames.

              <u>html</u>   HTML with long filenames.

              <u>ipf</u>    IPF output (OS/2 format, can be used with docview from fpGUI).

              <u>xhtml</u>  XHTML with long filesnames.

              <u>latex</u>  LaTex, which uses the fpc.sty style used by the Free Pascal documentation.

              <u>man</u>    man page output (unix manual pages, one page per identifier).

              <u>rtf</u>    RTF output.

              <u>txt</u>    Plain text output.

              <u>xml-struct</u>
                     Structured XML.

       <b>--help</b> Show a command-line option summary.

       <b>--hide-protected</b>
              By  default,  the  documentation  will  include  descriptions and listings of protected fields and
              methods in classes or objects. This  option  changes  this  behaviour;  if  it  is  specified,  no
              documentation  will  be  generated  for these methods. Note that public methods or properties that
              refer to these protected method will then have a dangling (i.e. unavailable) link.

       <b>--html-search=link</b>
              Adds an entry for an HTML search page at location <b>link</b> in the headers of the generated HTML pages.
              There is no search page provided, this should be made and provided by the user.

       <b>--import=impfile</b>
              imports a content file <b>impfile</b> from another  documentation  set.  This  can  be  used  to  resolve
              references to elements within this other documentation file;

       <b>--input=cmd</b>
              This  option  tells <b>fpdoc</b> what input file should be used. The argument <b>cmd</b> can be just a filename,
              but can also be a complete compiler command-line with options that concern  the  scanning  of  the
              pascal  source:  defines,  include  files,  syntax options, as they would be specified to the free
              pascal compiler when compiling the file. If a complete command is used, then it should be enclosed
              in single or double quotes, so the shell will not break them in parts.  It is possible to  specify
              multiple  input commands; they will be treated one by one, and documentation will be generated for
              each of them.

       <b>--input-dir=dir</b>
              This option tells <b>fpdoc</b> to add all .pas and .pp files in the directory named <b>cmd</b> as input files to
              the documenter. This is equivalend to specifying all files  in  the  directory  with  the  <b>--input</b>
              command.

       <b>--lang=language</b>
              Sets  the  language  for the output file. This will mainly set the strings used for the headers in
              various parts of the documentation files (by default they're in english). Currently, valid options
              are

              <u>de</u>     German.

              <u>fr</u>     French.

              <u>nl</u>     Dutch.

       <b>--latex-extension=ext</b>
              Sets the extension to use for the LaTeX file to <u>ext</u> the default is <b>.tex</b> (with . (dot) included).

       <b>--latex-highlight</b>
              Switches on an internal latex syntax highlighter. This is not yet implemented. By default,  syntax
              highlighting is provided by the syntax package that comes with fpc.

       <b>--mo-dir=dir</b>
              This  option  tells  <b>fpdoc</b>  where  to  look  for  the  translation  files  that  can  be  used  to
              internationalize  fpdoc's output.

       <b>--ostarget=value</b>
              This option tells <b>fpdoc</b> for which operating system to generate documentation. This simply  defines
              the appropriate operating system macros.

       <b>--output=name</b>
              This  option tells <b>fpdoc</b> where the output file should be generated. How this option is interpreted
              depends on the format that is used. For latex, <b>name</b> is interpreted as the  filename  for  the  tex
              file.  For  all  other formats, <b>name</b> is interpreted as the directory where all documentation files
              will be written. The directory will be created if it does not yet exist. Standard this equals  the
              package name.

       <b>--package=packagename</b>
              Specifies  the  package  name. All units will be documented as part of <u>packagename</u> , which is also
              the default output filename or directory. Only documentation nodes inside a package node with this
              name will be considered when documenting.

       <b>--parse-impl</b>
              (Experimental) try to parse the implementation of  a  unit  too,  this  can  be  used  for  syntax
              checking.

       <b>--project=file</b>
              This  option  tells <b>fpdoc</b> to read all options from a project file. This is an XML file, please see
              the documentation for more information about the format for this file.

       <b>--show-private</b>
              By default, no documentation is generated for private methods or fields.  This option causes <b>fpdoc</b>
              to generate documentation for these methods as well.

       <b>--verbose</b>
              By default, <b>fpdoc</b> is sparse with output. This tells fpdoc to generate some more information  about
              what it is doing.

       <b>--warn-no-node</b>
              If  this option is specified, <b>fpdoc</b> will emit a warning if it does not find a description node for
              an identifier it is documenting.

       <b>--write-project=file</b>
              If this option is specified, <b>fpdoc</b> will write a fpdoc project file (to the  specified  file  name)
              that corresponds to the command-line options given.
