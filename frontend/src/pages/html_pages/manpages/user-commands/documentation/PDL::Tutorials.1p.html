</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       PDL::Tutorials - A guide to PDL's tutorial documentation.

</pre><h4><b>MIGRATION</b></h4><pre>
       These are our migration guides for users familiar with other types of numerical analysis software.

       PDL::MATLAB
            Migration guide for MATLAB users. This page explains the key differences between MATLAB and PDL from
            the point of view of a MATLAB user.

       PDL::Scilab
            Migration guide for Scilab users. This page explains the key differences between Scilab and PDL from
            the point of view of a Scilab user.

</pre><h4><b>FOUNDATION</b></h4><pre>
       PDL::Philosophy
            Why did we write PDL? This document explains some of the history and motivation behind the Perl Data
            Language. It is an attempt to answer the question "Why PDL?".

       PDL::QuickStart
            Quick  introduction  to  PDL  features.  A hands-on guide suitable for complete beginners. This page
            assumes no previous knowledge of Perl or PDL.

       PDL::Indexing
            After you have read the QuickStart guide, you should follow up with this document. This  guide  goes
            more  deeply  into  the concepts of "indexing" and "slicing" and how they form the core of numerical
            analysis with PDL.

</pre><h4><b>INTERMEDIATE</b></h4><pre>
       PDL::Broadcasting
            <b>Broadcasting</b> is one  of  PDL's  most  powerful  features.  If  you  know  MATLAB,  you've  heard  of
            "vectorizing".  Well, <b>broadcasting</b> is like "vectorizing on steroids". It lets you make very fast and
            compact code by avoiding nested loops. All vector-based languages do this, but PDL  generalizes  the
            technique to all sorts of applications.

            This  tutorial  introduces PDL's broadcasting feature, and it shows an example implementing Conway's
            Game of Life in 10 lines and 80 times faster than a classical implementation.

       PDL::BadValues
            Sometimes it is useful to specify that a certain value is "bad" or "missing". Scientific instruments
            some times include portions of invalid data. For example, a CCD camera might produce an  image  with
            over-exposed  pixels.  PDL's  "bad  values"  feature gives you an easy way to deal with this sort of
            imperfect data.

       PDL::Tips
            Tips and suggestions for using PDL. This page is an assorted collection of programming tidbits  that
            some PDL users have found useful. Some of these tips might be of help when you write your programs.

</pre><h4><b>ADVANCED</b></h4><pre>
       PDL::PP
            PDL's  Pre-Processor  is  one  of  PDL's  most powerful features. You write a function definition in
            special markup and the preprocessor generates real C code which can be compiled. With PDL:PP you get
            the full speed of native C code without having to deal with the full complexity of the C language.

       PDL::API
            A simple cookbook explaining how to create ndarray manually, either from Perl  or  from  C/XS  code.
            This  page  covers  the  PDL core routines that comprise the PDL API. If you need to access ndarrays
            from C/XS, this is the document for you.

       PDL::Internals
            Description of the inner workings of the PDL module. Very few people need to see this. This page  is
            mainly  for  PDL developers, or people interested in debugging PDL or changing the internals of PDL.
            If you can read this document and understand all of it, and you additionally understand PDL::PP, you
            will be awarded the title of "PDL Guru".
