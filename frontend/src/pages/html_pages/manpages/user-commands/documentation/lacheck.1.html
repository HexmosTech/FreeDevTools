</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       lacheck - A consistency checker for LaTeX documents.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>lacheck</b> <u>filename</u> [ <u>.tex</u> ]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       LaCheck  is  a  general  purpose  consistency checker for LaTeX documents.  It reads a LaTeX document and
       displays warning messages, if it finds bad sequences. It should  be  noted,  that  the  badness  is  <u>very</u>
       subjective.   LaCheck  is designed to help find common mistakes in LaTeX documents, especially those made
       by beginners.

       The things checked are:

       Mismatched groups (braces), environments and math mode  delimiters.   When  a  mismatch  is  found,  line
       numbers  for  <u>both</u> start and end of the mismatch is given. The error messages comes in pairs, one for the
       end match and one for the beginning, marked with `&lt;-´ and `-&gt;´ respectively.

       Bad spacing including missing a `\ ´ after an abbreviation, missing an `\@´ before a punctuation mark  in
       a  paragraph  that  is  ended  by an capital letter, double spaces like `  ´, bad usage of ellipsis (like
       using ... instead of \ldots, or using \ldots where \cdots should be used), missing   before  a  \cite  or
       \ref  commands,  space  before  footnotes, italic corrections before comma, point, or italic text, italic
       correction after normal text, missing italic correction when switching from italic to  normal  text,  and
       double italic correction.

       Badly  placed  punctuation  marks  around  end of math mode delimiters. This is, punctuation placed right
       after display math end or punctuation placed  right  before  text  math  end.   Sequences  of  whitespace
       followed by punctuation marks are also caught.

       Bad  use  of  quotation  characters,  i.e.  constructs  like "´word" or "word`" are warned about, tabs in
       verbatim environments are caught, certain  TeX  primitives  are  frowned  upon,  attempts  to  give  font
       specifiers arguments such as \em{text} are noted, and use of @ in LaTeX macros are reported.

       LaCheck  will  read files that are input using \input or \include.  Files with suffix `.sty´ are omitted,
       as they probably will cause LaCheck to crash.

       LaCheck may be invoked from within <a href="../man1/Emacs.1.html">Emacs</a>(1) using compile:

       To run: <b>M-x</b> <b>compile</b> <b>RET</b> <b>lacheck</b> <b>RET</b> , and then <b>C-x</b> <b>`</b> to parse the messages

</pre><h4><b>OUTPUT</b></h4><pre>
       The output is UNIX-error like, and may be parsed using <a href="../man1/Emacs.1.html">Emacs</a>(1) compile mode. Here is a sample:

       lacheck compiler
       "/usr/mef/compiler.tex", line 34: missing `\\\\ ´ after "etc."
       "/usr/mef/compiler.tex", line 179: double space at " ~"
       "/usr/mef/compiler.tex", line 186: &lt;- unmatched "}"
       "/usr/mef/compiler.tex", line 181: -&gt; unmatched "$$"

       A control space `\ ´ should be inserted at line 34, to prevent an end-of-sentence space.  Also,  at  line
       179,  the first space of the sequence " ~" should probably be deleted.  The last two lines is an example,
       where the user mistyped, and probably inserted an extra "}" somewhere.

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       Some special cases should be explained. In cases where a sentence ends with something that LaCheck thinks
       is an abbreviation an missing `\ ´ error may  also  occur,  if  the  following  sentence  begins  with  a
       lowercase letter.

       A  mismatch  error  may cause more to follow, due to the chosen algorithm. In such cases just correct the
       <u>first</u> error and run LaCheck again

       Braces, environments and math mode must be balanced within a file.

       LaCheck may be confused by unmatched stuff placed inside verbatim-like environments called something else
       than exactly `verbatim´.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       /usr/bin/lacheck

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       <a href="../man1/tex.1.html">tex</a>(1), <a href="../man1/emacs.1.html">emacs</a>(1), <a href="../man1/latex.1.html">latex</a>(1)

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       LaCheck gets confused by advanced macros, is fooled by simple macros, can't figure out if you use a  non-
       standard  way  to switch italic on or off, does not like TeX at all, does not provide any options to turn
       off specific warnings, and is at best a crude approximation.

       Ideas for improvements and bug reports are very welcome.  Such should be  directed  to  the  maintainers,
