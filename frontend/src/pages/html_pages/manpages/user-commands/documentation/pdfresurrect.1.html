</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       pdfresurrect - tool for extracting versioning data from PDF documents

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>pdfresurrect</b>  file.pdf <u>[-w]</u>[-q]<u>[-i]</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This manual page documents briefly the <b>pdfresurrect</b> command.

       <b>pdfresurrect</b> is a tool for extracting versioning data from PDF documents.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       A summary of options is included below.

       <b>-w</b>     Write the PDF versions and summary to disk.

       <b>-q</b>     Display only the number of versions contained in the PDF.

       <b>-i</b>     Display the creator information from the specified PDF.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       This  tool  relies  on  the  application  reading  the  pdfresurrect extracted versions to treat the last
       xref(cross-reference) table as the most recent in the document.  This should typically be the case.

       The verbose output, which tries to deduce the  PDF  object  type  (e.g.  stream,  page),  is  not  always
       accurate,  and  the  object  counts  might  not  be  100% accurate.  However, this should not prevent the
       extraction of the versions.  This output is merely to provide a hint for the user as  to  what  might  be
       different between the documents.

       Object  counts  might appear off in linearized PDF documents.  That is not truly the case, the reason for
       this is that each version of the PDF consists of the objects that compose the linear portion of  the  PDF
       plus  all of the objects that compose the version in question.  Suppose there is a linearized PDF with 59
       objects in its linear portion, and suppose the PDF has a second version that consists of 21 objects.  The
       total number of objects in "version 2" would be 59 + 21 or 80 objects.
