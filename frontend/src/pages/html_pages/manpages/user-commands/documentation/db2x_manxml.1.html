       db2x_manxml - Make man pages from Man-XML

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>db2x_manxml</b> [<u>options</u>] [<u>xml-document</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>db2x_manxml</b>  converts  a Man-XML document into one or more man pages. They are written in the current di‐
       rectory.

       If <u>xml-document</u> is not given, then the document to convert is read from standard input.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--encoding=</b><u>encoding</u>
              Select the character encoding used for the output files.  The available  encodings  are  those  of
              <b><a href="../man1/iconv.1.html">iconv</a></b>(1).  The default encoding is us-ascii.

              The  XML source may contain characters that are not representable in the encoding that you select;
              in this case the program will bomb out during processing, and you should choose another  encoding.
              (This  is  guaranteed not to happen with any Unicode encoding such as UTF-8, but unfortunately not
              everyone is able to process Unicode texts.)

              If you are using GNU’s version of <b><a href="../man1/iconv.1.html">iconv</a></b>(1), you can affix //TRANSLIT to the end  of  the  encoding
              name  to attempt transliterations of any unconvertible characters in the output.  Beware, however,
              that the really inconvertible characters will be turned into  another  of  those  damned  question
              marks. (Aren’t you sick of this?)

              The  suffix //TRANSLIT applied to a Unicode encoding — in particular, utf-8//TRANSLIT — means that
              the output files are to remain in Unicode, but markup-level character translations using <b>utf8trans</b>
              are still to be done. So in most cases, an English-language  document,  converted  using  <b>--encod‐</b>
              <b>ing=utf-8//TRANSLIT</b> will actually end up as a US-ASCII document, but any untranslatable characters
              will  remain  as  UTF-8  without  any  warning  whatsoever.   (Note: strictly speaking this is not
              “transliteration”.)  This method of conversion is a  compromise  over  strict  <b>--encoding=us-ascii</b>
              processing, which aborts if any untranslatable characters are encountered.

              Note  that  man  pages  and  Texinfo documents in non-ASCII encodings (including UTF-8) may not be
              portable to older (non-internationalized) systems, which is why the default value for this  option
              is us-ascii.

              To  suppress  any  automatic  character mapping or encoding conversion whatsoever, pass the option
              <b>--encoding=utf-8</b>.

       <b>--list-files</b>
              Write a list of all the output files to standard output, in addition to normal processing.

       <b>--output-dir=</b><u>dir</u>
              Specify the directory where the output files are placed.  The default is the current  working  di‐
              rectory.

              This  option is ignored if the output is to be written to standard output (triggered by the option
              <b>--to-stdout</b>).

       <b>--to-stdout</b>
              Write the output to standard output instead of to individual files.

              If this option is used even when there are supposed to be multiple output documents,  then  every‐
              thing  is  concatenated  to  standard output.  But beware that most other programs will not accept
              this concatenated output.

              This option is incompatible with <b>--list-files</b>, obviously.

       <b>--help</b> Show brief usage information and exit.

       <b>--version</b>
              Show version and exit.

       Some man pages may be referenced under two or more names, instead of just one. For example, <b><a href="../man3/strcpy.3.html">strcpy</a></b>(3) and
       <b><a href="../man3/strncpy.3.html">strncpy</a></b>(3) often point to the same man page which describes the two functions together.   Choose  one  of
       the following options to select how such man pages are to be generated:

       <b>--symlinks</b>
              For each of all the alternate names for a man page, erect symbolic links to the file that contains
              the real man page content.

       <b>--solinks</b>
              Generate  stub  pages (using .so roff requests) for the alternate names, pointing them to the real
              man page content.

       <b>--no-links</b>
              Do not make any alternative names available.  The man page can only be referenced under its  prin‐
              cipal name.

       This  program  uses certain other programs for its operation.  If they are not in their default installed
       locations, then use the following options to set their location:

       <b>--utf8trans-program=</b><u>path</u>, <b>--utf8trans-map=</b><u>charmap</u>
              Use the character map <u>charmap</u> with the <b><a href="../man1/utf8trans.1.html">utf8trans</a></b>(1) program, included with docbook2X, found  under
              <u>path</u>.

       <b>--iconv-program=</b><u>path</u>
              The location of the <b><a href="../man1/iconv.1.html">iconv</a></b>(1) program, used for encoding conversions.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       The  man pages produced should be compatible with most troff implementations and other tools that process
       man pages.  Some backwards-compatible <b><a href="../man1/groff.1.html">groff</a></b>(1) extensions are used to make the output look nicer.

       The docbook2X manual (in Texinfo or HTML format) fully describes how to convert DocBook to man pages  and
       Texinfo.

       The input to <b>db2x_manxml</b> is defined by the XML DTD present at <u>dtd/Man-XML</u> in the docbook2X distribution.
