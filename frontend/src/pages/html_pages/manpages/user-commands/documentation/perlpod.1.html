       perlpod - the Plain Old Documentation format

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Pod is a simple-to-use markup language used for writing documentation for Perl, Perl programs, and Perl
       modules.

       Translators are available for converting Pod to various formats like plain text, HTML, man pages, and
       more.

       Pod markup consists of three basic kinds of paragraphs: ordinary, verbatim, and command.

   <b>Ordinary</b> <b>Paragraph</b>
       Most paragraphs in your documentation will be ordinary blocks of text, like this one.  You can simply
       type in your text without any markup whatsoever, and with just a blank line before and after.  When it
       gets formatted, it will undergo minimal formatting, like being rewrapped, probably put into a
       proportionally spaced font, and maybe even justified.

       You can use formatting codes in ordinary paragraphs, for <b>bold</b>, <u>italic</u>, "code-style", hyperlinks, and
       more.  Such codes are explained in the "Formatting Codes" section, below.

   <b>Verbatim</b> <b>Paragraph</b>
       Verbatim paragraphs are usually used for presenting a codeblock or other text which does not require any
       special parsing or formatting, and which shouldn't be wrapped.

       A verbatim paragraph is distinguished by having its first character be a space or a tab.  (And commonly,
       all its lines begin with spaces and/or tabs.)  It should be reproduced exactly, with tabs assumed to be
       on 8-column boundaries.  There are no special formatting codes, so you can't italicize or anything like
       that.  A \ means \, and nothing else.

   <b>Command</b> <b>Paragraph</b>
       A command paragraph is used for special treatment of whole chunks of text, usually as headings or parts
       of lists.

       All command paragraphs (which are typically only one line long) start with "=", followed by an
       identifier, followed by arbitrary text that the command can use however it pleases.  Currently recognized
       commands are

           =pod
           =head1 Heading Text
           =head2 Heading Text
           =head3 Heading Text
           =head4 Heading Text
           =head5 Heading Text
           =head6 Heading Text
           =over indentlevel
           =item stuff
           =back
           =begin format
           =end format
           =for format text...
           =encoding type
           =cut

       To explain them each in detail:

       "=head1 <u>Heading</u> <u>Text</u>"
       "=head2 <u>Heading</u> <u>Text</u>"
       "=head3 <u>Heading</u> <u>Text</u>"
       "=head4 <u>Heading</u> <u>Text</u>"
       "=head5 <u>Heading</u> <u>Text</u>"
       "=head6 <u>Heading</u> <u>Text</u>"
           Head1  through  head6  produce headings, head1 being the highest level.  The text in the rest of this
           paragraph is the content of the heading.  For example:

             =head2 Object Attributes

           The text "Object Attributes" comprises the heading there.  The text in these heading commands can use
           formatting codes, as seen here:

             =head2 Possible Values for C&lt;$/&gt;

           Such commands are explained in the "Formatting Codes" section, below.

           Note that "head5" and "head6" were introduced in 2020 and in Pod::Simple 3.41,  released  in  October
           2020, so they might not be supported on the Pod parser you use.

       "=over <u>indentlevel</u>"
       "=item <u>stuff...</u>"
       "=back"
           Item, over, and back require a little more explanation:  "=over" starts a region specifically for the
           generation  of a list using "=item" commands, or for indenting (groups of) normal paragraphs.  At the
           end of your list, use "=back" to end it.  The <u>indentlevel</u> option to "=over" indicates how far over to
           indent, generally in ems (where one em is the width of an "M" in the document's base font) or roughly
           comparable units; if there is no <u>indentlevel</u> option, it defaults to four.  (And some  formatters  may
           just  ignore  whatever  <u>indentlevel</u>  you  provide.)   In  the  <u>stuff</u> in "=item <u>stuff...</u>", you may use
           formatting codes, as seen here:

             =item Using C&lt;$|&gt; to Control Buffering

           Such commands are explained in the "Formatting Codes" section, below.

           Note also that there are some basic rules to using "=over" ...  "=back" regions:

           •   Don't use "=item"s outside of an "=over" ... "=back" region.

           •   The first thing after the "=over" command should be an "=item", unless there aren't going  to  be
               any items at all in this "=over" ... "=back" region.

           •   Don't put "=head<u>n</u>" commands inside an "=over" ... "=back" region.

           •   And perhaps most importantly, keep the items consistent: either use "=item *" for all of them, to
               produce  bullets;  or  use "=item 1.", "=item 2.", etc., to produce numbered lists; or use "=item
               foo", "=item bar", etc.--namely, things that look nothing like bullets or numbers.  (If you  have
               a  list  that  contains both: 1) things that don't look like bullets nor numbers,  plus 2) things
               that do, you should preface the bullet- or number-like items with "Z&lt;&gt;".  See Z&lt;&gt;  below  for  an
               example.)

               If  you  start with bullets or numbers, stick with them, as formatters use the first "=item" type
               to decide how to format the list.

       "=cut"
           To end a Pod block, use a blank line, then a line beginning with "=cut", and a blank line  after  it.
           This  lets  Perl  (and  the Pod formatter) know that this is where Perl code is resuming.  (The blank
           line before the "=cut" is not technically necessary, but many older Pod processors require it.)

       "=pod"
           The "=pod" command by itself doesn't do much of anything, but it signals to Perl (and Pod formatters)
           that a Pod block starts here.  A Pod block starts with <u>any</u> command paragraph, so a "=pod" command  is
           usually  used  just  when  you  want  to  start  a Pod block with an ordinary paragraph or a verbatim
           paragraph.  For example:

             =item stuff()

             This function does stuff.

             =cut

             sub stuff {
               ...
             }

             =pod

             Remember to check its return value, as in:

               stuff() || die "Couldn't do stuff!";

             =cut

       "=begin <u>formatname</u>"
       "=end <u>formatname</u>"
       "=for <u>formatname</u> <u>text...</u>"
           For, begin, and end will let you have regions of text/code/data that are not generally interpreted as
           normal Pod text, but are passed directly to particular  formatters,  or  are  otherwise  special.   A
           formatter that can use that format will use the region, otherwise it will be completely ignored.

           A  command  "=begin  <u>formatname</u>",  some  paragraphs,  and  a command "=end <u>formatname</u>", mean that the
           text/data in between is meant for formatters that understand the special  format  called  <u>formatname</u>.
           For example,

             =begin html

             &lt;hr&gt; &lt;img src="thang.png"&gt;
             &lt;p&gt; This is a raw HTML paragraph &lt;/p&gt;

             =end html

           The  command "=for <u>formatname</u> <u>text...</u>"  specifies that the remainder of just this paragraph (starting
           right after <u>formatname</u>) is in that special format.

             =for html &lt;hr&gt; &lt;img src="thang.png"&gt;
             &lt;p&gt; This is a raw HTML paragraph &lt;/p&gt;

           This means the same thing as the above "=begin html" ... "=end html" region.

           That is, with "=for", you can have only one paragraph's worth  of  text  (i.e.,  the  text  in  "=foo
           targetname  text..."), but with "=begin targetname" ... "=end targetname", you can have any amount of
           stuff in between.  (Note that there still must be a blank line after the "=begin" command and a blank
           line before the "=end" command.)

           Here are some examples of how to use these:

             =begin html

             &lt;br&gt;Figure 1.&lt;br&gt;&lt;IMG SRC="figure1.png"&gt;&lt;br&gt;

             =end html

             =begin text

               ---------------
               |  foo        |
               |        bar  |
               ---------------

             ^^^^ Figure 1. ^^^^

             =end text

           Some format names that formatters currently are known  to  accept  include  "roff",  "man",  "latex",
           "tex", "text", and "html".  (Some formatters will treat some of these as synonyms.)

           A format name of "comment" is common for just making notes (presumably to yourself) that won't appear
           in any formatted version of the Pod document:

             =for comment
             Make sure that all the available options are documented!

           Some  <u>formatnames</u> will require a leading colon (as in "=for :formatname", or "=begin :formatname" ...
           "=end :formatname"), to signal that the text is not raw data, but instead <u>is</u> Pod text (i.e., possibly
           containing formatting codes) that's just not for normal formatting (e.g., may  not  be  a  normal-use
           paragraph, but might be for formatting as a footnote).

       "=encoding <u>encodingname</u>"
           This  command  is  used for declaring the encoding of a document.  Most users won't need this; but if
           your encoding isn't US-ASCII, then put a "=encoding <u>encodingname</u>" command very early in the  document
           so that pod formatters will know how to decode the document.  For <u>encodingname</u>, use a name recognized
           by  the  Encode::Supported module.  Some pod formatters may try to guess between a Latin-1 or CP-1252
           versus UTF-8 encoding, but they may guess wrong.  It's best  to  be  explicit  if  you  use  anything
           besides strict ASCII.  Examples:

             =encoding latin1

             =encoding utf8

             =encoding koi8-r

             =encoding ShiftJIS

             =encoding big5

           "=encoding" affects the whole document, and must occur only once.

       And  don't forget, all commands but "=encoding" last up until the end of its <u>paragraph</u>, not its line.  So
       in the examples below, you can see that every  command  needs  the  blank  line  after  it,  to  end  its
       paragraph.   (And  some  older Pod translators may require the "=encoding" line to have a following blank
       line as well, even though it should be legal to omit.)

       Some examples of lists include:

         =over

         =item *

         First item

         =item *

         Second item

         =back

         =over

         =item Foo()

         Description of Foo function

         =item Bar()

         Description of Bar function

         =back

   <b>Formatting</b> <b>Codes</b>
       In ordinary paragraphs and in  some  command  paragraphs,  various  formatting  codes  (a.k.a.  "interior
       sequences") can be used:

       "I&lt;text&gt;" -- italic text
           Used for emphasis (""be I&lt;careful!&gt;"") and parameters (""redo I&lt;LABEL&gt;"")

       "B&lt;text&gt;" -- bold text
           Used  for switches (""perl's B&lt;-n&gt; switch""), programs (""some systems provide a B&lt;chfn&gt; for that""),
           emphasis (""be B&lt;careful!&gt;""), and so on (""and that feature is known as B&lt;autovivification&gt;"").

       "C&lt;code&gt;" -- code text
           Renders code in a typewriter font, or gives some other indication that this represents  program  text
           (""C&lt;gmtime($^T)&gt;"") or some other form of computerese (""C&lt;drwxr-xr-x&gt;"").

       "L&lt;name&gt;" -- a hyperlink
           There  are  various  syntaxes,  listed  below.   In the syntaxes given, "text", "name", and "section"
           cannot contain the characters '/' and '|'; and any '&lt;' or '&gt;' should be matched.

           •   "L&lt;name&gt;"

               Link to a Perl manual page (e.g., "L&lt;Net::Ping&gt;").  Note that "name" should not  contain  spaces.
               This syntax is also occasionally used for references to Unix man pages, as in "L&lt;<a href="../man5/crontab.5.html">crontab</a>(5)&gt;".

           •   "L&lt;name/"sec"&gt;" or "L&lt;name/sec&gt;"

               Link to a section in other manual page.  E.g., "L&lt;perlsyn/"For Loops"&gt;"

           •   "L&lt;/"sec"&gt;" or "L&lt;/sec&gt;"

               Link to a section in this manual page.  E.g., "L&lt;/"Object Methods"&gt;"

           A section is started by the named heading or item.  For example, "L&lt;perlvar/$.&gt;" or "L&lt;perlvar/"$."&gt;"
           both  link  to  the  section  started  by  ""=item  $.""  in  perlvar.  And "L&lt;perlsyn/For Loops&gt;" or
           "L&lt;perlsyn/"For Loops"&gt;" both link to the section started by ""=head2 For Loops"" in perlsyn.

           To control what text is used for display, you use ""L&lt;text|...&gt;"", as in:

           •   "L&lt;text|name&gt;"

               Link this text to that manual page.  E.g., "L&lt;Perl Error Messages|perldiag&gt;"

           •   "L&lt;text|name/"sec"&gt;" or "L&lt;text|name/sec&gt;"

               Link this text to that section in that manual  page.   E.g.,  "L&lt;postfix  "if"|perlsyn/"Statement
               Modifiers"&gt;"

           •   "L&lt;text|/"sec"&gt;" or "L&lt;text|/sec&gt;" or "L&lt;text|"sec"&gt;"

               Link  this  text  to  that section in this manual page.  E.g., "L&lt;the various attributes|/"Member
               Data"&gt;"

           Or you can link to a web page:

           •   "L&lt;scheme:...&gt;"

               "L&lt;text|scheme:...&gt;"

               Links  to  an  absolute  URL.   For  example,  "L&lt;<a href="http://www.perl.org/">http://www.perl.org/</a>&gt;"  or  "L&lt;The  Perl   Home
               Page|<a href="http://www.perl.org/">http://www.perl.org/</a>&gt;".

       "E&lt;escape&gt;" -- a character escape
           Very similar to HTML/XML "&amp;<u>foo</u>;" "entity references":

           •   "E&lt;lt&gt;" -- a literal &lt; (less than)

           •   "E&lt;gt&gt;" -- a literal &gt; (greater than)

           •   "E&lt;verbar&gt;" -- a literal | (<u>ver</u>tical <u>bar</u>)

           •   "E&lt;sol&gt;" -- a literal / (<u>sol</u>idus)

               The above four are optional except in other formatting codes, notably "L&lt;...&gt;", and when preceded
               by a capital letter.

           •   "E&lt;htmlname&gt;"

               Some  non-numeric  HTML entity name, such as "E&lt;eacute&gt;", meaning the same thing as "&amp;eacute;" in
               HTML -- i.e., a lowercase e with an acute (/-shaped) accent.

           •   "E&lt;number&gt;"

               The ASCII/Latin-1/Unicode character with that number.  A leading "0x" means that <u>number</u>  is  hex,
               as  in  "E&lt;0x201E&gt;".  A leading "0" means that <u>number</u> is octal, as in "E&lt;075&gt;".  Otherwise <u>number</u>
               is interpreted as being in decimal, as in "E&lt;181&gt;".

               Note that older Pod formatters might not recognize octal or hex numeric escapes,  and  that  many
               formatters  cannot  reliably  render characters above 255.  (Some formatters may even have to use
               compromised renderings of Latin-1/CP-1252 characters, like rendering "E&lt;eacute&gt;" as just a  plain
               "e".)

       "F&lt;filename&gt;" -- used for filenames
           Typically displayed in italics.  Example: ""F&lt;.cshrc&gt;""

       "S&lt;text&gt;" -- text contains non-breaking spaces
           This means that the words in <u>text</u> should not be broken across lines.  Example: "S&lt;$x ? $y : $z&gt;".

       "X&lt;topic name&gt;" -- an index entry
           This  is  ignored by most formatters, but some may use it for building indexes.  It always renders as
           empty-string.  Example: "X&lt;absolutizing relative URLs&gt;"

       "Z&lt;&gt;" -- a null (zero-effect) formatting code
           This is rarely used.  It's one way to get around  using  an  E&lt;...&gt;  code  sometimes.   For  example,
           instead  of  ""NE&lt;lt&gt;3""  (for "N&lt;3") you could write ""NZ&lt;&gt;&lt;3"" (the "Z&lt;&gt;" breaks up the "N" and the
           "&lt;" so they can't be considered the part of a (fictitious) "N&lt;...&gt;" code).

           Another use is to indicate that <u>stuff</u> in "=item Z&lt;&gt;<u>stuff...</u>"  is not to be considered to be a  bullet
           or number.  For example, without the "Z&lt;&gt;", the line

            =item Z&lt;&gt;500 Server error

           could possibly be parsed as an item in a numbered list when it isn't meant to be.

           Still another use is to maintain visual space between "=item" lines.  If you specify

            =item foo

            =item bar

           it will typically get rendered as

            foo
            bar

           That may be what you want, but if what you really want is

            foo

            bar

           you can use "Z&lt;&gt;" to accomplish that

            =item foo

            Z&lt;&gt;

            =item bar

       Most  of  the time, you will need only a single set of angle brackets to delimit the beginning and end of
       formatting codes.  However, sometimes you will want to put a real right  angle  bracket  (a  greater-than
       sign,  '&gt;')  inside  of  a  formatting code.  This is particularly common when using a formatting code to
       provide a different font-type for a snippet of code.  As with all things in Perl, there is more than  one
       way to do it.  One way is to simply escape the closing bracket using an "E" code:

           C&lt;$a E&lt;lt&gt;=E&lt;gt&gt; $b&gt;

       This will produce: ""$a &lt;=&gt; $b""

       A  more  readable,  and  perhaps  more  "plain" way is to use an alternate set of delimiters that doesn't
       require a single "&gt;" to be escaped.  Doubled angle brackets ("&lt;&lt;" and "&gt;&gt;") may be used <u>if</u>  <u>and</u>  <u>only</u>  <u>if</u>
       <u>there</u>  <u>is</u> <u>whitespace</u> <u>right</u> <u>after</u> <u>the</u> <u>opening</u> <u>delimiter</u> <u>and</u> <u>whitespace</u> <u>right</u> <u>before</u> <u>the</u> <u>closing</u> <u>delimiter!</u>
       For example, the following will do the trick:

           C&lt;&lt; $a &lt;=&gt; $b &gt;&gt;

       In fact, you can use as many repeated angle-brackets as you like so long as you have the same  number  of
       them  in  the  opening and closing delimiters, and make sure that whitespace immediately follows the last
       '&lt;' of the opening delimiter, and immediately precedes the first '&gt;'  of  the  closing  delimiter.   (The
       whitespace is ignored.)  So the following will also work:

           C&lt;&lt;&lt; $a &lt;=&gt; $b &gt;&gt;&gt;
           C&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;  $a &lt;=&gt; $b     &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;

       And they all mean exactly the same as this:

           C&lt;$a E&lt;lt&gt;=E&lt;gt&gt; $b&gt;

       The multiple-bracket form does not affect the interpretation of the contents of the formatting code, only
       how it must end.  That means that the examples above are also exactly the same as this:

           C&lt;&lt; $a E&lt;lt&gt;=E&lt;gt&gt; $b &gt;&gt;

       As a further example, this means that if you wanted to put these bits of code in "C" (code) style:

           open(X, "&gt;&gt;thing.dat") || die $!
           $foo-&gt;bar();

       you could do it like so:

           C&lt;&lt;&lt; open(X, "&gt;&gt;thing.dat") || die $! &gt;&gt;&gt;
           C&lt;&lt; $foo-&gt;bar(); &gt;&gt;

       which is presumably easier to read than the old way:

           C&lt;open(X, "E&lt;gt&gt;E&lt;gt&gt;thing.dat") || die $!&gt;
           C&lt;$foo-E&lt;gt&gt;bar();&gt;

       This  is  currently  supported  by  pod2text  (Pod::Text),  pod2man  (Pod::Man), and any other pod2xxx or
       Pod::Xxxx translators that use Pod::Parser 1.093 or later, or Pod::Tree 1.02 or later.

   <b>The</b> <b>Intent</b>
       The intent is simplicity of use, not  power  of  expression.   Paragraphs  look  like  paragraphs  (block
       format),  so  that they stand out visually, and so that I could run them through "fmt" easily to reformat
       them (that's F7 in my version of <b>vi</b>, or Esc Q in my version of <b>emacs</b>).  I wanted the translator to always
       leave the "'" and "`" and """ quotes alone, in verbatim mode, so I could  slurp  in  a  working  program,
       shift it over four spaces, and have it print out, er, verbatim.  And presumably in a monospace font.

       The  Pod format is not necessarily sufficient for writing a book.  Pod is just meant to be an idiot-proof
       common source for nroff, HTML, TeX, and  other  markup  languages,  as  used  for  online  documentation.
       Translators  exist  for  <b>pod2text</b>,  <b>pod2html</b>,  <b>pod2man</b> (that's for <b><a href="../man1/nroff.1.html">nroff</a></b>(1) and <b><a href="../man1/troff.1.html">troff</a></b>(1)), <b>pod2latex</b>, and
       <b>pod2fm</b>.  Various others are available in CPAN.

   <b>Embedding</b> <b>Pods</b> <b>in</b> <b>Perl</b> <b>Modules</b>
       You can embed Pod documentation in your Perl modules and scripts.  Start your documentation with an empty
       line, a "=head1" command at the beginning, and end it with a "=cut" command and an empty line.  The  <b>perl</b>
       executable will ignore the Pod text.  You can place a Pod statement where <b>perl</b> expects the beginning of a
       new  statement,  but  not  within a statement, as that would result in an error.  See any of the supplied
       library modules for examples.

       If you're going to put your Pod at the end of the file, and you're using an "__END__" or  "__DATA__"  cut
       mark, make sure to put an empty line there before the first Pod command.

         __END__

         =head1 NAME

         Time::Local - efficiently compute time from local and GMT time

       Without  that  empty  line before the "=head1", many translators wouldn't have recognized the "=head1" as
       starting a Pod block.

   <b>Hints</b> <b>for</b> <b>Writing</b> <b>Pod</b>
       •

           The <b>podchecker</b> command is provided for checking Pod syntax for errors and warnings.  For example,  it
           checks  for  completely blank lines in Pod blocks and for unknown commands and formatting codes.  You
           should still also pass your document through one or more translators and  proofread  the  result,  or
           print  out the result and proofread that.  Some of the problems found may be bugs in the translators,
           which you may or may not wish to work around.

       •   If you're more familiar with writing in HTML than with writing in Pod,  you  can  try  your  hand  at
           writing  documentation  in  simple HTML, and converting it to Pod with the experimental Pod::HTML2Pod
           module, (available in CPAN), and looking at the resulting code.  The experimental Pod::PXML module in
           CPAN might also be useful.

       •   Many older Pod translators require the lines before every Pod command and  after  every  Pod  command
           (including "=cut"!) to be a blank line.  Having something like this:

            # - - - - - - - - - - - -
            =item $firecracker-&gt;boom()

            This noisily detonates the firecracker object.
            =cut
            sub boom {
            ...

           ...will make such Pod translators completely fail to see the Pod block at all.

           Instead, have it like this:

            # - - - - - - - - - - - -

            =item $firecracker-&gt;boom()

            This noisily detonates the firecracker object.

            =cut

            sub boom {
            ...

       •   Some  older Pod translators require paragraphs (including command paragraphs like "=head2 Functions")
           to be separated by <u>completely</u> empty lines.  If you have an apparently empty line with some spaces  on
           it, this might not count as a separator for those translators, and that could cause odd formatting.

       •   Older  translators  might  add  wording  around  an  L&lt;&gt;  link, so that "L&lt;Foo::Bar&gt;" may become "the
           Foo::Bar manpage", for example.  So you shouldn't write things like "the  L&lt;foo&gt;  documentation",  if
           you  want  the  translated  document  to  read  sensibly.   Instead,  write "the L&lt;Foo::Bar|Foo::Bar&gt;
           documentation" or "L&lt;the Foo::Bar documentation|Foo::Bar&gt;", to control how the link comes out.

       •   Going past the 70th column in a verbatim block might be ungracefully wrapped by some formatters.
