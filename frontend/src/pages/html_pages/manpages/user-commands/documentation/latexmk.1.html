       latexmk - generate LaTeX document

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>latexmk</b> <b>[options]</b> <b>[file</b> <b>...]</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Latexmk</u>  completely  automates  the  process  of  compiling  a LaTeX document.  Essentially, it is like a
       specialized relative of the general <u>make</u> utility, but one which determines dependencies automatically and
       has some other very useful features.  In its basic mode of operation <u>latexmk</u> is given  the  name  of  the
       primary  source  file  for  a  document, and it issues the appropriate sequence of commands to generate a
       .dvi, .ps, .pdf and/or hardcopy version of the document.

       By default <u>latexmk</u> will run the commands necessary to generate a .dvi file, which copies the behavior  of
       earlier versions when only <u>latex</u> was available.

       <u>Latexmk</u>  can  also  be set to run continuously with a suitable previewer.  In that case the <u>latex</u> program
       (or one of its relatives), etc, are rerun whenever one of the source files is modified, and the previewer
       automatically updates the on-screen view of the compiled document.

       <u>Latexmk</u> determines which are the source files by examining the log file.  (Optionally, it  also  examines
       the  list  of  input  and output files generated by the <b>-recorder</b> option of modern versions of <u>latex</u> (and
       <u>pdflatex</u>, <u>xelatex</u>, <u>lualatex</u>).  See the documentation for the <b>-recorder</b> option of  <u>latexmk</u>  below.)   When
       <u>latexmk</u>  is  run, it examines properties of the source files, and if any have been changed since the last
       document generation, <u>latexmk</u> will run the various LaTeX processing programs as necessary.  In particular,
       it will repeat the run of <u>latex</u> (or a related program)) often enough to  resolve  all  cross  references;
       depending on the macro packages used.  With some macro packages and document classes, four, or even more,
       runs  may  be  needed. If necessary, <u>latexmk</u> will also run <u>bibtex</u>, <u>biber</u>, and/or <u>makeindex</u>.  In addition,
       <u>latexmk</u> can be configured to generate other necessary files.  For example, from an updated figure file it
       can automatically generate a file in encapsulated postscript or another suitable format  for  reading  by
       LaTeX.

       <u>Latexmk</u>  has  two  different  previewing  options.   With the simple <b>-pv</b> option, a dvi, postscript or pdf
       previewer is automatically run after generating the dvi, postscript or pdf version of the document.   The
       type of file to view is selected according to configuration settings and command line options.

       The  second  previewing  option  is the powerful <b>-pvc</b> option (mnemonic: "preview continuously").  In this
       case, <u>latexmk</u> runs continuously, regularly monitoring all the source files to see if  any  have  changed.
       Every time a change is detected, <u>latexmk</u> runs all the programs necessary to generate a new version of the
       document.   A good previewer will then automatically update its display.  Thus the user can simply edit a
       file and, when the changes are written to disk, <u>latexmk</u> completely automates the cycle  of  updating  the
       .dvi (and/or the .ps and .pdf) file, and refreshing the previewer's display.  It's not quite WYSIWYG, but
       usefully close.

       For  other  previewers, the user may have to manually make the previewer update its display, which can be
       (e.g., with some versions of <u>xdvi</u> and <u>gsview</u>) as simple as forcing a redraw of its display.

       <u>Latexmk</u> has the ability to print a banner in gray diagonally across each page when making the  postscript
       file.   It  can also, if needed, call an external program to do other postprocessing on generated dvi and
       postscript files.  (See the options <b>-dF</b> and <b>-pF</b>, and the documentation for the <u>$dvi_filter</u> and <u>$ps_filter</u>
       configuration variables.)  These capabilities are leftover  from  older  versions  of  <u>latexmk</u>,  but  <b>are</b>
       <b>currently</b>  <b>non-functional</b>.   More  flexibility  can  be  obtained  in current versions, since the command
       strings for running <u>*latex</u> can now be configured  to  run  multiple  commands.   This  also  extends  the
       possibility of postprocessing generated files.

       <u>Latexmk</u>  is  highly  configurable,  both from the command line and in configuration files, so that it can
       accommodate a wide variety of user needs and system configurations.  Default values are set according  to
       the  operating system, so <u>latexmk</u> often works without special configuration on MS-Windows, cygwin, Linux,
       OS-X, and other UNIX systems.  See the section "Configuration/Initialization (rc) Files",  and  then  the
       later  sections "How to Set Variables in Initialization Files", "Format of Command Specifications", "List
       of Configuration  Variables  Usable  in  Initialization  Files",  "Custom  Dependencies",  and  "Advanced
       Configuration"

       A  very  annoying complication handled very reliably by <u>latexmk</u>, is that LaTeX is a multiple pass system.
       On each run, LaTeX reads in information generated on a previous run, for things  like  cross  referencing
       and  indexing.   In the simplest cases, a second run of LaTeX suffices, and often the log file contains a
       message about the need for another pass.  However, there is a wide variety of add-on  macro  packages  to
       LaTeX, with a variety of behaviors.  The result is to break simple-minded determinations of how many runs
       are  needed  and of which programs.  <u>Latexmk</u> has a highly general and efficient solution to these issues.
       The solution involves retaining between runs information on the source  files,  and  a  symptom  is  that
       <u>latexmk</u>  generates  an extra file (with extension <u>.fdb_latexmk</u>, by default) that contains the source file
       information.

</pre><h4><b>LATEXMK</b> <b>OPTIONS</b> <b>AND</b> <b>ARGUMENTS</b> <b>ON</b> <b>COMMAND</b> <b>LINE</b></h4><pre>
       In general the command line to invoke <u>latexmk</u> has the form

            latexmk [options] [file]

       All options can be introduced by single or double "-"  characters,  e.g.,  "latexmk  -help"  or  "latexmk
       --help".

       <b>Note</b>  <b>1</b>:  In  the  documentation,  '<u>*latex</u>'  means  any  of the supported engines, i.e., currently <u>latex</u>,
       <u>lualatex</u>, <u>pdflatex</u>, <u>xelatex</u>.  Mention of a specific one of these normally refers that  specific  engines.
       Earlier  versions  of  this  documentation  weren't  so  consistent.  Which of these is used to compile a
       document, depends on the configuration and the command line arguments.

       <b>Note</b> <b>2</b>: <b>In</b> <b>addition</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>options</b>  <b>in</b>  <b>the</b>  <b>list</b>  <b>below,</b>  <u>latexmk</u>  recognizes  almost  all  the  options
       recognized  by  the  <u>*latex</u>  programs  in  their current TeXLive and MiKTeX implementations.  Some of the
       options for these programs trigger special action or  behavior  by  <u>latexmk</u>,  in  which  case  they  have
       specific explanations in this document; in this case they may or may not be passed to *latex as well.

       Run  <u>latexmk</u>  with  the  <b>-showextraoptions</b> to get a list of the options that <u>latexmk</u> accepts and that are
       simply passed through to <u>*latex</u>.  See also the explanation  of  the  <b>-showextraoptions</b>  option  for  more
       information.

       <b>Definitions</b> <b>of</b> <b>options</b> <b>and</b> <b>arguments</b>

       <b>file</b>   One  or  more files can be specified.  If no files are specified, <u>latexmk</u> will, by default, run on
              all files in the current working directory with a ".tex" extension.  This behavior can be changed:
              see the description concerning the <u>@default_files</u> variable in the section "List  of  configuration
              variables usable in initialization files".

              If  a  file  is  specified without an extension, then the ".tex" extension is automatically added,
              just as LaTeX does.  Thus, if you specify:

                   latexmk foo

              then <u>latexmk</u> will operate on the file "foo.tex".

              There are certain restrictions on what characters can be in a  filename;  certain  characters  are
              either prohibited or problematic for the <u>latex</u> etc programs.  These characters are: "$", "%", "\",
              "~", the double quote character, and the control characters null, tab, form feed, carriage return,
              line  feed,  and  delete.   In  addition  "&amp;"  is  prohibited  when it is the first character of a
              filename.

              <u>Latexmk</u> gives a fatal error when it detects any of the above characters  in  the  TeX  filename(s)
              specified  on  the  command  line.  <u>However</u> before testing for illegal characters, <u>latexmk</u> removes
              matching pairs of double quotes from a filename.  This matches the  behavior  of  <u>latex</u>  etc,  and
              deals  with  problems that occasionally result from filenames that have been incorrectly quoted on
              the command line.  <u>In</u> <u>addition</u>, under Microsoft Windows, the forward  slash  character  "\"  is  a
              directory  separator,  so  <u>latexmk</u>  replaces  it  by  a  forward  slash "/", which is also a legal
              directory separator in Windows, and is accepted by <u>latex</u> etc.

       <b>-auxdir=FOO</b> or <b>-aux-directory=FOO</b>
              Sets the directory for auxiliary output files of *latex (.aux,  .log  etc).   These  are  all  the
              generated  files,  with  the  exception  of  final  output  files  (.dvi,  .ps, .pdf, .synctex.gz,
              .synctex).  See the <b>-outdir</b>/<b>-output-directory</b> option for directories for the  main  output  files,
              and the <b>-out2dir</b> option for the final output files.

              If  the directory specified for the <b>-aux</b>/<b>-aux-directory</b> option is blank, then the default is used,
              which is to be the same as the output directory.

              If you also use the <b>-cd</b> option, and the specified auxiliary output directory is a  relative  path,
              then the path is interpreted relative to the document directory.

              See the section AUXILIARY AND OUTPUT DIRECTORIES for more details.

       <b>-bibtex</b>
              When  the source file uses bbl files for bibliography, run bibtex or biber as needed to regenerate
              the bbl files.

              This property can also be configured by setting the <u>$bibtex_use</u> variable to 2 in  a  configuration
              file.

       <b>-bibtex-</b>
              Never run bibtex or biber.  Also, always treat .bbl files as precious, i.e., do not delete them in
              a cleanup operation.

              A  common  use for this option is when a document comes from an external source, complete with its
              bbl file(s), and the user does not have the corresponding bib files available.  In this  situation
              use  of  the  <b>-bibtex-</b> option will prevent <u>latexmk</u> from trying to run <u>bibtex</u> or <u>biber</u>, which would
              result in overwriting of the bbl files.

              This property can also be configured by setting the <u>$bibtex_use</u> variable to 0 in  a  configuration
              file.

       <b>-bibtex-cond</b>
              When  the  source  file  uses  a  bbl file for the bibliography and <u>bibtex</u> is used to generate the
              bibliography, run <u>bibtex</u> as needed to regenerate the bbl files only if the  relevant  bib  file(s)
              exist.   Thus  when  the  bib  file(s)  are  not  available,  <u>bibtex</u>  is not run, thereby avoiding
              overwriting of the bbl file.  Also, always treat .bbl files as precious, i.e., do not delete  them
              in a cleanup operation.

              This  is  the default setting.  It can also be configured by setting the <u>$bibtex_use</u> variable to 1
              in a configuration file.

              The reason for using this setting is first to allow automatic switching between the use  and  non-
              use  of  <u>bibtex</u>  depending  on  the  existence or not of a bib file.  In addition, when submitting
              articles to a scientific journal, it is common to submit only .tex and .bbl files  (plus  graphics
              files),  but  not a .bib file.  Hence it is often useful to treat .bbl files as true source files,
              that should be preserved under a clean up operation.

              This property can also be configured by setting the <u>$bibtex_use</u> variable to 1 in  a  configuration
              file.

              <b>Note</b>  that  when  <b>biber</b>  is used, and a bib file doesn't exist, this option does not prevent <u>biber</u>
              from being run, with the bbl file then being incorrect.  See the documentation on <u>$bibtex_use</u>  for
              more details.  However, a bbl file is treated as precious in a clean up operation.

       <b>-bibtex-cond1</b>
              The  same  as  <b>-bibtex-cond</b>  except  that  .bbl  files are only treated as precious if one or more
              bibfiles fails to exist.

              Thus if all the bib files exist, <u>bibtex</u> is run to generate .bbl files as needed, and  then  it  is
              appropriate to delete the bbl files in a cleanup operation since they can be re-generated.

              This property can also be configured by setting the <u>$bibtex_use</u> variable to 1.5 in a configuration
              file.

              <b>Note</b>  that  when  <b>biber</b>  is used, and a bib file doesn't exist, this option does not prevent <u>biber</u>
              from being run, with the bbl file then being incorrect.  See the documentation on <u>$bibtex_use</u>  for
              more details.  However, a bbl file is treated as precious in a clean up operation.

       <b>-bibtexfudge</b> or <b>-bibfudge</b>
              Turn on the change-directory fudge for bibtex.  See documentation of <u>$bibtex_fudge</u> for details.

       <b>-bibtexfudge-</b> or <b>-bibfudge-</b>
              Turn off the change-directory fudge for bibtex.  See documentation of <u>$bibtex_fudge</u> for details.

       <b>-bm</b> <b>&lt;message&gt;</b>
              A  banner message to print diagonally across each page when converting the dvi file to postscript.
              The message must be a single argument on the command line so be careful with  quoting  spaces  and
              such.

              Note that if the <b>-bm</b> option is specified, the <b>-ps</b> option is assumed.

       <b>-bi</b> <b>&lt;intensity&gt;</b>
              How  dark  to  print  the  banner message.  A decimal number between 0 and 1.  0 is black and 1 is
              white.  The default is 0.95, which is OK unless your toner cartridge is getting low.

       <b>-bs</b> <b>&lt;scale&gt;</b>
              A decimal number that specifies how large the banner message will be printed.  Experimentation  is
              necessary  to  get  the right scale for your message, as a rule of thumb the scale should be about
              equal to 1100 divided by the number of characters in the message.  The default is 220.0  which  is
              just right for 5 character messages.

       <b>-commands</b>
              List the commands used by <u>latexmk</u> for processing files, and then exit.

       <b>-c</b>     Clean  up  (remove)  all  regeneratable  files  generated by <u>latex</u> and <u>bibtex</u> or <u>biber</u> except dvi,
              postscript and pdf.  These files are a combination of log files,  aux  files,  <u>latexmk</u>'s  database
              file  of  source  file  information,  and  those  with extensions specified in the <u>@generated_exts</u>
              configuration variable.  In addition,  files  specified  by  the  <u>$clean_ext</u>  and  <u>@generated_exts</u>
              configuration variables are removed.

              This  cleanup  is  instead  of  a  regular  make.   See the <b>-gg</b> option if you want to do a cleanup
              followed by a make.

              <u>Treatment</u> <u>of</u> <u>.bbl</u> <u>files:</u>  If <u>$bibtex_use</u> is set to 0 or 1, bbl files are always  treated  as  non-
              regeneratable.   If  <u>$bibtex_use</u>  is  set  to  1.5,  bbl  files  are  counted as non-regeneratable
              conditionally: If the bib file exists, then bbl files are regeneratable,  and  are  deleted  in  a
              clean  up.  But if <u>$bibtex_use</u> is 1.5 and a bib file doesn't exist, then the bbl files are treated
              as non-regeneratable and hence are not deleted.

              In contrast, if <u>$bibtex_use</u> is set to 2, bbl files are always treated as  regeneratable,  and  are
              deleted in a cleanup.

              <u>Treatment</u>  <u>of</u>  <u>files</u>  <u>generated</u>  <u>by</u>  <u>custom</u> <u>dependencies:</u> If <u>$cleanup_includes_cusdep_generated</u> is
              nonzero, regeneratable files are considered as including those generated  by  custom  dependencies
              and are also deleted.  Otherwise these files are not deleted.

       <b>-C</b>     Clean  up  (remove)  all  regeneratable files generated by <u>latex</u> and <u>bibtex</u> or <u>biber</u>.  This is the
              same as the <b>-c</b> option with the addition of dvi, postscript and pdf files, and those  specified  in
              the <u>$clean_full_ext</u> configuration variable.

              This  cleanup  is  instead  of  a  regular  make.   See the <b>-gg</b> option if you want to do a cleanup
              followed by a make.

              See the <b>-c</b> option for the specification  of  whether  or  not  .bbl  files  are  treated  as  non-
              regeneratable or regeneratable.

              If  <u>$cleanup_includes_cusdep_generated</u> is nonzero, regeneratable files are considered as including
              those generated by custom dependencies and are  also  deleted.   Otherwise  these  files  are  not
              deleted.

       <b>-CA</b>    (Obsolete).  Now equivalent to the <b>-C</b> option.  See that option for details.

       <b>-cd</b>    Change  to  the  directory  containing  the  main  source file before processing it.  Then all the
              generated files (.aux, .log, .dvi, .pdf, etc) will be relative to the source file.

              This option is particularly useful when <u>latexmk</u> is invoked from a GUI configured to invoke <u>latexmk</u>
              with a full pathname for the source file.

              This option works by setting the <b>$do_cd</b> configuration variable to one; you can set  that  variable
              if you want to configure <u>latexmk</u> to have the effect of the <b>-cd</b> option without specifying it on the
              command line.  See the documentation for that variable.

       <b>-cd-</b>   Do NOT change to the directory containing the main source file before processing it.  Then all the
              generated  files  (.aux,  .log,  .dvi, .pdf, etc) will be relative to the current directory rather
              than the source file.

              This is the default behavior and corresponds to the behavior of the <u>*latex</u> programs.  However,  it
              is  not  desirable  behavior  when <u>latexmk</u> is invoked by a GUI configured to invoke <u>latexmk</u> with a
              full pathname for the source file.  See the <b>-cd</b> option.

              This option works by setting the <b>$do_cd</b> configuration variable to zero.  See the documentation for
              that variable for more information.

       <b>-CF</b>    Remove the file containing the database of source file information, before doing the other actions
              requested.

       <b>-d</b>     Set draft mode.  This prints the banner message "DRAFT" across your page when converting  the  dvi
              file  to  postscript.   Size  and intensity can be modified with the <b>-bs</b> and <b>-bi</b> options.  The <b>-bm</b>
              option will override this option as this is really just a short way of specifying:

                   latexmk -bm DRAFT

              Note that if the <b>-d</b> option is specified, the <b>-ps</b> option is assumed.

       <b>-deps</b>  Show a list of dependent files after processing.  This is in the form of a dependency list of  the
              form  used  by  the <u>make</u> program, and it is therefore suitable for use in a Makefile.  It gives an
              overall view of the files without listing intermediate files, as well  as  <u>latexmk</u>  can  determine
              them.

              By  default  the  list  of  dependent files is sent to stdout (i.e., normally to the screen unless
              you've redirected <u>latexmk</u>'s output). But you can set the filename where the list is  sent  by  the
              <b>-deps-out=</b> option.

              See  the  section  "USING  <u>latexmk</u>  WITH <u>make</u>" for an example of how to use a dependency list with
              <u>make</u>.

              Users familiar with GNU <u>automake</u> and <u>gcc</u> will find that the <b>-deps</b> option is very  similar  in  its
              purpose  and results to the <b>-M</b> option to <u>gcc</u>.  (In fact, <u>latexmk</u> also has options <b>-M</b>, <b>-MF</b>, and <b>-MP</b>
              options that behave like those of <u>gcc</u>.)

       <b>-dependents</b>
              Equivalent to <b>-deps</b>.

       <b>-deps-</b> Do not show a list of dependent files after processing.  (This is the default.)

       <b>-dependents-</b>
              Equivalent to <b>-deps-</b>.

       <b>-deps-escape=&lt;string&gt;</b>
              Set the kind of escaping used for spaces in the dependency list.  The possible values are  "none",
              "unix",  "nmake",  corresponding  respectively  to  no  escaping, escaping with a "\" suitable for
              standard Unix make, and escaping with "^", suitable for Microsoft's nmake.

       <b>-deps-out=FILENAME</b>
              Set the filename to which the list of dependent files is written.  If  the  FILENAME  argument  is
              omitted or set to "-", then the output is sent to stdout.

              Use of this option also turns on the output of the list of dependent files after processing.

       <b>-dF</b>    Dvi  file  filtering.   The argument to this option is a filter which will generate a filtered dvi
              file with the extension ".dviF".  All extra processing (e.g. conversion  to  postscript,  preview,
              printing) will then be performed on this filtered dvi file.

              Example usage: To use dviselect to select only the even pages of the dvi file:

                   latexmk -dF "dviselect even" foo.tex

       <b>-diagnostics</b>
              Print  detailed  diagnostics  during a run.  This may help for debugging problems or to understand
              <u>latexmk</u>'s behavior in difficult situations.

       <b>-dir-report</b>
              For each .tex file processed, list the settings for aux and out directories, after they have  been
              normalized  from the settings specified during initialization. See the description of the variable
              <b>$aux_out_dir_report</b> for more details.

       <b>-dir-report-</b>
              Do not report the settings for aux and out directories.  (Default)

       <b>-dir-report-only</b>
              After all initialization is complete, give the settings for the aux and out directories, and  then
              halt.  This option is primarily used for debugging configuration issues.

       <b>-dvi</b>   Generate dvi version of document using latex.  (And turn off any incompatible requests.)

       <b>-dvilua</b>
              Generate  dvi version of document using lualatex instead of latex.  (And turn off any incompatible
              requests.)

       <b>-dvi-</b>  Turn off generation of dvi version of document.  (This may get overridden, if some other  file  is
              made  (e.g.,  a  .ps  file) that is generated from the dvi file, or if no generated file at all is
              requested.)

       <b>-dvilualatex="COMMAND"</b>
              This sets the string specifying the command to run <u>dvi</u> <u>lualatex</u>.  It behaves  like  the  <b>-pdflatex</b>
              option, but sets the variable <u>$dvilualatex</u>.

              <u>Note:</u>  <u>This</u>  <u>option</u>  <u>when</u>  <u>provided</u>  <u>with</u>  <u>the</u> <u>COMMAND</u> <u>argument</u> <u>only</u> <u>sets</u> <u>the</u> <u>command</u> <u>for</u> <u>invoking</u>
              <u>dvilualatex;</u> <u>it</u> <u>does</u> <u>not</u> <u>turn</u> <u>on</u> <u>the</u> <u>use</u> <u>of</u> <u>dvilualatex.</u> <u>That</u> <u>is</u> <u>done</u> <u>by</u> <u>other</u> <u>options</u>  <u>or</u>  <u>in</u>  <u>an</u>
              <u>initialization</u> <u>file.</u>

       <b>-e</b> <b>&lt;code&gt;</b>
              Execute  the  specified  initialization code before processing.  The code is <u>Perl</u> code of the same
              form as is used in <u>latexmk</u>'s initialization files.  For more details, see the information  on  the
              <b>-r</b> option, and the section about "Configuration/initialization (RC) files".  The code is typically
              a sequence of assignment statements separated by semicolons.

              The  code  is  executed  when the <b>-e</b> option is encountered during <u>latexmk</u>'s parsing of its command
              line.  See the <b>-r</b> option for a way of executing initialization code from a file.  An error results
              in <u>latexmk</u> stopping.  Multiple instances of the <b>-r</b> and <b>-e</b>  options  can  be  used,  and  they  are
              executed in the order they appear on the command line.

              Some  care  is needed to deal with proper quoting of special characters in the code on the command
              line.  For example, suppose you want to set the latex command to  use  its  -shell-escape  option,
              then under UNIX/Linux you could use the line

                   latexmk -e '$latex=q/latex %O -shell-escape %S/' file.tex

              Note  that  the  single quotes block normal UNIX/Linux command shells from treating the characters
              inside the quotes as special.  (In this example, the q/.../ construct is a <u>Perl</u>  idiom  equivalent
              to  using  single  quotes.   This  avoids the complications of getting a quote character inside an
              already quoted string in a way that is independent of both the shell and the operating-system.)

              The above command line will NOT work under MS-Windows with cmd.exe or command.com or 4nt.exe.  For
              MS-Windows with these command shells you could use

                   latexmk -e "$latex=q/latex %O -shell-escape %S/" file.tex

              or

                   latexmk -e "$latex='latex %O -shell-escape %S'" file.tex

              The last two examples will NOT work with UNIX/Linux command shells.

              (<u>Note</u>: the above examples show are to show how to use the <b>-e</b> to specify initialization code to  be
              executed.   But  the  particular  effect can be achieved also by the use of the <b>-latex</b> option with
              less problems in dealing with quoting.)

       <b>-emulate-aux-dir</b>
              Emulate the use of an aux directory instead of leaving  it  to  the  *latex  programs  to  do  it.
              (MiKTeX supports -aux-directory, but TeXLive doesn't.)

              See the section AUXILIARY AND OUTPUT DIRECTORIES for more details.

       <b>-emulate-aux-dir-</b>
              Turn  off emulation to implement an aux directory and leave it to the *latex program to handle the
              case that the aux directory is different from the output directory.  Note that if you use TeXLive,
              which doesn't support -aux-directory, latexmk will automatically switch aux_dir emulation on after
              the first run of *latex, because it will find the .log file in the wrong place.

       <b>-f</b>     Force <u>latexmk</u> to continue document processing despite errors.  Normally, when <u>latexmk</u> detects that
              LaTeX or another program has found an error which will not be resolved by further  processing,  no
              further processing is carried out.

              Note:  "Further  processing"  means  the running of other programs or the rerunning of <u>latex</u> (etc)
              that would be done if no errors had occurred.  If instead, or additionally,  you  want  the  <u>latex</u>
              (etc)  program  not  to  pause for user input after an error, you should arrange this by an option
              that is passed to the program, e.g., by <u>latexmk</u>'s option <b>-interaction=nonstopmode</b>  (which  <u>latexmk</u>
              passes to <u>*latex</u>).

       <b>-f-</b>    Turn off the forced processing-past-errors such as is set by the <b>-f</b> option.  This could be used to
              override a setting in a configuration file.

       <b>-g</b>     Force <u>latexmk</u> to process document fully, even under situations where <u>latexmk</u> would normally decide
              that  no changes in the source files have occurred since the previous run.  This option is useful,
              for example, if you change some options and wish to reprocess the files.

       <b>-g-</b>    Turn off <b>-g</b>.

       <b>-gg</b>    "Super go mode" or "clean make": clean out generated files as if <b>-C</b> had been given, and then do  a
              regular make.

       <b>-h</b> or<b>-non-help</b>
              Print help information.

       <b>-hnt</b>   Generate hnt (HINT) version of document using hilatex.  (And turn off any incompatible requests.)

       <b>-jobname=STRING</b>
              Set  the  basename  of output files(s) to STRING, instead of the default, which is the basename of
              the specified TeX file.  (At present, STRING should not contain spaces.)

              This is like the same option for current implementations of the <u>*latex</u>, and the  passing  of  this
              option to these programs is part of <u>latexmk</u>'s implementation of <b>-jobname</b>.

              There  is  one  enhancement,  that  the  STRING  may  contain  the  placeholder '%A'. This will be
              substituted by the basename of the TeX file.  The primary  purpose  is  when  multiple  files  are
              specified  on  the  command  line to <u>latexmk</u>, and you wish to use a jobname with a different file-
              dependent value for each file.  For example, suppose you had .tex files test1.tex  and  test2.tex,
              and you wished to compare the results of compilation by <u>*latex</u> and those with <u>xelatex</u>.  Then under
              a unix-type operating system you could use the command line

                  latexmk -pdf -jobname=%A-pdflatex *.tex
                  latexmk -pdfxe -jobname=%A-xelatex *.tex

              Then  the  .aux, .log, and .pdf files from the use of <u>pdflatex</u> would have basenames test1-pdflatex
              and test2-pdflatex, while from <u>xelatex</u>, the basenames would be test1-xelatex and test2-xelatex.

              Under MS-Windows with cmd.exe, you would need to double the percent  sign,  so  that  the  percent
              character is passed to latexmk rather than being used to substitute an environment variable:

                  latexmk -pdf -jobname=%%A-pdflatex *.tex
                  latexmk -pdfxe -jobname=%%A-xelatex *.tex

       <b>-l</b>     Run  in  landscape  mode,  using  the  landscape mode for the previewers and the dvi to postscript
              converters.  This option is not  normally  needed  nowadays,  since  current  previewers  normally
              determine this information automatically.

       <b>-l-</b>    Turn off <b>-l</b>.

       <b>-latex</b> This sets the generation of dvi files by <u>latex</u>, and turns off the generation of pdf and ps files.

              <u>Note:</u> <u>to</u> <u>set</u> <u>the</u> command <u>used</u> <u>when</u> <u>latex</u> <u>is</u> <u>specified,</u> <u>see</u> <u>the</u> <b>-latex="COMMAND"</b> <u>option.</u>

       <b>-latex="COMMAND"</b>
              This  sets  the  string  specifying the command to run latex, and is typically used to add desired
              options.  Since the string normally contains spaces, it should be quoted, e.g.,

                   latexmk -latex="latex --shell-escape %O %S"  foo.tex

              The specification of the contents of the string are the  same  as  for  the  <u>$latex</u>  configuration
              variable.   Depending  on  your operating system and the command-line shell you are using, you may
              need to change the single quotes to double quotes (or something else).

              <u>Note:</u> <u>This</u> <u>option</u> <u>when</u> <u>provided</u> <u>with</u> <u>the</u> <u>COMMAND</u> <u>argument</u>  <u>only</u>  <u>sets</u>  <u>the</u>  <u>command</u>  <u>for</u>  <u>invoking</u>
              <u>latex;</u> <u>it</u> <u>does</u> <u>not</u> <u>turn</u> <u>on</u> <u>the</u> <u>use</u> <u>of</u> <u>latex.</u> <u>That</u> <u>is</u> <u>done</u> <u>by</u> <u>other</u> <u>options</u> <u>or</u> <u>in</u> <u>an</u> <u>initialization</u>
              <u>file.</u>

              To  set  the  command  for  running <u>pdflatex</u> (rather than the command for <u>latex</u>) see the <b>-pdflatex</b>
              option.

       <b>-logfilewarninglist</b>
              <b>-logfilewarnings</b> After a run of <u>*latex</u>, give a list of  warnings  about  undefined  citations  and
              references (unless silent mode is on).

              See also the <u>$silence_logfile_warnings</u> configuration variable.

       <b>-logfilewarninglist-</b>
              <b>-logfilewarnings-</b>  After a run of <u>*latex</u>, do not give a list of warnings about undefined citations
              and references.  (Default)

              See also the <u>$silence_logfile_warnings</u> configuration variable.

       <b>-lualatex</b>
              Use <u>lualatex</u>.  That is, use <u>lualatex</u> to process the source file(s) to pdf.  The generation of dvi,
              hnt, postscript and xdv files is turned off.

              This option is equivalent to using the following set of options


                   -pdflua -dvi- -ps-
              (<u>Note</u>: Note that the method of implementation of this option, but not its intended effect,  differ
              from some earlier versions of <u>latexmk</u>.)

       <b>-lualatex="COMMAND"</b>
              This  sets  the  string  specifying  the  command  to run <u>lualatex</u>.  It behaves like the <b>-pdflatex</b>
              option, but sets the variable <u>$lualatex</u>.

              <u>Note:</u> <u>This</u> <u>option</u> <u>when</u> <u>provided</u> <u>with</u> <u>the</u> <u>COMMAND</u> <u>argument</u>  <u>only</u>  <u>sets</u>  <u>the</u>  <u>command</u>  <u>for</u>  <u>invoking</u>
              <u>lualatex;</u>  <u>it</u>  <u>does</u>  <u>not</u>  <u>turn</u>  <u>on</u>  <u>the</u>  <u>use</u>  <u>of</u>  <u>lualatex.</u> <u>That</u> <u>is</u> <u>done</u> <u>by</u> <u>other</u> <u>options</u> <u>or</u> <u>in</u> <u>an</u>
              <u>initialization</u> <u>file.</u>

       <b>-M</b>     Show list of dependent files after processing.  This is equivalent to the <b>-deps</b> option.

       <b>-MF</b> <b>file</b>
              If a list of dependents is made, the <b>-MF</b> specifies the file to write it to.

       <b>-MP</b>    If a list of dependents is made, include a phony target for each source  file.   If  you  use  the
              dependents  list  in  a Makefile, the dummy rules work around errors the program <u>make</u> gives if you
              remove header files without updating the Makefile to match.

       <b>-makeindexfudge</b>
              Turn on the change-directory fudge for  makeindex.   See  documentation  of  <u>$makeindex_fudge</u>  for
              details.

       <b>-makeindexfudge-</b>
              Turn  off  the  change-directory  fudge  for makeindex.  See documentation of <u>$makeindex_fudge</u> for
              details.

       <b>$min_sleep_time</b> <b>[0.01]</b>
              This is the minimum nonzero value allowed for <u>$sleep_time</u>.

       <b>-MSWinBackSlash</b>
              This option only has an effect when <u>latexmk</u> is  running  under  MS-Windows.   This  is  that  when
              <u>latexmk</u>  runs  a command under MS-Windows, the Windows standard directory separator "\" is used to
              separate directory components in a file name.  Internally, <u>latexmk</u>  uses  "/"  for  the  directory
              separator character, which is the character used by Unix-like systems.

              This  is  the  default  behavior.  However the default may have been overridden by a configuration
              file (latexmkrc file) which sets <u>$MSWin_back_slash=0</u>.

       <b>-MSWinBackSlash-</b>
              This option only has an effect when <u>latexmk</u> is  running  under  MS-Windows.   This  is  that  when
              <u>latexmk</u>  runs  a  command  under  MS-Windows,  the substitution of "\" for the separator character
              between directory components of a file name is <u>not</u> done. Instead the forward slash  "/"  is  used,
              the same as on Unix-like systems. This is acceptable in most situations under MS-Windows, provided
              that filenames are properly quoted, as <u>latexmk</u> does by default.

              See the documentation for the configuration variable <u>$MSWin_back_slash</u> for more details.

       <b>-new-viewer</b>
              When  in  continuous-preview  mode,  always  start  a  new  viewer to view the generated file.  By
              default, <u>latexmk</u> will, in continuous-preview mode, test for a previously running previewer for the
              same file and not start a new one if a previous previewer is running.  However, its test sometimes
              fails (notably if there is an already-running previewer that is viewing a file of the same name as
              the current file, but in a different directory).  This option turns off the default behavior.

       <b>-new-viewer-</b>
              The inverse of the <b>-new-viewer</b> option.  It puts <u>latexmk</u> in its normal behavior  that  in  preview-
              continuous mode it checks for an already-running previewer.

       <b>-nobibtex</b>
              Never run bibtex or biber.  Equivalent to the <b>-bibtex-</b> option.

       <b>-nobibtexfudge</b> or <b>-nobibfudge</b>
              Turn off the change-directory fudge for bibtex.  See documentation of <u>$bibtex_fudge</u> for details.

       <b>-noemulate-aux-dir</b>
              Turn aux_dir emulation off.  Same as <u>-emulate-aux-dir-</u>.

       <b>-nomakeindexfudge</b>
              Turn  off  the  change-directory  fudge  for makeindex.  See documentation of <u>$makeindex_fudge</u> for
              details.

       <b>-norc</b>  Turn off the automatic reading of initialization (rc) files.

              N.B. Normally the initialization files are read and obeyed, and  then  command  line  options  are
              obeyed  in the order they are encountered.  But <b>-norc</b> is an exception to this rule: it is acted on
              first, no matter where it occurs on the command line.

       <b>-outdir=FOO</b> or <b>-output-directory=FOO</b>

              Sets the directory for the output files of *latex.

              If the aux directory is not set or is the same as the output directory, then all output  files  of
              *latex are sent to the output directory.

              If  the  aux  directory  is  set,  e.g.,  by  the  option  <b>-auxdir</b>, and is not equal to the output
              directory, then only the primary output files (.dvi, .ps, .pdf, .synctex, .synctex.gz) are sent to
              the output directory. Other generated files are sent to the aux directory.

              See the section AUXILIARY AND OUTPUT DIRECTORIES for more details.

       <b>-out2dir=FOO</b>

              (<u>Experimental</u> <u>new</u> <u>feature.</u>)

              Sets the directory for the final output files of a whole round of compilations.

              The use of this directory solves, among other things, the  problem  that  when  multiple  runs  of
              *latex  and  other  programs  are  needed, files like the main pdf file from pdflatex, etc will be
              changed multiple times. A viewer like SumatraPDF that reloads the file whenever it detects changes
              will show a distracting sequence of intermediate states of the pdf  file,  rather  than  just  the
              final  version after all the repeated runs of *latex etc have been done.  Instead, when a distinct
              final-output directory is set, by the <b>-out2dir</b> option or the equivalent <u>$out2_dir</u> variable is set,
              the viewer will only see a changed pdf (etc) file after full sequence of repeated runs  of  *latex
              etc has finished.

              By  default  the  final  output directory is the same as the output directory (as specified by the
              <b>-outdir</b> option or the setting of the variable <u>$out_dir</u> configuration variable).

       <b>-output-format=FORMAT</b>
              This option is one that is allowed for <u>latex</u>, <u>lualatex</u>, and <u>pdflatex</u>. But  it  is  not  passed  to
              these  programs.  Instead <u>latexmk</u> emulates it in a way suitable for the context of <u>latexmk</u> and its
              workflows.

              -If FORMAT is dvi, then dvi output is turned on, and postscript, pdf and  xdv  output  are  turned
              off. This is equivalent to using the options <b>-dvi</b> <b>-ps-</b> <b>-pdf-</b> <b>-xdv-</b>.

              If FORMAT is pdf, then pdf output is turned on, and dvi, postscript and xdv output are turned off.
              This is equivalent to using the options <b>-pdf</b> <b>-ps-</b> <b>-dvi-</b> <b>-xdv-</b>.

              If FORMAT is anything else, <u>latexmk</u> gives an error.

       <b>-p</b>     Print  out  the  document.  By default the file to be printed is the first in the list postscript,
              pdf, dvi that is being made.  But you can use the <b>-print=...</b> option to change the type of file  to
              be printed, and you can configure this in a start up file (by setting the <u>$print_type</u> variable).

              However, printing is enabled by default only under UNIX/Linux systems, where the default is to use
              the  lpr command and only on postscript files.  In general, the correct behavior for printing very
              much depends on your system's software.  In particular, under MS-Windows you  must  have  suitable
              program(s)  available,  and you must have configured the print commands used by <u>latexmk</u>.  This can
              be non-trivial.  See the documentation on the <u>$lpr</u>, <u>$lpr_dvi</u>, and <u>$lpr_pdf</u> configuration variables
              to see how to set the commands for printing.

              This option is incompatible with the <b>-pv</b> and <b>-pvc</b> options, so it turns them off.

       <b>-pdf</b>   Generate pdf version of document using <u>pdflatex</u>.  (And turn off any incompatible requests.)

              (If you wish to use <u>lualatex</u> or <u>xelatex</u>, you can use whichever of  the  options  <b>-pdflua</b>,  <b>-pdfxe</b>,
              <b>-lualatex</b>  or  <b>-xelatex</b>  applies.)  To configure <u>latexmk</u> to have such behavior by default, see the
              section on "Configuration/initialization (rc) files".

       <b>-pdfdvi</b>
              Generate dvi file and then pdf version of document from the dvi file,  by  default  using  dvipdf.
              (And turn off any incompatible requests.)

              The  program  used  to compile the document to dvi is <u>latex</u> by default, but this can be changed to
              <u>dvilulatex</u> by the use of the <b>-dvilua</b> option or by setting <u>$dvi_mode</u> to 2.

       <b>-pdflua</b>
              Generate pdf version of document using <u>lualatex</u>.  (And turn off any incompatible requests.)

       <b>-pdfps</b> Generate dvi file, ps file from the dvi file,  and then pdf file from the ps file.  (And turn  off
              any incompatible requests.)

              The  program  used  to compile the document to dvi is <u>latex</u> by default, but this can be changed to
              <u>dvilulatex</u> by the use of the <b>-dvilua</b> option or by setting <u>$dvi_mode</u> to 2.

       <b>-pdfxe</b> Generate pdf version of document using <u>xelatex</u>.  (And turn off any incompatible requests.)

              Note that to optimize processing time, <u>latexmk</u> uses <u>xelatex</u> to generate an .xdv file rather than a
              pdf file directly.  Only after possibly multiple runs to generate a  fully  up-to-date  .xdv  file
              does <u>latexmk</u> then call <u>xdvipdfmx</u> to generate the final .pdf file.

              (<u>Note:</u>  The  reason why <u>latexmk</u> arranges for <u>xelatex</u> to make an .xdv file instead of the <u>xelatex</u>'s
              default of a .pdf file is as follows: When the document includes large graphics files,  especially
              .png  files,  the production of a .pdf file can be quite time consuming, even when the creation of
              the .xdv file by <u>xelatex</u> is fast.  So the  use  of  the  intermediate  .xdv  file  can  result  in
              substantial gains in procesing time, since the .pdf file is produced once rather than on every run
              of <u>xelatex</u>.)

       <b>-pdf-</b>  Turn  off  generation  of  pdf  version of document.  (This can be used to override a setting in a
              configuration file.  It may get overridden if some other option requires the generation of  a  pdf
              file.)

              If after all options have been processed, pdf generation is still turned off, then generation of a
              dvi  file  will  be turned on, and then the program used to compiled a document will be <u>latex</u> (or,
              more precisely, whatever program is configured to be used in the <u>$latex</u> configuration variable).

       <b>-pdflatex</b>
              Set the generation of pdf files by <u>pdflatex</u>.  (And turn off any incompatible requests.)

              <u>Note:</u> <u>to</u> <u>set</u> <u>the</u> command <u>used</u> <u>when</u> <u>pdflatex</u> <u>is</u> <u>specified,</u> <u>see</u> <u>the</u> <b>-pdflatex="COMMAND"</b> <u>option.</u>

       <b>-pdflatex="COMMAND"</b>
              This sets the string specifying the command to run <u>pdflatex</u>, and is typically used to add  desired
              options.  Since the string normally contains spaces, it should be quoted, e.g.,

                   latexmk -pdf -pdflatex="pdflatex --shell-escape %O %S"  foo.tex

              The  specification  of  the contents of the string are the same as for the <u>$pdflatex</u> configuration
              variable.  (The option <b>-pdflatex</b>  in  fact  sets  the  variable  <u>$pdflatex</u>.)   Depending  on  your
              operating  system  and  the  command-line  shell  you are using, you may need to change the single
              quotes to double quotes (or something else).

              <u>Note:</u> <u>This</u> <u>option</u> <u>when</u> <u>provided</u> <u>with</u> <u>the</u> <u>COMMAND</u> <u>argument</u>  <u>only</u>  <u>sets</u>  <u>the</u>  <u>command</u>  <u>for</u>  <u>invoking</u>
              <u>pdflatex;</u>  <u>it</u>  <u>does</u>  <u>not</u>  <u>turn</u>  <u>on</u>  <u>the</u>  <u>use</u>  <u>of</u>  <u>pdflatex.</u> <u>That</u> <u>is</u> <u>done</u> <u>by</u> <u>other</u> <u>options</u> <u>or</u> <u>in</u> <u>an</u>
              <u>initialization</u> <u>file.</u>

              To set the command for running <u>latex</u> (rather than the command for <u>pdflatex</u>) see the <b>-latex</b> option.

       <b>-pdflualatex="COMMAND"</b>
              Equivalent to <b>-lualatex="COMMAND"</b>.

       <b>-pdfxelatex="COMMAND"</b>
              Equivalent to <b>-xelatex="COMMAND"</b>.

       <b>-pretex=CODE</b>

              Given that CODE is some TeX code, this options sets that code  to  be  executed  before  inputting
              source  file.   This  only  works  if  the  command  for  invoking the relevant <u>*latex</u> is suitably
              configured.  See the documentation of the variable <u>$pre_tex_code</u>, and the substitution strings  %P
              and %U for more details.  This option works by setting the variable <u>$pre_tex_code</u>.

              See also the <b>-usepretex</b> option.

              An example:

                  latexmk -pretex='\AtBeginDocument{Message\par}' -usepretex foo.tex

              But this is better written

                  latexmk -usepretex='\AtBeginDocument{Message\par}' foo.tex

              If you already have a suitable command configured, you only need

                  latexmk -pretex='\AtBeginDocument{Message\par}' foo.tex

       <b>-print=dvi</b>, <b>-print=ps</b>, <b>-print=pdf</b>, <b>-print=auto,</b>
              Define  which  kind of file is printed.  This option also ensures that the requisite file is made,
              and turns on printing.

              The (default) case <b>-print=auto</b> determines the kind of print file automatically  from  the  set  of
              files  that  is being made.  The first in the list postscript, pdf, dvi that is among the files to
              be made is the one used for print out.

       <b>-ps</b>    Generate postscript version of document.  (And turn off any incompatible requests.)

       <b>-ps-</b>   Turn off generation of postscript version of document.  This can be used to override a setting  in
              a  configuration  file.   (It  may  get overridden by some other option that requires a postscript
              file, for example a request for printing.)

       <b>-pF</b>    Postscript file filtering.  The argument to this option is a filter which will generate a filtered
              postscript file with the extension ".psF".  All extra processing  (e.g.  preview,  printing)  will
              then be performed on this filtered postscript file.

              Example of usage: Use psnup to print two pages on the one page:

                   latexmk -ps -pF 'psnup -2' foo.tex

              or

                   latexmk -ps -pF "psnup -2" foo.tex

              Whether  to  use  single  or  double  quotes  round  the  "psnup  -2"  will depend on your command
              interpreter, as used by the particular version of perl and the operating system on your computer.

       <b>-pv</b>    Run file previewer.  If the <b>-view</b> option is used,  that  will  select  the  kind  of  file  to  be
              previewed  (.pdf, .ps or .dvi).  Otherwise the viewer views the "highest" kind of output file that
              is made, with the ordering being .pdf, .ps, .dvi (high to low).  This option is incompatible  with
              the <b>-p</b> and <b>-pvc</b> options, so it turns them off.

       <b>-pv-</b>   Turn off <b>-pv</b>.

       <b>-pvc</b>   Run  a file previewer and continually update the .dvi, .ps, and/or .pdf files whenever changes are
              made to source files (see the Description above).  Which of these files is generated and which  is
              viewed  is  governed  by  the  other options, and is the same as for the <b>-pv</b> option.  The preview-
              continuous option <b>-pvc</b> can only work with one file.  So  in  this  case  you  will  normally  only
              specify one filename on the command line.  It is also incompatible with the <b>-p</b> and <b>-pv</b> options, so
              it turns these options off.

              The  <b>-pvc</b>  option also turns off force mode (<b>-f</b>), as is normally best for continuous preview mode.
              If you really want force mode, use the options in the order <b>-pvc</b> <b>-f</b>.

              With a good previewer the display will be automatically updated.  (Under <u>some</u> <u>but</u> <u>not</u> <u>all</u> versions
              of UNIX/Linux "gv -watch" does this for postscript files; this  can  be  set  by  a  configuration
              variable.   This  would  also  work  for pdf files except for an apparent bug in gv that causes an
              error when the newly updated pdf file is read.)  Many other previewers will need a manual update.

              <b>Important</b> <b>note</b>: the acroread program on MS-Windows locks the pdf file, and prevents  new  versions
              being  written,  so it is a bad idea to use acroread to view pdf files in preview-continuous mode.
              It is better to use a different viewer: <u>SumatraPDF</u> and <u>gsview</u> are good possibilities.

              There are some other methods for arranging an update, notably useful for many versions of <u>xdvi</u> and
              <u>xpdf</u>.  These are best set in <u>latexmk</u>'s configuration; see below.

              Note that if <u>latexmk</u> dies or is stopped by the user, the "forked" previewer will continue to  run.
              Successive  invocations  with  the  <b>-pvc</b>  option  will  not  fork new previewers, but <u>latexmk</u> will
              normally use the existing previewer.  (At least this will happen when <u>latexmk</u> is running under  an
              operating system where it knows how to determine whether an existing previewer is running.)

       <b>-pvc-</b>  Turn off <b>-pvc</b>.

       <b>-pvctimeout</b>
              Do  timeout in pvc mode after period of inactivity, which is 30 min. by default.  Inactivity means
              a period when <u>latexmk</u> has detected no file changes and  hence  has  not  taken  any  actions  like
              compiling the document.

       <b>-pvctimeout-</b>
              Don't do timeout in pvc mode after inactivity.

       <b>-pvctimeoutmins=&lt;time&gt;</b>
              Set period of inactivity in <u>minutes</u> for pvc timeout.

       <b>-quiet</b> Same as -silent

       <b>-r</b> <b>&lt;rcfile&gt;</b>
              Read the specified initialization file ("RC file") before processing.

              Be  careful  about  the  ordering:  (1)  Standard initialization files -- see the section below on
              "Configuration/initialization (RC) files" -- are read first.  (2) Then the options on the  command
              line  are  acted on in the order they are given.  Therefore if an initialization file is specified
              by the <b>-r</b> option, it is read during this second step.  Thus an initialization file specified  with
              the  <b>-r</b>  option  can  override  both  the  standard  initialization files and <u>previously</u> specified
              options.  But all of these can be overridden by <u>later</u> options.

              The contents of the RC file just comprise a  piece  of  code  in  the  <u>Perl</u>  programming  language
              (typically  a  sequence  of  assignment  statements);  they  are  executed  when  the <b>-r</b> option is
              encountered during <u>latexmk</u>'s parsing of its command line.  See the <b>-e</b> option for a way  of  giving
              initialization  code  directly  on  <u>latexmk</u>'s command line.  An error results in <u>latexmk</u> stopping.
              Multiple instances of the <b>-r</b> and <b>-e</b> options can be used, and they are executed in the  order  they
              appear on the command line.

       <b>-rc-report</b>
              After initialization, give a list of the RC files read. (Default)

       <b>-rc-report-</b>
              After initialization, do not give a list of the RC files read.

       <b>-recorder</b>
              Give  the -recorder option with <u>*latex</u>.  In (most) modern versions of these programs, this results
              in a file of extension <u>.fls</u> containing a list of the files  that  these  programs  have  read  and
              written.   <u>Latexmk</u>  will then use this file to improve its detection of source files and generated
              files after a run of <u>*latex</u>.  This is the default setting of  <u>latexmk</u>,  unless  overridden  in  an
              initialization file.

              For further information, see the documentation for the <u>$recorder</u> configuration variable.

       <b>-recorder-</b>
              Do not supply the -recorder option with <u>*latex</u>.

       <b>-rules</b> Show a list of <u>latemk</u>'s rules and dependencies after processing.

       <b>-rules-</b>
              Do not show a list of <u>latexmk</u>'s rules and dependencies after processing.  (This is the default.)

       <b>-showextraoptions</b>
              Show  the  list of extra <u>*latex</u> options that <u>latexmk</u> recognizes, but that it simply passes through
              to the programs <u>*latex</u>  when they are run.  These options are (currently) a combination  of  those
              allowed  by  the  TeXLive and MiKTeX implementations.  (If a particular option is given to <u>latexmk</u>
              but is not handled by the particular implementation of <u>*latex</u> that is  being  used,  that  program
              will probably give a warning or an error.)  These options are very numerous, but are not listed in
              this documentation because they have no effect on <u>latexmk</u>'s actions.

              There  are a few options (e.g., <b>-includedirectory=dir</b>, <b>-initialize</b>, <b>-ini</b>) that are not recognized,
              either because they don't fit with <u>latexmk</u>'s intended operations, or  because  they  need  special
              processing by <u>latexmk</u> that isn't implemented (at least, not yet).

              There are certain options for <u>*latex</u> (e.g., <b>-recorder</b>) that trigger special actions or behavior by
              <u>latexmk</u> itself. Depending on the action, they may also be passed in some form to the called <u>*latex</u>
              program,  and/or  may  affect  other  programs  as  well.   These  options do have entries in this
              documentation.   Among  these   options   are:   <b>-jobname=STRING</b>,   <b>-aux-directory=dir</b>,   <b>-output-</b>
              <b>directory=DIR</b>, <b>-quiet</b>, and <b>-recorder</b>.

              There are also options that are accepted by <u>*latex</u>, but instead trigger actions purely by <u>latexmk</u>:
              <b>-help</b>, <b>-version</b>.

       <b>-silent</b>
              Run  commands  silently,  i.e., with options that reduce the amount of diagnostics generated.  For
              example, with the default settings, the command "latex -interaction=batchmode" is used for  <u>latex</u>,
              and similarly for its friends.

              See also the <b>-logfilewarninglist</b> and <b>-logfilewarninglist-</b> options.

              Also reduce the number of informational messages that <u>latexmk</u> itself generates.

              To  change  the options used to make the commands run silently, you need to configure <u>latexmk</u> with
              changed values of its configuration variables,  the  relevant  ones  being  <u>$bibtex_silent_switch</u>,
              <u>$biber_silent_switch</u>,   <u>$dvipdf_silent_switch</u>,  <u>$dvips_silent_switch</u>,  <u>$dvilualatex_silent_switch</u>,
              <u>$latex_silent_switch</u>, <u>$lualatex_silent_switch</u>  <u>$makeindex_silent_switch</u>,  <u>$pdflatex_silent_switch</u>,
              and <u>$xelatex_silent_switch</u>

       <b>-stdtexcmds</b>
              Sets  the  commands for <u>latex</u>, etc, so that they are the standard ones. This is useful to override
              special configurations.

              The result is that <u>$latex</u> <u>=</u> <u>'latex</u> <u>%O</u> <u>%S'</u>, and similarly for <u>$pdflatex</u>, <u>$lualatex</u>,  and  <u>$xelatex</u>.
              (The  option  <b>-no-pdf</b>  needed for <u>$xelatex</u> is provided automatically, given that %O appears in the
              definition.)

       <b>-time</b>  Show time used.  (On MS Windows, what is shown is clock time; on other  systems  CPU  time.)   See
              also the configuration variable <u>$show_time</u>.

       <b>-time-</b> Do not show time used.  See also the configuration variable <u>$show_time</u>.

       <b>-use-make</b>
              When  after  a  run  of  <u>*latex</u>, there are warnings about missing files (e.g., as requested by the
              LaTeX \input, \include, and \includgraphics commands), <u>latexmk</u> tries to  make  them  by  a  custom
              dependency.  If no relevant custom dependency with an appropriate source file is found, and if the
              <b>-use-make</b> option is set, then as a last resort <u>latexmk</u> will try to use the <u>make</u> program to try  to
              make the missing files.

              Note  that  the filename may be specified without an extension, e.g., by \includegraphics{drawing}
              in a LaTeX file.  In that case, <u>latexmk</u> will try making drawing.ext with ext set in  turn  to  the
              possible extensions that are relevant for <u>latex</u> (or as appropriate <u>pdflatex</u>, <u>lualatex</u>, <u>xelatex</u>).

              See also the documentation for the <u>$use_make_for_missing_files</u> configuration variable.

       <b>-use-make-</b>
              Do not use the make program to try to make missing files.  (Default.)

       <b>-usepretex</b>
              Sets  the  command lines for <u>latex</u>, etc, so that they use the code that is defined by the variable
              <u>$pre_tex_code</u> or that is set by the option <b>-pretex=CODE</b> to execute the specified TeX  code  before
              the source file is read.  This option overrides any previous definition of the command lines.

              The  result  is that <u>$latex</u> <u>=</u> <u>'latex</u> <u>%O</u> <u>%P'</u>, and similarly for <u>$pdflatex</u>, <u>$lualatex</u>, and <u>$xelatex</u>.
              (The option <b>-no-pdf</b> needed for <u>$xelatex</u> is provided automatically, given that %O  appears  in  the
              definition.)

       <b>-usepretex=CODE</b>
              Equivalent to <b>-pretex=CODE</b> <b>-usepretex</b>.  Example

                latexmk -usepretex='\AtBeginDocument{Message\par}' foo.tex

       <b>-v</b> or <b>-version</b>
              Print version number of <u>latexmk</u>.

       <b>-verbose</b>
              Opposite of <b>-silent</b>.  This is the default setting.

       <b>-view=default</b>, <b>-view=dvi</b>, <b>-view=hnt</b>, <b>-view=ps</b>, <b>-view=pdf</b>, <b>-view=none</b>
              Set  the  kind of file used when previewing is requested (e.g., by the <b>-pv</b> or <b>-pvc</b> switches).  The
              default is to view the "highest" kind of requested file (in the low-to-high order .dvi, .hnt, .ps,
              .pdf).

              Note the possibility <b>-view=none</b> where no viewer is opened at all.  One example of  is  use  is  in
              conjunction with the <b>-pvc</b> option, when you want <u>latexmk</u> to do a compilation automatically whenever
              source file(s) change, but do not want a previewer to be opened.

       <b>-Werror</b>
              This causes <u>latexmk</u> to return a non-zero status code if any of the files processed gives a warning
              about  problems  with  citations  or  references (i.e., undefined citations or references or about
              multiply defined references).  This is <b>after</b> <u>latexmk</u> has completed all the runs it  needs  to  try
              and  resolve  references  and  citations.   Thus  <b>-Werror</b> causes <u>latexmk</u> to treat such warnings as
              errors, but only when they occur on the last run of *latex and only after processing is  complete.
              Also can be set by the configuration variable <u>$warnings_as_errors</u>.

       <b>-xdv</b>   Generate xdv version of document using xelatex.  (And turn off any incompatible requests.)

       <b>-xelatex</b>
              Use <u>xelatex</u>.  That is, use <u>xelatex</u> to process the source file(s).  This will cause generation of a
              pdf (but indirectly through a xdv file).  (And turn off any incompatible requests.)

              This option is equivalent to using the following option

                   -pdfxe

              [<u>Note</u>: Note that the method of implementation of this option, but not its intended primary effect,
              differ from some earlier versions of <u>latexmk</u>. <u>Latexmk</u> first uses <u>xelatex</u> to make an .xdv file, and
              does all the extra runs needed (including those of <u>bibtex</u>, etc).  Only after that does it make the
              pdf  file  from the .xdv file, using <u>xdvipdfmx</u>.  See the documentation for the <b>-pdfxe</b> for why this
              is done.]

       <b>-xelatex="COMMAND"</b>
              This sets the string specifying the command to run <u>xelatex</u>.  It sets the variable <u>$xelatex</u>.

              <u>Warning</u>: It is important to ensure that the <b>-no-pdf</b> is used when <u>xelatex</u> is invoked, since <u>latexmk</u>
              expects <u>xelatex</u> to produce an .xdv file, not a .pdf  file.  If  you  provide  %O  in  the  command
              specification,  this  will be done automatically.  See the documentation for the <b>-pdfxe</b> option for
              why <u>latexmk</u> makes a .xdv file rather than a .pdf file when <u>xelatex</u> is used.

              An example of the use of the <b>-xelatex</b> option:

                   latexmk -pdfxe -xelatex="xelatex --shell-escape %O %S"  foo.tex

              <u>Note:</u> <u>This</u> <u>option</u> <u>when</u> <u>provided</u> <u>with</u> <u>the</u> <u>COMMAND</u> <u>argument</u>  <u>only</u>  <u>sets</u>  <u>the</u>  <u>command</u>  <u>for</u>  <u>invoking</u>
              <u>xelatex;</u>  <u>it</u>  <u>does</u>  <u>not</u>  <u>turn</u>  <u>on</u>  <u>the</u>  <u>use</u>  <u>of</u>  <u>lualatex.</u>  <u>That</u> <u>is</u> <u>done</u> <u>by</u> <u>other</u> <u>options</u> <u>or</u> <u>in</u> <u>an</u>
              <u>initialization</u> <u>file.</u>

       <b>Compatibility</b> <b>between</b> <b>options</b>

       The preview-continuous option <b>-pvc</b> can only work with one file.  So in this case you will  normally  only
       specify one filename on the command line.

       Options <b>-p</b>, <b>-pv</b> and <b>-pvc</b> are mutually exclusive.  So each of these options turns the others off.

</pre><h4><b>DEALING</b> <b>WITH</b> <b>ERRORS,</b> <b>PROBLEMS,</b> <b>ETC</b></h4><pre>
       Some possibilities:

       a.  If  you  get a strange error, do look carefully at the output that is on the screen and in log files.
       While there is much that is notoriously verbose in the output of <u>latex</u> (and that is added to by <u>latexmk</u>),
       the verbosity is there for a reason: to enable the user to diagnose problems.  <u>Latexmk</u> does  repeat  some
       messages  at  the  end  of  a  run  that it thinks would otherwise be easy to miss in the middle of other
       output.

       b. Generally, remember that <u>latexmk</u> does its work by running other  programs.   Your  first  priority  in
       dealing  with errors should be to examine what went wrong with the individual programs.  Then you need to
       correct the causes of errors in the runs of these programs.  (Often these come from errors in the  source
       document, but they could also be about missing LaTeX packages, etc.)

       c.  If  <u>latexmk</u>  doesn't  run  the  programs  the  way  you  would  like,  then  you need to look in this
       documentation   at   the   list   of   command   line   options   and   then   at   the    sections    on
       configuration/initialization  files.  A lot of <u>latexmk</u>'s behavior is configurable to deal with particular
       situations.  (But there is a lot of reading!)

       <u>The</u> <u>remainder</u> <u>of</u> <u>these</u> <u>notes</u> <u>consists</u> <u>of</u> <u>ideas</u> <u>for</u> <u>dealing</u> <u>with</u> <u>more</u> <u>difficult</u> <u>situations.</u>

       d. Further tricks can involve replacing the standard commands that <u>latexmk</u>  runs  by  other  commands  or
       scripts.

       e.  For  possible  examples  of  code  for  use  in  an RC file, see the directory example_rcfiles in the
       distribution of <u>latexmk</u> (e.g., at <a href="http://mirror.ctan.org/support/latexmk/example_rcfiles">http://mirror.ctan.org/support/latexmk/example_rcfiles</a>).  Even if these
       examples don't do what you want, they may provide suitable inspiration.

       f. There's a useful trick that can be used when you use <u>lualatex</u> instead of <u>pdflatex</u> (and in some related
       situations).  The problem is that <u>latexmk</u> won't notice a dependency on a file, bar.baz say, that is input
       by the lua code in your document instead of by the LaTeX part.  (Thus if you  change  bar.baz  and  rerun
       <u>latexmk</u>,  then  <u>latexmk</u>  will  think  no  files  have  changed and not rerun <u>lualatex</u>, whereas if you had
       '\input{bar.baz}' in the LaTeX part of the document, <u>latexmk</u> would notice the change.)  One  solution  is
       just to put the following somewhere in the LaTeX part of the document:

                     \typeout{(bar.baz)}

       This puts a line in the log file that <u>latexmk</u> will treat as implying that the file bar.baz was read.  (At
       present  I  don't  know a way of doing this automatically.)  Of course, if the file has a different name,
       change bar.baz to the name of your file.

</pre><h4><b>AUXILIARY</b> <b>AND</b> <b>OUTPUT</b> <b>DIRECTORIES</b></h4><pre>
       Running *latex and the associated programs generate a number of files, it is often convenient to  arrange
       for  the  generated  files to be in a different directory than the source file(s) of a document.  For our
       purposes here, we identify two classes of generated file.

       One class is what one may term the final output files, for example, the .pdf file  generated  by  running
       pdflatex, or the .dvi file from latex. Also in this class is the ps file generated by applying dvips to a
       .dvi  file.  There  are also .synctec or .synctex.gz files that can be used by programs that display .pdf
       files and the like to relate positions in them to positions in source files.

       The second class of file is composed of all other generated files: These include notably .aux files  that
       are  used  for implementing cross referencing, and are both generated on one run and read on a later run.
       Many packages generate yet more such intermediate files, as well as programs like bibtex, makeindex, etc.
       There are also .log files from *latex and corresponding files from other programs.

       Let us use the term "output directory" for the directory that receives the final output files,  and  "aux
       directory"  for  the  directory for the other generated files.  If no special options are provided to the
       *latex programs, these directories default to the current directory, and then the generated files  aren't
       segregated.   If the two directories are the same, as is the simplest situation, then all generated files
       are written to the same directory,  and  one  often  simply  refers  to  the  output  directory,  without
       mentioning a separate aux directory.

       Support  for them is provided for them in the *latex programs: by the single option <b>-output-directory</b> for
       the TeXLive implementations, and by the options  <b>-aux-directory</b>  and  <b>-output-directory</b>  for  the  MiKTeX
       implementations.   Special  support  like  this  is  needed for two reasons: First is that there are many
       packages that write files and it needs to be  arranged  that  these  are  automatically  written  to  the
       appropriate  directory  without  any rewriting of the packages' code.  Second is that the files are often
       read in again on subsequent runs of *latex, and it is necessary that the program knows where to find  the
       files.

       A complication is that the TeXLive implementation does not allow for separate aux and output directories.
       Latexmk  deals  with  this by being able to emulating a separate aux directory: In this method it invokes
       *latex with just an <b>-output-directory</b> option, with the directory set not to the desired output directory,
       but to the aux directory.  After running *latex, it moves  the  relevant  final  output  file(s)  to  the
       intended output directory.  Emulation can be turned on by setting the configuration variable <u>$emulate_aux</u>
       to one in a configuration file or by using latexmk's <b>-emulate-aux-dir</b> option.  The emulation method works
       equally well if MiKTeX is used.

       Latexmk  also turns emulation on if it is found to be needed, as follows.  Suppose emulation is initially
       off, but the aux and output directories are  different.   Then  latexmk  invokes  *latex  with  an  -aux-
       directory  option and after the run finds that it hasn't been obeyed, notably because the .log file is in
       the output directory rather than the aux  directory.   Latexmk  then  sets  emulation  on,  and  retries.
       Conceivably,  it  could  move  all  the  appropriate generated files from the output directory to the aux
       directory; but there is such a large variety of possibilities for  these  files  that  this  is  hard  to
       identify all of them reliably except for simple cases.

       Note  that  the  emulation  issue  only  arises  when  the  user  has arranged for the the aux and output
       directories to be different.  When instead they are equal, e.g., because the user only set  the  <u>$out_dir</u>
       variable, then latexmk invokes *latex with only an <b>-output-directory</b> option, which works as intended with
       both TeXLive and MiKTeX.

       In addition, latexmk arranges the invocations of any auxiliary programs like bibtex and makeindex so that
       they  will read and write the relevant files from and to the aux directory.  Programs like dvips, dvipdf,
       ps2pdf, and xdvipdfmx are invoked so that they read from the appropriate places and write their output to
       the output directory.

       <u>Files</u> <u>considered</u> <u>as</u> <u>final</u> <u>output</u> <u>files,</u> <u>i.e.,</u> <u>those</u> <u>that</u> <u>belong</u> <u>in</u> <u>the</u> <u>output</u> <u>directory</u> <u>rather</u>  <u>than</u>  <u>the</u>
       <u>aux</u>  <u>directory</u>:  These  have the extensions .dvi, .ps., .pdf, .synctex, and .synctex.gz.  A special case,
       because of compatibility issues, is of .fls files: See below.

       Note that xelatex when invoked with its <b>-no-pdf</b> option, as latexmk does, generates an  .xdv  file,  which
       would  appear  to  have  the same status as a .dvi file generated by latex.  Nevertheless, latexmk treats
       .xdv as an intermediate file that is found in the aux directory.  This is to match MiKTeX's treatment  of
       the  <b>-aux-directory</b>  option.   As further justification, one can say that under modern conditions an .xdv
       file is (almost) always an intermediate file.  Historically, the situation with .dvi files from latex was
       different, and currently dvi previewers do exist.

       <u>Variables</u> <u>and</u> <u>options</u> <u>for</u> <u>directories</u>: The variables for setting  the  aux  and  output  directories  are
       <u>$aux_dir</u>  and  <u>$out_dir</u>,  with corresponding command line options <b>-auxdir</b> (or <b>-aux-directory</b>) and <b>-outdir</b>
       (or <b>-output-directory</b>).  When a value for these is blank (which is the default value), it implies the use
       of a default: For the aux directory, the default is to set it equal to the  output  directory.   For  the
       output directory, the default is to be the current directory.

       For  the  turning  on and off of the emulation mode, there is the configuration variable <u>$emulate_aux</u> and
       the options <b>-emulate-aux-dir</b>, <b>-emulate-aux-dir-</b>, <b>-noemulate-aux-dir</b>.

       <u>Interaction</u> <u>with</u> <u>-cd</u> <u>option</u>: When the <b>-cd</b> option is used (or the equivalent setting of <u>$do_cd</u>  variable),
       then  latexmk changes the working directory to the document directory before invoking *latex.  If the aux
       and/or output directories are given by relative paths, e.g., by  <b>-outdir=output</b>  for  a  directory  named
       "output",  then  the  directories  are  relative  to  the document directory, rather than relative to the
       working directory that was in effect when latexmk was invoked. This matches the  behavior  of  *latex  as
       invoked with the provided command line directory argument(s) after the change of working directory to the
       document directory.

       <u>Automatic</u>  <u>creation</u>  <u>of</u>  <u>aux</u>  <u>and</u>  <u>output</u>  <u>directories</u>:  Unlike  *latex,  if  latexmk finds the requested
       directory/ies don't exist, it creates it/them, thereby avoiding errors when *latex is invoked.

       If the document uses the \include macro to read a .tex file from a subdirectory, *latex will  attempt  to
       write  an  extra  aux  file  to the corresponding subdirectory of the aux directory.  If the subdirectory
       doesn't exist, then *latex will complain that it can't write the aux file.   After  the  run  of  *latex,
       latexmk  detects  this  situation,  creates  the  necessary  directory,  and reruns *latex with the error
       situation corrected.

       <u>Choice</u> <u>of</u> <u>aux</u> <u>and</u> <u>output</u> <u>directories</u>: Often the aux and output directories are given as subdirectories of
       the document directory, e.g., by <b>-outdir=output</b>. But it is possible to provide, for example, an  absolute
       path or a path relative to a parent directory, e.g., "/tmp/foo" or "../output".  Be aware that in general
       this  can  cause  problems,  notably  with <u>makeindex</u> or <u>bibtex</u>.  This is because modern versions of these
       programs, by default, will refuse to work when they find that they are asked to write  to  a  file  in  a
       directory  that  appears  not  to be the current working directory or one of its subdirectories.  This is
       part of security measures by the whole TeX system that try to prevent malicious or errant  TeX  documents
       from incorrectly messing with a user's files.

       By  default,  latexmk  evades  this  issue:  Before running bibtex and makeindex, latexmk changes working
       directory to the aux directory, with appropriate settings of search paths.  The use or  non-use  of  this
       trick  is  governed  by  the  variables  <u>$bibtex_fudge</u>  and  <u>$makeindex_fudge</u>.   Unfortunately, the trick
       sometimes makes bibtex and makeindex unable to find files.

       If necessary the trick can be turned off. But this is incompatible with an aux directory like, "/tmp/foo"
       of "../output").  If you really have to deal with this situation, and only if you have to deal  with  it,
       then  you  need  to  disable  the  security measures (and assume any risks).  One way of doing this is to
       temporarily set an operating system environment variable openout_any to "a" (as in  "all"),  to  override
       the default "paranoid" setting.

       <u>Certain</u>  <u>names</u>  <u>of</u>  <u>aux</u> <u>and</u> <u>output</u> <u>directories</u> <u>not</u> <u>allowed</u> <u>on</u> <u>Microsoft</u> <u>Windows</u>: It is natural to want to
       use the name "aux" for the aux directory, e.g., by  using  the  option  <b>-auxdir=aux</b>.   But  on  Microsoft
       operating  systems  "aux"  is  one  of  the names that is not allowed for a file or directory.  I find it
       useful to standardize on a name like "auxdir" (e.g., by  <b>-auxdir=auxdir</b>);  this  works  independently  of
       operating system.

       <u>Location</u>  <u>of</u>  <u>.fls</u>  <u>file</u>:  Much  of the dependency information that latexmk uses comes from the .fls file
       generated when *latex is invoked with the <b>-recorder</b> option, which latexmk does by default.  It  may  seem
       rational  that  this  is written to the aux directory.  But in fact versions of MiKTeX prior to Oct. 2020
       wrote it to the output directory.  Later versions do write it to the aux directory.  To deal  with  this,
       latexmk  does  two  things:  First,  if  latexmk  finds that the .fls file has only been generated in the
       "wrong" directory, then latexmk copies it to the expected  directory,  after  which  latexmk's  operation
       continues  correctly  independently of the behavior of *latex. Second it allows its idea of the "correct"
       (or expected) directory to be configured by the variable <u>$fls_uses_aux_dir</u>.  This defaults  to  zero,  to
       correspond to MiKTeX's current behavior.

</pre><h4><b>ALLOWING</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>CHANGE</b> <b>OF</b> <b>OUTPUT</b> <b>FILE</b> <b>TYPE</b></h4><pre>
       When  one  of  the  latex  engines  is run, the usual situation is that <u>latex</u> produces a .dvi file, while
       <u>pdflatex</u> and <u>lualatex</u> produce a .pdf file.  For <u>xelatex</u> the default is to produce a  .pdf  file,  but  to
       optimize  processing  time  <u>latexmk</u>  runs  <u>xelatex</u>  its  <b>-no-pdf</b> option so that it produces an .xdv file.
       Further processing by <u>latexmk</u> takes this as a starting point.

       However, the actual output file may differ from the normal expectation; and then <u>latexmk</u> can  adjust  its
       processing to accommodate this situation.  The difference in output file type can happen for two reasons:
       One  is that for <u>latex</u>, <u>pdflatex</u> and <u>lualatex</u> the document itself can override the defaults. The other is
       that there may be a configuration, or misconfiguration, such that the program  that  <u>latexmk</u>  invokes  to
       compile  the  document  is  not  the  expected  one,  or  is given options incompatible with what <u>latexmk</u>
       initially expects.

       Under <u>latex</u> and <u>pdflatex</u>, control of the output format by the document is done by setting the  \pdfoutput
       macro.  Under <u>lualatex</u>, the \outputmode macro is used instead.

       One  example  of  an important use-case for document control of the output format is a document that uses
       the psfrag package to insert graphical elements in the output  file.  The  psfrag  package  achieves  its
       effects  by inserting postscript code in the output of the compilation of the document.  This entails the
       use of compilation to a .dvi file, followed by the  use  of  conversion  to  a  postscript  file  (either
       directly,  as  by  <u>dvips</u>  or  implicitly, as an intermediate step by <u>dvipdf</u>).  Then it is useful to force
       output to be of the .dvi format by inserting \pdfoutput=0 in the preamble of the document.

       Another example is where the document uses graphics file of the .pdf, .jpg,  and  png  types.   With  the
       default  setting  for  the  graphicx  package, these can be processed in compilation to .pdf but not with
       compilation to .dvi.  In this case, it is useful to insert \pdfoutput=1 in the preamble of  the  document
       to force compilation to .pdf output format.

       In  all  of  these  cases, it is needed that <u>latexmk</u> has to adjust its processing to deal with a mismatch
       between the actual output format (out of  .pdf,  .dvi,  .xdv)  and  the  initially  expected  output,  if
       possible.  <u>Latexmk</u> does this provided the following conditions are met.

       The  first  is that <u>latexmk</u>'s <u>$allow_switch</u> configuration variable is set to a non-zero value as it is by
       default.  If this variable is zero, a mismatch of filetypes in the compilation results in an error.

       The second condition for <u>latexmk</u> to be able to handle a  change  of  output  type  is  that  no  explicit
       requests  for  .dvi or .ps output files are made.  Explicit requests are by the <b>-dvi</b> and <b>-ps</b>, <b>-print=dvi</b>,
       <b>-print=ps</b>,  <b>-view=dvi</b>,  and  <b>-view=ps</b>  options,  and  by  corresponding  settings   of   the   <u>$dvi_mode</u>,
       <u>$postscript_mode</u>,   <u>$print_type</u>,  and  <u>$view</u>  configuration  variables.   The  print-type  and  view-type
       restrictions only apply when printing and viewing  are  explicitly  requested,  respectively.   For  this
       purpose,  the  use  of  the  <b>-pdfdvi</b>  and  <b>-pdfps</b> options (and the corresponding setting of the <u>$pdf_mode</u>
       variable) does not count as an explicit request for the .dvi and .ps files; they are merely regarded as a
       request for making a .pdf file together with an initial proposal for the processing route to make it.

       Note that when accommodating a change in output file type, there is involved a substantial change in  the
       network  of rules that <u>latexmk</u> uses in its actions.  The second condition applied to accommodate a change
       is to avoid situations where the change in the  rule  network  is  too  radical  to  be  readily  handled
       automatically.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION/INITIALIZATION</b> <b>(RC)</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       In  this  section is explained which configuration files are read by <u>latexmk</u>. Subsequent sections "How to
       Set Variables in Initialization Files",  "Format  of  Command  Specifications",  "List  of  Configuration
       Variables  Usable  in  Initialization  Files",  "Custom  Dependencies", and "Advanced Configuration" give
       details on what can be configured and how.

       <u>Latexmk</u> can be customized using initialization files, which are read at startup in the following order:

       1) The system RC file, if it exists.
          On a UNIX system, <u>latexmk</u> searches the following directories for a
          system RC file, which may be named either "LatexMk" or "latexmkrc".  The
          directories are searched in the following order, and <u>latexmk</u> uses
          the first such file it finds (if any):
          "<a href="file:/etc">/etc</a>",
          "/opt/local/share/latexmk",
          "/usr/local/share/latexmk",
          "/usr/local/lib/latexmk".
          On a MS-Windows system it looks just in "C:\latexmk".
          On a cygwin system (i.e., a MS-Windows system in which Perl is that of cygwin), <u>latexmk</u> looks  in  the
       directories
          "/cygdrive/c/latexmk",
          "<a href="file:/etc">/etc</a>",
          "/opt/local/share/latexmk",
          "/usr/local/share/latexmk",
          "/usr/local/lib/latexmk".

       If  the  environment  variable  LATEXMKRCSYS is set, its value is used as the name of the system RC file,
       instead of any of the above.

       2) The user's RC file, if it exists.  This can  be  in  one  of  two  places.   The  traditional  one  is
       ".latexmkrc"  in  the  user's home directory.  The other possibility is "latexmk/latexmkrc" in the user's
       XDG    configuration    home    directory.     The    actual    file    read    is    the    first     of
       "$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/latexmk/latexmkrc"       or       "$HOME/.latexmkrc"      which      exists.       (See
       https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html for details on the XDG  Base
       Directory Specification.)

       Here  $HOME  is the user's home directory.  [<u>Latexmk</u> determines the user's home directory as follows:  It
       is the value of the environment variable HOME, if this variable exists, which normally  is  the  case  on
       UNIX-like systems (including Linux and OS-X).  Otherwise the environment variable USERPROFILE is used, if
       it  exists, which normally is the case on MS-Windows systems. Otherwise a blank string is used instead of
       $HOME, in which case <u>latexmk</u> does not look for an RC file in it.]

       $XDG_CONFIG_HOME is the value of  the  environment  variable  XDG_CONFIG_HOME  if  it  exists.   If  this
       environment  variable does not exist, but $HOME is non-blank, then $XDG_CONFIG_HOME is set to the default
       value of $HOME/.config.  Otherwise $XDG_CONFIG_HOME is blank, and <u>latexmk</u> does not look for  an  RC  file
       under it.

       3)  The  RC  file  in  the  current  working  directory.   This  file  can be named either "latexmkrc" or
       ".latexmkrc", and the first of these to be found is used, if any.

       4) Any RC file(s) specified on the command line with the <b>-r</b> option.

       Each RC file is a sequence of <u>Perl</u> commands.  Naturally, a user can use this in creative ways.   But  for
       most  purposes,  one  simply  uses a sequence of assignment statements that override some of the built-in
       settings of <u>Latexmk</u>.  Straightforward cases can be handled without knowledge  of  the  <u>Perl</u>  language  by
       using the examples in this document as templates.  Comment lines are introduced by the "#" character.

       Note  that  command  line  options  are  obeyed  in the order in which they are written; thus any RC file
       specified on the command line with the <b>-r</b>  option  can  override  previous  options  but  can  be  itself
       overridden  by  later  options  on  the  command  line.   There  is  also  the  <b>-e</b>  option,  which allows
       initialization code to be specified in <u>latexmk</u>'s command line.

        <u>For</u> <u>possible</u> <u>examples</u> <u>of</u> <u>code</u> <u>for</u> <u>in</u> <u>an</u> <u>RC</u> <u>file,</u> <u>see</u> <u>the</u> <u>directory</u> <u>example_rcfiles</u> <u>in</u>  <u>the</u>  <u>distribution</u>
       <u>of</u> <u>latexmk</u> (e.g., at <a href="http://mirror.ctan.org/support/latexmk/example_rcfiles">http://mirror.ctan.org/support/latexmk/example_rcfiles</a>).

</pre><h4><b>HOW</b> <b>TO</b> <b>SET</b> <b>VARIABLES</b> <b>IN</b> <b>INITIALIZATION</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       The  important  variables  that  can  be  configured  are described in the section "List of configuration
       variables usable in initialization files".  (See the earlier section  "Configuration/Initialization  (rc)
       Files"  for  the  files where the configurations are done.)  Syntax for setting these variables is of the
       following forms:

                           $bibtex = 'bibtex %O %S';

       for the setting of a string variable,

                           $preview_mode = 1;

       for the setting of a numeric variable, and

                           @default_files = ('paper', 'paper1');

       for the setting of an array of strings.  It is possible to  append  an  item  to  an  array  variable  as
       follows:

                           push @default_files, 'paper2';

       Note  that  simple  "scalar"  variables have names that begin with a $ character and array variables have
       names that begin with a @ character. Each statement ends with a semicolon.

       Strings should be enclosed in single quotes.  (You could  use  double  quotes,  as  in  many  programming
       languages.   But then the <u>Perl</u> programming language brings into play some special rules for interpolating
       variables into strings.  People not fluent in <u>Perl</u> will want to avoid these complications.)

       You can do much more complicated things, but for this you will need to consult  a  manual  for  the  <u>Perl</u>
       programming language.

</pre><h4><b>FORMAT</b> <b>OF</b> <b>COMMAND</b> <b>SPECIFICATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Some  of  the  variables  set  the  commands  that <u>latexmk</u> uses for carrying out its work, for example to
       generate a .dvi file from a .tex file or  to  view  a  postscript  file.   This  section  describes  some
       important  features  of how the commands are specified.  (Note that some of the possibilities listed here
       do not apply to the <u>$kpsewhich</u> variable; see its documentation.)

       <b>Placeholders</b>:  Supposed you wanted <u>latexmk</u> to use the command  elatex  in  place  of  the  regular  latex
       command,  and suppose moreover that you wanted to give it the option "--shell-escape".  You could do this
       by the following setting:

            $latex = 'elatex --shell-escape %O %S';

       The two items starting with the % character are  placeholders.   These  are  substituted  by  appropriate
       values  before  the  command  is  run.   Thus  %S will be replaced by the source file that elatex will be
       applied to, and %O will be replaced by any options that <u>latexmk</u> has decided  to  use  for  this  command.
       (E.g.,  if you used the <b>-silent</b> option in the invocation of <u>latexmk</u>,  it results in the replacement of %O
       by "-interaction=batchmode".)

       The available placeholders are:

       <b>%A</b>     basename of the main tex file.  Unlike %R, this is unaffected by the setting of a jobname by   the
              <u>-jobname</u> option or the <u>$jobname</u> configuration value.

       <b>%B</b>     base  of  filename for current command.  E.g., if a postscript file document.ps is being made from
              the dvi file document.dvi, then the basename is document.

       <b>%D</b>     destination file (e.g., the name of the postscript file when converting a dvi file to postscript).

       <b>%O</b>     options

       <b>%P</b>     If  the  variable  <u>$pre_tex_code</u>  is  non-empty,  then  %P  is  substituted  by  the  contents  of
              <u>$pre_tex_code</u>  followed  by  <u>\input{SOURCE}</u>,  where SOURCE stands for the name of the source file.
              Appropriate quoting is done.  This enables TeX code to be passed to one of the <u>*latex</u>  engines  to
              be executed before the source file is read.

              If the variable <u>$pre_tex_code</u> is the empty string, then %P is equivalent to %S.

       <b>%R</b>     root filename.

              By default this is the basename of the main tex file.  However the value can be changed by the use
              of  the  <u>-jobname</u>  option  or  the <u>$jobname</u> configuration variable.  This is then the basename for
              files like the .aux and .log files produced by running *latex, as well for the  main  .dvi,  .pdf,
              .ps and/or .xdvi files.

       <b>%S</b>     source file (e.g., the name of the dvi file when converting a .dvi file to ps).

       <b>%T</b>     The name of the primary tex file.

       <b>%U</b>     If  the  variable  <u>$pre_tex_code</u> is non-empty, then its value is substituted for %U (appropriately
              quoted).  Otherwise it is replaced by a null string.

       <b>%Y</b>     Name of directory for auxiliary  output  files  (see  the  configuration  variable  <u>$aux_dir</u>).   A
              directory  separation  character  ('/') is appended if <u>$aux_dir</u> is non-empty and does not end in a
              suitable character, with suitable characters being those appropriate to UNIX and MS-Windows, i.e.,
              ':', '/' and '\'.   Note that if after initialization,  <u>$out_dir</u> is set, but <u>$aux_dir</u> is  not  set
              (i.e., it is blank), then <u>latexmk</u> sets <u>$aux_dir</u> to the same value <u>$out_dir</u>.

       <b>%Z</b>     Name  of  directory  for  output  files  (see  the  configuration variable <u>$out_dir</u>).  A directory
              separation character ('/') is appended if <u>$out_dir</u> is non-empty and does not  end  in  a  suitable
              character, with suitable characters being those appropriate to UNIX and MS-Windows, i.e., ':', '/'
              and '\'

       If  for  some  reason  you  need a literal % character in your string not subject to the above rules, use
       "%%".

       Appropriate quoting will be applied to the filename substitutions, so you mustn't  supply  them  yourself
       even  if  the  names  of your files have spaces in them.  (But if your TeX filenames have spaces in them,
       beware that some older versions of the TeX program cannot correctly handle filenames containing  spaces.)
       In  case  <u>latexmk</u>'s  quoting  does  not  work  correctly  on  your system, you can turn it off -- see the
       documentation for the variable <u>$quote_filenames</u>.

       See the default values in the section "List of configuration variables usable  in  initialization  files"
       for what is normally the most appropriate usage.

       If  you  omit  to supply any placeholders whatever in the specification of a command, <u>latexmk</u> will supply
       what its author thinks are appropriate defaults.  This gives compatibility with configuration  files  for
       previous versions of <u>latexmk</u>, which didn't use placeholders.

       <b>"Detaching"</b>  <b>a</b>  <b>command</b>:  Normally  when  <u>latexmk</u>  runs  a  command,  it  waits for the command to run to
       completion.  This is appropriate for commands like latex, of course.  But  for  previewers,  the  command
       should  normally  run  detached,  so that <u>latexmk</u> gets the previewer running and then returns to its next
       task (or exits if there is nothing else to do).  To achieve this effect of detaching a command, you  need
       to precede the command name with "start ", as in

            $dvi_previewer = 'start xdvi %O %S';

       This will be translated to whatever is appropriate for your operating system.

       Notes:  (1)  In  some  circumstances, <u>latexmk</u> will always run a command detached.  This is the case for a
       previewer in preview continuous mode, since otherwise previewing continuously makes no sense.   (2)  This
       precludes  the possibility of running a command named start.  (3) If the word start occurs more than once
       at the beginning of the command string, that is equivalent to having just one.  (4)  Under  cygwin,  some
       complications  happen,  since  cygwin  amounts  to a complicated merging of UNIX and MS-Windows.  See the
       source code for how I've handled the problem.

       <b>Command</b> <b>names</b> <b>containing</b> <b>spaces</b>: Under MS-Windows it is common  that  the  name  of  a  command  includes
       spaces,  since  software  is often installed in a subdirectory of "C:\Program Files".  Such command names
       should be enclosed in double quotes, as in

            $lpr_pdf = '"c:/Program Files/Ghostgum/gsview/gsview32.exe" /p %S';
            $pdf_previewer = 'start "c:/Program Files/SumatraPDF/SumatraPDF.exe" %O %S';
            $pdf_previewer = 'start "c:/Program Files/SumatraPDF (x86)/SumatraPDF.exe" %O %S';

       (Note about the above example: Under MS-Windows forward  slashes  are  equivalent  to  backslashes  in  a
       filename  under  almost  all  circumstances,  provided  that the filename is inside double quotes.  It is
       easier to use forward slashes in examples like the one above, since then one does not have to worry about
       the rules for dealing with forward slashes in strings in the Perl language.)

       <b>Command</b> <b>names</b> <b>under</b> <b>Cygwin</b>: If <u>latexmk</u> is executed  by  Cygwin's  Perl,   <u>be</u>  <u>particularly</u>  <u>certain</u>  <u>that</u>
       <u>pathnames</u>  <u>in</u>  <u>commands</u>  <u>have</u>  <b>forward</b>  <u>slashes</u>  not  the usual backslashes for the separator of pathname
       components.  See the above examples.  Backslashes often get misinterpreted by  the  Unix  shell  used  by
       Cygwin's  Perl  to  execute external commands.  Forward slashes don't suffer from this problem, and (when
       quoted, as above) are equally acceptable to MS-Windows.

       <b>Using</b> <b>MS-Windows</b> <b>file</b> <b>associations</b>: A useful trick under modern versions of MS-Windows (e.g.,  WinXP)  is
       to use just the command 'start' by itself:

            $dvi_previewer = 'start %S';

       Under  MS-Windows,  this  will cause to be run whatever program the system has associated with dvi files.
       (The same applies for a postscript viewer and a pdf viewer.)  But note that  this  trick  is  not  always
       suitable  for  the  pdf  previwer,  if your system has acroread for the default pdf viewer.  As explained
       elsewhere, acroread under MS-Windows does not work well with <u>latex</u> and <u>latexmk</u>,  because  acroread  locks
       the pdf file.

       <b>Not</b> <b>using</b> <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>command</b>: If a command is not to be run, the command name NONE is used, as in

            $lpr  = 'NONE lpr';

       This  typically  is used when an appropriate command does not exist on your system.  The string after the
       "NONE" is effectively a comment.

       <b>Options</b> <b>to</b> <b>commands</b>: Setting the name of a command can be used not only for  changing  the  name  of  the
       command  called,  but  also to add options to command.  Suppose you want <u>latexmk</u> to use latex with source
       specials enabled.  Then you might use the following line in an initialization file:

            $latex = 'latex --src-specials %O %S';

       <b>Running</b> <b>a</b> <b>subroutine</b> <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>external</b> <b>command</b>: Use a specification starting with "internal", as in

            $latex = 'internal mylatex %O %S';
            sub mylatex {
                my @args = @_;
                # Possible preprocessing here
                return system 'latex', @args;
            }

       For some of the more  exotic  possibilities  that  then  become  available,  see  the  section  "Advanced
       configuration:  Some extra resources and advanced tricks". Also see some of the examples in the directory
       <u>example_rcfiles</u> in the <u>latexmk</u> distribution.

       <b>Advanced</b> <b>tricks</b>: Normally one specifies a single command for the commands invoked by <u>latexmk</u>.  Naturally,
       if there is some complicated additional processing you need to do in  your  special  situation,  you  can
       write  a  script  (or  batch file) to do the processing, and then configure <u>latexmk</u> to use your script in
       place of the standard program.

       You can also use a Perl subroutine instead of a script -- see above.  This is generally the most flexible
       and portable solution.

       It is also possible to configure <u>latexmk</u> to run multiple commands.  For example, if when running <u>pdflatex</u>
       to generate a pdf file from a tex file you need to run another program after  <u>pdflatex</u>  to  perform  some
       extra processing, you could do something like:

            $pdflatex = 'pdflatex --shell-escape %O %S; pst2pdf_for_latexmk %B';

       This definition assumes you are using a UNIX-like system (which includes Linux and OS-X), so that the two
       commands to be run are separated by the semicolon in the middle of the string.

       If you are using MS-Windows, you would replace the above line by

          $pdflatex = 'cmd /c pdflatex --shell-escape %O %S'
                      . '&amp;&amp; pst2pdf_for_latexmk %B';

       Here, the UNIX command separator ; is replaced by &amp;&amp;.  In addition, there is a problem that some versions
       of  <u>Perl</u> on MS-Windows do not obey the command separator; this problem is overcome by explicitly invoking
       the MS-Windows command-line processor <u>cmd.exe</u>.

</pre><h4><b>LIST</b> <b>OF</b> <b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>VARIABLES</b> <b>USABLE</b> <b>IN</b> <b>INITIALIZATION</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       In this section are specified the variables whose values can be adjusted to configure <u>latexmk</u>.  (See  the
       earlier  section  "Configuration/Initialization  (rc)  Files"  for the files where the configurations are
       done.)

       Default values are indicated in brackets.  Note  that  for  variables  that  are  boolean  in  character,
       concerning  whether  <u>latexmk</u>  does  or  does  not  behave in a certain way, a non-zero value, normally 1,
       indicates true, i.e., the behavior occurs, while a zero value indicates a false value, i.e., the behavior
       does not occur.

       <b>$allow_subdir_creation</b> <b>[1]</b>

              Specify action to take when message(s) in the .log file indicate a failure  of  an  attempt  by  a
              *latex  compilation  to  write  a  file  to  a  subdirectory  of  the output directory because the
              subdirectory didn't exist.

              If the value if <u>$allow_subdir_creation</u> is 0, no action is taken.  If it is 1, then the appropriate
              subdirectory is created and a rerun of *latex is triggered, but only if the file being written  is
              an  .aux file.  (This happens, for example, if the document includes a file from a subdirectory of
              the document directory, by the \include command.  If the value  of  <u>$allow_subdir_creation</u>  is  2,
              then the subdirectory creation is done independently of which type of file is in question.

       <b>$allow_switch</b> <b>[1]</b>

              This  controls  what  happens  when  the  output extension of latex, pdflatex, lualatex or xelatex
              differs from what is expected.  (The possible extensions are .dvi, .pdf, .xdv.)  This  can  happen
              with  the  use of the \pdfoutput macro in a document compiled under <u>latex</u> or <u>pdflatex</u>, or with the
              use of the \outputmode macro under <u>lualatex</u>.  It can also happen with certain kinds  of  incorrect
              configuration.

              In  such a case, <u>latexmk</u> can appropriately adjust its network of rules.  The adjustment is made if
              <u>$allow_switch</u> is on, and if no request for a dvi or ps file has been made.

              See the section ALLOWING FOR CHANGE OF OUTPUT EXTENSION.

       <b>$always_view_file_via_temporary</b> <b>[0]</b>
              Whether .ps and .pdf files are initially to be made in a temporary directory and then moved to the
              final location.  (This applies  to  <u>dvips</u>,  <u>dvipdf</u>,  and  <u>ps2pdf</u>  operations,  and  the  filtering
              operators  on  .dvi  and  .ps files.  It does not apply to <u>pdflatex</u>, unfortunately, since <u>pdflatex</u>
              provides no way of specifying a chosen name for the output file.)

              This use of a temporary file solves a problem  that  the  making  of  these  files  can  occupy  a
              substantial  time.   If  a viewer (notably <u>gv</u>) sees that the file has changed, it may read the new
              file before the program writing the file has not yet finished its work, which  can cause havoc.

              See the <u>$pvc_view_file_via_temporary</u>  variable  for  a  setting  that  applies  only  if  preview-
              continuous  mode  (-pvc  option)  is used.  See <u>$tmpdir</u> for the setting of the directory where the
              temporary file is created.

       <b>$analyze_input_log_always</b> <b>[1]</b>

              After a run of latex  (etc),  always  analyze  .log  for  input  files  in  the  &lt;...&gt;  and  (...)
              constructions.  Otherwise, only do the analysis when fls file doesn't exist or is out of date.

              Under  normal  circumstances,  the  data in the fls file is reliable, and the test of the log file
              gets lots of false positives; usually $analyze_input_log_always is best set to zero.  But the test
              of the log file is needed at least in the following situation:  When  a  user  needs  to  persuade
              latexmk  that  a  certain  file is a source file, and latexmk doesn't otherwise find it.  Then the
              user can write code that causes a line with (...) to be written to log file.  One  important  case
              is  for  lualatex, which doesn't always generate lines in the .fls file for input lua files.  (The
              situation with lualatex is HIGHLY version dependent, e.g., there was a big change between  TeXLive
              2016 and TeXLive 2017.)

              To   keep  backward  compatibility  with  older  versions  of  latexmk,  the  default  is  to  set
              $analyze_input_log_always to 1.

       <b>$auto_rc_use</b> <b>[1]</b>
              Whether to automatically read the standard initialization (rc) files,  which  are  the  system  RC
              file, the user's RC file, and the RC file in the current directory.  The command line option <b>-norc</b>
              can  be  used  to  turn this setting off.  Each RC file could also turn this setting off, i.e., it
              could set <u>$auto_rc_use</u> to zero to prevent automatic reading of the later RC files.

              This variable does not affect the reading of RC files specified on the  command  line  by  the  <b>-r</b>
              option.

       <b>$aux_dir</b> <b>[""]</b>
              The  aux directory, i.e., the directory in which auxiliary files (aux, log, etc) are to be written
              by a run of *latex.

              If this variable is not set, but <u>$out_dir</u> is set, then latexmk takes the aux  directory  to  equal
              the output directory which is the directory to which final output files are to be written.

              If neither variable is set, then the current directory when *latex is invoked is used both for the
              aux and output directories.

              If  the  aux  and  output  directories are distinct, then the aux directory contains all generated
              files with the exception of "final output files",  which  are  defined  to  be  .dvi,  .ps,  .pdf,
              .synctex, and .synctex.gz files.

              See the section AUXILIARY AND OUTPUT DIRECTORIES for more details.

       <b>$aux_out_dir_report</b> <b>[0]</b>
              If  this  variable  is  set to 1, then prior to the processing of each primary .tex file, list the
              settings for aux and output directories,  after  they  have  been  normalized  from  the  settings
              specified during initialization.

              This report gives a reminder of where to look for generated files.

              The  report  is  done  per  primary .tex file, because of possible directory changes for each file
              (when the <b>-cd</b> option is used).  In the simplest  cases,  the  directory  names  are  the  same  as
              originally  specified.   But  in  general  some  clean  up/normalization  is performed; this helps
              performance and cleans up output to the screen.

              If this variable is set to 2, then  halt  after  reporting  the  settings  for  the  aux  and  out
              directories,  rather than continuing with processing of tex files.  This setting is primarily used
              for debugging configuration issues.  See the <b>-dir-report-only</b> option.

       <b>$bad_warning_is_error</b> <b>[0]</b>
              Whether to treat bad warnings reported by *latex in log file as errors. The specifications of  the
              warning messages are in <u>@bad_warnings</u>.

       <b>@bad_warnings</b>
              Array  of  regular  expressions  specifying  messages  in  log file that are officially treated as
              warnings  rather  than  errors  by  *latex,  but  which  a  user  may   treat   as   errors:   See
              <u>$bad_warning_is_error</u>.

              Currently the default set of these warnings is those about \end occurring inside constructs.

       <b>$banner</b> <b>[0]</b>
              If  nonzero,  the  banner  message  is  printed  across  each page when converting the dvi file to
              postscript.  Without modifying the variable <u>$banner_message</u>, this is equivalent to specifying  the
              <b>-d</b> option.

              Note that if <u>$banner</u> is nonzero, the <u>$postscript_mode</u> is assumed and the postscript file is always
              generated, even if it is newer than the dvi file.

       <b>$banner_intensity</b> <b>[0.95]</b>
              Equivalent  to the <b>-bi</b> option, this is a decimal number between 0 and 1 that specifies how dark to
              print the banner message. 0 is black, 1 is white.   The  default  is  just  right  if  your  toner
              cartridge isn't running too low.

       <b>$banner_message</b> <b>["DRAFT"]</b>
              The  banner message to print across each page when converting the dvi file to postscript.  This is
              equivalent to the <b>-bm</b> option.

       <b>$banner_scale</b> <b>[220.0]</b>
              A decimal number that specifies how large the banner message will be printed.  Experimentation  is
              necessary  to  get  the right scale for your message, as a rule of thumb the scale should be about
              equal to 1100 divided by the number of characters in the message.  The Default is just right for 5
              character messages.  This is equivalent to the <b>-bs</b> option.

       <b>@BIBINPUTS</b>
              This is an array variable, now mostly obsolete, that specifies directories  where  <u>latexmk</u>  should
              look  for  .bib  files.   By  default  it  is  set  from the BIBINPUTS environment variable of the
              operating system.  If that environment variable is not set, a single element  list  consisting  of
              the current directory is set.  The format of the directory names depends on your operating system,
              of course.  Examples for setting this variable are:

                      @BIBINPUTS = ( ".", "C:\\bibfiles" );
                      @BIBINPUTS = ( ".", "\\server\bibfiles" );
                      @BIBINPUTS = ( ".", "C:/bibfiles" );
                      @BIBINPUTS = ( ".", "//server/bibfiles" );
                      @BIBINPUTS = ( ".", "/usr/local/texmf/bibtex/bib" );

              Note  that  under  MS  Windows,  either a forward slash "/" or a backward slash "\" can be used to
              separate pathname components, so the first two and the second two examples are  equivalent.   Each
              backward  slash  should  be  doubled  to  avoid running afoul of <u>Perl</u>'s rules for writing strings.
              Generally, it is simplest always to use forward slashes instead of backward slashes.

              <u>Important</u> <u>note:</u> This variable is now mostly obsolete in the current version of <u>latexmk</u>,  since  it
              now  uses  a  better  method of searching for files using the kpsewhich command.  However, if your
              system is an unusual one without  the  kpsewhich  command,  you  may  need  to  set  the  variable
              <u>@BIBINPUTS</u>.

       <b>$biber</b> <b>["biber</b> <b>%O</b> <b>%S"]</b>
              The biber processing program.

              Switch(es) for the biber processing program when silent mode is on.

       <b>$bibtex</b> <b>["bibtex</b> <b>%O</b> <b>%S"]</b>

       <b>$bibtex_fudge</b> <b>[1]</b>
              When using bibtex, whether to change directory to $aux_dir before running bibtex.

              The need arises as follows:

              a. With bibtex before about 2019, if the filename given to it contains a path component, there was
              a bug that bibtex would not find extra aux files, as produced by the \include command in TeX.

              b.  With  all  moderately  recent  versions  of bibtex, bibtex may refuse to write its bbl and blg
              files, for security reasons, for certain cases of the path component of the filename given to it.

              However, there are also rare cases where the change-directory method prevents bibtex from  finding
              certain bib or bst files. Then <u>$bibtex_fudge</u> needs to be set to 0.

       <b>$bibtex_silent_switch</b> <b>["-terse"]</b>
              Switch(es) for the BibTeX processing program when silent mode is on.

       <b>$bibtex_use</b> <b>[1]</b>
              Under  what  conditions to run <u>bibtex</u> or <u>biber</u>.  When <u>latexmk</u> discovers from the log file that one
              (or more) <u>bibtex</u>/<u>biber</u>-generated bibliographies are used, it can run <u>bibtex</u> or <u>biber</u>  whenever  it
              appears  necessary  to  regenerate  the  bbl  file(s) from their source bib database file(s).  But
              sometimes, the bib file(s) are not available (e.g., for  a  document  obtained  from  an  external
              archive),  but  the  bbl  files  are provided.  In that case use of <u>bibtex</u> or <u>biber</u> will result in
              incorrect overwriting of the precious bbl files.  The variable <u>$bibtex_use</u> controls  whether  this
              happens, and also controls whether or not .bbl files are deleted in a cleanup operation.

              The possible values of <u>$bibtex_use</u> are:
                0: never use <u>bibtex</u> or <u>biber</u>; never delete .bbl files in a cleanup.
                1: only use <u>bibtex</u> or <u>biber</u> if the bib file(s) exist; never
                delete .bbl files in a cleanup.
                1.5: only use <u>bibtex</u> or <u>biber</u> if the bib files exist;
                conditionally delete .bbl files in a cleanup (i.e., delete them only when
                the bib files all exist).
                2:  run <u>bibtex</u> or <u>biber</u> whenever it appears necessary to update the bbl file(s), without testing
              for the existence of the bib files; always delete .bbl files in a cleanup.

              <u>Note</u>: When <u>biber</u> is being used, conditional use of <u>biber</u> can be problematic.  From <u>latexmk</u>'s point
              of view the problem is that because of how <u>biber</u> works, a full knowledge of its source  files  can
              only  be  obtained  after  running  <u>biber</u>.  In contrast, for <u>bibtex</u>, full information on which bib
              files are used is obtained from the .aux file(s) after a  run  of  *latex.   But  for  <u>biber</u>,  the
              corresponding  information  is somewhat incomplete; this the information obtained in the .bcf file
              that is generated by the biblatex package during a run of *latex.

       <b>$cleanup_includes_cusdep_generated</b> <b>[0]</b>
              If nonzero, specifies that cleanup also deletes files that are generated by  custom  dependencies.
              (When doing a clean up, e.g., by use of the <b>-C</b> option, custom dependencies are those listed in the
              <u>.fdb_latexmk</u> file from a previous run.)

       <b>$cleanup_includes_generated</b> <b>[0]</b>
              If  nonzero,  specifies  that  cleanup  also  deletes  files that are detected in the fls file (or
              failing that, in log file) as being generated.  It will also include files made from  these  first
              generation generated files.

              This  operation is somewhat dangerous, and can have unintended consequences, since the files to be
              deleted are determined from a file created by *latex, which  can  contain  erroneous  information.
              Therefore  this  variable is turned off by default, and then files to be deleted are restricted to
              those explicitly specified by patterns configured in the variables <u>clean_ext</u>, <u>clean_full_ext</u>,  and
              <u>@generated_exts</u>.   Standard  cases  (e.g.,  .log  files) appear in <u>latexmk</u>'s initial value for the
              array <u>@generated_exts</u>.

       <b>$cleanup_mode</b> <b>[0]</b>
              If nonzero, specifies cleanup mode: 1 for full cleanup, 2 for cleanup except  for  .dvi,  .ps  and
              .pdf  files,  3  for  cleanup  except  for  dep  and  aux files.  (There is also extra cleaning as
              specified by the <u>$clean_ext</u>, <u>$clean_full_ext</u> and <u>@generated_exts</u> variables.)

              This variable is equivalent to specifying one of the <b>-c</b> or <b>-C</b> options.  But  there  should  be  no
              need to set this variable from an RC file.

       <b>$clean_ext</b> <b>[""]</b>
              Extra  extensions  of  files  for <u>latexmk</u> to remove when any of the clean-up options (<b>-c</b> or <b>-C</b>) is
              selected.  The value of this variable is a string containing the extensions separated by spaces.

              It is also possible to specify a more general pattern of file to be deleted, by  using  the  place
              holder %R, as in commands, and it is also possible to use wildcards.  Thus setting

                  $clean_ext = "out %R-blx.bib %R-figures*.log pythontex-files-%R/*";

              in  an initialization file will imply that when a clean-up operation is specified, not only is the
              standard set of files deleted, but also files of the form FOO.out, FOO-blx.bib,  FOO-figures*.log,
              and  pythontex-files-FOO/*,  where  FOO stands for the basename of the file being processed (as in
              FOO.tex).

              Most of the files to be deleted are relative to the directory specified by <u>$aux_dir</u>.  Note that if
              <u>$out_dir</u> but not <u>$aux_dir</u> is set, then in its  initialization,  <u>latexmk</u>  sets  <u>$aux_dir</u>  equal  to
              <u>$out_dir</u>.   A  normal situation is therefore that <u>$aux_dir</u> equals <u>$out_dir</u>, which is the only case
              directly supported by TeXLive, unlike MiKTeX.  Note  that  even  with  TeXLive  latexmk  does  now
              support different values for the directories -- see the explanation of the <u>$emulate_aux</u> variable.

              If  <u>$out_dir</u>  and <u>$aux_dir</u> different, latexmk actually deletes any files of the specified names in
              both <u>$aux_dir</u> and <u>$out_dir</u>; this is because under certain error conditions, the files may  be  put
              in  <u>$out_dir</u> instead of <u>$aux_dir</u>.  This also handles the case of deleting any fls file, since that
              file is in <u>$out_dir</u>.

              The filenames specified for a clean-up operation can refer not only to regular files but  also  to
              directories.   Directories are only deleted if they are empty.  An example of an application is to
              pythontex, which creates files in a particular directory.  You can  arrange  to  remove  both  the
              files and the directory by setting

                  $clean_ext = "pythontex-files-%R/* pythontex-files-%R";

              See also the (array) variable <u>@generated_exts</u>.  In the past, this variable had certain uses beyond
              that  of  <u>$clean_ext</u>.   But  now,  they accomplish the same things.  In fact, after initialization
              including the processing of command line options, <u>latexmk</u> simply appends the list of extensions in
              <u>$clean_ext</u> to the array <u>@generated_exts</u>.

       <b>$clean_full_ext</b> <b>[""]</b>
              Extra extensions of files for <u>latexmk</u> to remove when the <b>-C</b> option is selected,  i.e.,  extensions
              of files to remove when the .dvi, etc files are to be cleaned-up.

              More general patterns are allowed, as for <u>$clean_ext</u>.

              The  files  specified  by <u>$clean_full_ext</u> to be deleted are relative to the directory specified by
              <u>$out_dir</u>.

       <b>$compiling_cmd</b> <b>[""],</b> <b>$failure_cmd</b> <b>[""],</b> <b>$warning_cmd</b> <b>[""],</b> <b>$success_cmd</b> <b>[""]</b>

              These variables specify commands that  are  executed  at  certain  points  of  compilations.   One
              motivation  for  their  existence  is  to  allow  very  useful  convenient  visual  indications of
              compilation status even when the window receiving the screen output of the compilation is  hidden.
              This is particularly useful in preview-continuous mode.

              The  commands  are  executed  at the following points: <u>$compiling_cmd</u> at the start of compilation,
              <u>$success_cmd</u> at the end of a completely successful compilation, <u>$failure_cmd</u>  at  the  end  of  an
              unsuccessful  compilation,  <u>$warning_cmd</u>  at the of an otherwise successful compilation that gives
              warnings about undefined citations or references or about multiply defined references. If  any  of
              above  variables  is undefined or blank (the default situation), then the corresponding command is
              not executed.

              However, when <u>$warning_cmd</u> is not set, then in the case  of  a  compilation  with  warnings  about
              references  or citations, but with no other error, one or other of <u>$success_cmd</u> or <u>$failure_cmd</u> is
              used (if it is set) according to the setting of <u>$warnings_as_errors</u>.

              An example of a simple setting of these variables is as follows

                  $compiling_cmd = "xdotool search --name \"%D\" set_window --name \"%D compiling\"";
                  $success_cmd   = "xdotool search --name \"%D\" set_window --name \"%D OK\"";
                  $warning_cmd   = "xdotool search --name \"%D\" ".
                                   "set_window --name \"%D CITE/REF ISSUE\"";
                  $failure_cmd   = "xdotool search --name \"%D\" set_window --name \"%D FAILURE\"";

              These assume that the program <u>xdotool</u> is installed, that the previewer is using an X-Window system
              for display, and that the title of the window contains the name  of  the  displayed  file,  as  it
              normally  does.  When the commands are executed, the placeholder string %D is replaced by the name
              of the destination file, which is the previewed file.  The above commands result in an appropriate
              string being appended to the filename in the window title: " compiling", " OK", or " FAILURE".

              Other placeholders that can be used are %S, %T, and %R, with %S and %T normally  being  identical.
              These  can be useful for a command changing the title of the edit window. The visual indication in
              a window title can useful, since the user  does  not  have  to  keep  shifting  attention  to  the
              (possibly hidden) compilation window to know the status of the compilation.

              More  complicated  situations  can  best  be  handled  by defining a Perl subroutine to invoke the
              necessary commands, and using the "internal" keyword in the definitions to get the  subroutine  to
              be invoked.  (See the section "Format of Command Specifications" for how to do this.)

              Naturally,  the  above  settings  that  invoke the <u>xdotool</u> program are only applicable when the X-
              Window system is used for the relevant window(s).  For other cases, you will  have  to  find  what
              software solutions are available.

       <b>@cus_dep_list</b> <b>[()]</b>
              Custom dependency list -- see section on "Custom Dependencies".

       <b>@default_excluded_files</b> <b>[()]</b>
              When  <u>latexmk</u>  is  invoked  with no files specified on the command line, then, by default, it will
              process all files in the current directory with the extension .tex.  (In general, it will  process
              the files specified in the <u>@default_files</u> variable.)

              But  sometimes  you want to exclude particular files from this default list.  In that case you can
              specify the excluded files in the array <u>@default_excluded_files</u>.  For example  if  you  wanted  to
              process  all  .tex  files  with the exception of common.tex, which is a not a standard alone LaTeX
              file but a file input by some or all of the others, you could do

                   @default_files = ("*.tex");

                   @default_excluded_files = ("common.tex");

              If you have a variable or large number of files to be processed, this method saves you from having
              to list them in detail in <u>@default_files</u> and having to update the list every time you  change  the
              set of files to be processed.

              Notes:  1.  This  variable has no effect except when no files are specified on the <u>latexmk</u> command
              line.  2. Wildcards are allowed in <u>@default_excluded_files</u>.

       <b>@default_files</b> <b>[("*.tex")]</b>
              Default list of files to be processed.

              If no filenames are specified on the command line, <u>latexmk</u> processes all tex  files  specified  in
              the  <u>@default_files</u>  variable,  which  by default is set to all tex files ("*.tex") in the current
              directory.  This is a convenience: just run <u>latexmk</u> and it will  process  an  appropriate  set  of
              files.   But  sometimes  you  want only some of these files to be processed.  In this case you can
              list the files to be processed by setting <u>@default_files</u> in an initialization file (e.g., the file
              "latexmkrc" in the current directory).  Then if no files are specified on the  command  line  then
              the files you specify by setting <u>@default_files</u> are processed.

              Three examples:

                   @default_files = ("paper_current");

                   @default_files = ("paper1", "paper2.tex");

                   @default_files = ("*.tex", "*.dtx");

              Note  that  more than file may be given, and that the default extension is ".tex".  Wild cards are
              allowed.  The parentheses are because <u>@default_files</u> is an array variable,  i.e.,  a  sequence  of
              filename specifications is possible.

              If   you   want   <u>latexmk</u>   to   process   all   .tex   files  with  a  few  exceptions,  see  the
              <u>@default_excluded_files</u> array variable.

       <b>$dependents_phony</b> <b>[0]</b>
              If a list of dependencies is output, this variable determines whether to include  a  phony  target
              for  each  source file.  If you use the dependents list in a Makefile, the dummy rules work around
              errors make gives if you remove header files without updating the Makefile to match.

       <b>$dependents_list</b> <b>[0]</b>
              Whether to display a list(s) of dependencies at the end of a run.

       <b>$deps_escape</b> <b>["none"]</b>
              This variable determines which kind of escaping of space characters to use  in  dependency  lists.
              The  possible  values  are  "none",  "unix",  "nmake",  corresponding respectively to no escaping,
              escaping with a "\" suitable  for  standard  Unix  make,  and  escaping  with  "^",  suitable  for
              Microsoft's nmake.

              Currently  the  only character escaped is a space, since that is particularly common in file names
              and directory names.  There are other characters that would need escaping if a dependency list  is
              to  be  used as-is by a make program; but those characters (e.g., "$") commonly cause difficulties
              when used for .tex documents.  Moreover, the detailed  rules  for  which  characters  need  to  be
              escaped depends on the version of make.

       <b>$deps_file</b> <b>["-"]</b>
              Name  of  file  to  receive  list(s)  of  dependencies  at  the  end  of  a  run,  to  be  used if
              <u>$dependents_list</u> is set.  If the filename is "-", then the dependency list is set to stdout (i.e.,
              normally the screen).

       <b>$do_cd</b> <b>[0]</b>
              Whether to change working directory to the directory specified for the  main  source  file  before
              processing  it.   The  default  behavior  is  not to do this, which is the same as the behavior of
              <u>*latex</u> programs.  This variable is set by the <b>-cd</b> and <b>-cd-</b> options on <u>latexmk</u>'s command line.

       <b>$dvi_filter</b> <b>[empty]</b>
              The dvi file filter to be run on the newly produced dvi file before other processing.   Equivalent
              to specifying the <b>-dF</b> option.

       <b>$dvilualatex</b> <b>["dvilualatex</b> <b>%O</b> <b>%S"]</b>
              Specifies  the  command line to invoke the dvilualatex program.  Note that as with other programs,
              you can use this variable not just to change the name  of  the  program  used,  but  also  specify
              options to the program.  E.g.,

                                  $dvilualatex = "dvilualatex --src-specials %O %S";

              To  do  a  coordinated setting of all of <u>$dvilualatex</u>, <u>$hilatex</u>, <u>$latex</u>, <u>$pdflatex</u>, <u>$lualatex</u>, and
              <u>$xelatex</u>, see the section "Advanced Configuration".

       <b>$dvi_mode</b> <b>[See</b> <b>below</b> <b>for</b> <b>default]</b>
              If one, generate a dvi version of the document by use of latex.  Equivalent to the <b>-dvi</b> option.

              If 2, generate a dvi version of the document by use of dvilualatex.   Equivalent  to  the  <b>-dvilua</b>
              option.

              The variable $dvi_mode defaults to 0, but if no explicit requests are made for other types of file
              (postscript,  pdf),  then  $dvi_mode  will  be set to 1.  In addition, if a request for a file for
              which a .dvi file is a prerequisite and $dvi_mode is zero, then $dvi_mode is set to 1.

       <b>$dvilualatex_silent_switch</b> <b>["-interaction=batchmode"]</b>
              Switch(es) for the <u>dvilualatex</u> program (specified in the variable <u>$dvilualatex</u>) when  silent  mode
              is on.

              See   details   of  the  <u>$latex_silent_switch</u>  for  other  information  that  equally  applies  to

       <b>$dvi_previewer</b> <b>["start</b> <b>xdvi</b> <b>%O</b> <b>%S"</b> <b>under</b> <b>UNIX]</b>
              The command to invoke a dvi-previewer.  [Under MS-Windows the default  is  "start";  then  <u>latexmk</u>
              arranges  to  use  the  MS-Windows  <u>start</u> program, which will cause to be run whatever command the
              system has associated with .dvi files.]

              <b>Important</b> <b>note</b>: Normally you will want to have a previewer run detached, so that  <u>latexmk</u>  doesn't
              wait for the previewer to terminate before continuing its work.  So normally you should prefix the
              command  by  "start  ",  which  flags  to <u>latexmk</u> that it should do the detaching of the previewer
              itself (by whatever method is appropriate to the operating system).  But sometimes letting <u>latexmk</u>
              do the detaching is not appropriate (for a variety of non-trivial reasons), so you should put  the
              "start " bit in yourself, whenever it is needed.

       <b>$dvi_previewer_landscape</b> <b>["start</b> <b>xdvi</b> <b>%O</b> <b>%S"]</b>
              The  command  to  invoke  a  dvi-previewer  in  landscape  mode.  [Under MS-Windows the default is
              "start"; then <u>latexmk</u> arranges to use the MS-Windows <u>start</u> program, which will  cause  to  be  run
              whatever command the system has associated with .dvi files.]

       <b>$dvipdf</b> <b>["dvipdf</b> <b>-dALLOWPSTRANSPARENCY</b> <b>%O</b> <b>%S</b> <b>%D"]</b>
              Command  to  convert  .dvi  to .pdf file.  A common reconfiguration is to use the dvipdfm command,
              which needs its arguments in a different order:

                   $dvipdf = "dvipdfm %O -o %D %S";

              WARNING: The default dvipdf script generates pdf files with bitmapped fonts,  which  do  not  look
              good  when  viewed by acroread.  That script should be modified to give dvips the options "-P pdf"
              to ensure that type 1 fonts are used in the pdf file.

       <b>$dvipdf_silent_switch</b> <b>["-q"]</b>
              Switch(es) for dvipdf program when silent mode is on.

              N.B. The standard dvipdf program runs silently, so adding the silent switch has no effect, but  is
              actually innocuous.  But if an alternative program is used, e.g., dvipdfmx, then the silent switch
              has an effect.  The default setting is correct for <u>dvipdfm</u> and <u>dvipdfmx</u>.

       <b>$dvips</b> <b>["dvips</b> <b>%O</b> <b>-o</b> <b>%D</b> <b>%S"]</b>
              The  program  to  used  as  a  filter to convert a .dvi file to a .ps file.  If pdf is going to be
              generated from pdf, then the value of the <u>$dvips_pdf_switch</u> variable  --  see  below  --  will  be

       <b>$dvi_update_command</b> <b>[""]</b>
              When the dvi previewer is set to be updated by running a command, this is the command that is run.
              See  the  information  for  the  variable  <u>$dvi_update_method</u>  for  further  information,  and see
              information on the variable <u>$pdf_update_method</u> for an example for the  analogous  case  of  a  pdf
              previewer.

       <b>$dvi_update_method</b> <b>[2</b> <b>under</b> <b>UNIX,</b> <b>1</b> <b>under</b> <b>MS-Windows]</b>
              How  the  dvi  viewer  updates  its  display when the dvi file has changed.  The values here apply
              equally to the <u>$pdf_update_method</u> and to the <u>$ps_update_method</u> variables.

              for <u>xdvi</u> on a UNIX system.

       <b>$emulate_aux</b> <b>[1]</b>
              Whether to emulate the use of aux directory when $aux_dir and $out_dir are different, rather  than
              using  the  <b>-aux-directory</b>  option  for the *latex programs.  (MiKTeX supports <b>-aux-directory</b>, but
              TeXLive doesn't.)

              If you use a version of *latex that doesn't support <b>-aux-directory</b>, e.g.,  TeXLive,  latexmk  will
              automatically  switch aux_dir emulation on after the first run of *latex, because it will find the
              .log file in the wrong place.  But it is better to set  <u>$emulate_aux</u>  to  1  in  an  rc  file,  or
              equivalently  to  use  the  <b>-emulate-aux-dir</b>  option.  This emulation mode works equally well with
              MiKTeX.

              Aux directory emulation means that when *latex is invoked, the <u>output</u> directory provided to *latex
              is set to be the desired aux directory. After that, any files  that  need  to  be  in  the  output
              directory  will  be  moved there by latexmk. (These are the files with extensions .dvi, .ps, .pdf,
              .synctex, .synctex.gz, and, depending on the setting of the <u>$fls_uses_out_dir</u> variable,  also  the
              .fls file.)

       <b>$failure_cmd</b> <b>[undefined]</b>
              See the documentation for <u>$compiling_cmd</u>.

       <b>$fdb_ext</b> <b>["fdb_latexmk"]</b>
              The  extension  of the file which <u>latexmk</u> generates to contain a database of information on source
              files.  You will not normally need to change this.

       <b>@file_not_found</b>
              This an array of Perl regular expressions that are patterns to find messages in the .log file from
              a run of *latex that indicate that a file was looked for  and  not  found.   To  see  the  current
              default set, you should look at the definition of <u>@file_not_found</u> in the latexmk.pl file.

              In  the  regular  expression,  the  string  for the name of the missing file should be enclosed in
              parentheses.  That carries the implication that after latexmk  gets  a  successful  match  to  the
              pattern, the variable $1 is set to the filename, which is then picked up by latexmk.

              If  you  happen  to encounter a package that gives a missing file message of a different form than
              one that matches one of the built-in patterns, you can add  another  pattern  to  the  array.   An
              example would be

                  push @file_not_found, '^No file\\s+(.+)\\s*$';

              The regular expression itself is

                   ^Missing file\s+(.+)\s*$

              But  the  corresponding  string  specification  in  the push statement has to have the backslashes
              doubled.

              This regular expression matches a line that starts with 'No file', then  has  one  or  more  white
              space  characters,  then any number of characters forming the filename, then possible white space,
              and finally the end of the line.  (See documentation on Perl regular expressions for details.)

       <b>$filetime_causality_threshold</b> <b>[5]</b>
              The use of this variable is as follows:  At a number of places, latexmk needs to determine whether
              a particular file has been produced during  a  just-concluded  run  of  some  rule/program  or  is
              leftover from a previous run. (An example is the production of a .bcf file by the biblatex package
              during  a run of *latex to provide bibliographic information to the biber program.  If a .bcf file
              is not produced during a current run of *latex, but is leftover from a previous run, then  latexmk
              has to conclude that the .tex document has changed so that biber is no longer to be used.)

              Latexmk's  criterion  that  a file has been produced during a run is that the modification time of
              the file is more recent than the system time at the beginning  of  the  run.   Bascially,  if  the
              modification  time  is  earlier  than this, then it is a leftover from a previous run.  However, a
              naive use of the criterion can, among other things, run afoul of the granularity of how file times
              are stored in some file systems, which means it is possible that the  filesystem's  reported  time
              for  a  file  might  be  a  second  or  more  earlier than the actual modification time, the exact
              difference being quite random.

              The variable <u>$filetime_causality_threshold</u> allows an appopriate sloppiness  in  latexmk's  use  of
              file modification time.  It can be quite generous; it should merely be less than the time scale on
              which a human user makes changes to source files for a document (or to configuration files, etc).

       <b>$fls_uses_out_dir</b> <b>[0]</b>
              This variable determines whether or not the .fls file should be in the output directory instead of
              the  natural  directory, which is the aux directory.  If the variable is nonzero, the .fls file is
              to be in the output directory.  See the section AUXILIARY AND OUTPUT DIRECTORIES for more  details
              about  these  directories.   The  rationale for the existence of the variable <u>$fls_uses_aux_dir</u> is
              explained there.

              In all cases, if <u>latexmk</u> finds that an .fls file has been generated in the opposite  directory  to
              the  one  specified by <u>$fls_uses_out_dir</u>, it copies the file to the other directory (aux or output
              directory as appropriate).  The file is copied  rather  than  simply  moved,  to  avoid  potential
              clashes  with  other  software  that  assumes  the  .fls file is generated in the directory it was
              written to by *latex. Thus the effect an incorrect setting of <u>$fls_uses_out_dir</u> is only to cause a
              superfluous copy of the .fls file to be generated.

       <b>$force_mode</b> <b>[0]</b>
              If nonzero, continue processing past minor <u>latex</u> errors including unrecognized  cross  references.
              Equivalent to specifying the <b>-f</b> option.

       <b>@generated_exts</b> <b>[(</b> <b>'aux',</b> <b>'bcf',</b> <b>'fls',</b> <b>'idx',</b> <b>'ind',</b> <b>'lof',</b> <b>'lot',</b> <b>'out',</b> <b>'toc',</b> <b>'blg',</b> <b>'ilg',</b> <b>'log',</b>
       <b>'xdv'</b> <b>)]</b>

              This contains a list of extensions for files that are generated during processing, and that should
              be  deleted  during a main clean up operation, as invoked by the command line option <b>-c</b>.  (The use
              of <b>-C</b> or <b>-gg</b> gives this clean up and more.)

              The default values are extensions for standard files generated by *latex, bibtex,  and  the  like.
              (Note  that  the  clean  up  also  deletes  the fdb_latexmk file, but that's separately coded into
              latexmk, currently.)

              After initialization of latexmk and the processing of its command line, the items in <u>clean_ext</u> are
              appended to <u>@generated_exts</u>.  So these two variables have the  same  meaning  (contrary  to  older
              versions of latexmk).

              The  items in <u>@generated_exts</u> are normally extensions of files, whose base name is the same as the
              main tex file.  But it is also possible to specify patterns including that basename  ---  see  the
              explanation of the variable <u>$clean_ext</u>.

              In  addition  to specifying files to be deleted in a clean up, latexmk uses the same specification
              to assist its examination of changes in source files: Under some situations it needs to find those
              changes in files (since a previous run) that are expected to be due to the user  editing  a  file.
              This  contrasts with the cases of files that are generated by some program run by latexmk and that
              differ from the results of the previous run.  This use of <u>@generated_exts</u> is normally unimportant,
              given the usual accuracy of latexmk's other ways of determining these generated files.

              A convenient way to add an extra extension to the list, without losing the already defined ones is
              to use a push command in the line in an RC file.  E.g.,

                              push @generated_exts, "end";

              adds the extension "end" to the list of predefined generated extensions.  (This extension is  used
              by the RevTeX package, for example.)

       <b>$go_mode</b> <b>[0]</b>
              If nonzero, process files regardless of timestamps, and is then equivalent to the <b>-g</b> option.

       <b>%hash_calc_ignore_pattern</b>
              <b>!!!This</b> <b>variable</b> <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>experts</b> <b>only!!!</b>

              The  general rule <u>latexmk</u> uses for determining when an extra run of some program is needed is that
              one of the source files has changed.  But consider for example a  latex  package  that  causes  an
              encapsulated  postscript  file  (an  "eps" file) to be made that is to be read in on the next run.
              The file contains a comment line giving its creation date and time.  On  the  next  run  the  time
              changes,  <u>latex</u>  sees  that  the eps file has changed, and therefore reruns latex.  This causes an
              infinite loop, that is only terminated because <u>latexmk</u> has a limit on the number of runs to  guard
              against pathological situations.

              But the changing line has no real effect, since it is a comment.  You can instruct <u>latex</u> to ignore
              the offending line as follows:

                 $hash_calc_ignore_pattern{'eps'} = '^%%CreationDate: ';

              This  creates a rule for files with extension <u>.eps</u> about lines to ignore.  The left-hand side is a
              <u>Perl</u> idiom for setting an item in a hash.  Note that the file extension  is  specified  without  a
              period.   The  value,  on  the right-hand side, is a string containing a regular expression.  (See
              documentation on <u>Perl</u> for how they are to be  specified  in  general.)   This  particular  regular
              expression  specifies  that  lines beginning with "%%CreationDate: " are to be ignored in deciding
              whether a file of the given extension <u>.eps</u> has changed.

              There is only one regular expression available for each extension.  If you need more  one  pattern
              to  specify  lines  to  ignore,  then  you  need  to  combine  the  patterns into a single regular
              expression.  The simplest method is separate the different  simple  patterns  by  a  vertical  bar
              character (indicating "alternation" in the jargon of regular expressions).  For example,

                 $hash_calc_ignore_pattern{'eps'} = '^%%CreationDate: |^%%Title: ';

              causes lines starting with either "^%%CreationDate: " or "^%%Title: " to be ignored.

              It  may  happen  that  a  pattern  to be ignored is specified in, for example, in a system or user
              initialization file, and you wish to remove this in a file that is read later.  To  do  this,  you
              use Perl's delete function, e.g.,

                  delete $hash_calc_ignore_pattern{'eps'};

       <b>$hilatex</b> <b>["hilatex</b> <b>%O</b> <b>%S"]</b>
              specifies the command line for the hilatex program.

       <b>$hnt_mode</b> <b>[0]</b>
              Whether  to generate a hnt version of the document by use of hilatex.  Can be turned on by the use
              of the <b>-hnt</b> option.

       <b>$jobname</b> <b>[""]</b>

              This specifies the jobname, i.e., the basename that is used for generated files (.aux, .log, .dvi,
              .ps, .pdf, etc).  If this variable is a null string, then the basename is the basename of the main
              tex file.  (At present, the string in <u>$jobname</u> should not contain spaces.)

              The placeholder '%A' is permitted. This will be substituted by the basename of the TeX file.   The
              primary  purpose  is  when  a  variety  of  tex  files  are to be processed, and you want to use a
              different jobname for each but one that is distinct for  each.  Thus  if  you  wanted  to  compare
              compilations of a set of files on different operating systems, with distinct filenames for all the
              cases, you could set

                 $jobname = "%A-$^O";

              in an initialization file.  (Here <u>$^O</u> is a variable provided by perl that contains perl's name for
              the operating system.)

              Suppose you had .tex files test1.tex and test2.tex.  Then when you run

                 latexmk -pdf *.tex

              both  files  will  be  compiled.  The .aux, .log, and .pdf files will have basenames test1-MSWin32
              ante test2-MSWin32 on a MS-Windows system, test1-darwin and test2-darwin on an OS-X system, and  a
              variety of similar cases on linux systems.

       <b>$kpsewhich</b> <b>["kpsewhich</b> <b>%S"]</b>
              The  program called to locate a source file when the name alone is not sufficient.  Most filenames
              used by <u>latexmk</u> have sufficient path information to be found  directly.   But  sometimes,  notably
              when a .bib or a .bst file is found from the log file of a <u>bibtex</u> or <u>biber</u> run, only the base name
              of the file is known, but not its path. The program specified by <u>$kpsewhich</u> is used to find it.

              (<u>For</u>  <u>advanced</u>  <u>users:</u> Because of the different way in which <u>latexmk</u> uses the command specified in
              <u>$kpsewhich</u>, some of the possibilities listed in the FORMAT OF COMMAND SPECIFICATIONS do not apply.
              The <u>internal</u> and <u>start</u> keywords are not available. A simple command  specification  with  possible
              options  and  then  "%S" is all that is guaranteed to work.  Note that for other commands, "%S" is
              substituted by a single source file. In contrast, for <u>$kpsewhich</u>, "%S" may  be  substituted  by  a
              long  list of space-separated filenames, each of which is quoted.  The result on STDOUT of running
              the command is then piped to <u>latexmk</u>.)

              See also the <u>@BIBINPUTS</u> variable for another way that <u>latexmk</u> also uses to try to locate files; it
              applies only in the case of .bib files.

       <b>$kpsewhich_show</b> <b>[0]</b>
              Whether to show diagnostics about invocations of <u>kpsewhich</u>: the command line use to invoke it  and
              the results.  These diagnostics are shown if <u>$kpsewhich_show</u> is non-zero or if diagnostics mode is
              on.   (But  in  the  second  case,  lots  of  other  diagnostics  are  also shown.)  Without these
              diagnostics there is nothing visible in <u>latexmk</u>'s screen output about invocations of <u>kpsewhich</u>.

       <b>$landscape_mode</b> <b>[0]</b>
              If nonzero, run in landscape mode, using the landscape  mode  previewers  and  dvi  to  postscript
              converters.  Equivalent to the <b>-l</b> option.  Normally not needed with current previewers.

       <b>$latex</b> <b>["latex</b> <b>%O</b> <b>%S"]</b>
              Specifies  the  command  line for the LaTeX processing program.  Note that as with other programs,
              you can use this variable not just to change the name  of  the  program  used,  but  also  specify
              options to the program.  E.g.,

                                  $latex = "latex --src-specials %O %S";

              To  do  a  coordinated setting of all of <u>$dvilualatex</u>, <u>$hilatex</u>, <u>$latex</u>, <u>$pdflatex</u>, <u>$lualatex</u>, and
              <u>$xelatex</u>, see the section "Advanced Configuration".

       <b>%latex_input_extensions</b>
              This variable specifies the extensions tried by <u>latexmk</u> when it finds that a LaTeX run resulted in
              an error that a file has not been found, and  the  file  is  given  without  an  extension.   This
              typically  happens  when LaTeX commands of the form \input{file} or \includegraphics{figure}, when
              the relevant source file does not exist.

              In this situation, <u>latexmk</u> searches for custom dependencies  to  make  the  missing  file(s),  but
              restricts  it  to  the  extensions specified by the variable %latex_input_extensions.  The default
              extensions are 'tex' and 'eps'.

              (For Perl experts: %latex_input_extensions is a hash whose keys are the  extensions.   The  values
              are  irrelevant.)   Two  subroutines  are  provided for manipulating this and the related variable
              %pdflatex_input_extensions, add_input_ext and remove_input_ext.  They are used as in the following
              examples are possible lines in an initialization file:

                  remove_input_ext( 'latex', 'tex' );

              removes the extension 'tex' from latex_input_extensions

                  add_input_ext( 'latex', 'asdf' );

              add the extension 'asdf to latex_input_extensions.  (Naturally with such an extension, you  should
              have  made an appropriate custom dependency for <u>latexmk</u>, and should also have done the appropriate
              programming in the LaTeX source file to enable the file to be read.  The standard  extensions  are
              handled by LaTeX and its graphics/graphicx packages.)

       <b>$latex_silent_switch</b> <b>["-interaction=batchmode"]</b>
              Switch(es) for the LaTeX processing program when silent mode is on.

              If  you  use  MikTeX, you may prefer the results if you configure the options to include -c-style-
              errors, e.g., by the following line in an initialization file

                $latex_silent_switch = "-interaction=batchmode -c-style-errors";

       <b>$lpr</b> <b>["lpr</b> <b>%O</b> <b>%S"</b> <b>under</b> <b>UNIX/Linux,</b> <b>"NONE</b> <b>lpr"</b> <b>under</b> <b>MS-Windows]</b>
              The command to print postscript files.

              Under MS-Windows (unlike UNIX/Linux), there is no standard program for printing files.  But  there
              are  ways  you  can  do  it.  For example, if you have <u>gsview</u> installed, you could use it with the
              option "/p":

                  $lpr = '"c:/Program Files/Ghostgum/gsview/gsview32.exe" /p';

              If <u>gsview</u> is installed in a different directory, you will need to  make  the  appropriate  change.
              Note  the combination of single and double quotes around the name.  The single quotes specify that
              this is a string to be assigned to the configuration variable <u>$lpr</u>.  The double quotes are part of
              the string passed to the operating system to get the command obeyed; this is necessary because one
              part  of  the  command  name  ("Program  Files")  contains  a  space  which  would  otherwise   be
              misinterpreted.

       <b>$lpr_dvi</b> <b>["NONE</b> <b>lpr_dvi"]</b>
              The printing program to print dvi files.

       <b>$lpr_pdf</b> <b>["NONE</b> <b>lpr_pdf"]</b>
              The printing program to print pdf files.

              Under MS-Windows you could set this to use <u>gsview</u>, if it is installed, e.g.,

                  $lpr = '"c:/Program Files/Ghostgum/gsview/gsview32.exe" /p';

              If  <u>gsview</u>  is  installed  in a different directory, you will need to make the appropriate change.
              Note the double quotes around the name: this is necessary because one part  of  the  command  name
              ("Program Files") contains a space which would otherwise be misinterpreted.

       <b>$lualatex</b> <b>["lualatex</b> <b>%O</b> <b>%S"]</b>
              Specifies  the  command line for the LaTeX processing program that is to be used when the <u>lualatex</u>
              program is called for (e.g., by the option <b>-lualatex</b>.

              To do a coordinated setting of all of <u>$dvilualatex</u>, <u>$hilatex</u>, <u>$latex</u>,  <u>$pdflatex</u>,  <u>$lualatex</u>,  and

       <b>%lualatex_input_extensions</b>
              This variable specifies the extensions tried by <u>latexmk</u> when it finds that a <u>lualatex</u> run resulted
              in  an  error  that  a  file has not been found, and the file is given without an extension.  This
              typically happens when LaTeX commands of the form \input{file} or  \includegraphics{figure},  when
              the relevant source file does not exist.

       <b>$make</b> <b>["make"]</b>
              The make processing program.

              The index processing program.

              When  using makeindex, whether to change directory to $aux_dir before running makeindex.  Set to 1
              if $aux_dir is not an explicit subdirectory of current directory, otherwise makeindex will  refuse
              to write its output and log files, for security reasons.

              <b>Switch(es)</b> for the index processing program when silent mode is on.

       <b>$max_repeat</b> <b>[5]</b>
              The  maximum number of times <u>latexmk</u> will run <u>*latex</u> before deciding that there may be an infinite
              loop and that it needs to  bail  out,  rather  than  rerunning  <u>*latex</u>  again  to  resolve  cross-
              references, etc.  The default value covers all normal cases.

              (Note  that  the "etc" covers a lot of cases where one run of <u>*latex</u> generates files to be read in
              on a later run.)

       <b>$MSWin_back_slash</b> <b>[1]</b>
              This configuration variable only has an effect when <u>latexmk</u> is running under MS-Windows.  With the
              default value of 1 for this variable,  when  a  command  is  executed  under  MS-Windows,  <u>latexmk</u>
              substitutes  "\"  for the separator character between components of a directory name.  Internally,
              <u>latexmk</u> uses "/" for the directory separator character, which is the character used  by  Unix-like
              systems.

              For  almost  all  programs  and  for  almost  all filenames under MS-Windows, both "\" and "/" are
              acceptable as the directory separator character, provided at least  that  filenames  are  properly
              quoted.   But  it  is possible that programs exist that only accept "\" on the command line, since
              that is the standard directory  separator  for  MS-Windows.   So  for  safety  <u>latexmk</u>  makes  the
              substitution from "/" to "\", by default.

              However  there  are  also  programs  on  MS-Windows  for  which  a  back  slash "\" is interpreted
              differently than as a directory separator; for  these  the  directory  separator  should  be  "/".
              Programs with this behavior include all the *latex programs in the TeXLive implementation (but not
              the MiKTeX implementation).  Hence if you use TeXLive on MS-Windows, then <u>$MSWin_back_slash</u> should
              be set to zero.

       <b>$new_viewer_always</b> <b>[0]</b>
              This  variable  applies  to  <u>latexmk</u> <b>only</b> in continuous-preview mode.  If <u>$new_viewer_always</u> is 0,
              <u>latexmk</u> will check for a previously running previewer on the same file, and if one is running will
              not start a new one.  If <u>$new_viewer_always</u> is non-zero, this check will be skipped,  and  <u>latexmk</u>
              will behave as if no viewer is running.

       <b>$out_dir</b> <b>[""]</b>
              If non-blank, this variable specifies the output directory.

              This  is  the  directory  in  which  the  main  output  files  are written (dvi, ps, pdf, synctex,
              synctex.gz).  In addition, if the aux directory equals the output directory, as  is  the  case  by
              default, then other generated files are in effect written to the output directory.

              If  <u>$out_dir</u>  is blank, the output directory is the current directory at the invocation of *latex;
              this is equivalent to setting <u>$out_dir</u> to '.'.

              See the section AUXILIARY AND OUTPUT DIRECTORIES for more details.

       <b>$out2_dir</b> <b>[""]</b>
              (<u>Experimental</u> <u>new</u> <u>feature.</u>)

              If non-blank, this variable specifies the final-output directory,  i.e.,  the  directory  for  the
              final  output files.  If this variable is blank (its default value), the final-output directory is
              the same as the output directory.

              See the description of the option <b>-out2dir</b> for an explanation of the rationale  for  the  idea  of
              separate output and final-output directories.

              If  the  final-output directory is different from the output directory, then after a full round of
              compilations of the document, the relevant set of files is copied here from the output  directory.
              The  files  copied  are  specified  by  the  <u>@out2_exts</u>  variable,  and  by default are those with
              extensions 'hnt', 'pdf', 'ps', 'synctex', 'synctex.gz', and a basename the same as  for  the  main
              *latex compilation.

       <b>@out2_exts</b> <b>[(</b> <b>'hnt',</b> <b>'pdf',</b> <b>'ps',</b> <b>'synctex',</b> <b>'synctex.gz'</b> <b>)]</b>

              This  variable  lists  the extensions of the files to be copied to the final-output directory. The
              basename of the files is that  for  the  main  *latex  compilation  (corresponding  to  the  value
              specified  by the placeholder %R).  More general names may be specified in the same way as for the
              <u>@generated_exts</u> variable, by inclusion of %R in a pattern, e.g.,

                  push @out2_exts, '%R-2up.pdf';

       <b>$pdf_mode</b> <b>[0]</b>
              If zero, do NOT generate a pdf version of the document.  If equal to 1, generate a pdf version  of
              the  document  using <u>pdflatex</u>, using the command specified by the <u>$pdflatex</u> variable.  If equal to
              2, generate a pdf version of the document from the ps file, by using the command specified by  the
              <u>$ps2pdf</u>  variable.   If  equal  to 3, generate a pdf version of the document from the dvi file, by
              using the command specified by the <u>$dvipdf</u> variable.  If equal to 4, generate a pdf version of the
              document using <u>lualatex</u>, using the command specified by the <u>$lualatex</u> variable.  If  equal  to  5,
              generate  a  pdf  version  (and  an xdv version) of the document using <u>xelatex</u>, using the commands
              specified by the <u>$xelatex</u> and <u>xdvipdfmx</u> variables.

              In <u>$pdf_mode</u>=2, it is ensured that .dvi and .ps files  are  also  made.   In  <u>$pdf_mode</u>=3,  it  is
              ensured that a .dvi file is also made.  But this may be overridden by the document.

       <b>$pdflatex</b> <b>["pdflatex</b> <b>%O</b> <b>%S"]</b>
              Specifies  the  command  line  for the LaTeX processing program in a version that makes a pdf file
              instead of a dvi file.

              An example use of this variable is to add certain options to the command  line  for  the  program,
              e.g.,

                   $pdflatex = "pdflatex --shell-escape %O %S";

              (In  some  earlier  versions of <u>latexmk</u>, you needed to use an assignment to <u>$pdflatex</u> to allow the
              use of <u>lualatex</u> or <u>xelatex</u> instead of <u>pdflatex</u>.  There are now  separate  configuration  variables
              for the use of <u>lualatex</u> or <u>xelatex</u>.  See <u>$lualatex</u> and <u>$xelatex</u>.)

              Switch(es) for the <u>pdflatex</u> program (specified in the variable <u>$pdflatex</u>) when silent mode is on.

              See   details   of  the  <u>$latex_silent_switch</u>  for  other  information  that  equally  applies  to
              <u>$pdflatex_silent_switch</u>.

       <b>$pdf_previewer</b> <b>["start</b> <b>acroread</b> <b>%O</b> <b>%S"]</b>
              The command to invoke a pdf-previewer.

              On MS-Windows, the default is changed to "cmd /c start """; under more recent versions of Windows,
              this will cause to be run whatever command the system has associated with .pdf  files.   But  this
              may  be  undesirable if this association is to <u>acroread</u> -- see the notes in the explanation of the
              <b>-pvc</b> option.]

              On OS-X the default is changed to "open %S", which results in OS-X starting up (and detaching) the
              viewer associated with the file.  By default, for pdf files this association is to OS-X's preview,
              which is quite satisfactory.

              <b>WARNING</b>:  Problem under MS-Windows: if acroread is used as the pdf previewer, and it  is  actually
              viewing a pdf file, the pdf file cannot be updated.  Thus makes acroread a bad choice of previewer
              if  you  use <u>latexmk</u>'s previous-continuous mode (option <b>-pvc</b>) under MS-windows.  This problem does
              not occur if, for example, <u>SumatraPDF</u> or <u>gsview</u> is used to view pdf files.

              <b>Important</b> <b>note</b>: Normally you will want to have a previewer run detached, so that  <u>latexmk</u>  doesn't
              wait for the previewer to terminate before continuing its work.  So normally you should prefix the
              command  by  "start  ",  which  flags  to <u>latexmk</u> that it should do the detaching of the previewer
              itself (by whatever method is appropriate to the operating system).  But sometimes letting <u>latexmk</u>
              do the detaching is not appropriate (for a variety of non-trivial reasons), so you should put  the
              "start " bit in yourself, whenever it is needed.

       <b>$pdf_update_command</b> <b>[""]</b>
              When the pdf previewer is set to be updated by running a command, this is the command that is run.
              See the information for the variable <u>$pdf_update_method</u>.

       <b>$pdf_update_method</b> <b>[1</b> <b>under</b> <b>UNIX,</b> <b>3</b> <b>under</b> <b>MS-Windows]</b>
              How  the  pdf viewer updates its display when the pdf file has changed. See the information on the
              variable <u>$dvi_update_method</u> for the codes.  (Note that information needs be  changed  slightly  so
              that  for the value 4, to run a command to do the update, the command is specified by the variable
              <u>$pdf_update_command</u>, and for the value 2, to specify update by signal, the signal is specified  by
              <u>$pdf_update_signal</u>.)

              Note  that  acroread  under  MS-Windows (but not UNIX) locks the pdf file, so the default value is
              then 3.

              Arranging to use a command to get a previewer explicitly updated requires three  variables  to  be
              set.  For example:

                  $pdf_previewer = "start xpdf -remote %R %O %S";
                  $pdf_update_method = 4;
                  $pdf_update_command = "xpdf -remote %R -reload";

              The  first  setting arranges for the xpdf program to be used in its "remote server mode", with the
              server name specified as the rootname of the TeX file.  The second setting arranges  for  updating
              to be done in response to a command, and the third setting sets the update command.

       <b>$pdf_update_signal</b> <b>[Under</b> <b>UNIX:</b> <b>SIGHUP,</b> <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>system-dependent</b> <b>value]</b>
              The  number of the signal that is sent to the pdf viewer when it is updated by sending a signal --
              see the information on the variable <u>$pdf_update_method</u>.  The default value is the one  appropriate
              for <u>gv</u> on a UNIX system.

       <b>$pid_position[1</b> <b>under</b> <b>UNIX,</b> <b>-1</b> <b>under</b> <b>MS-Windows]</b>
              The  variable  <u>$pid_position</u>  is  used  to  specify  which word in lines of the output from <u>$pscmd</u>
              corresponds to the process ID.  The first word in the line is numbered 0.  The default value of  1
              (2nd  word  in  line)  is  correct for Solaris 2.6, Linux, and OS-X with their default settings of
              <u>$pscmd</u>.

              Setting the variable to -1 is used to indicate that <u>$pscmd</u> is not to be used.

       <b>$postscript_mode</b> <b>[0]</b>
              If nonzero, generate a postscript version of the document.  Equivalent to the <b>-ps</b> option.

              If some other request is made for which a postscript file is needed, then $postscript_mode will be
              set to 1.

       <b>$pre_tex_code</b> <b>['']</b>

              Sets TeX code to be executed before inputting the source file.  This works if the relevant one  of
              <u>$latex</u>,  etc contains a suitable command line with a %P or %U substitution.  For example you could
              do

                   $latex = 'latex %O %P';
                   $pre_tex_code = '\AtBeginDocument{An initial message\par}';

              To  set  all  of  <u>$latex</u>,  <u>$pdflatex</u>,  <u>$lualatex</u>,  and  <u>$xelatex</u>  you  could  use  the  subroutine
              <u>alt_tex_cmds</u>:

                   &amp;alt_tex_cmds;
                   $pre_tex_code = '\AtBeginDocument{An initial message\par}';

       <b>$preview_continuous_mode</b> <b>[0]</b>
              If nonzero, run a previewer to view the document, and continue running <u>latexmk</u> to keep .dvi up-to-
              date.   Equivalent  to the <b>-pvc</b> option.  Which previewer is run depends on the other settings, see
              the command line options <b>-view=</b>, and the variable <u>$view</u>.

       <b>$preview_mode</b> <b>[0]</b>
              If nonzero, run a previewer to preview  the  document.   Equivalent  to  the  <b>-pv</b>  option.   Which
              previewer  is  run  depends  on  the  other settings, see the command line options <b>-view=</b>, and the
              variable <u>$view</u>.

       <b>$printout_mode</b> <b>[0]</b>
              If nonzero, print the document using the command specified in the <u>$lpr</u>  variable.   Equivalent  to
              the  <b>-p</b> option.  This is recommended <b>not</b> to be set from an RC file, otherwise you could waste lots
              of paper.

       <b>$print_type</b> <b>=</b> <b>["auto"]</b>
              Type of file to printout: possibilities are "auto", "dvi",  "none",  "pdf",  or  "ps".    See  the
              option <b>-print=</b> for the meaning of the "auto" value.

       <b>$pscmd</b> Command used to get all the processes currently run by the user.  The -pvc option uses the command
              specified  by  the  variable  <u>$pscmd</u> to determine if there is an already running previewer, and to
              find the process ID (needed if <u>latexmk</u> needs to signal the previewer about file changes).

              Each line of the output of this command  is  assumed  to  correspond  to  one  process.   See  the
              <u>$pid_position</u> variable for how the process number is determined.

              The  default  for <u>pscmd</u> is "NONE" under MS-Windows and cygwin (i.e., the command is not used), "ps
              -ww -u $ENV{USER}" under OS-X, and "ps -f -u $ENV{USER}" under other operating systems  (including
              Linux).  In these specifications "$ENV{USER}" is substituted by the username.

       <b>$ps2pdf</b> <b>["ps2pdf</b> <b>-dALLOWPSTRANSPARENCY</b> <b>%O</b> <b>%S</b> <b>%D"]</b>
              Command to convert .ps to .pdf file.

       <b>$ps_filter</b> <b>[empty]</b>
              The  postscript  file  filter  to  be  run  on  the  newly  produced  postscript file before other
              processing.  Equivalent to specifying the <b>-pF</b> option.

       <b>$ps_previewer</b> <b>["start</b> <b>gv</b> <b>%O</b> <b>%S",</b> <b>but</b> <b>start</b> <b>%O</b> <b>%S</b> <b>under</b> <b>MS-Windows]</b>
              The command to invoke a ps-previewer.  (The default under MS-Windows will cause to be run whatever
              command the system has associated with .ps files.)

              Note that <u>gv</u> could be used with the -watch option updates its display whenever the postscript file
              changes, whereas ghostview does not.  However, different versions of <u>gv</u>  have  slightly  different
              ways of writing this option.  You can configure this variable appropriately.

              <b>WARNING</b>:  Linux  systems  may  have  installed one (or more) versions of <u>gv</u> under different names,
              e.g., <u>ggv</u>, <u>kghostview</u>, etc, but perhaps not one actually called <u>gv</u>.

              <b>Important</b> <b>note</b>: Normally you will want to have a previewer run detached, so that  <u>latexmk</u>  doesn't
              wait for the previewer to terminate before continuing its work.  So normally you should prefix the

       <b>$ps_update_command</b> <b>[""]</b>
              When  the postscript previewer is set to be updated by running a command, this is the command that
              is run.  See the information for the variable <u>$ps_update_method</u>.

       <b>$ps_update_method</b> <b>[0</b> <b>under</b> <b>UNIX,</b> <b>1</b> <b>under</b> <b>MS-Windows]</b>

              on  the  variable  <u>$dvi_update_method</u>  for  the  codes.   (Note  that information needs be changed
              slightly so that for the value 4, to run a command to do the update, the command is  specified  by
              the  variable  <u>$ps_update_command</u>, and for the value 2, to specify update by signal, the signal is

       <b>$ps_update_signal</b> <b>[Under</b> <b>UNIX:</b> <b>SIGHUP,</b> <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>system-dependent</b> <b>value]</b>
              The number of the signal that is sent to the pdf viewer when it is updated by sending a signal  --
              see <u>$ps_update_method</u>.  The default value is the one appropriate for gv on a UNIX system.

       <b>$pvc_timeout</b> <b>[0]</b>
              If  this  variable  is nonzero, there will be a  timeout in pvc mode after a period of inactivity.
              Inactivity means a period when <u>latexmk</u> has detected no file changes and hence has  not  taken  any
              actions   like   compiling   the   document.   The   period  of  inactivity  is  in  the  variable
              $pvc_timeout_mins.

       <b>$pvc_timeout_mins</b> <b>[30]</b>
              The period of inactivity,  in  minutes,  after  which  pvc  mode  times  out.   This  is  used  if
              <u>$pvc_timeout</u> is nonzero.

       <b>$pvc_view_file_via_temporary</b> <b>[1]</b>
              The  same  as  <u>$always_view_file_via_temporary</u>,  except that it only applies in preview-continuous
              mode (-pvc option).

       <b>$quote_filenames</b> <b>[1]</b>
              This specifies whether substitutions for placeholders in command specifications (as in  <u>$pdflatex</u>)
              are surrounded by double quotes.  If this variable is 1 (or any other value Perl regards as true),
              then quoting is done.  Otherwise quoting is omitted.

              The quoting method used by <u>latexmk</u> is tested to work correctly under UNIX systems (including Linux
              and Mac OS-X) and under MS-Windows.  It allows the use of filenames containing special characters,
              notably spaces.  (But note that many versions of <u>*latex</u> cannot correctly deal with TeX files whose
              names contain spaces.  <u>Latexmk</u>'s quoting only ensures that such filenames are correctly treated by
              the operating system in passing arguments to programs.)

       <b>$rc_report</b> <b>[1]</b>
              After initialization, whether to give a list of the RC files read.

       <b>$recorder</b> <b>[1]</b>
              Whether  to use the <b>-recorder</b> option to <u>*latex</u>.  Use of this option results in a file of extension
              <u>.fls</u> containing a list of the files that these programs have read and written.  <u>Latexmk</u> will  then
              use this file to improve its detection of source files and generated files after a run of <u>*latex</u>.

              It  is generally recommended to use this option (or to configure the <u>$recorder</u> variable to be on.)
              But it only works if <u>*latex</u> supports  the  -recorder  option,  which  is  true  for  most  current
              implementations

              <u>Note</u> <u>about</u> <u>the</u> <u>name</u> <u>of</u> <u>the</u> <u>.fls</u> <u>file:</u> Most implementations of <u>*latex</u> produce an .fls file with the
              same basename as the main document's LaTeX, e.g., for Document.tex, the .fls file is Document.fls.
              However,  some  implementations  instead  produce  files named for the program, i.e., latex.fls or
              pdflatex.fls.  In this second case, <u>latexmk</u> copies the latex.fls or pdflatex.fls to  a  file  with
              the basename of the main LaTeX document, e.g., Document.fls.

       <b>$search_path_separator</b> <b>[See</b> <b>below</b> <b>for</b> <b>default]</b>
              The  character  separating paths in the environment variables TEXINPUTS, BIBINPUTS, and BSTINPUTS.
              This variable is mainly used by <u>latexmk</u> when the <b>-outdir</b>, <b>-output-directory</b>, <b>-auxdir</b>, and/or <b>-aux-</b>
              <b>directory</b> options are used.  In that case <u>latexmk</u>  needs  to  communicate  appropriately  modified
              search paths to <u>bibtex</u>, <u>dvipdf</u>, <u>dvips</u>, and <u>*latex</u>.

              [Comment  to  technically  savvy  readers:  <u>*latex</u> doesn't actually need the modified search path.
              But, surprisingly, <u>dvipdf</u> and <u>dvips</u> do, because sometimes graphics  files  get  generated  in  the
              output or aux directories.]

              The  default  under MSWin and Cygwin is ';' and under UNIX-like operating systems (including Linux
              and OS-X) is ':'.  Normally the defaults give correct behavior.  But there can be difficulties  if
              your  operating  system is of one kind, but some of your software is running under an emulator for
              the other kind of operating system; in that case you'll need to find out what is needed,  and  set
              <u>$search_path_separator</u>  explicitly.  (The same goes, of course, for unusual operating systems that
              are not in the MSWin, Linux, OS-X, Unix collection.)

       <b>$show_time</b> <b>[0]</b>
              Whether to show time used, both the total and for individual steps.

              <u>Note</u>: On MS Windows, this is clock time.  On other OSs it is the CPU time used (by latexmk and the
              child processes it invokes).  The OS-dependence is because of a limitation  of  Windows.   If  you
              wish to force the use of clock instead of CPU time, you can set

                  $times_are_clock = 1;

       <b>$silence_logfile_warnings</b> <b>[0]</b>
              Whether  after a run of *latex to summarize warnings in the log file about undefined citations and
              references.  Setting $silence_logfile_warnings=0 gives the summary of  warnings  (provided  silent
              mode  isn't  also  set),  and  this is useful to locate undefined citations and references without
              searching through the much more verbose log file or the screen output of *latex.  But the  summary
              can  also  be  excessively annoying.  The default is not to give these warnings.  The command line
              options <b>-silence_logfile_warning_list</b> and <b>-silence_logfile_warning_list-</b> also set this variable.

              Note that multiple occurrences for the same undefined object on the same page and same  line  will
              be compressed to a single warning.

       <b>$silent</b> <b>[0]</b>
              Whether  to  run  silently.   Setting  $silent  to  1 has the same effect as the <b>-quiet</b> of <b>-silent</b>
              options on the command line.

       <b>$sleep_time</b> <b>[2]</b>
              The time to sleep (in seconds) between checking for source-file changes when running with the <b>-pvc</b>
              option.  If non-zero, it is subject to a minimum value give by the <u>$min_sleep_time</u> variable.   But
              a zero value is also allowed.

              A  value  of exactly 0 gives no delay between checks for source-file changes; it typically results
              in 100% CPU usage, which may not be desirable.

              In old versions of latexmk, the defaulB-pvcumode <u>$sleep_ti<b>m</b>e$texfile_search <b>[""]</b>
              This is an obsolete variable, replaced by the <u>@default_files</u> variable.

              For  backward  compatibility,  if  you  choose  to  set  <u>$texfile_search</u>, it is a string of space-
              separated  filenames,  and  then  <u>latexmk</u>  replaces   <u>@default_files</u>   with   the   filenames   in
              <u>$texfile_search</u> to which is added "*.tex".

       <b>$success_cmd</b> <b>[undefined]</b>
              See the documentation for $compiling_cmd.

       <b>$tmpdir</b> <b>[See</b> <b>below</b> <b>for</b> <b>default]</b>
              Directory to store temporary files that <u>latexmk</u> may generate while running.

              The  default  under  MSWindows  (including cygwin), is to set <u>$tmpdir</u> to the value of the first of
              whichever of the system environment variables TMPDIR or TEMP  exists,  otherwise  to  the  current
              directory.  Under other operating systems (expected to be UNIX/Linux, including OS-X), the default
              is the value of the system environment variable TMPDIR if it exists, otherwise "<a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a>".

       <b>$use_make_for_missing_files</b> <b>[0]</b>
              Whether  to use <u>make</u> to try and make files that are missing after a run of <u>*latex</u>, and for which a
              custom dependency has not been found.  This is generally useful only when <u>latexmk</u> is used as  part
              of a bigger project which is built by using the <u>make</u> program.

              Note that once a missing file has been made, no further calls to <u>make</u> will be made on a subsequent
              run  of  <u>latexmk</u>  to  update  the  file.   Handling  this problem is the job of a suitably defined
              Makefile.  See the section "USING <u>latexmk</u> WITH <u>make</u>" for how to do this.  The  intent  of  calling
              <u>make</u> from <u>latexmk</u> is merely to detect dependencies.

       <b>$user_deleted_file_treated_as_changed</b> <b>[0]</b>
              Whether  when  testing  for  changed  files, a user file that changes status from existing to non-
              existing should be regarded as changed.

              The default value is 0, which implies that if a user file (as opposed to  a  generated  file)  has
              been  deleted since the previous run, then no recompilation should be done.  The reasoning is that
              a rerun would simply produce an error.

              If the value is 1, then disappearance of a user file is treated as triggering a rerun, but only in
              non-preview-continuous mode.

              If the value is 2, then disappearance of a user file is treated as triggering a rerun, always.

       <b>$view</b> <b>["default"]</b>
              Which kind of file is to be previewed if a previewer is used.  The possible values are  "default",
              "dvi",  "hnt",  "ps", "pdf", "none".  The value of "default" means that the "highest" of the kinds
              of file generated is to be used (among .dvi, .hnt, .ps and .pdf).

       <b>$warnings_as_errors</b> <b>[0]</b>
              Normally <u>latexmk</u> copies the behavior of <u>latex</u> in treating undefined references and  citations  and
              multiply  defined  references  as  conditions  that give a warning but not an error.  The variable
              <u>$warnings_as_errors</u> controls whether this behavior is modified.

              When the variable is non-zero, <u>latexmk</u> at the end of its run will return a non-zero status code to
              the operating system if any of the files processed gives a warning about problems  with  citations
              or  references  (i.e., undefined citations or references or multiply defined references).  This is
              <b>after</b> <u>latexmk</u> has completed all the runs it needs to try and  resolve  references  and  citations.
              Thus  <u>$warnings_as_errors</u>  being nonzero causes <u>latexmk</u> to treat such warnings as errors, but only
              when they occur on the last run of *latex and only after processing is complete.  A non-zero value
              <u>$warnings_as_errors</u> can be set by the command-line option <b>-Werror</b>.

              The default behavior is normally satisfactory in the  usual  edit-compile-edit  cycle.   But,  for
              example,  <u>latexmk</u>  can  also be used as part of a build process for some bigger project, e.g., for
              creating documentation in the build of a software application.  Then it is often sensible to treat
              citation and reference warnings as errors that require the overall build process  to  be  aborted.
              Of course, since multiple runs of *latex are generally needed to resolve references and citations,
              what matters is <u>not</u> the warnings on the first run, but the warnings on the <u>last</u> run; <u>latexmk</u> takes
              this into account appropriately.

              In  addition,  when  preview-continuous  mode  is  used,  a non-zero value for <u>$warnings_as_errors</u>
              changes the use of the commands <u>$failure_cmd</u>, <u>$warning_cmd</u>, and <u>$success_cmd</u> after a  compliation.
              If  there  are citation or reference warnings, but no other errors, the behavior is as follows. If
              <u>$warning_cmd</u> is set, it is used.  If it is not set, then then if <u>$warnings_as_errors</u>  is  non-zero
              and  <u>$failure_cmd</u>  is set, then <u>$failure_cmd</u>.  Otherwise <u>$success_cmd</u> is used, if it is set.  (The
              foregoing explanation is rather complicated, because <u>latexmk</u> has to deal with the case that one or
              more of the commands isn't set.)

       <b>$xdv_mode</b> <b>[0]</b>
              If one, generate an xdv version of the document by use of xelatex.

              <u>xelatex</u>.

              <u>Note</u> <u>about</u> <u>xelatex</u>: <u>latexmk</u> uses <u>xelatex</u> to make an .xdv rather than .pdf file, with the .pdf file
              being created in a separate step.  This is enforced by the use of the <b>-no-pdf</b> option.   If  %O  is
              part  of  the  command  for  invoking  <u>xelatex</u>,  then  <u>latexmk</u>  will  insert  the  <b>-no-pdf</b>  option
              automatically, otherwise you must provide the option yourself.   See  the  documentation  for  the
              <b>-pdfxe</b> option for why <u>latexmk</u> makes a .xdv file rather than a .pdf file when <u>xelatex</u> is used.

       <b>%xelatex_input_extensions</b>
              This variable specifies the extensions tried by <u>latexmk</u> when it finds that an <u>xelatex</u> run resulted

              typically  happens  when LaTeX commands of the form \input{file} or \includegraphics{figure}, when
              the relevant source file does not exist.

              In this situation, <u>latexmk</u> searches for custom dependencies  to  make  the  missing  file(s),  but
              restricts  it  to the extensions specified by the variable %xelatex_input_extensions.  The default
              extensions are 'tex', 'pdf', 'jpg, and 'png'.

</u></pre><h4><b>CUSTOM</b> <b>DEPENDENCIES</b></h4><pre>
       In any RC file a set of custom dependencies can be set up to convert a file with one extension to a  file
       with  another.   An  example  use  of this would be to allow <u>latexmk</u> to convert a <u>.fig</u> file to <u>.eps</u> to be
       included in the <u>.tex</u> file.

   <b>Defining</b> <b>a</b> <b>custom</b> <b>dependency:</b>
       The old method of configuring <u>latexmk</u>  to  use  a  custom  dependency  was  to  directly  manipulate  the
       <u>@cus_dep_list</u>  array  that  contains information defining the custom dependencies.  (See the section "Old
       Method of Defining Custom Dependencies"  for  details.)  This  method  still  works,  but  is  no  longer
       preferred.

       A  better  method  is to use the subroutines that allow convenient manipulations of the custom dependency
       list.  These are

           add_cus_dep( fromextension, toextension, must, subroutine )
           remove_cus_dep( fromextension, toextension )
           show_cus_dep()

       The arguments are as follows:

       <b>from</b> <b>extension:</b>
              The extension of the file we are converting from (e.g. "fig").  It is specified without a period.

       <b>to</b> <b>extension:</b>
              The extension of the file we are converting to (e.g. "eps").  It is specified without a period.

       <b>must:</b>  If non-zero, the file from which we are converting <b>must</b> exist, if it doesn't  exist  <u>latexmk</u>  will
              give an error message and exit unless the <b>-f</b> option is specified.  If <u>must</u> is zero and the file we
              are  converting  from doesn't exist, then no action is taken.  Generally, the appropriate value of
              <u>must</u> is zero.

       <b>function:</b>
              The name of the subroutine that <u>latexmk</u> should call to perform the  file  conversion.   The  first
              argument  to  the  subroutine  is the base name of the file to be converted without any extension.
              The subroutines are declared in the syntax of <u>Perl</u>.  The  function  should  return  0  if  it  was
              successful and a nonzero number if it failed.

       Naturally  <u>add_cus_dep</u>  adds  a custom dependency with the specified from and to extensions.  If a custom
       dependency has been previously defined (e.g., in an rcfile that was read earlier), then it is replaced by
       the new one.

       The subroutine <u>remove_cus_dep</u> removes the specified custom dependency. The subroutine <u>show_cus_dep</u> causes
       a list of the currently defined custom dependencies to be sent to the screen output.

   <b>How</b> <b>custom</b> <b>dependencies</b> <b>are</b> <b>used:</b>
       An instance of a custom dependency rule is created whenever <u>latexmk</u> detects that a run of <u>*latex</u> needs to
       read a file, like a graphics file, whose extension is the to-extension  of  a  custom  dependency.   Then
       <u>latexmk</u>  examines whether a file exists with the same name, but with the corresponding from-extension, as
       specified in the custom-dependency.  If it does, then a corresponding instance of the  custom  dependency
       is created, after which the rule is invoked whenever the destination file (the one with the to-extension)
       is out-of-date with respect to the corresponding source file.

       To  make the new destination file, the <u>Perl</u> subroutine specified in the rule is invoked, with an argument
       that is the base name of the files in question.  Simple cases  just  involve  a  subroutine  invoking  an
       external  program;  this can be done by following the templates below, even by those without knowledge of
       the <u>Perl</u> programming language.  Of course, experts could do something much more elaborate.

       One item in the specification of each custom-dependency rule, labeled "must"  above,  specifies  how  the
       rule should be applied when the source file fails to exist.

       When  <u>latex</u>  reports  that  an input file (e.g., a graphics file) does not exist, <u>latexmk</u> tries to find a
       source file and a custom dependency that can be used to make it.  If it  succeeds,  then  it  creates  an
       instance  of  the custom dependency and invokes it to make the missing file, after which the next pass of
       <u>latex</u> etc will be able to read the newly created file.

       <u>Note</u> <u>for</u> <u>advanced</u> <u>usage</u>: The operating system's environment variable TEXINPUTS can be used to  specify  a
       search  path  for  finding files by <u>latex</u> etc.  Correspondingly, when a missing file is reported, <u>latexmk</u>
       looks in the directories specified in TEXINPUTS as well as in the current directory,  to  find  a  source
       file from which an instance of a custom dependency can be used to make the missing file.

   <b>Function</b> <b>to</b> <b>implement</b> <b>custom</b> <b>dependency,</b> <b>traditional</b> <b>method:</b>
       The function that implements a custom dependency gets the information on the files to be processed in two
       ways.   The  first  is  through  its  one argument; the argument contains the base name of the source and
       destination files.  The second way is described later.

       A simple and typical example of code in an initialization rcfile using the first method is:

           add_cus_dep( 'fig', 'eps', 0, 'fig2eps' );
           sub fig2eps {
               system( "fig2dev -Leps \"$_[0].fig\" \"$_[0].eps\"" );
           }

       The first line adds a custom dependency that converts a file with extension "fig", as created by the <u>xfig</u>
       program, to an encapsulated postscript  file,  with  extension  "eps".   The  remaining  lines  define  a
       subroutine that carries out the conversion.  If a rule for converting "fig" to "eps" files already exists
       (e.g.,  from  a  previously read-in initialization file), the <u>latexmk</u> will delete this rule before making
       the new one.

       Suppose <u>latexmk</u> is using this rule to convert a file "figure.fig" to "figure.eps".  Then it  will  invoke
       the  fig2eps  subroutine defined in the above code with a single argument "figure", which is the basename
       of each of the files (possibly with a path component).  This argument is referred to by  <u>Perl</u>  as  $_[0].
       In  the  example  above,  the subroutine uses the <u>Perl</u> command system to invoke the program fig2dev.  The
       double quotes around the string are a <u>Perl</u> idiom that signify that each string of the form of a  variable
       name, $_[0] in this case, is to be substituted by its value.

       If  the return value of the subroutine is non-zero, then <u>latexmk</u> will assume an error occurred during the
       execution of the subroutine.  In the above example, no explicit return value is given,  and  instead  the
       return  value  is  the  value  returned by the last (and only) statement, i.e., the invocation of system,
       which returns the value 0 on success.

       If you use <u>pdflatex</u>, <u>lualatex</u> or <u>xelatex</u> instead of <u>latex</u>, then you will probably prefer to convert  your
       graphics files to pdf format, in which case you would replace the above code in an initialization file by

           add_cus_dep( 'fig', 'pdf, 0, 'fig2pdf' );
           sub fig2pdf {
               system( "fig2dev -Lpdf \"$_[0].fig\" \"$_[0].pdf\"" );
           }

       <b>Note</b>  <b>1:</b> In the command lines given in the system commands in the above examples, double quotes have been
       inserted around the file names (implemented by '\"' in the Perl language).  They immunize the running  of
       the  program  against  special characters in filenames.  Very often these quotes are not necessary, i.e.,
       they can be omitted.  But it is normally safer to keep them in.  Even though the rules for  quoting  vary
       between  operating  systems,  command  shells  and individual pieces of software, the quotes in the above
       examples do not cause problems in the cases I have tested.

       <b>Note</b> <b>2:</b> One case in which the quotes are important is when the files  are  in  a  subdirectory  and  your
       operating  system  is  Microsoft  Windows.   Then the separator character for directory components can be
       either a forward slash '/' or Microsoft's more usual backward slash '\'.  Forward slashes  are  generated
       by  <u>latexmk</u>,  to  maintain its sanity from software like MiKTeX that mixes both directory separators; but
       their correct use normally requires quoted filenames.  (See a log file from a run of MiKTeX (at least  in
       v. 2.9) for an example of the use of both directory separators.)

       <b>Note</b>  <b>3:</b>  The  subroutines implementing custom dependencies in the examples given just have a single line
       invoking an external program.  That's the usual situation.  But since the subroutines  are  in  the  Perl
       language, you can implement much more complicated processing if you need it.

   <b>Removing</b> <b>custom</b> <b>dependencies,</b> <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this:</b>
       If  you  have some general custom dependencies defined in the system or user initialization file, you may
       find that for a particular project they are undesirable.  So you might want to delete the unneeded  ones.
       A  situation  where this would be desirable is where there are multiple custom dependencies with the same
       from-extension or the same to-extension. In that case, <u>latexmk</u> might choose a different one from the  one
       you want for a specific project.  As an example, to remove any "fig" to "eps" rule you would use:

           remove_cus_dep( 'fig', 'eps' );

       If  you  have  complicated  sets  of  custom  dependencies,  you  may want to get a listing of the custom
       dependencies.  This is done by using the line

           show_cus_dep();

       in an initialization file.

   <b>Function</b> <b>implementing</b> <b>custom</b> <b>dependency,</b> <b>alternative</b> <b>methods:</b>
       So far the examples for functions to implement custom dependencies have used the argument of the function
       to specify the base name of converted file.  This method has been available since very  old  versions  of
       <u>latexmk</u>, and many examples can be found, e.g., on the web.

       However  in later versions of <u>latexmk</u> the internal structure of the implementation of its "rules" for the
       steps of processing, including custom dependencies, became much more powerful.  The function implementing
       a custom dependency is executed  within  a  special  context  where  a  number  of  extra  variables  and
       subroutines  are  defined.   Publicly documented ones, intended to be long-term stable, are listed below,
       under the heading "Variables and subroutines for processing a rule".

       Examples of their use is given in the following examples, concerning multiple index files and glossaries.

       The only index-file conversion built-in to <u>latexmk</u> is from an ".idx" file written on one run of <u>*latex</u> to
       an ".ind" file to be read in on a subsequent run.  But with the index.sty package, for example,  you  can
       create  extra  indexes  with  extensions  that  you  configure.   <u>Latexmk</u> does not know how to deduce the
       extensions from the information it has.  But you can easily write a custom dependency.   For  example  if
       your  latex  file  uses  the  command  "\newindex{special}{ndx}{nnd}{Special index}" you will need to get
       <u>latexmk</u> to convert files with the extension <u>.ndx</u> to <u>.nnd</u>.  The most elementary  method  is  to  define  a
       custom dependency as follows:

           add_cus_dep( 'ndx', 'nnd', 0, 'ndx2nnd' );
           sub ndx2nnd {
               return system( "makeindex -o \"$_[0].nnd\" \"$_[0].ndx\"" );
           }
           push @generated_exts, 'ndx', 'nnd';

       Notice the added line compared with earlier examples.  The extra line gets the extensions "ndx" and "nnd"
       added to the list of extensions for generated files; then the extra index files will be deleted by clean-
       up operations

       But if you have yet more indexes with yet different extensions, e.g., "adx" and "and", then you will need
       a  separate  function  for  each  pair of extensions.  This is quite annoying.  You can use the <u>Run_subst</u>
       function to simplify the definitions to use a single function:

           add_cus_dep( 'ndx', 'nnd', 0, 'dx2nd' );
           add_cus_dep( 'adx', 'and', 0, 'dx2nd' );
           sub dx2nd {
               return Run_subst( "makeindex -o %D %S" );
           }
           push @generated_exts, 'ndx', 'nnd', 'adx', 'and';

       You could also instead use

           add_cus_dep( 'ndx', 'nnd', 0, 'dx2nd' );
           add_cus_dep( 'adx', 'and', 0, 'dx2nd' );
           sub dx2nd {
               return Run_subst( $makeindex );
           }
           push @generated_exts, 'ndx', 'nnd', 'adx', 'and';

       This last example uses the command specification in <u>$makeindex</u>, and so any customization  you  have  made
       for the standard index also applies to your extra indexes.

       Similar techniques can be applied for glossaries.

       Those of you with experience with Makefiles, may get concerned that the <u>.ndx</u> file is written during a run
       of  <u>*latex</u>  and is always later than the <u>.nnd</u> last read in.  Thus the <u>.nnd</u> appears to be perpetually out-
       of-date.  This situation, of circular dependencies, is endemic to latex, and is one of  the  issues  that
       <u>latexmk</u>  is  programmed  to  overcome.  It examines the contents of the files (by use of a checksum), and
       only does a remake when the file contents have actually changed.

       Of course if you choose to write random data to the <u>.nnd</u> (or the <u>.aux</u> file, etc) that changes on each new
       run, then you will have a problem.  For real experts: See the <u>%hash_calc_ignore_pattern</u> if  you  have  to
       deal with such problems.

   <b>Old</b> <b>Method</b> <b>of</b> <b>Defining</b> <b>Custom</b> <b>Dependencies:</b>
       In  much  older  versions  of  <u>latexmk</u>,  the  only method of defining custom dependencies was to directly
       manipulate the table of custom dependencies.  This is contained in the <u>@cus_dep_list</u>  array.   It  is  an
       array of strings, and each string in the array has four items in it, each separated by a space, the from-
       extension,  the  to-extension, the "must" item, and the name of the subroutine for the custom dependency.
       These were all defined above.

       An example of the old method of defining custom dependencies is as follows. It is the code in an RC  file
       to ensure automatic conversion of <u>.fig</u> files to <u>.eps</u> files:

           push @cus_dep_list, "fig eps 0 fig2eps";
           sub fig2eps {
               return system( "fig2dev -Lps \"$_[0].fig\" \"$_[0].eps\"" );
           }

       This  method  still  works,  and is almost equivalent to the code given earlier that used the <u>add_cus_dep</u>
       subroutine.  However, the  old  method  doesn't  delete  any  previous  custom-dependency  for  the  same
       conversion.  So the new method is preferable.

</pre><h4><b>ADVANCED</b> <b>CONFIGURATION:</b> <b>SOME</b> <b>EXTRA</b> <b>RESOURCES</b> <b>AND</b> <b>ADVANCED</b> <b>TRICKS</b></h4><pre>
       For  most purposes, simple configuration for <u>latexmk</u> along the lines of the examples given is sufficient.
       But sometimes you need  something  harder.   In  this  section,  I  indicate  some  extra  possibilities.
       Generally  to use these, you need to be fluent in the Perl language, since this is what is used in the rc
       files.

       In this section, I include first, a description of a number of variables and  subroutines  that  provide,
       among  other  things,  access  to  latexmk's  internal data structures for handling dependencies.  Then I
       describe the hook mechanism whereby at certain points in the processing, latexmk  can  call  user-defined
       subroutines.

       See  also  the  section  DEALING  WITH  ERRORS,  PROBLEMS,  ETC.   See also the examples in the directory
       <u>example_rcfiles</u> in the <u>latexmk</u> distributions.  Even if none of the examples apply to your case, they  may
       give you useful ideas

   <b>Variables</b> <b>and</b> <b>subroutines</b> <b>for</b> <b>processing</b> <b>a</b> <b>rule</b>
       A  step in the processing is called a rule. One possibility to implement the processing of a rule is by a
       Perl subroutine.  This is always the case for custom dependencies. Also, for any other rule, you can  use
       a  subroutine  by prefixing the command specification by the word "internal" -- see the section FORMAT OF
       COMMAND SPECIFICATIONS.

       When you use a subroutine for processing a rule, all the possibilities of Perl programming are available,
       of course.  In addition, some of <u>latexmk</u>'s internal variables and subroutines are  available.   The  ones
       listed  below  are  intended to be available to (advanced) users, and their specifications will generally
       have stability under upgrades. Generally, the variables should be treated as  read-only:  Changing  their
       values can have bad consequences, since it is liable to mess up the consistency of what <u>latexmk</u> is doing.

       <b>$rule</b>  This  variable has the name of the rule, as known to <u>latexmk</u>. Note that the exact contents of this
              variable for a given rule may be dependent on the version of <u>latexmk</u>

       <b>$$Pbase</b>
              This gives the basename for the rule.  Generally, it determines  the  names  of  generated  files.
              E.g.,  for  a  run of *latex, the name of the .log file is the aux directory concatenated with the
              basename and then `.log'.

              For a *latex rule, the basename is without a directory component.  For other  rules,  it  includes
              the directory component (if any is used).

              This  (annoying) difference is associated with the different ways in which the commands invoked by
              latexmk work when the command line includes a name for a source file  that  includes  a  directory
              component.   For  the  *latex  commands,  the  directory  of  the source file is irrelevant to the
              directory component the generated files, which instead is determined by the values  in  the  -aux-
              directory and/or -output-directory options.

              In  contrast,  many  other  programs  (e.g.,  biber, bibtex) put their generated files in the same
              directory as the source file, merely with a changed extension.

              Note the double dollar signs: In Perl terms, the variable <u>$Pbase</u> is a <u>reference</u> to a variable that
              contains the basename.  The second dollar sign derefences the reference to give the actual  value.
              (A  reference  is  is  used rather like a pointer, and the `P' (for `pointer') at the start of the
              variable name is a convention used in latexmk  to  indicate  that  the  variable  is  a  reference
              variable.)

       <b>$$Pdest</b>
              This gives the name of the main output file if any.  Note the double dollar signs.

       <b>$$Psource</b>
              This gives the name of the primary source file.  Note the double dollar signs.

       <b>add_hook(</b> <b>&lt;stack_name&gt;,</b> <b>&lt;subroutine&gt;</b> <b>)</b>
              See the section `Hooks' for more details.

              This adds the subroutine specified in the second argument to latexmk's stack of hooks specified by
              the  stack  name.   It returns 1 on success, and zero otherwise (e.g., if the specified hook stack
              doesn't exist).

              The subroutine can be specified by a reference to the subroutine, as in

                  add_hook( 'after_xlatex_analysis', mmz_analyze )

              Given that the subroutine mmz_analyze has been defined in the rc file.

              The subroutine can be specified by a string whose value is the name of the subroutine, e.g.,

                  add_hook( 'after_xlatex_analysis', 'mmz_analyze' )

              In simple cases, the subroutine can be an anonymous subroutine defined in the call to add_hooks,

                  add_hook( 'after_main_pdf', sub{ print "TEST\n"; return 0; } );

              Observe that on success, the subroutine should return 0 (like a call to Perl's system subroutine),
              so normally this should be coded explicitly.  If a  hook  subroutine  returns  a  non-zero  value,
              latexmk treats that as an error condition.

       <b>ensure_path(</b> <b>var,</b> <b>values</b> <b>...)</b>

              The  first  parameter  is  the name of one of the system's environment variables for search paths.
              The remaining parameters are values that should be  in  the  variable.   For  each  of  the  value
              parameters,  if  it  isn't  already in the variable, then it is prepended to the variable; in that
              case the environment variable is created if it doesn't already exist. For separating  values,  the
              character  appropriate  the  the  operating  system  is  used  --  see  the configuration variable
              <u>$search_path_separator</u>.

              Example:

                ensure_path( 'TEXINPUTS', './custom_cls_sty_files//' );

              (In this example, the trailing '//' is documented by TeX systems to mean that  <u>*latex</u>  search  for
              files in the specified directory and in all subdirectories.)

              Technically  <u>ensure_path</u>  works by setting Perl's variable <u>$ENV{var}</u>, where <u>var</u> is the name of the
              target variable.  The changed value is then passed as  an  environment  variable  to  any  invoked
              programs.

       <b>pushd(</b> <b>path</b> <b>),</b> <b>popd()</b>
              These subroutines are used when it is needed to temporarily change the working directory, as in

                   pushd( 'some_directory' );
                   ... Processing done with 'some_directory' as the working directory
                   popd()

              They  perform  exactly  the  same  function  as the commands of the same names in operating system
              command shells like bash on Unix, and cmd.exe on the Windows.

       <b>rdb_add_generated(</b> <b>file,</b> <b>...</b> <b>)</b>
              This subroutine is to be used in the context of a rule, that is, from within a subroutine that  is
              carrying  out  processing  of  a  rule.  Such is the case for the subroutine implementing a custom
              dependency, or the subroutine invoked by using the "internal" keyword in the command specification
              like that in the variable <u>$latex</u>.

              Its arguments are a sequence of filenames which are generated during the running of the rule.  The
              names might arise from an analysis of the results of the  run,  e.g.,  in  a  log  file,  or  from
              knowledge  of  properties  of  the  specific rule.  Calling <u>rdb_add_generated</u> with these filenames
              ensures that these files are  flagged  as  generated  by  the  rule  in  <u>latexmk</u>'s  internal  data
              structures.  Basically, no action is taken if the files have already been flagged as generated.

              A  main  purpose  of  using this subroutine is for the situation when a generated file is also the
              source file for some rule, so that <u>latexmk</u> can correctly link the dependency  information  in  its
              network of rules.

              <u>Note:</u>  <u>Unlike</u>  <u>some</u>  <u>other</u>  <u>subroutines</u>  <u>in</u>  <u>this</u>  <u>section,</u>  <u>there</u>  <u>is</u>  <u>no</u> <u>argument</u> <u>for</u> <u>a</u> <u>rule</u> <u>for</u>
              rdb_add_generated<u>.</u> <u>Instead,</u> <u>the</u> <u>subroutine</u> <u>is</u> <u>to</u> <u>be</u> <u>invoked</u> <u>during</u> <u>the</u> <u>processing</u> <u>of</u> <u>a</u>  <u>rule</u>  <u>when</u>
              latexmk <u>has</u> <u>set</u> <u>up</u> <u>an</u> <u>appropriate</u> <u>context</u> <u>(i.e.,</u> <u>appropriate</u> <u>variables).</u>  <u>In</u> <u>contrast,</u> <u>subroutines</u>
              <u>with</u> <u>a</u> <u>rule</u> <u>argument</u> <u>can</u> <u>be</u> <u>used</u> <u>also</u> <u>outside</u> <u>a</u> <u>rule</u> <u>context.</u>

       <b>rdb_ensure_file(</b> <b>$rule,</b> <b>file</b> <b>)</b>
              This  subroutine ensures that the given file is among the source files for the specified rule.  It
              is typically used when, during the processing of a rule, it is known that a particular extra  file
              is  among  the  dependencies  that  <u>latexmk</u>  should  know,  but its default methods don't find the
              dependency. Almost always the first argument is the name of the rule currently being processed, so
              it is then appropriate to specify it by <u>$rule</u>.

              For examples of its use, see some of the files  in  the  directory  <u>example_rcfiles</u>  of  <u>latexmk</u>'s
              distribution.    Currently   the   cases   that   use   this   subroutine  are  <u>bib2gls-latexmkrc</u>,
              <u>exceltex_latexmkrc</u> and <u>texinfo-latexmkrc</u>.  These illustrate typical cases where  <u>latexmk</u>'s  normal
              processing fails to detect certain extra source files.

              <u>Note</u>  <u>that</u>  rdb_ensure_file  <u>only</u>  <u>has</u>  <u>one</u>  <u>filename</u>  <u>argument,</u>  <u>unlike</u> <u>other</u> <u>subroutines</u> <u>in</u> <u>this</u>
              <u>section.</u>  <u>If</u> <u>you</u> <u>want</u> <u>to</u>  <u>apply</u>  <u>its</u>  <u>action</u>  <u>to</u>  <u>multiple</u>  <u>files,</u>  <u>you</u>  <u>will</u>  <u>need</u>  <u>one</u>  <u>call</u>  <u>to</u>
              rdb_ensure_file <u>for</u> <u>each</u> <u>file.</u>

       <b>rdb_ensure_files_here(</b> <b>file,</b> <b>...</b> <b>)</b>
              Like  subroutine  <u>rdb_ensure_files</u>,  except  that (a) it assumes the context is of a rule, and the
              files are to be added to the source list for that rule; (b) multiple files are allowed.

       <b>rdb_remove_files(</b> <b>$rule,</b> <b>file,</b> <b>...</b> <b>)</b>
              This subroutine removes one or more files from the dependency list for the given rule.

       <b>rdb_remove_generated(</b> <b>file,</b> <b>...</b> <b>)</b>
              This subroutine is to be used in the context of a rule, that is, from within a subroutine that  is
              carrying  out  processing  of  a rule.  It performs the opposite action to <u>rdb_add_generated</u>.  Its
              effect is to ensure that the given filenames are not listed in <u>latexmk</u>'s internal data  structures
              as being generated by the rule.

       <b>rdb_list_source(</b> <b>$rule</b> <b>)</b>
              This subroutine returns the list of source files (i.e., the dependency list) for the given rule.

       <b>rdb_set_source(</b> <b>$rule,</b> <b>file,</b> <b>...</b> <b>)</b>

       <b>rdb_set_source(</b> <b>$rule,</b> <b>@files</b> <b>)</b>
              This subroutine sets the dependency list for the given rule to be the specified files.  Files that
              are  already in the list have unchanged information.  Files that were not in the list are added to
              it.  Files in the previous dependency list that are not in the newly specified list of  files  are
              removed from the dependency list.

       <b>Run_subst(</b> <b>command_spec</b> <b>)</b>
              This  subroutine runs the command specified by <u>command_spec</u>.  The specification is a string in the
              format listed in the section "Format of Command  Specifications".   An  important  action  of  the
              <u>Run_subst</u>  is  to  make  substitutions of placeholders, e.g., %S and %D for source and destination
              files; these get  substituted  before  the  command  is  run.   In  addition,  the  command  after
              substitution is printed to the screen unless <u>latexmk</u> is running in silent mode.

       <b>test_gen_file_time</b> <b>(</b> <b>&lt;file&gt;</b> <b>)</b>
              This  subroutine  is used in the context of a rule.  It returns true or false according to whether
              or not a file of the given name both exists and was generated in the latest run of the  rule.   If
              the  subroutine  returns  false,  but the file exists, then the file is a leftover from a previous
              run.

              The test for a file being generated on the current run is whether the  modification  time  of  the
              file is at least as recent as the time that the run of the rule was started.  An allowance for the
              granularity  of  the  values of modification time on file systems is made.  See the description of
              the variable <b>$filetime_causality_threshold</b> for details.

              In addition, latexmk makes allowance for the possibility that files  are  hosted  on  a  different
              computer  than  that  running  latexmk  and  that  the system clock times on the two computers are
              mismatched.  Latexmk automatically detects (and reports) any significant mismatch and corrects for
              it.

   <b>Coordinated</b> <b>Setting</b> <b>of</b> <b>Commands</b> <b>for</b> <b>*latex</b>
       To set all of <u>$dvilualatex</u>, <u>$hilatex</u>, <u>$latex</u>, <u>$pdflatex</u>, <u>$lualatex</u>, and <u>$xelatex</u> to a common pattern, you
       can use one of the following subroutines, std_tex_cmds, alt_tex_cmds, and set_tex_cmds.

       To get the standard commands, use

          &amp;std_tex_cmds;

       This results in <u>$latex</u> <u>=</u> <u>'latex</u> <u>%O</u> <u>%S'</u>, and similarly for <u>$dvilualatex</u>, <u>$hilatex</u>,  <u>$pdflatex</u>,  <u>$lualatex</u>,
       and  <u>$xelatex</u>.   Note  the ampersand in the invocation; this indicates to Perl that a subroutine is being
       called.  (The use of this subroutine enables you to override previous redefinitions of  the  <u>$latex</u>,  etc
       variables, which might have occurred in an earlier-read rc file.)

       To be able to use the string provided by the -pretex option (if any), you can use

          &amp;alt_tex_cmds;

       This  results in <u>$latex</u> <u>=</u> <u>'latex</u> <u>%O</u> <u>%P'</u>, etc.  Again note the ampersand in the invocation; this indicates
       to Perl that a subroutine is being called.

       A more general way of specifying the variables is using

         set_tex_cmds( 'CMD_SPEC' );

       Here CMD_SPEC is the command line without the program name. This results in <u>$latex</u>  <u>=</u>  <u>'latex</u>  <u>CMD_SPEC'</u>,
       and  similarly  for  <u>$pdflatex</u>,  etc.  (An ampersand preceding the subroutine name is not necessary here,
       since the parentheses show Perl that a subroutine is being invoked.)

       An example that provides the <u>--interaction=batchmode</u> option to the *latex commands would be

         set_tex_cmds( '--interaction=batchmode %O %S' );

       This results in <u>$latex</u> <u>=</u> <u>'latex</u> <u>--interaction=batchmode</u> <u>%O</u> <u>%S</u> <u>'</u>, etc.  Note that when '%O' appears  after
       the added option, as here, options provided on the command line to <u>latexmk</u> can override the supplied one.

       A  more  general  command  line  can  be  set  up by using the placeholder '%C' in CMD_SPEC.  The '%C' is
       substituted by the basic name of the command, i.e., whichever of 'latex', 'pdflatex', etc is appropriate.
       (More than one occurrence of '%C' is allowed.)  For example to use the  development/pre-release  versions
       of latex, etc, which have names, 'latex-dev', 'pdflatex-dev', etc, you could use

         set_tex_cmds( '%C-dev %O %S' );

       This results in <u>$latex</u> <u>=</u> <u>'latex-dev</u> <u>%O</u> <u>%S'</u>, etc.  (The pre-release programs latex-dev etc are provided in
       current distributions of TeXLive and MiKTeX.)

   <b>Hooks</b>
       Latexmk  provides  a  way  to  arrange for user-defined subroutines to be called at certain points in the
       processing.  These can be used to configure appropriate behavior  and  actions  beyond  latexmk's  normal
       behavior.   For  a  good  example of how they can be used to accommodate latexmk's behavior to particular
       packages, see the file memoize_latexmkrc in the example_rcfiles subdirectory of the latexmk distribution.
       (In a standard TeXLive installation, that subdirectory is to be found in texmf-dist/doc/support/latexmk/)

       The hook mechanism is complementary to the method of redefining command strings like <b>$pdflatex</b> etc.   The
       two methods have overlapping domains of usefulness.

       Note  that  the  hook  mechanism is newly made public in v. 4.84 of latexmk.  It is subject to change and
       improvement as experience is gained.

       The hooks are arranged in named hook stacks, and a hook subroutine is added to a given stack by latexmk's
       add_hook subroutine (documented above).  The currently available stacks are as  follows,  listed  in  the
       approximate order in which they are encountered in processing a document:

         before_xlatex
           The subroutines in this hook stack are called just before a
           *latex programs is run.

         after_xlatex
           The subroutines in this hook stack are called after a *latex programs is
           run.  Before the subroutines are called, latexmk has done some immediate
           postprocessing, e.g., to move the generated pdf file from the aux
           directory to the output directory when <b>$emulate_aux</b> is set to 1.

         after_xlatex_analysis
           The subroutines in this hook stack are called after latexmk has done its
           dependency analysis after a *latex programs is run.  Subroutines in this
           stack provide a useful way of adding items to the dependency information
           associated with particular packages and that latexmk doesn't
           automatically deal with.

         after_main_pdf
           The subroutines in this hook stack are called after one of the rules that
           creates the document's pdf file. (This covers any of pdflatex, lualatex,
           dvipdf, ps2pdf, xdvipdfmx.)

         cleanup
           The subroutines in this hook stack are called whenever latexmk is about
           to do a cleanup operation.  They can be used, for example, to tailor the
           deleted files to the peculiarities of particular packages when latexmk's
           general mechanisms for specifying files to be deleted are too inflexible.

           These subroutines are called before latexmk does any of its own file
           deletion; thus the hook subroutines have access to all the generated
           files that give package-specific information.

         cleanup_extra_full
           The subroutines in this hook stack are called in addition to the ones in
           the cleanup stack, whenever a full cleanup operation is to be done (i.e.,
           one that includes the pdf, ps etc files).  They are called immediately
           after those in the cleanup stack, but still before latexmk does any of
           its own file deletion.

       (Any  other  stacks  defined  in  latexmk.pl  but not listed above are to be regarded as experimental and
       subject to change.)

       Each subroutine should return 0 on success and a non-zero value on failure.  This matches the  convention
       used  for  running  programs,  e.g.,  by  Perl's  system subroutine, and the matching convention used for
       subroutines for custom dependencies in latexmk.

       For most of the hook stacks, the subroutines are called in the context of a  rule,  with  variables  like
       <b>$rule</b>  defined.   However, some hook stacks, like the cleanup ones, are called from outside any rule; and
       latexmk adjusts the relevant variables to refer to the overall task (i.e.,  of  processing  a  particular
       main .tex file).

   <b>Advanced</b> <b>configuration:</b> <b>Using</b> <u><b>latexmk</b></u> <b>with</b> <u><b>make</b></u>
       This  section  is  targeted  only at advanced users who use the <u>make</u> program for complex projects, as for
       software development, with the dependencies specified by a Makefile.

       Now the basic task of <u>latexmk</u> is to run the appropriate programs to make a viewable version  of  a  LaTeX
       document.  However, the usual <u>make</u> program is not suited to this purpose for at least two reasons.  First
       is  that  the  use  of  LaTeX  involves circular dependencies (e.g., via .aux files), and these cannot be
       handled by the standard <u>make</u> program.  Second is that in a large document the set  of  source  files  can
       change  quite frequently, particularly with included graphics files; in this situation keeping a Makefile
       manually updated is inappropriate and error-prone, especially when the  dependencies  can  be  determined
       automatically.  <u>Latexmk</u> solves both of these problems robustly.

       Thus  for  many  standard  LaTeX  documents <u>latexmk</u> can be used by itself without the <u>make</u> program.  In a
       complex project it simply needs to be suitably configured.  A standard configuration would be  to  define
       custom  dependencies  to  make  graphics  files  from  their  source  files (e.g., as created by the <u>xfig</u>
       program).  Custom dependencies are <u>latexmk</u>'s equivalent of pattern rules in Makefiles.

       Nevertheless there are projects for which a Makefile is appropriate, and it is useful to know how to  use
       <u>latexmk</u>  from  a  Makefile.  A typical example would be to generate documentation for a software project.
       Potentially the interaction with the rest of the rules in the Makefile could be  quite  complicated,  for
       example if some of the source files for a LaTeX document are generated by the project's software.

       In this section, I give a couple of examples of how <u>latexmk</u> can be usefully invoked from a Makefile.  The
       examples  use  specific  features of current versions of GNU <u>make</u>, which is the default on both linux and
       OS-X systems.  They may need modifications for other versions of <u>make</u>.

       The simplest method is simply to delegate all the relevant  tasks  to  <u>latexmk</u>,  as  is  suitable  for  a
       straightforward LaTeX document.  For this a suitable Makefile is like

           .PHONY : FORCE_MAKE
           all : try.pdf
           %.pdf : %.tex FORCE_MAKE
               latexmk -pdf -dvi- -ps- $&lt;

       (Note:  the last line must be introduced by a tab for the Makefile to function correctly!)  Naturally, if
       making try.pdf from its associated LaTeX file try.tex were the only task to be performed, a direct use of
       <u>latexmk</u> without a Makefile would normally be better.  The  benefit  of  using  a  Makefile  for  a  LaTeX
       document  would  be in a larger project, where lines such as the above would be only be a small part of a
       larger Makefile.

       The above example has a pattern rule for making a .pdf file from a .tex file, and it is  defined  to  use
       <u>latexmk</u>  in  the obvious way.  There is a conventional default target named "all", with a prerequisite of
       try.pdf.  So when <u>make</u> is invoked, by default it makes try.pdf.  The only complication is that there  may
       be  many source files beyond try.tex, but these aren't specified in the Makefile, so changes in them will
       not by themselves cause <u>latexmk</u> to be invoked.  Instead, the pattern rule  is  equipped  with  a  "phony"
       prerequisite  FORCE_MAKE;  this  has  the  effect  of  causing the rule to be always out-of-date, so that
       <u>latexmk</u> is always run.  It is <u>latexmk</u> that decides whether  any  action  is  needed,  e.g.,  a  rerun  of
       <u>pdflatex</u>.   Effectively  the  Makefile delegates all decisions to <u>latexmk</u>, while <u>make</u> has no knowledge of
       the list of source files except for primary LaTeX file for the  document.  If  there  are,  for  example,
       graphics files to be made, these must be made by custom dependencies configured in <u>latexmk</u>.

       But  something  better is needed in more complicated situations, for example, when the making of graphics
       files needs to be specified by rules in the Makefile.  To do this,  one  can  use  a  Makefile  like  the
       following:

            TARGETS = document1.pdf document2.pdf
            DEPS_DIR = .deps
            LATEXMK = latexmk -recorder -use-make -deps \
                  -e 'warn qq(In Makefile, turn off custom dependencies\n);' \
                  -e '@cus_dep_list = ();' \
                  -e 'show_cus_dep();'
            all : $(TARGETS)
            $(foreach file,$(TARGETS),$(eval -include $(DEPS_DIR)/$(file)P))
            $(DEPS_DIR) :
                   mkdir $@
            %.pdf : %.tex
                   if [ ! -e $(DEPS_DIR) ]; then mkdir $(DEPS_DIR); fi
                   $(LATEXMK) -pdf -dvi- -ps- -deps-out=$(DEPS_DIR)/$@P $&lt;
            %.pdf : %.fig
                   fig2dev -Lpdf $&lt; $@

       (Again,  the  lines containing the commands for the rules should be started with tabs.)  This example was
       inspired by how GNU <u>automake</u> handles automatic dependency tracking of C source files.

       After each run of <u>latexmk</u>, dependency information is put in  a  file  in  the  .deps  subdirectory.   The
       Makefile  causes these dependency files to be read by <u>make</u>, which now has the full dependency information
       for each target .pdf file.  To make things less trivial it is specificed that two files document1.pdf and
       document2.pdf are the targets.  The dependency files are .deps/document1.pdfP and .deps/document2.pdfP.

       There is now no need for the phony prerequisite for the rule to make .pdf files from .tex files.   But  I
       have  added  a  rule  to make .pdf files from .fig files produced by the <u>xfig</u> program; these are commonly
       used for graphics insertions in LaTeX documents.  <u>Latexmk</u> is arranged to output a dependency  file  after
       each run.  It is given the <b>-recorder</b> option, which improves its detection of files generated during a run
       of  <u>pdflatex</u>;  such  files should not be in the dependency list.  The <b>-e</b> options are used to turn off all
       custom dependencies, and to document this.  Instead the <b>-use-make</b> is  used  to  delegate  the  making  of
       missing files to <u>make</u> itself.

       Suppose  in  the  LaTeX  file  there  is  a command \includegraphics{graph}, and an <u>xfig</u> file "graph.fig"
       exists.  On a first run, <u>pdflatex</u> reports a missing file,  named  "graph".  <u>Latexmk</u>  succeeds  in  making
       "graph.pdf"  by  calling "make graph.pdf", and after completion of its work, it lists "fig.pdf" among the
       dependents of the file <u>latexmk</u> is making.  Then let "fig.fig" be updated, and then let <u>make</u> be run.  <u>Make</u>
       first remakes "fig.pdf", and only then reruns <u>latexmk</u>.

       Thus we now have a method by which all the subsidiary processing is delegated to <u>make</u>.

       <b>Escaping</b> <b>of</b> <b>characters</b> <b>in</b> <b>dependency</b> <b>lists</b>: There are certain special characters that need to be  escaped
       when  names  of files and directories containing them appear in a dependency list used by a make program.
       Generally, such special characters are best avoided.

       By default, latexmk does no escaping of this kind, and the user will have to arrange  to  deal  with  the
       issue  separately,  if the relevant special characters are used.  Note that the rules for escaping depend
       on which make program is used, and on its version.

       One special case is of spaces, since those are particularly prevalent, notably  in  standard  choices  of
       name  for  a  user's home directory.  So latexmk does provide an option to escape spaces.  See the option
       <b>-deps_escape=...</b> and the variable <b>$deps_escape</b> for details.

</pre><h4><b>NON_ASCII</b> <b>CHARACTERS</b> <b>IN</b> <b>FILENAMES,</b> <b>RC</b> <b>FILES,</b> <b>ETC</b></h4><pre>
       Modern operating systems and  file  systems  allow  non-ASCII  characters  in  the  names  of  files  and
       directories that encompass the full Unicode range.  Mostly, <u>latexmk</u> deals with these correctly.  However,
       there  are  some  situations in which there are problems, notably on Microsoft Windows.  Prior to version
       4.77, <u>latexmk</u> had problems with non-ASCII filenames on Windows, even though there were  no  corresponding
       problems on macOS and Linux.  These problems are corrected in the present version.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b> <b>(SELECTED)</b></h4><pre>
       Sometimes  a  viewer  (gv)  tries  to  read an updated .ps or .pdf file after its creation is started but
       before the file is complete.  Work around: manually refresh (or reopen) display.  Or use one of the other
       previewers and update methods.

       (The following isn't really a bug, but concerns features of previewers.)  Preview  continuous  mode  only
       works  perfectly with certain previewers: Xdvi on UNIX/Linux works for dvi files.  Gv on UNIX/Linux works
       for both postscript and pdf.  Ghostview on UNIX/Linux needs a manual update (reopen); it views postscript
       and pdf.  Gsview under MS-Windows works for both postscript and pdf, but only reads the updated file when
       its screen is refreshed.  Acroread under UNIX/Linux views pdf, but  the  file  needs  to  be  closed  and
       reopened to view an updated version.  Under MS-Windows, acroread locks its input file and so the pdf file
       cannot be updated.  (Remedy: configure <u>latexmk</u> to use <u>sumatrapdf</u> instead.)
