</pre><h4><b>PROLOG</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       man — display system documentation

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       man <b>[</b>-k<b>]</b> <u>name</u>...

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>man</u>  utility  shall  write  information  about  each  of the <u>name</u> operands. If <u>name</u> is the name of a
       standard utility, <u>man</u> at a minimum shall write a message describing  the  syntax  used  by  the  standard
       utility, its options, and operands. If more information is available, the <u>man</u> utility shall provide it in
       an implementation-defined manner.

       An  implementation may provide information for values of <u>name</u> other than the standard utilities. Standard
       utilities that are listed as optional and that are not supported by the implementation either shall cause
       a brief message indicating that fact to be displayed or shall cause a  full  display  of  information  as
       described previously.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>man</u>  utility  shall  conform  to  the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <u>Section</u> <u>12.2</u>, <u>Utility</u>
       <u>Syntax</u> <u>Guidelines</u>.

       The following option shall be supported:

       <b>-k</b>      Interpret <u>name</u> operands as keywords to be used in searching a  utilities  summary  database  that
               contains  a  brief  purpose  entry  for  each  standard  utility and write lines from the summary
               database that match any of the keywords. The keyword search shall produce results  that  are  the
               equivalent of the output of the following command:

                   grep -Ei '
                   <u>name</u>
                   <u>name</u>
                   ...
                   ' <u>summary-database</u>

               This  assumes  that  the  <u>summary-database</u>  is  a  text  file  with a single entry per line; this
               organization is not required and the example using <u>grep</u> <b>-Ei</b> is merely illustrative of the type of
               search intended. The purpose entry to be included in  the  database  shall  consist  of  a  terse
               description of the purpose of the utility.

</pre><h4><b>OPERANDS</b></h4><pre>
       The following operand shall be supported:

       <u>name</u>      A  keyword  or  the  name  of  a  standard  utility. When <b>-k</b> is not specified and <u>name</u> does not
                 represent one of the standard utilities, the results are unspecified.

</pre><h4><b>STDIN</b></h4><pre>
       Not used.

</pre><h4><b>INPUT</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of <u>man</u>:

       <u>LANG</u>      Provide a default value for the internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See the
                 Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <u>Section</u> <u>8.2</u>, <u>Internationalization</u>  <u>Variables</u>  for  the
                 precedence   of   internationalization  variables  used  to  determine  the  values  of  locale
                 categories.)

       <u>LC_ALL</u>    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values of all the  other  internationalization
                 variables.

       <u>LC_CTYPE</u>  Determine  the  locale  for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of text data as characters
                 (for example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments and in  the  summary
                 database).  The  value  of <u>LC_CTYPE</u> need not affect the format of the information written about
                 the <u>name</u> operands.

       <u>LC_MESSAGES</u>
                 Determine the locale that should be used to  affect  the  format  and  contents  of  diagnostic
                 messages written to standard error and informative messages written to standard output.

       <u>NLSPATH</u>   Determine the location of message catalogs for the processing of <u>LC_MESSAGES</u>.

       <u>PAGER</u>     Determine  an  output  filtering  command  for  writing  the  output  to a terminal. Any string
                 acceptable as a <u>command_string</u> operand to the <u>sh</u> <b>-c</b>  command  shall  be  valid.  When  standard
                 output  is  a terminal device, the reference page output shall be piped through the command. If
                 the <u>PAGER</u> variable is null or not set, the command shall be either <u>more</u>  or  another  paginator
                 utility documented in the system documentation.

</pre><h4><b>ASYNCHRONOUS</b> <b>EVENTS</b></h4><pre>
       Default.

</pre><h4><b>STDOUT</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>man</u> utility shall write text describing the syntax of the utility <u>name</u>, its options and its operands,
       or,  when  <b>-k</b>  is  specified, lines from the summary database. The format of this text is implementation-
       defined.

</pre><h4><b>STDERR</b></h4><pre>
       The standard error shall be used for diagnostic messages, and may also be used for informational messages
       of unspecified format.

</pre><h4><b>OUTPUT</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>EXTENDED</b> <b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       The following exit values shall be returned:

        0    Successful completion.

       &gt;0    An error occurred.

</pre><h4><b>CONSEQUENCES</b> <b>OF</b> <b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       Default.

       <u>The</u> <u>following</u> <u>sections</u> <u>are</u> <u>informative.</u>

</pre><h4><b>APPLICATION</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>RATIONALE</b></h4><pre>
       It is recognized that the <u>man</u> utility is only of minimal usefulness as  specified.  The  opinion  of  the
       standard  developers was strongly divided as to how much or how little information <u>man</u> should be required
       to provide. They considered, however, that the provision of some portable way of accessing  documentation
       would aid user portability. The arguments against a fuller specification were:

        *  Large  quantities  of documentation should not be required on a system that does not have excess disk
           space.

        *  The current manual  system  does  not  present  information  in  a  manner  that  greatly  aids  user
           portability.

        *  A  ``better help system'' is currently an area in which vendors feel that they can add value to their
           POSIX implementations.

       The <b>-f</b> option was considered, but due to implementation differences, it was not included in  this  volume
       of POSIX.1‐2017.

       The  description  was  changed  to  be  more  specific  about what has to be displayed for a utility. The
       standard developers considered it insufficient to allow a display of only the synopsis without  giving  a
       short description of what each option and operand does.

       The  ``purpose''  entry  to  be  included  in  the database can be similar to the section title (less the
       numeric prefix) from this volume of POSIX.1‐2017 for each utility.  These titles  are  similar  to  those
       used in historical systems for this purpose.

       See <u>mailx</u> for rationale concerning the default paginator.

       The  caveat  in the <u>LC_CTYPE</u> description was added because it is not a requirement that an implementation
       provide reference pages for all of its supported locales on  each  system;  changing  <u>LC_CTYPE</u>  does  not
       necessarily  translate  the reference page into another language. This is equivalent to the current state
       of <u>LC_MESSAGES</u> in POSIX.1‐2008—locale-specific messages are not yet a requirement.

       The historical <u>MANPATH</u> variable is not included in POSIX because no attempt is  made  to  specify  naming
       conventions  for  reference  page  files,  nor  even  to  mandate  that  they  are  files at all. On some
       implementations they could be a true database, a hypertext file, or even fixed  strings  within  the  <u>man</u>
       executable.  The  standard  developers  considered the portability of reference pages to be outside their
       scope of work. However, users should be aware that <u>MANPATH</u> is  implemented  on  a  number  of  historical
       systems  and  that  it  can  be  used  to  tailor the search pattern for reference pages from the various
       categories (utilities, functions, file formats, and so on) when  the  system  administrator  reveals  the
       location and conventions for reference pages on the system.

       The  keyword  search can rely on at least the text of the section titles from these utility descriptions,
       and the implementation may add more keywords. The term ``section titles'' refers to the strings such as:

           man — Display system documentation
           ps — Report process status
