       mdoc update - <b><a href="../man5/mdoc.5.html">mdoc</a></b>(5) documentation format support

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>mdoc</b> <b>update</b> [OPTIONS]* ASSEMBLIES

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>mdoc</b> <b>update</b> is responsible for the following:

       <b>*</b>      Creating  documentation  stubs  based  on  <u>ASSEMBLIES</u>.   The stub-creation process will create new
              <b><a href="../man5/mdoc.5.html">mdoc</a></b>(5) XML files for each type within <u>ASSEMBLIES</u>, and provide documentation stubs for each member
              of those types.

       <b>*</b>      Update documentation stubs based on <u>ASSEMBLIES</u>.  Existing <b><a href="../man5/mdoc.5.html">mdoc</a></b>(5) documentation can be updated  to
              reflect  changes  within  <u>ASSEMBLIES</u>,  such  as added types and members, while preserving existing
              documentation.

              In some limited circumstances, renames will be tracked, minimizing the documentation  burden  when
              e.g. a parameter is renamed.

       <b>mdoc</b>  <b>update</b>  does  not  rely  on  documentation  found  within  source  code,  though  it can import XML
       Documentation Comments via the <b>-i</b> option.

       See <b><a href="../man1/mdoc.1.html">mdoc</a></b>(1) and <b><a href="../man5/mdoc.5.html">mdoc</a></b>(5) for more information.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--delete</b>
              Allow <b>mdoc</b> <b>update</b> to delete members from  documentation  files.   The  only  members  deleted  are
              members  which  are  no longer present within <u>ASSEMBLIES</u> and are not present in any other assembly
              versions.

              If a type is no longer present, the documentation file is <u>not</u> deleted, but is instead  <u>renamed</u>  to
              have a <b>.remove</b>  extension.

              Version  detection  is done with the <u>//AssemblyVersion</u> elements; if there are no <u>//AssemblyVersion</u>
              elements for a given <u>&lt;Type&gt;</u> or <u>&lt;Member/&gt;</u>, then the <u>&lt;Type&gt;</u> will be  renamed  and/or  the  <u>&lt;Member/&gt;</u>
              will be removed.

       <b>--exceptions</b>[=<u>SOURCES</u>]
              EXPERIMENTAL.   This  is  not  100% reliable, but is intended to serve as an aid for documentation
              writers.

              Inspect member bodies to determine what exceptions can be generated from the member.

              <u>SOURCES</u> is an optional comma-separated list of the following sources that should be  searched  for
              exceptions:

                      added   Only generate &lt;exception/&gt; elements for members
                                added during the current program execution.
                                This keeps mdoc-update from re-generating
                                &lt;exception/&gt; elements for all members (and thus
                                prevents re-insertion for members that had the
                                &lt;exception/&gt; elements removed).
                      all     Find exceptions created in the member itself,
                                references to members in the same assembly,
                                and references to members in dependent
                                assemblies.
                      asm     Find exceptions created in the member itself and
                                references to members within the same assembly
                                as the member.
                      depasm  Find exceptions created in the member itself and
                                references to members within dependent
                                assemblies.

              If  <u>SOURCES</u>  isn't  provided  (the default), then only exceptions created within the member itself
              will be documented.

              LIMITATIONS: Exception searching is currently implemented by looking for the exception types  that
              are explicitly created based on the known compile-time types.  This has the following limitations:

              <b>*</b>      This  will not find exceptions which are implicit to the IL, such as NullReferenceException
                     and IndexOutOfRangeException.

              <b>*</b>      This will find exceptions which are <u>not</u> thrown, e.g.

                         public void CreateAnException ()
                         {
                             Exception e = new Exception ();
                         }

              <b>*</b>      This will not "follow" delegate and interface calls:

                         public void UsesDelegates ()
                         {
                             Func&lt;int, int&gt; a = x =&gt; {throw new Exception ();};
                             a (4);
                         }

                     The function <u>UsesDelegates()</u> won't have any exceptions documented.

              <b>*</b>      This will find  exceptions  which  "cannot  happen",  such  as  ArgumentNullExceptions  for
                     arguments which are "known" to be non-null:

                         public void A ()
                         {
                             B ("this parameter isn't null");
                         }

                         public void B (string s)
                         {
                             if (s == null)
                                 throw new ArgumentNullException ("s");
                         }

                     For  the  above, if <b>--exceptions=asm</b> is provided then <u>A()</u> will be documented as throwing an
                     ArgumentNullException, which cannot happen.

       <b>-f</b>=<u>FLAG</u>
              Specify a flag to alter behavior.  Valid flags include:

              <b>no-assembly-versions</b>
                     See the <b>-fno-assembly-versions</b> documentation, below.

       <b>-fno-assembly-versions</b>
              Do not generate <u>/Type/AssemblyInfo/AssemblyVersion</u> and <u>/Type/Members/Member/AssemblyInfo</u> elements.

              This is useful to prevent "churn" during updates.  Normally, if a type or  member  hasn't  changed
              but  the assembly version has changed, then all types and members will be updated to include a new
              <u>//AssemblyVersion</u> element,  thus  increasing  the  amount  of  changes  that  need  review  before
              committing (assuming all changes are actually reviewed before commit).

              WARNING: This <u>will</u> interact badly with the <b>--delete</b> option, as <b>--delete</b> uses the <u>//AssemblyVersion</u>
              elements  to  track  version  changes.   Thus,  if  you have a member which is present in an early
              assembly   version   and   is   removed   in   a   subsequent   assembly    version,    such    as
              <u>System.Text.UTF8Encoding.GetBytes(string)</u> (which is present in .NET 1.0 but not in .NET 2.0), then
              the  member  will  be  removed when the <b>--delete</b> <b>-fno-assembly-versions</b> options are specified, the
              member was present in an earlier version of the assembly, and the current version of the  assembly
              does not contain the member.

              Consequently, this option should <u>only</u> be specified if types and members will <u>never</u> be removed from
              an assembly.

       <b>-i</b>, <b>--import</b>=<u>FILE</u>
              Import documentation found within <u>FILE</u>.

              <u>FILE</u> may contain either <u>csc</u> <u>/doc</u> XML or <u>ECMA-335</u> XML.

       <b>-L</b>, <b>--lib</b>=<u>DIRECTORY</u>
              Add <u>DIRECTORY</u> to the assembly search path, so that dependencies of <u>ASSEMBLIES</u> can be found without
              documenting those assemblies.

       <b>-o</b>, <b>--out</b>=<u>DIRECTORY</u>
              Place the generated stubs into <u>DIRECTORY</u>.

              When updating documentation, <u>DIRECTORY</u> is also the source directory.

       <b>-r</b>=<u>ASSEMBLY</u>
              <u>ASSEMBLY</u>  is  a dependency for one of <u>ASSEMBLIES</u> which should <u>not</u> be documented but is required to
              process one of <u>ASSEMBLIES</u>.  Add the directory containing <u>ASSEMBLY</u> to the assembly search path.

              This option is equivalent to specifying <b>-L</b> `<u>dirname</u> ASSEMBLY`.

       <b>--since</b>=<u>VERSION</u>
              When <u>updating</u> documentation for an assembly, if a type or member is encountered which didn't exist
              in the previous version of the assembly a <b>&lt;since</b> <b>version="</b><u>VERSION</u><b>"/&gt;</b> element will be inserted.

       <b>--type</b>=<u>TYPE</u>
              Only update documentation for the type <u>TYPE</u>.

       <b>-h,</b> <b>-?,</b> <b>--help</b>
              Display a help message and exit.
