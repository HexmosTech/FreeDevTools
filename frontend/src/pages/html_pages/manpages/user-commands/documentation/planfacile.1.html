</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       planfacile - A document compiler.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>planfacile</b> [options] [files]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>PlanFacile</b>  is  a  document  compiler,  designed  for  table  of  contents  computation.  More precisely,
       <b>PlanFacile</b> considers that a document is a set of concepts linked by dependencies. <b>PlanFacile</b> generates  a
       document  using  those  ideas, sorted in order to read it from the begininng to the end with a minimum of
       cross references to further parts of the document.

       <b>PlanFacile</b> generates only non-formated documents, such as HTML or LaTeX sources.

</pre><h4><b>BASIC</b> <b>GRAMAR</b></h4><pre>
       For a common use of <b>PlanFacile</b>, it is not necessary to know all the language of <b>PlanFacile</b>. The  goal  of
       this section is to present the minimum necessary to know how to write a document.

   <b>Document</b>
       <b>Ideas</b>  A  document,  as said before, is a set of ideas the author wants to communicate to the reader. One
       idea is a part of the document that can be represented by a title. For example, if the writer  sees  that
       one  title  does  not  accurately  represent the text of the same idea, he should just make sure that two
       concepts are not put in one <u>#idea</u> command... The syntax of an idea is quite simple :

       <b>#idea{</b><u>reference</u><b>}</b><u>title</u><b>#text</b>

       <u>text</u>

       <b>#end</b>

       Also, some ideas are dependent in one document,  so  they  are  linked  by  dependencies  (See  paragraph
       Dependencies).

       <b>Automatic</b>  <b>ideas</b> Sometimes, <b>PlanFacile</b> adds an idea to the document. In that case, the writer can replace
       the default text by an idea that suits the document. To do this, there are two commands, which  are  like
       <u>#idea</u> :

       <b>#missing{</b><u>index</u><b>}{</b><u>reference</u><b>}</b><u>title</u><b>#text</b>

       <u>text</u>

       <b>#end</b>

       The <u>index</u> parameter is given by <b>PlanFacile</b>, in the default message...

       In the same way :

       <b>#generic{</b><u>parent</u> <u>reference</u><b>}{</b><u>reference</u><b>}</b><u>title</u><b>#text</b>

       <u>text</u>

       <b>#end</b>

       <b>Dependencies</b> In a document with ideas about the same subject, it is quite natural that ideas need some of
       the others to be understood by the reader.  This relation is a dependency between ideas.

       If the writer puts a dependency in the text of idea A to the idea B, this means that the reader will need
       to understand idea B before reading idea A in order to understand this last idea.

       The syntax of a dependency, in its simplest form, is :

       <b>#dep{</b><u>reference</u><b>}{#depref}{}</b>

       However,  the  writer may need to add a positive number to specify the weighting of the dependency if the
       organisation of the document is not the right one, even if the writer has put the correct dependencies :

       <b>#dep{</b><u>pertinence</u><b>}{</b><u>reference</u><b>}{#depref}{}</b>

       The <u>reference</u> must be one of the words used in the <u>#idea</u> command.

   <b>Complete</b> <b>source</b> <b>code</b>
       The ideas are not sufficient to produce a document.  To complete a source code, the writer needs to learn
       a bit more about the language of <b>PlanFacile</b>.

       <b>Standard</b> The first command of the source can be <u>#standard</u>, that indicates to <b>PlanFacile</b> to load  standard
       definitions,  to  be  able to produce a document in LaTeX or in HTML (more formats will be present in the
       future).

       <b>Options</b> <b>and</b> <b>macros</b> When the writer uses the command <u>#standard</u>, the compiler will be able to generate  all
       formats. The writer must indicate his choice with some commands.

       A choice, such as the output format, can be set with an option :

       <b>#option{</b><u>optionname</u><b>}</b>

       and a text parameter can be set with a macro, for a very specific use :

       <b>#define{</b><u>parametername</u><b>}{</b><u>value</u><b>}</b>

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>PlanFacile</b>  uses  36 options to modify its behavior. Listing all of these here is not interesting, as the
       <u>-h</u> option gives some help about all options.

       Some options are often useful :

       <b>-o</b> <u>output</u> <u>file</u> specify the output file, to write the document ;

       <b>-O</b> <u>option</u> define a compiler option, as the <u>#option</u> command. Then the user has the possibility to set some
       parameters at the time of compilation ;

       <b>-d</b> ignore invalid dependencies. Useful when the writer wants to compile a part of a document, to check if
       this part is error free ;

       <b>-A</b> ignore undefined automatic ideas. Sometimes, <b>PlanFacile</b> adds some ideas to complete the document. This
       option avoids an error when an automatic idea appears.
