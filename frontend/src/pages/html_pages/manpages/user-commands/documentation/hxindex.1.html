       hxindex - insert an index into an HTML document

       <b>hxindex</b>  [<b>-t</b>]  [<b>-x</b>]  [<b>-n</b>|<b>-N</b>]  [<b>-f</b>]  [<b>-r</b>]  [<b>-c</b>  <u>class</u>[<b>,</b><u>class</u>...]] [<b>-b</b> <u>base</u>] [<b>-i</b> <u>indexdb</u>] [<b>-s</b> <u>template</u>] [<b>-u</b>
       <u>phrase</u>] [<b>-O</b> <u>element</u>[<b>,</b><u>element</u>...]] [<b>-X</b> <u>element</u>[<b>,</b><u>element</u>...]] [--] [<u>file-or-URL</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>hxindex</b> looks for terms to be indexed in a document, collects them, turns them  into  target  anchors
       and  creates  a  sorted  index  as  an  HTML list, which is inserted at the place of a placeholder in the
       document. The resulting document is written to standard output.

       The index is inserted at the place of a comment of the form

           &lt;!--index--&gt;

       or between two comments of the form

           &lt;!--begin-index--&gt;
           ...
           &lt;!--end-index--&gt;

       In the latter case, all existing content between the two comments is removed first.

       Index terms are either elements of type <u>&lt;dfn&gt;</u> or  elements  with  a  class  attribute  of  <u>"index".</u>  (For
       backward  compatibility,  also  class  attributes  <u>"index-inst"</u>  and  <u>"index-def"</u>  are recognized.) <u>&lt;dfn&gt;</u>
       elements (and class <u>"index-def"</u>) are considered more important than elements with class <u>"index"</u> and  will
       appear in bold in the generated index.

       The option <b>-c</b> adds additional classes, that are aliases for <u>"index"</u>.

       By  default,  the  contents  of  the  element  are  taken  as  the  index term.  Here are two examples of
       occurrences of the index term "shoe":

           A &lt;dfn&gt;shoe&lt;/dfn&gt; is a piece of clothing that...
           completed by a leather &lt;span class="index"&gt;shoe&lt;/span&gt;...

       If the term to be indexed is not equal to the contents of the element, the <u>title</u> attribute can be used to
       give the correct term:

           ... &lt;dfn title="shoe"&gt;Shoes&lt;/dfn&gt; are pieces of clothing that...
           ... with two leather &lt;span class="index" title="shoe"&gt;shoes&lt;/span&gt;...

       The <u>title</u> attribute must also be used when the index term  is  a  subterm  of  another.  Subterms  appear
       indented  in  the  index,  under  their  head  term.  To define a subterm, use a <u>title</u> attribute with two
       exclamation marks ("!!") between the term and the subterm, like this:

           &lt;dfn title="shoe!!leather"&gt;...&lt;/dfn&gt;
           &lt;dfn title="shoe!!invention of"&gt;...&lt;/dfn&gt;
           &lt;em class="index" title="shoe!!protective!!steel nosed"&gt;...&lt;/em&gt;

       As the last example above shows, there can be multiple levels of sub-subterms.

       The <u>title</u> attribute also allows multiple index terms to be  associated  with  a  single  occurrence.  The
       multiple  terms  are  separated  with  a vertical bar ("|"). Compare the following examples with the ones
       above:

           &lt;dfn title="shoe|boot"&gt;...&lt;/dfn&gt;
           &lt;dfn title="shoe!!invention of|inventions!!shoe"&gt;...&lt;/dfn&gt;

       These two elements both insert two terms into the index. Note that  the  second  example  above  combines
       subterms and multiple terms.

       It is possible to run index on a file that already has an index. The old target anchors and the old index
       will be removed before being re-generated.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The following options are supported:

       <b>-t</b>        By  default, <b>hxindex</b> adds an ID attribute to the element that contains the occurrence of a term
                 and <u>also</u> inserts an <u>&lt;a&gt;</u> element inside it with a <u>name</u> attribute equal to the  ID.  This  is  to
                 allow  old  browsers that ignore ID attributes, such as Netscape 4, to find the target as well.
                 The <b>-t</b> option suppresses the <u>&lt;a&gt;</u> element.

       <b>-x</b>        This option turns on XML syntax conventions: empty elements will end in <u>/&gt;</u> instead of <u>&gt;</u>  as  in
                 HTML.  <b>-x</b> implies <b>-t.</b>

       <b>-i</b> <u>indexdb</u>
                 <b>hxindex</b>  can  read  an initial index from a file and write the merged collection of index terms
                 back to that file. This allows an index to span several documents. The <b>-i</b>  option  is  used  to
                 give the name of the file that contains the index.

       <b>-b</b> <u>base</u>   This option is useful in combination with <b>-i</b> to give the base URL reference of the document. By
                 default,  <b>hxindex</b>  will store links to occurrences in the <u>indexdb</u> file in the form <u>#anchor</u>, but
                 when <b>-b</b> is given, the links will look like <u>base#anchor</u> instead.

                 When used in combination with <b>-n</b>, the title attributes of the links will contain the  title  of
                 the  document that contains the term. The title is inserted before the <u>template</u> (see option <b>-s</b>)
                 and separated from it with a comma and a space. E.g., if <b>hxindex</b> is called with

                     hxindex -i termdb -n -base myfile.html myfile.html

                 and the termdb already contains an entry for "foo" in in section "3.1"  of  a  document  called
                 "file2.html"  with  title  "The  foos",  then the generated index will contain an entry such as
                 this:

                     foo, &lt;a href="file2.html#foo"
                       title="The foos, section 3.1"&gt;3.1&lt;/a&gt;

       <b>-c</b> <u>class</u><b>,</b><u>class</u><b>,</b>...
                 Normal index terms are recognized because they have a class of  <u>"index".</u>  The  <b>-c</b>  option  adds
                 additional,  comma-separated  class names that will be considered aliases for <u>"index"</u>. E.g., <b>-c</b>
                 <b>instance</b> will make sure that <b>&lt;span</b> <b>class="instance"&gt;term&lt;/span&gt;</b> is recognized as a term for the
                 index.

       <b>-n</b>        By default, the index consists of links with "#" as the anchor text.  Option <b>-n</b> causes the link
                 text to consist of the section numbers of the sections in which the terms occur,  falling  back
                 to  "without number" (see option <b>-u</b> below) if no section number could be found. Section numbers
                 are found by looking for the nearest preceding start tag with a class of "secno"  or  "no-num".
                 In  the  case  of "secno", the contents of that element are taken as the section number. In the
                 case of "no-num" the section is assumed to have no  number  and  <b>hxindex</b>  will  print  "without
                 number"  instead. These classes are also used by <b><a href="../man1/hxnum.1.html">hxnum</a></b>(1), so it is useful to run <b>hxindex</b> <u>after</u>
                 <b>hxnum</b>, e.g.,

                     hxnum myfile.html | hxindex -n &gt;mynewfile.html

       <b>-N</b>        With this option, the anchor text of the links in the index is the full title of the section in
                 which the term occurs. The title of the section is the nearest preceding H1, H2, H3, H4, H5  or
                 H6  element, or the document's title if there is no preceding H* element. This option cannot be
                 used together with <b>-n</b>.  If both are used, the last one specified wins.

       <b>-s</b> <u>template</u>
                 When option <b>-n</b> is used, the link will have a title attribute and the <u>template</u>  determines  what
                 it contains. The default is "section %s", where the %s is a placeholder for the section number.
                 In other words, the index will contain entries like this:

                     term, &lt;a href="#term" title="section 7.8"&gt;7.8&lt;/a&gt;

                 Some examples:

                     hxindex -n -s 'chapter %s'
                     hxindex -n -s 'part %s'
                     hxindex -n -s 'hoofdstuk %s' -u 'zonder nummer'

                 This option is only useful in combination with <b>-n</b>

       <b>-u</b> <u>phrase</u> When  option  <b>-n</b> is used to display section numbers, references for which no section number can
                 be found are shown as <u>phrase</u> instead. The default is "??".

                 This option is only useful in combination with <b>-n</b>

       <b>-f</b>        Remove <u>title</u> attributes that were used for the index as well as the comments that  delimit  the
                 inserted index. This avoids that browsers display these attributes. Note that <b>hxindex</b> cannot be
                 run again on its own output if this option is used. (Mnemonic: "<b>f</b>reeze" or "<b>f</b>inal".)

       <b>-r</b>        Do not ignore trailing punctuation when sorting index terms. E.g., if two terms are written as

                     &lt;dfn&gt;foo,&lt;/dfn&gt;... &lt;span class=index&gt;foo&lt;/span&gt;

                 <b>hxindex</b>  will  normally ignore the comma and treat them as the same term, but with <b>-r,</b> they are
                 treated  as  different.  This  affects  trailing  commas  (,),  semicolons  (;),  colons   (:),
                 exclamations  mark  (!),  question  marks  (?)   and full stops (.). A final full stop is never
                 ignored if there are two or more in the term, to protect abbreviations  ("B.C.")  and  ellipsis
                 ("more...").  This  does  <u>not</u>  affect how the index term is printed (it is always printed as it
                 appears in the text), only how it is compared to similar terms. (Mnemonic: "<b>r</b>aw".)

       <b>-O</b> <u>element</u><b>,</b><u>element</u><b>,</b>...
                 If <b>-O</b> is present, only elements with the given names will be indexed. E.g.,

                     hxindex -O span,i,em

                 means that <b>hxindex</b> will only look for <u>class="index"</u> (and other classes, according to <b>-c</b>) on the
                 elements <b>span,</b> <b>i</b> and <b>em.</b>  The argument of <b>-O</b> must be a comma-separated list of  element  names.
                 Note  that  this  does  not  affect  the  element <b>dfn.</b>  It will always be indexed as a defining
                 instance.

       <b>-X</b> <u>element</u><b>,</b><u>element</u><b>,</b><u>...</u>
                 The option <b>-X</b> excludes the given elements from being indexed. E.g.,

                     hxindex -X ul,ol

                 makes sure that <b>ul</b> and <b>ol</b>  elements  are  not  indexed,  even  if  they  have  a  <u>class="index"</u>
                 attribute. This does not exclude their children from being indexed. E.g.,

                     &lt;ul class=index&gt;
                      &lt;li class=index&gt;foo
                      &lt;li class=index&gt;bar
                      &lt;li&gt;baz
                     &lt;/ul&gt;

                 will  add  <u>foo</u> and <u>bar</u> to the index, but not the whole content of the <b>ul</b> element (<u>foo</u> <u>bar</u> <u>baz</u>).
                 If both <b>-O</b> and <b>-X</b> are given and an element occurs in both options, it will be excluded. E.g.,

                     hxindex -X p,h1,ul -O em,span,h1,h2

                 will cause <b>hxindex</b> to only look for class  attributes  on  <b>em,</b>  <b>span</b>  and  <b>h2,</b>  because  <b>h1</b>  is
                 excluded.

</pre><h4><b>OPERANDS</b></h4><pre>
       The following operand is supported:

       <u>file-or-URL</u>
                 The  name  of an HTML or XML file or the URL of one. If absent, or if the file is "-", standard
                 input is read instead.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       The following exit values are returned:

       <b>0</b>         Successful completion.

       <b>&gt;0</b>        An error occurred in parsing the HTML file.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       The input is assumed to be in UTF-8, but the current locale is used to determine the sorting order of the
       index terms. I.e., <b>hxindex</b> looks at  the  LANG,  LC_ALL  and/or  LC_COLLATE  environment  variables.  See
       <b><a href="../man1/locale.1.html">locale</a></b>(1).

       To  use  a  proxy to retrieve remote files, set the environment variables <b>http_proxy</b> or <b>ftp_proxy</b>.  E.g.,
       <b>http_proxy="<a href="http://localhost">http://localhost</a>:8080/"</b>

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Assumes UTF-8 as input. Doesn't expand character entities (apart from the standard ones: "&amp;amp;", "&amp;lt;",
       "&amp;gt" and "&amp;quot"). Instead, pipe the input through <b><a href="../man1/hxunent.1.html">hxunent</a></b>(1) and, if needed, <b><a href="../man1/asc2xml.1.html">asc2xml</a></b>(1) to  convert  it
       to UTF-8.

       Remote  files  (specified  with a URL) are currently only supported for HTTP. Password-protected files or
       files that depend on HTTP "cookies" are not handled. (You can use tools such as  <b><a href="../man1/curl.1.html">curl</a></b>(1)  or  <b><a href="../man1/wget.1.html">wget</a></b>(1)  to
       retrieve such files.)

       The accessibility of an index, even when generated with option <b>-n</b>, is poor.
