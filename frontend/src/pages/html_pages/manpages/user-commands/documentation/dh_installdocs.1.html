</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       dh_installdocs - install documentation into package build directories

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>dh_installdocs</b> [<u>debhelper</u> <u>options</u>] [<b>-A</b>] [<b>-X</b><u>item</u>] [<u>file</u> ...]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>dh_installdocs</b> is a debhelper program that is responsible for installing documentation into
       <u>usr/share/doc/package</u> in package build directories.

       In compat 10 and earlier, <b><a href="../man1/dh_install.1.html">dh_install</a></b>(1) may be a better tool for handling the upstream documentation,
       when upstream's own build system installs all the desired documentation correctly.  In this case,
       <b>dh_installdocs</b> is still useful for installing packaging related documentation (e.g. the <u>debian/copyright</u>
       file).

       From debhelper compatibility level 11 on, <b>dh_install</b> will fall back to looking in <u>debian/tmp</u> for files,
       if it does not find them in the current directory (or wherever you've told it to look using <b>--sourcedir</b>).

       In compat 11 and later, <b>dh_installdocs</b> offers many of the features that <b><a href="../man1/dh_install.1.html">dh_install</a></b>(1) also has.
       Furthermore, <b>dh_installdocs</b> also supports the <b>nodoc</b> build profile to exclude documentation (regardless of
       compat level).

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       debian/<u>package</u>.docs
           List documentation files to be installed into <u>package</u>.

           Supports substitution variables in compat 13 and later as documented in <b><a href="../man7/debhelper.7.html">debhelper</a></b>(7).

       <u>debian/copyright</u>
           The  copyright  file  is  installed  into  all  packages,  unless  a  more specific copyright file is
           available.

       debian/<u>package</u>.copyright
       debian/<u>package</u>.README.Debian
       debian/<u>package</u>.TODO
           Each of these files is automatically installed if present for a <u>package</u>.

       <u>debian/README.Debian</u>
       <u>debian/TODO</u>
           These files are installed into the first binary package listed in debian/control.

           Note that <u>README.debian</u> files are also installed as <u>README.Debian</u>, and <u>TODO</u> files will  be  installed
           as <u>TODO.Debian</u> in non-native packages.

       debian/<u>package</u>.doc-base
           Installed as doc-base control files. Note that the doc-id will be determined from the <b>Document:</b> entry
           in  the  doc-base  control  file  in  question. In the event that multiple doc-base files in a single
           source package share the same doc-id, they will be installed to usr/share/doc-base/package instead of
           usr/share/doc-base/doc-id.

       debian/<u>package</u>.doc-base.*
           If your package needs to register more than one document, you need multiple doc-base files,  and  can
           name  them  like  this.  In  the  event that multiple doc-base files of this style in a single source
           package share the same doc-id, they will be  installed  to  usr/share/doc-base/package-*  instead  of
           usr/share/doc-base/doc-id.

           Please  be  aware  that  this  deduplication is currently done in memory only, so for now it requires
           <b>dh_installdocs</b> to be called no more than  once  during  the  package  build.  Calling  <b>dh_installdocs</b>
           <b>-p</b><u>package</u>  in  combination  with  using  <u>debian/package.doc-base.*</u>  files  can  lead to uninstallable
           packages. See &lt;https://bugs.debian.org/980903&gt; for details.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-A</b>, <b>--all</b>
           Install all files specified by command line parameters in ALL packages acted on.

       <b>-X</b><u>item</u>, <b>--exclude=</b><u>item</u>
           Exclude files that contain <u>item</u> anywhere in their filename  from  being  installed.  Note  that  this
           includes doc-base files.

       <b>--sourcedir=</b><u>dir</u>
           Look  in  the specified directory for files to be installed.  This option requires compat 11 or later
           (it is silently ignored in compat 10 or earlier).

           Note that this is not the same as the <b>--sourcedirectory</b> option used by the  <b>dh_auto_</b><u>*</u>  commands.  You
           rarely  need  to  use this option, since <b>dh_installman</b> automatically looks for files in <u>debian/tmp</u> in
           debhelper compatibility level 11 and above.

       <b>--doc-main-package=</b><u>main-package</u>
           Set the main package for a documentation package.  This is used to install the documentation  of  the
           documentation package in <u>/usr/share/doc/main-package</u> as recommended by the Debian policy manual 3.9.7
           in ยง12.3.

           In compat 11 (or later), this option is only useful if debhelper's auto-detection of the main package
           is  wrong.   The  option can also be used to silence a warning from debhelper when the auto-detection
           fails but the default happens to be correct.

           This option cannot be used when <b>dh_installdocs</b> is instructed to act on  multiple  packages.   If  you
           need  this  option,  you  will  generally need to combine it with <b>-p</b> to ensure exactly one package is
           acted on.

           Please keep in mind that some  documentation  (the  copyright  file,  README.Debian,  etc.)  will  be
           unaffected by this option.

       <b>--link-doc=</b><u>package</u>
           Make the documentation directory of all packages acted on be a symlink to the documentation directory
           of <u>package</u>. This has no effect when acting on <u>package</u> itself, or if the documentation directory to be
           created  already  exists  when <b>dh_installdocs</b> is run. To comply with policy, <u>package</u> must be a binary
           package that comes from the same source package.

           debhelper will try to avoid installing files into linked documentation directories that  would  cause
           conflicts  with  the  linked  package.  The  <b>-A</b>  option  will  have no effect on packages with linked
           documentation directories, and <u>copyright</u>, <u>changelog</u>,  <u>README.Debian</u>,  and  <u>TODO</u>  files  will  not  be
           installed.

           (An older method to accomplish the same thing, which is still supported, is to make the documentation
           directory of a package be a dangling symlink, before calling <b>dh_installdocs</b>.)

           Please  note  that  this  option  only applies to the documentation directory for the package itself.
           When the package ships documentation for another package (e.g. see <b>--doc-main-package</b>), it  will  not
           use a symlink for the documentation of the other package.

           <b>CAVEAT</b> <b>1</b>: If a previous version of the package was built without this option and is now built with it
           (or vice-versa), it requires a "dir to symlink" (or "symlink to dir") migration.  Since debhelper has
           no knowledge of previous versions, you have to enable this migration itself.

           This  can  be  done  by  providing  a "debian/<u>package</u>.maintscript" file and using <b><a href="../man1/dh_installdeb.1.html">dh_installdeb</a></b>(1) to
           provide the relevant maintainer script snippets.

           <b>CAVEAT</b> <b>2</b>: The use of <b>--link-doc</b> should only be done when the packages have same "architecture"  type.
           A  link from an architecture independent package to an architecture dependent package (or vice versa)
           will not work.  Since compat 10, debhelper will actively reject unsupported combinations.

       <u>file</u> ...
           Install these files as documentation into the first package acted on. (Or in all packages  if  <b>-A</b>  is
           specified).

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       This is an example of a <u>debian/package.docs</u> file:

         README
         TODO
         debian/notes-for-maintainers.txt
         docs/manual.txt
         docs/manual.pdf
         docs/manual-html/

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       Note  that  <b>dh_installdocs</b> will happily copy entire directory hierarchies if you ask it to (similar to <b>cp</b>
       <b>-a</b>). If it is asked to install a directory, it will install the complete contents of the directory.
