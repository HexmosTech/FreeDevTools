</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       nfc-emulate-uid - NFC target emulation command line tool based on libnfc

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>nfc-emulate-uid</b> [<u>OPTIONS</u>] [<u>UID</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>nfc-emulate-uid</b>  is  a  tag emulation tool that allows one to choose any tag UID. Tag emulation is one of
       the main added features in NFC. But to  avoid  abuse  of  existing  systems,  manufacturers  of  the  NFC
       controller  intentionally  did  not  support emulation of fully customized UID but only of "random" UIDs,
       which always start with 0x08.  The nfc-emulate-uid tool demonstrates that this can still  be  done  using
       transmission of raw frames, and the desired UID can be optionally specified.

       This makes it a serious threat for security systems that rely only on the uniqueness of the UID.

       Unfortunately,  this example can't directly start in fully customisable target mode. Just after launching
       this example, you will have to go through the hardcoded initial  anti-collision  with  the  0x08-prefixed
       UID.   To  achieve  it, you can e.g. send a RATS (Request for Answer To Select) command by using a second
       NFC device (placed in target's field) and launching nfc-list or nfc-anticol. After this first  step,  you
       now  have a NFC device (configured as target) that really emulates a custom UID.  You could view it using
       the second NFC device with nfc-list.

       Timing control is very important for a successful anti-collision sequence:

       - The emulator must be very fast to react: Using the ACR122 device gives many timing issues, "PN53x only"
       USB devices also give some timing issues but an embedded microprocessor would  probably  improve  greatly
       the situation.

       -  The  reader should not be too strict on timing (the standard is very strict). The OmniKey CardMan 5321
       is known to be very large on timings and is a good choice if you want to experiment  with  this  emulator
       with a tolerant reader.  Nokia NFC 6212 and Pegoda readers are much too strict and won't be fooled.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>UID</u> 8 hex digits format that represents desired UID (default is DEADBEEF).

</pre><h4><b>IMPORTANT</b></h4><pre>
       ACR122  devices (like touchatag, etc.) can be used by this example (with timing issues), but if something
       goes wrong, you will have to unplug/replug your device. This is not a <b>libnfc's</b> bug, this problem  is  due
       to ACR122's internal MCU in front of NFC chip (PN532).
