</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       verga - VERrilog simulator for tkGAte

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>verga</b> [-eslqi] [-d dtype] [-S script] [-P mods] [-t mod] [-B dir] [-D hash] [-W wmode] [files...]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Verga</u>  is  a  verilog simulator designed to be used with tkgate, but it can also be used as a stand-alone
       simulator.

       Verga documentation can be found at:

       https://bitbucket.org/starling13/tkgate

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The options are as follows:

       -e             Dump the list of error codes and associated messages that can be produced by  verga.  This
                      option is primarily for developer purposes.

       -s             Scan  a  Verilog  file  and  output information about its modules and nets. This option is
                      primarily used internally by tkgate.

       -l             Show the verga license.

       -q             Run in 'quiet' mode, suppressing extraneous messages.

       -i             Run in 'interactive' mode. This mode is intended primarily for use  when  verga  is  being
                      invoked by tkgate.

       -d dtype       Type of delays to use. Can be 'min', 'max' or 'typical'.

       -S script      Load simulation scripts for each '-S' switch.

       -P mod         Print the named module from the parsed structure for each '-P' specified.

       -t mod         Override the default and designate 'mod' as the top-level module.

       -B dir         Directory to use as base directory when loading files

       -D hash        Delete the input files after loading if 'hash' exactly matches a hash code computed on the
                      file  name. This option should only be used by tkgate which writes the file to simulate to
                      a temporary file before invoking the simulator.

       -W wmode       Mode for warning message handling. Can be 1 for "ignore warnings", 2 for "report  warnings
                      only  if  there  were  errors",  3  for  "always  report warnings" or 4 for "always report
                      warnings and stop simulator even if only warnings".

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b> <b>&amp;</b> <b>CREDITS</b></h4><pre>
       TkGate begin life as an undergraduate project at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) in 1987. At  that  time
       it  was  called  simply 'gate' and ran under the 'wm' window manager, a windowing system developed at CMU
       before X11 was widely used. In this incarnation it was used by  students  in  the  computer  architecture
       course  at  CMU  to develop a simple microprocessor (dubbed "The Bat Computer"). After laying dormant for
       several years, it was resurrected in 1991 and ported to  run  under  X11  with  the  Xlib  API.  In  this
       incarnation it was used several times by students in the introductory digital logic course, but after the
       author graduated and left CMU, it went into hibernation again. This Tcl/Tk incarnation was begun in 1998.
       While  there  is  certainly  some  cruftyness  in  the  implementation  in  places  due  to  the multiple
       reincarnations, many new features have been added since the older wm and X11 versions, and the  interface
       has been made much easier to use.
