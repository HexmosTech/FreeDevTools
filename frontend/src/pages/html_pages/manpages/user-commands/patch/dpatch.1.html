</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       dpatch - patch maintenance system for Debian

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>dpatch</b> <b>[</b><u>options</u><b>]</b> <u>command</u> <b>[</b><u>command-arguments</u><b>]</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>dpatch</b>  is an easy to use patch system for Debian packages, somewhat similar to the dbs package, but much
       simpler to use.

       It lets you store patches and other simple customization templates in <u>debian/patches</u> and  otherwise  does
       not  require much reorganization of your source tree. To get the patches applied at build time you simply
       need to include a makefile snippet and then depend on the <b>patch/unpatch</b> target  in  the  <b>build</b>  or  <b>clean</b>
       stage of <u>debian/rules</u>. For added flexibility, you can call <u>/usr/bin/dpatch</u> directly too.

</pre><h4><b>WARNING</b></h4><pre>
       <b>dpatch</b>  is  deprecated,  please  switch  to  the  `3.0 (quilt)' Debian source package format instead. See
       <u><a href="http://wiki.debian.org/Projects/DebSrc3.0">http://wiki.debian.org/Projects/DebSrc3.0</a>#FAQ</u> for a short guide on how to do it.

</pre><h4><b>GLOBAL</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       There are a few options which change the overall behaviour of dpatch, and have an effect on not only one,
       but most of the available commands.

       These global options are:

       <b>--workdir</b> <b>(-d)</b> <u>DIRECTORY</u>
              By default, dpatch applies patches to the source tree it was run from. With this option,  one  can
              change  that,  and  tell dpatch to work on a different tree, although taking the dpatches from the
              current one.

              Note that this will only pass a second argument to dpatch scriptlets, and will not change  to  the
              specified directory. To do that, use the <b>--chdir</b> option explained below.

       <b>--chdir</b> <b>(-c)</b>
              When using a different working directory than the current one, change there before trying to apply
              patches.

              This should be used together with the <b>--workdir</b> option.

       <b>--strict</b> <b>(-S)</b>
              Enable strict mode, which means that dpatch will bail out early even on warnings (like when trying
              to apply a patch which is already applied - normally it will simply skip it).

       <b>--force</b> <b>(-F)</b>
              Force the application or deapplication of patches, even if dpatch would normally skip them because
              the operation was already done earlier.

       <b>--with-cpp</b>
              Force  the  use  of  cpp.  Overrides use of <b>DPATCH_OPTION_CPP=1</b> option in <u>debian/patches/00options</u>
              file.

</pre><h4><b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Patch</b> <b>handling</b> <b>commands</b>
       There is a generic syntax for all patch handling commands, namely that, that the command itself  takes  a
       list  of  dpatch  names  to work with, then does what it is meant to do on all of them, in the exact same
       order it was specified on the command line.

       Then, there is a version of each patch handling command with an <b>-all</b> suffix,  which  does  not  take  any
       arguments, and performs the necessary action for each and every available dpatch.

       The  last  variation is a command with a <b>-until</b> or <b>-up-to</b> suffix, which takes only one argument: the name
       of a dpatch. The appropriate action will be performed on all dpatches up to and including this  specified
       one.

       <b>apply</b> <b>[</b><u>options</u><b>]</b>
       <b>patch</b> <b>[</b><u>options</u><b>]</b>
              Applies  one  or more dpatches to the working tree (the current directory, if not told otherwise).
              By default the specified patches will be applied in the exact same order they were specified.

              <b>Options</b>
                     <b>--stampdir=</b><u>directory</u><b>,</b> <b>-s=</b><u>directory</u>
                            Put stamp files into <u>directory</u> instead of the default <u>debian/patched</u>.
                     <b>--help</b> <b>(-h)</b>
                            Print a short help message about the command.
                     <b>--quiet</b> <b>(-q)</b>
                            Forces the command to not print anything.
                     <b>--verbose</b> <b>(-v)</b>
                            Disables hiding of the scriptlet output.

       <b>deapply</b> <b>[</b><u>options</u><b>]</b>
       <b>unpatch</b> <b>[</b><u>options</u><b>]</b>
              Deapplies one or more dpatches to the working tree (the current directory, if not told otherwise).
              By default the specified patches will be deapplied in the reverse order they were specified as one
              generally should deapply in reverse order (compared to the apply order, that is).

              <b>Options</b>
                     <b>--stampdir=</b><u>directory</u><b>,</b> <b>-s=</b><u>directory</u>
                            Use stamp files in <u>directory</u> instead of the default <u>debian/patched</u>.

                            Print a short help message about the command.
                     <b>--quiet</b> <b>(-q)</b>
                            Forces the command to not print anything.
                     <b>--verbose</b> <b>(-v)</b>
                            Disables hiding of the scriptlet output.

       <b>cat</b> <b>[</b><u>options</u><b>]</b>
              Print meta-information about a dpatch, such as its name, author and description (any of which  can
              be disabled with the appropriate option).

              <b>Options</b>
                     <b>--no-meta,</b> <b>--desc-only</b> <b>(-nm,</b> <b>-d)</b>
                            Only print the patch description.

       <b>list</b> <b>[</b><u>options</u><b>]</b>
              List  the  name  of  the  given  patches.  This commands is not really useful, except the <b>list-all</b>
              variant, which lists all available patches.

              <b>Options</b>
                     <b>--help</b> <b>(-h)</b>
                            Print a short help message about the command.

              <b>Options</b>
                     <b>--stampdir=</b><u>directory</u><b>,</b> <b>-s=</b><u>directory</u>
                            Use stamp files in <u>directory</u> instead of the default <u>debian/patched</u>.
                     <b>--help</b> <b>(-h)</b>
                            Print a short help message about the command.

                            Use stamp files in <u>directory</u> instead of the default <u>debian/patched</u>.
                     <b>--help</b> <b>(-h)</b>

       <b>call</b> <b>[</b><u>options</u><b>]</b>
              Call a dpatch with a user-specified argument. All arguments with a <b>pkg-</b> prefix is guaranteed to be
              unused by dpatch itself, and are reserved for use with this very command.

              This command is most useful for extracting custom meta-information from dpatch scriptlets.

              <b>Options</b>
                     <b>--argument=</b><u>arg</u> <b>(-a=</b><u>arg)</u>

                     <b>--quiet</b> <b>(-q)</b>
                            Forces the command to not print anything.

   <b>Miscellaneous</b> <b>commands</b>
       <b>patch-template</b> <b>[</b><u>options</u><b>]</b> <b>[</b><u>patchname</u><b>]</b> <b>[</b><u>description</u><b>]</b>
              Print a quasi-standard dpatch script template, based on the information give on the  command-line.
              If  a  <u>description</u>  given,  it  will  be  folded  at  about  72  characters  into  multiple  lines
              appropriately.

              When prepending the template to STDIN, the contents of the standard input will  be  printed  right
              after the template.

              <b>Options</b>
                     <b>--prepend</b> <b>(-p)</b>
                            Prepend the template to STDIN.
                     <b>--help</b> <b>(-h)</b>
                            Print a short help message about the command.

       <b>version</b>
              Prints the dpatch version number and exits.

</pre><h4><b>DPATCH</b> <b>IN</b> <b>DEBIAN</b> <b>PACKAGES</b></h4><pre>
       There  are  two  different  ways  to  use  dpatch  in  <u>debian/rules</u>:  calling  it  directly, or including
       <b><a href="../man7/dpatch.make.7.html">dpatch.make</a></b>(7). Only the former method will be described here - the latter has its own manual page.

       <u>NOTE</u>: The following examples also require adding the <b>.NOTPARALLEL</b> flag to the head of <u>debian/rules</u>  since
       the  dependency  lists rely on the order of the execution. Without <b>.NOTPARALLEL</b>, they execution order may
       be wrong with multiple make threads (the <u>-j</u> option).

       In most situations, one will want to run dpatch as soon during the build process, as possible.  How  that
       can  be  accomplished  depends  heavily  on  the  existing <u>debian/rules</u>. However, in common practice most
       packages have a <b>build</b> (or <b>build-stamp</b>), <b>config.status</b>, or  <b>configure</b>  (or  <b>configure-stamp</b>)  target.  The
       easiest  way  to make dpatching the very first thing, one only has to write a rule that calls dpatch, and
       add it to the list of prerequisites for the appropriate target (see above).

       Deapplying dpatches can be easy or a bit more tricky. If nothing in the <b>clean</b> rule touches files modified
       by dpatches (creating incompatible changes), you can safely add <b>unpatch</b> to the list of  the  <b>clean</b>  rules
       dependencies.

       If  the  patches  might  affect the build system, they should be deapplied after the source tree has been
       cleaned. To do this, rename the <b>clean</b> target to, say, <b>clean-patched</b>, write a rule that  calls  dpatch  to
       deapply the dpatches, and make a new <b>clean</b> rule that has <b>clean-patched</b> and <b>unpatch</b> as its prerequisites.

       Let  us  look at an example! First, let us look at the relevant parts of the original <u>debian/rules</u> of our
       imaginary package:

              config.status: configure
                   ./configure --prefix=<a href="file:/usr">/usr</a> --mandir=<a href="file:/usr/share">/usr/share</a>
              build: config.status
                   ${MAKE}
              clean:
                   $(testdir)
                   $(testroot)
                   ${MAKE} distclean
                   rm -rf debian/imaginary-package debian/files debian/substvars

       After dpatchifying, this would look like this:

              config.status: patch configure
                   ./configure --prefix=<a href="file:/usr">/usr</a> --mandir=<a href="file:/usr/share">/usr/share</a>
              build: config.status
                   ${MAKE}
              clean: clean-patched unpatch
              clean-patched:
                   $(testdir)
                   $(testroot)
                   ${MAKE} distclean
                   rm -rf debian/imaginary-package debian/files debian/substvars

              patch: patch-stamp
              patch-stamp:
                   dpatch apply-all
                   dpatch cat-all &gt;patch-stamp

              unpatch:
                   dpatch deapply-all
                   rm -rf patch-stamp debian/patched

   <b>Adding</b> <b>dpatch</b> <b>scriptlets</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>package</b>
       When using dpatch, one surely wants to tell the system what dpatches to apply, and which ones to discard.
       In the most common situation, one only needs to list the names of the dpatches (the filenames relative to
       <u>debian/patches</u>) in <u>debian/patches/00list</u>.  They usually have the extension <b>.dpatch</b> and the extension  can
       be   omitted,   thus   a  file  <b>debian/patches/01_one_patch.dpatch</b>  is  written  as  <b>01_one_patch</b>  inside
       <b>debian/patches/00list</b>

       However, there may be situations where something more flexible is needed, like applying the same patch on
       only two architectures, say, <b>m68k</b> and <b>powerpc</b>. One solve this in at least two very different ways: One is
       to list the same patch in both <u>debian/patches/00list.m68k</u> and <u>debian/patches/00list.powerpc</u>, the other is
       to use <b>DPATCH_OPTION_CPP=1</b> in <u>debian/patches/00options</u>.  00list file is passed through <b>cpp</b>  command  with
       <b>DEB_BUILD_ARCH</b>  variable  set  to the architecture, and <b>DEB_BUILD_ARCH_</b><u>architecture</u> being set to 1.  With
       cpp, our sample <u>debian/patches/00list</u> might look like this:

              01_manpage_typo
              #if defined(DEB_BUILD_ARCH_m68k) || defined(DEB_BUILD_ARCH_powerpc)
              /* This patch fixes a random build-time breakage on Macintosh boxen. */
              02_macintosh_foo
              #endif

   <b>Creating</b> <b>dpatch</b> <b>scriptlets</b>
       There are many ways to create dpatch scriptlets. They  are  simple,  executable  files,  which  follow  a
       standardised calling convention (documented in <b><a href="../man7/dpatch.7.html">dpatch</a></b>(7)).

       You can fire up your $EDITOR, or use <b>dpatch-edit-patch</b>, and you should be all set.

       For most cases, where the dpatch file is only to apply a simple patch, there is an even easier way:

              dpatch patch-template -p "01_some_patch" "A random patch" \
                   &lt;random.diff &gt;debian/patches/01_some_patch.dpatch

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <u>debian/patches/00list</u>
              The list of patches to apply, deapply, or otherwise fiddle with.

       <u>debian/patches/00list.</u><b>arch</b>

              building on the <b>arch</b> architecture.

       <u>/etc/dpatch.conf</u>
              System-wide configuration file for dpatch, for setting global options permanently.

       <u><a href="file:~/.dpatch.conf">~/.dpatch.conf</a></u>
