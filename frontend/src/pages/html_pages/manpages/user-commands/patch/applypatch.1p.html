</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       applypatch - apply 'makepatch' generated script to update a source tree

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>applypatch</b> [ <u>options</u> ] <u>patch-kit</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Applypatch</b> applies a patch kit as generated by the <b>makepatch</b> program. It performs the following actions:

       •   First,  it  will  extensively  verify that the patch kit is complete and did not get corrupted during
           transfer.

       •   Then it will apply some heuristics to verify that the directory in which the patch  will  be  applied
           does indeed contain the expected sources.

           If a corruption or verification error is detected, <b>applypatch</b> exits without making changes.

       •   If the kit is okay, and the directory seems to be the right one: it creates new files and directories
           as necessary.

       •   Then it runs the <b>patch</b> program to apply the patch to the source files.

       •   Upon completion, obsolete files, directories and .orig files are removed, file modes of new files are
           set, and the timestamps of all patched files are adjusted.

</pre><h4><b>Applypatch</b> <b>arguments</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Applypatch</b>  takes  one  argument,  the  name  of  the  patch kit as generated by <b>makepatch</b>. If no name is
       specified, the patch kit is read from standard input.

</pre><h4><b>Applypatch</b> <b>options</b></h4><pre>
       Options are matched case insensitive, and may be abbreviated to uniqueness.

       <b>-directory</b> <u>dir</u>
           The name of the source directory to be patched.

       <b>-check</b>
           Perform the checks on the patch kit and patch directory, but do not make any changes.

       <b>-force</b>
           Force continuation of the patch process even when corruption or  verification  errors  are  detected.
           This is very dangerous!

       <b>-retain</b>
           Do not remove patch backup files (with extension ".orig") upon completion.

       <b>-patch</b> <u>cmd</u>
           The  patch  command  to  be  used. Default is ""patch -p0 -N"".  Additionally, a ""-s"" will be added
           unless option <b>-verbose</b> was specified.

       <b>-verbose</b>
           This option will cause <b>applypatch</b> and the <b>patch</b> program to emit verbose progress information.

       <b>-quiet</b>
           This option will cause <b>applypatch</b> and the <b>patch</b> program to emit no progress information,  only  error
           messages.

</pre><h4><b>Environment</b> <b>variables</b></h4><pre>
       SIMPLE_BACKUP_SUFFIX
           The  suffix  used  by  (some  versions  of?)  <b>patch</b>  to  back up the originals of patched files. Upon
           completion, these files are removed by <b>applypatch</b> unless the option <b>-retain</b> was  specified.   Default
           value if "".orig"".
