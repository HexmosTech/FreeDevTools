       git-apply - Apply a patch to files and/or to the index

                 [-p&lt;n&gt;] [-C&lt;n&gt;] [--inaccurate-eof] [--recount] [--cached]
                 [--ignore-space-change | --ignore-whitespace]
                 [--whitespace=(nowarn|warn|fix|error|error-all)]
                 [--exclude=&lt;path&gt;] [--include=&lt;path&gt;] [--directory=&lt;root&gt;]
                 [--verbose | --quiet] [--unsafe-paths] [--allow-empty] [&lt;patch&gt;...]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Reads the supplied diff output (i.e. "a patch") and applies it to files. When running from a subdirectory
       in a repository, patched paths outside the directory are ignored. With the <b>--index</b> option, the patch is
       also applied to the index, and with the <b>--cached</b> option, the patch is only applied to the index. Without
       these options, the command applies the patch only to files, and does not require them to be in a Git
       repository.

       This command applies the patch but does not create a commit. Use <b><a href="../man1/git-am.1.html">git-am</a></b>(1) to create commits from patches
       generated by <b><a href="../man1/git-format-patch.1.html">git-format-patch</a></b>(1) and/or received by email.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       &lt;patch&gt;...
           The files to read the patch from.  <u>-</u> can be used to read from the standard input.

       --stat
           Instead of applying the patch, output diffstat for the input. Turns off "apply".

       --numstat
           Similar to <b>--stat</b>, but shows the number of added and deleted lines in decimal notation and the
           pathname without abbreviation, to make it more machine friendly. For binary files, outputs two <b>-</b>
           instead of saying <b>0</b> <b>0</b>. Turns off "apply".

       --summary
           Instead of applying the patch, output a condensed summary of information obtained from git diff
           extended headers, such as creations, renames, and mode changes. Turns off "apply".

       --check
           Instead of applying the patch, see if the patch is applicable to the current working tree and/or the
           index file and detects errors. Turns off "apply".

       --index
           Apply the patch to both the index and the working tree (or merely check that it would apply cleanly
           to both if <b>--check</b> is in effect). Note that <b>--index</b> expects index entries and working tree copies for
           relevant paths to be identical (their contents and metadata such as file mode must match), and will
           raise an error if they are not, even if the patch would apply cleanly to both the index and the
           working tree in isolation.

       --cached
           Apply the patch to just the index, without touching the working tree. If <b>--check</b> is in effect, merely
           check that it would apply cleanly to the index entry.

       --intent-to-add
           When applying the patch only to the working tree, mark new files to be added to the index later (see
           <b>--intent-to-add</b> option in <b><a href="../man1/git-add.1.html">git-add</a></b>(1)). This option is ignored unless running in a Git repository and
           <b>--index</b> is not specified. Note that <b>--index</b> could be implied by other options such as <b>--cached</b> or
           <b>--3way</b>.

       -3, --3way
           Attempt 3-way merge if the patch records the identity of blobs it is supposed to apply to and we have
           those blobs available locally, possibly leaving the conflict markers in the files in the working tree
           for the user to resolve. This option implies the <b>--index</b> option unless the <b>--cached</b> option is used,
           and is incompatible with the <b>--reject</b> option. When used with the <b>--cached</b> option, any conflicts are
           left at higher stages in the cache.

       --ours, --theirs, --union
           Instead of leaving conflicts in the file, resolve conflicts favouring our (or their or both) side of
           the lines. Requires --3way.

       --build-fake-ancestor=&lt;file&gt;
           Newer <u>git</u> <u>diff</u> output has embedded <u>index</u> <u>information</u> for each blob to help identify the original
           version that the patch applies to. When this flag is given, and if the original versions of the blobs
           are available locally, builds a temporary index containing those blobs.

           When a pure mode change is encountered (which has no index information), the information is read from
           the current index instead.

       -R, --reverse
           Apply the patch in reverse.

       --reject
           For atomicity, <u>git</u> <u>apply</u> by default fails the whole patch and does not touch the working tree when
           some of the hunks do not apply. This option makes it apply the parts of the patch that are
           applicable, and leave the rejected hunks in corresponding *.rej files.

       -z
           When <b>--numstat</b> has been given, do not munge pathnames, but use a NUL-terminated machine-readable
           format.

           Without this option, pathnames with "unusual" characters are quoted as explained for the
           configuration variable <b>core.quotePath</b> (see <b><a href="../man1/git-config.1.html">git-config</a></b>(1)).

       -p&lt;n&gt;
           Remove &lt;n&gt; leading path components (separated by slashes) from traditional diff paths. E.g., with
           <b>-p2</b>, a patch against <b>a/dir/file</b> will be applied directly to <b>file</b>. The default is 1.

       -C&lt;n&gt;
           Ensure at least &lt;n&gt; lines of surrounding context match before and after each change. When fewer lines
           of surrounding context exist they all must match. By default no context is ever ignored.

       --unidiff-zero
           By default, <u>git</u> <u>apply</u> expects that the patch being applied is a unified diff with at least one line
           of context. This provides good safety measures, but breaks down when applying a diff generated with
           <b>--unified=0</b>. To bypass these checks use <b>--unidiff-zero</b>.

           Note, for the reasons stated above, the usage of context-free patches is discouraged.

       --apply
           If you use any of the options marked "Turns off <u>apply</u>" above, <u>git</u> <u>apply</u> reads and outputs the
           requested information without actually applying the patch. Give this flag after those flags to also
           apply the patch.

       --no-add
           When applying a patch, ignore additions made by the patch. This can be used to extract the common
           part between two files by first running <u>diff</u> on them and applying the result with this option, which
           would apply the deletion part but not the addition part.

       --allow-binary-replacement, --binary
           Historically we did not allow binary patch application without an explicit permission from the user,
           and this flag was the way to do so. Currently, we always allow binary patch application, so this is a
           no-op.

       --exclude=&lt;path-pattern&gt;
           Donâ€™t apply changes to files matching the given path pattern. This can be useful when importing
           patchsets, where you want to exclude certain files or directories.

       --include=&lt;path-pattern&gt;
           Apply changes to files matching the given path pattern. This can be useful when importing patchsets,
           where you want to include certain files or directories.

           When <b>--exclude</b> and <b>--include</b> patterns are used, they are examined in the order they appear on the
           command line, and the first match determines if a patch to each path is used. A patch to a path that
           does not match any include/exclude pattern is used by default if there is no include pattern on the
           command line, and ignored if there is any include pattern.

       --ignore-space-change, --ignore-whitespace
           When applying a patch, ignore changes in whitespace in context lines if necessary. Context lines will
           preserve their whitespace, and they will not undergo whitespace fixing regardless of the value of the
           <b>--whitespace</b> option. New lines will still be fixed, though.

       --whitespace=&lt;action&gt;
           When applying a patch, detect a new or modified line that has whitespace errors. What are considered
           whitespace errors is controlled by <b>core.whitespace</b> configuration. By default, trailing whitespaces
           (including lines that solely consist of whitespaces) and a space character that is immediately
           followed by a tab character inside the initial indent of the line are considered whitespace errors.

           By default, the command outputs warning messages but applies the patch. When <b>git-apply</b> is used for
           statistics and not applying a patch, it defaults to <b>nowarn</b>.

           You can use different <u>&lt;action&gt;</u> values to control this behavior:

           â€¢   <b>nowarn</b> turns off the trailing whitespace warning.

           â€¢   <b>warn</b> outputs warnings for a few such errors, but applies the patch as-is (default).

           â€¢   <b>fix</b> outputs warnings for a few such errors, and applies the patch after fixing them (<b>strip</b> is a
               synonym â€” the tool used to consider only trailing whitespace characters as errors, and the fix
               involved <u>stripping</u> them, but modern Gits do more).

           â€¢   <b>error</b> outputs warnings for a few such errors, and refuses to apply the patch.

           â€¢   <b>error-all</b> is similar to <b>error</b> but shows all errors.

       --inaccurate-eof
           Under certain circumstances, some versions of <u>diff</u> do not correctly detect a missing new-line at the
           end of the file. As a result, patches created by such <u>diff</u> programs do not record incomplete lines
           correctly. This option adds support for applying such patches by working around this bug.

       -v, --verbose
           Report progress to stderr. By default, only a message about the current patch being applied will be
           printed. This option will cause additional information to be reported.

       -q, --quiet
           Suppress stderr output. Messages about patch status and progress will not be printed.

       --recount
           Do not trust the line counts in the hunk headers, but infer them by inspecting the patch (e.g. after
           editing the patch without adjusting the hunk headers appropriately).

       --directory=&lt;root&gt;
           Prepend &lt;root&gt; to all filenames. If a "-p" argument was also passed, it is applied before prepending
           the new root.

           For example, a patch that talks about updating <b>a/git-gui.sh</b> to <b>b/git-gui.sh</b> can be applied to the
           file in the working tree <b>modules/git-gui/git-gui.sh</b> by running <b>git</b> <b>apply</b> <b>--directory=modules/git-gui</b>.

       --unsafe-paths
           By default, a patch that affects outside the working area (either a Git controlled working tree, or
           the current working directory when "git apply" is used as a replacement of GNU patch) is rejected as
           a mistake (or a mischief).

           When <b>git</b> <b>apply</b> is used as a "better GNU patch", the user can pass the <b>--unsafe-paths</b> option to
           override this safety check. This option has no effect when <b>--index</b> or <b>--cached</b> is in use.

       --allow-empty
           Donâ€™t return an error for patches containing no diff. This includes empty patches and patches with
           commit text only.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       Everything below this line in this section is selectively included from the <b><a href="../man1/git-config.1.html">git-config</a></b>(1) documentation.
       The content is the same as whatâ€™s found there:

       apply.ignoreWhitespace
           When set to <u>change</u>, tells <u>git</u> <u>apply</u> to ignore changes in whitespace, in the same way as the
           <b>--ignore-space-change</b> option. When set to one of: no, none, never, false, it tells <u>git</u> <u>apply</u> to
           respect all whitespace differences. See <b><a href="../man1/git-apply.1.html">git-apply</a></b>(1).

       apply.whitespace
           Tells <u>git</u> <u>apply</u> how to handle whitespace, in the same way as the <b>--whitespace</b> option. See <b><a href="../man1/gitapply.1.html">git-</a></b>
           <b><a href="../man1/gitapply.1.html">apply</a></b>(1).

</pre><h4><b>SUBMODULES</b></h4><pre>
       If the patch contains any changes to submodules then <u>git</u> <u>apply</u> treats these changes as follows.

       If <b>--index</b> is specified (explicitly or implicitly), then the submodule commits must match the index
       exactly for the patch to apply. If any of the submodules are checked-out, then these check-outs are
       completely ignored, i.e., they are not required to be up to date or clean and they are not updated.

       If <b>--index</b> is not specified, then the submodule commits in the patch are ignored and only the absence or
       presence of the corresponding subdirectory is checked and (if possible) updated.
