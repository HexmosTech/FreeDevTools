</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       git-patch-id - Compute unique ID for a patch

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>git</u> <u>patch-id</u> [--stable | --unstable | --verbatim]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Read a patch from the standard input and compute the patch ID for it.

       A "patch ID" is nothing but a sum of SHA-1 of the file diffs associated with a patch, with line numbers
       ignored. As such, it’s "reasonably stable", but at the same time also reasonably unique, i.e., two
       patches that have the same "patch ID" are almost guaranteed to be the same thing.

       The main usecase for this command is to look for likely duplicate commits.

       When dealing with <u>git</u> <u>diff-tree</u> output, it takes advantage of the fact that the patch is prefixed with
       the object name of the commit, and outputs two 40-byte hexadecimal strings. The first string is the patch
       ID, and the second string is the commit ID. This can be used to make a mapping from patch ID to commit
       ID.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       --verbatim
           Calculate the patch-id of the input as it is given, do not strip any whitespace.

               This is the default if patchid.verbatim is true.

       --stable
           Use a "stable" sum of hashes as the patch ID. With this option:

           •   Reordering file diffs that make up a patch does not affect the ID. In particular, two patches
               produced by comparing the same two trees with two different settings for "-O&lt;orderfile&gt;" result
               in the same patch ID signature, thereby allowing the computed result to be used as a key to index
               some meta-information about the change between the two trees;

           •   Result is different from the value produced by git 1.9 and older or produced when an "unstable"
               hash (see --unstable below) is configured - even when used on a diff output taken without any use
               of "-O&lt;orderfile&gt;", thereby making existing databases storing such "unstable" or historical
               patch-ids unusable.

           •   All whitespace within the patch is ignored and does not affect the id.

                   This is the default if patchid.stable is set to true.

       --unstable
           Use an "unstable" hash as the patch ID. With this option, the result produced is compatible with the
           patch-id value produced by git 1.9 and older and whitespace is ignored. Users with pre-existing
           databases storing patch-ids produced by git 1.9 and older (who do not deal with reordered patches)
           may want to use this option.

               This is the default.
