</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       coq.hb - Command line utility to apply patches generated by HB.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       After building your project with logging enabled, eg

              COQ_ELPI_ATTRIBUTES='hb(log(raw))' make

       each  file.v  file  contanining calls to HB is paired with a file.v.hb patch file which can be applied by
       this utility. You can also use COQ_ELPI_ATTRIBUTES='hb(log)' to  get  terms  printed  in  a  nicer,  more
       compact, way but without all details they may not be parsable without manual editing.

   <b>usage:</b>
       hb patch [-f] &lt;file.v&gt;..
              Applies  the  patches  in &lt;file.v.hb&gt; to &lt;file.v&gt;.  <b>-f</b> forces patch application even if the source
              file is newer than the patch.

       hb reset &lt;file.v&gt;..
              Erases all generated code from source file. It does nothing if the file is not patched. If a patch
              file &lt;file.v.hb&gt; exists it is renamed to &lt;file.v.hb.old&gt;.

       hb show &lt;file.v.hb&gt;..
              Lists all the patches contained in &lt;file.v.hb&gt; (debugging).

       Command line utility to apply patches generated by HB.
