</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       git-mailinfo - Extracts patch and authorship from a single e-mail message

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>git</u> <u>mailinfo</u> [-k|-b] [-u | --encoding=&lt;encoding&gt; | -n]
                      [--[no-]scissors] [--quoted-cr=&lt;action&gt;]
                      &lt;msg&gt; &lt;patch&gt;

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Reads a single e-mail message from the standard input, and writes the commit log message in &lt;msg&gt; file,
       and the patches in &lt;patch&gt; file. The author name, e-mail and e-mail subject are written out to the
       standard output to be used by <u>git</u> <u>am</u> to create a commit. It is usually not necessary to use this command
       directly. See <b><a href="../man1/git-am.1.html">git-am</a></b>(1) instead.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       -k
           Usually the program removes email cruft from the Subject: header line to extract the title line for
           the commit log message. This option prevents this munging, and is most useful when used to read back
           <u>git</u> <u>format-patch</u> <u>-k</u> output.

           Specifically, the following are removed until none of them remain:

           •   Leading and trailing whitespace.

           •   Leading <b>Re:</b>, <b>re:</b>, and <b>:</b>.

           •   Leading bracketed strings (between [ and ], usually [<b>PATCH</b>]).

           Finally, runs of whitespace are normalized to a single ASCII space character.

       -b
           When -k is not in effect, all leading strings bracketed with <u>[</u> and <u>]</u> pairs are stripped. This option
           limits the stripping to only the pairs whose bracketed string contains the word "PATCH".

       -u
           The commit log message, author name and author email are taken from the e-mail, and after minimally
           decoding MIME transfer encoding, re-coded in the charset specified by <b>i18n.commitEncoding</b> (defaulting
           to UTF-8) by transliterating them. This used to be optional but now it is the default.

           Note that the patch is always used as-is without charset conversion, even with this flag.

       --encoding=&lt;encoding&gt;
           Similar to -u. But when re-coding, the charset specified here is used instead of the one specified by
           <b>i18n.commitEncoding</b> or UTF-8.

       -n
           Disable all charset re-coding of the metadata.

       -m, --message-id
           Copy the Message-ID header at the end of the commit message. This is useful in order to associate
           commits with mailing list discussions.

       --scissors
           Remove everything in body before a scissors line (e.g. "-- &gt;8 --"). The line represents scissors and
           perforation marks, and is used to request the reader to cut the message at that line. If that line
           appears in the body of the message before the patch, everything before it (including the scissors
           line itself) is ignored when this option is used.

           This is useful if you want to begin your message in a discussion thread with comments and suggestions
           on the message you are responding to, and to conclude it with a patch submission, separating the
           discussion and the beginning of the proposed commit log message with a scissors line.

           This can be enabled by default with the configuration option mailinfo.scissors.

       --no-scissors
           Ignore scissors lines. Useful for overriding mailinfo.scissors settings.

       --quoted-cr=&lt;action&gt;
           Action when processes email messages sent with base64 or quoted-printable encoding, and the decoded
           lines end with a CRLF instead of a simple LF.

           The valid actions are:

           •   <b>nowarn</b>: Git will do nothing when such a CRLF is found.

           •   <b>warn</b>: Git will issue a warning for each message if such a CRLF is found.

           •   <b>strip</b>: Git will convert those CRLF to LF.

           The default action could be set by configuration option <b>mailinfo.quotedCR</b>. If no such configuration
           option has been set, <b>warn</b> will be used.

       &lt;msg&gt;
           The commit log message extracted from e-mail, usually except the title line which comes from e-mail
           Subject.

       &lt;patch&gt;
           The patch extracted from e-mail.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       Everything below this line in this section is selectively included from the <b><a href="../man1/git-config.1.html">git-config</a></b>(1) documentation.
       The content is the same as what’s found there:

       mailinfo.scissors
           If true, makes <b><a href="../man1/git-mailinfo.1.html">git-mailinfo</a></b>(1) (and therefore <b><a href="../man1/git-am.1.html">git-am</a></b>(1)) act by default as if the --scissors option
           was provided on the command-line. When active, this feature removes everything from the message body
           before a scissors line (i.e. consisting mainly of "&gt;8", "8&lt;" and "-").
