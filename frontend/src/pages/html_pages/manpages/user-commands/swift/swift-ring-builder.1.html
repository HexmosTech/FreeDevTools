</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       <b>swift-ring-builder</b> - OpenStack Swift ring builder

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>swift-ring-builder</b> &lt;builder_file&gt; &lt;commands&gt; &lt;arguments&gt; &lt;...&gt;

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The swift-ring-builder utility is used to create, search and manipulate the swift storage ring. The ring-
       builder assigns partitions to devices and writes an optimized Python structure to a gzipped, pickled file
       on  disk  for  shipping  out to the servers. The server processes just check the modification time of the
       file occasionally and reload their in-memory copies of the ring structure as needed. Because of  how  the
       ring-builder manages changes to the ring, using a slightly older ring usually just means one of the three
       replicas for a subset of the partitions will be incorrect, which can be easily worked around.

       The  ring-builder  also keeps its own builder file with the ring information and additional data required
       to build future rings. It is very important to keep multiple backup copies of these  builder  files.  One
       option is to copy the builder files out to every server while copying the ring files themselves.  Another
       is  to  upload  the  builder  files  into  the  cluster itself. Complete loss of a builder file will mean
       creating a new ring from scratch, nearly all partitions will end up assigned to  different  devices,  and
       therefore nearly all data stored will have to be replicated to new locations. So, recovery from a builder
       file loss is possible, but data will definitely be unreachable for an extended time.

       If invoked as 'swift-ring-builder-safe' the directory containing the builder file provided will be locked
       (via  a  .lock  file  in  the files parent directory).  This provides a basic safe guard against multiple
       instances of the swift-ring-builder (or other utilities that observe this lock) from attempting to  write
       to  or  read  the builder/ring files while operations are in progress. This can be useful in environments
       where ring management has been automated but  the  operator  still  needs  to  interact  with  the  rings
       manually.

</pre><h4><b>SEARCH</b></h4><pre>
       <b>&lt;search-value&gt;</b>
            Can be of the form:
            d&lt;device_id&gt;r&lt;region&gt;z&lt;zone&gt;-&lt;ip&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/&lt;device_name&gt;_&lt;meta&gt;

            Any part is optional, but you must include at least one, examples:

               d74              Matches the device id 74
               z1               Matches devices in zone 1
               z1-1.2.3.4       Matches devices in zone 1 with the ip 1.2.3.4
               1.2.3.4          Matches devices in any zone with the ip 1.2.3.4
               r1z1:5678        Matches devices in zone 1 present in region 1 using port 5678
               z1:5678          Matches devices in zone 1 using port 5678
               :5678            Matches devices that use port 5678
               /sdb1            Matches devices with the device name sdb1
               _shiny           Matches devices with shiny in the meta data
               _'snet: 5.6.7.8' Matches devices with snet: 5.6.7.8 in the meta data
               [::1]            Matches devices in any zone with the ip ::1
               z1-[::1]:5678    Matches devices in zone 1 with ip ::1 and port 5678

            Most specific example:

               d74z1-1.2.3.4:5678/sdb1_"snet: 5.6.7.8"

            Nerd explanation:

               All items require their single character prefix except the ip, in which case the - is optional
               unless the device id or zone is also included.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>-y,</u> <u>--yes</u>
              Assume a yes response to all questions

</pre><h4><b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>&lt;builder_file&gt;</b>
            Shows information about the ring and the devices within.

       <b>search</b>  &lt;search-value&gt;
            Shows information about matching devices.

       <b>add</b> z&lt;zone&gt;-&lt;ip&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/&lt;device_name&gt;_&lt;meta&gt; &lt;weight&gt;
       <b>add</b> r&lt;region&gt;z&lt;zone&gt;-&lt;ip&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/&lt;device_name&gt;_&lt;meta&gt; &lt;weight&gt;
       <b>add</b> -r &lt;region&gt; -z &lt;zone&gt; -i &lt;ip&gt; -p &lt;port&gt; -d &lt;device_name&gt; -m &lt;meta&gt; -w &lt;weight&gt;
            Adds  a  device  to  the  ring with the given information. No partitions will be assigned to the new
            device until after running 'rebalance'. This  is  so  you  can  make  multiple  device  changes  and
            rebalance them all just once.

       <b>create</b> &lt;part_power&gt; &lt;replicas&gt; &lt;min_part_hours&gt;
            Creates &lt;builder_file&gt; with 2^&lt;part_power&gt; partitions and &lt;replicas&gt;.  &lt;min_part_hours&gt; is number of
            hours to restrict moving a partition more than once.

       <b>list_parts</b> &lt;search-value&gt; [&lt;search-value&gt;] ..
            Returns  a  2 column list of all the partitions that are assigned to any of the devices matching the
            search values given. The first column is the assigned partition number and the second column is  the
            number  of  device  matches  for  that partition. The list is ordered from most number of matches to
            least. If there are a lot of devices to match against, this command could take a while to run.

       <b>rebalance</b>
            Attempts to rebalance the ring by reassigning partitions that haven't been recently reassigned.

       <b>remove</b> &lt;search-value&gt;
            Removes the device(s) from the ring. This should normally just be used for a device that has failed.
            For a device you wish to decommission, it's best to set its weight to 0, wait for it  to  drain  all
            its  data,  then use this remove command. This will not take effect until after running 'rebalance'.
            This is so you can make multiple device changes and rebalance them all just once.

       <b>set_info</b> &lt;search-value&gt; &lt;ip&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/&lt;device_name&gt;_&lt;meta&gt;
            Resets the device's information. This information isn't used to assign partitions, so  you  can  use
            'write_ring'  afterward  to  rewrite  the current ring with the newer device information. Any of the
            parts are optional in the final &lt;ip&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/&lt;device_name&gt;_&lt;meta&gt; parameter; just give what you  want
            to  change. For instance set_info d74 _"snet: 5.6.7.8" would just update the meta data for device id
            74.

       <b>set_min_part_hours</b> &lt;hours&gt;
            Changes the &lt;min_part_hours&gt; to the given &lt;hours&gt;. This  should  be  set  to  however  long  a  full
            replication/update  cycle  takes. We're working on a way to determine this more easily than scanning
            logs.

       <b>set_weight</b> &lt;search-value&gt; &lt;weight&gt;
            Resets the device's weight. No partitions will be reassigned to  or  from  the  device  until  after
            running  'rebalance'.  This  is  so you can make multiple device changes and rebalance them all just
            once.

       <b>validate</b>
            Just runs the validation routines on the ring.

       <b>write_ring</b>
            Just rewrites the distributable ring file. This is done automatically after a successful  rebalance,
            so really this is only useful after one or more 'set_info' calls when no rebalance is needed but you
            want to send out the new device information.

       <b>Quick</b> <b>list:</b> add create list_parts rebalance remove search set_info
                   set_min_part_hours set_weight validate write_ring

       <b>Exit</b> <b>codes:</b> 0 = ring changed, 1 = ring did not change, 2 = error
