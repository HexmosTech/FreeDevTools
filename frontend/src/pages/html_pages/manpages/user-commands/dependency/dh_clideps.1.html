       dh_clideps - calculates CLI (.NET) dependencies

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>dh_clideps</b> [<u>debhelper</u> <u>options</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       dh_clideps is a debhelper program that is responsible for generating the ${cli:Depends} substitutions and
       adding them to substvars files.

       The program will look at .dll/.exe and .config files in your package, and will use the embedded
       dependency information to generate a dependency string on assembly and shared libs packages, including
       the setting of version ranges (as declared by the shlibs/clilibs files of the used packages). The
       dependency on a certain CLR (Common Language Runtime) version will be also added to the final variable.

       Note: the dependencies on shared libraries may be not resolved correctly if there are no .config files
       associated with the the .exe/.dll file which refers to the particular shared library (by its SONAME).

       If you use this program, your package should build-depend on cli-common-dev (&gt;= 0.4.0).

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-d</b>  Attempt  to predict and avoid duplicates that may appear if you package both, native shared libraries
           and DLL assemblies in one package.  The list of possibly duplicating candidates is expected to be  in
           the variable shlib:Depends from debian/package.substvars.

       <b>-r</b>  Don't  set  a  strong versioned dependency on mono-runtime or other CLR packages.  This option can be
           used to specify a relaxed dependency on the VM/CLR by-hand in the control file, eg.  "mono-runtime  |
           cli-runtime".

       <b>-l</b>directory[:directory:directory:..]
           Before  mondis  is  run,  MONO_GAC_PREFIX  and  MONO_PATH  are  set  to  the  specified directory (or
           directories -- separate with colons). This is useful for multi-binary packages  where  a  library  is
           built  in  one  package  and  another package contains binaries linked against said library. Relative
           paths will be made absolute for the benefit of ikdasm.

           Note that the directory given should be the complete or relative path to a  directory  that  contains
           the library. See example below.

       <b>-X</b>path <b>--exclude=</b>path
           Paths  to  exclude from the .dll/.exe search.  Assemblies in these paths or their subdirectories will
           not be searched for dependencies, and assemblies missing references  will  not  cause  dh_clideps  to
           fail.

       <b>--exclude-moduleref=</b>moduleref
           ModuleRef to exclude from dependency resolution.  dh_clideps will not attempt to resolve dependencies
           of these ModuleRefs.  In particular, dh_clideps will not fail if these modulerefs are unresolvable.

           May be specified multiple times.  Each time it excludes a new ModuleRef.

           ModuleRefs to be excluded can be optionally prefixed with "i:" to specify a case-insensitive match.

           If foo is excluded, both foo and foo.dll will be considered when matching the exclude.

       <b>internal-mono</b>
           Uses the mono runtime in . (used for bootstrapping mono packages)

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Suppose that your source package produces libfoo1.0-cil and libbar1.0-cil binary packages.  In your rules
       file, first run dh_makeclilibs, then dh_clideps:
         (MONO_GAC_PREFIX example)
         dh_makeclilibs -V
         dh_clideps -l debian/libfoo1.0-cil/usr:debian/libbar1.0-cil/usr or
         (MONO_PATH example)
         dh_clideps -l debian/foo-application/usr/lib/foo-application or
         (MONO_GAC_PREFIX example)
         dh_clideps -l debian/tmp/usr

       Suppose  your source package libquux1.0-cil also ships some examples in <a href="file:/usr/share">/usr/share</a>, and you don't want to
       pull in those dependencies.
         dh_clideps -X/usr/share

       Suppose your source package has a ModuleRef on libbaz but works correctly  without  it.   Excluding  this
       ModuleRef will prevent dh_clideps from adding a package dependency or failing if the libbaz dependency is
       unresolvable.
         dh_clideps --exclude-moduleref=libbaz
