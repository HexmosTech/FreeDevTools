</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       shards - dependency manager for the Crystal Language

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>shards</b> [<u>&lt;general_options&gt;</u>...] [<u>&lt;command&gt;</u>] [<u>&lt;command_options&gt;</u>...]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Manages dependencies for Crystal projects and libraries with reproducible installs across computers and
       systems.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       <u>shards</u> requires the presence of a <u>shard.yml</u> file in the project folder (working directory). This file
       describes the project and lists dependencies that are required to build it. See <b><a href="../man5/shard.yml.5.html">shard.yml</a></b>(5) for more
       information on its format. A default file can be created by running <u>shards</u> <u>init</u>.

       Running <u>shards</u> <u>install</u> resolves and installs the specified dependencies. The installed versions are
       written into a <b>shard.lock</b> file for using the exact same dependency versions when running <u>shards</u> <u>install</u>
       again.

       If your shard builds an application, both <b>shard.yml</b> and <b>shard.lock</b> should be checked into version control
       to provide reproducible dependency installs. If it is only a library for other shards to depend on,
       <b>shard.lock</b> should <u>not</u> be checked in, only <b>shard.yml</b>. It’s good advice to add it to <b>.gitignore</b>.

</pre><h4><b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       If no <u>command</u> is given, <b>install</b> command will be run by default.

       To see the available options for a particular command, use <u>--help</u> after the command.

       <b>build</b> [<u>&lt;targets&gt;</u>] [<u>&lt;build_options&gt;</u>...]
           Builds the specified <u>&lt;targets&gt;</u> in <b>bin</b> path. If no targets are specified, all are built. This command
           ensures all dependencies are installed, so it is not necessary to run <b>shards</b> <b>install</b> before.

           All <u>&lt;build_options&gt;</u> following the command are delegated to <b>crystal</b> <b>build</b>.

       <b>check</b>
           Verifies that all dependencies are installed and requirements are satisfied.

           Exit status:

           <b>0</b>
               Dependencies are satisfied.

           <b>1</b>
               Dependencies are not satisfied.

       <b>init</b>
           Initializes a default <u>shard.yml</u> in the current folder.

       <b>install</b> [--frozen] [--without-development] [--production] [--skip-postinstall] [--skip-executables]
       [--jobs=N]
           Resolves and installs dependencies into the <u>lib</u> folder. If not already present, generates a
           <u>shard.lock</u> file from resolved dependencies, locking version numbers or Git commits.

           Reads and enforces locked versions and commits if a <u>shard.lock</u> file is present. The <b>install</b> command
           may fail if a locked version doesn’t match a requirement, but may succeed if a new dependency was
           added, as long as it doesn’t generate a conflict, thus generating a new <u>shard.lock</u> file.

           --frozen
               Strictly installs locked versions from <u>shard.lock</u>. Fails if <u>shard.lock</u> is missing.

           --without-development
               Does not install development dependencies.

           --production
               same as <u>--frozen</u> and <u>--without-development</u>

           --skip-postinstall
               Does not run postinstall of dependencies.

           --skip-executables
               Does not install executables.

           --jobs
               Number of repository downloads to perform in parallel (default: 8). Currently only for git.

       <b>list</b> [--tree]
           Lists the installed dependencies and their versions.

           Specifying <u>--tree</u> arranges nested dependencies in a tree, instead of a flattened list.

       <b>lock</b> [--update [&lt;shards&gt;...]]
           Resolves dependencies and creates or updates the <u>shard.lock</u> file as per the <b>install</b> command, but
           never installs the dependencies.

           Specifying <u>--update</u> follows the same semantics as the <b>update</b> command.

       <b>outdated</b> [--pre]
           Lists dependencies that are outdated.

           When <u>--pre</u> is specified, pre-release versions are also considered.

       <b>prune</b>
           Removes unused dependencies from <u>lib</u> folder.

       <b>update</b> [&lt;shards&gt;...]
           Resolves and updates all dependencies into the <u>lib</u> folder, whatever the locked versions in the
           <u>shard.lock</u> file. Eventually generates a new <u>shard.lock</u> file.

           Specifying <u>shards</u> will update these dependencies only, trying to be as conservative as possible with
           other dependencies, respecting the locked versions in the <u>shard.lock</u> file.

       <b>version</b> [<u>&lt;path&gt;</u>]
           Prints the current version of the shard located at <u>path</u> (defaults to current directory).

       To see the available options for a particular command, use <b>--help</b> after a command.

</pre><h4><b>GENERAL</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       --version
           Prints the version of <u>shards</u>.

       -h, --help
           Prints usage synopsis.

       --no-color
           Disables colored output.

       --local
           Do not update remote repository cache. Instead, Shards will use the local copies already present in
           the cache (see <b>SHARDS_CACHE_PATH</b>). The command will fail if a dependency is unavailable in the cache.

       -q, --quiet
           Decreases the log verbosity, printing only warnings and errors.

       -v, --verbose
           Increases the log verbosity, printing all debug statements.

</pre><h4><b>INSTALLATION</b></h4><pre>
       Shards is usually distributed with Crystal itself. Alternatively, a separate <u>shards</u> package may be
       available for your system.

       To install from source, download or clone the repository &lt;https://github.com/crystal-lang/shards&gt; and run
       <b>make</b> <b>CRFLAGS=--release</b>. The compiled binary is in <u>bin/shards</u> and should be added to <b>PATH</b>.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       SHARDS_OPTS
           Allows general options to be passed in as environment variable. <b>Example</b>: <u>SHARDS_OPTS="--no-color"</u>
           <u>shards</u> <u>update</u>

       SHARDS_CACHE_PATH
           Defines the cache location. In this folder, shards stores local copies of remote repositories.
           Defaults to <u>.cache/shards</u> in the home directory (<u>$XDG_CACHE_HOME</u> or <u>$HOME</u>) or the current directory.

       SHARDS_INSTALL_PATH
           Defines the location where dependencies are installed. Defaults to <u>lib</u>.

       SHARDS_BIN_PATH
           Defines the location where executables are installed. Defaults to <u>bin</u>.

       CRYSTAL_VERSION
           Defines the crystal version that dependencies should be resolved against. Defaults to the output of
           <u>crystal</u> <u>env</u> <u>CRYSTAL_VERSION</u>.

       SHARDS_OVERRIDE
           Defines an alternate location of <u>shard.override.yml</u>.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       shard.yml
           Describes a shard project including its dependencies. See <b><a href="../man5/shard.yml.5.html">shard.yml</a></b>(5) for documentation.

       shard.override.yml
           Allows overriding the source and restriction of dependencies. An alternative location can be
           configured with the env var <b>SHARDS_OVERRIDE</b>.

           The file contains a YAML document with a single <b>dependencies</b> key. It has the same semantics as in
           <b>shard.yml</b>. Dependency configuration takes precedence over the configuration in <b>shard.yml</b> or any
           dependency’s <b>shard.yml</b>.

           Use cases are local working copies, forcing a specific dependency version despite mismatching
           constraints, fixing a dependency, checking compatibility with unreleased dependency versions.

       shard.lock
           Lockfile that stores information about the installed versions.

           If your shard builds an application, <b>shard.lock</b> should be checked into version control to provide
           reproducible dependency installs.

           If it is only a library for other shards to depend on, <b>shard.lock</b> should <u>not</u> be checked in, only
           <b>shard.yml</b>. It’s good advice to add it to <b>.gitignore</b>.
