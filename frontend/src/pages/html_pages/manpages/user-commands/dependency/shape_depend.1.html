</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       shape_depend - shapeTools RMS determine source-include dependencies

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>shape</b> <b>depend</b> <b>[VERSIONS=&lt;selection_rule&gt;]</b> <b>[variants]</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  shape release management system requires for each node system a file named <u>Dependencies</u>, listing the
       source-derived  dependencies  of  the  node  components.  <u>shape</u>  <u>depend</u>  automatically  determines  these
       dependencies  and  creates  an  appropriate  Dependencies file. The dependencies have the form of regular
       Makefile target-dependents lines without associated build action.

           <b>Note:</b> shape depend only works for development of  C  programs.   It  additionally  requires  a  C
           compiler  supporting  the <u>-M</u> (generate Makefile dependencies) option.  If this is not the case in
           your development project, you must either rewrite the action associated with  the  depend  target
           (in $(SHAPELIBPATH)/stdtargets) or maintain the Dependencies files manually.

       The  <u>VERSIONS</u>  macro  defines  the  version  selection  rule  to  be  used.  Default  is <u>most_recent</u>. See
       <a href="../man7/shape_stdrul.7.html">shape_stdrul</a>(7) or the $(SHAPELIBPATH)/stdrules file for other possible settings. You may also  use  self
       defined version selection rules as VERSIONS rule.

       If  your  development  environment  contains  variant definitions, in especially variant definitions that
       modify the list of source components to be used during a build operation, you may also  need  to  specify
       one  or  more  <u>variants</u>  to be set. The project wide variant raster is defined in $(SHAPELIBPATH)/stdvar.
       Check this file and the default variant settings in your Shapefile before invoking shape depend.

</pre><h4><b>INCONVENIENCES</b></h4><pre>
       Regeneration of the Dependencies file due to structural changes of the node system has  to  be  triggered
       manually. Shape RMS doesn't recognize such changes.

       Variant  specific  Dependencies  files  (necessary  when simultaneousky developing structurally different
       variants) are not supported. In this case you have to run shape depend prior to each build action.
