       germinate — expand dependencies in a list of seed packages

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>germinate</b>   [<b>-v</b>]  [<b>-S</b>  <u>source</u>]  [<b>-s</b>  <u>dist</u>]  [<b>-m</b>  <u>mirror</u>]  [<b>-d</b>  <u>dist</u>,...]  [<b>-a</b>  <u>arch</u>]  [<b>-c</b>  <u>component</u>,...]
                 [<b>--vcs</b>={<b>auto</b>|<b>bzr</b>|<b>git</b>}] [<b>--no-rdepends</b>] [<b>--no-installer</b>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>germinate</b> is a program to help with the maintenance of large software distributions.  It takes a list  of
       seed  packages  and  a  mirror of the distribution, and produces outputs with the seed packages and their
       dependencies and build-dependencies expanded out in full.

   <b>Seeds</b>
       The contents of the Ubuntu distribution, and others, are managed by means of <u>seeds</u>.  At  their  simplest,
       these  are  lists  of  packages  which  are  considered  important  to  have in the main component of the
       distribution, without explicitly listing all their dependencies and build-dependencies.

       Seed lists are typically divided up by category: a <b>base</b> or <b>minimal</b>  seed  might  list  the  core  set  of
       packages  required  to  make  the  system run at all, while a <b>desktop</b> seed might list the set of packages
       installed as part of a default desktop installation.  <b>germinate</b> takes these seeds, adds their  dependency
       trees,  and  produces an <u>output</u> for each seed which contains a dependency-expanded list of package names.
       These outputs may be handed on to archive maintenance or CD-building tools.

       Some seeds may <u>inherit</u> from other seeds: they rely on those  seeds  to  be  installed.   For  example,  a
       <b>desktop</b>  seed  will  typically  inherit  from  a  <b>minimal</b>  seed.  <b>germinate</b> understands these inheritance
       relationships.  If a package in the <b>desktop</b> seed depends on ‘foo’, but  ‘foo’  is  already  part  of  the
       <b>minimal</b> seed or dependency list, then ‘foo’ will not be added to the <b>desktop</b> output.

       Seeds  are  stored in text files downloaded from a given URL.  Lines not beginning with ‘ * ’ (wiki-style
       list markup) are ignored.

       Seed entries may simply consist of a package name, or may include any of the following special syntax:

       %       Seed entries beginning with ‘%’ expand to all binaries from the given source package.

       ...|...
               Seed entries may list alternatives to the seeded package to allow metapackages to list them,  and
               users to use those alternatives without having to remove the metapackages.

       [...]   Seed  entries may be followed with ‘ [<u>arch1</u> <u>arch2</u> <u>...</u>]’ to indicate that they should only be used
               on the given architectures, or with ‘ [!<u>arch1</u> !<u>arch2</u> <u>...</u>]’ to indicate that they  should  not  be
               used on the given architectures.

       (...)   Seed  entries  in  parentheses  indicate  that  the seed should be treated as a recommendation of
               metapackages generated from this seed, rather than as a dependency.

       !       Seed entries beginning with ‘!’ cause the given package to be blacklisted from the given seed and
               any seeds from which it inherits; this may be followed by ‘%’ as above to blacklist all  binaries
               from  the  given  source  package.   Note  that  this  may result in uninstallable packages whose
               dependencies have been blacklisted, so use this feature sparingly.  The purpose of a blacklist is
               to make it obvious when a package that is not supposed to be installed  ends  up  in  <b>germinate</b>'s
               output,  so  that  package relationships can be fixed to stop that happening.  It is not intended
               for the purpose of working around buggy package relationships, and attempts to  do  so  will  not
               work because <b>apt</b> has no way to know about blacklist entries in seeds.

       snap:name
               Seed  entries beginning with ‘snap:’ are <u>snap</u> packages.  These are different from <u>deb</u> packages in
               that they do not have (build-)dependencies, cannot be recommended, and  do  not  end  up  in  any
               resulting metapackages.  (If you try to recommend a snap package, it will be ignored completely.)
               Snaps  specified  in seeds will be output in a <u>.snaps</u> file named after the corresponding seed, as
               software processing the output of <b>germinate</b> will typically need to treat snaps  differently  from
               debs.  <b>germinate</b> will not check remotely to see if a given snap is available, therefore seeds are
               expected  to  explicitly  list  all architectures a snap is to be seeded on.  ‘snap:’ entries can
               also be suffixed with "/classic" to indicate that the snaps need to  be  installed  with  classic
               confinement on end-user systems.

       key: value
               Some  seeds  also  contain  headers at the top of the file, in “key: value” format.  For the most
               part, these are not parsed by <b>germinate</b> itself.  The Ubuntu <b>tasksel</b> package uses  keys  beginning
               with    ‘Task-’    to    define    fields    of    similar    names    in    its   <u>.desc</u>   files.
               <u><a href="../man1/germinate-update-metapackage.1.html">germinate-update-metapackage</a></u>(1) uses some of  these  headers  to  reduce  the  need  for  fragile
               configuration; see its documentation for further details.

       A  <u>STRUCTURE</u>  file  alongside the seeds lists their inheritance relationships.  It may also include lines
       beginning with ‘include’, causing other collections of seeds to be included as if they were part  of  the
       collection  currently  being  germinated,  or  lines  beginning  with  ‘feature’, which set flags for the
       processing of seeds.  Features  may  also  be  set  on  a  per-seed  basis  using  lines  beginning  with
       ‘ * Feature:’ in the seed file.

       The following flags are currently defined:

       follow-build-depends
               Follow  Build-Depends  fields.   This  flag  is  only recognised in individual seed files, not in
               <u>STRUCTURE</u>.

       follow-build-depends-all
               Follow  Build-Depends  fields  for  Architecture:  all  packages.   This   has   no   effect   if
               <b>no-follow-build-depends</b> is set.

       follow-recommends
               Treat Recommends fields as if they were Depends.

       no-follow-build-depends
               Do not follow Build-Depends fields.

       no-follow-build-depends-all
               Do  not follow Build-Depends fields for Architecture: all packages, even though Build-Depends are
               followed for other packages.

       no-follow-recommends
               Do not treat Recommends fields as if  they  were  Depends.   This  flag  is  only  recognised  in
               individual seed files, not in <u>STRUCTURE</u>.

   <b>Build-dependencies</b> <b>and</b> ‘supported’
       There  is  typically  no  need  for  a  default  desktop  installation  to  contain all the compilers and
       development libraries needed to build itself from source; if nothing else, it  would  consume  much  more
       space.   Nevertheless,  it is normally a requirement for the maintainers of a distribution to support all
       the packages necessary to build that distribution.

       <b>germinate</b> therefore does not add all the packages that result from following build-dependencies  of  seed
       packages and of their dependencies (the “build-dependency tree”) to every output, unless they are also in
       the  seed  or  in  the  dependency  list.   Instead,  it adds them to the output for the last seed in the
       <u>STRUCTURE</u> file, conventionally called <b>supported</b>.

       Like any other seed, the supported seed may contain its own list of packages.  It is  common  to  provide
       support  for  many  software  packages  which  are  not  in  the  default installation, such as debugging
       libraries, optimised kernels, alternative language support, and the like.

   <b>Outputs</b>
       The output files are named after the seed to which they correspond.  An additional output file is  needed
       for  supported, namely ‘supported+build-depends’, which contains the supported list and the build-depends
       lists of the other seeds all joined together.  An ‘all’  output  is  produced  to  represent  the  entire
       archive.

       Some  other  files  are  produced for occasional use by experts.  See the <u>README</u> file for full details on
       these.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b>
             Be more verbose when processing seeds.

       <b>-S</b>, <b>--seed-source</b> <u>source</u>,...
             Fetch      seeds      from      the      specified       sources.        The       default       is
             <u>https://ubuntu-archive-team.ubuntu.com/seeds/</u>,                                                   or
             <u><a href="http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-core-dev/ubuntu-seeds/">http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-core-dev/ubuntu-seeds/</a></u> if the  <b>--vcs</b>=bzr  option  is  used,  or
             <u>git://git.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-core-dev/ubuntu-seeds/+git/</u>  if  the <b>--vcs</b>=git option is used.  You
             may use <u>file://</u> URLs here to fetch seeds from the local file system; for example, if your seeds are
             stored   in   <u>/home/username/seeds/debian.unstable</u>,   then   you   would   use   the   options   <b>-S</b>
             <u>file:///home/username/seeds/</u> <b>-s</b> <u>debian.unstable</u>.

       <b>-s</b>, <b>--seed-dist</b> <u>dist</u>
             Fetch seeds for distribution <u>dist</u>.  The default is <b>ubuntu.mantic</b>.

             When fetching seeds from git, the part after the rightmost ‘.’ character, if any, is treated as the
             branch name to check out; this rather strange style is for backward compatibility.

       <b>-m</b>, <b>--mirror</b> <u>mirror</u>
             Get  package lists from <u>mirror</u>.  The default is <u><a href="http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/">http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/</a></u>.  May be supplied
             multiple times; the newest version of each package across all archives will win.

       <b>--source-mirror</b> <u>mirror</u>
             Get source package lists from <u>mirror</u>.  The default  is  to  use  package  lists  mirrors.   May  be
             supplied multiple times; the newest version of each source package across all archives will win.

       <b>-d</b>, <b>--dist</b> <u>dist</u>,...
             Operate on the specified distributions.  The default is <b>mantic</b>.  Listing multiple distributions may
             be useful, for example, when examining both a released distribution and its security updates.

       <b>-a</b>, <b>--arch</b> <u>arch</u>
             Operate on architecture <u>arch</u>.  The default is <b>amd64</b>.

       <b>-c</b>, <b>--components</b> <u>component</u>,...
             Operate on the specified components.  The default is <b>main</b>.

       <b>-C</b>, <b>--apt-config</b> <u>conf</u>
             Use apt with APT_CONFIG set to the supplied value to find the package and source indices to operate
             on. Overrides any values passed for <b>--mirror</b>, <b>--source-mirror</b>, <b>--dist</b>, <b>-or</b> <b>--components</b>.

       <b>--vcs</b>={<b>auto</b>|<b>bzr</b>|<b>git</b>}
             Check  out  seeds  from  a  version  control  system rather than fetching them directly from a URL.
             Requires <b>bzr</b> or <b>git</b>,  as  appropriate,  to  be  installed.   For  <b>bzr</b>,  use  the  branch  found  at
             <u>seed-source</u>/<u>seed-dist</u>;  for <b>git</b>, remove the part after the rightmost ‘.’ character of <u>seed-dist</u> and
             use it as the branch name to check out from <u>seed-source</u>/<u>remainder-of-seed-dist</u>.   For  <b>auto</b>,  guess
             the  version  control  system  to  use  from  <u>seed-source</u> (trying both in ambiguous cases) and then
             proceed as above.

       <b>--bzr</b>
             Check out seeds from the <b>bzr</b> branch  found  at  <u>seed-source</u>/<u>seed-dist</u>  rather  than  fetching  them
             directly  from a URL.  Requires <b>bzr</b> to be installed.  This option is deprecated and is retained for
             backward compatibility; use <b>--vcs</b>=bzr instead.

       <b>--no-rdepends</b>
             Disable reverse-dependency calculations.  These calculations cause a large number of small files to
             be written out in the <u>rdepends/</u> directory, and may take some time.

       <b>--no-installer</b>
             Do not consider debian-installer udeb packages.  While generally not the desired outcome, sometimes
             you might wish to omit consideration of installer packages when processing your seeds,  perhaps  if
             sending the output directly to the package manager on an already-installed system.

       <b>--seed-packages</b> <u>parent</u>/<u>pkg</u>,...
             Treat  each <u>pkg</u> as a seed by itself, inheriting from <u>parent</u> (i.e. assuming that all packages in the
             <u>parent</u> seed are already installed while calculating the  additional  dependencies  of  <u>pkg</u>).   This
             allows  the  use  of  <b>germinate</b>  to  calculate  the dependencies of individual extra packages.  For
             example, <b>--seed-packages</b> <u>desktop</u>/<u>epiphany-browser</u>  will  create  an  <u>epiphany-browser</u>  output  file
             listing  the additional packages that need to be installed over and above the <u>desktop</u> seed in order
             to install <u>epiphany-browser</u>.

       <b>--always-follow-build-depends</b>
             Always follow Build-Depends in all seeds, regardless of seed feature flags.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       The wiki-style markup in seeds was inherited from an early implementation, and is a wart.

       <b>germinate</b> can sometimes be confused by complicated situations involving the order in which it  encounters
       dependencies on virtual packages.  Explicit entries in seeds may be required to work around this.

       Handling  of  installer packages (udebs) is complicated, poorly documented, and doesn't always work quite
       right: in particular, packages aren't demoted to the supported seed when they should be.
