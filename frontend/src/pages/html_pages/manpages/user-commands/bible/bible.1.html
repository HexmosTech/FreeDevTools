</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       bible - Lookup words and verses in the Bible (King James version)

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>bible</b> [<b>-f</b>] [<b>-l</b> <u>columns</u>] [<b>-m</b> <u>memlimit</u>] [<b>-p</b> <u>path-list</u>] [<b>-d</b> <u>datafile-name</u>] [<u>verse-reference(s)</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Bible</u>  writes the text of specified Bible verses to stdout.  The text used is the Authorized (King James)
       version.  Commands may be given either on the  command  line,  or  interactively.   <u>Bible</u>  also  supports
       instant  searches  for  verses containing a particular word, or combination of words.  The program uses a
       specially-compressed form of the text that allows for rapid random access, while  still  compressing  the
       original  4.4  Mbyte  text  into  less  than 1.8 Mbytes (plus the "concordance" data file, which requires
       nearly 900 Kbytes).

   <b>Options</b>
       The options to <u>bible</u> are:

       <b>-f</b>             Toggles special output formatting (pretty-printing).  By default, pretty-printing is <b>on</b> (a
                      change from earlier versions).  When pretty-printing is <b>off</b>,  <u>bible</u>  precedes  each  verse
                      with  its  book/chapter/verse  reference.   When  pretty-printing is <b>on</b>, the book name and
                      chapter are printed on a line by themselves, and only when the chapter  or  book  changes.
                      The  start  of  each  verse  is  indented  and preceded by the verse number.  The book and
                      chapter names are separated from the text by blank lines to facilitate post-processing  by
                      other tools such as <u>adjust</u>.  Pretty-printing activates automatic line breaks ( <b>-l</b>)

       <b>-l</b> <u>columns</u>     When  pretty-printing is <b>off</b>, <u>bible</u> prints one verse per line, even though the text may be
                      much longer than will fit on a single line of a display.  This  is  very  handy  when  the
                      output  will be processed by other programs, but it doesn't look very nice.  The <b>-l</b> option
                      sets a limit on the length of an output line, causing <u>bible</u> to break lines  (only  between
                      words)  to  fit.  The <u>columns</u> argument is optional; if it is not specified, <u>bible</u> will use
                      the value of the COLUMNS environment variable minus one.  If COLUMNS is not set a  default
                      value of 79 is used.

       <b>-m</b> <u>memlimit</u>    <u>Bible</u>  normally allocates up to 1 megabyte for buffers to store uncompressed text.  If the
                      <b>-m</b> option is present, <u>bible</u> will set the limit to <u>memlimit</u> kilobytes.

       <b>-p</b> <u>path-list</u>   <u>Bible</u> normally searches for the text data file first in the current directory, and then in
                      <b><a href="file:/usr/lib">/usr/lib</a></b>.  The <b>-p</b> option may be used to change the search path.   <u>Path-list</u>  should  be  a
                      list of directories, each separated by a space (be sure to escape them from the shell).

       <b>-d</b> <u>filename</u>    <u>Bible</u>  normally  expects  to  find  the  text  data  in  a  file named <b>bible.data</b>, and the
                      concordance data in <b>bible.data.conc</b>.  If the <b>-d</b> option is present, <u>bible</u> will look  for  a
                      text data file named <u>filename</u>, and a concordance data file named <u>filename.conc</u> instead.

   <b>Verse</b> <b>References</b>
       <u>Bible</u>  accepts  verse  references  in  a variety of forms, including single verses and verse ranges.  For
       example:

           Jn3:16, john3:16,17 ps1:1-6

       Most recognizable abbreviations are allowed, and spelling errors are ignored if the book can be made  out
       in  the  first few characters.  No distinction is made between upper and lower case.  Multiple references
       may be provided on an input line, delimited by spaces or commas.

       Verse and chapter will be silently coerced into a realistic range, e.g.   "Ps1:87"  will  be  treated  as
       Psalm  1:6 since there are only six verses in Psalm 1, and "Rev99:99" will be treated as Revelation 22:21
       (the last verse in the Bible).  A book name by itself is assumed to be a reference to chapter 1, verse  1
       of  that  book,  i.e.  "Acts" is the same as "Acts1:1".  Similarly, a book and chapter without a verse is
       assumed to refer to verse one of that chapter.

       A range of verses may be printed by giving a starting and ending reference, separated by a hyphen  ("-").
       For example, "Gen1:1-Rev22:21" will dump the entire text (about 4.4 MB).

       <u>Bible</u>  keeps track of your current context and will attempt to interpret references in that context.  For
       example if you request "John1:1", followed by "3:16", and then "17", the second reference is  assumed  to
       be  within  the  book  of  John,  and the third is assumed to be within chapter 3 of that book.  An empty
       reference, e.g. a blank line on the input, will show the next verse following the last one displayed.

       More examples of legal verse references:

           psalms1

           Psalms

           Romans3:23 5:8 6:23

           1

           5:1

           1-22

   <b>Concordance</b> <b>(Word</b> <b>Searches)</b>
       <u>Bible</u> includes a concordance, with which you can immediately find all the verses in which a word appears.
       The <b>??</b><u>word</u> command will select all the references that include <u>word</u>.  <u>Bible</u> will display  the  number  of
       matching  references,  if  any,  but  since  the  number could be quite large, it won't actually list the
       references until you ask.

       In order to list the references from a word search, the <b>?list</b> (or <b>?l</b>)  command  is  used.   Likewise,  to
       print the full text of the verses selected by a word search, use the <b>?view</b> (or <b>?v</b>) command.

       The  lists  for multiple words may be combined using the <b>?and</b> <u>word</u> and <b>?or</b> <u>word</u> commands.  First create a
       reference list using the <b>??</b>  command.  For example,

           ??faith

       will find 231 references to the word "faith".  To narrow the list further, the command

           ?and love

       will inform you that, while there were 281 references to "love",  only  16  of  them  were  also  in  the
       previous  reference  list  (i.e. contained both words).  The "combined list" of 16 references produced by
       the <b>?and</b> <u>word</u> command is the intersection of the two lists, and replaces the original reference list.

       The <b>?list</b> and <b>?view</b> commands will now apply to the combined list.  You can continue  to  apply  the  <b>?and</b>
       command to the combined list.  For example,

           ?and hope

       will further narrow the combined list to only two references.  Typing <b>?view</b> then displays the full text:

           1 Thessalonians 1

             3 Remembering without ceasing your work of faith, and labour of
           love, and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, in the
           sight of God and our Father;

           1 Thessalonians 5

             8 But let us, who are of the day, be sober, putting on the
           breastplate of faith and love; and for an helmet, the hope of salvation.

       The  <b>?or</b>  <u>word</u> command is similar to <b>?and</b>, but it produces a combined reference list that is the union of
       the two lists.  In other words, the list includes those verses in which either of the words appears.  For
       example

           ??angels
           ?or angel

       will find all 283 verses in wich either word is used.

       By default, reference lists cover the entire Bible.  But for those times when it is useful to limit  them
       to a particular section of the text, <b>bible</b> provides the <b>?in</b> <u>verse</u> <u>range</u> command.  For example

           ?in mt1:1-rev22:21

       will limit future reference lists to the New Testament.  If you have a current reference list, references
       that  fall  outside the limits will be dropped.  Note that only a contiguous range of verses may be used.
       To reset the limits so that the whole text is searched, the command is <b>?in</b> <b>all</b>.

   <b>Interactive</b> <b>Use</b>
       For interactive use, invoke <u>bible</u> without any verse references on the command line.   You  should  see  a
       prompt displayed:

           Bible(KJV) [Gen1:1]&gt;

       Typing <b>?</b>  will print a command summary.

       The program accepts three types of interactive command input:

              •  Bible verse references, as described above.
              •  Concordance  (word  search)  commands,  also  described  above.  These commands are: <b>??</b>, <b>?list</b>,
                 <b>?view</b>, <b>?and</b>, <b>?or</b>, and <b>?in</b>.
              •  Miscellaneous program control commands:

              <b>?,</b> <b>?h,</b> <b>?help</b>   Prints help text.
              <b>?f</b>             Toggles output formatting modes.
              <b>?w</b><u>file</u>         Begin writing program output to a file.  If file  exists,  output  is  appended  to
                             what's there already.
              <b>?w</b>             Stop writing to a file.
              <b>&gt;,</b> <b>&lt;</b>           Toggle  the  <u>direction</u>  (forward  or backward) in which <u>bible</u> will move through the
                             text when a blank line is entered.
              <b>q,</b> <b>?bye,</b> <b>?exit,</b> <b>?quit,</b> <b>?q</b>
                             End the program.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       References to the one-chapter books of Philemon and 3 John are non-standard in that they require a  dummy
       chapter number.  For example, use Phm1:5 instead of Phm5 to get verse 5.

       The  possessive form <b>'s</b> is handled strangely by the Concordance.  The apostrophe has been removed and the
       <b>s</b> has been treated as if it were a separate word.  So, for example, if you wanted to find all  references
       to  "refiner's"  you  would  have  to  first  search for "refiner" (using the command <b>??</b><u>refiner)</u> and then
       combine it with a search for "s" (<b>?and</b> <u>s</u>).

       The convention for handling partial verse specifications can be clumsy.  A  book  name  by  itself,  e.g.
       "Matthew"  is  taken as a reference to verse 1:1 of that book.  So <b>?in</b> <u>matt</u> results in a range limit of a
       single verse (Mt1:1) instead of the whole book as one might hope.  Similarly, <b>?in</b>  <u>mt-rev</u>  results  in  a
       range of Matthew 1:1 to Revelation 1:1, instead of extending all the way to Revelation 22:21.

       The  current version uses Lempel-Ziv-Welch compression on the data file, though I modified the "compress"
       program to emit checkpoints at known intervals to facilitate random access to  the  data.   I  call  this
       simple technique "windowed compression", and it could be used for any similar application.  The data file
       can still be uncompressed using the standard "compress" utility if my file header is removed.

       I  would  like to gratefully acknowledge the contribution of the authors of the <u>compress</u> program, which I
       modified for use in the text storage component of <u>bible</u>.  As listed in the  <u>compress</u>  sources  they  are:
       Spencer W. Thomas, Jim McKie, Steve Davies, Ken Turkowski, James A. Woods, Joe Orost.
