       dig - DNS lookup utility

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>dig</b>  [@server]  [<b>-b</b>  address]  [<b>-c</b> class] [<b>-f</b> filename] [<b>-k</b> filename] [<b>-m</b>] [<b>-p</b> port#] [<b>-q</b> name] [<b>-t</b> type]
       [<b>-v</b>] [<b>-x</b> addr] [<b>-y</b> [hmac:]name:key] [ [<b>-4</b>] | [<b>-6</b>] ] [name] [type] [class] [queryopt...]

       <b>dig</b> [<b>-h</b>]

       <b>dig</b> [global-queryopt...] [query...]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>dig</b> is a flexible tool for interrogating DNS name servers. It  performs  DNS  lookups  and  displays  the
       answers  that  are returned from the name server(s) that were queried. Most DNS administrators use <b>dig</b> to
       troubleshoot DNS problems because of its flexibility, ease of use, and clarity of  output.  Other  lookup
       tools tend to have less functionality than <b>dig</b>.

       Although  <b>dig</b>  is  normally  used  with command-line arguments, it also has a batch mode of operation for
       reading lookup requests from a file. A brief summary of its command-line arguments and options is printed
       when the <u>-h</u> option is given. The BIND 9 implementation of <b>dig</b> allows multiple lookups to be  issued  from
       the command line.

       Unless  it  is  told  to  query  a  specific  name  server,  <b>dig</b>  tries  each  of  the  servers listed in
       <b><a href="file:/etc/resolv.conf">/etc/resolv.conf</a></b>. If no usable server addresses are found, <b>dig</b> sends the query to the local host.

       When no command-line arguments or options are given, <b>dig</b> performs an NS query for "." (the root).

       It is possible to set per-user defaults for <b>dig</b> via <b>${HOME}/.digrc</b>. This file is read and any options  in
       it  are  applied before the command-line arguments. The <u>-r</u> option disables this feature, for scripts that
       need predictable behavior.

       The IN and CH class names overlap with the IN and CH top-level domain names. Either use  the  <u>-t</u>  and  <u>-c</u>
       options to specify the type and class, use the <u>-q</u> to specify the domain name, or use "IN." and "CH." when
       looking up these top-level domains.

</pre><h4><b>SIMPLE</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       A typical invocation of <b>dig</b> looks like:

          dig @server name type

       where:

       <b>server</b> is  the  name  or  IP  address  of  the  name  server  to  query.  This  can be an IPv4 address in
              dotted-decimal notation or an IPv6 address in colon-delimited notation. When the  supplied  <b>server</b>
              argument is a hostname, <b>dig</b> resolves that name before querying that name server.

              If no <b>server</b> argument is provided, <b>dig</b> consults <b><a href="file:/etc/resolv.conf">/etc/resolv.conf</a></b>; if an address is found there, it
              queries  the  name server at that address. If either of the <u>-4</u> or <u>-6</u> options are in use, then only
              addresses for the corresponding transport are tried. If no usable addresses are found,  <b>dig</b>  sends
              the query to the local host. The reply from the name server that responds is displayed.

       <b>name</b>   is the name of the resource record that is to be looked up.

       <b>type</b>   indicates  what  type  of  query  is required - ANY, A, MX, SIG, etc.  <b>type</b> can be any valid query
              type. If no <b>type</b> argument is supplied, <b>dig</b> performs a lookup for an A record.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-4</b>     This option indicates that only IPv4 should be used.

       <b>-6</b>     This option indicates that only IPv6 should be used.

       <b>-b</b> <b>address[#port]</b>
              This option sets the source IP address of the query. The <b>address</b> must be a valid address on one of
              the host's network interfaces, or "0.0.0.0"  or  "::".  An  optional  port  may  be  specified  by
              appending <b>#port</b>.

       <b>-c</b> <b>class</b>
              This option sets the query class. The default <b>class</b> is IN; other classes are HS for Hesiod records
              or CH for Chaosnet records.

       <b>-f</b> <b>file</b>
              This  option  sets  batch  mode,  in which <b>dig</b> reads a list of lookup requests to process from the
              given <b>file</b>. Each line in the file should be organized in the same way it would be presented  as  a
              query to <b>dig</b> using the command-line interface.

       <b>-h</b>     Print a usage summary.

       <b>-k</b> <b>keyfile</b>
              This  option  tells <b>dig</b> to sign queries using TSIG or <a href="../man0/SIG.0.html">SIG</a>(0) using a key read from the given file.
              Key files can be generated using <u>tsig-keygen</u>. When using TSIG authentication with  <b>dig</b>,  the  name
              server  that  is  queried needs to know the key and algorithm that is being used. In BIND, this is
              done by providing appropriate <b>key</b> and <b>server</b> statements in <u>named.conf</u> for TSIG and by  looking  up
              the KEY record in zone data for <a href="../man0/SIG.0.html">SIG</a>(0).

       <b>-m</b>     This option enables memory usage debugging.

       <b>-p</b> <b>port</b>
              This  option sends the query to a non-standard port on the server, instead of the default port 53.
              This option is used to test a name server that has been configured to  listen  for  queries  on  a
              non-standard port number.

       <b>-q</b> <b>name</b>
              This  option specifies the domain name to query. This is useful to distinguish the <b>name</b> from other
              arguments.

       <b>-r</b>     This option indicates that options from <b>${HOME}/.digrc</b> should not be  read.  This  is  useful  for
              scripts that need predictable behavior.

       <b>-t</b> <b>type</b>
              This  option indicates the resource record type to query, which can be any valid query type. If it
              is a resource record type supported in BIND 9, it can be given by the type mnemonic (such as <b>NS</b> or
              <b>AAAA</b>). The default query type is <b>A</b>, unless the <u>-x</u> option is supplied to indicate a reverse lookup.
              A zone transfer can be requested by specifying a type of AXFR. When an incremental  zone  transfer
              (IXFR)  is  required,  set  the <b>type</b> to <b>ixfr=N</b>. The incremental zone transfer contains all changes
              made to the zone since the serial number in the zone's SOA record was <b>N</b>.

              All resource record types can be expressed as <b>TYPEnn</b>, where <b>nn</b> is the number of the type.  If  the
              resource record type is not supported in BIND 9, the result is displayed as described in <u>RFC</u> <u>3597</u>.

       <b>-u</b>     This  option  indicates  that  print  query  times  should  be provided in microseconds instead of
              milliseconds.

       <b>-v</b>     This option prints the version number and exits.

       <b>-x</b> <b>addr</b>
              This option sets simplified reverse lookups, for mapping addresses to names. The <b>addr</b> is  an  IPv4
              address in dotted-decimal notation, or a colon-delimited IPv6 address. When the <u>-x</u> option is used,
              there  is  no  need  to provide the <b>name</b>, <b>class</b>, and <b>type</b> arguments.  <b>dig</b> automatically performs a
              lookup for a name like <b>94.2.0.192.in-addr.arpa</b> and sets the query type and class  to  PTR  and  IN
              respectively. IPv6 addresses are looked up using nibble format under the IP6.ARPA domain.

       <b>-y</b> <b>[hmac:]keyname:secret</b>
              This  option  signs  queries using TSIG with the given authentication key.  <b>keyname</b> is the name of
              the key, and <b>secret</b> is the base64-encoded shared secret. <b>hmac</b> is the name of  the  key  algorithm;
              valid  choices  are <b>hmac-md5</b>, <b>hmac-sha1</b>, <b>hmac-sha224</b>, <b>hmac-sha256</b>, <b>hmac-sha384</b>, or <b>hmac-sha512</b>. If
              <b>hmac</b> is not specified, the default is <b>hmac-md5</b>; if MD5 was disabled, the default is <b>hmac-sha256</b>.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          Only the <u>-k</u> option should be used, rather than the <u>-y</u> option, because with <u>-y</u>  the  shared  secret  is
          supplied  as a command-line argument in clear text. This may be visible in the output from <b>ps1</b> or in a
          history file maintained by the user's shell.

</pre><h4><b>QUERY</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>dig</b> provides a number of query options which affect the way in which lookups are  made  and  the  results
       displayed. Some of these set or reset flag bits in the query header, some determine which sections of the
       answer get printed, and others determine the timeout and retry strategies.

       Each  query  option is identified by a keyword preceded by a plus sign (<b>+</b>). Some keywords set or reset an
       option; these may be preceded by the string <b>no</b> to negate the meaning  of  that  keyword.  Other  keywords
       assign  values  to options, like the timeout interval. They have the form <b>+keyword=value</b>. Keywords may be
       abbreviated, provided the abbreviation is unambiguous; for example, <u>+cd</u> is  equivalent  to  <u>+cdflag</u>.  The
       query options are:

       <b>+aaflag,</b> <b>+noaaflag</b>
              This option is a synonym for <u>+aaonly</u>, <u>+noaaonly</u>.

       <b>+aaonly,</b> <b>+noaaonly</b>
              This option sets the <b>aa</b> flag in the query.

       <b>+additional,</b> <b>+noadditional</b>
              This  option  displays  [or does not display] the additional section of a reply. The default is to
              display it.

       <b>+adflag,</b> <b>+noadflag</b>
              This option sets [or does not set] the AD (authentic data) bit in the  query.  This  requests  the
              server  to  return whether all of the answer and authority sections have been validated as secure,
              according to the security policy of  the  server.  <b>AD=1</b>  indicates  that  all  records  have  been
              validated  as  secure and the answer is not from a OPT-OUT range. <b>AD=0</b> indicates that some part of
              the answer was insecure or not validated.  This bit is set by default.

       <b>+all,</b> <b>+noall</b>
              This option sets or clears all display flags.

       <b>+answer,</b> <b>+noanswer</b>
              This option displays [or does not display] the answer section  of  a  reply.  The  default  is  to
              display it.

       <b>+authority,</b> <b>+noauthority</b>
              This  option  displays  [or  does not display] the authority section of a reply. The default is to
              display it.

       <b>+badcookie,</b> <b>+nobadcookie</b>
              This option retries the lookup with a new server cookie if a BADCOOKIE response is received.

       <b>+besteffort,</b> <b>+nobesteffort</b>
              This option attempts to display the contents of messages which are malformed. The  default  is  to
              not display malformed answers.

       <b>+bufsize[=B]</b>
              This  option  sets the UDP message buffer size advertised using EDNS0 to <b>B</b> bytes.  The maximum and
              minimum sizes of this buffer are 65535 and 0, respectively.  <b>+bufsize</b> restores the default  buffer
              size.

       <b>+cd,</b> <b>+cdflag,</b> <b>+nocdflag</b>
              This  option sets [or does not set] the CD (checking disabled) bit in the query. This requests the
              server to not perform DNSSEC validation of responses.

       <b>+class,</b> <b>+noclass</b>
              This option displays [or does not display] the CLASS when printing the record.

       <b>+cmd,</b> <b>+nocmd</b>
              This option toggles the printing of the initial comment in the output, identifying the version  of
              <b>dig</b>  and  the  query  options  that  have been applied. This option always has a global effect; it
              cannot be set globally and then overridden on a per-lookup basis. The default  is  to  print  this
              comment.

       <b>+comments,</b> <b>+nocomments</b>
              This  option  toggles  the display of some comment lines in the output, with information about the
              packet header and OPT pseudosection, and the names of the response  section.  The  default  is  to
              print these comments.

              Other types of comments in the output are not affected by this option, but can be controlled using
              other command-line switches. These include <u>+cmd</u>, <u>+question</u>, <u>+stats</u>, and <u>+rrcomments</u>.

       <b>+cookie=####,</b> <b>+nocookie</b>
              This  option  sends  [or  does not send] a COOKIE EDNS option, with an optional value. Replaying a
              COOKIE from a previous response allows the server to identify a previous client.  The  default  is
              <b>+cookie</b>.

              <b>+cookie</b> is also set when <u>+trace</u> is set to better emulate the default queries from a nameserver.

       <b>+crypto,</b> <b>+nocrypto</b>
              This  option  toggles the display of cryptographic fields in DNSSEC records. The contents of these
              fields are unnecessary for debugging most DNSSEC validation failures and removing  them  makes  it
              easier  to  see  the common failures. The default is to display the fields. When omitted, they are
              replaced by the string <b>[omitted]</b> or,  in  the  DNSKEY  case,  the  key  ID  is  displayed  as  the
              replacement, e.g. <b>[</b> <b>key</b> <b>id</b> <b>=</b> <b>value</b> <b>]</b>.

       <b>+defname,</b> <b>+nodefname</b>
              This option, which is deprecated, is treated as a synonym for <u>+search</u>, <u>+nosearch</u>.

       <b>+dns64prefix,</b> <b>+nodns64prefix</b>
              Lookup IPV4ONLY.ARPA AAAA and print any DNS64 prefixes found.

       <b>+dnssec,</b> <b>+do,</b> <b>+nodnssec,</b> <b>+nodo</b>
              This  option  requests  that  DNSSEC  records be sent by setting the DNSSEC OK (DO) bit in the OPT
              record in the additional section of the query.

       <b>+domain=somename</b>
              This option sets the search list to contain the single domain  <b>somename</b>,  as  if  specified  in  a
              <b>domain</b>  directive in <b><a href="file:/etc/resolv.conf">/etc/resolv.conf</a></b>, and enables search list processing as if the <u>+search</u> option
              were given.

       <b>+edns[=#],</b> <b>+noedns</b>
              This option specifies the EDNS version to query with. Valid values are 0 to 255.  Setting the EDNS
              version causes an EDNS query to be sent.  <b>+noedns</b> clears the remembered EDNS version. EDNS is  set
              to 0 by default.

       <b>+ednsflags[=#],</b> <b>+noednsflags</b>
              This  option sets the must-be-zero EDNS flags bits (Z bits) to the specified value.  Decimal, hex,
              and octal encodings are accepted. Setting a named flag (e.g., DO) is silently ignored. By default,
              no Z bits are set.

       <b>+ednsnegotiation,</b> <b>+noednsnegotiation</b>
              This option enables/disables EDNS version negotiation. By default,  EDNS  version  negotiation  is
              enabled.

       <b>+ednsopt[=code[:value]],</b> <b>+noednsopt</b>
              This  option  specifies the EDNS option with code point <b>code</b> and an optional payload of <b>value</b> as a
              hexadecimal string. <b>code</b> can be either an EDNS option name  (for  example,  <b>NSID</b>  or  <b>ECS</b>)  or  an
              arbitrary numeric value. <b>+noednsopt</b> clears the EDNS options to be sent.

       <b>+expire,</b> <b>+noexpire</b>
              This option sends an EDNS Expire option.

       <b>+fail,</b> <b>+nofail</b>
              This  option  indicates  that  <u>named</u>  should  try  [or  not  try] the next server if a SERVFAIL is
              received. The default is to not try the next server, which is the reverse of normal stub  resolver
              behavior.

       <b>+fuzztime[=value],</b> <b>+nofuzztime</b>
              This  option  allows the signing time to be specified when generating signed messages.  If a value
              is specified it is the seconds since 00:00:00 January 1, 1970 UTC ignoring leap  seconds.   If  no
              value  is specified 1646972129 (Fri 11 Mar 2022 04:15:29 UTC) is used.  The default is <b>+nofuzztime</b>
              and the current time is used.

       <b>+header-only,</b> <b>+noheader-only</b>
              This option sends a query with a DNS header without a question section. The default is  to  add  a
              question section. The query type and query name are ignored when this is set.

       <b>+https[=value],</b> <b>+nohttps</b>
              This  option  indicates whether to use DNS over HTTPS (DoH) when querying name servers.  When this
              option is in use, the port number defaults to 443.  The  HTTP  POST  request  mode  is  used  when
              sending the query.

              If  <b>value</b>  is  specified,  it  will  be used as the HTTP endpoint in the query URI; the default is
              <b>/dns-query</b>.   So,    for    example,    <b>dig</b>    <b>@example.com</b>    <b>+https</b>    will    use    the    URI
              <b>https://example.com/dns-query</b>.

       <b>+https-get[=value],</b> <b>+nohttps-get</b>
              Similar to <u>+https</u>, except that the HTTP GET request mode is used when sending the query.

       <b>+https-post[=value],</b> <b>+nohttps-post</b>
              Same as <u>+https</u>.

       <b>+http-plain[=value],</b> <b>+nohttp-plain</b>
              Similar  to  <u>+https</u>, except that HTTP queries will be sent over a non-encrypted channel. When this
              option is in use, the port number defaults to 80 and the HTTP request mode is POST.

       <b>+http-plain-get[=value],</b> <b>+nohttp-plain-get</b>
              Similar to <u>+http-plain</u>, except that the HTTP request mode is GET.

       <b>+http-plain-post[=value],</b> <b>+nohttp-plain-post</b>
              Same as <u>+http-plain</u>.

       <b>+identify,</b> <b>+noidentify</b>
              This option shows [or does not show] the IP address and port number that supplied the answer, when
              the <u>+short</u> option is enabled. If short form answers are requested, the default is not to show  the
              source address and port number of the server that provided the answer.

       <b>+idn,</b> <b>+noidn</b>
              Enable or disable IDN processing. By default IDN is enabled for input query names, and for display
              when the output is a terminal.

              You can also turn off <b>dig</b>'s IDN processing by setting the <b>IDN_DISABLE</b> environment variable.

       <b>+ignore,</b> <b>+noignore</b>
              This option ignores [or does not ignore] truncation in UDP responses instead of retrying with TCP.
              By default, TCP retries are performed.

       <b>+keepalive,</b> <b>+nokeepalive</b>
              This option sends [or does not send] an EDNS Keepalive option.

       <b>+keepopen,</b> <b>+nokeepopen</b>
              This  option  keeps  [or  does not keep] the TCP socket open between queries, and reuses it rather
              than creating a new TCP socket for each lookup. The default is <b>+nokeepopen</b>.

       <b>+multiline,</b> <b>+nomultiline</b>
              This option prints [or does not print] records, like the SOA  records,  in  a  verbose  multi-line
              format  with  human-readable  comments.  The  default  is to print each record on a single line to
              facilitate machine parsing of the <b>dig</b> output.

       <b>+ndots=D</b>
              This option sets the number of dots (<b>D</b>) that must appear in <b>name</b> for it to be considered absolute.
              The default value is that defined using the <b>ndots</b> statement in <b><a href="file:/etc/resolv.conf">/etc/resolv.conf</a></b>, or 1 if no  <b>ndots</b>
              statement  is  present.  Names with fewer dots are interpreted as relative names, and are searched
              for in the domains listed in the <b>search</b> or <b>domain</b> directive in <b><a href="file:/etc/resolv.conf">/etc/resolv.conf</a></b> if <u>+search</u> is set.

       <b>+nsid,</b> <b>+nonsid</b>
              When enabled, this option includes an EDNS name server ID request when sending a query.

       <b>+nssearch,</b> <b>+nonssearch</b>
              When this option is set, <b>dig</b> attempts  to  find  the  authoritative  name  servers  for  the  zone
              containing  the name being looked up, and display the SOA record that each name server has for the
              zone.  Addresses of servers that did not respond are also printed.

       <b>+onesoa,</b> <b>+noonesoa</b>
              When enabled, this option prints only one (starting) SOA  record  when  performing  an  AXFR.  The
              default is to print both the starting and ending SOA records.

       <b>+opcode=value,</b> <b>+noopcode</b>
              When  enabled,  this  option  sets  (restores)  the DNS message opcode to the specified value. The
              default value is QUERY (0).

       <b>+padding=value</b>
              This option pads the size of the query packet using the EDNS Padding option  to  blocks  of  <b>value</b>
              bytes. For example, <b>+padding=32</b> causes a 48-byte query to be padded to 64 bytes. The default block
              size is 0, which disables padding; the maximum is 512. Values are ordinarily expected to be powers
              of  two,  such  as  128;  however,  this is not mandatory. Responses to padded queries may also be
              padded, but only if the query uses TCP or DNS COOKIE.

       <b>+proxy[=src_addr[#src_port]-dst_addr[#dst_port]],</b> <b>+noproxy</b>
              When this option is set, <b>dig</b> adds PROXYv2 headers to the  queries.  When  source  and  destination
              addresses  are  specified,  the  headers  contain them and use the <b>PROXY</b> command. It means for the
              remote peer that the queries were sent on behalf of another  node  and  that  the  PROXYv2  header
              reflects  the  original connection endpoints. The default source port is <b>0</b> and destination port is
              <u>53</u>.

              For encrypted DNS transports, to prevent accidental information leakage, encryption is applied  to
              the PROXYv2 headers: the headers are sent right after the handshake process has been completed.

              For plain DNS transports, no encryption is applied to the PROXYv2 headers.

              If the addressees are omitted, PROXYv2 headers, that use the <b>LOCAL</b> command set, are added instead.
              For  the  remote  peer, that means that the queries were sent on purpose without being relayed, so
              the real connection endpoint addresses must be used.

       <b>+proxy-plain[=src_addr[#src_port]-dst_addr[#dst_port],</b> <b>+noproxy-plain</b>
              The same as <b>+[no]proxy</b>, but instructs <b>dig</b> to send PROXYv2 headers ahead of any encryption,  before
              any  handshake  messages  are sent. That makes <b>dig</b> behave exactly how it is described in the PROXY
              protocol specification, but not all software expects such behaviour.

              Please consult the software documentation to find out if  you  need  this  option.  (for  example,
              <b>dnsdist</b> expects encrypted PROXYv2 headers sent over TLS when encryption is used, while <b>HAProxy</b> and
              many other software packages expect plain ones).

              For plain DNS transports the option is effectively an alias for the <b>+[no]proxy</b> described above.

       <b>+qid=value</b>
              This option specifies the query ID to use when sending queries.

       <b>+qr,</b> <b>+noqr</b>
              This  option  toggles the display of the query message as it is sent. By default, the query is not
              printed.

       <b>+question,</b> <b>+noquestion</b>
              This option toggles the display of the question section of a query when an answer is returned. The
              default is to print the question section as a comment.

       <b>+raflag,</b> <b>+noraflag</b>
              This option sets [or does not set] the RA (Recursion Available) bit in the query. The  default  is
              <b>+noraflag</b>. This bit is ignored by the server for QUERY.

       <b>+rdflag,</b> <b>+nordflag</b>
              This option is a synonym for <u>+recurse</u>, <u>+norecurse</u>.

       <b>+recurse,</b> <b>+norecurse</b>
              This  option  toggles the setting of the RD (recursion desired) bit in the query.  This bit is set
              by default, which means <b>dig</b> normally sends recursive queries. Recursion is automatically  disabled
              when the <u>+nssearch</u> or <u>+trace</u> query option is used.

       <b>+retry=T</b>
              This  option  sets  the number of times to retry UDP and TCP queries to server to <b>T</b> instead of the
              default, 2.  Unlike <u>+tries</u>, this does not include the initial query.

       <b>+rrcomments,</b> <b>+norrcomments</b>
              This option toggles the display of per-record comments in the output (for example,  human-readable
              key  information  about  DNSKEY  records).  The  default  is  not  to print record comments unless
              multiline mode is active.

       <b>+search,</b> <b>+nosearch</b>
              This option uses [or does not use] the search list defined by the searchlist or  domain  directive
              in <b>resolv.conf</b>, if any. The search list is not used by default.

              <b>ndots</b> from <b>resolv.conf</b> (default 1), which may be overridden by <u>+ndots</u>, determines whether the name
              is treated as relative and hence whether a search is eventually performed.

       <b>+short,</b> <b>+noshort</b>
              This  option  toggles  whether a terse answer is provided. The default is to print the answer in a
              verbose form. This option always has  a  global  effect;  it  cannot  be  set  globally  and  then
              overridden on a per-lookup basis.

       <b>+showbadcookie,</b> <b>+noshowbadcookie</b>
              This option toggles whether to show the message containing the BADCOOKIE rcode before retrying the
              request or not. The default is to not show the messages.

       <b>+showsearch,</b> <b>+noshowsearch</b>
              This option performs [or does not perform] a search showing intermediate results.

       <b>+split=W</b>
              This  option  splits  long  hex-  or  base64-formatted fields in resource records into chunks of <b>W</b>
              characters (where <b>W</b> is rounded up to the nearest multiple  of  4).  <b>+nosplit</b>  or  <b>+split=0</b>  causes
              fields  not to be split at all. The default is 56 characters, or 44 characters when multiline mode
              is active.

       <b>+stats,</b> <b>+nostats</b>
              This option toggles the printing of statistics: when the query was made, the size  of  the  reply,
              etc. The default behavior is to print the query statistics as a comment after each lookup.

       <b>+subnet=addr[/prefix-length],</b> <b>+nosubnet</b>
              This option sends [or does not send] an EDNS CLIENT-SUBNET option with the specified IP address or
              network prefix.

              <b>dig</b>  <b>+subnet=0.0.0.0/0</b>, or simply <b>dig</b> <b>+subnet=0</b> for short, sends an EDNS CLIENT-SUBNET option with
              an empty address and a source prefix-length of zero, which signals a resolver  that  the  client's
              address information must <u>not</u> be used when resolving this query.

       <b>+tcflag,</b> <b>+notcflag</b>
              This option sets [or does not set] the TC (TrunCation) bit in the query. The default is <b>+notcflag</b>.
              This bit is ignored by the server for QUERY.

       <b>+tcp,</b> <b>+notcp</b>
              This  option  indicates whether to use TCP when querying name servers.  The default behavior is to
              use UDP unless a type <b>any</b> or <b>ixfr=N</b> query is requested, in which case the  default  is  TCP.  AXFR
              queries  always  use  TCP.  To  prevent retry over TCP when TC=1 is returned from a UDP query, use
              <b>+ignore</b>.

       <b>+timeout=T</b>
              This option sets the timeout for a query to <b>T</b> seconds.  The  default  timeout  is  5  seconds.  An
              attempt to set <b>T</b> to less than 1 is silently set to 1.

       <b>+tls,</b> <b>+notls</b>
              This  option  indicates  whether  to  use DNS over TLS (DoT) when querying name servers. When this
              option is in use, the port number defaults to 853.

       <b>+tls-ca[=file-name],</b> <b>+notls-ca</b>
              This option enables remote server TLS certificate validation for DNS transports, relying  on  TLS.
              Certificate  authorities  certificates  are loaded from the specified PEM file (<b>file-name</b>). If the
              file is not specified, the default certificates from the global certificates store are used.

       <b>+tls-certfile=file-name,</b> <b>+tls-keyfile=file-name,</b> <b>+notls-certfile,</b> <b>+notls-keyfile</b>
              These options set the state of certificate-based client authentication for DNS transports, relying
              on TLS. Both certificate chain file and private key file are expected to be in PEM  format.   Both
              options must be specified at the same time.

       <b>+tls-hostname=hostname,</b> <b>+notls-hostname</b>
              This option makes <b>dig</b> use the provided hostname during remote server TLS certificate verification.
              Otherwise, the DNS server name is used. This option has no effect if <u>+tls-ca</u> is not specified.

       <b>+trace,</b> <b>+notrace</b>
              This  option  toggles tracing of the delegation path from the root name servers for the name being
              looked up. Tracing is disabled by default.  When tracing is enabled, <b>dig</b> makes  iterative  queries
              to  resolve  the  name  being  looked  up. It follows referrals from the root servers, showing the
              answer from each server that was used to resolve the lookup.

              If <b>@server</b> is also specified, it affects only the initial query for the root zone name servers.

              <u>+dnssec</u> is set when <u>+trace</u> is set, to better emulate the default queries from a name server.

              Note that the <b>delv</b> <b>+ns</b> option can also be used for tracing the resolution of a name from the  root
              (see <u>delv</u>).

       <b>+tries=T</b>
              This  option  sets  the  number  of times to try UDP and TCP queries to server to <b>T</b> instead of the
              default, 3. If <b>T</b> is less than or equal to zero, the number of tries is silently rounded up to 1.

       <b>+ttlid,</b> <b>+nottlid</b>
              This option displays [or does not display] the TTL when printing the record.

       <b>+ttlunits,</b> <b>+nottlunits</b>
              This option displays [or does not display] the TTL in friendly human-readable time units of <b>s</b>,  <b>m</b>,
              <b>h</b>, <b>d</b>, and <b>w</b>, representing seconds, minutes, hours, days, and weeks. This implies <u>+ttlid</u>.

       <b>+unknownformat,</b> <b>+nounknownformat</b>
              This option prints all RDATA in unknown RR type presentation format (<u>RFC</u> <u>3597</u>).  The default is to
              print RDATA for known types in the type's presentation format.

       <b>+vc,</b> <b>+novc</b>
              This  option  uses [or does not use] TCP when querying name servers. This alternate syntax to <u>+tcp</u>
              is provided for backwards compatibility. The <b>vc</b> stands for "virtual circuit."

       <b>+yaml,</b> <b>+noyaml</b>
              When enabled, this option prints the responses (and, if <u>+qr</u> is in use, also the outgoing  queries)
              in a detailed YAML format.

       <b>+zflag,</b> <b>+nozflag</b>
              This  option sets [or does not set] the last unassigned DNS header flag in a DNS query.  This flag
              is off by default.

</pre><h4><b>MULTIPLE</b> <b>QUERIES</b></h4><pre>
       The BIND 9 implementation of <b>dig</b> supports specifying multiple queries on the command line (in addition to
       supporting the <u>-f</u> batch file option). Each of those queries can be supplied with its own  set  of  flags,
       options, and query options.

       In  this  case,  each  <b>query</b> argument represents an individual query in the command-line syntax described
       above. Each consists of any of the standard options and flags, the name to  be  looked  up,  an  optional
       query type and class, and any query options that should be applied to that query.

       A global set of query options, which should be applied to all queries, can also be supplied. These global
       query  options  must  precede  the  first  tuple  of name, class, type, options, flags, and query options
       supplied on the command line. Any global query options (except <u>+cmd</u> and <u>+short</u> options) can be overridden
       by a query-specific set of query options. For example:

          dig +qr www.isc.org any -x 127.0.0.1 isc.org ns +noqr

       shows how <b>dig</b> can be used from the command line to make three lookups: an ANY query  for  <b>www.isc.org</b>,  a
       reverse  lookup  of 127.0.0.1, and a query for the NS records of <b>isc.org</b>. A global query option of <u>+qr</u> is
       applied, so that <b>dig</b> shows the initial query it made for each lookup. The final query has a  local  query
       option of <u>+noqr</u> which means that <b>dig</b> does not print the initial query when it looks up the NS records for
       <b>isc.org</b>.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>CODES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>dig</b> return codes are:

       <b>0</b>      DNS response received, including NXDOMAIN status

       <b>1</b>      Usage error

       <b>8</b>      Couldn't open batch file

       <b>9</b>      No reply from server

       <b>10</b>     Internal error

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <b><a href="file:/etc/resolv.conf">/etc/resolv.conf</a></b>

       <b>${HOME}/.digrc</b>

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       There are probably too many query options.
