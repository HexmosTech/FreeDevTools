</pre><h4><b>PROLOG</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       readonly — set the readonly attribute for variables

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       readonly name<b>[</b>=<u>word</u><b>]</b>...

       readonly -p

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  variables  whose  <u>name</u>s are specified shall be given the <u>readonly</u> attribute. The values of variables
       with the <u>readonly</u> attribute cannot be changed by subsequent assignment, nor can those variables be  unset
       by  the  <u>unset</u>  utility.  If the name of a variable is followed by =<u>word</u>, then the value of that variable
       shall be set to <u>word</u>.

       The <u>readonly</u> special built-in shall support the Base Definitions volume of  POSIX.1‐2017,  <u>Section</u>  <u>12.2</u>,
       <u>Utility</u> <u>Syntax</u> <u>Guidelines</u>.

       When  <b>-p</b>  is  specified,  <u>readonly</u>  writes  to  the standard output the names and values of all read-only
       variables, in the following format:

           "readonly %s=%s\n", &lt;<u>name</u>&gt;, &lt;<u>value</u>&gt;

       if <u>name</u> is set, and

           "readonly %s\n", &lt;<u>name</u>&gt;

       if <u>name</u> is unset.

       The shell shall format the output, including the proper use of  quoting,  so  that  it  is  suitable  for
       reinput  to the shell as commands that achieve the same value and <u>readonly</u> attribute-setting results in a
       shell execution environment in which:

        1. Variables with values at the time they were output do not have the <u>readonly</u> attribute set.

        2. Variables that were unset at the time they were output do not have a value at the time at  which  the
           saved output is reinput to the shell.

       When no arguments are given, the results are unspecified.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       See the DESCRIPTION.

</pre><h4><b>OPERANDS</b></h4><pre>
       See the DESCRIPTION.

</pre><h4><b>STDIN</b></h4><pre>
       Not used.

</pre><h4><b>INPUT</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>ASYNCHRONOUS</b> <b>EVENTS</b></h4><pre>
       Default.

</pre><h4><b>STDOUT</b></h4><pre>
       See the DESCRIPTION.

</pre><h4><b>STDERR</b></h4><pre>
       The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.

</pre><h4><b>OUTPUT</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>EXTENDED</b> <b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
        0    All <u>name</u> operands were successfully marked readonly.

       &gt;0    At  least  one  <u>name</u>  could  not  be  marked  readonly, or the <b>-p</b> option was specified and an error
             occurred.

</pre><h4><b>CONSEQUENCES</b> <b>OF</b> <b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       Default.

       <u>The</u> <u>following</u> <u>sections</u> <u>are</u> <u>informative.</u>

</pre><h4><b>APPLICATION</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       readonly HOME PWD

</pre><h4><b>RATIONALE</b></h4><pre>
       Some historical shells preserve the <u>readonly</u>  attribute  across  separate  invocations.  This  volume  of
       POSIX.1‐2017 allows this behavior, but does not require it.

       The  <b>-p</b>  option allows portable access to the values that can be saved and then later restored using, for
       example, a <u>dot</u> script. Also see the RATIONALE for <u>export</u> for a description  of  the  no-argument  and  <b>-p</b>
       output cases and a related example.

       Read-only  functions  were  considered,  but  they  were  omitted  as  not  being  historical practice or
       particularly useful. Furthermore,  functions  must  not  be  read-only  across  invocations  to  preclude
       ``spoofing''  (spoofing  is  the  term for the practice of creating a program that acts like a well-known
       utility with the intent of subverting the real intent of the user) of administrative or security-relevant
       (or security-conscious) shell scripts.
