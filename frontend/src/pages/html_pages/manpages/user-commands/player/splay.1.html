</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       splay - MPEG-1,2 Audio layer 1,2,3 file player

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>splay</b> [-2VMfmrsv] [-k num] [-d dev] [-l list] [-t num] <u>filenames...</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Splay</u>  is  the  sound  file player such as MPEG-1,2 Audio files.  And you can play these files using list
       file.  With pthread, it can play sound files smoother.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Splay</u> has several options.

       <b>-2</b>     play MPEG-Audio files with half-frequency.  If you use this option, you may play MPEG audio  files
              with job which exhausts CPU very much.
       <b>-f</b>     display info on played and remaining frames and time.
       <b>-m</b>     force to mono.  Play with mono even if file is in stereo.
       <b>-r</b>     Repeat forever.  If you -r with -s, list files are shuffled every time.
       <b>-s</b>     Shuffle  play. If you give list file or a number of files, Splay will rearrange them randomly. And
              with -r every time the order of files is changed.
       <b>-v[v[v]]</b>
              Verbose, Very verbose, Very very verbose.
       <b>-M</b>     Play MPEG file from standard input.
       <b>-V</b>     Show version number.
       <b>-t</b>  <b>num</b>
              <u>num</u> of frames were saved during playing. When CPU is so busy and  prevents  splay  from  decoding,
              splay will play back using saved frames. This feature lets you do other job freely while listening
              to MPEG music.
       <b>-k</b>  <b>num</b>
              <u>num</u> of frames are skipped at the start of playing.
       <b>-d</b>  <b>dev</b>
              Change device file. Default device file is <u>/dev/dsp.</u>  If you can't use this device file or you can
              output  raw  type data to file, you can use this option.  If the first character of <u>dev</u> is <b>/</b> , <u>dev</u>
              would be considered as device file, If the first character of <u>dev</u> is <b>-</b> , <u>dev</u> would  be  considered
              as standard output, otherwise <u>dev</u> would be considered as normal file.
       <b>-l</b>  <b>list</b>
              Select list file.  <b>http://</b> can be used. (e.g. <a href="http://localhost/abc.m3u">http://localhost/abc.m3u</a>)
       <b>filenames</b>
              You can put several files, and use <b>http://</b> If you use <b>-l</b> option, these will be ignored.
