</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       mpg321 — Simple and lightweight command line MP3 player

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>mpg321</b> <b>[options]</b> <b>file(s)</b> <b>|</b> <b>URL(s)</b> <b>|</b> <b>-</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>mpg321</b>  is  a free command-line mp3 player, which uses the mad audio decoding library. mpg321 was written
       to  be  a  drop-in  replacement  for  the  (by-then)  non-free  <b>mpg123</b>  player.   Some  functions  remain
       unimplemented,  but  mpg321  should function as a basic drop-in replacement for <b>mpg123</b> front-ends such as
       <b>gqmpeg</b>, and those programs which use mpg123 to decode mp3 files (like <b>gtoaster</b>,  and  other  CD-recording
       software).

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-o</b> <b>devicetype</b>
                 Set the output device type to <b>devicetype</b>.  <b>devicetype</b> can be one of:

                 oss - the Linux Open Sound System;

                 sun - the Sun audio system;

                 alsa - the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture;

                 alsa09 - the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture, version 0.9;

                 esd - the Enlightened Sound Daemon;

                 arts - the analog real-time synthesiser

                 See <b>-a</b> <b>device</b>, below.

       <b>-a</b> <b>device</b>, <b>--audiodevice</b> <b>device</b>
                 Use  <b>device</b>  for audio-out instead of the default device, depending on the output device you've
                 chosen (via <b>-o</b> <b>devicetype</b>).  By default this is the native sound device.  Generally this is the
                 device for <b>devicetype</b> (or the default system device) to use for output (i.e. <b>/dev/sound/dsp1</b>).

                 This option has no effect with <b>-o</b> <b>arts</b>.

                 For <b>-o</b> <b>esd</b>, specify the host on which esd is running; defaults to localhost.

                 For <b>-o</b> <b>alsa</b>, specify audio device using the hw:x,y syntax, where x and y are  numbers,  default
                 is  hw:0,0.   For  example,  if  there  is only one device installed, in most cases, the device
                 should be named hw:0,0.  When there is only one device, the device should always have the  same
                 name and numbers.

       <b>-g</b> <b>N</b>, <b>--gain</b> <b>N</b>
                 Set gain (volume) to N (1-100).

       <b>-k</b> <b>N</b>, <b>--skip</b> <b>N</b>
                 Skip N frames into the file being played.

       <b>-n</b> <b>N</b>, <b>--frames</b> <b>N</b>
                 Decode only the first N frames of the stream. By default, the entire stream is decoded.

       <b>-@</b> <b>list</b>, <b>--list</b> <b>list</b>
                 Use  the  file  list  for a playlist. The list should be in a format of filenames followed by a
                 line feed. Multiple -@ or --list specifiers will be ignored; only the last -@ or --list  option
                 will  be  used.  The  playlist  is concatenated with filenames specified on the command-line to
                 produce one master playlist. A filename of '-' will cause  standard  input  to  be  read  as  a
                 playlist.

       <b>-z</b>, <b>--shuffle</b>
                 Shuffle  playlists and files specified on the command-line. Produces a randomly-sorted playlist
                 which is then played through once.

       <b>-Z</b>, <b>--random</b>
                 Randomise playlists and files specified on the command-line. Files are played through, choosing
                 at random; this means that random files will be played for as long as mpg321 is running.

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b>
                 Be more verbose. Show current byte, bytes remaining, time, and time remaining, as well as  more
                 information about the mp3 file.

       <b>-s</b>, <b>--stdout</b>
                 Use  standard  output  instead  of an audio device for output. Output is in 16-bit PCM, little-
                 endian.

       <b>-w</b> <b>N</b>, <b>--wav</b> <b>N</b>
                 Write to wav file N instead of using the audio device. This option will be preferred  if  --cdr
                 or  --au  are specified too. Specifying '-' for N will cause the file to be written to standard
                 output.

       <b>--cdr</b> <b>N</b>   Write to cdr file N instead of using the audio device. Specifying '-' for N will cause the file
                 to be written to standard output.

       <b>--au</b> <b>N</b>    Write to au file N instead of using the audio device. Specifying '-' for N will cause the  file
                 to be written to standard output.

       <b>-t</b>, <b>--test</b>
                 Test mode; do no output at all.

       <b>-q</b>, <b>--quiet</b>
                 Quiet mode; suppress output of mpg123 boilerplate and file and song name.

       <b>-B</b>        Read  recursively the given directories. Allows you to define only the directory or directories
                 and then mpg321 recursively plays all the songs.

       <b>-F</b>        Turn on FFT analysis on PCM data. Remote mode only

       <b>-S</b>        Report song to AudioScrobbler (last.fm).

       <b>-x</b>        Set xterm title setting

       <b>-b</b>        Number of decoded frames for the output buffer.

       <b>-K</b>        Enable Basic Keys.

       <b>-R</b>        "Remote control" mode. Useful for front-ends. Allows seeking and  pausing  of  mp3  files.  See
                 README.remote (in /usr/share/doc/mpg321 on Debian and some other systems.)

       <b>-3</b>, <b>--restart</b>
                 Restart "remote shell". Used only when in "Remote control" mode.

       <b>--stereo</b>  Force  stereo  output:  duplicates  mono stream on second output channel. Useful for output for
                 devices that don't understand mono, such as some CD players.

       <b>--aggressive</b>
                 Aggressive mode; try to get higher priority on the system. Needs root permissions.

       <b>--skip-printing-frames=N</b>
                 Skip N frames between printing a frame status update, in both Remote Control (-R)  and  verbose
                 (-v) mode. Can help CPU utilisation on slower machines. This is an mpg321-specific option.

       <b>-l</b> <b>N</b>, <b>--loop</b> <b>N</b>
                 Loop song or playlist N times.If N is 0 means infinite times.

       <b>--help</b>, <b>--longhelp</b>
                 Show summary of options.

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--version</b>
                 Show version of program.

</pre><h4><b>Basic</b> <b>keys</b> <b>(enabled</b> <b>with</b> <b>-K):</b></h4><pre>
        <b>*</b> or <b>/</b>   Increase or decrease volume.

        <b>n</b>        Skip song.

        <b>m</b>        Mute/unmute.
