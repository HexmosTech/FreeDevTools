</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       <b>wmrack</b> - CD Player and Mixer dock applet

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>wmrack</b> [options]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>wmrack</b>  is  a combined CD player and Audio Mixer designed to be used with WindowMaker's dock. It can
       also be used with other window managers, and can be swallowed by a  variety  of  tools,  such  as  fvwm's
       button  bar or gnome's panel.  <b>wmrack</b> handles mounted volumes, opens and closes the tray, can display the
       current position in various ways and skips also data tracks.  It gives  you  access  to  all  your  mixer
       devices, so that you may change volume or balance and set the record source.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-b</b> <b>COLSPEC</b> or <b>--background</b> <b>COLSPEC</b>
              Specifies  the  background  color  of  the LED. It is available through the symbolic XPM colorname
              <u>led_color_black.</u>

              The other colors of the LED can be changed using the <b>-l</b> option.

              To find out what colors are available, try <u>showrgb</u> (part of X11).

       <b>-d</b> <b>DEVICE</b> or <b>--device</b> <b>DEVICE</b>
              Sets the CD-ROM device. This defaults to /dev/cdrom.

       <b>-h</b> or  <b>--help</b>
              Prints a summary of supported options and their default values.

       <b>-l</b> <b>COLSPEC</b> or <b>--ledcolor</b> <b>COLSPEC</b>
              Specifies the color of the led. It is darkened two times (for a total of three colors) to get  all
              needed colors. So better use a bright color.

              For  the  design  of  own  XPM, the ledcolor is made available through the use of the symbolic xpm
              color names <u>led_color_high,</u> <u>led_color_low,</u> and  <u>led_color_med.</u>   There  is  also  a  symbol  named
              <u>led_color_back</u> to get the default background color of the led-display. It can be changed using the
              <b>-l</b> option.

              To find out what colors are available, try <u>showrgb</u> (part of X11).

       <b>-m</b> <b>DEVICE</b> or <b>--mixer</b> <b>DEVICE</b>
              Sets the MIXER device. This defaults to /dev/mixer.

       <b>-p</b> or <b>--noprobe</b>
              This  option disables the startup probing for a cd. Default is to probe the cdrom. This will close
              the tray and read the TOC of the cd (if there is one).

       <b>-s</b> <b>STYLEFILE</b> or <b>--style</b> <b>STYLEFILE</b>
              <b>wmrack</b> will try to load its window-pixmaps from the specified <b>STYLEFILE.</b>  It will search this file
              for XPM pixmaps named <u>cdnodisc,</u> <u>cdplaying,</u> <u>cdpaused,</u> <u>cdstopped,</u> <u>cdled,</u> <u>mixer,</u> and <u>mixled.</u>  If some
              of those are not defined, the compile-time defaults will be used.

       <b>-w</b> or <b>--withdrawn</b>
              Starts the <b>wmrack</b> in withdrawn window state. This is useful to dock the window to <b>WindowMaker.</b>

       <b>-M</b> <b>MODESTRING</b> or <b>--mode</b> <b>MODESTRING</b>
              By default <b>wmrack</b> will startup showing the CDROM controls. With this option you can  specify  what
              controls should be shown. Valid <b>MODESTRINGS</b> <b>are</b> <u>cdrom,</u> and <u>mixer.</u>

</pre><h4><b>INVOCATION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>wmrack</b> can be called using different ways. The most common invocation is from your dock file:

               wmrack
               WMRack
               <u>POSITION</u> 2 -1 0
               wmrack
               --withdrawn

       Another way to call <b>wmrack</b> is to swallow it into the <b><a href="../man1/afterstep.1.html">afterstep</a>(1)</b> <b><a href="../man1/Wharf.1.html">Wharf</a>(1)</b>. This is best done placing the
       following line into your <u>.steprc</u>:

            *Wharf WMRack nil Swallow "wmrack" wmrack &amp;

       This  method  will  also  work  for  other  button-bars, such as the <b><a href="../man1/FvwmButtons.1.html">FvwmButtons</a>(1)</b> of the <b><a href="../man1/fvwm.1.html">fvwm</a>(1)</b> window
       manager.

</pre><h4><b>GENERAL</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>wmrack</b> features a simple click interface. All times the buttons  will  show  a  standard  sign  which
       specifies the action it will do. But there are some notable extensions to that explained below.

       You  can  always  change  the controls shown by clicking the middle button (this is the one which shows a
       disc or a speaker) of the controls. This button will show a symbol of the controls you can change  to  by
       pressing it (the disc and the speaker).

       If you click this button with Control-Button-3, <b>WMrack</b> will exit.

</pre><h4><b>CDROM</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       The  default  behavior  of <b>wmrack</b> is to try to read the cdrom at startup. If there was no cd, it will not
       try again unless you press the close or play button. This will close the cdrom and again try to read  it.
       Unless there is a cd, <b>wmrack</b> will again suspend until your next action.

       <b>open</b> <b>tray</b>
              Clicking an open/eject button with button-3 will always open the tray.

       <b>skip</b>   By  pressing  the  button down and holding it on one of the prev/next track buttons the cdrom goes
              fast forward or backward.

       <b>time</b> <b>left</b>
              A button-1 click into the time display switches between time running and time left display.

       <b>total</b> <b>time</b>
              A button-2 click into the time display switches between track and total time.

       <b>repeat</b> A button-3 click into the time display cycles through normal mode, repeat all, and repeat one play
              mode.

       The cd player also offers a play list functionality. By default it will map out all data  tracks  of  the
       current  cdrom,  but  you can also randomize the list or program it to the tracks you want to hear. These
       functions are only available while a cdrom is in the drive and the drive is <u>stopped</u>.

       <b>randomize</b>
              Clicking Control-Button-3 to the track display causes the playlist to be randomized. No track will
              repeat, the tracks are just mixed up.

              You will see the short message <u>RA:ND</u> in the time display.

       <b>start</b> <b>programming</b>
              Click Control-Button-1 into the track display to start programing a new playlist. You will  see  a
              short  <u>PR:OG</u>  message  in  the  time  display and a <u>M</u> will show up in the lower left corner of the
              display.

       <b>add</b> <b>track</b> <b>to</b> <b>list</b>
              Use the prev-/next-track buttons to select a track and click Mod1-Button-1 into the track  display
              to add it to the playlist. The time display will show the number of the tracks in the list and the
              number  of  the  selected  track  for a short time and will than switch back and display the total
              ength of the playlist.

       <b>clear</b> <b>list</b>
              To abort the programing of a playlist click Control-Button-1 into the track-display.

       <b>start</b> <b>playing</b> <b>the</b> <b>list</b>
              Simply press the PLAY button to play the list.

</pre><h4><b>MIXER</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       Main controls of the mixer are the two volume scales at the left and the right side of the display. Using
       the mouse the scales can be modified.

       <b>button-1</b>
              change volume of clicked scale

       <b>button-2</b>
              change volume of both scales

       <b>button-3</b>
              change the balance of the volume

       Clicking into the alphanumeric display changes the currently  shown  mixer  device.  Some  of  the  valid
       devices  are VOlume, BAss, TReble, SYnth, PCm, SPeaker, LIne, MIc, CD, MiXer, Pcm2, REcord, IGain, OGain,
       Line1, Line2, and Line3.  You can also remove devices from this list.

       <b>button-1</b>
              go to the next device

       <b>button-2</b>
              go to the main volume (first device)

       <b>button-3</b>
              go to the previous device

       <b>control-button-1</b>
              show all devices

       <b>control-button-3</b>
              remove current device

       Below the change-controls button is the record source button. It show either a 'X' and is inactive, or it
       show a speaker or a recording sign and is active.  By pressing this button you can change the  source  of
       your recordings.

       <b>button-1</b>
