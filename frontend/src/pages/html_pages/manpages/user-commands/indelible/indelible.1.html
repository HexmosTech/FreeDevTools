</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       indelible - powerful and flexible simulator of biological evolution

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>indelible</b>

       No options can be passed via the commandline.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>indelible</b> can simulate evolution of multi-partitioned nucleotide, amino-acid, or codon data sets through
       the processes of insertion, deletion, and substitution in continuous time. All common evolutionary models
       are supported.

       The full documentation for <b>indelible</b> is available under <u>/usr/share/doc/indelible/help/index.html</u>.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>indelible</b> reads the settings for a simulation run from a file named <u>control.txt</u> in the current directory.
       The file is split into blocks, with each block controlling one particular aspect of the simulation.
       Blocks may contain further sub-blocks. Comments can be given in C or C++ style. If <b>indelible</b> is executed
       without a control file present, an example file is generated.

       <b>[TYPE]</b> type
              Every control file must begin with a <b>TYPE</b> block. The possible types are <u>NUCLEOTIDE</u>, <u>AMINOACID</u>, and
              <u>CODON</u>.

       <b>[SETTINGS]</b>
              This  block  specifies non-essential user preferences such as output file types and formats, seeds
              for the random number generator, and whether to output detailed reports.

       <b>[MODEL]</b> modelname
              This block starts a new evolutionary model to be used for simulation.  The  particular  parameters
              including  substitution  models,  indel-rates  and codon-site models are controlled via submodels.
              <u>modelname</u> can be any name of your choosing.

       <b>[TREE]</b> treename newick
              This block is used to specify a guide-tree with the given name  <u>treename</u>.  Evolutionary  distances
              are represented as branch lengths for the tree in <u>NEWICK</u> format.

       <b>[BRANCHES]</b>
              These  blocks  are  used to simulate non-stationary and non-homogenous processes. Different models
              can be specified on different branches of the  guide-tree  allowing  branches  to  have  different
              models of substitution, indel length distribution, rate heterogeneity, base composition etc.

       <b>[PARTITIONS]</b> partitionname
              During  each run multiple sequence partitions can be simulated. For each partition the guide-tree,
              evolutionary model and sequence length has to be specified.

       <b>[EVOLVE]</b>
              Within this block multiple replicas of a partition may be generated.
