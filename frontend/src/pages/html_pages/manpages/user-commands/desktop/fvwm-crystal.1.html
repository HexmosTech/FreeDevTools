</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       fvwm-crystal - Desktop environment based on fvwm2

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>fvwm-crystal</b> is a desktop environment based on fvwm2. A file manager may be optionally used to display
       desktop icons, ROX-filer and nautilus are supported for this task. FVWM-crystal furthermore has UI
       integration for various music players, among them audacious and mpd. There is also a very powerful menu
       system that has an extensive default configuration but may be customized and extended by each user to fit
       personal requirements. The fvwm-crystal script launches fvwm-crystal and may be called, e.g., from your
       <a href="file:~/.xinitrc">~/.xinitrc</a> file.

       This manual page was written for the Debian distribution because the original program does not have a
       manual page.
