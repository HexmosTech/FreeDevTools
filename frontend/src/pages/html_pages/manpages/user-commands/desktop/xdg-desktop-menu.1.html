       <b>xdg-desktop-menu</b> {<b>--help</b> | <b>--manual</b> | <b>--version</b>}

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The xdg-desktop-menu program can be used to install new menu entries to the desktop's application menu.

       The application menu works according to the XDG Desktop Menu Specification at
       <b><a href="http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications/menu-spec">http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications/menu-spec</a></b>

</pre><h4><b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       install
           Install one or more applications in a submenu of the desktop menu system.

           <u>desktop-file</u>: A desktop file represents a single menu entry in the menu. Desktop files are defined by
           the freedesktop.org Desktop Entry Specification. The most important aspects of *.desktop files are
           summarized below.

           Menu entries can be added to the menu system in two different ways. They can either be added to a
           predefined submenu in the menu system based on one or more category keywords, or they can be added to
           a new submenu.

           To add a menu entry to a predefined submenu the desktop file that represents the menu entry must have
           a Categories= entry that lists one or more keywords. The menu item will be included in an appropriate
           submenu based on the included keywords.

           To add menu items to a new submenu the desktop-files must be preceded by a directory-file that
           describes the submenu. If multiple desktop-files are specified, all entries will be added to the same
           menu. If entries are installed to a menu that has been created with a previous call to
           <b>xdg-desktop-menu</b> the entries will be installed in addition to any already existing entries.

           <u>directory-file</u>: The *.directory file indicated by <u>directory-file</u> represents a submenu. The directory
           file provides the name and icon for a submenu. The name of the directory file is used to identify the
           submenu.

           If multiple directory files are provided each file will represent a submenu within the menu that
           precedes it, creating a nested menu hierarchy (sub-sub-menus). The menu entries themselves will be
           added to the last submenu.

           Directory files follow the syntax defined by the freedesktop.org Desktop Entry Specification.

       uninstall
           Remove applications or submenus from the desktop menu system previously installed with
           <b>xdg-desktop-menu</b> <b>install</b>.

           A submenu and the associated directory file is only removed when the submenu no longer contains any
           menu entries.

       forceupdate
           Force an update of the menu system.

           This command is only useful if the last call to xdg-desktop-menu included the <b>--noupdate</b> option.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--noupdate</b>
           Postpone updating the menu system. If multiple updates to the menu system are made in sequence this
           flag can be used to indicate that additional changes will follow and that it is not necessary to
           update the menu system right away.

       <b>--novendor</b>
           Normally, xdg-desktop-menu checks to ensure that any *.directory and *.desktop files to be installed
           has a vendor prefix. This option can be used to disable that check.

           A vendor prefix consists of alpha characters ([a-zA-Z]) and is terminated with a dash ("-").
           Companies and organizations are encouraged to use a word or phrase, preferably the organizations
           name, for which they hold a trademark as their vendor prefix. The purpose of the vendor prefix is to
           prevent name conflicts.

       <b>--mode</b> <u>mode</u>
           <u>mode</u> can be <u>user</u> or <u>system</u>. In user mode the file is (un)installed for the current user only. In
           system mode the file is (un)installed for all users on the system. Usually only root is allowed to
           install in system mode.

           The default is to use system mode when called by root and to use user mode when called by a non-root
           user.

       <b>--help</b>
           Show command synopsis.

       <b>--manual</b>
           Show this manual page.

       <b>--version</b>
           Show the xdg-utils version information.

</pre><h4><b>DESKTOP</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       An application item in the application menu is represented by a *.desktop file. A *.desktop file consists
       of a <u>[Desktop</u> <u>Entry]</u> header followed by several <u>Key</u>=<u>Value</u> lines.

       A *.desktop file can provide a name and description for an application in several different languages.
       This is done by adding a language code as used by LC_MESSAGES in square brackets behind the <u>Key</u>. This way
       one can specify different values for the same <u>Key</u> depending on the currently selected language.

       The following keys are often used:

       Type=Application
           This is a mandatory field that indicates that the *.desktop file describes an application launcher.

       Name=<u>Application</u> <u>Name</u>
           The name of the application. For example <u>Mozilla</u>

       GenericName=<u>Generic</u> <u>Name</u>
           A generic description of the application. For example <u>Web</u> <u>Browser</u>

       Comment=<u>Comment</u>
           Optional field to specify a tooltip for the application. For example <u>Visit</u> <u>websites</u> <u>on</u> <u>the</u> <u>Internet</u>

       Icon=<u>Icon</u> <u>File</u>
           The icon to use for the application. This can either be an absolute path to an image file or an
           icon-name. If an icon-name is provided an image lookup by name is done in the user's current icon
           theme. The <b>xdg-icon-resource</b> command can be used to install image files into icon themes. The
           advantage of using an icon-name instead of an absolute path is that with an icon-name the application
           icon can be provided in several different sizes as well as in several differently themed styles.

       Exec=<u>Command</u> <u>Line</u>
           The command line to start the application. If the application can open files the %f placeholder
           should be specified. When a file is dropped on the application launcher the %f is replaced with the
           file path of the dropped file. If multiple files can be specified on the command line the %F
           placeholder should be used instead of %f. If the application is able to open URLs in addition to
           local files then %u or %U can be used instead of %f or %F.

       Categories=<u>Categories</u>
           A list of categories separated by semi-colons. A category is a keyword that describes and classifies
           the application. By default applications are organized in the application menu based on category.
           When menu entries are explicitly assigned to a new submenu it is not necessary to list any
           categories.

           When using categories it is recommended to include one of the following categories: AudioVideo,
           Development, Education, Game, Graphics, Network, Office, Settings, System, Utility.

           See Appendix A of the XDG Desktop Menu Specification for information about additional categories:
           <b><a href="http://standards.freedesktop.org/menu-spec/menu-spec-1.0.html">http://standards.freedesktop.org/menu-spec/menu-spec-1.0.html</a>#category-registry</b>

       MimeType=<u>Mimetypes</u>
           A list of mimetypes separated by semi-colons. This field is used to indicate which file types the
           application is able to open.

       <b><a href="http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications/desktop-entry-spec">http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications/desktop-entry-spec</a></b>

</pre><h4><b>DIRECTORY</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       The appearance of submenu in the application menu is provided by a *.directory file. In particular it
       provides the title of the submenu and a possible icon. A *.directory file consists of a <u>[Desktop</u> <u>Entry]</u>
       header followed by several <u>Key</u>=<u>Value</u> lines.

       A *.directory file can provide a title (name) for the submenu in several different languages. This is
       done by adding a language code as used by LC_MESSAGES in square brackets behind the <u>Key</u>. This way one can
       specify different values for the same <u>Key</u> depending on the currently selected language.

       The following keys are relevant for submenus:

       Type=Directory
           This is a mandatory field that indicates that the *.directory file describes a submenu.

       Name=<u>Menu</u> <u>Name</u>
           The title of submenu. For example <u>Mozilla</u>

       Comment=<u>Comment</u>
           Optional field to specify a tooltip for the submenu.

       Icon=<u>Icon</u> <u>File</u>
           The icon to use for the submenu. This can either be an absolute path to an image file or an
           icon-name. If an icon-name is provided an image lookup by name is done in the user's current icon
           theme. The <b>xdg-icon-resource</b> command can be used to install image files into icon themes. The
           advantage of using an icon-name instead of an absolute path is that with an icon-name the submenu
           icon can be provided in several different sizes as well as in several differently themed styles.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       xdg-desktop-menu honours the following environment variables:

       XDG_UTILS_DEBUG_LEVEL
           Setting this environment variable to a non-zero numerical value makes xdg-desktop-menu do more
           verbose reporting on stderr. Setting a higher value increases the verbosity.

       XDG_UTILS_INSTALL_MODE
           This environment variable can be used by the user or administrator to override the installation mode.
           Valid values are <u>user</u> and <u>system</u>.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>CODES</b></h4><pre>
       An exit code of 0 indicates success while a non-zero exit code indicates failure. The following failure
       codes can be returned:

       <b>1</b>
           Error in command line syntax.

       <b>2</b>
           One of the files passed on the command line did not exist.

       <b>3</b>
           A required tool could not be found.

       <b>4</b>
           The action failed.

       <b>5</b>
           No permission to read one of the files passed on the command line.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       The company ShinyThings Inc. has developed an application named "WebMirror" and would like to add it to
       the application menu. The company will use "shinythings" as its vendor id. In order to add the
       application to the menu there needs to be a .desktop file with a suitable <u>Categories</u> entry:

           shinythings-webmirror.desktop:

             [Desktop Entry]
             Encoding=UTF-8
             Type=Application

             Exec=webmirror
             Icon=webmirror

             Name=WebMirror
             Name[nl]=WebSpiegel

             Categories=Network;WebDevelopment;

       Now the xdg-desktop-menu tool can be used to add the shinythings-webmirror.desktop file to the desktop
       application menu:

           xdg-desktop-menu install ./shinythings-webmirror.desktop

       Note that for the purpose of this example the menu items are available in two languages, English and
       Dutch. The language code for Dutch is nl.

       In the next example the company ShinyThings Inc. will add its own submenu to the desktop application menu
       consisting of a "WebMirror" menu item and a "WebMirror Admin Tool" menu item.

       First the company needs to create two .desktop files that describe the two menu items. Since the items
       are to be added to a new submenu it is not necessary to include a Categories= line:

           shinythings-webmirror.desktop:

             [Desktop Entry]
             Encoding=UTF-8
             Type=Application

             Exec=webmirror
             Icon=shinythings-webmirror

             Name=WebMirror
             Name[nl]=WebSpiegel

           shinythings-webmirror-admin.desktop:

             [Desktop Entry]
             Encoding=UTF-8
             Type=Application

             Exec=webmirror-admintool
             Icon=shinythings-webmirror-admintool

             Name=WebMirror Admin Tool
             Name[nl]=WebSpiegel Administratie Tool

       In addition a .directory file needs to be created to provide a title and icon for the sub-menu itself:

           shinythings-webmirror.directory:

             [Desktop Entry]
             Encoding=UTF-8

             Icon=shinythings-webmirror-menu

             Name=WebMirror
             Name[nl]=WebSpiegel

       These file can now be installed with:

           xdg-desktop-menu install ./shinythings-webmirror.directory \
                 ./shinythings-webmirror.desktop ./shinythings-webmirror-admin.desktop

       The menu entries could also be installed one by one:

           xdg-desktop-menu install --noupdate ./shinythings-webmirror.directory \
                 ./shinythings-webmirror.desktop
           xdg-desktop-menu install --noupdate ./shinythings-webmirror.directory \
                 ./shinythings-webmirror-admin.desktop
           xdg-desktop-menu forceupdate

       Although the result is the same it is slightly more efficient to install all files at the same time.

       The *.desktop and *.directory files reference icons with the names webmirror, webmirror-admin and
       webmirror-menu which should also be installed. In this example the icons are installed in two different
       sizes, once with a size of 22x22 pixels and once with a size of 64x64 pixels:

           xdg-icon-resource install --size 22 ./wmicon-22.png shinythings-webmirror
           xdg-icon-resource install --size 22 ./wmicon-menu-22.png shinythings-webmirror-menu
           xdg-icon-resource install --size 22 ./wmicon-admin-22.png shinythings-webmirror-admin
           xdg-icon-resource install --size 64 ./wmicon-64.png shinythings-webmirror
           xdg-icon-resource install --size 64 ./wmicon-menu-64.png shinythings-webmirror-menu
           xdg-icon-resource install --size 64 ./wmicon-admin-64.png shinythings-webmirror-admin
