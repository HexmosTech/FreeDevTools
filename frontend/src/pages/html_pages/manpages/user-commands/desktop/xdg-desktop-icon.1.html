</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       xdg-desktop-icon - command line tool for (un)installing icons to the desktop

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>

       <b>xdg-desktop-icon</b> install [<b>--novendor</b>] <u>FILE</u>

       <b>xdg-desktop-icon</b> uninstall <u>FILE</u>

       <b>xdg-desktop-icon</b> {<b>--help</b> | <b>--manual</b> | <b>--version</b>}

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The xdg-desktop-icon program can be used to install an application launcher or other file on the desktop
       of the current user.

       An application launcher is represented by a *.desktop file. Desktop files are defined by the
       freedesktop.org Desktop Entry Specification. The most important aspects of *.desktop files are summarized
       below.

</pre><h4><b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       install
           Installs <u>FILE</u> to the desktop of the current user.  <u>FILE</u> can be a *.desktop file or any other type of
           file.

       uninstall
           Removes <u>FILE</u> from the desktop of the current user.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--novendor</b>
           Normally, xdg-desktop-icon checks to ensure that a *.desktop file to be installed has a vendor
           prefix. This option can be used to disable that check.

           A vendor prefix consists of alpha characters ([a-zA-Z]) and is terminated with a dash ("-").
           Companies and organizations are encouraged to use a word or phrase, preferably the organizations
           name, for which they hold a trademark as their vendor prefix. The purpose of the vendor prefix is to
           prevent name conflicts.

       <b>--help</b>
           Show command synopsis.

       <b>--manual</b>
           Show this manual page.

       <b>--version</b>
           Show the xdg-utils version information.

</pre><h4><b>DESKTOP</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       An application launcher can be added to the desktop by installing a *.desktop file. A *.desktop file
       consists of a <u>[Desktop</u> <u>Entry]</u> header followed by several <u>Key</u>=<u>Value</u> lines.

       A *.desktop file can provide a name and description for an application in several different languages.
       This is done by adding a language code as used by LC_MESSAGES in square brackets behind the <u>Key</u>. This way
       one can specify different values for the same <u>Key</u> depending on the currently selected language.

       The following keys are often used:

       Type=Application
           This is a mandatory field that indicates that the *.desktop file describes an application launcher.

       Name=<u>Application</u> <u>Name</u>
           The name of the application. For example <u>Mozilla</u>

       GenericName=<u>Generic</u> <u>Name</u>
           A generic description of the application. For example <u>Web</u> <u>Browser</u>

       Comment=<u>Comment</u>
           Optional field to specify a tooltip for the application. For example <u>Visit</u> <u>websites</u> <u>on</u> <u>the</u> <u>Internet</u>

       Icon=<u>Icon</u> <u>File</u>
           The icon to use for the application. This can either be an absolute path to an image file or an
           icon-name. If an icon-name is provided an image lookup by name is done in the user's current icon
           theme. The <b>xdg-icon-resource</b> command can be used to install image files into icon themes. The
           advantage of using an icon-name instead of an absolute path is that with an icon-name the application
           icon can be provided in several different sizes as well as in several differently themed styles.

       Exec=<u>Command</u> <u>Line</u>
           The command line to start the application. If the application can open files the %f placeholder
           should be specified. When a file is dropped on the application launcher the %f is replaced with the
           file path of the dropped file. If multiple files can be specified on the command line the %F
           placeholder should be used instead of %f. If the application is able to open URLs in addition to
           local files then %u or %U can be used instead of %f or %F.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       xdg-desktop-icon honours the following environment variables:

       XDG_UTILS_DEBUG_LEVEL
           Setting this environment variable to a non-zero numerical value makes xdg-desktop-icon do more
           verbose reporting on stderr. Setting a higher value increases the verbosity.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>CODES</b></h4><pre>
       An exit code of 0 indicates success while a non-zero exit code indicates failure. The following failure
       codes can be returned:

       <b>1</b>
           Error in command line syntax.

       <b>2</b>
           One of the files passed on the command line did not exist.

       <b>3</b>
           A required tool could not be found.

       <b>4</b>
           The action failed.

       <b>5</b>
           No permission to read one of the files passed on the command line.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       The company ShinyThings Inc. has developed an application named "WebMirror" and would like to add a
       launcher for for on the desktop. The company will use "shinythings" as its vendor id. In order to add the
       application to the desktop there needs to be a .desktop file for the application:

           shinythings-webmirror.desktop:

             [Desktop Entry]
             Encoding=UTF-8
             Type=Application

             Exec=webmirror
             Icon=shinythings-webmirror

             Name=WebMirror
             Name[nl]=WebSpiegel

       Now the xdg-desktop-icon tool can be used to add the webmirror.desktop file to the desktop:

           xdg-desktop-icon install ./shinythings-webmirror.desktop

       To add a README file to the desktop as well, the following command can be used:

           xdg-desktop-icon install ./shinythings-README
