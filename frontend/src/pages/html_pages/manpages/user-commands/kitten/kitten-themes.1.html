       kitten-themes - Manage kitty color schemes easily

</pre><h4><b>Overview</b></h4><pre>
       The  themes  kitten  allows  you  to  easily change color themes, from a collection of over three hundred
       pre-built themes available at <u>kitty-themes</u>. To use it, simply run:

          kitten themes

       The kitten allows you to pick a theme, with live previews of the colors. You can choose between light and
       dark themes and search by theme name by just typing a few characters from the name.

       The kitten maintains a list of recently used themes to allow quick switching.

       If you want to restore the colors to default, you can do so by choosing the <b>Default</b> theme.

       Added in version 0.23.0: The themes kitten

</pre><h4><b>How</b> <b>it</b> <b>works</b></h4><pre>
       A theme in kitty is just a <b>.conf</b> file containing kitty settings.  When you select  a  theme,  the  kitten
       simply   copies   the   <b>.conf</b>   file  to  <b><a href="file:~/.config/kitty/current-theme.conf">~/.config/kitty/current-theme.conf</a></b>  and  adds  an  include  for
       <b>current-theme.conf</b> to <b>kitty.conf</b>. It also comments out any existing color settings in <b>kitty.conf</b> so  they
       do not interfere.

       Once that's done, the kitten sends kitty a signal to make it reload its config.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          If  you  want  to have some color settings in your <b>kitty.conf</b> that the theme kitten does not override,
          move them into a separate conf file and <b>include</b> it into kitty.conf. The include should be placed after
          the inclusion of <b>current-theme.conf</b> so that the settings in  it  override  conflicting  settings  from
          <b>current-theme.conf</b>.

</pre><h4><b>Change</b> <b>color</b> <b>themes</b> <b>automatically</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>os</b> <b>switches</b> <b>between</b> <b>light</b> <b>and</b> <b>dark</b></h4><pre>
       Added in version 0.38.0.

       You  can  have  kitty  automatically  change its color theme when the OS switches between dark, light and
       no-preference modes. In order to do this, run the theme kitten as normal and at the final  screen  select
       the  option  to  save  your  chosen  theme as either light, dark, or no-preference. Repeat until you have
       chosen a theme for each of the three modes. Then, once you restart kitty, it will automatically use  your
       chosen themes depending on the OS color scheme.

       This    works    by    creating    three    files:    <b>dark-theme.auto.conf</b>,   <b>light-theme.auto.conf</b>   and
       <b>no-preference-theme.auto.conf</b> in the kitty config directory. When these files exist, kitty queries the OS
       for its color scheme and uses the appropriate file. Note that the colors  in  these  files  override  all
       other  colors,  even  those  specified  using  the  <u>kitty</u>  <u>--override</u> command line flag.  kitty will also
       automatically change colors when the OS color scheme changes, for example, during night/day transitions.

       When using these colors, you can still dynamically change colors, but the next time the  OS  changes  its
       color mode, any dynamic changes will be overridden.

</pre><h4><b>Using</b> <b>your</b> <b>own</b> <b>themes</b></h4><pre>
       You  can  also  create  your own themes as <b>.conf</b> files. Put them in the <b>themes</b> sub-directory of the <u>kitty</u>
       <u>config</u> <u>directory</u>, usually, <b><a href="file:~/.config/kitty/themes">~/.config/kitty/themes</a></b>. The kitten will automatically add them to the list  of
       themes.  You  can  use  this  to  modify  the builtin themes, by giving the conf file the name <b>Some</b> <b>theme</b>
       <b>name.conf</b> to override the builtin theme of that name. Here, <b>Some</b> <b>theme</b> <b>name</b> is the actual  builtin  theme
       name,  not  its file name. Note that after doing so you have to run the kitten and choose that theme once
       for your changes to be applied.

</pre><h4><b>Contributing</b> <b>new</b> <b>themes</b></h4><pre>
       If you wish to contribute a new theme to the kitty theme repository, start by going to  the  <u>kitty-themes</u>
       repository.  <u>Fork</u> <u>it</u>, and use the file <b>template.conf</b> as a template when creating your theme. Once you are
       satisfied with how it looks, <u>submit</u> <u>a</u> <u>pull</u> <u>request</u> to  have  your  theme  merged  into  the  <u>kitty-themes</u>
       repository, which will make it available in this kitten automatically.

</pre><h4><b>Changing</b> <b>the</b> <b>theme</b> <b>non-interactively</b></h4><pre>
       You  can  specify  the theme name as an argument when invoking the kitten to have it change to that theme
       instantly. For example:

          kitten themes --reload-in=all Dimmed Monokai

       Will change the theme to <b>Dimmed</b> <b>Monokai</b> in all running kitty instances. See below  for  more  details  on
       non-interactive operation.

</pre><h4><b>Source</b> <b>code</b> <b>for</b> <b>themes</b></h4><pre>
       The source code for this kitten is <u>available</u> <u>on</u> <u>GitHub</u>.

</pre><h4><b>Command</b> <b>line</b> <b>interface</b></h4><pre>
          kitten themes [options] [theme name to switch to]

       Change  the  kitty  theme.  If no theme name is supplied, run interactively, otherwise change the current
       theme to the specified theme name.

   <b>Options</b>
       <b>--cache-age</b> <b>&lt;CACHE_AGE&gt;</b>
              Check for new themes only after the specified number of days. A value of zero  will  always  check
              for  new  themes.  A negative value will never check for new themes, instead raising an error if a
              local copy of the themes is not available.  Default: <b>1</b>

       <b>--reload-in</b> <b>&lt;RELOAD_IN&gt;</b>
              By default, this kitten will signal only the parent kitty instance it is running in to reload  its
              config, after making changes. Use this option to instead either not reload the config at all or in
              all running kitty instances.  Default: <b>parent</b> Choices: <b>all</b>, <b>none</b>, <b>parent</b>

       <b>--dump-theme</b>
              When running non-interactively, dump the specified theme to STDOUT instead of changing kitty.conf.
              Default: <b>false</b>

       <b>--config-file-name</b> <b>&lt;CONFIG_FILE_NAME&gt;</b>
              The  name  or  path to the config file to edit. Relative paths are interpreted with respect to the
              kitty config directory. By default the kitty config file,  kitty.conf  is  edited.  This  is  most
              useful  if you add <b>include</b> <b>themes.conf</b> to your kitty.conf and then have the kitten operate only on
              <b>themes.conf</b>, allowing <b>kitty.conf</b> to remain unchanged.  Default: <b>kitty.conf</b>
