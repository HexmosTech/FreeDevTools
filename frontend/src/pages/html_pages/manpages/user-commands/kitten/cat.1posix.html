</pre><h4><b>PROLOG</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       cat — concatenate and print files

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       cat <b>[</b>-u<b>]</b> <b>[</b><u>file</u>...<b>]</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>cat</u> utility shall read files in sequence and shall write their contents to the standard output in the
       same sequence.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>cat</u>  utility  shall  conform  to  the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <u>Section</u> <u>12.2</u>, <u>Utility</u>
       <u>Syntax</u> <u>Guidelines</u>.

       The following option shall be supported:

       <b>-u</b>        Write bytes from the input file to the standard output without delay as each is read.

</pre><h4><b>OPERANDS</b></h4><pre>
       The following operand shall be supported:

       <u>file</u>      A pathname of an input file. If no <u>file</u> operands are specified, the  standard  input  shall  be
                 used. If a <u>file</u> is <b>'-'</b>, the <u>cat</u> utility shall read from the standard input at that point in the
                 sequence.  The  <u>cat</u>  utility shall not close and reopen standard input when it is referenced in
                 this way, but shall accept multiple occurrences of <b>'-'</b> as a <u>file</u> operand.

</pre><h4><b>STDIN</b></h4><pre>
       The standard input shall be used only if no <u>file</u> operands are specified, or if a  <u>file</u>  operand  is  <b>'-'</b>.
       See the INPUT FILES section.

</pre><h4><b>INPUT</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       The input files can be any file type.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of <u>cat</u>:

       <u>LANG</u>      Provide a default value for the internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See the
                 Base  Definitions  volume  of POSIX.1‐2017, <u>Section</u> <u>8.2</u>, <u>Internationalization</u> <u>Variables</u> for the
                 precedence  of  internationalization  variables  used  to  determine  the  values   of   locale
                 categories.)

       <u>LC_ALL</u>    If  set  to a non-empty string value, override the values of all the other internationalization
                 variables.

       <u>LC_CTYPE</u>  Determine the locale for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of text  data  as  characters
                 (for example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments).

       <u>LC_MESSAGES</u>
                 Determine  the  locale  that  should  be  used  to affect the format and contents of diagnostic
                 messages written to standard error.

       <u>NLSPATH</u>   Determine the location of message catalogs for the processing of <u>LC_MESSAGES</u>.

</pre><h4><b>ASYNCHRONOUS</b> <b>EVENTS</b></h4><pre>
       Default.

</pre><h4><b>STDOUT</b></h4><pre>
       The standard output shall contain the sequence of bytes read from the input files. Nothing else shall  be
       written to the standard output.  If the standard output is a regular file, and is the same file as any of
       the input file operands, the implementation may treat this as an error.

</pre><h4><b>STDERR</b></h4><pre>
       The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.

</pre><h4><b>OUTPUT</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>EXTENDED</b> <b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       The following exit values shall be returned:

        0    All input files were output successfully.

       &gt;0    An error occurred.

</pre><h4><b>CONSEQUENCES</b> <b>OF</b> <b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       Default.

       <u>The</u> <u>following</u> <u>sections</u> <u>are</u> <u>informative.</u>

</pre><h4><b>APPLICATION</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>-u</b>  option  has  value  in  prototyping  non-blocking reads from FIFOs. The intent is to support the
       following sequence:

           mkfifo foo
           cat -u foo &gt; /dev/tty13 &amp;
           cat -u &gt; foo

       It is unspecified whether standard output is or is not buffered in the default case. This is sometimes of
       interest when standard output is associated with a terminal, since buffering may delay  the  output.  The
       presence  of  the  <b>-u</b>  option  guarantees  that unbuffered I/O is available. It is implementation-defined
       whether the <u>cat</u> utility buffers output if the <b>-u</b> option is not specified. Traditionally, the <b>-u</b> option is
       implemented using the equivalent of the <u>setvbuf</u>() function defined in the  System  Interfaces  volume  of
       POSIX.1‐2017.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       The following command:

           cat myfile

       writes the contents of the file <b>myfile</b> to standard output.

       The following command:

           cat doc1 doc2 &gt; doc.all

       concatenates the files <b>doc1</b> and <b>doc2</b> and writes the result to <b>doc.all</b>.

       Because of the shell language mechanism used to perform output redirection, a command such as this:

           cat doc doc.end &gt; doc

       causes the original data in <b>doc</b> to be lost before <u>cat</u> even begins execution. This is true whether the <u>cat</u>
       command  fails  with an error or silently succeeds (the specification allows both behaviors). In order to
       append the contents of <b>doc.end</b> without losing the original contents of <b>doc</b>, this command should  be  used
       instead:

           cat doc.end &gt;&gt; doc

       The command:

           cat start - middle - end &gt; file

       when  standard  input  is  a terminal, gets two arbitrary pieces of input from the terminal with a single
       invocation of <u>cat</u>.  Note, however, that if standard input is a regular file, this would be equivalent  to
       the command:

           cat start - middle /dev/null end &gt; file

       because  the  entire  contents of the file would be consumed by <u>cat</u> the first time <b>'-'</b> was used as a <u>file</u>
       operand and an end-of-file condition would be detected immediately when <b>'-'</b>  was  referenced  the  second
       time.

</pre><h4><b>RATIONALE</b></h4><pre>
       Historical  versions  of  the  <u>cat</u>  utility  include the <b>-e</b>, <b>-t</b>, and <b>-v</b>, options which permit the ends of
       lines, &lt;tab&gt; characters, and invisible characters, respectively, to be rendered visible  in  the  output.
       The standard developers omitted these options because they provide too fine a degree of control over what
       is made visible, and similar output can be obtained using a command such as:

           sed -n l pathname

       The  latter  also  has the advantage that its output is unambiguous, whereas the output of historical <u>cat</u>
       <b>-etv</b> is not.

       The <b>-s</b> option was omitted because it corresponds  to  different  functions  in  BSD  and  System  V-based
       systems.  The  BSD  <b>-s</b> option to squeeze blank lines can be accomplished by the shell script shown in the
       following example:

           sed -n '
           # Write non-empty lines.
           <a href="file:/./">/./</a>   {
                 p
                 d
                 }
           # Write a single empty line, then look for more empty lines.
           /^$/  p
           # Get next line, discard the held &lt;newline&gt; (empty line),
           # and look for more empty lines.
           :Empty
           /^$/  {
                 N
                 s/.//
                 b Empty
                 }
           # Write the non-empty line before going back to search
           # for the first in a set of empty lines.
                 p
           '

       The System V <b>-s</b> option to silence error messages can be accomplished by redirecting the  standard  error.
       Note  that  the  BSD  documentation  for  <u>cat</u>  uses the term ``blank line'' to mean the same as the POSIX
       ``empty line'': a line consisting only of a &lt;newline&gt;.

       The BSD <b>-n</b> option was omitted because similar functionality can be obtained from the <b>-n</b> option of the  <u>pr</u>
       utility.
