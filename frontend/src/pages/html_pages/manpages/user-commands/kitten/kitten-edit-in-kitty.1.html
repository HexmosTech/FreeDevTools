</pre><h4><b>Options</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--title,</b> <b>--window-title</b>
              The  title  to  set  for the new window. By default, title is controlled by the child process. The
              special value current will copy the title from the currently active window.

       <b>--tab-title</b>
              The title for the new tab if launching in a new tab. By default, the title of the active window in
              the tab is used as the tab title. The special value current will copy the title from the title  of
              the currently active tab.

       <b>--type</b> <u>[=window]</u>
              Where to launch the child process:

              window
                  A new kitty window in the current tab

              tab
                  A new tab in the current OS window

              os-window
                  A new operating system window

              overlay
                  An overlay window covering the current active kitty window

              overlay-main
                  An  overlay  window  covering  the current active kitty window. Unlike a plain overlay window,
              this window is considered as a main window which means it is used as the active window for getting
              the current working directory, the input text for kittens, launch commands, etc.  Useful  if  this
              overlay is intended to run for a long time as a primary window.

              background
                  The   process  will  be  run  in  the  background,  without  a  kitty  window.  Note  that  if
              <b>--allow-remote-control</b> <b>is</b> <b>specified</b> <b>the</b> <b>KITTY_LISTEN_ON</b> <b>environment</b> <b>variable</b>  <b>will</b>  <b>be</b>  <b>set</b>  <b>to</b>  <b>a</b>
              <b>dedicated</b> <b>socket</b> <b>pair</b> <b>file</b> <b>descriptor</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>process</b> <b>can</b> <b>use</b> <b>for</b> <b>remote</b> <b>control.</b>

              clipboard, primary
                  These  two  are  meant  to  work  with  <b>--stdin-source</b> <b>to</b> <b>copy</b> <b>data</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>clipboard</b> <b>or</b>
              <b>primary</b> <b>selection.</b>

              Choices: window, background, clipboard, os-window, overlay, overlay-main, primary, tab

       <b>--dont-take-focus,</b> <b>--keep-focus</b>
              Keep the focus on the currently active window instead of switching to the newly opened window.

       <b>--cwd</b>  The working directory for the newly launched child. Use the  special  value  current  to  use  the
              working  directory  of  the currently active window. The special value last_reported uses the last
              working directory reported by the shell (needs  shell_integration  to  work).  The  special  value
              oldest  works  like  current  but  uses  the  working  directory  of the oldest foreground process
              associated with the currently active window rather than the newest  foreground  process.  Finally,
              the  special  value  root  refers  to  the process that was originally started when the window was
              created.

       <b>--env</b>  Environment variables to set in the  child  process.  Can  be  specified  multiple  times  to  set
              different environment variables. Syntax: name=value. Using name= will set to empty string and just
              name will remove the environment variable.

       <b>--var</b>  User variables to set in the created window. Can be specified multiple times to set different user
              variables. Syntax: name=value. Using name= will set to empty string.

       <b>--hold</b> Keep the window open even after the command being executed exits, at a shell prompt.

       <b>--location</b> <u>[=default]</u>
              Where  to  place  the  newly  created  window when it is added to a tab which already has existing
              windows in it. after and before place the new window before or after the active  window.  neighbor
              is  a  synonym  for after. Also applies to creating a new tab, where the value of after will cause
              the new tab to be placed next to the current tab instead of at the  end.  The  values  of  vsplit,
              hsplit  and  split are only used by the splits layout and control if the new window is placed in a
              vertical, horizontal or automatic split with the currently active window. The default is to  place
              the window in a layout dependent manner, typically, after the currently active window.

              Choices: default, after, before, first, hsplit, last, neighbor, split, vsplit

       <b>--os-window-class</b>
              Set  the WM_CLASS property on X11 and the application id property on Wayland for the newly created
              OS window when using <b>--type.</b> <b>Defaults</b> <b>to</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>is</b> <b>used</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>parent</b> <b>kitty</b>  <b>process,</b>  <b>which</b>  <b>in</b>
              <b>turn</b> <b>defaults</b> <b>to</b> <b>kitty.</b>

       <b>--os-window-name</b>
              Set  the  WM_NAME  property  on X11 for the newly created OS Window when using <b>--type.</b> <b>Defaults</b> <b>to</b>
              <b>--os-window-class.</b>

       <b>--os-window-title</b>
              Set the title for the newly created OS window. This title will override any titles set by programs
              running in kitty. The special value current will use the title of the current OS window, if any.

       <b>--os-window-state</b> <u>[=normal]</u>
              The initial state for the newly created OS Window.

              Choices: normal, fullscreen, maximized, minimized

       <b>--logo</b> Path to a PNG image to use as the  logo  for  the  newly  created  window.  See  <b>window_logo_path.</b>
              <b>Relative</b> <b>paths</b> <b>are</b> <b>resolved</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitty</b> <b>configuration</b> <b>directory.</b>

       <b>--logo-position</b>
              The   position   for   the   window   logo.   Only  takes  effect  if  <b>--logo</b>  <b>is</b>  <b>specified.</b>  <b>See</b>
              <b>window_logo_position.</b>

       <b>--logo-alpha</b> <u>[=-1]</u>
              The amount the window logo should be faded into the background. Only takes  effect  if  <b>--logo</b>  <b>is</b>
              <b>specified.</b> <b>See</b> <b>window_logo_alpha.</b>

       <b>--color</b>
              Change colors in the newly launched window. You can either specify a path to a <u>.conf</u> <u>file</u> <u>with</u> <u>the</u>
              <u>same</u> <u>syntax</u> <u>as</u> <u>kitty.conf</u> <u>to</u> <u>read</u> <u>the</u> <u>colors</u> <u>from,</u> <u>or</u> <u>specify</u> <u>them</u> <u>individually,</u> <u>for</u> <u>example::</u>

                  --color background=white --color foreground=red

       <b>--spacing</b>
              Set the margin and padding for the newly created window. For example: margin=20 or padding-left=10
              or  margin-h=30.  The  shorthand form sets all values, the *-h and *-v variants set horizontal and
              vertical values. Can be specified multiple times. Note that this is ignored for overlay windows as
              these use the settings from the base window.

       <b>--max-file-size</b> <u>[=8]</u>
              The maximum allowed size (in MB) of files to edit. Since the file data has to  be  base64  encoded
              and transmitted over the tty device, overly large files will not perform well.

       <b>--help,</b> <b>-h</b>
              Show help for this command
