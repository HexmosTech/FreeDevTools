</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       namecheck - Check project names are not already taken.

</pre><h4><b>ABOUT</b></h4><pre>
       This is a simple tool to automate the testing of project names at the most common Open Source / Free
       Software hosting environments.

       Each new project requires a name, and those names are ideally unique.  To come up with names is hard, and
       testing to ensure they're not already in use is time-consuming - unless you have a tool such as this one.

</pre><h4><b>CUSTOMIZATION</b></h4><pre>
       The script, as is, contains a list of sites, and patterns, to test against.

       If those patterns aren't sufficient then you may create your own additions and add them to the script.
       If you wish to have your own version of the patterns you may save them into the file <a href="file:~/.namecheckrc">~/.namecheckrc</a>
