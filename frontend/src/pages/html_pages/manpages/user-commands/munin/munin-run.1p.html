</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       munin-run - A program to run Munin plugins from the command line

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       munin-run [options] &lt;plugin&gt; [ config | autoconf | snmpconf | suggest ]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       munin-run is a script to run Munin plugins from the command-line.  It's useful when debugging plugins, as
       they are run in the same conditions as they are under munin-node.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--config</b> <b>&lt;configfile&gt;</b>
            Use &lt;file&gt; as configuration file. [/etc/munin/munin-node.conf]

       <b>--servicedir</b> <b>&lt;dir&gt;</b>
            Use &lt;dir&gt; as plugin dir. [/etc/munin/plugins/]

       <b>--sconfdir</b> <b>&lt;dir&gt;</b>
            Use &lt;dir&gt; as plugin configuration dir. [/etc/munin/plugin-conf.d/]

       <b>--sconffile</b> <b>&lt;file&gt;</b>
            Use &lt;file&gt; as plugin configuration. Overrides sconfdir.  [undefined]

       <b>--paranoia</b>
            Only run plugins owned by root and check permissions.  [disabled]

       <b>--ignore-systemd-properties</b>
            Do  not try to detect and enforce the locally configured hardening flags of the "munin-node" service
            unit. This detection is skipped, if systemd is not enabled.  The hardening flags may  cause  subtile
            surprises.  For example "ProtectHome=yes" prevents the "df" plugin from determining the state of the
            "home" partition.  [disabled]

       <b>--help</b>
            View this help message.

       <b>--debug</b>
            Print  debug  messages.   Debug messages are sent to STDOUT and are prefixed with "#" (this makes it
            easier for other parts of munin to use munin-run and still have --debug  on).   Only  errors  go  to
            STDERR.

       <b>--pidebug</b>
            Plugin  debug.  Sets the environment variable MUNIN_DEBUG to 1 so that plugins may enable debugging.
            [disabled]

       <b>--version</b>
            Show version information.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>SYSTEMD</b> <b>USERS</b></h4><pre>
       The "munin-node" service is usually started by  systemd  via  a  "munin-node.service"  definition.   Some
       distributions  enable  hardening  settings  in  this service file in order to restrict the allowed set of
       activities for the "munin-node" process.  This may cause surprising differences  between  the  result  of
       "munin-run" and the real "munin-node" service.

       A  popular  example  of such a surprising restriction is "ProtectHome=yes" combined with the "df" plugin.
       The restriction silently prevents the plugin from determining the status of mountpoints below /home.

       "munin-run" tries to mimic this behavior of "munin-node" automatically.  Thus the execution of "munin-run
       df" should provide the same output as "echo fetch df | nc localhost munin".

       If you want to debug potential issues of systemd restrictions, then you may want to  use  the  parameters
       "--ignore-systemd-properties" and "--debug".  Permanent overrides of systemd properties can be configured
       locally  via  "systemctl  edit  munin-node".   See  "man systemd.exec" for the documentation of systemd's
       properties.
