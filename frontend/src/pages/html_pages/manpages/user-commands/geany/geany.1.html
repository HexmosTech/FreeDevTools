       Geany — a small and lightweight IDE

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>geany</b> [<b>option</b>]  [<b>+number</b>]  [<b>files</b> <b>...</b>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Geany is a small and fast editor with basic features of an integrated development environment.

       Some  of  its  features:  syntax  highlighting,  code completion, code folding, symbol/tag lists and many
       supported filetypes like C(++), Java, PHP, HTML, DocBook, Perl and more.

       Homepage: https://www.geany.org/

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
           <b>files</b> <b>...</b>
                 A space-separated list of filenames. Absolute and relative filenames can be  used.  Geany  also
                 recognises  line and column information when appended to the filename with colons, e.g.  "geany
                 foo.bar:10:5" will open the file foo.bar and place the cursor in line 10 at column 5.

                 Projects can also be opened but a project file (*.geany) must be the first non-option argument.
                 All additionally given files are ignored.

           <b>+number</b>
                 Set initial line <u>number</u> for the first opened file (same as --line, do not put a  space  between
                 the  +  sign  and the number). E.g. "geany +7 foo.bar" will open the file foo.bar and place the
                 cursor in line 7.

           <b>--column</b>
                 Set initial column number for the first opened file (useful in conjunction with --line).

       <b>-c</b>, <b>--config</b>
                 Use an alternate configuration directory. Default configuration directory  is  <a href="file:~/.config/geany/">~/.config/geany/</a>
                 and there resides geany.conf and some template files.

           <b>--ft-names</b>
                 Print a list of Geany's internal filetype names (useful snippets configuration).

       <b>-g</b>, <b>--generate-tags</b>
                 Generate a global tags file (see documentation).

       <b>-P</b>, <b>--no-preprocessing</b>
                 Don't preprocess C/C++ files when generating tags.

       <b>-i</b>, <b>--new-instance</b>
                 Don't  open files in a running instance, force opening a new instance.  Only available if Geany
                 was compiled with support for Sockets.

       <b>-l</b>, <b>--line</b>
                 Set initial line number for the first opened file.

           <b>--list-documents</b>
                 Return a list of open documents in a running Geany instance.  This can  be  used  to  read  the
                 currently  opened  documents  in  Geany  from  an external script or tool. The returned list is
                 separated by newlines (LF) and consists of the full, UTF-8 encoded filenames of the  documents.
                 Only available if Geany was compiled with support for Sockets.

       <b>-m</b>, <b>--no-msgwin</b>
                 Don't  show  the  message  window.  Use  this option if you don't need compiler messages or VTE
                 support.

       <b>-n</b>, <b>--no-ctags</b>
                 Don't load symbol completion and call tip data. Use this option, if you don't want to use them.
                 For more information please see documentation.

       <b>-p</b>, <b>--no-plugins</b>
                 Don't load plugin support.

           <b>--print-prefix</b>
                 Print installation prefix, the data directory, the lib directory and the locale  directory  (in
                 this  order)  to  stdout,  each  per line. This is mainly intended for plugin authors to detect
                 installation paths.

       <b>-r</b>, <b>--read-only</b>
                 Open all files given on the command line in read-only mode. This only applies to  files  opened
                 explicitly  from  the  command  line,  so  files  from  previous  sessions or project files are
                 unaffected.

       <b>-s</b>, <b>--no-session</b>
                 Don't load the previous session's files.

       <b>-t</b>, <b>--no-terminal</b>
                 Don't load terminal support. Use this option, if you don't want to load  the  virtual  terminal
                 emulator  widget  at startup. If you don't have libvte.so.4 installed, then terminal-support is
                 automatically disabled. Only available if Geany was compiled with support for VTE.

           <b>--socket-file</b>
                 Use this socket filename for communication with a running Geany instance

           <b>--vte-lib</b>
                 Specify explicitly the path including filename or only the filename to the  VTE  library,  e.g.
                 /usr/lib/libvte.so  or  libvte.so.  This  option is only needed, when the autodetection doesn't
                 work. Only available if Geany was compiled with support for VTE.

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b>
                 Be verbose (print useful status messages).

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--version</b>
                 Show version information and exit.

       <b>-?</b>, <b>--help</b>
                 Show help information and exit.

       Geany supports all generic GTK options, a list is available on the help screen.
