</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       <b>wmpinboard</b> - a <b>Window</b> <b>Maker</b> dock app resembling a miniature pinboard

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         wmpinboard [options]

       <b>What</b> <b>wmpinboard</b> <b>is</b>

       <b>wmpinboard</b>  is  a  <b>Window</b>  <b>Maker</b>  dock applet resembling a miniature pinboard.  It's intended to somewhat
       relieve heavily littered desktops by allowing you to place reminders on a  graphical  on-screen  pinboard
       rather  than  producing  a mess of real notes all around your keyboard (thus being environmentally A Good
       Thing, too <b>;-)</b> ).  It supports arbitrary 6x10 X fonts and has XLocale  support,  enabling  you  to  enter
       locale-dependent  special characters if set up appropriately.  Besides text, you can add small monochrome
       sketches to your notes or simply encircle or underline words as a means of emphasis, and  alarms  can  be
       set  to  explicitly remind you of things.  Above all, <b>wmpinboard</b> is animated in redundant ways to make it
       look even more attractive, and themeability provides for a way of adapting its appearance to that of  the
       rest of your desktop.

       <b>What</b> <b>wmpinboard</b> <b>ISN'T</b>

       Clearly,  <b>wmpinboard</b>  doesn't allow you to keep an unlimited number of notes holding arbitrary amounts of
       information, and that's not what it's meant to do.  Just as real notes offer limited space, so  do  those
       simulated  by <b>wmpinboard</b>.  Besides, as a dock applet, it aims at being small and neat and yet useful in a
       way, and that's what it is, too, or considered to be by some people, anyway.  If you need room  for  more
       comprehensive  reminders,  use another program, either additionally or exclusively.  There's a variety of
       such out there, but their niche is different from that which <b>wmpinboard</b> claims.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>wmpinboard</b>'s command-line options can be roughly divided into four groups: configuration directives, run-
       time options, command-line actions, and general options.  Generally, <b>wmpinboard</b> supports  GNU-style  long
       options (which may be abbreviated unambiguously) as well as short ones for parameters used more commonly.

       <b>Configuration</b> <b>directives</b>

       This  type  of command-line options changes some aspect of <b>wmpinboard</b>'s configuration that is saved along
       with the data and thus set in a more permanent way.  Only one such parameter may be specified  per  call,
       and there mustn't be another instance running.

       <b>`--font=FONT'</b>
         Makes  <b>wmpinboard</b>  use  the  specified font; <b>`FONT'</b> can be one of the shortcuts listed when running the
         program with "<b>`--help'</b>" as a parameter, or a complete X descriptor of a  fixed  size  6x10  font.   The
         pinboard <u>must</u> <u>be</u> <u>empty</u> in order for this option to be applicable.  For more details, see the section on
         "FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS".

       <b>`--theme=FILE'</b>
         Configures  <b>wmpinboard</b> to load the specified theme when started interactively the next time.  <b>`FILE'</b> is
         the location of a <b>wmpinboard</b> theme file (typically with a file name extension of  <u>.wmpbtheme</u>).   If  it
         can't  be loaded when run interactively, the program will revert to its default theme.  If <b>`FILE'</b> is an
         empty string or "default", the use of a custom theme will be deactivated.

         Themes affect <b>wmpinboard</b>'s appearance, in particular, its pinboard, edit mode and alarm panel  pixmaps,
         the  latter's  digits,  and  possibly the location of the pinboard mode label area (via which notes are
         created).  For downloading themes, or if you're inclined to create one yourself and need  instructions,
         check  out  the  program's home page (see the section on "AUTHOR" or <b>wmpinboard</b>'s "<b>`--help'</b>" output for
         the URL).  The themes kit containing instructions  and  samples  on  how  to  create  theme  files  for
         <b>wmpinboard</b> that can be downloaded there is also included with the source package of the program.

       <b>`--alarm-cmd=CMD'</b>
         Configures <b>`CMD'</b> as the command to be executed on alarms.  E.g., you could use "`xkbbell'" to cause the
         program  to  beep  on  such  occassions, or make it run some sound-playing program.  To reset the alarm
         command to none, make <b>`CMD'</b> a zero-length string.

       <b>Run-time</b> <b>options</b>

       <b>`-d</b> <b>DISPLAY'</b> or <b>`--display=DISPLAY'</b>
         Uses the specified X display rather than the default one.

       <b>`-c'</b> or <b>`--click-to-focus'</b>
         This turns on some emulation of a click-based keyboard focus mode. See the section on "FREQUENTLY ASKED
         QUESTIONS".

       <b>`-t</b> <b>TIME'</b> or <b>`--timeout=TIME'</b>
         Sets the edit mode timeout (i.e., the number of seconds of idleness after which edit mode is terminated
         automatically) to <b>`TIME'</b> seconds.  The compile-time default is 60s, but this may have been changed  for
         your  particular  build;  run with <b>`-v'</b> if in doubt to check that.  Specifying a value of 0 (zero) will
         disable the timeout.

       <b>`-n'</b> or <b>`--normal-state'</b>
         Forces <b>wmpinboard</b> to run in so-called NormalState, which is preferred by <b>AfterStep</b>'s <b>Wharf</b>.

       <b>`-w'</b> or <b>`--withdrawn-state'</b>
         Forces the program to run in so-called WithdrawnState, as desired  by  the  <b>Window</b>  <b>Maker</b>  dock.   This
         option  and  the  previous  one are mutually exclusive.  Note also that <b>wmpinboard</b> tries to auto-detect
         whether <b>Window</b> <b>Maker</b> is running and sets itself up accordingly.  Using <b>`-n'</b>  or  <b>`-w'</b>  should  only  be
         necessary in case those heuristics fail on your system for some reason or other.

       <b>`--light'</b>
         Use this switch to suppress animations.

       <b>Command-line</b> <b>actions</b>

       Even  though  <b>wmpinboard</b> is by design an interactive application, there may be occasions when it comes in
       handy to be able to access/manipulate notes from the command line.  That's why the program offers  a  set
       of  command-line  options  allowing  for basic operations of that kind.  Still, it should be kept in mind
       that <b>wmpinboard</b> is primarily meant to be used interactively.

       All of the options below will, if an interactive instance of <b>wmpinboard</b> is  running  in  the  background,
       cause  that  to  save  its  data  (and  quit <u>edit</u> <u>mode</u>, if necessary), and if any changes are made by the
       respective option, the interactive instance will then be signalled to re-read the data file.  Even though
       the implemented methods of inter-process communication should generally be sufficiently safe with respect
       to avoiding data file corruption, it's in theory possible to undermine the concept and cause damage  that
       way--yet this won't happen unless you deliberately take pains to achieve the goal.  Generally, everything
       should  work  fine  as  long  as  you  don't try running multiple non-interactive instances of <b>wmpinboard</b>
       simultaneously.

       Only one of the below actions can be specified per call to <b>wmpinboard</b>.

       <b>`--dump'</b>
         This dumps the contents of all notes, replacing line breaks by spaces (unless preceded by a hyphen) and
         shortening sequences of blanks.  The list of dumped strings will be sorted by color groups.  If you use
         special characters in your notes, make sure your terminal's running with  the  same  character  set  as
         <b>wmpinboard</b>, or what you'll see might have a garbage-like quality.

         Each  line  of  output represents one note and is prefixed by the internal number <u>currently</u> identifying
         the respective note and, if an alarm is configured for the respective note, time and date (or "daily").

       <b>`--dump-raw'</b>
         Unlike the "cooked" dump described above, this just  dumps  the  raw  contents  of  all  notes  without
         applying any kind of formatting.  May come in handy if your notes happen to contain E-mail addresses or
         other things for which lines 10 characters wide are too narrow.

       <b>`--del=NUMBER'</b>
         This  option  will  remove  the  note  identified  by <b>`NUMBER'</b> from the pinboard.  <b>`NUMBER'</b> is a number
         determined by the output of either dump option, which should be consulted right before using this  one,
         since note numbers may change when notes are moved around on the board or others are removed.

       <b>`--add=STRING'</b>
         When run with this option, <b>wmpinboard</b> will add a new note (provided the maximal number of notes has not
         yet  been reached) at a random position on the board, with contents <b>`STRING'</b>, word-wrapping the text at
         the end of the note's lines where necessary (after white space and hyphens).  If due to this  wrapping,
         the entire string cannot be stored on the note, the remainder will be discarded silently.

         In  order  to create a note with a certain color, the string can be prefixed by a color code specifying
         the group of colors which a random color is to be selected from  (code  letters  are  recognized  case-
         insensitively):

           %G - green
           %Y - yellow/white
           %R - reddish
           %B - blue

         Alternatively  or  additionally,  you  may  specify  a  position code as "%1" through "%9", defining an
         approximate position on the board where the note is to be placed.  Each of the nine figures corresponds
         to a ninth of the board with its index assigned in accordance with the layout  of  your  keypad  (i.e.,
         "%1" meaning lower left, "%9" upper right corner, and so forth).

         Thus,

           wmpinboard --add '%g%5test'

         will place a green note saying "test" at the center of the board.

         (Note:  The  "%"  character  can  be  escaped  by a second one if you want to add an un-prefixed string
         starting with a percent character.)

       <b>`--add-raw=STRING'</b>
         Via this option, a new note can be added from the command line (provided that  this  won't  exceed  the
         maximum number of notes).  <b>`STRING'</b> specifies the <u>raw</u> contents of the note, as printed by <b>`--dump-raw'</b>.
         The same set of color group and position codes as for the previous option applies.

       <b>General</b> <b>options</b>

       <b>`-h'</b> or <b>`--help'</b>
         This prints a help screen listing command line options together with brief descriptions.

       <b>`-i'</b> or <b>`--info'</b>
         Prints  information  about the current user configuration (font, theme, alarm command) and some useless
         statistics.

       <b>`-v'</b> or <b>`--version'</b>
         This prints some more detailed version information, in particular,  which  compile-time  settings  this
         binary was built with.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>wmpinboard</b>  operates  in  basically  two  different  modes,  namely,  the  <u>pinboard</u>  <u>view</u>  and <u>edit</u> <u>mode</u>.
       Furthermore, a <u>panel</u> of buttons granting access to extended options can be popped up in <u>edit</u> <u>mode</u>,  which
       in turn allows you to display the <u>alarm</u> <u>panel</u> to configure alarm settings for the current note.

       <b>Pinboard</b> <b>view</b>

       This  is  <b>wmpinboard</b>'s  normal mode of operation.  A potentially chaotic arrangement of tiny squares on a
       beige-colored oblong (default theme) is meant to resemble notes pinned to a cork board.  Possible actions
       include:

       • <u>Add</u> a note, by left-clicking on the board's "TO DO" label.  This creates a new, blank, randomly-colored
         note at a random position on the board and puts <b>wmpinboard</b> in <u>edit</u> <u>mode</u> (see below).  If you prefer  to
         place a new note at a certain position before being prompted to enter its contents, this can be done by
         moving the mouse cursor after having clicked on the label.  This will realize the note and allow you to
         drag  it  to a position of your choice.  <b>wmpinboard</b> will switch to <u>edit</u> <u>mode</u> as soon as you release the
         mouse button.

       • <u>Edit</u>/<u>view</u> a note, by left-clicking on a note.  This switches to <u>edit</u> <u>mode</u> (described below).

       • <u>Move</u> a note, by dragging it using the right mouse button.  This also raises the note in question on top
         of all others.  Depending on its horizontal position, the note will  be  tilted  automatically.   As  a
         side-effect,  a single brief right-click can be used to raise a note on top of overlapping ones without
         moving it.

         By dragging a note with the left mouse button, you can move it without changing its level with  respect
         to other notes, i.e., without raising it on top of all others.

       <b>Edit</b> <b>mode</b>

       This  mode  serves  two  purposes:  on  the one hand, it presents you with a "full-size" view of a note's
       contents, on the other, you can use the occasion to edit it.  Due to its limited size, a note can hold up
       to 10 characters on 6 lines (minus one on the last, i.e., 59 characters altogether),  plus  a  monochrome
       sketch of some kind.  Possibly actions:

       • <u>Enter</u>  text.   <b>wmpinboard</b>  supports user-selectable fonts and dead keys, so you should be able to enter
         any characters that are usually accessible  via  your  keyboard  and  have  them  displayed  correctly.
         Furthermore,   the   cursor   can   be   moved   around  using  the  arrow  keys  (or  EMACS-style  via
         [Ctrl]-[N]/[P]/[F]/[B], if you are so inclined).  Alternatively, it can be placed explicitly  by  left-
         clicking where you want it to be.  Other special keys that are supported include:

         [PgUp]/[PgDn]
           Places the cursor on character 1/59, respectively.

         [Home]/[End]
           Places the cursor at the textual start or end of the current line.

         [Del]
           Deletes  the  character  currently under the text cursor and shifts the remaining text on the current
           line to the left; if the current line is blank, removes it and shifts all lines below up by one line.

         [Backspace]
           See [Del], but affects the character on the left of the cursor.

         [Ins]
           Toggles inserting/overwriting of existing text; the current mode is  indicated  by  a  cursor  change
           (block cursor means insert mode).

         [Enter]
           In  insert  mode,  wraps  the  current  line  at the cursor's position; in overwrite mode (underscore
           cursor), merely moves the cursor to the start of the next line.

         [Ctrl]-[Y], -[Z]
           Removes an entire (intermediate) line, shifting those below up by one, and places the cursor  at  the
           start of the current line.

         [Esc]
           Quits <u>edit</u> <u>mode</u> and returns to the <u>pinboard</u> <u>view</u>.

         [Shift]-[Left]/[Right]
           Cycles through all notes currently on the pinboard.

         [Shift]-[Up]/[Down]
           Cycles  through  all  notes  that  are  <u>roughly</u> the same color as the current one.  For this purpose,
           colors have internally been divided into four groups: green, white/yellow, reddish, blue.

         ([Shift]-)[Tab]
           Cycles (backwards) through available note colors.

       • <u>Cut'n'paste</u> text.  Despite the limitations implied, <b>wmpinboard</b> has support for cutting &amp; pasting to and
         from the X clipboard:

         • In order to copy text to the clipboard, select the desired segment via either the left or  the  right
           mouse  button:  the  left  one  will  copy the text post-formatted as done by the command line switch
           <b>`--dump'</b> (see the section on "OPTIONS"); the right button will copy the raw selection.  Similarly,  a
           left  double  click will select the word (i.e., all adjoining non-blank characters) at the respective
           position, a right one will do the same but neglect line breaks as delimiters.  Additionally, you  can
           copy  a  note's  entire raw contents by pressing [Ctrl]-[R]; [Ctrl]-[C] will do the same with applied
           post-formatting.

         • To paste the clipboard's contents, press the middle button wherever  the  insertion  is  supposed  to
           happen.   This  will  insert the clipboard's current contents, trying to word-wrap the text (at white
           space and after hyphens).  If in insert mode, following text will be shifted towards the end  of  the
           note, trying to word-wrap that as well.

           If you wish to paste something without word-wrapping (e.g., an URL containing a hyphen), paste it via
           [Ctrl]-[I] (think [i]nsert).  This will paste the clipboard's raw contents at the current location of
           the cursor, shifting subsequent text if in insert mode (not trying to word-wrap that either).

         Obvious limitations you should be aware of include:

         • As  is  usually the case (about <b>wmpinboard</b>, anyway), size matters.  As you know, a note can hold only
           up to 59 characters, so trying to paste longer strings will result in those being truncated.

         • If the text to be pasted is formatted in some way or other, this won't be the case any more after  it
           has been pasted: <b>wmpinboard</b> replaces new line characters by blanks and, when pasting using the mouse,
           tries to word-wrap text.

         • The information stored in the cut buffer needn't necessarily be compatible with <b>wmpinboard</b> in that it
           may be encoded with another character set.

       • <u>Leave</u>  <u>edit</u>  <u>mode</u>.   This  is  achieved  by  left-clicking on the triangle in the lower right-hand side
         corner.  If the note is completely empty, it will be removed from the board.  In any case, this returns
         to the <u>pinboard</u> <u>view</u>.

       • <u>Pop</u> <u>up</u> a <u>panel</u> with some further options to choose  from.   This  is  done  by  right-clicking  on  the
         aforementioned triangle.  To learn what the <u>panel</u> is there for, see the corresponding section below.

       • <u>Draw</u>  a  sketch.   This  mode  can be activated via the <u>panel</u>, and deactivated by either right-clicking
         somewhere on the note or opening the <u>panel</u> again.  While in drawing mode, the mouse pointer is  pencil-
         shaped,  and  drawing can be done by keeping the left mouse button pressed and dragging the mouse, just
         as you'd expect.  Sketch and text may overlap each other,  but  keyboard  input  is  ignored  while  in
         drawing mode.

       • <u>Erase</u>  a sketch.  Just like DRAWing mode, this mode is entered via the <u>panel</u>, and can be quit just like
         the former.  In erase mode, the text is hidden, so you needn't guess whether  a  pixel  belongs  to  an
         entered  character  or  a drawn sketch.  Note that the erase cursor's point is slightly larger than the
         one used when drawing.

       Note: <b>wmpinboard</b> remembers where you left the text cursor after you last edited a note and restores  this
       position when you edit it the next time.

       <b>Edit</b> <b>mode</b> <b>panel</b>

       This  <u>panel</u> is intended to provide easy access to some options affecting <u>edit</u> <u>mode</u> or the current note in
       general.  The <u>panel</u> looks like this (letters denoting the buttons for reference below):

           +---+---+---+---+
           ⎪ a ⎪ c ⎪ e ⎪ g ⎪
           +---+---+---+---+
           ⎪ b ⎪ d ⎪ f ⎪ h ⎪
           +---+---+---+---+

       The buttons bear tiny icons which are meant to suggest what they do, which isn't all that easy on a 12x12
       pixels area. <b>`:^)'</b>

       Here's a description of what each button does:

       (a) Left-clicking on this button opens and closes the <u>alarm</u>  <u>panel</u>  (see  below),  which  allows  you  to
           configure  alarm  settings  for the note being edited.  When the <u>alarm</u> <u>panel</u> is visible, the alarm is
           activated.  To turn it off, press the button again and make the panel disappear.

       (b) This button allows one to cycle through all colors available for notes (20 of them).  Clicking on  it
           won't  close  the  <u>panel</u>,  so this can be done repeatedly.  Using the left mouse button traverses the
           colors in ascending, using the right button in descending order.  <u>Note:</u> colors can  also  be  changed
           via a keyboard shortcut in <u>edit</u> <u>mode</u> (see that section).

       (c) This  button  closes the <u>panel</u> and returns to <u>edit</u> <u>mode</u>, with the sketch-<u>draw</u>ing feature enabled (see
           above).

       (d) Closes the <u>panel</u> and returns to <u>edit</u> <u>mode</u>, with  the  sketch-<u>eras</u>ing  feature  enabled  (see  above).
           Don't  panic  if  entered  text vanishes all of a sudden when you do this: this is because <b>wmpinboard</b>
           intentionally hides it to eradicate the need for you to make wild guesses as to what's  entered  text
           and which pixels belong to a sketch.

       (e) This button removes all entered text on the current note and places the text cursor on the very first
           character.  Besides, it closes the <u>panel</u>, thus returning to <u>edit</u> <u>mode</u>.

       (f) Pressing this button completely removes a drawn sketch on the current note and returns to <u>edit</u> <u>mode</u>.

       (g) This option removes the *entire* note from the board and returns to <u>pinboard</u> <u>view</u>.

       (h) This  button merely closes the <u>panel</u> (and thus puts you back in <u>edit</u> <u>mode</u>).  The same can be achieved
           by simply right-clicking in this view.

       <b>Alarm</b> <b>panel</b>

       This panel can be accessed from the <u>edit</u> <u>mode</u> <u>panel</u> described above.  If the panel is visible  while  the
       <u>edit</u> <u>mode</u> <u>panel</u> is on, the alarm is set, otherwise, it's disabled.

       The  <u>alarm</u> <u>panel</u> consists of six distinct clickable areas.  The digits to the left and right of the colon
       are the hour and minute which an alarm is to be set for.  Below them, a date can be specified  in  month,
       day  order.   On the right, there are two toggle buttons (which can be either green (on) or red (off) and
       are mutually exclusive).  The top one represents a daily alarm whereas the bottom  one  indicates/sets  a
       date-specific one.

       The  hour,  minute,  month,  and  day  of month fields can each be incremented or decremented by left- or
       right-clicking on them, respectively.  Clicking on one of the toggle buttons configures the alarm as  the
       respective type.

       As the above description implies, there are two distinct kinds of alarms: daily and date-specific ones.

       Alarms  are  generally  executed  only  when  in <u>pinboard</u> <u>view</u> and not moving any notes about.  If you're
       keeping the program busy at the time an alarm would have to  occur,  it  will  be  delayed  until  you're
       finished  (i.e.,  let the program return to idle <u>pinboard</u> <u>view</u>).  The same holds if an alarm occurs while
       another one is running.

       If all prerequisites are given and an alarm becomes due, the corresponding  note  is  displayed  in  edit
       view,  and  the  display starts to flash on and off, along with the alarm command being executed (see the
       section on "OPTIONS").  To stop the blinking, click on the note.  From then on, the note will be in  <u>edit</u>
       <u>mode</u>.

       For  daily  alarms,  the  entered date is ignored, and as the name suggests, they're run every day at the
       specified time.  To deactivate such an alarm, you have to open the <u>edit</u> <u>mode</u> <u>panel</u> and click  button  (a)
       to make the <u>alarm</u> <u>panel</u> disappear, which turns the alarm off.

       In  contrast,  date-specific  alarms are executed only once, at the specified day and time.  Since a year
       cannot be specified (explicitly), the alarm will be run on this date's next occurrence within a year from
       when the alarm was set.  After that, the alarm will automatically be disabled.  If a date-specific  alarm
       becomes  due  while  <b>wmpinboard</b> isn't running, it will be displayed as soon as the program is started the
       next time--which does <b>not</b> go for daily alarms.

       The default mode for alarms is date-specific, and time and date are initialized with the next  full  hour
       when the alarm panel is opened the first time for a given note.

       Internally,  alarm  times  are stored in universal format, i.e., if you change the time zone after having
       set an alarm, the time will stay universally the same but will differ relative to the new time zone  from
       what absolute time you originally set.  This behavior is intended.

       Finally,  it  should  be  mentioned that there are a few limitations with respect to command line actions
       (such as <b>`--add'</b>, <b>`--del'</b>, <b>`-i'</b>, etc.).  See the section on "RESTRICTIONS".

</pre><h4><b>FREQUENTLY</b> <b>ASKED</b> <b>QUESTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       • <u>Q:</u> Is a "pinboard" this small really of any use?

         <u>A:</u> Of course the limited size imposes certain restrictions, but if you think  about  it,  you'll  agree
         that  a real life pinboard reminds you of things by the mere existence of notes being pinned to it.  In
         order to read what they say, you have to step close and, possibly, detach the note.

         Quite similarly, <b>wmpinboard</b> reminds you of things by facing you with colored representations  of  notes
         on  your  screen.   To  find  out what it was you intended them to remind you of, all you have to do is
         click on a note, which will then be displayed full size.  Furthermore, the alarm feature introduced  in
         a  later version allows for even more explicit reminders and thus renders <b>wmpinboard</b> even more powerful
         in a way than any real-life cork board. <b>`:-)'</b>

         By choosing from a variety of possible colors, you can assign particular colors  to  certain  kinds  of
         reminders,  which may further enhance <b>wmpinboard</b>'s usability.  Moreover, you can place certain notes on
         certain areas of the board to emphasize their category, urgency, etc.  It's up to you what to  make  of
         it.

         Finally, by adding drawing capabilities, I've definitely overcome the contents quantity barrier imposed
         by  the maximum number of 59 characters, for as everyone knows, a picture is worth more than a thousand
         words. *grin*

       • <u>Q:</u> I don't live in an English-speaking country, so what about extended  characters  (umlauts,  accents,
         cyrillic alphabet)?

         <u>A:</u>  <b>wmpinboard</b>  allows you to use an arbitrary 8bit X font, provided that its characters are of a fixed
         size of 6x10 (or, deprecated but possible, anything &lt;= 7x10) pixels.  The default font is "6x10"  (more
         precisely,   it's   called   "-misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--10-100-75-75-c-*-ISO8859-1"),  an  ISO8859-1
         (Latin1) font which should be part of every XFree installation.

         In order to make <b>wmpinboard</b> use another font, run it as

           $ wmpinboard --font=FONT

         where <b>FONT</b> is either a shortcut for a compiled-in font name (see the section on "OPTIONS" for a list of
         those) or a valid, complete X font descriptor.  This is a  configuration  directive,  meaning  that  no
         other  instance  of  <b>wmpinboard</b>  may be running at the time.  Note that this <u>only</u> <u>works</u> <u>if</u> <u>there</u> <u>are</u> <u>no</u>
         <u>more</u> <u>notes</u> <u>on</u> <u>the</u> <u>board</u>.  It's intentionally been made impossible to change the font  while  there  are
         notes  saved  in <b>wmpinboard</b>'s data file, since this might result in garbage being displayed.  Of course
         even a font specified via a shortcut has to exist on your system in order to be usable.

         If a configured custom font cannot be loaded or has invalid dimensions, <b>wmpinboard</b> will try to  revert.
         Note that this won't affect the font name saved along with the data, though.

       • <u>Q:</u> How can I disable those vexing, superfluous animations?

         <u>A:</u>

           $ wmpinboard --light

       • <u>Q:</u>  Why  aren't those animations smooth all of the time?  Sometimes it looks like they're being skipped
         entirely.

         <u>A:</u> This presumably is a multitasking issue: depending on the current system load and <b>wmpinboard</b>'s/the X
         server's recent CPU usage history, it may take a moment until the scheduling has been  adapted  to  the
         suddenly  increased CPU load implied by displaying the animation, and short as it is, it may already be
         finished until this has happened, i.e., it's the X server lagging  behind  in  updating  the  program's
         display  if  <b>wmpinboard</b>'s  been  idle  for  some time prior to that.  It may sound paradoxical, but the
         effect is the more likely to show the lower the system's load is.  I don't see  a  way  to  avoid  this
         effect--either this, or you turn off animations altogether.

       • <u>Q:</u>  When I leave <b>wmpinboard</b> idle in edit mode for some time, edit mode is terminated automatically.  Is
         that intended?

         <u>A:</u> Yes.  After 60 idle seconds (that's the default; see the section on  "OPTIONS")  in  edit  mode  (no
         mouse  click  and  no keyboard input), edit mode is terminated automatically.  If the note being edited
         happens to be blank, it will be discarded (or removed if an existing note is being edited).

         This timeout can, however, be adjusted according to your preferences  or  turned  off  using  the  <b>`-t'</b>
         parameter.  See the section on "OPTIONS" for this.

       • <u>Q:</u> When does <b>wmpinboard</b> save its data?

         <u>A:</u> Notes data is saved on each of these occasions:

         • whenever edit mode is terminated

         • when you switch notes in edit mode (via [Shift]-[arrow key])

         • when a note has been moved on the board

         • when an interactive instance is running and you run <b>wmpinboard</b> from the command line, making it dump,
           add, or delete notes

         • when killed via SIGINT or SIGTERM and edit mode is active

         Notes are saved to a file called <u>.wmpinboarddata</u> in your home directory (see the section on "FILES").

       • <u>Q:</u>  I've tried my best and littered the entire pinboard with quite a lot of notes.  Now I can't seem to
         be able to add another one.

         <u>A:</u> There's a compile-time limit of 20 notes.  I think more notes on this tiny a board really don't make
         any sense.

       • <u>Q:</u> I've explicitly configured my window manager for click-based rather than mouse-following focus,  but
         <b>wmpinboard</b>'s focus follows the mouse regardless.  Can I change this?

         <u>A:</u> By default, <b>wmpinboard</b> actively claims the keyboard input focus (if it's in note edit mode) whenever
         the pointer is moved over the application's area.  Since <b>wmpinboard</b> is a dock applet, i.e., a withdrawn
         rather  than  a  "real"  X  window, it can't be assigned a focus in the same way as to the latter ones.
         However, running <b>wmpinboard</b> with the parameter <b>`-c'</b> will make  it  emulate  some  sort  of  click-based
         focusing.  This means, it actively claims the keyboard focus only on these occasions:

         • when  a  new note is created (<u>not</u> when you click on an existing note--you'll have to explicitly click
           on the editing area to make it claim focus; this way, you can just view a note without any change  to
           keyboard focus)

         • when you click somewhere on the text area in edit mode

         Once  keyboard-focused,  <b>wmpinboard</b> will keep it until another window is explicitly focused (usually by
         clicking on its title bar or border).  To focus <b>wmpinboard</b> again when it's lost focus, you'll  have  to
         click on its text area in edit mode.  This click will only focus the application and not have the usual
         cursor-positioning effect.

         This  feature  is  to  be  considered  experimental since I'm not sure of how much use it really is.  A
         mouse-following focus is the recommended mode of operation.

       • <u>Q:</u> I've noticed that after a while, some sort of darker stains appear on my notes.  Is that  a  bug  in
         some drawing routine?

         <u>A:</u> No, this is not a bug.  These "stains" are meant to resemble creases, caused by frequent handling of
         a  particular note (wear &amp; tear, you see?).  In fact, they're added with a certain probability whenever
         you view a note by clicking on it (note that leafing through  notes  via  [Shift]-[arrow keys]  is  <u>not</u>
         affected),  when you clear its textual or drawn contents via the <u>edit</u> <u>mode</u> <u>panel</u> (very outwearing, that
         <b>;-)</b> ), and when a note is moved.  This feature can be disabled at compile  time  by  running  <u>configure</u>
         with `--disable-creases' as a parameter.

         To prevent the question, no, worn-out notes cannot be ironed to get rid of the creases.  Sorry. <b>`:-p'</b>

       • <u>Q:</u> Is <b>wmpinboard</b> compatible with <b>AfterStep</b>'s <b>Wharf</b>?

         <u>A:</u>  <b>wmpinboard</b>  tries to autodetect whether <b>Window</b> <b>Maker</b> is running and sets itself up accordingly.  If
         this doesn't work for you for some reason, you can explicitly make  it  run  in  either  Withdrawn-  or
         NormalState using the <b>`-w'</b> or <b>`-n'</b> flag, respectively.  See the section on "OPTIONS".

         Swallowing  evidently works with <b>AfterStep</b> 1.6.10; I don't know about earlier versions.  A <b>Wharf</b> config
         line you might try is this:

           *Wharf wmpinboard nil MaxSwallow "wmpinboard" wmpinboard &amp;

         Besides, <b>wmpinboard</b> has been reported to work with <b>Blackbox</b>.

       • <u>Q:</u> I have X running at a color depth of 8  bits,  i.e.,  in  palette  mode,  and  <b>wmpinboard</b>  obviously
         requires  too  many  colors  and  thus  looks real messy (or doesn't run at all, complaining about "not
         enough free color cells").  What can I do about this?

         <u>A:</u> As of version 0.99.1, the recommended solution is to  upgrade  whatever  component  of  your  system
         restricts you to a palette mode.

       • <u>Q:</u> Can I run multiple instances of <b>wmpinboard</b> as the same user, simultaneously?

         <u>A:</u>  No,  this  is certainly not a good idea.  The run-time behavior may be unpredictable, and your data
         file can get corrupted.  Therefore, any <b>wmpinboard</b> process that's to be run interactively first  checks
         whether another interactive instance is running, and if so, refuses to run.

       • <u>Q:</u>  I've  just  upgraded from a pre-0.7 version of <b>wmpinboard</b> and noticed that its data file format has
         changed completely since.  Is there a way to upgrade and yet keep my existing notes?

         <u>A:</u> There's a <b>Perl</b> script doing the conversion included with the distribution (the source one,  anyway).
         If  your  package  didn't include that, feel free to mail to the author (see the section on "AUTHOR" at
         the end of this documentation).

       • <u>Q:</u> I find a mere 59 characters per note to be a real limitation.  How about making <b>wmpinboard</b> pop up an
         external window with more room for that?  Or how about assigning that job to an external editor?

         <u>A:</u> There's a variety of comprehensive programs for keeping notes out there, offering this functionality
         but being rather heavy-weight since they are linked against one GUI library or  another  (<b>CoolNotes</b>  or
         <b>KNotes</b>  come  to  mind).   On  the  other  hand,  I  couldn't  find  a  <b>WM</b>-conforming  reminder I could
         omnipresently stick to my desktop anywhere, so I wrote <b>wmpinboard</b>.  I wanted it to be small, neat, easy
         to use, and yet useful in a way.

         I hope that's about what the program is currently like.  And I'd prefer to keep  it  like  that  rather
         than  inflate it by linking against a GUI library--eventually, the note editing code would outweigh the
         rest of the application by a factor, and people would probably still create notes mostly  shorter  than
         60 characters.  If you restrict your memos to keywords and abbreviations, that's quite a lot.

         I  want  <b>wmpinboard</b>  to  remain  an applet in that it doesn't open up external windows and use (if just
         temporarily) additional desktop space.  I explicitly wrote it to have something omnipresent at a  fixed
         position  on  my desktop.  I find it preferable to have the notes pop up in place rather than somewhere
         else on the screen.

         Personally, I use other programs for larger notes too; <b>wmpinboard</b> has been designed for things  smaller
         in  size  and greater in urgency, it's in no way meant to be a comprehensive knowledge base application
         of any kind.

         Summing up, I think a dock applet should be small both regarding its on-screen representation  and  the
         resources  it  uses.   That's  why  I  don't  intend  to  add  any  pop-up dialogs or similar things to
         <b>wmpinboard</b>.

       • <u>Q:</u> I've tried the program, yet I can't help finding it utterly useless.  What shall I do?

         <u>A:</u> The solution is simple.  Just don't use it.

       • <u>Q:</u> Will your answer to this question be "no"?

         <u>A:</u> Nope.

</pre><h4><b>HINTS</b></h4><pre>
       • A good way of making the best of the organizational features offered by <b>wmpinboard</b> is  to  use  certain
         colors  and  locations  on  the  pinboard to indicate urgency and contents of a note.  For example, you
         might use each of the color groups for a certain kind of reminder, because that  enables  you  to  leaf
         through  all  notes  with  related  contents via [Shift]-[arrow keys] in edit mode.  Besides, you might
         assign each corner of the board a specific urgency, altogether allowing you to  derive  a  note's  type
         from  its  color  and  its urgency from its location on the board.  Thanks again to the ability to leaf
         through all notes belonging to the same group of colors, notes with  similar  contents  will  still  be
         clustered in a way.

</pre><h4><b>UNDOCUMENTED</b> <b>FEATURES</b></h4><pre>
       This piece of documentation doesn't cover any undocumented features.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <u><a href="file:~/.wmpinboarddata">~/.wmpinboarddata</a></u>
         the user's <b>wmpinboard</b> data file

       <u><a href="file:~/.wmpinboarddata.new">~/.wmpinboarddata.new</a></u>
         temporary file created momentarily when saving data

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       $HOME
         the user's home directory

</pre><h4><b>RESTRICTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       • <b>wmpinboard</b>  relies  on  a  dock  app  tile size of at least 64x64 pixels.  In fact, using smaller tiles
         renders the applet rather useless, as, e.g., opening the edit mode panel becomes impossible.

       • Unpredictable effects may be the results if a command line action is taken while an  alarm  is  running
         and  others are due simultaneously.  If just a single alarm is active and no others are due, that alarm
         will be cancelled when the two instances of <b>wmpinboard</b> synchronize.  If more instances are  due  during
         the process, a race conditions arises that can't be solved satisfactorily due to the program's internal
         structure  and  organization.  Still, in theory, nothing critical will happen, and the most you'll lose
         will be an alarm or two.

       • <b>wmpinboard</b> data files are not designed to be portable across architectures.  Due to differences in data
         type representations that are likely otherwise, a  datafile  can  only  be  reliably  used  by  program
         binaries running on machines of the same architecture.

       • Certainly  of  no  interest  to  anyone, but mentioned for the sake of completeness: <b>wmpinboard</b>'s alarm
         features will start to fail past 04:14:07 on Jan 19, 2037, which is due to the legacy Un*x time format.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       If you stumble on any bugs, feel free to mail the author.  The same goes if you  encounter  any  problems
       running/using the program.  Be sure to include any information you consider relevant, i.e., at a minimum,
       the version of <b>wmpinboard</b> you're using as well as your OS and X versions.

       Also, further suggestions are always welcome.  Please check the <u>TODO</u> file that's part of the distribution
       to  see  if  what you're about to suggest isn't already on my "to do" list, or has been suggested earlier
       and was rejected for one reason or other.
