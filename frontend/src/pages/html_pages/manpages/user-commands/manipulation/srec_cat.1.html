       srec_cat - manipulate EPROM load files

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>srec_cat</b> [ <u>option</u>...  ] <u>filename</u>...
       <b>srec_cat</b> <b>-Help</b>
       <b>srec_cat</b> <b>-VERSion</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>srec_cat</u>  program  is  used to assemble the given input files into a single output file.  The use of
       filters (see below) allows significant manipulations to be performed by this command.

   <b>Data</b> <b>Order</b>
       The data from the input files is not immediately written to the output, but is stored in memory until the
       complete EPROM image has been assembled.  Data is then written to the output file  in  ascending  address
       order.   The  original  ordering  of the data (in those formats capable of random record ordering) is <u>not</u>
       preserved.

   <b>Data</b> <b>Comparison</b>
       Because input record order is not preserved, textual comparison of input and output (such as the  <u><a href="../man1/diff.1.html">diff</a></u>(1)
       or  <u><a href="../man1/tkdiff.1.html">tkdiff</a></u>(1)  commands)  can  be misleading.  Not only can lines appear in different address orders, but
       line lengths and line termination can differ as well.  Use the <u><a href="../man1/srec_cmp.1.html">srec_cmp</a></u>(1) program to compare  two  EPROM
       load  files.  If a text comparison is essential, run both files through the <u><a href="../man1/srec_cat.1.html">srec_cat</a></u>(1) program to ensure
       both files to be compared have identical record ordering and line lengths.

   <b>Data</b> <b>Conflicts</b>
       The storing of data in memory enables the  detection  of  data  conflicts,  typically  caused  by  linker
       sections unintentionally overlapping.

       • A warning will be issued for each address which is redundantly set to the same value.

       • A  fatal error will be issued if any address is set with contradictory values.  To avoid this error use
         an <b>-exclude</b> <b>-within</b> filter (see <u><a href="../man1/srec_input.1.html">srec_input</a></u>(1)) or, to make it a warning, use  the  <b>-contradictory‐bytes</b>
         option (see below).

       • A  warning  will be issued for input files where the data records are not in strictly ascending address
         order.  To suppress this warning, use the <b>-disable‐sequence‐warning</b> option (see below).

       These features are designed to detect problems which are difficult to debug, and detects them <u>before</u>  the
       data is written to an EPROM and run in your embedded system.

</pre><h4><b>INPUT</b> <b>FILE</b> <b>SPECIFICATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Input  may be qualified in two ways: you may specify a data file or a data generator.  format and you may
       specify filters to apply to them.  An input file specification looks like this:
              <u>data‐file</u> [ <u>filter</u> ... ]
              <u>data‐generator</u> [ <u>filter</u> ... ]

   <b>Data</b> <b>Files</b>
       Input from data files is specified by file name and format name.  An input file specification looks  like
       this:
              <u>filename</u> [ <u>format</u> ][ -ignore‐checksums ]
       The default format is Motorola S‐Record format, but <u>many</u> others are also understood.

   <b>Data</b> <b>Generators</b>
       It  is also possible to generate data, rather than read it from a file.  You may use a generator anywhere
       you could use a file.  An input generator specification looks like this:
              <b>-GENerate</b> <u>address‐range</u> <b>-</b><u>data‐source</u>
       Generators include random data and various forms of constant data.

   <b>Common</b> <b>Manual</b> <b>Page</b>
       See <u><a href="../man1/srec_input.1.html">srec_input</a></u>(1) for complete details of input specifiers.  This description is  in  a  separate  manual
       page because it is common to more than one SRecord command.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The following options are understood:

       <b>@</b><u>filename</u>
               The  named  text  file is read for additional command line arguments.  Arguments are separated by
               white space (space, tab, newline, <u>etc</u>).  There is no wildcard mechanism.   There  is  no  quoting
               mechanism.  Comments, which start with '<b>#</b>' and extend to the end of the line, are ignored.  Blank
               lines are ignored.

       <b>-Output</b> <u>filename</u> [ <u>format</u> ]
               This  option  may be used to specify the output file to be used.  The special file name “-[rq] is
               understood to mean the standard output.  Output defaults to the standard output if this option is
               not used.

               The <u>format</u> may be specified as:

               <b>-Absolute_Object_Module_Format</b>
                       An Intel Absolute Object Module Format file will be written.   (See  <u><a href="../man5/srec_aomf.5.html">srec_aomf</a></u>(5)  for  a
                       description of this file format.)

               <b>-Ascii_Hex</b>
                       An Ascii‐Hex file will be written.  (See <u><a href="../man5/srec_ascii_hex.5.html">srec_ascii_hex</a></u>(5) for a description of this file
                       format.)

               <b>-ASM</b> [ <u>prefix</u> ][ -<u>option</u>... ]
                       A series of assembler DB statements will be written.

                       The  optional  <u>prefix</u> may be specified to change the names of the symbols generated.  The
                       defaults to "eprom" if not set.

                       Several options are available to modify the style of output:

                       <b>-Dot_STyle</b>
                               Use "dot" style pseudo‐ops instead of words.  For example .byte instead of the DB
                               default.

                       <b>-HEXadecimal_STyle</b>
                               Use hexadecimal numbers in the output, rather than the default decimal numbers.

                       <b>-Section_STyle</b>
                               By default the generated assemble of placed at  the  correct  address  using  ORG
                               pseudo‐ops.   Section style output emits tables of section addresses and lengths,
                               so the data may be related at runtime.

                       <b>-A430</b>   Generate output which is compliant to the a430.exe compiler as it is  used,  <u>e.g.</u>
                               in IAR Embedded Workbench.  This is short‐hand for -section‐style -hex‐style

                       <b>-Output_Word</b>
                               Generate output which is in two‐byte  words  rather  than  bytes.   This  assumes
                               little‐endian words; you will need to use the -Byte‐Swap filter if your target is
                               big‐endian.   No attempt is made to align the words onto even address boundaries;
                               use and input filter such as
                                       <u>input‐file</u> -fill 0xFF -within <u>input‐file</u>
                                       -range‐pad 2
                               to pad the data to whole words first.

                       A C array definition will be written.

                       The  optional  <u>identifier</u>  is  the  name  of  the variable to be defined, or bugus if not
                       specified.

                       <b>-INClude</b>
                               This option asks for an include file to be generated as well.

                       This option  says  to  use  the  Signetics  hex  format.   See  <u><a href="../man5/srec_signetics.5.html">srec_signetics</a></u>(5)  for  a
                       description of this format.

               <b>-SPAsm</b>  This  option  says  to  use  the  SPASM  assembler  output  format  (commonly used by PIC
                       programmers).  See <u><a href="../man5/srec_spasm.5.html">srec_spasm</a></u>(5) for a description of this format.

               <b>-SPAsm_Little_Endian</b>
                       This option says to  use  the  SPASM  assembler  output  format  (commonly  used  by  PIC
                       programmers).  But with the data the other way around.

               <b>-STewie</b> A  Stewie  binary  format file will be written.  (See <u><a href="../man5/srec_stewie.5.html">srec_stewie</a></u>(5) for a description of

               <b>-Texas_Instruments_TeXT</b>
                       This option says to use the Texas Instruments TXT (MSP430) format to write the file.  See

               <b>-VHdl</b> [ <u>bytes‐per‐word</u> [ <u>name</u> ]]
                       A  VHDL  format  file  will  be  written.   The  <u>bytes‐per‐word</u> defaults to one, the <u>name</u>
                       defaults to eprom.  The <u>etc/x_defs_pack.vhd</u> file in the source distribution  contains  an
                       example  ROM  definitions  pack for the type‐independent output.  You may need to use the
                       -byte‐swap filter to get the byte order you want.

               <b>-VMem</b> [ <u>memory‐width</u> ]
                       A Verilog VMEM format file will be written.  The <u>memory‐width</u> may be 8, 16, 32, 64 or 128
                       bits; defaults to 32 if unspecified.  (See <u><a href="../man5/srec_vmem.5.html">srec_vmem</a></u>(5) for a description  of  this  file
                       format.)  You may need to use the -byte‐swap filter to get the byte order you want.

               <b>-WILson</b> A wilson format file will be written.  (See <u><a href="../man5/srec_wilson.5.html">srec_wilson</a></u>(5) for a description of this file
                       format.)

       <b>-Address_Length</b> <u>number</u>
               This  option  many  be  used  to  specify the minimum number of bytes to be used in the output to
               represent an address (padding with leading zeros if  necessary).   This  helps  when  talking  to
               imbecilic EPROM programmer devices which do not fully implement the format specification.

       <b>-CRLF</b>   This option is short‐hand for the <b>-line‐termination=crlf</b> option.  For use with hare‐brained EPROM
               programmer  devices  which  assume  all  the  world  uses  Evil  Bill's  operating  system's line
               termination.

       <b>-Data_Only</b>
               This option implies the  <b>-disable=header</b>,  <b>-disable=data‐count</b>,  <b>-disable=exec‐start‐address</b>  and
               <b>-disable=footer</b> options.

       <b>-DISable</b> <u>feature‐name</u>
               This  option  is  used  to  disable  the output of a named feature.  See the <b>-enable</b> option for a
               description of the available features.

       <b>-ENable</b> <u>feature‐name</u>
               This option is used to enable the output of a named feature.

               Header  This feature controls the presence of header records, records  which  appear  before  the
                       data itself.  Headers often, but not always, include descriptive text.

               Execution_Start_Address
                       This feature controls the presence of execution start address records, which is where the
                       monitor will jump to and start executing code once the hex file has finished loading.

               Data_Count
                       This  feature  controls the presence of data record count records, which appear after the
                       data, and state how many data records preceded them.  Usually a data integrity mechanism.

               Footer  This feature controls the presence of a file termination record, one that <u>does</u> <u>not</u> double
                       as an execution start address record.

               Optional_Address
                       In formats that have the address and  the  data  separated  or  partially  separated  (as
                       opposed  to having a complete address in every record) it is possible to disable emitting
                       the first address where that address would be zero, as these  format  often  default  the
                       address  to zero if no address is seen before the first data record.  This is disabled by
                       default, the zero address is always emitted.

               Not all formats have all of the above features.  Not all formats are able to optionally omit  any
               or all the above features.  Feature names may be abbreviated like command line option names.

       <b>-Execution_Start_Address</b> <u>number</u>
               This  option  may  be used to set the execution start address, in those formats which support it.
               The execution start address is where the monitor will jump to and start executing code  once  the
               hex  file  has  finished  loading,  think  of  it  as a “goto” address.  Usually ignored by EPROM
               programmer devices.  This option implies the <b>-enable=exec‐start‐addr</b> option.

               Please note: the execution start address is a different concept than the first address in  memory
               of your data.  If you want to change where your data starts in memory, use the <b>-offset</b> filter.

       <b>-HEAder</b> <u>string</u>
               This  option  may  be  used  to  set the header comment, in those formats which support it.  This
               option implies the <b>-enable=header</b> option.

               If you need to inject binary data into the header, use the URL encoding that uses %  followed  by
               two hexadecimal characters.  For example a backspace would be encoded as “%08”.

       <b>-IGnore_Checksums</b>
               The <b>-IGnore‐Checksums</b> option may be used to disable checksum validation of input files, for those
               formats  which have checksums at all.  Note that the checksum values are still read in and parsed
               (so it is still an error if they are missing) but their values are not checked.   Used  after  an
               input  file  name, the option affects that file alone; used anywhere else on the command line, it
               applies to all following files.

       <b>-Line_Termination</b> <u>style‐name</u>
               This option may be used to specify line termination style for text output.  The default is to use
               the host operating system's default line termination style (but Cygwin behaves as if it's  Unix).
               Use  this  option  with  caution, because it will also introduce extra (i.e. wrong) CR bytes into
               binary formats.

               Carriage_Return_Line_Feed
                   Use the CRLF line termination style, typical of DOS and M$ Windows.

               NewLine
                   Use the NL line termination style, typical of Unix and Linux.

               Carriage_Return
                   Use the CR line termination style, typical of Apple Macintosh.

               All other line termination  style  names  will  produce  a  fatal  error.   Style  names  may  be
               abbreviated like command line option names.

       <b>-Line_Length</b> <u>number</u>
               This  option  may  be  used to limit the length of the output lines to at most <u>number</u> characters.
               (Not meaningful for binary  file  format.)   Defaults  to  something  less  than  80  characters,
               depending  on  the  format.   If  you  need to control the maximum number of bytes in each output
               record, use the <b>--Ouput_Block_Size</b> option.

       <b>-Output_Block_Size</b> <u>number</u>
               This option may be used to specify the exact number of  data  bytes  to  appear  in  each  output
               record.   There are format‐specific limitations on this value, you will get an error if the value
               isn't valid.  If you need to control the maximum number of characters on a line of  text  output,
               use the <b>--Line_Length</b> option.

       <b>-Output_Block_Packing</b>
               From  time to time, with large files, you may notice that your data records are spit unexpectedly
               on output.  This usually happens where record lengths are not a power of 2.  If this bothers  you
               (or  your  comparison  tools)  this  option  may  be  used to repack the output so that SRecord's
               internal block boundaries are not visible in the output.

       <b>-Output_Block_Alignment</b>
               This option is similar to the <b>-Output_Block_Packing</b> option, except that short  records  are  used
               after holes to cause subsequent records to be placed on a block size boundary.

       <b>-Enable_Sequence_Warnings</b>
               This  option  may  be used to enable warnings about input files where the data records are not in
               strictly ascending address order.  Only one warning is  issued  per  input  file.   This  is  the
               default.

               <b>Note:</b> the output of <u><a href="../man1/srec_cat.1.html">srec_cat</a></u>(1) is always in this order.

               <b>Note:</b> This option must be used <u>before</u> the input file.  This is because if there are several files
               on  the  command  line, each may need different settings.  The setting remains in force until the
               next <b>-Disable_Sequence_Warnings</b> option.

       <b>-Disable_Sequence_Warnings</b>
               This option may be used to disable warnings about input files where the data records are  not  in
               strictly ascending address order.

               <b>Note:</b>  This  option  must  be used <u>before</u> the offending input file.  This is because if there are
               several files on the command line, each may need different  settings.   The  setting  remains  in
               force until the next <b>-Ensable_Sequence_Warnings</b> option.

       All other options will produce a diagnostic error.

       All  options may be abbreviated; the abbreviation is documented as the upper case letters, all lower case
       letters and underscores (_) are optional.  You must use consecutive sequences of optional letters.

       All options are case insensitive, you may type them in upper case or lower case or a combination of both,
       case is not important.

       For example: the arguments “-help”, “-HEL” and “-h” are all interpreted to mean the  <b>-Help</b>  option.   The
       argument “-hlp” will not be understood, because consecutive optional characters were not supplied.

       Options and other command line arguments may be mixed arbitrarily on the command line.

       The  GNU  long  option  names  are  understood.  Since all option names for <u>srec_cat</u> are long, this means
       ignoring the extra leading “-”.  The “<b>--</b><u>option</u><b>=</b><u>value</u>” convention is also understood.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>srec_cat</u> command will exit with a status of 1 on any error.  The <u>srec_cat</u> command will only exit with
       a status of 0 if there are no errors.
