</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       FORM - Symbolic manipulation system

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>form</b> [ <u>options</u> ] <u>inputfile</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       FORM is a symbolic manipulation system. The <b>form</b> command reads a text file (which should have a name that
       ends  with  the  extension  <b>.frm</b>, or <b>-</b> to read the standard input) containing definitions of mathematical
       expressions as well as statements that tell it how to manipulate these expressions. It is widely used  in
       the  theoretical  particle  physics  community, but it is not restricted to applications in this specific
       field.

       <b>tform</b> is the threaded version using POSIX Threads.

       <b>parform</b> is the multiprocessing version using MPI.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-</b>      Read the input from stdin instead of from a file.

       <b>-c</b>     Error checking only. Notice that this will not work properly if  there  are  conditionals  in  the
              preprocessor phase that depend on results obtained at earlier stages of the program.

       <b>-C</b>     Next argument is the filename of the log file. The default is the filename of the FORM script with
              the .log extension.

       <b>-d,</b> <b>-D</b> Next  argument/option  is  the name of a preprocessor variable that will be defined before the run
              starts. A specific value can be assigned with the syntax <b>-d</b> <u>VARIABLENAME</u>=<u>VALUE</u>.  The default value
              is 1.

       <b>-f</b>     Output goes only to log file.

       <b>-F</b>     Output only to log file. Further like <b>-L</b> or <b>-ll</b>.

       <b>-h</b>     Wait for some key to be touched before finishing the run. Basically only for some old window based
              systems.

       <b>-I</b>     Next argument/option is the path of a directory for include, procedure and subroutine files.

       <b>-l</b>     Make a regular log file.

       <b>-ll,</b> <b>-L</b>
              Make a log file without intermediate statistics.

       <b>-M</b>     Put the PID (process identifier) in the name of the temporary files. This makes for longer  names,
              but gives a better guarantee of uniqueness. If a file with the created name exists already it will
              be  overwritten.  This option is for when several instances of FORM are started at nearly the same
              time as can happen from minos or make (with the make -j option).

       <b>-p</b>     Next argument/option is the path of a directory  for  input,  include,  procedure  and  subroutine
              files.

       <b>-pipe</b>  Indicates  that  FORM is started up as the receiving end of a pipe. Action will be taken to set up
              the proper communication channels.

       <b>-q,</b> <b>-si</b>
              Quiet option. Only output expressions are printed.

       <b>-R</b>     Recover from a crash.

       <b>-s</b>     Next argument/option is the path of a directory for a setup file.

       <b>-S</b>     Next argument/option is the name of a setup file.

       <b>-t</b>     Next argument/option is the path of a directory for temporary files.

       <b>-ts</b>    Next argument/option is the path of a directory for temporary sort files.

       <b>-T</b>     Puts FORM in a mode in which the maximum totalsize is measured and  printed  at  the  end  of  the
              program.

       <b>-v</b>     Only the version will be printed. The program terminates immediately after it.

       <b>-w</b>     This should be followed immediately by a number without any space. The number indicates the number
              of worker threads for <b>tform</b>. All other versions of FORM ignore this parameter.

       <b>-W</b>     Turn on the wall-clock time mode in the statistics.

       <b>-z</b>     The number following is a timelimit for the program in second.

       <b>-Z</b>     Removes  the  <b>.str</b> file on crash, whatever its contents. Under ordinary circumstances at a crash a
              <b>.str</b> file will not be removed if it has a nonzero content.

       <b>-y</b>     Run only the preprocessor and dump its output.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>FORMPATH</b>
              The directory in which FORM will look for procedures and header files,  assuming  it  cannot  find
              them in the current directory.

       <b>FORMTMP</b>
              The directory in which FORM will make its temporary files.

       <b>FORMTMPSORT</b>
              The directory in which FORM will make its temporary sort files.

       <b>FORMSETUP</b>
              The full path and name of a setup file.
