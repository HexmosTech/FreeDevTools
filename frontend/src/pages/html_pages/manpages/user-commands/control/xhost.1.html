</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       xhost - server access control program for X

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>xhost</b> [[+-]name ...]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>xhost</u>  program  is  used  to  add  and  delete  host names or user names to the list allowed to make
       connections to the X server.  In the case of hosts, this provides a rudimentary form of  privacy  control
       and  security.  It is only sufficient for a workstation (single user) environment, although it does limit
       the worst abuses.  Environments which require more sophisticated measures should implement the user-based
       mechanism or use the hooks in the protocol for passing other authentication data to the server.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Xhost</u> accepts the following command line options described below.  For security, the options that  affect
       access  control  may only be run from the "controlling host".  For workstations, this is the same machine
       as the server.  For X terminals, it is the login host.

       <b>-help</b>   Prints a usage message.

       <b>[+]</b><u>name</u> The given <u>name</u> (the plus sign is optional) is added to the list  allowed  to  connect  to  the  X
               server.  The name can be a host name or a complete name (See <b>NAMES</b> for more details).

       <b>-</b><u>name</u>   The  given  <u>name</u> is removed from the list of allowed to connect to the server.  The name can be a
               host name or a complete name (See <b>NAMES</b> for more details).  Existing connections are not  broken,
               but  new  connection  attempts  will  be  denied.  Note that the current machine is allowed to be
               removed; however, further connections (including attempts to add it back) will not be  permitted.
               Resetting  the  server  (thereby  breaking  all  connections)  is  the  only  way  to allow local
               connections again.

       <b>+</b>       Access is granted to everyone, even if they aren't on the list (i.e., access  control  is  turned
               off).

       <b>-</b>       Access is restricted to only those on the list (i.e., access control is turned on).

       <u>nothing</u> If  no  command  line  arguments are given, a message indicating whether or not access control is
               currently enabled is printed, followed by the list of those allowed to connect.  This is the only
               option that may be used from machines other than the controlling host.

</pre><h4><b>NAMES</b></h4><pre>
       A complete name has the syntax ``family:name'' where the families are as follows:

       inet      Internet host (IPv4)
       inet6     Internet host (IPv6)
       dnet      DECnet host
       nis       Secure RPC network name
       krb       Kerberos V5 principal
       local     contains only one name, the empty string
       si        Server Interpreted

       The family is case insensitive.  The format of the name varies with the family.

       When Secure RPC is being used, the network independent netname (e.g., "nis:unix.<u>uid</u>@<u>domainname</u>")  can  be
       specified,  or  a  local  user  can  be  specified  with  just the username and a trailing at-sign (e.g.,
       "nis:pat@").

       For backward compatibility with pre-R6 <u>xhost</u>, names that contain an at-sign (@) are assumed to be in  the
       nis  family.   Otherwise they are assumed to be Internet addresses. If compiled to support IPv6, then all
       IPv4 and IPv6 addresses returned by <a href="../man3/getaddrinfo.3.html">getaddrinfo</a>(3) are added to the access list in the  appropriate  inet
       or inet6 family.

       The  local  family  specifies  all the local connections at once. However, the server interpreted address
       "si:localuser:<u>username</u>" can be used to specify a single local user. (See the <u><a href="../man7/Xsecurity.7.html">Xsecurity</a></u>(7) manual page for
       more details.)

       Server interpreted addresses consist of a case-sensitive type tag  and  a  string  representing  a  given
       value,  separated  by  a colon.  For example, "si:hostname:almas" is a server interpreted address of type
       <u>hostname</u>, with a value of <u>almas</u>.   For more information on the  available  forms  of  server  interpreted
       addresses, see the <u><a href="../man7/Xsecurity.7.html">Xsecurity</a></u>(7) manual page.

       The initial access control list for display number <b>n</b> may be set by the file <u>/etc/X</u><b>n</b><u>.hosts</u>, where <b>n</b> is the
       display number of the server.  See <u><a href="../man1/Xserver.1.html">Xserver</a></u>(1) for details.

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       For  each  name  added to the access control list, a line of the form "<u>name</u> being added to access control
       list" is printed.  For each name removed from the access control list, a line of  the  form  "<u>name</u>  being
       removed from access control list" is printed.

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       <a href="../man7/X.7.html">X</a>(7), <a href="../man7/Xsecurity.7.html">Xsecurity</a>(7), <a href="../man1/Xserver.1.html">Xserver</a>(1), <a href="../man1/xdm.1.html">xdm</a>(1), <a href="../man1/xauth.1.html">xauth</a>(1), <a href="../man3/getaddrinfo.3.html">getaddrinfo</a>(3)

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>DISPLAY</b> to get the default host and display to use.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       You  can't  specify  a  display  on  the  command  line because <b>-display</b> is a valid command line argument
       (indicating that you want to remove the machine named <u>``display''</u> from the access list).

       The X server stores network addresses, not host names, unless you  use  the  server-interpreted  hostname
       type  address.  If somehow you change a host's network address while the server is still running, and you
       are using a network-address based form of authentication, <u>xhost</u> must be  used  to  add  the  new  address
       and/or remove the old address.
