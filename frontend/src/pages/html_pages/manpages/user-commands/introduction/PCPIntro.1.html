       <b>PCPIntro</b> - introduction to the Performance Co-Pilot (PCP)

</pre><h4><b>INTRODUCTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  Performance  Co-Pilot  (PCP)  is  a  toolkit  designed  for  monitoring  and  managing  system-level
       performance.  These services are  distributed  and  scalable  to  accommodate  the  most  complex  system
       configurations and performance problems.

       PCP supports many different platforms, including (but not limited to) Linux, MacOSX, Solaris and Windows.
       From a high-level PCP can be considered to contain two classes of software utility:

       <u>PCP</u> <u>Collectors</u>
               These  are  the  parts of PCP that collect and extract performance data from various sources, for
               example the operating system kernel.

       <u>PCP</u> <u>Monitors</u>
               These are the parts of PCP that display data collected from hosts (or archives) that have the <u>PCP</u>
               <u>Collector</u> installed.  Many monitor tools are available as part of the  core  PCP  release,  while
               other (typically graphical) monitoring tools are available separately in the PCP GUI package.

       This manual entry describes the high-level features and options common to most PCP utilities available on
       all platforms.

</pre><h4><b>OVERVIEW</b></h4><pre>
       The  PCP  architecture  is  distributed in the sense that any PCP tool may be executing remotely.  On the
       host (or hosts) being monitored, each domain of performance metrics, whether the kernel, a service layer,
       a database management system, a web server, an application, etc.  requires a Performance  Metrics  Domain
       Agent  (PMDA)  which  is responsible for collecting performance measurements from that domain.  All PMDAs
       are controlled by the Performance Metrics Collector Daemon (<b><a href="../man1/pmcd.1.html">pmcd</a></b>(1)) on the same host.

       Client applications (the monitoring tools) connect to <b><a href="../man1/pmcd.1.html">pmcd</a></b>(1), which acts as a router  for  requests,  by
       forwarding requests to the appropriate PMDA and returning the responses to the clients.  Clients may also
       access performance data from sets of PCP archives (created using <b><a href="../man1/pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger</a></b>(1)) for retrospective analysis.

   <b>Security</b> <b>philosophy</b>
       PCP  redistributes  a  wealth  of  performance  information  within  a host and across its networks.  The
       following security philosophy underlies the setting of several <u>defaults</u> that control how much information
       is sent and received.

       By default, the information exposed by  PMCD  about  a  host  is  approximately  of  the  same  level  of
       confidentiality  as  available to a completely unprivileged user on that host.  So, performance data that
       is available to be <u>read</u> completely freely on a machine may be made available by PMCD to the network.

       However, the host running PMCD and its  network  is  <u>not</u>  assumed  to  run  only  friendly  applications.
       Therefore, <u>write</u> type operations, including from the local host, are not permitted by default.

       These  defaults  may be overridden (expanded or reduced) in several ways, including by specifying network
       ACLs in <b>pmcd.conf</b>, activating non-default PMDAs, or by using PMCD connections that pass user credentials.
       For example, some PMDAs automatically provide greater information for particular  credentialed  users  or
       groups.

   <b>Applications</b>
       The  following  performance  monitoring  applications are primarily console based, typically run directly
       from the command line, and are just a small subset of the  tools  available  as  part  of  the  base  PCP
       package.

       Each tool or command is documented completely in its own reference page.

       <b>pmstat</b> Outputs an ASCII high-level summary of system performance.

       <b>pmie</b>   An inference engine that can evaluate predicate-action rules to perform alarms and automate system
              management tasks.

       <b>pminfo</b> Interrogate specific performance metrics and the metadata that describes them.

       <b>pmlogger</b>
              Generates PCP archives of performance metrics suitable for replay by most PCP tools.

       <b>pmrep</b>  Highly customizable performance metrics reporter with support for various different output modes.

       <b>pmval</b>  Simple  periodic  reporting  for  some or all instances of a performance metric, with optional VCR
              time control.

       If the PCP GUI package is installed then the following additional tools are available.

       <b>pmchart</b>
              Displays trends over time of arbitrarily selected performance metrics from one or more hosts.

       <b>pmtime</b> Time control utility for coordinating the time  between  multiple  tools  (including  pmchart  and
              pmval).

       <b>pmdumptext</b>
              Produce ASCII reports for arbitrary combinations of performance metrics.

</pre><h4><b>COMMON</b> <b>COMMAND</b> <b>LINE</b> <b>ARGUMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       There is a set of common command line arguments that are used consistently by most PCP tools.

       <b>-a</b> <u>archive</u>, <b>--archive</b>=<u>archive</u>
              Performance  metric  information is retrospectively retrieved from the set of Performance Co-Pilot
              (PCP) archives identified by <u>archive</u> previously generated by <b><a href="../man1/pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger</a></b>(1).   See  <b><a href="../man3/LOGIMPORT.3.html">LOGIMPORT</a></b>(3)  and
              <b><a href="../man5/LOGARCHIVE.5.html">LOGARCHIVE</a></b>(5) for archive creation interfaces and format documentation.

              <u>archive</u>  is  a  comma-separated  list  of  names,  each  of  which  may be the name of a directory
              containing one or more archives, the base name common to all of the physical files created  by  an
              instance  of  <b><a href="../man1/pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger</a></b>(1), or any one of the physical files, e.g.  <u>/path/to/myarchives</u> (directory)
              or <u>myarchive</u> (base name) or <u>myarchive</u><b>.meta</b> (the metadata file) or  <u>myarchive</u><b>.index</b>  (the  temporal
              index) or <u>myarchive</u><b>.0</b> (the first data volume of <u>archive</u>) or <u>myarchive</u><b>.0.bz2</b> or <u>myarchive</u><b>.0.bz</b> (the
              first  data  volume  compressed with <b><a href="../man1/bzip2.1.html">bzip2</a></b>(1)) or <u>myarchive</u><b>.0.gz</b> or <u>myarchive</u><b>.0.Z</b> or <u>myarchive</u><b>.0.z</b>
              (the first data volume compressed with <b><a href="../man1/gzip.1.html">gzip</a></b>(1)), <u>myarchive</u><b>.1</b> or <u>myarchive</u><b>.3.bz2</b> or <u>myarchive</u><b>.42.gz</b>
              etc.

       <b>-h</b> <u>host</u>, <b>--host</b>=<u>host</u>
              Unless directed to another host by the <b>-h</b> (or <b>--host</b>) option, or to a set of archives  by  the  <b>-a</b>
              (or <b>--archive</b>) option, the source of performance metrics will be the Performance Metrics Collector
              Daemon  (PMCD)  on the local host.  Refer to the <b>PMCD</b> <b>HOST</b> <b>SPECIFICATION</b> section later for further
              details on the many options available when forming the <u>host</u> specification, as well as  a  detailed
              description  of  the  default  local  host  connection.  The <b>-a</b> (or <b>--archive</b>), and <b>-h</b> (or <b>--host</b>)
              options are mutually exclusive.

       <b>-s</b> <u>samples</u>, <b>--samples</b>=<u>samples</u>
              The argument <u>samples</u> defines the number of samples to be retrieved and reported.  If <u>samples</u> is  0
              or  <b>-s</b>  (or  <b>--samples</b>)  is not specified, the application will sample and report continuously (in
              real time mode) or until the end of the set of PCP archives (in archive mode).

       <b>-z</b>, <b>--hostzone</b>
              Change the reporting timezone to the local timezone  at  the  host  that  is  the  source  of  the
              performance metrics, as identified via either the <b>-h</b> (or <b>--host</b>) or <b>-a</b> (or <b>--archive</b>) options.

       <b>-Z</b> <u>timezone</u>, <b>--timezone</b>=<u>timezone</u>
              By  default,  applications  report  the  time of day according to the local timezone on the system
              where the application is executed.  The <b>-Z</b> (or <b>--timezone</b>) option changes the timezone to <u>timezone</u>
              in the format of the environment variable <b>TZ</b> as described in <b><a href="../man7/environ.7.html">environ</a></b>(7).

       <b>-D</b> <u>debugspec</u>, <b>--debug</b>=<u>debugspec</u>
              Sets the PCP debugging options to <u>debugspec</u> to enable diagnostics and tracing that is most helpful
              for developers or when trying to diagnose the misbehaviour of a PCP application.  <u>debugspec</u> should
              be a comma-separated list of debugging option name(s) and/or decimal integers, see <b><a href="../man1/pmdbg.1.html">pmdbg</a></b>(1) for  a
              description of the supported option names and values.

       In the absence of a live or archive source of metrics, a heuristic search for archives for the local host
       can  be  invoked  via  the <b>-O</b> (or <b>--origin</b>) option.  When using this option without an explicit source of
       metrics,  monitor  tools  attempt  to  use  archives   from   a   system   archive   location   such   as
       <b>$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmlogger/`hostname`</b>.   Refer  to  the <b>TIME</b> <b>WINDOW</b> <b>SPECIFICATION</b> section below for details on
       the acceptable syntax for the origin option, but a typical invocation in this mode would be <b>-O</b>  <b>today</b>  or
       <b>--origin</b> <b>yesterday</b>.

</pre><h4><b>INTERVAL</b> <b>SPECIFICATION</b> <b>AND</b> <b>ALIGNMENT</b></h4><pre>
       Most  PCP  tools  operate  with  periodic  sampling  or  reporting, and the <b>-t</b> (or <b>--interval</b>) and <b>-A</b> (or
       <b>--align</b>) options may be used to control the duration of the sample interval  and  the  alignment  of  the
       sample times.

       <b>-t</b> <u>interval</u>, <b>--interval</b>=<u>interval</u>
              Set the update or reporting interval.

              The <u>interval</u> argument is specified as a sequence of one or more elements of the form
                        <u>number</u>[<u>units</u>]
              where  <u>number</u>  is  an integer or floating point constant (parsed using <b><a href="../man3/strtod.3.html">strtod</a></b>(3)) and the optional
              <u>units</u> is one of: <b>seconds</b>, <b>second</b>, <b>secs</b>, <b>sec</b>, <b>s</b>, <b>minutes</b>, <b>minute</b>, <b>mins</b>, <b>min</b>,  <b>m</b>,  <b>hours</b>,  <b>hour</b>,  <b>h</b>,
              <b>days</b>, <b>day</b> and <b>d</b>.  If the <u>unit</u> is empty, <b>second</b> is assumed.

              In addition, the upper case (or mixed case) version of any of the above is also acceptable.

              Spaces anywhere in the <u>interval</u> are ignored, so <b>4</b> <b>days</b> <b>6</b> <b>hours</b> <b>30</b> <b>minutes</b>, <b>4day6hour30min</b>, <b>4d6h30m</b>
              and <b>4d6.5h</b> are all equivalent.

              Multiple  specifications  are  additive,  for  example  ``<b>1hour</b>  <b>15mins</b> <b>30secs</b>'' is interpreted as
              3600+900+30 seconds.

       <b>-A</b> <u>align</u>, <b>--align</b>=<u>align</u>
              By default samples are not necessarily aligned on any natural unit of time.   The  <b>-A</b>  or  <b>--align</b>
              option  may  be  used  to force the initial sample to be aligned on the boundary of a natural time
              unit.  For example <b>-A</b> <b>1sec</b>, <b>-A</b> <b>30min</b> and <b>--align</b> <b>1hour</b> specify alignment on  whole  seconds,  half
              and whole hours respectively.

              The  <u>align</u>  argument  follows  the  syntax  for an <u>interval</u> argument described above for the <b>-t</b> or
              <b>--interval</b> option.

              Note that alignment occurs by advancing the time as required, and that <b>-A</b> (or <b>--align</b>) acts  as  a
              modifier  to  advance both the start of the time window (see the next section) and the origin time
              (if the <b>-O</b> or <b>--origin</b> option is specified).

</pre><h4><b>TIME</b> <b>WINDOW</b> <b>SPECIFICATION</b></h4><pre>
       Many PCP tools are designed to operate in  some  time  window  of  interest,  for  example  to  define  a
       termination time for real-time monitoring or to define a start and end time within a set of PCP archives.

       In  the  absence  of  the  <b>-O</b> (or <b>--origin</b>) and <b>-A</b> (or <b>--align</b>) options to specify an initial sample time
       origin and time alignment (see above), the PCP application will retrieve the first sample at the start of
       the time window.

       The following options may be used to specify a time window of interest.

       <b>-S</b> <u>starttime</u>, <b>--start</b>=<u>starttime</u>
              By default the time window commences immediately in real-time mode, or coincides with time at  the
              start of the set of PCP archives in archive mode.  The <b>-S</b> or <b>--start</b> option may be used to specify
              a later time for the start of the time window.

              The  <u>starttime</u> parameter may be given in one of three forms (<u>interval</u> is the same as for the <b>-t</b> or
              <b>--interval</b> option as described above, <u>datetime</u> is described below):

              <u>interval</u>
                     To specify an offset from the current time (in real-time mode) or the beginning of a set of
                     PCP archives (in archive mode) simply specify the interval of time as  the  argument.   For
                     example <b>-S</b> <b>30min</b> will set the start of the time window to be exactly 30 minutes from now in
                     real-time mode, or exactly 30 minutes from the start of a set of PCP archives.

              -<u>interval</u>
                     To  specify  an  offset from the end of a set of PCP archives, prefix the <u>interval</u> argument
                     with a minus sign.  In this case, the start of the time window precedes the time at the end
                     of the set of archives by the given interval.  For example <b>-S</b> <b>-1hour</b> will set the start  of
                     the  time  window to be exactly one hour before the time of the last sample in a set of PCP
                     archives.

              @<u>datetime</u>
                     To specify the calendar date and time (local time in the reporting timezone) for the  start
                     of  the time window, use the datetime syntax preceded by an at sign.  Refer to the datetime
                     description below for detailed information.

       <b>-T</b> <u>endtime</u>, <b>--finish</b>=<u>endtime</u>
              By default the end of the time window is unbounded (in real-time mode) or aligned with the time at
              the end of a set of PCP archives (in archive mode).  The <b>-T</b> or <b>--finish</b>  option  may  be  used  to
              specify an earlier time for the end of the time window.

              The  <u>endtime</u>  parameter  may be given in one of three forms (<u>interval</u> is the same as for the <b>-t</b> or
              <b>--interval</b> option as described above, <u>datetime</u> is described below):

              <u>interval</u>
                     To specify an offset from the start of the time window simply use the interval of  time  as
                     the  argument.   For example <b>-T</b> <b>2h30m</b> will set the end of the time window to be 2 hours and
                     30 minutes after the start of the time window.

              -<u>interval</u>
                     To specify an offset back from the time at the end of a set of  PCP  archives,  prefix  the
                     <u>interval</u>  argument  with  a  minus  sign.  For example <b>-T</b> <b>-90m</b> will set the end of the time
                     window to be 90 minutes before the time of the last sample in a set of PCP archives.

              @<u>datetime</u>
                     To specify the calendar date and time (local time in the reporting timezone) for the end of
                     the time window, use the datetime syntax preceded by an at sign.   Refer  to  the  datetime
                     description below for detailed information.

       <b>-O</b> <u>origin</u>, <b>--origin</b>=<u>origin</u>
              By default samples are fetched from the start of the time window (see description of <b>-S</b> or <b>--start</b>
              option)  to  the  end  of  the  time window (see description of <b>-T</b> or <b>--finish</b> option).  The <b>-O</b> or
              <b>--origin</b> option allows the specification of an origin within the time window to  be  used  as  the
              initial  sample  time.   This  is  useful for interactive use of a PCP tool with the <b><a href="../man1/pmtime.1.html">pmtime</a></b>(1) VCR
              replay facility.

              The <u>origin</u> argument accepted by <b>-O</b> (or <b>--origin</b>) conforms to the same syntax and semantics as  the
              <u>starttime</u> argument for the <b>-T</b> (or <b>--finish</b>) option.

              For  example  <b>--origin</b>  <b>-0</b>  specifies  that  the initial position should be at the end of the time
              window; this is most useful when wishing to replay ``backwards'' within the time window.

       The <u>datetime</u> argument for the <b>-O</b> (or <b>--origin</b>), <b>-S</b> (or <b>--start</b>) and <b>-T</b> (or <b>--finish</b>) options consists of:
                 <b>date</b> <b>time</b> <b>zone</b> <b>day</b> <b>relative</b>
       A date can be one of: YY-MM-DD, MM/DD/YY, DD Month YYYY, or Month  DD  YYYY.   A  time  can  be  one  of:
       HH:MM:SS, HH:MM.  HH:MM can use either the 12 hour (via an am or pm suffix) or 24 hour convention.  A day
       of the week can be a spelled out day of the week, optionally preceded by an ordinal number such as second
       Tuesday.   A zone is a time zone value as specified by the <b><a href="../man8/tzselect.8.html">tzselect</a></b>(8) command.  A relative time can be a
       time unit that is: preceded by a cardinal number such as 1 year or 2 months, preceded by one of the  time
       words  this  or  last,  or  succeeded  by the time word ago.  A relative time can also be one of the time
       words: yesterday, today, tomorrow, now.  Examples of datetime strings are: <b>1996-03-04</b> <b>13:07:47</b>  <b>EST</b>  <b>Mon</b>,
       <b>1996-03-05</b> <b>14:07:47</b> <b>EST</b> <b>-1hour</b>, <b>Mon</b> <b>Mar</b>  <b>4</b> <b>13:07:47</b> <b>1996</b>, <b>Mar</b> <b>4</b> <b>1996</b>, <b>Mar</b> <b>4</b>, <b>Mar</b>, <b>13:07:50</b> or <b>13:08</b>.

       For any missing low order fields, the default value of 0 is assumed for hours, minutes and seconds, 1 for
       day  of  the  month  and  Jan  for months.  Hence, the following are equivalent: <b>--start</b> <b>'@</b> <b>Mar</b> <b>1996'</b> and
       <b>--start</b> <b>'@</b> <b>Mar</b> <b>1</b> <b>00:00:00</b> <b>1996'</b>.

       If any high order fields are missing, they are filled in by starting with the year, month  and  day  from
       the  current time (real-time mode) or the time at the beginning of the set of PCP archives (archive mode)
       and advancing the time until it matches the fields that are specified.   So,  for  example  if  the  time
       window  starts  by default at ``Mon Mar 4 13:07:47 1996'', then <b>--start</b> <b>@13:10</b> corresponds to 13:10:00 on
       Mon Mar 4, 1996, while <b>--start</b> <b>@10:00</b> corresponds to 10:00:00 on Tue  Mar  5,  1996  (note  this  is  the
       following day).

       For greater precision than afforded by <b><a href="../man3/datetime.3.html">datetime</a></b>(3), the seconds component may be a floating point number.

       If a timezone is not included in a <u>datetime</u> then there are several interpretations available depending on
       the  other  command  line options used.  The default is to use the local timezone on the system where the
       PCP tool is being run.  A <b>-Z</b> or <b>--timezone</b> option specifies an explicit timezone, else a <b>-z</b> or <b>--hostzone</b>
       option changes the timezone to the local timezone at the host that  is  the  source  of  the  performance
       metrics.

</pre><h4><b>PERFORMANCE</b> <b>METRICS</b> <b>-</b> <b>IDENTIFIERS,</b> <b>NAMES,</b> <b>VALUES</b></h4><pre>
       The  number  of  performance metric names supported by PCP on most platforms ranges from many hundreds to
       several thousand.  The PCP  libraries  and  applications  use  an  internal  identification  scheme  that
       unambiguously  associates  a single integer with each known performance metric.  This integer is known as
       the Performance Metric Identifier, or PMID.  Although not  a  requirement,  PMIDs  tend  to  have  global
       consistency across all systems, so a particular performance metric usually has the same PMID.

       For all users and most applications, direct use of the PMIDs would be inappropriate (this would limit the
       range  of accessible metrics, make the code hard to maintain, force the user interface to be particularly
       baroque, and so on).  Hence a Performance Metrics Name Space (PMNS) is used to provide external names and
       a hierarchic classification for performance metrics.  A PMNS is represented as a  tree,  with  each  node
       having a label, a pointer to either a PMID (for leaf nodes) or a set of descendent nodes in the PMNS (for
       non-leaf nodes).

       A  node label must begin with an alphabetic character, followed by zero or more characters drawn from the
       alphabetics, the digits and character ``_'' (underscore).  For alphabetic characters  in  a  node  label,
       upper and lower case are distinguished.

       By  convention,  the name of a performance metric is constructed by concatenation of the node labels on a
       path through the PMNS from the root node to a leaf node, with a ``.'' as a separator.  The root  node  in
       the  PMNS  is  unlabeled,  so  all names begin with the label associated with one of the descendent nodes
       below the root node of the PMNS, for example <u>kernel.percpu.syscall</u>.  Typically (although this  is  not  a
       requirement)  there  would  be at most one name for each PMID in a PMNS.  For example <u>kernel.all.cpu.idle</u>
       and <u>disk.dev.read</u> are the unique names for two distinct performance metrics, each with a unique PMID.

       Groups of related PMIDs may be named by naming a non-leaf node in the PMNS tree, for example <u>disk</u>.

       The default local PMNS used by <b>pmcd</b> is located at <b>$PCP_VAR_DIR/pmns/root</b> however the environment variable
       <b>PMNS_DEFAULT</b> may be set to the full pathname of a different PMNS which will then be used as  the  default
       local PMNS.

       Most  applications  do  not  use the local PMNS directly, but rather import parts of the PMNS as required
       from the same place that performance metrics are fetched, i.e. from <b><a href="../man1/pmcd.1.html">pmcd</a></b>(1) for live monitoring or from a
       set of PCP archives for retrospective monitoring.

       To explore the PMNS use <b><a href="../man1/pminfo.1.html">pminfo</a></b>(1), or if the PCP GUI package is installed the New Chart and Metric Search
       windows within <b><a href="../man1/pmchart.1.html">pmchart</a></b>(1).

       Some performance metrics have a singular value.  For example, the available memory or number  of  context
       switches  have  one  value  per  performance  metric  source,  that  is,  one value per host.  The metric
       descriptor (metadata) for each metric makes this fact known to applications that process values for these
       single-valued metrics.

       Some performance metrics have a set of values  or  <u>instances</u>  in  each  implementing  performance  metric
       domain.  For example, one value for each disk, one value for each process, one value for each CPU, or one
       value  for  each  activation of a given application.  When a metric has multiple instances, the PMNS does
       not represent this in metric names; rather, a single  metric  may  have  an  associated  set  of  values.
       Multiple  values  are  associated  with  the members of an <u>instance</u> <u>domain</u>, such that each instance has a
       unique instance identifier within the associated instance domain.  For example, the ''per CPU´´  instance
       domain  may  use  the instance identifiers 0, 1, 2, 3, and so on to identify the configured processors in
       the system.  Internally, instance identifiers are encoded as binary values, but each  performance  metric
       domain  also  supports  corresponding  strings  as external names for the instance identifiers, and these
       names are used at the user interface to the PCP utilities.

       Multiple performance metrics may be associated with a single instance domain.  For  example,  per-process
       metrics under <u>proc</u> all share the same instance domain.

       PCP  arranges  for  information  describing  instance  domains to be exported from the performance metric
       domains to the applications that require this information.  Applications  may  also  choose  to  retrieve
       values for all instances of a performance metric, or some arbitrary subset of the available instances.

       Metric  names  and  the  instance domain concept provides two-dimensions for the modelling of performance
       metrics.  This is a clear and simple model, however on some occasions it does not suffice.  For  example,
       a  metric  may  wish  to  represent higher dimensional data such as ``per CPU'' counters for each running
       process.  In these cases it is common to create a compound instance, where the name is composed  of  each
       component  with a separator in-between (for example, ``87245::cpu7'' might be used to separate process ID
       from CPU ID) to create flattened instance names.  Additionally, such cases benefit from the use of metric
       instances labels to explicitly show the separate components (continuing the example  from  above,  labels
       ``{"pid":87245,"cpu":7}'' might be used).

</pre><h4><b>PERFORMANCE</b> <b>METRIC</b> <b>SPECIFICATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       In configuration files and (to a lesser extent) command line options, metric specifications adhere to the
       following syntax rules by most tools.  See the tool specific manual pages for the exact syntax supported.

       If the source of performance metrics is real-time from <b><a href="../man1/pmcd.1.html">pmcd</a></b>(1) then the accepted syntax is
                 <u>host</u><b>:</b><u>metric</u><b>[</b><u>instance1</u><b>,</b><u>instance2</u><b>,</b>...<b>]</b>

       If the source of performance metrics is a set of PCP archives then the accepted syntax is
                 <u>archive</u><b>/</b><u>metric</u><b>[</b><u>instance1</u><b>,</b><u>instance2</u><b>,</b>...<b>]</b>

       The <u>host</u><b>:</b>, <u>archive</u><b>/</b> and <b>[</b><u>instance1</u><b>,</b><u>instance2</u><b>,</b>...<b>]</b>  components are all optional.

       The <b>,</b> delimiter in the list of instance names may be replaced by white space.

       Special characters in <u>instance</u> names may be escaped by surrounding the name in double quotes or preceding
       the character with a backslash.

       White space is ignored everywhere except within a quoted <u>instance</u> name.

       An  empty  <u>instance</u>  is  silently  ignored,  and  in  particular ``<b>[]</b>'' is the same as no <u>instance</u>, while
       ``<b>[one,,,two]</b>'' is parsed as specifying just the two instances ``<b>one</b>'' and ``<b>two</b>''.

       As a special case, if the <b>host</b> is the single character ``@''  then  this  refers  to  a  <b>PM_CONTEXT_LOCAL</b>
       source, see <b><a href="../man3/pmNewContext.3.html">pmNewContext</a></b>(3).

</pre><h4><b>SECURE</b> <b>PMCD</b> <b>CONNECTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Since  PCP  version  3.6.11,  a  monitor  can  explicitly request a secure connection to a collector host
       running <b><a href="../man1/pmcd.1.html">pmcd</a></b>(1) or <b><a href="../man1/pmproxy.1.html">pmproxy</a></b>(1) using the PM_CTXFLAG_SECURE  context  flag.   If  the  PCP  Collector  host
       supports  this  feature  -  refer  to the pmcd.feature.secure metric for confirmation of this - a TLS/SSL
       (Transport Layer Security or Secure Sockets Layer) connection can be established which  uses  public  key
       cryptography and related techniques.  These features aim to prevent eavesdropping and data tampering from
       a  malicious  third party, as well as providing server-side authentication (confident identification of a
       server by a client) which can be used to guard against man-in-the-middle attacks.

       A secure <b>pmcd</b> connection requires use of certificate-based authentication.  The security features offered
       by <b>pmcd</b> and <b>pmproxy</b> are implemented using the OpenSSL APIs and utilities.  The  <b><a href="../man1/openssl.1.html">openssl</a></b>(1)  tool  can  be
       used to create certificates suitable for establishing trust between PCP monitor and collector hosts.

       A  complete description is beyond the scope of this document, refer to the <b>PCP</b> <b>ENVIRONMENT</b>, <b>FILES</b> and <b>SEE</b>
       <b>ALSO</b> sections for detailed information.  This includes links  to  tutorials  on  the  steps  involved  in
       setting up the available security features.

</pre><h4><b>PMCD</b> <b>HOST</b> <b>SPECIFICATION</b></h4><pre>
       In  the  absence of an explicit hostname specification, most tools will default to the local host in live
       update mode.  In PCP releases since 3.8.4 onward, this results  in  an  efficient  local  protocol  being
       selected  -  typically  a  Unix  domain  socket.   If  this  option is used (which can also be explicitly
       requested via the <u>unix:</u> host specification described below), it is important to note that all connections
       will be automatically authenticated.  In other words, the credentials of the user invoking a client  tool
       will  automatically  be  made  available  to <b><a href="../man1/pmcd.1.html">pmcd</a></b>(1) and all of its PMDAs, on the users behalf, such that
       results can be customized to the privilege levels of individual users.

       Names of remote hosts running the <b><a href="../man1/pmcd.1.html">pmcd</a></b>(1) daemon can of course also be provided to request a remote  host
       be  used.   The  most basic form of <b>pmcd</b> host specification is a simple host name, possibly including the
       domain name if necessary.  However, this can be extended in a number of ways to further refine attributes
       of the connection made to <b>pmcd</b>.

       The <b>pmcd</b> port number and also optional <b><a href="../man1/pmproxy.1.html">pmproxy</a></b>(1) hostname and its port number, can be given as  part  of
       the  host  specification, since PCP version 3.0.  These supersede (and override) the old-style PMCD_PORT,
       PMPROXY_HOST and PMPROXY_PORT environment variables.

       The following are valid hostname specifications that specify connections to <b>pmcd</b>  on  host  <u>nas1.acme.com</u>
       with/without  a list of ports, with/without a <b><a href="../man1/pmproxy.1.html">pmproxy</a></b>(1) connection through a firewall, and with IPv6 and
       IPv4 addresses as shown.

            $ pcp --host nas1.acme.com:44321,<a href="mailto:4321@firewall.acme.com">4321@firewall.acme.com</a>:44322
            $ pcp --host nas1.acme.com:<a href="mailto:44321@firewall.acme.com">44321@firewall.acme.com</a>:44322
            $ pcp --host nas1.acme.com:<a href="mailto:44321@firewall.acme.com">44321@firewall.acme.com</a>
            $ pcp --host <a href="mailto:nas1.acme.com@firewall.acme.com">nas1.acme.com@firewall.acme.com</a>
            $ pcp --host nas1.acme.com:44321
            $ pcp --host [fe80::2ad2:44ff:fe88:e4f1%p2p1]
            $ pcp --host 192.168.0.103

       In addition, ``connection attributes'' can also be specified.  These include username, password  (can  be
       given  interactively  and  may  depend  on  the  authentication  mechanism employed), whether to target a
       specific running container, whether to use secure (encrypted) or native (naked) protocol, and so on.  The
       previous examples all default to native protocol, and use no authentication.  This can be altered, as  in
       the following examples.

            $ pcp --host pcps://app2.acme.com?container=cae8e6edc0d5
            $ pcp --host pcps://nas1.acme.com:44321?username=tanya&amp;method=gssapi
            $ pcp --host pcps://<a href="mailto:nas2.acme.com@firewalls.r.us">nas2.acme.com@firewalls.r.us</a>?method=plain
            $ pcp --host pcp://nas3.acme.com
            $ pcp --host 192.168.0.103?container=cae8e6edc0d5,method=scram-sha-256
            $ pcp --host unix:
            $ pcp --host local:

       The  choice  of authentication method, and other resulting parameters like username, optionally password,
       etc, depends on the SASL2 configuration used by each (remote) <b>pmcd</b>.  Tutorials are  available  specifying
       various  aspects  of  configuring  the  authentication module(s) used, these fine details are outside the
       scope of this document.

       In all situations, host names can be used interchangeably with IPv4 or  IPv6  addressing  (directly),  as
       shown  above.   In  the case of an IPv6 address, the full address must be enclosed by square brackets and
       the scope (interface) must also be specified.

       The final <u>local:</u> example above is now the default for most tools.  This connection  is  an  automatically
       authenticated  local  host  connection on all platforms that support Unix domain sockets.  No password is
       required  and  authentication  is  automatic.   This  is  also  the  most  efficient  (lowest   overhead)
       communication channel.

       The  difference  between <u>unix:</u> and <u>local:</u> is that the former is a strict Unix domain socket specification
       (connection fails if it cannot connect that way), whereas the latter has a  more  forgiving  fallback  to
       using  <u>localhost</u>  (i.e.  a regular Inet socket connection is used when Unix domain socket connections are
       unavailable).

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       In  addition to the PCP run-time environment and configuration variables described in the <b>PCP</b> <b>ENVIRONMENT</b>
       section below, the following environment variables apply to all installations.

       Note that most uses of these environment variables are optimized to check the environment only the  first
       time the variable might be used.  As the environment usually is not checked again, the only safe strategy
       is  to  ensure  all  PCP-related  environment variables are set before the first call into any of the PCP
       libraries.

       <b>PCP_ALLOW_BAD_CERT_DOMAIN</b>
              When set, allow clients to accept certificates with mismatched domain names with  no  prompt  when
              they are sent by <b>pmcd</b> or other server components.  See <b>PCP_SECURE_SOCKETS.</b>

       <b>PCP_ALLOW_SERVER_SELF_CERT</b>
              When  set,  allow  clients to accept self-signed certificates with no prompt when they are sent by
              <b>pmcd</b> or other server components.  See <b>PCP_SECURE_SOCKETS.</b>

       <b>PCP_CONSOLE</b>
              When set, this changes the default console from <u>/dev/tty</u> (on Unix) or <u>CON:</u> (on Windows) to be  the
              specified  console.  The special value of <u>none</u> can be used to indicate no console is available for
              use.  This is used in places where console-based tools need to interact  with  the  user,  and  in
              particular is used when authentication is being performed.

       <b>PCP_DEBUG</b>
              When  set,  this  variable  provides an alternate to the <b>-D</b> command line option described above to
              initialize the diagnostic and debug options for applications that use <b><a href="../man3/pmGetOptions.3.html">pmGetOptions</a></b>(3)  to  process
              command  line  options  and arguments.  The value for <b>$PCP_DEBUG</b> is the same as for the <b>-D</b> command
              line option, namely a comma-separated list of debugging option name(s), and/or  decimal  integers,
              see <b><a href="../man1/pmdbg.1.html">pmdbg</a></b>(1) for a description of the supported option names and values.

       <b>PCP_DERIVED_CONFIG</b>
              When  set, this variable defines a colon separated list of files and/or directories (the syntax is
              the same as for the <b>$PATH</b> variable for <b><a href="../man1/sh.1.html">sh</a></b>(1)).  The components are expanded into a list  of  files
              as  follows: if a component of <b>$PCP_DERIVED_CONFIG</b> is a file, then that file is added to the list,
              else if a component is a directory then recursive descent is used to  enumerate  all  files  below
              that directory and these are added to the list.

              Each  file  in  the resulting list is assumed to contain definitions of derived metrics as per the
              syntax described in <b><a href="../man3/pmLoadDerivedConfig.3.html">pmLoadDerivedConfig</a></b>(3), and these are loaded in order.

              Derived metrics may be used to extend the available  metrics  with  new  (derived)  metrics  using
              simple arithmetic expressions.

              If  <b>PCP_DERIVED_CONFIG</b>  is set, the derived metric definitions are processed automatically as each
              new source of performance metrics is established (i.e. each time a <b><a href="../man3/pmNewContext.3.html">pmNewContext</a></b>(3) is  called)  or
              when requests are made against the PMNS.

              Any component in the <b>$PCP_DERIVED_CONFIG</b> list or the expanded list of files that is not a file, or
              is  not  a  directory  or  is  not  accessible (due to permissions or a bad symbolic link) will be
              silently ignored.

       <b>PCP_IGNORE_MARK_RECORDS</b>
              When PCP archives logs are created there may be temporal gaps associated with  discontinuities  in
              the  time  series  of logged data, for example when <b><a href="../man1/pmcd.1.html">pmcd</a></b>(1) is restarted or when multiple archives
              are concatenated with <b><a href="../man1/pmlogextract.1.html">pmlogextract</a></b>(1).  These discontinuities are internally noted with  a  &lt;mark&gt;
              record  in the PCP archives, and value interpolation as described in <b><a href="../man3/pmSetMode.3.html">pmSetMode</a></b>(3) is not supported
              across &lt;mark&gt; records (because the values before and after a &lt;mark&gt;  record  are  not  necessarily
              from  a  continuous  time  series).   Sometimes the user knows the data semantics are sound in the
              region of the &lt;mark&gt; records, and <b>$PCP_IGNORE_MARK_RECORDS</b> may be used  to  suppress  the  default
              behaviour.

              If  <b>PCP_IGNORE_MARK_RECORDS</b>  is  set  (but  has no value) then all &lt;mark&gt; records will be ignored.
              Otherwise the value <b>$PCP_IGNORE_MARK_RECORDS</b> follows the syntax for an <u>interval</u> argument described
              above for the <b>-t</b> option, and &lt;mark&gt; records will be ignored if  the  time  gap  between  the  last
              record before the &lt;mark&gt; and the first record after the &lt;mark&gt; is not more than <u>interval</u>.

       <b>PCP_SECURE_SOCKETS</b>
              When  set,  this  variable  forces  any  monitor  tool  connections  to  be  established using the
              certificate-based secure sockets feature.  If the connections cannot be established securely, they
              will fail.

       <b>PCP_TLSCONF_PATH</b>
              Specifies the location from which TLS (Transport Layer Security) configuration  settings  will  be
              read.   These  settings are used by PCP client tools, <b>pmcd</b> and <b>pmproxy</b> whenever secure (encrypted)
              communication is requested.

       <b>PCP_STDERR</b>
              Many PCP tools support the environment variable <b>PCP_STDERR</b>, which can be  used  to  control  where
              error  messages  are sent.  When unset, the default behavior is that ``usage'' messages and option
              parsing errors are reported on standard error, other messages after initial startup  are  sent  to
              the  default  destination  for  the tool, i.e. standard error for ASCII tools, or a dialog for GUI
              tools.

              If <b>PCP_STDERR</b> is set to the literal value <b>DISPLAY</b> then all messages will be displayed in a dialog.
              This is used for any tools launched from a Desktop environment.

              If <b>PCP_STDERR</b> is set to any other value, the value is assumed to be a filename, and  all  messages
              will be written there.

       <b>PMCD_CONNECT_TIMEOUT</b>
              When  attempting  to  connect  to  a  remote  <b><a href="../man1/pmcd.1.html">pmcd</a></b>(1) on a machine that is booting, the connection
              attempt  could  potentially  block  for  a  long  time  until  the  remote  machine  finishes  its
              initialization.   Most PCP applications and some of the PCP library routines will abort and return
              an error if the connection has not been established after some  specified  interval  has  elapsed.
              The  default  interval  is 5 seconds.  This may be modified by setting <b>PMCD_CONNECT_TIMEOUT</b> in the
              environment to a real number of seconds for the desired timeout.  This is  most  useful  in  cases
              where the remote host is at the end of a slow network, requiring longer latencies to establish the
              connection correctly.

       <b>PMCD_RECONNECT_TIMEOUT</b>
              When  a  monitor  or client application loses a connection to a <b><a href="../man1/pmcd.1.html">pmcd</a></b>(1), the connection may be re-
              established by calling a service routine in the PCP library.  However, attempts to  reconnect  are
              controlled  by  a  back-off strategy to avoid flooding the network with reconnection requests.  By
              default, the back-off delays are 5, 10,  20,  40  and  80  seconds  for  consecutive  reconnection
              requests from a client (the last delay will be repeated for any further attempts after the fifth).
              Setting  the  environment  variable  <b>PMCD_RECONNECT_TIMEOUT</b>  to a comma separated list of positive
              integers will re-define the back-off delays, for example setting <b>PMCD_RECONNECT_TIMEOUT</b> to ``1,2''
              will back-off for 1 second, then attempt another connection request every 2 seconds thereafter.

       <b>PMCD_REQUEST_TIMEOUT</b>
              For monitor or client applications connected to <b><a href="../man1/pmcd.1.html">pmcd</a></b>(1), there is a possibility of the application
              "hanging" on a request for performance metrics or metadata or help text.  These delays may  become
              severe  if  the  system  running  <b>pmcd</b> crashes, or the network connection is lost.  By setting the
              environment variable <b>PMCD_REQUEST_TIMEOUT</b> to a number of seconds, requests to  <b>pmcd</b>  will  timeout
              after  this  number  of  seconds.   The default behavior is to be willing to wait 10 seconds for a
              response from every <b>pmcd</b> for all applications.

       <b>PMCD_WAIT_TIMEOUT</b>
              When <b><a href="../man1/pmcd.1.html">pmcd</a></b>(1) is started from <b>$PCP_RC_DIR/pcp</b> then the primary  instance  of  <b><a href="../man1/pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger</a></b>(1)  will  be
              started  if  the  configuration  flag <b>pmlogger</b> is <b><a href="../man8/chkconfig.8.html">chkconfig</a></b>(8) or <b><a href="../man1/systemctl.1.html">systemctl</a></b>(1) enabled and <b>pmcd</b> is
              running and accepting connections.

              The check on <b>pmcd</b>'s readiness will wait up to <b>PMCD_WAIT_TIMEOUT</b>  seconds.   If  <b>pmcd</b>  has  a  long
              startup  time  (such  as  on  a very large system), then <b>PMCD_WAIT_TIMEOUT</b> can be set to provide a
              maximum wait longer than the default 60 seconds.

       <b>PMNS_DEFAULT</b>
              If set, then interpreted as  the  full  pathname  to  be  used  as  the  default  local  PMNS  for
              <b><a href="../man3/pmLoadNameSpace.3.html">pmLoadNameSpace</a></b>(3).   Otherwise,  the  default local PMNS is located at <b>$PCP_VAR_DIR/pcp/pmns/root</b>
              for base PCP installations.

       <b>PCP_COUNTER_WRAP</b>
              Many of the performance metrics exported from PCP agents have the  semantics  of  <u>counter</u>  meaning
              they  are  expected  to be monotonically increasing.  Under some circumstances, one value of these
              metrics may smaller than the previously fetched value.  This can happen when a counter  of  finite
              precision  overflows,  or when the PCP agent has been reset or restarted, or when the PCP agent is
              exporting values from some  underlying  instrumentation  that  is  subject  to  some  asynchronous
              discontinuity.

              The  environment  variable  <b>PCP_COUNTER_WRAP</b>  may  be  set  to  indicate  that all such cases of a
              decreasing ``counter'' should be treated as a counter overflow, and hence the values  are  assumed
              to  have wrapped once in the interval between consecutive samples.  This ``wrapping'' behavior was
              the default in earlier PCP versions, but by default has been disabled in PCP release from  version
              1.3 on.

       <b>PCP_PMDAS_DIR</b>
              The  <b>PCP_PMDAS_DIR</b>  environment  variable  may be used to modify the directory used by <b><a href="../man1/pmcd.1.html">pmcd</a></b>(1) and
              <b><a href="../man3/pmNewContext.3.html">pmNewContext</a></b>(3) (for <b>PM_CONTEXT_LOCAL</b> contexts) when searching for a daemon or DSO PMDA.

       <b>PMCD_PORT</b>
              The TCP/IP port(s) used by <b><a href="../man1/pmcd.1.html">pmcd</a></b>(1) to create the socket for incoming connections and requests, was
              historically 4321 and more recently the officially registered port 44321; in the current  release,
              <b>both</b>  port  numbers are used by default as a transitional arrangement.  This may be over-ridden by
              setting <b>PMCD_PORT</b> to a different port number, or a comma-separated list of  port  numbers.   If  a
              non-default  port  is  used  when <b>pmcd</b> is started, then every monitoring application connecting to
              that <b>pmcd</b> must also have <b>PMCD_PORT</b> set in their environment before attempting a connection.

       The following environment variables are relevant to installations in which <b><a href="../man1/pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger</a></b>(1), the PCP archiver,
       is used.

       <b>PMLOGGER_PORT</b>
              The environment variable <b>PMLOGGER_PORT</b> may be used to change the base TCP/IP port number  used  by
              <b><a href="../man1/pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger</a></b>(1)  to  create  the  socket to which <b><a href="../man1/pmlc.1.html">pmlc</a></b>(1) instances will try and connect.  The default
              base port number is 4330.  When used, <b>PMLOGGER_PORT</b>  should  be  set  in  the  environment  before
              <b>pmlogger</b> is executed.

       <b>PMLOGGER_REQUEST_TIMEOUT</b>
              When <b><a href="../man1/pmlc.1.html">pmlc</a></b>(1) connects to <b><a href="../man1/pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger</a></b>(1), there is a remote possibility of <b>pmlc</b> "hanging" on a request
              for  information  as  a  consequence  of  a  failure  of  the network or <b>pmlogger</b>.  By setting the
              environment variable <b>PMLOGGER_REQUEST_TIMEOUT</b> to a number of seconds, requests  to  <b>pmlogger</b>  will
              timeout after this number of seconds.  The default behavior is to be willing to wait forever for a
              response  from  each  request to a <b>pmlogger</b>.  When used, <b>PMLOGGER_REQUEST_TIMEOUT</b> should be set in
              the environment before <b>pmlc</b> is executed.

       If you have the PCP product installed, then the following  environment  variables  are  relevant  to  the
       Performance Metrics Domain Agents (PMDAs).

       <b>PMDA_LOCAL_PROC</b>
              Use  this  variable has been deprecated and it is now ignored.  If the ``proc'' PMDA is configured
              as a DSO for use with <b><a href="../man1/pmcd.1.html">pmcd</a></b>(1) on the local host then all of the ``proc'' metrics will be available
              to applications using a <b>PM_CONTEXT_LOCAL</b> context.

              The previous behaviour was that if this variable was set, then a context established with the <u>type</u>
              of <b>PM_CONTEXT_LOCAL</b> will have access to the ``proc'' PMDA to retrieve  performance  metrics  about
              individual processes.

       <b>PMDA_LOCAL_SAMPLE</b>
              Use this variable has been deprecated and it is now ignored.  If the ``sample'' PMDA is configured
              as  a  DSO  for  use  with  <b><a href="../man1/pmcd.1.html">pmcd</a></b>(1)  on  the local host then all of the ``sample'' metrics will be
              available to applications using a <b>PM_CONTEXT_LOCAL</b> context.

              The previous behaviour was that if this variable was set, then a context established with the <u>type</u>
              of <b>PM_CONTEXT_LOCAL</b> will have access to the  ``sample''  PMDA  if  this  optional  PMDA  has  been
              installed locally.

       <b>PMIECONF_PATH</b>
              If  set,  <b><a href="../man1/pmieconf.1.html">pmieconf</a></b>(1) will form its <b><a href="../man5/pmieconf.5.html">pmieconf</a></b>(5) specification (set of parameterized <b><a href="../man1/pmie.1.html">pmie</a></b>(1) rules)
              using all valid <b>pmieconf</b> files found below each  subdirectory  in  this  colon-separated  list  of
              subdirectories.  If not set, the default is <b>$PCP_VAR_DIR/config/pmieconf</b>.

</pre><h4><b>PCP</b> <b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       Environment  variables with the prefix <b>PCP_</b> are used to parameterize the file and directory names used by
       PCP.  On each installation, the file <u>/etc/pcp.conf</u> contains the local values for  these  variables.   The
       <b>$PCP_CONF</b> variable may be used to specify an alternative configuration file, as described in <b><a href="../man5/pcp.conf.5.html">pcp.conf</a></b>(5).
