</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       mythtv-status - Display the status of a MythTV backend

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        mythtv-status [options]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This script queries a MythTV backend and reports on the status of it, any upcoming recordings and any
       which are happening right now.

       The intention is to warn you if there is a program being recorded or about to be recorded.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-c,</b> <b>--colour</b>
           Use colour when showing the status of the encoder(s).

       <b>--date</b>
           Set the date to run as, used for debugging purposes.

       <b>-d,</b> <b>--description</b>
           Display the description for the scheduled recordings.

       <b>--disk-space-warn</b>
           The  threshold  (in  percent)  of used disk space that we should show the disk space in red (if using
           colour) or send an email if we're in email mode with email only on warnings.

       <b>--encoder-details</b>
           Display the input ID and channel name against the recording details.

       <b>--encoder-skip-idle</b>
           Suppress displaying idle encoders in the Encoders block.

       <b>--encoder-warn-non-idle</b>
           Display warnings if an encoder is not idle. This is the default, it allows you to know if an  encoder
           or the MythTV system is busy. To disable, use <b>--no-encoder-warn-non-idle</b>.

       <b>-e,</b> <b>--episode</b>
           Display the episode (subtitle) for the scheduled recordings.

       <b>--email</b> <b>&lt;address&gt;[</b> <b>--email</b> <b>&lt;address&gt;</b> <b>...]</b>
           Send  the  output  to the listed email addresses.  By default the encoder status, currently recording
           shows and time till next recording is suppressed from the email.

           To turn the additional blocks on you can use <b>--encoders</b>, <b>--recording-now</b> and/or <b>--next-recording</b>.

           By default highlight is turned on, to disable it use <b>--nohighlight</b>.

       <b>--email-only-on-alert</b>
           Only send an email out (if --email is present) if there is an alert (i.e., schedule conflict  or  low
           disk space).

       <b>-?,</b> <b>--help</b>
           Display help.

       <b>--file</b> <b>&lt;file&gt;</b>
           Load XML from the file specified instead of querying a MythTV backend.  Handy for debugging things.

       <b>--save-file</b> <b>&lt;file&gt;</b>
           Save the XML we received from the MythTV backend.  Handy for debugging things.

       <b>--guide-days-warn</b> <b>&lt;days&gt;</b>
           Warn if the number of days of guide data present is equal to or below this level.  Default is 2 days.

       <b>-h</b> <b>HOST,</b> <b>--host=HOST</b>
           The host to check, defaults to localhost.

       <b>--highlight</b>
           Surround  any items that are considered a warning with asterisks. This helps to highlight an issue if
           colour mode is disabled.

       <b>--nostatus</b>, <b>--noencoders</b>, <b>--norecording-now</b>, <b>--noscheduled-recordings</b>, <b>--noschedule-conflicts</b>,
       <b>--nonext-recording</b>, <b>--nototal-disk-space</b>, <b>--nodisk-space</b>, <b>--noguide-data</b>, <b>--noauto-expire</b>
           Suppress displaying blocks of the output if they would normally be displayed.

       <b>-p</b> <b>PORT,</b> <b>--port=PORT</b>
           The port to use when connecting to MythTV, defaults to 6544.

       <b>--oneliner-bullets</b>
           Insert asterisks (*) before each of the oneliners to  stop  some  email  clients  from  thinking  the
           oneliner block is a paragraph and trying to word wrap them.

       <b>--auto-expire</b>
           Display the shows due to auto expire (output is normally suppressed).

       <b>--auto-expire-count</b>
           How many of the auto expire shows to display, defaults to 10.

       <b>--recording-in-warn</b>
           If  the  "Next  Recording In" time is less than this amount, display it in red.  This in seconds, and
           defaults to 3600 (1 hour).

       <b>--verbose</b>
           Have slightly more verbose output.  This includes any warnings that might be generated while  parsing
           the XML.

       <b>-v,</b> <b>--version</b>
           Show the version of mythtv-status and then exit.

</pre><h4><b>OUTPUT</b></h4><pre>
       The output of this script is broken up into several chunks they are:

       Status
           Some general info about the backend, currently just the timestamp of when this program was run.

       Guide Data
           The  number  of  days of guide data is present.  By default it is only shown if the number of days is
           below the warning level.  To show it regardless of the warning level use --guide-data.

       Encoders
           Each encoder that the backend knows about are listed, with the hostname they are on, the  encoder  ID
           (in brackets) and the current status.

       Recording Now
           Any programs which are being recorded right now.

       Scheduled Recordings
           Up to 10 programs which are scheduled to be recorded today and tomorrow.

       Schedule Conflicts
           Any upcoming schedule conflicts (not just limited to today or tomorrow).

       Shows due to Auto Expire
           The shows which will be deleted and the order they'll be deleted if the auto expirer kicks in.

       Total Disk Space
           The amount of disk space in total, and used by MythTV.

       Next Recording In
           If  there  are no recordings currently happening, then the amount of time until the next recording is
           displayed.

       Disk Space
           Details about each storage group that MythTV knows about.  By default this only shows storage  groups
           that are above the warning level.  Use <b>--disk-space</b> to turn on display of all storage groups.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>CODES</b></h4><pre>
       mythtv-status provides some return codes.

       0   Standard return code
