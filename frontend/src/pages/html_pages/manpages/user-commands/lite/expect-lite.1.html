</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       expect-lite - a quick and easy command line automation tool

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>expect-lite</b> [<u>-vv</u>] <u>-c</u> <u>&lt;script&gt;</u> [<u>-r</u> <u>&lt;host&gt;</u>]  [<u>CONSTANT=value</u>] [<u>*DIRECTIVE</u>] [-h|--help]
       or
       <b>script.elt</b> [<u>-vv</u>]  [<u>r=&lt;host&gt;</u>] [<u>CONSTANT=value</u>] [<u>*DIRECTIVE</u>] [-h|--help]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Written  in  Expect,  it  is  designed to directly map an interactive terminal session into an automation
       script. expect-lite scripts use punctuation character(s) at the beginning of each line  to  indicate  the
       action.  Basic  expect-lite  scripts  can  be  created by simply cutting and pasting text from a terminal
       window into a script, and adding <b>&gt;</b> <b>&lt;</b> characters. Knowledge of Expect is not required.

       usage:    expect-lite    remote_host=&lt;remote_host_IP&gt;    cmd_file=&lt;command_file&gt;    [user_dir=&lt;user_dir&gt;]
       [const1=value1] [*DIRECTIVE]

       or   short   form:   expect-lite   r=&lt;remote_host_IP&gt;   c=&lt;command_file&gt;  [d=&lt;user_dir&gt;]  [const1=value1]
       [*DIRECTIVE]

              eg. ./expect-lite r=host-008  c=pm_alt.elt  d=/local/sw myvar=myvalue *NOCOLOR

       additional login options: user_name=&lt;username&gt; user_password=&lt;password&gt;

              eg. ./expect-lite r=host-008 c=pm_alt.elt u=superuser p=mysecret

       additional debug options: <b>-v</b>|<b>-vv</b>|<b>--verbose</b>

       <b>-v</b>     prints warnings, and infos (i.e. conditionals, dynamic var assignments)

       <b>-vv</b>|<b>--verbose</b>
              prints warnings and debug (i.e. expect match info)

       eg. ./expect-lite -v r=host-008 c=pm_alt.elt

       user defined help options: <b>-h</b>|<b>--help</b>

              displays user defined help text (demarcated by ;;;) and variables defined in script which  can  be
              overridden by constants on the command line

</pre><h4><b>COMMAND</b> <b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       This   is  just a brief synopsis of <u>expect-lite</u> commands to serve as a reminder to those who already know
       <u>expect-lite</u>;  other  documentation  (such  as  the   html   document)   must   be   consulted   for  more
       complete descriptions.

   <b>Special</b> <b>Characters</b>
       &gt;      wait for a prompt, then send string to the remote host

       &gt;&gt;     send string to remote host, without waiting for prompt

       &lt;      string/regex  MUST  be  received  from  the remote host in the allotted timeout or the script will
              FAIL!

       &lt;&lt;     literal string MUST be received (similar to '&lt;' without regex evaluation)

       -&lt;     NOT expect, if string/regex IS received from the remote host the script will FAIL!

       ~&lt;     fuzzy expect, expect an approximate number (decimal or hex)

       #      used to indicate comment lines, and have no effect

       ;      are also used to indicate comment lines, but are printed to stdout (for logging)

       ;&lt;colour&gt; comment
              add custom colour comment lines, colour may be blue, ltblue,  gray,  ltgray,  cyan,  black,  pink,
              purple, red, green, yellow

       ;;     similar to above, but no extra newlines are printed (useful for printing script help)

       ;;;    marks  beginning  and  ending of a block of help text. Help Text is user defined help for a script
              and is printed when -h or --help is on the command line

       @num   changes the expect timeout to num of seconds

       :num   sleeps for num seconds. Mili-seconds also supported e.g. :1.005 is 1005 mili-seconds

       $var=  static variable assignment at script invocation. Variable names limited to letters,  numbers,  and
              underscore

       +$var= dynamic variable assignment

       +$var  increment value of $var by 1 decimal

       -$var  decrement value of $var by 1 decimal

       =$var  math  functions,  perform  bitwise  and  arithmetic  operations:   &lt;&lt; &gt;&gt; &amp; | ^ * / % + - (see math
              functions)

       =$str  string math functions, if $str is a string, perform string operations: //search/replace/ + -  (see
              string math functions in documentation)

       !      indicates an embedded expect line

       ?      c-style if/then/else in the format ?cond?action::else_action. code block are also supported in the
              action and else_action statements. e.g.
                 ?if $i &lt; $n ? [
                    &gt;send string
                    &lt;expect string
                 ]::[
                   &gt;send else string
                   &lt;expect else string
                 ]

       [      While Loop, using code blocks e.g.
                 [ $i &lt; $n
                    +$i
                 ]

              Foreach  Loop, using code blocks, each iteration $item is assigned the next item in the list. List
              <b>must</b> be space delimited e.g.
                 $thelist=ab cd ef
                 [ $item=$thelist
                     &gt;echo $item
                 ]

       %      label - used for jumping to labels

       ~<u>filename</u> [constant=value] [constant=value with spaces]
              includes  a  expect-lite  script  file,  useful  for  creation  of  common  variable   files,   or
              'subprograms/subroutines'.  Can  pass  optional  parameters which will override (as constants) the
              variables in the include file. Constant values passed may have spaces, no quotes are required

   <b>Directives</b>
       *~<u>filename</u>
              Include a fail script, which expect-lite runs only if the main script fails

       */prompt/
              Set a user defined prompt (defined in regex)

       *TERM &lt;N&gt;
              Immediately terminates script, and returns the value of N, if N is not specified returns 0

       *PASS  Immediately terminates script, and returns 0 (pass)

       *FAIL  Immediately fails script, and returns 1 (fail), unless *NOFAIL is set, then  script  will  run  to
              completion, and return 1

       *NOFAIL
              Script  will run to completion, and returns 1, if failure occurred during execution, or 0, if pass
              (it is a sticky flag, and can not be unset)

       **SHELL=&lt;shell&gt;
              Configuration directive which sets the shell immediately after automatic login to remote host (see
              setting the shell)

       *INTERACT
              A breakpoint which places user in interact mode, and pauses the script and turns  control  of  the
              keyboard over to the user

       *NOINTERACT
              Once  set,  will  ignore all succeeding breakpoints (*INTERACT). This permits running a  script or
              scripts in an unattended regression. This can not be unset (it is a sticky flag)

       *FORK &lt;session&gt;
              Multiple session support. Directs expect-lite to open a new session and spawns a new shell

       *SHOW VARS
              Debug information, displays all expect-lite variables. Can be used in interact mode.

       *SHOW ENV
              Debug information, displays expect-lite environment, including state of directives, infinite  loop
              counter, log file name (if used), and environment variables. Can be used in interact mode.

       *INFINITE_LOOP N
              Infinite loop protection value, sets N as new value

       *EOLS LF|*EOLS CRLF
              Controls  end  of  line  sequence sent to remote host, either line feed, or carriage return + line
              feed.

       *DVPROMPT|*NODVPROMPT
              Enable/disable  the   Dynamic   Variable   capture   method   to   require   a   trailing   prompt
              (default=*DVPROMPT).

       *NOINCLUDE
              Once  set,  will ignore all succeeding include files (lines starting with ~). This was the default
              behaviour in Library mode (introduced in v4.1). This behaviour is  no  longer  default,  and  this
              directive provides a method to previous behavior.

   <b>Logging</b>
       Logging  encompasses  two  operations:  1)  writing  script  output  to a file, 2) controlling additional
       messages, such as info, exp_info and warnings. All logging commands when used on the  CLI  will  override
       those inside the script

       *LOG|*NOLOG
              Enable/disable  logging  of  standard  out  and  messages  to  a  file.  The log file name will be
              &lt;script_name&gt;.log saved in the script directory.(see Environment Variable EL_LOG_EXT below)

       *LOG &lt;file_name&gt;|*LOGAPPEND &lt;file_name&gt;
              Enable logging to a user  specified  path/file_name.  When  invoked  on  the  CLI,  the  specified
              file_name must end in ".log" (or as defined by EL_LOG_EXT) to avoid ambiguity

       *INFO|*NOINFO
              Enable/disable informational messages

       *EXP_INFO|*NOEXP_INFO
              Enable/disable "expected" messages (additionally use -V flag to enable)

       *WARN|*NOWARN
              Enable/disable warning messages

       *DEBUG|*NODEBUG
              Enable/disable debug messages

       *NOCOLOR
              Disables color on stdout

       *TIMESTAMP &lt;ISO|YMD|DMY|MDY&gt;
              Prints  Date  and  Timestamp  with  milisecond  accuracy,  for  each command sent, ISO is default.
              Timestamps will be written to log file when *LOG is used.

       *NOTIMESTAMP
              Disables timestamp printing

   <b>Environment</b> <b>Variables</b>
       It is no  longer  necessary  to  hand  edit  the  expect-lite  script  itself.  All  parameters  such  as
       connect_method,  login  name  and  password  are controlled via shell environment variables. This permits
       individual customization in a multi user environment. It is recommended to save these values in  <u>.expect-</u>
       <u>literc</u> and source it from .bashrc or .cshrc. If set, the following environment variables will be used:

       EL_CONNECT_METHOD
              The  method expect-lite uses to connect to remote host. Valid options are: none|telnet|ssh|ssh_key
              Default is none

       EL_CONNECT_USER
              User name to use for login on remote host (telnet|ssh)

       EL_CONNECT_PASS
              Password to use for login on remote host (telnet|ssh)

       EL_INFINITE_LOOP=N
              Infinite loop protection value, sets N to user's default value

       EL_DELAY_WAIT_FOR_HOST
              Delay (in ms) to wait for host in Not Expect, and Dynamic Var Capture. 100 ms is a good value  for
              a local LAN, 200 ms if running across high speed internet

       EL_REMOTE_HOST
              Name or IP of remote host

       EL_CMD_FILE
              Name of expect-lite script to run

       EL_USER_DIR
              Change to this directory upon login before executing script

       EL_SHELL
              Start this shell (default bash) when using EL_CONNECT_METHOD=none

       EL_DYN_VAR_PROMPT
              Set the Dynamic Variable capture method to require a prompt (default=1). Disable by setting to 0.

       EL_LOG_EXT
              Set  the log file name extension string (default=".log") which is appended to the script name when
              using *LOG without file name argument or used to detect a log file name on the command line.

       EL_*   Any other shell environment variables starting with EL_ will become constants

   <b>Debugger</b> <b>(IDE)</b>
       The debugger performs three primary functions: 1) connecting the user to the remote host or device  under
       test,  2) monitoring special commands prefaced with the escape key for stepping, and other functions, and
       3) the debugger will allow expect-lite script lines to be executed by either typing directly  or  pasting
       them into the IDE.

       The  debugger  is  invoked  at  a  breakpoint by placing the *INTERACT command in the script, or using by
       instant-interact at anytime during the script execution by pressing ctrl+backslash ^\

       &lt;esc&gt;s Step, execute next step in script

       &lt;esc&gt;k sKip next step in script

       &lt;esc&gt;c Continue execution of the script

       &lt;esc&gt;v show Vars, display expect-lite variables and values

       &lt;esc&gt;e show Environment, display expect-lite environment

       &lt;esc&gt;0to9
              display next N lines of script

       &lt;esc&gt;-1to-9
              display last N lines of script

       ctrl+d Quit &amp; Exit expect-lite

       &lt;esc&gt;h display Help

       [pasted line(s)]
              execute any pasted line(s) from a script into the IDE

       [type any expect-lite line]
              execute any typed expect-lite script line
