</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       youtube-dl - download videos from youtube.com or other video platforms

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>youtube-dl</b> [OPTIONS] URL [URL...]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>youtube-dl</b>  is  a  command-line program to download videos from YouTube.com and a few more sites.  It re‐
       quires the Python interpreter, version 2.6, 2.7, or 3.2+, and it is not  platform  specific.   It  should
       work  on your Unix box, on Windows or on macOS.  It is released to the public domain, which means you can
       modify it, redistribute it or use it however you like.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       -h, --help
              Print this help text and exit

       --version
              Print program version and exit

       -i, --ignore-errors
              Continue on download errors, for example to skip unavailable videos in a playlist

       --abort-on-error
              Abort downloading of further videos (in the playlist or the command line) if an error occurs

       --dump-user-agent
              Display the current browser identification

       --list-extractors
              List all supported extractors

       --extractor-descriptions

       --force-generic-extractor
              Force extraction to use the generic extractor

       --default-search <u>PREFIX</u>
              Use this prefix for unqualified URLs.  For example "gvsearch2:" downloads two videos  from  google
              videos  for  youtube- dl "large apple".  Use the value "auto" to let youtube-dl guess ("auto_warn‐
              ing" to emit a warning when guessing).  "error" just throws an error.   The  default  value  "fix‐
              up_error" repairs broken URLs, but emits an error if this is not possible instead of searching.

       --ignore-config
              Do  not  read  configuration  files.   When  given  in the global configuration file /etc/youtube-
              dl.conf: Do not read the user  configuration  in  <a href="file:~/.config/youtube-dl/config">~/.config/youtube-dl/config</a>  (%APPDATA%/youtube-
              dl/config.txt on Windows)

       --config-location <u>PATH</u>
              Location of the configuration file; either the path to the config or its containing directory.

       --flat-playlist
              Do not extract the videos of a playlist, only list them.

       --mark-watched
              Mark videos watched (YouTube only)

              Keep the video file on disk after the post-processing; the video is erased by default

       --no-post-overwrites
              Do not overwrite post-processed files; the post-processed files are overwritten by default

       --embed-subs
              Embed subtitles in the video (only for mp4, webm and mkv videos)

       --embed-thumbnail
              Embed thumbnail in the audio as cover art

       --add-metadata
              Write metadata to the video file

       --metadata-from-title <u>FORMAT</u>
              Parse additional metadata like song title / artist from the video title.  The format syntax is the
              same as --output.  Regular expression with named capture groups may also be used.  The parsed  pa‐
              rameters replace existing values.  Example: --metadata-from-title "%(artist)s - %(title)s" matches
              a title like "Coldplay - Paradise".  Example (regex): --metadata-from-title "(?P.+?) - (?P
              .+)"

       --xattrs
              Write metadata to the video file's xattrs (using dublin core and xdg standards)

       --fixup <u>POLICY</u>
              Automatically  correct  known  faults  of  the file.  One of never (do nothing), warn (only emit a
              warning), detect_or_warn (the default; fix file if we can, warn otherwise)

       --prefer-avconv
              Prefer avconv over ffmpeg for running the postprocessors

       --prefer-ffmpeg
              Prefer ffmpeg over avconv for running the postprocessors (default)

       --ffmpeg-location <u>PATH</u>
              Location of the ffmpeg/avconv binary; either the path to the binary or its containing directory.

       --exec <u>CMD</u>
              Execute a command on the file after downloading and post-processing, similar to find's -exec  syn‐
              tax.  Example: --exec 'adb push {} /sdcard/Music/ &amp;&amp; rm {}'

       --convert-subs <u>FORMAT</u>
              Convert the subtitles to other format (currently supported: srt|ass|vtt|lrc)

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       You  can  configure  youtube-dl by placing any supported command line option to a configuration file.  On
       Linux and macOS, the system wide configuration file is located at /etc/youtube-dl.conf and the user  wide
       configuration  file  at  <a href="file:~/.config/youtube-dl/config.">~/.config/youtube-dl/config.</a>  On Windows, the user wide configuration file loca‐
       tions are %APPDATA%\youtube-dl\config.txt or C:\Users\&lt;user name&gt;\youtube-dl.conf.  Note that by  default
       configuration file may not exist so you may need to create it yourself.

       For example, with the following configuration file youtube-dl will always extract the audio, not copy the
       mtime, use a proxy and save all videos under Movies directory in your home directory:

              # Lines starting with # are comments

              # Always extract audio
              -x

              # Do not copy the mtime
              --no-mtime

              # Use this proxy
              --proxy 127.0.0.1:3128

              # Save all videos under Movies directory in your home directory
              -o <a href="file:~/Movies/">~/Movies/</a>%(title)s.%(ext)s

       Note  that  options  in configuration file are just the same options aka switches used in regular command
       line calls thus there <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> <b>whitespace</b> after - or --, e.g.  -o or --proxy but not - o or -- proxy.

       You can use --ignore-config if you want to disable the configuration file  for  a  particular  youtube-dl
       run.

       You can also use --config-location if you want to use custom configuration file for a particular youtube-
       dl run.

   <b>Authentication</b> <b>with</b> <b>.netrc</b> file
       You  may  also want to configure automatic credentials storage for extractors that support authentication
       (by providing login and password with --username and --password) in order not to pass credentials as com‐
       mand line arguments on every youtube-dl execution and prevent tracking plain text passwords in the  shell
       command  history.   You can achieve this using a .netrc file (https://stackoverflow.com/tags/.netrc/info)
       on a per extractor basis.  For that you will need to create a .netrc file in your $HOME and restrict per‐
       missions to read/write by only you:

              touch $HOME/.netrc
              chmod a-rwx,u+rw $HOME/.netrc

       After that you can add credentials for an extractor in the following format, where <u>extractor</u> is the  name
       of the extractor in lowercase:

              machine &lt;extractor&gt; login &lt;login&gt; password &lt;password&gt;

       For example:

              machine youtube login <a href="mailto:myaccount@gmail.com">myaccount@gmail.com</a> password my_youtube_password
              machine twitch login my_twitch_account_name password my_twitch_password

       To  activate authentication with the .netrc file you should pass --netrc to youtube-dl or place it in the
       configuration file.

       On Windows you may also need to setup the %HOME% environment variable manually.  For example:

              set HOME=%USERPROFILE%

</pre><h4><b>OUTPUT</b> <b>TEMPLATE</b></h4><pre>
       The -o option allows users to indicate a template for the output file names.

       <b>tl;dr:</b> navigate me to examples.

       The basic usage is not to set any template arguments when downloading a single file, like  in  youtube-dl
       -o funny_video.flv "https://some/video".  However, it may contain special sequences that will be replaced
       when  downloading  each video.  The special sequences may be formatted according to python string format‐
       ting  operations   (https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#string-formatting).    For   example,
       %(NAME)s or %(NAME)05d.  To clarify, that is a percent symbol followed by a name in parentheses, followed
       by formatting operations.  Allowed names along with sequence type are:

       Each  aforementioned  sequence when referenced in an output template will be replaced by the actual value
       corresponding to the sequence name.  Note that some of the sequences are not  guaranteed  to  be  present
       since  they  depend  on the metadata obtained by a particular extractor.  Such sequences will be replaced
       with placeholder value provided with --output-na-placeholder (NA by default).

       For example for -o %(title)s-%(id)s.%(ext)s and an mp4 video with title  youtube-dl  test  video  and  id
       BaW_jenozKcj,  this  will  result in a youtube-dl test video-BaW_jenozKcj.mp4 file created in the current
       directory.

       For numeric sequences you can use numeric related formatting, for example, %(view_count)05d  will  result
       in a string with view count padded with zeros up to 5 characters, like in 00042.

       Output  templates can also contain arbitrary hierarchical path, e.g.  -o '%(playlist)s/%(playlist_index)s
       - %(title)s.%(ext)s' which will result in downloading each video in a  directory  corresponding  to  this
       path template.  Any missing directory will be automatically created for you.

       To use percent literals in an output template use %%.  To output to stdout use -o -.

       The current default template is %(title)s-%(id)s.%(ext)s.

       In  some cases, you don't want special characters such as 中, spaces, or &amp;, such as when transferring the
       downloaded filename to a Windows system or the filename through an 8bit-unsafe channel.  In these  cases,
       add the --restrict-filenames flag to get a shorter title:

   <b>Output</b> <b>template</b> <b>and</b> <b>Windows</b> <b>batch</b> <b>files</b>
       If  you are using an output template inside a Windows batch file then you must escape plain percent char‐
       acters  (%)  by  doubling,   so   that   -o   "%(title)s-%(id)s.%(ext)s"   should   become   -o   "%%(ti‐
       tle)s-%%(id)s.%%(ext)s".   However you should not touch %'s that are not plain characters, e.g.  environ‐
       ment variables for expansion should stay intact: -o "C:\%HOMEPATH%\Desktop\%%(title)s.%%(ext)s".

   <b>Output</b> <b>template</b> <b>examples</b>
       Note that on Windows you may need to use double quotes instead of single.

              $ youtube-dl --get-filename -o '%(title)s.%(ext)s' BaW_jenozKc

</pre><h4><b>FORMAT</b> <b>SELECTION</b></h4><pre>
       By default youtube-dl tries to download the best available quality, i.e.  if you want  the  best  quality
       you <b>don't</b> <b>need</b> to pass any special options, youtube-dl will guess it for you by <b>default</b>.

       But  sometimes  you may want to download in a different format, for example when you are on a slow or in‐
       termittent connection.  The key mechanism for achieving this is so-called <u>format</u> <u>selection</u> based on which
       you can explicitly specify desired format, select formats based on  some  criterion  or  criteria,  setup
       precedence and much more.

       The  general syntax for format selection is --format FORMAT or shorter -f FORMAT where FORMAT is a <u>selec‐</u>
       <u>tor</u> <u>expression</u>, i.e.  an expression that describes format or formats you would like to download.

       <b>tl;dr:</b> navigate me to examples.

       The simplest case is requesting a specific format, for example with -f 22 you  can  download  the  format
       with  format code equal to 22.  You can get the list of available format codes for particular video using
       --list-formats or -F.  Note that these format codes are extractor specific.

       You can also use a file extension (currently 3gp, aac, flv, m4a, mp3, mp4, ogg, wav, webm are  supported)
       to download the best quality format of a particular file extension served as a single file, e.g.  -f webm
       will download the best quality format with the webm extension served as a single file.

       You can also use special names to select particular edge case formats:

       • best: Select the best quality format represented by a single file with video and audio.

       • worst: Select the worst quality format represented by a single file with video and audio.

       • bestvideo: Select the best quality video-only format (e.g.  DASH video).  May not be available.

       • worstvideo: Select the worst quality video-only format.  May not be available.

       • bestaudio: Select the best quality audio only-format.  May not be available.

       • worstaudio: Select the worst quality audio only-format.  May not be available.

       For example, to download the worst quality video-only format you can use -f worstvideo.

       If  you  want to download multiple videos and they don't have the same formats available, you can specify
       the order of preference using slashes.  Note that slash is left-associative, i.e.  formats  on  the  left
       hand  side are preferred, for example -f 22/17/18 will download format 22 if it's available, otherwise it
       will download format 17 if it's available, otherwise it will download format 18 if it's available, other‐
       wise it will complain that no suitable formats are available for download.

       If you want to download several formats of the same video use a comma as a separator, e.g.   -f  22,17,18
       will  download all these three formats, of course if they are available.  Or a more sophisticated example
       combined with the precedence feature: -f 136/137/mp4/bestvideo,140/m4a/bestaudio.

       You can also filter the video formats by putting a condition in brackets, as in -f "best[height=720]" (or
       -f "[filesize&gt;10M]").

       The following numeric meta fields can be used with comparisons &lt;, &lt;=, &gt;, &gt;=, = (equals), != (not equals):

       • filesize: The number of bytes, if known in advance

       • width: Width of the video, if known

       • height: Height of the video, if known

       • tbr: Average bitrate of audio and video in KBit/s

       • abr: Average audio bitrate in KBit/s

       • vbr: Average video bitrate in KBit/s

       • asr: Audio sampling rate in Hertz

       • fps: Frame rate

       Also filtering work for comparisons = (equals), ^= (starts with), $= (ends with), *= (contains) and  fol‐
       lowing string meta fields:

       • ext: File extension

       • acodec: Name of the audio codec in use

       • vcodec: Name of the video codec in use

       • container: Name of the container format

       • protocol:  The protocol that will be used for the actual download, lower-case (http, https, rtsp, rtmp,
         rtmpe, mms, f4m, ism, http_dash_segments, m3u8, or m3u8_native)

       • format_id: A short description of the format

       • language: Language code

       Any string comparison may be prefixed with negation ! in order to produce an  opposite  comparison,  e.g.
       !*= (does not contain).

       Note  that  none of the aforementioned meta fields are guaranteed to be present since this solely depends
       on the metadata obtained by particular extractor, i.e.  the metadata offered by the video hoster.

       Formats for which the value is not known are excluded unless you put a question mark (?) after the opera‐
       tor.  You can combine format filters, so -f "[height &lt;=? 720][tbr&gt;500]" selects up  to  720p  videos  (or
       videos where the height is not known) with a bitrate of at least 500 KBit/s.

       You  can  merge the video and audio of two formats into a single file using -f &lt;video-format&gt;+&lt;audio-for‐
       mat&gt; (requires ffmpeg or avconv installed), for example -f bestvideo+bestaudio  will  download  the  best
       video-only format, the best audio-only format and mux them together with ffmpeg/avconv.

       Format  selectors can also be grouped using parentheses, for example if you want to download the best mp4
       and webm formats with a height lower than 480 you can use -f '(mp4,webm)[height&lt;480]'.

       Since the end of April 2015 and version 2015.04.26, youtube-dl uses -f  bestvideo+bestaudio/best  as  the
       default   format   selection   (see   #5447  (https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl/issues/5447),  #5456
       (https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl/issues/5456)).  If ffmpeg or avconv are installed this results in
       downloading bestvideo and bestaudio separately and muxing them together into a  single  file  giving  the
       best  overall  quality  available.   Otherwise  it falls back to best and results in downloading the best
       available quality served as a single file.  best is also needed for videos that don't come  from  YouTube
       because they don't provide the audio and video in two different files.  If you want to only download some
       DASH  formats  (for  example  if  you  are not interested in getting videos with a resolution higher than
       1080p), you can add -f bestvideo[height&lt;=?1080]+bestaudio/best to your configuration file.  Note that  if
       you  use youtube-dl to stream to stdout (and most likely to pipe it to your media player then), i.e.  you
       explicitly specify output template as -o -, youtube-dl still uses -f best format selection  in  order  to
       start content delivery immediately to your player and not to wait until bestvideo and bestaudio are down‐
       loaded and muxed.

       If  you  want  to  preserve the old format selection behavior (prior to youtube-dl 2015.04.26), i.e.  you
       want to download the best available quality media served as a single file, you should explicitly  specify
       your choice with -f best.  You may want to add it to the configuration file in order not to type it every
       time you run youtube-dl.

       Note  that in the last example, an output template is recommended as bestvideo and bestaudio may have the
       same file name.

</pre><h4><b>VIDEO</b> <b>SELECTION</b></h4><pre>
       Videos can be filtered by their upload date using the options --date, --datebefore or --dateafter.   They
       accept dates in two formats:

       • Absolute dates: Dates in the format YYYYMMDD.

       • Relative dates: Dates in the format (now|today)[+-][0-9](day|week|month|year)(s)?

       Examples:

              # Download only the videos uploaded in the last 6 months
              $ youtube-dl --dateafter now-6months

              # Download only the videos uploaded on January 1, 1970
              $ youtube-dl --date 19700101

              $ # Download only the videos uploaded in the 200x decade
              $ youtube-dl --dateafter 20000101 --datebefore 20091231

</pre><h4><b>FAQ</b></h4><pre>
   <b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>update</b> <b>youtube-dl?</b>
       If  you've  followed  our  manual  installation instructions (https://ytdl-org.github.io/youtube-dl/down‐
       load.html), you can simply run youtube-dl -U (or, on Linux, sudo youtube-dl -U).

       If you have used pip, a simple sudo pip install -U youtube-dl is sufficient to update.

       If you have installed youtube-dl using a package manager like <u>apt-get</u> or <u>yum</u>, use the standard system up‐
       date mechanism to update.  Note that distribution packages are often  outdated.   As  a  rule  of  thumb,
       youtube-dl  releases  at  least  once  a month, and often weekly or even daily.  Simply go to https://yt-
       dl.org to find out the current version.  Unfortunately, there is nothing we youtube-dl developers can  do
       if  your  distribution serves a really outdated version.  You can (and should) complain to your distribu‐
       tion in their bugtracker or support forum.

       As a last resort, you can also uninstall the version installed by your package  manager  and  follow  our
       manual installation instructions.  For that, remove the distribution's package, with a line like

              sudo apt-get remove -y youtube-dl

       Afterwards,  simply  follow  our  manual  installation  instructions (https://ytdl-org.github.io/youtube-
       dl/download.html):

              sudo wget https://yt-dl.org/downloads/latest/youtube-dl -O /usr/local/bin/youtube-dl
              sudo chmod a+rx /usr/local/bin/youtube-dl
              hash -r

       Again, from then on you'll be able to update with sudo youtube-dl -U.

   <b>I'm</b> <b>getting</b> <b>an</b> <b>error</b> <b>Unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>extract</b> <b>OpenGraph</b> <b>title</b> on YouTube playlists
       YouTube changed their playlist format in March 2014 and later on, so  you'll  need  at  least  youtube-dl
       2014.07.25 to download all YouTube videos.

       If  you  have installed youtube-dl with a package manager, pip, setup.py or a tarball, please use that to
       update.  Note that Ubuntu packages do not seem to get updated anymore.  Since we are not affiliated  with
       Ubuntu,  there  is  little  we  can  do.   Feel  free  to  report  bugs (https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubun‐
       tu/+source/youtube-dl/+filebug) to the Ubuntu packaging people  (<a href="mailto:ubuntu-motu@lists.ubuntu.com">mailto:ubuntu-motu@lists.ubuntu.com</a>?sub‐
       ject=outdated%20version%20of%20youtube-dl)  - all they have to do is update the package to a somewhat re‐
       cent version.  See above for a way to update.

   <b>I'm</b> <b>getting</b> <b>an</b> <b>error</b> <b>when</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>output</b> <b>template:</b> <b>error:</b> <b>using</b> <b>output</b> <b>template</b>  <b>conflicts</b>  <b>with</b>  <b>using</b>

       Make  sure  you  are not using -o with any of these options -t, --title, --id, -A or --auto-number set in
       command line or in a configuration file.  Remove the latter if any.

   <b>Do</b> <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>-citw</b>?
       By default, youtube-dl intends to have the best options (incidentally, if you have a convincing case that
       these should be different, please file an issue where you explain that (https://yt-dl.org/bug)).   There‐
       fore,  it is unnecessary and sometimes harmful to copy long option strings from webpages.  In particular,
       the only option out of -citw that is regularly useful is -i.

   <b>Can</b> <b>you</b> <b>please</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> <b>-b</b> option back?
       Most people asking this question are not aware that youtube-dl now defaults to  downloading  the  highest
       available  quality  as  reported  by YouTube, which will be 1080p or 720p in some cases, so you no longer
       need the -b option.  For some specific videos, maybe YouTube does not report them to be  available  in  a
       specific  high  quality  format you're interested in.  In that case, simply request it with the -f option
       and youtube-dl will try to download it.

   <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>HTTP</b> <b>error</b> <b>402</b> <b>when</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>download</b> <b>a</b> <b>video.</b> <b>What's</b> <b>this?</b>
       Apparently YouTube requires you to pass a CAPTCHA test if you download too much.   We're  considering  to
       provide  a  way  to let you solve the CAPTCHA (https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl/issues/154), but at
       the moment, your best course of action is pointing a web browser to the youtube URL, solving the CAPTCHA,
       and restart youtube-dl.

   <b>Do</b> <b>I</b> <b>need</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> <b>programs?</b>
       youtube-dl works fine on its own on most sites.  However, if you want to convert video/audio, you'll need
       avconv (https://libav.org/) or ffmpeg (https://www.ffmpeg.org/).  On some sites - most notably YouTube  -
       videos  can  be  retrieved  in a higher quality format without sound.  youtube-dl will detect whether av‐
       conv/ffmpeg is present and automatically pick the best option.

       Videos or video formats streamed via RTMP protocol can only be downloaded  when  rtmpdump  (https://rtmp‐
       dump.mplayerhq.hu/)   is   installed.    Downloading   MMS   and  RTSP  videos  requires  either  mplayer
       (https://mplayerhq.hu/) or mpv (https://mpv.io/) to be installed.

   <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>downloaded</b> <b>a</b> <b>video</b> <b>but</b> <b>how</b> <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>play</b> <b>it?</b>
       Once the  video  is  fully  downloaded,  use  any  video  player,  such  as  mpv  (https://mpv.io/),  vlc
       (https://www.videolan.org/) or mplayer (https://www.mplayerhq.hu/).

   <b>I</b> <b>extracted</b> <b>a</b> <b>video</b> <b>URL</b> <b>with</b> <b>-g</b>, but it does not play on another machine / in my web browser.
       It  depends  a lot on the service.  In many cases, requests for the video (to download/play it) must come
       from the same IP address and with the same cookies and/or HTTP headers.   Use  the  --cookies  option  to
       write  the required cookies into a file, and advise your downloader to read cookies from that file.  Some
       sites also require a common user agent to be used, use  --dump-user-agent  to  see  the  one  in  use  by
       youtube-dl.   You  can also get necessary cookies and HTTP headers from JSON output obtained with --dump-
       json.

       It may be beneficial to use IPv6; in some cases, the restrictions are only applied to  IPv4.   Some  ser‐
       vices  (sometimes  only  for  a subset of videos) do not restrict the video URL by IP address, cookie, or
       user-agent, but these are the exception rather than the rule.

       Please bear in mind that some URL protocols are <b>not</b> supported by browsers out of the box, including RTMP.
       If you are using -g, your own downloader must support these as well.

       If you want to play the video on a machine that is not running youtube-dl, you can relay the  video  con‐
       tent from the machine that runs youtube-dl.  You can use -o - to let youtube-dl stream a video to stdout,
       or simply allow the player to download the files written by youtube-dl in turn.

   <b>ERROR:</b> <b>no</b> <b>fmt_url_map</b> <b>or</b> <b>conn</b> <b>information</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> <b>video</b> <b>info</b>
       YouTube  has  switched  to a new video info format in July 2011 which is not supported by old versions of
       youtube-dl.  See above for how to update youtube-dl.

   <b>ERROR:</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>download</b> <b>video</b>
       YouTube requires an additional signature since September 2012 which is not supported by old  versions  of
       youtube-dl.  See above for how to update youtube-dl.

   <b>Video</b>  <b>URL</b>  <b>contains</b> <b>an</b> <b>ampersand</b> <b>and</b> <b>I'm</b> <b>getting</b> <b>some</b> <b>strange</b> <b>output</b> <b>[1]</b> <b>2839</b> or 'v' is not recognized as an
       internal or external command
       That's actually the output from your shell.  Since ampersand is one of the special shell characters  it's
       interpreted  by the shell preventing you from passing the whole URL to youtube-dl.  To disable your shell
       from interpreting the ampersands (or any other special characters) you have to either put the  whole  URL
       in quotes or escape them with a backslash (which approach will work depends on your shell).

       For example if your URL is https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=4&amp;v=BaW_jenozKc you should end up with follow‐
       ing command:

       youtube-dl 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=4&amp;v=BaW_jenozKc'

       or

       youtube-dl https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=4\&amp;v=BaW_jenozKc

       For Windows you have to use the double quotes:

       youtube-dl "https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=4&amp;v=BaW_jenozKc"

   <b>ExtractorError:</b> <b>Could</b> <b>not</b> <b>find</b> <b>JS</b> <b>function</b> <b>u'OF'</b>
       In  February  2015,  the new YouTube player contained a character sequence in a string that was misinter‐
       preted by old versions of youtube-dl.  See above for how to update youtube-dl.

   <b>HTTP</b> <b>Error</b> <b>429:</b> <b>Too</b> <b>Many</b> <b>Requests</b> <b>or</b> <b>402:</b> <b>Payment</b> <b>Required</b>
       These two error codes indicate that the service is blocking your IP address because of overuse.   Usually
       this  is  a soft block meaning that you can gain access again after solving CAPTCHA.  Just open a browser
       and solve a CAPTCHA the service suggests you and after that pass cookies to  youtube-dl.   Note  that  if
       your  machine  has  multiple  external  IPs then you should also pass exactly the same IP you've used for
       solving CAPTCHA with --source-address.  Also you may need to pass a User-Agent HTTP header of your brows‐
       er with --user-agent.

       If this is not the case (no CAPTCHA suggested to solve by the service) then you can contact  the  service
       and ask them to unblock your IP address, or - if you have acquired a whitelisted IP address already - use
       the --proxy or --source-address options to select another IP address.

   <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>this</b> <b>binary</b> <b>file?</b> <b>Where</b> <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>code</b> <b>gone?</b>
       Since June 2012 (#342 (https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl/issues/342)) youtube-dl is packed as an ex‐
       ecutable  zipfile, simply unzip it (might need renaming to youtube-dl.zip first on some systems) or clone
       the git repository, as laid out above.  If you  modify  the  code,  you  can  run  it  by  executing  the
       __main__.py file.  To recompile the executable, run make youtube-dl.

   <b>The</b> <b>exe</b> <b>throws</b> <b>an</b> <b>error</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>missing</b> <b>MSVCR100.dll</b>
       To  run  the  exe  you need to install first the Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Service Pack 1 Redistributable
       Package  (x86)  (https://download.microsoft.com/download/1/6/5/165255E7-1014-4D0A-B094-B6A430A6BFFC/vcre‐
       dist_x86.exe).

   <b>On</b> <b>Windows,</b> <b>how</b> <b>should</b> <b>I</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> <b>ffmpeg</b> <b>and</b> <b>youtube-dl?</b> <b>Where</b> <b>should</b> <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> <b>exe</b> <b>files?</b>
       If  you  put  youtube-dl  and  ffmpeg in the same directory that you're running the command from, it will
       work, but that's rather cumbersome.

       To make a different directory work - either for ffmpeg, or for youtube-dl, or for both  -  simply  create
       the  directory (say, C:\bin, or C:\Users\&lt;User name&gt;\bin), put all the executables directly in there, and
       then set your PATH environment variable (https://www.java.com/en/download/help/path.xml) to include  that
       directory.

       From  then  on,  after  restarting your shell, you will be able to access both youtube-dl and ffmpeg (and
       youtube-dl will be able to find ffmpeg) by simply typing youtube-dl or ffmpeg, no matter  what  directory
       you're in.

   <b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>downloads</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>specific</b> <b>folder?</b>
       Use  the  -o  to specify an output template, for example -o "/home/user/videos/%(title)s-%(id)s.%(ext)s".
       If you want this for all of your downloads, put the option into your configuration file.

   <b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>download</b> <b>a</b> <b>video</b> <b>starting</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>-</b>?
       Either prepend https://www.youtube.com/watch?v= or separate the ID from the options with --:

              youtube-dl -- -wNyEUrxzFU
              youtube-dl "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wNyEUrxzFU"

   <b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>pass</b> <b>cookies</b> <b>to</b> <b>youtube-dl?</b>
       Use the --cookies option, for example --cookies /path/to/cookies/file.txt.

       In order to extract cookies from browser use any conforming browser extension for exporting cookies.  For
       example,  Get   cookies.txt   (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/get-cookiestxt/bgaddhkoddajcdgo‐
       cldbbfleckgcbcid/)  (for  Chrome) or cookies.txt (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/cookies-
       txt/) (for Firefox).

       Note that the cookies file must be in Mozilla/Netscape format and the first line of the cookies file must
       be either # HTTP Cookie File or # Netscape HTTP Cookie File.  Make sure you have correct  newline  format
       (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newline)  in  the cookies file and convert newlines if necessary to corre‐
       spond with your OS, namely CRLF (\r\n) for Windows and LF (\n) for Unix and Unix-like systems (Linux, ma‐
       cOS, etc.).  HTTP Error 400: Bad Request when using --cookies is a good sign of invalid newline format.

       Passing cookies to youtube-dl is a good way to workaround login when a particular extractor does not  im‐
       plement  it  explicitly.   Another  use  case  is  working  around  CAPTCHA (https://en.wikipedia.org/wi‐
       ki/CAPTCHA) some websites require you to solve in particular cases in order to get access (e.g.  YouTube,
       CloudFlare).

   <b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>stream</b> <b>directly</b> <b>to</b> <b>media</b> <b>player?</b>
       You will first need to tell youtube-dl to stream media to stdout with -o -,  and  also  tell  your  media
       player to read from stdin (it must be capable of this for streaming) and then pipe former to latter.  For
       example, streaming to vlc (https://www.videolan.org/) can be achieved with:

              youtube-dl -o - "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaW_jenozKcj" | vlc -

   <b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>download</b> <b>only</b> <b>new</b> <b>videos</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>playlist?</b>
       Use download-archive feature.  With this feature you should initially download the complete playlist with
       --download-archive /path/to/download/archive/file.txt that will record identifiers of all the videos in a
       special  file.   Each  subsequent  run with the same --download-archive will download only new videos and
       skip all videos that have been downloaded before.  Note that only successful downloads  are  recorded  in
       the file.

       For example, at first,

              youtube-dl --download-archive archive.txt "https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwiyx1dc3P2JR9N8gQaQN_BCvlSlap7re"

       will  download  the  complete  PLwiyx1dc3P2JR9N8gQaQN_BCvlSlap7re playlist and create a file archive.txt.
       Each subsequent run will only download new videos if any:

              youtube-dl --download-archive archive.txt "https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwiyx1dc3P2JR9N8gQaQN_BCvlSlap7re"

   <b>Should</b> <b>I</b> <b>add</b> <b>--hls-prefer-native</b> into my config?
       When youtube-dl detects an HLS video, it can download it either with the built-in downloader  or  ffmpeg.
       Since  many  HLS streams are slightly invalid and ffmpeg/youtube-dl each handle some invalid cases better
       than the other, there is an option to switch the downloader if needed.

       When youtube-dl knows that one particular downloader works better for a given  website,  that  downloader
       will  be picked.  Otherwise, youtube-dl will pick the best downloader for general compatibility, which at
       the moment happens to be ffmpeg.  This choice may change in future versions of youtube-dl, with  improve‐
       ments of the built-in downloader and/or ffmpeg.

       In  particular,  the  generic  extractor (used when your website is not in the list of supported sites by
       youtube-dl (https://ytdl-org.github.io/youtube-dl/supportedsites.html) cannot mandate one specific  down‐
       loader.

       If  you put either --hls-prefer-native or --hls-prefer-ffmpeg into your configuration, a different subset
       of videos will fail to download correctly.  Instead, it is much better  to  file  an  issue  (https://yt-
       dl.org/bug)  or  a  pull  request  which  details why the native or the ffmpeg HLS downloader is a better
       choice for your use case.

   <b>Can</b> <b>you</b> <b>add</b> <b>support</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>anime</b> <b>video</b> <b>site,</b> <b>or</b> <b>site</b> <b>which</b> <b>shows</b> <b>current</b> <b>movies</b> <b>for</b> <b>free?</b>
       As a matter of policy (as well as legality), youtube-dl does not include support for services  that  spe‐
       cialize  in infringing copyright.  As a rule of thumb, if you cannot easily find a video that the service
       is quite obviously allowed to distribute (i.e.  that has been uploaded by the creator, the creator's dis‐
       tributor, or is published under a free license), the service is probably unfit for inclusion to  youtube-
       dl.

       A note on the service that they don't host the infringing content, but just link to those who do, is evi‐
       dence  that the service should <b>not</b> be included into youtube-dl.  The same goes for any DMCA note when the
       whole front page of the service is filled with videos they are not allowed to distribute.  A  "fair  use"
       note  is  equally unconvincing if the service shows copyright-protected videos in full without authoriza‐
       tion.

       Support requests for services that <b>do</b> purchase the rights to distribute their content are perfectly  fine
       though.  If in doubt, you can simply include a source that mentions the legitimate purchase of content.

   <b>How</b> <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>speed</b> <b>up</b> <b>work</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>issue?</b>
       (Also  known  as: Help, my important issue not being solved!) The youtube-dl core developer team is quite
       small.  While we do our best to solve as many issues as possible, sometimes that can take quite a  while.
       To speed up your issue, here's what you can do:

       First  of  all, please do report the issue at our issue tracker (https://yt-dl.org/bugs).  That allows us
       to coordinate all efforts by users and developers, and serves as a  unified  point.   Unfortunately,  the
       youtube-dl project has grown too large to use personal email as an effective communication channel.

       Please  read the bug reporting instructions below.  A lot of bugs lack all the necessary information.  If
       you can, offer proxy, VPN, or shell access to the youtube-dl developers.  If you are able  to,  test  the
       issue  from  multiple computers in multiple countries to exclude local censorship or misconfiguration is‐
       sues.

       If nobody is interested in solving your issue, you are welcome to take matters into your  own  hands  and
       submit a pull request (or coerce/pay somebody else to do so).

       Feel  free  to  bump  the  issue from time to time by writing a small comment ("Issue is still present in
       youtube-dl version ...from France, but fixed from Belgium"), but please  not  more  than  once  a  month.
       Please do not declare your issue as important or urgent.

   <b>How</b> <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>detect</b> <b>whether</b> <b>a</b> <b>given</b> <b>URL</b> <b>is</b> <b>supported</b> <b>by</b> <b>youtube-dl?</b>
       For  one,  have  a  look at the list of supported sites.  Note that it can sometimes happen that the site
       changes its URL scheme (say, from https://example.com/video/1234567  to  https://example.com/v/1234567  )
       and  youtube-dl  reports  an URL of a service in that list as unsupported.  In that case, simply report a
       bug.

       It is <u>not</u> possible to detect whether a URL is supported or not.  That's  because  youtube-dl  contains  a
       generic  extractor which matches <b>all</b> URLs.  You may be tempted to disable, exclude, or remove the generic
       extractor, but the generic extractor not only allows users to extract videos from lots of  websites  that
       embed  a video from another service, but may also be used to extract video from a service that it's host‐
       ing itself.  Therefore, we neither recommend nor support disabling, excluding, or  removing  the  generic
       extractor.

       If  you want to find out whether a given URL is supported, simply call youtube-dl with it.  If you get no
       videos back, chances are the URL is either not referring to a video or unsupported.   You  can  find  out
       which  by examining the output (if you run youtube-dl on the console) or catching an UnsupportedError ex‐
       ception if you run it from a Python program.

</pre><h4><b>Why</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>through</b> <b>that</b> <b>much</b> <b>red</b> <b>tape</b> <b>when</b> <b>filing</b> <b>bugs?</b></h4><pre>
       Before we had the issue template, despite our extensive bug reporting instructions, about 80% of the  is‐
       sue  reports  we got were useless, for instance because people used ancient versions hundreds of releases
       old, because of simple syntactic errors (not in youtube-dl but in general shell usage), because the prob‐
       lem was already reported multiple times before, because people did not actually read  an  error  message,
       even if it said "please install ffmpeg", because people did not mention the URL they were trying to down‐
       load and many more simple, easy-to-avoid problems, many of whom were totally unrelated to youtube-dl.

       youtube-dl  is an open-source project manned by too few volunteers, so we'd rather spend time fixing bugs
       where we are certain none of those simple problems apply, and where we can be reasonably confident to  be
       able to reproduce the issue without asking the reporter repeatedly.  As such, the output of youtube-dl -v
       YOUR_URL_HERE is really all that's required to file an issue.  The issue template also guides you through
       some basic steps you can do, such as checking that your version of youtube-dl is current.

</pre><h4><b>DEVELOPER</b> <b>INSTRUCTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Most   users   do   not   need   to   build   youtube-dl  and  can  download  the  builds  (https://ytdl-
       org.github.io/youtube-dl/download.html) or get them from their distribution.

       To run youtube-dl as a developer, you don't need to build anything either.  Simply execute

              python -m youtube_dl

       To run the test, simply invoke your favorite test runner, or execute a test file  directly;  any  of  the
       following work:

              python -m unittest discover
              python test/test_download.py
              nosetests

       See item 6 of new extractor tutorial for how to run extractor specific test cases.

       If you want to create a build of youtube-dl yourself, you'll need

       • python

       • make (only GNU make is supported)

       • pandoc

       • zip

       • nosetests

   <b>Adding</b> <b>support</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>site</b>
       If you want to add support for a new site, first of all <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> this site is <b>not</b> <b>dedicated</b> <b>to</b> <b>copyright</b>
       <b>infringement</b>.   youtube-dl does <b>not</b> <b>support</b> such sites thus pull requests adding support for them <b>will</b> <b>be</b>
       <b>rejected</b>.

       After you have ensured this site is distributing its content legally, you can follow this quick list (as‐
       suming your service is called yourextractor):

        1. Fork this repository (https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl/fork)

        2. Check out the source code with:

                   git clone <a href="mailto:git@github.com">git@github.com</a>:YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/youtube-dl.git

        3. Start a new git branch with

                   cd youtube-dl
                   git checkout -b yourextractor

        4. Start with this simple template and save it to youtube_dl/extractor/yourextractor.py:

                          }

        5. Add an import in youtube_dl/extractor/extractors.py (https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl/blob/mas‐
           ter/youtube_dl/extractor/extractors.py).

        6. Run python test/test_download.py TestDownload.test_YourExtractor.  This <u>should</u> <u>fail</u> at first, but you
           can continually re-run it until you're done.  If you decide to add more than one  test,  then  rename
           _TEST  to  _TESTS  and  make  it into a list of dictionaries.  The tests will then be named TestDown‐
           load.test_YourExtractor, TestDownload.test_YourExtractor_1,  TestDownload.test_YourExtractor_2,  etc.
           Note that tests with only_matching key in test's dict are not counted in.

        7. Have   a  look  at  youtube_dl/extractor/common.py  (https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl/blob/mas‐
           ter/youtube_dl/extractor/common.py) for possible helper methods and a detailed  description  of  what
           your      extractor      should      and     may     return     (https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-
           dl/blob/7f41a598b3fba1bcab2817de64a08941200aa3c8/youtube_dl/extractor/common.py#L94-L303).  Add tests
           and code for as many as you want.

        8. Make  sure  your  code  follows  youtube-dl  coding  conventions  and  check  the  code  with  flake8
           (https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/index.html#quickstart):

                   $ flake8 youtube_dl/extractor/yourextractor.py

        9. Make  sure  your  code works under all Python (https://www.python.org/) versions claimed supported by
           youtube-dl, namely 2.6, 2.7, and 3.2+.

       10. When the tests pass, add (https://git-scm.com/docs/git-add) the new files  and  commit  (https://git-
           scm.com/docs/git-commit) them and push (https://git-scm.com/docs/git-push) the result, like this:

                  $ git add youtube_dl/extractor/extractors.py
                  $ git add youtube_dl/extractor/yourextractor.py
                  $ git commit -m '[yourextractor] Add new extractor'
                  $ git push origin yourextractor

       11. Finally,  create  a  pull  request (https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request).  We'll
           then review and merge it.

       In any case, thank you very much for your contributions!

   <b>youtube-dl</b> <b>coding</b> <b>conventions</b>
       This section introduces a guide lines for writing idiomatic, robust and future-proof extractor code.

       Extractors are very fragile by nature since they depend on the layout of the source data provided by  3rd
       party  media  hosters  out  of your control and this layout tends to change.  As an extractor implementer
       your task is not only to write code that will extract media links and metadata correctly but also to min‐
       imize dependency on the source's layout and even to make the code foresee potential future changes and be
       ready for that.  This is important because it will allow the extractor  not  to  break  on  minor  layout
       changes thus keeping old youtube-dl versions working.  Even though this breakage issue is easily fixed by
       emitting  a new version of youtube-dl with a fix incorporated, all the previous versions become broken in
       all repositories and distros' packages that may not be so prompt in fetching the update from  us.   Need‐
       less to say, some non rolling release distros may never receive an update at all.

   <b>Mandatory</b> <b>and</b> <b>optional</b> <b>metafields</b>
       For  extraction  to work youtube-dl relies on metadata your extractor extracts and provides to youtube-dl
       expressed      by       an       information       dictionary       (https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-
       dl/blob/7f41a598b3fba1bcab2817de64a08941200aa3c8/youtube_dl/extractor/common.py#L94-L303)  or simply <u>info</u>
       <u>dict</u>.  Only the following meta fields in the <u>info</u> <u>dict</u> are considered mandatory for a successful  extrac‐
       tion process by youtube-dl:

       • id (media identifier)

       • title (media title)

       • url (media download URL) or formats

       In  fact  only the last option is technically mandatory (i.e.  if you can't figure out the download loca‐
       tion of the media the extraction does not make any sense).  But by convention youtube-dl also  treats  id
       and  title  as  mandatory.   Thus the aforementioned metafields are the critical data that the extraction
       does not make any sense without and if any of them fail to be extracted then the extractor is  considered
       completely broken.

       Any                              field                              (https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-
       dl/blob/7f41a598b3fba1bcab2817de64a08941200aa3c8/youtube_dl/extractor/common.py#L188-L303) apart from the
       aforementioned ones are considered <b>optional</b>.  That means that extraction should be <b>tolerant</b> to situations
       when sources for these fields can potentially be unavailable (even if they are always  available  at  the
       moment) and <b>future-proof</b> in order not to break the extraction of general purpose mandatory fields.

   <b>Example</b>
       Say  you  have some source dictionary meta that you've fetched as JSON with HTTP request and it has a key
       summary:

              meta = self._download_json(url, video_id)

       Assume at this point meta's layout is:

              {
                  ...
                  "summary": "some fancy summary text",
                  ...
              }

       Assume you want to extract summary and put it into the resulting info dict  as  description.   Since  de‐
       scription  is an optional meta field you should be ready that this key may be missing from the meta dict,
       so that you should extract it like:

              description = meta.get('summary')  # correct

       and not like:

              description = meta['summary']  # incorrect

       The latter will break extraction process with KeyError if summary disappears from meta at some later time
       but with the former approach extraction will just go ahead with description set to None which is perfect‐
       ly fine (remember None is equivalent to the absence of data).

       Similarly, you should pass fatal=False when extracting optional data from a webpage  with  _search_regex,
       _html_search_regex or similar methods, for instance:

              description = self._search_regex(
                  r'&lt;span[^&gt;]+id="title"[^&gt;]*&gt;([^&lt;]+)&lt;',
                  webpage, 'description', fatal=False)

       With fatal set to False if _search_regex fails to extract description it will emit a warning and continue
       extraction.

       You can also pass default=&lt;some fallback value&gt;, for example:

              description = self._search_regex(
                  r'&lt;span[^&gt;]+id="title"[^&gt;]*&gt;([^&lt;]+)&lt;',
                  webpage, 'description', default=None)

       On  failure this code will silently continue the extraction with description set to None.  That is useful
       for metafields that may or may not be present.

   <b>Provide</b> <b>fallbacks</b>
       When extracting metadata try to do so from multiple sources.  For example if title is present in  several
       places,  try  extracting from at least some of them.  This makes it more future-proof in case some of the
       sources become unavailable.

   <b>Example</b>
       Say meta from the previous example has a title and you are about to extract it.  Since title is a  manda‐
       tory meta field you should end up with something like:

              title = meta['title']

       If  title  disappears  from  meta in future due to some changes on the hoster's side the extraction would
       fail since title is mandatory.  That's expected.

       Assume that you have some another source you can extract title from, for example og:title HTML meta of  a
       webpage.  In this case you can provide a fallback scenario:

              title = meta.get('title') or self._og_search_title(webpage)

       This code will try to extract from meta first and if it fails it will try extracting og:title from a web‐
       page.

   <b>Regular</b> <b>expressions</b>
   <b>Don't</b> <b>capture</b> <b>groups</b> <b>you</b> <b>don't</b> <b>use</b>
       Capturing  group  must be an indication that it's used somewhere in the code.  Any group that is not used
       must be non capturing.

   <b>Example</b>
       Don't capture id attribute name here since you can't use it for anything anyway.

       Correct:

              r'(?:id|ID)=(?P&lt;id&gt;\d+)'

       Incorrect:

              r'(id|ID)=(?P&lt;id&gt;\d+)'

   <b>Make</b> <b>regular</b> <b>expressions</b> <b>relaxed</b> <b>and</b> <b>flexible</b>
       When using regular expressions try to write them fuzzy,  relaxed  and  flexible,  skipping  insignificant
       parts that are more likely to change, allowing both single and double quotes for quoted values and so on.

   <b>Example</b>
       Say you need to extract title from the following HTML code:

              &lt;span style="position: absolute; left: 910px; width: 90px; float: right; z-index: 9999;" class="title"&gt;some fancy title&lt;/span&gt;

       The code for that task should look similar to:

              title = self._search_regex(
                  r'&lt;span[^&gt;]+class="title"[^&gt;]*&gt;([^&lt;]+)', webpage, 'title')

       Or even better:

              title = self._search_regex(
                  r'&lt;span[^&gt;]+class=(["\'])title\1[^&gt;]*&gt;(?P&lt;title&gt;[^&lt;]+)',
                  webpage, 'title', group='title')

       Note how you tolerate potential changes in the style attribute's value or switch from using double quotes
       to single for class attribute:

       The code definitely should not look like:

              title = self._search_regex(
                  r'&lt;span style="position: absolute; left: 910px; width: 90px; float: right; z-index: 9999;" class="title"&gt;(.*?)&lt;/span&gt;',
                  webpage, 'title', group='title')

   <b>Long</b> <b>lines</b> <b>policy</b>
       There  is a soft limit to keep lines of code under 80 characters long.  This means it should be respected
       if possible and if it does not make readability and code maintenance worse.

       For example, you should <b>never</b> split long string literals like URLs or some other  often  copied  entities
       over multiple lines to fit this limit:

       Correct:

              'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqZTN594JQw&amp;list=PLMYEtVRpaqY00V9W81Cwmzp6N6vZqfUKD4'

       Incorrect:

              'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqZTN594JQw&amp;list='
              'PLMYEtVRpaqY00V9W81Cwmzp6N6vZqfUKD4'

   <b>Inline</b> <b>values</b>
       Extracting variables is acceptable for reducing code duplication and improving readability of complex ex‐
       pressions.   However,  you  should  avoid extracting variables used only once and moving them to opposite
       parts of the extractor file, which makes reading the linear flow difficult.

   <b>Example</b>
       Correct:

              title = self._html_search_regex(r'&lt;title&gt;([^&lt;]+)&lt;/title&gt;', webpage, 'title')

       Incorrect:

              TITLE_RE = r'&lt;title&gt;([^&lt;]+)&lt;/title&gt;'
              # ...some lines of code...
              title = self._html_search_regex(TITLE_RE, webpage, 'title')

   <b>Collapse</b> <b>fallbacks</b>
       Multiple fallback values can quickly become unwieldy.  Collapse multiple fallback values  into  a  single
       expression via a list of patterns.

   <b>Example</b>
       Good:

              description = self._html_search_meta(
                  ['og:description', 'description', 'twitter:description'],
                  webpage, 'description', default=None)

       Unwieldy:

              description = (
                  self._og_search_description(webpage, default=None)
                  or self._html_search_meta('description', webpage, default=None)
                  or self._html_search_meta('twitter:description', webpage, default=None))

       Methods   supporting  list  of  patterns  are:  _search_regex,  _html_search_regex,  _og_search_property,
       _html_search_meta.

   <b>Trailing</b> <b>parentheses</b>
       Always move trailing parentheses after the last argument.

   <b>Example</b>
       Correct:

                  lambda x: x['ResultSet']['Result'][0]['VideoUrlSet']['VideoUrl'],
                  list)

       Incorrect:

                  lambda x: x['ResultSet']['Result'][0]['VideoUrlSet']['VideoUrl'],
                  list,
              )

   <b>Use</b> <b>convenience</b> <b>conversion</b> <b>and</b> <b>parsing</b> <b>functions</b>
       Wrap all extracted numeric data into safe functions  from  youtube_dl/utils.py  (https://github.com/ytdl-
       org/youtube-dl/blob/master/youtube_dl/utils.py): int_or_none, float_or_none.  Use them for string to num‐
       ber conversions as well.

       Use url_or_none for safe URL processing.

       Use try_get for safe metadata extraction from parsed JSON.

       Use  unified_strdate for uniform upload_date or any YYYYMMDD meta field extraction, unified_timestamp for
       uniform timestamp extraction, parse_filesize for filesize extraction, parse_count for count  meta  fields
       extraction,  parse_resolution,  parse_duration for duration extraction, parse_age_limit for age_limit ex‐
       traction.

       Explore youtube_dl/utils.py (https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl/blob/master/youtube_dl/utils.py)  for
       more useful convenience functions.

</pre><h4><b>EMBEDDING</b> <b>YOUTUBE-DL</b></h4><pre>
       youtube-dl  makes the best effort to be a good command-line program, and thus should be callable from any
       programming language.  If you encounter any problems parsing its output, feel free  to  create  a  report
       (https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl/issues/new).

       From a Python program, you can embed youtube-dl in a more powerful fashion, like this:

              from __future__ import unicode_literals
              import youtube_dl

              ydl_opts = {}
              with youtube_dl.YoutubeDL(ydl_opts) as ydl:

       Most  likely,  you'll  want  to  use  various  options.   For a list of options available, have a look at
       youtube_dl/YoutubeDL.py                                             (https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-
       dl/blob/3e4cedf9e8cd3157df2457df7274d0c842421945/youtube_dl/YoutubeDL.py#L137-L312).  For a start, if you
       want to intercept youtube-dl's output, set a logger object.

       Here's a more complete example of a program that outputs only errors (and a short message after the down‐
       load is finished), and downloads/converts the video to an mp3 file:

              from __future__ import unicode_literals
              import youtube_dl

              class MyLogger(object):
                  def debug(self, msg):
                      pass

                  def warning(self, msg):
                      pass

                  def error(self, msg):
                      <a href="../manmsg/print.msg.html">print</a>(msg)

              def my_hook(d):
                  if d['status'] == 'finished':
                      print('Done downloading, now converting ...')

              ydl_opts = {
                  'format': 'bestaudio/best',
                  'postprocessors': [{
                      'key': 'FFmpegExtractAudio',
                      'preferredcodec': 'mp3',
                      'preferredquality': '192',
                  }],
                  'logger': MyLogger(),
                  'progress_hooks': [my_hook],
              }
              with youtube_dl.YoutubeDL(ydl_opts) as ydl:
                  ydl.download(['https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaW_jenozKc'])

       The output (including the first lines) contains important debugging information.  Issues without the full
       output are often not reproducible and therefore do not get solved in short order, if ever.

       Please re-read your issue once again to avoid a couple of common mistakes (you can and should use this as
       a checklist):

   <b>Is</b> <b>the</b> <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>itself</b> <b>sufficient?</b>
       We often get issue reports that we cannot really decipher.  While in most cases we eventually get the re‐
       quired  information  after  asking back multiple times, this poses an unnecessary drain on our resources.
       Many contributors, including myself, are also not native speakers, so we may misread some parts.

       So please elaborate on what feature you are requesting, or what bug you want to be fixed.  Make sure that
       it's obvious

       • What the problem is

       • How it could be fixed

       • How your proposed solution would look like

       If your report is shorter than two lines, it is almost certainly missing some of these,  which  makes  it
       hard  for  us to respond to it.  We're often too polite to close the issue outright, but the missing info
       makes misinterpretation likely.  As a committer myself, I often get frustrated by these issues, since the
       only possible way for me to move forward on them is to ask for clarification over and over.

       For bug reports, this means that your report should contain the <u>complete</u> output of youtube-dl when called
       with the -v flag.  The error message you get for (most) bugs even says so, but you would not believe  how
       many of our bug reports do not contain this information.

       If  your  server has multiple IPs or you suspect censorship, adding --call-home may be a good idea to get
       more diagnostics.  If the error is ERROR: Unable to extract ... and you cannot reproduce it from multiple
       countries, add --dump-pages (warning: this will yield a rather large output,  redirect  it  to  the  file
       log.txt  by  adding  &gt;log.txt  2&gt;&amp;1  to your command-line) or upload the .dump files you get when you add
       --write-pages somewhere (https://gist.github.com/).

       <b>Site</b> <b>support</b> <b>requests</b> <b>must</b> <b>contain</b> <b>an</b> <b>example</b> <b>URL</b>.  An example URL is a URL you might want  to  download,
       like  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaW_jenozKc.  There should be an obvious video present.  Except un‐
       der very special circumstances, the main page of a video service (e.g.  https://www.youtube.com/) is  <u>not</u>
       an example URL.

   <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> <b>using</b> <b>the</b> <b>latest</b> <b>version?</b>
       Before reporting any issue, type youtube-dl -U.  This should report that you're up-to-date.  About 20% of
       the  reports we receive are already fixed, but people are using outdated versions.  This goes for feature
       requests as well.

   <b>Is</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>already</b> <b>documented?</b>
       Make sure that someone has not already opened the issue you're trying to open.  Search at the top of  the
       window  or  browse  the GitHub Issues (https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl/search?type=Issues) of this
       repository.  If there is an issue, feel free to write something along the lines of "This  affects  me  as
       well,  with version 2015.01.01.  Here is some more information on the issue: ...".  While some issues may
       be old, a new post into them often spurs rapid activity.

   <b>Why</b> <b>are</b> <b>existing</b> <b>options</b> <b>not</b> <b>enough?</b>
       Before  requesting  a  new  feature,  please  have  a  quick  peek  at  the  list  of  supported  options
       (https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl/blob/master/README.md#options).   Many  feature  requests are for
       features that actually exist already!  Please, absolutely do show off your work in the issue  report  and
       detail how the existing similar options do <u>not</u> solve your problem.

   <b>Is</b> <b>there</b> <b>enough</b> <b>context</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>bug</b> <b>report?</b>
       People  want to solve problems, and often think they do us a favor by breaking down their larger problems
       (e.g.  wanting to skip already downloaded files) to a specific  request  (e.g.   requesting  us  to  look
       whether  the  file  exists  before  downloading the info page).  However, what often happens is that they
       break down the problem into two steps: One simple, and one impossible (or extremely complicated one).

       We are then presented with a very complicated request when the original problem could be solved far easi‐
       er, e.g.  by recording the downloaded video IDs in a separate file.  To avoid this, you must include  the
       greater  context  where it is non-obvious.  In particular, every feature request that does not consist of
       adding support for a new site should contain a use case scenario that  explains  in  what  situation  the
       missing feature would be useful.

   <b>Does</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>involve</b> <b>one</b> <b>problem,</b> <b>and</b> <b>one</b> <b>problem</b> <b>only?</b>
       Some of our users seem to think there is a limit of issues they can or should open.  There is no limit of
       issues  they can or should open.  While it may seem appealing to be able to dump all your issues into one
       ticket, that means that someone who solves one of your issues cannot mark the issue as closed.   Typical‐
       ly, reporting a bunch of issues leads to the ticket lingering since nobody wants to attack that behemoth,
       until someone mercifully splits the issue into multiple ones.

       In  particular,  every  site support request issue should only pertain to services at one site (generally
       under a common domain, but always using the same backend technology).  Do not request support  for  vimeo
       user  videos,  White  house  podcasts, and Google Plus pages in the same issue.  Also, make sure that you
       don't post bug reports alongside feature requests.  As a rule of thumb, a feature request  does  not  in‐
       clude outputs of youtube-dl that are not immediately related to the feature at hand.  Do not post reports
       of a network error alongside the request for a new video service.

   <b>Is</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>need</b> <b>the</b> <b>feature?</b>
       Only post features that you (or an incapacitated friend you can personally talk to) require.  Do not post
       features  because they seem like a good idea.  If they are really useful, they will be requested by some‐
       one who requires them.

   <b>Is</b> <b>your</b> <b>question</b> <b>about</b> <b>youtube-dl?</b>
       It may sound strange, but some bug reports we receive are completely unrelated to youtube-dl  and  relate
       to  a  different,  or even the reporter's own, application.  Please make sure that you are actually using
       youtube-dl.  If you are using a UI for youtube-dl, report the bug to the maintainer of the actual  appli‐
       cation  providing  the UI.  On the other hand, if your UI for youtube-dl fails in some way you believe is
       related to youtube-dl, by all means, go ahead and report the bug.
