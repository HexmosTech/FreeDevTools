</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       ctan-o-mat - Validate and upload a package for CTAN

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       ctan-o-mat [options] [&lt;package configuration&gt;]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This program can be used to automate the upload of a package to the Comprehensive TeX Archive Network
       (https://www.ctan.org). The description of the package is taken from a configuration file. Thus it can be
       updated easily without the need to fill a Web form with the same old information again and again.

       The provided information is validated in any case. If the validation succeeds and not only the validation
       is requested then the provided archive file is placed in the incoming area of the CTAN for further
       processing by the CTAN team.

       In any case any finding during the validation is reported at the end of the processing. Note that the
       validation is the default and a official submission has to be requested by the an appropriate command
       line option.

       <b>ctan-o-mat</b> requires an Internet connection to the CTAN server. Even the validation retrieves the known
       attributes and the basic constraints from the server.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       The default configuration is read from a file with the same name as the current directory an the
       extension .pkg. This file name can be overwritten on the command line.

       The configuration depends on the features currently supported by the CTAN server.  Since these features
       can change over time the configuration is not hard-coded in <b>ctan-o-mat</b>. You can request an empty template
       of the configuration via the command line parameter "--init".

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       -h
       --help
           Print this short summary about the usage and exit the program.

       -i
       --init
           Create an empty template for a configuration.

       --list licenses
           List  the  known  licenses of CTAN to the standard output stream.  Each license is represented as one
           line. The line contains the fields key, name, free indicator.  Those  fields  are  separated  by  tab
           characters.  Afterwards the program terminates without processing any further arguments.

       --config &lt;package configuration&gt;
       --pkg &lt;package configuration&gt;
       --package &lt;package configuration&gt;
           Set the package configuration file.

       -s
       --submit
           Upload the submission, validate it and officially submit it to CTAN it the validation succeeds.

       -v
       --verbose
           Print some more information during the processing (verbose mode).

       --version
           Print the version number of this program and exit.

       --validate
       -n
       --noaction
           Do not perform the final upload. The package is validated and the resulting messages are printed.

       &lt;package&gt;
           This  parameter  is  the  name  of a package configuration (see section CONFIGURATION) contained in a
           file.  If not set otherwise the package configuration defaults to the name of the  current  directory
           with ".pkg" appended.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       The following environment variables are recognized by <b>ctan-o-mat</b>.

       CTAN_O_MAT_URL
           The   value   is   the   URL   prefix   for   the  CTAN  server  to  be  contacted.  The  default  is
           "https://ctan.org/submit". The complete URL is constructed  by  appending  "validate",  "upload",  or
           "fields" to use the respective CTAN REST API.

</pre><h4><b>CONNECTING</b> <b>VIA</b> <b>PROXIES</b></h4><pre>
       If  you need to connect to the Internet via a proxy then this can be achieved by setting some environment
       variables before running <b>ctan-o-mat</b>.  To redirect the request via the proxy simply define an  environment
       variable  "http_proxy"  to  point to the proxy host -- including protocol and port as required. Note that
       the name of the environment variable is supposed to be in <b>lower</b> case.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       â€¢   The program can not be used without a working connection to the Internet.
