</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       botch-multiarch-interpreter-problem - find all arch:all packages that allow switching architectures

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>botch-multiarch-interpreter-problem</b> [-h] [-v] graph.xml

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Given  a package graph, this program outputs a page in plain text format listing all Architecture:all and
       not Multi-Arch:foreign packages that are on a dependency path between two Architecture:any packages.

       More precisely, dose-ceve creates a graph with binary packages and source packages being  the  nodes  and
       their  dependency  and provides relationship being the edges. This program prints all nodes (or packages)
       that fulfill the following criteria:

       the package is not Multi-Arch:foreign
       the package is Architecture:all
       the package has a (possibly transitive) predecessor in the dependency graph that is either an
       Architecture:any binary package or a source package that builds Architecture:any packages
       the package has a (possibly transitive) successor in the dependency graph that is Architecture:any and
       not Multi-Arch:foreign. Traversal of the successors stops at Multi-Arch:foreign packages.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-v,</b> <b>--verbose</b>
           Be verbose.

       <b>-h,</b> <b>--help</b>
           Print help message.

       <b>--packages</b>
           Packages file to retrieve binary package size

       <b>-H,</b> <b>--html</b>
           Output HTML document with additional statistics

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLE</b></h4><pre>
       The graph created by dose-ceve must not contains Build-Depends-Indep dependencies because source packages
       do not have to be cross-built to create their Architecture:all packages. These can always be retrieved by
       native compilation. The graph does not have to include builds-from relationships because the Architecture
       field of source packages is used to determine whether a source  package  builds  Architecture:any  binary
       packages.
