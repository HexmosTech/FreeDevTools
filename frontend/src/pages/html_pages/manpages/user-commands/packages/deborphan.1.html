</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       deborphan - Orphaned package finder

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>deborphan</b> [<u>OPTION</u>] ... [<u>PACKAGE</u>] ...

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>deborphan</u>  finds  packages  that  have  no packages depending on them. The default operation is to search
       within the libs, oldlibs and introspection sections to hunt down unused libraries.

       If it is invoked with an optional list of packages, only the  dependencies  on  those  packages  will  be
       checked.  The  results  are  printed to stdout as if the option <u>--show-deps</u> had been given. Searching for
       specific packages will show the package, regardless of its priority. It is possible to specify <u>-</u>, to read
       a list of packages from standard input.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-f,</b> <b>--status-file=</b><u>FILE</u>
              Use FILE as the status file.

       <b>-h,</b> <b>--help</b>
              Display a short help message and exit.

       <b>-v,</b> <b>--version</b>
              Display version information and exit.

   <b>OUTPUT</b> <b>MODIFIERS</b>
       <b>-d,</b> <b>--show-deps</b>
              Show a list of all installed packages and name the packages that depend on them.

       <b>-P,</b> <b>--show-priority</b>
              Show the priority of the packages found.

       <b>-s,</b> <b>--show-section</b>
              Show the sections the packages are in.

       <b>--no-show-section</b>
              Override showing sections when the default is to show them (see <b>--all-packages</b>).

       <b>-z,</b> <b>--show-size</b>
              Show the installed size of the packages found.

   <b>SEARCH</b> <b>MODIFIERS</b>
       <b>-a,</b> <b>--all-packages</b>
              Check all the packages, instead of only those in the libs section.  Best used (if at all used)  in
              combination with <b>--priority</b>.  This option implies <b>--show-section</b>.

       <b>-e,</b> <b>--exclude=</b><u>LIST</u>
              Excludes the packages named in <u>LIST</u> (a comma separated list) from the evaluation as if they didn't
              exist in the status file.

       <b>-H,</b> <b>--force-hold</b>
              Ignore "hold" dpkg-flags on packages and thus display these packages. Without this option packages
              with  the  "hold"  flag  set  will not be displayed.  Please refer to <b><a href="../man1/dpkg.1.html">dpkg</a></b>(1) for more information
              about package flags. Due a bug in aptitude (Debian bug #137771) hold flags created by aptitude are
              ignored by deborphan.

       <b>--ignore-suggests</b>
       <b>--ignore-recommends</b>
              Do  not  check  if  there  is  a  package  `suggesting'  (<b>--ignore-suggests</b>)   or   `recommending'
              (<b>--ignore-recommends</b>)  the  package.  When both options are used together, deborphan behaves as if
              the `nice-mode' mentioned below has been turned off.

       <b>-n,</b> <b>--nice-mode</b>
              Turn off nice-mode.  Nice-mode checks if there is a package  `suggesting'  or  `recommending'  the
              package.   If  one  is  found, the package will be marked as in use, or, when <b>--show-deps</b> is used,
              print out the package suggesting the package as if it were depending on it.

       <b>-p,</b> <b>--priority=</b><u>PRIORITY</u>
              Show only those packages with a priority equal to, or greater than <u>PRIORITY</u>.  <u>PRIORITY</u> may  be  in
              the  range  of  1–5,  or one of <u>required</u>, <u>important</u>, <u>standard</u>, <u>optional</u>, <u>extra</u>.  Default value for
              <u>PRIORITY</u> is 2 (<u>important</u>).

       <b>--find-config</b>
              This option searches for uninstalled packages which still have configuration files on the  system.
              It implies the <b>-a</b> option.

       <b>--libdevel</b>
              Also search in section "libdevel".

   <b>KEEP</b> <b>FILE</b> <b>MANAGEMENT</b>
       <b>-A,</b> <b>--add-keep</b> <u>PKG1</u> ... <u>PKGn</u>
              Add  packages  to  the list of packages which are never to be reported, regardless of their state.
              You may specify '<b>-</b>' to use standard input. Note that package names are case-sensitive.

       <b>-k,</b> <b>--keep-file=</b><u>FILE</u>
              Use <u>FILE</u> to store the list of kept-back packages.

       <b>-L,</b> <b>--list-keep</b>
              Show the list of packages that are being kept back.

       <b>-R,</b> <b>--del-keep</b> <u>PKG1</u> ... <u>PKGn</u>
              Remove packages from the list of packages which are never to be reported.  You may specify '<b>-</b>'  to
              use  standard input. If there are no dependencies for this package next time <u>deborphan</u> is invoked,
              it will be reported again.

       <b>-Z,</b> <b>--zero-keep</b>
              Purge the entire list of  packages  that  are  being  kept  back.  The  only  option  possible  in
              combination with this option is <b>-A</b>.

   <b>GUESSING</b>
       <b>--guess-*</b>
       <b>--no-guess-*</b>
              deborphan  can try to guess what packages may not be of much use to you by examining the package's
              name and/or description.  It will pretend the package is in the <u>main/libs</u> section, and  report  it
              as  if it were a library.  This method is in no way perfect or even reliable, so beware when using
              this!  It is also possible to tell deborphan e.g., to guess all interpreters but not Perl by using
              <b>--guess-interpreters</b>  <b>--no-guess-perl</b>  or  to  guess  all  but  not  Mono  by  using   <b>--guess-all</b>
              <b>--no-guess-mono</b>.   Please note that the <b>--no-guess-</b> option must occur after the <b>--guess-</b> option it
              modifies, this makes it possible to  declare  more  complex  things  like  to  guess  all,  except
              interpreters but additionally try to guess perl.

       The following options are to be prefixed by <u>--guess-</u> or (except <b>only</b>) by <u>--no-guess-</u>:

       <b>common</b> This option tries to find common packages, i.e. packages with names ending in <u>-common</u>.

       <b>data</b>   This option tries to find data packages, i.e. packages with names ending in <u>-data</u>.

       <b>debug</b>  This option tries to find debugging libraries, i.e. packages with names ending in <u>-dbg</u> or <u>-dbgsym</u>.

       <b>dev</b>    This option tries to find development packages, i.e. packages with names ending in <u>-dev</u>.  Also see
              option <b>--libdevel</b>.

       <b>doc</b>    This option tries to find documentation packages, i.e. packages with names ending in <u>-doc</u>.

       <b>dummy</b>  This  option tries to find dummy packages, i.e. packages with <u>dummy</u> or <u>transitional</u> in their short
              description.

       <b>kernel</b> This     option     tries     to     find     kernel-modules.     It      tries      to      match
              <u>(-modules|^nvidia-kernel)-.*[0–9]+\.[0–9]+\.[0–9]+</u>.

       <b>interpreters</b>
              Try to find all interpreter modules (i.e. imply <b>ruby</b>, <b>pike</b>, <b>python</b>, <b>perl</b> and <b>mono</b>).

       <b>mono</b>   This option tries to find mono libraries. It tries to match <u>^libmono</u>.

       <b>perl</b>   This option tries to find perl modules. It tries to match <u>^lib.*-perl$</u>.

       <b>pike</b>   This option tries to find pike modules. It tries to match <u>^pike[[:digit:]]*-</u>.

       <b>python</b> This option tries to find python modules. It tries to match <u>^python[[:digit:]]*-</u>.

       <b>ruby</b>   This option tries to find ruby modules. It tries to match <u>^lib.*-ruby[[:digit:].]*$</u>.

       <b>section</b>
              This  option  tries to find libraries that were accidentally placed in the wrong section. It tries
              to match <u>^lib</u>, but not if it ends in one of: <u>-dbg</u>, <u>-dbgsym</u>, <u>-doc</u>, <u>-perl</u>, or <u>-dev</u>.

       <b>all</b>    Try all of the above.

       <b>only</b>   Ignore the package's section completely, and just go for the name and/or description. This  option
              must  be  used  in  conjunction with one or more of the <b>--guess</b> options listed above, or deborphan
              will not display anything.
