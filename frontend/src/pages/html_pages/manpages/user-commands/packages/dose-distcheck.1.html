</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       distcheck - check installability of packages according to metadata

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>distcheck</b> [option] ... <u>uri</u>
       <b>debcheck</b> [option] ... [<u>file</u>]
       <b>rpmcheck</b> [option] ... [<u>file</u>]
       <b>eclipsecheck</b> [option] ... [<u>file</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       distcheck  determines,  for  a set of package control stanzas, called the repository, whether packages of
       the repository can be installed relative to the repository according to the inter-package  relationsships
       expressed  in  the  package  control stanzas.  The exact set of relevant control fields and their meaning
       depends on the type of the repository. The constraint solving algorithm is complete, that is it  finds  a
       solution  whenever  there  exists  one,  even  for  multiple  disjunctive  dependencies  and deep package
       conflicts. This problem is computationally infeasible in theory (that is, NP-complete), but can be solved
       very efficiently for package repositories that actually occur in practice.

       Packages are split into foreground and background: only  packages  in  the  foreground  are  checked  for
       installability,  but  dependencies may be satisfied by foreground packages and by background packages. By
       default, all packages are in the foreground.

</pre><h4><b>Input</b> <b>Specification</b></h4><pre>
       Currently supported input types are debian, rpm, and  eclipse.  The  <b>distcheck</b>  tool  expects  its  input
       specifiations  in  the  form  <u>type://pathname</u> where <u>type</u> is one of <b>deb</b>, <b>synthesis</b>, <b>hdlist</b> or <b>eclipse</b>, and
       <u>pathname</u> is the pathname of a file containing the input. The package metadata found  in  that  file  must
       correspond to the <u>type</u> given in the URI.

       When  invoked  as <u>type<b>check</b></u> then the type of input is assumed to be <u>type</u>, and repositories (in positional
       arguments or in the values of options <b>--fg</b> and <b>--bg</b>) are simply given in form of a  pathname  of  a  file
       containing  the  repository.  If  no positional argument is given then input is read from standard input.
       <b>distcheck</b> also accepts compressed files (.gz , .bz2) as positional  arguments.  Input  read  on  standard
       input cannot be in compressed form.

</pre><h4><b>Input</b> <b>Formats</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Debian</b>
       The  input  file has to contain stanzas in the format of <b><a href="../man5/deb-control.5.html">deb-control</a></b>(5), separated by one blank line. For
       instance, the Packages files as found on a Debian mirror server, or in the directory  <u><a href="file:/var/lib/apt/lists/">/var/lib/apt/lists/</a></u>
       of  a  Debian system, are suitable as input to <b>debcheck</b>. Installability of packages is analyzed according
       to their <b>Depends</b>, <b>Conflicts</b>, and <b>Provides</b> fields with their meaning as of Debian  policy  version  3.9.0.
       <b>Pre-depends</b> are treated like <b>Depends</b>, and <b>Breaks</b> are treated like <b>Conflicts</b>.

       If  the input contains several packages with the same values of name, version, and architecture than only
       the last of these is taken into account, and a warning is issued.

       In the case of Debian, it is not possible to install at the same time two packages with the same name but
       different versions.

   <b>Rpm</b>
       The input file can be either a <u>synthesis</u> file or a <u>hdlist</u> file.  By default rpmcheck expects a  synthesis
       file  as  input.  To  specify  a  hdlist  file distcheck must be invoked with a file argument of the form
       hdlist://

   <b>Npm</b>
       The input file is a 822 encoding of an npm repository.

   <b>Opam</b>
       The input file is a 822 encoding of an opam repository.

   <b>Pef</b>
       The input is a generic 822 file. Versions are compared by default using the debian comparing function, or
       if provided the function specified by <b>--compare</b>

   <b>Eclipse</b>
       The input is a 822 file containing the encoding of OSGi plugins  content.xml files.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>MISC</b> <b>OPTIONS</b>
       <b>--version</b>
               Show program version and exit.

       <b>-h,</b> <b>--help</b>
               Display this list of options.

       <b>-v,</b> <b>--verbose</b>
               Enable info / warnings / debug messages.  This option may be repeated up to three times in  order
               to increase verbosity.

       <b>--progress</b>
               Show progress bars.

       <b>--timers</b>
               Show timing information.

       <b>--quiet</b> Do not print warning messages

   <b>DISTCHECK</b> <b>OPTIONS</b>
       <b>-e</b>, <b>--explain</b>
               Give  explanations.  If used together with <b>--failures</b> then the explanation consists of dependency
               chains leading to a conflict or a  dependency  on  a  missing  package.  If  used  together  with
               <b>--successes</b> then the explanation consists of an installation set.

       <b>-m</b>, <b>--explain-minimal</b>
               For  all  packages  <b>P</b>  that are found installable, and when used in conjunction with <b>--successes</b>,
               prints a reduced installation set containing only those packages in the  dependency  cone  of  <b>P</b>.
               When used with Debian repositories, all essential packages and their dependencies that are not in
               the  cone  of  <b>P</b>  are  omitted.   When  used  in  conjunction with <b>--failures</b>, and <b>--explain</b>, all
               dependencies chains are not printed.

       <b>-c</b>, <b>--explain-condense</b>
               Compress explanation graph

       <b>-f</b>, <b>--failures</b>
               List all packages that are found not to be installable.

       <b>-s</b>, <b>--successes</b>
               List all packages that are found to be installable. May be used together with <b>--failures</b>, in this
               case the value of the status field in the output allows one to distinguish installable from  non-
               installable packages.

       <b>--summary</b>
               Gives a more detailed summary of the findings.

       <b>--coinst</b>  <u>package</u> [,<u>package</u>] ...
               Takes  a  comma-separated list of package names, each of them possibly with a version constraint,
               as argument. If this list consists of n  expressions,  then  co-installability  will  be  checked
               independently  for  each  set  of  n  packages where the i-th element of the set matches the i-th
               expression. The initial distinction between foreground and background  is  ignored.  This  option
               must not be combined with <b>--checkonly</b>.

               Example: --coinst "a (&gt;1), b"

               If  we have package a in versions 1, 2 and 3, and package b in versions 11 and 12, then this will
               check 4 pairs of packages for co-installability, namely (a=2,b=11),  (a=2,b=12),  (a=3,b=11)  and
               (a=3,b=12).

       <b>--fields=</b><u>strlst</u>
               Print additional fields if available

       <b>--lowmem</b>
               Serialise multiple distcheck runs to save memory. This might take more time.

   <b>INPUT</b> <b>OPTIONS</b>

       .       <b>pef</b>

       <b>--checkonly</b> <u>package</u> [,<u>package</u>] ...
               Takes  a  comma-separated list of package names, each of them possibly with a version constraint,
               as argument. The foreground is constituted of all packages that match any of the expressions, all
               other packages are pushed into the background. The initial  distinction  between  foreground  and
               background is ignored. This option must not be combined with <b>--coinst</b>.

               Example: --checkonly "libc6 , 2ping (= 1.2.3-1)"

       <b>--latest</b> <u>n</u>
               Consider  only the latest -<u>n</u> most recent versions of each package, older versions of packages are
               ignored.

       <b>--fg=</b><u>file</u>
               Add packages in <u>file</u> to the foreground.

       <b>--bg=</b><u>file</u>
               Add packages in <u>file</u> to the background.

       <b>--compare</b>
               When specified with a <b>pef</b> file, select the comparison function used by the pef -&gt; cudf  encoding.
               Possible                          values                          are                         <b>deb</b>
               (&lt;https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-controlfields.html#s-f-Version&gt;)      ,      <b>semver</b>
               (&lt;<a href="http://semver.org/">http://semver.org/</a>&gt;) , <b>npm</b> (&lt;https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/semver&gt;)

   <b>OUTPUT</b> <b>OPTIONS</b>
       <b>-o,</b> <b>--outfile=</b> <u>file</u>
               Send output to <u>file</u>.

       <b>-d,</b> <b>--outdir=</b> <u>directory</u>
               Set the output directory (default current directory).

       <b>--dot</b>   Save the explanation graph (one for each package) in dot format.

   <b>DEBIAN</b> <b>SPECIFIC</b> <b>OPTIONS</b>
       Multi-arch  annotations  are  correctly considered by distcheck. Packages whose's architecture is neither
       the native architecture nor in the list of foreign architectures (see below) are ignored.

       <b>--deb-native-arch=</b><u>name</u>
               Specify the native architecture. The default behavior is to deduce the native  architecture  from
               the first package stanza in the input that has an architecture different from all.

       <b>--deb-foreign-archs=</b><u>name</u> [,<u>name</u>] ...
               Specify  a comma-separated list of foreign architectures. The default is an empty list of foreign
               architectures.

       <b>--deb-ignore-essential</b>
               Do not consider essential packages as part of the installation problem.  By default all essential
               package are considered as part of the installation problem for all packages, that is a package is
               installable if and only if it is co-installable with all essential packages. This  option  allows
               the user to test the installability with no essential packages installed.

       <b>--deb-builds-from</b>
               Add builds-from relationship of binary packages on source packages as dependency. This allows one
               to create graphs for bootstrapping purposes.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>CODES</b></h4><pre>
       Exit  codes 0-63 indicate a normal termination of the program, codes 64-127 indicate abnormal termination
       of the program (such as parse errors, I/O errors).

       In case of normal program termination:

       - exit code 0 indicates that all foreground packages are found installable;

       - exit code 1 indicates that at least one foreground package is found uninstallable.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLE</b></h4><pre>
       Check which packages in a particular distribution are not installable and why:

        dose-distcheck -v -f -e \
        --bg deb:///var/lib/apt/lists/ftp.fr.debian.org_debian_dists_sid_main_binary-amd64_Packages\
        --bg deb:///var/lib/apt/lists/ftp.fr.debian.org_debian_dists_sid_non-free_binary-amd64_Packages\
        --fg deb:///var/lib/apt/lists/ftp.fr.debian.org_debian_dists_sid_contrib_binary-amd64_Packages

       where Packages is the file pertaining to that distribution,  as  for  instance  found  in  the  directory
       <b><a href="file:/var/lib/apt/lists">/var/lib/apt/lists</a></b>.

       Check which packages in contrib are not installable when dependencies may be satisfied from main:

         debcheck --failures --bg=main_Packages contrib_Packages

</pre><h4><b>NOTE</b></h4><pre>
       Distcheck is a complete reimplementation of edos-debcheck, written for the EDOS project.

</pre><h4><b>AUTHOR</b></h4><pre>
       The  first  version  of debcheck was written by Jerome Vouillon for the EDOS project. The current version
       has been rewritten on the basis of the dose3 library by Pietro Abate.
