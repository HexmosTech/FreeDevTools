</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       equivs-build - make a Debian package to register local software

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>equivs-build</b> <b>[--full|-f]</b> <b>[--source|-s]</b> <b>[--arch=foo|-a=foo]</b> <b>[--templates=bar|-t=bar]</b> <b>controlfile</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>equivs-build</b> is a program that creates Debian packages which can be used to inform dpkg about locally
       installed packages and their dependencies. Also empty packages that just require other packages can be
       created with equivs. These can be used as "profile" packages which just mark other ones for installation.

       Please note that this is a crude hack and if thoughtlessly used, it might possibly do damage to your
       packaging system. And please note as well that using it is not the recommended way of dealing with broken
       dependencies. Better file a bug report instead.

       The control file has a structure like the control files in "real" Debian packages, but it doesn't have to
       define all keys, as default values will be used if you omit one.

       There are several additional fields that can be used:

       Changelog:
           File to be used as the changelog

       Version:
           If  you don't use a local changelog, equivs will create a dummy one. As the version of the package is
           defined in the changelog, equivs will assume the version  1.0.  With  this  field,  you  can  set  an
           explicit version.

       Readme:
           A  file  to be used as the <u>README.Debian</u> file. You can use the strings <b>@packagename@</b> and <b>@depends@</b> to
           insert the package name and the dependency information used.

       Copyright:
           The copyright file to by used. If omitted, the GPL 2 will be used.

       Preinst: Postinst: Prerm: Postrm:
           Maintainerscripts  executed  before/after  installation/removal  of  the  package.  See  the   Debian
           developers reference for a description (package developers-reference).

       Multi-Arch:
           Field specifying multiarch dependency status. Used exactly as in 'real' packages.  Foreign: Satisfies
           dependencies  for  all  architectures  Same:  Satisfies  dependencies  only for the same architecture
           Allowed: Can act as either Foreign or Same, as specified in the dependency

       Extra-Files:
           A comma-separated list of files to copy to the <u>/usr/share/doc/packagename</u> directory.

       Files:
           Files to be copied into some directory of the created package.  Each line contains a source  filename
           and  a  destination  directory, space-separated.  As with other multi-line headers, all lines but the
           first must be indented.  Example:

             Files: foo-cron <a href="file:/etc/cron.d/">/etc/cron.d/</a>
              foo-cron-helper <a href="file:/usr/local/bin/">/usr/local/bin/</a>

       Links:
           Links to be created in some directory of the created package. Each line contains two paths. The first
           is the path that the generated symlink points at; the second is the name of  the  symlink  file  (The
           same  order as 'ln -s').  As with other multi-line headers, all lines but the first must be indented.
           Example:

             Links: /usr/aarch64-linux-gnu/lib/libfoo.so /usr/lib/aarch64-linux-gnu/libfoo.so
              /file/to/symlink/to  /symlink/file/name

       File:
           Files to be copied into some directory of the created package, specified inline in the source control
           file. The field syntax is the name of the files to be created, followed by lines indented by 1  space
           denoting  file content; leading space will be trimmed.  An octal file mode may be specified after the
           filename; it defaults to 644, and will be normalised to 644 or 755.  Example:

             File: /usr/local/bin/true 755
              #!<a href="file:/bin/sh">/bin/sh</a>
              exit 0

       See <u>/usr/share/doc/equivs/README.Debian</u> for more information.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       --full | -f
           Do a complete build. <b>debuild</b> will be called, that is, a  full  package  will  be  built  and  signed,
           suitable for upload to the Debian servers.

           The  ID  used  to  signed  is  taken  from, in that order, the user from the last entry of a supplied
           changelog, the Maintainer: field in the equivs control file, or the local username.

       --source | -s
           Do a source build. <b>debuild</b> will be called, that is, a  source  package  will  be  built  and  signed,
           suitable for upload to the Ubuntu PPA servers.

           The  ID  used  to  signed  is  taken  from, in that order, the user from the last entry of a supplied
           changelog, the Maintainer: field in the equivs control file, or the local username.

       --arch | -a
           Build package for the specified architecture. Used e.g. for building packages for hurd  under  linux.
           <b>equivs-build</b> uses <b>dpkg-architecture</b> to provide this facility.

       --templates | -t
           Build  package  using  alternative  templates  in  the  given directory. By default <b>equivs-build</b> uses
           template files from <b>/usr/share/equivs/template</b>.

           Use with caution, this can break <b>equivs-build</b>.
