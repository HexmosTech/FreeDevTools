</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       dose-builddebcheck - Check if a package can be built on a Debian system

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>dose-builddebcheck</b>  <b>--deb-native-arch=</b><u>name</u> [options] <u>binary-repositories</u> <u>source-repository</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       dose-builddebcheck  determines,  for  a  set  of debian source package control stanzas, called the source
       repository, whether a build environment for the packages of the source repository can be installed on the
       specified native architecture by using packages from the binary repository. For this, only package  meta-
       information  is  taken  into  account:  build-dependencies and build-conflicts in the source package, and
       inter-package relationsships expressed in the binary repository.  The  constraint  solving  algorithm  is
       complete,  that  is  it  finds  a  solution  whenever  there  exists  one,  even for multiple disjunctive
       dependencies and deep package conflicts.  This problem is computationally infeasible in theory (that  is,
       NP-complete),  but  can  be  solved  very  efficiently  for  package  repositories that actually occur in
       practice. Installability of binary packages is  analyzed  according  to  their  <b>Depends</b>,  <b>Conflicts</b>,  and
       <b>Provides</b>  fields  with  their  meaning  as  of  Debian policy version 3.9.0. <b>Pre-depends</b> are treated like
       <b>Depends</b>, and <b>Breaks</b> are treated like <b>Conflicts</b>.

</pre><h4><b>INPUT</b> <b>FORMAT</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>binary-repositories</b>  argument  is  a  list  of  filenames  containing  stanzas  in  the  format   of
       <b><a href="../man5/deb-control.5.html">deb-control</a></b>(5), separated by one blank line. For instance, the Packages files as found on a Debian mirror
       server,  or  in the directory <u><a href="file:/var/lib/apt/lists/">/var/lib/apt/lists/</a></u> of a Debian system, are suitable. The <b>source-repository</b>
       argument is the name of a file containing debian source control stanzas, separated by one blank line. For
       instance, the Sources files as found on a Debian mirror server, or in the  directory  <u><a href="file:/var/lib/apt/lists/">/var/lib/apt/lists/</a></u>
       of  a Debian system, are suitable. <b>binary-repositories</b> and <b>source-repository</b> can be passed in compresssed
       format (.gz , .bz2).

       Multi-arch annotations are correctly considered by dose-builddebcheck. Packages whose's  architecture  is
       neither  the  native architecture nor in the list of foreign architectures (see below) are ignored. Here,
       native and foreign refers at the same time to the architecture on which the compilation will be run,  and
       to  the  host  architecture  of  the  compilation.  Cross-compilation is supported by specifying the <u>host</u>
       architecture.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>MISC</b> <b>OPTIONS</b>
       <b>--version</b>
               Show program's version and exit.

       <b>-h,</b> <b>--help</b>
               This option displays the help message.

       <b>-v,</b> <b>--verbose</b>
               Enable info / warnings / debug messages. This option may be repeated up to three times  in  order
               to increase verbosity.

       <b>--progress</b>
               Print progress bars.

       <b>--timers</b>
               Print timing information.

       <b>--quiet</b> Do no print any messages.

   <b>DISTCHECK</b> <b>OPTIONS</b>
       <b>-e,</b> <b>--explain</b>
               Give  explanations.  If used together with --failures then the explanation consists of dependency
               chains leading to a conflict or a  dependency  on  a  missing  package.  If  used  together  with
               --successes then the explanation consists of an installation set.

       <b>-m</b>, <b>--explain-minimal</b>
               For  all  packages  <b>P</b>  that are found installable, and when used in conjunction with <b>--successes</b>,
               prints a reduced installation set containing only those packages in the  dependency  cone  of  <b>P</b>.
               When used with Debian repositories, all essential packages and their dependencies that are not in
               the  cone  of  <b>P</b>  are  omitted.   When  used  in  conjunction with <b>--failures</b>, and <b>--explain</b>, all
               dependencies chains are not printed.

       <b>-c</b>, <b>--explain-condense</b>
               Compress explanation graph

       <b>-f</b> <b>--failures</b>
               Only show broken packages that fail the installability check.

       <b>-s</b> <b>--successes</b>
               Only show packages that do not fail the installability check.

       <b>--summary</b>
               Gives a more detailed summary of the findings.

   <b>INPUT</b> <b>OPTIONS</b>
       <b>--checkonly</b> <u>package</u> [,<u>package</u>] ...
               Takes a comma-separated list of package names, each of them possibly with a  version  constraint,
               as argument. The foreground is constituted of all packages that match any of the expressions, all
               other  packages  are  pushed  into the background. The initial distinction between foreground and
               background is ignored. This option must not be combined with <b>--coinst</b>.

               Example: --checkonly "libc6 , 2ping (= 1.2.3-1)"

       <b>--latest</b> <u>n</u>
               Consider only the latest -<u>n</u> most recent versions of each package, older versions of packages  are
               ignored.

   <b>OUTPUT</b> <b>OPTIONS</b>
       <b>-o,</b> <b>--outfile=</b> <u>file</u>
               Send output to <u>file</u>.

       <b>-d,</b> <b>--outdir=</b> <u>directory</u>
               Set the output directory (default current directory).

       <b>--dot</b>   Save the explanation graph (one for each package) in dot format.

       <b>--dump=</b><u>file</u>
               Dump the cudf file.

   <b>DEBIAN</b> <b>OPTIONS</b>
       <b>--deb-native-arch=</b><u>name</u>
               Specify the native architecture. This argument is mandatory.

       <b>--deb-host-arch=</b><u>name</u>...
               Specify the host architecture.

       <b>--deb-foreign-archs=</b><u>name</u> [,<u>name</u>] ...
               Specify  a comma-separated list of foreign architectures. The default is an empty list of foreign
               architectures. If <b>--deb-host-arch</b> is set, it is used as an implicit foreign architecture.

       <b>--deb-ignore-essential</b>
               Do not consider essential packages as part of the installation problem.  By default all essential
               package are considered as part of the installation problem for all packages, that is a package is
               installable if and only if it is co-installable with all essential packages. This  option  allows
               the user to test the installability with no essential packages installed.

       <b>--deb-builds-from</b>
               Add builds-from relationship of binary packages on source packages as dependency. This allows one
               to create graphs for bootstrapping purposes.

       <b>--deb-tupletable=</b><u>file</u>
               Path to an architecture tuple table like <a href="file:/usr/share/dpkg/tupletable">/usr/share/dpkg/tupletable</a>

       <b>--deb-cputable=</b><u>file</u>
               Path to a cpu table like <a href="file:/usr/share/dpkg/cputable">/usr/share/dpkg/cputable</a>

       <b>--deb-defaulted-m-a-foreign</b>
               Convert Arch:all packages to Multi-Arch: foreign

       <b>--deb-drop-b-d-indep</b>
               Drop Build-Indep dependencies

       <b>--deb-drop-b-d-arch</b>
               Drop Build-Arch dependencies

       <b>--deb-include-extra-source</b>
               Include packages with Extra-Source-Only:yes (dropped by default)

       <b>-P,</b> <b>--deb-profiles=</b><u>name</u>[,<u>name</u>...]
               Comma separated list of activated build profiles.

       <b>--deb-emulate-sbuild</b>
               Replicate sbuild behaviour to only keep the first alternative of build dependencies.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>CODES</b></h4><pre>
       Exit  codes 0-63 indicate a normal termination of the program, codes 64-127 indicate abnormal termination
       of the program (such as parse errors, I/O errors).

       In case of normal program termination:

       - exit code 0 indicates that all foreground packages are found installable;

       - exit code 1 indicates that at least one foreground package is found uninstallable.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLE</b></h4><pre>
       Compute the list of source packages in  Sources  for  which  it  is  not  possible  to  install  a  build
       environment on i386, assuming that the binary packages described in file Packages are available:

        dose-builddebcheck -v -f -e --deb-native-arch=amd64 \
        /var/lib/apt/lists/ftp.fr.debian.org_debian_dists_sid_main_binary-amd64_Packages\
        /var/lib/apt/lists/ftp.fr.debian.org_debian_dists_sid_main_source_Sources

       Compute  the  list  of source packages for armel in Sources for which it is not possible to install a mix
       build environment on amd64 plus armel, assuming that the binary packages described in file  Packages  are
       available:

        deb-builddebcheck --failures --successes --deb-native-arch=amd64 \
        --deb-foreign-archs=armel,linux-any --deb-host-arch=armel \
        DebianPackages/Sid-amd64-armel-Packages-050812.bz2
        DebianPackages/Sid-Sources-single-version-050812.bz2
