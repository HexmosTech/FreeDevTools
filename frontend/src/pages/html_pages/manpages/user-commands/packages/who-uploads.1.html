</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       who-uploads - identify the uploaders of Debian source packages

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>who-uploads</b> [<u>options</u>] <u>source_package</u> ...

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>who-uploads</b>  uses  the  Package  Tracking System (PTS) to identify the uploaders of the three most recent
       versions of the given source packages.  Note that the uploaders are  identified  using  their  <b><a href="../man1/gpg.1.html">gpg</a></b>(1)  or
       <b><a href="../man1/gpg2.1.html">gpg2</a></b>(1)  keys;  installing  a  recent  version  of  the <u>debian-keyring</u> package should provide most of the
       required keys.

       Note that because the PTS uses source packages, you must give the source package names,  not  the  binary
       package names.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-M</b>, <b>--max-uploads=</b><u>N</u>
              Specify  the  maximum  number of uploads to display for each package; the default is 3.  Note that
              you may not see this many uploads if there are not this many recorded in the PTS.

       <b>--keyring</b> <u>keyring</u>
              Add <u>keyring</u> to the list of keyrings to be searched for the uploader's GPG key.

       <b>--no-default-keyrings</b>
              By default, <b>who-uploads</b> uses the  three  Debian  keyrings  <u>/usr/share/keyrings/debian-keyring.gpg</u>,
              <u>/usr/share/keyrings/debian-nonupload.gpg</u>, and <u>/usr/share/keyrings/debian-maintainers.gpg</u> (although
              this  default  can be changed in the configuration file, see below).  Specifying this option means
              that the default keyrings will not be examined.  The <b>--keyring</b> option overrides this one.

       <b>--date</b> Show the date of the upload alongside the uploader's details

       <b>--nodate</b>, <b>--no-date</b>
              Do not show the date of the  upload  alongside  the  uploader's  details.   This  is  the  default
              behaviour.

       <b>--no-conf</b>, <b>--noconf</b>
              Do  not  read  any  configuration  files.   This can only be used as the first option given on the
              command-line.

       <b>--help</b>, <b>-h</b>
              Display a help message and exit successfully.

       <b>--version</b>
              Display version and copyright information and exit successfully.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       The two configuration files <u>/etc/devscripts.conf</u> and <u><a href="file:~/.devscripts">~/.devscripts</a></u> are  sourced  in  that  order  to  set
       configuration  variables.   Command  line  options  can  be used to override configuration file settings.
       Environment variable settings are ignored for this purpose.  The currently recognised variables are:

       <b>WHOUPLOADS_DATE</b>
              Show the date of the upload alongside the uploader's details.  By default, this is "no".

       <b>WHOUPLOADS_MAXUPLOADS</b>
              The maximum number of uploads to display for each package.  By default, this is 3.

       <b>WHOUPLOADS_KEYRINGS</b>
              This is a colon-separated list of the default keyrings to be used.  By default, it  is  the  three
              Debian  keyrings <u>/usr/share/keyrings/debian-keyring.gpg</u>, <u>/usr/share/keyrings/debian-nonupload.gpg</u>,
              and <u>/usr/share/keyrings/debian-maintainers.gpg</u>.
