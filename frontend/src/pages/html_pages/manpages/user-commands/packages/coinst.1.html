</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Coinst - computes the co-installability kernel of a package repostory

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>coinst</b> <b>[options]</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>coinst</b>  reads  a  package repository in debian format or RPM format from standard input, and computes the
       co-installability kernel of the repository (see below). The graph of the kernel is written in dot  format
       to a file, and a diagnostic is written to standard output. This diagnostic consists by default of:

         - the list of equivalence classes of packages

         - the list of non-installable packages

         - the list of not co-installable pairs of packages

</pre><h4><b>CO-INSTALLABILITY</b> <b>KERNELS</b></h4><pre>
       A  set of packages is called co-installable with respect to a repository R if it can be extended to a set
       of packages from R that  satisfies  all  inter-package  relations  (dependencies,  conflicts,  etc.).  In
       particular, a package p is installable if the set {p} consisting of p only is co-installable.

       This  tool  reduces a repository R to a much smaller one, its so-called co-installability kernel R', that
       behaves exactly the same as far as co-installability of package is concerned: Any set of  packages  P  is
       co-installable with respect to P iff it co-installable with respect to R'. This is achieved by

         - dropping all relations that are not relevant for this purpose. For instance, dependencies that do not
           lead directly or indirectly to any conflicts are dropped.

         - identifying  all  packages that behave the same. For instance, packages that are not in conflict with
           any other package (even not through dependency chains) behave the same since they are  co-installable
           together  with any other co-installable set of packages, and packages that are not installable at all
           behave the same since they may never be part of any co-installable set of packages.

       A more precise explanation can be found in the original research article underlying this tool.

       The interest of computing the kernel is that it  is  typically  orders  of  magnitude  smaller  than  the
       original repository.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Options</b> <b>controlling</b> <b>the</b> <b>input</b>
       <b>-deb</b>   expect input in the format of a debian Packages file (default).

       <b>-rpm</b>   expect input in the format of an RPM hdlist.cz file.

       <b>-ignore</b> <u>package</u>
              ignore the package named <u>package</u>.

   <b>Options</b> <b>controlling</b> <b>the</b> <b>graph</b> <b>output</b>
       <b>-o</b> <u>file</u>
              write the graph to <u>file</u> instead of graph.dot

       <b>-all</b>   include all packages in the coinstallability graph

       <b>-root</b> <u>p</u>
              draw only the relevant portion of the graph around package <u>p</u>.

   <b>Options</b> <b>controlling</b> <b>the</b> <b>diagnostic</b> <b>output</b>
       <b>-explain</b>
              explain the list of non-installable pairs of packages.

       <b>-stats</b> show statistics regarding the input and output repositories

   <b>Miscellaneous</b> <b>options</b>
       <b>-help,</b> <b>--help</b>
              show command synopsis

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLE</b></h4><pre>
       Reduce a current debian Packages file to its kernel:

          coinst -all -o raw.dot &lt; sid_main_binary-amd64_Packages

       Layout the graph:

          dot raw.dot -o layout.dot:

       View the graph with dotty, or the viewer from the coinst_viewer package:

          dotty layout.dot
          coinst_viewer layout.dot
