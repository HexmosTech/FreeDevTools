       cvs-inject - inject a debian source package into a CVS repository

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>cvs-inject</b> <u>[options]</u> <b>&lt;package&gt;.dsc</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual page explains the Debian <b>cvs-inject</b> utility, which is used to inject or import Debian source
       packages into a <u>CVS</u> repository. It handles Debian-only packages (which do not have diff files) as well as
       normal packages from <u>upstream</u> sources converted to Debian use.

       The upstream sources are imported to the vendor branch  and  tagged  <u>upstream_version_&lt;upstream</u>  <u>version&gt;</u>
       with  all  dots  translated  to  under  scores. The debianized sources, if different, are put on the main
       branch, and tagged <u>debian_version_&lt;upstream</u> <u>version&gt;-&lt;debian</u> <u>revision&gt;</u> with all dots translated to  under
       scores.

       The  sole  argument  is  a  debian source .dsc file, which is parsed to get the package name and version.
       <b>cvs-inject</b> reads the same config file <u>/etc/cvsdeb.conf</u> as the the other cvs-* utilities do.   People  may
       use of the dry-run option to inspect the steps this utility takes.

       Combined  with  the companion utilities <b>cvs-buildpackage</b> and <b>cvs-upgrade,</b> this provides an infrastructure
       to facilitate the use of <b>CVS</b> by Debian maintainers. This allows one to keep separate CVS  branches  of  a
       package for <u>stable,</u> <u>unstable,</u> and possibly <u>experimental</u> distributions, along with the other benefits of a
       version control system.

       This utility can be used to generate a unified CVS source tree, for example, with

        find /var/spool/mirror/debian/hamm/hamm/source \
                      -type f -name \*.dsc | while read i;
            do
               j=$(dirname $i | sed -e s:source/::           \
                      -e s:/var/spool/mirror/debian/:: )
               cvs-inject -x$j $i
            done

       Which  happily  gobbled  up  the  sources  and created a CVS repository on my machine until the partition
       filled up.

</pre><h4><b>CAVEATS</b></h4><pre>
       Please note that the current behaviour of <b>cvs-inject</b> is to ignore files that match the  default  list  of
       file  name patterns to be ignored (this is built into cvs); and that any <b>.cvsignore</b> files in the upstream
       sources shall be honoured. This should be fine as long as upstream sources  do  not  include  files  that
       match  cvs  ignore  patterns  and  yet  should  be  in the sources. The current list of ignored file name
       patterns is:
              <b>RCS</b> <b>SCCS</b> <b>CVS</b> <b>CVS.adm</b> <b>RCSLOG</b> <b>cvslog.*</b> <b>tags</b> <b>TAGS</b> <b>.make.state</b> <b>.nse_depinfo</b> <b>*~</b> <b>#*</b> <b>.#*</b> <b>,*</b> <b>_$*</b> <b>*$</b>  <b>*.old</b>
              <b>*.bak</b> <b>*.BAK</b> <b>*.orig</b> <b>*.rej</b> <b>.del-*</b> <b>*.a</b> <b>*.olb</b> <b>*.o</b> <b>*.obj</b> <b>*.so</b> <b>*.exe</b> <b>*.Z</b> <b>*.elc</b> <b>*.ln</b> <b>core</b>

       If you wish to modify this behaviour, there are ways to do this (you should see <b>CVS</b> documentation).

       <b>o)</b>     The  per-repository  list  in  <u>`$CVSROOT/CVSROOT/cvsignore'</u>  is appended to the list, if that file
              exists.

       <b>o)</b>     The per-user list in <u>`.cvsignore'</u> in your home directory is appended to the list, if it exists.

       <b>o)</b>     Any entries in the environment variable <u>$CVSIGNORE</u> is appended to the list.

       In any of the places listed above, a single exclamation mark <b>(`!')</b>  clears the ignore list.  This can  be
       used  if  you want to store any file which normally is ignored by CVS. Also, any <u>.cvsignore</u> file found in
       the source directory is also honoured. If you wish to specify your own list on the command line, you  may
       use  the  environment variable <b>CVSDEB_IMPORTSUBSTMODE</b> (for example, <u>CVSDEB_IMPORTSUBSTMODE="!</u> <u>-I</u> <u>blah</u> <u>-ko</u>
       <u>-d</u> ).

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-h</b>                  Print out a usage message.

       <b>-m</b>                  If present, this option directs this program to include the latest debian  changelog,
                           if   any,   into   the  commit  message.  This  overrides  the  environment  variable
                           <b>CVSDEB_USE_CHANGELOG</b>

       <b>-M&lt;module&gt;</b>          The name of the CVS module. This argument overrides the settings in  the  environment
                           variable <b>CVSDEB_MODULE.</b>  There is no corresponding config file variable.

       <b>-F</b>                  There  are  two  things  <b>CVS</b>  may  choke on <u>symbolic</u> <u>links</u> and <u>CVS</u> directories in the
                           source tree. Also, there are times when one may  not  want  to  honour  the  upstream
                           <u>.cvsignore</u>  files.  Without  this  option,  the <b>cvs-inject</b> program shall exit with an
                           error message. This option causes <b>cvs-inject</b> to ask whether you want  to  delete  the
                           offending  files.  If you answer y, it removes them and continues; else it shall exit
                           with an error message.  This argument  overrides  the  settings  in  the  environment
                           variable  <b>CVSDEB_FORCECLEAN,</b> which in turn overrides the setting in the configuration
                           file, <b>conf_forceclean.</b>

       <b>-T&lt;tag&gt;</b>             The CVS tag to use for exporting sources,  rather  than  constructing  one  from  the
                           version. This assumes you know what you are doing.

       <b>-U&lt;tag&gt;</b>             The  CVS  tag  to  use  for  the  upstream tag, rather than constructing one from the
                           upstream version. This assumes you know what you are doing.

       <b>-x&lt;prefix&gt;</b>          The name of the default CVS prefix (that is, this is appended to <b>CVSROOT</b> when looking
                           for the repository).   This  argument  overrides  the  settings  in  the  environment
                           variable  <b>CVSDEB_PREFIX,</b>  which  in  turn  overrides the setting in the configuration
                           file, <b>conf_prefix.</b>

       <b>-R&lt;root</b> <b>directory&gt;</b>  Root of the original sources archive. If the cvs-buildpackage work directory  is  set
                           anywhere,   (command  line,  configuration  file,  environment  variable),  the  root
                           directory value is ignored, since we only need the root directory to set defaults for
                           the work directory. This argument overrides the settings in the environment  variable
                           <b>CVSDEB_ROOTDIR,</b>  and  the configuration file variable <b>conf_rootdir.</b>  Please note that
                           the cvs-buildpackage work directory referred to here is the scratch  directory  where
                           this  program  works,  not the directory that the human uses to work in.  This should
                           probably not be a sub dir of <b>CVSROOT,</b> since  cvs  shall  refuse  to  export  packages
                           there, and the script shall fail.

       <b>-W&lt;work</b> <b>directory&gt;</b>  The full path name for the cvs-buildpackage working directory.  Setting this variable
                           overrides  the  settings  for  the  root directory.  This argument also overrides the
                           settings in the environment variable <b>CVSDEB_WORKDIR,</b> and in  the  configuration  file
                           variable  <b>conf_workdir..</b>   Please  note  that  the  cvs-buildpackage  work  directory
                           referred to here is the scratch directory where this program works, not the directory
                           that the human uses to work in, and needs to be the full (absolute) path name.   This
                           should  probably  not  be  a  sub  dir  of  <b>CVSROOT,</b> since cvs shall refuse to export
                           packages there, and the script shall fail. The default is <u>/usr/local/src/Packages/</u>

       <b>-d&lt;number&gt;</b>          Turn on debugging output. This lists the version numbers, the  cvs-buildpackage  work
                           and  root  directories,  as  well  as  the  CVS  tag used to export the sources. This
                           over-rides the <u>DEBUG</u> variable in the configuration file.

       <b>-ctp</b>                Include <u>package</u><b>_</b> at the start of the CVS tag.  This overrides the <b>CVSDEB_PACKAGEINTAG</b>
                           environment variable and the <b>conf_forcetag</b> configuration file option.  The default is
                           not to include the prefix.

       <b>-n</b>                  The no exec (or dry-run) option, causing <b>cvs-inject</b> to print  out  all  actions  that
                           would be taken without actually executing them..

       <b>-v</b>                  Make the utility more verbose.

       <b>CVSDEB_IMPORTSUBSTMODE</b>
                           You are also allowed to specify an environment variable, <b>CVSDEB_IMPORTSUBSTMODE,</b> that
                           overrides  the  default  substitution option of -ko.  This is useful when you want to
                           import a package that has a bunch of binary files in the source tree (like  emacs  or
                           rscheme).

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       Apart   from   the   runtime   options,  <b>cvs-inject</b>  also  looks  for  site-wide  defaults  in  the  file
       <u>/etc/cvsdeb.conf.</u>  After that, it looks for and reads <u><a href="file:~/.cvsdeb.conf">~/.cvsdeb.conf</a></u>  The  default  configuration  allows
       there  to  be  a site wide override for the root or the cvs-buildpackage working directories on the site,
       but the <u>cvsdeb.conf</u> files are actually Bourne shell snippets, and  any  legal  shell  directives  may  be
       included  in there.  <b>Note:</b> Caution is urged with this file, since you can totally change the way that the
       script behaves by suitable editing this file.
