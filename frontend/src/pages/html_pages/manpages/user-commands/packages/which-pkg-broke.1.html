</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       which-pkg-broke - find which package might have broken another

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>which-pkg-broke</b> package

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>which-pkg-broke</b> program will retrieve a list of the named package and all its dependencies sorted by
       the  time  they  were  installed  on  the  system  (as  determined  from   the   mtime   information   of
       <b><a href="file:/var/lib/dpkg/info/">/var/lib/dpkg/info/</a>*.list</b> .

       This tool makes it possible for a system admin to obtain information that might correlate installation of
       package  dependencies  with a package breakage in order to find which package update might be responsible
       for the breakage.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       This tool can be useful determine which package dependencies were upgraded more  recently  and  might  be
       associated  with  the  bug  that  is being observed.  For example, if aptitude stops working properly, an
       administrator can run:

       <b>$</b> <b>which-pkg-broke</b> <b>aptitude</b>
       Package &lt;libapt-pkg-libc6.3-5-3.3&gt; has no install time info
       libdb1-compat                    Fri Aug  8 03:02:11 2003
       libsigc++-1.2-5c102              Fri Aug  8 05:15:58 2003
       aptitude                         Sun Jan 11 17:38:06 2004
       libncurses5                      Sun Jan 18 08:11:05 2004
       libc6                            Thu Jan 22 07:55:10 2004
       libgcc1                          Tue Jan 27 07:37:22 2004
       gcc-3.3-base                     Tue Jan 27 07:37:31 2004
       libstdc++5                       Tue Jan 27 07:37:32 2004

       So depending on exactly when the misbehaviour started, there may be a reason to point  the  finger  at  a
       more-recently  updated  library  like  <b>libstdc++</b>  or  <b>libncurses</b>,  which are more-recently installed than
       aptitude itself.
