       zkg - Zeek Package Manager

       A command-line package manager for Zeek.

          usage: zkg [-h] [--version] [--configfile FILE | --user] [--verbose] [--extra-source NAME=URL]
                     {test,install,bundle,unbundle,remove,uninstall,purge,refresh,upgrade,load,unload,pin,unpin,list,search,info,config,autoconfig,env,create,template}
                     ...

       <b>Options:</b>

              <b>--version</b>
                     show program's version number and exit

              <b>--configfile</b>
                     Path to Zeek Package Manager config file. Precludes --user.

                     See <u>Config</u> <u>File</u>.

              <b>--user=False</b>
                     Store all state in user's home directory. Precludes --configfile.

              <b>--verbose=0</b>, <b>-v=0</b>
                     Increase program output for debugging. Use multiple times for more output (e.g. -vv).

              <b>--extra-source</b>
                     Add an extra source.

       Environment Variables:
          <b>ZKG_CONFIG_FILE</b>:    Same  as  <b>--configfile</b>  option,  but has less precedence.  <b>ZKG_DEFAULT_SOURCE</b>: The
          default     package     source      to      use      (normally      <u>https://github.com/zeek/packages</u>).
          <b>ZKG_DEFAULT_TEMPLATE</b>:    The       default       package      template      to      use      (normally
          <u>https://github.com/zeek/package-template</u>).

</pre><h4><b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>test</b>
       Runs the unit tests for the specified Zeek packages. In most cases, the "zeek" and "zeek-config" programs
       will need to be in PATH before running this command.

          usage: zkg test [-h] [--version VERSION] package [package ...]

       <b>Positional</b> <b>arguments:</b>

              <b>package</b>
                     The name(s) of package(s) to operate on.  The package may be named in several ways.  If the
                     package is part of a package source, it may be referred to by the base name of the  package
                     (last  component  of  git  URL)  or  its path within the package source. If two packages in
                     different package sources have conflicting paths, then  the  package  source  name  may  be
                     prepended  to the package path to resolve the ambiguity. A full git URL may also be used to
                     refer to a package that does not belong to a source.  E.g.  for  a  package  source  called
                     "zeek"  that  has  a  package named "foo" located in "alice/zkg.index", the following names
                     work: "foo", "alice/foo", "zeek/alice/foo".

       <b>Options:</b>

              <b>--version</b>
                     The version of the package to test.  Only one package may be specified at a time when using
                     this flag.  A version tag, branch name, or commit  hash  may  be  specified  here.  If  the
                     package  name  refers  to  a  local git repo with a working tree, then its currently active
                     branch is used. The default for other cases is to use the  latest  version  tag,  or  if  a
                     package has none, the default branch, like "main" or "master".

   <b>install</b>
       Installs  packages  from  a  configured package source or directly from a git URL.  After installing, the
       package is marked as being "loaded" (see the <b>load</b> command).

          usage: zkg install [-h] [--skiptests] [--nodeps] [--nosuggestions] [--version VERSION] [--force]
                             [--user-var NAME=VAL]
                             package [package ...]

       <b>Positional</b> <b>arguments:</b>

              <b>package</b>
                     The name(s) of package(s) to operate on.  The package may be named in several ways.  If the
                     package is part of a package source, it may be referred to by the base name of the  package
                     (last  component  of  git  URL)  or  its path within the package source. If two packages in
                     different package sources have conflicting paths, then  the  package  source  name  may  be
                     prepended  to the package path to resolve the ambiguity. A full git URL may also be used to
                     refer to a package that does not belong to a source.  E.g.  for  a  package  source  called
                     "zeek"  that  has  a  package named "foo" located in "alice/zkg.index", the following names
                     work: "foo", "alice/foo", "zeek/alice/foo".

       <b>Options:</b>

              <b>--skiptests=False</b>
                     Skip running unit tests for packages before installation.

              <b>--nodeps=False</b>
                     Skip all dependency resolution/checks.  Note that using  this  option  risks  putting  your
                     installed package collection into a broken or unusable state.

              <b>--nosuggestions=False</b>
                     Skip automatically installing suggested packages.

              <b>--version</b>
                     The  version  of  the package to install.  Only one package may be specified at a time when
                     using this flag.  A version tag, branch name, or commit hash may be specified here. If  the
                     package  name  refers  to  a  local git repo with a working tree, then its currently active
                     branch is used. The default for other cases is to use the  latest  version  tag,  or  if  a
                     package has none, the default branch, like "main" or "master".

              <b>--force=False</b>
                     Don't prompt for confirmation or user variables.

              <b>--user-var</b>
                     A  user  variable  assignment. This avoids prompting for input and lets you provide a value
                     when using --force. Use repeatedly as needed for multiple values.

   <b>remove</b>
       Unloads (see the <b>unload</b> command) and uninstalls a previously installed package.

          usage: zkg remove [-h] [--force] [--nodeps] package [package ...]

       <b>Positional</b> <b>arguments:</b>

              <b>package</b>
                     The name(s) of package(s) to operate on.  The package may be named in several ways.  If the
                     package is part of a package source, it may be referred to by the base name of the  package
                     (last  component  of  git  URL)  or  its path within the package source. If two packages in
                     different package sources have conflicting paths, then  the  package  source  name  may  be
                     prepended  to the package path to resolve the ambiguity. A full git URL may also be used to
                     refer to a package that does not belong to a source.  E.g.  for  a  package  source  called
                     "zeek"  that  has  a  package named "foo" located in "alice/zkg.index", the following names
                     work: "foo", "alice/foo", "zeek/alice/foo".

       <b>Options:</b>

              <b>--force=False</b>
                     Skip the confirmation prompt.

              <b>--nodeps=False</b>
                     Skip all dependency resolution/checks.  Note that using  this  option  risks  putting  your
                     installed package collection into a broken or unusable state.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          You may also say <b>uninstall</b>.

   <b>purge</b>
       Unloads (see the <b>unload</b> command) and uninstalls all previously installed packages.

          usage: zkg purge [-h] [--force]

       <b>Options:</b>

              <b>--force=False</b>
                     Skip the confirmation prompt.

   <b>bundle</b>
       This  command creates a bundle file containing a collection of Zeek packages.  If <b>--manifest</b> is used, the
       user supplies the list of packages to put in the bundle, else all currently installed packages are put in
       the bundle. A bundle file can be unpacked on any target system, resulting in a repeatable/specific set of
       packages being installed on that target system (see the <b>unbundle</b> command).  This command  may  be  useful
       for those that want to manage packages on a system that otherwise has limited network connectivity.  E.g.
       one  can use a system with an internet connection to create a bundle, transport that bundle to the target
       machine using whatever means are appropriate, and finally unbundle/install it on the target machine.

          usage: zkg bundle [-h] [--force] [--nodeps] [--nosuggestions] [--manifest MANIFEST [MANIFEST ...] --]
                            filename.bundle

       <b>Positional</b> <b>arguments:</b>

              <b>filename.bundle</b>
                     The path of the bundle file to create.  It will be overwritten if it already exists.   Note
                     that if --manifest is used before this filename is specified, you should use a double-dash,
                     --, to first terminate that argument list.

       <b>Options:</b>

              <b>--force=False</b>
                     Skip the confirmation prompt.

              <b>--nodeps=False</b>
                     Skip all dependency resolution/checks.  Note that using this option risks creating a bundle
                     of packages that is in a broken or unusable state.

              <b>--nosuggestions=False</b>
                     Skip automatically bundling suggested packages.

              <b>--manifest</b>
                     This  may  either be a file name or a list of packages to include in the bundle.  If a file
                     name is supplied, it should be in INI format with a single ``[bundle]`` section.  The  keys
                     in  that  section  correspond  to  package names and their values correspond to git version
                     tags, branch names, or commit hashes.  The values may be left blank to  indicate  that  the
                     latest available version should be used.

   <b>unbundle</b>
       This  command  unpacks a bundle file formerly created by the <b>bundle</b> command and installs all the packages
       contained within.

          usage: zkg unbundle [-h] [--replace] [--force] [--user-var NAME=VAL] filename.bundle

       <b>Positional</b> <b>arguments:</b>

              <b>filename.bundle</b>
                     The path of the bundle file to install.

       <b>Options:</b>

              <b>--replace=False</b>
                     Using this flag first removes all installed packages before then  installing  the  packages
                     from the bundle.

              <b>--force=False</b>
                     Don't prompt for confirmation or user variables.

              <b>--user-var</b>
                     A  user  variable  assignment. This avoids prompting for input and lets you provide a value
                     when using --force. Use repeatedly as needed for multiple values.

   <b>refresh</b>
       Retrieve latest package metadata from sources and checks whether any installed  packages  have  available
       upgrades. Note that this does not actually upgrade any packages (see the <b>upgrade</b> command for that).

          usage: zkg refresh [-h] [--aggregate] [--fail-on-aggregate-problems] [--push]
                             [--sources SOURCES [SOURCES ...]]

       <b>Options:</b>

              <b>--aggregate=False</b>
                     Crawls  the urls listed in package source zkg.index files and aggregates the metadata found
                     in their zkg.meta (or legacy bro-pkg.meta) files.  The aggregated metadata is stored in the
                     local clone of the package source that zkg uses internally for locating  package  metadata.
                     For  each  package, the metadata is taken from the highest available git version tag or the
                     default branch, like "main" or "master", if no version tags exist

              <b>--fail-on-aggregate-problems=False</b>
                     When using --aggregate, exit with  error  when  any  packages  trigger  metadata  problems.
                     Normally such problems only cause a warning.

              <b>--push=False</b>
                     Push all local changes to package sources to upstream repos

              <b>--sources</b>
                     A  list  of  package  source  names  to operate on.  If this argument is not used, then the
                     command will operate on all configured sources.

   <b>upgrade</b>
       Uprades the specified package(s) to latest available version.  If no  specific  packages  are  specified,
       then  all  installed  packages  that  are  outdated  and  not pinned are upgraded.  For packages that are
       installed with <b>--version</b> using a git branch name, the package is updated to the  latest  commit  on  that
       branch, else the package is updated to the highest available git version tag.

          usage: zkg upgrade [-h] [--skiptests] [--nodeps] [--nosuggestions] [--force] [--user-var NAME=VAL]
                             [package ...]

       <b>Positional</b> <b>arguments:</b>

              <b>package</b>
                     The name(s) of package(s) to operate on.  The package may be named in several ways.  If the
                     package  is part of a package source, it may be referred to by the base name of the package
                     (last component of git URL) or its path within the  package  source.  If  two  packages  in
                     different  package  sources  have  conflicting  paths,  then the package source name may be
                     prepended to the package path to resolve the ambiguity. A full git URL may also be used  to
                     refer  to  a  package  that  does  not belong to a source. E.g. for a package source called
                     "zeek" that has a package named "foo" located in  "alice/zkg.index",  the  following  names
                     work: "foo", "alice/foo", "zeek/alice/foo".

       <b>Options:</b>

              <b>--skiptests=False</b>
                     Skip running unit tests for packages before installation.

              <b>--nodeps=False</b>
                     Skip  all  dependency  resolution/checks.   Note  that using this option risks putting your
                     installed package collection into a broken or unusable state.

              <b>--nosuggestions=False</b>
                     Skip automatically installing suggested packages.

              <b>--force=False</b>
                     Don't prompt for confirmation or user variables.

              <b>--user-var</b>
                     A user variable assignment. This avoids prompting for input and lets you  provide  a  value
                     when using --force. Use repeatedly as needed for multiple values.

   <b>load</b>
       The  Zeek  Package Manager keeps track of all packages that are marked as "loaded" and maintains a single
       Zeek script that, when loaded by Zeek (e.g. via <b>@load</b> <b>packages</b>), will load the scripts from all  "loaded"
       packages at once. This command adds a set of packages to the "loaded packages" list.

          usage: zkg load [-h] [--nodeps] package [package ...]

       <b>Positional</b> <b>arguments:</b>

              <b>package</b>
                     Name(s) of package(s) to load.

       <b>Options:</b>

              <b>--nodeps=False</b>
                     Skip  all  dependency  resolution/checks.   Note  that using this option risks putting your
                     installed package collection into a broken or unusable state.

   <b>unload</b>
       The Zeek Package Manager keeps track of all packages that are marked as "loaded" and maintains  a  single
       Zeek  script  that,  when loaded by Zeek, will load the scripts from all "loaded" packages at once.  This
       command removes a set of packages from the "loaded packages" list.

          usage: zkg unload [-h] [--force] [--nodeps] package [package ...]

       <b>Positional</b> <b>arguments:</b>

              <b>package</b>
                     The name(s) of package(s) to operate on.  The package may be named in several ways.  If the
                     package is part of a package source, it may be referred to by the base name of the  package
                     (last  component  of  git  URL)  or  its path within the package source. If two packages in
                     different package sources have conflicting paths, then  the  package  source  name  may  be
                     prepended  to the package path to resolve the ambiguity. A full git URL may also be used to

   <b>unpin</b>
       Packages that are not pinned are automatically upgraded by the <b>upgrade</b> command

          usage: zkg unpin [-h] package [package ...]

       <b>Positional</b> <b>arguments:</b>

              <b>package</b>
                     The name(s) of package(s) to operate on.  The package may be named in several ways.  If the
                     package  is part of a package source, it may be referred to by the base name of the package
                     (last component of git URL) or its path within the  package  source.  If  two  packages  in
                     different  package  sources  have  conflicting  paths,  then the package source name may be
                     prepended to the package path to resolve the ambiguity. A full git URL may also be used  to
                     refer  to  a  package  that  does  not belong to a source. E.g. for a package source called
                     "zeek" that has a package named "foo" located in  "alice/zkg.index",  the  following  names
                     work: "foo", "alice/foo", "zeek/alice/foo".

   <b>list</b>
       Outputs a list of packages that match a given category.

          usage: zkg list [-h] [--nodesc] [--include-builtin] [{all,installed,not_installed,loaded,unloaded,outdated}]

       <b>Positional</b> <b>arguments:</b>

              <b>category</b>
                     Package category used to filter listing.

                     Possible choices: all, installed, not_installed, loaded, unloaded, outdated

       <b>Options:</b>

              <b>--nodesc=False</b>
                     Do not display description text, just the package name(s).

              <b>--include-builtin=False</b>
                     Also output packages that Zeek has built-in. By default these are not shown.

   <b>search</b>
       Perform  a  substring  search  on  package names and metadata tags.  Surround search text with slashes to
       indicate it is a regular expression (e.g. <b>/text/</b>).

          usage: zkg search [-h] search_text [search_text ...]

       <b>Positional</b> <b>arguments:</b>

              <b>search_text</b>
                     The text(s) or pattern(s) to look for.

   <b>info</b>
       Shows detailed information/metadata for given packages. If the package is currently installed, additional
       information about the status of it is displayed.  E.g. the installed version or whether it  is  currently
       marked as "pinned" or "loaded."

          usage: zkg info [-h] [--version VERSION] [--nolocal] [--include-builtin] [--json] [--jsonpretty SPACES]
                          [--allvers]
                          package [package ...]

       <b>Positional</b> <b>arguments:</b>

              <b>package</b>
                     The name(s) of package(s) to operate on.  The package may be named in several ways.  If the
                     package  is part of a package source, it may be referred to by the base name of the package
                     (last component of git URL) or its path within the  package  source.  If  two  packages  in
                     different  package  sources  have  conflicting  paths,  then the package source name may be
                     prepended to the package path to resolve the ambiguity. A full git URL may also be used  to
                     refer  to  a  package  that  does  not belong to a source. E.g. for a package source called
                     "zeek" that has a package named "foo" located in  "alice/zkg.index",  the  following  names
                     work:  "foo",  "alice/foo",  "zeek/alice/foo". If a single name is given and matches one of
                     the same categories as the "list" command, then it is  automatically  expanded  to  be  the
                     names of all packages which match the given category.

       <b>Options:</b>

              <b>--version</b>
                     The version of the package metadata to inspect.  A version tag, branch name, or commit hash
                     and  only  one  package  at  a time may be given when using this flag.  If unspecified, the
                     behavior depends on whether the package is currently installed.  If installed, the metadata
                     will be pulled from the installed version.  If not installed, the  latest  version  tag  is
                     used,  or if a package has no version tags, the default branch, like "main" or "master", is
                     used.

              <b>--nolocal=False</b>
                     Do not read information from locally installed packages.  Instead  read  info  from  remote
                     GitHub.

              <b>--include-builtin=False</b>
                     Also output packages that Zeek has built-in. By default these are not shown.

              <b>--json=False</b>
                     Output package information as JSON.

              <b>--jsonpretty</b>
                     Optional number of spaces to indent for pretty-printed JSON output.

              <b>--allvers=False</b>
                     When  outputting  package  information as JSON, show metadata for all versions. This option
                     can be slow since remote  repositories  may  be  cloned  multiple  times.  Also,  installed
                     packages  will show metadata only for the installed version unless the --nolocal  option is
                     given.

   <b>config</b>
       The default output of this command is a valid package manager config file that  corresponds  to  the  one
       currently  being  used, but also with any defaulted field values filled in.  This command also allows for
       only the value of a specific field to be output if the name of that field is given as an argument to  the
       command.

          usage: zkg config [-h] [{all,sources,user_vars,state_dir,script_dir,plugin_dir,bin_dir,zeek_dist}]

       <b>Positional</b> <b>arguments:</b>

              <b>config_param</b>
                     Name of a specific config file field to output.

                     Possible  choices:  all,  sources,  user_vars,  state_dir, script_dir, plugin_dir, bin_dir,
                     zeek_dist

   <b>autoconfig</b>
       The output of this command is a valid package  manager  config  file  that  is  generated  by  using  the
       <b>zeek-config</b>  script that is installed along with Zeek.  It is the suggested configuration to use for most
       Zeek installations.  For this command to work, the <b>zeek-config</b> script must be in <b>PATH</b>, unless the  --user
       option is given, in which case this creates a config that does not touch the Zeek installation.

          usage: zkg autoconfig [-h] [--force]

       <b>Options:</b>

              <b>--force=False</b>
                     Skip any confirmation prompt.

   <b>env</b>
       This command returns shell commands that, when executed, will correctly set <b>ZEEKPATH</b> and <b>ZEEK_PLUGIN_PATH</b>
       to  use  scripts and plugins from packages installed by the package manager. For this command to function
       properly, either have the <b>zeek-config</b> script (installed by zeek)  in  <b>PATH</b>,  or  have  the  <b>ZEEKPATH</b>  and
       <b>ZEEK_PLUGIN_PATH</b>  environment  variables already set so this command can append package-specific paths to
       them.

          usage: zkg env [-h]

   <b>create</b>
       This command creates a new Zeek package in the directory provided via  --packagedir.  If  this  directory
       exists, zkg will not modify it unless you provide --force.

          usage: zkg create [-h] --packagedir DIR [--version VERSION] [--features FEATURE [FEATURE ...]]
                            [--template URL] [--force] [--user-var NAME=VAL]

       <b>Options:</b>

              <b>--packagedir</b>
                     Output directory into which to produce the new package. Required.

              <b>--version</b>
                     The  template  version to use.  A version tag, branch name, or commit hash may be specified
                     here.  If --template refers to a local git repo with a working tree, then zkg uses it as-is
                     and the version is ignored.  The default for other cases is to use the latest version  tag,
                     or if a template has none, the default branch, like "main" or "master".

              <b>--features</b>
                     Additional  features  to  include  in  your  package. Use the ``template info`` command for
                     information about available features.

              <b>--template</b>
                     By default, zkg uses its own package template. This makes it select an alternative.

              <b>--force=False</b>
                     Don't prompt for confirmation or user variables.

              <b>--user-var</b>
                     A user variable assignment. This avoids prompting for input and lets you  provide  a  value
                     when using --force. Use repeatedly as needed for multiple values.

   <b>template</b> <b>info</b>
       This command shows versions and supported features for a given package.

          usage: zkg template info [-h] [--json] [--jsonpretty SPACES] [--version VERSION] [URL]

       <b>Positional</b> <b>arguments:</b>

              <b>URL</b>    URL  of  a  package  template  repository,  or  local  path  to one. When not provided, the
                     configured default template is used.

       <b>Options:</b>

              <b>--json=False</b>
                     Output template information as JSON.

              <b>--jsonpretty</b>
                     Optional number of spaces to indent for pretty-printed JSON output.

              <b>--version</b>
                     The template version to report on.  A version tag, branch  name,  or  commit  hash  may  be
                     specified  here.   If  the  selected  template  refers  to a local git repo, the version is
                     ignored.  The default for other cases is to use the latest version tag, or  if  a  template
                     has none, the default branch, like "main" or "master".

</pre><h4><b>CONFIG</b> <b>FILE</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>zkg</b>  command-line  tool  uses  an  INI-format  config file to allow users to customize their <u>Package</u>
       <u>Sources</u>, <u>Package</u> installation paths, Zeek executable/source paths, and other <b>zkg</b> options.

       See the default/example config file below for explanations of the available options and how to  customize
       them:

          # This is an example config file for zkg to explain what
          # settings are possible as well as their default values.
          # The order of precedence for how zkg finds/reads config files:
          #
          # (1) zkg --configfile=/path/to/custom/config
          # (2) the ZKG_CONFIG_FILE environment variable
          # (3) a config file located at $HOME/.zkg/config
          # (4) if none of the above exist, then zkg uses builtin/default
          #     values for all settings shown below

          [sources]

          # The default package source repository from which zkg fetches
          # packages.  The default source may be removed, changed, or

          # and a value that is a valid git URL.  The git URL may also use a
          # suffix like "@branch-name" where "branch-name" is the name of a real
          # branch to checkout (as opposed to the default branch, which is typically
          # "main" or "master"). You can override the package source zkg puts
          # in new config files (e.g. "zkg autoconfig")  by setting the
