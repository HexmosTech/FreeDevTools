       dh_installyorick - install Yorick add-on packages

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>dh_installyorick</b> [<u>debhelper</u> <u>options</u>] [<b>-m</b>] [<b>--no-make-install</b>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       dh_installyorick  is a debhelper program that installs the files of your Yorick add-on at the right place
       when building a Debian package. For a simple plug-in package,  this  is  mostly  done  by  calling  "make
       DESTDIR=debian/&lt;package&gt; install" and then moving arch-independent files to usr/share. Note that there is
       no Y_SITE/contrib directory in the Debian packages, its content is merged into YSITE/i.

       Calling  "make  ...  install"  can  be  disabled by using the "--no-make-install" flag. This is useful in
       particular for interpreted add-on packages, which do not ship with a standard Yorick Makefile.

       If the "-m" flag is used (but not the "-n" one), dh_installyorick will also add lines to  your  package's
       postinst  and postrm scripts to call "update-yorickdoc --auto" if the yorick-doc package is installed. It
       is necessary to call dh_installdeb after dh_installyorick for this to work. It is usually  not  necessary
       with  a  recent  dpkg  supporting  triggers,  so this possibility is kept mostly for easing backports and
       should be deprecated soon.

       dh_installyorick will look for a file named debian/&lt;package&gt;.ynstall for additional files to install (see
       <b>YNSTALL</b> <b>FILE</b> below). The prefix "&lt;package&gt;." can be omitted for  the  main  binary  package  being  built
       (usually the first one listed in debian/control).

       For the time being, Y_SITE=Y_HOME=/usr/lib/yorick. Requests to install a file under Y_SITE results in its
       installation  under  /usr/share/yorick.  dh_installyorick  handles the creation of the necessary symbolic
       links from Y_HOME to /usr/share/yorick.

       Files that are installed in a directory ending in "<a href="file:/bin">/bin</a>" or "<a href="file:/sbin">/sbin</a>", as well as files that are pointed at
       by symbolic link in such a directory, are installed with execution permission for everyone.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-m</b>  Modify postinst/postrm scripts to add a call to update-yorickdoc. This is needed only if  the  target
           dpkg does not support triggers. If both "-m" and "-n" are specified, the scripts are not modified.

       <b>--no-make-install</b>
           Do not call "make DESTDIR=debian/&lt;package&gt; install".

       <b>--infofile=</b>
           An additional pkg_mngr .info file to install.

       Additionally, dh_installyorick abides by the following standard debhelper options: -a/--arch, -i/--indep,
       --mainpackage,   -n,   --no-act,   -N/--no-package,   -p/--package,   -P/--tmpdir,   -s/--same-arch,  and
       -v/--verbose.

</pre><h4><b>YNSTALL</b> <b>FILE</b></h4><pre>
       Blank lines are ignored, several blank character are counted as one, and line starting with "#" (possibly
       following one or more blanks) are ignored. Each non-comment, non-blank line should be of the form:

       <u>file</u> [<u>directory</u> [<u>link</u>]]

       Where <u>file</u> is the file to install, <u>directory</u> the directory  it  should  be  installed  in,  and  <u>link</u>  an
       optional symbolic link pointing on the installed file.

       <u>file</u>
           the relative path from the top directory of the package source to the file. If <u>link</u> is not specified,
           <u>file</u>  can  contain shell globs and actually denote sevral files. If <u>directory</u> is not specified, it is
           guessed from the extension of <u>file</u>: .i files are installed in Y_SITE/i,  .gs  and  .gp  in  Y_SITE/g,
           .info  in  Y_SITE/packages/installed, .packinfo, .aliases and .keywords in /usr/share/yorick-doc, and
           .so in Y_HOME/lib.

       <u>directory</u>
           the full path (without leading "/") into which the file should be installed. If the  file  is  to  be
           installed  inside  Yorick's  Y_SITE  or Y_HOME directory (which will almost alway be the case), it is
           possible (and advisable) to not specify the full path, but to write "Y_SITE/" or "Y_HOME" followed by
           the relative path from there. It is also possible to omit  this  "Y_SITE/"  or  "Y_HOME/"  prefix  if
           <u>directory</u>  starts  whith  one  of:  Y_SITE/i,  Y_SITE/i0,  Y_SITE/i-start, Y_SITE/g, Y_SITE/packages,
           Y_HOME/bin or Y_HOME/lib.

       <u>link</u>
           the full path to a symbolic link that should point to the installed file. The same shortcuts apply as
           for <u>directory</u>.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       The four following lines in debian/ynstall would be equivalent:
       somefile.i /usr/share/yorick/i
       somefile.i Y_SITE/i
       somefile.i i
       somefile.i

       Likewise, the following are equivalent:
       somefile.i /usr/share/yorick/i0
       somefile.i Y_SITE/i0
       somefile.i i0

       Example with a symlink. Here, somefile.i is a script that is both useful #included from within Yorick  or
       from the command line. Its first line reads "#!/usr/bin/yorick -batch".
       somefile.i i usr/bin/command_name

       This  program  is  a  part of yorick-dev but is made to work with debhelper. Note that only compatibility
       level 5 has been implemented and tested. This script is not idempotent, dh_clean -k  should  be  executed
       between any two runs.
