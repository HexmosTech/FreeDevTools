</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       debarchiver - Tool to sort debian packages into a package archive.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       debarchiver [options]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The debian archiver is a tool that installs debian packages into a file structure suitable for apt-get,
       aptitude, dselect and similar tools. This can be used for updating the Debian system. It is meant to be
       used by local administrators that need special packages, or tweaked versions to ease administration.

       The file structure is based on the potato file structure and does not support package pools.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>

       <b>--ignoredestcheck</b>
           Force install of .changes file even if some files specified in the .changes file already exists  with
           wrong size or md5 hash.

           The lockfile to use. The default is $lockfile.

       <b>--mailcmd</b>
           The command to use to send emails. The default behavior is to use  the  sendmail  command.   You  can
           disable email sending by specifying the <a href="file:/bin/true">/bin/true</a> command.

       <b>--mailformat</b>
           Defines  the  format  to  be  used  to send emails with, by the command specified by --mailfrom. Only
           'sendmail' and 'mail' formats are supported. By default debarchiver assumes  'sendmail'  format.  The
           argument can be one of the following:
             sendmail = use of the sendmail format
             mail     = use of the mail format

       <b>--mailfrom</b>
           Specify mail sender.

       <b>--scandetect</b> <b>|</b> <b>-s</b>
           Scan using 'apt-ftparchive' or 'dpkg-scan*' (dpkg-scanpackages  and  dpkg-scansources)  depending  on
           what  is  installed on the system. This is the recommended way. Only use --index or --autoscan if you
           know what you are doing.

       <b>--scanonly</b>
           Same as --nosort --nostructurefix.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       You  can  also  place  configuration  files  with  the  following  names   (in   the   following   order)
       /etc/debarchiver.conf, <a href="file:~/.debarchiver.conf">~/.debarchiver.conf</a> and input.conf (relative to input directory) that will be read
       before  the  arguments  to  this  program will be parsed. In the above files you can change the following
       variables:

       The configuration files are read as perl modules they should end with a true value. Therefore they should
       always end with a line that states '1;'.

       <b>$bzip</b>
           If set to 0 no bzip2 files will be generated. If set to 1 bzip2 files will be generated.

       <b>$cachedir</b>
           The cache directory for apt-ftparchive used if --index is used.

       <b>$cinstall</b>
           Where the .changes files are installed (see --cinstall above).

       <b>$copycmd</b>
           The install command (see --copycmd).

       <b>$destdir</b>
           The destination directory (see --destdir above).

       <b>$distinputcriteria</b>
           The criteria for which packages that should be installed even if it does not have  a  .changes  file.
           The default is $distinputcriteria.

       <b>%distinputdirs</b>
           Directories  (distribution  =&gt;  dir)  to  be  searched for extra binary packages that does not need a
           .changes file to be installed but match $distinputcriteria.  The default is to accept kernel packages
           generated by make-kpkg (which does not generate a .changes file). Additionally binary packages with a
           valid .changes file will have the default distribution overridden to be the current queue  directory.
           This cause uploads to a specific queue to place the package into that distribution directly.

       <b>$gpgkey</b>
           The  GnuPG key to use to sign the archive. If this variable is set, the Release file for each changed
           section of the archive will be signed with GnuPG using $gpgkey as the key ID.  Unless you use  a  key
           that has no passphrase or use $gpgpassfile, you will need to run <b>debarchiver</b> interactively when using
           this option so that you can supply the passphrase.

       <b>$gpgpassfile</b>
           The file that contains the passphrase for the GnuPG key. See $gpgkey for more information.

       <b>$ignoredestcheck</b>
           Force  install  of .changes file even if some files specified in the .changes file already exist with
           wrong size or md5 hash. Default to 0 (do not ignore).

       <b>$incompletetime</b>
           Time to allow .changes files to be incomplete in seconds. Useful for slow uploads.  The default is 24
           hours.

       <b>$inputdir</b>
           The input directory (no effect in $inputconfigfile).

       <b>$lockfile</b>
           The lockfile to use. The default is $lockfile.

       <b>@mailtos</b>
           An array of strings that will receive emails. If the string contains an email  address  that  one  is
           used.  If  it  contains  an incomplete email address, i.e. @hostname, the username owning the file is
           used @ the hostname specified. If no '@' character is found in the string,  it  is  considered  as  a
           field in the .changes file. Such a field can for example be Maintainer or Uploaders.

       <b>$mailformat</b>
           The format to use to send emails (see --mailformat above).

       <b>$mailfrom</b>
           Specifies the sender of emails. The default is none ("")

       <b>$majordefault</b>
           Default major section (see --majordefault above).

       <b>$movecmd</b>
           The move command (see --movecmd).

       <b>%release</b>
           Additional  information  to add to generated Release files. Supported keys are 'origin', 'label', and
           'description'.

       <b>$rmcmd</b>
           The remove command (see --rmcmd above).

       <b>$vrfycmd</b>
           The verify command. Deprecated. Still functional but you are adviced to set @vrfycmd instead  as  the
           $vrfycmd may be removed in future releases.

       <b>@vrfycmd</b>
           The  verify  command.  If  the  @vrfycmd  list is empty is set to the list ($vrfycmd) just before the
           verify command is executed. It was made like this for backwards compatibility reasons.

       <b>$verifysignatures</b>
           Choose to enable (1) or disable (0) signature verification for packages uploaded into $inputdir  (not
           %distinputdirs).

       <b>$verifysignaturesdistinput</b>
           Choose to enable (1) or disable (2) signature verification for packages uploaded into %distinputdirs.
           This works independently from $verifysignatures.

       <b>$usermailcmd</b>
           It  allows  the user to tell debarchiver to use a specific command to send emails.  You may also want
           to specify the mailformat your mail command handles by setting the value of the $mailformat variable.
           Using the --mailcmd option on the command line will superseed this variable.  You can  disable  email
           sending by specifying the <a href="file:/bin/true">/bin/true</a> command.

</pre><h4><b>PACKAGE</b> <b>INDEXING</b></h4><pre>
       There are two ways to generate the indexes that <b>apt-get</b> relies on.

       Using   <b>--autoscanpackages</b>,  <b>--autoscansources</b>,  or  <b>--autoscan</b>  will  use  <b>dpkg-scanpackages</b>  and  <b>dpkg-</b>
       <b>scansources</b>. This will generate the Packages and Sources files, but will not generate Contents files  and
       can be slow with a large repository.

       Alternatively,  the  <b>--index</b>  <u>config</u>  option  will  call  <b>apt-ftparchive</b>  to index the package tree. <b>apt-</b>
       <b>ftparchive</b> can also generate Contents files (for use with <b>apt-file</b>), and can optionally use  a  cache  of
       package  information  to speed up multiple runs.  The <b>apt-ftparchive</b> configuration file will be generated
       automatically. This is however not fully tested.

       You should use either <b>--autoscanpackages</b> and <b>--autoscansources</b> or <b>--index</b>, not both, as they do basically
       the same thing.

       The default action (and the recommended) is <b>--scandetect</b> that probe for installed software  and  use  the
       best  choice  depending on what software you have installed (chooses between --index and --autoscan right
       now).

</pre><h4><b>REJECT</b></h4><pre>
       Changes files are rejected in the following conditions:
        * A file that is about to be installed already exist in the archive and is not identical to the one that
       is about to be installed.
        * Changes file is incomplete and has been there for $incompletetime time.
        * A file that is part of the Changes file is not yet big enough and the changes file has been there  for
       $incompletetime time.
        * A file that is part of the Changes file is bigger than specified.
        * Verify signatures is enabled and signature do not match.

       head  EXAMPLES

       Suppose  you  have  just uploaded package to repository e.g. with <b><a href="../man1/dput.1.html">dput</a></b>(1), and you don't want to wait for
       the cron process to pick them up. You can force immediate handling of incoming queue with  this  command.
       The second option allows overwriting existing archive files.
