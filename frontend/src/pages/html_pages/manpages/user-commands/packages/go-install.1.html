</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       go - tool for managing Go source code

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>go</b> <b>install</b> [<u>build</u> <u>flags</u>] [<u>packages</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Install compiles and installs the packages named by the import paths.

       Executables  are  installed  in  the directory named by the GOBIN environment variable, which defaults to
       $GOPATH/bin or $HOME/go/bin if the GOPATH environment variable is not set.  Executables  in  $GOROOT  are
       installed in $GOROOT/bin or $GOTOOLDIR instead of $GOBIN.

       If the arguments have version suffixes (like @latest or @v1.0.0), "go install" builds packages in module-
       aware  mode,  ignoring the go.mod file in the current directory or any parent directory, if there is one.
       This is useful for installing executables without affecting the dependencies  of  the  main  module.   To
       eliminate  ambiguity  about  which  module versions are used in the build, the arguments must satisfy the
       following constraints:

       • Arguments must be package paths or package patterns (with "..." wildcards).  They must not be  standard
         packages (like fmt), meta-patterns (std, cmd, all), or relative or absolute file paths.

       • All  arguments must have the same version suffix. Different queries are not allowed, even if they refer
         to the same version.

       • All arguments must refer to packages in the same module at the same version.

       • Package path arguments must refer to main packages. Pattern arguments will only match main packages.

       • No module is considered the "main" module. If the module containing packages named on the command  line
         has  a  go.mod  file,  it  must  not contain directives (replace and exclude) that would cause it to be
         interpreted differently than if it were the main module. The module must not require a  higher  version
         of itself.

       • Vendor  directories  are not used in any module. (Vendor directories are not included in the module zip
         files downloaded by ‘go install’.)

       If the arguments don’t have version suffixes, "go install" may run in module-aware mode or  GOPATH  mode,
       depending  on  the  GO111MODULE  environment  variable  and  the  presence of a go.mod file. See ‘go help
       modules’ for details.  If module-aware mode is enabled, "go install" runs in  the  context  of  the  main
       module.

       When    module-aware    mode   is   disabled,   other   packages   are   installed   in   the   directory
       $GOPATH/pkg/$GOOS_$GOARCH. When module-aware mode is enabled, other packages are built and cached but not
       installed.

       The -i flag installs the dependencies of the named packages as well.
       The -i flag is deprecated. Compiled packages are cached automatically.
