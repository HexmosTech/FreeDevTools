</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       dselect - Debian package management frontend

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>dselect</b> [<u>option</u>...] [<u>command</u>...]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>dselect</b> is one of the primary user interfaces for managing packages on a Debian system.  At the <b>dselect</b>
       main menu, the system administrator can:

       •   Update the list of available package versions,

       •   View the status of installed and available packages,

       •   Alter package selections and manage dependencies,

       •   Install new packages or upgrade to newer versions.

       <b>dselect</b>  operates  as  a front-end to <b><a href="../man1/dpkg.1.html">dpkg</a></b>(1), the low-level Debian package handling tool.  It features a
       full-screen package selections manager with package  depends  and  conflicts  resolver.   When  run  with
       administrator privileges, packages can be installed, upgraded and removed.  Various access methods can be
       configured  to  retrieve  available  package  version  information  and installable packages from package
       repositories.  Depending on the used access method, these repositories can be public archive  servers  on
       the  internet,  local  archive  servers  or  media discs.  The recommended access method is <u>apt</u>, which is
       provided by the package <b><a href="../man8/apt.8.html">apt</a></b>(8).

       Normally <b>dselect</b> is invoked without parameters.  An interactive menu is presented, offering  the  user  a
       list  of commands.  If a command is given as argument, then that command is started immediately.  Several
       command line parameters are still available to modify the running behaviour of <b>dselect</b> or show additional
       information about the program.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       All options  can  be  specified  both  on  the  command  line  and  in  the  <b>dselect</b>  configuration  file
       <u>/etc/dpkg/dselect.cfg</u> or the files on the configuration directory <u>/etc/dpkg/dselect.cfg.d/</u>.  Each line in
       the  configuration  file  is  either  an  option (exactly the same as the command line option but without
       leading hyphens) or a comment (if it starts with a ‘<b>#</b>’).

       <b>--admindir</b> <u>directory</u>
           Changes the directory where the dpkg ‘<u>status</u>’, ‘<u>available</u>’ and similar files are  located.   Defaults
           to <u><a href="file:/var/lib/dpkg">/var/lib/dpkg</a></u> if <b>DPKG_ADMINDIR</b> has not been set.

       <b>--instdir</b> <u>directory</u>
           Set  the  installation  directory,  which refers to the directory where packages get installed (since
           dpkg 1.21.2).  Defaults to «<u>/</u>» if <b>DPKG_ROOT</b> has not been set.

       <b>--root</b> <u>directory</u>
           Set the root directory to <u>directory</u>, which sets the installation directory  to  «<u>directory</u>»  and  the
           administrative directory to «<u>directory</u><a href="file:/var/lib/dpkg">/var/lib/dpkg</a>» (since dpkg 1.21.0).

       <b>-D</b><u>file</u>, <b>--debug</b> <u>file</u>
           Turn on debugging.  Debugging information is sent to <u>file</u>.

       <b>--expert</b>
           Turns on expert mode, i.e. doesn't display possibly annoying help messages.

       <b>--color</b> <u>screenpart</u>:[<u>foreground</u>],[<u>background</u>][:<u>attr</u>[<u>+attr</u>]...]
       <b>--colour</b> <u>screenpart</u>:[<u>foreground</u>],[<u>background</u>][:<u>attr</u>[<u>+attr</u>]...]
           Configures  screen colors.  This works only if your display supports colors.  This option may be used
           multiple times (and is best used in <u>dselect.cfg</u>).  Each use changes the color (and optionally,  other
           attributes) of one part of the screen.  The parts of the screen (from top to bottom) are:

           <b>title</b>
               The screen title.

           <b>listhead</b>
               The header line above the list of packages.

           <b>list</b>
               The scrolling list of packages (and also some help text).

           <b>listsel</b>
               The selected item in the list.

           <b>pkgstate</b>
               In the list of packages, the text indicating the current state of each package.

           <b>pkgstatesel</b>
               In the list of packages, the text indicating the current state of the currently selected package.

           <b>infohead</b>
               The header line that displays the state of the currently selected package.

           <b>infodesc</b>
               The package's short description.

           <b>info</b>
               Used to display package info such as the package's description.

           <b>infofoot</b>
               The last line of the screen when selecting packages.

           <b>query</b>
               Used to display query lines

           <b>helpscreen</b>
               Color of help screens.

           After  the  part of the screen comes a colon and the color specification.  You can specify either the
           foreground color, the background color, or both, overriding the  compiled-in  colors.   Use  standard
           curses color names.

           Optionally,  after the color specification is another colon, and an attribute specification.  This is
           a list of one or more attributes, separated by plus (‘+’) characters.  Available  attributes  include
           (not  all  of these will work on all terminals): <b>normal</b>, <b>standout</b>, <b>underline</b>, <b>reverse</b>, <b>blink</b>, <b>bright</b>,
           <b>dim</b>, <b>bold</b>

       <b>-?</b>, <b>--help</b>
           Print a brief help text and exit successfully.

       <b>--version</b>
           Print version information and exit successfully.

</pre><h4><b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       When <b>dselect</b> is started it can perform the following commands, either directly if it was specified on the
       command line or by prompting the user with a menu of available commands if running interactively:

   <b>access</b>
       Choose and configure an access method to access package repositories.

       By default, <b>dselect</b> provides several methods such as <u>media</u>, <u>file</u> or <u>ftp</u>, but other packages  may  provide
       additional methods, for example the <u>apt</u> access method provided by the <b><a href="../man8/apt.8.html">apt</a></b>(8) package.

       The use of the <u>apt</u> access method is strongly recommended.

   <b>update</b>
       Refresh the available packages database.

       Retrieves  a  list  of available package versions from the package repository, configured for the current
       access method, and update the dpkg database.  The package lists are commonly provided by  the  repository
       as  files  named  <u>Packages</u> or <u>Packages.gz</u>.  These files can be generated by repository maintainers, using
       the program <b><a href="../man1/dpkg-scanpackages.1.html">dpkg-scanpackages</a></b>(1).

       Details of the update command depend on the access method's  implementation.   Normally  the  process  is
       straightforward and requires no user interaction.

   <b>select</b>
       View or manage package selections and dependencies.

       This  is the main function of <b>dselect</b>.  In the select screen, the user can review a list of all available
       and installed packages.  When run with administrator privileges, it is  also  possible  to  interactively
       change  packages selection state.  <b>dselect</b> tracks the implications of these changes to other depending or
       conflicting packages.

       When a conflict or failed depends is detected, a dependency resolution subscreen is prompted to the user.
       In this screen, a list of conflicting or depending packages is shown, and for each  package  listed,  the
       reason  for its listing is shown.  The user may apply the suggestions proposed by <b>dselect</b>, override them,
       or back out all the changes, including the ones that created the unresolved depends or conflicts.

       The use of the interactive package selections management screen is explained in more detail below.

   <b>install</b>
       Installs selected packages.

       The configured access method will fetch installable or upgradable packages from the relevant repositories
       and install these using <b>dpkg</b>.  Depending on the implementation of the access method, all packages can  be
       prefetched  before  installation,  or  fetched when needed.  Some access methods may also remove packages
       that were marked for removal.

       If an error occurred during install, it is usually advisable to run install again.  In  most  cases,  the
       problems  will  disappear or be solved.  If problems persist or the installation performed was incorrect,
       please investigate into the causes and circumstances, and file a bug in the Debian bug  tracking  system.
       Instructions on how to do this can be found at &lt;https://bugs.debian.org/&gt; or by reading the documentation
       for <b><a href="../man1/bug.1.html">bug</a></b>(1) or <b><a href="../man1/reportbug.1.html">reportbug</a></b>(1), if these are installed.

       Details  of  the  install command depend on the access method's implementation.  The user's attention and
       input may be required during installation, configuration or removal of packages.   This  depends  on  the
       maintainer  scripts  in the package.  Some packages make use of the <b><a href="../man1/debconf.1.html">debconf</a></b>(1) library, allowing for more
       flexible or even automated installation setups.

   <b>config</b>
       Configures any previously installed, but not fully configured packages.

   <b>remove</b>
       Removes or purges installed packages, that are marked for removal.

   <b>quit</b>
       Quit <b>dselect</b>.

       Exits the program with zero (successful) error code.

</pre><h4><b>PACKAGE</b> <b>SELECTIONS</b> <b>MANAGEMENT</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Introduction</b>
       <b>dselect</b> directly exposes the administrator to some of the complexities involved with managing large  sets
       of  packages with many interdependencies.  For a user who is unfamiliar with the concepts and the ways of
       the Debian package management system, it can be quite overwhelming.  Although <b>dselect</b> is aimed at  easing
       package  management and administration, it is only instrumental in doing so and cannot be assumed to be a
       sufficient substitute for administrator skill and understanding.  The user is  required  to  be  familiar
       with  the  concepts underlying the Debian packaging system.  In case of doubt, consult the <b><a href="../man1/dpkg.1.html">dpkg</a></b>(1) manual
       page and the distribution policy.

       Unless <b>dselect</b> is run in expert or immediate mode, a help screen is first displayed  when  choosing  this
       command  from  the  menu.   The user is <u>strongly</u> advised to study all of the information presented in the
       online help screens, when one pops up.  The online help screens can at any time be invoked with  the  ‘<b>?</b>’
       key.

   <b>Screen</b> <b>layout</b>
       The select screen is by default split in a top and a bottom half.  The top half shows a list of packages.
       A  cursor  bar  can select an individual package, or a group of packages, if applicable, by selecting the
       group header.  The bottom half of the screen shows some details about the package currently  selected  in
       the top half of the screen.  The type of detail that is displayed can be varied.

       Pressing  the ‘<b>I</b>’ key toggles a full-screen display of the packages list, an enlarged view of the package
       details, or the equally split screen.

   <b>Package</b> <b>details</b> <b>view</b>
       The package details view by default shows the extended  package  description  for  the  package  that  is
       currently  selected  in  the packages status list.  The type of detail can be toggled by pressing the ‘<b>i</b>’
       key.  This alternates between:

       •   the extended description

       •   the control information for the installed version

       •   the control information for the available version

       In a dependency resolution screen, there is also the  possibility  of  viewing  the  specific  unresolved
       depends or conflicts related to the package and causing it to be listed.

   <b>Packages</b> <b>status</b> <b>list</b>
       The  main  select  screen  displays a list of all packages known to the Debian package management system.
       This includes packages installed on the system and packages known from the available packages database.

       For every package, the list shows the  package's  status,  priority,  section,  installed  and  available
       architecture,  installed  and  available versions, the package name and its short description, all in one
       line.  By pressing the ‘<b>A</b>’ key, the display of the installed and available architecture  can  be  toggled
       between  on  an  off.  By pressing the ‘<b>V</b>’ key, the display of the installed and available version can be
       toggled between on an off.  By pressing the ‘<b>v</b>’ key,  the  package  status  display  is  toggled  between
       verbose and shorthand.  Shorthand display is the default.

       The  shorthand  status  indication consists of four parts: an error flag, which should normally be clear,
       the current status, the last selection state and the current selection state.  The first  two  relate  to
       the actual state of the package, the second pair are about the selections set by the user.

       These are the meanings of the shorthand package status indicator codes:

           Error flag:

           <u>empty</u>   no error
           <b>R</b>       serious error, needs reinstallation;

           Installed state:

           <u>empty</u>   not installed;
           <b>*</b>       fully installed and configured;
           <b>-</b>       not installed but some config files may remain;
           <b>U</b>       unpacked but not yet configured;
           <b>C</b>       half-configured (an error happened);
           <b>I</b>       half-installed (an error happened).

           Current and requested selections:

           <b>*</b>       marked for installation or upgrade;
           <b>-</b>       marked for removal, configuration files remain;
           <b>=</b>       on hold: package will not be processed at all;
           <b>_</b>       marked for purge, also remove configuration;
           <b>n</b>       package is new and has yet to be marked.

   <b>Cursor</b> <b>and</b> <b>screen</b> <b>movement</b>
       The  package  selection list and the dependency conflict resolution screens can be navigated using motion
       commands mapped to the following keys:

           <b>p,</b> <b>Up,</b> <b>k</b>           move cursor bar up
           <b>n,</b> <b>Down,</b> <b>j</b>         move cursor bar down
           <b>P,</b> <b>Pgup,</b> <b>Backspace</b> scroll list 1 page up
           <b>N,</b> <b>Pgdn,</b> <b>Space</b>     scroll list 1 page down
           <b>^p</b>                 scroll list 1 line up
           <b>^n</b>                 scroll list 1 line down
           <b>t,</b> <b>Home</b>            jump to top of list
           <b>e,</b> <b>End</b>             jump to end of list
           <b>u</b>                  scroll info 1 page up
           <b>d</b>                  scroll info 1 page down
           <b>^u</b>                 scroll info 1 line up
           <b>^d</b>                 scroll info 1 line down
           <b>B,</b> <b>Left-arrow</b>      pan display 1/3 screen left
           <b>F,</b> <b>Right-arrow</b>     pan display 1/3 screen right
           <b>^b</b>                 pan display 1 character left
           <b>^f</b>                 pan display 1 character right

   <b>Searching</b> <b>and</b> <b>sorting</b>
       The list of packages can be searched by package name.  This is done by pressing ‘<b>/</b>’, and typing a  simple
       search  string.   The  string  is  interpreted  as a <b><a href="../man7/regex.7.html">regex</a></b>(7) regular expression.  If you add ‘<b>/d</b>’ to the
       search expression, dselect will also search in descriptions.  If you add ‘<b>/i</b>’ the  search  will  be  case
       insensitive.  You may combine these two suffixes like this: ‘<b>/id</b>’.  Repeated searching is accomplished by
       repeatedly  pressing  the  ‘<b>n</b>’ or ‘<b>\</b>’ keys, until the wanted package is found.  If the search reaches the
       bottom of the list, it wraps to the top and continues searching from there.

       The list sort order can be varied by pressing the ‘<b>o</b>’ and ‘<b>O</b>’ keys repeatedly.  The following  nine  sort
       orderings can be selected:

           <b>alphabet</b>
           <b>priority+section</b>
           <b>section+priority</b>
           <b>available</b>
           <b>available+priority</b>
           <b>available+section</b>
           <b>status</b>
           <b>status+priority</b>
           <b>status+section</b>

       Where not listed above explicitly, alphabetic order is used as the final subordering sort key.

   <b>Altering</b> <b>selections</b>
       The requested selection state of individual packages may be altered with the following commands:

           <b>+,</b> <b>Insert</b>    install or upgrade
           <b>=,</b> <b>H</b>         hold in present state and version
           <b>:,</b> <b>G</b>         unhold: upgrade or leave uninstalled
           <b>-,</b> <b>Delete</b>    remove, but leave configuration
           <b>_</b>            remove &amp; purge configuration

       When the change request results in one or more unsatisfied depends or conflicts, <b>dselect</b> prompts the user
       with a dependency resolution screen.  This will be further explained below.

       It  is  also possible to apply these commands to groups of package selections, by pointing the cursor bar
       onto a group header.  The exact grouping of packages is dependent on the current list ordering settings.

       Proper care should be taken when altering large groups of selections, because  this  can  instantaneously
       create  large  numbers  of unresolved depends or conflicts, all of which will be listed in one dependency
       resolution screen, making them very hard to handle.  In practice, only hold  and  unhold  operations  are
       useful when applied to groups.

   <b>Resolving</b> <b>depends</b> <b>and</b> <b>conflicts</b>
       When the change request results in one or more unsatisfied depends or conflicts, <b>dselect</b> prompts the user
       with a dependency resolution screen.  First however, an informative help screen is displayed.

       The  top  half of this screen lists all the packages that will have unresolved depends or conflicts, as a
       result of the requested change, and all the packages whose installation can resolve any of these  depends
       or  whose  removal  can  resolve  any  of the conflicts.  The bottom half defaults to show the depends or
       conflicts that cause the currently selected package to be listed.

       When the sublist of packages is displayed initially, <b>dselect</b> may have already set the requested selection
       status of some of the listed packages, in order to resolve the  depends  or  conflicts  that  caused  the
       dependency  resolution  screen to be displayed.  Usually, it is best to follow up the suggestions made by
       <b>dselect</b>.

       The listed packages' selection state may be reverted to the original settings, as they  were  before  the
       unresolved  depends  or  conflicts  were  created, by pressing the ‘<b>R</b>’ key.  By pressing the ‘<b>D</b>’ key, the
       automatic suggestions are reset, but the change that  caused  the  dependency  resolution  screen  to  be
       prompted  is  kept as requested.  Finally, by pressing ‘<b>U</b>’, the selections are again set to the automatic
       suggestion values.

   <b>Establishing</b> <b>the</b> <b>requested</b> <b>selections</b>
       By pressing <b>enter</b>, the currently displayed  set  of  selections  is  accepted.   If  <b>dselect</b>  detects  no
       unresolved  depends as a result of the requested selections, the new selections will be set.  However, if
       there are any unresolved depends, <b>dselect</b> will again prompt the user with a dependency resolution screen.

       To alter a set of selections that creates unresolved depends or conflicts and forcing <b>dselect</b>  to  accept
       it,  press  the ‘<b>Q</b>’ key.  This sets the selections as specified by the user, unconditionally.  Generally,
       don't do this unless you've read the fine print.

       The opposite effect, to back out any selections change requests and go  back  to  the  previous  list  of
       selections,  is  attained  by  pressing  the  ‘<b>X</b>’ or <b>escape</b> keys.  By repeatedly pressing these keys, any
       possibly detrimental changes to the requested package selections can be backed out completely to the last
       established settings.

       If you mistakenly establish some settings and wish to revert all the  selections  to  what  is  currently
       installed  on the system, press the ‘<b>C</b>’ key.  This is somewhat similar to using the unhold command on all
       packages, but provides a more obvious panic button in cases where the user pressed <b>enter</b> by accident.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>0</b>   The requested command was successfully performed.

       <b>2</b>   Fatal or unrecoverable error due to invalid command-line usage, or interactions with the system, such
           as accesses to the database, memory allocations, etc.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>DPKG_ROOT</b>
           If set and the <b>--instdir</b> or <b>--root</b> options have not been specified, it will be used as the filesystem
           root directory (since dpkg 1.21.0).

       <b>DPKG_ADMINDIR</b>
           If set and the <b>--admindir</b> or <b>--root</b> option have not been specified, it  will  be  used  as  the  <b>dpkg</b>
           database directory (since dpkg 1.21.0).

       <b>HOME</b>
           If set, <b>dselect</b> will use it as the directory from which to read the user specific configuration file.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>dselect</b>  package  selection  interface  is  confusing  to some new users.  Reportedly, it even makes
       seasoned kernel developers cry.

       The documentation is lacking.

       There is no help option in the main menu.

       The visible list of available packages cannot be reduced.

       The built in access methods can no longer stand up to current quality standards.  Use the  access  method
