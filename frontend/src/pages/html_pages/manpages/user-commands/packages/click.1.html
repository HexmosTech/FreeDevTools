</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       click - package management tool for Ubuntu Touch

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       click command [options] [arguments]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Click</u>  is  a  packaging format for Ubuntu Touch applications, independent of the packaging format used to
       deliver the underlying system.  The <u>click</u> program is the basic tool used to build, install,  remove,  and
       otherwise manipulate these packages.

       <u>click</u>’s various functions are available via a number of commands, described in detail below.

       While <u>click</u> supports per-user installation, packages are normally unpacked as a special <b>clickpkg</b> user, to
       ensure  that  applications  cannot modify their own code; it is a design goal to ensure that <u>click</u> can be
       used to install untrusted code which is then confined using <u>AppArmor</u>.  As such, <u>click</u> should normally  be
       run as root (e.g. using <b>sudo</b>) when installing packages; it will drop privileges as needed.

</pre><h4><b>COMMAND</b> <b>OVERVIEW</b></h4><pre>
          click build DIRECTORY
          click buildsource DIRECTORY
          click chroot
          click contents PATH
          click framework list
          click hook install HOOK
          click hook remove HOOK
          click hook run-system
          click hook run-user
          click info PATH
          click install PACKAGE-FILE
          click list
          click pkgdir {PACKAGE-NAME|PATH}
          click register PACKAGE-NAME VERSION
          click unregister PACKAGE-NAME [VERSION]
          click verify PACKAGE-FILE

</pre><h4><b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>click</b> <b>build</b> <b>DIRECTORY</b>
       Build  a Click package from the contents of DIRECTORY.  The build directory must contain a JSON-formatted
       manifest, described further in Click’s file-format documentation; by default, this is expected to  be  in
       <b>manifest.json</b> at the top level of the build directory.

       The resulting <b>.click</b> file is written to the current directory, so to avoid confusion you should generally
       ensure that your working directory is not inside the build directory when running this command.

       While  it  is  possible  to build a new version of a Click package by unpacking and repacking an existing
       package, this is not normally recommended because it requires some care to put the manifest file back  in
       the  right  place.   It  is best to keep your application’s code in separate revision control rather than
       relying on recovering it from packages.

       Options:

       <b>-m</b> <u>PATH</u>, <b>--manifest=</b><u>PATH</u>
              Read package manifest from PATH (default: <b>manifest.json</b>).

       <b>-I</b> <u>file-pattern</u>, <b>--ignore=</b><u>file-pattern</u>
              Ignore the given shell-pattern when building the package.  The option  may  be  repeated  multiple
              times to list multiple patterns to exclude.

       <b>--no-validate</b>
              Don’t run checks from click-reviewers-tools on the resulting .click file.

   <b>click</b> <b>buildsource</b> <b>DIRECTORY</b>
       Build  a  source package in <b>.tar.gz</b> format from the contents of DIRECTORY.  This allows you to distribute
       source code in the case where your package contains compiled code (and so  the  Click  package  does  not
       constitute its own source).

       The  resulting  <b>.tar.gz</b>  file  is  written  to  the  current  directory, so to avoid confusion you should
       generally ensure that your working directory is not inside the build directory when running this command.

       Options:

       <b>-m</b> <u>PATH</u>, <b>--manifest=</b><u>PATH</u>
              Read package manifest from PATH (default: <b>manifest.json</b>).

       <b>-I</b> <u>file-pattern</u>, <b>--ignore=</b><u>file-pattern</u>
              Ignore the given shell-pattern when building the package.  The option  may  be  repeated  multiple
              times to list multiple patterns to exclude.

   <b>click</b> <b>chroot</b>
       Manage chroot environments for cross-building Click packages.

       Options:

       <b>-a</b> <u>ARCH</u>, <b>--architecture</b> <u>ARCH</u>
              Set the target architecture.

       <b>-f</b> <u>FRAMEWORK</u>, <b>--framework</b> <u>FRAMEWORK</u>
              Set the target framework (default: ubuntu-sdk-13.10).

       <b>-s</b> <u>SERIES</u>, <b>--series</b> <u>SERIES</u>
              Set the target series for newly-created chroots (default: a series appropriate for the framework).
              This option is mainly for debugging; use -f instead.

       Subcommands:

       <b>begin-session</b> <b>SESSION</b>
              Begin a persistent chroot session.

       <b>create</b> Create a chroot.

       <b>destroy</b>
              Destroy a chroot.

       <b>end-session</b> <b>SESSION</b>
              End a persistent chroot session.

       <b>install</b> <b>[-n</b> <b>SESSION]</b> <b>PACKAGES</b>
              Install packages in the chroot.

       <b>maint</b> <b>[-n</b> <b>SESSION]</b> <b>COMMAND</b> <b>ARGUMENTS</b>
              Run  a  maintenance  command  in the chroot.  Unlike <b>run</b>, this runs its command as root inside the
              chroot, and its effects on the chroot will persist after <b>click</b> <b>chroot</b> <b>maint</b> exits.

              If a session name is given, run the command in that session.  The  session  must  previously  have
              been created by <b>click</b> <b>chroot</b> <b>begin-session</b>.

       <b>run</b> <b>[-n</b> <b>SESSION]</b> <b>COMMAND</b> <b>ARGUMENTS</b>
              Run a program in the chroot.

              If  a  session  name  is given, run the command in that session.  The session must previously have
              been created by <b>click</b> <b>chroot</b> <b>begin-session</b>.

       <b>upgrade</b> <b>[-n</b> <b>SESSION]</b>
              Upgrade the chroot.

   <b>click</b> <b>contents</b> <b>PATH</b>
       Display the contents of the Click package in PATH as a file listing.

   <b>click</b> <b>framework</b> <b>list</b>
       Display a list of available frameworks as one framework per line.

   <b>click</b> <b>hook</b> <b>install</b> <b>HOOK</b>
       Install files associated with HOOK for any Click packages that attach to it.

       This is normally only called by maintainer scripts of system packages, by way of <a href="../man1/dh_click.1.html">dh_click</a>(1).

       Options:

       <b>--root=</b><u>PATH</u>
              Look for additional packages in PATH.

   <b>click</b> <b>hook</b> <b>remove</b> <b>HOOK</b>
       Remove files associated with HOOK for any Click packages that attach to it.

       This is normally only called by maintainer scripts of system packages, by way of <a href="../man1/dh_click.1.html">dh_click</a>(1).

       Options:

       <b>--root=</b><u>PATH</u>
              Look for additional packages in PATH.

   <b>click</b> <b>hook</b> <b>run-system</b>
       Run all system-level hooks for all installed Click packages.  This is useful when starting up from images
       with preinstalled packages which may not have had their system-level hooks run properly when building the
       image.

       Options:

       <b>--root=</b><u>PATH</u>
              Look for additional packages in PATH.

   <b>click</b> <b>hook</b> <b>run-user</b>
       Run all user-level hooks for all Click packages registered for a given user.  This is useful  at  session
       startup to catch up with packages that may have been preinstalled and registered for all users.

       Options:

       <b>--root=</b><u>PATH</u>
              Look for additional packages in PATH.

       <b>--user=</b><u>USER</u>
              Run user-level hooks for USER (default: current user).

   <b>click</b> <b>info</b> <b>{PACKAGE-NAME|PACKAGE-FILE}</b>
       When  given  a package name (that is, a string containing no <b>/</b> characters), display the manifest for that
       package, if it is registered for the current user.

       When given a path (that is, a string containing at least one <b>/</b> character, or a  string  containing  no  <b>/</b>
       characters that is not a registered package name), attempt to treat that as a path to a file containing a
       Click package and display the manifest for that package.

       Options:

       <b>--root=</b><u>PATH</u>
              Look for additional packages in PATH.

       <b>--user=</b><u>USER</u>
              List packages registered by USER (if you have permission).

   <b>click</b> <b>install</b> <b>PACKAGE-FILE</b>
       Install the Click package in PACKAGE-FILE.

       This  is  a  low-level  tool;  to  install  a  package as an ordinary user you should generally use <b>pkcon</b>
       <b>install-local</b> <b>PACKAGE-FILE</b> or some higher-level user interface  instead,  which  take  care  to  use  the
       correct set of options.  (Do not use <b>sudo</b> when invoking <b>pkcon</b>, as it needs to know the calling user.)

       <b>click</b> <b>install</b> may be used to preinstall a package in an image such that it will be available to all users
       by  default.   When  doing  this,  you  should  normally  install  it  to one of the databases defined in
       <b>/etc/click/databases/</b> other than the default of <b>/var/lib/clickpkg</b>.  For example:
          sudo click install –root=/custom/click –all-users foo.click

       The <b>--force-missing-framework</b> option is necessary while working with development versions of  SDKs  which
       have not yet put a framework declaration in place.

       You  should always register installed packages either for a specific user or for all users; if you do not
       do this then the packages may  be  garbage-collected  later.   You  can  do  this  using  the  <b>--user</b>  or
       <b>--all-users</b> options to this command, or using the <b>click</b> <b>register</b> command.

       Options:

       <b>--root=</b><u>PATH</u>
              Install packages underneath PATH.

       <b>--force-missing-framework</b>
              Install despite missing system framework.

       <b>--user=</b><u>USER</u>
              Register package for USER.

       <b>--all-users</b>
              Register package for all users.

   <b>click</b> <b>list</b>
       Display  a list of installed packages, either as one package per line with each line containing a package
       name and version separated by a tab (the default), or as a JSON array of manifests.

       By default, <b>click</b> <b>list</b> shows only packages registered for the current user.  The <b>--all</b> option  causes  it
       to show all installed packages, regardless of user registrations.

       Options:

       <b>--root=</b><u>PATH</u>
              Look for additional packages in PATH.

       <b>--all</b>  List all installed packages.

       <b>--user=</b><u>USER</u>
              List packages registered by USER (if you have permission).

       <b>--manifest</b>
              Format output as a JSON array of manifests.

   <b>click</b> <b>pkgdir</b> <b>{PACKAGE-NAME|PATH}</b>
       When  given  a  package  name (that is, a string containing no <b>/</b> characters), display the directory where
       that package is installed, if it is registered for the current user.

       When given a path (that is, a string containing at least one <b>/</b> character), attempt to  treat  that  as  a
       path  to a file within a Click package and print the top-level directory where that package is installed,
       if one exists.  This is particularly useful in hooks that need to find the  top-level  package  directory
       based on a symbolic link to a single file within it.

       Exits zero if and only if a directory for the given package name or path was found.

       Options:

       <b>--root=</b><u>PATH</u>
              Look for additional packages in PATH.

       <b>--user=</b><u>USER</u>
              List packages registered by USER (if you have permission).

   <b>click</b> <b>register</b> <b>PACKAGE-NAME</b> <b>VERSION</b>
       Register  an installed Click package for a user.  This will normally cause user-level hooks to be run for
       that user, which are needed for things such as making the application’s <b>.desktop</b> file  available  to  the
       user interface.

       Options:

       <b>--root=</b><u>PATH</u>
              Look for additional packages in PATH.

       <b>--user=</b><u>USER</u>
              Register package for USER (default: current user).

       <b>--all-users</b>
              Register package for all users.

   <b>click</b> <b>unregister</b> <b>PACKAGE-NAME</b> <b>[VERSION]</b>
       Unregister  an installed Click package for a user, and remove it entirely if no other users still have it
       registered and if it does not appear to be running.  This will normally cause user-level hooks to be  run
       for that user, which are needed for things such as removing the application’s <b>.desktop</b> file from the user
       interface.

       If a version is specified, then the registered version must match it in order to be removed.

       Options:

       <b>--root=</b><u>PATH</u>
              Look for additional packages in PATH.

       <b>--user=</b><u>USER</u>
              Unregister package for USER (default: <b>$SUDO_USER</b>, if known).

       <b>--all-users</b>
              Unregister package that was previously registered for all users.

   <b>click</b> <b>verify</b> <b>PACKAGE-FILE</b>
       Verify the Click package in PACKAGE-FILE.

       The  <b>--force-missing-framework</b>  option is necessary while working with development versions of SDKs which
       have not yet put a framework declaration in place.

       Options:

       <b>--root=</b><u>PATH</u>
              Install packages underneath PATH.

       <b>--force-missing-framework</b>
              Install despite missing system framework.
