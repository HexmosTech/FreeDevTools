</pre><h4><b>Synopsis</b></h4><pre>
       &lt;!-- AUTOGENERATED USAGE DESCRIPTIONS --&gt;

</pre><h4><b>Description</b></h4><pre>
       Used to set access controls on private packages.

       For all of the subcommands, <b>npm</b> <b>access</b> will perform actions on the packages
       in the current working directory if no package name is passed to the
       subcommand.

        • public / restricted (deprecated):
          Set a package to be either publicly accessible or restricted.

        • grant / revoke (deprecated):
          Add or remove the ability of users and teams to have read-only or read-write
          access to a package.

        • 2fa-required / 2fa-not-required (deprecated):
          Configure whether a package requires that anyone publishing it have two-factor
          authentication enabled on their account.

        • ls-packages (deprecated):
          Show all of the packages a user or a team is able to access, along with the
          access level, except for read-only public packages (it won't print the whole
          registry listing)

        • ls-collaborators (deprecated):
          Show all of the access privileges for a package. Will only show permissions
          for packages to which you have at least read access. If <b>&lt;user&gt;</b> is passed in,
          the list is filtered only to teams <u>that</u> user happens to belong to.

        • edit (not implemented)

</pre><h4><b>Details</b></h4><pre>
       <b>npm</b> <b>access</b> always operates directly on the current registry, configurable
       from the command line using <b>--registry=&lt;registry</b> <b>url&gt;</b>.

       Unscoped packages are <u>always</u> <u>public</u>.

       Scoped packages <u>default</u> <u>to</u> <u>restricted</u>, but you can either publish them as
       public using <b>npm</b> <b>publish</b> <b>--access=public</b>, or set their access as public using
       <b>npm</b> <b>access</b> <b>public</b> after the initial publish.

       You must have privileges to set the access of a package:

        • You are an owner of an unscoped or scoped package.

        • You are a member of the team that owns a scope.

        • You have been given read-write privileges for a package, either as a member
          of a team or directly as an owner.

       If you have two-factor authentication enabled then you'll be prompted to
       provide an otp token, or may use the <b>--otp=...</b> option to specify it on
       the command line.

       If your account is not paid, then attempts to publish scoped packages will
       fail with an HTTP 402 status code (logically enough), unless you use
       <b>--access=public</b>.

       Management of teams and team memberships is done with the <b>npm</b> <b>team</b> command.
