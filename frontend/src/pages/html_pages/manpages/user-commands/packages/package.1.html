</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       package - register package user via mailagent

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>package</b> <u>address</u> <u>system</u> <u>version</u> <u>patchlevel</u> [ mailpatches | notifypatches ]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This  command  is  not intended to be run directly by a user, but may appear in any mail whose subject is
       set to <u>Command</u>. Such mail will be processed by the <u><a href="../man1/mailagent.1.html">mailagent</a></u>(1), which will extract all  lines  beginning
       with  <u>@SH</u>,  which  may  specify this command. The mailagent first sets environment variables that will be
       used by the command.

       <u>Package</u> is used to  notify  the  author  of  a  package  about  its  users.   It  is  normally  generated
       automatically by the MailAuthor.U unit when the user runs <u>Configure</u>.

       If  the  <u>patchlevel</u>  specified  is  not  the latest for that <u>system</u> and <u>version</u>, mail is immediately sent
       suggesting that they upgrade and remindng them how to request the latest patches.

       The final parameter, if included may be set to <u>mailpatches</u> to specify that the user would  like  to  have
       future  patches  mailed  to  them, or <u>notifypatches</u> to specify that a mail notification of future patches
       should be sent, rather than the entire patch.

       The user's <u>address</u> and notification request are saved in the file <u>users</u> in the package's directory.

       <u>Package</u> performs an approximate address match  in  order  to  avoid  duplicate  entries.   Whenever  this
       elimination occurs, a warning message is issued in the logfile.  Two addresses will be said equivalent if
       one of them has an added machine name or if they are really equal. Therefore, the following addresses are
       equivalent:

            <a href="mailto:ram@acri.fr">ram@acri.fr</a>
            <a href="mailto:ram@main.acri.fr">ram@main.acri.fr</a>

       whereas the following two are <u>not</u> equivalent, unfortunately:

            <a href="mailto:ram@acri.acri.fr">ram@acri.acri.fr</a>
            <a href="mailto:ram@main.acri.fr">ram@main.acri.fr</a>

       When a user is asking to be left alone, it is important to let him know if the request failed, because he
       will  be  annoyed  when  the  next  set  of patches is issued and he still gets them despite his previous
       request. Therefore, if no approximate match occurs, a warning message  is  sent  back,  with  a  list  of
       addresses  that  are  <u>close</u>  to  his  own  e-mail address, but not equivalent. Fortunately, the following
       addresses are considered close:

            <a href="mailto:ram@acri.fr">ram@acri.fr</a>
            <a href="mailto:ram@somewhere.com">ram@somewhere.com</a>
            <a href="mailto:raphael@main.acri.fr">raphael@main.acri.fr</a>
            <a href="mailto:manfredi@acri.acri.fr">manfredi@acri.acri.fr</a>

       because they either have the same login (important when someone changes company) or share the same domain
       or sub-domain part.

       In order to edit the <u>users</u> file, the <u>edusers</u> script should be used. For one thing, it will let  you  edit
       the  <u>users</u>  file  from  whatever package you name in the command line, but it will also properly lock the
       file so that the execution of <u>package</u> will stall for the duration of the  manual  edition  (provided  you
       have a strict locking policy defined in your <u><a href="file:~/.mailagent">~/.mailagent</a></u> configuration file).

</pre><h4><b>FORWARDING</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Package</u> supports command forwarding as described in the <u><a href="../man1/mailhelp.1.html">mailhelp</a></u>(1) page.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <a href="file:~/.mailagent">~/.mailagent</a>        configuration file for mailagent.
       System/users        list of users of that system.
                           This file consists of single line records, one for each registered user.  Each record
                           consists of three tab-separated fields.

                           The  first  field  indicates  the  level of updates requested by the user by a single
                           letter as follows:
                           <b>M</b>      Mail future patches directly to the user when they are issued.
                           <b>N</b>      Notify the user of future patches.
                           <b>U</b>      The users chose to let the author know that they have tried the  program,  but
                                  does not wish to know about future updates.
                           <b>L</b>      The user is no longer interested in the program and wants to be left alone.

                           The  second  field  is  their  last  notified patch level, or a dash (<b>-</b>) if it is not
                           known.

                           The third field is the user's Email address.
       Log/agentlog        mailagent's log file
