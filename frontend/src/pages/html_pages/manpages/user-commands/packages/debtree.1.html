</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       debtree - show relationships between packages

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>debtree</b> [<u>options</u>] <u>package</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Generates dependency graphs (in `dot' syntax) for the specified package.  The output is written to STDOUT
       and can be used as input for the command <b><a href="../man1/dot.1.html">dot</a></b>(1) from the package `graphviz'.

       Dependency  graphs  will by default show (pre-)dependencies, recommended packages, unversioned conflicts,
       and virtual packages provided by the requested package. Optionally also suggested packages and  versioned
       conflicts can be included.

       Besides  graphs  showing  regular  dependencies,  <b>debtree</b>  can  also  generate graphs showing the reverse
       dependencies of and the build dependencies for a package.

   <b>Dependency</b> <b>types</b>
       The type of dependency between packages is by line type  and  the  color  of  the  arrow  indicating  the
       dependency:
           Build-Depends:           dark gold, bold
           Build-Depends-Indep:     light gold
           Pre-Depends:             purple, bold
           Depends:                 blue
           Recommends:              black
           Suggests:                black, dotted
           Conflicts:               red
           Provides:                green, inverted arrow

       By  default the version requirements for versioned dependencies and conflicts will be shown alongside the
       arrow.

   <b>Alternative</b> <b>dependencies</b>
       Alternative dependencies will be shown within a single node (a rectangular shape  with  horizontal  lines
       separating the packages).

       An alternative dependency will be indicated by a single arrow, unless one or more of the dependencies are
       versioned. In that case a separate arrow (ending at the relevant package) showing the version requirement
       is  drawn.  Arrows  for  dependencies on a package in a set of alternatives will originate at the correct
       package in the set, though in some cases this may be on the separation line between two alternatives.

       If a package included in an alternative dependency also needs to be displayed separately or is also  part
       of some other alternative dependency set, its dependencies will only be included once, with the package's
       first  occurrence.  For the secondary occurrences the package name will be shown between square brackets:
       `[...]'.

       See also the --show-installed option below.

   <b>Virtual</b> <b>packages</b>
       Virtual packages will be shown as an octagonal shape with a  green  inverted  arrow  from  the  providing
       package(s).

       If  only  a  single  package  provides  the  virtual package, this package (and its dependencies) will be
       displayed in the graph.

       If there are multiple packages that provide the virtual package, they will be shown within a single  node
       with  rounded  corners  but  only  if there are less than three (or the number set by the --max-providers
       option).  If there are more than that number, this will be indicated by an ellipsis (`...') in the  node;
       no  individual  packages  will  be  shown but the number of providing packages is indicated alongside the
       arrow.  Dependencies of the providing packages will not be shown.

       A regular dependency graph will by default also show any  virtual  packages  provided  by  the  requested
       binary package.

   <b>Unknown</b> <b>packages</b>
       Packages  that  are  listed as dependency, but that are unknown in the package database will be displayed
       with a reddish shade. In the case of alternative dependencies, the package name  will  be  shown  between
       question marks: `?...?'.

   <b>Package</b> <b>versions</b>
       If  multiple  versions  of  a package are available, the dependency information for the highest available
       version will be used, with one exception. If the --show-installed option is used, the  installed  version
       will be used for packages that are installed on the system.

   <b>Managing</b> <b>graph</b> <b>size</b> <b>and</b> <b>complexity</b>
       <b>debtree</b>  offers several mechanisms to help reduce the size of dependency graphs of packages with large or
       complex dependency trees. The first mechanism is to limit what types of dependencies  are  included,  for
       example  excluding  Recommended  or  Conflicting  packages  from  the  graph. The second mechanism is the
       configuration of lists of <u>skip</u> and <u>end</u> <u>packages</u>; see the section CONFIGURATION  below  for  details.  The
       last mechanism is to place a hard limit on the depth of the dependency tree.

       It  is not possible to include the dependencies of suggested packages. Doing so would in almost all cases
       result in an explosion of the size of graphs.

       For some packages it is unfortunately almost impossible to generate a usable dependency graph due to  the
       number  of dependencies they have. This is often the case for meta packages, for example those for KDE or
       GNOME.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       This program follows the usual GNU command line syntax, with long options starting with two dashes (`-').
       An overview of supported options is included below.

       <b>--show-installed</b>, <b>-I</b>
              Show which packages are installed on the system.

              The nodes for packages which are installed  on  the  system  will  be  colored  light  green.  For
              alternative  dependencies,  only  installed  packages  will  be  included  (an ellipsis is used to
              indicate omitted alternatives); for unsatisfied alternative dependencies, all alternatives will be
              included.

       <b>--show-rdeps</b>, <b>-R</b>
              Also show reverse dependencies of the package and any virtual packages it provides.

              Reverse dependencies that are not installed will be colored light  yellow;  installed  ones  light
              blue. Displaying reverse dependencies of type Suggests is not supported.

              Use  of  the  option --show-installed in combination with this option is recommended. See also the
              options --rdeps-depth and --max-rdeps.  This option is ignored if --build-dep is also specified.

       <b>--build-dep</b>, <b>-b</b>
              Show build dependencies instead of package dependencies.

              Suggested packages will never be included in a build dependency graph.  If there  are  alternative
              packages to satisfy a dependency, normally only the first alternative will be shown. However, when
              used  in  combination with the --show-installed option, all already installed alternatives will be
              included for satisfied dependencies (unless the --no-alternatives option is also given).

       <b>--arch</b>=<u>architecture</u>
              Specify the architecture (or `all') for the build dependency graph. If the option --buildep option
              is not present, this option will be ignored.  Default is the architecture of the system  on  which
              the command is being run.

              If  architecture  `all'  is  specified,  all  build  dependencies  will  be  shown.   If any build
              dependencies have `architecture conditions', those will be displayed in a graph.

              If an architecture is specified (including the default), only build dependencies that are relevant
              for that architecture will be shown; build dependencies for other architectures will be ignored.

       <b>--with-suggests</b>, <b>-S</b>
              Include suggested packages; dependencies of suggested packages are never included.

       <b>--no-recommends</b>
              Don't show recommended packages.

              This option will be ignored if used in combination with the --with-suggests option.

       <b>--no-alternatives</b>
              Only show the first package from a set of alternative dependencies. Effectively  this  shows  what
              package would be installed by default (in most cases).

       <b>--no-provides</b>
              Don't show virtual packages provided by the requested package.

       <b>--max-providers</b>=<u>number</u>
              When  there are multiple packages providing a virtual package, only show the providing packages if
              there are less than this number. Default is 3.

       <b>--no-versions</b>
              Don't show the versions for versioned dependencies.

       <b>--no-conflicts</b>
              Don't show unversioned conflicts.

       <b>--versioned-conflicts</b>, <b>-VC</b>
              Include versioned conflicts; by default only unversioned conflicts are shown.

              This option will be ignored if used in combination with the --no-conflicts option.

       <b>--max-depth</b>=<u>number</u>
              Limit the number of levels of dependencies that is traversed.

              This option sets  a  limit  to  the  number  of  levels  <b>debtree</b>  will  recurse  when  determining
              dependencies.  Packages  at  the  specified  level  will  be  treated as <u>end</u> <u>packages</u> (see section
              CONFIGURATION below).

              The option can be used both to reduce the size of graphs.

       <b>--rdeps-depth</b>=<u>number</u>
              The maximum number of levels for reverse dependencies.

              By default only one level  is  displayed.  Use  this  option  to  display  more  levels.   Implies
              --show-rdeps.

       <b>--max-rdeps</b>=<u>number</u>
              Limit the display of indirect reverse dependencies.

              When  displaying  multiple  levels of reverse dependencies, a reverse dependency that itself has a
              lot of reverse dependencies can really explode the graph.  By default up  to  5  indirect  reverse
              dependencies are shown individually.

       <b>--no-skip</b>
              Also display dependencies that are suppressed by default (e.g. libc6).

              When  selected,  <u>skip</u>  <u>packages</u>  will  be  treated  as  <u>end</u>  <u>packages</u>  instead.   This  means that
              dependencies that by default are not included in graphs, will now be shown, but their dependencies
              will not. See also the section CONFIGURATION below.

       <b>--skiplist</b>=<u>file</u>
              File with the list of custom <u>skip</u> <u>packages</u>. This overrides  global  skiplist  configuration.   See
              also the section CONFIGURATION.

       <b>--endlist</b>=<u>file</u>
              File  with the list of custom <u>end</u> <u>packages</u>. This overrides global endlist configuration.  See also
              the section CONFIGURATION

       <b>--show-all</b>
              Display the full dependency tree.

              When selected, all default limits in the form of <u>end</u> and  <u>skip</u> <u>packages</u> are disabled and the  full
              dependency graph for the package will be generated. See also the section CONFIGURATION below.

              This  option  implies  the  --no-skip  option, but can be used in combination with the --max-depth
              option. Note that this option does not affect the types of dependencies that are included.

       <b>--rotate</b>, <b>-r</b>
              Draw the graph top-town instead of left-to-right.

       <b>--condense</b>
              Activates an option of <b><a href="../man1/dot.1.html">dot</a></b>(1) that can help reduce the clutter in dense  graphs  by  concentrating
              lines  (relationships) between packages together for parts of their paths.

       <b>--quiet</b>, <b>-q</b>
              Suppress any informational/warning messages.

       <b>--verbose</b>, <b>-v</b>
              Increase verbosity.

              Displays additional informational and debug messages; can be repeated up to three times.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>debtree</b>  can  be configured to limit the size and complexity of dependency graphs. This is done using two
       lists:

       /etc/debtree/skiplist, <a href="file:~/.debtree/skiplist">~/.debtree/skiplist</a>
              List of <u>skip</u> <u>packages</u>. Packages included in this list are completely  excluded  from  graphs.  The
              list  should  only  contain  dependencies  that  are  so common that including them in graphs only
              clutters the graph and does not really add any information. Examples are libc6 and zlib1g.  If  an
              alternative  dependency  contains  only  skip packages it will be omitted; if it contains a mix of
              skip and non-skip packages, the presence of the skip packages will  be  shown  using  an  ellipsis
              ('...').

       /etc/debtree/endlist, <a href="file:~/.debtree/endlist">~/.debtree/endlist</a>
              List  of  <u>end</u>  <u>packages</u>.  Packages  included  in  this  list  are  shown  in  the graph, but their
              dependencies will not be shown. A diamond shape is used to indicate an end package; in the case of
              alternative dependencies, the package name will be shown between braces: `{...}'.

              Preferably only packages that offer a functionality that is somewhat  distinct  from  its  reverse
              dependencies  should  be  included in this list. In some cases it may be necessary to also include
              packages because their dependency tree is just too big or complex.

       If a list is present under the HOME directory of the user, that file will be used instead of the  default
       file in /etc/debtree/.

       See also the options --no-skip, --show-all and --max-depth, --skiplist, --endlist.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Below  are  some  basic usage examples for <b>debtree</b>.  For more extensive examples of graphs and additional
       information, please see the <b>debtree</b> website: <u>https://salsa.debian.org/debian/debtree</u>.

       $ debtree dpkg &gt;dpkg.dot
              Generate the dependency graph for package <u>dpkg</u> and save the output to a file `dpkg.dot'.

       $ dot -Tsvg -o dpkg.svg dpkg.dot
              Use <b><a href="../man1/dot.1.html">dot</a></b>(1) to generate an SVG image from the `.dot' file.

       $ debtree dpkg | dot -Tpng &gt;dpkg.png
              Generate the dependency graph for package <u>dpkg</u> as PNG image and save the  resulting  output  to  a
              file.

       $ debtree -b dpkg | dot -Tps | kghostview - &amp;
              Generate  the  build  dependency  graph  for package <u>dpkg</u> in postscript format and view the result
              using KDE's <b><a href="../man1/kghostview.1.html">kghostview</a></b>(1).
