</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       lintian - Static analysis tool for Debian packages

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>lintian</b> [<u>action</u>] [<u>options</u>] [<u>packages</u>] ...

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Lintian dissects Debian packages and reports bugs and policy violations.  It contains automated checks
       for many aspects of Debian policy as well as some checks for common errors.

       There are two ways to specify binary, udeb or source packages for Lintian to process: by file name (the
       .deb file for a binary package or the .dsc file for a source package), or by naming a <u>.changes</u> file.

       If you specify a <u>.changes</u> file, Lintian will process all packages listed in that file.  This is
       convenient when checking a new package before uploading it.

       If you specify packages to be checked or use the option <b>--packages-from-file</b>, the packages requested will
       be processed.  Otherwise, if <u>debian/changelog</u> exists, it is parsed to determine the name of the .changes
       file to look for in the parent directory.  See "CHECKING LAST BUILD" for more information.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Actions of the lintian command: (Only one action can be specified per invocation)

       <b>-c</b>, <b>--check</b>
           Run all checks over the specified packages.  This is the default action.

       <b>-C</b> chk1,chk2,..., <b>--check-part</b> chk1,chk2,...
           Run  only  the  specified  checks.   You  can  either  specify  the  name  of the check script or the
           abbreviation.  For details, see the "CHECKS" section below.

       <b>-F</b>, <b>--ftp-master-rejects</b>
           Run only the checks that issue tags that result in automatic rejects from the  Debian  upload  queue.
           The  list  of  such tags is refreshed with each Lintian release, so may be slightly out of date if it
           has changed recently.

           This is implemented via a profile and thus this option cannot be used together with <b>--profile</b>.

       <b>-T</b> tag1,tag2,..., <b>--tags</b> tag1,tag2,...
           Run only the checks that issue the requested tags.  The tests for other tags within the check scripts
           will be run but the tags will not be issued.

           With this options all tags listed will be displayed regardless of the display settings.

       <b>--tags-from-file</b> filename
           Same functionality as <b>--tags</b>, but read the list of tags from a file.  Blank lines and lines beginning
           with # are ignored.  All other lines are taken to be tag names or comma-separated lists of tag  names
           to (potentially) issue.

           With this options all tags listed will be displayed regardless of the display settings.

       <b>-X</b> chk1,chk2,..., <b>--dont-check-part</b> chk1,chk2,...
           Run  all  but  the  specified  checks.   You  can  either specify the name of the check script or the
           abbreviation.  For details, see the "CHECKS" section below.

       General options:

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
           Display usage information and exit.

       <b>-q</b>, <b>--quiet</b>
           Suppress  all   informational   messages   including   override   comments   (normally   shown   with
           <b>--show-overrides</b>).

           This  option  is  silently  ignored if <b>--debug</b> is given.  Otherwise, if both <b>--verbose</b> and <b>--quiet</b> is
           used, the last of these two options take effect.

           This option overrides the <b>verbose</b>  and  the  <b>quiet</b>  variable  in  the  configuration  file.   In  the
           configuration  file, this option is enabled by using <b>quiet</b> variable.  The <b>verbose</b> and <b>quiet</b> variables
           may not both appear in the config file.

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b>
           Display verbose messages.

           If <b>--debug</b> is used this option is always enabled.  Otherwise, if both <b>--verbose</b> and <b>--quiet</b>  is  used
           (and <b>--debug</b> is not used), the last of these two options take effect.

           This  option overrides the <b>quiet</b> variable in the configuration file.  In the configuration file, this
           option is enabled by using <b>verbose</b> variable.  The <b>verbose</b> and <b>quiet</b> variables may not both appear  in
           the config file.

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--version</b>
           Display lintian version number and exit.

       <b>--print-version</b>
           Print unadorned version number and exit.

       Behavior options for <b>lintian</b>.

       <b>--color</b> (auto|never|always|html)
           Whether to colorize tags in lintian output based on their visibility.  The default is "auto" will use
           color  only  if the output is going to a terminal. "never" will never use color, "always" will always
           use color, and "html" will use HTML &lt;span&gt; tags with a color style attribute (instead of  ANSI  color
           escape sequences).

           This option overrides the <b>color</b> variable in the configuration file.

       <b>--hyperlinks</b> (on|off)
           Shows  text-based  hyperlinks to tag descriptions on lintian.debian.org on terminals that support it.
           The default is on for terminals that support it, unless  the  user  selected  '--color  never'.  This
           currently only works in GNOME Terminal.

           This option overrides the <b>color</b> variable in the configuration file.

       <b>--default-display-level</b>
           Reset  the current display level to the default.  Basically, this option behaves exactly like passing
           the following options to lintian:

               <b>-L</b> "&gt;=warning"

           The primary use for this is to ensure that lintian's display level has been  reset  to  the  built-in
           default  values.   Notably, this can be used to override display settings earlier on the command-line
           or in the lintian configuration file.

           Further changes to the display level can be done <u>after</u> this option.  Example: <b>--default-display-level</b>
           <b>--display-info</b> gives you the default display level plus informational ("I:") tags.

       <b>--display-source</b> X
           Only display tags from the source X (e.g. the Policy Manual or the Developer Reference).  This option
           can be used multiple times to add additional sources.  Example sources are "policy" or "devref" being
           the Policy Manual and the Developer Reference (respectively).

           The entire list of sources can be found in <u>$LINTIAN_BASE/data/output/manual-references</u>

       <b>-E</b>, <b>--display-experimental</b>, <b>--no-display-experimental</b>
           Control whether to display experimental ("X:") tags.  They are normally suppressed.

           If a tag is marked experimental, this means that the code that generates this message is not as  well
           tested  as  the  rest  of  Lintian,  and  might  still  give surprising results.  Feel free to ignore
           Experimental messages that do not seem to make sense, though of course bug reports are always welcome
           (particularly if they include fixes).

           These options overrides the <b>display-experimental</b> variable in the configuration file.

       <b>--fail-on</b> {error | warning | info | pedantic | experimental | override | none}
           Causes <b>lintian</b> to exit with a program status of 2 for the given conditions.  This  option  can  be  a
           comma-separated list, or it may be specified multiple times.

           The default is <b>error</b>. Also, 'warning' does not imply 'error'.  Please specify both if you want both.

       <b>-i</b>, <b>--info</b>
           Print explanatory information about each problem discovered in addition to the lintian error tags. To
           print  a  long  tag  description  without  running  lintian, see <b><a href="../man1/lintian-explain-tags.1.html">lintian-explain-tags</a></b>(1) or check the
           website at https://lintian.debian.org.

           To negate it, please use <b>--no-info</b>.

           This option overrides <b>info</b> (or <b>no-info</b>) variable in the configuration file.

       <b>-I</b>, <b>--display-info</b>
           Display informational ("I:") tags as well.  They are normally suppressed.  (This is equivalent to  <b>-L</b>
           "&gt;=info").

           This option overrides the <b>display-info</b> variable in the configuration file.

           Note: <b>display-level</b> and <b>display-info</b> may not both appear in the configuration file.

       <b>-L</b> [+|-|=][&gt;=|&gt;|=|&lt;|&lt;=][S|C|S/C], <b>--display-level</b> [+|-|=][&gt;=|&gt;|=|&lt;|&lt;=][S|C|S/C]
           Fine-grained  selection  of  tags to be displayed. It is possible to add, remove or set the levels to
           display, specifying a visibility (error, warning, info,  pedantic,  or  classification.  The  default
           settings are equivalent to <b>-L</b> "&gt;=warning".

           The value consists of 3 parts, where two of them are optional.  The parts are:

           modifier operator
               How to affect the current display level.  Can be one of add to ("+"), remove from ("-") or set to
               ("=") the display level(s) denoted by the following selection.

               The default value is "=" (i.e. set the display level).

           set operator
               The  visibility  to  be selected.  The operator can be one of "&gt;=", "&gt;", "=", "&lt;" or "&lt;=".  As an
               example, this can be used to select all info (and more serious) tags via "&gt;=info".

               The default value is "=", which means "exactly" the given visibility.

           This option overrides the <b>display-level</b> variable  in  the  configuration  file.   The  value  of  the
           <b>display-level</b>  in  configuration  file should be space separated entries in the same format as passed
           via command-line.

           Note: <b>display-level</b> may not be used with <b>display-info</b> or <b>pedantic</b> in the configuration file.

       <b>-o</b>, <b>--no-override</b>
           Ignore all overrides provided by the package.  This option will overrule <b>--show-overrides</b>.

           This option overrides the <b>override</b> variable in the configuration file.

       <b>--pedantic</b>
           Display pedantic ("P:") tags as well.  They are normally  suppressed.   (This  is  equivalent  to  <b>-L</b>
           "+=pedantic").

           Pedantic  tags  are  Lintian  at its most pickiest and include checks for particular Debian packaging
           styles and checks that many people disagree with.  Expect false positives and Lintian tags  that  you
           don't  consider  useful  if  you use this option.  Adding overrides for pedantic tags is probably not
           worth the effort.

           This option overrides the <b>pedantic</b> variable in the configuration file.

           Note: <b>pedantic</b> and <b>display-level</b> may not both appear in the configuration file.

       <b>--profile</b> vendor[/prof]
           Use the profile from vendor (or the profile with that name).  If the profile name does not contain  a
           slash, the default profile for than vendor is chosen.

           As an example, if you are on Ubuntu and want to use Lintian's Debian checks, you can use:

             --profile debian

           Likewise, on a Debian machine you can use this to request the Ubuntu checks.

           If  the  token  <u>{VENDOR}</u> appears in the profile name, <b>lintian</b> will substitute the token with a vendor
           name to find the profile.  <b>lintian</b> uses Dpkg::Vendor to determine the best vendor to use (the  closer
           to  the  current vendor, the better).  This is mostly useful for people implementing their own checks
           on top of Lintian.

           If not specified, the default value is <u>{VENDOR}/main</u>.

           Please Refer to the Lintian User Manual for the full documentation of profiles.

       <b>--show-overrides</b>
           Controls whether tags that have been overridden should be shown.

           <b>--show-overrides</b> will show overridden tags and mark them as overridden (using an "O" code).

           If the overridden tags are shown, the related  override  comments  will  also  be  displayed  (unless
           --quiet  is  used).   Please  refer  to  the Lintian User Manual for the documentation on how lintian
           relates comments to a given override.

           To negate it, i.e. suppress the showing of overridden tags, please use <b>--no-show-overrides</b>.

           This option overrides the <b>show-overrides</b> (or <b>no-show-overrides</b>) variable in the configuration file.

       <b>--suppress-tags</b> tag1,tag2,...
           Suppress the listed tags.  They will not be reported if they occur  and  will  not  affect  the  exit
           status   of   Lintian.    This   option   can   be  given  multiple  times  and  can  be  mixed  with
           <b>--suppress-tags-from-file</b>.

           This option can be used together with <b>--dont-check-part</b> ("Not  those  checks  nor  these  tags")  and
           <b>--check-part</b>  ("Only  those  checks,  but  not these tags (from those checks)") to further reduce the
           selection of tags.

           When used with <b>--tags</b>, this option is mostly ignored.

       <b>--suppress-tags-from-file</b> file
           Suppress all tags listed in the given file.  Blank lines and lines beginning with # are ignored.  All
           other lines are taken to be tag names or  comma-separated  lists  of  tag  names  to  suppress.   The
           suppressed tags will not be reported if they occur and will not affect the exit status of Lintian.

           Tags  parsed  from  the  file will be handled as if they had been given to the <b>--suppress-tags</b> option
           (e.g. ignored if <b>--tags</b> is used).

       <b>--tag-display-limit</b>[=NUM]
           By default, lintian limits itself to emitting at most 4 instances of each tag  per  processable  when
           STDOUT is a TTY.  This option specifies that limit.

           When STDOUT is not a TTY, lintian has no limit.

           To disable the limit, please use a value of zero.

           This option overrides the <b>tag-display-limit</b> variable in the configuration file.

       Configuration options:

       <b>--cfg</b> configfile
           Read  the configuration from configfile rather than the default locations.  This option overrides the
           <b>LINTIAN_CFG</b> environment variable.

       <b>--no-cfg</b>
           Do not read any configuration file.  This option overrides the <b>--cfg</b> above.

       <b>--ignore-lintian-env</b>
           Ignore all environment variables starting with <u>LINTIAN</u><b>_</b>.

           This option is mostly useful for applications running <b>lintian</b> for checking packages and do  not  want
           the invoking user to affect the result (by setting LINTIAN_PROFILE etc.).

           Note  it  does  <u>not</u>  cause  <b>lintian</b>  to ignore the entire environment like <u>TMPDIR</u> or <u>DEB_VENDOR</u>.  The
           latter can affect the default profile (or "{VENDOR}" token for <b>--profile</b>).

           Should usually be combined with <b>--no-user-dirs</b> (or unsetting $HOME and all <u>XDG</u><b>_</b> variables).

       <b>--include-dir</b> dir
           Use dir as an additional "LINTIAN_BASE".  The directory is expected have  a  similar  layout  to  the
           LINTIAN_BASE (if it exists), but does not need to be a full self-contained root.

           <b>lintian</b>  will  check  this  directory  for  (additional)  profiles, data files, support libraries and
           checks.  The latter two imply that Lintian may attempt to <u>load</u> <u>and</u> <u>execute</u> <u>code</u> from this directory.

           This option may appear more than once; each time adding an  additional  directory.   Directories  are
           searched in the order they appear on the command line.

           The additional directories will be checked <u>after</u> the user directories (though see <b>--no-user-dirs</b>) and
           <u>before</u> the core LINTIAN_BASE.

           <b>Note</b>: This option should be the very first if given.

       <b>-j</b> X, <b>--jobs</b>=X
           Set the limit for how many jobs Lintian will run in parallel. This option overrides the <b>jobs</b> variable
           in the configuration file.

           By default Lintian will use <u>nproc</u> to determine a reasonable default (or 2, if the nproc fails).

       <b>--user-dirs</b>, <b>--no-user-dirs</b>
           By  default,  <b>lintian</b>  will check <u>$HOME</u> and <u><a href="file:/etc">/etc</a></u> for files supplied by the user or the local sysadmin
           (e.g. config  files  and  profiles).   This  default  can  be  disabled  (and  re-enabled)  by  using
           <b>--no-user-dirs</b> (and <b>--user-dirs</b>, respectively).

           These options will <u>not</u> affect the inclusion of LINTIAN_BASE, which is always included.

           These  option  can  appear  multiple  times,  in which case the last of them to appear determines the
           result.

           Note that if the intention is only to disable the user's <u>$HOME</u>, then unsetting <u>$HOME</u>  and  <u>XDG_*_HOME</u>
           may  suffice.   Alternatively,  <u><a href="file:/etc">/etc</a></u> can be "re-added" by using <u>--include-dir</u> (caveat: <u>/etc/lintianrc</u>
           will be ignored by this).

           If the intention is to avoid (unintentional) side-effects from the calling  user,  then  this  option
           could be combined with <b>--ignore-lintian-env</b>.

           If  for  some  reason <b>--no-user-dirs</b> cannot be used, then consider unsetting <u>$HOME</u> and all the <u>$XDG_*</u>
           variables (not just the <u>$XDG_*_HOME</u> ones).

           <b>Note</b>: This option should be the very first if given.

       Developer/Special usage options:

       <b>--allow-root</b>
           Override lintian's warning when it is run with superuser privileges.

       <b>--packages-from-file</b> X
           The line is read as the path to a file to process (all whitespace is included!).

           If X is "-", Lintian will read the packages from STDIN.

       <b>--perf-debug</b>
           Enable performance related debug logging to STDERR.

           The data logged and the format used is subject to change with every release.

           Note that some of the information may also be available (possibly in a  different  format)  with  the
           <b>--debug</b> option.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       Lintian looks for its configuration file in the following locations, in this order:

       •   The argument given to <b>--cfg</b>

       •   <u>$LINTIAN_CFG</u>

       •   <u>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/lintian/lintianrc</u>

       •   <u>XDG_DIR/lintian/lintianrc</u>

           Where XDG_DIR is a directory listed in <u>$XDG_CONFIG_DIRS</u> (or <u><a href="file:/etc/xdg">/etc/xdg</a></u> if <u>$XDG_CONFIG_DIRS</u> is unset).

       •   <u>$HOME/.lintianrc</u>

           Please consider using the XDG based variant above (usually, in <u><a href="file:~/.config">~/.config</a></u>).

       •   <u>/etc/lintianrc</u>

       Lintian uses the following directories:

       <u><a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a></u>
           Lintian  defaults  to  creating a temporary lab directory in <u><a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a></u>.  To change the directory used, set
           the TMPDIR environment variable to a suitable directory.  TMPDIR can  be  set  in  the  configuration
           file.

       <u>/usr/share/lintian/checks</u>
           Scripts that check aspects of a package.

       <u>/usr/share/lintian/collection</u>
           Scripts that collect information about a package and store it for use by the check scripts.

       <u>/usr/share/lintian/data</u>
           Supporting data used by Lintian checks and for output formatting.

       <u>/usr/share/lintian/lib</u>
           Utility scripts used by the other lintian scripts.

       For  binary  packages,  Lintian looks for overrides in a file named <u>usr/share/lintian/overrides/&lt;package&gt;</u>
       inside the binary package, where <u>&lt;package&gt;</u> is the name of  the  binary  package.   For  source  packages,
       Lintian     looks     for     overrides     in     <u>debian/source/lintian-overrides</u>     and     then    in
       <u>debian/source.lintian-overrides</u> if the first file is not found.  The first path is  preferred.   See  the
       Lintian User's Manual for the syntax of overrides.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>FILE</b></h4><pre>
       The configuration file can be used to specify default values for some options.  The general format is:

        option = value

       All  whitespace  adjacent to the "=" sign as well as leading and trailing whitespace is ignored.  However
       whitespace within the value is respected, as demonstrated by this example:

        # Parsed as "opt1" with value "val1"
           opt1    =   val1
        # Parsed as "opt2" with value "val2.1  val2.2     val2.3"
        opt2 = val2.1  val2.2     val2.3

       Unless otherwise specified, no option may appear more than once.  Lintian  will  ignore  empty  lines  or
       lines starting with the <b>#</b>-character.

       Generally  options  will  be  the long form of the command-line option without the leading dashes.  There
       some exceptions (such as --profile), where Lintian uses the same name as the environment variable.

       Lintian only allows a subset of the options specified in the configuration  file;  please  refer  to  the
       individual options in "OPTIONS".

       In  the  configuration  file, all options listed must have a value, even if they do not accept a value on
       command line (e.g. --pedantic).  The values "yes", "y", "1", or "true" will enable  such  an  option  and
       "no", "n", "0" or "false" will disable it.  Prior to the 2.5.2 release, these values were case sensitive.

       For  other  options,  they  generally  take  the same values as they do on the command line.  Though some
       options allow a slightly different format (e.g. --display-level).  These exceptions are explained for the
       relevant options in "OPTIONS".

       Beyond command line options, it is also allowed to specify  the  environment  variable  "TMPDIR"  in  the
       configuration file.

       A sample configuration file could look like:

        # Sample configuration file for lintian
        #
        # Set the default profile (--profile)
        LINTIAN_PROFILE = debian

        # Set the default TMPDIR for lintian to /var/tmp/lintian
        # - useful if <a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a> is tmpfs with "limited" size.
        TMPDIR = /var/tmp/lintian/

        # Show info (I:) tags by default (--display-info)
        #  NB: this cannot be used with display-level
        display-info=yes

        # Ignore all overrides (--no-override)
        #  NB: called "override" in the config file
        #      and has inverted value!
        override = no

        # Automatically determine if color should be used
        color = auto

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>0</b>   Normal operation.

       <b>1</b>   Lintian run-time error. An error message is sent to stderr.

       <b>2</b>   Detected  a condition specified via the <b>--fail-on</b> option. This can be used to trigger a non-zero exit
           value in case of policy violations.

</pre><h4><b>CHECKING</b> <b>LAST</b> <b>BUILD</b></h4><pre>
       When  run  in  an  unpacked  package  dir  (with  no  package  selection  arguments),  Lintian  will  use
       <u>debian/changelog</u> to determine the source and version of the package.  Lintian will then attempt to find a
       matching <u>.changes</u> file for this source and version combination.

       Lintian will (in order) search the following directories:

       ..  Used by <b><a href="../man1/dpkg-buildpackage.1.html">dpkg-buildpackage</a></b>(1).

       ../build-area
           Used by <b><a href="../man1/svn-buildpackage.1.html">svn-buildpackage</a></b>(1).

       /var/cache/pbuilder/result
           Used by <b><a href="../man1/pbuilder.1.html">pbuilder</a></b>(1) and <b><a href="../man1/cowbuilder.1.html">cowbuilder</a></b>(1).

       In  each  directory,  Lintian  will  attempt  to  find  a  <u>.changes</u>  file  using  the following values as
       architecture (in order):

       <u>$DEB_BUILD_ARCH</u> (or <u>dpkg</u> <u>--print-architecture</u>)
           The environment variable DEB_BUILD_ARCH  (if  not  set,  "dpkg  --print-architecture"  will  be  used
           instead)

       <u>$DEB_HOST_ARCH</u>
           The environment variable DEB_HOST_ARCH.

       <u>dpkg</u> <u>--print-foreign-architectures</u>
           If   <b><a href="../man1/dpkg.1.html">dpkg</a></b>(1)   appears   to   support   multi-arch,   then   any   architecture   listed   by   "dpkg
           --print-foreign-architectures" will be used (in the order returned by dpkg).

       <u>multi</u>
           Pseudo architecture used by <b><a href="../man1/mergechanges.1.html">mergechanges</a></b>(1).

       <u>all</u> Used when building architecture indep packages only (e.g.  dpkg-buildpackage -A).

       <u>source</u>
           Used for "source only" builds (e.g. dpkg-buildpackage -S).

       If a <u>.changes</u> file matches any combination above exists, Lintian will process the first match as  if  you
       had passed it per command line.  If no <u>.changes</u> file can be found, Lintian will print a list of attempted
       locations on STDERR and exit 0.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>$</b> <b>lintian</b> <b>foo.changes</b>
           Check the changes file itself and any (binary, udeb or source) package listed in it.

       <b>$</b> <b>lintian</b> <b>foo.deb</b>
           Check binary package foo given by foo.deb.

       <b>$</b> <b>lintian</b> <b>foo.dsc</b>
           Check source package foo given by foo.dsc.

       <b>$</b> <b>lintian</b> <b>foo.dsc</b> <b>-L</b> <b>+info</b>
           Check source package foo given by foo.dsc, including info tags.

       <b>$</b> <b>lintian</b> <b>-i</b> <b>foo.changes</b>
           Check  the  changes file and, if listed, the source and binary package of the upload. The output will
           contain detailed information about the reported tags.

       <b>$</b> <b>lintian</b>
           Assuming <u>debian/changelog</u> exists, look for  a  changes  file  for  the  source  in  the  parent  dir.
           Otherwise, print usage information and exit.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Lintian  does  not  have  any  locking  mechanisms  yet.   (Running several Lintian processes on the same
       laboratory simultaneously is likely to fail or corrupt the laboratory.)

       If you discover any other bugs in lintian, please contact the authors.
