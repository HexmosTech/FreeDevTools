</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       go-build - compile the packages named by the import paths

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>go</b> <b>build</b> [<b>-o</b> <u>output</u>] [<u>build</u> <u>flags</u>] [<u>packages</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Build  compiles  the  packages  named by the import paths, along with their dependencies, but it does not
       install the results.

       If the arguments to build are a list of .go files from a single directory, build treats them as a list of
       source files specifying a single package.

       When compiling packages, build ignores files that end in ‘_test.go’.

       When compiling a single main package, build writes the resulting executable to an output file named after
       the first source file (‘go build ed.go rx.go’ writes ‘ed’ or ‘ed.exe’) or the source code directory  (‘go
       build  unix/sam’  writes  ‘sam’  or  ‘sam.exe’).   The  ‘.exe’  suffix  is  added  when writing a Windows
       executable.

       When compiling multiple packages or a single non-main package, build compiles the packages  but  discards
       the resulting object, serving only as a check that the packages can be built.

       The  -o  flag  forces  build  to  write  the  resulting  executable or object to the named output file or
       directory, instead of the default behavior described in the last two paragraphs. If the named  output  is
       an  existing  directory or ends with a slash or backslash, then any resulting executables will be written
       to that directory.

       The -i flag installs the packages that are dependencies of the target.
       The -i flag is deprecated. Compiled packages are cached automatically.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The build flags are shared by the build, clean, get, install, list, run, and test commands:

       <b>-a</b>     force rebuilding of packages that are already up-to-date.

       <b>-n</b>     print the commands but do not run them.

       <b>-p</b> <u>n</u>   the number of programs, such as build commands or test binaries, that can be run in parallel.
              The default is GOMAXPROCS, normally the number of CPUs available.

       <b>-race</b>  enable data race detection.
              Supported  only  on  linux/amd64,  freebsd/amd64,   darwin/amd64,   darwin/arm64,   windows/amd64,
              linux/ppc64le and linux/arm64 (only for 48-bit VMA).

       <b>-msan</b>  enable  interoperation with memory sanitizer.  Supported only on linux/amd64, linux/arm64 and only
              with Clang/LLVM as the host C compiler.  On linux/arm64, pie build mode will be used.

       <b>-asan</b>  enable interoperation  with  address  sanitizer.   Supported  only  on  linux/arm64,  linux/amd64.
              Supported  only  on  linux/amd64 or linux/arm64 and only with GCC 7 and higher or Clang/LLVM 9 and
              higher.

       <b>-v</b>     print the names of packages as they are compiled.

       <b>-work</b>  print the name of the temporary work directory and do not delete it when exiting.

       <b>-x</b>     print the commands.

       <b>-asmflags</b> <b>'[pattern=]</b><u>arg</u> <u>list</u><b>'</b>
              arguments to pass on each go tool asm invocation.

       <b>-buildmode</b> <u>mode</u>
              build mode to use. See ‘go help buildmode’ for more.

       <b>-buildvcs</b>
              Whether  to  stamp  binaries  with  version  control  information.  By  default,  version  control
              information  is stamped into a binary if the main package and the main module containing it are in
              the repository containing the current directory (if there is a repository). Use -buildvcs=false to
              omit version control information.

       <b>-compiler</b> <u>name</u>
              name of compiler to use, as in runtime.Compiler (gccgo or gc)

       <b>-gccgoflags</b> <b>'</b><u>arg</u> <u>list</u><b>'</b>
              arguments to pass on each gccgo compiler/linker invocation

       <b>-gcflags</b> <b>'</b><u>arg</u> <u>list</u><b>'</b>
              arguments to pass on each go tool compile invocation.

       <b>-installsuffix</b> <u>suffix</u>
              a suffix to use in the name of the  package  installation  directory,  in  order  to  keep  output
              separate from default builds.  If using the -race flag, the install suffix is automatically set to
              race or, if set explicitly, has _race appended to it. Likewise for the -msan and -asan flag. Using
              a -buildmode option that requires non-default compile flags has a similar effect.

       <b>-ldflags</b> <b>'</b><u>flag</u> <u>list</u><b>'</b>
              arguments to pass on each go tool link invocation.

       <b>-linkshared</b>
              build code that will be linked against shared libraries previously created with -buildmode=shared.

       <b>-mod</b> <u>mode</u>
              module  download  mode  to  use:  readonly,  vendor, or mod.  By default, if a vendor directory is
              present and the go version in go.mod is 1.14 or higher, the go command acts as if -mod=vendor were
              set.    Otherwise,   the   go   command   acts   as    if    -mod=readonly    were    set.     See
              https://golang.org/ref/mod#build-commands for details.

       <b>-modcacherw</b>
              leave newly-created directories in the module cache read-write instead of making them read-only.

       <b>-modfile</b> <u>file</u>
              in module aware mode, read (and possibly write) an alternate go.mod file instead of the one in the
              module  root  directory.  A  file  named  "go.mod" must still be present in order to determine the
              module root directory, but it is not accessed. When -modfile is  specified,  an  alternate  go.sum
              file is also used: its path is derived from the -modfile flag by trimming the ".mod" extension and
              appending ".sum".

       <b>-overlay</b> <u>file</u>
              read  a JSON config file that provides an overlay for build operations.  The file is a JSON struct
              with a single field, named ‘Replace’, that maps each disk file path (a string) to its backing file
              path, so that a build will run as if the disk file path exists with  the  contents  given  by  the
              backing  file paths, or as if the disk file path does not exist if its backing file path is empty.
              Support for the -overlay flag has some limitations: importantly, cgo files included  from  outside
              the  include  path  must  be  in  the same directory as the Go package they are included from, and
              overlays will not appear when binaries and tests are run through go run and go test respectively.

       <b>-pkgdir</b> <u>dir</u>
              install and load all packages from dir instead of the usual locations.  For example, when building
              with a non-standard configuration, use -pkgdir to keep generated packages in a separate location.

       <b>-tags</b> tag,list
              a comma-separated list of additional build tags to consider satisfied during the build.  For  more
              information about build tags, see ‘go help buildconstraint’. (Earlier versions of Go used a space-
              separated list, and that form is deprecated but still recognized.)

       <b>-trimpath</b>
              remove  all  file  system  paths  from  the resulting executable.  Instead of absolute file system
              paths, the recorded file names will begin either a module path@version (when using modules), or  a
              plain import path (when using the standard library, or GOPATH).

       <b>-toolexec</b> <b>'</b><u>cmd</u> <u>args</u><b>'</b>
              a  program  to use to invoke toolchain programs like vet and asm.  For example, instead of running
              asm, the go command will run ‘cmd args /path/to/asm &lt;arguments for asm&gt;’.
              The TOOLEXEC_IMPORTPATH environment variable will be set, matching ‘go  list  -f  {{.ImportPath}}’
              for the package being built.

       The  -asmflags,  -gccgoflags,  -gcflags, and -ldflags flags accept a space-separated list of arguments to
       pass to an underlying tool during the build. To embed spaces in an element in the list, surround it  with
       either single or double quotes. The argument list may be preceded by a package pattern and an equal sign,
       which  restricts the use of that argument list to the building of packages matching that pattern (see ‘go
       help packages’ for a description of package patterns). Without a pattern, the argument list applies  only
       to  the packages named on the command line. The flags may be repeated with different patterns in order to
       specify different arguments for different sets of packages.  If  a  package  matches  patterns  given  in
       multiple  flags,  the  latest  match  on  the command line wins.  For example, ‘go build -gcflags=-S fmt’
       prints the disassembly only for package fmt, while ‘go build -gcflags=all=-S fmt’ prints the  disassembly
       for fmt and all its dependencies.

       For more about specifying packages, see <b><a href="../man7/go-packages.7.html">go-packages</a></b>(7).
       For more about where packages and binaries are installed, see <b><a href="../man1/go-gopath.1.html">go-gopath</a></b>(1).
       For more about calling between Go and C/C++, run ‘go help c’.

       Note:  Build adheres to certain conventions such as those described by ‘go help gopath’. Not all projects
       can follow these conventions, however. Installations that have  their  own  conventions  or  that  use  a
       separate  software  build  system may choose to use lower-level invocations such as ‘go tool compile’ and
       ‘go tool link’ to avoid some of the overheads and design decisions of the build tool.
