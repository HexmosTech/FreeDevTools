</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       condom - protection against viruses and prevention of child processes

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>condom</b> [<u>options</u>] [<u>processid</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>condom</u>  provides  protection  against  System  Transmitted  Viruses  (STVs)  that may invade your system.
       Although the spread of such viruses across a network can only be abated  by  aware  and  cautious  users,
       <u>condom</u>  is  the  only  highly  effective  means  of  preventing  viruses  from  entering your system (see
       <u><a href="../man1/celibacy.1.html">celibacy</a></u>(1)).  Any data passed to <u>condom</u> by the protected process will be blocked, as  specified  by  the
       value  of the <b>-s</b> option (see <b>OPTIONS</b> below).  <u>condom</u> is known to defend against the following viruses and
       other malicious afflictions:

              •      AIDS
              •      Herpes Simplex (genital varieties)
              •      Syphilis
              •      Crabs
              •      Genital warts
              •      Gonhorrea
              •      Chlamydia
              •      Michelangelo
              •      Jerusalem

       When used alone or in conjunction  with  <u><a href="../man1/pill.1.html">pill</a></u>(1),  <u><a href="../man1/sponge.1.html">sponge</a></u>(1),  <u><a href="../man1/foam.1.html">foam</a></u>(1),  and/or  <u><a href="../man3/setiud.3.html">setiud</a></u>(3),  <u>condom</u>  also
       prevents the conception of a child process.  If invoked from within a synchronous process, <u>condom</u> has, by
       default,  an  80%  chance of preventing the external processes from becoming parent processes (see the <b>-s</b>
       option below).  When other process contraceptives are used, the chance of preventing a child process from
       being forked becomes much greater.  See <u><a href="../man1/pill.1.html">pill</a></u>(1), <u><a href="../man1/sponge.1.html">sponge</a></u>(1), <u><a href="../man1/foam.1.html">foam</a></u>(1), and <u><a href="../man3/setiud.3.html">setiud</a></u>(3) for more information.

       If no options are given, the current user's login process (as  determined  by  the  environment  variable
       USER)  is  protected  with  a  Trojan  rough-cut  latex  condom  without  a  reservoir tip.  The optional
       ``<u>processid</u>'' argument is an integer specifying the process to protect.

       NOTE: <u>condom</u> may only be used with a hard disk.  <u>condom</u> will terminate abnormally with exit  code  -1  if
       used with a floppy disk (see <b>DIAGNOSTICS</b> below).

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The following options may be given to <u>condom</u>:

       <b>-b</b> <u>brand</u>
              <u>brand</u>s are as follows:

                 trojan (default)
                 ramses
                 sheik
                 goldcoin
                 fourex

       <b>-m</b> <u>material</u>
              The valid <u>material</u>s are:

                 latex (default)
                 saranwrap
                 membrane
                        <b>WARNING!</b>   The membrane option is <u>not</u> endorsed by the System Administrator General as an
                        effective barrier against certain viruses.   It  is  supported  only  for  the  sake  of
                        tradition.

       <b>-f</b> <u>flavor</u>
              The following <u>flavor</u>s are currently supported:

                 plain (default)
                 apple
                 banana
                 cherry
                 cinnamon
                 licorice
                 orange
                 peppermint
                 raspberry
                 spearmint
                 strawberry

       <b>-r</b>     Toggle reservoir tip (default is no reservoir tip)

       <b>-s</b> <u>strength</u>
              <u>strength</u>  is an integer between 20 and 100 specifying the resilience of <u>condom</u> against data passed
              to <u>condom</u> by the  protected  process.   Using  a  larger  value  of  <u>strength</u>  increases  <u>condom</u>'s
              protective  abilities,  but  also reduces interprocess communication.  A smaller value of <u>strength</u>
              increases interprocess communication, but also increases the likelihood of a security breach.   An
              extremely  vigorous  process or one passing an enormous amount of data to <u>condom</u> will increase the
              chance of <u>condom</u>'s failure.  The default <u>strength</u> is 80%.

       <b>-t</b> <u>texture</u>
              Valid <u>texture</u>s are:

                 rough (default)
                 ribbed
                 bumps
                 lubricated
                        (provides smoother interaction between processes)

       WARNING: The use of an external application to <u>condom</u> in order to reduce friction between  processes  has
       been  proven in benchmark tests to decrease <u>condom</u>'s strength factor!  If execution speed is important to
       your process, use the ``<b>-t</b> <b>lubricated</b>'' option.

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>condom</u> terminates with one of the following exit codes:

       -1     An attempt was made to use <u>condom</u> on a floppy disk.

       0      <u>condom</u> exited successfully (no data was passed to the synchronous process).

       1      <u>condom</u> failed and data was allowed through.  The danger of transmission of an STV or  the  forking
              of  a  child  process is inversely proportional to the number of other protections employed and is
              directly proportional to the ages of the processes involved.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>condom</u> is <b>NOT</b> 100% effective at preventing a child process from being forked or at deterring the invasion
       of a virus (although the System Administrator General has deemed that <u>condom</u> is the most effective  means
       of  preventing  the  spread  of  system  transmitted viruses).  See <u><a href="../man1/celibacy.1.html">celibacy</a></u>(1) for information on a 100%
       effective program for preventing these problems.

       Remember, the use of <u><a href="../man1/sex.1.html">sex</a></u>(1) and other related routines  should  only  occur  between  mature,  consenting
       processes.   If  you  must  use <u><a href="../man1/sex.1.html">sex</a></u>(1), please employ <u>condom</u> to protect your process and your synchronous
       process.  If we are all responsible, we can stop the spread of STVs.

</pre><h4><b>AUTHORS</b> <b>and</b> <b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       The original version of <u>condom</u> was released in Roman times and was only marginally effective.   With  the
       advent of modern technology, <u>condom</u> now supports many more options and is much more effective.

       The   current   release   of   <u>condom</u>  was  written  by  Ken  Maupin  at  the  University  of  Washington
       (<a href="mailto:maupin@cs.washington.edu">maupin@cs.washington.edu</a>) and was last updated on 10/7/92.
