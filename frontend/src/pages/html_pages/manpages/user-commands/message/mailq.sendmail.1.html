       mailq - print the mail queue

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>mailq</b> [<b>-Ac</b>] [<b>-q...</b>]  [<b>-v</b>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Mailq</b> prints a summary of the mail messages queued for future delivery.

       The  first  line printed for each message shows the internal identifier used on this host for the message
       with a possible status character, the size of the message in bytes, the date and  time  the  message  was
       accepted into the queue, and the envelope sender of the message.  The second line shows the error message
       that  caused  this  message  to  be retained in the queue; it will not be present if the message is being
       processed for the first time.  The status characters are either <b>*</b> to indicate the job is being processed;
       <b>X</b> to indicate that the load is too high to process the job; and <b>-</b> to indicate that the job is  too  young
       to process.  The following lines show message recipients, one per line.

       <b>Mailq</b> is identical to ``sendmail -bp''.

       The relevant options are as follows:

       <b>-Ac</b>    Show the mail submission queue specified in <u>/etc/mail/submit.cf</u> instead of the MTA queue specified
              in <u>/etc/mail/sendmail.cf</u>.

       <b>-qL</b>    Show the "lost" items in the mail queue instead of the normal queue items.

       <b>-qQ</b>    Show the quarantined items in the mail queue instead of the normal queue items.

       <b>-q</b>[<u>!</u>]I substr
              Limit  processed  jobs to those containing <u>substr</u> as a substring of the queue id or not when <u>!</u>  is
              specified.

       <b>-q</b>[<u>!</u>]Q substr
              Limit processed jobs to quarantined jobs containing <u>substr</u> as a substring of the quarantine reason
              or not when <u>!</u>  is specified.

       <b>-q</b>[<u>!</u>]R substr
              Limit processed jobs to those containing <u>substr</u> as a substring of one of  the  recipients  or  not
              when <u>!</u>  is specified.

       <b>-q</b>[<u>!</u>]S substr
              Limit  processed  jobs  to  those containing <u>substr</u> as a substring of the sender or not when <u>!</u>  is
              specified.

       <b>-v</b>     Print verbose information.  This adds the priority of the message and a single character indicator
              (``+'' or blank) indicating whether a warning message has been sent  on  the  first  line  of  the
              message.   Additionally,  extra  lines  may  be  intermixed  with  the  recipients  indicating the
              ``controlling user'' information; this shows who will own any programs that are executed on behalf
              of this message and the name of the alias this command expanded from, if  any.   Moreover,  status
              messages for each recipient are printed if available.

       Several  sendmail.cf options influence the behavior of the <b>mailq</b> utility: The number of items printed per
       queue group is restricted by <b>MaxQueueRunSize</b> if that value is set.  The status character <b>*</b> is not printed
       for some values of <b>QueueSortOrder,</b> e.g., filename, random, modification, and none, unless a <b>-q</b> option  is
       used to limit the processed jobs.

       The <b>mailq</b> utility exits 0 on success, and &gt;0 if an error occurs.
