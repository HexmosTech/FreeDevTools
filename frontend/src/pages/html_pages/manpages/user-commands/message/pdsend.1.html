       pdsend - send messages to pd on this or a remote machine

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>pdsend</b> <u>port-number</u> [<u>hostname</u>] [udp|tcp]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Pdsend sends messages to <a href="../man1/pd.1.html">pd</a>(1), via a socket connection, from pdsend's standard input.  This input can be
       any  stream  of Pd messages separated by semicolons.  This is probably the easiest way to control pd from
       another application.  The protocol used is easy to implement and is called FUDI.

       The <u>port</u> <u>number</u> should agree with the port number of a "netreceive" object within pd.   The  <u>hostname</u>  is
       "localhost" by default and can be a domain name or an IP address.  The protocol is "tcp" by default; this
       does  a  handshake  to guarantee that all messages arrive complete and in their correct order; if you are
       sending messages locally or point-to-point you can often get away with the faster udp protocol instead.

       You can also use this to talk to a Max "pdnetreceive" object or even just a "pdreceive" in another shell.
       If you're writing another program you're welcome to just grab the sources for pdsend/pdreceive and  adapt
       them to your own ends; they're part of the Pd distribution.
