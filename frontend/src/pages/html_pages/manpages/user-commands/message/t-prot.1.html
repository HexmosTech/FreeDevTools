</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       t-prot - TOFU Protection - Display Filter for RFC 5322 messages

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>t-prot</b> <b>[</b><u>OPTIONS</u><b>]...</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This  program  is  a  filter to improve the readability of internet messages (emails and usenet posts) by
       *hiding* some annoying parts, e.g. mailing list footers, signatures, and TOFU (see definition below),  as
       well  as  squeezing  sequences  of  blank  lines or punctuation.  The program also detects TOFU or a high
       quoting ratio in a message (so you may take appropriate  action,  e.g.  when  submitting  messages  to  a
       mailing list or a news server).
       The  filter  is  written  in Perl and relies on input to be a single message conforming to RFC 822 or its
       successors, RFC 2822 and RFC 5322.  In messages  conforming  to  MIME  (RFCs  2045-2049)  t-prot  handles
       text/plain parts, others are not touched.

       Already  reformatted messages are handled well: the script was initially designed to cope with the output
       of the MUA mutt (which is the reason for not using standard CPAN modules for handling messages).

       T-prot offers example configuration files for mutt and its fork mutt-kz,  Heirloom  mailx  and  metamail.
       Also  coming  with  the t-prot package is the example S-Lang macro t-prot.sl for using t-prot from within
       slrn. There is a proof-of-concept filter for INN2, which you will have to adapt to the needs of the  news
       site you host. For use with sendmail's <a href="../man5/alias.5.html">alias</a>(5) file, please see below (the option <b>-p</b> provides an example
       line).

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       If  you  do  not  specify  any options, t-prot does ... nothing. Every feature you want must be turned on
       explicitly.  Admittedly, we have quite a number of options  for  t-prot.  To  limit  confusion  they  are
       grouped  into  five  sections:  Input/Output  Options,  Advertisement And Mailing List Footers, Filtering
       Options, Detection Options, and Other Options. While the others should  be  quite  clear,  filtering  and
       detection might deserve a word (or two).

       If  you  want to tune the appearance of your mail from within your MUA (or news messages from within your
       NUA), then go for the Filtering Options section.

       If you want to use t-prot to check on mails before they are submitted to mailing lists, fed to your  news
       server,  or  delivered  by your MDA, then have a peek at the Detection Options section. You may accept or
       reject/bounce messages depending on t-prot's result.

</pre><h4><b>INPUT/OUTPUT</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-i</b> FILE
              Defines an input file; default is '-' i.e. STDIN.

       <b>-o</b> FILE
              Defines the output file; default is STDOUT.

       <b>--body</b> Input consists just of the message's body. There are no RFC 5322 header lines.

              <u>NOTE</u>: This does not work with --pgp-short, and multipart messages will  not  be  detected  due  to
              missing headers.

       <b>--lax-security</b>
              Allow  insecure  writing  method. DO NOT USE UNLESS YOU REALLY KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING. (This ugly
              workaround is needed for some early mutt versions and should NEVER be used as a default, otherwise
              it will probably turn into a security issue.)

              You can use this option safely to enable <b>-o</b> /dev/null (or other files which cannot be changed with
              the user's privileges).

       <b>--max-lines</b>=x
              Maximum number of lines a message may count (with headers). If the message is longer than x lines,
              the message will not be processed but printed unmodified. Exit status will  be  EX_DATAERR  except
              when called with -Mmutt or -Mmutt-kz.

</pre><h4><b>ADVERTISEMENT</b> <b>AND</b> <b>MAILING</b> <b>LIST</b> <b>FOOTERS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-a</b>     "commercial signature": Hides "footers" (signatures) from commercial email providers.
              This  option  compares  the  last  lines  of  the  message  body with any footer file found in the
              directory specified with <b>-A</b> DIRECTORY (which is mandatory for this option). The comparison is done
              by perl's <b>index()</b> function (please try <u>perldoc</u> <u>-f</u> <u>index</u> for details).

              <u>NOTE</u>: This option is not needed if <b>--ftr-ad</b> is specified.

       <b>--ftr-ad</b>
              "enable aggressive ad footer matching": With this option enabled, t-prot  makes  footer  detection
              really greedy: We assume that commercial email providers aren't even frightened to append changing
              texts  *under*  their  ads  which are appended to the message body.  Because these texts even have
              changing lengths we simply detect the lines of the footer *anywhere* in the body  of  the  message
              and assume that everything below belongs to the footer. (Man, if life where always that easy! ;)
              With this option even GMX ads should be easy to hide -- you buy this with a slight performance hit
              (which  is the reason this option is disabled by default), and with the possibility that sometimes
              the algorithm is just a little *too* greedy.

              <u>NOTE</u>: This requires a directory with footer files to be given with option <b>-A</b> DIRECTORY<b>.</b>

       <b>-A</b> DIRECTORY
              "ad footer directory": Defines the directory which contains the advertisement  list  footers  (one
              footer per file) which are to be tested when removing them with options <b>-a</b> or <b>--ftr-ad</b>.
              This  option is also needed if you do not want signature lengths to be counted wrong or fullquotes
              get undetected when an ad footer is appended at the bottom of the message (especially  when  using
              <b>-S</b> or <b>-t</b>).

       <b>-l</b>     "list signature": Hides "footers" (signatures) from mailing lists. Footer detection works like the
              <b>-a</b> option.

              <u>NOTE</u>: This requires a directory with footer files to be given with option <b>-L</b> DIRECTORY<b>.</b>  <b>-l</b> is not
              needed if <b>--ftr-ml</b> is specified.

       <b>--ftr-ml</b>
              "enable  aggressive  mailing  list  footer matching": With this option enabled t-prot makes footer
              detection really greedy: Should be helpful with  broken  list  servers,  or  even  if  your  email
              provider munges the bodies of your messages.
              Works similar to --ftr-ad, just that it is intended for mailing list footers.

              <u>NOTE</u>: This requires a directory with footer files to be given with option <b>-L</b> DIRECTORY<b>.</b>

       <b>-L</b> DIRECTORY
              "list footer directory": Defines the directory which contains the mailing list footers (one footer
              per file) which are to be tested when removing them with the options <b>-l</b> or <b>--ftr-ml</b>.
              This  option is also needed if you do not want signature lengths to be counted wrong or fullquotes
              get undetected when a mailing list footer is appended at the bottom  of  the  message  (especially
              when using <b>-S</b> or <b>-t</b>).

</pre><h4><b>FILTER</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--bigq</b>[=n[,x]]
              "shrink  big quotes": Blocks of quotes with more than n lines will be shrunk to x lines.  Defaults
              are 30 for n and 10 for x.

       <b>-c</b>[n]  "compress": Squeezes a sequence of blank lines to just n blank lines. n defaults to 2.

       <b>--diff</b> Tolerate unified diff (see <b><a href="../man1/diff.1.html">diff</a></b>(1) and <b><a href="../man1/patch.1.html">patch</a></b>(1)) appended after the signature (which usually makes
              the signature too long to be valid).

              Also, protect diff standard output from hiding (which would otherwise be easy prey for <b>-t</b>).

       <b>-e</b>     "ellipsis": Squeezes a sequence of four or more dots, exclamation marks, or question marks to only
              three dots or marks, respectively.

       <b>--fixind</b>
              Fix broken quotes to adhere to RFC 3676 by removing spaces between quote characters and  adding  a
              space after them.
              <u>NOTE</u>:  This  may  produce false positives if spaces in between quote characters are intended (thus
              changing the quoting level, see RFC 3676 for details).

       <b>--groupwise</b>
              Hides TOFU as produced by Novell Groupwise.

       <b>-k</b>     "anti Kammquote": Tries (not too aggressively) to fix those broken  zig-zag-shaped  lines  wrapped
              around by some MUAs which are known as "Kammquoting" in German.

              <u>NOTE</u>:  This  option  is  considered  stable by now. However, sometimes Kammquotes should have been
              removed but weren't. Please send a bug report if this happens to you (after carefully reading  the
              BUGS and REPORTING BUGS section of this man page, that is).

              Please also note that enabling this option is quite a performance hit.

       <b>--kdiff</b>=n
              Minimum length difference between two lines for wrapped line detection on Kammquotes. For details,
              please see the source code.
              Anyway,  lower  values make the algorithm more aggressive, higher values make Kammquotes harder to
              detect. Default is 20.

              Requires <b>-k</b>.

       <b>--kmaxl</b>=n
              Maximum line length for wrapped line detection on Kammquotes. For details, please see  the  source
              code.
              Anyway,  higher  values make the algorithm more aggressive, lower values make Kammquotes harder to
              detect. Default is 80.

              Requires <b>-k</b>.

       <b>--kminl</b>=n
              Minimum line length for wrapped line detection on Kammquotes. For details, please see  the  source
              code.
              Anyway,  lower  values make the algorithm more aggressive, higher values make Kammquotes harder to
              detect. Default is 65.

              Requires <b>-k</b>.

       <b>--locale</b>=LOCALE
              Specify which locale to use for correct parsing of your MUA's formatting of the displayed  message
              (usually  it  is  the  locale  your  MUA  uses). Right now this option is only used when <u>-Mmutt</u> or
              <u>-Mmutt-kz</u> is specified, but this may change in future. You need the  Perl  module  <u>Locale::gettext</u>
              for this feature.

              <u>NOTE</u>:  If  you  use  <b>mutt</b>,  <b>mutt-kz</b>  or <b>gnupg</b> with locales, t-prot will only work correctly if you
              specify the corresponding locale string. Alternatively, you  can  use  the  environment  variables
              <u>LC_ALL</u>, <u>LC_MESSAGES</u>, or <u>LANG</u> to specify the locale string.

              <u>NOTE</u>  <u>also</u>:  You  also  have  to  make  sure you are running t-prot with matching <b>gnupg</b> and <b>mutt</b> /
              <b>mutt-kz</b> versions. T-prot detects <b>gnupg</b> and <b>mutt</b> / <b>mutt-kz</b> locales of the recent stable versions of
              those programs, earlier versions might not work well with a recent version of t-prot.

       <b>-M,</b> <b>--mua</b>MUA
              "mail user agent": Turn on special treatment for some mail user agents. (Right  now  only  <b><a href="../man1/mutt.1.html">mutt</a></b>(1)
              and  <b><a href="../man1/mutt-kz.1.html">mutt-kz</a></b>(1)  are  supported,  but  more  might  be  added  in future.)  <u>Caveat</u>: If your MUA is
              supported by this feature you must ensure t-prot makes use of it when called from within your  MUA
              to work as desired.

       <b>-m</b>     "Microsoft  TOFU":  Hides  TOFU  as  given  by  some Microsoft mailers. (You all surely know these
              fullquotes beginning with
              "----- Original Message -----"
              and some header lines...)

       <b>--ms-smart</b>
              Burn CPU cycles trying to be smart with MS style TOFU: If there are PGP signed  parts  inside  the
              TOFU, the text still might conceal other message parts and therefore should not be deleted.

              Please  note  that  this  is  probably  just  a waste of time because most MS Outlook users who do
              produce this kind of TOFU won't care about making their messages the least bit  readable  or  even
              predictable.  So this option will probably just be interesting for mutt message hooks (to activate
              it on demand when you <b>know</b> the sender tries to write legible messages).

              Requires <b>-Mmutt</b> / <b>-Mmutt-kz</b> and <b>-m</b>.

       <b>--pgp-move</b>
              Move PGP and SSL verification output to bottom; requires <b>-Mmutt</b> / <b>-Mmutt-kz</b>.

       <b>--pgp-move-vrf</b>
              Move PGP and SSL verification output to bottom only if verification shows a good signature and the
              signature could be verified as authentic (using a trust path). If there is any  problem  with  the
              signature,  the  PGP  output  should  not  be moved so the user is more likely to notice. Requires
              <b>-Mmutt</b> / <b>-Mmutt-kz</b>.

              <u>NOTE</u>: If gpg is terminated before finished (e.g. hitting Ctrl-C,  or  using  <u><a href="../man1/kill.1.html">kill</a></u>(1)),  we  cannot
              always  detect  if the check was interrupted. Though t-prot tries to be smart, there will be false
              positives.

       <b>--pgp-short</b>
              Hide non-relevant PGP key uids; requires <b>-Mmutt</b> / <b>-Mmutt-kz</b>.

       <b>-r</b>     "rip header off": Hides all mail header lines.

       <b>--reply</b>
              Subject lines with multiple reply  prefixes  (Re:  and  translations  into  other  languages)  get
              squeezed to only one prefix.

       <b>-S</b>[n]  "suppression  of  overlong  signatures":  Signatures  are  to  be  n  lines (not including the one
              containing dash-dash-space) or less. If there are more, it is probably  not  that  spirited  after
              all.  So with this option you trade it for a <b>truely</b> nice line.
              If  no  n  is  given, default is 4. (We do not recommend using a value other than 4. Consider this
              old-fashioned, but we actually do *like* RFC conformance.)

              <u>NOTE</u>: The line containing "-- " ist not counted when testing for an overlong signature, but it  is
              included when displaying how many lines were deleted.

       <b>-s</b>     "signature  deletion":  Hides  signatures,  i.e. all lines after a "signature dashes" line, i.e. a
              line with three characters: dash-dash-space (no more, no less).

       <b>--sani</b> Sanitize headers "To:", "From:" and "Subject:": Quoted-printable gets fixed to  the  corresponding
              chars. German Umlauts are translated to their "ae", "oe", "ue" pendants.
              Useful e.g. for searching by subject within MUAs like Berkeley mailx.

       <b>--sigsmax</b>[=n]
              "maximum number of tolerated signatures": Here you can define how many signatures you accept to be
              treated as such.  (Most significant behaviour is when microsoft style quotes are removed.  Experts
              please see the code for the more subtle implications of this option.)
              Leave empty or specify zero to have an unlimited number of sigs.  Default is 1.

       <b>--spass</b>
              "SpamAssassin   workaround":   SpamAssassin   (available  at  <u><a href="http://spamassassin.org/">http://spamassassin.org/</a></u>)  often  is
              configured that it adds some lines to the message  body  containing  information  about  the  spam
              criteria  which  were  found  matching for the message. This option enables an extra test to avoid
              false positives for Microsoft style TOFU on such messages.

       <b>-t</b>     "TOFU deletion": Hides "traditional style" TOFU, where each line begins  with  the  indent  string
              "&gt;".

       <b>-w</b>     "whitespace  deletion":  Hides trailing whitespace (sequences of space and tab).  CAVEAT: This may
              lead to interesting effects with crossposts between mailing lists  or  with  undetected  signature
              attempts.

</pre><h4><b>DETECTION</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-P</b> MESSAGE
              "user  defined  bounce  message for picky delivery": You may specify your own bounce message to be
              returned when we try to deliver an email and bounce it because there is TOFU inside. See <b>-p</b>.

       <b>-p</b> [ADDRESS]
              "picky delivery": If we really find some TOFU, abort with  exit  code  <u>EX_UNAVAILABLE</u>.   Otherwise
              redirect the message to ADDRESS if given.

              Intended  for use from within mail delivery agents (MDAs) or mail transport agents (MTAs), or even
              from within INN, so the message bounces if TOFU is detected, and does not get on *your* nerves. :)

              As an example for usage with <b>sendmail</b>, put this line into your alias file and invoke <b>newaliases</b>:

              notofu: |"/usr/local/bin/t-prot -mt -p=user@mydomain"

              This will bounce messages for &lt;notofu@domainname&gt; if any TOFU is detected inside the message,  and
              deliver  it  to  &lt;user@mydomain&gt;  otherwise.   <u>Note</u>  that  TOFU is only detected if you specify <b>-t</b>
              respectively <b>-m</b>.

              <b>PLEASE</b> <b>be</b> <b>careful</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>bounce</b> <b>messages</b> <b>to</b> <b>mailing</b> <b>lists!</b>

       <b>--check</b>[=FLAGS]
              Run checks. If successful, print an error message and quit with an appropriate exit  code.  Useful
              e.g. for rejecting messages from within INN2.

              Flags  are  separated  by  commas  (no  whitespaces), and can be the following (right now just one
              flag):

              <u>ratio</u>[=n]
              If the quoting ratio is n or more, the message is rejected. Must be between 0 and 1, or else it is
              entirely disabled. Default is 0.75 (i.e., 75% of the message lines are quotes).

       <b>-d,</b> <b>--debug</b>
              Print envelope info to syslog when bouncing TOFU contaminated email.  Default syslog  facility  is
              mail.debug. Requires <b>-p</b>.

</pre><h4><b>OTHER</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-h,</b> <b>--help</b>
              Displays a short help text with a summary on all options, and exits.

       <b>-v,</b> <b>--version</b>
              Prints the current version number and exits.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       The  environment  variables <u>LC_ALL</u>, <u>LC_MESSAGES</u>, and <u>LANG</u> are read and respected when interpreting output
       by mutt / mutt-kz or gnupg (unless they are overruled by the --locale option).  T-prot's  own  output  is
       English regardless of any locale setting.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       On  program  exit,  t-prot uses exit codes from <u><a href="file:/usr/include/sysexits.h">/usr/include/sysexits.h</a></u> and thus behaves in a manner that
       sendmail and others understand when calling t-prot.

       Currently, the codes used are
                           EX_OK
                           EX_USAGE
                           EX_DATAERR
                           EX_UNAVAILABLE
                           EX_SOFTWARE
                           EX_IOERR

       If, however, perl fails to compile and execute t-prot, perl's normal exit codes will be returned.

</pre><h4><b>TOFU?</b></h4><pre>
       TOFU is an abbreviation which mixes German and English words; it expands to "text oben, full-quote unten"
       which means "text above - full quote below" and describes the style of so many users who let their mailer
       or newsreader quote everything of the previous message and just add some text at the top; obviously  they
       think  that  quoted text must not be changed at all.  This is quite annoying as it needlessly sends a lot
       of data even when it is not required. Some editing of messages is desired.  Please point these people  to
       the page <u><a href="http://www.river.com/users/share/etiquette/edit.html">http://www.river.com/users/share/etiquette/edit.html</a></u> - thank you!

</pre><h4><b>PERFORMANCE</b></h4><pre>
       There are several ways to fine-tune t-prot's performance:

       Some command line options are quite grave a performance hit -- do not use -k and especially --ms-smart if
       you are content without them.

       Checking  for special footers is very costly as well. Put as few footer files as absolutely needed in any
       footer directory.

       All PGP related options are eating up lots of CPU time. Try to avoid them  on  unsigned  and  unencrypted
       messages.

       When  calling  t-prot  from  within  mutt (or mutt-kz), you might use mutt's folder-hook and message-hook
       facilities to turn options on only when needed, e.g. to set up a  different  footer  directory  for  each
       mailing list folder.

</pre><h4><b>TROUBLESHOOTING</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Q</u>:     I  want  to make my mailing list footer files match more different mailing list footers. Can I use
              regular expressions, or how can I accomplish that?

       <u>A</u>:     Nope, regexp's do not work here. The comparison is made by the perl builtin <u>index</u>() function  (see
              <b>perldoc</b>  for  more detailed info), so you must exactly match the beginning of the line. The longer
              the line you specify, the more precise the match; if your line is empty you match unconditionally.

       <u>Q</u>:     I use the options -l and -L to suppress mailing list footers when displaying messages in  <b><a href="../man1/mutt.1.html">mutt</a></b>(1).
              This  does  work  sometimes,  but sometimes it does not: the footer is not detected, and therefore
              full quotes are not deleted and signatures are detected as too long (which they aren't).

       <u>A</u>:     This might occur if the message is badly encoded, so mutt cannot resolve all  encoded  characters,
              e.g. if you have an encoded message on a mailing list, and majordomo appends a mailing list footer
              in a different encoding (or even plain us-ascii). "-- " simply does not match "--=20".
              Another problem are non-us-ascii characters. Just avoid them, and everything should work fine.
              See the preceding Q+A for a solution.

       <u>Q</u>:     I  want  to  write  a message which contains parts that should *not* be deleted even when filtered
              with t-prot. Is this possible?

       <u>A</u>:     Yes, but please do not spread word of it. Make unobstrusive use of the <u>verbatim</u> instruction:

              #v+
              This line is protected from being filtered by t-prot !!!!!!!
              #v-
              Text coming now is not.

</pre><h4><b>IDEAS</b> <b>AND</b> <b>INSPIRATION</b></h4><pre>
       Many good ideas, bug reports and support from (in alphabetical order)  Bjoern  Buerger,  Bjoern  Laessig,
       Christian  Borss,  Gerfried  Fuchs,  Martin  Neitzel, Martin Dietze, Matthias Kilian, Ralf Doeblitz, Sven
       Guckes and many more (see the ChangeLog for active contributors). Many thanks to all of them!

       Many thanks to Gerhard H. Wrodnigg who uses a TOFU protection script in order to keep  the  responses  to
       his  cancel  bot  reasonably short.  The entire inspiration for this hack came from the "TOFU protection"
       line of his script on many usenet postings.

</pre><h4><b>AVAILABILITY</b></h4><pre>
       You can get the latest version from <u><a href="http://www.escape.de/users/tolot/mutt/">http://www.escape.de/users/tolot/mutt/</a></u>.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       There is a problem when mutt gives a PGP verified or even a multipart message to t-prot: The  information
       where  the  PGP  encrypted/signed data or even attachments begin and end is plainly embedded in the text,
       not really cleanly recognizable for t-prot. The problem should be worked around by now, please send a bug
       report if it does not work for you.

</pre><h4><b>REPORTING</b> <b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Please note that t-prot development happens on <b>current</b> <b>stable</b> <b>perl</b> <b>versions</b> <b>only</b>.  If you do  run  t-prot
       on  earlier  (or  unstable)  perl  versions,  you  might  encounter  perl  compiler bugs (or funny t-prot
       behaviour). One solution is to upgrade your perl, another is simply to write a bug report. If you do  not
       run a current perl version, please include this information in your bug report.

       Please do <u>not</u> report a bug if
        *  you  found  it in the TODO file coming with the distribution. We do know those and try to fix them as
       soon as possible.
        * you have an old t-prot version. If you encounter a problem, first see if there is a new t-prot version
       which fixes the issue. If you upgraded to the latest version and it still occurs, a bug  report  is  just
       great.

       If you noticed a bug when processing a message and want to provide the t-prot team with some useful info,
       please:
        * if invoking t-prot by mutt's <u>display_filter</u> facility, just set display_filter to something like

              "tee <a href="file:~/foobar">~/foobar</a> | t-prot &lt;your options&gt;"

       and  include  <a href="file:~/foobar">~/foobar</a>  in  the  bug report -- this way we might reproduce the bug much easier if you are
       using a different environment than we do.
        * provide information on what command line options you use t-prot with, what perl version t-prot runs on
       your system, and what else might be important to enable us reproducing the bug.

       Send your bug report to <u>&lt;<a href="mailto:t-prot-bugs@tolot.escape.de">t-prot-bugs@tolot.escape.de</a>&gt;</u>.  Thank you.

</pre><h4><b>TODO</b></h4><pre>
       Fix bugs (see the <u>BUGS</u> section). Beside that, all main features should be implemented by  now.   See  the
