</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       amsshell - Asynchronous Message Service (AMS) test message sender (UNIX)

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>amsshell</b> <u>unit_name</u> <u>role_name</u> <u>application_name</u> <u>authority_name</u> <u>[{</u> <u>p</u> <u>|</u> <u>s</u> <u>|</u> <u>q</u> <u>|</u> <u>a</u> <u>}]</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>amsshell</b> is a message issuance program designed to test AMS functionality.

       When <b>amsshell</b> is started, it registers as an application module in the unit identified by <u>unit_name</u> of
       the venture identified by <u>application_name</u> and <u>authority_name</u>; the role in which it registers must be
       indicated in <u>role_name</u>.  A configuration server for the local continuum and a registrar for the indicated
       unit of the indicated venture (which may both be instantiated in a single <b>amsd</b> daemon task) must be
       running in order for <b>amsshell</b> to run.

       <b>amsshell</b> runs as two threads: a background thread that receives watches for AMS configuration events
       (including shutdown), together with a foreground thread that acquires operating parameters and message
       content in lines of console input to control the issuance of messages.

       The first character of each line of input from stdin to the <b>amsshell</b> indicates the significance of that
       line:

       <b>=</b>   Sets  the name of the subject on which all messages are to be issued, until superseded by another "="
           line.  The subject name must begin at the second character of this line.   Optionally,  subject  name
           may be followed by a single ' ' (space) character and then the text of the first message to be issued
           on this subject, which is to be issued immediately.

       <b>r</b>   Sets  the number of the role constraining the domain of message issuance.  The role number must begin
           at the second character of this line.

       <b>c</b>   Sets the number of the continuum constraining the domain of message issuance.  The  continuum  number
           must begin at the second character of this line.

       <b>u</b>   Sets  the number of the unit constraining the domain of message issuance.  The unit number must begin
           at the second character of this line.

       <b>m</b>   Sets the number of the module to which subsequent messages are to be issued.  The module number  must
           begin at the second character of this line.

       <b>.</b>   Terminates <b>amsshell</b>.

       When  the first character of a line of input from stdin is none of the above, the entire line is taken to
       be the text of a message that is to be issued immediately, on the previously specified  subject,  to  the
       previously  specified  module  (if  applicable),  and  subject  to  the  previously  specified domain (if
       applicable).

       By default, <b>amsshell</b> runs in "publish" mode: when a message is to be  issued,  it  is  simply  published.
       This  behavior  can  be  overridden  by  providing  a  fifth command-line argument to <b>amsshell</b> - a "mode"
       indicator.  The supported modes are as follows:

       <b>p</b>   This is "publish" mode.  Every message is published.

       <b>s</b>   This is "send" mode.  Every message is sent privately to the application  module  identified  by  the
           specified module, unit, and continuum numbers.

       <b>q</b>   This  is  "query"  mode.  Every message is sent privately to the application module identified by the
           specified module, unit, and continuum numbers, and <b>amsshell</b> then waits for  a  reply  message  before
           continuing.

       <b>a</b>   This  is "announce" mode.  Every message is announced to all modules in the domain established by the
           previously specified role, unit, and continuum numbers.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       -1  <b>amsshell</b> terminated with an error as noted in the ion.log file.

       "0" <b>amsshell</b> terminated normally.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       A MIB initialization file with the applicable default name (see <u><a href="../man5/amsrc.5.html">amsrc</a></u>(5)) must be present.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       No environment variables apply.

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       amsshell can't register.
           <b>amsshell</b> failed to register, for reasons noted in the ion.log file.

       amsshell can't set event manager.
           <b>amsshell</b> failed to start its background thread, for reasons noted in the ion.log file.
