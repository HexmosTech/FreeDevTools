</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       lcm_sink - Dumps the contents of received message to stdout

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>lcm_sink</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>lcm_sink</b>  is  a  utility for testing the Lightweight Communications library (LC).  <b>lcm_source</b> listens for
       messages on all LC channels and dumps the contents of the received messages to stdout.  It  will  attempt
       to print unprintable characters, which may mess with some terminals when receiving binary data.
