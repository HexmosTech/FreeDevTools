</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       amslog - Asynchronous Message Service (AMS) test message receiver

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>amslog</b> <u>unit_name</u> <u>role_name</u> <u>application_name</u> <u>authority_name</u> <u>[{</u> <u>s</u> <u>|</u> <u>i</u> <u>}]</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>amslog</b> is a message reception program designed to test AMS functionality.

       When <b>amslog</b> is started, it registers as an application module in the unit identified by <u>unit_name</u> of the
       venture identified by <u>application_name</u> and <u>authority_name</u>; the role in which it registers must be
       indicated in <u>role_name</u>.  A configuration server for the local continuum and a registrar for the indicated
       unit of the indicated venture (which may both be instantiated in a single <b>amsd</b> daemon task) must be
       running in order for <b>amslog</b> to run.

       <b>amslog</b> runs as two threads: a background thread that receives AMS messages and logs them to standard
       output, together with a foreground thread that acquires operating parameters in lines of console input to
       control the flow of messages to the background thread.

       When the first character of a line of input from stdin to the <b>amslog</b> foreground thread is '.' (period),
       <b>amslog</b> immediately terminates.  Otherwise, the first character of each line of input from stdin must be
       either '+' indicating assertion of interest in a message subject or '-' indicating cessation of interest
       in a subject.  In each case, the name of the subject in question must begin in the second character of
       the input line.  Note that "everything" is a valid subject name.

       By default, <b>amslog</b> runs in "subscribe" mode: when interest in a message subject is asserted, <b>amslog</b>
       subscribes to that subject; when interest in a message subject is rescinded, <b>amslog</b> unsubscribes to that
       subject.  This behavior can be overridden by providing a third command-line argument to <b>amslog</b> - a "mode"
       indicator.  When mode is 'i', <b>amslog</b> runs in "invite" mode.  In "invite" mode, when interest in a message
       subject is asserted, <b>amslog</b> invites messages on that subject; when interest in a message subject is
       rescinded, <b>amslog</b> cancels its invitation for messages on that subject.

       The "domain" of a subscription or invitation can optionally be specified immediately after the subject
       name, on the same line of console input:

           Domain continuum name may be specified, or the place-holder domain continuum name "_" may be
           specified to indicate "all continua".

           If domain continuum name ("_" or otherwise) is specified, then domain unit name may be specified or
           the place-holder domain unit name "_" may be specified to indicate "the root unit" (i.e., the entire
           venture).

           If domain unit name ("_" or otherwise) is specified, then domain role name may be specified.

       When <b>amslog</b> runs in VxWorks or RTEMS, the subject and content of each message are simply written to
       standard output in a text line for display on the console.  When <b>amslog</b> runs in a UNIX environment, the
       subject name length (a binary integer), subject name (ASCII text), content length (a binary integer), and
       content (ASCII text) are written to standard output for redirection either to a file or to a pipe to
       <b>amslogprt</b>.

       Whenever a received message is flagged as a Query, <b>amslog</b> returns a reply message whose content is the
       string "Got " followed by the first 128 bytes of the content of the Query message, enclosed in single
       quote marks and followed by a period.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       -1  <b>amslog</b> terminated with an error as noted in the ion.log file.

       "0" <b>amslog</b> terminated normally.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       A MIB initialization file with the applicable default name (see <u><a href="../man5/amsrc.5.html">amsrc</a></u>(5)) must be present.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       No environment variables apply.

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       amslog can't register.
           <b>amslog</b> failed to register, for reasons noted in the ion.log file.

       amslog can't set event manager.
           <b>amslog</b> failed to start its background thread, for reasons noted in the ion.log file.

       amslog can't read from stdin
           <b>amslog</b> foreground thread failed to read console input, for reasons noted in the ion.log file.
