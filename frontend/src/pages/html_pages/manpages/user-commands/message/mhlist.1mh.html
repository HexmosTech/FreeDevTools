       mhlist - list information about nmh MIME messages

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>

       <b>mhlist</b> [<b>-help</b>] [<b>-version</b>] [<u>+folder</u>] [<u>msgs</u>] [<b>-file</b> <u>file</u>] [<b>-part</b> <u>number</u>] ...  [<b>-type</b> <u>content</u>] ...  [<b>-prefer</b>
            <u>content</u>] ...  [<b>-noprefer</b>] [<b>-headers</b> | <b>-noheaders</b>] [<b>-realsize</b> | <b>-norealsize</b>] [<b>-changecur</b> |
            <b>-nochangecur</b>] [<b>-verbose</b> | <b>-noverbose</b>] [<b>-disposition</b> | <b>-nodisposition</b>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>mhlist</b>  command  allows you to list information (a table of contents, essentially) about the various
       parts of a collection of MIME (multi-media) messages.

       <b>mhlist</b> manipulates MIME messages as specified in RFC 2045 to RFC 2049 (See <u><a href="../man1/mhbuild.1.html">mhbuild</a></u>(1)).

       The <b>-headers</b> switch indicates that a one-line banner should be displayed above the listing (the default).

       The <b>-realsize</b> switch tells <b>mhlist</b> to evaluate the “native” (decoded) format  of  each  content  prior  to
       listing.  This provides an accurate count at the expense of a small delay.  In either case, sizes will be
       expressed using SI prefix abbreviations (K/M/G/T), which are based on factors of 1000.

       If  the <b>-verbose</b> switch is present, then the listing will show any “extra” information that is present in
       the message, such as comments in the “Content-Type” header.

       If the <b>-disposition</b> switch is present, then the listing will  show  any  relevant  information  from  the
       “Content-Disposition” header.

       The  option  <b>-file</b>  <u>file</u>  directs  <b>mhlist</b>  to use the specified file as the source message, rather than a
       message from a folder.  If you specify this file as “-”, then <b>mhlist</b> will accept the  source  message  on
       the  standard  input.   Note  that  the  file, or input from standard input should be a validly formatted
       message, just like any other <b>nmh</b> message.  It should <u>not</u> be in mail drop format (to  convert  a  file  in
       mail drop format to a folder of <b>nmh</b> messages, see <u><a href="../man1/inc.1.html">inc</a></u>(1)).

       By  default,  <b>mhlist</b>  will  list  information  about the entire message (all of its parts).  By using the
       <b>-part</b>, <b>-type</b>, and <b>-prefer</b> switches, you may limit and reorder the set of parts to  be  listed,  based  on
       part number and/or content type.

       A  part  specification  consists  of  a series of numbers separated by dots.  For example, in a multipart
       content containing three parts, these would be named as 1, 2, and 3, respectively.  If part 2 was also  a
       multipart content containing two parts, these would be named as 2.1 and 2.2, respectively.  Note that the
       <b>-part</b>  switch is effective only for messages containing a multipart content.  If a message has some other
       kind of content, or if the part is itself another multipart content, the <b>-part</b> switch  will  not  prevent
       the content from being acted upon.

       The  <b>-type</b>  switch  can  also  be  used  to restrict (or, when used in conjunction with <b>-part</b>, to further
       restrict) the selection of parts according to content type.  One or more <b>-type</b> switches  part  will  only
       select  the first match from a multipart/alternative, even if there is more than one subpart that matches
       (one of) the given content type(s).

       Using either <b>-part</b> or <b>-type</b> switches alone will cause either to select the  part(s)  they  match.   Using
       them  together  will  select  only  the  part(s) matched by both (sets of) switches.  In other words, the
       result is the intersection, and not the union, of their separate match results.

       A content specification consists of a content type and a subtype.  The initial list of “standard” content
       types and subtypes can be found in RFC 2046.

       A list of commonly used contents is briefly reproduced here:

            Type         Subtypes
            ----         --------
            text         plain, enriched
            multipart    mixed, alternative, digest, parallel
            message      rfc822, external-body
            application  octet-stream, postscript
            image        jpeg, gif, png
            audio        basic
            video        mpeg

       A legal MIME message must contain a subtype specification.

       To specify a content, regardless of its subtype, just use the name of the  content,  e.g.,  “audio”.   To
       specify  a specific subtype, separate the two with a slash, e.g., “audio/basic”.  Note that regardless of
       the values given to the <b>-type</b> switch, a multipart content (of any subtype listed above) is  always  acted
       upon.   Further  note that if the <b>-type</b> switch is used, and it is desirable to act on a message/external-
       body content, then the <b>-type</b> switch must be used twice: once for message/external-body and once  for  the
       content externally referenced.

       By  default, the parts of a multipart/alternative part are listed in the reverse order of their placement
       in the message.  The listing, therefore, is in decreasing order of preference, as defined  in  RFC  2046.
       The <b>-prefer</b> switch can be used (one or more times, in order of ascending preference) to let MH know which
       content  types from a multipart/alternative MIME part are preferred by the user, in order to override the
       default preference order.  Thus, when viewed by <b>mhlist</b>, the ordering of multipart/alternative parts  will
       appear to change when invoked with or without various <b>-prefer</b> switches.  The <b>-noprefer</b> switch will cancel
       any  previous  <b>-prefer</b>  switches.  The <b>-prefer</b> and <b>-noprefer</b> switches are functionally most important for
       <b>mhshow</b>, but are also implemented in <b>mhlist</b> and <b>mhstore</b> to make common part numbering possible across  all
       three programs.
