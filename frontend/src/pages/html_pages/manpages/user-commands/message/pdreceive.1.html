</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       pdreceive - receive messages from pd on this or a remote machine

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>pdreceive</b> <u>port-number</u> [udp|tcp]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Pdreceive  opens  a  socket (with the specified port number) and waits for messages to arrive from one or
       more instances of <a href="../man1/pd.1.html">pd</a>(1).  Each message received is  printed  to  the  standard  output  with  a  trailing
       semicolon.  The protocol used is easy to implement and is called FUDI.

       The <u>port</u> <u>number</u> should agree with the port number of a "netsend" object within pd.  The protocol is "tcp"
       by  default;  this  does  a handshake to guarantee that all messages arrive complete and in their correct
       order; if you are sending messages locally or point-to-point you can often get away with the  faster  udp
       protocol instead.

       You  can  also  use this to get messages from a Max "pdnetsend" object or even just a "pdsend" in another
       shell.  If you're writing another program you're welcome to just grab the  sources  for  pdsend/pdreceive
       and adapt them to your own ends; they're part of the Pd distribution.
