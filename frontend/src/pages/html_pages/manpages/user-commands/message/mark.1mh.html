       mark - manipulate nmh message sequences

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>

       <b>mark</b> [<b>-help</b>] [<b>-version</b>] [<u>+folder</u>] [<u>msgs</u>] [<b>-sequence</b> <u>name</u> <u>...</u>]  [<b>-add</b> | <b>-delete</b> | <b>-list</b>] [<b>-public</b> |
            <b>-nopublic</b>] [<b>-zero</b> | <b>-nozero</b>] [<b>-empty</b> | <b>-noempty</b>] [<b>-range</b> | <b>-norange</b>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>mark</b> command manipulates message sequences by adding or deleting message numbers from folder-specific
       message sequences, or by listing those sequences and messages.

       A  message  sequence  is  a  keyword,  just  like one of the “reserved” message names, such as “first” or
       “next”.  Unlike the “reserved” message names, which have a fixed semantics on  a  per-folder  basis,  the
       semantics of a message sequence may be defined, modified, and removed by the user.  Message sequences are
       folder-specific,  e.g.,  the  sequence  name  “seen”  in the context of folder “<u>+inbox</u>” need not have any
       relation whatsoever to the sequence of the same name in a folder of a different name.

       Three action switches direct the operation of <b>mark</b>.  These switches  are  mutually  exclusive:  the  last
       occurrence of any of them overrides any previous occurrence of the other two.

       The  <b>-add</b>  switch tells <b>mark</b> to add messages to sequences or to create a new sequence.  For each sequence
       named via the <b>-sequence</b> <u>name</u> argument (which must occur at least once) the messages named via <u>msgs</u> (which
       defaults to “cur” if no <u>msgs</u> are given), are added to the sequence.  The messages to be added need not be
       absent from the sequence.  If the <b>-zero</b> switch is specified, the sequence will be emptied prior to adding
       the messages.  Hence, <b>-add</b> <b>-zero</b> means  that  each  sequence  should  be  initialized  to  the  indicated
       messages,  while  <b>-add</b>  <b>-nozero</b> means that each sequence should be appended to by the indicated messages.
       The <b>-empty</b> switch does not affect the operation of <b>-add</b>.

       The <b>-delete</b> switch tells <b>mark</b> to delete messages from sequences, and is the dual of <b>-add</b>.   For  each  of
       the  named  sequences,  the  named  messages  are  removed from the sequence.  These messages need not be
       already present in the sequence.  If the <b>-zero</b> switch is specified, then all messages in the  folder  are
       added  to  the sequence (first creating the sequence, if necessary) before removing the messages.  Hence,
       <b>-delete</b> <b>-zero</b> means that each sequence should contain all messages except those indicated, while  <b>-delete</b>
       <b>-nozero</b>  means  that  only the indicated messages should be removed from each sequence.  As expected, the
       command “<b>mark</b> <b>-sequence</b> <u>foo</u> <b>-delete</b> all” empties the sequence “foo”, and therefore removes that  sequence
       from  the  current  folder's  list  of  sequences.  Sequence <u>foo</u> must exist or a “no such sequence” error
       results.  This can be avoided by adding <b>-zero</b>: “mark -sequence <u>foo</u> -delete -zero  all”  ensures  sequence
       <u>foo</u> no longer exists.  The <b>-empty</b> switch does not affect the operation of <b>-delete</b>.

       When  creating or modifying sequences, you can specify the switches <b>-public</b> or <b>-nopublic</b> to force the new
       or modified sequences to be “public” or “private”.  The  switch  <b>-public</b>  indicates  that  the  sequences
       should  be made “public”.  These sequences will then be readable by all <b>nmh</b> users with permission to read
       the relevant folders.  In contrast, the <b>-nopublic</b> switch indicates that  the  sequences  should  be  made
       “private”,  and will only be accessible by you.  If neither of these switches is specified, then existing
       sequences will maintain their current status, and new sequences will default  to  “public”  if  you  have
       write  permission  for  the  relevant folder.  Check <u><a href="../man5/mh-sequence.5.html">mh-sequence</a></u>(5) for more details about the difference
       between “public” and “private” sequences.

       The <b>-list</b> switch tells <b>mark</b> to list all sequences, and the messages associated with them.  The output can
       be limited to just certain sequences (with <b>-sequence</b> switches) and/or  messages  (with  <u>msgs</u>  arguments).
       Normally,  <b>-list</b>  will  show  all  sequences  associated  with  the  folder,  or all sequences given with
       <b>-sequence</b>.  Using <b>-noempty</b> will suppress any which would show as empty, whether because they actually are
       empty, or because they don't include any of the given  <u>msgs</u>,  or  because  they've  been  specified  with
       <b>-sequence</b>  but don't exist.  (<b>-empty</b> is the default.)  With the default <b>-range</b> switch, <b>mark</b> will compress
       consecutive runs of message numbers to save space.  That is, "3 4 5 6" will be shown as the range  "3-6".
       With <b>-norange</b>, lists will be fully enumerated.  The <b>-zero</b> switch does not affect the operation of <b>-list</b>.

       The restrictions on sequences are:

       • The  name used to denote a message sequence must consist of an alphabetic character followed by zero or
         more alphanumeric characters, and cannot be one of the (reserved) message names “new”, “first”, “last”,
         “all”, “next”, or “prev”.

       • Message ranges with user-defined sequence names are restricted to  the  form  “name:n”,  “name:+n”,  or
         “name:-n”,  and  refer to the first or last `n' messages of the sequence `name'.  If `=' is substituted
         for `:', these forms will instead refer to single messages positioned `n' away  from  one  end  or  the
         other of the sequence.  Constructs of the form “name1-name2” are forbidden for user defined sequences.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       $HOME/.mh_profile   The user's profile.

</pre><h4><b>PROFILE</b> <b>COMPONENTS</b></h4><pre>
       Path:               To determine the user's nmh directory.
       Current-Folder:     To find the default current folder.

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>

</pre><h4><b>DEFAULTS</b></h4><pre>
       +folder             The current folder.
       -add                If <b>-sequence</b> is specified, <b>-list</b> otherwise.
       msgs                The current message, or <b>all</b> if <b>-list</b> is specified.
       -nozero

</pre><h4><b>CONTEXT</b></h4><pre>
       If a folder is given, it will become the current folder.

</pre><h4><b>HELPFUL</b> <b>HINTS</b></h4><pre>
       Use <b>flist</b> to find folders with a given sequence, and “<b>pick</b> <u>sequence</u> <b>-list</b>” to enumerate those messages in
       the sequence (such as for use by a shell script).
