       sortm - sort nmh messages

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>

       <b>sortm</b> [<b>-help</b>] [<b>-version</b>] [<u>+folder</u>] [<u>msgs</u>] [<b>-all</b> | <b>-noall</b>] [<b>-datefield</b> <u>field</u>] [<b>-textfield</b> <u>field</u>]
            [<b>-notextfield</b>] [<b>-limit</b> <u>days</u>] [<b>-nolimit</b>] [<b>-check</b> | <b>-nocheck</b>] [<b>-verbose</b> | <b>-noverbose</b>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>sortm</b>  sorts  the  specified  messages  in  the  named folder according to the chronological order of the
       “Date:” field of each message.

       If no messages are specified, the default is all messages in the folder.  However,  if  no  messages  are
       specified  and  the <b>-noall</b> switch is enabled, then <b>sortm</b> reports that as an error and exits with non-zero
       status.  <b>-noall</b> is most useful in the user's profile, to avoid inadvertent sorting of an  entire  folder.
       The  <b>-all</b>  switch can then be used on the command line to disable it.  Of course, a message specification
       of <u>all</u> can be used in any case.

       The <b>-verbose</b> switch directs <b>sortm</b> to tell the user the general actions that it is  taking  to  place  the
       folder in sorted order.

       The <b>-datefield</b> <u>field</u> switch tells <b>sortm</b> the name of the field to use when making the date comparison.  If
       the  user  has  a  special  field  in  each  message,  such as “BB-Posted:” or “Delivery-Date:”, then the
       <b>-datefield</b> switch can be used to direct <b>sortm</b> which field to examine.

       The <b>-textfield</b> <u>field</u> switch causes <b>sortm</b> to sort messages by the specified text  field.   All  characters
       except  letters and numbers are stripped and the resulting strings are sorted datefield-major, textfield-
       minor, using a case insensitive comparison.  If this field is “subject”, any leading  "re:"  is  stripped
       off.

       With  <b>-textfield</b>  <u>field</u>,  if  <b>-limit</b>  <u>days</u> is specified, messages with the same textfields that are dated
       within `days' of each other appear together.  Specifying <b>-nolimit</b> makes the limit infinity.  With  <b>-limit</b>
       <u>0</u>, the sort is instead simply textfield-major.

       For  example,  to  order a folder by date-major, grouping messages with the same subject on the same date
       together, use:

            sortm -textfield subject +folder

       <b>sortm</b> always issues a warning for each message that is missing a “Date:” field, has a “Date:” field  that
       cannot  be parsed, or has a format error in any header field.  With the <b>-check</b> switch, <b>sortm</b> inhibits all
       modifications to the folder if there are any such messages, and exits with  non-zero  status.   With  the
       default  of  <b>-nocheck</b>,  <b>sortm</b>  sorts  messages  with  a missing or invalid “Date:” field using their file
       modification times.

       When ordering messages based on their dates, if they have the same dates, their original message order is
       preserved.

       $HOME/.mh_profile          The user profile

</pre><h4><b>PROFILE</b> <b>COMPONENTS</b></h4><pre>
       Path:                To determine the user's nmh directory
       Current-Folder:      To find the default current folder

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       <u><a href="../man1/folder.1.html">folder</a></u>(1)

</pre><h4><b>DEFAULTS</b></h4><pre>
       `<b>+folder</b>' defaults to the current folder
       `<b>msgs</b>' defaults to all without -noall, has no default with -noall
       `<b>-all</b>'
       `<b>-datefield</b>' defaults to date
       `<b>-notextfield</b>'
       `<b>-noverbose</b>'
       `<b>-nolimit</b>'
       `<b>-nocheck</b>'

</pre><h4><b>CONTEXT</b></h4><pre>
       If a folder is given, it will become the current folder.  If the current message  is  moved,  <b>sortm</b>  will
       preserve its status as current.

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       Timezones used to be ignored when comparing dates: they aren't any more.

       Messages  which  were  in  the  folder,  but  not specified by `msgs', used to be moved to the end of the
       folder; now such messages are left untouched.

       <b>sortm</b> sometimes did not preserve the message numbering in a folder (e.g., messages 1,  3,  and  5,  might
       have  been  renumbered  to  1, 2, 3 after sorting).  This was a bug, and has been fixed.  To compress the
       message numbering in a folder, use “<b>folder</b> <b>-pack</b>” as always.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       When <b>sortm</b> complains about a message which it can't temporally order,  it  complains  about  the  message
       number <u>prior</u> to sorting.  It should indicate what the message number will be <b>after</b> sorting.
