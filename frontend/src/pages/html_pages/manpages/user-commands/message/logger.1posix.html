</pre><h4><b>PROLOG</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       logger — log messages

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       logger <u>string</u>...

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>logger</u>  utility saves a message, in an unspecified manner and format, containing the <u>string</u> operands
       provided by the user. The messages are expected to be evaluated  later  by  personnel  performing  system
       administration tasks.

       It  is  implementation-defined  whether  messages  written  in  locales  other  than the POSIX locale are
       effective.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>OPERANDS</b></h4><pre>
       The following operand shall be supported:

       <u>string</u>    One of the string arguments whose contents are concatenated together, in the  order  specified,
                 separated by single &lt;space&gt; characters.

</pre><h4><b>STDIN</b></h4><pre>
       Not used.

</pre><h4><b>INPUT</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of <u>logger</u>:

       <u>LANG</u>      Provide a default value for the internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See the
                 Base  Definitions  volume  of POSIX.1‐2017, <u>Section</u> <u>8.2</u>, <u>Internationalization</u> <u>Variables</u> for the
                 precedence  of  internationalization  variables  used  to  determine  the  values   of   locale
                 categories.)

       <u>LC_ALL</u>    If  set  to a non-empty string value, override the values of all the other internationalization
                 variables.

       <u>LC_CTYPE</u>  Determine the locale for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of text  data  as  characters
                 (for example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments).

       <u>LC_MESSAGES</u>
                 Determine  the  locale  that  should  be  used  to affect the format and contents of diagnostic
                 messages written to standard error.  (This  means  diagnostics  from  <u>logger</u>  to  the  user  or
                 application, not diagnostic messages that the user is sending to the system administrator.)

       <u>NLSPATH</u>   Determine the location of message catalogs for the processing of <u>LC_MESSAGES</u>.

</pre><h4><b>ASYNCHRONOUS</b> <b>EVENTS</b></h4><pre>
       Default.

</pre><h4><b>STDOUT</b></h4><pre>
       Not used.

</pre><h4><b>STDERR</b></h4><pre>
       The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.

</pre><h4><b>OUTPUT</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       Unspecified.

</pre><h4><b>EXTENDED</b> <b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       The following exit values shall be returned:

        0    Successful completion.

       &gt;0    An error occurred.

</pre><h4><b>CONSEQUENCES</b> <b>OF</b> <b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       Default.

       <u>The</u> <u>following</u> <u>sections</u> <u>are</u> <u>informative.</u>

</pre><h4><b>APPLICATION</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       This  utility  allows  logging  of  information  for later use by a system administrator or programmer in
       determining why non-interactive utilities have failed. The locations of the saved messages, their format,
       and retention period are all unspecified. There is  no  method  for  a  conforming  application  to  read
       messages, once written.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       A  batch  application,  running  non-interactively,  tries to read a configuration file and fails; it may
       attempt to notify the system administrator with:

           logger myname: unable to read file foo. [timestamp]

</pre><h4><b>RATIONALE</b></h4><pre>
       The standard developers believed strongly that some method  of  alerting  administrators  to  errors  was
       necessary.  The obvious example is a batch utility, running non-interactively, that is unable to read its
       configuration files or that is unable to  create  or  write  its  results  file.  However,  the  standard
       developers  did  not wish to define the format or delivery mechanisms as they have historically been (and
       will probably continue to be) very system-specific, as well as involving  functionality  clearly  outside
       the scope of this volume of POSIX.1‐2017.

       The  text  with  <u>LC_MESSAGES</u>  about  diagnostic  messages  means  diagnostics  from <u>logger</u> to the user or
       application, not diagnostic messages that the user is sending to the system administrator.

       Multiple <u>string</u> arguments are allowed, similar to <u>echo</u>, for ease-of-use.

       Like the utilities <u>mailx</u> and <u>lp</u>, <u>logger</u> is admittedly difficult to test. This was not  deemed  sufficient
       justification  to exclude these utilities from this volume of POSIX.1‐2017. It is also arguable that they
       are, in fact, testable, but that the tests themselves are not portable.

</pre><h4><b>FUTURE</b> <b>DIRECTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
