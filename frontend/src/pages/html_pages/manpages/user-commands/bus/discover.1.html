</pre><h4><b>Description</b></h4><pre>
       <b>discover</b> provides an extensible hardware detection  and  reporting  interface.  Hardware  information  is
       stored in an XML data format and can be retrieved across the network.

       Fundamental modes of operation:

          •  Display  a  list  of  hardware  devices  based on type of device or system bus on which the devices
             reside, via <b>--type-summary</b> or <b>--bus-summary</b> (the latter of which is the default behavior).

          •  Query specified data for attached hardware, via <b>--data-path</b>.

</pre><h4><b>Options</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-h</b> <b>|</b> <b>--help</b>
                 Display a simple help message.

       <b>-v</b> <b>|</b> <b>--verbose</b>
                 Instruct the tool to provide feedback as it operates. This will affect the output  as  <b>discover</b>
                 parses certain arguments, so this should appear early in the command line.

       <b>-V</b> <b>|</b> <b>--version</b>
                 Display the tool name and version.

       <b>-b</b> <b>|</b> <b>--bus-summary</b>
                 This  is  the  default  behavior:  Display  basic  information  regarding  all  devices  on the
                 appropriate buses. See <u>"Selecting</u> <u>Buses"</u> &gt;.

       <b>-t</b> <b>|</b> <b>--type-summary</b>
                 Summarize devices by class of hardware. Examples  of  valid  device  types  include  <b>broadband</b>,
                 <b>fixeddisk</b>, <b>display</b>, and <b>network</b>.  See <u>"Device</u> <u>Types"</u> &gt;.

       <b>--data-path=</b><u>path/to/data</u>
                 Query  matching  devices  for  detailed  information.   Device-specific  data  is  stored  in a
                 hierarchical fashion, and the query argument  comprises  strings  naming  each  level  in  that
                 hierarchy.

                 Typically, the top-level component of the data path will be the ``<u>platform</u>'' that will need the
                 information,  such  as  <b>linux</b> or <b>xfree86</b>. For example, to retrieve the Linux kernel module name
                 for a piece of hardware, the <b>--data-path</b> argument would be <b>linux/module/name</b>.

                 If multiple <b>--data-path</b>           arguments are given and no format string  (see  <b>--format</b>)  is
                 provided, only the last path is used.

                 See also the <b>--data-version</b>           argument.

       <b>--data-version=</b><u>version</u>
                 Specify  a  version  string  for  the  platform  that will use the information specified by the
                 argument to <b>--data-path</b>.

                 This string must be in dotted-decimal notation in order  to  be  matched  against  a  range  of
                 values, and thus may be shorter than the real version.

       <b>--format=</b><u>format</u> <u>string</u>
                 Dictate  the  output  of  the  results of the queries specified by <b>--data-path</b> arguments.  This
                 format string should follow <b><a href="../man3/printf.3.html">printf</a>(3)</b> specifications, although only <b>%s</b> and  appropriate  flags,
                 precision,  and  width  values are supported (or make sense); literal text and <b>%%</b>           can
                 also be used.  The behavior when the  string  is  poorly  formatted  is  undefined.   See  also
                 <b>--normalize-whitespace</b>.

       <b>-d</b> <b>|</b> <b>--disable-bus=</b><u>bus</u>
                 Use  this  option to override the list of buses to scan by default as defined in <b>discover.conf</b>.
                 Use <u>all</u> as an argument to disable all buses; this is useful only if  followed  by  <b>--enable-bus</b>
                 (or <b>-e</b>) arguments.

       <b>-e</b> <b>|</b> <b>--enable-bus=</b><u>bus</u>
                 Specify a bus to be scanned.

       <b>--insert-url=</b><u>url</u>
                 Insert a URL at the head of the list of network resources to include in the search for hardware
                 information.   Earlier  data  overrides  later data; to override the local data sources, insert
                 URLs into the list.  See also <b>--append-url</b>.

       <b>--append-url=</b><u>url</u>
                 Append a URL to the end of the list of network resources to search  for  hardware  information.
                 See also <b>--insert-url</b>.

       <b>--model</b>   Include the model description in summary information. This is enabled by default.

       <b>--model-id</b>
                 Include the numeric model identifier in summary information.

       <b>--no-model</b>
                 Do not include the model description in summary information.

       <b>--no-model-id</b>
                 Do not include the numeric model identifier in summary information. This is the default.

       <b>--vendor</b>  Include the vendor description in summary information. This is enabled by default.

       <b>--vendor-id</b>
                 Include the numeric vendor identifier in summary information.

       <b>--no-vendor</b>
                 Do not include the vendor description in summary information.

       <b>--no-vendor-id</b>
                 Do not include the numeric vendor identifier in summary information. This is the default.

       <b>--normalize-whitespace</b>
                 Consolidate  whitespace  in  the  results of a <b>--data-path</b> query.  The default is not to do so,
                 which faithfully reproduces all text in the raw XML data.

                 With this option enabled, leading and trailing  whitespace  is  removed,  and  any  consecutive
                 internal whitespaces are compressed to a single space character.

</pre><h4><b>Selecting</b> <b>Buses</b></h4><pre>
       <b>discover.conf</b>  defines  two  lists  of  system  buses:  one  to  scan  by  default  (used by the <b>discover</b>
       command), and one never to scan (used by the <b>Discover</b> library).

       You can override and/or extend the list of default buses with <b>--disable-bus</b> and <b>--enable-bus</b>.   The  list
       of  buses  <u>not</u>  to  scan cannot be overridden without changing <b>discover.conf</b>, so that list should be used
       only for buses that may be dangerous to probe.

       Both arguments take the string ``<u>all</u>'' as a value.

       If a bus summary is being performed, which is indicated either by the presence of  <b>--bus-summary</b>  or  the
       absence  of  <b>--type-summary</b>  and  <b>--data-path</b>,  any  unattached  arguments  on  the  command line will be
       interpreted as the only buses to scan.  This is equivalent to using  <b>--disable-bus</b>  <b>all</b>  before  invoking
       <b>--enable-bus</b>     for the buses of interest.

       The following buses are currently supported by <b>Discover</b>:

          •  <b>ata</b>

          •  <b>pci</b>

          •  <b>pcmcia</b>

          •  <b>scsi</b>

          •  <b>usb</b>

</pre><h4><b>Device</b> <b>Types</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Discover</b>  defines  its own device types, to which the device types used by each bus are mapped.  <b>Discover</b>
       currently recognizes the following device types:

          •  <b>audio</b>

                 A device capable of producing an analog or digital sound signal is an <u>audio</u> device.  Typically,
                 any device commonly referred to as a ``<u>sound</u> <u>card</u>'' is  classified  by  <b>Discover</b>  as  an  audio
                 device.

          •  <b>bridge</b>

                 A device that provides access to devices of a different type, commonly on a different bus, is a
                 <u>bridge</u>  device.   For instance, consumer PCI chipsets often feature a bridge to ATA (also known
                 as IDE) devices.

          •  <b>broadband</b>

                 An interface device to a computer communications network implemented on top of a technology not
                 explicitly designed for that purpose is a <u>broadband</u>     device.  Examples include ISDN terminal
                 adapters as well as DSL and cable ``<u>modems</u>''; analog phone-line modems are not included in this
                 classification (see ``<u>modem</u>'' below).

          •  <b>display</b>

                 A device controlled by the host machine's CPU and capable of producing  an  analog  or  digital
                 video  signal for output purposes is a <u>display</u> device.  Typically, any device commonly referred
                 to as a ``<u>video</u> <u>card</u>'' is classified by <b>Discover</b> as a display device.

          •  <b>fixeddisk</b>

                 A high-speed, fixed magnetic storage device such as a hard disk drive is  a  <u>fixeddisk</u>  device.
                 Removable  media  devices  such  as floppy disk drives, CD-ROM drives, magneto-optical devices,
                 tape drives, and Compact Flash card readers are not included in this classification.

          •  <b>humaninput</b>

                 A device that receives tactile input from a person for the purpose of  directing  a  computer's
                 activity  is  a  <u>humaninput</u>  device.   Examples include keyboards, mice, trackballs, joysticks,
                 gamepads, digital tablets manipulated with a stylus or finger, and  so  forth.   Input  devices
                 that  rely  upon non-tactile means of determining a person's intent, such as speech-recognition
                 devices or cameras, are not included in this classification.

          •  <b>imaging</b>

                 A device that captures still images for input purposes is  an  <u>imaging</u>  device.   Scanners  and
                 digital  cameras  are  examples  of imaging devices.  Motion-capture devices such as television
                 tuner cards, webcams, and digital video cameras are not included in this classification.

          •  <b>miscellaneous</b>

                 Any device that cannot logically be classified  as  another  device  type  is  a  <u>miscellaneous</u>
                 device.

          •  <b>modem</b>

                 An analog phone-line modulator/demodulator (modem) is classified by <b>Discover</b> as a <u>modem</u> device.
                 No other kind of device is so classified.

          •  <b>network</b>

                 An  interface  device  to  a  conventional  computer  data communications network that does not
                 require the use of a terminal adapter is a <u>network</u> device.  For  example,  Ethernet  and  Token
                 Ring  network interface cards are network devices.  Analog phone-line modems; terminal adapters
                 for technologies such as ISDN and DSL; and ``<u>cable</u> <u>modems</u>''     are not ``<u>network</u>'' devices.

          •  <b>optical</b>

                 An optical-technology storage device, often using read-only media, is an  <u>optical</u>  device.   By
                 far the most common examples of these devices are CD-ROM and DVD-ROM drives, including versions
                 of these drives that can ``<u>burn</u>'' (write to) optical discs.

          •  <b>printer</b>

                 A  device  that  renders  visual  output  in a permanent or semi-permanent manner to a physical
                 medium is a <u>printer</u>.  Typically, any device colloquially referred to as a ``<u>printer</u>''  is  also
                 classified by <b>Discover</b> as a printer.

          •  <b>removabledisk</b>

                 Storage  devices  that  feature  removable media using just about any technology except that of
                 magnetic tape, CD-ROM, and DVD-ROM drives are <u>removabledisk</u> devices.  Examples  include  floppy
                 disk drives, magneto-optical drives, and Compact Flash card readers.

          •  <b>tape</b>

                 A  sequential-access  mass  storage device using magnetic tape is a <u>tape</u> device.  Commonly used
                 for archival and backup purposes, DAT drives are examples of tape devices.

          •  <b>video</b>

                 A device that produces a  real-time  digital  video  signal  for  input  purposes  is  a  <u>video</u>
                 device.   Webcams,  digital video cameras, and television tuners are examples of video devices.
                 Note that still digital cameras with ``<u>movie</u>'' capability  are  <u>not</u>  considered  video  devices
                 unless they can transmit the live video signal to the host in real time.
