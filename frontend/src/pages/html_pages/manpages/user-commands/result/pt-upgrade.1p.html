</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       pt-upgrade - Verify that query results are identical on different servers.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       Usage: pt-upgrade [OPTIONS] LOGS|RESULTS DSN [DSN]

       pt-upgrade executes queries in the given MySQL "LOGS" on each "DSN", compares the results, and reports
       any significant differences.  The tool can also save the results for later analyses.  "LOGS" can be slow,
       general, binary, tcpdump, and "raw".

       Compare host2 to host1 using queries in "slow.log":

          pt-upgrade h=host1 h=host2 slow.log

       Compare host2 to saved results from host1:

          pt-upgrade h=host1 --save-results host1_results/ slow.log

          pt-upgrade host1_results1/ h=host2

</pre><h4><b>RISKS</b></h4><pre>
       Percona Toolkit is mature, proven in the real world, and well tested, but all database tools can pose a
       risk to the system and the database server.  Before using this tool, please:

       •   Read the tool's documentation

       •   Review the tool's known "BUGS"

       •   Test the tool on a non-production server

       •   Backup your production server and verify the backups

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       pt-upgrade helps determine if it is safe to upgrade (or downgrade) to a new version of MySQL.  A safe and
       conservative upgrade plan has several steps, one of which is ensuring that queries will produce identical
       results on the new version of MySQL.

       pt-upgrade  executes queries from slow, general, binary, tcpdump, and "raw" logs on two servers, compares
       many aspects of each query's exeuction and results, and reports any  significant  differences.   The  two
       servers  are  typically  development servers, one running the current production version of MySQL and the
       other running the new version of MySQL.

</pre><h4><b>USE</b> <b>CASES</b></h4><pre>
       pt-upgrade has two use cases.  The first, canonical case is running "host to host".  A log file  and  two
       DSN  are  given on the command line, one for each MySQL server.  See the first example in the "SYNOPSIS".
       Queries are executed and compared on each server as the tool runs.  Queries with differences are  printed
       as  the  tool  runs, or when it finishes (see "WHEN QUERIES ARE REPORTED").  Nothing is saved to disk, so
       this use case requires less hard disk space, but the queries must be executed on both servers if the tool
       is ran again, even if one of the servers hasn't changed.  If there are a lot of queries or executing them
       takes a long time, and one server doesn't change, you may want to use the second use case.

       The second use case is running "reference results to host".  Reference results are the  complete  results
       from  a  single MySQL server, saved to disk.  In this case, you must first generate the reference results
       with "--save-results", then run the tool a second time to compare another MySQL server  to  the  results.
       See  the  second  example  in the "SYNOPSIS".  Results are typically generated for the current version of
       MySQL which doesn't change.  This use case can require <u>a</u> <u>lot</u> of disk  space  because  the  results  (i.e.
       rows)  for  all  queries  must  be  saved,  plus  other  data  about the queries.  If you plan to do many
       comparisons against a fixed version of MySQL, this use case is more efficient.   Or  if  you  don't  have
       access to both servers at the same time, this use case allows you to "execute now, compare later".

</pre><h4><b>IMPORTANT</b> <b>CONSIDERATIONS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>CONSISTENCY</b>
       Consistent  environments  and  consistent  data are crucial for obtaining an accurate report.  pt-upgrade
       should never be ran on a production server or any active server because there is no easy way to ensure  a
       synchronous  read  for each query.  If data is changing on either server while pt-upgrade is running, the
       report could contain more false-positives than legitimate  differences.   <b>pt-upgrade</b>  <b>assumes</b>  <b>that</b>  <b>both</b>
       <b>MySQL</b>   <b>servers</b>  <b>are</b>  <b>static,</b>  <b>unchanging</b>  <b>(except</b>  <b>for</b>  <b>any</b>  <b>changes</b>  <b>made</b>  <b>by</b>  <b>the</b>  <b>tool</b>  <b>if</b>  <b>ran</b>  <b>with</b>
       <b>"--no-read-only").</b>  A read-only workload shouldn't affect the tool, except maybe query  times,  so  read-
       only slaves could be used.

   <b>COMPARED</b> <b>TO</b>
       In  a  host  to host comparison, results from the first host establish the norm to which results from the
       second host are compared.  In a reference results to host comparison, the reference results are the  norm
       to  which  the  host  is  compared.   Comparative  phrases  like "smaller than", "better than", etc. mean
       compared to the norm.

       For example, if the query time for an event is 0.01 on the first host and 0.5 on the second host, that is
       a significant difference because 0.5 is worse than 0.1, and so the query will be reported.

   <b>READ-ONLY</b>
       By  default,  pt-upgrade  only  executes  "SELECT"  and  "SET"  statements.   (This  does   not   include
       'SELECT...INTO'  statements,  which do not return rows but dump output to a file or variable.)  If you're
       using recreatable test or development servers and wish to compare write statements  too  (e.g.  "INSERT",
       "UPDATE",   "DELETE"),  then  specify  "--no-read-only".   If  using  a  binary  log,  you  must  specify
       "--no-read-only" because binary logs don't contain "SELECT" statements.  See "--[no]read-only".

   <b>TRANSACTIONS</b>
       The tool does not create its own transactions, but any transactions in  the  "LOG"  are  executed  as-is.
       Since  logs  are  serial,  transactions shouldn't normally be an issue.  If, however, you need to compare
       queries that are somehow transactionally related (in  which  case  you  probably  also  need  to  disable
       "--[no]read-only"),  then  pt-upgrade  probably won't do what you need because it's not designed for this
       purpose.

       pt-upgrade runs with "autocommit=1" by default.

   <b>THROTTLING</b>
       pt-upgrade has no throttling options because the  tool  should  only  be  ran  on  dedicated  testing  or
       development  servers.   <b>Do</b>  <b>not</b>  <b>run</b>  <b>pt-upgrade</b>  <b>on</b>  <b>production</b> <b>servers!</b>  Consequently, the tool is CPU,
       memory, disk, and network intensive.  It executes queries as fast as possible.

</pre><h4><b>QUERY</b> <b>DIFFERENCES</b></h4><pre>
       Significant query differences are determined by comparing these aspects of each query from both hosts:

       Row count
           The number of rows returned by the query should be the same.  This  is  reported  as  "missing  rows"
           under "Row diffs".

       Row data
           The  row data returned by the query should be the same.  All differences are significant: whitespace,
           float-precision, etc.

       Warnings
           The query should either not produce any errors or warnings, or produce the same errors or warnings.

       Query time
           A query rarely executes with a constant time, but its execution time should be within the same  order
           of magnitude or smaller.

       Query errors
           If  a query causes a SQL error on only one host, this is reported as "Query errors".  Since the query
           works on one host, its syntax is probably valid, and the error is due to some condition unique to the
           other host.

       SQL errors
           If a query causes a SQL error on both hosts, this is reported as "SQL errors".  The SQL syntax of the
           query could be invalid.

</pre><h4><b>REPORT</b></h4><pre>
       As pt-upgrade runs, it prints queries with  differences  as  soon  as  it  can  (see  "WHEN  QUERIES  ARE
       REPORTED").   To  prevent  the  report  from becoming too long, queries are not reported individually but
       grouped by fingerprint into classes.  A query fingerprint is the abstracted form of a query,  created  by
       removing literal values, normalizing whitespace, etc.  So these queries belong to the same class:

          SELECT c FROM t WHERE id = 1
          SELECT c FROM t WHERE id=5
          select  c  from  t  where  id  =  9

       The fingerprint for those queries is:

          select c from t where id=?

       Each  query  class  can  have  up  to  "--max-class-size"  unique  queries  (1,000  by  default).   Up to
       "--max-examples" are reported for each type of difference, per query class.  By virtue of  being  in  the
       same  class,  an example of one query's difference is usually representative of all queries with the same
       difference, so it's not necessary to report every example.  The total number of queries in a class with a
       particular difference is indicated in the report.

       The "Query class &lt;ID&gt;" sections are the most important because they list "QUERY DIFFERENCES".  The  first
       part of the section lists the reason why the query class was report, followed by counts of queries in the
       class, followed by the fingerprint which defines the class.

       The  rest  of the query class section lists the "QUERY DIFFERENCES" that caused the class to be reported.
       Each type of difference begins with a double hash mark header that lists the type  and  total  number  of
       queries in the class with the difference.  Then up to "--max-examples" are listed, numbered "-- 1.", "---
       2.",  etc.   Each  example lists the difference for the first and second hosts (respective to the "Hosts"
       section), followed by the first SQL statement that revealed the difference.

</pre><h4><b>WHEN</b> <b>QUERIES</b> <b>ARE</b> <b>REPORTED</b></h4><pre>
       A query class is  reported  as  soon  as  any  one  of  the  "QUERY  DIFFERENCES"  or  query  errors  has
       "--max-examples".  Else, all queries with differences are reported when the tool finishes.

       For  example,  if two query time differences are found for a query class, it is not reported yet.  Once a
       third query time diffence is found, the query class is reported, including any other differences that may
       have been found too.  Queries for the class will continue to be executed,  but  the  class  will  not  be
       reported again.

</pre><h4><b>OUTPUT</b></h4><pre>
       The  "REPORT"  is  printed  to  STDOUT as the tool runs.  Internal warnings, errors, and "--progress" are
       printed to STDERR.  To keep the two separate, run the tool like:

          pt-upgrade ... 1&gt;report 2&gt;err &amp;

       Then "tail -f err" while the tool is running to track its "--progress".

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       In general, the tool exits zero if it finishes normally and there were no internal  warnings  or  errors,
       and  no  "QUERY  DIFFERENCES" were found.  Else the tool exits non-zero with one or more of the following
       codes:

       •   1

           There were too many internal errors or warnings; see STDERR.  See also "--[no]continue-on-error".

       •   4

           There were "QUERY DIFFERENCES"; see the "REPORT".

       •   8

           "--run-time" expired; the tool did not finish reading the logs or reference results.

       Other exit codes indicate that the tool crashed or died unexpectedly.  The error that caused this  should
       have printed to STDERR.

       To  check  for a particular exit code, logical "AND" ("&amp;") the final exit status with the exit code.  For
       example, exit status 5 implies codes 1 and 4 because "5 &amp; 1" is true, and "5 &amp; 4" is true.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       This tool accepts additional command-line arguments.  Refer to the "SYNOPSIS" and usage  information  for
       details.

       --ask-pass
           Prompt for a password when connecting to MySQL.

       --charset
           short form: -A; type: string

           Default  character  set.   If  the  value  is utf8, sets Perl's binmode on STDOUT to utf8, passes the
           mysql_enable_utf8 option to DBD::mysql, and runs SET NAMES UTF8 after connecting to MySQL.  Any other
           value sets binmode on STDOUT without the utf8 layer, and runs SET NAMES after connecting to MySQL.

       --config
           type: Array

           Read this comma-separated list of config files; if specified, this must be the first  option  on  the
           command line.

       --[no]continue-on-error
           default: yes

           Continue  parsing  even if there is an error.  The tool will not continue forever: it stops after 100
           errors, in which case there is probably a bug in the tool or the input is invalid.

       --[no]create-upgrade-table
           default: yes

           Create the "--upgrade-table" database and table.

       --daemonize
           Fork to the background and detach from the shell.  POSIX operating systems only.

       --database
           short form: -D; type: string

           Default database when connecting to MySQL.

       --defaults-file
           short form: -F; type: string

           Only read MySQL options from the given file.  You must give an absolute pathname.

       --[no]disable-query-cache
           default: yes

           "SET SESSION query_cache_type = OFF" to disable the query cache.

       --dry-run
           Run but do not execute or compare queries.   This  is  useful  for  checking  command  line  options,
           connections to MySQL, and log or reference results parsing.

       --filter
           type: string

           Allow events for which this Perl code returns true.

           See the same option in the documentation for pt-query-digest.

       --help
           Show help and exit.

       --host
           short form: -h; type: string

           MySQL hostname or IP.

       --ignore-warnings
           type: Hash

           Ignore these MySQL warning codes when comparing warnings.

       --log
           type: string

           Print  STDOUT  and  STDERR  to  this  file  when  daemonized.   This  option  only  takes affect when
           "--daemonize" is specified.  The file is created if it doesn't exist, else output is appended to it.

       --max-class-size
           type: int; default: 1000

           Max number of unique queries in each query class.  See "REPORT".

       --max-examples
           type: int; default: 3

           Max number of examples to list for each "QUERY DIFFERENCES".  A query class is reported  as  soon  as
           this many examples for any type of query difference are found.

       --password
           short form: -p; type: string

           MySQL password for the "--user".

       --pid
           type: string

           Create  the  given  PID  file.   The  tool  won't start if the PID file already exists and the PID it
           contains is different than the current PID.  However, if the PID file exists and the PID it  contains
           is  no  longer  running,  the tool will overwrite the PID file with the current PID.  The PID file is
           removed automatically when the tool exits.

       --port
           short form: -P; type: int

           MySQL port number.

       --progress
           type: array; default: time,30

           Print progress reports to STDERR.  The tool prints progress reports while reading logs  or  reference
           results, roughly estimating how long until it finishes.

           The  value  is  a  comma-separated  list  with two parts.  The first part can be percentage, time, or
           iterations; the second part specifies how often an update should be printed, in percentage,  seconds,
           or number of iterations.

       --[no]read-only
           default: yes

           Execute  only  "SELECT"  and  "SET"  statements.   If  "--no-read-only" is specified, <u>all</u> queries are
           exeucted: "DROP", "DELETE", "UPDATE", etc.  Even when running in default read-only mode,  you  should
           use a MySQL user with only "SELECT" privileges to insure against bugs in the tool.

       --report
           type: Hash; default: hosts, logs, queries, stats

           Print these sections of the "REPORT".

       --run-time
           type: time

           How  long  to  run  before  exiting.  By default, the tool runs until it finishes reading the logs or
           reference results.

       --save-results
           type: string

           Save reference results to this directory.  This option works only  when  one  DSN  is  specified,  to
           generate  reference  results.   When  comparing  a  host  to  reference  results, specify its results
           directory instead of its DSN.  See the second example in the "SYNOPSIS".

           Reference results can use <u>a</u> <u>lot</u> of disk space.

       --set-vars
           type: Array

           Set the MySQL variables in this comma-separated list of "variable=value" pairs.

           By default, the tool sets:

              wait_timeout=10000

           Variables specified on the command line override these defaults.  For example, specifying "--set-vars
           wait_timeout=500" overrides the defaultvalue of 10000.

           The tool prints a warning and continues if a variable cannot be set.

       --socket
           short form: -S; type: string

           Socket file to use for connection.

       --type
           type: string; default: slowlog

           Type of log files.  Valid types are:

             VALUE    LOG TYPE
             =======  ===========================================
             slowlog  MySQL slow log
             genlog   MySQL general log
             binlog   MySQL binary log (converted by mysqlbinlog)
             tcpdump  TCP dump file generated by tcpdump command
             rawlog   Custom log with one SQL statement per line

       --upgrade-table
           type: string; default: percona_schema.pt_upgrade

           Use this table to clear warnings.  To clear all warnings from previous queries,  pt-upgrade  executes
           "SELECT * FROM --upgrade-table LIMIT 1" on each host before executing each query.

           The  table  must  be  database-qualified.   The  database  and table are automatically created unless
           "--no-create-upgrade-table" is specified (see "--[no]create-upgrade-table").  If the table  does  not
           already exist, it is created with this definition:

              CREATE TABLE pt_upgrade (
                id INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY
              )

       --user
           short form: -u; type: string

           MySQL user if not the current system user.

       --version
           Show version and exit.

       --[no]version-check
           default: yes

           Check for the latest version of Percona Toolkit, MySQL, and other programs.

           This  is  a standard "check for updates automatically" feature, with two additional features.  First,
           the tool checks its own version and also the versions of the following  software:  operating  system,
           Percona Monitoring and Management (PMM), MySQL, Perl, MySQL driver for Perl (DBD::mysql), and Percona
           Toolkit.  Second,  it  checks  for  and  warns about versions with known problems. For example, MySQL
           5.5.25 had a critical bug and was re-released as 5.5.25a.

           A secure connection to Percona’s Version Check database server is done to perform these checks.  Each
           request  is  logged  by  the  server, including software version numbers and unique ID of the checked
           system. The ID is generated by the Percona Toolkit installation script  or  when  the  Version  Check
           database call is done for the first time.

           Any  updates  or  known problems are printed to STDOUT before the tool's normal output.  This feature
           should never interfere with the normal operation of the tool.

       --watch-server
           type: string

           Parse only events for this IP:port for "--type" tcpdump.  All other IP addresses are ignored.  If not
           specified, pt-upgrade watches all servers by looking for any IP address using port 3306  or  "mysql".
           If  you're  watching  a  server with a non-standard port, this won't work, so you must specify the IP
           address and port to watch.

           If you want to watch a mix of servers, some running on standard port 3306 and some  running  on  non-
           standard  ports,  you  need  to create separate tcpdump outputs for the non-standard port servers and
           then specify this option for each.  At present pt-upgrade cannot auto-detect servers on port 3306 and
           also be told to watch a server on a non-standard port.

</pre><h4><b>DSN</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       These DSN options are used to create a DSN.  Each option is given like "option=value".  The  options  are
       case-sensitive,  so P and p are not the same option.  There cannot be whitespace before or after the "=",
       and if the value contains whitespace it must be  quoted.   DSN  options  are  comma-separated.   See  the
       percona-toolkit manpage for full details.

       •   A

           dsn: charset; copy: yes

           Default character set.

       •   D

           dsn: database; copy: yes

           Default database.

       •   F

           dsn: mysql_read_default_file; copy: yes

           Only read default options from the given file

       •   h

           dsn: host; copy: yes

           Connect to host.

       •   L

           copy: yes

           Explicitly enable LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE.

           For  some  reason,  some  vendors  compile  libmysql  without the --enable-local-infile option, which
           disables the statement.  This can lead to weird situations, like the server  allowing  LOCAL  INFILE,
           but the client throwing exceptions if it's used.

           However,   as   long  as  the  server  allows  LOAD  DATA,  clients  can  easily  re-enable  it;  See
           &lt;https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/load-data-local.html&gt;                                    and
           &lt;<a href="http://search.cpan.org/~capttofu/DBD-mysql/lib/DBD/mysql.pm">http://search.cpan.org/~capttofu/DBD-mysql/lib/DBD/mysql.pm</a>&gt;.  This option does exactly that.

           Although  we've  not found a case where turning this option leads to errors or differing behavior, to
           be on the safe side, this option is not on by default.

       •   p

           dsn: password; copy: yes

           Password to use when connecting.  If password contains commas they must be escaped with a  backslash:
           "exam\,ple"

       •   P

           dsn: port; copy: yes

           Port number to use for connection.

       •   S

           dsn: mysql_socket; copy: yes

           Socket file to use for connection.

       •   u

           dsn: user; copy: yes

           User for login if not current user.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       The  environment  variable "PTDEBUG" enables verbose debugging output to STDERR.  To enable debugging and
       capture all output to a file, run the tool like:

          PTDEBUG=1 pt-upgrade ... &gt; FILE 2&gt;&amp;1

       Be careful: debugging output is voluminous and can generate several megabytes of output.

</pre><h4><b>SYSTEM</b> <b>REQUIREMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       You need Perl, DBI, DBD::mysql, and some core packages that ought to be installed in any  reasonably  new
       version of Perl.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       For a list of known bugs, see &lt;<a href="http://www.percona.com/bugs/pt-upgrade">http://www.percona.com/bugs/pt-upgrade</a>&gt;.

       Please  report bugs at &lt;https://jira.percona.com/projects/PT&gt;.  Include the following information in your
       bug report:

       •   Complete command-line used to run the tool

       •   Tool "--version"

       •   MySQL version of all servers involved

       •   Output from the tool including STDERR

       •   Input files (log/dump/config files, etc.)

       If possible, include debugging output by running the tool with "PTDEBUG"; see "ENVIRONMENT".
