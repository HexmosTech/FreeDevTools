</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>mprof-heap-viewer</b> GUI viewer for the logging profiler heap snapshots

       WARNING:  this  application is unfinished and experimental.  Nevertheless it should work, and bug reports
       are encouraged.

       This program decodes the contents of a logging profiler output file and locates all  the  heap  snapshots
       inside it.  The user can then select each individual snapshot and decide to load it in memory and explore
       its contents.

       The  GUI  is  organized to work on "object sets" (listed in a tree view on the left).  All operations are
       performed with a popup menu on the choosen set.

       Initially the sets are the heap snapshots (of  course  a  heap  snapshot  can  be  considered  a  set  of
       objects!).  For each set the GUI shows on the right a list that breaks it down by class (one row for each
       class).

       The  user  can  then  refine each set using a "filter", to select a subset.  Examples of filters are "all
       objects of class X", or "all objects that reference an object of class X".  This way  the  user  explores
       the  sets  breaking  them down to subsets (each subset in the GUI is a child of its owner set on the tree
       view).

       Moreover the user can issue a "compare" operation between two arbitrary sets A and B, which will  compute
       two  subsets:  "A  -  B" (the objects of A which are not in B, a subsect of A) and "B - A" (the reverse).
       This can help in understanding what changed on the heap between garbage collections.
