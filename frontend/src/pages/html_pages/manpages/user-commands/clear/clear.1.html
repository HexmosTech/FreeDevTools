</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       <b>clear</b> - clear the terminal screen

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>clear</b> [<b>-x</b>] [<b>-T</b> <u>terminal-type</u>]

       <b>clear</b> <b>-V</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>clear</b> clears your terminal's screen and its scrollback buffer, if any.  <b>clear</b> retrieves the terminal type
       from  the  environment  variable  <u>TERM</u>, then consults the <u>terminfo</u> terminal capability database entry for
       that type to determine how to perform these actions.

       The capabilities to clear the screen and scrollback buffer are named “clear” and “E3”, respectively.  The
       latter is a <u>user-defined</u> <u>capability</u>, applying an extension mechanism introduced in <u>ncurses</u> 5.0 (1999).

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>clear</b> recognizes the following options.

       <b>-T</b> <u>type</u>  produces instructions suitable for the terminal <u>type</u>.  Normally,  this  option  is  unnecessary,
                because  the  terminal  type  is inferred from the environment variable <u>TERM</u>.  If this option is
                specified, <b>clear</b> ignores the environment variables <u>LINES</u> and <u>COLUMNS</u> as well.

       <b>-V</b>       reports the version of <u>ncurses</u> associated with this program and exits with a successful status.

       <b>-x</b>       prevents <b>clear</b> from attempting to clear the scrollback buffer.

</pre><h4><b>PORTABILITY</b></h4><pre>
       Neither IEEE Std 1003.1/The Open Group Base  Specifications  Issue 7  (POSIX.1-2008)  nor  X/Open  Curses
       Issue 7 documents <b>clear</b>.

       The latter documents <b>tput</b>, which could be used to replace this utility either via a shell script or by an
       alias (such as a symbolic link) to run <b>tput</b> as <b>clear</b>.

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       A  <b>clear</b>  command  using  the  <u>termcap</u> database and library appeared in 2BSD (1979).  Eighth Edition Unix
       (1985) later included it.

       The commercial Unix arm of AT&amp;T adapted a different BSD program (<b>tset</b>) to make a new command,  <b>tput</b>,  and
       replaced the <b>clear</b> program with a shell script that called “<b>tput</b> <b>clear</b>”.

           <a href="file:///usr/lib/w3m/cgi-bin/w3mman2html.cgi?tput">/usr/bin/tput</a> ${1:+-T$1} clear 2&gt; /dev/null
           exit

       In  1989,  when  Keith  Bostic revised the BSD <b>tput</b> command to make it similar to AT&amp;T's <b>tput</b>, he added a
       <b>clear</b> shell script as well.

           exec tput clear

       The remainder of the script in each case is a copyright notice.

       In 1995, <u>ncurses</u>'s <b>clear</b> began by adapting  BSD's  original  <b>clear</b>  command  to  use  <u>terminfo</u>.   The  <b>E3</b>
       extension came later.

       •   In  June  1999, <u>xterm</u> provided an extension to the standard control sequence for clearing the screen.
           Rather than clearing just the visible part of the screen using

               printf '\033[2J'

           one could clear the scrollback buffer as well by using

               printf '\033[<b>3</b>J'

           instead.  “XTerm Control Sequences” documents this feature as originating with <u>xterm</u>.

       •   A few other terminal emulators adopted it, such as PuTTY in 2006.

       •   In April 2011, a Red Hat developer submitted a patch to  the  Linux  kernel,  modifying  its  console
           driver  to  do the same thing.  Documentation of this change, appearing in Linux 3.0, did not mention
           <u>xterm</u>, although that program was cited in the Red Hat bug report (#683733) motivating the feature.

       •   Subsequently, more terminal developers adopted the feature.  The next relevant step was to change the
           <u>ncurses</u> <b>clear</b> program in 2013 to incorporate this extension.

       •   In 2013, the <b>E3</b> capability was not exercised by “<b>tput</b> <b>clear</b>”.  That oversight was addressed  in  2016
           by reorganizing <b>tput</b> to share its logic with <b>clear</b> and <b>tset</b>.
