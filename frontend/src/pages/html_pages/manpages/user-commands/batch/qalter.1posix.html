           <u>job_identifier</u>...

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  attributes  of  a batch job are altered by a request to the batch server that manages the batch job.
       The <u>qalter</u> utility is a user-accessible batch client that requests the alteration of  the  attributes  of
       one or more batch jobs.

       The <u>qalter</u> utility shall alter the attributes of those batch jobs, and only those batch jobs, for which a
       batch <u>job_identifier</u> is presented to the utility.

       The  <u>qalter</u>  utility  shall  alter  the  attributes  of  batch  jobs  in  the  order  in  which the batch
       <u>job_identifier</u>s are presented to the utility.

       If the <u>qalter</u> utility fails to process a batch <u>job_identifier</u> successfully, the utility shall proceed  to
       process the remaining batch <u>job_identifier</u>s, if any.

       For  each  batch  <u>job_identifier</u>  for which the <u>qalter</u> utility succeeds, each attribute of the identified
       batch job shall be altered as indicated by all the options presented to the utility.

       For each identified batch job for which the <u>qalter</u>  utility  fails,  the  utility  shall  not  alter  any
       attribute of the batch job.

       For  each  batch  job that the <u>qalter</u> utility processes, the utility shall not modify any attribute other
       than those required by the options and option-arguments presented to the utility.

       The <u>qalter</u> utility shall alter batch jobs by sending a <u>Modify</u>  <u>Job</u>  <u>Request</u>  to  the  batch  server  that
       manages  each  batch  job.  At  the  time  the <u>qalter</u> utility exits, it shall have modified the batch job
       corresponding to each successfully processed batch <u>job_identifier</u>.  An attempt to alter the attributes of
       a batch job in the RUNNING state is implementation-defined.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>qalter</u> utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017,  <u>Section</u>  <u>12.2</u>,  <u>Utility</u>
       <u>Syntax</u> <u>Guidelines</u>.

       The following options shall be supported by the implementation:

       <b>-a</b> <u>date_time</u>
                 Redefine the time at which the batch job becomes eligible for execution.

                 The  <u>date_time</u>  argument shall be in the same form and represent the same time as for the <u>touch</u>
                 utility. The time so represented shall be set into the <u>Execution_Time</u> attribute  of  the  batch
                 job.  If  the  time  specified  is  earlier  than the current time, the <b>-a</b> option shall have no
                 effect.

       <b>-A</b> <u>account_string</u>
                 Redefine the account to which the resource consumption of the batch job should be charged.

                 The syntax of the <u>account_string</u> option-argument is unspecified.

                 The <u>qalter</u> utility shall set the <u>Account_Name</u> attribute of the batch job to the  value  of  the
                 <u>account_string</u> option-argument.

       <b>-c</b> <u>interval</u>
                 Redefine whether the batch job should be checkpointed, and if so, how often.

                 The  <u>qalter</u>  utility  shall  accept a value for the interval option-argument that is one of the
                 following:

                 n         No checkpointing is to be performed on the batch job (NO_CHECKPOINT).

                 s         Checkpointing  is  to  be  performed  only  when  the  batch  server  is  shut   down
                           (CHECKPOINT_AT_SHUTDOWN).

                 c         Automatic  periodic  checkpointing  is  to  be  performed at the <u>Minimum_Cpu_Interval</u>
                           attribute    of    the    batch    queue,     in     units     of     CPU     minutes
                           (CHECKPOINT_AT_MIN_CPU_INTERVAL).

                 c=<u>minutes</u> Automatic  periodic  checkpointing  is  to be performed every <u>minutes</u> of CPU time, or
                           every <u>Minimum_Cpu_Interval</u> minutes, whichever is greater. The <u>minutes</u> argument  shall
                           conform to the syntax for unsigned integers and shall be greater than zero.

                 An  implementation  may  define  other  checkpoint  intervals.  The conformance document for an
                 implementation shall describe any alternative checkpoint intervals,  how  they  are  specified,
                 their internal behavior, and how they affect the behavior of the utility.

                 The  <u>qalter</u>  utility  shall  set  the <u>Checkpoint</u> attribute of the batch job to the value of the
                 <u>interval</u> option-argument.

       <b>-e</b> <u>path_name</u>
                 Redefine the path to be used for the standard error stream of the batch job.

                 The <u>qalter</u> utility shall accept a <u>path_name</u> option-argument that conforms to the syntax of  the
                 <u>path_name</u>  element  defined  in  the  System  Interfaces  volume  of POSIX.1‐2017, which can be
                 preceded by a host name element of the form <u>hostname</u>:.

                 If the <u>path_name</u> option-argument constitutes an absolute pathname, the <u>qalter</u> utility shall set
                 the <u>Error_Path</u> attribute of the batch job  to  the  value  of  the  <u>path_name</u>  option-argument,
                 including the host name element, if present.

                 If  the  <u>path_name</u>  option-argument constitutes a relative pathname and no host name element is
                 specified, the <u>qalter</u> utility shall set the <u>Error_Path</u> attribute of the batch job to the  value
                 of  the  absolute  pathname  derived by expanding the <u>path_name</u> option-argument relative to the
                 current directory of the process that executes the <u>qalter</u> utility.

                 If the <u>path_name</u> option-argument constitutes a relative pathname and a  host  name  element  is
                 specified,  the <u>qalter</u> utility shall set the <u>Error_Path</u> attribute of the batch job to the value
                 of the option-argument without expansion.

                 If the <u>path_name</u> option-argument does not include a host name element, the <u>qalter</u> utility shall
                 prefix the pathname in the <u>Error_Path</u> attribute with <u>hostname</u>:, where <u>hostname</u> is the  name  of
                 the host upon which the <u>qalter</u> utility is being executed.

       <b>-h</b> <u>hold_list</u>
                 Redefine  the  types  of  holds,  if any, on the batch job. The <u>qalter</u> <b>-h</b> option shall accept a
                 value for the <u>hold_list</u> option-argument that is a string  of  alphanumeric  characters  in  the
                 portable character set.

                 The  <u>qalter</u>  utility shall accept a value for the <u>hold_list</u> option-argument that is a string of
                 one or more of the characters <b>'u'</b>, <b>'s'</b>, or <b>'o'</b>, or the single character <b>'n'</b>.  For  each  unique
                 character  in  the  <u>hold_list</u>  option-argument,  the  <u>qalter</u>  utility  shall add a value to the
                 <u>Hold_Types</u> attribute of the batch job as follows, each representing a different hold type:

                 u     USER

                 s     SYSTEM

                 o     OPERATOR

                 If any of these characters are duplicated in  the  <u>hold_list</u>  option-argument,  the  duplicates
                 shall be ignored. An existing <u>Hold_Types</u> attribute can be cleared by the hold type:

                 n     NO_HOLD

                 The  <u>qalter</u> utility shall consider it an error if any hold type other than <b>'n'</b> is combined with
                 hold type <b>'n'</b>.  Strictly conforming applications shall not repeat any of  the  characters  <b>'u'</b>,
                 <b>'s'</b>,  <b>'o'</b>,  or  <b>'n'</b>  within  the <u>hold_list</u> option-argument. The <u>qalter</u> utility shall permit the
                 repetition of characters, but shall not assign additional meaning to the  repeated  characters.
                 An  implementation  may define other hold types. The conformance document for an implementation
                 shall describe any additional hold types, how they are specified, their internal behavior,  and
                 how they affect the behavior of the utility.

       <b>-j</b> <u>join_list</u>
                 Redefine  which  streams of the batch job are to be merged. The <u>qalter</u> <b>-j</b> option shall accept a
                 value for the <u>join_list</u> option-argument that is a string  of  alphanumeric  characters  in  the
                 portable character set.

                 The <u>qalter</u> utility shall accept a <u>join_list</u> option-argument that consists of one or more of the
                 characters <b>'e'</b> and <b>'o'</b>, or the single character <b>'n'</b>.

                 All  of  the  other  batch  job output streams specified shall be merged into the output stream
                 represented by the character listed first in the <u>join_list</u> option-argument.

                 For each unique character in the <u>join_list</u> option-argument, the  <u>qalter</u>  utility  shall  add  a
                 value  to  the  <u>Join_Path</u>  attribute of the batch job as follows, each representing a different
                 batch job stream to join:

                 e     The standard error of the batch job (JOIN_STD_ERROR).

                 o     The standard output of the batch job (JOIN_STD_OUTPUT).

                 An existing <u>Join_Path</u> attribute can be cleared by the join type:

                 n     NO_JOIN

                 If <b>'n'</b> is specified, then no files are joined. The <u>qalter</u> utility shall consider it an error if
                 any join type other than <b>'n'</b> is combined with join type <b>'n'</b>.

                 Strictly conforming applications shall not repeat any of the characters <b>'e'</b>, <b>'o'</b>, or <b>'n'</b> within
                 the <u>join_list</u> option-argument. The <u>qalter</u> utility shall permit the  repetition  of  characters,
                 but shall not assign additional meaning to the repeated characters.

                 An  implementation  may define other join types. The conformance document for an implementation
                 shall describe any additional batch  job  streams,  how  they  are  specified,  their  internal
                 behavior, and how they affect the behavior of the utility.

       <b>-k</b> <u>keep_list</u>
                 Redefine which output of the batch job to retain on the execution host.

                 The <u>qalter</u> <b>-k</b> option shall accept a value for the <u>keep_list</u> option-argument that is a string of
                 alphanumeric characters in the portable character set.

                 The <u>qalter</u> utility shall accept a <u>keep_list</u> option-argument that consists of one or more of the
                 characters <b>'e'</b> and <b>'o'</b>, or the single character <b>'n'</b>.

                 For  each  unique  character  in  the <u>keep_list</u> option-argument, the <u>qalter</u> utility shall add a
                 value to the <u>Keep_Files</u> attribute of the batch job as follows, each  representing  a  different
                 batch job stream to keep:

                 e     The standard error of the batch job (KEEP_STD_ERROR).

                 o     The standard output of the batch job (KEEP_STD_OUTPUT).

                 If  both  <b>'e'</b>  and  <b>'o'</b>  are  specified,  then  both files are retained. An existing <u>Keep_Files</u>
                 attribute can be cleared by the keep type:

                 n     NO_KEEP

                 If <b>'n'</b> is specified, then no files are retained. The <u>qalter</u> utility shall consider it an  error
                 if any keep type other than <b>'n'</b> is combined with keep type <b>'n'</b>.

                 Strictly conforming applications shall not repeat any of the characters <b>'e'</b>, <b>'o'</b>, or <b>'n'</b> within
                 the  <u>keep_list</u>  option-argument.  The <u>qalter</u> utility shall permit the repetition of characters,
                 but shall not assign additional meaning to  the  repeated  characters.  An  implementation  may
                 define  other  keep  types.  The  conformance document for an implementation shall describe any
                 additional keep types, how they are specified, their internal behavior, and how they affect the
                 behavior of the utility.

       <b>-l</b> <u>resource_list</u>
                 Redefine the resources that are allowed or required by the batch job.

                 The <u>qalter</u> utility shall accept a <u>resource_list</u> option-argument that conforms to the  following
                 syntax:

                     resource=value[,,resource=value,,...]

                 The <u>qalter</u> utility shall set one entry in the value of the <u>Resource_List</u> attribute of the batch
                 job for each resource listed in the <u>resource_list</u> option-argument.

                 Because  the  list  of  supported resource names might vary by batch server, the <u>qalter</u> utility
                 shall rely on the batch server to validate  the  resource  names  and  associated  values.  See
                 <u>Section</u>  <u>3.3.3</u>,  <u>Multiple</u>  <u>Keyword-Value</u>  <u>Pairs</u>  for  a  means  of  removing <u>keyword</u>=<u>value</u> (and
                 <u>value</u>@<u>keyword</u>) pairs and other general rules for list-oriented batch job attributes.

       <b>-m</b> <u>mail_options</u>
                 Redefine the points in the execution of the batch job at which the batch server is to send mail
                 about a change in the state of the batch job.

                 The <u>qalter</u> <b>-m</b> option shall accept a value for the <u>mail_options</u> option-argument that is a string
                 of alphanumeric characters in the portable character set.

                 The <u>qalter</u> utility shall accept a value for the <u>mail_options</u> option-argument that is  a  string
                 of  one  or  more  of  the characters <b>'e'</b>, <b>'b'</b>, and <b>'a'</b>, or the single character <b>'n'</b>.  For each
                 unique character in the <u>mail_options</u> option-argument, the <u>qalter</u> utility shall add a  value  to
                 the <u>Mail_Users</u> attribute of the batch job as follows, each representing a different time during
                 the life of a batch job at which to send mail:

                 e     MAIL_AT_EXIT

                 b     MAIL_AT_BEGINNING

                 a     MAIL_AT_ABORT

                 If  any  of these characters are duplicated in the <u>mail_options</u> option-argument, the duplicates
                 shall be ignored.

                 An existing <u>Mail_Points</u> attribute can be cleared by the mail type:

                 n     NO_MAIL

                 If <b>'n'</b> is specified, then mail is not sent. The <u>qalter</u> utility shall consider it  an  error  if
                 any  mail type other than <b>'n'</b> is combined with mail type <b>'n'</b>.  Strictly conforming applications
                 shall not repeat any of the characters <b>'e'</b>, <b>'b'</b>, <b>'a'</b>, or <b>'n'</b> within  the  <u>mail_options</u>  option-
                 argument.  The  <u>qalter</u>  utility  shall permit the repetition of characters but shall not assign
                 additional meaning to the repeated characters.

                 An implementation may define other mail types. The conformance document for  an  implementation
                 shall  describe any additional mail types, how they are specified, their internal behavior, and
                 how they affect the behavior of the utility.

       <b>-M</b> <u>mail_list</u>
                 Redefine the list of users to which the batch server that executes the batch  job  is  to  send
                 mail, if the batch server sends mail about the batch job.

                 The syntax of the <u>mail_list</u> option-argument is unspecified. If the implementation of the <u>qalter</u>
                 utility  uses  a  name service to locate users, the utility shall accept the syntax used by the
                 name service.

                 If the implementation of the <u>qalter</u> utility does not use a name service to  locate  users,  the
                 implementation shall accept the following syntax for user names:

                     mail_address[,,mail_address,,...]

                 The interpretation of <u>mail_address</u> is implementation-defined.

                 The  <u>qalter</u>  utility  shall  set  the <u>Mail_Users</u> attribute of the batch job to the value of the
                 <u>mail_list</u> option-argument.

       <b>-N</b> <u>name</u>   Redefine the name of the batch job.

                 The <u>qalter</u> <b>-N</b> option shall accept a value for the <u>name</u> option-argument that is a string  of  up
                 to  15  alphanumeric  characters  in  the  portable  character set where the first character is
                 alphabetic.

                 The syntax of the <u>name</u> option-argument is unspecified.

                 The <u>qalter</u> utility shall set the <u>Job_Name</u> attribute of the batch job to the value of  the  <u>name</u>
                 option-argument.

       <b>-o</b> <u>path_name</u>
                 Redefine the path for the standard output of the batch job.

                 The  <u>qalter</u> utility shall accept a <u>path_name</u> option-argument that conforms to the syntax of the
                 <u>path_name</u> element defined in the  System  Interfaces  volume  of  POSIX.1‐2017,  which  can  be
                 preceded by a host name element of the form <u>hostname</u>:.

                 If the <u>path_name</u> option-argument constitutes an absolute pathname, the <u>qalter</u> utility shall set
                 the <u>Output_Path</u> attribute of the batch job to the value of the <u>path_name</u> option-argument.

                 If  the  <u>path_name</u>  option-argument constitutes a relative pathname and no host name element is
                 specified, the <u>qalter</u> utility shall set the <u>Output_Path</u> attribute  of  the  batch  job  to  the
                 absolute  pathname  derived  by expanding the <u>path_name</u> option-argument relative to the current
                 directory of the process that executes the <u>qalter</u> utility.

                 If the <u>path_name</u> option-argument constitutes a relative pathname and a  host  name  element  is
                 specified, the <u>qalter</u> utility shall set the <u>Output_Path</u> attribute of the batch job to the value
                 of the <u>path_name</u> option-argument without any expansion of the pathname.

                 If the <u>path_name</u> option-argument does not include a host name element, the <u>qalter</u> utility shall
                 prefix  the pathname in the <u>Output_Path</u> attribute with <u>hostname</u>:, where <u>hostname</u> is the name of
                 the host upon which the <u>qalter</u> utility is being executed.

       <b>-p</b> <u>priority</u>
                 Redefine the priority of the batch job.

                 The <u>qalter</u> utility shall accept a value for the priority option-argument that conforms  to  the
                 syntax for signed decimal integers, and which is not less than -1024 and not greater than 1023.

                 The  <u>qalter</u>  utility  shall  set  the  <u>Priority</u>  attribute of the batch job to the value of the
                 <u>priority</u> option-argument.

       <b>-r</b> y|n    Redefine whether the batch job is rerunnable.

                 If the value of the option-argument  is  <b>'y'</b>,  the  <u>qalter</u>  utility  shall  set  the  <u>Rerunable</u>
                 attribute of the batch job to TRUE.

                 If  the  value  of  the  option-argument  is  <b>'n'</b>,  the  <u>qalter</u> utility shall set the <u>Rerunable</u>
                 attribute of the batch job to FALSE.

                 The <u>qalter</u> utility shall consider it an error if  any  character  other  than  <b>'y'</b>  or  <b>'n'</b>  is
                 specified in the option-argument.

       <b>-S</b> <u>path_name_list</u>
                 Redefine the shell that interprets the script at the destination system.

                 The <u>qalter</u> utility shall accept a <u>path_name_list</u> option-argument that conforms to the following
                 syntax:

                     pathname[@host][,pathname[@host],...]

                 The  <u>qalter</u>  utility  shall accept only one pathname that is missing a corresponding host name.
                 The <u>qalter</u> utility shall allow only one pathname per named host.

                 The <u>qalter</u> utility shall add a value to the <u>Shell_Path_List</u> attribute of the batch job for each
                 entry in the <u>path_name_list</u> option-argument. See <u>Section</u> <u>3.3.3</u>,  <u>Multiple</u>  <u>Keyword-Value</u>  <u>Pairs</u>
                 for  a  means  of  removing <u>keyword</u>=<u>value</u> (and <u>value</u>@<u>keyword</u>) pairs and other general rules for
                 list-oriented batch job attributes.

       <b>-u</b> <u>user_list</u>
                 Redefine the user name under which the batch job is to run at the destination system.

                 The <u>qalter</u> utility shall accept a <u>user_list</u> option-argument  that  conforms  to  the  following
                 syntax:

                     username[@host][,,username[@host],,...]

                 The  <u>qalter</u>  utility shall accept only one user name that is missing a corresponding host name.
                 The <u>qalter</u> utility shall accept only one user name per named host.

                 The <u>qalter</u> utility shall add a value to the <u>User_List</u> attribute of the batch job for each entry
                 in the <u>user_list</u> option-argument. See <u>Section</u> <u>3.3.3</u>, <u>Multiple</u> <u>Keyword-Value</u> <u>Pairs</u> for  a  means
                 of  removing  <u>keyword</u>=<u>value</u> (and <u>value</u>@<u>keyword</u>) pairs and other general rules for list-oriented
                 batch job attributes.

</pre><h4><b>OPERANDS</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>qalter</u> utility  shall  accept  one  or  more  operands  that  conform  to  the  syntax  for  a  batch
       <u>job_identifier</u> (see <u>Section</u> <u>3.3.1</u>, <u>Batch</u> <u>Job</u> <u>Identifier</u>).

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of <u>qalter</u>:

       <u>LANG</u>      Provide a default value for the internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See the
                 Base  Definitions  volume  of  POSIX.1‐2017,  <u>Section</u>  <u>8.2</u>,  <u>Internationalization</u> <u>Variables</u> the
                 precedence  of  internationalization  variables  used  to  determine  the  values   of   locale
                 categories.)

       <u>LC_ALL</u>    If  set  to a non-empty string value, override the values of all the other internationalization
                 variables.

       <u>LC_CTYPE</u>  Determine the locale for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of text  data  as  characters
                 (for example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments).

       <u>LC_MESSAGES</u>
                 Determine  the  locale  that  should  be  used  to affect the format and contents of diagnostic
                 messages written to standard error.

       <u>LOGNAME</u>   Determine the login name of the user.

       <u>TZ</u>        Determine the timezone used to interpret the <u>date-time</u> option-argument. If <u>TZ</u> is unset or null,
                 an unspecified default timezone shall be used.

       &gt;0    An error occurred.

</pre><h4><b>CONSEQUENCES</b> <b>OF</b> <b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       In addition to the default behavior, the <u>qalter</u> utility shall not  be  required  to  write  a  diagnostic
       message  to  standard  error  when  the error reply received from a batch server indicates that the batch
       <u>job_identifier</u> does not exist on the server. Whether or not the <u>qalter</u> utility  attempts  to  locate  the
       batch job on other batch servers is implementation-defined.

       <u>The</u> <u>following</u> <u>sections</u> <u>are</u> <u>informative.</u>

</pre><h4><b>APPLICATION</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>RATIONALE</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>qalter</u> utility allows users to change the attributes of a batch job.

       As  a  means of altering a queued job, the <u>qalter</u> utility is superior to deleting and requeuing the batch
       job insofar as an altered job retains its place in the queue with some traditional selection  algorithms.
       In addition, the <u>qalter</u> utility is both shorter and simpler than a sequence of <u>qdel</u> and <u>qsub</u> utilities.

       The result of an attempt on the part of a user to alter a batch job in a RUNNING state is implementation-
       defined  because a batch job in the RUNNING state will already have opened its output files and otherwise
       performed any actions indicated by the options in effect at the time the batch job began execution.

       The options processed by the <u>qalter</u> utility are identical to those  of  the  <u>qsub</u>  utility,  with  a  few
       exceptions:  <b>-V</b>,  <b>-v</b>, and <b>-q</b>.  The <b>-V</b> and <b>-v</b> are inappropriate for the <u>qalter</u> utility, since they capture
       potentially transient environment information from the submitting process. The <b>-q</b> option would specify  a
       new  queue,  which would largely negate the previously stated advantage of using <u>qalter</u>; furthermore, the
       <u>qmove</u> utility provides a superior means of moving jobs.

       Each of the following paragraphs provides the rationale for a <u>qalter</u> option.

       Additional rationale concerning these options can be found in the rationale for the <u>qsub</u> utility.

       The <b>-a</b> option allows users to alter the date and time at which a batch job becomes eligible to run.

       The <b>-A</b> option allows users to change the account that will be charged for the resources consumed  by  the
       batch  job.  Support for the <b>-A</b> option is mandatory for conforming implementations of <u>qalter</u>, even though
       support of accounting is optional for servers. Whether or not  to  support  accounting  is  left  to  the
       implementor of the server, but mandatory support of the <b>-A</b> option assures users of a consistent interface
       and allows them to control accounting on servers that support accounting.

       The  <b>-c</b>  option  allows users to alter the checkpointing interval of a batch job. A checkpointing system,
       which is not defined by POSIX.1‐2008, allows recovery of a batch job at the most recent checkpoint in the
       event of a crash. Checkpointing is typically used for jobs that consume expensive computing time or  must
       meet  a  critical  schedule.  Users  should  be  allowed  to  make  the  tradeoff between the overhead of
       checkpointing and the risk to the  timely  completion  of  the  batch  job;  therefore,  this  volume  of
       POSIX.1‐2017  provides  the  checkpointing  interval  option.  Support  for checkpointing is optional for
       servers.

       The <b>-e</b> option allows users to alter the name and location of the standard error stream written by a batch
       job. However, the path of the standard error  stream  is  meaningless  if  the  value  of  the  <u>Join_Path</u>
       attribute of the batch job is TRUE.

       The <b>-h</b> option allows users to set the hold type in the <u>Hold_Types</u> attribute of a batch job. The <u>qhold</u> and
       <u>qrls</u> utilities add or remove hold types to the <u>Hold_Types</u> attribute, respectively. The <b>-h</b> option has been
       modified to allow for implementation-defined hold types.

       The  <b>-j</b>  option allows users to alter the decision to join (merge) the standard error stream of the batch
       job with the standard output stream of the batch job.

       The <b>-l</b> option allows users to change the resource limits imposed on a batch job.

       The <b>-m</b> option allows users to modify the list of points  in  the  life  of  a  batch  job  at  which  the
       designated users will receive mail notification.

       The  <b>-M</b>  option allows users to alter the list of users who will receive notification about events in the
       life of a batch job.

       The <b>-N</b> option allows users to change the name of a batch job.

       The <b>-o</b> option allows users to alter the name and path to which the standard output stream  of  the  batch
       job will be written.

       The  <b>-P</b>  option  allows users to modify the priority of a batch job. Support for priority is optional for
       batch servers.

       The <b>-r</b> option allows users to alter the rerunability status of a batch job.

       The <b>-S</b> option allows users to change the name and location of the shell image that  will  be  invoked  to
       interpret  the  script  of the batch job. This option has been modified to allow a list of shell name and
       locations associated with different hosts.

       The <b>-u</b> option allows users to change the user identifier under which the batch job will execute.

       The <u>job_identifier</u> operand syntax is provided so that the user can differentiate between the  originating
       and  destination  (or executing) batch server. These may or may not be the same. The .<u>server_name</u> portion
       identifies the originating batch server, while the  @<u>server</u>  portion  identifies  the  destination  batch
       server.

       Historically,  the  <u>qalter</u> utility has been a component of the Network Queuing System (NQS), the existing
       practice from which this utility has been derived.
