</pre><h4><b>PROLOG</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       qrls — release batch jobs

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       qrls <b>[</b>-h <u>hold_list</u><b>]</b> <u>job_identifier</u>...

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       A  batch  job  might have one or more holds, which prevent the batch job from executing. A batch job from
       which all the holds have been removed becomes eligible for execution and is said to have been released. A
       batch job hold is removed by sending a request to the batch server that manages the batch job.  The  <u>qrls</u>
       utility  is  a  user-accessible  client of batch services that requests holds be removed from one or more
       batch jobs.

       The <u>qrls</u> utility shall remove one or more holds from those batch jobs for which a batch <u>job_identifier</u> is
       presented to the utility.

       The <u>qrls</u> utility shall remove holds from batch jobs in the order in which their batch <u>job_identifier</u>s are
       presented to the utility.

       If the <u>qrls</u> utility fails to process a batch <u>job_identifier</u> successfully, the utility  shall  proceed  to
       process the remaining batch <u>job_identifier</u>s, if any.

       The  <u>qrls</u>  utility  shall  remove  holds  on each batch job by sending a <u>Release</u> <u>Job</u> <u>Request</u> to the batch
       server that manages the batch job.

       The <u>qrls</u> utility shall not exit until the holds have been removed from the  batch  job  corresponding  to
       each successfully processed batch <u>job_identifier</u>.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>qrls</u>  utility  shall  conform  to the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <u>Section</u> <u>12.2</u>, <u>Utility</u>
       <u>Syntax</u> <u>Guidelines</u>.

       The following option shall be supported by the implementation:

       <b>-h</b> <u>hold_list</u>
                 Define the types of holds to be removed from the batch job.

                 The <u>qrls</u> <b>-h</b> option shall accept a value for the <u>hold_list</u> option-argument that is a  string  of
                 alphanumeric  characters  in  the  portable  character  set (see the Base Definitions volume of
                 POSIX.1‐2017, <u>Section</u> <u>6.1</u>, <u>Portable</u> <u>Character</u> <u>Set</u>).

                 The <u>qrls</u> utility shall accept a value for the <u>hold_list</u> option-argument that is a string of one
                 or more of the characters <b>'u'</b>, <b>'s'</b>, or <b>'o'</b>, or the single character <b>'n'</b>.

                 For each unique character in the <u>hold_list</u> option-argument, the <u>qrls</u> utility shall add a  value
                 to  the  <u>Hold_Types</u>  attribute  of the batch job as follows, each representing a different hold
                 type:

                 u     USER

                 s     SYSTEM

                 o     OPERATOR

                 If any of these characters are duplicated in  the  <u>hold_list</u>  option-argument,  the  duplicates
                 shall be ignored.

                 An existing <u>Hold_Types</u> attribute can be cleared by the following hold type:

                 n     NO_HOLD

                 The  <u>qrls</u>  utility  shall consider it an error if any hold type other than <b>'n'</b> is combined with
                 hold type <b>'n'</b>.

                 Strictly conforming applications shall not repeat any of the characters <b>'u'</b>, <b>'s'</b>, <b>'o'</b>,  or  <b>'n'</b>
                 within  the  <u>hold_list</u>  option-argument.  The  <u>qrls</u>  utility  shall  permit  the  repetition of
                 characters, but shall not assign additional meaning to the repeated characters.

                 An implementation may define other hold types. The conformance document for  an  implementation
                 shall  describe any additional hold types, how they are specified, their internal behavior, and
                 how they affect the behavior of the utility.

                 If the <b>-h</b> option is not presented to the <u>qrls</u> utility, the implementation shall remove the USER
                 hold in the <u>Hold_Types</u> attribute.

</pre><h4><b>OPERANDS</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>qrls</u> utility shall accept one or more operands that conform to the syntax for a batch  <u>job_identifier</u>
       (see <u>Section</u> <u>3.3.1</u>, <u>Batch</u> <u>Job</u> <u>Identifier</u>).

</pre><h4><b>STDIN</b></h4><pre>
       Not used.

</pre><h4><b>INPUT</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of <u>qrls</u>:

       <u>LANG</u>      Provide a default value for the internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See the
                 Base  Definitions  volume  of  POSIX.1‐2017,  <u>Section</u>  <u>8.2</u>,  <u>Internationalization</u> <u>Variables</u> the
                 precedence  of  internationalization  variables  used  to  determine  the  values   of   locale
                 categories.)

       <u>LC_ALL</u>    If  set  to a non-empty string value, override the values of all the other internationalization
                 variables.

       <u>LC_CTYPE</u>  Determine the locale for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of text  data  as  characters
                 (for example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments).

       <u>LC_MESSAGES</u>
                 Determine  the  locale  that  should  be  used  to affect the format and contents of diagnostic
                 messages written to standard error.

       <u>LOGNAME</u>   Determine the login name of the user.

</pre><h4><b>ASYNCHRONOUS</b> <b>EVENTS</b></h4><pre>
       Default.

</pre><h4><b>STDOUT</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>STDERR</b></h4><pre>
       The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.

</pre><h4><b>OUTPUT</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>EXTENDED</b> <b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       The following exit values shall be returned:

        0    Successful completion.

       &gt;0    An error occurred.

</pre><h4><b>CONSEQUENCES</b> <b>OF</b> <b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       In addition to the default behavior, the <u>qrls</u> utility shall not be required to write a diagnostic message
       to standard error  when  the  error  reply  received  from  a  batch  server  indicates  that  the  batch
       <u>job_identifier</u>  does  not  exist  on  the  server.  Whether  or  not the <u>qrls</u> utility waits to output the
       diagnostic message while attempting to locate the job on other servers is implementation-defined.

       <u>The</u> <u>following</u> <u>sections</u> <u>are</u> <u>informative.</u>

</pre><h4><b>APPLICATION</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>RATIONALE</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>qrls</u> utility allows users, operators, and administrators to remove holds from jobs.

       The <u>qrls</u> utility does not support any job selection options or wildcard arguments. Users  may  acquire  a
       list  of  jobs  selected by attributes using the <u>qselect</u> utility. For example, a user could select all of
       their held jobs.

       The <b>-h</b> option allows the user to specify the type of hold that is to be removed. This option  allows  for
       USER,  SYSTEM,  OPERATOR,  and implementation-defined hold types. The batch server that manages the batch
       job will verify whether the user is authorized to remove the specified hold for the batch  job.  If  more
       than one type of hold has been placed on the batch job, a user may wish to remove only some of them.

       Mail  is  not  required  on  release  because the administrator has the tools and libraries to build this
       option if required.

       The <u>qrls</u> utility is a new utility <u>vis-a-vis</u> existing practice; it has been  defined  in  this  volume  of
       POSIX.1‐2017 as the natural complement to the <u>qhold</u> utility.

</pre><h4><b>FUTURE</b> <b>DIRECTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>qrls</u> utility may be removed in a future version.
