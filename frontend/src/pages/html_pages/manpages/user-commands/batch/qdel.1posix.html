</pre><h4><b>PROLOG</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       qdel — delete batch jobs

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       qdel <u>job_identifier</u>...

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       A  batch  job is deleted by sending a request to the batch server that manages the batch job. A batch job
       that has been deleted is no longer subject to management by batch services.

       The <u>qdel</u> utility is a user-accessible client of batch services that requests the deletion of one or  more
       batch jobs.

       The <u>qdel</u> utility shall request a batch server to delete those batch jobs for which a batch <u>job_identifier</u>
       is presented to the utility.

       The  <u>qdel</u> utility shall delete batch jobs in the order in which their batch <u>job_identifier</u>s are presented
       to the utility.

       If the <u>qdel</u> utility fails to process any batch <u>job_identifier</u> successfully, the utility shall proceed  to
       process the remaining batch <u>job_identifier</u>s, if any.

       The  <u>qdel</u>  utility  shall  delete each batch job by sending a <u>Delete</u> <u>Job</u> <u>Request</u> to the batch server that
       manages the batch job.

       The <u>qdel</u> utility shall not exit until the batch job corresponding to each  successfully  processed  batch
       <u>job_identifier</u> has been deleted.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>OPERANDS</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>qdel</u> utility shall accept one or more operands that conform to the syntax for a batch <u>job_identifier</u>
       (see <u>Section</u> <u>3.3.1</u>, <u>Batch</u> <u>Job</u> <u>Identifier</u>).

</pre><h4><b>STDIN</b></h4><pre>
       Not used.

</pre><h4><b>INPUT</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of <u>qdel</u>:

       <u>LANG</u>      Provide a default value for the internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See the
                 Base Definitions volume  of  POSIX.1‐2017,  <u>Section</u>  <u>8.2</u>,  <u>Internationalization</u>  <u>Variables</u>  the
                 precedence   of   internationalization  variables  used  to  determine  the  values  of  locale
                 categories.)

       <u>LC_ALL</u>    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values of all the  other  internationalization
                 variables.

       <u>LC_CTYPE</u>  Determine  the  locale  for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of text data as characters
                 (for example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments).

       <u>LC_MESSAGES</u>
                 Determine the locale that should be used to  affect  the  format  and  contents  of  diagnostic
                 messages written to standard error.

       <u>LOGNAME</u>   Determine the login name of the user.

</pre><h4><b>ASYNCHRONOUS</b> <b>EVENTS</b></h4><pre>
       Default.

</pre><h4><b>STDOUT</b></h4><pre>
       An implementation of the <u>qdel</u> utility may write informative messages to standard output.

</pre><h4><b>STDERR</b></h4><pre>
       The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.

</pre><h4><b>OUTPUT</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>EXTENDED</b> <b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       The following exit values shall be returned:

        0    Successful completion.

       &gt;0    An error occurred.

</pre><h4><b>CONSEQUENCES</b> <b>OF</b> <b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       In addition to the default behavior, the <u>qdel</u> utility shall not be required to write a diagnostic message
       to  standard  error  when  the  error  reply  received  from  a  batch  server  indicates  that the batch
       <u>job_identifier</u> does not exist on the server. Whether  or  not  the  <u>qdel</u>  utility  waits  to  output  the
       diagnostic message while attempting to locate the job on other servers is implementation-defined.

       <u>The</u> <u>following</u> <u>sections</u> <u>are</u> <u>informative.</u>

</pre><h4><b>APPLICATION</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>RATIONALE</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>qdel</u> utility allows users and administrators to delete jobs.

       The <u>qdel</u> utility provides functionality that is not otherwise available. For example, the <u>kill</u> utility of
       the operating system does not suffice. First, to use the <u>kill</u> utility, the user might have to log in on a
       remote  node,  because  the  <u>kill</u>  utility does not operate across the network. Second, unlike <u>qdel</u>, <u>kill</u>
       cannot remove jobs from queues. Lastly, the arguments of the <u>qdel</u> utility are job identifiers rather than
       process identifiers, and so this utility can be passed the output of the <u>qselect</u> utility, thus  providing
       users with a means of deleting a list of jobs.

       Because  a  set  of  jobs  can  be  selected  using  the  <u>qselect</u>  utility, the <u>qdel</u> utility has not been
       complicated with options that provide for selection of jobs. Instead, the batch jobs to  be  deleted  are
       identified individually by their job identifiers.

       Historically,  the  <u>qdel</u> utility has been a component of NQS, the existing practice on which it is based.
       However, the <u>qdel</u> utility defined in  this  volume  of  POSIX.1‐2017  does  not  provide  an  option  for
       specifying  a signal number to send to the batch job prior to the killing of the process; that capability
       has been subsumed by the <u>qsig</u> utility.

       A discussion was held about the delays of networking and the possibility that the batch server may  never
       respond,  due  to a down router, down batch server, or other network mishap. The DESCRIPTION records this
       under the words ``fails to process any job identifier''.  In the broad sense, the network problem is also
       an error, which causes the failure to process the batch job identifier.

</pre><h4><b>FUTURE</b> <b>DIRECTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>qdel</u> utility may be removed in a future version.
