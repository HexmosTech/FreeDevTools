</pre><h4><b>PROLOG</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       batch — schedule commands to be executed in a batch queue

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>batch</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>batch</u>  utility  shall  read  commands from standard input and schedule them for execution in a batch
       queue. It shall be the equivalent of the command:

           at -q b -m now

       where queue <u>b</u> is a special <u>at</u> queue, specifically for batch jobs. Batch jobs shall be  submitted  to  the
       batch  queue  with  no  time  constraints  and  shall  be  run  by  the system using algorithms, based on
       unspecified factors, that may vary with each invocation of <u>batch</u>.

       Users shall be permitted to use <u>batch</u> if their name appears in the file <b>at.allow</b> which is located  in  an
       implementation-defined  directory.  If that file does not exist, the file <b>at.deny</b>, which is located in an
       implementation-defined directory, shall be checked to determine whether the user shall be  denied  access
       to  <u>batch</u>.  If neither file exists, only a process with appropriate privileges shall be allowed to submit
       a job. If only <b>at.deny</b> exists and is empty, global usage shall be permitted.  The  <b>at.allow</b>  and  <b>at.deny</b>
       files shall consist of one user name per line.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>OPERANDS</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>STDIN</b></h4><pre>
       The  standard  input shall be a text file consisting of commands acceptable to the shell command language
       described in <u>Chapter</u> <u>2</u>, <u>Shell</u> <u>Command</u> <u>Language</u>.

</pre><h4><b>INPUT</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       The text files <b>at.allow</b> and <b>at.deny</b>, which are located  in  an  implementation-defined  directory,  shall
       contain  zero  or  more  user  names,  one per line, of users who are, respectively, authorized or denied
       access to the <u>at</u> and <u>batch</u> utilities.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of <u>batch</u>:

       <u>LANG</u>      Provide a default value for the internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See the
                 Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <u>Section</u> <u>8.2</u>, <u>Internationalization</u>  <u>Variables</u>  for  the
                 precedence   of   internationalization  variables  used  to  determine  the  values  of  locale
                 categories.)

       <u>LC_ALL</u>    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values of all the  other  internationalization
                 variables.

       <u>LC_CTYPE</u>  Determine  the  locale  for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of text data as characters
                 (for example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments and input files).

       <u>LC_MESSAGES</u>
                 Determine the locale that should be used to  affect  the  format  and  contents  of  diagnostic
                 messages written to standard error and informative messages written to standard output.

       <u>LC_TIME</u>   Determine the format and contents for date and time strings written by <u>batch</u>.

       <u>NLSPATH</u>   Determine the location of message catalogs for the processing of <u>LC_MESSAGES</u>.

       <u>SHELL</u>     Determine the name of a command interpreter to be used to invoke the at-job. If the variable is
                 unset  or  null,  <u>sh</u>  shall  be  used.  If  it  is set to a value other than a name for <u>sh</u>, the
                 implementation shall do one of the following: use that shell; use <u>sh</u>; use the login shell  from
                 the  user  database;  any  of the preceding accompanied by a warning diagnostic about which was
                 chosen.

       <u>TZ</u>        Determine the timezone. The job shall be submitted for  execution  at  the  time  specified  by
                 <u>timespec</u>  or  <b>-t</b>  <u>time</u>  relative  to  the  timezone  specified  by the <u>TZ</u> variable. If <u>timespec</u>
                 specifies a timezone, it overrides <u>TZ</u>.  If <u>timespec</u> does not specify a timezone and <u>TZ</u> is unset
                 or null, an unspecified default timezone shall be used.

</pre><h4><b>ASYNCHRONOUS</b> <b>EVENTS</b></h4><pre>
       Default.

</pre><h4><b>STDOUT</b></h4><pre>
       When standard input is a terminal, prompts of  unspecified  format  for  each  line  of  the  user  input
       described in the STDIN section may be written to standard output.

</pre><h4><b>STDERR</b></h4><pre>
       The following shall be written to standard error when a job has been successfully submitted:

           "job %s at %s\n", <u>at_job_id</u>, &lt;<u>date</u>&gt;

       where <u>date</u> shall be equivalent in format to the output of:

           date +"%a %b %e %T %Y"

       The  date  and  time  written  shall  be  adjusted  so  that  they appear in the timezone of the user (as
       determined by the <u>TZ</u> variable).

       Neither this, nor warning messages concerning the selection of the command interpreter, are considered  a
       diagnostic that changes the exit status.

       Diagnostic messages, if any, shall be written to standard error.

</pre><h4><b>OUTPUT</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>EXTENDED</b> <b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       The following exit values shall be returned:

        0    Successful completion.

       &gt;0    An error occurred.

</pre><h4><b>CONSEQUENCES</b> <b>OF</b> <b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       The job shall not be scheduled.

       <u>The</u> <u>following</u> <u>sections</u> <u>are</u> <u>informative.</u>

</pre><h4><b>APPLICATION</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       It may be useful to redirect standard output within the specified commands.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
        1. This sequence can be used at a terminal:

               batch
               sort &lt; file &gt;outfile
               EOT

        2. This  sequence,  which  demonstrates  redirecting  standard  error  to a pipe, is useful in a command
           procedure (the sequence of output redirection specifications is significant):

               batch &lt;&lt;!
               diff file1 file2 2&gt;&amp;1 &gt;outfile | mailx mygroup
               !

</pre><h4><b>RATIONALE</b></h4><pre>
       Early proposals described <u>batch</u> in a manner totally separated from <u>at</u>, even though the  historical  model
       treated  it  almost  as  a synonym for <u>at</u> <b>-qb</b>.  A number of features were added to list and control batch
       work separately from those in <u>at</u>.  Upon further reflection, it was decided that the benefit of  this  did
       not merit the change to the historical interface.

       The <b>-m</b> option was included on the equivalent <u>at</u> command because it is historical practice to mail results
       to  the  submitter,  even if all job-produced output is redirected. As explained in the RATIONALE for <u>at</u>,
       the <b>now</b> keyword submits  the  job  for  immediate  execution  (after  scheduling  delays),  despite  some
       historical systems where <u>at</u> <b>now</b> would have been considered an error.

</pre><h4><b>FUTURE</b> <b>DIRECTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       None.
