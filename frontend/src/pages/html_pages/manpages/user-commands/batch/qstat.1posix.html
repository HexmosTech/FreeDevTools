</pre><h4><b>PROLOG</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       qstat — show status of batch jobs

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       qstat <b>[</b>-f<b>]</b> <u>job_identifier</u>...

       qstat -Q <b>[</b>-f<b>]</b> <u>destination</u>...

       qstat -B <b>[</b>-f<b>]</b> <u>server_name</u>...

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The status of a batch job, batch queue, or batch server is obtained by a request to the server. The <u>qstat</u>
       utility  is  a  user-accessible  batch  client  that requests the status of one or more batch jobs, batch
       queues, or servers, and writes the status information to standard output.

       For each successfully processed batch <u>job_identifier</u>, the <u>qstat</u> utility shall display  information  about
       the corresponding batch job.

       For  each  successfully  processed  destination,  the  <u>qstat</u>  utility shall display information about the
       corresponding batch queue.

       For each successfully processed server name, the  <u>qstat</u>  utility  shall  display  information  about  the
       corresponding server.

       The  <u>qstat</u>  utility shall acquire batch job status information by sending a <u>Job</u> <u>Status</u> <u>Request</u> to a batch
       server. The <u>qstat</u> utility shall acquire batch queue status information by sending a <u>Queue</u> <u>Status</u>  <u>Request</u>
       to  a  batch server. The <u>qstat</u> utility shall acquire server status information by sending a <u>Server</u> <u>Status</u>
       <u>Request</u> to a batch server.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>qstat</u> utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of  POSIX.1‐2017,  <u>Section</u>  <u>12.2</u>,  <u>Utility</u>
       <u>Syntax</u> <u>Guidelines</u>.

       The following options shall be supported by the implementation:

       <b>-f</b>        Specify that a full display is produced.

                 The minimum contents of a full display are specified in the STDOUT section.

                 Additional contents and format of a full display are implementation-defined.

       <b>-Q</b>        Specify that the operand is a destination.

                 The  <u>qstat</u>  utility  shall  display  information  about  each  batch  queue at each destination
                 identified as an operand.

       <b>-B</b>        Specify that the operand is a server name.

                 The <u>qstat</u> utility shall display information about each server identified as an operand.

</pre><h4><b>OPERANDS</b></h4><pre>
       If the <b>-Q</b> option is presented to the <u>qstat</u> utility, the utility shall accept one or  more  operands  that
       conform to the syntax for a destination (see <u>Section</u> <u>3.3.2</u>, <u>Destination</u>).

       If  the  <b>-B</b>  option  is  presented to the <u>qstat</u> utility, the utility shall accept one or more <u>server_name</u>
       operands.

       If neither the <b>-B</b> nor the <b>-Q</b> option is presented to the <u>qstat</u> utility, the utility shall  accept  one  or
       more  operands  that  conform  to  the  syntax  for  a batch <u>job_identifier</u> (see <u>Section</u> <u>3.3.1</u>, <u>Batch</u> <u>Job</u>
       <u>Identifier</u>).

</pre><h4><b>STDIN</b></h4><pre>
       Not used.

</pre><h4><b>INPUT</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of <u>qstat</u>:

       <u>HOME</u>      Determine the pathname of the user's home directory.

       <u>LANG</u>      Provide a default value for the internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See the
                 Base Definitions volume  of  POSIX.1‐2017,  <u>Section</u>  <u>8.2</u>,  <u>Internationalization</u>  <u>Variables</u>  the
                 precedence   of   internationalization  variables  used  to  determine  the  values  of  locale
                 categories.)

       <u>LC_ALL</u>    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values of all the  other  internationalization
                 variables.

       <u>LC_COLLATE</u>
                 Determine  the  locale  for  the  behavior  of ranges, equivalence classes, and multi-character
                 collating elements within regular expressions.

       <u>LC_CTYPE</u>  Determine the locale for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of text  data  as  characters
                 (for example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments).

       <u>LC_MESSAGES</u>
                 Determine  the  locale  that  should  be  used  to affect the format and contents of diagnostic
                 messages written to standard error.

       <u>LC_NUMERIC</u>
                 Determine the locale for  selecting  the  radix  character  used  when  writing  floating-point
                 formatted output.

       If  an  operand  presented  to  the  <u>qstat</u>  utility  is  a  batch <u>job_identifier</u> and the <b>-f</b> option is not

       If an operand presented to the <u>qstat</u> utility is a destination, the <b>-Q</b> option is  specified,  and  the  <b>-f</b>
       option  is  not  specified,  the <u>qstat</u> utility shall display the following items on a single line, in the

        *  The maximum number of batch jobs that shall be run in the batch queue concurrently

        *  The total number of batch jobs in the batch queue

        *  For each state, the number of batch jobs in that state in the batch queue and the name of the state

        *  The type of batch queue (execution or routing)

       If the operands presented to the <u>qstat</u> utility are destinations, the <b>-Q</b> option is specified, and  the  <b>-f</b>
       option  is specified, the <u>qstat</u> utility shall display the following items for each successfully processed
       operand:

       If the operands presented to the <u>qstat</u> utility are batch server names, the <b>-B</b> option  is  specified,  and
       the  <b>-f</b> option is not specified, the <u>qstat</u> utility shall display the following items on a single line, in
       the stated order, with white space between each item, for each successfully processed operand:

</pre><h4><b>STDERR</b></h4><pre>
       The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.

</pre><h4><b>OUTPUT</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>EXTENDED</b> <b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       The following exit values shall be returned:

        0    Successful completion.

       &gt;0    An error occurred.

</pre><h4><b>CONSEQUENCES</b> <b>OF</b> <b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       In addition to the default behavior, the <u>qstat</u> utility shall  not  be  required  to  write  a  diagnostic
       message  to  standard  error  when  the error reply received from a batch server indicates that the batch
       <u>job_identifier</u> does not exist on the server. Whether or  not  the  <u>qstat</u>  utility  waits  to  output  the
       diagnostic message while attempting to locate the batch job on other servers is implementation-defined.

       <u>The</u> <u>following</u> <u>sections</u> <u>are</u> <u>informative.</u>

</pre><h4><b>APPLICATION</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>RATIONALE</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>qstat</u> utility allows users to display the status of jobs and list the batch jobs in queues.

       The  operands  of  the  <u>qstat</u>  utility  may  be  either job identifiers, queues (specified as destination
       identifiers), or batch server names. The <b>-Q</b> and <b>-B</b> options, or absence thereof, indicate  the  nature  of
       the operands.

       The  other options of the <u>qstat</u> utility allow the user to control the amount of information displayed and
       the format in which it is displayed. Should a user wish to display the status of a set of jobs that match
       a selection criteria, the <u>qselect</u> utility may be used to acquire such a list.

       The <b>-f</b> option allows users to request a ``full'' display in an implementation-defined format.

       Historically, the <u>qstat</u> utility has been a part of the NQS and its derivatives, the existing practice  on
       which it is based.

</pre><h4><b>FUTURE</b> <b>DIRECTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>qstat</u> utility may be removed in a future version.
