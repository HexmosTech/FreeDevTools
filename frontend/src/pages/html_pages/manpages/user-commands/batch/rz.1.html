</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       rx, rb, rz - XMODEM, YMODEM, ZMODEM (Batch) file receive

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>rz</b> [- <b>+8abeOpqRtTuUvy</b>]
       <b>rb</b> [- <b>+abqRtuUvy</b>]
       <b>rx</b> [- <b>abceqRtuUv</b>] <u>file</u>
       [<b>-</b>][<b>v</b>]<b>rzCOMMAND</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This  program  uses error correcting protocols to receive files over a dial-in serial port from a variety
       of programs running under PC-DOS, CP/M, Unix, and other operating systems.  It is invoked  from  a  shell
       prompt manually, or automatically as a result of an "sz file ..." command given to the calling program.

       While <u>rz</u> is smart enough to be called from <u><a href="../man1/cu.1.html">cu</a>(1),</u> very few versions of <u><a href="../man1/cu.1.html">cu</a>(1)</u> are smart enough to allow <u>rz</u>
       to work properly.  Unix flavors of Professional-YAM are available for such dial-out application.

       <b>Rz</b> (Receive ZMODEM) receives files with the ZMODEM batch protocol.  Pathnames are supplied by the sending
       program,  and  directories  are  made  if  necessary  (and  possible).   Normally,  the  "rz"  command is
       automatically issued by the calling ZMODEM program, but some defective ZMODEM implementations may require
       starting <u>rz</u> the old fashioned way.

       <b>Rb</b> receives file(s) with YMODEM, accepting either standard 128 byte sectors or 1024 byte sectors (YAM  sb
       <b>-k</b>  option).   The  user  should  determine  when the 1024 byte block length actually improves throughput
       without causing lost data or even system crashes.

       If True YMODEM (Omen Technology trademark) file information (file length, etc.)  is  received,  the  file
       length controls the number of bytes written to the output dataset, and the modify time and file mode (iff
       non zero) are set accordingly.

       If  no  True  YMODEM file information is received, slashes in the pathname are changed to underscore, and
       any trailing period in the pathname is eliminated.  This conversion is useful  for  files  received  from
       CP/M  systems.   With  YMODEM,  each  file name is converted to lower case unless it contains one or more
       lower case letters.

       <b>Rx</b> receives a single <u>file</u> with XMODEM or XMODEM-1k protocol.  The user should  determine  when  the  1024
       byte  block  length actually improves throughput without causing problems.  The user must supply the file
       name to both sending and receiving programs.  Up to 1023 garbage characters may be added to the  received
       file.

       <b>Rz</b>  may be invoked as <b>rzCOMMAND</b> (with an optional leading - as generated by <a href="../man1/login.1.html">login</a>(1)).  For each received
       file, <u>rz</u> will pipe the file to ``COMMAND filename'' where filename is the name of  the  transmitted  file
       with the file contents as standard input.

       Each  file  transfer is acknowledged when COMMAND exits with 0 status.  A non zero exit status terminates
       transfers.

       A typical use for this form is <u>rzrmail</u> which calls <a href="../man1/rmail.1.html">rmail</a>(1) to post mail to the  user  specified  by  the
       transmitted  file  name.   For  example, sending the file "caf" from a PC-DOS system to <u>rzrmail</u> on a Unix
       system would result in the contents of the DOS file "caf" being mailed to user "caf".

       On some Unix systems, the login directory must contain a link to COMMAND as login  sets  SHELL=rsh  which
       disallows  absolute  pathnames.  If invoked with a leading ``v'', <u>rz</u> will be verbose (see <b>v</b> option).  The
       following entry works for Unix SYS III/V:
                                         rzrmail::5:1::<a href="file:/bin">/bin</a>:/usr/local/rzrmail
       If the SHELL environment variable includes <u>rsh</u> , <u>rbash</u> or <u>rksh</u> (restricted shell),  <u>rz</u>  will  not  accept
       absolute pathnames or references to a parent directory, will not modify an existing file, and removes any
       files received in error.

       If  <b>rz</b>  is  invoked  with  stdout and stderr to different datasets, Verbose is set to 2, causing frame by
       frame progress reports to stderr.  This may be disabled with the <b>q</b> option.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The meanings of the available options are:

       <b>-+,</b> <b>--append</b>
              append received data to an existing file (ZMODEM, ASCII only).
       <b>-a,</b> <b>--ascii</b>
              Convert files to Unix conventions by stripping carriage returns and all characters beginning  with
              the first Control Z (CP/M end of file).
       <b>-b,</b> <b>--binary</b>
              Binary (tell it like it is) file transfer override.
       <b>-B</b> <b>NUMBER,</b> <b>--bufsize</b> <b>NUMBER</b>
              Buffer  <b>NUMBER</b>  bytes  before  writing  to disk. Default is 32768, which should be enough for most
              situations. If you have a slow machine or a bad disk  interface  or  suffer  from  other  hardware
              problems  you  might  want  to  increase  the buffersize.  <b>-1</b> or <b>auto</b> use a buffer large enough to
              buffer the whole file. Be careful with this options - things normally get worse,  not  better,  if
              the machine starts to swap.
       <b>-c,</b> <b>--with-crc</b>
              XMODEM only. Use 16 bit CRC (normally a one byte checksum is used).
       <b>-C,</b> <b>--allow-remote-commands</b>
              allow  remote  command  execution  (  <b>insecure</b>  ).  This allows the sender to execute an arbitrary
              command through <b>system</b> () or <b>execl</b> (). Default is to disable this  feature  (?).  This  option  is
              ignored if running in restricted mode.
       <b>-D,</b> <b>--null</b>
              Output file data to /dev/null; for testing.  (Unix only)
       <b>--delay-startup</b> <b>N</b>
              Wait <b>N</b> seconds before doing anything.
       <b>-e,</b> <b>--escape</b>
              Force  sender  to  escape all control characters; normally XON, XOFF, DLE, CR-@-CR, and Ctrl-X are
              escaped.
       <b>-E,</b> <b>--rename</b>
              Rename incoming file if target filename already exists. The new file name will have a  dot  and  a
              number (0..999) appended.
       <b>-h,</b> <b>--help</b>
              give help screen.
       <b>-m</b> <b>N,</b> <b>--min-bps</b> <b>N</b>
              Stop  transmission if BPS-Rate (Bytes Per Second) falls below N for a certain time (see --min-bps-
              time option).
       <b>-M</b> <b>N,</b> <b>--min-bps-time</b>
              Used together with --min-bps. Default is 120 (seconds).
       <b>-O,</b> <b>--disable-timeouts</b>
              Disable read timeout handling code. This makes lrz hang if the sender does not send any more,  but
              increases  performance  (a  bit)  and decreases system load (through reducing the number of system
              calls by about 50 percent).

              Use this option with care.
       <b>--o-sync</b>
              Open output files in synchronous write mode. This may be useful if you experience  errors  due  to
              lost  interrupts if update (or bdflush or whoever this daemon is called on your system) writes the
              buffers to the disk.

              This option is ignored and a warning is printed if your systems doesn't support O_SYNC.
       <b>-p,</b> <b>--protect</b>
              (ZMODEM) Protect: skip file if destination file exists.
       <b>-q,</b> <b>--quiet</b>
              Quiet suppresses verbosity.
       <b>-r,</b> <b>--resume</b>
              Crash recovery mode. lrz tries to resume interrupted file transfers.
       <b>-R,</b> <b>--restricted</b>
              Enter more restricted mode. lrz will not create directories or files with a leading  dot  if  this
              option is given twice.

              See <b>SECURITY</b> for mode information about restricted mode.
       <b>-s</b> <b>HH:MM,</b> <b>--stop-at</b> <b>HH:MM</b>
              Stop  transmission  at  <b>HH</b>  hours,  <b>MM</b>  minutes. Another variant, using <b>+N</b> instead of <b>HH:MM,</b> stops
              transmission in <b>N</b> seconds.
       <b>-S,</b> <b>--timesync</b>
              Request timesync packet from the sender. The sender sends its system time, causing lrz to complain
              about more then 60 seconds difference.

              Lrz tries to set the local system time to the remote time if this  option  is  given  twice  (this
              fails if lrz is not run by root).

              This  option  makes lrz incompatible with certain other ZModems. Don't use it unless you know what
              you are doing.
       <b>--syslog[=off]</b>
              turn syslogging on or off. the default is set at configure time.  This option  is  ignored  if  no
              syslog support is compiled in.
       <b>-t</b> <b>TIM,</b> <b>--timeout</b> <b>TIM</b>
              Change  timeout to <u>TIM</u> tenths of seconds. This is ignored if timeout handling is turned of through
              the <b>O</b> option.
       <b>--tcp-client</b> <b>ADDRESS:PORT</b>
              Act as a tcp/ip client: Connect to the given port.

              See <b>--tcp-server</b> for more information.

       <b>--tcp-server</b>
              Act as a server: Open a socket, print out what to do, wait for connection.

              You will normally not want to use this option as lrzsz is the only zmodem which  understands  what
              to  do (private extension). You might want to use this if you have to use zmodem (for which reason
              whatever), and cannot use the <b>--tcp</b> option of <u>lsz</u> (perhaps because your telnet  doesn't  allow  to
              spawn a local program with stdin/stdout connected to the remote side).

              If  you use this option you have to start <u>lsz</u> with the <b>--tcp-client</b> <b>ADDRESS:PORT</b> option.  <u>lrz</u> <u>will</u>
              <u>print</u> <u>the</u> <u>address</u> <u>and</u> <u>port</u> <u>on</u> <u>startup.</u>

              Use of this option imposes a security risk, somebody else could connect to the  port  in  between.
              See <b>SECURITY</b> for details.
       <b>-U,</b> <b>--unrestrict</b>
              turn off restricted mode (this is not possible if running under a restricted shell).
       <b>--version</b>
              prints out version number.
       <b>-v,</b> <b>--verbose</b>
              Verbose causes a list of file names to be appended to stderr.  More v's generate more output.
       <b>-wN,</b> <b>--windowsize</b> <b>N</b>
              Set window size to N.
       <b>-X,</b> <b>--xmodem</b>
              use XMODEM protocol.
       <b>-y,</b> <b>--overwrite</b>
              Yes, clobber any existing files with the same name.
       <b>--ymodem</b>
              use YMODEM protocol.
       <b>-Z,</b> <b>--zmodem</b>
              use ZMODEM protocol.

</pre><h4><b>SECURITY</b></h4><pre>
       Contrary  to  the original ZMODEM lrz defaults to restricted mode. In restricted mode lrz will not accept
       absolute pathnames or references to a parent directory, will not modify an existing file, and removes any
       files received in error. Remote command execution is disabled.

       To use a more restricted mode set the environment variable <b>ZMODEM_RESTRICTED</b> or give the <b>R</b>  option.  This
       disables creation of subdirectories and invisible files.

       Restricted mode may be turned off with the <b>U</b> option, unless lrz runs under a restricted shell.

       Use of the
              <b>--tcp-client</b>  or  <b>--tcp-server</b>  options imposes a security risk, as somebody else could connect to
              the port before you do it, and grab your data. If there's strong demand for a more secure  mode  i
              might introduce some sort of password challenge.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       lrz uses the following environment variables:

       <b>SHELL</b>  lrz recognizes a restricted shell if this variable includes <u>rsh</u> or <u>rksh</u>

       <b>ZMODEM_RESTRICTED</b>
              lrz enters the more restricted mode if the variable is set.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       (Pro-YAM command)
              <u>&lt;ALT-2&gt;</u>
              Pro-YAM Command: <u>sz</u> <u>*.h</u> <u>*.c</u>
              (This automatically invokes <u>rz</u> on the connected system.)

       Compile time options required for various operating systems are described in the source file.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       Sending  serial  data  to  timesharing  minicomputers  at  sustained  high speeds has been known to cause
       lockups, system halts, kernel panics, and occasional antisocial behaviour.  When experimenting with  high
       speed  input  to  a  system,  consider  rebooting  the  system  if the file transfers are not successful,
       especially if the personality of the system appears altered.

       The Unix "ulimit" parameter must be set high enough to permit large file transfers.

       The TTY input buffering on some systems may not allow long blocks or streaming input at high speed.   You
       should  suspect  this  problem  when  you can't send data to the Unix system at high speeds using ZMODEM,
       YMODEM-1k or XMODEM-1k, when YMODEM with 128 byte blocks  works  properly.   If  the  system's  tty  line
       handling  is  really  broken,  the serial port or the entire system may not survive the onslaught of long
       bursts of high speed data.

       The DSZ or Pro-YAM <b>zmodem</b> <b>l</b> numeric parameter may be set to a value between 64  and  1024  to  limit  the
       burst length ("zmodem pl128").

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Calling <u>rz</u> from most versions of <a href="../man1/cu.1.html">cu</a>(1) doesn't work because cu's receive process fights <u>rz</u> for characters
       from the modem.

       Programs  that  do not properly implement the specified file transfer protocol may cause <u>sz</u> to "hang" the
       port for a minute or two.  Every reported instance of this problem has been  corrected  by  using  ZCOMM,
       Pro-YAM, or other program with a correct implementation of the specified protocol.

       Many  programs  claiming  to  support YMODEM only support XMODEM with 1k blocks, and they often don't get
       that quite right.

       Pathnames are restricted to 127 characters.  In XMODEM single  file  mode,  the  pathname  given  on  the
       command  line  is  still processed as described above.  The ASCII option´s CR/LF to NL translation merely
       deletes CR´s; undos(omen) performs a more intelligent translation.

</pre><h4><b>VMS</b> <b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       The VMS version does not set the file time.

       VMS C Standard I/O and RMS may interact to modify file contents unexpectedly.

       The VMS version does not support invocation as <b>rzCOMMAND</b> <b>.</b>  The current  VMS  version  does  not  support
       XMODEM, XMODEM-1k, or YMODEM.

       According to the VMS documentation, the buffered input routine used on the VMS version of <u>rz</u> introduces a
       delay  of  up  to one second for each protocol transaction.  This delay may be significant for very short
       files.  Removing the "#define BUFREAD" line from rz.c  will  eliminate  this  delay  at  the  expense  of
       increased CPU utilization.

       The  VMS  version causes DCL to generate a random off the wall error message under some error conditions;
       this is a result of the incompatibility of the VMS "exit" function with the Unix/MSDOS standard.

</pre><h4><b>ZMODEM</b> <b>CAPABILITIES</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Rz</u> supports incoming ZMODEM binary (-b),  ASCII  (-a),  protect  (-p),  clobber  (-y),  and  append  (-+)
       requests.  The default is protect (-p) and binary (-b).

       The Unix versions support ZMODEM command execution.
