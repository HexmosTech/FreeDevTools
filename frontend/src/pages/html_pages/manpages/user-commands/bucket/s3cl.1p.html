</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This program gives a command line interface to Amazons s3 storage service. It does not limit the number
       of requests (which may cost you more money than if you did it a different way!) and each request costs
       Money (although some costs from EC2 may be $0.0, check latest from Amazon costs page) - we take NO
       responsibility for your bill.

</pre><h4><b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>buckets</b>
           s3cl buckets

           List all buckets for this account.

       <b>mkbucket</b>
           s3cl mkbucket --bucket sombucketname [--jurisdiction [EU|US]]

           Create a new bucket, optionally specifying what jurisdiction it should be created in.

       <b>ls</b>  s3cl ls &lt;bucket&gt;:[prefix]

           List  contents  of a bucket, the optional <b>prefix</b> can be partial, in which case all keys matching this
           as the start of the key name will be returned.  If no <b>prefix</b> is supplied all keys of the bucket  will
           be returned.

       <b>cp</b>  s3cl cp &lt;bucket&gt;:&lt;key&gt; target_file

           s3cl cp &lt;bucket&gt;:&lt;key&gt; target_directory

           Copy a single key from the bucket to the target file, or into the target_directory.

       <b>sync</b>
           s3cl sync &lt;bucket&gt;:[prefix] target_dir

           Downloads all files matching the prefix into a directory structure replicating that of the prefix and
           all 'sub-directories'. It will download ALL files - even if already on your local disk:

           <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/browse.html">http://www.amazon.com/gp/browse.html</a>?node=16427261

             #  Data transfer "in" and "out" refers to transfer into and out
             #  of Amazon S3.  Data transferred between Amazon EC2 and
             #  Amazon S3, is free of charge (i.e., $0.00 per GB), except
             #  data transferred between Amazon EC2 and Amazon S3-Europe,
             #  which will be charged at regular rates.

       <b>sync_up</b>
           s3cl sync_up [--acl_short=public-read] &lt;bucket&gt;:[prefix] /path/

           Upload  all  the  files below /path/ to S3, with an optional prefix at the start of the key name. The
           existing S3 files and meta data are fetched from S3 and the md5 (etag) is compaired to what is on the
           local disk, files are not upload if the content has not changed.

           Use --acl_short to set access control, options  from  Net::Amazon::S3::Bucket#set_acl  this  is  only
           applied when the file is uploaded.

           Each  files content-type is worked out using MIME::Types, if this does not match 'text/plain' is used
           for ASCII text files, otherwise a warning is issued and the file is NOT uploaded.

           Currently this does NOT remove old files from S3, and if there is any  change  to  a  file  then  the
           entire file will be reuploaded.

       <b>rm</b>  s3cl rm &lt;bucket&gt;:&lt;key&gt;

           Remove  a  key(file)  from  the bucket, removing a non-existent file is not classed as an error. Once
           removed the key (file) can not be restored - so use with care!
