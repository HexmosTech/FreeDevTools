</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       s3ls - List S3 buckets and bucket contents

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       s3ls [options]

       s3ls [options] [ [ bucket | bucket/item ] ...]

        Options:
          --access-key    AWS Access Key ID
          --secret-key    AWS Secret Access Key
          --long
        Environment:
          AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
          AWS_ACCESS_KEY_SECRET

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--help</b>  Print a brief help message and exits.

       <b>--man</b>   Prints the manual page and exits.

       <b>--verbose</b>
               Output what is being done as it is done.

       <b>--access-key</b> and <b>--secret-key</b>
               Specify  the  "AWS  Access Key Identifiers" for the AWS account.  <b>--access-key</b> is the "Access Key
               ID", and <b>--secret-key</b> is the "Secret Access Key".   These  are  effectively  the  "username"  and
               "password" to the AWS account, and should be kept confidential.

               The  access  keys  MUST  be  specified,  either  via  these  command  line parameters, or via the
               <b>AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID</b> and <b>AWS_ACCESS_KEY_SECRET</b> environment variables.

               Specifying them on the command line overrides the environment variables.

       <b>--secure</b>
               Uses SSL/TLS HTTPS to communicate with the AWS service, instead of HTTP.

       <b>--long</b>

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID</b> and <b>AWS_ACCESS_KEY_SECRET</b>
               Specify the "AWS Access Key Identifiers" for the AWS  account.   <b>AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID</b>  contains  the
               "Access  Key  ID",  and  <b>AWS_ACCESS_KEY_SECRET</b>  contains  the  "Secret  Access  Key".   These are
               effectively the "username" and "password" to the AWS service, and should be kept confidential.

               The access  keys  MUST  be  specified,  either  via  these  environment  variables,  or  via  the
               <b>--access-key</b> and <b>--secret-key</b> command line parameters.

               If the command line parameters are set, they override these environment variables.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>FILE</b></h4><pre>
       The  configuration options will be read from the file "<a href="file:~/.s3-tools">~/.s3-tools</a>" if it exists.  The format is the same
       as the command line options with one option per line.  For example, the file could contain:

           --access-key &lt;AWS access key&gt;
           --secret-key &lt;AWS secret key&gt;
           --secure

       This example configuration file would specify the AWS access keys and  that  a  secure  connection  using
       HTTPS should be used for all communications.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Lists  the  buckets  owned  by the user, or all the item keys in a given bucket, or attributes associated
       with a given item.

       If no buckets or bucket/itemkey is specified on the command line, all the buckets owned by the  user  are
       listed.

       If the "--long" option is specified, the creation date of each bucket is also output.

       If a bucket name is specified on the command line, all the item keys in that bucket are listed.

       If  the "--long" option is specified, the ID and display string of the item owner, the creation date, the
       MD5, and the size of the item are also output.

       If a bucket name and an item key, separated by a slash character, is specified on the command line,  then
       the bucket name and the item key are output.  This is useful to check that the item actually exists.

       If  the  "--long"  option  is  specified, all the HTTP attributes of the item are also output.  This will
       include Content-Length, Content-Type, ETag (which is the MD5 of the item contents), and Last-Modifed.

       It may also include the HTTP attributes Content-Language,  Expires,  Cache-Control,  Content-Disposition,
       and Content-Encoding.

       It will also include any x-amz- metadata headers.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Report bugs to Mark Atwood <a href="mailto:mark@fallenpegasus.com">mark@fallenpegasus.com</a>.

       Occasionally  the  S3  service  will randomly fail for no externally apparent reason.  When that happens,
       this tool should retry, with a delay and a backoff.

       Access to the S3 service can be authenticated with a X.509 certificate, instead of via  the  "AWS  Access
       Key Identifiers".  This tool should support that.

       It  might be useful to be able to specify the "AWS Access Key Identifiers" in the user's "<a href="file:~/.netrc">~/.netrc</a>" file.
       This tool should support that.

       Errors and warnings are very "Perl-ish", and can be confusing.

       Trying to access a bucket or item that does not exist or is not accessible by  the  user  generates  less
       than helpful error messages.

       This  tool does not efficiently handle listing huge buckets, as it downloads and parses the entire bucket
       listing, before it outputs anything.

       This tool does not take advantage of the prefix, delimiter, and hierarchy features  of  the  AWS  S3  key
       listing API.
