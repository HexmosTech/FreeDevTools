</pre><h4><b>PROLOG</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       ipcs — report XSI interprocess communication facilities status

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       ipcs <b>[</b>-qms<b>]</b> <b>[</b>-a|-bcopt<b>]</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>ipcs</u> utility shall write information about active interprocess communication facilities.

       Without options, information shall be written in short format for message queues, shared memory segments,
       and  semaphore sets that are currently active in the system. Otherwise, the information that is displayed
       is controlled by the options specified.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>ipcs</u> utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume  of  POSIX.1‐2017,  <u>Section</u>  <u>12.2</u>,  <u>Utility</u>
       <u>Syntax</u> <u>Guidelines</u>.

       The <u>ipcs</u> utility accepts the following options:

       <b>-q</b>        Write information about active message queues.

       <b>-m</b>        Write information about active shared memory segments.

       <b>-s</b>        Write information about active semaphore sets.

       If  <b>-q</b>,  <b>-m</b>,  or  <b>-s</b>  are specified, only information about those facilities shall be written. If none of
       these three are specified, information about all three shall be written subject to the following options:

       <b>-a</b>        Use all print options. (This is a shorthand notation for <b>-b</b>, <b>-c</b>, <b>-o</b>, <b>-p</b>, and <b>-t</b>.)

       <b>-b</b>        Write information on maximum allowable size. (Maximum number of bytes in messages on queue  for
                 message  queues,  size  of segments for shared memory, and number of semaphores in each set for
                 semaphores.)

       <b>-c</b>        Write creator's user name and group name; see below.

       <b>-o</b>        Write information on outstanding usage. (Number of messages on queue and total number of  bytes
                 in  messages  on  queue  for  message queues, and number of processes attached to shared memory
                 segments.)

       <b>-p</b>        Write process number information. (Process ID of the last process to send a message and process
                 ID of the last process to receive a message on message  queues,  process  ID  of  the  creating
                 process, and process ID of the last process to attach or detach on shared memory segments.)

       <b>-t</b>        Write time information. (Time of the last control operation that changed the access permissions
                 for  all  facilities, time of the last <u>msgsnd</u>() and <u>msgrcv</u>() operations on message queues, time
                 of the last <u>shmat</u>() and <u>shmdt</u>() operations on shared memory,  and  time  of  the  last  <u>semop</u>()
                 operation on semaphores.)

</pre><h4><b>OPERANDS</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>STDIN</b></h4><pre>
       Not used.

</pre><h4><b>INPUT</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
        *  The group database

        *  The user database

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of <u>ipcs</u>:

       <u>LANG</u>      Provide a default value for the internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See the
                 Base  Definitions  volume  of POSIX.1‐2017, <u>Section</u> <u>8.2</u>, <u>Internationalization</u> <u>Variables</u> for the
                 precedence  of  internationalization  variables  used  to  determine  the  values   of   locale
                 categories.)

       <u>LC_ALL</u>    If  set  to a non-empty string value, override the values of all the other internationalization
                 variables.

       <u>LC_CTYPE</u>  Determine the locale for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of text  data  as  characters
                 (for example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments).

       <u>LC_MESSAGES</u>
                 Determine  the  locale  that  should  be  used  to affect the format and contents of diagnostic
                 messages written to standard error.

       <u>NLSPATH</u>   Determine the location of message catalogs for the processing of <u>LC_MESSAGES</u>.

       <u>TZ</u>        Determine the timezone for the date and time strings written by <u>ipcs</u>.  If <u>TZ</u> is unset or  null,
                 an unspecified default timezone shall be used.

</pre><h4><b>ASYNCHRONOUS</b> <b>EVENTS</b></h4><pre>
       Default.

</pre><h4><b>STDOUT</b></h4><pre>
       An introductory line shall be written with the format:

           "IPC status from %s as of %s\n", &lt;<u>source</u>&gt;, &lt;<u>date</u>&gt;

       where  &lt;<u>source</u>&gt;  indicates  the  source  used to gather the statistics and &lt;<u>date</u>&gt; is the information that
       would be produced by the <u>date</u> command when invoked in the POSIX locale.

       The <u>ipcs</u> utility then shall create up to three reports depending upon the <b>-q</b>, <b>-m</b>,  and  <b>-s</b>  options.  The
       first  report shall indicate the status of message queues, the second report shall indicate the status of
       shared memory segments, and the third report shall indicate the status of semaphore sets.

       If the corresponding facility is not installed or has not been used  since  the  last  reboot,  then  the
       report shall be written out in the format:

           "%s facility not in system.\n", &lt;<u>facility</u>&gt;

       where  &lt;<u>facility</u>&gt; is <u>Message</u> <u>Queue</u>, <u>Shared</u> <u>Memory</u>, or <u>Semaphore</u>, as appropriate. If the facility has been
       installed and has been used since the last reboot, column headings  separated  by  one  or  more  &lt;space&gt;
       characters  and followed by a &lt;newline&gt; shall be written as indicated below followed by the facility name
       written out using the format:

           "%s:\n", &lt;<u>facility</u>&gt;

       where &lt;<u>facility</u>&gt; is <u>Message</u> <u>Queues</u>, <u>Shared</u> <u>Memory</u>, or <u>Semaphores</u>, as appropriate. On the second and third
       reports the column headings need not be written if the  last  column  headings  written  already  provide
       column headings for all information in that report.

       The  column  headings  provided  in  the  first  column below and the meaning of the information in those
       columns shall be given in order below; the letters in parentheses indicate the options that  shall  cause
       the  corresponding  column  to  appear; ``all'' means that the column shall always appear. Each column is
       separated by one or more &lt;space&gt; characters. Note that these options only determine what  information  is
       provided for each report; they do not determine which reports are written.

       T (all)     Type of facility:

                   q       Message queue.

                   m       Shared memory segment.

                   s       Semaphore.

                   This field is a single character written using the format <b>%c</b>.

       ID (all)    The identifier for the facility entry. This field shall be written using the format <b>%d</b>.

       KEY (all)   The key used as an argument to <u>msgget</u>(), <u>semget</u>(), or <u>shmget</u>() to create the facility entry.

                   <b>Note:</b>     The  key  of a shared memory segment is changed to IPC_PRIVATE when the segment has
                             been removed until all processes attached to the segment detach it.

                   This field shall be written using the format 0x%x.

       MODE (all)  The facility access modes and flags. The  mode  shall  consist  of  11  characters  that  are
                   interpreted as follows.

                   The first character shall be:

                   S       If a process is waiting on a <u>msgsnd</u>() operation.

                   -       If the above is not true.

                   The second character shall be:

                   R       If a process is waiting on a <u>msgrcv</u>() operation.

                   C or -  If  the  associated  shared  memory  segment  is  to be cleared when the first attach
                           operation is executed.

                   -       If none of the above is true.

                   The next nine characters shall be interpreted as three sets of three bits each. The first set
                   refers to the owner's permissions; the next to permissions of others in the usergroup of  the
                   facility  entry;  and  the last to all others. Within each set, the first character indicates
                   permission to read, the second character indicates permission to write or alter the  facility
                   entry, and the last character is a &lt;hyphen-minus&gt; (<b>'-'</b>).

                   The permissions shall be indicated as follows:

                   <u>r</u>       If read permission is granted.

                   <u>w</u>       If write permission is granted.

                   <u>a</u>       If alter permission is granted.

                   -       If the indicated permission is not granted.

                   The  first  character  following  the  permissions  specifies  if  there  is  an alternate or
                   additional access control method associated with the facility. If there is  no  alternate  or
                   additional  access  control  method  associated  with the facility, a single &lt;space&gt; shall be
                   written; otherwise, another printable character is written.

       OWNER (all) The user name of the owner of the facility entry. If the user name of the owner is  found  in
                   the  user  database,  at  least the first eight column positions of the name shall be written
                   using the format <b>%s</b>.  Otherwise, the user ID of the owner shall be written using  the  format
                   <b>%d</b>.

       GROUP (all) The group name of the owner of the facility entry. If the group name of the owner is found in
                   the  group  database,  at least the first eight column positions of the name shall be written
                   using the format <b>%s</b>.  Otherwise, the group ID of the owner shall be written using the  format
                   <b>%d</b>.
