</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       lcm_example - Example program for the LC Communications library

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>lcm_example</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>lcm_example</b>  is  an  example  program that demonstrates how to use the Lightweight Communications library
       (LC) for interprocess communications.  By itself, it's pretty useless aside  from  checking  that  LC  is
       functioning properly on a system.
