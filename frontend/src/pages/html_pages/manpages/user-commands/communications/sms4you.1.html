</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       sms4you - Personal gateway connecting SMS with XMPP or email.

       <b>sms4you</b>  forwards  messages  from  and  to  SMS and connects either with <b>sms4you-xmpp</b> or <b>sms4you-email</b> to
       choose the other mean of communication.  Nice for receiving or sending SMS, independently from carrying a
       SIM card.

</pre><h4><b>IDEA</b></h4><pre>
       Connect a <u>suitable</u> <u>GSM</u> <u>modem</u> <u>or</u> <u>phone</u> containing a SIM card into a computer (e.g. a Raspberry  Pi)  at  a
       fixed  place.  Give  <b>sms4you</b>  access to either a simple email address or a small xmpp server. It will use
       this connection to receive emails or xmpp messages to be sent out as SMS and to send out emails  or  xmpp
       messages with received SMS messages.

</pre><h4><b>CONCRETELY</b> <b>-</b> <b>WHY?</b></h4><pre>
       There can be many reasons, why you want to use <b>sms4you</b>. Here are some examples:

       • You are living in the internetz, and you just need a gateway to this old thing "SMS", which some people
         really still seem to use.

       • You  travel  and  use  local SIM cards, but you still want to be able to receive SMS confirmation codes
         from banks and services.

       • You don't want to carry a (registered) SIM card for <u>good</u> <u>reasons</u>, but still you want to be able to send
         and receive SMS.

</pre><h4><b>REQUIREMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>sms4you</b> is implemented as a <u>Python</u> daemon, using <u>Asynchronous</u> <u>I/O</u>.  For the connection with the modem  it
       uses  <u>ModemManager</u>.   The  different  gateways  for  email  and xmpp have different depenedencies and are
       wrapped therefore into different sub-projects:

</pre><h4><b>INSTALLATION</b></h4><pre>
       • As an <u>email</u> <u>gateway</u>

       • As a <u>xmpp</u> <u>gateway</u>

   <b>Run</b> <b>sms4you</b> <b>as</b> <b>unprivileged</b> <b>user</b>
          $ sudo addgroup --force-badname --system _sms4you
          $ sudo adduser --force-badname --home /nonexistent \
                --ingroup _sms4you --no-create-home --system _sms4you
          $ sudo cp sms4you.conf <a href="file:/etc/dbus-1/system.d/">/etc/dbus-1/system.d/</a>
          $ sudo cp sms4you.pkla /var/lib/polkit-1/localauthority/30-site.d/
          $ sudo chown root:_sms4you /etc/sms4you/{sim_pin,xmpp_component_password}
          $ sudo chmod 640 /etc/sms4you/{sim_pin,xmpp_component_password}
