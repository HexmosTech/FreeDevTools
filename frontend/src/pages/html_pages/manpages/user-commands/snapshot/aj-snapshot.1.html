       aj-snapshot - store and restore snapshots of JACK and/or ALSA connections

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>aj-snapshot</b> [ <b>-adfjqrx</b> ] [ <b>-p</b> <u>polling_interval</u> ] [ <b>-i</b> <u>client_name</u> ]... [ <u>FILE</u> ]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Aj-snapshot  is  a  small program that can be used to make snapshots of the connections made between JACK
       and/or ALSA clients. Because JACK can provide both audio and MIDI support to  programs,  aj-snapshot  can
       store  both  types of connections for JACK. ALSA, on the other hand, only provides routing facilities for
       MIDI clients. If you call aj-snapshot without any options, aj-snapshot will store all  current  ALSA  <b>and</b>
       JACK connections to <u>FILE</u>. The file will be an XML file, and you can use a text-editor if you want to edit
       it manually.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-a</b> , <b>--alsa</b>

              Only store or restore ALSA midi connections. Also works in daemon mode.

       <b>-d</b> , <b>--daemon</b>

              Run  aj-snapshot  in  daemon  mode. Aj-snapshot will first try to restore the connections from the
              specified snapshot file. After this, it will wait for new ports to  be  registered  with  ALSA  or
              JACK.  Every  second  by  default,  aj-snapshot will check if new ports were registered in ALSA or
              JACK. When this is the case, it will try to restore the connections from your  snapshot  file.  If
              you  start  aj-snapshot  in  daemon mode, you don't need to specify the <b>-r</b>,<b>--restore</b> flag as it is
              implied anyway.

              If you send the HUP signal to the daemon, the daemon will reload the snapshot file. This gives you
              the possibility to trigger a connections restore. For an example  on  how  to  do  this,  see  the
              EXAMPLES  section below. When you combine the daemon mode with the <b>-x</b>,<b>--remove</b> option, sending the
              HUP signal to the daemon will clear all connections before restoring.

              When the JACK server is stopped (or crashes) while aj-snapshot runs in  daemon  mode,  aj-snapshot
              will  try  to keep running. When the JACK server is started again later, aj-snapshot will reattach
              automatically and restore your connections when needed.

       <b>-f</b> , <b>--force</b>

              When you try to save a snapshot over an existing file, aj-snapshot will ask you  if  you  want  to
              overwrite that file. With this option, you can force aj-snapshot to overwrite that file.

       <b>-j</b> , <b>--jack</b>

              Only store or restore JACK audio and midi connections. Also works in daemon mode.

       <b>-p</b> <u>interval</u>, <b>--poll=</b><u>interval</u>

              Whenever  a  program  registers  a  port  with  ALSA  or  JACK,  aj-snapshot will see if there are
              connections in the snapshot file that should be  restored.  By  default,  aj-snapshot  will  check
              (poll)  if  there  are new ports every second (1000 milliseconds). With this option you can choose
              how often aj-snapshot should check for new ports. The value of <u>interval</u>  should  be  specified  in
              milliseconds.

       <b>-q</b> , <b>--quiet</b>

              Don't print any information about the connections that are stored or restored.

       <b>-r</b> , <b>--restore</b>

              When  you  specify the <b>-r</b> flag, aj-snapshot will try to restore all ALSA and JACK connections from
              <u>FILE</u>. (without it, aj-snapshot will try to <b>store</b> connections to <u>FILE</u>). You can combine this option
              with the <b>-a</b> or <b>-j</b> options, if you want to restore ALSA or JACK connections only.

       <b>-x</b> , <b>--remove</b>

              The <b>-x</b> option can be used when restoring connections, or when running in daemon  mode.  With  this
              option,  aj-snapshot will remove all existing connections before restoring the snapshot file. When
              you combine it with the <b>-a</b> or <b>-j</b> option, only the connections for the specific subsystem (ALSA  or
              JACK)  will  be removed. Without the <b>-x</b> option, aj-snapshot will try to restore connections on top
              of the connections that are already active.

              There is one more way in which you can use the <b>-x</b> option. If you call aj-snapshot without the <u>FILE</u>
              argument, you can use the <b>-x</b> option to remove all existing  ALSA  and  JACK  connections  (without
              doing anything else). As before you can combine it with the <b>-a</b> or <b>-j</b> options.

       <b>-i</b> <u>client_name</u>, <b>--ignore=</b><u>client_name</u>

              You  can use this option to specify one or more clients that should be ignored by aj-snapshot. You
              can write the name of the client after the -i option, and you may use wildcard  patterns  in  that
              string  (regular  shell  globbing).  If  that  name contains spaces, or other characters that have
              special meaning to the shell, you should put the name between single (safest) or double quotes. To
              know the name of a client, you could save a snapshot and look up the name in the snapshot file. If
              you want to ignore multiple clients, you have to repeat the <b>-i</b> option with different client  names
              (the maximum is 50 clients).

       <b>-h</b> , <b>--help</b>

              Print a short help message

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>aj-snapshot</b> <b>test.snap</b>

              Stores  a  snapshot of all current ALSA and JACK connections to a file called "test.snap". If that
              file already exists, aj-snapshot will ask you if you want to overwrite that file.

       <b>aj-snapshot</b> <b>-r</b> <b>test.snap</b>

              Restores all ALSA and JACK connections from the file "test.snap". This will leave any other active
              connections intact.

       <b>aj-snapshot</b> <b>-xr</b> <b>test.snap</b>

              Restore all ALSA and  JACK  connections  from  the  file  "test.snap",  but  remove  all  existing
              connections first.

       <b>aj-snapshot</b> <b>-a</b> <b>test.snap</b>

              Store all current ALSA connections to "test.snap".

       <b>aj-snapshot</b> <b>-rj</b> <b>test.snap</b>

              Restore  all  JACK  connections  from  "test.snap". This means that ALSA connections that might be
              stored in the file won't be restored.

       <b>aj-snapshot</b> <b>-qfj</b> <b>test.snap</b>

              Store all current JACK connections to "test.snap". Don't  print  any  info  on  standard  out  (be
              quiet), and forcibly overwrite "test.snap" if it already exists.

       <b>aj-snapshot</b> <b>-ax</b>

              Remove all ALSA connections

       <b>aj-snapshot</b> <b>-d</b> <b>test.snap</b> <b>&amp;</b>

              Run  aj-snapshot  in daemon mode and make it a background process (&amp;). Whenever a new ALSA or JACK
              client registers a port, connections from test.snap will be restored.

       <b>aj-snapshot</b> <b>-djx</b> <b>test.snap</b> <b>&amp;</b>

              Run aj-snapshot in daemon mode for the JACK connections in "test.snap". Remove all  existing  JACK
              connections whenever the connections from test.snap are restored.

       1) <b>aj-snapshot</b> <b>-d</b> <b>test.snap</b> <b>&amp;</b>
       2) <b>aj-snapshot</b> <b>-f</b> <b>test.snap</b>
       3) <b>kill</b> <b>-HUP</b> <b>$(pidof</b> <b>aj-snapshot)</b>

              1) First start up aj-snapshot in daemon mode with the file "test.snap".
              2)  After  some  connection  changes, a second instance of aj-snapshot (which is not run in daemon
              mode) overwrites that file with the new connections state.
              3) Send the HANGUP signal to the daemon to make it reload the file with the new connections  state
              (see 'man kill', and 'man pidof').
