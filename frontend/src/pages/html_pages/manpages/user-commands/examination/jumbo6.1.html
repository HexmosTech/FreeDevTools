       jumbo6 - A security assessment tool for attack vectors based on IPv6 jumbograms

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>jumbo6</b>  [<b>-i</b>  <u>INTERFACE</u>]  [-S  LINK_SRC_ADDR]  [-D  LINK-DST-ADDR]  [-s  SRC_ADDR[/LEN]] [-d DST_ADDR] [-A
       HOP_LIMIT] [-H HBH_OPT_HDR_SIZE]   [-U  DST_OPT_U_HDR_SIZE]  [-y  FRAG_SIZE]  [-u  DST_OPT_HDR_SIZE]  [-q
       IPV6_LENGTH] [-Q JUMBO_LENGTH] [-P PAYLOAD_SIZE] [-l] [-z SECONDS] [-v] [-h]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>jumbo6</b>  allows  the  assessment  of  IPv6  implementations  with  respect to attack vectors based on IPv6
       jumbograms. It is part of the SI6 Networks' IPv6 Toolkit : a  security  assessment  suite  for  the  IPv6
       protocols.

       This  tool has only one mode of operation: active mode. In active mode, the tool sends IPv6 jumbograms to
       the specified target, and informs the user of any  received  ICMPv6  error  messages  (typically  "ICMPv6
       Parameter Problem" error messages).

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>jumbo6</b>  takes  its  parameters as command-line options. Each of the options can be specified with a short
       name (one character preceded with the hyphen character, as e.g. "-i") or  with  a  long  name  (a  string
       preceded with two hyphen characters, as e.g. "--interface").

       jumbo6 supports IPv6 Extension Headers, including the IPv6 Fragmentation Header, which might be of use to
       circumvent  layer-2  filtering and/or Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS). However, IPv6 extension
       headers are not employed by default, and must be explicitly enabled with the corresponding options.

       <b>-i</b> <u>INTERFACE</u><b>,</b> <b>--interface</b> <u>INTERFACE</u>
              This option specifies the network interface that the tool will use.  If  the  destination  address
              ("-d"  option)  is a link-local address, the interface must be explicitly specified. The interface
              may also be specified along with a destination address, with the "-d" option.

       <b>-S</b> <u>SRC_LINK_ADDR</u><b>,</b> <b>--src-link-address</b> <u>SRC_LINK_ADDR</u>

              This option specifies the link-layer Source Address of the probe packets. If left unspecified, the
              link-layer Source Address of the packets is set to the real  link-layer  address  of  the  network
              interface.

       <b>-D</b> <u>DST_LINK_ADDR</u><b>,</b> <b>--dst-link-address</b> <u>DST_LINK_ADDR</u>

              This  option  specifies  the  link-layer Destination Address of the probe packets (currently, only
              Ethernet is supported). By default, the link-layer Destination Address is automatically set to the
              link-layer address of the destination host (for on-link destinations) or to the link-layer address
              of the first-hop router.

       <b>-s</b> <u>SRC_ADDR</u><b>,</b> <b>--src-address</b> <u>SRC_ADDR</u>

              This option specifies the IPv6 source address (or IPv6 prefix) to be used for the  Source  Address
              of  the  outgoing packets. If an IPv6 prefix is specified, the IPv6 Source Address of the outgoing
              packets will be randomized from that prefix.

       <b>-d</b> <u>DST_ADDR</u><b>,</b> <b>--dst-address</b> <u>DST_ADDR</u>

              This option specifies the IPv6 Destination Address of the target node. This option cannot be  left
              unspecified.

       --hop-limit, -A

              This  option specifies the Hop Limit to be used for the IPv6 packets. By default, the Hop Limit is
              randomized.

       <b>-y</b> <u>SIZE</u><b>,</b> <b>--frag-hdr</b> <u>SIZE</u>

              This option specifies that the resulting packet must be fragmented.  The  fragment  size  must  be
              specified as an argument to this option.

       <b>-u</b> <u>HDR_SIZE</u><b>,</b> <b>--dst-opt-hdr</b> <u>HDR_SIZE</u>

              This option specifies that a Destination Options header is to be included in the resulting packet.
              The  extension  header  size must be specified as an argument to this option (the header is filled
              with padding options). Multiple Destination Options headers may be specified by means of  multiple
              "-u" options.

       <b>-U</b> <u>HDR_SIZE</u><b>,</b> <b>--dst-opt-u-hdr</b> <u>HDR_SIZE</u>

              This  option specifies a Destination Options header to be included in the "unfragmentable part" of
              the resulting packet. The header size must be specified as an argument to this option (the  header
              is filled with padding options). Multiple Destination Options headers may be specified by means of
              multiple  "-U"  options. This option is only valid if the "-y" option is specified (as the concept
              of "unfragmentable part" only makes sense when fragmentation is employed).

       <b>-H</b> <u>HDR_SIZE</u><b>,</b> <b>--hbh-opt-hdr</b> <u>HDR_SIZE</u>

              This option specifies that a Hop-by-Hop Options header is to be included in the resulting  packet.
              The header size must be specified as an argument to this option (the header is filled with padding
              options). Multiple Hop-by-Hop Options headers may be specified by means of multiple "-H" options.

       --ipv6-length, -q

              This option specifies the value that the "Total Length" field of the IPv6 header should be set to.
              If  this option is left unspecified, the "Total Length" field is set to 0, as required by the IPv6
              jumbograms specification.

       --jumbo-length, -Q

              This option specifies the value to which the "Jumbo Payload Length" field  of  the  Jumbo  Payload
              option  should be set. If this option is left unspecified, the "Jumbo Payload Length" field is set
              according to the real size of the jumbo payload (see the "-p" option).

       --payload-size, -P

              This options specifies the size of the jumbo payload.  If left unspecified, the  payload  size  is
              set to 0.

       --loop, -l

              This  option  instructs  the  jumbo6 tool to send periodic IPv6 jumbograms to the victim node. The
              amount of time to pause between sending IPv6 jumbograms can be specified  by  means  of  the  "-z"
              option, and defaults to 1 second.

       --sleep, -z

              This  option  specifies  the  amount  of  time  to pause between sending IPv6 jumbograms (when the
              "--loop" option is set). If left unspecified, it defaults to 1 second.

       --verbose, -v

              This option instructs the jumbo6 tool to be verbose.  When the option is set twice,  the  tool  is
              "very  verbose",  and  the  tool  also  informs which packets have been accepted or discarded as a
              result of applying the specified filters.

       --help, -h

              Print help information for the jumbo6 tool.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       The following sections illustrate typical use cases of the <b>jumbo6</b> tool.

       <b>Example</b> <b>#1</b>

       # jumbo6 -s fc00:1::/64 -d fc00:1::1 -P 100

       Send an IPv6 jumbogram to the host fc00:1::1. The IPv6 Source Address will be randomly selected from  the
       prefix fc00:1::/64, and a the payload of 100 bytes is included in the packet.
