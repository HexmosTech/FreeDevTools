</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>udp6</b>  allows  the assessment of IPv6 implementations with respect to a variety of attack vectors based on
       UDP/IPv6 datagrams. This tool is part of the SI6  Networks'  IPv6  Toolkit:  a  security  assessment  and
       troubleshooting toolkit for the IPv6 protocols.

       <b>udp6</b>  tool  has two modes of operation: active and listening. In active mode, the tool attacks a specific
       target, while in listening mode the tool listens to UDP traffic on the local  network,  and  launches  an
       attack  in response to such traffic. Active mode is employed if an IPv6 Destination Address is specified.
       Listening mode is employed if the "-L" option (or its long counterpart "--listen") is  set.  If  both  an
       attack target and the "-L" option are specified, the attack is launched against the specified target, and
       then the tool enters listening mode to respond incoming packets with UDP datagrams.

       <b>udp6</b>  supports  filtering  of  incoming  packets  based  on  the  Ethernet  Source  Address, the Ethernet
       Destination Address, the IPv6 Source Address, and the IPv6 Destination Address.  There are two  types  of
       filters:  "block  filters"  and  "accept  filters".  If any "block filter" is specified, and the incoming
       packet matches any of those filters, the message is discarded (and thus no  UDP  datagrams  are  sent  in
       response).  If  any  "accept  filter"  is specified, incoming packets must match the specified filters in
       order for the tool to respond with UDP datagrams.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>udp6</b> takes itS parameters as command-line options. Each of the options can be specified with a short name
       (one character preceded with the hyphen character, as e.g. "-i") or with a long name (a  string  preceded
       with two hyphen characters, as e.g. "--interface").

       If  the  tool  is  instructed  to  e.g.  flood  the  victim  with  UDP  datagrams  from different sources
       ("--flood-sources" option), multiple packets may need to be generated.

       udp6 supports IPv6 Extension Headers, including the IPv6 Fragmentation Header, which might be of  use  to
       circumvent  layer-2  filtering and/or Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS). However, IPv6 extension
       headers are not employed by default, and must be explicitly enabled with the corresponding options.

       <b>-i</b> <u>INTERFACE</u><b>,</b> <b>--interface</b> <u>INTERFACE</u>
              This option specifies the network interface that the tool will use. The network interface must  be
              specified (i.e., the tool does not select any network interface "by default").

       <b>-S</b> <u>SRC_LINK_ADDR</u><b>,</b> <b>--src-link-address</b> <u>SRC_LINK_ADDR</u>

              This option specifies the link-layer Source Address of the probe packets. If left unspecified, the
              link-layer  Source  Address  of  the  packets is set to the real link-layer address of the network
              interface. Note: this option is meaningful only  when  the  underlying  link-layer  technology  is
              Ethernet.

       <b>-D</b> <u>DST_LINK_ADDR</u><b>,</b> <b>--dst-link-address</b> <u>DST_LINK_ADDR</u>

              This  option  specifies  the  link-layer Destination Address of the probe packets. By default, the
              link-layer Destination Address is automatically set to the link-layer address of  the  destination
              host  (for  on-link destinations) or to the link-layer address of the first-hop router. Note: this
              option is meaningful only when the underlying link-layer technology is Ethernet.

       <b>-s</b> <u>SRC_ADDR</u><b>,</b> <b>--src-address</b> <u>SRC_ADDR</u>

              This option specifies the IPv6 source address (or IPv6 prefix) to be used for the  Source  Address
              of  the  attack packets. If the "-F" ("--flood-sources") option is specified, this option includes
              an IPv6 prefix, from which random addresses are selected. See the description of the  "-F"  option
              for further information on how the "-s" option is processed in that specific case.

              Note:  When  operating  in  "listening"  mode,  the  Source  Address  is  automatically set to the
              Destination Address of the incoming packet.

       <b>-d</b> <u>DST_ADDR</u><b>,</b> <b>--dst-address</b> <u>DST_ADDR</u>

              This option specifies the IPv6 Destination Address of the victim. It can be left unspecified  only
              if the "-L" option is selected (i.e., if the tool is to operate in "listening" mode).

              Note:  When  operating  in  "listening"  mode, the Destination Address is automatically set to the
              Source Address of the incoming packet.

       <b>-A</b> <u>HOP_LIMIT</u><b>,</b> <b>--hop-limit</b> <u>HOP_LIMIT</u>

              This option specifies the Hop Limit to be used for the IPv6 packets. It defaults to 255.

       <b>-u</b> <u>HDR_SIZE</u><b>,</b> <b>--dst-opt-hdr</b> <u>HDR_SIZE</u>

              This option specifies that a Destination  Options  header  is  to  be  included  in  the  outgoing
              packet(s).  The  extension header size must be specified as an argument to this option (the header
              is filled with padding options). Multiple Destination Options headers may be specified by means of
              multiple "-u" options.

       <b>-U</b> <u>HDR_SIZE</u><b>,</b> <b>--dst-opt-u-hdr</b> <u>HDR_SIZE</u>

              This option specifies a Destination Options header to be included in the "unfragmentable part"  of
              the  outgoing  packet(s).  The  header  size  must be specified as an argument to this option (the
              header is filled with padding options). Multiple Destination Options headers may be  specified  by
              means of multiple "-U" options.

       <b>-H</b> <u>HDR_SIZE</u><b>,</b> <b>--hbh-opt-hdr</b> <u>HDR_SIZE</u>

              This  option  specifies  that  a  Hop-by-Hop  Options  header  is  to  be included in the outgoing
              packet(s). The header size must be specified as an argument to this option (the header  is  filled
              with  padding  options). Multiple Hop-by-Hop Options headers may be specified by means of multiple
              "-H" options.

       <b>-y</b> <u>FRAG_SIZE</u><b>,</b> <b>--frag-hdr</b> <u>FRAG_SIZE</u>

              This option specifies that the resulting packet must be fragmented.  The  fragment  size  must  be
              specified as an argument to this option.

       <b>-P</b> <u>PAYLOAD_SIZE</u><b>,</b> <b>--payload-size</b> <u>PAYLOAD_SIZE</u>

              This options specifies the size of the UDP payload. It defaults to 0 (i.e., empty UDP datagrams).

       <b>-o</b> <u>SRC_PORT</u><b>,</b> <b>--src-port</b> <u>SRC_PORT</u>

              This option specifies the UDP Source Port.

       <b>-a</b> <u>DST_PORT</u><b>,</b> <b>--dst-port</b> <u>DST_PORT</u>

              This option specifies the UDP Destination Port.

       <b>-Z</b> <u>DATA</u><b>,</b> <b>--data</b> <u>DATA</u>

              This  option  is  used  to specify the UDP payload. It will typically include an application-layer
              request. Note: the string used for the DATA parameter can contain the "\r" and "\n" C-style escape
              senquenced for representing "carriage return" and "line feed" (respectively).

              As an example, this option could be employed to send an HTTP request if  set  as  '--data  "GET  /
              HTTP/1.0\r\n\r\n"'.

       <b>-j</b> <u>SRC_ADDR</u><b>,</b> <b>--block-src</b> <u>SRC_ADDR</u>

              This  option  sets a block filter for the incoming packets, based on their IPv6 Source Address. It
              allows the specification of an IPv6 prefix in the form "-j prefix/prefixlen". If the prefix length
              is not specified, a prefix length of "/128" is selected (i.e., the option assumes  that  a  single
              IPv6 address, rather than an IPv6 prefix, has been specified).

       <b>-k</b> <u>DST_ADDR</u><b>,</b> <b>--block-dst</b> <u>DST_ADDR</u>

              This option sets a block filter for the incoming packets, based on their IPv6 Destination Address.
              It  allows  the  specification  of an IPv6 prefix in the form "-k prefix/prefixlen". If the prefix
              length is not specified, a prefix length of "/128" is selected (i.e., the option  assumes  that  a
              single IPv6 address, rather than an IPv6 prefix, has been specified).

       <b>-J</b> <u>LINK_ADDR</u><b>,</b> <b>--block-link-src</b> <u>LINK_ADDR</u>

              This  option  sets  a  block  filter  for  the  incoming packets, based on their link-layer Source
              Address. The option must be  followed  by  a  link-layer  address  (currently,  only  Ethernet  is
              supported).

       <b>-K</b> <u>LINK_ADDR</u><b>,</b> <b>--block-link-dst</b> <u>LINK_ADDR</u>

              This  option  sets  a block filter for the incoming packets, based on their link-layer Destination
              Address. The option must be  followed  by  a  link-layer  address  (currently,  only  Ethernet  is
              supported).

       <b>-b</b> <u>SRC_ADDR</u><b>,</b> <b>--accept-src</b> <u>SRC_ADDR</u>

              This option sets an accept filter for the incoming packets, based on their IPv6 Source Address. It
              allows the specification of an IPv6 prefix in the form "-b prefix/prefixlen". If the prefix length
              is  not  specified,  a prefix length of "/128" is selected (i.e., the option assumes that a single
              IPv6 address, rather than an IPv6 prefix, has been specified).

       <b>-g</b> <u>DST_ADDR</u><b>,</b> <b>--accept-dst</b> <u>DST_ADDR</u>

              This option sets a accept filter for  the  incoming  packets,  based  on  their  IPv6  Destination
              Address.  It  allows the specification of an IPv6 prefix in the form "-g prefix/prefixlen". If the
              prefix length is not specified, a prefix length of "/128" is selected (i.e.,  the  option  assumes
              that a single IPv6 address, rather than an IPv6 prefix, has been specified).

       <b>-B</b> <u>LINK_ADDR</u><b>,</b> <b>--accept-link-src</b> <u>LINK_ADDR</u>

              This  option  sets  an  accept  filter  for the incoming packets, based on their link-layer Source
              Address. The option must be  followed  by  a  link-layer  address  (currently,  only  Ethernet  is
              supported).

       <b>-G</b> <u>LINK_ADDR</u><b>,</b> <b>--accept-link-dst</b> <u>LINK_ADDR</u>

              This  option sets an accept filter for the incoming packets, based on their link-layer Destination
              Address. The option must be  followed  by  a  link-layer  address  (currently,  only  Ethernet  is
              supported).

       <b>-F</b> <u>N_SOURCES</u><b>,</b> <b>--flood-sources</b> <u>N_SOURCES</u>

              This option instructs the tool to send multiple UDP datagrams with different Source Addresses. The
              number  of  different source addresses is specified as "-F number". The Source Address of each UDP
              datagram is randomly selected from the prefix specified by the "-s" option. If the "-F" option  is
              specified  but  the "-s" option is left unspecified, the Source Address of the packets is randomly
              selected from the prefix ::/0.

       <b>-T</b> <u>N_PORTS</u><b>,</b> <b>--flood-ports</b> <u>N_PORTS</u>

              This option instructs the tool to send multiple UDP datagrams with  different  Source  Ports.  The
              Source Port of each UDP datagram is randomly selected from the whole port number space (0-65535).

       <b>-l</b>, <b>--loop</b>

              This  option instructs the udp6 tool to send periodic UDP datagrams to the victim node. The amount
              of time to pause between sending UDP datagrams can be specified by means of the "-z"  option,  and
              defaults  to  1  second.  Note  that  this  option  cannot  be  set  in  conjunction with the "-L"
              ("--listen") option.

       <b>-z</b>, <b>--sleep</b>

              This option specifies the amount of time to pause between sending UDP datagrams (when the "--loop"
              option is set). If left unspecified, it defaults to 1 second.

       <b>-r</b> <u>RATE</u><b>,</b> <b>--rate-limit</b> <u>RATE</u>

              This option specifies the rate limit to use when performing a remote address scan.  "RATE"  should
              be specified as "xbps" or "xpps" (with "x" being an unsigned integer), for rate-limits in bits per
              second or packets per second, respectively.

       <b>-L</b>, <b>--listen</b>

              This instructs the udp6 tool to operate in listening mode (possibly after attacking a given node).
              Note that this option cannot be used in conjunction with the "-l" ("--loop") option.

       <b>-p</b> <u>PROBE_MODE</u><b>,</b> <b>--probe-mode</b> <u>PROBE_MODE</u>

              This  option instructs th too to operate in probe mode. The specific probe mode is specified as an
              argument to this option (currently, only "script" mode is supported).  In  probe  mode,  <b>the</b>  <b>udp6</b>
              sends  probe  datagrams, and waits for response packets. The response packets are decoded based on
              the selected probe mode.

              In the "script" probe mode, the tool decodes UDP datagrams as follows:

                   RESPONSE:RESPONSE_TYPE:RESPONSE_DECODE...

              Where the string RESPONSE is fixed, and RESPONSE_TYPE indicates the response received. As of  this
              version of the tool, the following RESPONSE_TYPE values are supported:

                 + UDP6: Indicates that the tool received a UDP/IPv6 packet
                 + TIMEOUT: Indicates that the tool received no response

              Possibe output lines of the tool are:

                  RESPONSE:TIMEOUT:
                  RESPONSE:UDP6:

              Note:  Future  versions  of  the  tool  will  also  decode ICMPv6 error messages, and will include
              additional data regarding the incoming UDP datagrams (e.g., payload size).

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b>

              This option instructs the udp6 tool to be verbose.  When the option is  set  twice,  the  tool  is
              "very  verbose",  and  the  tool  also  informs which packets have been accepted or discarded as a
              result of applying the specified filters.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>

              Print help information for the <b>udp6</b> tool.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       The following sections illustrate typical use cases of the <b>udp6</b> tool.

       <b>Example</b> <b>#1</b>

       # udp6 -s fc00:1::/64 -d fc00:1::1 -a 22 -F 100 -l -z 1 -v

       In this example the <b>udp6</b> tool is essentially employed to flood port number 22 of the host fc00:1::1.  The
       tool  sends  UDP  datagrams  from  the  prefix  fc00:1::/64  (as specified by the "-s" option) to port 22
       (specified by the "-a" option) at the destination address fc00:1::1 (specified by the "-d"  option).  The
       tool  sends UDP datagrams from 100 different addresses (as specified by the "-F" option) every one second
       (as specified by the "-l" and "-z" options). The tool will be verbose (as specified by the "-v" option).

       <b>Example</b> <b>#3</b>

       # udp6 -d fc00:1::1 -a 80 -l -r 1pps -v --data "GET / HTTP/1.0\r\n\r\n"

       Flood the target system (fc00:1::1) with UDP datagrams at a rate of  one  packet  per  second.  Each  UDP
       datagram will contain (in the payload) the string specified via the "--data" option.

       <b>Example</b> <b>#4</b>

       #  udp6  -i  eth0  -d  fc00:1::1 -a 80 -L -s fc00:1::/112 -l -r 1000pps --udp-flags auto -v --data "GET /
       HTTP/1.0\r\n\r\n" --flood-ports 10 --window-mode close

       Flood the target node (fc00:1::1) with  UDP  connections  (on  port  80).  On  each  connection  that  is
       established,  an  HTTP  request  is  sent, and the UDP window is immediately closed. For each forged IPv6
       source address ten different UDP source ports are randomized. The bandwidth of the attack is  limited  to
       1000 pps.

       <b>Example</b> <b>#5</b>

       # udp6 -d fc00:1::1 -a 80 --udp-flags A --dst-opt-hdr 8 --payload-size 50 --probe-mode script

       Send a probe UDP datagram to UDP port 80 at fc00:1::1. The probe packet consists of an IPv6 packet with a
       Destination  Options header of 8 bytes, and an IPv6 payload consisting of a UDP datagram with the ACK bit
       set, and 50 data bytes. The probe mode is "script".
