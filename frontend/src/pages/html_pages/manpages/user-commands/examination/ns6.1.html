       ns6 - A security assessment tool for attack vectors based on ICMPv6 Neighbor Solicitation messages

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ns6</b>   [<b>-i</b>  <u>INTERFACE</u>]  [-s  SRC_ADDR[/LEN]]  [-d  DST_ADDR]  [-y  FRAG_SIZE]  [-u  DST_OPT_HDR_SIZE]  [-U
       DST_OPT_U_HDR_SIZE] [-H HBH_OPT_HDR_SIZE] [-S LINK_SRC_ADDR] [-D LINK-DST-ADDR] [-E LINK_ADDR]  [-e]  [-t
       TARGET_ADDR[/LEN]] [-F N_SOURCES] [-T N_TARGETS] [-z SECONDS] [-l] [-v] [-h]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ns6</b>  allows  the  assessment of IPv6 implementations with respect to a variety of attacks based on ICMPv6
       Neighbor Solicitation messages. This tool  is  part  of  the  SI6  Networks'  IPv6  Toolkit:  a  security
       assessment suite for the IPv6 protocols.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ns6</b>  The  ns6  tool  takes  its  parameters  by means of command-line options. Each of the options can be
       specified with a short name (one character preceded with the hyphen character, as e.g. "-i")  or  with  a
       long name (a string preceded with two hyphen characters, as e.g. "--interface").

       Depending on the amount of information (i.e., options) to be conveyed into the Neighbor Solicitations, it
       may  be  necessary  for  the  ns6 tool to split that information into more than one Neighbor Solicitation
       message. Also, when the ns6 tool is instructed to flood  the  victim  with  Neighbor  Solicitations  from
       different  sources  ("--flood-sources"  option),  multiple packets may need to be sent. ns6 supports IPv6
       fragmentation, which may be of use if a large amount of information needs to be conveyed within a  single
       Neighbor  Solicitation  message.  IPv6  fragmentation  is  not enabled by default, and must be explicitly
       enabled with the "-y" option.

       <b>-i</b> <u>INTERFACE</u><b>,</b> <b>--interface</b> <u>INTERFACE</u>
              This option specifies the network interface that the tool will use.  If  the  destination  address
              ("-d"  option)  is a link-local address, the interface must be explicitly specified. The interface
              may also be specified along with a destination address, with the "-d" option.

       <b>-s</b> <u>SRC_ADDR</u><b>,</b> <b>--src-address</b> <u>SRC_ADDR</u>

              This option is meant to specify the IPv6 Source Address to be used for the  Neighbor  Solicitation
              messages. If left unspecified, a randomized link-local (fe80::/64) address is selected.

       <b>-d</b> <u>DST_ADDR</u><b>,</b> <b>--dst-address</b> <u>DST_ADDR</u>

              This  option specifies the IPv6 Destination Address of the Neighbor Solicitation messages. If this
              option is left unspecified, but the Ethernet Destination  Address  is  specified,  the  "all-nodes
              link-local multicast" address (ff02::1) is selected as the IPv6 Destination Address.

       --hop-limit, -A

              This  option  specifies  the  IPv6 Hop Limit to be used for the Neighbor Solicitation messages. It
              defaults to 255. Note that IPv6 nodes are required  to  check  that  the  Hop  Limit  of  incoming
              Neighbor  Solicitation messages is 255. Therefore, this option is only useful to assess whether an
              IPv6 implementation fails to enforce the aforementioned check.

       <b>-y</b> <u>SIZE</u><b>,</b> <b>--frag-hdr</b> <u>SIZE</u>

              This option specifies that the resulting packet must be fragmented.  The  fragment  size  must  be
              specified as an argument to this option.

       <b>-u</b> <u>HDR_SIZE</u><b>,</b> <b>--dst-opt-hdr</b> <u>HDR_SIZE</u>

              This option specifies that a Destination Options header is to be included in the resulting packet.
              The  extension  header  size must be specified as an argument to this option (the header is filled
              with padding options). Multiple Destination Options headers may be specified by means of  multiple
              "-u" options.

       <b>-U</b> <u>HDR_SIZE</u><b>,</b> <b>--dst-opt-u-hdr</b> <u>HDR_SIZE</u>

              This  option specifies a Destination Options header to be included in the "unfragmentable part" of
              the resulting packet. The header size must be specified as an argument to this option (the  header
              is filled with padding options). Multiple Destination Options headers may be specified by means of
              multiple  "-U"  options. This option is only valid if the "-y" option is specified (as the concept
              of "unfragmentable part" only makes sense when fragmentation is employed).

       <b>-H</b> <u>HDR_SIZE</u><b>,</b> <b>--hbh-opt-hdr</b> <u>HDR_SIZE</u>

              This option specifies that a Hop-by-Hop Options header is to be included in the resulting  packet.
              The header size must be specified as an argument to this option (the header is filled with padding
              options). Multiple Hop-by-Hop Options headers may be specified by means of multiple "-H" options.

       <b>-S</b> <u>SRC_LINK_ADDR</u><b>,</b> <b>--src-link-address</b> <u>SRC_LINK_ADDR</u>

              This  option  specifies  the  link-layer  Source  Address  of  the  Neighbor Solicitation messages
              (currently, only Ethernet is supported). If left unspecified, the  link-layer  Source  Address  is
              randomized.

       <b>-D</b> <u>DST_LINK_ADDR</u><b>,</b> <b>--dst-link-address</b> <u>DST_LINK_ADDR</u>

              This  option  specifies  the  link-layer Destination Address of the Neighbor Solicitation messages
              (currently, only  Ethernet  is  supported).  If  left  unspecified,  it  is  set  to  the  address
              "33:33:00:00:00:01"  (the  Ethernet  address corresponding to the "all-nodes link-local multicast"
              IPv6 address (ff02::1).

       --target, -t

              This option specifies the IPv6 Target Address of the Neighbor Solicitation messages.

              If the "-T" ("--flood-targets") option is specified, this option specifies an IPv6 prefix  in  the
              form  "-t prefix/prefixlen". See the description of the "-T" option for further information on how
              the "-t" option is processed in that specific case.

       --source-lla-opt, -E

              This option specifies the contents of a source link-layer address option to  be  included  in  the
              Neighbor  Solicitation messages. If more than one source link-layer address is specified (by means
              of multiple "-E" options), and all the resulting options cannot be conveyed into a single Neighbor
              Solicitation, multiple Neighbor Solicitations will be sent as needed.

       --add-slla-opt, -e

              This option instructs the ns6 tool to include a source link-layer address option in  the  Neighbor
              Solicitation  messages that it sends. The link-layer address included in the option is the same as
              the Ethernet Source Address used for the outgoing Neighbor Solicitation messages.

       --flood-sources, -F

              This option instructs the ns6 tool to send Neighbor Solicitations from multiple (and random)  IPv6
              Source  Addresses.  The  number  of different sources is specified as "-F number". The IPv6 Source
              Address of the packets are randomly selected from the prefix specified by the "-s"  option  (which
              defaults to fe80::/64).

       --flood-targets, -T

              This  option  instructs  the  ns6  tool to send Neighbor Solicitation messages for multiple Target
              Addresses. The number of different Target Addresses  is  specified  as  "-T  number".  The  Target
              Address  of  each packet is randomly selected from the prefix ::/64, unless a different prefix has
              been specified by means of the "-t" option.

       --loop, -l

              This option instructs the ns6 tool to send periodic Neighbor  Solicitations  to  the  victim.  The
              amount  of  time  to pause between sending Neighbor Solicitations can be specified by means of the
              "-z" option, and defaults to 1 second.

       --sleep, -z

              This option instructs the ns6 tool to the  amount  of  time  to  pause  between  sending  Neighbor
              Solicitations. If left unspecified, it defaults to 1 second.

       --verbose, -v

              This option instructs the ns6 tool to be verbose.

       --help, -h

              Print help information for the ns6 tool.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       The following sections illustrate typical use cases of the <b>ns6</b> tool.

       <b>Example</b> <b>#1</b>

       # ns6 -i eth0 -d fe80::01 -t 2001:db8::1 -e

       Use  the  network  interface  "eth0"  to  send  a Neighbor Solicitation message using a random link-local
       unicast IPv6 Source Address and a random Ethernet Source Address, to the IPv6 Destination address fe80::1
       and the Ethernet Destination Address 33:33:00:00:00:01 (selected by default). The target of the  Neighbor
       Advertisement is 2001:db8::1. The Neighbor Solicitation also includes a source link-layer address option,
       that contains the same Ethernet address as that used for the Ethernet Source Address of the packet.

       <b>Example</b> <b>#2</b>

       # ns6 -i eth0 -s 2001:db8::/32 -t 2001:db8::1 -F 10 -l -z 10 -e -v

       Send  10  Neighbor  Solicitation  messages  using random Ethernet Source Addresses and random IPv6 Source
       Addresses from the prefix 2001:db8::/32, to the Ethernet Destination Address 33:33:00:00:00:01  (default)
       and  the IPv6 Destination Address ff02::1 (default). The IPv6 Target Address of the Neighbor Solicitation
       is 2001:db8::1, and each message includes a source link-layer  address  option  that  contains  the  same
       address  as  that  used  for  the  Ethernet Source Address of the packet. Repeat this operation every ten
       seconds. Be verbose.

       <b>Example</b> <b>#3</b>

       # ns6 -i eth0 -s 2001:db8::/32 -t 2001:db8::1 -F 10 -l -z 10 -E ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff -v

       Send 10 Neighbor Solicitation messages using random Ethernet Source  Addresses  and  random  IPv6  Source
       Addresses  from  the  prefix fe80::/64 (default, link-local unicast), to the Ethernet Destination Address
       33:33:00:00:00:01 (default) and the IPv6 Destination Address ff02:1 (default). The IPv6 Target Address of
       the Neighbor Solicitation is 2001:db8::1, and each message includes a source  link-layer  address  option
       that  contains  the  Ethernet  address  ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff.  Repeat  this  operation every ten seconds. Be
       verbose.
