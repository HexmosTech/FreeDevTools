</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
   <b>General</b>
       The  zita-j2n  (sender) and zita-n2j (receiver) applications allow to exchange up to 64 channels of full-
       quality uncompressed audio streams between two or more systems running the Jack audio server.  Sender and
       receiver(s) can each have their own sample rate and period size, and no word clock sync between  them  is
       assumed. The receiver uses adaptive resampling to convert the audio stream(s) to its local sample rate.

       There  is  no master/slave relationship between sender and receiver(s).  This is an explicit design goal.
       In all respects the net result of using zita-njbridge is  similar  to  having  analog  audio  connections
       between  the  sound  cards  of the systems using it. Nothing a sender can do will affect the receiver(s),
       apart from the audio signals being available or reverting to silence if there  is  no  sender.  Xruns  or
       skipped  cycles  will  not affect the synchronisation or resampling. Jack freewheeling on either end will
       temporarily suspend operation.

       Zita-njbridge can be used in two ways: one-to-one, or one-to-many.  Both IPv4 and IPv6 are supported.

       For a one-to-one setup the first form of the commands shown above should be used. The  protocol  used  is
       UDP  and  the  ip-address  argument required for both sender and receiver is that of the receiver. A host
       name can be used instead of a numerical IP addresses, this will be looked up using getaddrinfo().

       For a one-to-many setup the second form must be used The ip-address argument should be a valid  multicast
       address, and the mandatory interface argument selects the network interface to be used.

   <b>Resampler</b> <b>filter</b> <b>length.</b>
       The  receiver  uses  the  zita-resampler library to resample signals to its local rate. The length of the
       multiphase low-pass filter used as part of the resampling algorithm determines the audio  bandwidth,  and
       adds to latency. It can also have a significant impact on CPU load if many channels are received.

       Zita-njbridge will select a filter length based on the lower of the sender and receiver sample rates. For
       sample  rates of 44.1 Khz and above the value chosen will result in an attenuation of no more than 0.1 dB
       up to 20 kHz. The --filt option allows one  to  override  the  automatic  configuration,  but  this  will
       normally not be necessary.

   <b>Latency</b> <b>issues.</b>
       When  connecting  two Jack systems with unsynchronised periods the minimum additional latency under worst
       case conditions is the sum of the two period times. Additional latency means any latency required to make
       the connection work without interruption.  The round-trip latency from an  ideal  (zero  excess  latency)
       analog  input  on  the  sender to an ideal (idem) analog output on the receiver will be twice this value.
       Worst case conditions means that the both sender and receiver can run at  arbitrary  times  within  their
       respective periods.

       Zita-njbridge  is  designed to provide a defined and constant additional latency. The target value is the
       sum of the two periods, plus resampling delay, plus any extra buffering specified by the user. The actual
       latency will be this value plus the average network delay. The latter is unknown so there is  no  way  to
       compensate  for  it.  This would be possible using either a return channel, or some way to sync clocks on
       the two systems which could then be used to measure the average network delay.  The  current  release  of
       zita-njbridge  does  not  provide  this as it is meant for use on a local network. A dedicated or lightly
       loaded gigabit Ethernet can provide typical network delays well below a millisecond.

       The --buff option of zita-n2j adds the specified number  of  milliseconds  to  the  target  latency.  The
       default  value  is 10 ms which is more than enough on a moderately loaded Gigabit local network. This can
       be set to zero, for example when it is known that the sender will always run near the start of  its  Jack
       period and the network delay jitter is less than this period.

       If  there  is  any network delay jitter above 10ms, increasing the extra buffer time will be necessary to
       avoid occasional interruption of the received audio streams.

       The latency does not depend on the when exactly the sender runs within its Jack period. This  is  similar
       to  playback to a soundcard: when the playback samples are written well before they are due this does not
       decrease the latency, the data is just buffered until the end of the period. In the case of zita-njbridge
       the remaining time is available for network delay. This is why, when the sender is  only  lightly  loaded
       and network delay is small, it is possible to use --buff 0 at the receivers.

   <b>Use</b> <b>on</b> <b>wide</b> <b>area</b> <b>or</b> <b>wireless</b> <b>networks.</b>
       The  current  implementation  is designed to be used on local networks that provide more or less reliable
       delivery of  packets,  with  low  or  moderate  delay.  Occasional  lost  packets  will  not  impact  the
       synchronisation or resampling, but any samples arriving out of order will be ignored (they will have been
       replaced by silence before). Extra buffering (using the --buff option) will allow an uninterrupted signal
       in  the presence of delay jitter, at the price of additional latency. Zita-njbridge may be usable on long
       distance internet connections, but keep in mind it was not designed for this.

       Performance on wireless networks is purely a matter of chance. Again zita-njbridge is  not  designed  for
       such use.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Common</b> <b>options</b>
       <b>--help</b>
              Print command line and options summary.

       <b>--jname</b> <u>name</u>
              Select the Jack client client name. Default is 'zita-j2n' or 'zita-n2j'.

       <b>--jserv</b> <u>server</u>
              Select the Jack server to connect to.

       <b>--ipv4</b> <b>--ipv6</b>
              Use only the specified IP address type.

   <b>zita-j2n</b> <b>options</b>
       <b>--chan</b> <u>channels</u>
              The number of channels to transmit, the default is 2 channels.

       <b>--16bit</b>
              Send audio as 16-bit signed integer samples.

       <b>--24bit</b>
              Send audio as 24-bit signed integer samples. This is the default format.

       <b>--float</b>
              Send audio as 32-bit floating point samples (Jack's internal format).

       <b>--mtu</b> <u>MTU</u>
              Inform  zita-j2n of the path MTU, allowing it to use packets up to that size. The default value is
              1500. Note that large MTU values on a shared network may increase network delay jitter.

       <b>--hops</b> <u>hops</u>
              Set the maximum number of hops for multicast packets.  Defaults to one, i.e. multicast is  to  the
              local net only.

   <b>zita-n2j</b> <b>options</b>
       <b>--chan</b> <u>list</u>
              A  list  of  channels  numbers  in  ascending order and separated by comma or dash characters, the
              latter indicating a range.  Channel numbers start at  1.  Only  the  requested  channels  will  be
              resampled  and  have  a  corresponding  Jack port. Channels not provided by the sender will output
              silence. The default channel list is '1,2'.

       <b>--buff</b> <u>time</u>
              Increase the target latency by the given time, in milliseconds.  The default is  10  ms.  See  the
              description above for what exactly this means.

       <b>--filt</b> <u>delay</u>
              Set  the  resampler  filter  delay,  in samples at the lower of the two sample rates, in the range
              16..96. See above for details.

       <b>--info</b>
              Print additional diagnostic information. Four values will be printed four times  per  second:  the
              number  of  jack  periods  during the last 1/4 second, the average resampler control loop error in
              frames, the average resampler ratio correction and the minimum number of frames available  in  the
              receive buffer.
