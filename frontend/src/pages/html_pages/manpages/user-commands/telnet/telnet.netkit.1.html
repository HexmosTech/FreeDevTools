</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       telnet — user interface to the TELNET protocol

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>telnet</b> [<b>-468ELadr</b>] [<b>-S</b> <u>tos</u>] [<b>-b</b> <u>address</u>] [<b>-e</b> <u>escapechar</u>] [<b>-l</b> <u>user</u>] [<b>-n</b> <u>tracefile</u>] [<u>host</u> [<u>port</u>]]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>telnet</b> command is used for interactive communication with another host using the TELNET protocol. It
       begins in command mode, where it prints a telnet prompt ("telnet&gt; "). If <b>telnet</b> is invoked  with  a  <u>host</u>
       argument, it performs an <b>open</b> command implicitly; see the description below.

       Options:

       <b>-4</b>      Force IPv4 address resolution.

       <b>-6</b>      Force IPv6 address resolution.

       <b>-8</b>      Request  8-bit  operation.  This causes an attempt to negotiate the TELNET BINARY option for both
               input and output. By default telnet is not 8-bit clean.

       <b>-E</b>      Disables the escape  character  functionality;  that  is,  sets  the  escape  character  to  ``no
               character''.

       <b>-L</b>      Specifies an 8-bit data path on output.  This causes the TELNET BINARY option to be negotiated on
               just output.

       <b>-a</b>      Attempt  automatic  login.   Currently,  this  sends  the  user name via the USER variable of the
               NEW-ENVIRON option if supported by the remote system. The username is retrieved via <u><a href="../man3/getlogin.3.html">getlogin</a></u>(3).

       <b>-b</b> <u>address</u>
               Use <a href="../man2/bind.2.html">bind</a>(2) on the local socket to bind it to a specific local address.

       <b>-d</b>      Sets the initial value of the <b>debug</b> toggle to TRUE.

       <b>-r</b>      Emulate  <u><a href="../man1/rlogin.1.html">rlogin</a></u>(1).   In  this  mode,  the  default  escape  character  is  a  tilde.  Also,  the
               interpretation  of  the escape character is changed: an escape character followed by a dot causes
               <b>telnet</b> to disconnect from the remote host. A ^Z instead of a dot suspends <b>telnet</b>, and a  ^]  (the
               default  <b>telnet</b> escape character) generates a normal telnet prompt. These codes are accepted only
               at the beginning of a line.

       <b>-S</b> <u>tos</u>  Sets the IP type-of-service (TOS) option for the telnet connection to the value <u>tos</u>.

       <b>-e</b> <u>escapechar</u>
               Sets the escape character to <u>escapechar.</u> If no character is supplied, no escape character will be
               used.  Entering the escape character while connected causes telnet to drop to command mode.

       <b>-l</b> <u>user</u>
               Specify <u>user</u> as the user to log in as on the remote system. This is accomplished by  sending  the
               specified  name  as  the USER environment variable, so it requires that the remote system support
               the TELNET NEW-ENVIRON option. This option implies the <b>-a</b> option, and may also be used  with  the
               <b>open</b> command.

       <b>-n</b> <u>tracefile</u>
               Opens <u>tracefile</u> for recording trace information.  See the <b>set</b> <b>tracefile</b> command below.

       <u>host</u>    Specifies a host to contact over the network.

       <u>port</u>    Specifies  a  port  number  or service name to contact. If not specified, the <b>telnet</b> port (23) is
               used.

       Protocol:

       Once a connection has been opened, <b>telnet</b> will attempt to enable the TELNET  LINEMODE  option.   If  this
       fails,  then  <b>telnet</b>  will revert to one of two input modes: either “character at a time” or “old line by
       line” depending on what the remote system supports.

       When LINEMODE is enabled, character processing is done on the local system,  under  the  control  of  the
       remote  system.   When input editing or character echoing is to be disabled, the remote system will relay
       that information.  The remote system will also relay changes to any special characters that happen on the
       remote system, so that they can take effect on the local system.

       In “character at a time” mode, most text typed is immediately sent to the remote host for processing.

       In “old line by line” mode, all text is echoed locally, and (normally) only completed lines are  sent  to
       the  remote  host.   The “local echo character” (initially “^E”) may be used to turn off and on the local
       echo (this would mostly be used to enter passwords without the password being echoed).

       If the LINEMODE option is enabled, or if the <b>localchars</b> toggle is TRUE (the  default  for  “old  line  by
       line“;  see  below),  the user's <b>quit</b>, <b>intr</b>, and <b>flush</b> characters are trapped locally, and sent as TELNET
       protocol sequences to the remote side.  If LINEMODE has ever been enabled, then the user's <b>susp</b>  and  <b>eof</b>
       are also sent as TELNET protocol sequences, and <b>quit</b> is sent as a TELNET ABORT instead of BREAK There are
       options  (see  <b>toggle</b>  <b>autoflush</b>  and <b>toggle</b> <b>autosynch</b> below) which cause this action to flush subsequent
       output to the terminal (until the remote host  acknowledges  the  TELNET  sequence)  and  flush  previous
       terminal input (in the case of <b>quit</b> and <b>intr</b>).

       Commands:

       The following <b>telnet</b> commands are available. Unique prefixes are understood as abbreviations.

       <b>auth</b> <u>argument</u> <u>...</u>
                  The  <b>auth</b>  command  controls  the TELNET AUTHENTICATE protocol option.  If <b>telnet</b> was compiled
                  without authentication, the <b>auth</b> command will  not  be  supported.   Valid  arguments  are  as
                  follows:

                  <b>disable</b> <u>type</u>  Disable  the  specified  type  of authentication.  To obtain a list of available
                                types, use the <b>auth</b> <b>disable</b> <b>?</b> command.

                  <b>enable</b> <u>type</u>   Enable the specified type of authentication.  To  obtain  a  list  of  available
                                types, use the <b>auth</b> <b>enable</b> <b>?</b> command.

                  <b>status</b>        List the current status of the various types of authentication.

                  Note that the current version of <b>telnet</b> does not support authentication.

       <b>close</b>      Close the connection to the remote host, if any, and return to command mode.

       <b>display</b> <u>argument</u> <u>...</u>
                  Display all, or some, of the <b>set</b> and <b>toggle</b> values (see below).

       <b>encrypt</b> <u>argument</u> <u>...</u>
                  The  encrypt  command  controls  the  TELNET  ENCRYPT  protocol option. If <b>telnet</b> was compiled
                  without encryption, the <b>encrypt</b> command will not be supported.

                  Valid arguments are as follows:

                  <b>disable</b> <u>type</u> <b>[input|output]</b>
                                Disable the specified type of encryption.   If  you  do  not  specify  input  or
                                output,  encryption  of  both is disabled.  To obtain a list of available types,
                                use ``encrypt disable ?''.

                  <b>enable</b> <u>type</u> <b>[input|output]</b>
                                Enable the specified type of encryption.  If you do not specify input or output,
                                encryption of both is enabled.   To  obtain  a  list  of  available  types,  use
                                ``encrypt enable ?''.

                  <b>input</b>         This is the same as ``encrypt start input''.

                  <b>-input</b>        This is the same as ``encrypt stop input''.

                  <b>output</b>        This is the same as ``encrypt start output''.

                  <b>-output</b>       This is the same as ``encrypt stop output''.

                  <b>start</b> <b>[input|output]</b>
                                Attempt  to begin encrypting.  If you do not specify input or output, encryption
                                of both input and output is started.

                  <b>status</b>        Display the current status of the encryption module.

                  <b>stop</b> <b>[input|output]</b>
                                Stop encrypting.  If you do not specify input or output, encryption of  both  is
                                stopped.

                  <b>type</b> <u>type</u>     Sets  the  default type of encryption to be used with later ``encrypt start'' or
                                ``encrypt stop'' commands.

                  Note that the current version of <b>telnet</b> does not support encryption.

       <b>environ</b> <u>arguments...</u>
                  The <b>environ</b> command is used to propagate environment variables across the  <b>telnet</b>  link  using
                  the  TELNET  NEW-ENVIRON  protocol option.  All variables exported from the shell are defined,
                  but only the DISPLAY and PRINTER variables are  marked  to  be  sent  by  default.   The  USER
                  variable is marked to be sent if the <b>-a</b> or <b>-l</b> command-line options were used.

                  Valid arguments for the <b>environ</b> command are:

                  <b>define</b> <u>variable</u> <u>value</u>
                              Define  the  variable  <u>variable</u> to have a value of <u>value.</u> Any variables defined by
                              this command are automatically marked for propagation (``exported'').   The  <u>value</u>
                              may  be  enclosed  in  single  or  double  quotes  so  that tabs and spaces may be
                              included.

                  <b>undefine</b> <u>variable</u>
                              Remove any existing definition of <u>variable</u>.

                  <b>export</b> <u>variable</u>
                              Mark the specified variable for propagation to the remote host.

                  <b>unexport</b> <u>variable</u>
                              Do not mark the specified variable for propagation to the remote host. The  remote
                              host may still ask explicitly for variables that are not exported.

                  <b>list</b>        List  the  current  set  of  environment variables.  Those marked with a <b>*</b> will be
                              propagated to the remote host. The remote host may still ask  explicitly  for  the
                              rest.

                  <b>?</b>           Prints out help information for the <b>environ</b> command.

       <b>logout</b>     Send the TELNET LOGOUT protocol option to the remote host.  This command is similar to a <b>close</b>
                  command.  If  the  remote host does not support the LOGOUT option, nothing happens.  But if it
                  does, this command should cause it to close the connection.  If the remote side also  supports
                  the  concept  of  suspending  a  user's  session  for  later  reattachment, the logout command
                  indicates that the session should be terminated immediately.

       <b>mode</b> <u>type</u>  <u>Type</u> is one of several options, depending on the state of the session.  Telnet asks the remote
                  host to go into the requested mode. If the remote host says it can, that mode takes effect.

                  <b>character</b>     Disable the TELNET LINEMODE option, or, if the remote side does  not  understand
                                the LINEMODE option, then enter “character at a time“ mode.

                  <b>line</b>          Enable  the  TELNET  LINEMODE option, or, if the remote side does not understand
                                the LINEMODE option, then attempt to enter “old-line-by-line“ mode.

                  <b>isig</b> (<b>-isig</b>)  Attempt to enable (disable) the TRAPSIG  mode  of  the  LINEMODE  option.   This
                                requires that the LINEMODE option be enabled.

                  <b>edit</b> (<b>-edit</b>)  Attempt to enable (disable) the EDIT mode of the LINEMODE option.  This requires
                                that the LINEMODE option be enabled.

                  <b>softtabs</b> (<b>-softtabs</b>)
                                Attempt  to  enable  (disable)  the  SOFT_TAB mode of the LINEMODE option.  This
                                requires that the LINEMODE option be enabled.

                  <b>litecho</b> (<b>-litecho</b>)
                                Attempt to enable (disable) the LIT_ECHO mode  of  the  LINEMODE  option.   This
                                requires that the LINEMODE option be enabled.

                  <b>?</b>             Prints out help information for the <b>mode</b> command.

       <b>open</b> <u>host</u> [[<b>-l</b>] <u>user</u>][<b>-</b> <u>port</u>]
                  Open  a  connection to the named host.  If no port number is specified, <b>telnet</b> will attempt to
                  contact a telnet daemon at the standard port (23).  The host specification may be a host  name
                  or  IP  address.   The <b>-l</b> option may be used to specify a user name to be passed to the remote
                  system, like the <b>-l</b> command-line option.

                  When connecting to ports other than the <b>telnet</b> port, <b>telnet</b> does not attempt  telnet  protocol
                  negotiations.  This  makes  it  possible to connect to services that do not support the telnet
                  protocol without making a mess. Protocol negotiation can be forced by placing  a  dash  before
                  the port number.

                  After establishing a connection, any commands associated with the remote host in <u>/etc/telnetrc</u>
                  and the user's <u>.telnetrc</u> file are executed, in that order.

                  The format of the telnetrc files is as follows: Lines beginning with a #, and blank lines, are
                  ignored.  The rest of the file should consist of hostnames and sequences of <b>telnet</b> commands to
                  use  with  that host. Commands should be one per line, indented by whitespace; lines beginning
                  without whitespace are interpreted as hostnames.  Lines beginning with  the  special  hostname
                  ‘DEFAULT’  will apply to all hosts.  Hostnames including ‘DEFAULT’ may be followed immediately
                  by a colon and a port number or string.  If a port is specified it  must  match  exactly  with
                  what is specified on the command line.  If no port was specified on the command line, then the
                  value  ‘telnet’  is  used.  Upon connecting to a particular host, the commands associated with
                  that host are executed.

       <b>quit</b>       Close any open session and exit <b>telnet</b>.  An end of file condition on input,  when  in  command
                  mode, will trigger this operation as well.

       <b>send</b> <u>arguments</u>
                  Send  one  or  more  special  telnet  protocol  character  sequences  to the remote host.  The
                  following are the codes which may be specified (more than one may be used in one command):

                  <b>abort</b>   Sends the TELNET ABORT (Abort Processes) sequence.

                  <b>ao</b>      Sends the TELNET AO (Abort Output) sequence, which should cause the remote  system  to
                          flush all output <u>from</u> the remote system <u>to</u> the user's terminal.

                  <b>ayt</b>     Sends  the TELNET AYT (Are You There?) sequence, to which the remote system may or may
                          not choose to respond.

                  <b>brk</b>     Sends the TELNET BRK (Break) sequence, which  may  have  significance  to  the  remote
                          system.

                  <b>ec</b>      Sends  the  TELNET EC (Erase Character) sequence, which should cause the remote system
                          to erase the last character entered.

                  <b>el</b>      Sends the TELNET EL (Erase Line) sequence, which should cause  the  remote  system  to
                          erase the line currently being entered.

                  <b>eof</b>     Sends the TELNET EOF (End Of File) sequence.

                  <b>eor</b>     Sends the TELNET EOR (End of Record) sequence.

                  <b>escape</b>  Sends the current <b>telnet</b> escape character.

                  <b>ga</b>      Sends  the  TELNET  GA  (Go  Ahead)  sequence, which likely has no significance to the
                          remote system.

                  <b>getstatus</b>
                          If the remote side supports  the  TELNET  STATUS  command,  <b>getstatus</b>  will  send  the
                          subnegotiation to request that the server send its current option status.

                  <b>ip</b>      Sends the TELNET IP (Interrupt Process) sequence, which should cause the remote system
                          to abort the currently running process.

                  <b>nop</b>     Sends the TELNET NOP (No Operation) sequence.

                  <b>susp</b>    Sends the TELNET SUSP (Suspend Process) sequence.

                  <b>synch</b>   Sends  the  TELNET  SYNCH sequence.  This sequence causes the remote system to discard
                          all previously typed (but not yet read) input.  This sequence is sent  as  TCP  urgent
                          data  (and may not work if the remote system is a 4.2BSD system -- if it doesn't work,
                          a lower case “r” may be echoed on the terminal).

                  <b>do</b> <u>cmd</u>

                  <b>dont</b> <u>cmd</u>

                  <b>will</b> <u>cmd</u>

                  <b>wont</b> <u>cmd</u>
                          Sends the TELNET DO <u>cmd</u> sequence.  <u>cmd</u> can be either a decimal number  between  0  and
                          255, or a symbolic name for a specific TELNET command.  <u>cmd</u> can also be either <b>help</b> or
                          <b>?</b> to print out help information, including a list of known symbolic names.

                  <b>?</b>       Prints out help information for the <b>send</b> command.

       <b>set</b> <u>argument</u> <u>value</u>

       <b>unset</b> <u>argument</u> <u>value</u>
                  The  <b>set</b>  command  will  set any one of a number of <b>telnet</b> variables to a specific value or to
                  TRUE.  The special value <b>off</b> turns off the function associated  with  the  variable.  This  is
                  equivalent  to using the <b>unset</b> command.  The <b>unset</b> command will disable or set to FALSE any of
                  the specified variables.  The values  of  variables  may  be  interrogated  with  the  <b>display</b>
                  command.   The  variables  which  may  be  set or unset, but not toggled, are listed here.  In
                  addition, any of the variables for the <b>toggle</b> command may be explicitly set or unset.

                  <b>ayt</b>     If telnet is in localchars mode, or LINEMODE is enabled, and the status  character  is
                          typed,  a  TELNET  AYT sequence is sent to the remote host.  The initial value for the
                          "Are You There" character is the terminal's status character.

                  <b>echo</b>    This is the value (initially “^E”) which, when in “line by line” mode, toggles between
                          doing local echoing of entered characters (for  normal  processing),  and  suppressing
                          echoing of entered characters (for entering, say, a password).

                  <b>eof</b>     If <b>telnet</b> is operating in LINEMODE or “old line by line” mode, entering this character
                          as  the  first  character on a line will cause this character to be sent to the remote
                          system.  The initial value of the eof character is taken  to  be  the  terminal's  <b>eof</b>
                          character.

                  <b>erase</b>   If  <b>telnet</b>  is  in  <b>localchars</b>  mode  (see  <b>toggle</b> <b>localchars</b> below), <b>and</b> if <b>telnet</b> is
                          operating in “character at a time” mode, then when this character is typed,  a  TELNET
                          EC  sequence  (see <b>send</b> <b>ec</b> above) is sent to the remote system.  The initial value for
                          the erase character is taken to be the terminal's <b>erase</b> character.

                  <b>escape</b>  This is the <b>telnet</b> escape character (initially “^]”) which causes  entry  into  <b>telnet</b>
                          command mode (when connected to a remote system).

                  <b>flushoutput</b>
                          If  <b>telnet</b>  is  in  <b>localchars</b>  mode (see <b>toggle</b> <b>localchars</b> below) and the <b>flushoutput</b>
                          character is typed, a TELNET AO sequence (see <b>send</b> <b>ao</b> above) is  sent  to  the  remote
                          host.   The  initial value for the flush character is taken to be the terminal's <b>flush</b>
                          character.

                  <b>forw1</b>

                  <b>forw2</b>   If TELNET is operating in LINEMODE, these are the characters that, when  typed,  cause
                          partial  lines  to  be  forwarded  to  the  remote  system.  The initial value for the
                          forwarding characters are taken from the terminal's eol and eol2 characters.

                  <b>interrupt</b>
                          If <b>telnet</b> is in <b>localchars</b> mode  (see  <b>toggle</b>  <b>localchars</b>  below)  and  the  <b>interrupt</b>
                          character  is  typed,  a  TELNET IP sequence (see <b>send</b> <b>ip</b> above) is sent to the remote
                          host.  The initial value for the interrupt character is taken  to  be  the  terminal's
                          <b>intr</b> character.

                  <b>kill</b>    If  <b>telnet</b>  is  in  <b>localchars</b>  mode  (see  <b>toggle</b> <b>localchars</b> below), <b>and</b> if <b>telnet</b> is
                          operating in “character at a time” mode, then when this character is typed,  a  TELNET
                          EL  sequence  (see <b>send</b> <b>el</b> above) is sent to the remote system.  The initial value for
                          the kill character is taken to be the terminal's <b>kill</b> character.

                  <b>lnext</b>   If <b>telnet</b> is operating in LINEMODE or “old line by line“ mode, then this character  is
                          taken to be the terminal's <b>lnext</b> character.  The initial value for the lnext character
                          is taken to be the terminal's <b>lnext</b> character.

                  <b>quit</b>    If  <b>telnet</b>  is in <b>localchars</b> mode (see <b>toggle</b> <b>localchars</b> below) and the <b>quit</b> character
                          is typed, a TELNET BRK sequence (see <b>send</b> <b>brk</b> above) is sent to the remote host.   The
                          initial value for the quit character is taken to be the terminal's <b>quit</b> character.

                  <b>reprint</b>
                          If  <b>telnet</b> is operating in LINEMODE or “old line by line“ mode, then this character is
                          taken to be the terminal's <b>reprint</b> character.   The  initial  value  for  the  reprint
                          character is taken to be the terminal's <b>reprint</b> character.

                  <b>rlogin</b>  This  is the rlogin mode escape character. Setting it enables rlogin mode, as with the
                          <u>r</u> command-line option (q.v.)

                  <b>start</b>   If the TELNET TOGGLE-FLOW-CONTROL option has been  enabled,  then  this  character  is
                          taken  to be the terminal's <b>start</b> character.  The initial value for the kill character
                          is taken to be the terminal's <b>start</b> character.

                  <b>stop</b>    If the TELNET TOGGLE-FLOW-CONTROL option has been  enabled,  then  this  character  is
                          taken  to  be the terminal's <b>stop</b> character.  The initial value for the kill character
                          is taken to be the terminal's <b>stop</b> character.

                  <b>susp</b>    If <b>telnet</b> is in <b>localchars</b> mode, or LINEMODE is enabled, and the <b>suspend</b> character  is
                          typed,  a  TELNET SUSP sequence (see <b>send</b> <b>susp</b> above) is sent to the remote host.  The
                          initial value for the  suspend  character  is  taken  to  be  the  terminal's  <b>suspend</b>
                          character.

                  <b>tracefile</b>
                          This  is the file to which the output, caused by <b>netdata</b> or <b>option</b> tracing being TRUE,
                          will be written.  If it is set to “<b>-</b>”, then tracing information  will  be  written  to
                          standard output (the default).

                  <b>worderase</b>
                          If  <b>telnet</b> is operating in LINEMODE or “old line by line“ mode, then this character is
                          taken to be the terminal's <b>worderase</b> character.  The initial value for  the  worderase
                          character is taken to be the terminal's <b>worderase</b> character.

                  <b>?</b>       Displays the legal <b>set</b> (<b>unset</b>) commands.

       <b>slc</b> <u>state</u>  The  <b>slc</b>  command (Set Local Characters) is used to set or change the state of the the special
                  characters when  the  TELNET  LINEMODE  option  has  been  enabled.   Special  characters  are
                  characters  that  get  mapped  to  TELNET commands sequences (like <b>ip</b> or <b>quit</b>) or line editing
                  characters (like <b>erase</b> and <b>kill</b>).  By default, the local special characters are exported.

                  <b>check</b>       Verify the current settings for the current special characters.  The  remote  side
                              is  requested to send all the current special character settings, and if there are
                              any discrepancies with the local side, the local side will switch  to  the  remote
                              value.

                  <b>export</b>      Switch  to  the  local  defaults  for  the  special characters.  The local default
                              characters are those of the local terminal at the time when <b>telnet</b> was started.

                  <b>import</b>      Switch to the remote defaults for the  special  characters.   The  remote  default
                              characters  are  those of the remote system at the time when the TELNET connection
                              was established.

                  <b>?</b>           Prints out help information for the <b>slc</b> command.

       <b>status</b>     Show the current status of <b>telnet</b>.  This includes the name of the remote host, if any, as well
                  as the current mode.

       <b>toggle</b> <u>arguments</u> <u>...</u>
                  Toggle (between TRUE and FALSE) various flags that control  how  <b>telnet</b>  responds  to  events.
                  These  flags  may  be  set explicitly to TRUE or FALSE using the <b>set</b> and <b>unset</b> commands.  More
                  than one flag may be toggled at once.  The state of these  flags  may  be  examined  with  the
                  <b>display</b> command.  Valid flags are:

                  <b>authdebug</b>     Turns  on  debugging  for  the  authentication  code.  This  flag only exists if
                                authentication support is enabled.

                  <b>autoflush</b>     If <b>autoflush</b> and <b>localchars</b> are both TRUE, then when the <b>ao</b>, or <b>quit</b>  characters
                                are  recognized  (and  transformed  into  TELNET  sequences;  see  <b>set</b> above for
                                details), <b>telnet</b> refuses to display any data on the user's  terminal  until  the
                                remote  system  acknowledges  (via  a  TELNET  TIMING  MARK  option) that it has
                                processed those TELNET sequences.  The initial value for this toggle is TRUE  if
                                the terminal user had not done an "stty noflsh", otherwise FALSE (see <u><a href="../man1/stty.1.html">stty</a></u>(1)).

                  <b>autodecrypt</b>   When  the  TELNET ENCRYPT option is negotiated, by default the actual encryption
                                (decryption) of the data stream does not start automatically.   The  autoencrypt
                                (autodecrypt) command states that encryption of the output (input) stream should
                                be enabled as soon as possible.

                                Note that this flag exists only if encryption support is enabled.

                  <b>autologin</b>     If the remote side supports the TELNET AUTHENTICATION option, telnet attempts to
                                use it to perform automatic authentication.  If the TELNET AUTHENTICATION option
                                is  not  supported,  the  user's  login  name  is  propagated  using  the TELNET
                                NEW-ENVIRON option.  Setting this flag is the same as specifying the <u>a</u> option to
                                the <b>open</b> command or on the command line.

                  <b>autosynch</b>     If <b>autosynch</b> and <b>localchars</b> are both TRUE, then when either  the  <b>intr</b>  or  <b>quit</b>
                                characters  is  typed  (see  <b>set</b>  above  for  descriptions  of the <b>intr</b> and <b>quit</b>
                                characters), the resulting telnet sequence sent is followed by the TELNET  SYNCH
                                sequence.   This procedure <b>should</b> cause the remote system to begin throwing away
                                all previously typed input until both of the telnet sequences have been read and
                                acted upon.  The initial value of this toggle is FALSE.

                  <b>binary</b>        Enable or disable the TELNET BINARY option on both input and output.

                  <b>inbinary</b>      Enable or disable the TELNET BINARY option on input.

                  <b>outbinary</b>     Enable or disable the TELNET BINARY option on output.

                  <b>crlf</b>          If this is TRUE, then carriage returns will be sent as  <b>&lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt;</b>.   If  this  is
                                FALSE,  then  carriage returns will be send as <b>&lt;CR&gt;&lt;NUL&gt;</b>.  The initial value for
                                this toggle is FALSE.

                  <b>crmod</b>         Toggle carriage return mode.  When this mode is enabled,  most  carriage  return
                                characters  received  from the remote host will be mapped into a carriage return
                                followed by a line feed.  This mode does not affect those  characters  typed  by
                                the  user,  only  those  received  from  the remote host.  This mode is not very
                                useful unless the remote host only sends carriage return, but never  line  feed.
                                The initial value for this toggle is FALSE.

                  <b>debug</b>         Toggles  socket  level  debugging  (useful only to the <b>super</b> <b>user</b>).  The initial
                                value for this toggle is FALSE.

                  <b>encdebug</b>      Turns on debugging information for the encryption code.   Note  that  this  flag
                                only exists if encryption support is available.

                  <b>localchars</b>    If  this  is  TRUE,  then the <b>flush</b>, <b>interrupt</b>, <b>quit</b>, <b>erase</b>, and <b>kill</b> characters
                                (see <b>set</b>  above)  are  recognized  locally,  and  transformed  into  (hopefully)
                                appropriate  TELNET control sequences (respectively <b>ao</b>, <b>ip</b>, <b>brk</b>, <b>ec</b>, and <b>el</b>; see
                                <b>send</b> above).  The initial value for this toggle is TRUE in “old  line  by  line”
                                mode,  and  FALSE  in  “character  at a time” mode.  When the LINEMODE option is
                                enabled, the value of <b>localchars</b> is ignored, and assumed to always be TRUE.   If
                                LINEMODE  has ever been enabled, then <b>quit</b> is sent as <b>abort</b>, and <b>eof</b> and <b>suspend</b>
                                are sent as <b>eof</b> and <b>susp</b>, see <b>send</b> above).

                  <b>netdata</b>       Toggles the display of all network data (in hexadecimal  format).   The  initial
                                value for this toggle is FALSE.

                  <b>options</b>       Toggles  the  display  of some internal <b>telnet</b> protocol processing (having to do
                                with telnet options).  The initial value for this toggle is FALSE.

                  <b>prettydump</b>    When the <b>netdata</b> toggle is enabled, if <b>prettydump</b> is enabled the output from the
                                <b>netdata</b> command will be formatted in a more user-readable  format.   Spaces  are
                                put  between  each  character  in the output, and the beginning of telnet escape
                                sequences are preceded by a '*' to aid in locating them.

                  <b>skiprc</b>        When the skiprc toggle is TRUE, telnet does not read the  telnetrc  files.   The
                                initial value for this toggle is FALSE.

                  <b>termdata</b>      Toggles  the  display of all terminal data (in hexadecimal format).  The initial
                                value for this toggle is FALSE.

                  <b>verbose_encrypt</b>
                                When the <b>verbose_encrypt</b> toggle is TRUE, TELNET prints out a message  each  time
                                encryption  is enabled or disabled.  The initial value for this toggle is FALSE.
                                This flag only exists if encryption support is available.

                  <b>?</b>             Displays the legal <b>toggle</b> commands.

       <b>z</b>          Suspend <b>telnet</b>.  This command only works when the user is using the <u><a href="../man1/csh.1.html">csh</a></u>(1).

       <b>!</b> [<u>command</u>]
                  Execute a single command in a subshell on the local system.  If <b>command</b> is  omitted,  then  an
                  interactive subshell is invoked.

       <b>?</b> [<u>command</u>]
                  Get help.  With no arguments, <b>telnet</b> prints a help summary.  If a command is specified, <b>telnet</b>
                  will print the help information for just that command.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Telnet</b>  uses  at  least  the  HOME,  SHELL,  DISPLAY,  and TERM environment variables.  Other environment
       variables may be propagated to the other side via the TELNET NEW-ENVIRON option.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <u>/etc/telnetrc</u>  global telnet startup values
       <u><a href="file:~/.telnetrc">~/.telnetrc</a></u>    user customized telnet startup values

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>Telnet</b> command appeared in 4.2BSD.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       On some remote systems, echo has to be turned off manually when in “old line by line” mode.

       In “old line by line” mode or LINEMODE the terminal's <b>eof</b> character is only recognized (and sent  to  the
       remote system) when it is the first character on a line.
