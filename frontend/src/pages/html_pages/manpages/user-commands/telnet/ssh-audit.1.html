</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ssh-audit</b> - SSH server &amp; client configuration auditor

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ssh-audit</b> [<u>options</u>] <u>&lt;target_host&gt;</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ssh-audit</b>  analyzes  the  configuration  of SSH servers &amp; clients, then warns the user of weak, obsolete,
       and/or untested cryptographic primitives.  It is very useful for hardening SSH tunnels, which by  default
       tend to be optimized for compatibility, not security.

       See &lt;https://www.ssh-audit.com/&gt; for official hardening guides for common platforms.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-h,</b> <b>--help</b>
              Print short summary of options.

       <b>-1,</b> <b>--ssh1</b>
              Only perform an audit using SSH protocol version 1.

       <b>-2,</b> <b>--ssh2</b>
              Only perform an audit using SSH protocol version 2.

       <b>-4,</b> <b>--ipv4</b>
              Prioritize the usage of IPv4.

       <b>-6,</b> <b>--ipv6</b>
              Prioritize the usage of IPv6.

       <b>-b,</b> <b>--batch</b>
              Enables grepable output.

       <b>-c,</b> <b>--client-audit</b>
              Starts  a  server  on  port  2222 to audit client software configuration.  Use -p/--port=&lt;port&gt; to
              change port and -t/--timeout=&lt;secs&gt; to change listen timeout.

       <b>--conn-rate-test=N[:max_rate]</b>
              Performs a connection rate test (useful for collecting metrics related to  susceptibility  of  the
              DHEat vulnerability [CVE-2002-20001]).  A successful connection is counted when the server returns
              a  valid SSH banner.  Testing is conducted with N concurrent sockets with an optional maximum rate
              of connections per second.

       <b>-d,</b> <b>--debug</b>
              Enable debug output.

       <b>--dheat=N[:kex[:e_len]]</b>
              Run the DHEat DoS attack (CVE-2002-20001) against  the  target  server  (which  will  consume  all
              available CPU resources).  The number of concurrent sockets, N, needed to achieve this effect will
              be  highly  dependent on the CPU resources available on the target, as well as the latency between
              the source and target machines.  The key exchange is automatically chosen  based  on  which  would
              cause  maximum  effect,  unless  explicitly chosen in the second field.  Lastly, an (experimental)
              option allows the length in bytes of the fake e value sent to the server to be  specified  in  the
              third field.  Normally, the length of e is roughly the length of the modulus of the Diffie-Hellman
              exchange  (hence, an 8192-bit / 1024-byte value of e is sent in each connection when targeting the
              diffie-hellman-group18-sha512 algorithm).  Instead, it was observed that many SSH  implementations
              accept small values, such as 4 bytes; this results in a much more network-efficient attack.

       <b>-g,</b> <b>--gex-test=&lt;x[,y,...]</b> <b>|</b> <b>min1:pref1:max1[,min2:pref2:max2,...]</b> <b>|</b> <b>x-y[:step]&gt;</b>
              Runs a Diffie-Hellman Group Exchange modulus size test against a server.

              Diffie-Hellman  requires  the client and server to agree on a generator value and a modulus value.
              In the "Group Exchange" implementation of Diffie-Hellman, the client specifies  the  size  of  the
              modulus  in  bits  by  providing the server with minimum, preferred and maximum values. The server
              then finds a group that best matches the client's request, returning the  corresponding  generator
              and modulus.  For a full explanation of this process see RFC 4419 and its successors.

              This  test acts as a client by providing an SSH server with the size of a modulus and then obtains
              the size of the modulus returned by the server.

              Three types of syntax are supported:

                1. &lt;x[,y,...]&gt;

                   A comma delimited list of modulus sizes.
                   A test is performed against each value in the list where it acts as  the  minimum,  preferred
              and maximum modulus size.

                2. &lt;min:pref:max[,min:pref:max,...]&gt;

                   A set of three colon delimited values denoting minimum, preferred and maximum modulus size.
                   A test is performed against each set.
                   Multiple sets can specified as a comma separated list.

                3. &lt;x-y[:step]&gt;

                   A range of modulus sizes with an optional step value. Step defaults to 1 if omitted.
                   If  the  left value is greater than the right value, then the sequence operates from right to
              left.
                   A test is performed against each value in the range where it acts as the  minimum,  preferred
              and maximum modulus size.

              Duplicates are excluded from the return value.

       <b>-j,</b> <b>--json</b>
              Output  results  in  JSON  format.   Specify  twice  (-jj)  to  enable indent printing (useful for
              debugging).

       <b>-l,</b> <b>--level=&lt;info|warn|fail&gt;</b>
              Specify the minimum output level.  Default is info.

       <b>-L,</b> <b>--list-policies</b>
              List all official, built-in policies for common systems.  Their full names can then be  passed  to
              -P/--policy.  Add -v to -L to view policy change logs.

       <b>--lookup=&lt;alg1,alg2,...&gt;</b>
              Look up the security information of an algorithm(s) in the internal database.  Does not connect to
              a server.

       <b>-m,</b> <b>--manual</b>
              Print the man page (Docker, PyPI, Snap, and Windows builds only).

       <b>-M,</b> <b>--make-policy=&lt;custom_policy.txt&gt;</b>
              Creates  a policy based on the target server.  Useful when other servers should be compared to the
              target server's custom configuration (i.e.: a  cluster  environment).   Note  that  the  resulting
              policy can be edited manually.

       <b>-n,</b> <b>--no-colors</b>
              Disable color output.  Automatically set when the NO_COLOR environment variable is set.

       <b>-p,</b> <b>--port=&lt;port&gt;</b>
              The  TCP  port  to  connect  to  when  auditing a server, or the port to listen on when auditing a
              client.

       <b>-P,</b> <b>--policy=&lt;"built-in</b> <b>policy</b> <b>name"</b> <b>|</b> <b>path/to/custom_policy.txt&gt;</b>
              Runs a policy audit against a target using the specified policy  (see  <b>POLICY</b>  <b>AUDIT</b>  section  for
              detailed description of this mode of operation).  Combine with -c/--client-audit to audit a client
              configuration instead of a server.  Use -L/--list-policies to list all official, built-in policies
              for common systems.

       <b>--skip-rate-test</b>
              Skips  the  connection  rate test during standard audits.  By default, a few dozen TCP connections
              are created with the target host to see if connection throttling is implemented (this  can  safely
              infer whether the target is vulnerable to the DHEat attack; see CVE-2002-20001).

       <b>-t,</b> <b>--timeout=&lt;secs&gt;</b>
              The timeout, in seconds, for creating connections and reading data from the socket.  Default is 5.

       <b>-T,</b> <b>--targets=&lt;hosts.txt&gt;</b>
              A  file  containing  a  list  of  target  hosts.   Each  line must have one host, in the format of
              HOST[:PORT].  Use -p/--port to set the default port for  all  hosts.   Use  --threads  to  control
              concurrent scans.

       <b>--threads=&lt;threads&gt;</b>
              The number of threads to use when scanning multiple targets (with -T/--targets).  Default is 32.

       <b>-v,</b> <b>--verbose</b>
              Enable verbose output.

</pre><h4><b>STANDARD</b> <b>AUDIT</b></h4><pre>
       By  default,  <b>ssh-audit</b>  performs  a  standard  audit.   That  is,  it enumerates all host key types, key
       exchanges, ciphers,  MACs,  and  other  information,  then  color-codes  them  in  output  to  the  user.
       Cryptographic primitives with potential issues are displayed in yellow; primitives with serious flaws are
       displayed in red.

</pre><h4><b>POLICY</b> <b>AUDIT</b></h4><pre>
       When the -P/--policy option is used, <b>ssh-audit</b> performs a policy audit.  The target's host key types, key
       exchanges,  ciphers,  MACs,  and other information is compared to a set of expected values defined in the
       specified policy file.  If everything matches, only a short message stating a passing result is reported.
       Otherwise, the field(s) that did not match are reported.

       Policy auditing is helpful for ensuring a group of related servers are  properly  hardened  to  an  exact
       specification.

       The  set  of  official  built-in policies can be viewed with -L/--list-policies.  Multiple servers can be
       audited with -T/--targets=&lt;servers.txt&gt;.  Custom policies can be made from an ideal  target  server  with
       -M/--make-policy=&lt;custom_policy.txt&gt;.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Basic server auditing:
              ssh-audit localhost
              ssh-audit 127.0.0.1
              ssh-audit 127.0.0.1:222
              ssh-audit ::1
              ssh-audit [::1]:222

       To  run  a  standard  audit against many servers (place targets into servers.txt, one on each line in the
       format of HOST[:PORT]):
              ssh-audit -T servers.txt

       To audit a  client  configuration  (listens  on  port  2222  by  default;  connect  using  "ssh  -p  2222
       anything@localhost"):
              ssh-audit -c

       To audit a client configuration, with a listener on port 4567:
              ssh-audit -c -p 4567

       To list all official built-in policies (hint: use their full names with -P/--policy):
              ssh-audit -L

       To run a built-in policy audit against a server (hint: use -L to see list of built-in policies):
              ssh-audit -P "Hardened Ubuntu Server 20.04 LTS (version 1)" targetserver

       To  run  a  custom  policy  audit  against a server (hint: use -M/--make-policy to create a custom policy
       file):
              ssh-audit -P path/to/server_policy.txt targetserver

       To run a policy audit against a client:
              ssh-audit -c -P ["policy name" | path/to/client_policy.txt]

       To run a policy audit against many servers:
              ssh-audit -T servers.txt -P ["policy name" | path/to/server_policy.txt]

       To create a policy based on a target server (which can be manually edited; see official built-in policies
       for syntax examples):
              ssh-audit -M new_policy.txt targetserver

       To run a Diffie-Hellman Group Exchange modulus size test using the values 2000 bits, 3000 bits, 4000 bits
       and 5000 bits:
              ssh-audit targetserver --gex-test=2000,3000,4000,5000

       To run a Diffie-Hellman Group Exchange modulus size test where 2048 bits is the minimum, 3072 bits is the
       preferred and 5000 bits is the maximum:
              ssh-audit targetserver --gex-test=2048:3072:5000

       To run a Diffie-Hellman Group Exchange modulus size test from 0 bits to 5120 bits in increments  of  1024
       bits:
              ssh-audit targetserver --gex-test=0-5120:1024

       To  run  the  DHEat  DoS attack (monitor the target server's CPU usage to determine the optimal number of
       concurrent sockets):
              ssh-audit targetserver --dheat=10

       To run the DHEat attack and manually target the diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha256 algorithm:
              ssh-audit targetserver --dheat=10:diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha256

       To run the DHEat attack and manually target the  diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha256  algorithm  with  a
       very small length of e (resulting in the same effect but without having to send large packets):
              ssh-audit targetserver --dheat=10:diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha256:4

       To  test  the  number  of  successful  connections per second that can be created with the target using 8
       parallel threads (useful for detecting whether connection throttling is implemented by the target):
              ssh-audit targetserver --conn-rate-test=8

       To use 8 parallel threads to create up to  100  connections  per  second  with  the  target  (useful  for
       understanding  how  much  CPU load is caused on the target simply from handling new connections vs excess
       modular exponentiation when performing the DHEat attack):
              ssh-audit targetserver --conn-rate-test=8:100

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUES</b></h4><pre>
       When a successful connection is made and all algorithms are rated as "good", <b>ssh-audit</b> returns 0.   Other
       possible return values are:

              1 = connection error
              2 = at least one algorithm warning was found
              3 = at least one algorithm failure was found
              &lt;any other non-zero value&gt; = unknown error
