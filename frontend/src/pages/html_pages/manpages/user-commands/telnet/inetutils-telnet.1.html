</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       telnet — user interface to the TELNET protocol

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>telnet</b> [<u>options</u> <u>...</u>] [<u>host</u> [<u>port</u>]]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>telnet</b>  command  is  used  to communicate with another host using the TELNET protocol.  If <b>telnet</b> is
       invoked without the <u>host</u> argument, it enters command mode, indicated by its prompt  (<b>telnet&gt;</b>).   In  this
       mode, it accepts and executes the commands listed below.  If it is invoked with arguments, it performs an
       <b>open</b> command with those arguments.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-4,</b> <b>--ipv4</b>
               Use IPv4 to connect to hosts.

       <b>-6,</b> <b>--ipv6</b>
               Use IPv6 to connect to hosts.

       <b>-8</b>, <b>--binary</b>
               Specifies  an  8-bit  data path.  This causes an attempt to negotiate the TELNET BINARY option on
               both input and output.

       <b>-L</b>, <b>--binary-output</b>
               Specifies an 8-bit data path on output.  This causes  the  BINARY  option  to  be  negotiated  on
               output.

       <b>-e</b>, <b>--escape</b> <u>escape-char</u>
               Sets  the  initial  <b>telnet</b> escape character to <u>escape-char.</u> If <u>escape-char</u> is omitted, then there
               will be no escape character.

       <b>-E</b>, <b>--no-escape</b>
               Stops any character from being recognized as an escape character.

       <b>-a</b>, <b>--login</b>
               Attempt automatic login.  Currently, this sends the user  name  via  the  USER  variable  of  the
               ENVIRON  option  if supported by the remote system.  The name used is that of the current user as
               returned by <u><a href="../man2/getlogin.2.html">getlogin</a></u>(2) if it agrees  with  the  current  user  ID,  otherwise  it  is  the  name
               associated with the user ID.

       <b>-K</b>, <b>--no-login</b>
               Specifies no automatic login to the remote system.

       <b>-l</b>, <b>--user</b> <u>user</u>
               When  connecting  to the remote system, if the remote system understands the ENVIRON option, then
               <u>user</u> will be sent to the remote system as the value for the variable USER.  This  option  implies
               the <b>-a</b> option.  This option may also be used with the <b>open</b> command.

       <b>-n</b>, <b>--trace</b> <u>tracefile</u>
               Opens <u>tracefile</u> for recording trace information.  See the <b>set</b> <b>tracefile</b> command below.

       <b>-r</b>, <b>--rlogin</b>
               Specifies  a  user  interface similar to <u><a href="../man1/rlogin.1.html">rlogin</a></u>(1).  In this mode, the escape character is set to
               the tilde (~) character, unless modified by the -e option.

       <b>-c</b>, <b>--no-rc</b>
               Disables the reading of the user's <u>.telnetrc</u> file.  (See the <b>toggle</b> <b>skiprc</b> command  on  this  man
               page.)

       <b>-d</b>, <b>--debug</b>
               Sets the initial value of the <b>debug</b> toggle to TRUE

       <b>-x</b>, <b>--encrypt</b>
               Turns on encryption of the data stream if possible.

       <b>-X</b>, <b>--disable-auth</b> <u>atype</u>
               Disables the <u>atype</u> type of authentication.

       <b>-k</b>, <b>--realm</b> <u>realm</u>
               If  Kerberos  authentication is being used, the <b>-k</b> option requests that telnet obtain tickets for
               the  remote  host  in  realm  realm  instead  of  the  remote  host's  realm,  as  determined  by
               <u><a href="../man3/krb_realmofhost.3.html">krb_realmofhost</a></u>(3).

       <u>host</u>    Indicates the official name, an alias, or the Internet address of a remote host.

       <u>port</u>    Indicates  a  port number (address of an application).  If a number is not specified, the default
               <b>telnet</b> port is used.

</pre><h4><b>OPERATION</b></h4><pre>
       When in rlogin mode, a line of the form ~.  disconnects from the remote host;  ~  is  the  telnet  escape
       character.   Similarly,  the  line  ~^Z  suspends the telnet session.  The line ~^] escapes to the normal
       telnet escape prompt.

       Once a connection has been opened, <b>telnet</b> will attempt to enable the TELNET  LINEMODE  option.   If  this
       fails,  then  <b>telnet</b>  will revert to one of two input modes: either “character at a time” or “old line by
       line” depending on what the remote system supports.

       When LINEMODE is enabled, character processing is done on the local system,  under  the  control  of  the
       remote  system.   When input editing or character echoing is to be disabled, the remote system will relay
       that information.  The remote system will also relay changes to any special characters that happen on the
       remote system, so that they can take effect on the local system.

       In “character at a time” mode, most text typed is immediately sent to the remote host for processing.

       In “old line by line” mode, all text is echoed locally, and (normally) only completed lines are  sent  to
       the  remote  host.   The “local echo character” (initially “^E”) may be used to turn off and on the local
       echo (this would mostly be used to enter passwords without the password being echoed).

       If the LINEMODE option is enabled, or if the <b>localchars</b> toggle is TRUE (the  default  for  “old  line  by
       line“;  see  below),  the user's <b>quit</b>, <b>intr</b>, and <b>flush</b> characters are trapped locally, and sent as TELNET
       protocol sequences to the remote side.  If LINEMODE has ever been enabled, then the user's <b>susp</b>  and  <b>eof</b>
       are also sent as TELNET protocol sequences, and <b>quit</b> is sent as a TELNET ABORT instead of BREAK There are
       options  (see  <b>toggle</b>  <b>autoflush</b>  and <b>toggle</b> <b>autosynch</b> below) which cause this action to flush subsequent
       output to the terminal (until the remote host  acknowledges  the  TELNET  sequence)  and  flush  previous
       terminal input (in the case of <b>quit</b> and <b>intr</b>).

       While  connected  to  a  remote  host,  <b>telnet</b>  command  mode may be entered by typing the <b>telnet</b> “escape
       character” (initially “^]”).   When  in  command  mode,  the  normal  terminal  editing  conventions  are
       available.

       The following <b>telnet</b> commands are available.  Only enough of each command to uniquely identify it need be
       typed  (this  is  also  true  for  arguments  to  the <b>mode</b>, <b>set</b>, <b>toggle</b>, <b>unset</b>, <b>slc</b>, <b>environ</b>, and <b>display</b>
       commands).

       <b>auth</b> <u>argument</u> <u>...</u>
                  The auth command manipulates the information sent  through  the  TELNET  AUTHENTICATE  option.
                  Valid arguments for the auth command are as follows:

                  <b>disable</b> <u>type</u>  Disables  the  specified  type of authentication.  To obtain a list of available
                                types, use the <b>auth</b> <b>disable</b> <b>?</b> command.

                  <b>enable</b> <u>type</u>   Enables the specified type of authentication.  To obtain  a  list  of  available
                                types, use the <b>auth</b> <b>enable</b> <b>?</b> command.

                  <b>status</b>        Lists the current status of the various types of authentication.

       <b>close</b>      Close a TELNET session and return to command mode.

       <b>display</b> <u>argument</u> <u>...</u>
                  Displays all, or some, of the <b>set</b> and <b>toggle</b> values (see below).

       <b>encrypt</b> <u>argument</u> <u>...</u>
                  The encrypt command manipulates the information sent through the TELNET ENCRYPT option.

                  Note:   Because  of export controls, the TELNET ENCRYPT option is not supported outside of the
                  United States and Canada.

                  Valid arguments for the encrypt command are as follows:

                  <b>disable</b> <u>type</u> <b>[input|output]</b>
                                Disables the specified type of encryption.  If you omit the  input  and  output,
                                both  input  and  output are disabled.  To obtain a list of available types, use
                                the <b>encrypt</b> <b>disable</b> <b>?</b> command.

                  <b>enable</b> <u>type</u> <b>[input|output]</b>
                                Enables the specified type of encryption.  If you omit input  and  output,  both
                                input  and  output  are  enabled.   To obtain a list of available types, use the
                                <b>encrypt</b> <b>enable</b> <b>?</b> command.

                  <b>input</b>         This is the same as the <b>encrypt</b> <b>start</b> <b>input</b> command.

                  <b>-input</b>        This is the same as the <b>encrypt</b> <b>stop</b> <b>input</b> command.

                  <b>output</b>        This is the same as the <b>encrypt</b> <b>start</b> <b>output</b> command.

                  <b>-output</b>       This is the same as the <b>encrypt</b> <b>stop</b> <b>output</b> command.

                  <b>start</b> <b>[input|output]</b>
                                Attempts to start encryption.  If you omit <b>input</b>  and  <b>output,</b>  both  input  and
                                output are enabled.  To obtain a list of available types, use the <b>encrypt</b> <b>enable</b>
                                <b>?</b> command.

                  <b>status</b>        Lists the current status of encryption.

                  <b>stop</b> <b>[input|output]</b>
                                Stops encryption.  If you omit input and output, encryption is on both input and
                                output.

                  <b>type</b> <u>type</u>     Sets  the  default  type  of  encryption  to be used with later <b>encrypt</b> <b>start</b> or
                                <b>encrypt</b> <b>stop</b> commands.

       <b>environ</b> <u>arguments...</u>
                  The <b>environ</b> command is used to manipulate the the variables that my be sent through the TELNET
                  ENVIRON option.  The initial set of variables is taken from the users environment,  with  only
                  the  DISPLAY  and  PRINTER  variables  being  exported  by default.  The USER variable is also
                  exported if the <b>-a</b> or <b>-l</b> options are used.
                  Valid arguments for the <b>environ</b> command are:

                  <b>define</b> <u>variable</u> <u>value</u>
                              Define the variable <u>variable</u> to have a value of <u>value.</u> Any  variables  defined  by
                              this  command  are automatically exported.  The <u>value</u> may be enclosed in single or
                              double quotes so that tabs and spaces may be included.

                  <b>undefine</b> <u>variable</u>
                              Remove <u>variable</u> from the list of environment variables.

                  <b>export</b> <u>variable</u>
                              Mark the variable <u>variable</u> to be exported to the remote side.

                  <b>unexport</b> <u>variable</u>
                              Mark the variable <u>variable</u> to not be exported unless explicitly asked for  by  the
                              remote side.

                  <b>list</b>        List the current set of environment variables.  Those marked with a <b>*</b> will be sent
                              automatically, other variables will only be sent if explicitly requested.

                  <b>?</b>           Prints out help information for the <b>environ</b> command.

       <b>logout</b>     Sends  the  TELNET  LOGOUT  option  to  the  remote  side.  This command is similar to a <b>close</b>
                  command; however, if the remote side does not support the LOGOUT option, nothing happens.  If,
                  however, the remote side does support the LOGOUT option, this command should cause the  remote
                  side  to  close  the  TELNET  connection.   If  the  remote  side also supports the concept of
                  suspending a user's session for later reattachment, the logout  argument  indicates  that  you
                  should terminate the session immediately.

       <b>mode</b> <u>type</u>  <u>Type</u> is one of several options, depending on the state of the TELNET session.  The remote host
                  is  asked  for  permission  to  go  into the requested mode.  If the remote host is capable of
                  entering that mode, the requested mode will be entered.

                  <b>character</b>     Disable the TELNET LINEMODE option, or, if the remote side does  not  understand
                                the LINEMODE option, then enter “character at a time“ mode.

                  <b>line</b>          Enable  the  TELNET  LINEMODE option, or, if the remote side does not understand
                                the LINEMODE option, then attempt to enter “old-line-by-line“ mode.

                  <b>isig</b> (<b>-isig</b>)  Attempt to enable (disable) the TRAPSIG  mode  of  the  LINEMODE  option.   This
                                requires that the LINEMODE option be enabled.

                  <b>edit</b> (<b>-edit</b>)  Attempt to enable (disable) the EDIT mode of the LINEMODE option.  This requires
                                that the LINEMODE option be enabled.

                  <b>softtabs</b> (<b>-softtabs</b>)
                                Attempt  to  enable  (disable)  the  SOFT_TAB mode of the LINEMODE option.  This
                                requires that the LINEMODE option be enabled.

                  <b>litecho</b> (<b>-litecho</b>)
                                Attempt to enable (disable) the LIT_ECHO mode  of  the  LINEMODE  option.   This
                                requires that the LINEMODE option be enabled.

                  <b>?</b>             Prints out help information for the <b>mode</b> command.

       <b>open</b> <u>host</u> [[<b>-l</b>] <u>user</u>][<b>-</b> <u>port</u>]
                  Open  a  connection to the named host.  If no port number is specified, <b>telnet</b> will attempt to
                  contact a TELNET server at the default port.  The host specification may be either a host name
                  (see <u><a href="../man5/hosts.5.html">hosts</a></u>(5)) or an Internet address specified in the “dot notation” (see <u><a href="../man3/inet.3.html">inet</a></u>(3)).  The [<b>-l</b>]
                  option may be used to specify the user name to be passed to the remote system via the  ENVIRON
                  option.   When  connecting  to  a  non-standard port, <b>telnet</b> omits any automatic initiation of
                  TELNET options.  When the port number  is  preceded  by  a  minus  sign,  the  initial  option
                  negotiation  is  done.   After establishing a connection, the file <u>.telnetrc</u> in the users home
                  directory is opened.  Lines beginning with a # are comment lines.  Blank  lines  are  ignored.
                  Lines that begin without white space are the start of a machine entry.  The first thing on the
                  line  is  the  name  of  the  machine  that  is being connected to.  The rest of the line, and
                  successive lines that begin with white space  are  assumed  to  be  <b>telnet</b>  commands  and  are
                  processed as if they had been typed in manually to the <b>telnet</b> command prompt.

       <b>quit</b>       Close  any  open  TELNET  session and exit <b>telnet</b>.  An end of file (in command mode) will also
                  close a session and exit.

       <b>send</b> <u>arguments</u>
                  Sends one or more special character sequences to the  remote  host.   The  following  are  the
                  arguments which may be specified (more than one argument may be specified at a time):

                  <b>abort</b>   Sends the TELNET ABORT (Abort processes) sequence.

                  <b>ao</b>      Sends  the  TELNET AO (Abort Output) sequence, which should cause the remote system to
                          flush all output <u>from</u> the remote system <u>to</u> the user's terminal.

                  <b>ayt</b>     Sends the TELNET AYT (Are You There) sequence, to which the remote system may  or  may
                          not choose to respond.

                  <b>brk</b>     Sends  the  TELNET  BRK  (Break)  sequence,  which may have significance to the remote
                          system.

                  <b>ec</b>      Sends the TELNET EC (Erase Character) sequence, which should cause the  remote  system
                          to erase the last character entered.

                  <b>el</b>      Sends  the  TELNET  EL  (Erase Line) sequence, which should cause the remote system to
                          erase the line currently being entered.

                  <b>eof</b>     Sends the TELNET EOF (End Of File) sequence.

                  <b>eor</b>     Sends the TELNET EOR (End of Record) sequence.

                  <b>escape</b>  Sends the current <b>telnet</b> escape character (initially “^”).

                  <b>ga</b>      Sends the TELNET GA (Go Ahead) sequence, which  likely  has  no  significance  to  the
                          remote system.

                  <b>getstatus</b>
                          If  the  remote  side  supports  the  TELNET  STATUS  command, <b>getstatus</b> will send the
                          subnegotiation to request that the server send its current option status.

                  <b>ip</b>      Sends the TELNET IP (Interrupt Process) sequence, which should cause the remote system
                          to abort the currently running process.

                  <b>nop</b>     Sends the TELNET NOP (No OPeration) sequence.

                  <b>susp</b>    Sends the TELNET SUSP (SUSPend process) sequence.

                  <b>synch</b>   Sends the TELNET SYNCH sequence.  This sequence causes the remote  system  to  discard
                          all  previously  typed  (but not yet read) input.  This sequence is sent as TCP urgent
                          data (and may not work if the remote system is a 4.2BSD system -- if it doesn't  work,
                          a lower case “r” may be echoed on the terminal).

                  <b>do</b> <u>cmd</u>

                  <b>dont</b> <u>cmd</u>

                  <b>will</b> <u>cmd</u>

                  <b>wont</b> <u>cmd</u>
                          Sends  the  TELNET  DO <u>cmd</u> sequence.  <u>Cmd</u> can be either a decimal number between 0 and
                          255, or a symbolic name for a specific TELNET command.  <u>Cmd</u> can also be either <b>help</b> or
                          <b>?</b> to print out help information, including a list of known symbolic names.

                  <b>?</b>       Prints out help information for the <b>send</b> command.

       <b>set</b> <u>argument</u> <u>value</u>

       <b>unset</b> <u>argument</u> <u>value</u>
                  The <b>set</b> command will set any one of a number of <b>telnet</b> variables to a  specific  value  or  to
                  TRUE.   The  special  value  <b>off</b>  turns off the function associated with the variable, this is
                  equivalent to using the <b>unset</b> command.  The <b>unset</b> command will disable or set to FALSE any  of
                  the  specified  functions.   The  values  of  variables  may  be interrogated with the <b>display</b>
                  command.  The variables which may be set or unset, but  not  toggled,  are  listed  here.   In
                  addition, any of the variables for the <b>toggle</b> command may be explicitly set or unset using the
                  <b>set</b> and <b>unset</b> commands.

                  <b>ayt</b>     If  TELNET  is in localchars mode, or LINEMODE is enabled, and the status character is
                          typed, a TELNET AYT sequence (see <b>send</b> <b>ayt</b> preceding) is sent to the remote host.  The
                          initial value for the "Are You There" character is the terminal's status character.

                  <b>echo</b>    This is the value (initially “^E”) which, when in “line by line” mode, toggles between
                          doing local echoing of entered characters (for  normal  processing),  and  suppressing
                          echoing of entered characters (for entering, say, a password).

                  <b>eof</b>     If <b>telnet</b> is operating in LINEMODE or “old line by line” mode, entering this character
                          as  the  first  character on a line will cause this character to be sent to the remote
                          system.  The initial value of the eof character is taken  to  be  the  terminal's  <b>eof</b>
                          character.

                  <b>erase</b>   If  <b>telnet</b>  is  in  <b>localchars</b>  mode  (see  <b>toggle</b> <b>localchars</b> below), <b>and</b> if <b>telnet</b> is
                          operating in “character at a time” mode, then when this character is typed,  a  TELNET
                          EC  sequence  (see <b>send</b> <b>ec</b> above) is sent to the remote system.  The initial value for
                          the erase character is taken to be the terminal's <b>erase</b> character.

                  <b>escape</b>  This is the <b>telnet</b> escape character (initially “^[”) which causes  entry  into  <b>telnet</b>
                          command mode (when connected to a remote system).

                  <b>flushoutput</b>
                          If  <b>telnet</b>  is  in  <b>localchars</b>  mode (see <b>toggle</b> <b>localchars</b> below) and the <b>flushoutput</b>
                          character is typed, a TELNET AO sequence (see <b>send</b> <b>ao</b> above) is  sent  to  the  remote
                          host.   The  initial value for the flush character is taken to be the terminal's <b>flush</b>
                          character.

                  <b>forw1</b>

                  <b>forw2</b>   If TELNET is operating in LINEMODE, these are the characters that, when  typed,  cause
                          partial  lines  to  be  forwarded  to  the  remote  system.  The initial value for the
                          forwarding characters are taken from the terminal's eol and eol2 characters.

                  <b>interrupt</b>
                          If <b>telnet</b> is in <b>localchars</b> mode  (see  <b>toggle</b>  <b>localchars</b>  below)  and  the  <b>interrupt</b>
                          character  is  typed,  a  TELNET IP sequence (see <b>send</b> <b>ip</b> above) is sent to the remote
                          host.  The initial value for the interrupt character is taken  to  be  the  terminal's
                          <b>intr</b> character.

                  <b>kill</b>    If  <b>telnet</b>  is  in  <b>localchars</b>  mode  (see  <b>toggle</b> <b>localchars</b> below), <b>and</b> if <b>telnet</b> is
                          operating in “character at a time” mode, then when this character is typed,  a  TELNET
                          EL  sequence  (see <b>send</b> <b>el</b> above) is sent to the remote system.  The initial value for
                          the kill character is taken to be the terminal's <b>kill</b> character.

                  <b>lnext</b>   If <b>telnet</b> is operating in LINEMODE or “old line by line“ mode, then this character  is
                          taken to be the terminal's <b>lnext</b> character.  The initial value for the lnext character
                          is taken to be the terminal's <b>lnext</b> character.

                  <b>quit</b>    If  <b>telnet</b>  is in <b>localchars</b> mode (see <b>toggle</b> <b>localchars</b> below) and the <b>quit</b> character
                          is typed, a TELNET BRK sequence (see <b>send</b> <b>brk</b> above) is sent to the remote host.   The
                          initial value for the quit character is taken to be the terminal's <b>quit</b> character.

                  <b>reprint</b>
                          If  <b>telnet</b> is operating in LINEMODE or “old line by line“ mode, then this character is
                          taken to be the terminal's <b>reprint</b> character.   The  initial  value  for  the  reprint
                          character is taken to be the terminal's <b>reprint</b> character.

                  <b>rlogin</b>  This  is  the  rlogin escape character.  If set, the normal TELNET escape character is
                          ignored unless it is preceded by this character at the  beginning  of  a  line.   This
                          character,  at  the beginning of a line followed by a "."  closes the connection; when
                          followed by a ^Z it suspends the telnet command.  The initial state is to disable  the
                          rlogin escape character.

                  <b>start</b>   If  the  TELNET  TOGGLE-FLOW-CONTROL  option  has been enabled, then this character is
                          taken to be the terminal's <b>start</b> character.  The initial value for the kill  character
                          is taken to be the terminal's <b>start</b> character.

                  <b>stop</b>    If  the  TELNET  TOGGLE-FLOW-CONTROL  option  has been enabled, then this character is
                          taken to be the terminal's <b>stop</b> character.  The initial value for the  kill  character
                          is taken to be the terminal's <b>stop</b> character.

                  <b>susp</b>    If  <b>telnet</b> is in <b>localchars</b> mode, or LINEMODE is enabled, and the <b>suspend</b> character is
                          typed, a TELNET SUSP sequence (see <b>send</b> <b>susp</b> above) is sent to the remote  host.   The
                          initial  value  for  the  suspend  character  is  taken  to  be the terminal's <b>suspend</b>
                          character.

                  <b>tracefile</b>
                          This is the file to which the output, caused by <b>netdata</b> or <b>option</b> tracing being  TRUE,
                          will  be  written.   If  it is set to “<b>-</b>”, then tracing information will be written to
                          standard output (the default).

                  <b>worderase</b>
                          If <b>telnet</b> is operating in LINEMODE or “old line by line“ mode, then this character  is
                          taken  to  be the terminal's <b>worderase</b> character.  The initial value for the worderase
                          character is taken to be the terminal's <b>worderase</b> character.

                  <b>?</b>       Displays the legal <b>set</b> (<b>unset</b>) commands.

       <b>slc</b> <u>state</u>  The <b>slc</b> command (Set Local Characters) is used to set or change the state of the  the  special
                  characters  when  the  TELNET  LINEMODE  option  has  been  enabled.   Special  characters are
                  characters that get mapped to TELNET commands sequences (like <b>ip</b>  or  <b>quit</b>)  or  line  editing
                  characters (like <b>erase</b> and <b>kill</b>).  By default, the local special characters are exported.

                  <b>check</b>       Verify  the  current settings for the current special characters.  The remote side
                              is requested to send all the current special character settings, and if there  are
                              any  discrepancies  with  the local side, the local side will switch to the remote
                              value.

                  <b>export</b>      Switch to the local defaults  for  the  special  characters.   The  local  default
                              characters are those of the local terminal at the time when <b>telnet</b> was started.

                  <b>import</b>      Switch  to  the  remote  defaults  for the special characters.  The remote default
                              characters are those of the remote system at the time when the  TELNET  connection
                              was established.

                  <b>?</b>           Prints out help information for the <b>slc</b> command.

       <b>status</b>     Show the current status of <b>telnet</b>.  This includes the peer one is connected to, as well as the
                  current mode.

       <b>toggle</b> <u>arguments</u> <u>...</u>
                  Toggle  (between  TRUE  and  FALSE)  various flags that control how <b>telnet</b> responds to events.
                  These flags may be set explicitly to TRUE or FALSE using the <b>set</b>  and  <b>unset</b>  commands  listed
                  above.  More than one argument may be specified.  The state of these flags may be interrogated
                  with the <b>display</b> command.  Valid arguments are:

                  <b>authdebug</b>     Turns on debugging information for the authentication code.

                  <b>autoflush</b>     If  <b>autoflush</b> and <b>localchars</b> are both TRUE, then when the <b>ao</b>, or <b>quit</b> characters
                                are recognized (and  transformed  into  TELNET  sequences;  see  <b>set</b>  above  for
                                details),  <b>telnet</b>  refuses  to display any data on the user's terminal until the
                                remote system acknowledges (via  a  TELNET  TIMING  MARK  option)  that  it  has
                                processed  those TELNET sequences.  The initial value for this toggle is TRUE if
                                the terminal user had not done an "stty noflsh", otherwise FALSE (see <u><a href="../man1/stty.1.html">stty</a></u>(1)).

                  <b>autodecrypt</b>   When the TELNET ENCRYPT option is negotiated, by default the  actual  encryption
                                (decryption)  of  the data stream does not start automatically.  The autoencrypt
                                (autodecrypt) command states that encryption of the output (input) stream should
                                be enabled as soon as possible.

                                Note:  Because of export controls, the TELNET ENCRYPT option  is  not  supported
                                outside the United States and Canada.

                  <b>autologin</b>     If  the remote side supports the TELNET AUTHENTICATION option TELNET attempts to
                                use it to perform automatic authentication.  If the AUTHENTICATION option is not
                                supported, the user's login name  are  propagated  through  the  TELNET  ENVIRON
                                option.  This command is the same as specifying <u>a</u> option on the <b>open</b> command.

                  <b>autosynch</b>     If  <b>autosynch</b>  and  <b>localchars</b>  are both TRUE, then when either the <b>intr</b> or <b>quit</b>
                                characters is typed (see <b>set</b>  above  for  descriptions  of  the  <b>intr</b>  and  <b>quit</b>
                                characters),  the resulting TELNET sequence sent is followed by the TELNET SYNCH
                                sequence.  This procedure <b>should</b> cause the remote system to begin throwing  away
                                all previously typed input until both of the TELNET sequences have been read and
                                acted upon.  The initial value of this toggle is FALSE.

                  <b>binary</b>        Enable or disable the TELNET BINARY option on both input and output.

                  <b>inbinary</b>      Enable or disable the TELNET BINARY option on input.

                  <b>outbinary</b>     Enable or disable the TELNET BINARY option on output.

                  <b>crlf</b>          If  this  is  TRUE,  then carriage returns will be sent as <b>&lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt;</b>.  If this is
                                FALSE, then carriage returns will be send as <b>&lt;CR&gt;&lt;NUL&gt;</b>.  The initial  value  for
                                this toggle is FALSE.

                  <b>crmod</b>         Toggle  carriage  return  mode.  When this mode is enabled, most carriage return
                                characters received from the remote host will be mapped into a  carriage  return
                                followed  by  a  line feed.  This mode does not affect those characters typed by
                                the user, only those received from the remote  host.   This  mode  is  not  very
                                useful  unless  the remote host only sends carriage return, but never line feed.
                                The initial value for this toggle is FALSE.

                  <b>debug</b>         Toggles socket level debugging (useful only to the  <b>super</b>  <b>user</b>).   The  initial
                                value for this toggle is FALSE.

                  <b>encdebug</b>      Turns on debugging information for the encryption code.

                  <b>localchars</b>    If  this  is  TRUE,  then the <b>flush</b>, <b>interrupt</b>, <b>quit</b>, <b>erase</b>, and <b>kill</b> characters
                                (see <b>set</b>  above)  are  recognized  locally,  and  transformed  into  (hopefully)
                                appropriate  TELNET control sequences (respectively <b>ao</b>, <b>ip</b>, <b>brk</b>, <b>ec</b>, and <b>el</b>; see
                                <b>send</b> above).  The initial value for this toggle is TRUE in “old  line  by  line”
                                mode,  and  FALSE  in  “character  at a time” mode.  When the LINEMODE option is
                                enabled, the value of <b>localchars</b> is ignored, and assumed to always be TRUE.   If
                                LINEMODE  has ever been enabled, then <b>quit</b> is sent as <b>abort</b>, and <b>eof</b> <b>and</b> <b>suspend</b>
                                are sent as <b>eof</b> <b>and</b> <b>susp</b>, see <b>send</b> above).

                  <b>netdata</b>       Toggles the display of all network data (in hexadecimal  format).   The  initial
                                value for this toggle is FALSE.

                  <b>options</b>       Toggles  the  display  of some internal <b>telnet</b> protocol processing (having to do
                                with TELNET options).  The initial value for this toggle is FALSE.

                  <b>prettydump</b>    When the <b>netdata</b> toggle is enabled, if <b>prettydump</b> is enabled the output from the
                                <b>netdata</b> command will be formatted in a more user readable  format.   Spaces  are
                                put between each character in the output, and the beginning of any TELNET escape
                                sequence is preceded by a '*' to aid in locating them.

                  <b>skiprc</b>        When  the  skiprc toggle is TRUE, TELNET skips the reading of the <u>.telnetrc</u> file
                                in the users home directory when connections are opened.  The initial value  for
                                this toggle is FALSE.

                  <b>termdata</b>      Toggles  the  display of all terminal data (in hexadecimal format).  The initial
                                value for this toggle is FALSE.

                  <b>verbose_encrypt</b>
                                When the <b>verbose_encrypt</b> toggle is TRUE, TELNET prints out a message  each  time
                                encryption  is enabled or disabled.  The initial value for this toggle is FALSE.
                                Note:  Because of export controls, data encryption is not supported  outside  of

       remote system) when it is the first character on a line.
