</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       ssh-askpass — an X11-based pass-phrase dialog for use with OpenSSH

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ssh-askpass</b> [options] [label]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ssh-askpass</b>  is  an  X11-based pass-phrase dialog for use with OpenSSH.  It is intended to be called from
       the <u><a href="../man1/ssh-add.1.html">ssh-add</a></u>(1) program and not invoked directly.

       <b>ssh-askpass</b> supports most standard Toolkit command line  arguments,  with  the  exception  of  <u>-geometry</u>,
       <u>-borderwidth</u>, <u>-iconic</u>, <u>-rv</u>, and <u>-title</u>.  See <u><a href="../man1/X.1.html">X</a></u>(1).

       If exactly one non-option argument is provided on the command line, it is displayed in the dialog instead
       of the default label.  If the argument contains newline characters ('\n'), each line of text is displayed
       on a separate line in the dialog.

       The features of <b>ssh-askpass</b> are as follows:

             <b>-</b>   Configurable   via   the   standard   X  resource  mechanisms  <u>/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/app-defaults</u>,
                 <u><a href="file:~/.Xdefaults">~/.Xdefaults</a></u>, <u><a href="../man1/xrdb.1.html">xrdb</a></u>(1), etc.

             <b>-</b>   Requires only stock X11 libraries (libXt, libX11, libSM, libICE).

             <b>-</b>   Can be configured to grab the keyboard and/or pointer (grabs the keyboard by default,  not  the
                 pointer).

       The  user  interface is somewhat different than most password/pass-phrase dialogs and more similar to the
       X11-based pass-phrase dialog that accompanies the regular SSH distribution.  Instead of a text field that
       fills with asterisks or some other character as the user enters the pass-phrase,  a  series  of  LED-like
       areas  light  up one-by-one with each pass-phrase character entered, beginning from the left-hand edge of
       the dialog.  When they reach the right-hand edge, they go dark one-by-one again, and so on.   This  gives
       the  user  feedback  that pass-phrase characters have been entered, but does not provide onlookers with a
       cue as to the length of the pass-phrase.

       Pressing the ‘OK’ button accepts the pass-phrase (even if it is empty), which is printed on the  standard
       output,  and the dialog exits with a status of zero (success).  Pressing the ‘Cancel’ button discards the
       pass-phrase, and the dialog exits with non-zero status.

       The following keystrokes work as expected:

             [Backspace]
             [Delete]     Erase previous character

             [Control+U]
             [Control+X]  Erase entire pass-phrase

             [Enter]
             [Control+M]
             [Control+J]  Accept pass-phrase (OK)

             [Escape]     Discard pass-phrase (Cancel)

</pre><h4><b>RESOURCES</b></h4><pre>
       The following resources are used to customize the application globally:

             <b>grabKeyboard</b> (class <b>GrabKeyboard</b>)
                 specifies if the application should grab the keyboard.
                 Default value: “True”.

             <b>grabPointer</b> (class <b>GrabPointer</b>)
                 specifies if the application should grab the pointer.
                 Default value: “False”.

             <b>grabServer</b> (class <b>GrabServer</b>)
                 specifies if the application should grab the server.
                 Default value: “False”.

             <b>inputTimeout</b> (class <b>InputTimeout</b>)
                 the  number of seconds <b>ssh-askpass</b> should wait for a key or button press before it gives up and
                 exits.  A timeout of “0” means wait forever.
                 Default value: “0”.

             <b>defaultXResolution</b> (class <b>DefaultXResolution</b>)
                 the number of pixels per unit length that horizontal spacing and width values are intended for.
                 If the actual horizontal (x) resolution of the X server is significantly greater or  less  than
                 this  value,  portions  of  the  dialog,  indicator, and button widgets are stretched or shrunk
                 horizontally to take the difference into account. The value is a positive integer, followed  by
                 a  slash  (<b>/</b>)  and a one- or two-character unit abbreviation.  Valid units are inches (<b>in</b> or <b>i</b>)
                 and meters (<b>m</b>).
                 Default value: “75/in” (75 pixels per inch).

             <b>defaultYResolution</b> (class <b>DefaultYResolution</b>)
                 the number of pixels per unit length that vertical spacing and height values are intended  for.
                 If  the  actual  vertical  (y) resolution of the X server is significantly greater or less than
                 this value, portions of the dialog, indicator, and  button  widgets  are  stretched  or  shrunk
                 vertically   to   take  the  difference  into  account.  Valid  values  are  the  same  as  for
                 <b>defaultXResolution</b> above.
                 Default value: “75/in” (75 pixels per inch).

             <b>xResolutionFuzz</b> (class <b>XResolutionFuzz</b>)
                 the range of “fuzz” around the value of <b>defaultXResolution</b> beyond which some  widgets  will  be
                 stretched  or shrunk horizontally to fit the current actual horizontal resolution. Valid values
                 are the same as for <b>defaultXResolution</b>.  For example, if the default X resolution  is  “75/in”,
                 and  the  X  resolution  fuzz  is “50/in”, then widgets won't be scaled horizontally unless the
                 actual horizontal resolution is less than 25 pixels per inch or greater  than  125  pixels  per
                 inch.
                 Default value: “20/in” (20 pixels per inch).

             <b>yResolutionFuzz</b> (class <b>YResolutionFuzz</b>)
                 the  range  of  “fuzz” around the value of <b>defaultYResolution</b> beyond which some widgets will be
                 stretched or shrunk vertically to fit the current actual vertical resolution. Valid values  are
                 the same as for <b>defaultXResolution</b> above.
                 Default value: “20/in” (20 pixels per inch).

       The following resources are recognized by the Dialog widget:

             <b>title</b> (class <b>Title</b>)
                 The title of the application as specified to the window manager.

             <b>label</b> (class <b>Label</b>)
                 The label displayed above the led indicators.

             <b>font</b> (class <b>Font</b>)
                 The font to be used to display the label.

       The  following  Resources are recognized by the dialog, button, and indicator widgets and the main widget
       to customize the 3D appearance (all measurements are in pixels):

             <b>foreground</b> (class <b>Foreground</b>)
                 The foreground color of the widget.  This is the text color of the label for buttons and dialog

             <b>background</b> (class <b>Background</b>)
                 The background color of the widget.  In the case of the indicator this  is  the  color  of  the
                 inactive led.

                 The color used by the sides of the widget in the shadow (right and bottom).

             <b>shadowThickness</b> (class <b>ShadowTickness</b>)
                 The thickness of the 3D border of the widget.
