</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       <b>qflow</b> - Open-Source Digital Synthesis Flow

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>qflow</b> [<u>processes</u>] [<u>options</u>] &lt;module_name&gt;

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This  is  the  main  executable for a complete tool chain for synthesizing digital circuits starting from
       verilog source and ending in physical layout for a specific target fabrication process. In the  world  of
       commercial  electronics,  digital synthesis with a target application of a chip design is usually bundled
       into large EDA software systems. As  commercial  electronics  designers  need  to  maintain  cutting-edge
       performance,  these commercial toolchains get more and more expensive, and have largely priced themselves
       out of all but the established integrated circuit manufacturers. This leaves  an  unfortunate  gap  where
       startup companies and small businesses cannot afford to do any sort of integrated circuit design.

       Qflow tries to fill this gap.

</pre><h4><b>PROCESSES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>synthesize</b>
              Synthesize verilog source

       <b>place</b>  Run initial placement

       <b>sta</b>    Static timing analysis

       <b>route</b>  Run placement and route

       <b>decongest</b>
              Run congestion analysis, final place and route

       <b>clean</b>  Remove temporary working files

       <b>display</b>
              Display routed result

       <b>build</b>  Run scripts synthesize to route

       <b>all</b>    Run scripts synthesize to display

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-T,</b> <b>--tech</b> <b>&lt;name&gt;</b>
              Use technology &lt;name&gt;  (Default: osu035)

       <b>-p,</b> <b>--project</b> <b>&lt;name&gt;</b>
              Project root directory is &lt;name&gt;

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       The simplest way to use <b>qflow</b> is to be in a directory with one Verilog file called input.v and execute:

          qflow build input.v

       This will run all the necessary steps in order to produce a layout of the specified Verilog file. If only
       certain steps are desired, one may first run:

          qflow input.v

       and then open qflow_exec.sh and uncomment the desired steps, and at last run:

          ./qflow_exec.sh

       It  is  also  possible  to  change  other  "project-specific"  details  in  the  files  qflow_vars.sh and
       project_vars.sh which also have been created in the current directory.

</pre><h4><b>TECHNOLOGY</b></h4><pre>
       <b>qflow</b> looks for technology files under <a href="file:/usr/share/">/usr/share/</a><b>qflow</b>/tech. A shell script must  be  placed  in  a  sub
       directory there declaring where each of the technology files are located:

         /usr/share/qflow/tech/[TECHNAME]/[TECHNAME].sh

       Usually, the files needed are placed in the following locations:

         /usr/share/qflow/tech/[TECHNAME]/SCN4M_SUBM.20.tech
         /usr/share/qflow/tech/[TECHNAME]/[TECHNAME].magicrc
         /usr/share/qflow/tech/[TECHNAME]/[TECHNAME].prm
         /usr/share/qflow/tech/[TECHNAME]/[TECHNAME]_stdcells.v
         /usr/share/qflow/tech/[TECHNAME]/[TECHNAME]_stdcells.lef
         /usr/share/qflow/tech/[TECHNAME]/[TECHNAME].par
         /usr/share/qflow/tech/[TECHNAME]/[TECHNAME]_stdcells.sp
         /usr/share/qflow/tech/[TECHNAME]/[TECHNAME]_stdcells.lib

       If  no technology name is specified on the command line with the <b>-T</b>/<b>--tech</b> option, it will attempt to use
       the default technology which is "osu035".

       If the technology files are located somewhere else, this can  be  specified  in  qflow_vars.sh  which  is
       created when running <b>qflow</b>. The variables "techdir" and "techname" must be changed accordingly.
