</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       <b>retry</b> - Repeat command until a criteria is met, usually success.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>retry</b> [<b>-v</b>] [<b>-h</b>] [<b>-u</b> <u>until</u>] [<b>-w</b> <u>while</u>] <u>command</u> ...

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The tool repeats the given <u>command</u> <u>until</u> the <u>command</u> is successful, backing off with a configurable delay
       between each attempt.

       Retry  captures  stdin into memory as the data is passed to the repeated <u>command</u>, and this captured stdin
       is then replayed should the <u>command</u> be repeated. This makes it possible to  embed  the  <b>retry</b>  tool  into
       shell pipelines.

       Retry  captures  stdout  into  memory, and if the <u>command</u> was successful stdout is passed on to stdout as
       normal, <u>while</u> if the <u>command</u> was repeated stdout is passed to stderr instead. This ensures that output is
       passed to stdout once and once only.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-d</b> <b>seconds,</b> <b>--delay=seconds</b>
              The number of seconds to back off after  each  attempt.  Multiple  comma  separated  delays  allow
              subsequent delays to be different, with the last delay repeated.

       <b>-m</b> <b>message,</b> <b>--message=message</b>
              A message to include in the notification when repeat has backed off. Defaults to the <u>command</u> name.

       <b>-t</b> <b>times,</b> <b>--times=times</b>
              The number of times to <b>retry</b> the <u>command</u>. By default we try forever.

       <b>-u</b> <b>criteria,</b> <b>--</b><u>until</u><b>=criteria</b>
              Keep  repeating the <u>command</u> <u>until</u> any one of the comma separated criteria is met.  Options include
              'success', 'true', 'fail', ’false', an integer or a range of integers.  Default is 'success'.

       <b>-w</b> <b>criteria,</b> <b>--</b><u>while</u><b>=criteria</b>
              Keep repeating the <u>command</u> <u>while</u> any one of the comma separated criteria is met.  Options  include
              'success', 'true', 'fail', ’false', an integer or a range of integers.

       <b>-h,</b> <b>--help</b>
              Display this help message.

       <b>-v,</b> <b>--version</b>
              Display the version number.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>retry</b> tool returns the return code from the <u>command</u> being executed, once the criteria is reached.

       If the <u>command</u> was interrupted with a signal, the return code is the signal number plus 128.

       If the <u>command</u> could not be executed, or if the options are invalid, the status 1 is returned.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       In this basic example, we repeat the <u>command</u> forever.

               ~$ retry --until=success -- false
               retry: 'false' returned 1, backing off for 10 seconds and trying again...
               retry: 'false' returned 1, backing off for 10 seconds and trying again...
               retry: 'false' returned 1, backing off for 10 seconds and trying again...

   <b>^C</b>
       In  this  more  complex  example,  each invocation of curl is retried <u>until</u> curl succeeds, at which point
       stdout is passed once and once only to the next element in the pipeline.

               ~$ retry -- curl --fail <a href="http://localhost/entities">http://localhost/entities</a> | \
               jq ... | \
               retry -- curl --fail -X POST <a href="http://localhost/resource">http://localhost/resource</a> | \
               logger -t resource-init

       In this example, we stagger each delay exponentially <u>until</u> 64  seconds,  which  is  then  repeated  <u>until</u>
       interrupted.

               ~$ retry --until=success --delay "1,2,4,8,16,32,64" -- false
               retry: false returned 1, backing off for 1 second and trying again...
               retry: false returned 1, backing off for 2 seconds and trying again...
               retry: false returned 1, backing off for 4 seconds and trying again...
               retry: false returned 1, backing off for 8 seconds and trying again...
               retry: false returned 1, backing off for 16 seconds and trying again...
               retry: false returned 1, backing off for 32 seconds and trying again...
               retry: false returned 1, backing off for 64 seconds and trying again...
               retry: false returned 1, backing off for 64 seconds and trying again...
               retry: false returned 1, backing off for 64 seconds and trying again...
