</pre><h4><b>PROLOG</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       cut — cut out selected fields of each line of a file

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       cut -b <u>list</u> <b>[</b>-n<b>]</b> <b>[</b><u>file</u>...<b>]</b>

       cut -c <u>list</u> <b>[</b><u>file</u>...<b>]</b>

       cut -f <u>list</u> <b>[</b>-d <u>delim</u><b>]</b> <b>[</b>-s<b>]</b> <b>[</b><u>file</u>...<b>]</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>cut</u>  utility  shall cut out bytes (<b>-b</b> option), characters (<b>-c</b> option), or character-delimited fields
       (<b>-f</b> option) from each line in one or more files, concatenate them, and write them to standard output.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>cut</u> utility shall conform to the Base Definitions  volume  of  POSIX.1‐2017,  <u>Section</u>  <u>12.2</u>,  <u>Utility</u>
       <u>Syntax</u> <u>Guidelines</u>.

       The  application  shall  ensure  that  the  option-argument  <u>list</u> (see options <b>-b</b>, <b>-c</b>, and <b>-f</b> below) is a
       &lt;comma&gt;-separated list or &lt;blank&gt;-separated list of positive numbers and ranges. Ranges can be  in  three
       forms.  The  first is two positive numbers separated by a &lt;hyphen-minus&gt; (<u>low</u>-<u>high</u>), which represents all
       fields from the first number to the second number. The second is a positive number preceded by a &lt;hyphen-
       minus&gt; (-<u>high</u>), which represents all fields from field number 1 to that number. The third is  a  positive
       number  followed  by  a &lt;hyphen-minus&gt; (<u>low</u>-), which represents that number to the last field, inclusive.
       The elements in <u>list</u> can be repeated, can overlap, and can be specified in  any  order,  but  the  bytes,
       characters,  or fields selected shall be written in the order of the input data. If an element appears in
       the selection list more than once, it shall be written exactly once.

       The following options shall be supported:

       <b>-b</b> <u>list</u>   Cut based on a <u>list</u> of bytes. Each selected byte shall be output unless the <b>-n</b> option  is  also
                 specified. It shall not be an error to select bytes not present in the input line.

       <b>-c</b> <u>list</u>   Cut  based on a <u>list</u> of characters. Each selected character shall be output. It shall not be an
                 error to select characters not present in the input line.

       <b>-d</b> <u>delim</u>  Set the field delimiter to the character <u>delim</u>.  The default is the &lt;tab&gt;.

       <b>-f</b> <u>list</u>   Cut based on a <u>list</u> of fields, assumed to be separated in the file  by  a  delimiter  character
                 (see  <b>-d</b>).   Each  selected field shall be output. Output fields shall be separated by a single
                 occurrence of the field delimiter character. Lines with no field  delimiters  shall  be  passed
                 through  intact,  unless <b>-s</b> is specified. It shall not be an error to select fields not present
                 in the input line.

       <b>-n</b>        Do not split characters. When specified with the <b>-b</b> option, each element in <u>list</u>  of  the  form
                 <u>low</u>-<u>high</u> (&lt;hyphen-minus&gt;-separated numbers) shall be modified as follows:

                  *  If  the byte selected by <u>low</u> is not the first byte of a character, <u>low</u> shall be decremented
                     to select the first byte of the character originally selected by <u>low</u>.  If the byte selected
                     by <u>high</u> is not the last byte of a character, <u>high</u> shall be decremented to select  the  last
                     byte  of the character prior to the character originally selected by <u>high</u>, or zero if there
                     is no prior character. If the resulting range element has <u>high</u> equal to zero or <u>low</u> greater
                     than <u>high</u>, the list element shall be dropped from <u>list</u> for that input line without  causing
                     an error.

                 Each  element in <u>list</u> of the form <u>low</u>- shall be treated as above with <u>high</u> set to the number of
                 bytes in the current line, not including the terminating &lt;newline&gt;.  Each element  in  <u>list</u>  of
                 the  form  -<u>high</u>  shall be treated as above with <u>low</u> set to 1. Each element in <u>list</u> of the form
                 <u>num</u> (a single number) shall be treated as above with <u>low</u> set to <u>num</u> and <u>high</u> set to <u>num</u>.

       <b>-s</b>        Suppress lines with no delimiter characters, when used with the <b>-f</b>  option.  Unless  specified,
                 lines with no delimiters shall be passed through untouched.

</pre><h4><b>OPERANDS</b></h4><pre>
       The following operand shall be supported:

       <u>file</u>      A  pathname  of  an input file. If no <u>file</u> operands are specified, or if a <u>file</u> operand is <b>'-'</b>,
                 the standard input shall be used.

</pre><h4><b>STDIN</b></h4><pre>
       The standard input shall be used only if no <u>file</u> operands are specified, or if a  <u>file</u>  operand  is  <b>'-'</b>.
       See the INPUT FILES section.

</pre><h4><b>INPUT</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       The input files shall be text files, except that line lengths shall be unlimited.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of <u>cut</u>:

       <u>LANG</u>      Provide a default value for the internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See the
                 Base  Definitions  volume  of POSIX.1‐2017, <u>Section</u> <u>8.2</u>, <u>Internationalization</u> <u>Variables</u> for the
                 precedence  of  internationalization  variables  used  to  determine  the  values   of   locale
                 categories.)

       <u>LC_ALL</u>    If  set  to a non-empty string value, override the values of all the other internationalization
                 variables.

       <u>LC_CTYPE</u>  Determine the locale for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of text  data  as  characters
                 (for example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments and input files).

       <u>LC_MESSAGES</u>
                 Determine  the  locale  that  should  be  used  to affect the format and contents of diagnostic
                 messages written to standard error.

       <u>NLSPATH</u>   Determine the location of message catalogs for the processing of <u>LC_MESSAGES</u>.

</pre><h4><b>ASYNCHRONOUS</b> <b>EVENTS</b></h4><pre>
       Default.

</pre><h4><b>STDOUT</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>cut</u> utility output shall be a concatenation of the selected bytes, characters, or fields (one of  the
       following):

           "%s\n", &lt;<u>concatenation</u> <u>of</u> <u>bytes</u>&gt;

           "%s\n", &lt;<u>concatenation</u> <u>of</u> <u>characters</u>&gt;

           "%s\n", &lt;<u>concatenation</u> <u>of</u> <u>fields</u> <u>and</u> <u>field</u> <u>delimiters</u>&gt;

</pre><h4><b>STDERR</b></h4><pre>
       The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.

</pre><h4><b>OUTPUT</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>EXTENDED</b> <b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       The following exit values shall be returned:

        0    All input files were output successfully.

       &gt;0    An error occurred.

</pre><h4><b>CONSEQUENCES</b> <b>OF</b> <b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       Default.

       <u>The</u> <u>following</u> <u>sections</u> <u>are</u> <u>informative.</u>

</pre><h4><b>APPLICATION</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>cut</u> and <u>fold</u> utilities can be used to create text files out of files with arbitrary line lengths. The
       <u>cut</u>  utility  should  be  used  when  the number of lines (or records) needs to remain constant. The <u>fold</u>
       utility should be used when the contents of long lines need to be kept contiguous.

       Earlier versions of the <u>cut</u> utility worked in an environment where bytes and characters  were  considered
       equivalent  (modulo  &lt;backspace&gt;  and &lt;tab&gt; processing in some implementations). In the extended world of
       multi-byte characters, the new <b>-b</b> option has been added. The <b>-n</b> option (used with <b>-b</b>)  allows  it  to  be
       used to act on bytes rounded to character boundaries.  The algorithm specified for <b>-n</b> guarantees that:

           cut -b 1-500 -n file &gt; file1
           cut -b 501- -n file &gt; file2

       ends  up with all the characters in <b>file</b> appearing exactly once in <b>file1</b> or <b>file2</b>.  (There is, however, a
       &lt;newline&gt; in both <b>file1</b> and <b>file2</b> for each &lt;newline&gt; in <b>file</b>.)

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Examples of the option qualifier list:

       1,4,7   Select the first, fourth, and seventh bytes, characters, or fields and field delimiters.

       1-3,8   Equivalent to 1,2,3,8.

       -5,10   Equivalent to 1,2,3,4,5,10.

       3-      Equivalent to third to last, inclusive.

       The <u>low</u>-<u>high</u> forms are not always equivalent when used with <b>-b</b> and <b>-n</b> and multi-byte characters; see  the
       description of <b>-n</b>.

       The following command:

           cut -d : -f 1,6 <a href="file:/etc/passwd">/etc/passwd</a>

       reads the System V password file (user database) and produces lines of the form:

           &lt;<u>user</u> <u>ID</u>&gt;:&lt;<u>home</u> <u>directory</u>&gt;

       Most  utilities  in  this  volume of POSIX.1‐2017 work on text files. The <u>cut</u> utility can be used to turn
       files with arbitrary line lengths into a set of text files containing the same data.  The  <u>paste</u>  utility
       can be used to create (or recreate) files with arbitrary line lengths. For example, if <b>file</b> contains long
       lines:

           cut -b 1-500 -n file &gt; file1
           cut -b 501- -n file &gt; file2

       creates  <b>file1</b>  (a  text  file)  with  lines no longer than 500 bytes (plus the &lt;newline&gt;) and <b>file2</b> that
       contains the remainder of the data from <b>file</b>.  (Note that <b>file2</b> is not a text file if there are lines  in
       <b>file</b>  that  are  longer  than  500 + {LINE_MAX} bytes.) The original file can be recreated from <b>file1</b> and
       <b>file2</b> using the command:

           paste -d "\0" file1 file2 &gt; file

</pre><h4><b>RATIONALE</b></h4><pre>
       Some historical implementations do not count &lt;backspace&gt; characters in determining character counts  with
       the  <b>-c</b> option. This may be useful for using <u>cut</u> for processing <u>nroff</u> output. It was deliberately decided
       not to have the <b>-c</b> option treat either &lt;backspace&gt; or &lt;tab&gt; characters in any special fashion.  The  <u>fold</u>
       utility does treat these characters specially.

       Unlike  other  utilities,  some  historical  implementations of <u>cut</u> exit after not finding an input file,
       rather than continuing to process the remaining <u>file</u> operands. This behavior is prohibited by this volume
       of POSIX.1‐2017, where only the exit status is affected by this problem.

       The behavior of <u>cut</u> when provided with either mutually-exclusive options or  options  that  do  not  work
       logically  together  has  been  deliberately  left unspecified in favor of global wording in <u>Section</u> <u>1.4</u>,
       <u>Utility</u> <u>Description</u> <u>Defaults</u>.

       The OPTIONS section was changed  in  response  to  IEEE  PASC  Interpretation  1003.2  #149.  The  change
       represents historical practice on all known systems. The original standard was ambiguous on the nature of
       the output.

       The  <u>list</u> option-arguments are historically used to select the portions of the line to be written, but do
       not affect the order of the data. For example:

           echo abcdefghi | cut -c6,2,4-7,1

       yields <b>"abdefg"</b>.

       A proposal to enhance <u>cut</u> with the following option:

       <b>-o</b>    Preserve the selected field order. When this option is specified, each byte,  character,  or  field
             (or  ranges  of  such) shall be written in the order specified by the <u>list</u> option-argument, even if
             this requires multiple outputs of the same bytes, characters, or fields.

       was rejected because this type of enhancement is outside the scope of the IEEE P1003.2b draft standard.
