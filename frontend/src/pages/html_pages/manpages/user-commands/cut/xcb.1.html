</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       xcb - X Cut Buffers - Pigeon holes for your cut and paste selections.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>xcb</b> [<u>Xt</u> <u>option</u>] [<b>-l</b> <u>layout</u>] [<b>-n</b> <u>count</u>] [<b>-p</b>|<b>-s</b>|<b>-S</b> <u>list</u>] [<b>-r</b> <u>count</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Xcb</u>  provides  easy  access  to  the  cut buffers built into every X server.  It allows the buffers to be
       manipulated either via the command line, or with the mouse in a point and click manner.  The buffers  can
       be used as holding pens to store and retrieve arbitrary data fragments.  Any number of cut buffers may be
       created,  so  any  number of different pieces of data can be saved and recalled later.  By default, 8 cut
       buffers are created.  The program is designed primarily for use with textual data.

       <u>Xcb</u> has two modes of operation.  Normally <u>xcb</u> provides an array of windows on your display, one  per  cut
       buffer,  tiled  horizontally,  vertically,  or  in  some user specified layout.  Each window displays the
       contents of its respective cut buffer.  Data can be cut from and pasted  to  the  windows  in  a  similar
       manner to xterm.  The buffers can also be rotated.

       In  task mode, <u>xcb</u> lets you access the cut buffers from the command line.  Cut buffers can be loaded from
       stdin, copied or concatenated to stdout, loaded using  the  current  PRIMARY  selection,  or  rotated  an
       arbitrary  number  of  positions.   In  this  mode of operation, <u>xcb</u> performs the requested task and then
       exits.  It does not create any windows and has no interaction with the mouse or keyboard.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Xcb</u> supports the full set of X Toolkit Intrinsics options, as well as those listed  below.   <u>Xcb</u>  options
       can  appear  in  any  order.   The presence of the <b>-p</b>, <b>-r</b>, <b>-s</b> or <b>-S</b> options causes <u>xcb</u> to execute in task
       mode, described above.

       <b>-l</b> <u>layout</u>
              This option controls the geometry arrangement  of  <u>xcb's</u>  subwindows.   It  is  the  command  line
              equivalent of the <b>.layout</b> resource, described below.

       <b>-n</b> <u>count</u>
              Create <u>count</u> cut buffers.  <u>Count</u> can be any integer greater than zero.  This option is the command
              line equivalent of the <b>.bufferCount</b> resource, described below.

       <b>-u</b>     Use utf-8 instead of the current locale settings when executing in task mode and doing I/O.

       <b>-V</b>     Print the xcb release version number and exit immediately.

       <b>-p</b> <u>list</u>
              Print  the contents of the listed buffer(s) on stdout.  The buffered data is printed exactly as it
              is stored in the server.  Selecting two or more buffers has the effect of concatenating  the  data
              on  stdout.   The  cut  buffers  are  numbered from 0... onwards.  The list can be either a single
              digit, a comma separated list of digits, a range of the form m-n, or some combination of lists and
              ranges.  The buffers are printed in listed order, so repeated numbers in the list can be  used  to
              duplicate buffer contents.

       <b>-r</b> <u>count</u>
              Rotate  the  buffers  by  <u>count</u>  positions.  <u>Count</u> can be any integer, positive or negative.  This
              option may be used in conjunction with the <b>-n</b> <u>count</u> option to rotate a specific number of buffers.
              If the <b>-n</b> option is not used, <u>xcb</u> will rotate the number of  buffers  given  by  the  <b>.bufferCount</b>
              resource.

       <b>-s</b> <u>list</u>
              Store the data from stdin in the listed buffer(s).  If the list refers to two or more buffers, the
              input data is duplicated in each buffer.  Refer to the <b>-p</b> option for the definition of a list.

       <b>-S</b> <u>list</u>
              Store  the  current  PRIMARY  selection  data in the listed buffer(s).  The data is converted to a
              string representation.  If the list refers to two  or  more  buffers,  the  PRIMARY  selection  is
              duplicated  in  each  buffer.   Refer to the <b>-p</b> option for the definition of a list.  Under the -S
              option xcb waits for the nominated cut buffer's contents to change before exiting.  If  no  change
              is detected within 3 seconds, xcb exits with a non-zero return code.

</pre><h4><b>WIDGETS</b> <b>and</b> <b>RESOURCES</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>xcb</u>  widget hierarchy consists of a collection of custom buffer widgets, one per cut buffer.  In the
       Athena version of the program, these buffer widgets are all contained within a single Athena form widget.
       In the Motif version of the program, they are each enclosed by Motif frame widgets, and the frame widgets
       are all contained within a single Motif RowColumn widget.

       The names of the buffer widgets are "buffer0", "buffer1", "buffer2", .... etc., and their class  name  is
       "Buffer".   Each  buffer widget supports all the standard core widget resources, plus the <b>.foreground</b> and
       <b>.fontSet</b> resources.

       Application wide resources are as follows:

         <b>.bufferCount</b> (default value 8)
               This is the number of buffer widgets to create.
               Any number of widgets (greater than zero) can be created.

         <b>.layout</b> (default value "h")
               Only the first character of the resource value is significant.
               This is the geometry arrangement to apply in the container widget.
               The layout can be "h" (horizontal), "v" (vertical), or some
               other value to disable the inbuilt geometry code and specify
               the layout via your X resources.  An example is provided in the
               application default resources file.

</pre><h4><b>EVENTS</b> <b>and</b> <b>TRANSLATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Xcb's</u> input semantics are coded into a Toolkit translation table.  The default bindings have been  chosen
       to  conform  with  the default configuration of other cut and paste clients, such as xterm.  The bindings
       may be altered or overridden according to your needs.  The actions functions provided by <u>xcb</u> are:-

       cut()           causes the contents of the chosen cut buffer to become
                       the PRIMARY selection.  The window contents, if any,
                       are highlighted, and can then be pasted into other
                       cut buffers or applications.

       paste()         causes the value of the PRIMARY selection to be
                       converted into text and pasted into the chosen cut
                       buffer, overwriting any previous buffer contents.
                       If no PRIMARY selection is present, <u>xcb</u> pastes
                       the contents of cut buffer zero into the chosen buffer.

       clear()         clears the chosen cut buffer.

       rotate(NN)      rotates the cut buffers by NN positions.  NN may
                       be any positive or negative number.

       refresh()       causes the cut buffer window to be cleared and redrawn.

       selreq()        this action function handles paste requests
                       from other clients, or other <u>xcb</u> windows.
                       It should always be bound to SelectionRequest events.

       selclear()      this action function responds to the loss of
                       ownership of the PRIMARY selection property.
                       It should always be bound to SelectionClear events.

       quit()          causes <u>xcb</u> to terminate.

       The default bindings are as follows:-

       &lt;Btn1Down&gt;:         cut() \n\
       Shift &lt;Btn2Down&gt;:   clear() \n\
       &lt;Btn2Down&gt;:         paste() \n\
       Shift &lt;Btn3Down&gt;:   rotate(-1) \n\
       &lt;Btn3Down&gt;:         <a href="../man1/rotate.1.html">rotate</a>(1) \n\
       &lt;Key&gt;Left:          rotate(-1) \n\
       &lt;Key&gt;Right:         <a href="../man1/rotate.1.html">rotate</a>(1) \n\
       &lt;Key&gt;Up:            rotate(-1) \n\
       &lt;Key&gt;Down:          <a href="../man1/rotate.1.html">rotate</a>(1) \n\
       &lt;Key&gt;q:             quit() \n\
       &lt;SelReq&gt;:           selreq() \n\
       &lt;SelClr&gt;:           selclear()

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       The following are some examples of <u>xcb</u> task mode usage:-

       xcb -s 0-7 &lt; /dev/null
       This clears the first 8 cut buffers in your server.

       echo "G'day." | xcb -display bigears:0.0 -s 1,3,5,7
       This loads the string "G'day." into four of the cut buffers on the display "bigears".

       xsendevent -win buffer5 '&lt;Btn1Down&gt;'
       This uses the program xsendevent to send a synthetic mouse click  event  to  an  xcb  subwindow,  thereby
       making that window the owner of the PRIMARY selection.

       ls `xcb -p 2,3`
       This produces a listing of all the files named in cut buffers 2 and 3.

       xcb -p 0-7 | xcb -s 0
       This concatenates the values in the first 8 cut buffers, and places the result back in cut buffer zero.

       xcb -S 0 &amp;&amp; xcb -p 0
       The  first command copies the current PRIMARY selection into the first cut buffer.  If the copy succeeds,
       then the second command prints that data on stdout.

       for i in 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
       do
               xcb -p $i &gt; $HOME/.xcb/$i
       done
       for i in 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
       do
               xcb -s $i &lt; $HOME/.xcb/$i
       done
       This first loop saves the contents of each of the  cut  buffers  in  a  separate  file  under  your  home
       directory.   The  second  loop  restores  the  cut buffer contents from those files.  When placed in your
       .logout and .login scripts respectively, the commands are a simple method of preserving your cut  buffers
       across login sessions.

       function g {
               echo "$1\\c" | xcb -s 7
               grep "$@"
       }
       function vg {
               vi +/`xcb -p 7` "$@"
       }
       These  two  shell functions exemplify a simple mechanism for saving and reusing regular expressions.  The
       first function saves the regex used for grep-ing into cut buffer 7.  The second function reuses the  most
       recent  grep  regex  as  a search command in vi.  There is considerable scope for expanding and improving
       these ideas.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b> <b>:-)</b></h4><pre>
       Xlib's  underlying  protocol  for  moving selection data between client and server can sometimes be slow,
       depending on the amount of data involved.  Do not expect fast performance if your selections are  big  or
       you  want  to  store big files in your cut buffers!  ("big" means, say, over 10k bytes - but your mileage
       may vary).
