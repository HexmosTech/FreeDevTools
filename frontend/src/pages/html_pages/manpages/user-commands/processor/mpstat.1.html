</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       mpstat - Report processors related statistics.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>mpstat</b> <b>[</b> <b>-A</b> <b>]</b> <b>[</b> <b>--dec={</b> <b>0</b> <b>|</b> <b>1</b> <b>|</b> <b>2</b> <b>}</b> <b>]</b> <b>[</b> <b>-H</b> <b>]</b> <b>[</b> <b>-n</b> <b>]</b> <b>[</b> <b>-u</b> <b>]</b> <b>[</b> <b>-T</b> <b>]</b> <b>[</b> <b>-V</b> <b>]</b> <b>[</b> <b>-I</b> <b>{</b> <u>keyword</u><b>[,...]</b> <b>|</b> <b>ALL</b> <b>}</b> <b>]</b> <b>[</b>
       <b>-N</b> <b>{</b> <u>node_list</u> <b>|</b> <b>ALL</b> <b>}</b> <b>]</b> <b>[</b> <b>-o</b> <b>JSON</b> <b>]</b> <b>[</b> <b>-P</b> <b>{</b> <u>cpu_list</u> <b>|</b> <b>ALL</b> <b>}</b> <b>]</b> <b>[</b> <u>interval</u> <b>[</b> <u>count</u> <b>]</b> <b>]</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>mpstat</b>  command writes to standard output activities for each available processor, processor 0 being
       the first one.  Global average activities among all processors are also reported.  The <b>mpstat</b> command can
       be used on both SMP and UP machines, but in the latter, only global average activities will  be  printed.
       If no activity has been selected, then the default report is the CPU utilization report.

       The  <u>interval</u> parameter specifies the amount of time in seconds between each report.  A value of 0 (or no
       parameters at all) indicates that processors statistics are to be reported  for  the  time  since  system
       startup  (boot).  The <u>count</u> parameter can be specified in conjunction with the <u>interval</u> parameter if this
       one is not set to zero. The value of <u>count</u> determines the number of reports generated at <u>interval</u> seconds
       apart. If the <u>interval</u> parameter is specified without the <u>count</u> parameter, the <b>mpstat</b>  command  generates
       reports continuously.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-A</b>     This  option is equivalent to specifying <b>-n</b> <b>-u</b> <b>-I</b> <b>ALL</b>.  This option also implies specifying <b>-N</b> <b>ALL</b>
              <b>-P</b> <b>ALL</b> unless these options are explicitly set on the command line.

       <b>--dec={</b> <b>0</b> <b>|</b> <b>1</b> <b>|</b> <b>2</b> <b>}</b>
              Specify the number of decimal places to use (0 to 2, default value is 2).

       <b>-H</b>     Also detect and display statistics for physically hotplugged vCPUs.

       <b>-I</b> <b>{</b> <u>keyword</u><b>[,...]</b> <b>|</b> <b>ALL</b> <b>}</b>
              Report interrupts statistics.  Possible <u>keywords</u> are <b>CPU</b>, <b>SCPU</b>, and <b>SUM</b>.

              With the <b>CPU</b> keyword, the number of each individual interrupt received per second by  the  CPU  or
              CPUs is displayed. Interrupts are those listed in <u><a href="file:/proc/interrupts">/proc/interrupts</a></u> file.

              With the <b>SCPU</b> keyword, the number of each individual software interrupt received per second by the
              CPU  or  CPUs  is  displayed.  This  option  works  only  with  kernels 2.6.31 and later. Software
              interrupts are those listed in <u><a href="file:/proc/softirqs">/proc/softirqs</a></u> file.

              With the <b>SUM</b> keyword, the <b>mpstat</b> command reports the total number  of  interrupts  per  processor.
              The following values are displayed:

              CPU    Processor  number.  The  keyword  <b>all</b>  indicates that statistics are calculated as averages
                     among all processors.

              intr/s Show the total number of interrupts received per second by the CPU or CPUs.

              The <b>ALL</b> keyword is equivalent  to  specifying  all  the  keywords  above  and  therefore  all  the
              interrupts statistics are displayed.

       <b>-N</b> <b>{</b> <u>node_list</u> <b>|</b> <b>ALL</b> <b>}</b>
              Indicate  the  NUMA  nodes for which statistics are to be reported.  <u>node_list</u> is a list of comma-
              separated values or range of values (e.g., <b>0,2,4-7,12-</b>). Note that node <b>all</b> is the global  average
              among all nodes. The <b>ALL</b> keyword indicates that statistics are to be reported for all nodes.

       <b>-n</b>     Report summary CPU statistics based on NUMA node placement. The following values are displayed:

              NODE   Logical  NUMA  node  number.  The  keyword  <b>all</b> indicates that statistics are calculated as
                     averages among all nodes.

              All the other fields are the same as those displayed with option <b>-u</b> (see below).

       <b>-o</b> <b>JSON</b>
              Display the statistics in JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) format.  JSON output  field  order  is
              undefined, and new fields may be added in the future.

       <b>-P</b> <b>{</b> <u>cpu_list</u> <b>|</b> <b>ALL</b> <b>}</b>
              Indicate  the  processors  for  which statistics are to be reported.  <u>cpu_list</u> is a list of comma-
              separated values or range of values (e.g., <b>0,2,4-7,12-</b>).  Note  that  processor  0  is  the  first
              processor,  and  processor  <b>all</b>  is  the  global  average  among  all processors.  The <b>ALL</b> keyword
              indicates that statistics are to be reported for  all  processors.   Offline  processors  are  not
              displayed.

       <b>-T</b>     Display  topology  elements  in  the  CPU report (see option <b>-u</b> below). The following elements are
              displayed:

              CORE   Logical core number.

              SOCK   Logical socket number.

              NODE   Logical NUMA node number.

       <b>-u</b>     Report CPU utilization. The following values are displayed:

              CPU    Processor number. The keyword <u>all</u> indicates that  statistics  are  calculated  as  averages
                     among all processors.

              %usr   Show  the  percentage  of  CPU  utilization that occurred while executing at the user level
                     (application).

              %nice  Show the percentage of CPU utilization that occurred while executing at the user level with
                     nice priority.

              %sys   Show the percentage of CPU utilization that occurred while executing at  the  system  level
                     (kernel).  Note  that  this  does  not  include  time spent servicing hardware and software
                     interrupts.

              %iowait
                     Show the percentage of time that the CPU or CPUs were idle during which the system  had  an
                     outstanding disk I/O request.

              %irq   Show the percentage of time spent by the CPU or CPUs to service hardware interrupts.

              %soft  Show the percentage of time spent by the CPU or CPUs to service software interrupts.

              %steal Show  the percentage of time spent in involuntary wait by the virtual CPU or CPUs while the
                     hypervisor was servicing another virtual processor.

              %guest Show the percentage of time spent by the CPU or CPUs to run a virtual processor.

              %gnice Show the percentage of time spent by the CPU or CPUs to run a niced guest.

              %idle  Show the percentage of time that the CPU or CPUs were idle and the system did not  have  an
                     outstanding disk I/O request.

       <b>-V</b>     Print version number then exit.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>mpstat</b> command takes into account the following environment variable:

       <b>S_COLORS</b>
              By default statistics are displayed in color when the output is connected to a terminal.  Use this
              variable  to change the settings. Possible values for this variable are <u>never</u>, <u>always</u> or <u>auto</u> (the
              latter is equivalent to the default settings).
              Please note that the color (being red, yellow, or some other color) used to display a value is not
              indicative of any kind of issue simply because of the color. It only indicates different ranges of
              values.

       <b>S_COLORS_SGR</b>
              Specify the colors and other attributes used to display statistics on the terminal.  Its value  is
              a  colon-separated  list  of  capabilities  that defaults to <b>I=32;22:N=34;1:W=35;1:X=31;1:Z=34;22</b>.
              Supported capabilities are:

              <b>I=</b>     SGR (Select Graphic Rendition) substring for CPU number.

              <b>N=</b>     SGR substring for non-zero statistics values.

              <b>W=</b> (or <b>M=</b>)
                     SGR substring for percentage values in the range from 75% to 90% (or in the  range  10%  to
                     25% depending on the metric's meaning).

              <b>X=</b> (or <b>H=</b>)
                     SGR substring for percentage values greater than or equal to 90% (or lower than or equal to
                     10% depending on the metric's meaning).

              <b>Z=</b>     SGR substring for zero values.

       <b>S_TIME_FORMAT</b>
              If this variable exists and its value is <b>ISO</b> then the current locale will be ignored when printing
              the  date  in  the  report  header.   The <b>mpstat</b> command will use the ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD)
              instead.  The timestamp will also be compliant with ISO 8601 format.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>mpstat</b> <b>2</b> <b>5</b>
              Display five reports of global statistics among all processors at two second intervals.

       <b>mpstat</b> <b>-P</b> <b>ALL</b> <b>2</b> <b>5</b>
              Display five reports of statistics for all processors at two second intervals.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       <u><a href="file:/proc">/proc</a></u> filesystem must be mounted for the <b>mpstat</b> command to work.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <u><a href="file:/proc">/proc</a></u> contains various files with system statistics.
