       procmail - autonomous mail processor

       <b>procmail</b> [<b>-ptoY</b>] [<b>-f</b> <u>fromwhom</u>]
            [<u>parameter</u><b>=</b><u>value</u> | <u>rcfile</u>] ...

       <b>procmail</b> <b>-v</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       For a quick start, see <b>NOTES</b> at the end.

       <b>Procmail</b>  should  be  invoked  automatically  over  the  <b>.forward</b> file mechanism as soon as mail arrives.
       Alternatively, when installed by a system administrator,  it  can  be  invoked  from  within  the  mailer
       immediately.   When  invoked,  it first sets some environment variables to default values, reads the mail
       message from stdin until an EOF, separates the body from  the  header,  and  then,  if  no  command  line
       arguments are present, it starts to look for a file named <b>$HOME/.procmailrc</b>.  According to the processing
       recipes  in  this  file,  the  mail message that just arrived gets distributed into the right folder (and
       more).  If no rcfile is found, or processing of the rcfile falls off the end,  procmail  will  store  the
       mail in the default system mailbox.

       If  no  rcfiles  and  no  <b>-p</b>  have  been  specified  on the command line, procmail will, prior to reading
       $HOME/.procmailrc, interpret commands from  <b>/etc/procmailrc</b>  (if  present).   Care  must  be  taken  when
       creating  /etc/procmailrc,  because,  if  circumstances  permit, it will be executed with root privileges
       (contrary to the $HOME/.procmailrc file of course).

       If running suid root or with root privileges,  procmail  will  be  able  to  perform  as  a  functionally
       enhanced, backwards compatible mail delivery agent.

       Procmail  can  also  be  used as a general purpose mail filter, i.e., provisions have been made to enable
       procmail to be invoked in a special sendmail rule.

       The rcfile format is described in detail in the <b><a href="../man5/procmailrc.5.html">procmailrc</a></b>(5) man page.

       The weighted scoring technique is described in detail in the <b><a href="../man5/procmailsc.5.html">procmailsc</a></b>(5) man page.

       Examples for rcfile recipes can be looked up in the <b><a href="../man5/procmailex.5.html">procmailex</a></b>(5) man page.

   <b>Signals</b>
       <b>TERMINATE</b>   Terminate prematurely and requeue the mail.

       <b>HANGUP</b>      Terminate prematurely and bounce the mail.

       <b>INTERRUPT</b>   Terminate prematurely and bounce the mail.

       <b>QUIT</b>        Terminate prematurely and silently lose the mail.

       <b>ALARM</b>       Force a timeout (see <b>TIMEOUT).</b>

       <b>USR1</b>        Equivalent to a <b>VERBOSE</b>=off.

       <b>USR2</b>        Equivalent to a <b>VERBOSE</b>=on.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-v</b>   Procmail will print its version number, display its compile time configuration and exit.

       <b>-p</b>   Preserve any old environment.  Normally procmail clears the environment upon startup, except for the
            value of TZ.  However, in any case: any default values will  override  any  preexisting  environment
            variables,  i.e.,  procmail  will  not pay any attention to any predefined environment variables, it
            will happily overwrite them with its own defaults.  For  the  list  of  environment  variables  that
            procmail  will  preset see the <b><a href="../man5/procmailrc.5.html">procmailrc</a></b>(5) man page.  If both -p and -m are specified, the list of
            preset environment variables shrinks to just: LOGNAME, HOME, SHELL, USER_SHELL, ORGMAIL and MAILDIR.

       <b>-t</b>   Make procmail fail softly, i.e., if procmail cannot deliver the mail to any of the destinations  you
            gave,  the mail will not bounce, but will return to the mailqueue.  Another delivery-attempt will be
            made at some time in the future.

       <b>-f</b> <u>fromwhom</u>
            Causes procmail to regenerate the leading `From ' line with <u>fromwhom</u> as the sender  (instead  of  -f
            one  could  use  the  alternate and obsolete -r).  If <u>fromwhom</u> consists merely of a single `-', then
            procmail will only update the timestamp on the `From ' line (if present, if not, it will generate  a
            new one).

       <b>-o</b>   Instead of allowing anyone to generate `From ' lines, simply override the fakes.

       <b>-Y</b>   Assume traditional Berkeley mailbox format, ignore any <b>Content-Length:</b> fields.

       <b>-a</b> <u>argument</u>
            This  will  set  $1  to  be equal to <u>argument</u>.  Each succeeding <b>-a</b> <u>argument</u> will set the next number
            variable ($2, $3, etc).  It can be used to  pass  meta  information  along  to  procmail.   This  is
            typically done by passing along the $@x information from the sendmail mailer rule.

       <b>-d</b> <u>recipient</u> <u>...</u>
            This  turns  on  explicit  delivery  mode,  delivery  will be to the local user <u>recipient</u>.  This, of
            course, only is possible if procmail has root privileges (or if procmail is already running with the
            recipient's euid and egid).  Procmail will setuid to the intended recipients and delivers  the  mail
            as  if  it were invoked by the recipient with no arguments (i.e., if no rcfile is found, delivery is
            like ordinary mail).  This option is incompatible with <b>-p</b>.

       <b>-m</b>   Turns procmail into a general purpose mail filter.  In this mode one rcfile must be specified on the
            command line.  After the rcfile, procmail will accept an unlimited  number  of  arguments.   If  the
            rcfile  is  an  absolute  path starting with <b>/etc/procmailrcs/</b> without backward references (i.e. the
            parent directory cannot be mentioned) procmail will, only if no security violations are found,  take
            on  the  identity  of  the  owner of the rcfile (or symbolic link).  For some advanced usage of this
            option you should look in the <b>EXAMPLES</b> section below.

</pre><h4><b>ARGUMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       Any arguments containing an '=' are considered to be environment variable assignments, they will  <u>all</u>  be
       evaluated after the default values have been assigned and before the first rcfile is opened.

       Any other arguments are presumed to be rcfile paths (either absolute, or if they start with `./' relative
       to  the  current  directory;  <b>any</b> <b>other</b> <b>relative</b> path is relative to $HOME, unless the <b>-m</b> option has been
       given, in which case all relative paths are relative to the current directory); procmail will start  with
       the first one it finds on the command line.  The following ones will only be parsed if the preceding ones
       have a not matching HOST-directive entry, or in case they should not exist.

       If  no  rcfiles are specified, it looks for <b>$HOME/.procmailrc</b>.  If not even that can be found, processing
       will continue according to the default settings of the environment variables and the  ones  specified  on
       the command line.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Examples for rcfile recipes can be looked up in the <b><a href="../man5/procmailex.5.html">procmailex</a></b>(5) man page.  A small sample rcfile can be
       found in the <b>NOTES</b> section below.

       Skip the rest of this EXAMPLES section unless you are a system administrator who is vaguely familiar with
       sendmail.cf syntax.

       The  <b>-m</b>  option is typically used when procmail is called from within a rule in the sendmail.cf file.  In
       order to be able to do this it is convenient to create an extra `procmail'  mailer  in  your  sendmail.cf
       file (in addition to the perhaps already present `local' mailer that starts up procmail).  To create such
       a `procmail' mailer I'd suggest something like:

              Mprocmail, P=/usr/bin/procmail, F=mSDFMhun, S=11, R=21,
                      A=procmail -m $h $g $u

       This  enables  you  to use rules like the following (most likely in ruleset 0) to filter mail through the
       procmail mailer (please note the leading tab to continue the rule, and the tab to separate the comments):

              R$*&lt;@some.where&gt;$*
                      $#procmail $@/etc/procmailrcs/some.rc $:$<a href="mailto:1@some.where.procmail">1@some.where.procmail</a>$2
              R$*&lt;@$*.procmail&gt;$*
                      $1&lt;@$2&gt;$3       Already filtered, map back

       And /etc/procmailrcs/some.rc could be as simple as:

              SENDER = "&lt;$1&gt;"                 # fix for empty sender addresses
              SHIFT = 1                       # remove it from $@

              :0                              # sink all junk mail
              * ^Subject:.*junk
              /dev/null

              :0 w                            # pass along all other mail
              ! -oi -f "$SENDER" "$@"

       Do watch out when sending mail from within  the  /etc/procmailrcs/some.rc  file,  if  you  send  mail  to
       addresses which match the first rule again, you could be creating an endless mail loop.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <b><a href="file:/etc/passwd">/etc/passwd</a></b>            to set the recipient's LOGNAME, HOME and USER_SHELL variable defaults

       <b><a href="file:/var/mail/">/var/mail/</a>$LOGNAME</b>     system  mailbox; both the system mailbox and the immediate directory it is in will
                              be created every time procmail starts and either one is not present

       <b>/etc/procmailrc</b>        initial global rcfile

       <b>/etc/procmailrcs/</b>      special privileges path for rcfiles

       <b>$HOME/.procmailrc</b>      default rcfile

       <b><a href="file:/var/mail/">/var/mail/</a>$LOGNAME.lock</b>
                              lockfile for the system  mailbox  (not  automatically  used  by  procmail,  unless
                              $DEFAULT equals <a href="file:/var/mail/">/var/mail/</a>$LOGNAME and procmail is delivering to $DEFAULT)

       <b>/usr/sbin/sendmail</b>     default mail forwarder

       <b>_????`hostname`</b>        temporary `unique' zero-length files created by procmail

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       Autoforwarding mailbox found
                              The  system  mailbox  had  its  suid  or  sgid  bit  set, procmail terminates with
                              EX_NOUSER assuming that this mailbox must not be delivered to.

       Bad substitution of "x"
                              Not a valid environment variable name specified.

       Closing brace unexpected
                              There was no corresponding opening brace (nesting block).

       Conflicting options    Not all option combinations are useful

       Conflicting x suppressed
                              Flag x is not compatible with some other flag on this recipe.

       Couldn't create "x"    The system mailbox was missing and could not/will not be created.

       Couldn't create maildir part "x"
                              The maildir folder "x" is missing one or more required subdirectories and procmail
                              could not create them.

       Couldn't create or rename temp file "x"
                              An error occurred in the mechanics of  delivering to the directory folder "x".

       Couldn't determine implicit lockfile from "x"
                              There were no `&gt;&gt;' redirectors to be found, using simply `$LOCKEXT' as  locallock‐
                              file.

       Couldn't read "x"      Procmail  was  unable  to open an rcfile or it was not a regular file, or procmail
                              couldn't open an MH directory to find the highest numbered file.

       Couldn't unlock "x"    Lockfile was already gone, or write permission to the directory where the lockfile
                              is has been denied.

       Deadlock attempted on "x"
                              The locallockfile specified on this recipe is equal to a still active $LOCKFILE.

       Denying special privileges for "x"
                              Procmail will not take on the identity that comes with the rcfile because a  secu‐
                              rity violation was found (e.g.  <b>-p</b> or variable assignments on the command line) or
                              procmail had insufficient privileges to do so.

       Descriptor "x" was not open
                              As  procmail  was  started, stdin, stdout or stderr was not connected (possibly an
                              attempt to subvert security)

       Enforcing stricter permissions on "x"
                              The system mailbox of the recipient was found to be  unsecured,  procmail  secured
                              it.

       Error while writing to "x"
                              Nonexistent subdirectory, no write permission, pipe died or disk full.

       Exceeded LINEBUF       Buffer overflow detected, LINEBUF was too small, PROCMAIL_OVERFLOW has been set.

       MAILDIR is not an absolute path

       MAILDIR path too long

       ORGMAIL is not an absolute path

       ORGMAIL path too long

       default rcfile is not an absolute path

       default rcfile path too long
                              The  specified  item's full path, when expanded, was longer than LINEBUF or didn't
                              start with a file separator.

       Excessive output quenched from "x"
                              The backquoted expression "x" tried to produce too much  output  for  the  current
                              LINEBUF; the rest was discarded and PROCMAIL_OVERFLOW has been set.

       Extraneous x ignored   The action line or other flags on this recipe make x meaningless.

       Failed forking "x"     Process table is full (and NORESRETRY has been exhausted).

       Failed to execute "x"  Program not in path, or not executable.

       Forced unlock denied on "x"
                              No  write permission in the directory where <b>lockfile</b> "x" resides, or more than one
                              procmail trying to force a lock at exactly the same time.

       Forcing lock on "x"    <b>Lockfile</b> "x" is going to be removed by force because of a timeout (see also: <b>LOCK‐</b>
                              <b>TIMEOUT</b>).

       Incomplete recipe      The start of a recipe was found, but it stranded in an EOF.

       Insufficient privileges
                              Procmail either needs root privileges, or must have the right (e)uid <b>and</b> (e)gid to
                              run in delivery mode.  The mail will bounce.

       Invalid regexp "x"     The regular expression "x" contains errors (most likely some missing or extraneous
                              parens).

       Kernel-lock failed     While trying to use the kernel-supported locking calls, one of them failed (usual‐
                              ly indicates an OS error), procmail ignores this error and proceeds.

       Kernel-unlock failed   See above.

       Lock failure on "x"    Can only occur if you specify some real weird (and illegal)  lockfilenames  or  if
                              the  <b>lockfile</b> could not be created because of insufficient permissions or nonexis‐
                              tent subdirectories.

       Lost "x"               Procmail tried to clone itself but could not find back rcfile "x" (it  either  got
                              removed  or it was a relative path and you changed directory since procmail opened
                              it last time).

       Missing action         The current recipe was found to be incomplete.

       Missing closing brace  A nesting block was started, but never finished.

       Missing name           The -f option needs an extra argument.

       Missing argument       You specified the -a option but forgot the argument.

       Missing rcfile         You specified the -m option, procmail expects the name of an rcfile as argument.

       Missing recipient      You specified the -d option or called procmail under a different name, it  expects
                              one or more recipients as arguments.

       No space left to finish writing "x"
                              The  filesystem  containing "x" does not have enough free space to permit delivery
                              of the message to the file.

       Out of memory          The system is out of swap space (and NORESRETRY has been exhausted).

       Processing continued   The unrecognised options on the command line are ignored, proceeding as usual.

       Program failure (nnn) of "x"
                              Program that was started by procmail returned nnn instead of EXIT_SUCCESS (=0); if
                              nnn is negative, then this is the signal the program died on.

       Quota exceeded while writing "x"
                              The filesize quota for the recipient on the filesystem  containing  "x"  does  not
                              permit delivering the message to the file.

       Renaming bogus "x" into "x"
                              The system mailbox of the recipient was found to be bogus, procmail performed eva‐
                              sive actions.

       Rescue of unfiltered data succeeded/failed
                              A filter returned unsuccessfully, procmail tried to get back the original text.

       Skipped: "x"           Couldn't do anything with "x" in the rcfile (syntax error), ignoring it.

       Suspicious rcfile "x"  The  owner  of  the  rcfile  was  not  the  recipient  or root, the file was world
                              writable, or the directory that contained it was world writable, or this  was  the
                              default  rcfile ($HOME/.procmailrc) and either it was group writable or the direc‐
                              tory that contained it was group writable (the rcfile was not used).

       Terminating prematurely whilst waiting for ...
                              Procmail received a signal while it was waiting for ...

       Timeout, terminating "x"
                              Timeout has occurred on program or filter "x".

       Timeout, was waiting for "x"
                              Timeout has occurred on program, filter or file "x".  If it was a program or  fil‐
                              ter, then it didn't seem to be running anymore.

       Truncated file to former size
                              The  file could not be delivered to successfully, so the file was truncated to its
                              former size.

       Truncating "x" and retrying lock
                              "x" does not seem to be a valid filename or the file is not empty.

       Unable to treat as directory "x"
                              Either the suffix on "x" would indicate that it should be an MH or maildir folder,
                              or it was listed as an second folder into which to link, but it already exists and
                              is not a directory.

       Unexpected EOL         Missing closing quote, or trying to escape EOF.

       Unknown user "x"       The specified recipient does not have a corresponding uid.

</pre><h4><b>EXTENDED</b> <b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       Extended diagnostics can be turned on and off through setting the VERBOSE variable.

       [pid] time &amp; date      Procmail's pid and a timestamp.  Generated whenever procmail logs a diagnostic and
                              at least a second has elapsed since the last timestamp.

       Acquiring kernel-lock  Procmail now tries to kernel-lock the most recently opened file (descriptor).

       Assigning "x"          Environment variable assignment.

       Assuming identity of the recipient, VERBOSE=off
                              Dropping all privileges (if any), implicitly turns off extended diagnostics.

       Bypassed locking "x"   The mail spool directory was not accessible to procmail, it relied solely on  ker‐
                              nel locks.

       Executing "x"          Starting  program "x".  If it is started by procmail directly (without an interme‐
                              diate shell), procmail will show where it separated  the  arguments  by  inserting
                              commas.

       HOST mismatched "x"    This host was called "x", HOST contained something else.

       Locking "x"            Creating lockfile "x".

       Linking to "x"         Creating a hardlink between directory folders.

       Match on "x"           Condition matched.

       Matched "x"            Assigned "x" to <b>MATCH</b>.

       No match on "x"        Condition didn't match, recipe skipped.

       Non-zero exitcode (nnn) by "x"
                              Program  that  was started by procmail as a condition or as the action of a recipe
                              with the `W' flag returned nnn instead of EXIT_SUCCESS (=0); the  usage  indicates
                              that this is not an entirely unexpected condition.

       Notified comsat: "$LOGNAME@offset:file"
                              Sent  comsat/biff  a  notice  that  mail  arrived for user $LOGNAME at `offset' in
                              `file'.

       Opening "x"            Opening file "x" for appending.

       Rcfile: "x"            Rcfile changed to "x".

       Reiterating kernel-lock
                              While attempting several locking methods, one of these failed.  Procmail will  re‐
                              iterate until they all succeed in rapid succession.

       Score: added newtotal "x"
                              This condition scored `added' points, which resulted in a `newtotal' score.

       Unlocking "x"          Removing lockfile "x" again.

</pre><h4><b>WARNINGS</b></h4><pre>
       You  should  create  a  shell script that uses <b><a href="../man1/lockfile.1.html">lockfile</a></b>(1) before invoking your mail shell on any mailbox
       file other than the system mailbox (unless of course, your mail shell uses the same lockfiles  (local  or
       global) you specified in your rcfile).

       In the unlikely event that you absolutely need to kill procmail before it has finished, first try and use
       the  regular kill command (i.e., <u>not</u> kill -9, see the subsection <u>Signals</u> for suggestions), otherwise some
       <u>lockfiles</u> might not get removed.

       Beware when using the <b>-t</b> option, if procmail repeatedly is unable to deliver the mail (e.g.,  due  to  an
       incorrect  rcfile),  the  system mailqueue could fill up.  This could aggravate both the local postmaster
       and other users.

       The <b>/etc/procmailrc</b> file might be executed with root privileges, so be very careful of what  you  put  in
       it.   <b>SHELL</b> will be equal to that of the current recipient, so if procmail has to invoke the shell, you'd
       better set it to some safe value first.  See also: <b>DROPPRIVS</b>.

       Keep in mind that if <b><a href="../man1/chown.1.html">chown</a></b>(1) is permitted on files in <b>/etc/procmailrcs/</b>, that they  can  be  chowned  to
       root  (or  anyone  else) by their current owners.  For maximum security, make sure this directory is <u>exe‐</u>
       <u>cutable</u> to root only.

       Procmail is not the proper tool for sharing one mailbox among many users, such as when you have  one  POP
       account for all mail to your domain. It can be done if you manage to configure your MTA to add some head‐
       ers  with the envelope recipient data in order to tell Procmail who a message is for, but this is usually
       not the right thing to do.  Perhaps you want to investigate if your MTA offers `virtual user tables',  or
       check out the `multidrop' facility of Fetchmail.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       After  removing  a  lockfile  by force, procmail waits $SUSPEND seconds before creating a new lockfile so
       that another process that decides to remove the stale lockfile will not remove the newly created lock  by
       mistake.

       Procmail  uses the regular TERMINATE signal to terminate any runaway filter, but it does not check if the
       filter responds to that signal and it only sends it to the filter itself, not  to  any  of  the  filter's
       children.

       A continued <b>Content-Length:</b> field is not handled correctly.

       The embedded newlines in a continued header should be skipped when matching instead of being treated as a
       single space as they are now.

</pre><h4><b>MISCELLANEOUS</b></h4><pre>
       If  there  is an existing <b>Content-Length:</b> field in the header of the mail and the <b>-Y</b> option is not speci‐
       fied, procmail will trim the field to report the correct size.  Procmail does not change the fieldwidth.

       If there is no <b>Content-Length:</b> field or the <b>-Y</b> option has been specified and procmail appends to  regular
       mailfolders,  any  lines in the body of the message that look like postmarks are prepended with `&gt;' (dis‐
       arms bogus mailheaders).  The regular expression that is used to search for these postmarks is:
              `\nFrom '

       If the destination name used in explicit delivery mode is not in <a href="file:/etc/passwd">/etc/passwd</a>, procmail will proceed as if
       explicit delivery mode was not in effect.  If not in explicit delivery mode and should the  uid  procmail
       is  running under, have no corresponding <a href="file:/etc/passwd">/etc/passwd</a> entry, then HOME will default to /, LOGNAME will de‐
       fault to #uid, USER_SHELL will default to <a href="file:/bin/sh">/bin/sh</a>, and ORGMAIL will default to /tmp/dead.letter.

       When in explicit delivery mode, procmail will generate a leading `From ' line if none is present.  If one
       is already present procmail will leave it intact.  If procmail is not invoked with one of  the  following
       user  or group ids: root, daemon, uucp, mail, x400, network, list, slist, lists or news, but still has to
       generate or accept a new `From ' line, it will generate an additional `&gt;From ' line to  help  distinguish
       fake mails.

       For  security  reasons  procmail will only use an absolute or $HOME-relative rcfile if it is owned by the
       recipient or root, not world writable, and the directory it is contained in is not world  writable.   The
       $HOME/.procmailrc  file  has the additional constraint of not being group-writable or in a group-writable
       directory.

       If <a href="file:/var/mail/">/var/mail/</a>$LOGNAME is a bogus mailbox (i.e., does not belong to the recipient,  is  unwritable,  is  a
       symbolic  link  or is a hard link), procmail will upon startup try to rename it into a file starting with
       `BOGUS.$LOGNAME.' and ending in an inode-sequence-code.  If this turns out to be impossible, <b>ORGMAIL</b> will
       have <u>no</u> initial value, and hence will inhibit delivery without a proper rcfile.

       If <a href="file:/var/mail/">/var/mail/</a>$LOGNAME already is a valid mailbox, but has got too loose permissions on it, procmail  will
       correct this.  To prevent procmail from doing this make sure the u+x bit is set.

       When  delivering  to directories, MH folders, or maildir folders, you <b>don't</b> need to use lockfiles to pre‐
       vent several concurrently running procmail programs from messing up.

       Delivering to MH folders is slightly more time consuming than delivering to normal directories  or  mail‐
       boxes, because procmail has to search for the next available number (instead of having the filename imme‐
       diately available).

       On  general  failure  procmail  will return EX_CANTCREAT, unless option <b>-t</b> is specified, in which case it
       will return EX_TEMPFAIL.

       To make `egrepping' of headers more consistent, procmail concatenates all continued  header  fields;  but
       only internally.  When delivering the mail, line breaks will appear as before.

       If  procmail  is  called under a name not starting with `procmail' (e.g., if it is linked to another name
       and invoked as such), it comes up in explicit delivery mode, and expects the recipients' names as command
       line arguments (as if -d had been specified).

       Comsat/biff notifications are done using udp.  They are sent off once when procmail generates the regular
       logfile entry.  The notification messages have the following extended format (or as close as you can  get
       when final delivery was not to a file):
              $LOGNAME@offset_of_message_in_mailbox:absolute_path_to_mailbox

       Whenever  procmail  itself  opens a file to deliver to, it consistently uses the following kernel locking
       strategies: <b><a href="../man2/fcntl.2.html">fcntl</a></b>(2).

       Procmail is NFS-resistant and eight-bit clean.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       Calling up procmail with the -h or -? options will cause it to display a  command-line  help  and  recipe
       flag quick-reference page.

       There  exists an excellent newbie FAQ about mailfilters (and procmail in particular); it is maintained by
       Nancy McGough &lt;<a href="mailto:nancym@ii.com">nancym@ii.com</a>&gt; and can be obtained by sending a mail to <a href="mailto:mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu">mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu</a> with  the
       following in the body:
              send usenet/news.answers/mail/filtering-faq

       If procmail is <u>not</u> installed globally as the default mail delivery agent (ask your system administrator),
       you have to make sure it is invoked when your mail arrives.  In this case your $HOME/.forward (beware, it
       <b>has</b>  to  be world readable) file should contain the line below.  Be sure to include the single and double
       quotes, and unless you know your site to be running smrsh (the SendMail Restricted SHell), it must be  an
       <u>absolute</u> path.

       "|exec /usr/bin/procmail"

       Some mailers (notably exim) do not currently accept the above syntax.  In such case use this instead:

       |/usr/bin/procmail

       Procmail  can also be invoked to postprocess an already filled system mailbox.  This can be useful if you
       don't want to or can't use a $HOME/.forward file (in which case the following script  could  periodically
       be called from within <b><a href="../man1/cron.1.html">cron</a></b>(1), or whenever you start reading mail):

              #!<a href="file:/bin/sh">/bin/sh</a>

              ORGMAIL=<a href="file:/var/mail/">/var/mail/</a>$LOGNAME

              if cd $HOME &amp;&amp;
               test -s $ORGMAIL &amp;&amp;
               lockfile -r0 -l1024 .newmail.lock 2&gt;/dev/null
              then
                trap "rm -f .newmail.lock" 1 2 3 13 15

                 cat /dev/null &gt;$ORGMAIL
                lockfile -mu
                formail -s procmail &lt;.newmail &amp;&amp;
                 rm -f .newmail
