</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       ddtc - ddts client tool to help translators and reviewers.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       ddtc [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGUMENTS]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This script helps both translators and reviewers with parsing mails from the ddts, splitting them into
       individual package files, sending reviews and patching buggy translations.

       Before sending back the translation or the review to the server, the script performs a few tests on it
       and does not sent it if one of the following succeeds:

       - number of paragraphs is different in the description and its translation,
       - line length is more than 80 characters,
       - <u>&lt;tab&gt;</u> character is found,
       - line starts with a dot (<u>.</u>) followed by other characters.

       It  can  also  be run in interactive mode if no command is provided. In this case, menus are displayed to
       prompt the user for commands.

</pre><h4><b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       Here is the basic process:

       - Receiving mail from the ddts
           Pass the whole mail (i.e. with header and Mime parts) you received from  the  ddts  to  the  standard
           input of this script, providing the <u>parse</u> command.

           If  it  finds  descriptions  to  translate,  it  creates a <u>package.todo</u> file for each of them in your
           <u>Base_dir/tr</u> directory, diffing it with the preceding you have already translated if it exists.

           If it finds descriptions to review, it  creates  a  <u>package.todo</u>  file  for  each  of  them  in  your
           <u>Base_dir/rev</u>  directory.  If  a  preceding review exists, it diffs both and write the diff or set the
           description as reviewed if there is no difference.

           If it finds a bug report, it creates a <u>package.bug</u> file in your <u>Base_dir/bug</u> directory, it merges all
           bug reports to ease corrections. It also tries to detect collisions (see below).

       - Working with the files
           - Translating
               Rename the <u>package.todo</u> file in your <u>Base/tr</u> directory into <u>package.tr</u>.

               Edit it with your favorite text editor.

           - Reviewing
               Rename the <u>package.todo</u> file in your <u>Base_dir/rev</u> directory into <u>package.rev</u>.  Do  not  edit  the
               <u>package</u> file (with no extension), it is used internally by ddtc.

               Edit  it with your favorite text editor. You can add comments that will be sent to the translator
               by adding lines beginning with `<b>&gt;&gt;</b> ' (your <u>$Comment</u> variable contents  followed  by  a  mandatory
               space character).

               If  a  translation  has  already  been  reviewed  and  has  been modified the script show you the
               differences between both versions.  Lines beginning with `<b>&gt;&gt;--</b>' correspond to your  last  version
               you reviewed, replace this by `<b>+&gt;--</b>' if you think the translator is still wrong.  Lines beginning
               with  `<b>&gt;&gt;++</b>'  are  the  new  translator's  version,  replace this by `<b>+&gt;++</b>' if you agree with the
               translator.  Of course, if you still disagree with  the  translator,  you  can  add  comments  as
               indicated above.

           - Fixing bugs
               Rename the <u>package.bug</u> file in your <u>Base_dir/bug</u> directory into <u>package.fix</u>.

               Edit it with your favorite text editor. It contains all changes and comments of the reviewers.

               Lines  beginning  with  `<b>&gt;&gt;</b>'  are  comments  and doesn't have to be removed. Lines beginning with
               `<b>&gt;&gt;X+</b>' are suggested corrections, replace this by `<b>+&gt;X+</b>'  if  you  want  to  validate  it.  Lines
               beginning  with  `<b>&gt;&gt;--</b>'  are  your  last translation, replace this by `<b>+&gt;--</b>' if you don't want to
               accept suggested corrections.

               Run the script providing the <u>fix</u> command. It creates a new <u>package.tr</u> file  in  your  <u>Base_dir/tr</u>
               directory containing the unchanged lines and the lines you have selected.

               To  prevent  collisions (reviewers sending review based on a different version than yours), don't
               send fixed descriptions too often (once a day should be fine), retrieve your mails and parse them
               just before fixing, send the fixed description as soon as possible afterward.

       - Sending files back to the ddts
           Run the script providing the <u>mail</u> command.

           It sends descriptions from <u>package.tr</u> and <u>package.rev</u> files back  to  the  ddts  renaming  them  into
           <u>package.sent</u> and closing bugs if necessary.

       - Sending commands to the server
           Run  the  script providing the commands you want to be sent to the server. It checks the commands and
           send them to the server.

           Available commands:

           section <u>section</u> <u>name</u>
           sget <u>package</u> <u>name</u>
           get <u>package</u> <u>name</u>
           get <u>number</u> <u>of</u> <u>packages</u>
           review <u>package</u> <u>name</u>
           review <u>number</u> <u>of</u> <u>packages</u>
           getbug <u>list</u> <u>of</u> <u>bug</u> <u>numbers</u>
           btsclose <u>list</u> <u>of</u> <u>bug</u> <u>numbers</u>
           notification <u>list</u> <u>of</u> <u>languages</u>
           listtranslatedpackages
           status
           noneveraguide
           neveraguide
           noguide
           guide

           In   each   set:    <u>sget</u>/<u>get</u>/<u>review</u>/<u>getbug</u>/<u>btsclose</u>/<u>notification</u>,    <u>noneveraguide</u>/<u>neveraguide</u>    and
           <u>noguide</u>/<u>guide</u>, only the first found command is used. The script automatically adds language, encoding
           and mail address (<u>Mail_in</u>) if requested, <u>noguide</u> is default.

           Due to server limitation, to avoid risk of deny of service attack, you cannot receive for more than 9
           new documents at the same time. The script does not check for this, but the server will.

           For  <u>sget</u>,  <u>get</u>,  <u>review</u>,  <u>status</u>  and <u>listtranslatedpackages</u> you have either to define the <u>$Language</u>
           variable in you <u>.ddtcrc</u> configuration file, or to provide a language extension via the <u>--lang</u>  or  <u>-l</u>
           option.

       - Cleaning directories
           Run the script providing the <u>clean</u> command.

           It  removes  unnecessary  files  in  ddtc directories but temporary one as this directory should be a
           system wide temporary directory cleaned via system scheduled threads, but for debugging reason.

       - Getting statistics about my work
           Run the script providing the <u>stats</u> command.

           It prints figures based on file counts, it may not be accurate if directory  cleaning  has  not  been
           made before.
