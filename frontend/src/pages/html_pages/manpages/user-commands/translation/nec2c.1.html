</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       <b>nec2c</b> - Translation of the NEC2 FORTRAN source code to the C language

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>nec2c</b> [/-i&lt;input-file-name&gt;] [/-o&lt;output-file-name&gt;][/-hv]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  translation  was  performed mostly "by hand" and a lot of modifications to the original program were
       introduced in order to modernize the NEC2 and to remove as many built-in  limitations  as  possible.  The
       attendant  SOMNEC  program  was  also  translated  to  C  and incorporated in nec2c as a function so that
       Sommerfeld ground solutions are a part of the program.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The -i option is always needed and it specifies the name of the input file. The -o switch is optional and
       it specifies the output file name.  If not used, a name for the output file  is  made  by  stripping  any
       extensions  from  the  input  file name and adding a ".out" extension, e.g.  nec2c -i yagi.nec will cause
       nec2c to read yagi.nec as the input file and produce yagi.out as the output file.

       <b>-i</b> <u>input</u> <u>filename</u>
           Input File Name

       <b>-o</b> <u>output</u> <u>filename</u>
           Output File Name

       <b>-h</b>
           Print usage information and exit

       <b>-v</b>
           Print nec2c version number and exit
