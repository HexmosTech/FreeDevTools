</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       ocamlrun - The OCaml bytecode interpreter

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ocamlrun</b> [ <u>options</u> ] <u>filename</u> <u>argument</u> <u>...</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b><a href="../man1/ocamlrun.1.html">ocamlrun</a></b>(1) command executes bytecode files produced by the linking phase of the <b><a href="../man1/ocamlc.1.html">ocamlc</a></b>(1) command.

       The  first  non-option  argument  is taken to be the name of the file containing the executable bytecode.
       (That file is searched in the executable path as  well  as  in  the  current  directory.)  The  remaining
       arguments  are passed to the OCaml program, in the string array <b>Sys.argv</b>.  Element 0 of this array is the
       name of the bytecode executable file; elements 1 to <u>n</u> are the remaining arguments.

       In most cases, the bytecode executable files produced by the <b><a href="../man1/ocamlc.1.html">ocamlc</a></b>(1) command are  self-executable,  and
       manage to launch the <b><a href="../man1/ocamlrun.1.html">ocamlrun</a></b>(1) command on themselves automatically.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The following command-line options are recognized by <b><a href="../man1/ocamlrun.1.html">ocamlrun</a></b>(1).

       <b>-b</b>     When  the  program  aborts  due  to  an  uncaught  exception, print a detailed "back trace" of the
              execution, showing where the exception was raised and which function  calls  were  outstanding  at
              this  point.   The  back  trace  is  printed  only  if  the bytecode executable contains debugging
              information, i.e. was compiled and linked with the <b>-g</b> option to <b><a href="../man1/ocamlc.1.html">ocamlc</a></b>(1)  set.   This  option  is
              equivalent to setting the <b>b</b> flag in the OCAMLRUNPARAM environment variable (see below).

       <b>-I</b> <u>dir</u> Search  the  directory  <u>dir</u>  for  dynamically-loaded libraries, in addition to the standard search
              path.

       <b>-m</b> <u>file</u>
              Print the magic number of the bytecode executable <u>file</u> and exit.

       <b>-M</b>     Print the magic number expected for bytecode executables by this version of the runtime and exit.

       <b>-p</b>     Print the names of the primitives known to this version of <b><a href="../man1/ocamlrun.1.html">ocamlrun</a></b>(1) and exit.

       <b>-t</b>     Increment the trace level for the debug runtime (ignored by the standard runtime).

       <b>-v</b>     Direct the memory manager to print verbose messages on standard  error.   This  is  equivalent  to
              setting <b>v=63</b> in the OCAMLRUNPARAM environment variable (see below).

       <b>-version</b>
              Print version string and exit.

       <b>-vnum</b>  Print short version number and exit.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       The following environment variable are also consulted:

       <b>CAML_LD_LIBRARY_PATH</b>
              Additional directories to search for dynamically-loaded libraries.

       <b>OCAMLLIB</b>
              The  directory  containing  the  OCaml standard library.  (If <b>OCAMLLIB</b> is not set, <b>CAMLLIB</b> will be
              used instead.) Used to locate the ld.conf configuration file for dynamic  loading.   If  not  set,
              default to the library directory specified when compiling OCaml.

       <b>OCAMLRUNPARAM</b>
              Set  the  runtime system options and garbage collection parameters.  (If OCAMLRUNPARAM is not set,
              CAMLRUNPARAM will be used instead.)  This variable must be a sequence of parameter  specifications
              separated  by  commas.  A parameter specification is a letter, optionally followed by an = sign, a
              decimal number (or a hexadecimal number prefixed by <b>0x</b>), and an optional multiplier. If the letter
              is followed by anything else, the corresponding option is set to 1. Unknown letters  are  ignored.
              The  options  are  documented below; the options <b>a</b>,<b>i</b>,<b>l</b>,<b>m</b>,<b>M</b>,<b>n</b>,<b>o</b>,<b>O</b>,<b>s</b>,<b>v</b>,<b>w</b> correspond to the fields of
              the <b>control</b> record documented in  <u>The</u> <u>OCaml</u> <u>user's</u> <u>manual</u>,  chapter  "Standard  Library",  section
              "Gc".

              <b>a</b> (allocation_policy)
                     The  policy  used for allocating in the OCaml heap.  Possible values are 0 for the next-fit
                     policy, 1 for the first-fit policy, and 2 for the best-fit policy. The default is  2.   See
                     the Gc module documentation for details.

              <b>b</b>      Trigger  the  printing  of a stack backtrace when an uncaught exception aborts the program.
                     This option takes no argument.

              <b>c</b>      (cleanup_on_exit) Shut the runtime down gracefully on exit. The option also enables pooling
                     (as in caml_startup_pooled). This mode can be used  to  detect  leaks  with  a  third-party
                     memory debugger.

              <b>h</b>      The initial size of the major heap (in words).

              <b>H</b>      Allocate heap chunks by mmapping huge pages. Huge pages are locked into memory, and are not
                     swapped.

              <b>i</b> (major_heap_increment)
                     The  default  size  increment  for  the  major heap (in words if greater than 1000, else in
                     percents of the heap size).

              <b>l</b> (stack_limit)
                     The limit (in words) of the stack size.

              <b>m</b> (custom_minor_ratio)
                     Bound on floating garbage for out-of-heap memory held by custom values in the minor heap. A
                     minor GC is triggered when this much memory is held by custom values located in  the  minor
                     heap.  Expressed  as  a  percentage  of minor heap size.  Note: this only applies to values
                     allocated with <b>caml_alloc_custom_mem</b> (e.g. bigarrays).  Default: 100.

              <b>M</b> (custom_major_ratio)
                     Target ratio of floating garbage to major heap size for out-of-heap memory held  by  custom
                     values  located  in the major heap. The GC speed is adjusted to try to use this much memory
                     for dead values that are not yet collected. Expressed as a percentage of major  heap  size.
                     The default value keeps the out-of-heap floating garbage about the same size as the in-heap
                     overhead.   Note:  this  only  applies to values allocated with <b>caml_alloc_custom_mem</b> (e.g.
                     bigarrays).  Default: 44.

              <b>n</b> (custom_minor_max_size)
                     Maximum amount of out-of-heap memory for each custom value allocated  in  the  minor  heap.
                     When  a  custom  value  is allocated on the minor heap and holds more than this many bytes,
                     only this value is counted against <b>custom_minor_ratio</b> and  the  rest  is  directly  counted
                     against   <b>custom_major_ratio</b>.    Note:   this   only   applies  to  values  allocated  with
                     <b>caml_alloc_custom_mem</b> (e.g. bigarrays).  Default: 8192 bytes.

              <b>o</b> (space_overhead)
                     The major GC speed setting.

              <b>O</b> (max_overhead)
                     The heap compaction trigger setting.

              <b>p</b>      Turn on debugging support for <b>ocamlyacc</b>-generated parsers.  When this  option  is  on,  the
                     pushdown  automaton  that  executes the parsers prints a trace of its actions.  This option
                     takes no argument.

              <b>R</b>      Turn on randomization of all hash tables by default (see the <b>Hashtbl</b> module of the standard
                     library). This option takes no argument.

              <b>s</b> (minor_heap_size)
                     The size of the minor heap (in words).

              <b>t</b>      Set the trace level for the debug runtime (ignored by the standard runtime).

              <b>v</b> (verbose)
                     What GC messages to print to stderr.  This is a sum of values selected from the following:

                     <b>0x001</b> Start and end of major GC cycle.

                     <b>0x002</b> Minor collection and major GC slice.

                     <b>0x004</b> Growing and shrinking of the heap.

                     <b>0x008</b> Resizing of stacks and memory manager tables.

                     <b>0x010</b> Heap compaction.

                     <b>0x020</b> Change of GC parameters.

                     <b>0x040</b> Computation of major GC slice size.

                     <b>0x080</b> Calling of finalisation functions.

                     <b>0x100</b> Startup messages (loading the bytecode executable file, resolving shared libraries).

                     <b>0x200</b> Computation of compaction-triggering condition.

                     <b>0x400</b> Output GC statistics at program exit, in the same format as Gc.print_stat.

                     <b>0x800</b> GC debugging messages.

                     <b>0x1000</b> Address space reservation changes.

              <b>w</b> (window_size)
                     Set size of the window used by major GC for smoothing out variations in its workload.  This
                     is an integer between 1 and 50. (Default: 1)

              <b>W</b>      Print runtime warnings to stderr (such as Channel opened on file dies without being closed,
                     unflushed data, etc.)

              The multiplier is <b>k</b>,<b>M</b>, or <b>G</b>, for multiplication by 2^10, 2^20, and 2^30 respectively.

              If  the  option letter is not recognized, the whole parameter is ignored; if the equal sign or the
              number is missing, the value is taken as 1; if the multiplier is not recognized, it is ignored.

              For example, on a 32-bit machine under bash, the command <b>export</b> <b>OCAMLRUNPARAM='s=256k,v=1'</b> tells a
              subsequent <b>ocamlrun</b> to set its initial minor heap size to 1 megabyte and to print a message at the
              start of each major GC cycle.

              <b>CAMLRUNPARAM</b>
                     If OCAMLRUNPARAM is not found in the environment, then CAMLRUNPARAM will be  used  instead.
                     If CAMLRUNPARAM is also not found, then the default values will be used.

              <b>PATH</b>   List of directories searched to find the bytecode executable file.
