       <b>dumpcap</b> <b>-h|--help</b>

       <b>dumpcap</b> <b>-v|--version</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Dumpcap</b> is a network traffic dump tool. It lets you capture packet data from a live network and write the
       packets to a file. <b>Dumpcap</b>'s default capture file format is <b>pcapng</b> format. The <b>-F</b> option can be specified
       to write the output file in the <b>pcap</b> format instead.

       Without any options set it will use the libpcap, Npcap, or WinPcap library to capture traffic from the
       first available network interface and writes the received raw packet data, along with the packets' time
       stamps into a capture file.

       If the <b>-w</b> option is not specified, <b>Dumpcap</b> writes to a newly created capture file with a randomly chosen
       name. If the <b>-w</b> option is specified, <b>Dumpcap</b> writes to the file specified by that option.

       Packet capturing is performed with the pcap library. The capture filter syntax follows the rules of the
       pcap library.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       -a|--autostop  &lt;capture autostop condition&gt;

           Specify a criterion that specifies when <b>Dumpcap</b> is to stop writing to a capture file. The criterion
           is of the form <u>test:value</u>, where <u>test</u> is one of:

           <b>duration</b>:<u>value</u> Stop writing to a capture file after <u>value</u> seconds have elapsed. Floating point values
           (e.g. 0.5) are allowed.

           <b>files</b>:<u>value</u> Stop writing to capture files after <u>value</u> number of files were written.

           <b>filesize</b>:<u>value</u> Stop writing to a capture file after it reaches a size of <u>value</u> kB. If this option is
           used together with the -b option, dumpcap will stop writing to the current capture file and switch to
           the next one if filesize is reached. Note that the filesize is limited to a maximum value of 2 TB.

           <b>packets</b>:<u>value</u> Stop writing to a capture file after <u>value</u> packets have been written. Acts the same as
           <b>-c</b> &lt;capture packet count&gt;.

       -b|--ring-buffer  &lt;capture ring buffer option&gt;

           Cause <b>Dumpcap</b> to run in "multiple files" mode. In "multiple files" mode, <b>Dumpcap</b> will write to
           several capture files. When the first capture file fills up, <b>Dumpcap</b> will switch writing to the next
           file and so on.

           The created filenames are based on the filename given with the <b>-w</b> option, the number of the file and
           on the creation date and time, e.g. outfile_00001_20250714120117.pcapng,
           outfile_00002_20250714120523.pcapng, ...

           With the <u>files</u> option it’s also possible to form a "ring buffer". This will fill up new files until
           the number of files specified, at which point <b>Dumpcap</b> will discard the data in the first file and
           start writing to that file and so on. If the <u>files</u> option is not set, new files filled up until one
           of the capture stop conditions match (or until the disk is full).

           The criterion is of the form <u>key:value</u>, where <u>key</u> is one of:

           <b>duration</b>:<u>value</u> switch to the next file after <u>value</u> seconds have elapsed, even if the current file is
           not completely filled up. Floating point values (e.g. 0.5) are allowed.

           <b>files</b>:<u>value</u> begin again with the first file after <u>value</u> number of files were written (form a ring
           buffer). This value must be less than 100000. Caution should be used when using large numbers of
           files: some filesystems do not handle many files in a single directory well. The <b>files</b> criterion
           requires either <b>duration</b>, <b>interval</b> or <b>filesize</b> to be specified to control when to go to the next
           file. It should be noted that each <b>-b</b> parameter takes exactly one criterion; to specify two
           criterion, each must be preceded by the <b>-b</b> option.

           <b>filesize</b>:<u>value</u> switch to the next file after it reaches a size of <u>value</u> kB. Note that the filesize is
           limited to a maximum value of 2 TB.

           <b>interval</b>:<u>value</u> switch to the next file when the time is an exact multiple of <u>value</u> seconds. For
           example, use 3600 to switch to a new file every hour on the hour.

           <b>packets</b>:<u>value</u> switch to the next file after it contains <u>value</u> packets.

           <b>printname</b>:<u>filename</u> print the name of the most recently written file to <u>filename</u> after the file is
           closed. <u>filename</u> can be stdout or - for standard output, or stderr for standard error.

           Example: <b>-b</b> <b>filesize:1000</b> <b>-b</b> <b>files:5</b> results in a ring buffer of five files of size one megabyte
           each.

       -B|--buffer-size  &lt;capture buffer size&gt;

           Set capture buffer size (in MiB, default is 2 MiB). This is used by the capture driver to buffer
           packet data until that data can be written to disk. If you encounter packet drops while capturing,
           try to increase this size. Note that, while <b>Dumpcap</b> attempts to set the buffer size to 2 MiB by
           default, and can be told to set it to a larger value, the system or interface on which you’re
           capturing might silently limit the capture buffer size to a lower value or raise it to a higher
           value.

           This is available on UNIX-compatible systems, such as Linux, macOS, \*BSD, Solaris, and AIX, with
           libpcap 1.0.0 or later, and on Windows. It is not available on UNIX-compatible systems with earlier
           versions of libpcap.

           This option can occur multiple times. If used before the first occurrence of the <b>-i</b> option, it sets
           the default capture buffer size. If used after an <b>-i</b> option, it sets the capture buffer size for the
           interface specified by the last <b>-i</b> option occurring before this option. If the capture buffer size is
           not set specifically, the default capture buffer size is used instead.

       -c  &lt;capture packet count&gt;
           Set the maximum number of packets to read when capturing live data. Acts the same as <b>-a</b>
           <b>packets:</b>&lt;capture packet count&gt;.

       -C  &lt;byte limit&gt;
           Limit the amount of memory in bytes used for storing captured packets in memory while processing it.
           If used in combination with the <b>-N</b> option, both limits will apply. Setting this limit will enable the
           usage of the separate thread per interface.

       -d
           Dump the code generated for the capture filter in a human-readable form, and exit.

       -D|--list-interfaces
           Print a list of the interfaces on which <b>Dumpcap</b> can capture, and exit. For each network interface, a
           number and an interface name, possibly followed by a text description of the interface, is printed.
           The interface name or the number can be supplied to the <b>-i</b> flag to specify an interface on which to
           capture. The number can be useful on Windows systems, where the interfaces have long names that
           usually contain a GUID.

       -f  &lt;capture filter&gt;

           Set the capture filter expression.

           The entire filter expression must be specified as a single argument (which means that if it contains
           spaces, it must be quoted).

           This option can occur multiple times. If used before the first occurrence of the <b>-i</b> option, it sets
           the default capture filter expression. If used after an <b>-i</b> option, it sets the capture filter
           expression for the interface specified by the last <b>-i</b> option occurring before this option. If the
           capture filter expression is not set specifically, the default capture filter expression is used if
           provided.

       -F  &lt;file format&gt;
           Set the file format of the output capture file written using the <b>-w</b> option. In situations that
           require the <b>pcapng</b> format, such as capturing from multiple interfaces, this option will be
           overridden. The option <b>-F</b> without a value will list the available formats. The default is the <b>pcapng</b>
           format.

       Fewer formats are supported than by <a href="../man1/tshark.1.html">tshark</a>(1); this is intentional for security reasons. Use <b>tshark</b> or
       capture and then convert the file with <a href="../man1/editcap.1.html">editcap</a>(1) if another format is needed.

       -g
           This option causes the output file(s) to be created with group-read permission (meaning that the
           output file(s) can be read by other members of the calling user’s group).

       -h|--help
           Print the version number and options and exit.

       -i|--interface  &lt;capture interface&gt;|rpcap://&lt;host&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/&lt;capture interface&gt;|TCP@&lt;host&gt;:&lt;port&gt;|-

           Set the name of the network interface or pipe to use for live packet capture.

           Network interface names should match one of the names listed in "<b>tshark</b> <b>-D</b>" (described above); a
           number, as reported by "<b>dumpcap</b> <b>-D</b>", can also be used.

           If no interface is specified, <b>Dumpcap</b> searches the list of interfaces, choosing the first
           non-loopback interface if there are any non-loopback interfaces, and choosing the first loopback
           interface if there are no non-loopback interfaces. If there are no interfaces at all, <b>Dumpcap</b> reports
           an error and doesn’t start the capture.

           Pipe names should be either the name of a FIFO (named pipe) or "-" to read data from the standard
           input. On Windows systems, pipe names must be of the form "\\.\pipe\<b>pipename</b>". Data read from pipes
           must be in standard pcapng or pcap format. Pcapng data must have the same endianness as the capturing
           host.

           "TCP@&lt;host&gt;:&lt;port&gt;" causes <b>Dumpcap</b> to attempt to connect to the specified port on the specified host
           and read pcapng or pcap data.

           This option can occur multiple times. When capturing from multiple interfaces, the capture file will
           be saved in pcapng format, even if <b>-P</b> is specified.

       --ifdescr&gt; &lt;description&gt;
           Use <u>description</u> as the description in the capture file for the interface or pipe specified before it
           with <b>-i</b>.

       --ifname&gt; &lt;name&gt;
           Use <u>name</u> as the name in the capture file for the interface or pipe specified before it with <b>-i</b>.

       -I|--monitor-mode

           Put the interface in "monitor mode"; this is supported only on IEEE 802.11 Wi-Fi interfaces, and
           supported only on some operating systems.

           Note that in monitor mode the adapter might disassociate from the network with which it’s associated,
           so that you will not be able to use any wireless networks with that adapter. This could prevent
           accessing files on a network server, or resolving host names or network addresses, if you are
           capturing in monitor mode and are not connected to another network with another adapter.

           This option can occur multiple times. If used before the first occurrence of the <b>-i</b> option, it
           enables the monitor mode for all interfaces. If used after an <b>-i</b> option, it enables the monitor mode
           for the interface specified by the last <b>-i</b> option occurring before this option.

       -k  &lt;freq&gt;,[&lt;type&gt;],[&lt;center_freq1&gt;],[&lt;center_freq2&gt;&gt;

           Set the channel on the interface; this is supported only on IEEE 802.11 Wi-Fi interfaces, and
           supported only on some operating systems.

           <u>freq</u> is the frequency of the channel. <u>type</u> is the type of the channel, for 802.11n and 802.11ac. The
           values for <u>type</u> are

       NOHT
           Used for non-802.11n/non-802.1ac channels

       HT20
           20 MHz channel

       HT40-
           40 MHz primary channel and a lower secondary channel

       HT40+
           40 MHz primary channel and a higher secondary channel

       HT80
           80 MHz channel, with <u>centerfreq1</u> as its center frequency

       VHT80+80
           Two 80 MHz channels combined, with <u>centerfreq1</u> and <u>centerfreq2</u> as the center frequencies of the two
           channels

       VHT160
           160 MHz channel, with <u>centerfreq1</u> as its center frequency

       -L|--list-data-link-types
           List the data link types supported by the interface and exit. The reported link types can be used for
           the <b>-y</b> option.

       -M

           When used with <b>-D</b>, <b>-L</b>, <b>-S</b> or <b>--list-time-stamp-types</b> print machine-readable output. The
           machine-readable output is intended to be read by <b>Wireshark</b> and <b>TShark</b>; its format is subject to
           change from release to release.

       -n
           Save files as pcapng. This is the default. This option is deprecated and may be removed.

       -N  &lt;packet limit&gt;

           Limit the number of packets used for storing captured packets in memory while processing it. If used
           in combination with the <b>-C</b> option, both limits will apply. Setting this limit will enable the usage
           of the separate thread per interface.

       -p|--no-promiscuous-mode

           <u>Don’t</u> put the interface into promiscuous mode. Note that the interface might be in promiscuous mode
           for some other reason; hence, <b>-p</b> cannot be used to ensure that the only traffic that is captured is
           traffic sent to or from the machine on which <b>Dumpcap</b> is running, broadcast traffic, and multicast
           traffic to addresses received by that machine.

           This option can occur multiple times. If used before the first occurrence of the <b>-i</b> option, no
           interface will be put into the promiscuous mode. If used after an <b>-i</b> option, the interface specified
           by the last <b>-i</b> option occurring before this option will not be put into the promiscuous mode.

       -P
           Save files as pcap instead of the default pcapng. In situations that require pcapng, such as
           capturing from multiple interfaces, this option will be overridden. This option is deprecated in
           favor of the <b>-F</b> option and may be removed.

       -q

           When capturing packets, don’t display the continuous count of packets captured that is normally shown
           when saving a capture to a file; instead, just display, at the end of the capture, a count of packets
           captured. On systems that support the SIGINFO signal, such as various BSDs, you can cause the current
           count to be displayed by typing your "status" character (typically control-T, although it might be
           set to "disabled" by default on at least some BSDs, so you’d have to explicitly set it to use it).

       -Q

           When capturing packets, don’t display, on the standard error, the initial message indicating on what
           interfaces the capture is being done, the messages indicating to what file a capture is being
           written, the continuous count of packets captured that is normally shown when saving a capture to a
           file, and the message at the end of the capture giving a count of packets captured. This outputs less
           than the <b>-q</b> option; only true errors are displayed on the standard error.

           On systems that support the SIGINFO signal, such as various BSDs, you can cause the current count to
           be displayed by typing your "status" character (typically control-T, although it might be set to
           "disabled" by default on at least some BSDs, so you’d have to explicitly set it to use it).

       -s|--snapshot-length  &lt;capture snaplen&gt;

           Set the default snapshot length to use when capturing live data. No more than <u>snaplen</u> bytes of each
           network packet will be read into memory, or saved to disk. A value of 0 specifies a snapshot length
           of 262144, so that the full packet is captured; this is the default.

           This option can occur multiple times. If used before the first occurrence of the <b>-i</b> option, it sets
           the default snapshot length. If used after an <b>-i</b> option, it sets the snapshot length for the
           interface specified by the last <b>-i</b> option occurring before this option. If the snapshot length is not
           set specifically, the default snapshot length is used if provided.

       -S
           Print statistics for each interface once every second.

       -t
           Use a separate thread per interface.

       --temp-dir &lt;directory&gt;

           Specifies the directory into which temporary files (including capture files) are to be written. The
           default behavior on UNIX-compatible systems, such as Linux, macOS, \*BSD, Solaris, and AIX, is to use
           the environment variable <u>$TMPDIR</u> if set, and the system default, typically <u><a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a></u>, if it is not. On
           Windows, the <u>%TEMP%</u> environment variable is used, which typically defaults to
           <u>%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Temp</u>.

       -v|--version
           Print the full version information and exit.

       -w  &lt;outfile&gt;
           Write raw packet data to <u>outfile</u>. Use "-" for stdout.

       -y|--linktype  &lt;capture link type&gt;

           Set the data link type to use while capturing packets. The values reported by <b>-L</b> are the values that
           can be used.

           This option can occur multiple times. If used before the first occurrence of the <b>-i</b> option, it sets
           the default capture link type. If used after an <b>-i</b> option, it sets the capture link type for the
           interface specified by the last <b>-i</b> option occurring before this option. If the capture link type is
           not set specifically, the default capture link type is used if provided.

       --capture-comment  &lt;comment&gt;

           Add a capture comment to the output file, if supported by the output file format.

           This option is only available if we output the captured packets to a single file.

           This option may be specified multiple times. Note that Wireshark currently only displays the first
           comment of a capture file.

       --list-time-stamp-types
           List time stamp types supported for the interface. If no time stamp type can be set, no time stamp
           types are listed.

       --time-stamp-type  &lt;type&gt;
           Change the interface’s timestamp method.

       --update-interval  &lt;interval&gt;
           Set the length of time in milliseconds between new packet reports during a capture. Also sets the
           granularity of file duration conditions. The default value is 100ms.

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTIC</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       --log-level &lt;level&gt;
           Set the active log level. Supported levels in lowest to highest order are "noisy", "debug", "info",
           "message", "warning", "critical", and "error". Messages at each level and higher will be printed, for
           example "warning" prints "warning", "critical", and "error" messages and "noisy" prints all messages.
           Levels are case insensitive.

       --log-fatal &lt;level&gt;
           Abort the program if any messages are logged at the specified level or higher. For example, "warning"
           aborts on any "warning", "critical", or "error" messages.

       --log-domains &lt;list&gt;
           Only print messages for the specified log domains, e.g. "GUI,Epan,sshdump". List of domains must be
           comma-separated. Can be negated with "!" as the first character (inverts the match).
