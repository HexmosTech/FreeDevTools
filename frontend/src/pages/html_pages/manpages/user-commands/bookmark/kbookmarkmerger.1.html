</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       kbookmarkmerger - A program for merging a given set of bookmarks into the user's list of bookmarks.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>

       <b>kbookmarkmerger</b> {directory}

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>kbookmarkmerger</b> is a program for merging a given set of bookmarks into the user's set of bookmarks; if
       the user doesn't have any bookmarks created yet, a new bookmark list is created and the given bookmarks
       are inserted into it. While doing this, <b>kbookmarkmerger</b> keeps track of which files were merged in a
       previous run already, so no bookmark will get installed to the user's bookmarks more than once.

       The traditionally used approach to achieve something like this was to use carefully crafted skeleton home
       directories when creating a new user account, to provide the user with a standard set of bookmarks. The
       problem with this approach is that after the user account has been created, no new bookmarks can be
       propagated.

       This mechanism is useful for system administrators who want to propagate a bookmark pointing to a certain
       document (for instance, important notes about the system) to all users. Distributors might find it useful
       as well, for instance by augmenting the software packages they supply with bookmark files which
       <b>kbookmarkmerger</b> merges into the user's bookmark list when the package is installed. That way,
       documentation shipped with a software package is easily and visibly accessible right after the package
       has been installed.

       The only parameter required by <b>kbookmarkmerger</b> is the name of a directory which shall be scanned for
       bookmark files. All files in the given directory will be considered for being merged into the user's
       setup. The files in the given directory should be valid XBEL files.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
           joe@hal9000:~&gt; <b>kbookmarkmerger</b> <b>/usr/local/extra-bookmarks</b>

       Merges all bookmark files stored in /usr/local/extra-bookmarks into joe's list of bookmarks.

</pre><h4><b>STANDARDS</b></h4><pre>
           <b>XBEL</b> <b>specification</b>[2]

</pre><h4><b>RESTRICTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       When determining whether a given bookmark file has been merged into the user's bookmarks already or not,
       <b>kbookmarkmerger</b> merely looks at the filename of the bookmark file - the contents are not checked at all.
       This means that changing a bookmark file which was already merged into a user's bookmarks will not
       trigger merging it once again.

       Also note that in case a user modifies a bookmark which was merged into his setup, the original bookmark
       file will be left unmodified.
