</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       cdargs - bookmarks and browser for cd shell built-in

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>cdargs</b> [<u>OPTIONS</u>]
       <b>function</b> <b>cv</b> <b>()</b> <b>{</b>
           <b>cdargs</b> <b>"$1"</b> <b>&amp;&amp;</b> <b>cd</b> <b>"`cat</b> <b>"$HOME/.cdargsresult"`"</b> <b>;</b>
       <b>}</b>
       <b>cv</b> [<u>Needle</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       With  <u>cdargs</u>  you  can  jump  to various places throughout the file-system that are defined using a plain
       text, line oriented bookmarks file.

       You can create bookmarks by editing your bookmarks file "$HOME/.cdargs" using your  favorite  editor,  by
       using the "--add" option to <u>cdargs</u> or by using the built-in mechanism that will be described later.

       While  you  are  in  <u>cdargs</u>  you  can use various commands to navigate through your list of bookmarks and
       through the file-system. These are described below in the section "COMMANDS". The most commonly used  and
       most  obvious  commands  are the up/down keys for navigation, "ENTER" for selection of a path and "q" for
       quit.

       To be able to actually use this program together with the shell built-in "cd"  command  you  must  use  a
       little  trick  by  defining a shell function. Of course the syntax for this is different between the <u>csh</u>-
       like shells (like <u>tcsh</u>) and the <u>sh</u>-like shells (like <u>bash</u>).

       For <u>sh</u>-like shells:
       function cv () {
           cdargs "$1" &amp;&amp; cd "`cat "$HOME/.cdargsresult"`" ;
       }

       For <u>csh</u>-like shells:
       alias cv 'cdargs \!* &amp;&amp; cd `cat $HOME/.cdargsresult`'

       Now you only have to put the <u>cdargs</u> binary somewhere into your path.

       Of course you can create functions and/or aliases for different purposes. You might want  to  add  a  <u>pwd</u>
       call  to  echo your current directories or put --nowrap in your functions to enable a different scrolling
       behavior. See section SHELL FUNCTIONS below.

       Since version 1.19 cdargs brings a collection of bash functions (and since 1.20 tcsh aliases,  too)  with
       it.  You  only have to source this in your <a href="file:~/.profile">~/.profile</a> or <a href="file:~/.bashrc">~/.bashrc</a> (or <a href="file:~/.tcsh">~/.tcsh</a>) and you get nice kinds of
       magic prepared (completion...). Please read the cdargs-bash.sh or cdargs-tcsh.csh  respectively  for  the
       documentation of these functions.

</pre><h4><b>COMMAND-LINE</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       You  can  call  <u>cdargs</u>  with a few options, but otherwise you probably won't call it directly but via the
       function you defined.

       <b>-h</b> or <b>--help</b>
              display usage information and exit.

       <b>-v</b> or <b>--version</b>
              output version information and exit.

       <b>-a</b> or <b>--add=</b>[:<u>desc</u>:]<u>path</u>
              add <u>path</u> to the bookmarks list using the optional <u>desc</u> as description string.

       <b>-f</b> or <b>--file=</b><u>FILE</u>
              uses the given FILE as bookmarks file

       <b>-u</b> or <b>--user=</b><u>USER</u>
              read the default bookmarks file of USER. Won't modify that file.

       <b>-o</b> or <b>--output=</b><u>FILE</u>
              use FILE as the result-file (who knows what The World might make of  this  feature  that  I  can't
              imagine...)

       <b>-b</b> or <b>--browse</b>
              start <u>cdargs</u> in BROWSE mode in the current directory.

       <b>-r</b> or <b>--noresolve</b>
              Don't  exit  with a result when the <u>Needle</u> matches a description exactly (which is some every-day-
              magic) but show a list (even if it contains just one entry).

       <b>-c</b> or <b>--cwd</b>
              Make the current working directory the current entry on startup if it appears on the list.

       <b>--nowrap</b>
              Don't wrap the cursor around when hitting the end of the list.

       <u>Needle</u> The Needle performs some magic which I hope improves the usage of cdargs.

              The Needle is examined in the following order and the first thing that fits is taken.

              If <u>Needle</u> is a one-digit integer the appropriate entry is preselected.

              Otherwise if <u>Needle</u> is a string each entry of the list is checked whether it contains <u>Needle</u>.

              Then <u>Needle</u> has two functions:
              If it just matches a substring of either path or description that option is placed in the list.

              If it <b>exactly</b> matches a description string this is the result (that means cdargs closes the curses
              window, exits and the changing of directories takes place).

              If it doesn't match a line, that line won't be displayed.

              And to make things even more complicated you can affect this behavior by using  the  "--noresolve"
              option.  This  option  is used when you think you give a <u>Needle</u> which matches descriptions exactly
              but you don't want it to be resolved if it does. This option is  internally  turned  on  when  you
              delete  an  entry  (otherwise  the  deletion of entries until only one entry is left would lead to
              resolving) or when the bookmarks file contains only one entry.

              Finally, if the filtered list (but not the bookmarks file) contains only one entry it is  selected
              and the program exits successfully, unless you chose --noresolve.

              I can only hope that you understand this nested if babble...

              Please  note,  that  the  existence  of a <u>Needle</u> disables the saving of the list at the end of the
              program.

</pre><h4><b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       When you are in <u>cdargs</u> you have two modes and several commands at your hands.

       The two modes are LIST (when your bookmark list is displayed) and BROWSE (when you navigate  through  the
       file-system).

       The navigation keys are mostly available in Emacs and vi style for all maniacs out there.

       <b>Common</b> <b>Keys</b>

       <b>&lt;UP&gt;/&lt;DOWN&gt;</b> or <b>k/j</b> or <b>C-n/C-p</b>
              move selection up/down and scroll.

       <b>&lt;ENTER&gt;</b>
              select current entry.

       <b>&lt;TAB&gt;</b>  toggle modes: LIST or BROWSE.

       <b>&lt;HOME&gt;/&lt;END&gt;</b> or <b>C-a/C-e</b>
              goto first/last entry in list.

       <b>c</b>      add current directory to list.

       <b>C</b>      add current directory to list but ask the user for a description

       <b>&lt;PgUp&gt;/&lt;PgDown&gt;</b> or <b>C-v</b>
              Scroll the list in 10-line-steps.  This will never wraparound and does not honor the nowrap-option

       <b>e,</b> <b>v</b>   edit the list in $EDITOR.

       <b>H,</b> <b>?</b>   show the help-screen.

       <b>~,</b> <b>/</b>   browse home/root directory.

       <b>q</b>      quit - saving the list.

       <b>C-c,</b> <b>C-g,</b> <b>C-[</b>
              abort - don't save the list.

       <b>Keys</b> <b>in</b> <b>BROWSE</b> <b>mode</b>

       <b>&lt;LEFT&gt;,</b> <b>h,</b> <b>C-b</b>
              descent into current directory.

       <b>&lt;RIGHT&gt;,</b> <b>l,</b> <b>C-f</b>
              up one directory.

       <b>[num]</b>  make [num] the current highlighted entry

       <b>a</b>      add current entry to list.

       <b>A</b>      add current entry to list but ask the user for a description, just like with 'c' and 'C'.

       <b>.</b>      toggle display of hidden files.

       <b>Keys</b> <b>in</b> <b>LIST</b> <b>mode</b>

       <b>[num]</b>  select and resolve entry [num] if displayed.

       <b>&lt;LEFT&gt;,</b> <b>h,</b> <b>C-b</b>
              descent into the current entry.

       <b>&lt;RIGHT&gt;,</b> <b>l,</b> <b>C-f</b>
              up one directory from current dir.

       <b>d</b> or <b>C-d</b>
              delete current entry from list.

       <b>s</b> or <b>t</b> swap (transpose) two entries of the list.

       <b>M</b> or <b>m</b> move  an  entry  up  or  down in the list and set the current position afterwards so that repeated
              keystrokes keep moving the same entry up and down.

</pre><h4><b>SHELL</b> <b>FUNCTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       In addition to the shell function mentioned above you might wish to add other commands to your  function.
       One example is to echo the directory you changed to:

       function cv () {
           cdargs "$1" &amp;&amp; cd "`cat "$HOME/.cdargsresult"`"
                       &amp;&amp; pwd;
       }

       Or you can remove the file in which <u>cdargs</u> reports it's result:

       function cv () {
           cdargs "$1" &amp;&amp; cd "`cat "$HOME/.cdargsresult"`"
                       &amp;&amp; rm -f "$HOME/.cdargsresult";
       }

       Since  version  1.19  cdargs  comes  with  a file of preset functions for bash: see cdargs-bash.sh in the
       distribution. From now on you only have to source that file if you are using a <u>sh</u>-like shell.   Then  you
       can use the shell completion to switch directories even faster by typing

       cv [TAB]

       Since version 1.20 cdargs comes with a file of rudimentary aliases (and completion) for the <u>tcsh</u>.
       Any volunteers for porting all the bash functionality to <u>tcsh</u> are welcome.

</pre><h4><b>DISPLAY</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>cdargs</u> window has one line at the bottom for the display of messages like when you added to your list
       or when you hit an unknown key.

       The  second line from the bottom is a status line which shows the current directory and a one letter code
       for the current operation mode:

       <b>B</b>      for BROWSE

       <b>L</b>      for LIST

       The largest part of the display is used to show you either the list of your bookmarks or the contents  of
       the  current  directory.  On the left side you'll probably find a number which you can use for a slightly
       quicker jumping compared to using the cursor movement. These numbers can be  moved  as  described  above.
       Next comes the short description of an entry in brackets. This is convient when you have quite long paths
       in  your  bookmarks  and  most  of them start with the same base (e.g.  /home/user). Finally there is the
       actual absolute path you'll be warping to when finishing. Obviously the current entry is highlighted.

       If the path is preced by a "!" it points to an invalid directory. A  bookmark  pointing  to  the  current
       working directory is displayed in bold font (if the terminal emulation understands that attribute).

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
