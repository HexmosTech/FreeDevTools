</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       splint - A tool for statically checking C programs

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>splint</b> [options]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>splint</b>  is  a tool for statically checking C programs for security vulnerabilities and common programming
       mistakes. With minimal effort, splint can be used as a better lint.  If  additional  effort  is  invested
       adding annotations to programs, splint can perform stronger checks than can be done by any standard lint.
       For  full  documentation, install the splint-doc-html Debian package.  This man page only covers a few of
       the available options.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-help</b> Shows help

       <b>Initialization</b>

       These flags control directories and files used by splint. They may be used from the command line or in an
       options file, but may not be used as control comments in the source code. Except where noted.  they  have
       the same meaning preceded by - or +.

       <b>-tmpdir</b> <u>directory</u>
             Set directory for writing temp files. Default is <a href="file:/tmp/.">/tmp/.</a>

       <b>-I</b> <u>directory</u>
             Add  directory  to  path  searched  for  C include files. Note there is no space after the I, to be
             consistent with C preprocessor flags.

       <b>-S</b> <u>directory</u>
             Add directory to path search for .lcl specification files.

       <b>-f</b> <u>file</u>
             Load options file &lt;file&gt;. If this flag is used from the command line, the default <a href="file:~/.splintrc">~/.splintrc</a>  file
             is not loaded. This flag may be used in an options file to load in another options file.

       <b>-nof</b>  Prevents  the  default options files (./.splintrc and <a href="file:~/.splintrc">~/.splintrc</a>) from being loaded. (Setting -nof
             overrides +nof, causing the options files to be loaded normally.)

       <b>-systemdirs</b> <u>directories</u>
             Set directories for system files (default is  "<a href="file:/usr/include">/usr/include</a>").  Separate  directories  with  colons
             (e.g.,  "<a href="file:/usr/include">/usr/include</a>:<a href="file:/usr/local/lib">/usr/local/lib</a>").  Flag settings propagate to files in a system directory. If
             -systemdirerrors is set, no errors are reported for files in system directories.

       <b>Pre-processor</b>

       These flags are used to define or undefine pre-processor  constants.   The  -I&lt;directory&gt;  flag  is  also
       passed to the C pre-processor.

       <b>-D</b> <u>initializer</u>
             Passed to the C pre-processor.

       <b>-U</b> <u>initializer</u>
             Passed to the C pre-processor

       <b>Libraries</b> These flags control the creation and use of libraries.

       <b>-dump</b> <u>file</u>
             Save state in &lt;file&gt; for loading. The default extension .lcd is added if &lt;file&gt; has no extension.

       <b>-load</b> <u>file</u>
             Load  state  from  &lt;file&gt;  (created by -dump). The default extension .lcd is added if &lt;file&gt; has no
             extension. Only one library file may be loaded.

             By default, the standard library is loaded if the -load flag is not used to load a user library. If
             no user library is loaded, one of the following flags may be used to select  a  different  standard
             library.  Precede  the  flag  by  +  to load the described library (or prevent a library from being
             loaded using nolib). See Apppendix F for information on the provided libraries.

       <b>-nolib</b>
             Do not load any library. This prevents the standard library from being loaded.

       <b>-ansi-lib</b>
             Use the ANSI standard library (selected by default).

       <b>-strict-lib</b>
             Use strict version of the ANSI standard library.

       <b>-posix-lib</b>
             Use the POSIX standard library.

       <b>-posix-strict-lib</b>
             Use the strict version of the POSIX standard library.

       <b>-1-lib</b>
             Use UNIX version of standard library.

       <b>-1-strict-lib</b>
             Use the strict version of the UNIX standard library.

       <b>Output</b>

       These flags control what additional  information  is  printed  by  splint.  Setting  +&lt;flag&gt;  causes  the
       described information to be printed; setting -&lt;flag&gt; prevents it. By default, all these flags are off.

       <b>-usestderr</b>
             Send  error  messages  to standard error (instead of standard out).  This flag has been replaced by
             more  precise  flags  for  controlling  the  warning,  status  message  and  fatal  error   streams
             independently.  See the output of splint +usestderr

       <b>-showsummary</b>
             Show  a  summary  of  all  errors  reported  and  suppressed.  Counts  of suppressed errors are not
             necessarily correct since turning a flag off may prevent some checking  from  being  done  to  save
             computation,  and  errors  that  are  not  reported  may  propagate  differently from when they are
             reported.

       <b>-showscan</b>
             Show file names as they are processed.

       <b>-showalluses</b>
             Show list of uses of all external identifiers sorted by number of uses.

       <b>-stats</b>
             Display number of lines processed and checking time.

       <b>-timedist</b>
             Display distribution of where checking time is spent.

       <b>-quiet</b>
             Suppress herald and error count. (If quiet is not set, splint prints  out  a  herald  with  version
             information before checking begins, and a line summarizing the total number of errors reported.)

       <b>-whichlib</b>
             Print out the standard library filename and creation information.

       <b>-limit</b> <u>number</u>
             At  most  &lt;number&gt;  similar errors are reported consecutively. Further errors are suppressed, and a
             message showing the number of suppressed messages is printed.

       <b>Expected</b> <b>Errors</b>

       Normally, splint will expect to report no errors. The exit status will be success (0) if  no  errors  are
       reported,  and  failure  if  any  errors  are  reported.  Flags can be used to set the expected number of
       reported errors.  Because of the provided error suppression mechanisms, these options should probably not
       be used for final checking real programs but may be useful in developing programs using make.

       <b>-expect</b> <b>&lt;number&gt;</b>
             Exactly &lt;number&gt; code errors are expected.  splint  will  exit  with  failure  exit  status  unless
             &lt;number&gt; code errors are detected.

       <b>-Message</b> <b>Format</b>
             These  flags  control  how  messages  are  printed. They may be set at the command line, in options
             files, or locally in syntactic comments. The linelen and limit flags may be preceded by + or - with
             the same meaning; for the other flags, + turns on the describe printing and - turns it off. The box
             to the left of each flag gives its default value.

       <b>-showcolumn</b>
             Show column number where error is found. Default: +

       <b>-showfunc</b>
             Show name of function (or macro) definition containing error. The function  name  is  printed  once
             before the first message detected in that function. Default: +

       <b>-showallconjs</b>
             Show all possible alternate types (see Section 8.2.2). Default: -

       <b>-paren-file-format</b>
             Use file(line) format in messages.

       <b>-hints</b>
             Provide  hints describing an error and how a message may be suppressed for the first error reported
             in each error class. Default: +

       <b>-forcehints</b>
             Provide hints for all errors reported, even if the hint has already been  displayed  for  the  same
             error class. Default: -

       <b>-linelen</b> <u>number</u>
             Set  length  of maximum message line to &lt;number&gt; characters. splint will split messages longer than
             &lt;number&gt; characters long into multiple lines. Default: 80

       <b>Mode</b> <b>Selector</b> <b>Flags</b>

       Mode selects flags set the mode checking flags to predefined values. They provide  a  quick  coarse-grain
       way  of  controlling what classes of errors are reported. Specific checking flags may be set after a mode
       flag to override the mode settings. Mode flags may be  used  locally,  however  the  mode  settings  will
       override  specific  command line flag settings. A warning is produced if a mode flag is used after a mode
       checking flag has been set.

       These are brief descriptions to give a general idea of what each mode does.  To  see  the  complete  flag
       settings in each mode, use splint -help modes. A mode flag has the same effect when used with either + or
       -.

       <b>-weak</b> Weak  checking,  intended for typical unannotated C code. No modifies checking, macro checking, rep
             exposure, or clean interface checking is done. Return values of type int may be ignored. The  types
             bool,  int,  char  and  user-defined  enum  types  are  all  equivalent. Old style declarations are
             unreported.

       <b>-standard</b>
             The default mode. All checking done by weak, plus modifies checking, global alias checking, use all
             parameters, using released storage, ignored return values or any type, macro checking,  unreachable
             code, infinite loops, and fall-through cases. The types bool, int and char are distinct.  Old style
             declarations are reported.

       <b>-checks</b>
             Moderately  strict  checking.  All  checking done by standard, plus must modification checking, rep
             exposure, return alias, memory management and complete interfaces.

       <b>-strict</b>
             Absurdly strict checking. All checking done by checks, plus modifications and global variables used
             in unspecified functions, strict standard library, and strict typing  of  C  operators.  A  special
             reward will be presented to the first person to produce a real program that produces no errors with
             strict checking.
