       stilts-pixfoot - Generates Multi-Order Coverage maps

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>

       <b>stilts</b> <b>pixfoot</b> [ifmt=<u>&lt;in-format&gt;</u>] [istream=<u>true|false</u>] [in=<u>&lt;table&gt;</u>] [icmd=<u>&lt;cmds&gt;</u>] [order=<u>&lt;int-value&gt;</u>]
                      [ra=<u>&lt;expr&gt;</u>] [dec=<u>&lt;expr&gt;</u>] [radius=<u>&lt;expr&gt;</u>] [mocfmt=<u>fits|json</u>] [out=<u>&lt;out-file&gt;</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>pixfoot</u>  takes a list of sky positions from an input table and generates a pixel map describing a sky re‐
       gion which includes them all. Currently the output is to a format known as  a  Multi-Order  Coverage  map
       (MOC), which is a HEALPix-based format composed of a list of HEALPix pixels of different sizes, which can
       efficiently describe complex regions. Other output formats may be introduced in the future.

       See also the Coverage class for MOC-related functions.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ifmt=</b><u>&lt;in-format&gt;</u>
              Specifies the format of the input table as specified by parameter <u>in</u>. The known formats are listed
              in  SUN/256. This flag can be used if you know what format your table is in. If it has the special
              value <u>(auto)</u> (the default), then an attempt will be made to detect the format of the  table  auto‐
              matically.  This cannot always be done correctly however, in which case the program will exit with
              an error explaining which formats were attempted. This parameter is ignored  for  scheme-specified
              tables.

       <b>istream=</b><u>true|false</u>
              If  set true, the input table specified by the <u>in</u> parameter will be read as a stream. It is neces‐
              sary to give the <u>ifmt</u> parameter in this case. Depending on the required operations and  processing
              mode,  this  may  cause  the  read  to fail (sometimes it is necessary to read the table more than
              once). It is not normally necessary to set this flag; in most cases the data will be streamed  au‐
              tomatically  if that is the best thing to do. However it can sometimes result in less resource us‐
              age when processing large files in certain formats (such as VOTable). This  parameter  is  ignored
              for scheme-specified tables.

       <b>in=</b><u>&lt;table&gt;</u>
              The location of the input table. This may take one of the following forms:

                * A filename.

                * A URL.

                * The special value "<u>-</u>", meaning standard input. In this case the input format must be given ex‐
                  plicitly using the <u>ifmt</u> parameter. Note that not all formats can be streamed in this way.

                * A scheme specification of the form <u>:&lt;scheme-name&gt;:&lt;scheme-args&gt;</u>.

                * A  system command line with either a "<u>&lt;</u>" character at the start, or a "<u>|</u>" character at the end
                  ("<u>&lt;syscmd</u>" or "<u>syscmd|</u>"). This executes the given pipeline and reads from its standard output.
                  This will probably only work on unix-like systems.
               In any case, compressed data in one of the supported compression formats (gzip, Unix compress  or
              bzip2) will be decompressed transparently.

       <b>icmd=</b><u>&lt;cmds&gt;</u>
              Specifies  processing  to be performed on the input table as specified by parameter <u>in</u>, before any
              other processing has taken place. The value of this parameter is one or more of  the  filter  com‐
              mands described in SUN/256. If more than one is given, they must be separated by semicolon charac‐
              ters  (";").  This parameter can be repeated multiple times on the same command line to build up a
              list of processing steps. The sequence of commands  given  in  this  way  defines  the  processing
              pipeline which is performed on the table.

              Commands  may  alternatively  be  supplied in an external file, by using the indirection character
              '<u>@</u>'. Thus a value of "<u>@filename</u>" causes the file <u>filename</u> to be read for a list of filter commands
              to execute. The commands in the file may be separated by newline characters and/or semicolons, and
              lines which are blank or which start with a '<u>#</u>' character are ignored. A backslash character '<u>\fR'</u>
              <u>at</u> <u>the</u> <u>end</u> <u>of</u> <u>a</u> <u>line</u> <u>joins</u> <u>it</u> <u>with</u> <u>the</u> <u>following</u> <u>line.</u>

       <b>order=</b><u>&lt;int-value&gt;</u>
              Maximum HEALPix order for the MOC. This defines the maximum resolution of the output coverage map.
              The angular resolution corresponding to order k is approximately 180/sqrt(3.Pi)/2^k (3520*2^-k ar‐
              cmin).

       <b>ra=</b><u>&lt;expr&gt;</u>
              Right ascension in degrees for the position of each row of the input table. This may simply  be  a
              column name, or it may be an algebraic expression calculated from columns as explained in SUN/256.
              If  left  blank, an attempt is made to guess from UCDs, column names and unit annotations what ex‐
              pression to use.

       <b>dec=</b><u>&lt;expr&gt;</u>
              Declination in degrees for the position of each row of the input table. This may simply be a  col‐
              umn name, or it may be an algebraic expression calculated from columns as explained in SUN/256. If
              left  blank, an attempt is made to guess from UCDs, column names and unit annotations what expres‐
              sion to use.

       <b>radius=</b><u>&lt;expr&gt;</u>
              Expression which evaluates to the radius in degrees of the cone at each row of  the  input  table.
              The default is "<u>0</u>", which treats each position as a point rather than a cone, but a constant or an
              expression as described in SUN/256 may be used instead.

       <b>mocfmt=</b><u>fits|json</u>
              Determines the output format for the MOC file.

       <b>out=</b><u>&lt;out-file&gt;</u>
              The  location  of  the  output file. This is usually a filename to write to. If it is equal to the
              special value "-" the output will be written to standard output.
