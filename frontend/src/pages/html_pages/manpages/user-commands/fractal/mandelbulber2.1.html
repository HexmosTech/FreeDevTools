</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       mandelbulber2 - 3D fractal renderer and animator

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>

       <b>mandelbulber2</b> [<u>options</u>] [<u>files</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This manual page documents briefly the <b>mandelbulber2</b> command.

       This manual page was written for the Debian distribution because the original program does not have a
       manual page.

       <b>mandelbulber2</b> is a ray-tracing application for drawing three-dimensional fractals, like Mandelbulb,
       Mandelbox, Julia, trigonometric, hypercomplex or IFS fractals. It is highly customizable and features
       complex shading algorithms (among the others there are shadows, depth of field, ambient occlusion).

       <b>mandelbulber2</b> is also able to produce animations and has a simple built-in 3D navigator for exploring the
       fractals.

       <b>mandelbulber2</b> is a complete rewriting from scratches of <b>mandelbulber</b> by the same author. It will obsolete
       Mandelbulber as soon as it reaches feature parity.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>mandelbulber2</b> is mainly meant to be used via its graphical interface and doesn't support many
       command-line arguments. You can have a list of the supported options with their meanings using the <b>--help</b>
       option.

       The non-option arguments will be interpreted as settings file names to load once the program has started.

</pre><h4><b>AUTHOR</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Giovanni</b> <b>Mascellani</b> &lt;<a href="mailto:gio@debian.org">gio@debian.org</a>&gt;
           Wrote this manpage for the Debian system.
