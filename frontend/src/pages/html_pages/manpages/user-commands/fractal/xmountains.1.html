</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       xmountains - A fractal landscape generator.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>xmountains</b> [ <b>bqgPdEmMrBnZIASTWFGCapcevfRltxsXYH</b> ]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>xmountains</b> is a X11 based fractal landscape generator.  It generates random fractal surfaces and displays
       them in a window.  While the program is running the fractal is continuously extended on the right and the
       image is scrolled from right to left to expose the newly generated area.

       Flags:
       <b>-b</b>
              Use the root window.
       <b>-q</b>
              Reset  the  root window when the program exits. This option is ignored unless the program is using
              the root window.
       <b>-g</b> <b>[string]</b>
              Set the geometry of the window.
       <b>-P</b> <b>[filename]</b>
              Write the PID to the specified file.
       <b>-d</b> <b>[string]</b>
              Set the display.
       <b>-E</b>
              Toggle the way that window repainting is done. By default the image pixmap  is  installed  as  the
              background  pixmap  of the window and window repainting should be performed automatically by the X
              server. If this does not work on a particular system then this flag can be used to enable explicit
              expose event processing. In the default mode root window images will remain  in  place  after  the
              program exits.
       <b>-m</b>
              Display a map of the surface rather than a perspective view.
       <b>-M</b>
              Disable reflections in the water.
       <b>-r</b> <b>[20]</b>
              To  reduce  the  load  on  the  X  server  the  program generates several columns of pixels before
              scrolling the image. This flag sets  the  number  of  columns.   A  negative  value  reverses  the
              direction of scrolling. A value of zero makes the program scan across the window without scrolling
              at all.
       <b>-B</b> <b>[80]</b>
              Set the number of shades of each colour that the program allocates.
       <b>-n</b> <b>[245]</b>
              Set  a  maximum  number  of  colours to use. This is just a different way of setting the number of
              shades of each colour.
       <b>-Z</b> <b>[10]</b>
              Set the number of seconds that the program sleeps after scrolling the screen.
       <b>-I</b> <b>[40.0]</b>
              Set the vertical angle of illumination.
       <b>-A</b> <b>[0.0]</b>
              Set the horizontal angle of illumination.
       <b>-S</b> <b>[0.6]</b>
              Set the vertical stretch of the surface.
       <b>-T</b> <b>[0.5]</b>
              Set the vertical shift of the surface.
       <b>-W</b> <b>[0.5]</b>
              Set the height where the water occurs.
       <b>-F</b> <b>[1]</b>
              Reduce the variation in the foreground height to ensure a good view of the surface. This flag sets
              the number of iterations for which the foreground height is constrained to a constant value.
       <b>-G</b> <b>[-1.0]</b>
              Mean altitude for the for foreground.
       <b>-C</b> <b>[0.3]</b>
              Set the contour parameter. The base colour of a point depends on  its  height  and  how  flat  the
              surface is. This parameter controls the relative importance of these factors.
       <b>-a</b> <b>[2.5]</b>
              Set the Altitude of the viewpoint.
       <b>-p</b> <b>[4.0]</b>
              Set the distance of the viewpoint from the front of the surface.
       <b>-c</b> <b>[1.0]</b>
              Set the contrast parameter. Values too far from 1.0 will give strange results
       <b>-e</b> <b>[0.3]</b>
              Set  the ambient light level. This is a fractional value that sets how bright shaded areas will be
              compared to fully illuminated ground.
       <b>-v</b> <b>[0.6]</b>
              Set the vertical light level. The program also implements a secondary light  source  shining  from
              directly  above  the  surface. This flag sets how bright this light source is relative to the main
              light source.
       <b>-f</b> <b>[0.65]</b>
              Set the fractal dimension of the surface. This should be in the range 0.5-1.0.
       <b>-R</b> <b>[0]</b>
              Set the seed for the random number generator. A value of 0 causes the seed  to  be  set  from  the
              clock.
       <b>-l</b> <b>[10]</b>
              Set the width of the surface. Increasing this value by one doubles the width of the surface.
       <b>-t</b> <b>[2]</b>
              Set  the number of non-fractal iterations. Increasing this value by one doubles the average number
              of mountains across the width of the surface.
       <b>-x</b>
              Use cross updates (see under -H)
       <b>-s</b> <b>[1]</b>
              Control the regeneration steps used to reduce creasing.  There  are  three  possible  regeneration
              steps controlled by the first 3 bits of this flag value.  (see under -H)
       <b>-X</b> <b>[0.0]</b>
              regeneration step parameter (see under -H)
       <b>-Y</b> <b>[0.0]</b>
              regeneration step parameter (see under -H)
       <b>-H</b>
              Print a short description of the algorithm explaining the -x -s -X and -Y parameters.
