</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       scancel - Used to signal jobs or job steps that are under the control of Slurm.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>scancel</b> [<u>OPTIONS</u>...] [<u>job_id</u>[_<u>array_id</u>][.<u>step_id</u>]] [<u>job_id</u>[_<u>array_id</u>][.<u>step_id</u>]...]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>scancel</b>  is  used  to signal or cancel jobs, job arrays or job steps.  An arbitrary number of jobs or job
       steps may be signaled using job specification filters or a space separated list of  specific  job  and/or
       job  step  IDs.   If the job ID of a job array is specified with an array ID value and the job associated
       with the array ID value has been split from  the  array,  then  only  that  job  array  element  will  be
       cancelled.   If  the  job  ID of a job array is specified without an array ID value or the array ID value
       corresponds to a job that has not been split from  the  array,  then  all  job  array  elements  will  be
       cancelled.   While a heterogeneous job is in a PENDING state, only the entire job can be cancelled rather
       than its individual components.  A request to cancel an individual component of a heterogeneous job while
       in a PENDING state will return an error.  After the job has begun execution, an individual component  can
       be  cancelled  except for component zero. If component zero is cancelled, the whole het job is cancelled.
       A job or job step can only be signaled by the owner of that job or user root.  If an attempt is  made  by
       an  unauthorized  user to signal a job or job step, an error message will be printed and the job will not
       be signaled.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-A</b>, <b>--account</b>=<u>account</u>
              Restrict the scancel operation to jobs under this charge account.

       <b>-b</b>, <b>--batch</b>
              By default, signals other than SIGKILL are not sent to the batch step  (the  shell  script).  With
              this option <b>scancel</b> signals only the batch step, but not any other steps.  This is useful when the
              shell  script has to trap the signal and take some application defined action.  Most shells cannot
              handle signals while a command is running (i.e. is a child process of  the  batch  step),  so  the
              shell  needs to wait until the command ends to then handle the signal.  Children of the batch step
              are not signaled with this option. If this is desired, use <b>-f</b>, <b>--full</b> instead.  <b>NOTE</b>: If used with
              <b>-f</b>, <b>--full</b>, this option is ignored.  <b>NOTE</b>: This option is not applicable if <u>step_id</u> is  specified.
              <b>NOTE</b>:  The  shell  itself may exit upon receipt of many signals.  You may avoid this by explicitly
              trap signals within the shell script (e.g. "trap &lt;arg&gt; &lt;signals&gt;"). See  the  shell  documentation
              for details.

       <b>-M</b>, <b>--clusters</b>=&lt;<u>string</u>&gt;
              Cluster  to  issue commands to. Implies <b>--ctld</b>.  Note that the <b>slurmdbd</b> must be up for this option
              to work properly, unless running in a federation with <b>FederationParameters=fed_display</b> configured.

       <b>--ctld</b> If this option is not used with <b>--interactive</b>, <b>--sibling</b>, or specific step ids, then this issues a
              single request to the slurmctld to signal all jobs matching the specified  filters.  This  greatly
              improves  the  performance of slurmctld and scancel. Otherwise, this option causes scancel to send
              each job signal request to the slurmctld daemon rather than directly to the slurmd daemons,  which
              increases  overhead,  but  offers  better  fault  tolerance.  <b>--ctld</b>  is  the  default behavior on
              architectures using front end nodes, or when the <b>--clusters</b> option is used.

       <b>-c</b>, <b>--cron</b>
              Confirm request to cancel a job submitted by scrontab.  This  option  only  has  effect  with  the
              "explicit_scancel" option is set in <b>ScronParameters</b>.

       <b>-f</b>, <b>--full</b>
              By  default,  signals  other  than SIGKILL are not sent to the batch step (the shell script). With
              this option <b>scancel</b> also signals the batch script and its children processes.  Most shells  cannot
              handle  signals  while  a  command  is running (i.e. is a child process of the batch step), so the
              shell needs to wait until the command ends  to  then  handle  the  signal.   Unlike  <b>-b</b>,  <b>--batch</b>,
              children of the batch step are also signaled with this option.  <b>NOTE</b>: srun steps are also children
              of the batch step, so steps are also signaled with this option.

       <b>--help</b> Print a help message describing all <b>scancel</b> options.

       <b>-H</b>, <b>--hurry</b>
              Do not stage out any burst buffer data.

       <b>-i</b>, <b>--interactive</b>
              Interactive mode. Confirm each job_id.step_id before performing the cancel operation.

       <b>-n</b>, <b>--jobname</b>=<u>job_name</u>, <b>--name</b>=<u>job_name</u>
              Restrict the scancel operation to jobs with this job name.

       <b>--me</b>   Restrict the scancel operation to jobs owned by the current user.

       <b>-w</b>, <b>--nodelist=</b><u>host1,host2,...</u>
              Cancel  any jobs using any of the given hosts. The list may be specified as a comma-separated list
              of hosts, a range of hosts (host[1-5,7,...] for example), or a filename. The  host  list  will  be
              assumed to be a filename only if it contains a "/" character.

       <b>-p</b>, <b>--partition</b>=<u>partition_name</u>
              Restrict the scancel operation to jobs in this partition.

       <b>-q</b>, <b>--qos</b>=<u>qos</u>
              Restrict the scancel operation to jobs with this quality of service.

       <b>-Q</b>, <b>--quiet</b>
              Do  not  report  an  error if the specified job is already completed.  This option is incompatible
              with the <b>--verbose</b> option.

       <b>-R</b>, <b>--reservation</b>=<u>reservation_name</u>
              Restrict the scancel operation to jobs with this reservation name.

       <b>--sibling</b>=<u>cluster_name</u>
              Remove an active sibling job from a federated job.

       <b>-s</b>, <b>--signal</b>=<u>signal_name</u>
              The name or number of the signal to send. If this option is not used the  specified  job  or  step
              will be terminated.

       <b>-t</b>, <b>--state</b>=<u>job_state_name</u>
              Restrict  the  scancel  operation to jobs in this state. <u>job_state_name</u> may have a value of either
              "PENDING", "RUNNING" or "SUSPENDED".

       <b>--usage</b>
              Print a brief help message listing the <b>scancel</b> options.

       <b>-u</b>, <b>--user</b>=<u>user_name</u>
              Restrict the scancel operation to jobs owned by the given user.

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b>
              Print additional logging. Multiple v's increase logging detail.  This option is incompatible  with
              the <b>--quiet</b> option.

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--version</b>
              Print the version number of the scancel command.

       <b>--wckey</b>=<u>wckey</u>
              Restrict the scancel operation to jobs using this workload characterization key.

</pre><h4><b>ARGUMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>job_id</u> The Slurm job ID to be signaled.

       <u>step_id</u>
              The  step  ID of the job step to be signaled.  If not specified, the operation is performed at the
              level of a job.

              If neither <b>--batch</b> nor <b>--signal</b> are used, the entire job will be terminated.

              When <b>--batch</b> is used, the batch shell processes will be signaled.   The  child  processes  of  the
              shell will not be signaled by Slurm, but the shell may forward the signal.

              When  <b>--batch</b> is not used but <b>--signal</b> is used, then all job steps will be signaled, but the batch
              script itself will not be signaled.

</pre><h4><b>PERFORMANCE</b></h4><pre>
       When executing <b>scancel</b> without the <b>--ctld</b> option; or with the <b>--ctld</b> option and <b>--interactive</b>, <b>--sibling</b>,
       or specific step ids; a remote procedure call is sent to <b>slurmctld</b> to get  all  the  jobs.  <b>scancel</b>  then
       sends a signal job remote procedure call for each job that matches the requested filters.

       When executing <b>scancel</b> with the <b>--ctld</b> option and without <b>--interactive</b>, <b>--sibling</b>, or specific step ids,
       a single remote procedure call is sent to <b>slurmctld</b> to signal all jobs matching the requested filters. It
       is therefore recommended to use the <b>--ctld</b> option in order to reduce the number of remote procedure calls
       sent to the <b>slurmctld</b>.

       If  enough  calls  from  <b>scancel</b>  or  other Slurm client commands that send remote procedure calls to the
       <b>slurmctld</b> daemon come in at once, it can result in a degradation of performance of the <b>slurmctld</b>  daemon,
       possibly resulting in a denial of service.

       Do  not  run  <b>scancel</b>  or  other Slurm client commands that send remote procedure calls to <b>slurmctld</b> from
       loops in shell scripts or other programs. Ensure that programs limit calls  to  <b>scancel</b>  to  the  minimum
       necessary for the information you are trying to gather.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       Some  <b>scancel</b> options may be set via environment variables. These environment variables, along with their
       corresponding options, are listed  below.   (Note:  Command  line  options  will  always  override  these
       settings.)

       <b>SCANCEL_ACCOUNT</b>     <b>-A</b>, <b>--account</b>=<u>account</u>

       <b>SCANCEL_BATCH</b>       <b>-b,</b> <b>--batch</b>

       <b>SCANCEL_CTLD</b>        <b>--ctld</b>

       <b>SCANCEL_CRON</b>        <b>-c,</b> <b>--cron</b>

       <b>SCANCEL_FULL</b>        <b>-f,</b> <b>--full</b>

       <b>SCANCEL_HURRY</b>       <b>-H</b>, <b>--hurry</b>

       <b>SCANCEL_INTERACTIVE</b> <b>-i</b>, <b>--interactive</b>

       <b>SCANCEL_NAME</b>        <b>-n</b>, <b>--name</b>=<u>job_name</u>

       <b>SCANCEL_PARTITION</b>   <b>-p</b>, <b>--partition</b>=<u>partition_name</u>

       <b>SCANCEL_QOS</b>         <b>-q</b>, <b>--qos</b>=<u>qos</u>

       <b>SCANCEL_STATE</b>       <b>-t</b>, <b>--state</b>=<u>job_state_name</u>

       <b>SCANCEL_USER</b>        <b>-u</b>, <b>--user</b>=<u>user_name</u>

       <b>SCANCEL_VERBOSE</b>     <b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b>

       <b>SCANCEL_WCKEY</b>       <b>--wckey</b>=<u>wckey</u>

       <b>SLURM_CONF</b>          The location of the Slurm configuration file.

       <b>SLURM_CLUSTERS</b>      <b>-M</b>, <b>--clusters</b>

       <b>SLURM_DEBUG_FLAGS</b>   Specify  debug flags for scancel to use. See DebugFlags in the <b><a href="../man5/slurm.conf.5.html">slurm.conf</a></b>(5) man page
                           for a full list of flags. The environment variable takes precedence over the  setting
                           in the slurm.conf.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       If  multiple  filters  are  supplied  (e.g.  <b>--partition</b>  and <b>--name</b>) only the jobs satisfying all of the
       filtering options will be signaled.

       Cancelling a job step will not result in the job being terminated.  The job must be cancelled to  release
       a resource allocation.

       To  cancel  a job, invoke <b>scancel</b> without --signal option. This will send first a SIGCONT to all steps to
       eventually wake them up followed by a SIGTERM, then wait the KillWait duration defined in the  slurm.conf
       file  and finally if they have not terminated send a SIGKILL. This gives time for the running job/step(s)
       to clean up.

       If a signal value of "KILL" is sent to an entire job, this will cancel  the  active  job  steps  but  not
       cancel the job itself.

</pre><h4><b>AUTHORIZATION</b></h4><pre>
       When  using  SlurmDBD, users who have an AdminLevel defined (Operator or Admin) and users who are account
       coordinators are given the authority to invoke scancel on other users jobs.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Send SIGTERM to steps 1 and 3 of job 1234:

              $ scancel --signal=TERM 1234.1 1234.3

       Cancel job 1234 along with all of its steps:

              $ scancel 1234

       Send SIGKILL to all steps of job 1235, but do not cancel the job itself:

              $ scancel --signal=KILL 1235

       Send SIGUSR1 to the batch shell processes of job 1236:

              $ scancel --signal=USR1 --batch 1236

       Cancel all pending jobs belonging to user "bob" in partition "debug":

              $ scancel --state=PENDING --user=bob --partition=debug

       Cancel only array ID 4 of job array 1237

              $ scancel 1237_4
