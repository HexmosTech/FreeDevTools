</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       condor_userlog - HTCondor Manual

       Display and summarize job statistics from job log files.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>condor_userlog</b>  [<b>-help</b>  ]  [<b>-total</b>  <b>|</b>  <b>-raw</b>  ]  [<b>-debug</b>  ]  [<b>-evict</b> ] [<b>-j</b> <u>cluster</u> <u>|</u> <u>cluster.proc</u>] [<b>-all</b> ]
       [<b>-hostname</b> ] <u>logfile</u> <u>...</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>condor_userlog</u> parses the information in job log  files  and  displays  summaries  for  each  workstation
       allocation  and  for  each  job.  See  the <u>condor_submit</u> manual page for instructions for specifying that
       HTCondor write a log file for your jobs.

       If <b>-total</b> is not specified, <u>condor_userlog</u> will first display a record for each  workstation  allocation,
       which includes the following information:

          <b>Job</b>    The cluster/process id of the HTCondor job.

          <b>Host</b>   The  host  where  the  job ran. By default, the host's IP address is displayed. If <b>-hostname</b> is
                 specified, the host name will be displayed instead.

          <b>Start</b> <b>Time</b>
                 The time (month/day hour:minute) when the job began running on the host.

          <b>Evict</b> <b>Time</b>
                 The time (month/day hour:minute) when the job was evicted from the host.

          <b>Wall</b> <b>Time</b>
                 The time (days+hours:minutes) for which this workstation was allocated to the job.

          <b>Good</b> <b>Time</b>
                 The allocated time (days+hours:min) which contributed to the completion of this  job.   If  the
                 job  exited  during the allocation, then this value will equal "Wall Time."  Otherwise, it will
                 0+00:00; self-checkpoint are presently ignored.

          <b>CPU</b> <b>Usage</b>
                 The CPU time (days+hours:min) which contributed to the completion of this job.

       <u>condor_userlog</u> will then display summary statistics per host:

          <b>Host/Job</b>
                 The IP address or host name for the host.

          <b>Wall</b> <b>Time</b>
                 The workstation time (days+hours:minutes) allocated by this host to the jobs specified  in  the
                 query. By default, all jobs in the log are included in the query.

          <b>Good</b> <b>Time</b>
                 The time (days+hours:minutes) allocated on this host which contributed to the completion of the
                 jobs specified in the query.

          <b>CPU</b> <b>Usage</b>
                 The  CPU  time (days+hours:minutes) obtained from this host which contributed to the completion
                 of the jobs specified in the query.

          <b>Avg</b> <b>Alloc</b>
                 The average length of an allocation on this host (days+hours:minutes).

          <b>Avg</b> <b>Lost</b>
                 The average amount of work lost (days+hours:minutes) when a job was evicted from this host.

          <b>Goodput</b>
                 This percentage is computed as Good Time divided by Wall Time.

          <b>Util.</b>  This percentage is computed as CPU Usage divided by Good Time.

       <u>condor_userlog</u> will then display summary statistics per job:

          <b>Host/Job</b>
                 The cluster/process id of the HTCondor job.

          <b>Wall</b> <b>Time</b>
                 The total workstation time (days+hours:minutes) allocated to this job.

          <b>Good</b> <b>Time</b>
                 The total time (days+hours:minutes) allocated to  this  job  which  contributed  to  the  job's
                 completion.

          <b>CPU</b> <b>Usage</b>
                 The total CPU time (days+hours:minutes) which contributed to this job's completion.

          <b>Avg</b> <b>Alloc</b>
                 The   average   length   of   a   workstation  allocation  obtained  by  this  job  in  minutes
                 (days+hours:minutes).

          <b>Avg</b> <b>Lost</b>
                 The average amount of work lost (days+hours:minutes) when this job was  evicted  from  a  host;
                 self-checkpoints are presently ignored.

          <b>Goodput</b>
                 This percentage is computed as Good Time divided by Wall Time.

          <b>Util.</b>  This percentage is computed as CPU Usage divided by Good Time.

       Finally, <u>condor_userlog</u> will display a summary for all hosts and jobs.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
          <b>-help</b>  Get a brief description of the supported options

          <b>-total</b> Only display job totals

          <b>-raw</b>   Display raw data only

          <b>-debug</b> Debug mode

          <b>-j</b>     Select a specific cluster or cluster.proc

          <b>-evict</b> Select only allocations which ended due to eviction

          <b>-all</b>   Select all clusters and all allocations

          <b>-hostname</b>
                 Display host name instead of IP address

</pre><h4><b>GENERAL</b> <b>REMARKS</b></h4><pre>
       Since  the  HTCondor  job log file format does not contain a year field in the timestamp, all entries are
       assumed to occur in the current year.  Allocations which begin in one year and end in the  next  will  be
       silently ignored.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>condor_userlog</u>  will exit with a status value of 0 (zero) upon success, and it will exit with the value 1
       (one) upon failure.
