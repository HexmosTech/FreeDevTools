</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>at</b>  and  <b>batch</b>  read commands from standard input or a specified file which are to be executed at a later
       time, using <b><a href="file:/bin/sh">/bin/sh</a></b>.

       <b>at</b>      executes commands at a specified time.

       <b>atq</b>     lists the user's pending jobs, unless the user is the superuser; in that case,  everybody's  jobs
               are listed.  The format of the output lines (one for each job) is: Job number, date, hour, queue,
               and username.

       <b>atrm</b>    deletes jobs, identified by their job number.

       <b>batch</b>   executes  commands  when  system  load levels permit; in other words, when the load average drops
               below 1.5, or the value specified in the invocation of <b>atd</b>.

       <b>At</b> allows fairly complex time specifications, extending the POSIX.2 standard.  It accepts  times  of  the
       form  <b>HH:MM</b>  to  run  a  job  at  a specific time of day.  (If that time is already past, the next day is
       assumed.)  You may also specify <b>midnight,</b> <b>noon,</b> or <b>teatime</b> (4pm) and you can have a time-of-day  suffixed
       with  <b>AM</b> or <b>PM</b> for running in the morning or the evening.  You can also say what day the job will be run,
       by giving a date in the form <b>month-name</b> <b>day</b> with  an  optional  <b>year,</b>  or  giving  a  date  of  the  form
       <u>MMDD</u>[<u>CC</u>]<u>YY</u>,  <u>MM</u>/<u>DD</u>/[<u>CC</u>]<u>YY</u>,  <u>DD</u>.<u>MM</u>.[<u>CC</u>]<u>YY</u>  or  [<u>CC</u>]<u>YY</u>-<u>MM</u>-<u>DD</u>.   The specification of a date <u>must</u> follow the
       specification of the time of day.  You can also give times like <b>now</b> <b>+</b> <u>count</u> <u>time-units,</u> where  the  time-
       units  can  be  <b>minutes,</b>  <b>hours,</b> <b>days,</b> or <b>weeks</b> and you can tell <b>at</b> to run the job today by suffixing the
       time with <b>today</b> and to run the job tomorrow by suffixing the time with <b>tomorrow.</b>

       For example, to run a job at 4pm three days from now, you would do <b>at</b> <b>4pm</b> <b>+</b> <b>3</b>  <b>days,</b>  to  run  a  job  at
       10:00am  on  July  31,  you would do <b>at</b> <b>10am</b> <b>Jul</b> <b>31</b> and to run a job at 1am tomorrow, you would do <b>at</b> <b>1am</b>
       <b>tomorrow.</b>

       If you specify a job to absolutely run at a specific time and date in the past, the job will run as  soon
       as possible.  For example, if it is 8pm and you do a <b>at</b> <b>6pm</b> <b>today,</b> it will run more likely at 8:05pm.

       The definition of the time specification can be found in <u>/usr/share/doc/at/timespec</u>.

       For both <b>at</b> and <b>batch</b>, commands are read from standard input or the file specified with the <b>-f</b> option and
       executed.  The working directory, the environment (except for the variables <b>BASH_VERSINFO</b>, <b>DISPLAY</b>, <b>EUID</b>,
       <b>GROUPS</b>, <b>SHELLOPTS</b>, <b>TERM</b>, <b>UID</b>, and <b>_</b>) and the umask are retained from the time of invocation.

       As <b>at</b> is currently implemented as a setuid program, other environment variables (e.g., <b>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</b> or
       <b>LD_PRELOAD</b>)  are also not exported.  This may change in the future.  As a workaround, set these variables
       explicitly in your job.

       An <b>at</b> - or <b>batch</b> - command invoked from a <b><a href="../man1/su.1.html">su</a></b>(1) shell will retain the current userid.  The user  will  be
       mailed standard error and standard output from his commands, if any.  Mail will be sent using the command
       <b>/usr/sbin/sendmail</b>.   If <b>at</b> is executed from a <b><a href="../man1/su.1.html">su</a></b>(1) shell, the owner of the login shell will receive the
       mail.

       The superuser may use these commands in any case.  For other users, permission to use at is determined by
       the files <u>/etc/at.allow</u> and <u>/etc/at.deny</u>.  See <b><a href="../man5/at.allow.5.html">at.allow</a></b>(5) for details.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-V</b>      prints the version number to standard error and exit successfully.

       <b>-q</b> <u>queue</u>
               uses the specified queue.   A  queue  designation  consists  of  a  single  letter;  valid  queue
               designations range from <b>a</b> to <b>z</b> and <b>A</b> to <b>Z</b>.  The <b>a</b> queue is the default for <b>at</b> and the <b>b</b> queue for
               <b>batch</b>.   Queues  with  higher  letters  run  with  increased  niceness.  The special queue "=" is
               reserved for jobs which are currently running.

       If a job is submitted to a queue designated with an uppercase letter, the job is treated as  if  it  were
       submitted  to  batch  at  the time of the job.  Once the time is reached, the batch processing rules with
       respect to load average apply.  If <b>atq</b> is given a specific queue, it will only show jobs pending in  that
       queue.

       <b>-m</b>      Send mail to the user when the job has completed even if there was no output.

       <b>-M</b>      Never send mail to the user.

       <b>-u</b> <u>username</u>
               Sends mail to <u>username</u> rather than the current user.

       <b>-f</b> <u>file</u> Reads the job from <u>file</u> rather than standard input.

       <b>-t</b> <u>time</u> run the job at <u>time</u>, given in the format [[CC]YY]MMDDhhmm[.ss]

       <b>-l</b>      Is an alias for <b>atq.</b>

       <b>-r</b>      Is an alias for <b>atrm.</b>

       <b>-d</b>      Is an alias for <b>atrm.</b>

       <b>-b</b>      is an alias for <b>batch</b>.

       <b>-v</b>      Shows the time the job will be executed before reading the job.

       Times displayed will be in the format "Thu Feb 20 14:50:00 1997".

       <b>-c</b>     cats the jobs listed on the command line to standard output.

       <b>-o</b> <u>fmt</u>  strftime-like time format used for the job list

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       The  correct  operation  of  <b>batch</b> for Linux depends on the presence of a <u>proc</u>- type directory mounted on
       <u><a href="file:/proc">/proc</a></u>.

       If the file <u><a href="file:/var/run/utmp">/var/run/utmp</a></u> is not available or corrupted, or if the user is not logged on at the  time  <b>at</b>
       is  invoked,  the  mail  is  sent  to  the  userid found in the environment variable <b>LOGNAME</b>.  If that is
       undefined or empty, the current userid is assumed.

       <b>At</b> and <b>batch</b> as presently implemented are not suitable when users are competing for resources.   If  this
       is the case for your site, you might want to consider another batch system, such as <b>nqs</b>.
