       condor_q - HTCondor Manual

       Display information about jobs in queue

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>condor_q</b> [<b>-help</b> <b>[Universe</b> <b>|</b> <b>State]</b> ]

       <b>condor_q</b> [<b>-debug</b> ] [<u>general</u> <u>options</u> ] [<u>restriction</u> <u>list</u> ] [<u>output</u> <u>options</u> ] [<u>analyze</u> <u>options</u> ]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>condor_q</u>  displays  information  about  jobs in the HTCondor job queue.  By default, <u>condor_q</u> queries the
       local job queue, but this behavior may be modified by specifying one of the general options.

       <b>As</b> <b>of</b> <b>version</b> <b>8.5.2,</b> <b>condor_q</b> <b>defaults</b> <b>to</b>  <b>querying</b>  <b>only</b>  <b>the</b>  <b>current</b>  <b>user's</b>  <b>jobs.</b>  <b>This</b>  <b>default</b>  <b>is</b>
       <b>overridden</b>  <b>when</b>  <b>the</b>  <b>restriction</b>  <b>list</b>  <b>has</b>  <b>usernames</b> <b>and/or</b> <b>job</b> <b>ids,</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>-submitter</b> <b>or</b> <b>-allusers</b>
       <b>arguments</b> <b>are</b> <b>specified,</b> <b>or</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>user</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>queue</b> <b>superuser.</b> <b>It</b>  <b>can</b>  <b>also</b>  <b>be</b>  <b>overridden</b>  <b>by</b>
       <b>setting</b> <b>the</b> <b>CONDOR_Q_ONLY_MY_JOBS</b> <b>configuration</b> <b>macro</b> <b>to</b> <b>False.</b>

       <b>As</b>  <b>of</b>  <b>version</b>  <b>8.5.6,</b> <b>condor_q</b> <b>defaults</b> <b>to</b> <b>batch-mode</b> <b>output</b> <b>(see</b> <b>-batch</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Options</b> <b>section</b> <b>below).</b>
       <b>The</b> <b>old</b> <b>behavior</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>obtained</b> <b>by</b> <b>specifying</b> <b>-nobatch</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>command</b> <b>line.</b> <b>To</b> <b>change</b> <b>the</b>  <b>default</b>  <b>back</b>
       <b>to</b> <b>its</b> <b>pre-8.5.6</b> <b>value,</b> <b>set</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>configuration</b> <b>variable</b> <b>CONDOR_Q_DASH_BATCH_IS_DEFAULT</b> <b>to</b> <b>False.</b>

</pre><h4><b>BATCHES</b> <b>OF</b> <b>JOBS</b></h4><pre>
       As  of  version  8.5.6,  <u>condor_q</u>  defaults  to displaying information about batches of jobs, rather than
       individual jobs. The intention is that this will be a more useful, and user-friendly,  format  for  users
       with  large  numbers  of  jobs in the queue. Ideally, users will specify meaningful batch names for their
       jobs, to make it easier to keep track of related jobs.

       (For information about specifying batch names for your jobs, see the <u>condor_submit</u> and  <u>condor_submit_dag</u>
       manual pages.)

       A batch of jobs is defined as follows:

       • An entire workflow (a DAG or hierarchy of nested DAGs) (note that <u>condor_dagman</u> now specifies a default
         batch name for all jobs in a given workflow)

       • All jobs in a single cluster

       • All  jobs  submitted  by  a  single  user  that have the same executable specified in their submit file
         (unless submitted with different batch names)

       • All jobs submitted by a single user that have the same batch name specified in their submit file or  on
         the <u>condor_submit</u> or <u>condor_submit_dag</u> command line.

</pre><h4><b>OUTPUT</b></h4><pre>
       There are many output options that modify the output generated by <u>condor_q</u>. The effects of these options,
       and the meanings of the various output data, are described below.

   <b>Output</b> <b>options</b>
       If  the  <b>-long</b>  option is specified, <u>condor_q</u> displays a long description of the queried jobs by printing
       the entire job ClassAd for all jobs matching the restrictions, if any. Individual attributes of  the  job
       ClassAd  can  be  displayed  by  means  of the <b>-format</b> option, which displays attributes with a <a href="../man3/printf.3.html">printf</a>(3)
       format, or with the <b>-autoformat</b> option. Multiple <b>-format</b> options may be specified in the option  list  to
       display several attributes of the job.

       For most output options (except as specified), the last line of <u>condor_q</u> output contains a summary of the
       queue:  the  total  number of jobs, and the number of jobs in the completed, removed, idle, running, held
       and suspended states.

       If no output options are specified, <u>condor_q</u> now defaults to  batch  mode,  and  displays  the  following
       columns of information, with one line of output per batch of jobs:

          OWNER, BATCH_NAME, SUBMITTED, DONE, RUN, IDLE, [HOLD,] TOTAL, JOB_IDS

       Note  that  the HOLD column is only shown if there are held jobs in the output or if there are no jobs in
       the output.

       If the <b>-nobatch</b> option is specified, <u>condor_q</u> displays the following columns  of  information,  with  one
       line of output per job:

          ID, OWNER, SUBMITTED, RUN_TIME, ST, PRI, SIZE, CMD

       If  the  <b>-dag</b> option is specified (in conjunction with <b>-nobatch</b>), <u>condor_q</u> displays the following columns
       of information, with one line of output per job; the owner is shown only for top-level jobs, and for  all
       other jobs (including sub-DAGs) the node name is shown:

          ID, OWNER/NODENAME, SUBMITTED, RUN_TIME, ST, PRI, SIZE, CMD

       If  the  <b>-run</b> option is specified (in conjunction with <b>-nobatch</b>), <u>condor_q</u> displays the following columns
       of information, with one line of output per running job:

          ID, OWNER, SUBMITTED, RUN_TIME, HOST(S)

       Also note that the <b>-run</b> option disables output of the totals line.

       If the <b>-grid</b> option is specified, <u>condor_q</u> displays the following columns of information, with  one  line
       of output per job:

          ID, OWNER, STATUS, GRID-&gt;MANAGER, HOST, GRID_JOB_ID

       If  the  <b>-grid:ec2</b>  option is specified, <u>condor_q</u> displays the following columns of information, with one
       line of output per job:

          ID, OWNER, STATUS, INSTANCE ID, CMD

       If the <b>-goodput</b> option is specified, <u>condor_q</u> displays the following columns  of  information,  with  one
       line of output per job:

          ID, OWNER, SUBMITTED, RUN_TIME, GOODPUT, CPU_UTIL, Mb/s

       If  the <b>-io</b> option is specified, <u>condor_q</u> displays the following columns of information, with one line of
       output per job:

          ID, OWNER, RUNS, ST, INPUT, OUTPUT, RATE, MISC

       If the <b>-cputime</b> option is specified (in conjunction  with  <b>-nobatch</b>),  <u>condor_q</u>  displays  the  following
       columns of information, with one line of output per job:

          ID, OWNER, SUBMITTED, CPU_TIME, ST, PRI, SIZE, CMD

       If  the  <b>-hold</b> option is specified, <u>condor_q</u> displays the following columns of information, with one line
       of output per job:

          ID, OWNER, HELD_SINCE, HOLD_REASON

       If the <b>-totals</b> option is specified, <u>condor_q</u> displays only one line of output no matter how many jobs and
       batches of jobs are in the queue. That line of output contains the total number of jobs, and  the  number
       of jobs in the completed, removed, idle, running, held and suspended states.

   <b>Output</b> <b>data</b>
       The available output data are as follows:

          <b>ID</b>     (Non-batch mode only) The cluster/process id of the HTCondor job.

          <b>OWNER</b>  The owner of the job or batch of jobs.

          <b>OWNER/NODENAME</b>
                 (<b>-dag</b> only) The owner of a job or the DAG node name of the job.

          <b>BATCH_NAME</b>
                 (Batch mode only) The batch name of the job or batch of jobs.

          <b>SUBMITTED</b>
                 The month, day, hour, and minute the job was submitted to the queue.

          <b>DONE</b>   (Batch mode only) The number of job procs that are done, but still in the queue.

          <b>RUN</b>    (Batch mode only) The number of job procs that are running.

          <b>IDLE</b>   (Batch mode only) The number of job procs that are in the queue but idle.

          <b>HOLD</b>   (Batch mode only) The number of job procs that are in the queue but held.

          <b>TOTAL</b>  (Batch  mode  only)  The  total number of job procs in the queue, unless the batch is a DAG, in
                 which case this is the total number of clusters in the queue. Note: for  non-DAG  batches,  the
                 TOTAL column contains correct values only in version 8.5.7 and later.

          <b>JOB_IDS</b>
                 (Batch mode only) The range of job IDs belonging to the batch.

          <b>RUN_TIME</b>
                 (Non-batch  mode only) Wall-clock time accumulated by the job currently running in days, hours,
                 minutes, and seconds. When the job is idle or held the jobs previous accumulated time  will  be
                 displayed.

          <b>ST</b>     (Non-batch  mode  only)  Current  status of the job, which varies somewhat according to the job
                 universe and the timing of updates. H = on hold, R = running, I = idle (waiting for  a  machine
                 to  execute  on),  C  =  completed,  X  =  removed,  S  = suspended (execution of a running job
                 temporarily suspended on execute node), &lt; = transferring input (or queued to do so),  and  &gt;  =
                 transferring output (or queued to do so).

          <b>PRI</b>    (Non-batch  mode only) User specified priority of the job, displayed as an integer, with higher
                 numbers corresponding to better priority.

          <b>SIZE</b>   (Non-batch mode only) The peak amount of memory in Mbytes consumed by the job; note this  value
                 is  only  refreshed  periodically.  The  actual  value  reported  is taken from the job ClassAd
                 attribute <u>MemoryUsage</u> if this attribute is defined, and from job attribute <u>ImageSize</u> otherwise.

          <b>CMD</b>    (Non-batch mode only) The name of the executable. For EC2 jobs, this field is arbitrary.

          <b>HOST(S)</b>
                 (<b>-run</b> only) The host where the job is running.

          <b>STATUS</b> (<b>-grid</b> only) The state that HTCondor believes the job is in.   Possible  values  are  grid-type
                 specific, but include:

                     <b>PENDING</b>
                            The job is waiting for resources to become available in order to run.

                     <b>ACTIVE</b> The job has received resources, and the application is executing.

                     <b>FAILED</b> The  job terminated before completion because of an error, user-triggered cancel, or
                            system-triggered cancel.

                     <b>DONE</b>   The job completed successfully.

                     <b>SUSPENDED</b>
                            The job has been suspended. Resources which were allocated for  this  job  may  have
                            been released due to a scheduler-specific reason.

                     <b>STAGE_IN</b>
                            The job manager is staging in files, in order to run the job.

                     <b>STAGE_OUT</b>
                            The job manager is staging out files generated by the job.

                     <b>UNKNOWN</b>
                            Unknown

          <b>GRID-&gt;MANAGER</b>
                 (<b>-grid</b>  only)  A  guess  at what remote batch system is running the job. It is a guess, because
                 HTCondor looks at the jobmanager contact string to attempt  identification.  If  the  value  is
                 fork,  the  job  is running on the remote host without a jobmanager. Values may also be condor,
                 lsf, or pbs.

          <b>HOST</b>   (<b>-grid</b> only) The host to which the job was submitted.

          <b>GRID_JOB_ID</b>
                 (<b>-grid</b> only) (More information needed here.)

          <b>INSTANCE</b> <b>ID</b>
                 (<b>-grid:ec2</b> only) Usually EC2 instance ID; may be blank or the client token,  depending  on  job
                 progress.

          <b>GOODPUT</b>
                 (<b>-goodput</b> only) The percentage of RUN_TIME for this job which has been saved in a checkpoint. A
                 low  GOODPUT  value  indicates  that  the  job  is  failing to checkpoint. If a job has not yet
                 attempted a checkpoint, this column contains <b>[?????]</b>.

          <b>CPU_UTIL</b>
                 (<b>-goodput</b> only) The ratio of CPU_TIME  to  RUN_TIME  for  checkpointed  work.  A  low  CPU_UTIL
                 indicates  that  the job is not running efficiently, perhaps because it is I/O bound or because
                 the job requires more memory than available on the remote workstations.  If  the  job  has  not
                 (yet) checkpointed, this column contains <b>[??????]</b>.

          <b>Mb/s</b>   (<b>-goodput</b>  only)  The  network usage of this job, in Megabits per second of run-time.  READ The
                 total number of bytes the application has read from files and sockets.  WRITE The total  number
                 of  bytes  the  application  has  written  to files and sockets.  SEEK The total number of seek
                 operations the application has performed on files.   XPUT  The  effective  throughput  (average
                 bytes  read  and written per second) from the application's point of view.  BUFSIZE The maximum
                 number of bytes to be buffered per file.  BLOCKSIZE The  desired  block  size  for  large  data
                 transfers. These fields are updated when a job produces a checkpoint or completes. If a job has
                 not yet produced a checkpoint, this information is not available.

          <b>INPUT</b>  (<b>-io</b> only) BytesRecvd.

          <b>OUTPUT</b> (<b>-io</b> only) BytesSent.

          <b>RATE</b>   (<b>-io</b> only) BytesRecvd+BytesSent.

          <b>MISC</b>   (<b>-io</b> only) JobUniverse.

          <b>CPU_TIME</b>
                 (<b>-cputime</b>  only) The remote CPU time accumulated by the job to date (which has been stored in a
                 checkpoint) in days, hours, minutes, and seconds.  (If  the  job  is  currently  running,  time
                 accumulated during the current run is not shown. If the job has not produced a checkpoint, this
                 column contains 0+00:00:00.)

          <b>HELD_SINCE</b>
                 (<b>-hold</b> only) Month, day, hour and minute at which the job was held.

          <b>HOLD_REASON</b>
                 (<b>-hold</b> only) The hold reason for the job.

   <b>Analyze</b>
       The  <b>-analyze</b>  or  <b>-better-analyze</b>  options  can be used to determine why certain jobs are not running by
       performing an analysis on a per machine basis for each machine in the pool. The reasons  can  vary  among
       failed constraints, insufficient priority, resource owner preferences and prevention of preemption by the
       <u>PREEMPTION_REQUIREMENTS</u>  expression.  If the analyze option <b>-verbose</b> is specified along with the <b>-analyze</b>
       option, the reason for failure is displayed on a per machine basis. <b>-better-analyze</b> differs from <b>-analyze</b>
       in that it will do matchmaking analysis on jobs even if they are currently running, or if the reason they
       are not running is not due to matchmaking.  <b>-better-analyze</b>  also  produces  more  thorough  analysis  of
       complex  Requirements and shows the values of relevant job ClassAd attributes. When only a single machine
       is being analyzed via <b>-machine</b> or <b>-mconstraint</b>, the values of relevant attributes of the machine  ClassAd
       are also displayed.

</pre><h4><b>RESTRICTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       To  restrict the display to jobs of interest, a list of zero or more restriction options may be supplied.
       Each restriction may be one of:

       • <b>cluster.process</b>, which matches jobs which belong to  the  specified  cluster  and  have  the  specified
         process number;

       • <b>cluster</b> (without a <u>process</u>), which matches all jobs belonging to the specified cluster;

       • <b>owner</b>, which matches all jobs owned by the specified owner;

       • <b>-constraint</b> <b>expression</b>, which matches all jobs that satisfy the specified ClassAd expression;

       • <b>-unmatchable</b>  <b>expression</b>, which matches all jobs that do not match any slot that would be considered by
         <b>-better-analyze</b> <u>;</u>

       • <b>-allusers</b>, which overrides the default restriction of only matching jobs submitted by the current user.

       If <u>cluster</u> or <u>cluster</u>.<u>process</u> is specified, and the job matching that restriction is a <u>condor_dagman</u> job,
       information for all jobs  of  that  DAG  is  displayed  in  batch  mode  (in  non-batch  mode,  only  the
       <u>condor_dagman</u> job itself is displayed).

       If  no  <u>owner</u>  restrictions  are present, the job matches the restriction list if it matches at least one
       restriction in the list. If <u>owner</u> restrictions are present, the job matches the list if it matches one of
       the <u>owner</u> restrictions and at least one non-<u>owner</u> restriction.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
          <b>-debug</b> Causes debugging information to be sent to <b>stderr</b>, based on  the  value  of  the  configuration
                 variable <u>TOOL_DEBUG</u>.

          <b>-batch</b> (output  option)  Show a single line of progress information for a batch of jobs, where a batch
                 is defined as follows:

                 • An entire workflow (a DAG or hierarchy of nested DAGs)

                 • All jobs in a single cluster

                 • All jobs submitted by a single user that have the same executable specified in  their  submit
                   file

                 • All  jobs  submitted by a single user that have the same batch name specified in their submit
                   file or on the <u>condor_submit</u> or <u>condor_submit_dag</u> command line.

                 Also change the output columns as noted above.

                 Note   that,   as   of    version    8.5.6,    <b>-batch</b>    is    the    default,    unless    the
                 <u>CONDOR_Q_DASH_BATCH_IS_DEFAULT</u> configuration variable is set to <b>False</b>.

          <b>-nobatch</b>
                 (output option) Show a line for each job (turn off the <b>-batch</b> option).

          <b>-global</b>
                 (general option) Queries all job queues in the pool.

          <b>-submitter</b> <u>submitter</u>
                 (general  option)  List  jobs of a specific submitter in the entire pool, not just for a single
                 <u>condor_schedd</u>.

          <b>-name</b> <u>name</u>
                 (general option) Query only the job queue of the named <u>condor_schedd</u> daemon.

          <b>-pool</b> <u>centralmanagerhostname[:portnumber]</u>
                 (general option) Use the <u>centralmanagerhostname</u> as the central manager to locate  <u>condor_schedd</u>
                 daemons. The default is the <u>COLLECTOR_HOST</u>, as specified in the configuration.

          <b>-jobads</b> <u>file</u>
                 (general option) Display jobs from a list of ClassAds from a file, instead of the real ClassAds
                 from  the <u>condor_schedd</u> daemon. This is most useful for debugging purposes. The ClassAds appear
                 as if <u>condor_q</u> <b>-long</b> is used with the header stripped out.

          <b>-userlog</b> <u>file</u>
                 (general option) Display jobs, with job information coming from a job  event  log,  instead  of
                 from the real ClassAds from the <u>condor_schedd</u> daemon. This is most useful for automated testing
                 of  the  status  of jobs known to be in the given job event log, because it reduces the load on
                 the <u>condor_schedd</u>. A job event log does not contain all of the job information, so some  fields
                 in the normal output of <u>condor_q</u> will be blank.

          <b>-factory</b>
                 (output   option)   Display  information  about  late  materialization  job  factories  in  the
                 <u>condor_shedd</u>.

          <b>-autocluster</b>
                 (output option) Output <u>condor_schedd</u> daemon auto cluster information. For  each  auto  cluster,
                 output  the  unique  ID of the auto cluster along with the number of jobs in that auto cluster.
                 This option is intended to be used together with  the  <b>-long</b>  option  to  output  the  ClassAds
                 representing  auto  clusters.  The ClassAds can then be used to identify or classify the demand
                 for sets of machine resources, which will be useful in the on-demand creation of execute  nodes
                 for glidein services.

          <b>-cputime</b>
                 (output  option)  Instead  of  wall-clock  allocation  time (RUN_TIME), display remote CPU time
                 accumulated by the job to date in days, hours, minutes, and seconds. If the  job  is  currently
                 running,  time  accumulated  during  the current run is not shown. Note that this option has no
                 effect unless used in conjunction with <b>-nobatch</b>.

          <b>-currentrun</b>
                 (output option) If this option is specified, RUN_TIME displays the time accumulated so  far  on
                 this  current  run  unless  the  job  is  in  IDLE or HELD state then RUN_TIME will display the
                 previous runs time. Note that this is the base behavior and is not required,  and  this  option
                 cannot be used in conjunction with <b>-cumulative-time</b>.

          <b>-cumulative-time</b>
                 (output option) Normally, RUN_TIME contains the current or previous runs accumulated wall-clock
                 time.  If  this option is specified, RUN_TIME displays the accumulated time for the current run
                 plus all previous runs. Note that this option cannot be used in conjunction with <b>-currentrun</b>.

          <b>-dag</b>   (output option) Display DAG node jobs under their DAGMan  instance.   Child  nodes  are  listed
                 using  indentation to show the structure of the DAG. Note that this option has no effect unless
                 used in conjunction with <b>-nobatch</b>.

          <b>-expert</b>
                 (output option) Display shorter error messages.

          <b>-grid</b>  (output option) Get information only about jobs submitted to grid resources.

          <b>-grid:ec2</b>
                 (output option) Get information only about jobs submitted to grid resources and display it in a
                 format better-suited for EC2 than the default.

          <b>-goodput</b>
                 (output option) Display job goodput statistics.

          <b>-help</b> <b>[Universe</b> <b>|</b> <b>State]</b>
                 (output option) Print usage info, and, optionally, additionally  print  job  universes  or  job
                 states.

          <b>-hold</b>  (output  option)  Get  information about jobs in the hold state. Also displays the time the job
                 was placed into the hold state and the reason why the job was placed in the hold state.

          <b>-limit</b> <u>Number</u>
                 (output option) Limit the number of items output to <u>Number</u>.

          <b>-io</b>    (output option) Display job input/output summaries.

          <b>-long</b>  (output option) Display entire job ClassAds in long format (one attribute per line).

          <b>-idle</b>  (output option) Get information about idle jobs. Note that this option implies <b>-nobatch</b>.

          <b>-run</b>   (output option) Get information about running jobs. Note that this option implies <b>-nobatch</b>.

          <b>-stream-results</b>
                 (output option) Display results as jobs are fetched from the  job  queue  rather  than  storing
                 results  in  memory  until  all jobs have been fetched. This can reduce memory consumption when
                 fetching large numbers of jobs, but if <u>condor_q</u> is paused while displaying results, this  could
                 result in a timeout in communication with <u>condor_schedd</u>.

          <b>-totals</b>
                 (output option) Display only the totals.

          <b>-version</b>
                 (output option) Print the HTCondor version and exit.

          <b>-wide</b>  (output  option) If this option is specified, and the command portion of the output would cause
                 the output to extend beyond 80 columns, display beyond the 80 columns.

          <b>-xml</b>   (output option) Display entire job <u>ClassAds</u> in XML format.

          <b>-json</b>  (output option) Display entire job <u>ClassAds</u> in JSON format.

          <b>-attributes</b> <u>Attr1[,Attr2</u> <u>...]</u>
                 (output option) Explicitly list the attributes, by name in a comma separated list, which should
                 be displayed when using the <b>-xml</b>, <b>-json</b> or <b>-long</b> options. Limiting  the  number  of  attributes
                 increases the efficiency of the query.

          <b>-format</b> <u>fmt</u> <u>attr</u>
                 (output option) Display attribute or expression <u>attr</u> in format <u>fmt</u>. To display the attribute or
                 expression  the  format must contain a single <b><a href="../man3/printf.3.html">printf</a>(3)</b>-style conversion specifier.  Attributes
                 must be from the job ClassAd. Expressions are ClassAd expressions and may refer  to  attributes
                 in  the job ClassAd. If the attribute is not present in a given ClassAd and cannot be parsed as
                 an expression, then the format option will be silently skipped. %r prints the  unevaluated,  or
                 raw  values. The conversion specifier must match the type of the attribute or expression. %s is
                 suitable for strings such as <u>Owner</u>, %d for integers such as  <u>ClusterId</u>,  and  %f  for  floating
                 point  numbers  such as <u>RemoteWallClockTime</u>.  %v identifies the type of the attribute, and then
                 prints the value in an appropriate format. %V identifies the type of the  attribute,  and  then
                 prints  the  value  in  an  appropriate  format  as  it would appear in the <b>-long</b> format. As an
                 example, strings used with %V will have  quote  marks.  An  incorrect  format  will  result  in
                 undefined  behavior. Do not use more than one conversion specifier in a given format. More than
                 one conversion specifier will result in  undefined  behavior.  To  output  multiple  attributes
                 repeat  the  <b>-format</b>  option once for each desired attribute. Like <b><a href="../man3/printf.3.html">printf</a>(3)</b> style formats, one
                 may include other text that will be  reproduced  directly.  A  format  without  any  conversion
                 specifiers  may  be specified, but an attribute is still required. Include a backslash followed
                 by an 'n' to specify a line break.

          <b>-autoformat[:jlhVr,tng]</b> <u>attr1</u> <u>[attr2</u> <u>...]</u> or <b>-af[:jlhVr,tng]</b> <u>attr1</u> <u>[attr2</u> <u>...]</u>
                 (output option) Display attribute(s) or expression(s) formatted in a default way  according  to
                 attribute  types.  This  option  takes an arbitrary number of attribute names as arguments, and
                 prints out their values, with a space between each value and a newline character after the last
                 value. It is like the <b>-format</b> option without format strings. This output option does  not  work
                 in conjunction with any of the options <b>-run</b>, <b>-currentrun</b>, <b>-hold</b>, <b>-grid</b>, <b>-goodput</b>, or <b>-io</b>.

                 It  is  assumed that no attribute names begin with a dash character, so that the next word that
                 begins with dash is the start of the next option. The <b>autoformat</b> option may be  followed  by  a
                 colon character and formatting qualifiers to deviate the output formatting from the default:

                 <b>j</b> print the job ID as the first field,

                 <b>l</b> label each field,

                 <b>h</b> print column headings before the first line of output,

                 <b>V</b> use %V rather than %v for formatting (string values are quoted),

                 <b>r</b> print "raw", or unevaluated values,

                 <b>,</b> add a comma character after each field,

                 <b>t</b> add a tab character before each field instead of the default space character,

                 <b>n</b> add a newline character after each field,

                 <b>g</b> add a newline character between ClassAds, and suppress spaces before each field.

                 Use <b>-af:h</b> to get tabular values with headings.

                 Use <b>-af:lrng</b> to get -long equivalent format.

                 The  newline  and  comma characters may not be used together. The <b>l</b> and <b>h</b> characters may not be
                 used together.

          <b>-print-format</b> <u>file</u>
                 Read output formatting information from the given custom print format file.  see <u>Print</u>  <u>Formats</u>
                 for more information about custom print format files.

          <b>-analyze[:&lt;qual&gt;]</b>
                 (analyze  option)  Perform  a  matchmaking  analysis on why the requested jobs are not running.
                 First a simple analysis determines if the job is not running due to not  being  in  a  runnable
                 state.  If  the  job is in a runnable state, then this option is equivalent to <b>-better-analyze</b>.
                 <b>&lt;qual&gt;</b> is a comma separated list containing one or more of

                 <b>priority</b> to consider user priority during the analysis

                 <b>summary</b> to show a one line summary for each job or machine
                 <b>reverse</b> to analyze machines, rather than jobs

          <b>-better-analyze[:&lt;qual&gt;]</b>
                 (analyze option) Perform a more detailed matchmaking analysis to determine how  many  resources
                 are available to run the requested jobs. This option is never meaningful for Scheduler universe
                 jobs  and only meaningful for grid universe jobs doing matchmaking. When this option is used in
                 conjunction with the <b>-unmatchable</b> option, The output will be a list of job ids that don't match
                 any of the available slots. <b>&lt;qual&gt;</b> is a comma separated list containing one or more of

                 <b>priority</b> to consider user priority during the analysis

                 <b>summary</b> to show a one line summary for each job or machine
                 <b>reverse</b> to analyze machines, rather than jobs

          <b>-machine</b> <u>name</u>
                 (analyze option) When doing matchmaking analysis, analyze only machine ClassAds that have  slot
                 or machine names that match the given name.

          <b>-mconstraint</b> <u>expression</u>
                 (analyze  option)  When doing matchmaking analysis, match only machine ClassAds which match the
                 ClassAd expression constraint.

          <b>-slotads</b> <u>file</u>
                 (analyze option) When doing matchmaking analysis,  use  the  machine  ClassAds  from  the  file
                 instead  of  the  ones  from  the  <u>condor_collector</u>  daemon.  This is most useful for debugging
                 purposes. The ClassAds appear as if <u>condor_status</u> <b>-long</b> is used.

          <b>-userprios</b> <u>file</u>
                 (analyze option) When doing matchmaking analysis with priority, read user priorities  from  the
                 file  rather than the ones from the <u>condor_negotiator</u> daemon. This is most useful for debugging
                 purposes or to speed up analysis in situations where the <u>condor_negotiator</u> daemon  is  slow  to
                 respond   to   <u>condor_userprio</u>  requests.  The  file  should  be  in  the  format  produced  by
                 <u>condor_userprio</u> <b>-long</b>.

          <b>-nouserprios</b>
                 (analyze option) Do not consider user priority during the analysis.

          <b>-reverse-analyze</b>
                 (analyze option) Analyze machine requirements against jobs.

          <b>-verbose</b>
                 (analyze option) When doing analysis, show progress and include the names of specific  machines
                 in the output.

</pre><h4><b>GENERAL</b> <b>REMARKS</b></h4><pre>
       The  default output from <u>condor_q</u> is formatted to be human readable, not script readable. In an effort to
       make the output fit within 80 characters, values in some fields  might  be  truncated.  Furthermore,  the
       HTCondor  Project  can  (and does) change the formatting of this default output as we see fit. Therefore,
       any script that is attempting to parse data from <u>condor_q</u> is  strongly  encouraged  to  use  the  <b>-format</b>
       option (described above, examples given below).

       Although  <b>-analyze</b>  provides  a  very good first approximation, the analyzer cannot diagnose all possible
       situations, because the analysis is based on instantaneous and local information.  Therefore,  there  are
       some  situations  such as when several submitters are contending for resources, or if the pool is rapidly
       changing state which cannot be accurately diagnosed.

       It is possible to hold jobs that are in the X state. To avoid this it is best to construct a  <b>-constraint</b>
       <u>expression</u> that option contains <b>JobStatus</b> <b>!=</b> <b>3</b> if the user wishes to avoid this condition.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>-format</b> option provides a way to specify both the job attributes and formatting of those attributes.
       There must be only one conversion specification per <b>-format</b> option. As an  example,  to  list  only  Jane
       Doe's  jobs  in  the  queue,  choosing  to  print  and format only the owner of the job, the command line
       arguments for the job, and the process ID of the job:

          $ condor_q -submitter jdoe -format "%s" Owner -format " %s " Args -format " ProcId = %d\n" ProcId
          jdoe 16386 2800 ProcId = 0
          jdoe 16386 3000 ProcId = 1
          jdoe 16386 3200 ProcId = 2
          jdoe 16386 3400 ProcId = 3
          jdoe 16386 3600 ProcId = 4
          jdoe 16386 4200 ProcId = 7

       To display only the JobID's of Jane Doe's jobs you can use the following.

          $ condor_q -submitter jdoe -format "%d." ClusterId -format "%d\n" ProcId
          27.0
          27.1
          27.2
          27.3
          27.4
          27.7

       An example with two independent DAGs in the queue:

          $ condor_q

          -- Schedd: <a href="mailto:wenger@manta.cs.wisc.edu">wenger@manta.cs.wisc.edu</a> : &lt;128.105.14.228:35169?...

          wenger DAG: 3697    2/12 11:55      1      1      1     10 3709.0 ... 3710.0

          14 jobs; 0 completed, 0 removed, 1 idle, 13 running, 0 held, 0 suspended

       Note that the "13 running" in the last line is two more than the total of the RUN column, because the two
       <u>condor_dagman</u> jobs themselves are counted in the last line but not the RUN column.

       Also note that the "completed" value in the last line does not  correspond  to  the  total  of  the  DONE
       column,  because  the "completed" value in the last line only counts jobs that are completed but still in
       the queue, whereas the DONE column counts jobs that are no longer in the queue.

       Here's an example with a held job, illustrating the addition of the HOLD column to the output:

       Here are some examples with a nested-DAG workflow in the queue, which is  one  of  the  most  complicated
       cases.  The  workflow  consists  of  a  top-level  DAG with nodes NodeA and NodeB, each with two two-proc
       clusters; and a sub-DAG SubZ with nodes NodeSA and NodeSB, each with two two-proc clusters.

       First of all, non-batch mode with all of the node jobs in the queue:

          $ condor_q -nobatch

          10 jobs; 0 completed, 0 removed, 0 idle, 10 running, 0 held, 0 suspended

       Now non-batch mode with the <b>-dag</b> option (unfortunately, <u>condor_q</u> doesn't do a good job of grouping  procs
       in the same cluster together):

          $ condor_q -nobatch -dag

          10 jobs; 0 completed, 0 removed, 0 idle, 10 running, 0 held, 0 suspended

       Now, finally, the non-batch (default) mode:

          $ condor_q

          -- Schedd: <a href="mailto:wenger@manta.cs.wisc.edu">wenger@manta.cs.wisc.edu</a> : &lt;128.105.14.228:9619?...
          OWNER  BATCH_NAME     SUBMITTED   DONE   RUN    IDLE  TOTAL JOB_IDS
          wenger ex1.dag+591   9/13 16:05      _      8      _      5 592.0 ... 596.1

          10 jobs; 0 completed, 0 removed, 0 idle, 10 running, 0 held, 0 suspended

       There are several things about this output that may be slightly confusing:

       • The TOTAL column is less than the RUN column. This is because, for DAG node jobs, their contribution to
         the  TOTAL column is the number of clusters, not the number of procs (but their contribution to the RUN
         column is the number of procs). So the  four  DAG  nodes  (8  procs)  contribute  4,  and  the  sub-DAG
         contributes  1, to the TOTAL column.  (But, somewhat confusingly, the sub-DAG job is not counted in the
         RUN column.)

       • The sum of the RUN and IDLE columns (8) is less than the 10 jobs listed  in  the  totals  line  at  the
         bottom.  This is because the top-level DAG and sub-DAG jobs are not counted in the RUN column, but they
         are counted in the totals line.

       Now here is non-batch mode after proc 0 of each node job has finished:

          $ condor_q -nobatch

       The same state also with the <b>-dag</b> option:

          6 jobs; 0 completed, 0 removed, 0 idle, 6 running, 0 held, 0 suspended

       And, finally, that state in batch (default) mode:
