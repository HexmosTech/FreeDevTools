</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Qsub</u> submits batch jobs to the Grid Engine queuing system. Grid Engine supports single- and multiple-node
       jobs.  <u>command</u> can be a path to a binary or a script (see <b>-b</b> below) which contains the commands to be run
       by the job using a shell (for example,  <u><a href="../man1/sh.1.html">sh</a></u>(1)  or  <u><a href="../man1/csh.1.html">csh</a></u>(1)).   Arguments  to  the  command  are  given  as
       <u>command_args</u>  to  <u>qsub</u>.   If  <u>command</u>  is  handled  as a script then it is possible to embed flags in the
       script.  If the first two characters of a script line either match '#$' or are equal to the prefix string
       defined with the <b>-C</b> option described below, the line is parsed for embedded command flags.

       <u>Qsh</u> submits an interactive X-windows session to Grid Engine. An <u><a href="../man1/xterm.1.html">xterm</a></u>(1) is brought up from the executing
       machine with the display directed either to the X-server indicated by the DISPLAY environment variable or
       as specified with the <b>-display</b> option of <u>qsh</u>.  Interactive  jobs  are  not  spooled  if  no  resource  is
       available  to execute them. They are either dispatched to a suitable machine for execution immediately or
       the user submitting the job is notified by <u>qsh</u> that appropriate resources to  execute  the  job  are  not
       available.   <u>xterm_args</u>  are passed to the <u><a href="../man1/xterm.1.html">xterm</a></u>(1) executable.  Note, however, that the <u>-e</u> and <u>-ls</u> xterm
       options do not work with <u>qsh</u>.

       <u>Qlogin</u> is similar to <u>qsh</u> in that it submits an interactive job to the queuing system. It does not open an
       <u><a href="../man1/xterm.1.html">xterm</a></u>(1) window on the X display, but  uses  the  current  terminal  for  user  I/O.   It  establishes  a
       <u><a href="../man1/telnet.1.html">telnet</a></u>(1)-like   connection   with  the  remote  host,  using  the  configured  mechanisms  described  in
       <u><a href="../man5/remote_startup.5.html">remote_startup</a></u>(5).  <u>Qlogin</u> is invoked exactly like <u>qsh</u> and its jobs can only run on  INTERACTIVE  queues.
       <u>Qlogin</u> jobs can only be used if the <u><a href="../man8/sge_execd.8.html">sge_execd</a></u>(8) is running under the root account.

       <u>Qrsh</u>  is  similar  to  <u>qlogin</u>  in  that it submits an interactive job to the queuing system.  It uses the
       current terminal for user I/O.  With a command, it establishes a <u><a href="../man1/rsh.1.html">rsh</a></u>(1)-like connection with  the  remote
       host.  If  no command is given to <u>qrsh</u>, an <u><a href="../man1/rlogin.1.html">rlogin</a></u>(1)-like session is established.  It uses the configured
       mechanisms described in <u><a href="../man5/remote_startup.5.html">remote_startup</a></u>(5).  <u>Qrsh</u> jobs can only  run  in  INTERACTIVE  queues  unless  the
       option  <b>-now</b>  <b>no</b> is used (see below).  They can also only be run if the <u><a href="../man8/sge_execd.8.html">sge_execd</a></u>(8) is running under the
       root account.

       <u>Qrsh</u> provides an additional useful feature for integrating with interactive tools  providing  a  specific
       command  shell.  If  the  environment  variable  <b>QRSH_WRAPPER</b>  is  set  when <u>qrsh</u> is invoked, the command
       interpreter pointed to by <b>QRSH_WRAPPER</b> will be executed to run <u>qrsh</u> commands instead of the user's  login
       shell  or  any  shell specified in the <u>qrsh</u> command-line.  The options <b>-cwd</b>,  <b>-v</b>,  <b>-V</b>,  and <b>-display</b> only
       apply to batch jobs.

       <u>Qalter</u> can be used to change the attributes of pending jobs. For array jobs with a  mix  of  running  and
       pending tasks (see the <b>-t</b> option below), modification with <u>qalter</u> only affects the pending tasks.  <u>Qalter</u>
       can  change most of the characteristics of a job (see the corresponding statements in the OPTIONS section
       below), including those which were defined as embedded flags in the script file (see above).   An  option
       specified with <u>qalter</u> completely replaces any parameters previously specified for the job by that option,
       e.g.  if  the job has a resource requirement corresponding to <b>-l</b> <b>h_rt=3600,h_vmem=2G</b>, then after a <b>qalter</b>
       <b>-l</b> <b>h_rt=7200</b>, the resource requirement is simply <b>h_rt=7200</b>; it is not currently possible to override  one
       or more values.

       Some  submit  options, such as the job script, cannot be changed with <u>qalter</u>.  If parameters are set with
       <u>qalter</u>, the output from <b>qstat</b> <b>-j</b> acquires an additional field, <b>version</b>, which is incremented each time.

       If a server JSV is defined, modifications are  forbidden  unless  they  are  explicitly  allowed  by  the
       <u><a href="../man5/sge_conf.5.html">sge_conf</a></u>(5) parameter <b>jsv_allowed_mod</b>.  (See also <u><a href="../man1/jsv.1.html">jsv</a></u>(1).)

       <u>Qresub</u> allows the user to create jobs as copies of existing pending or running jobs. The copied jobs will
       have  exactly  the  same attributes as the ones from which they were copied, except with a new job ID and
       with a cleared hold state. The only modification to the copied jobs supported by <u>qresub</u> is assignment  of
       a  new  hold  state  with  the <b>-h</b> option. This option can be used to first copy a job and then change its
       attributes via <u>qalter</u>.

       Only a manager can use <u>qresub</u> on jobs submitted by another user.  Regular users can only  use  <u>qresub</u>  on
       their own jobs.

       See <u><a href="../man8/sge_shepherd.8.html">sge_shepherd</a></u>(8) for the significance of exit codes returned by the submitted job.

       For  <u>qsub</u>,  <u>qsh</u>,  <u>qrsh</u>,  and  <u>qlogin</u> the administrator and the user may define default request files (see
       <u><a href="../man5/sge_request.5.html">sge_request</a></u>(5)) which can contain any of the options described below.  If an option in a default  request
       file  is  understood  by <u>qsub</u> and <u>qlogin</u> but not by <u>qsh</u> the option is silently ignored if <u>qsh</u> is invoked.
       Thus you can maintain shared default request files for both <u>qsub</u> and <u>qsh</u>.

       A cluster-wide default request file may be  placed  under  <u>$SGE_ROOT/$SGE_CELL/common/sge_request</u>.   User
       private default request files are processed under the locations <u>$HOME/.sge_request</u> and <u>$cwd/.sge_request</u>.
       The working directory local default request file has the highest precedence, then the home directory file
       and then the cluster global file.  The option arguments, the embedded script flags and the options in the
       default request files are processed in the following order:

              left to right in the script line,
              left to right in the default request files,
              from top to bottom of the script file (<u>qsub</u> only),
              from top to bottom of default request files,
              from left to right of the command line.

       In  other  words,  the  command  line  can be used to override the embedded flags and the default request
       settings.  The embedded flags, however, will override the default settings.

       <b>Note</b>, that the <b>-clear</b> option can be used to discard any previous  settings  at  any  time  in  a  default
       request  file,  in  the embedded script flags, or in a command-line option. It is, however, not available
       with <u>qalter</u>.

       The request options described below can be requested either hard or soft.  By default, all  requests  are
       considered hard until the <b>-soft</b> option (see below) is encountered. The hard/soft status remains in effect
       until  its  counterpart  is encountered again.  If all the hard requests for a job cannot be met, the job
       will not be scheduled.  Jobs which cannot be run at the present time remain spooled.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-@</b> <u>optionfile</u>
              Forces <u>qsub</u>, <u>qrsh</u>, <u>qsh</u>, or <u>qlogin</u> to use the options contained in <u>optionfile</u>. The  indicated  file
              may contain all valid options. Comment lines must start with a "#" sign.

       <b>-a</b> <u>date_time</u>
              Available for <u>qsub</u> and <u>qalter</u> only.

              Defines  or  redefines the time and date at which a job is eligible for execution. <u>date_time</u> is of
              the form [[<u>CC</u>]<u>YY</u>]<u>MMDDhhmm</u>[<b>.</b><u>SS</u>]; for the details, please see <b>date_time</b> in <u><a href="../man5/sge_types.5.html">sge_types</a></u>(5).

              If this option is used with <u>qsub</u> or if a corresponding value is specified in <u>qmon</u> then a parameter
              named <b>a</b> and the value in the format CCYYMMDDhhmm.SS will be passed to the defined  JSV  instances.
              (See <b>-jsv</b> option below or find more information concerning JSV in <u><a href="../man1/jsv.1.html">jsv</a></u>(1).)

       <b>-ac</b> <u>variable</u>[<b>=</b><u>value</u>]<b>,</b>...
              Available for <u>qsub</u>, <u>qsh</u>, <u>qrsh</u>, <u>qlogin</u> and <u>qalter</u> only.

              Adds  the given name/value pair(s) to the job's context. <u>value</u> may be omitted. Grid Engine appends
              the given argument to the list of context variables for the  job.   Multiple  <b>-ac</b>,  <b>-dc</b>,  and  <b>-sc</b>
              options may be given.  The order is important here.

              The  outcome of the evaluation of all <b>-ac</b>, <b>-dc</b>, and <b>-sc</b> options or corresponding values in <u>qmon</u> is
              passed to defined JSV instances as parameter with the name <b>ac</b>.  (See <b>-jsv</b>  option  below  or  find
              more information concerning JSV in <u><a href="../man1/jsv.1.html">jsv</a></u>(1).)

              <u>Qalter</u> allows changing this option even while the job executes.

       <b>-ar</b> <u>ar_id</u>
              Available for <u>qsub</u>, <u>qalter</u>, <u>qrsh</u>, <u>qsh</u>, or <u>qlogin</u> only.

              Assigns  the  submitted  job  to  be a part of an existing Advance Reservation with id <u>ar_id</u>.  The
              complete list of existing Advance Reservations can be obtained using the <u><a href="../man1/qrstat.1.html">qrstat</a></u>(1) command.

              Note that the <b>-ar</b> option implicitly adds the <b>-w</b> <b>e</b> option if not otherwise requested.

              <u>Qalter</u> allows changing this option even while the job executes. The modified parameter  will  only
              be in effect after a restart or migration of the job however.

              If  this  option  or  a corresponding value in <u>qmon</u> is specified then this value will be passed to
              defined JSV instances as parameter with the  name  <b>ar</b>.   (See  <b>-jsv</b>  option  below  or  find  more
              information concerning JSV in <u><a href="../man1/jsv.1.html">jsv</a></u>(1).)

       <b>-A</b> <u>account_string</u>
              Available for <u>qsub</u>, <u>qsh</u>, <u>qrsh</u>, <u>qlogin</u> and <u>qalter</u> only.

              Identifies  the  account  to  which  the  resource  consumption  of the job should be charged. The
              <u>account_string</u> should conform to the <u>account_name</u> definition in <u><a href="../man5/sge_types.5.html">sge_types</a></u>(5).  In the  absence  of
              this parameter Grid Engine will place the default account string "sge" in the accounting record of
              the job.

              <u>Qalter</u> allows changing this option even while the job executes.

              If  this  option  or  a corresponding value in <u>qmon</u> is specified then this value will be passed to
              defined JSV instances as parameter with  the  name  <b>A</b>.   (See  <b>-jsv</b>  option  below  or  find  more
              information concerning JSV in <u><a href="../man1/jsv.1.html">jsv</a></u>(1).)

       <b>-b</b> <b>y</b>[<b>es</b>]|<b>n</b>[<b>o</b>]
              Available  for  <u>qsub</u>, <u>qrsh</u> only. <u>Qalter</u> does not allow changing this option. This option cannot be
              embedded in the script file itself.

              Gives the user the possibility to indicate explicitly whether <u>command</u> should be treated as  binary
              or  script.  If  the  argument of <b>-b</b> is 'y', then <u>command</u>  may be a binary or script.  The <u>command</u>
              might not be accessible from the submission host.  Nothing except the path of the <u>command</u> will  be
              transferred  from  the submission host to the execution host. Path aliasing will be applied to the
              path of <u>command</u> before it is executed.

              If the argument of <b>-b</b> is 'n' then <u>command</u> needs to be a script, and it will be  handled  as  such.
              The  script  file  has  to  be  accessible  by  the submission host. It will be transferred to the
              execution host. <u>qsub</u>/<u>qrsh</u> will search directive prefixes within scripts.

              <u>qsub</u> will implicitly use <b>-b</b> <b>n</b>, whereas <u>qrsh</u>  will  apply  the  <b>-b</b> <b>y</b>  option  if  nothing  else  is
              specified.

              The  value  specified  with  this option or the corresponding value specified in <u>qmon</u> will only be
              passed to defined JSV instances if the value is <u>yes</u>.  The name of the parameter  will  be  <b>b</b>.  The
              value  will  be  <b>y</b>  also when the long form <b>yes</b> was specified during submission.  (See <b>-jsv</b> option
              below or find more information concerning JSV in <u><a href="../man1/jsv.1.html">jsv</a></u>(1).)

              Please note that submission of <u>command</u> as a script (<b>-b</b>  <b>n</b>)  can  have  a  significant  performance
              impact, especially for short running jobs and big job scripts.  Script submission adds a number of
              operations to the submission process: The job script needs to be
              - parsed at client side (for special comments)
              - transferred from submit client to qmaster
              - spooled in qmaster
              - transferred to execd at job execution
              - spooled in execd
              - removed from spooling both in execd and qmaster once the job is done
              If  job  scripts  are available on the execution nodes, e.g. via NFS, binary submission can be the
              better choice.

       <b>-binding</b> [<u>binding_instance</u>] <u>binding_strategy</u>
              A job can request a specific processor core binding (processor affinity) with this parameter. This
              request is neither a hard nor a soft request, it is a hint for the execution host to  do  this  if
              possible.   Please  note  that  the  requested binding strategy is not used for resource selection
              within Grid Engine.  As a result an execution host might be selected where Grid  Engine  does  not
              even  know  the  hardware topology and therefore is not able to apply the requested binding.  (The
              binding facility depends on the platform, and on  Grid  Engine  being  compiled  with  appropriate
              support.)

              To  make Grid Engine select hardware on which the binding can be applied, please use the <b>-l</b> switch
              in combination with the complex attribute <b>m_topology</b>.

              <u>binding_instance</u> is an optional parameter. It might either be <b>env</b>, <b>pe</b> or <b>set</b>  depending  on  which
              instance  should  accomplish  the  job  to  core binding. If the value for <u>binding_instance</u> is not
              specified then <b>set</b> will be used.

              <b>env</b> means that only the environment variable <b>SGE_BINDING</b> will be exported to the  job  environment
              of  the  job. This variable contains the selected operating system internal processor numbers.  In
              presence of SMT or CMT it may contain more than the number of cores selected,  because  each  core
              could  be  represented  by  multiple  processor  identifiers.   The  processor  numbers are space-
              separated.

              <b>pe</b> means that the information about the selected  cores  appears  in  the  fourth  column  of  the
              <b>pe_hostfile</b>.  Here  the  logical  core and socket numbers are printed (they start at 0 and have no
              holes) in colon-separated pairs (e.g. "0,0:1,0", which means core 0 on socket  0  and  core  0  on
              socket 1).  For more information about the $pe_hostfile check <u><a href="../man5/sge_pe.5.html">sge_pe</a></u>(5).  In addition, <b>SGE_BINDING</b>
              is set as for <b>env</b> binding.

              <b>set</b>  (the default if nothing else is specified) means that the binding strategy is applied by Grid
              Engine.  Each shepherd (on the master host, or those connected to with qrsh -inherit) is bound  to
              the  relevant  cores.   The binding is inherited by the task that is started, so that processes or
              threads it spawns are bound to those cores, but it is up to the task to  make  any  more  specific
              bindings  of  its  sub-tasks within the set of bound cores it inherits.  How Grid Engine does this
              depends on the underlying hardware architecture of the execution host where the submitted job will
              be started.  In addition, <b>SGE_BINDING</b> is set as for <b>env</b> binding.

              Binding will be done to restrict the job to run exclusively on the selected cores, if possible  on
              the  platform;  otherwise  bound  processes  may  still be able to use other cores.  The operating
              system will probably allow other unbound processes to use these cores.  Note that if all cores  on
              a  node  are specified to be bound by one job, that is probably equivalent to no binding, with the
              task free to use all the cores.

              The <u>loadcheck</u> tool in the <u>utilbin</u> directory can be used to check the host's capabilities.  You can
              also use <b>-sep</b> in combination with <b>-cb</b> of <u><a href="../man5/qconf.5.html">qconf</a></u>(5) to find whether Grid Engine is able to recognize
              the hardware topology.  <u><a href="../man1/hwloc-ps.1.html">hwloc-ps</a></u>(1) can be used to check the bindings in force on a host.

              Possible values for <u>binding_strategy</u> are as follows:

                  <b>linear:</b>[<u>number</u>[<b>:</b><u>socket</u><b>,</b><u>core</u>]]
                  <b>striding:</b><u>number</u><b>:</b><u>n</u>[<b>:</b><u>socket</u><b>,</b><u>core</u>]
                  <b>explicit:</b><u>socket</u><b>,</b><u>core</u>[<b>:</b><u>socket</u><b>,</b><u>core</u>]...

              For the binding strategies "linear" and "striding" there is  an  optional  socket  and  core  pair
              attached. These denote the mandatory starting point for the first core to bind on.  Logical socket
              and core numbers are used, per <u><a href="../man7/hwloc.7.html">hwloc</a></u>(7).

              <b>linear</b> means that Grid Engine tries to bind the job on <u>number</u> successive cores. If <u>socket</u> and <u>core</u>
              are  omitted  then  Grid  Engine first allocates successive cores on the first empty socket found.
              ("Empty" means that there are no jobs bound to the  socket  by  Grid  Engine.)   If  this  is  not
              possible,  or  is not sufficient, Grid Engine tries to find (further) cores on the socket with the
              most unbound cores, and so on.  If <u>socket</u> and <u>core</u> are specified, then Grid Engine tries  to  find
              empty  cores with this starting point. If the binding request cannot be satisfied, then binding is
              not done on the host concerned.  <u>number</u> may be omitted or specified as <b>slots</b>.   In  that  case  it
              will  be  taken  as the number of slots assigned to the job on a per-host basis, on the assumption
              that one slot per core is used.  That allows binding to work when parallel jobs run  across  nodes
              with  variable  slot  counts  per node.  Multiple processing units (hardware threads) per core are
              currently not taken into account in this, but systems running such parallel  jobs  will  typically
              have  only  a  single  thread  per  core.   <b>-binding</b>  <b>linear</b>  is  a reasonable overall default for
              <u><a href="../man5/sge_request.5.html">sge_request</a></u>(5) in many cases.

              <b>striding</b> means that Grid Engine tries to find cores with a certain offset.  It will select  <u>number</u>
              of  empty  cores  with  an offset of <b>n</b>-1 cores in between. Start point for the search algorithm is
              socket 0 core 0. As soon as <u>number</u> cores are found they will be used to do the  job  binding.   If
              there  are  not  enough  empty cores, or if the correct offset cannot be achieved, then no binding
              will be done on the host concerned.

              <b>explicit</b> binds the specified sockets and cores that are  mentioned  in  the  provided  socket/core
              list. Each socket/core pair has to be specified only once. If a socket/core pair is already in use
              by a different job, the whole binding request will be ignored.

              Note  that a binding like "<b>pe</b> <b>linear:</b><u>number</u>..."  is only useful if the job has exclusive access to
              its multiple compute nodes, they all have the same topology, and the PE  has  a  fixed  allocation
              rule (<b>allocation_rule</b> <u>n</u>).  (The $pe_hostfile content is created on the job's master host, with the
              same  &lt;socket,core&gt;  specification  for  each.)   This  method  can't  be  used for job isolation.
              Similarly, <b>set</b> requires a fixed allocation per host for distributed parallel jobs.

              <b>Qalter</b> allows changing this option even while the job executes. The modified parameter  will  only
              be in effect after a restart or migration of the job, however.

              If this option, or a corresponding value in qmon, is specified then these values will be passed to
              defined JSV instances as parameters with the names <b>binding_strategy</b>, <b>binding_type</b>, <b>binding_amount</b>,
              <b>binding_step</b>,      <b>binding_socket</b>,      <b>binding_core</b>,     <b>binding_exp_n</b>,     <b>binding_exp_socket</b><u>id</u>,
              <b>binding_exp_core</b><u>id</u>.

              Please note that the length of the socket/core value list of the explicit binding is  reported  as
              <b>binding_exp_n</b>.  <u>id</u>  will  be  replaced by the position of the socket/core pair within the explicit
              list (0 &lt;= <u>id</u> &lt; <b>binding_exp_n</b>).  The first socket/core  pair  of  the  explicit  binding  will  be
              reported with the parameter names <b>binding_exp_socket0</b> and <b>binding_exp_core0</b>.

              Values that do not apply for the specified binding will not be reported to JSV.  E.g. <b>binding_step</b>
              will  only be reported for the striding binding and all <b>binding_exp_*</b> values will passed to JSV if
              explicit binding was specified.  (See <b>-jsv</b> option below or find more information concerning JSV in
              <u>jsv1</u>(.))

       <b>-c</b> <u>occasion_specifier</u>
              Available for <u>qsub</u> and <u>qalter</u> only.

              Defines or redefines whether the job should be checkpointed, and if so, under what  circumstances.
              The  specification  of  the checkpointing occasions with this option overwrites the definitions of
              the <u>when</u> parameter  in  the  checkpointing  environment  (see  <u><a href="../man5/checkpoint.5.html">checkpoint</a></u>(5))  referenced  by  the
              <b>qsub</b> <b>-ckpt</b> switch.  Possible values for <u>occasion_specifier</u> are

              <b>n</b>      No checkpoint is performed;

              <b>s</b>      Checkpoint when batch server is shut down;

              <b>m</b>      Checkpoint at minimum CPU interval;

              <b>x</b>      Checkpoint when job gets suspended;

              <b>r</b>      Reschedule when execution host goes into the "unknown" state;

              <u>interval</u>
                     Checkpoint in the specified interval (a <b>time_specifier</b> per <u><a href="../man5/sge_types.5.html">sge_types</a></u>(5)).

              The  minimum  CPU  interval is defined in the queue configuration (see <u><a href="../man5/queue_conf.5.html">queue_conf</a></u>(5) for details).
              If <u>interval</u> is specified, the maximum of that and the queue's minimum CPU  interval  is  used  (to
              ensure that a machine is not overloaded by checkpoints being generated too frequently).

              The  value  specified with this option or the corresponding value specified in <u>qmon</u> will be passed
              to defined JSV instances.  The <u>interval</u> will be available as parameter with the  name  <b>c_interval</b>.
              The  character  sequence specified will be available as parameter with the name <b>c_occasion</b>. Please
              note that if you change  <b>c_occasion</b>  via  JSV,  then  the  last  setting  of  <b>c_interval</b>  will  be
              overwritten,  and  vice  versa.  (See <b>-jsv</b> option below or find more information concerning JSV in
              <u><a href="../man1/jsv.1.html">jsv</a></u>(1).)

       <b>-ckpt</b> <u>ckpt_name</u>
              Available for <u>qsub</u> and <u>qalter</u> only.

              Selects the checkpointing environment (see <u><a href="../man5/checkpoint.5.html">checkpoint</a></u>(5)) to be used for  checkpointing  the  job.
              Also declares the job to be a checkpointing job.

              If  this  option  or  a corresponding value in <u>qmon</u> is specified then this value will be passed to
              defined JSV instances as parameter with the name <b>ckpt</b>.   (See  <b>-jsv</b>  option  below  or  find  more
              information concerning JSV in <u><a href="../man1/jsv.1.html">jsv</a></u>(1).)

       <b>-clear</b> Available for <u>qsub</u>, <u>qsh</u>, <u>qrsh</u>, and <u>qlogin</u> only.

              Causes  all  elements  of  the job to be reset to the initial default status prior to applying any
              modifications (if any) appearing in this specific command.

       <b>-cwd</b>   Available for <u>qsub</u>, <u>qsh</u>, <u>qrsh</u> and <u>qalter</u> only.

              Execute the job from the current working directory.  This switch will activate Grid Engine's  path
              aliasing facility, if the corresponding configuration files are present (see <u><a href="../man5/sge_aliases.5.html">sge_aliases</a></u>(5)).

              In  the  case  of  <u>qalter</u>,  the  previous  definition  of  the  current  working directory will be
              overwritten if <u>qalter</u> is executed from a different directory than the preceding <u>qsub</u> or <u>qalter</u>.

              <u>Qalter</u> allows changing this option even while the job executes. The modified parameter  will  only
              be in effect after a restart or migration of the job, however.

              If  this  option  or  a corresponding value in <u>qmon</u> is specified then this value will be passed to
              defined JSV instances as parameter with the name <b>cwd</b>. The value of  this  parameter  will  be  the
              absolute  path  to the current working directory. JSV scripts can remove the path from jobs during
              the verification process by setting the value of this parameter to an empty string.  As  a  result
              the  job  behaves  as  if <b>-cwd</b> was not specified during job submission.  (See <b>-jsv</b> option below or
              find more information concerning JSV in <u><a href="../man1/jsv.1.html">jsv</a></u>(1).)

       <b>-C</b> <u>prefix_string</u>
              Available for <u>qsub</u> and <u>qrsh</u> with script submission (<b>-b</b> <b>n</b>).

              <u>Prefix_string</u> defines the prefix that declares a directive in the job's command. The prefix is not
              a job attribute, but affects the behavior of <u>qsub</u> and <u>qrsh</u>.  If  <u>prefix</u>  is  a  null  string,  the
              command will not be scanned for embedded directives.
              The directive prefix consists of two ASCII characters which, when appearing in the first two bytes
              of a script line, indicate that what follows is an Grid Engine command.  The default is "#$".
              The  user should be aware that changing the first delimiting character can produce unforeseen side
              effects. If the script file contains anything other  than  a  "#"  character  in  the  first  byte
              position  of  the  line, the shell processor for the job will reject the line and may exit the job
              prematurely.
              If the -C option is present in the script file, it is ignored.

       <b>-dc</b> <u>variable</u>,...
              Available for <u>qsub</u>, <u>qsh</u>, <u>qrsh</u>, <u>qlogin</u> and <u>qalter</u> only.

              Removes the given variable(s) from the job's context.  Multiple <b>-ac</b>, <b>-dc</b>, and <b>-sc</b> options  may  be
              given.  The order is important.

              <u>Qalter</u> allows changing this option even while the job executes.

              The  outcome of the evaluation of all <b>-ac</b>, <b>-dc</b>, and <b>-sc</b> options or corresponding values in <u>qmon</u> is
              passed to defined JSV instances as parameter with the name <b>ac</b>.  (See <b>-jsv</b>  option  below  or  find
              more information concerning JSV in <u><a href="../man1/jsv.1.html">jsv</a></u>(1).)

       <b>-display</b> <u>display_specifier</u>
              Available for <u>qsh</u> and <u>qrsh</u> with a command.

              Directs <u><a href="../man1/xterm.1.html">xterm</a></u>(1) to use <u>display_specifier</u> in order to contact the X server.  The <u>display_specifier</u>
              has  to  contain the hostname part of the display name (e.g. myhost:1).  Local display names (e.g.
              :0) cannot be used in grid environments.  Values set with the <b>-display</b> option  overwrite  settings
              from the submission environment and from <b>-v</b> command line options.

              If  this  option  or  a corresponding value in <u>qmon</u> is specified then this value will be passed to
              defined JSV instances as parameter with the name <b>display</b>. This value will also be available in the
              job environment which might optionally be passed  to  JSV  scripts.  The  variable  name  will  be
              <b>DISPLAY</b>.  (See <b>-jsv</b> option below or find more information concerning JSV in <u><a href="../man1/jsv.1.html">jsv</a></u>(1).)

       <b>-dl</b> <u>date_time</u>
              Available for <u>qsub</u>, <u>qsh</u>, <u>qrsh</u>, <u>qlogin</u> and <u>qalter</u> only.

              Specifies  the deadline initiation time in [[<u>CC</u>]<u>YY</u>]<u>MMDDhhmm</u>[<b>.</b><u>SS</u>] format (see <b>-a</b> option above). The
              deadline initiation time is the time at which a deadline job has to reach top priority to be  able
              to  complete  within  a  given  deadline.  Before  the  deadline initiation time the priority of a
              deadline job will be raised steadily until it reaches the maximum as configured by the Grid Engine
              administrator.

              This option is applicable only for users allowed to submit deadline jobs.

              If this option or a corresponding value in <u>qmon</u> is specified then this value  will  be  passed  to
              defined  JSV  instances  as  parameter  with  the  name  <b>dl</b>. The format for the date_time value is
              CCYYMMDDhhmm.SS.  (See <b>-jsv</b> option below or find more information concerning JSV in <u><a href="../man1/jsv.1.html">jsv</a></u>(1).)

       <b>-e</b> [[<u>hostname</u>]<b>:</b>]<u>path</u>...
              Available for <u>qsub</u> and <u>qalter</u> only, but currently silently ignored by <u>qsh</u>, <u>qrsh</u>, and <u>qlogin</u>.

              Defines or redefines the path used for the standard error stream of the job.  For  <u>qsh</u>,  <u>qrsh</u>  and
              <u>qlogin</u> only the standard error stream of prolog and epilog is redirected.  If the <u>path</u> constitutes
              an absolute path name, the error-path attribute of the job is set to <u>path</u>, including the <u>hostname</u>.
              If  the  path  name  is relative, Grid Engine expands <u>path</u>, either relative to the current working
              directory (if the <b>-cwd</b> switch - see above - is also  specified)  or  to  the  home  directory.  If
              <u>hostname</u>  is  present, the standard error stream will be placed in the corresponding location only
              if the job runs on the specified host. If the path contains a ":" without a  <u>hostname</u>,  a  leading
              ":" has to be specified.

              By  default  the file name for interactive jobs is <u>/dev/null</u>. For batch jobs the default file name
              has the form <u>job_name</u><b>.e</b><u>job_id</u> and <u>job_name</u><b>.e</b><u>job_id</u><b>.</b><u>task_id</u> for array  job  tasks  (see  <b>-t</b>  option
              below).

              If  <u>path</u>  is a directory, the standard error stream of the job will be put in this directory under
              the default file name.  If the pathname contains certain pseudo environment variables, their value
              will be expanded at runtime of the job and will be used to constitute the  standard  error  stream
              path name. The following pseudo environment variables are supported currently; note the lack of an
              <b>Grid</b> <b>Engine_</b> prefix in this context:

              $HOME       home directory on execution machine
              $USER       user ID of job owner
              $JOB_ID     current job ID
              $JOB_NAME   current job name (see <b>-N</b> option)
              $HOSTNAME   name of the execution host
              $TASK_ID    array job task index number

              The tilde sign "~" can be used as an alternative to $HOME, as in <u><a href="../man1/csh.1.html">csh</a></u>(1), <u><a href="../man1/bash.1.html">bash</a></u>(1), or <u><a href="../man1/ksh.1.html">ksh</a></u>(1).  Note
              that  the  "~" sign also works in combination with user names, so that "~<u>user</u>" expands to the home
              directory of <u>user</u>. Using another user ID  than  that  of  the  job  owner  requires  corresponding
              permissions, of course.

              <u>Qalter</u>  allows  changing this option even while the job executes. The modified parameter will only
              be in effect after a restart or migration of the job, however.

              If this option or a corresponding value in <u>qmon</u> is specified then this value  will  be  passed  to
              defined  JSV  instances  as  parameter  with  the  name  <b>e</b>.   (See  <b>-jsv</b> option below or find more
              information concerning JSV in <u><a href="../man1/jsv.1.html">jsv</a></u>(1).)

       <b>-hard</b>  Available for <u>qsub</u>, <u>qsh</u>, <u>qrsh</u>, <u>qlogin</u> and <u>qalter</u> only.

              Signifies that all <b>-q</b> and <b>-l</b> resource requirements following in the  command  line  will  be  hard
              requirements and must be satisfied in full before a job can be scheduled.
              As  Grid  Engine  scans the command line and script file for Grid Engine options and parameters it
              builds a list of resources required by a job. All such resource requests are  normally  considered
              as  absolutely  essential  for  the  job to commence.  However, if the <b>-soft</b> option (see below) is
              encountered during the scan then all following resources are designated as "soft requirements" for
              execution, or "nice-to-have, but not essential". If the <b>-hard</b> flag is encountered at a later stage
              of the scan, all resource requests following it once again become essential. The <b>-hard</b>  and  <b>-soft</b>
              options in effect act as toggles during the scan.

              If  this  option  or  a  corresponding value in <u>qmon</u> is specified then the corresponding <b>-q</b> and <b>-l</b>
              resource requirements will be passed to defined JSV instances as parameter with the  names  <b>q_hard</b>
              and  <b>l_hard</b>. Find for information in the sections describing <b>-q</b> and <b>-l</b>.  (See <b>-jsv</b> option below or
              find more information concerning JSV in <u><a href="../man1/jsv.1.html">jsv</a></u>(1).)

       <b>-h</b> | <b>-h</b> {<b>u</b>|<b>s</b>|<b>o</b>|<b>n</b>|<b>U</b>|<b>O</b>|<b>S</b>}...
              Available for <u>qsub</u> (only <b>-h</b>), <u>qrsh</u>, <u>qalter</u>  and  <u>qresub</u>  (hold  state  is  removed  when  not  set
              explicitly).

              List of holds to place on a job, a task or some tasks of a job.

              `u'  denotes a user hold.
              `s'  denotes a system hold.
              `o'  denotes a operator hold.
              `n'  denotes no hold (requires manager privileges).

              As  long  as any hold other than `n' is assigned to the job the job is not eligible for execution.
              Holds can be released via <u>qalter</u> and <u><a href="../man1/qrls.1.html">qrls</a></u>(1).   In  case  of  <u>qalter</u>  this  is  supported  by  the
              following additional option specifiers for the <b>-h</b> switch:

              `U'  removes a user hold.
              `S'  removes a system hold.
              `O'  removes a operator hold.

              Grid  Engine  managers  can assign and remove all hold types, Grid Engine operators can assign and
              remove user and operator holds, and users can only assign or remove user holds.

              In the case of <u>qsub</u> only user holds can be placed on a job and thus only the  first  form  of  the
              option  with  the <b>-h</b> switch alone is allowed.  As opposed to this, <u>qalter</u> requires the second form
              described above.

              An alternate means to assign a hold is provided by the <u><a href="../man1/qhold.1.html">qhold</a></u>(1) facility.

              If the job is an array job (see the <b>-t</b> option below), all tasks specified via <b>-t</b> are  affected  by
              the <b>-h</b> operation simultaneously.

              <u>Qalter</u>  allows  changing this option even while the job executes. The modified parameter will only
              be in effect after a restart or migration of the job, however.

              If this option is specified with <u>qsub</u> or during the submission of a job in <u>qmon</u> then the parameter
              <b>h</b> with the value <b>u</b> will be passed to the defined JSV instances indicating that the job will be  in
              user  hold  after  the  submission  finishes.   (See  <b>-jsv</b>  option  below or find more information
              concerning JSV in <u><a href="../man1/jsv.1.html">jsv</a></u>(1).)

       <b>-help</b>  Prints  a listing of all options.

       <b>-hold_jid</b> <u>wc_job_list</u>
              Available for <u>qsub</u>, <u>qrsh</u>, and <u>qalter</u> only. See <u><a href="../man5/sge_types.5.html">sge_types</a></u>(5).  For the definition of <u>wc_job_list</u>.

              Defines or redefines the job dependency list of the submitted job. A  reference  by  job  name  or
              pattern is only accepted if the referenced job is owned by the same user as the referring job. The
              submitted  job is not eligible for execution unless all jobs referenced in the comma-separated job
              id and/or job name list have completed.  If any of the referenced jobs exits with exit  code  100,
              the submitted job will remain ineligible for execution.

              With  the help of job names or regular patterns, one can specify a job dependency on multiple jobs
              satisfying the regular pattern, or on all jobs with the requested name. The name dependencies  are
              resolved at submit time and can only be changed via qalter. New jobs or name changes of other jobs
              will  not  be  taken  into  account.   To  remove  a  job  dependency list with <u>qalter</u>, use a null
              <u>wc_job_list</u>, i.e. use
                 <b>qalter</b> <b>-hold_jid</b> <b>''</b> <b>...</b>

              <u>Qalter</u> allows changing this option even while the job executes. The modified parameter  will  only
              be in effect after a restart or migration of the job, however.

              If  this  option  or  a corresponding value in <u>qmon</u> is specified then this value will be passed to
              defined JSV instances as parameter with the name <b>hold_jid</b>.  (See <b>-jsv</b> option below  or  find  more
              information concerning JSV in <u><a href="../man1/jsv.1.html">jsv</a></u>(1).)

       <b>-hold_jid_ad</b> <u>wc_job_list</u>
              Available for <u>qsub</u>, <u>qrsh</u>, and <u>qalter</u> only. See <u><a href="../man5/sge_types.5.html">sge_types</a></u>(5) for the definition of <u>wc_job_list</u>.

              Defines  or  redefines the job array dependency list of the submitted job. A reference by job name
              or pattern is only accepted if the referenced job is owned by the same user as the referring  job.
              Each  sub-task  of  the  submitted job is not eligible for execution unless the corresponding sub-
              tasks of all jobs referenced in the comma-separated job id and/or job name  list  have  completed.
              If dependent jobs have a different array stride to referenced jobs, the dependency may be many-to-
              one  or one-to-many, e.g. if an array is submitted with <b>-t</b> <b>1:50:2</b>, depending on one submitted with
              <b>-t</b> <b>1:50</b>, then task <u>n</u> of the dependent depends on task <u>n</u>+1 of the other.

              If any array task of the referenced jobs exits with exit code 100,  the  dependent  tasks  of  the
              submitted job will remain ineligible for execution.

              With  the help of job names or regular patterns, one can specify a job dependency on multiple jobs
              satisfying the regular pattern, or on all jobs with the requested name. The name dependencies  are
              resolved at submit time and can only be changed via qalter. New jobs or name changes of other jobs
              will not be taken into account.

              If  either  the  submitted job or any job in <u>wc_job_list</u> are not array jobs with the same range of
              sub-tasks (see <b>-t</b> option below), the request list will be rejected and the job  create  or  modify
              operation will return an error.

              <u>qalter</u>  allows  changing this option even while the job executes. The modified parameter will only
              be in effect after a restart or migration of the job, however.

              If this option or a corresponding value in <u>qmon</u> is specified, then this value will  be  passed  to
              defined  JSV  instances  as a parameter with the name <b>hold_jid_ad</b>.  (See <b>-jsv</b> option below or find
              more information concerning JSV in <u><a href="../man1/jsv.1.html">jsv</a></u>(1).)

       <b>-i</b> [[<u>hostname</u>]<b>:</b>]<u>path</u><b>,</b>...
              Available for <u>qsub</u>, and <u>qalter</u> only.

              Defines or redefines the path used for the standard input stream of the job.  The <u>path</u> is  handled
              as described in the <b>-e</b> option for the standard error stream.

              By default <u>/dev/null</u> is the input stream for the job.

              It  is  possible  to use certain pseudo variables, whose values will be expanded at runtime of the
              job and will be used to express the standard input stream as described in the <u>-e</u>  option  for  the
              standard error stream.

              <u>Qalter</u>  allows  changing this option even while the job executes. The modified parameter will only
              be in effect after a restart or migration of the job, however.

              If this option or a corresponding value in <u>qmon</u> is specified then this value  will  be  passed  to
              defined  JSV  instances  as  parameter  with  the  name  <b>i</b>.   (See  <b>-jsv</b> option below or find more
              information concerning JSV in <u><a href="../man1/jsv.1.html">jsv</a></u>(1).)

       <b>-inherit</b>
              Available only for <u>qrsh</u> and <u><a href="../man1/qmake.1.html">qmake</a></u>(1).

              <u>qrsh</u> allows the user to start a task in an already scheduled parallel job.   The  option  <b>-inherit</b>
              tells  <u>qrsh</u>  to read a job id from the environment variable JOB_ID and start the specified command
              as a task in this job. Please note that in this case, the hostname of the host where  the  command
              will be executed must precede the command to execute; the syntax changes to

              <b>qrsh</b> <b>-inherit</b> [<u>other</u> <u>options</u>] <u>hostname</u> <u>command</u> [<u>command_args</u>]

              Note  also,  that  in  combination with <b>-inherit</b>, most other command line options will be ignored.
              Only the options <b>-verbose</b>, <b>-v</b> and <b>-V</b> will be interpreted.  As a replacement to option <b>-cwd</b>  please
              use <b>-v</b> <b>PWD</b>.

              Usually  a  task should have the same environment (including the current working directory) as the
              corresponding job, so specifying the option <b>-V</b> should be suitable for most applications.

              <u>Note:</u> If in your system the qmaster tcp port is not configured as a service, but  rather  via  the
              environment variable SGE_QMASTER_PORT, make sure that this variable is set in the environment when
              calling <u>qrsh</u> or <u>qmake</u> with the <b>-inherit</b> option. If you call <u>qrsh</u> or <u>qmake</u> with the <b>-inherit</b> option
              from  within a job script, export SGE_QMASTER_PORT with the option "-v SGE_QMASTER_PORT" either as
              a command argument or an embedded directive.

              This parameter is not available in  the  JSV  context.   (See  <b>-jsv</b>  option  below  or  find  more
              information concerning JSV in <u><a href="../man1/jsv.1.html">jsv</a></u>(1).)

       <b>-j</b> <b>y</b>[<b>es</b>]|<b>n</b>[<b>o</b>]
              Available for <u>qsub</u>, <u>qsh</u>, <u>qrsh</u>, <u>qlogin</u> and <u>qalter</u> only.

              Specifies  whether  or not the standard error stream of the job is merged into the standard output
              stream.
              If both the <b>-j</b> <b>y</b> and the <b>-e</b> options are present, Grid Engine sets,  but  ignores,  the  error-path
              attribute.

              <u>Qalter</u>  allows  changing this option even while the job executes. The modified parameter will only
              be in effect after a restart or migration of the job, however.

              The value specified with this option or the corresponding value specified in  <u>qmon</u>  will  only  be
              passed  to  defined  JSV  instances if the value is <b>yes</b>.  The name of the parameter will be <b>j</b>. The
              value will be <b>y</b> also when the long form <b>yes</b> was specified during  submission.   (See  <b>-jsv</b>  option
              below or find more information concerning JSV in <u><a href="../man1/jsv.1.html">jsv</a></u>(1).)

       <b>-js</b> <u>job_share</u>
              Available for <u>qsub</u>, <u>qsh</u>, <u>qrsh</u>, <u>qlogin</u> and <u>qalter</u> only.

              Defines  or  redefines  the job share of the job relative to other jobs.  Job share is an unsigned
              integer value.  The default job share value for jobs is 0.

              The job share influences the Share Tree Policy and the Functional Policy. It has no effect on  the
              Urgency  and  Override  Policies  (see <u><a href="../man5/share_tree.5.html">share_tree</a></u>(5), <u><a href="../man5/sched_conf.5.html">sched_conf</a></u>(5) for further information on the
              resource management policies supported by Grid Engine).

              In case of the Share Tree Policy, users can distribute the tickets to  which  they  are  currently
              entitled  among  their jobs using different shares assigned via <b>-js</b>. If all jobs have the same job
              share value, the tickets are distributed evenly. Otherwise, jobs receive tickets relative  to  the
              different  job  shares.  Job  shares are treated like an additional level in the share tree in the
              latter case.

              In connection with the Functional Policy, the job share can be used  to  weight  jobs  within  the
              functional  job  category.   Tickets are distributed relative to any uneven job share distribution
              treated as a virtual share distribution level underneath the functional job category.

              If both the Share Tree and the Functional Policy are active, the job shares will have an effect in
              both policies, and the tickets independently derived in each of them are added to the total number
              of tickets for each job.

              If this option or a corresponding value in <u>qmon</u> is specified then this value  will  be  passed  to
              defined  JSV  instances  as  parameter  with  the  name  <b>js</b>.   (See <b>-jsv</b> option below or find more
              information concerning JSV in <u><a href="../man1/jsv.1.html">jsv</a></u>(1).)

       <b>-jsv</b> <u>jsv_url</u>
              Available for <u>qsub</u>, <u>qsh</u>, <u>qrsh</u> and <u>qlogin</u> only.

              Defines a client JSV instance which will be executed to verify the job  specification  before  the
              job is sent to qmaster.

              In contrast to other options this switch will not be overwritten if it is also used in sge_request
              files. Instead all specified JSV instances will be executed to verify the job to be submitted.

              The  JSV  instance which is directly passed with the command line of a client is executed first to
              verify the job specification. After that the JSV instance which might have been defined in various
              sge_request files will be triggered to check the job. Find more details in  man  page  <u><a href="../man1/jsv.1.html">jsv</a></u>(1)  and
              <u><a href="../man5/sge_request.5.html">sge_request</a></u>(5).

              The syntax of the <b>jsv_url</b> is specified in <u><a href="../man5/sge_types.5.html">sge_types</a></u>(5).

       <b>-l</b> <u>resource</u><b>=</b><u>expression</u><b>,</b>...
              Available for <u>qsub</u>, <u>qsh</u>, <u>qrsh</u>, <u>qlogin</u> and <u>qalter</u> only.

              Launch  the job in a Grid Engine queue meeting the given resource request list.  In case of <u>qalter</u>
              the previous definition is replaced by the specified one.

              <u><a href="../man5/complex.5.html">complex</a></u>(5) describes how a list of available resources and their associated valid value specifiers
              can be obtained, and section "MATCHING TYPES" in <u><a href="../man5/sge_types.5.html">sge_types</a></u>(5) describes the possible forms of  the
              expression for the requested resources.

              There  may  be multiple <b>-l</b> switches in a single command. You may request multiple <b>-l</b> options to be
              soft or hard both in the same command line. In case of a serial job multiple  <b>-l</b>  switches  refine
              the definition for the sought queue.

              <u>Qalter</u>  allows  changing  the  value  of this option even while the job is running, but only if no
              change is made to requests for resources marked as consumable.  However the modification will only
              be effective after a restart or migration of the job.

              If this option or a corresponding value in <u>qmon</u> is specified the  these  hard  and  soft  resource
              requirements  will  be  passed  to  defined  JSV  instances as parameter with the names <b>l_hard</b> and
              <b>l_soft</b>. If regular expressions will be used for resource requests, then these expressions will  be
              passed as they are. Also shortcut names will not be expanded.  (See <b>-jsv</b> option above or find more
              information concerning JSV in <u><a href="../man1/jsv.1.html">jsv</a></u>(1).)

       <b>-m</b> <b>b</b>|<b>e</b>|<b>a</b>|<b>s</b>|<b>n,</b>...
              Available for <u>qsub</u>, <u>qsh</u>, <u>qrsh</u>, <u>qlogin</u> and <u>qalter</u> only.

              Defines or redefines under which circumstances mail is to be sent to the job owner or to the users
              defined with the <b>-M</b> option described below. The option arguments have the following meaning:

              `b'     Mail is sent at the beginning of the job.
              `e'     Mail is sent at the end of the job.
              `a'     Mail is sent when the job is aborted or
                      rescheduled.
              `s'     Mail is sent when the job is suspended.
              `n'     No mail is sent.

              Currently no mail is sent when a job is suspended.

              <u>Qalter</u>  allows  changing  the  "b", "e", and "a" option arguments even while the job executes. The
              modification of the option arguments will only be in effect after a restart or  migration  of  the
              job, however.

              If  this  option  or  a corresponding value in <u>qmon</u> is specified then this value will be passed to
              defined JSV instances as parameter with  the  name  <b>m</b>.   (See  <b>-jsv</b>  option  above  or  find  more
              information concerning JSV in

       <b>-M</b> <u>user</u>[<b>@</b><u>host</u>]<b>,</b>...
              Available for <u>qsub</u>, <u>qsh</u>, <u>qrsh</u>, <u>qlogin</u> and <u>qalter</u> only.

              Defines or redefines the list of users to which the server that executes the job has to send mail,
              if the server sends mail about the job.  Default is the job owner at the originating host.

              <u>Qalter</u>  allows  changing this option even while the job executes. The modification will only be in
              effect after a restart or migration of the job, however.

              If this option or a corresponding value in <u>qmon</u> is specified then this value  will  be  passed  to
              defined  JSV  instances  as  parameter  with  the  name  <b>M</b>.   (See  <b>-jsv</b> option above or find more
              information concerning JSV in <u><a href="../man1/jsv.1.html">jsv</a></u>(1).)

       <b>-masterq</b> <u>wc_queue_list</u>
              Available for <u>qsub</u>, <u>qrsh</u>, <u>qsh</u>, <u>qlogin</u>  and  <u>qalter</u>.   Only  meaningful  for  parallel  jobs,  i.e.
              together with the -pe option.

              Defines or redefines a list of cluster queues, queue domains and queue instances which may be used
              to  become  the  so  called  <u>master</u>  <u>queue</u>  of  this  parallel job. A more detailed description of
              <u>wc_queue_list</u> can be found in <u><a href="../man5/sge_types.5.html">sge_types</a></u>(5).  The <u>master</u> <u>queue</u> is defined as the  queue  where  the
              parallel  job is started. The other queues to which the parallel job spawns tasks are called <u>slave</u>
              <u>queues</u>.  A parallel job only has one <u>master</u> <u>queue</u>.

              This parameter has all the properties of a resource request and will be merged  with  requirements
              derived from the <b>-l</b> option described above.

              <u>Qalter</u>  allows  changing this option even while the job executes. The modified parameter will only
              be in effect after a restart or migration of the job, however.

              If this option, or a corresponding value in <u>qmon</u>, is specified,  this  hard  resource  requirement
              will  be  passed  to defined JSV instances as a parameter with the name <b>masterq</b>.  (See <b>-jsv</b> option
              above or find more information concerning JSV in <u><a href="../man1/jsv.1.html">jsv</a></u>(1).)

       <b>-notify</b>
              Available for <u>qsub</u>, <u>qrsh</u> (with command) and <u>qalter</u> only.

              This flag, when set, causes Grid Engine to send "warning"  signals  to  a  running  job  prior  to
              sending  the  signals  themselves. If a SIGSTOP is pending, the job will receive a SIGUSR1 several
              seconds before the SIGSTOP. If a SIGKILL is pending,  the  job  will  receive  a  SIGUSR2  several
              seconds before the SIGKILL.  This option provides the running job a configured time interval to do
              cleanup  operations  before  receiving  the  SIGSTOP  or  SIGKILL.   The  amount  of time delay is
              controlled by the <b>notify</b> parameter in each queue configuration (see <u><a href="../man5/queue_conf.5.html">queue_conf</a></u>(5)).

              <u>Qalter</u> allows changing this option even while the job executes.

              Only if this option is used the parameter named <b>notify</b> with the value <b>y</b> will be passed to  defined
              JSV instances.  (See <b>-jsv</b> option above or find more information concerning JSV in <u><a href="../man1/jsv.1.html">jsv</a></u>(1).)

       <b>-now</b> <b>y</b>[<b>es</b>]|<b>n</b>[<b>o</b>]
              Available for <u>qsub</u>, <u>qsh</u>, <u>qlogin</u> and <u>qrsh</u>.

              <b>-now</b> <b>y</b> tries to start the job immediately or not at all. The command returns 0 on success, or 1 on
              failure  (also  if the job could not be scheduled immediately).  For array jobs submitted with the
              <b>-now</b> option, if all tasks cannot be immediately scheduled, no tasks are scheduled.

              Jobs submitted with <b>-now</b> <b>y</b> option, can <u>only</u> run on INTERACTIVE queues.  <b>-now</b> <b>y</b> is default for <u>qsh</u>,
              <u>qlogin</u> and <u>qrsh</u>

              With the <b>-now</b> <b>n</b> option, the job will be put into the  pending  queue  if  it  cannot  be  executed
              immediately. <b>-now</b> <b>n</b> is default for <u>qsub</u>.

       <b>-N</b> <b>name</b>
              Available for <u>qsub</u>, <u>qsh</u>, <u>qrsh</u>, <u>qlogin</u> and <u>qalter</u> only.

              The  name  of  the job. The name should follow the "<b>name</b>" definition in <u><a href="../man5/sge_types.5.html">sge_types</a></u>(5).  Invalid job
              names will be denied at submit time.

              If the <b>-N</b> option is not present, Grid Engine assigns the name of the job script to the  job  after
              any  directory pathname has been removed from the script name. If the script is read from standard
              input, the job name defaults to STDIN.

              In the case of <u>qsh</u> or <u>qlogin</u> with the <b>-N</b> option is absent,  the  name  "INTERACTIVE"  or  "QLOGIN"
              respectively is assigned to the job.

              In the case of <u>qrsh</u> if the <b>-N</b> option is absent, the resulting job name is determined from the qrsh
              command  line by using the argument string up to the first occurrence of a semicolon or whitespace
              and removing the directory pathname.  With no command, "QRLOGIN" is used.

              <u>Qalter</u> allows changing this option even while the job executes.

              The value specified with this option or the corresponding value specified in <u>qmon</u> will  be  passed
              to  defined  JSV  instances  as  parameter  with  the name <b>N</b>.  (See <b>-jsv</b> option above or find more
              information concerning JSV in <u><a href="../man1/jsv.1.html">jsv</a></u>(1).)

       <b>-noshell</b>
              Available only for <u>qrsh</u> with a command line.

              Do not start the command line given to <u>qrsh</u> in the user's login shell, i.e.   execute  it  without
              the wrapping shell.

              This  option  can  be  used  to  speed  up  execution as some overhead, like the shell startup and
              sourcing the shell resource files, is avoided.

              This option can only be used if no shell-specific command line parsing is required. If the command
              line contains shell syntax like environment variable substitution or (back) quoting, a shell  must
              be  started.  In this case, either do not use the <b>-noshell</b> option or include the shell call in the
              command line.

              Example:
              qrsh echo '$HOSTNAME'
              Alternative call with the <b>-noshell</b> option
              qrsh -noshell /bin/tcsh -f -c 'echo $HOSTNAME'

       <b>-nostdin</b>
              Available only for <u>qrsh</u>.

              Suppress the input stream STDIN - <u>qrsh</u> will pass the option <b>-n</b> to  the  <u><a href="../man1/rsh.1.html">rsh</a></u>(1)  command.  This  is
              especially  useful,  if  multiple  tasks  are  executed  in parallel using <u>qrsh</u>, e.g. in a <u><a href="../man1/make.1.html">make</a></u>(1)
              process it would be undefined which process would get the input.

       <b>-o</b> [[<u>hostname</u>]<b>:</b>]<u>path</u><b>,</b>...
              Available for <u>qsub</u> and <u>qalter</u> only, but currently silently ignored by <u>qsh</u>, <u>qrsh</u>, and <u>qlogin</u>.

              Specify the path used for the standard output stream of the job.  <u>path</u> is handled as described  in
              the <b>-e</b> option for the standard error stream.

              By   default   the   file   name   for   standard   output   has  the  form  <u>job_name</u><b>.o</b><u>job_id</u>,  or
              <u>job_name</u><b>.o</b><u>job_id</u><b>.</b><u>task_id</u> for array job tasks (see <b>-t</b> option below).

              <u>Qalter</u> allows changing this option even while the job executes. The modified parameter  will  only
              be in effect after a restart or migration of the job, however.

              If  this  option  or  a corresponding value in <u>qmon</u> is specified then this value will be passed to
              defined JSV instances as parameter with  the  name  <b>o</b>.   (See  <b>-jsv</b>  option  above  or  find  more
              information concerning JSV in <u><a href="../man1/jsv.1.html">jsv</a></u>(1).)

       <b>-ot</b> <u>override_tickets</u>
              Available for <u>qalter</u> only.

              Changes  the  number  of  override  tickets  for  the  specified  job.   Requires manager/operator
              privileges.

       <b>-P</b> <u>project_name</u>
              Available for <u>qsub</u>, <u>qsh</u>, <u>qrsh</u>, <u>qlogin</u> and <u>qalter</u> only.

              Specifies the project to which this job is assigned. The administrator needs to give permission to
              individual users to submit jobs to a specific project (see <b>-aprj</b> option to <u><a href="../man1/qconf.1.html">qconf</a></u>(1)).

              If this option or a corresponding value in <u>qmon</u> is specified then this value  will  be  passed  to
              defined  JSV  instances  as  parameter  with  the  name  <b>P</b>.   (See  <b>-jsv</b> option above or find more

       <b>-p</b> <u>priority</u>
              Available for <u>qsub</u>, <u>qsh</u>, <u>qrsh</u>, <u>qlogin</u> and <u>qalter</u> only.

              Defines or redefines the priority of the job relative to other jobs.  <u>priority</u> is  an  integer  in
              the range -1023 to 1024.  The default priority value for jobs is 0.

              Users  may  only decrease the priority of their jobs.  Grid Engine managers and administrators may
              also increase the priority associated with jobs. If a pending  job  has  higher  priority,  it  is
              eligible for being dispatched earlier by the Grid Engine scheduler.

              If  this  option or a corresponding value in <u>qmon</u> is specified and the priority is not 0 then this
              value will be passed to defined JSV instances as parameter with the  name  <b>p</b>.   (See  <b>-jsv</b>  option

              Available for <u>qsub</u>, <u>qsh</u>, <u>qrsh</u>, <u>qlogin</u> and <u>qalter</u> only.

              Parallel  programming  environment  (PE)  to  instantiate.  For  more detail about PEs, please see
              <b>parallel_env</b> in <u><a href="../man5/sge_types.5.html">sge_types</a></u>(5).

              <u>Qalter</u> allows changing this option even while the job executes. The modified parameter  will  only
              be in effect after a restart or migration of the job, however.

              If  this  option or a corresponding value in <u>qmon</u> is specified then the parameters <b>pe_name</b>, <b>pe_min</b>
              and <b>pe_max</b> will be passed to configured JSV instances where  <b>pe_name</b>  will  be  the  name  of  the
              parallel environment and the values <b>pe_min</b> and <b>pe_max</b> represent the values <u>n</u> and <u>m</u> which have been
              provided  with  the <b>-pe</b> option.  A missing specification of <u>m</u> will be expanded as value 9999999 in

       <b>-pty</b> <b>y</b>[<b>es</b>]|<b>n</b>[<b>o</b>]
              Available for <u>qrsh</u>, <u>qsub</u> and <u>qlogin</u> only, and normally only effective for  interactive  jobs  with
              the <b>builtin</b> remote startup method (see <u><a href="../man5/remote_startup.5.html">remote_startup</a></u>(5)).

              <b>-pty</b> <b>yes</b>  starts  the job in a pseudo terminal (pty). If no pty is available, the job start fails.
              <b>-pty</b> <b>no</b> starts the job without a pty.  By default, <u>qrsh</u> <u>without</u> <u>a</u> <u>command</u> and <u>qlogin</u> start the job
              in a pty, and <u>qrsh</u> or <u>qsub</u> with a command starts the job without a pty.

              This parameter is not available in  the  JSV  context.   (See  <b>-jsv</b>  option  above  or  find  more
              information concerning JSV in <u><a href="../man1/jsv.1.html">jsv</a></u>(1).)

       <b>-q</b> <u>wc_queue_list</u>
              Available for <u>qsub</u>, <u>qrsh</u>, <u>qsh</u>, <u>qlogin</u> and <u>qalter</u>.

              Defines  or redefines a list of cluster queues, queue domains or queue instances which may be used
              to execute this job. Please find a description of <u>wc_queue_list</u> in <u><a href="../man5/sge_types.5.html">sge_types</a></u>(5).   This  parameter
              has all the properties of a resource request and will be merged with requirements derived from the
              <b>-l</b> option described above.

              <u>Qalter</u>  allows  changing this option even while the job executes. The modified parameter will only
              be in effect after a restart or migration of the job, however.

              If this option or a corresponding value in <u>qmon</u> is specified then these  hard  and  soft  resource
              requirements  will  be  passed  to  defined  JSV instances as parameters with the names <b>q_hard</b> and
              <b>q_soft</b>. If regular expressions will be used for resource requests, then these expressions will  be
              passed as they are. Also shortcut names will not be expanded.  (See <b>-jsv</b> option above or find more
              information concerning JSV in <u><a href="../man1/jsv.1.html">jsv</a></u>(1).)

       <b>-R</b> <b>y</b>[<b>es</b>]|<b>n</b>[<b>o</b>]
              Available for <u>qsub</u>, <u>qrsh</u>, <u>qsh</u>, <u>qlogin</u> and <u>qalter</u>.

              Indicates  whether  a  reservation  for  this  job  should  be done. Reservation is never done for
              immediate jobs, i.e. jobs submitted using the <b>-now</b> <b>yes</b> option.  Please note that regardless of the
              reservation request, job reservation might be disabled using <b>max_reservation</b> in <u><a href="../man5/sched_conf.5.html">sched_conf</a></u>(5), and
              is limited to that number of the highest priority jobs.

              By default jobs are submitted with <b>-R</b> <b>n</b>.

              The value specified with this option or the corresponding value specified in  <u>qmon</u>  will  only  be
              passed  to  defined  JSV  instances if the value is <u>yes</u>.  The name of the parameter will be <b>R</b>. The
              value will be <b>y</b> also when the long form <b>yes</b> was specified during  submission.   (See  <b>-jsv</b>  option
              above or find more information concerning JSV in <u><a href="../man1/jsv.1.html">jsv</a></u>(1).)

       <b>-r</b> <b>y</b>[<b>es</b>]|<b>n</b>[<b>o</b>]
              Available for <u>qsub</u> and <u>qalter</u> only.

              Specifies  whether  a job can be rerun or not.  If the value of <b>-r</b> is 'yes', the job will be rerun
              if it gets aborted without leaving a consistent exit state.  (This is typically the  case  if  the
              node on which the job is running crashes).  If <b>-r</b> is 'no' (the default), the job will not be rerun
              under  such  circumstances.   It  will  still  be  rerun  if  it finishes with exit code 99 unless
              <b>FORBID_RESCHEDULE</b> is set in <b>qmaster_params</b> in <u><a href="../man5/sge_conf.5.html">sge_conf</a></u>(5).

              Interactive jobs submitted with <u>qsh</u>, <u>qrsh</u>, or <u>qlogin</u> are not rerunnable.

              <u>Qalter</u> allows changing this option even while the job executes.

              The value specified with this option or the corresponding value specified in  <u>qmon</u>  will  only  be
              passed  to  defined  JSV  instances if the value is <u>yes</u>.  The name of the parameter will be <b>r</b>. The
              value will be <b>y</b> also when the long form <b>yes</b> was specified during  submission.   (See  <b>-jsv</b>  option
              above or find more information concerning JSV in <u><a href="../man1/jsv.1.html">jsv</a></u>(1).)

       <b>-sc</b> <u>variable</u>[<b>=</b><u>value</u>]<b>,</b>...
              Available for <u>qsub</u>, <u>qsh</u>, <u>qrsh</u>, <u>qlogin</u> and <u>qalter</u> only.

              Sets  the  given name/value pairs as the job's context. <u>value</u> may be omitted. Grid Engine replaces
              the job's previously defined context with the one given as the argument.  Multiple <b>-ac</b>,  <b>-dc</b>,  and
              <b>-sc</b> options may be given.  The order is important.

              Contexts  provide  a  way to dynamically attach and remove meta-information to and from a job. The
              context variables are <b>not</b> passed to the job's  execution  context  in  its  environment,  but  are
              available in its spool area.

              <u>Qalter</u> allows changing this option even while the job executes.

              The  outcome of the evaluation of all <b>-ac</b>, <b>-dc</b>, and <b>-sc</b> options or corresponding values in <u>qmon</u> is
              passed to defined JSV instances as parameter with the name <b>ac</b>.  (See <b>-jsv</b>  option  above  or  find
              more information concerning JSV in <u><a href="../man1/jsv.1.html">jsv</a></u>(1).)

       <b>-shell</b> <b>y</b>[<b>es</b>]|<b>n</b>[<b>o</b>]
              Available only for <u>qsub</u>.

              <b>-shell</b>  <b>n</b>  causes  qsub  to execute the command line directly, as if by <u><a href="../man2/exec.2.html">exec</a></u>(2).  No command shell
              will be executed for the job.  This option only applies when <b>-b</b> <b>y</b> is also  used.   Without  <b>-b</b>  <b>y</b>,
              <b>-shell</b> <b>n</b> has no effect.

              This  option  can  be  used  to  speed  up execution, as some overhead, like the shell startup and
              sourcing the shell resource files, is avoided.

              This option can only be used if no shell-specific command line parsing is required. If the command
              line contains shell syntax, like environment variable substitution or (back) quoting, a shell must
              be started.  In this case either do not use the <b>-shell</b> <b>n</b>  option  or  execute  the  shell  as  the
              command line and pass the path to the executable as a parameter.

              If  a  job executed with the <b>-shell</b> <b>n</b> option fails due to a user error, such as an invalid path to
              the executable, the job will enter the error state.

              <b>-shell</b> <b>y</b> cancels the effect of a previous <b>-shell</b> <b>n</b>.  Otherwise, it has no effect.

              See <b>-b</b> and <b>-noshell</b> for more information.

              The value specified with this option or the corresponding value specified in  <u>qmon</u>  will  only  be
              passed to defined JSV instances if the value is <u>yes</u>.  The name of the parameter will be <b>shell</b>. The
              value  will  be  <b>y</b>  also when the long form <b>yes</b> was specified during submission.  (See <b>-jsv</b> option
              above or find more information concerning JSV in <u><a href="../man1/jsv.1.html">jsv</a></u>(1).)

       <b>-soft</b>  Available for <u>qsub</u>, <u>qsh</u>, <u>qrsh</u>, <u>qlogin</u> and <u>qalter</u> only.

              Signifies that all resource requirements following in the command line will be  soft  requirements
              and are to be filled on an "as available" basis.
              As  Grid  Engine scans the command line and script file for Grid Engine options and parameters, it
              builds a list of resources required by the job. All such resource requests are normally considered
              as absolutely essential for the job to commence. However,  if  the  <b>-soft</b>  option  is  encountered
              during  the scan then all following resources are designated as "soft requirements" for execution,
              or "nice-to-have, but not essential". If the <b>-hard</b> flag (see above)  is  encountered  at  a  later
              stage  of  the scan, all resource requests following it once again become essential. The <b>-hard</b> and
              <b>-soft</b> options in effect act  as  toggles  during  the  scan.   However,  requests  for  consumable
              resources cannot be soft.

              If  this  option  or  a  corresponding value in <u>qmon</u> is specified then the corresponding <b>-q</b> and <b>-l</b>
              resource requirements will be passed to defined JSV instances as parameter with the  names  <b>q_soft</b>
              and  <b>l_soft</b>. Find for information in the sections describing <b>-q</b> and <b>-l</b>.  (See <b>-jsv</b> option above or

       <b>-sync</b> <b>y</b>[<b>es</b>]|<b>n</b>[<b>o</b>]
              Available for <u>qsub</u>.

              <b>-sync</b> <b>y</b> causes <u>qsub</u> to wait for the  job  to  complete  before  exiting.   If  the  job  completes
              successfully,  <u>qsub</u>'s  exit  code will be that of the completed job.  If the job fails to complete
              successfully, <u>qsub</u> will print an error message to the standard error stream indicating why the job
              failed, and will have an exit code of 1.  If <u>qsub</u> is interrupted, e.g. with CTRL-C, before the job
              completes, the job will be canceled.
              With the <b>-sync</b> <b>n</b> option, <u>qsub</u> will exit with an exit code of 0 as soon as  the  job  is  submitted
              successfully.  <b>-sync</b> <b>n</b> is default for <u>qsub</u>.
              If  <b>-sync</b>  <b>y</b> is used in conjunction with <b>-now</b> <b>y</b>, <u>qsub</u> will behave as though only <b>-now</b> <b>y</b> were given
              until the job has been successfully scheduled, after which time <u>qsub</u> will behave  as  though  only
              <b>-sync</b> <b>y</b> were given.
              If  <b>-sync</b>  <b>y</b>  is  used  in conjunction with <b>-t</b>, <u>qsub</u> will wait for all the job's tasks to complete
              before exiting.  If all the job's tasks complete successfully, <u>qsub</u>'s exit code will  be  that  of
              the  first completed job task with a non-zero exit code, or 0 if all job tasks exited with an exit
              code of 0.  If any of the job's tasks fail to complete successfully,  <u>qsub</u>  will  print  an  error
              message  to the standard error stream indicating why the job task(s) failed, and will have an exit
              code of 1.  If <u>qsub</u> is interrupted, e.g. with CTRL-C, before the job completes, all of  the  job's
              tasks will be canceled.

              Information  that this switch was specified during submission is not available in the JSV context.
              (See <b>-jsv</b> option above or find more information concerning JSV in <u><a href="../man1/jsv.1.html">jsv</a></u>(1).)

       <b>-S</b> [[<u>hostname</u>]<b>:</b>]<u>pathname</u><b>,</b>...
              Available for <u>qsub</u>, <u>qsh</u> and <u>qalter</u>.

              Specifies the interpreting shell  for  the  job.   <u>pathname</u>  must  be  an  executable  file  which
              interprets command-line options <b>-c</b> and <b>-s</b> as <b><a href="file:/bin/sh">/bin/sh</a></b> does.

              Only  one  <u>pathname</u> component without a <u>host</u> specifier is valid and only one path name for a given
              host is allowed. Shell paths with host assignments define the interpreting shell for  the  job  if
              the host is the execution host. The shell path without host specification is used if the execution
              host matches none of the hosts in the list.

              Furthermore,  the  pathname  can be constructed with pseudo environment variables as described for
              the <b>-e</b> option above.

              In the case of <u>qsh</u> the  specified  shell  path  is  used  to  execute  the  corresponding  command
              interpreter  in the <u><a href="../man1/xterm.1.html">xterm</a></u>(1) (via its <u>-e</u> option) started on behalf of the interactive job.  <u>Qalter</u>
              allows changing this option even while the job executes. The modified parameter will  only  be  in
              effect after a restart or migration of the job, however.

              If  this  option  or  a corresponding value in <u>qmon</u> is specified then this value will be passed to
              defined JSV instances as parameter with  the  name  <b>S</b>.   (See  <b>-jsv</b>  option  above  or  find  more
              information concerning JSV in <u><a href="../man1/jsv.1.html">jsv</a></u>(1).)

       <b>-t</b> <u>n</u>[<b>-</b><u>m</u>[<b>:</b><u>s</u>]]
              Available for <u>qsub</u> only.

              Submits  a  so  called <u>Array</u> <u>Job</u>, i.e. an array of identical tasks being differentiated only by an
              index number and being treated by Grid Engine almost like a series of jobs.  The  argument  of  <b>-t</b>
              specifies  the  number  of  array job tasks and the index number which will be associated with the
              tasks in terms of the range's start (<u>n</u>), default 1, its end (<u>m</u>), and stride (s), default  1.   The
              index  numbers  will  be  exported  to the job tasks via the environment variable <b>SGE_TASK_ID</b>. The
              arguments <u>n</u>, <u>m</u>, and  <u>s</u>  will  be  available  through  the  environment  variables  <b>SGE_TASK_FIRST</b>,
              <b>SGE_TASK_LAST</b> and  <b>SGE_TASK_STEPSIZE</b>.

              The following restrictions apply to the values <u>n</u> and <u>m</u>:

              1 &lt;= <u>n</u> &lt;= MIN(2^31-1, <u>max_aj_tasks</u>)
              1 &lt;= <u>m</u> &lt;= MIN(2^31-1, <u>max_aj_tasks</u>)
              <u>n</u> &lt;= <u>m</u>

              <u>max_aj_tasks</u> is defined in the cluster configuration (see <u><a href="../man5/sge_conf.5.html">sge_conf</a></u>(5)).

              The  task  id range specified in the option argument may be a single number, a simple range of the
              form <u>n</u><b>-</b><u>m</u> or a range with a step size. Hence, the task id range specified by 2-10:2 would result in
              the task id indexes 2, 4, 6, 8, and  10,  for  a  total  of  5  identical  tasks,  each  with  the
              environment variable SGE_TASK_ID containing one of the 5 index numbers.

              All  array  job tasks inherit the same resource requests and attribute definitions as specified in
              the <u>qsub</u> or <u>qalter</u> command line, except for the <b>-t</b> option. The tasks are  scheduled  independently
              and,  provided  enough  resources  exist, concurrently, very much like separate jobs.  However, an
              array job or a sub-array there of can be accessed as a single unit by  commands  like  <u><a href="../man1/qmod.1.html">qmod</a></u>(1)  or
              <u><a href="../man1/qdel.1.html">qdel</a></u>(1).  See the corresponding manual pages for further detail.

              Array  jobs  are  commonly  used  to execute the same type of operation on varying input data sets
              correlated with the task index number. The number of tasks in an array job is unlimited.

              STDOUT and STDERR of array job tasks will  be  written  into  different  files  with  the  default
              location

              <u>jobname</u><b>.</b>[<b>e</b>|<b>o</b>]<u>job_id</u><b>.</b><u>task_id</u>

              In  order  to change this default, the <b>-e</b> and <b>-o</b> options (see above) can be used together with the
              pseudo environment variables $HOME, $USER, $JOB_ID, $JOB_NAME, $HOSTNAME, and $TASK_ID.

              Note, that you can use the output redirection to divert the output of  all  tasks  into  the  same
              file, but the result of this is undefined.

              If  this  option  or  a corresponding value in <u>qmon</u> is specified then this value will be passed to
              defined JSV instances as parameters with the names <b>t_min</b>, <b>t_max</b> and <b>t_step</b> (See <b>-jsv</b> option  above
              or find more information concerning JSV in <u><a href="../man1/jsv.1.html">jsv</a></u>(1).)

       <b>-tc</b> <u>max_running_tasks</u>
              Available for <u>qsub</u> and <u>qalter</u> only.

              Used  in  conjunction  with  array jobs (see -t option) to set a self-imposed limit on the maximum
              number of concurrently running tasks per job.

              If this option, or a corresponding value in <u>qmon</u> is specified, then this value will be  passed  to
              defined  JSV  instances  as  a parameter with the name <b>tc</b>. (See the <b>-jsv</b> option above or find more
              information concerning JSV in <u><a href="../man1/jsv.1.html">jsv</a></u>(1).)

       <b>-terse</b> Available for <u>qsub</u> only.

              Causes <u>qsub</u> to display only the job-id of the job being submitted rather than  the  regular  "Your
              job ..." string.  In case of an error the error is reported on stderr as usual.
              This can be helpful for scripts which need to parse <u>qsub</u> output to get the job-id.

              Information  that this switch was specified during submission is not available in the JSV context.
              (See <b>-jsv</b> option above or find more information concerning JSV in <u><a href="../man1/jsv.1.html">jsv</a></u>(1).)

       <b>-u</b> <u>username</u><b>,</b>...
              Available for <u>qalter</u> only. Changes are only made on those  jobs  which  were  submitted  by  users
              specified  in the list of usernames.  For managers it is possible to use the <b>qalter</b> <b>-u</b> <b>'*'</b> command
              to modify all jobs of all users.

              If you use the <b>-u</b> switch it is not permitted to specify an additional <u>wc_job_range_list</u>.

       <b>-v</b> <u>variable</u>[<b>=</b><u>value</u>]<b>,</b>...
              Available for <u>qsub</u>, <u>qrsh</u> (with command argument) and <u>qalter</u>.

              Defines or redefines the environment variables to be exported to the execution context of the job.
              If the <b>-v</b> option is present Grid Engine will add the environment variables defined as arguments to
              the switch and, optionally, values of specified variables, to the execution context of the job.

              <u>Qalter</u> allows changing this option even while the job executes. The modified parameter  will  only
              be in effect after a restart or migration of the job, however.

              All  environment  variables  specified  with <b>-v</b>, <b>-V</b> or the DISPLAY variable provided with <b>-display</b>
              will be exported to the defined JSV instances only optionally when this  is  requested  explicitly
              during  the  job  submission  verification.   (See  <b>-jsv</b>  option  above  or  find more information
              concerning JSV in <u><a href="../man1/jsv.1.html">jsv</a></u>(1).)

       <b>-verbose</b>
              Available only for <u>qrsh</u> and <u><a href="../man1/qmake.1.html">qmake</a></u>(1).

              Unlike <u>qsh</u> and <u>qlogin</u>, <u>qrsh</u> does not output any  informational  messages  while  establishing  the
              session, compliant with the standard <u><a href="../man1/rsh.1.html">rsh</a></u>(1) and <u><a href="../man1/rlogin.1.html">rlogin</a></u>(1) system calls.  If the option <b>-verbose</b> is
              set,  <u>qrsh</u>  behaves  like  the  <u>qsh</u> and <u>qlogin</u> commands, printing information about the process of
              establishing the <u><a href="../man1/rsh.1.html">rsh</a></u>(1) or <u><a href="../man1/rlogin.1.html">rlogin</a></u>(1) session.

       <b>-verify</b>
              Available for <u>qsub</u>, <u>qsh</u>, <u>qrsh</u>, <u>qlogin</u> and <u>qalter</u>.

              Instead of submitting a job, prints detailed information about the would-be job as though <u><a href="../man1/qstat.1.html">qstat</a></u>(1)
              -j were used, including the effects of command-line parameters and the external environment.

       <b>-V</b>     Available for <u>qsub</u>, <u>qsh</u>, <u>qrsh</u> <u>with</u> <u>command</u> and <u>qalter</u>.

              Specifies that all environment variables active within the <u>qsub</u> utility be exported to the context
              of the job.

              All environment variables specified with <b>-v</b>, <b>-V</b> or the DISPLAY  variable  provided  with  <b>-display</b>
              will  be  exported  to the defined JSV instances only optionally when this is requested explicitly
              during the job  submission  verification.   (See  <b>-jsv</b>  option  above  or  find  more  information
              concerning JSV in <u><a href="../man1/jsv.1.html">jsv</a></u>(1).)

       <b>-w</b> <b>e</b>|<b>w</b>|<b>n</b>|<b>p</b>|<b>v</b>
              Available for <u>qsub</u>, <u>qsh</u>, <u>qrsh</u>, <u>qlogin</u> and <u>qalter</u>.

              Specifies  a  validation  level  applied to the job to be submitted (<u>qsub</u>, <u>qlogin</u>, and <u>qsh</u>) or the
              specified queued job (<u>qalter</u>).

              The specifiers <b>e</b>, <b>w</b>, <b>n</b>, <b>p</b>, and <b>v</b> define the following validation modes:

              <b>e</b>    error - jobs with invalid requests will be rejected.
              <b>w</b>    warning - only a warning will be displayed for invalid
                   requests.
              <b>n</b>    none - switches off validation; the default for <u>qsub</u>,
                   <u>qalter</u>, <u>qrsh</u>, <u>qsh</u> and <u>qlogin</u>.
              <b>p</b>    poke - does not submit the job but prints a validation
                   report based on a cluster as is with all resource
                   utilizations in place.
              <b>v</b>    verify - does not submit the job but prints a validation
                   report based on a dry scheduling run on an empty cluster,
                   ignoring load values.
              Resource requests exceeding the configured maximal thresholds or requests for unavailable resource
              attributes are possible causes for jobs to fail `v' validation.

              Note that the necessary checks are performance consuming and hence the checking is switched off by
              default.  It should also  be  noted  that  load  values  are  not  taken  into  account  with  the
              verification since they are assumed to be too volatile. To cause -w e verification to be passed at
              submission time, it is possible to specify non-volatile values (non-consumables) or maximum values
              (consumables) in complex_values.

              If  this option, or a corresponding value in <u>qmon</u>, is specified, then this value will be passed to
              defined JSV instances as a parameter with the name <b>w</b>. (See the <b>-jsv</b>  option  above  or  find  more
              information concerning JSV in <u><a href="../man1/jsv.1.html">jsv</a></u>(1).)

       <b>-wd</b> <u>working_dir</u>
              Available for <u>qsub</u>, <u>qsh</u>, <u>qrsh</u> and <u>qalter</u> only.

              Execute  the  job  from  the  directory  specified in <u>working_dir</u>.  This switch will activate Grid
              Engine's path aliasing facility,  if  the  corresponding  configuration  files  are  present  (see
              <u><a href="../man5/sge_aliases.5.html">sge_aliases</a></u>(5)).

              <u>Qalter</u>  allows  changing this option even while the job executes. The modified parameter will only
              be in effect after a restart or migration of the  job,  however.   The  parameter  value  will  be
              available in defined JSV instances as parameter with the name <b>cwd</b>.  (See <b>-cwd</b> switch above or find
              more information concerning JSV in <u><a href="../man1/jsv.1.html">jsv</a></u>(1).)

       <u>command</u>
              Available for <u>qsub</u> and <u>qrsh</u> only.

              The  job's  scriptfile or binary.  If not present or if the operand is the single-character string
              '-', <u>qsub</u> reads the script from standard input.

              The command will be available in defined JSV instances as parameter with  the  name  <b>CMDNAME</b>  (See
              <b>-jsv</b> option above or find more information concerning JSV in <u><a href="../man1/jsv.1.html">jsv</a></u>(1).)

       <u>command_args</u>
              Available for <u>qsub</u>, <u>qrsh</u> and <u>qalter</u> only.

              Arguments to the job. Not valid if the script is entered from standard input.

              <u>Qalter</u>  allows  changing this option even while the job executes. The modified parameter will only
              be in effect after a restart or migration of the job, however.

              The number of command arguments is provided to configured JSV instances as parameter with the name
              <b>CMDARGS</b>. Also the argument values can by accessed. Argument names  have  the  format  <b>CMDARG</b><u>number</u>
              where  <u>number</u>  is  a  integer  between  0  and  <b>CMDARGS</b> - 1.   (See <b>-jsv</b> option above or find more
              information concerning JSV in <u><a href="../man1/jsv.1.html">jsv</a></u>(1).)

       <b>xterm_args</b>
              Available for <u>qsh</u> only.

              Arguments to the <u><a href="../man1/xterm.1.html">xterm</a></u>(1) executable, as defined in the  configuration.   For  details,  refer  to
              <u><a href="../man5/sge_conf.5.html">sge_conf</a></u>(5)).

              Information  concerning  <b>xterm_args</b>  will  be available in JSV context as parameters with the name
              <b>CMDARGS</b> and <b>CMDARG</b><u>number</u>. Find more information above in section <u>command_args</u>.  (See  <b>-jsv</b>  option
              above or find more information concerning JSV in <u><a href="../man1/jsv.1.html">jsv</a></u>(1).)

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>SGE_ROOT</b>       Specifies the location of the Grid Engine standard configuration files.

       <b>SGE_CELL</b>       If  set,  specifies the default Grid Engine cell. To address a Grid Engine cell <u>qsub</u>, <u>qsh</u>,
                      <u>qlogin</u> or <u>qalter</u> use the name of the cell specified in the environment  variable  SGE_CELL
                      if that is set, and otherwise the name of the default cell, i.e. <b>default</b>.

       <b>SGE_DEBUG_LEVEL</b>
                      If  set,  specifies  that  debug  information should be written to stderr. In addition the
                      level of detail in which debug information is generated is defined.

       <b>SGE_QMASTER_PORT</b>
                      If set, specifies the  tcp  port  on  which  <u><a href="../man8/sge_qmaster.8.html">sge_qmaster</a></u>(8)  is  expected  to  listen  for
                      communication  requests.  Most installations will use a services map entry for the service
                      "sge_qmaster" instead to define that port.

       <b>DISPLAY</b>        For <u>qsh</u> jobs the DISPLAY has to be specified at job submission.  If the DISPLAY is not set
                      by using the <b>-display</b> or the <b>-v</b> switch, the contents of the DISPLAY  environment  variable
                      are used as default.

       <b>QRSH_WRAPPER</b>   Wrapper for <u>qrsh</u> commands (see above).

       <b>SGE_JSV_TIMEOUT</b>
                      If  the  response  time of the client JSV is greater than this timeout value, then the JSV
                      will attempt to be re-started. The default value is 10 seconds, and  this  value  must  be
                      greater  than  0. If the timeout has been reached, the JSV will only try to re-start once,
                      if the timeout is reached again an error will occur.

       In addition to those environment variables specified to be exported to the job  via  the  <b>-v</b>  or  the  <b>-V</b>
       option  (see  above),  <u>qsub</u>,  <u>qsh</u>, and <u>qlogin</u> add several variables of the form SGE_<u>O_NAME</u> whose value is
       taken from <u>NAME</u> in the submission environment.  For each, a variable with the same value is added to  the
       job  context,  but  with  a  lower-case  version of the name, i.e. xqs_name_sxx_o_home in the job context
       corresponds to xQS_NAME_Sxx_O_HOME in the job environment, and HOME  in  the  submission  environment  as
       follows.  The context variables are displayed by <u><a href="../man1/qstat.1.html">qstat</a></u>(1) with the -j option.

       <b>SGE_O_HOME</b>, <b>SGE_O_HOST</b>, <b>SGE_O_MAIL</b>, <b>SGE_O_PATH</b>, <b>SGE_O_TZ</b>, <b>SGE_O_SHELL</b>, <b>SGE_O_TERM</b>
                      As  in  the  description  of  SGE_<u>O_NAME</u>  above, but the SGE clients use a library call to
                      determine to determine the host name if HOST is not set.  Note that there is no  guarantee
                      that  these  are in any way "correct", e.g. you should not rely on SGE_O_HOST for any sort
                      of access control or auditing;

       <b>SGE_O_LOGNAME</b>  As above, but the corresponding context variable is sge_log_name.

       <b>SGE_O_WORKDIR</b>  The absolute path of the current working directory of the submitting client, reflected  in
                      the context as sge_o_workdir and typically corresponding to the CWD environment variable.

       Grid Engine sets other variables in the job's environment, as follows.

       <b>ARC</b>, <b>SGE_ARCH</b>  The  Grid  Engine  architecture  name of the node on which the job is running. The name is
                      compiled-in into the <u><a href="../man8/sge_execd.8.html">sge_execd</a></u>(8) binary.

       <b>SGE_BINDING</b>    Contains the selected operating system internal processor numbers.  There  might  be  more
                      than the number of selected cores in the presence of SMT or CMT because each core could be
                      represented by multiple processor identifiers.  The processor numbers are space-separated.

       <b>SGE_CKPT_ENV</b>   Specifies  the checkpointing environment (as selected with the <b>-ckpt</b> option) under which a
                      checkpointing job executes. Only set for checkpointing jobs.

       <b>SGE_CKPT_DIR</b>   Only set for checkpointing  jobs.  Contains  path  <u>ckpt_dir</u>  (see  <u><a href="../man5/checkpoint.5.html">checkpoint</a></u>(5))  of  the
                      checkpoint interface.

       <b>SGE_CWD_PATH</b>   Specifies the current working directory where the job was started.

       <b>SGE_STDERR_PATH</b>
                      The  pathname  of  the  file  to  which  the standard error stream of the job is diverted.
                      Commonly used for enhancing the output with error messages from prolog,  epilog,  parallel
                      environment start/stop or checkpointing scripts.

       <b>SGE_STDOUT_PATH</b>
                      The  pathname  of  the  file  to  which the standard output stream of the job is diverted.
                      Commonly used for enhancing  the  output  with  messages  from  prolog,  epilog,  parallel
                      environment start/stop or checkpointing scripts.

       <b>SGE_STDIN_PATH</b> The  pathname  of  the file from which the standard input stream of the job is taken. This
                      variable might be used in combination with SGE_O_HOST in prolog/epilog scripts to transfer
                      the input file from the submit to the execution host.

       <b>SGE_JOB_SPOOL_DIR</b>
                      The directory used by <u><a href="../man8/sge_shepherd.8.html">sge_shepherd</a></u>(8) to store job related data during job execution. This
                      directory is owned by root or by a Grid Engine administrative account.

       <b>SGE_TASK_ID</b>    The index number of the current array job task (see <b>-t</b> option above).  This  is  a  unique
                      number  in  each  array job and can be used to reference different input data records, for
                      example. This environment variable is  set  to  "undefined"  for  non-array  jobs.  It  is
                      possible  to  change  the  predefined  value  of  this variable with <b>-v</b> or <b>-V</b> (see options
                      above).

       <b>SGE_TASK_FIRST</b> The index number of the first array job task (see <b>-t</b> option  above).  It  is  possible  to
                      change the predefined value of this variable with <b>-v</b> or <b>-V</b> (see options above).

       <b>SGE_TASK_LAST</b>  The  index  number  of  the  last  array job task (see <b>-t</b> option above). It is possible to
                      change the predefined value of this variable with <b>-v</b> or <b>-V</b> (see options above).

       <b>SGE_TASK_STEPSIZE</b>
                      The step size of the array job specification (see <b>-t</b> option  above).  It  is  possible  to
                      change the predefined value of this variable with <b>-v</b> or <b>-V</b> (see options above).

       <b>ENVIRONMENT</b>    The  ENVIRONMENT variable is set to BATCH to identify that the job is being executed under
                      Grid Engine control.

       <b>HOME</b>           The user's home directory path from the <u><a href="../man5/passwd.5.html">passwd</a></u>(5) database.

       <b>HOSTNAME</b>       The hostname of the node on which the job is running.

       <b>JOB_ID</b>         A unique identifier assigned by the <u><a href="../man8/sge_qmaster.8.html">sge_qmaster</a></u>(8) when the job was submitted. The job  ID
                      is a decimal integer in the range 1 to 99999.

       <b>JOB_NAME</b>       The  job  name.   For batch jobs or jobs submitted by <u>qrsh</u> with a command, the job name is
                      the basename of the <u>qsub</u> script/binary filename or the <u>qrsh</u> command.  For interactive jobs
                      it is set to "INTERACTIVE" for <u>qsh</u> jobs, "QLOGIN" for <u>qlogin</u> jobs and "QRLOGIN"  for  <u>qrsh</u>
                      jobs without a command.

                      This default may be overwritten by the <b>-N</b> option.

       <b>JOB_SCRIPT</b>     The  path  to the job script which is executed. The value can not be overwritten by the <b>-v</b>
                      or <b>-V</b> option.

       <b>LOGNAME</b>        The user's login name from the passwd database.

       <b>NHOSTS</b>         The number of hosts in use by a parallel job.

       <b>NQUEUES</b>        The number of queues allocated for the job (always 1 for serial jobs).

       <b>NSLOTS</b>         The number of queue slots in use by a parallel job.

       <b>PATH</b>           A default shell search path of:
                      <a href="file:/usr/local/bin">/usr/local/bin</a>:/usr/ucb:<a href="file:/bin">/bin</a>:<a href="file:/usr/bin">/usr/bin</a>

       <b>SGE_BINARY_PATH</b>
                      The path where the Grid Engine binaries are installed. The value is the  concatenation  of
                      the   cluster   configuration  value  <b>binary_path</b>  and  the  architecture  name  <b>$SGE_ARCH</b>
                      environment variable.

       <b>PE</b>             The parallel environment under which the job executes (for parallel jobs only).

       <b>PE_HOSTFILE</b>    The path of a file containing the definition of the virtual parallel machine assigned to a
                      parallel job by Grid  Engine.  See  the  description  of  the  <b>$pe_hostfile</b>  parameter  in
                      <u><a href="../man5/sge_pe.5.html">sge_pe</a></u>(5)  for  details  on  the  format  of  this  file. The environment variable is only
                      available for parallel jobs.

       <b>QUEUE</b>          The name of the cluster queue in which the job is running.

       <b>REQUEST</b>        Available for batch jobs only.

                      The request name of a job as specified with the <b>-N</b> switch (see above) or taken as the name
                      of the job script file.

       <b>RESTARTED</b>      This variable is set to 1 if a job was restarted after a system crash, or after  migration
                      of a non-application-level checkpointing job.  It is set to 2 when a job with application-
                      level checkpointing is restarted with a checkpoint available.  Otherwise its value is 0.

       <b>SHELL</b>          The  user's  login shell from the passwd database. <b>Note:</b> This is not necessarily the shell
                      in use for the job.

       <b>TMPDIR</b>         The absolute path to the job's temporary working directory.

       <b>TMP</b>            The same as TMPDIR; provided for compatibility with NQS.

       <b>TERM</b>           The terminal type imported from the submission session (only for interactive jobs).

       <b>TZ</b>             The time zone variable imported from <u><a href="../man8/sge_execd.8.html">sge_execd</a></u>(8) if set.

       <b>USER</b>           The user's login name from the passwd database.

       An additional variable, <b>SGE_JOBEXIT_STAT</b>, is set to the job exit status in  the  epilog  only  (see  also
       <u><a href="../man5/sge_conf.5.html">sge_conf</a></u>(5)).

</pre><h4><b>RESTRICTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Without  <b>-pty</b>  <b>y</b>,  there  is  no  controlling terminal for batch jobs under Grid Engine, and any tests or
       actions on a controlling terminal will fail. If these operations are in your <u>.login</u> or <u>.cshrc</u> file,  they
       may cause your job to abort.

       Insert the following test before any commands that are not pertinent to batch jobs in your .login:

              if ( $?JOB_NAME) then
                     echo "Grid Engine spooled job"
                     exit 0
              endif

       or in your .profile:

              if [ ! -z "$JOB_NAME" ] then
                     echo "Grid Engine spooled job"
                     exit 0
              fi

       Don't forget to set your shell's search path in your shell start-up before this code.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       The following exit values are returned:

       0    Operation was executed successfully.

       25   It  was not possible to register a new job according to the configured <u>max_u_jobs</u> or <u>max_jobs</u> limit.
            Additional information may be found in <u><a href="../man5/sge_conf.5.html">sge_conf</a></u>(5)

       &gt;0   Error occurred.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       The following is the simplest form of a Grid Engine script file.

              #!<a href="file:/bin/sh">/bin/sh</a>
                 ./a.out

       The next example is a more complex Grid Engine script.

              #!<a href="file:/bin/sh">/bin/sh</a>

              # Which account to be charged cpu time
              #$ -A santa_claus

              # date-time to run, format [[CC]yy]MMDDhhmm[.SS]
              #$ -a 12241200

              # to run I want 6 or more parallel processes
              # under the PE pvm. the processes require
              # 128M of memory
              #$ -pe pvm 6- -l mem=128

              # If I run on dec_x put stderr in /tmp/foo, if I
              # run on sun_y, put stderr in /usr/me/foo
              #$ -e dec_x:/tmp/foo,sun_y:/usr/me/foo

              # Send mail to these users
              #$ -M santa@nothpole,claus@northpole

              # Mail at beginning/end/on suspension
              #$ -m bes

              # Export these environmental variables
              #$ -v PVM_ROOT,FOOBAR=BAR
