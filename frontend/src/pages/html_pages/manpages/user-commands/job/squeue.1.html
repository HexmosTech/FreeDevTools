</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       squeue - view information about jobs located in the Slurm scheduling queue.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>squeue</b> [<u>OPTIONS</u>...]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>squeue</b> is used to view job and job step information for jobs managed by Slurm.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-A</b>, <b>--account</b>=&lt;<u>account_list</u>&gt;
              Specify  the  accounts  of the jobs to view. Accepts a comma separated list of account names. This
              has no effect when listing job steps.

       <b>-a</b>, <b>--all</b>
              Display information about jobs and job steps in all partitions.  This  causes  information  to  be
              displayed  about  partitions  that  are configured as hidden, partitions that are unavailable to a
              user's group, and federated jobs that are in a "revoked" state.

       <b>-r</b>, <b>--array</b>
              Display one job array element per line.  Without this option, the display will  be  optimized  for
              use  with  job  arrays (pending job array elements will be combined on one line of output with the
              array index values printed using a regular expression).

       <b>-M</b>, <b>--clusters</b>=&lt;<u>cluster_name</u>&gt;
              Clusters to issue commands to. Multiple cluster names may be comma separated.  A  value  of  '<u>all</u>'
              will  query  to  run  on  all clusters.  Note that the <b>slurmdbd</b> must be up for this option to work
              properly, unless running in a federation with either  <b>FederationParameters=fed_display</b>  configured
              or the <b>--federation</b> option set.  This option implicitly sets the <b>--local</b> option.

       <b>--expand-patterns</b>
              Expand  any  filename  patterns  from  in <b>StdOut</b>, <b>StdErr</b> and <b>StdIn</b>.  Fields that map to a range of
              values will use the first value of the range. For example "%t" for task id  will  be  replaced  by
              "0".

       <b>--federation</b>
              Show jobs from the federation if a member of one.

       <b>-o</b>, <b>--format</b>=&lt;<u>output_format</u>&gt;
              Specify  the  information  to be displayed, its size and position (right or left justified).  Also
              see the <b>-O</b>, <b>--Format</b>=&lt;<u>output_format</u>&gt; option described below (which supports  less  flexibility  in
              formatting, but supports access to all fields).  If the command is executed in a federated cluster
              environment  and information about more than one cluster is to be displayed and the <b>-h,</b> <b>--noheader</b>
              option is used, then the cluster name will be displayed before the default  output  formats  shown
              below.

              The default formats with various options are:

              <u>default</u>        "%.18i %.9P %.8j %.8u %.2t %.10M %.6D %R"

              <u>-l,</u> <u>--long</u>     "%.18i %.9P %.8j %.8u %.8T %.10M %.9l %.6D %R"

              <u>-s,</u> <u>--steps</u>    "%.15i %.8j %.9P %.8u %.9M %N"

       The format of each field is "%[[.]size]type[suffix]"

                 <u>size</u>   Minimum field size. If no size is specified, whatever is needed to print the information
                        will be used.

                 <u>.</u>      Indicates  the  output should be right justified and size must be specified.  By default
                        output is left justified.

                 <u>suffix</u> Arbitrary string to append to the end of the field.

       Note that many of these <u>type</u> specifications are valid only for jobs while others are valid only  for  job
       steps.  Valid <u>type</u> specifications include:

              <b>%all</b>  Print all fields available for this data type with a vertical bar separating each field.

              <b>%a</b>    Account associated with the job.  (Valid for jobs only)

              <b>%A</b>    Number  of tasks created by a job step.  This reports the value of the <b>srun</b> <b>--ntasks</b> option.
                    (Valid for job steps only)

              <b>%A</b>    Job id.  This will have a unique value for each element of  job  arrays.   (Valid  for  jobs
                    only)

              <b>%B</b>    Executing  (batch)  host. For an allocated session, this is the host on which the session is
                    executing (i.e. the node from which the <b>srun</b> or the <b>salloc</b>  command  was  executed).  For  a
                    batch  job,  this  is  the  node  executing the batch script. In the case of a typical Linux
                    cluster, this would be the compute node zero of the allocation.

              <b>%c</b>    Minimum number of CPUs (processors) per node requested by the job.  This reports  the  value
                    of the <b>srun</b> <b>--mincpus</b> option with a default value of zero.  (Valid for jobs only)

              <b>%C</b>    Number of CPUs (processors) requested by the job or allocated to it if already running. As a
                    job is completing this number will reflect the current number of CPUs allocated.  (Valid for
                    jobs only)

              <b>%d</b>    Minimum size of temporary disk space (in MB) requested by the job.  (Valid for jobs only)

              <b>%D</b>    Number  of  nodes  allocated to the job or the minimum number of nodes required by a pending
                    job. The actual number of nodes allocated to a pending job may exceed this number if the job
                    specified a node range count (e.g.  minimum and maximum node counts) or the job specifies  a
                    processor count instead of a node count. As a job is completing this number will reflect the
                    current number of nodes allocated.  (Valid for jobs only)

              <b>%e</b>    Time  at  which the job ended or is expected to end (based upon its time limit).  (Valid for
                    jobs only)

              <b>%E</b>    Job dependencies remaining. This job will not begin execution  until  these  dependent  jobs
                    complete.  In  the  case  of  a  job  that  can  not run due to job dependencies never being
                    satisfied, the  full  original  job  dependency  specification  will  be  reported.  Once  a
                    dependency is satisfied, it is removed from the job. A value of NULL implies this job has no
                    dependencies.  (Valid for jobs only)

              <b>%f</b>    Features required by the job.  (Valid for jobs only)

              <b>%F</b>    Job  array's  job  ID.  This  is  the  base job ID.  For non-array jobs, this is the job ID.
                    (Valid for jobs only)

              <b>%g</b>    Group name of the job.  (Valid for jobs only)

              <b>%G</b>    Group ID of the job.  (Valid for jobs only)

              <b>%h</b>    Can the compute resources allocated to the job  be  over  subscribed  by  other  jobs.   The
                    resources to be over subscribed can be nodes, sockets, cores, or hyperthreads depending upon
                    configuration.   The  value  will  be  "YES" if the job was submitted with the oversubscribe
                    option or the partition is configured with OverSubscribe=Force, "NO"  if  the  job  requires
                    exclusive node access, "USER" if the allocated compute nodes are dedicated to a single user,
                    "MCS" if the allocated compute nodes are dedicated to a single security class (See MCSPlugin
                    and  MCSParameters configuration parameters for more information), "OK" otherwise (typically
                    allocated dedicated CPUs), (Valid for jobs only)

              <b>%H</b>    Number of sockets per node requested by the  job.   This  reports  the  value  of  the  <b>srun</b>
                    <b>--sockets-per-node</b>  option.   When  --sockets-per-node  has  not been set, "*" is displayed.
                    (Valid for jobs only)

              <b>%i</b>    Job or job step id.  In the case of job arrays, the job  ID  format  will  be  of  the  form
                    "&lt;base_job_id&gt;_&lt;index&gt;".   By  default, the job array index field size will be limited to 64
                    bytes.  Use the environment variable SLURM_BITSTR_LEN to specify larger field sizes.  (Valid
                    for jobs and job steps) In the case of heterogeneous job allocations, the job ID format will
                    be of the form "#+#" where the first number is the "heterogeneous job leader" and the second
                    number the zero origin offset for each component of the job.

              <b>%I</b>    Number of cores per socket requested by the  job.   This  reports  the  value  of  the  <b>srun</b>
                    <b>--cores-per-socket</b>  option.   When  --cores-per-socket  has  not been set, "*" is displayed.
                    (Valid for jobs only)

              <b>%j</b>    Job or job step name.  (Valid for jobs and job steps)

              <b>%J</b>    Number of threads per core requested by the  job.   This  reports  the  value  of  the  <b>srun</b>
                    <b>--threads-per-core</b>  option.   When  --threads-per-core  has  not been set, "*" is displayed.
                    (Valid for jobs only)

              <b>%k</b>    Comment associated with the job.  (Valid for jobs only)

              <b>%K</b>    Job array index.  By default, this field  size  will  be  limited  to  64  bytes.   Use  the
                    environment variable SLURM_BITSTR_LEN to specify larger field sizes.  (Valid for jobs only)

              <b>%l</b>    Time limit of the job or job step in days-hours:minutes:seconds.  The value may be "NOT_SET"
                    if not yet established or "UNLIMITED" for no limit.  (Valid for jobs and job steps)

              <b>%L</b>    Time left for the job to execute in days-hours:minutes:seconds.  This value is calculated by
                    subtracting  the job's time used from its time limit.  The value may be "NOT_SET" if not yet
                    established or "UNLIMITED" for no limit.  (Valid for jobs only)

              <b>%m</b>    Minimum size of memory (in MB) requested by the job.  (Valid for jobs only)  If  memory  was
                    request  per  CPU,  or per GPU the value is shown with the assumption that at least one CPU,
                    GPU will be allocated respectively.

              <b>%M</b>    Time used by the job or job step in days-hours:minutes:seconds.   The  days  and  hours  are
                    printed  only  as  needed.   For job steps this field shows the elapsed time since execution
                    began and thus will be inaccurate for job steps  which  have  been  suspended.   Clock  skew
                    between nodes in the cluster will cause the time to be inaccurate.  If the time is obviously
                    wrong (e.g. negative), it displays as "INVALID".  (Valid for jobs and job steps)

              <b>%n</b>    List of node names explicitly requested by the job.  (Valid for jobs only)

              <b>%N</b>    List of nodes allocated to the job or job step. In the case of a <u>COMPLETING</u> job, the list of
                    nodes will comprise only those nodes that have not yet been returned to service.  (Valid for
                    jobs and job steps)

              <b>%o</b>    The command to be executed.

              <b>%O</b>    Are contiguous nodes requested by the job.  (Valid for jobs only)

              <b>%p</b>    Priority  of  the  job (converted to a floating point number between 0.0 and 1.0).  Also see
                    <b>%Q</b>.  (Valid for jobs only)

              <b>%P</b>    Partition of the job or job step.  (Valid for jobs and job steps)

              <b>%Q</b>    Priority of the job (generally a very large unsigned integer).  Also  see  <b>%p</b>.   (Valid  for
                    jobs only)

              <b>%r</b>    The  reason  a job is in its current state.  See the <b>JOB</b> <b>REASON</b> <b>CODES</b> section below for more
                    information.  (Valid for jobs only)

              <b>%R</b>    For pending jobs: the reason a job has not been started by the scheduler is  printed  within
                    parenthesis.   For  terminated jobs with failure: an explanation as to why the job failed is
                    printed within parenthesis.  For all other job states: the list of allocate nodes.  See  the
                    <b>JOB</b> <b>REASON</b> <b>CODES</b> section below for more information.  (Valid for jobs only)

              <b>%S</b>    Actual or expected start time of the job or job step.  (Valid for jobs and job steps)

              <b>%t</b>    Job  state  in  compact  form.  See the <b>JOB</b> <b>STATE</b> <b>CODES</b> section below for a list of possible
                    states.  (Valid for jobs only)

              <b>%T</b>    Job state in extended form.  See the <b>JOB</b> <b>STATE</b> <b>CODES</b> section below for a  list  of  possible

              <b>--jobs</b>=&lt;<u>job_id_list</u>&gt;  option  may  be  used  in  conjunction with the <b>--steps</b> option to print step
              information about specific jobs.  Note: If a list of job IDs is provided, the jobs  are  displayed
              even  if  they  are  on  hidden  partitions.  Since this option's argument is optional, for proper
              parsing the single letter option must be followed immediately with the value  and  not  include  a
              space   between   them.   For  example  "-j1008"  and  not  "-j  1008".   The  job  ID  format  is
              "job_id[_array_id]".  Performance of the command can be measurably improved for systems with large
              numbers of jobs when a single job ID is specified.  By default, this field size will be limited to
              64 bytes.  Use the environment variable SLURM_BITSTR_LEN to specify larger field sizes.

       <b>--json</b>, <b>--json</b>=<u>list</u>, <b>--json</b>=&lt;<u>data_parser</u>&gt;
              Dump information as JSON using  the  default  data_parser  plugin  or  explicit  data_parser  with
              parameters.  All  information  is dumped, even if it would normally not be. Sorting and formatting
              arguments passed to other options are ignored; however, most filtering arguments are still used.

       <b>-L</b>, <b>--licenses</b>=&lt;<u>license_list</u>&gt;
              Request jobs requesting or using one or more of the named licenses.  The license list consists  of
              a comma separated list of license names.

       <b>--local</b>
              Show only jobs local to this cluster. Ignore other clusters in this federation (if any). Overrides
              --federation.

       <b>-l</b>, <b>--long</b>
              Report  more  of  the  available  information  for  the selected jobs or job steps, subject to any
              constraints specified.

       <b>--me</b>   Equivalent to <b>--user=&lt;my</b> <b>username&gt;</b>.

       <b>-n</b>, <b>--name</b>=&lt;<u>name_list</u>&gt;
              Request jobs or job steps having one of  the  specified  names.  The  list  consists  of  a  comma
              separated list of job names.

       <b>--noconvert</b>
              Don't convert units from their original type (e.g. 2048M won't be converted to 2G).

       <b>-w</b>, <b>--nodelist</b>=&lt;<u>hostlist</u>&gt;
              Report  only  on  jobs  allocated  to the specified node or list of nodes.  This may either be the
              <b>NodeName</b> or <b>NodeHostname</b> as defined in <b><a href="../man5/slurm.conf.5.html">slurm.conf</a>(5)</b> in the event that they differ.   A  node_name
              of <b>localhost</b> is mapped to the current host name.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--noheader</b>
              Do not print a header on the output.

       <b>--notme</b>
              Opposite of <b>--me</b>; only display jobs that are not from the invoking user.

       <b>--only-job-state</b>
              Only  query  for  the job state. Query utilizes RPC that only retains JobID and State information,
              reducing work required by slurmctld to respond.

       <b>-p</b>, <b>--partition</b>=&lt;<u>part_list</u>&gt;
              Specify the partitions of the jobs or steps to view. Accepts a comma separated list  of  partition
              names.

       <b>-P</b>, <b>--priority</b>
              For  pending  jobs submitted to multiple partitions, list the job once per partition. In addition,
              if jobs are sorted by priority, consider both the partition and job priority. This option  can  be
              used  to  produce a list of pending jobs in the same order considered for scheduling by Slurm with
              appropriate additional options (e.g. "--sort=-p,i --states=PD").

       <b>-q</b>, <b>--qos</b>=&lt;<u>qos_list</u>&gt;
              Specify the qos(s) of the jobs or steps to view. Accepts a comma separated list of qos's.

       <b>-R</b>, <b>--reservation</b>=&lt;<u>reservation_name</u>&gt;
              Specify the reservation of the jobs to view.

       <b>--sibling</b>
              Show all sibling jobs on a federated cluster. Implies --federation.

       <b>-S</b>, <b>--sort</b>=&lt;<u>sort_list</u>&gt;
              Specification of the order in which  records  should  be  reported.   This  uses  the  same  field
              specification  as  the &lt;output_format&gt;.  The long format option "cluster" can also be used to sort
              jobs or job steps by cluster name (e.g. federated jobs).   Multiple  sorts  may  be  performed  by
              listing multiple sort fields separated by commas.  The field specifications may be preceded by "+"
              or  "-"  for  ascending (default) and descending order respectively.  For example, a sort value of
              "P,U" will sort the records by partition name then by user id.  The default value of sort for jobs
              is "P,t,-p" (increasing partition name then within a given partition by increasing job  state  and
              then decreasing priority).  The default value of sort for job steps is "P,i" (increasing partition
              name then within a given partition by increasing step id).

       <b>--start</b>
              Report  the  expected  start  time  and  resources  to  be  allocated for pending jobs in order of
              increasing start time.  This is equivalent to the following  options:  <b>--format="%.18i</b>  <b>%.9P</b>  <b>%.8j</b>
              <b>%.8u</b>  <b>%.2t</b>   <b>%.19S</b>  <b>%.6D</b>  <b>%20Y</b>  <b>%R"</b>,  <b>--sort=S</b>  and <b>--states=PENDING</b>.  Any of these options may be
              explicitly changed as desired by combining the <b>--start</b> option with other option  values  (e.g.  to
              use  a different output format).  The expected start time of pending jobs is only available if the
              Slurm is configured to use the backfill scheduling plugin.

       <b>-t</b>, <b>--states</b>=&lt;<u>state_list</u>&gt;
              Specify the states of jobs to view. Accepts a comma separated list of state  names  or  "all".  If
              "all"  is  specified  then  jobs  of  all  states  will be reported. If no state is specified then
              pending, running, and completing jobs are reported. See the <b>JOB</b> <b>STATE</b> <b>CODES</b> section  below  for  a
              list  of  valid states. Both extended and compact forms are valid.  Note the <b>&lt;state_list&gt;</b> supplied
              is case insensitive ("pd" and "PD" are equivalent).

       <b>-s</b>, <b>--steps</b>[=&lt;<u>step_list</u>&gt;]
              Specify the job steps to view. This flag indicates that a comma separated list  of  job  steps  to
              view   follows   without   an   equal   sign   (see   examples).    The   job   step   format   is
              "job_id[_array_id].step_id". Defaults to all job steps. Since this option's argument is  optional,
              for  proper  parsing  the single letter option must be followed immediately with the value and not
              include a space between them. For example "-s1008.0" and not "-s 1008.0".

       <b>--usage</b>
              Print a brief help message listing the <b>squeue</b> options.

       <b>-u</b>, <b>--user</b>=&lt;<u>user_list</u>&gt;
              Request jobs or job steps from a comma separated list of users.  The  list  can  consist  of  user
              names  or user id numbers.  Performance of the command can be measurably improved for systems with
              large numbers of jobs when a single user is specified.

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b>
              Report details of squeues actions.

       <b>-V</b> , <b>--version</b>
              Print version information and exit.

       <b>--yaml</b>, <b>--yaml</b>=<u>list</u>, <b>--yaml</b>=&lt;<u>data_parser</u>&gt;
              Dump information as YAML using  the  default  data_parser  plugin  or  explicit  data_parser  with
              parameters.  All  information  is dumped, even if it would normally not be. Sorting and formatting
              arguments passed to other options are ignored; however, most filtering arguments are still used.

</pre><h4><b>JOB</b> <b>REASON</b> <b>CODES</b></h4><pre>
       These codes identify the reason that a job has not been started by the scheduler.  There may be  multiple
       reasons  why  a job cannot start yet, in which case only the reason that was encountered by the attempted
       scheduling method will be displayed.

       The Reasons listed below are some of the more common ones you might see.  For a full list of Reason codes
       refer to this page: &lt;https://slurm.schedmd.com/job_reason_codes.html&gt;

       <b>JobHeldUser</b>           The job is held by the user.

       <b>JobLaunchFailure</b>      The  job  could not be launched.  This may be due to a file system problem, invalid
                             program name, etc.

       <b>Licenses</b>              The job is waiting for a license.

       <b>NodeDown</b>              A node required by the job is down.

                             DOWN, DRAINED, or not responding.  Nodes which are DOWN, DRAINED, or not responding
                             will be identified as part of the job's "reason" field as "UnavailableNodes".  Such
                             nodes  will  typically  require  the intervention of a system administrator to make
                             available.

       <b>Reservation</b>           The job is waiting its advanced reservation to become available.

</pre><h4><b>JOB</b> <b>STATE</b> <b>CODES</b></h4><pre>
       Jobs  typically  pass  through  several  states in the course of their execution.  The typical states are
       PENDING, RUNNING, SUSPENDED, COMPLETING, and COMPLETED.  The following states are recognized by squeue. A
       full list of possible states is available at &lt;https://slurm.schedmd.com/job_state_codes.html&gt;.

       <b>BF</b>  <b>BOOT_FAIL</b>       Job terminated due to launch failure, typically  due  to  a  hardware  failure  (e.g.
                           unable to boot the node or block and the job can not be requeued).

       <b>CA</b>  <b>CANCELLED</b>       Job was explicitly cancelled by the user or system administrator.  The job may or may
                           not have been initiated.

       <b>CD</b>  <b>COMPLETED</b>       Job has terminated all processes on all nodes with an exit code of zero.

       <b>CF</b>  <b>CONFIGURING</b>     Job  has  been  allocated resources, but are waiting for them to become ready for use
                           (e.g. booting).

       <b>CG</b>  <b>COMPLETING</b>      Job is in the process of completing. Some  processes  on  some  nodes  may  still  be
                           active.

       <b>DL</b>  <b>DEADLINE</b>        Job terminated on deadline.

       <b>F</b>   <b>FAILED</b>          Job terminated with non-zero exit code or other failure condition.

       <b>NF</b>  <b>NODE_FAIL</b>       Job terminated due to failure of one or more allocated nodes.

       <b>OOM</b> <b>OUT_OF_MEMORY</b>   Job experienced out of memory error.

       <b>PD</b>  <b>PENDING</b>         Job is awaiting resource allocation.

       <b>PR</b>  <b>PREEMPTED</b>       Job terminated due to preemption.

       <b>R</b>   <b>RUNNING</b>         Job currently has an allocation.

       <b>RD</b>  <b>RESV_DEL_HOLD</b>   Job is being held after requested reservation was deleted.

       <b>RF</b>  <b>REQUEUE_FED</b>     Job is being requeued by a federation.

       <b>RH</b>  <b>REQUEUE_HOLD</b>    Held job is being requeued.

       <b>RQ</b>  <b>REQUEUED</b>        Completing job is being requeued.

       <b>SI</b>  <b>SIGNALING</b>       Job is being signaled.

       <b>SE</b>  <b>SPECIAL_EXIT</b>    The job was requeued in a special state. This state can be set by users, typically in
                           EpilogSlurmctld, if the job has terminated with a particular exit value.

       <b>SO</b>  <b>STAGE_OUT</b>       Job is staging out files.

       <b>ST</b>  <b>STOPPED</b>         Job has an allocation, but execution has been stopped with SIGSTOP signal.  CPUS have
                           been retained by this job.

       <b>S</b>   <b>SUSPENDED</b>       Job  has  an allocation, but execution has been suspended and CPUs have been released
                           for other jobs.

       <b>TO</b>  <b>TIMEOUT</b>         Job terminated upon reaching its time limit.

</pre><h4><b>PERFORMANCE</b></h4><pre>
       Executing <b>squeue</b> sends a remote procedure call to <b>slurmctld</b>. If enough calls from <b>squeue</b> or  other  Slurm
       client  commands  that send remote procedure calls to the <b>slurmctld</b> daemon come in at once, it can result
       in a degradation of performance of the <b>slurmctld</b> daemon, possibly resulting in a denial of service.

       Do not run <b>squeue</b> or other Slurm client commands that send remote procedure calls to <b>slurmctld</b> from loops
       in shell scripts or other programs. Ensure that programs limit calls to <b>squeue</b> to the  minimum  necessary
       for the information you are trying to gather.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       Some  <b>squeue</b>  options may be set via environment variables. These environment variables, along with their
       corresponding options, are  listed  below.  (Note:  Command  line  options  will  always  override  these
       settings.)

       <b>SLURM_BITSTR_LEN</b>    Specifies  the string length to be used for holding a job array's task ID expression.
                           The default value is 64 bytes.  A value of 0 will print the full expression with  any
                           length required.  Larger values may adversely impact the application performance.

       <b>SLURM_CLUSTERS</b>      Same as <b>--clusters</b>

       <b>SLURM_CONF</b>          The location of the Slurm configuration file.

       <b>SLURM_DEBUG_FLAGS</b>   Specify  debug  flags for squeue to use. See DebugFlags in the <b><a href="../man5/slurm.conf.5.html">slurm.conf</a></b>(5) man page
                           for a full list of flags. The environment variable takes precedence over the  setting
                           in the slurm.conf.

       <b>SLURM_TIME_FORMAT</b>   Specify  the  format  used  to  report  time stamps. A value of <u>standard</u>, the default
                           value, generates output in the form "year-month-dateThour:minute:second".  A value of
                           <u>relative</u> returns only "hour:minute:second" if the current day.  For  other  dates  in
                           the  current  year  it  prints  the  "hour:minute"  preceded  by "Tomorr" (tomorrow),
                           "Ystday" (yesterday), the name of the day for the coming  week  (e.g.  "Mon",  "Tue",
                           etc.),  otherwise  the date (e.g. "25 Apr").  For other years it returns a date month
                           and year without a time (e.g.  "6 Jun 2012"). All of the time stamps use  a  24  hour
                           format.

                           A valid strftime() format can also be specified. For example, a value of "%a %T" will
                           report the day of the week and a time stamp (e.g. "Mon 12:34:56").
