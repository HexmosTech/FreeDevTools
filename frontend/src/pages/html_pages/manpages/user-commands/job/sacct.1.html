</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       sacct  -  displays  accounting  data  for all jobs and job steps in the Slurm job accounting log or Slurm
       database

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>sacct</b> [<u>OPTIONS</u>...]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Accounting information for jobs invoked with Slurm are either logged in the job accounting  log  file  or
       saved to the Slurm database, as configured with the AccountingStorageType parameter.

       The <b>sacct</b> command displays job accounting data stored in the job accounting log file or Slurm database in
       a  variety of forms for your analysis. The <b>sacct</b> command displays information on jobs, job steps, status,
       and exitcodes by default. You can tailor the output with the use of the <b>--format=</b> option to  specify  the
       fields to be shown.

       Job  records  consist of a primary entry for the job as a whole as well as entries for job steps. The Job
       Launch    page    has    a    more    detailed    description    of    each    type    of    job    step.
       &lt;https://slurm.schedmd.com/job_launch.html#job_record&gt;

       For  the  root  user,  the  <b>sacct</b>  command displays job accounting data for all users, although there are
       options to filter the output to report only the jobs from a specified user or group.

       For the non-root user, the <b>sacct</b> command limits the display of job accounting  data  to  jobs  that  were
       launched  with their own user identifier (UID) by default. Data for other users can be displayed with the
       <b>--allusers</b>, <b>--user</b>, or <b>--uid</b> options.

       Elapsed time fields are presented as [days-]hours:minutes:seconds[.microseconds]. Only 'CPU' fields  will
       ever have microseconds.

       The default input file is the file named in the <b>AccountingStorageLoc</b> parameter in slurm.conf.

       <b>NOTE</b>:  If  designated,  the  slurmdbd.conf  option  PrivateData  may further restrict the accounting data
       visible to users which are not SlurmUser, root, or a user with AdminLevel=Admin.  See  the  slurmdbd.conf
       man page for additional details on restricting access to accounting data.

       <b>NOTE</b>:  The  contents  of  Slurm's  database  are maintained in lower case.  This may result in some <b>sacct</b>
       output differing from that of other Slurm commands.

       <b>NOTE</b>: Much of the data reported by <b>sacct</b> has been generated by the <u>wait3()</u> and <u>getrusage()</u> system  calls.
       Some systems gather and report incomplete information for these calls; <b>sacct</b> reports values of 0 for this
       missing  data.  See  your  systems  <u>getrusage</u>  <u>(3)</u> man page for information about which data are actually
       available on your system.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-A</b>, <b>--accounts</b>=&lt;<u>account_list</u>&gt;
                 Displays jobs when a comma separated list of accounts are given as the argument.

       <b>--array</b>   Expand job arrays. Display all array tasks on separate lines instead of  displaying  groups  of
                 array tasks on single lines.

       <b>-L</b>, <b>--allclusters</b>
                 Display  jobs ran on all clusters. By default, only jobs ran on the cluster from where <b>sacct</b> is
                 called are displayed.

       <b>-X</b>, <b>--allocations</b>
                 Only  show  statistics  relevant  to  the  job  allocation  itself,  not  taking   steps   into
                 consideration.

                 <b>NOTE</b>: Without including steps, utilization statistics for job allocation(s) will be reported as
                 zero.

       <b>-a</b>, <b>--allusers</b>
                 Displays  all  users'  jobs  when run by user root or if <b>PrivateData</b> is not configured to <b>jobs</b>.
                 Otherwise display the current user's jobs

       <b>-x</b>, <b>--associations</b>=&lt;<u>assoc_list</u>&gt;
                 Displays the statistics only for the jobs running under the association ids  specified  by  the
                 <b>assoc_list</b>  operand,  which  is a comma-separated list of association ids. Space characters are
                 not allowed in the <b>assoc_list</b>. Default is all associations.

       <b>-B</b>, <b>--batch-script</b>
                 This option will print the batch script of job if the job used one. If the job  didn't  have  a
                 script 'NONE' is output.
                 <b>NOTE</b>: AccountingStoreFlags=job_script is required for this.
                 <b>NOTE</b>: Requesting specific job(s) with '-j' is required for this.

       <b>-b</b>, <b>--brief</b>
                 Displays a brief listing consisting of JobID, State, and ExitCode.

       <b>-M</b>, <b>--clusters</b>=&lt;<u>cluster_list</u>&gt;
                 Displays the statistics only for the jobs started on the clusters specified by the <u>cluster_list</u>
                 operand,  which  is a comma-separated list of clusters. Space characters are not allowed in the
                 <u>cluster_list</u>.  A value of '<u>all</u>' will query to run on all  clusters.   The  default  is  current
                 cluster  you are executing the <b>sacct</b> command on or all clusters in the federation when executed
                 on a federated cluster.  This option implicitly sets the <b>--local</b> option.

       <b>-c</b>, <b>--completion</b>
                 Use job completion data instead of job accounting. The <b>JobCompType</b> parameter in the  slurm.conf
                 file  must  be  defined  to  a non-none option.  Does not support federated cluster information
                 (local data only).

       <b>-C</b>, <b>--constraints</b>=&lt;<u>constraint_list</u>&gt;
                 Comma separated list to filter jobs based  on  what  constraints/features  the  job  requested.
                 Multiple  options  will  be  treated  as  'and' not 'or', so the job would need all constraints
                 specified to be returned not one or the other.

       <b>--delimiter</b>=&lt;<u>characters</u>&gt;
                 ASCII characters used to separate the fields when specifying the <b>-p</b> or <b>-P</b> options. The  default
                 delimiter is a '|'. This option is ignored if <b>-p</b> or <b>-P</b> options are not specified.

       <b>-D</b>, <b>--duplicates</b>
                 If  Slurm  job  ids  are  reset,  some  job  numbers will probably appear more than once in the
                 accounting log file but refer to different  jobs.   Such  jobs  can  be  distinguished  by  the
                 "submit" time stamp in the data records.

                 When data for specific jobs are requested with the --jobs option, <b>sacct</b> returns the most recent
                 job with that number. This behavior can be overridden by specifying --duplicates, in which case
                 all records that match the selection criteria will be returned.

                 <b>NOTE</b>: Revoked federated sibling jobs are hidden unless the <b>--duplicates</b> option is specified.

       <b>-E</b>, <b>--endtime</b>=&lt;<u>end_time</u>&gt;
                 Select  jobs  in  any  state  before the specified time. If states are given with the -s option
                 return jobs in this state before this period.  See the <b>DEFAULT</b> <b>TIME</b> <b>WINDOW</b> for more details.

                 Valid time formats are:
                 HH:MM[:SS][AM|PM]
                 MMDD[YY][-HH:MM[:SS]]
                 MM.DD[.YY][-HH:MM[:SS]]
                 MM/DD[/YY][-HH:MM[:SS]]
                 YYYY-MM-DD[THH:MM[:SS]]
                 today, midnight, noon, elevenses (11 AM), fika (3 PM), teatime (4 PM)
                 now[{+|-}<u>count</u>[seconds(default)|minutes|hours|days|weeks]]

       <b>--env-vars</b>
                 This option will print the running environment of a batch job, otherwise 'NONE' is output.
                 <b>NOTE</b>: AccountingStoreFlags=job_env is required for this.
                 <b>NOTE</b>: Requesting specific job(s) with '-j' is required for this.

       <b>--expand-patterns</b>
                 Expand any filename patterns from in <b>StdOut</b>, <b>StdErr</b> and <b>StdIn</b>.  Fields that map to a  range  of
                 values  will use the first value of the range. For example "%t" for task id will be replaced by
                 "0".

       <b>--federation</b>
                 Show jobs from the federation if a member of one.

       <b>-f</b>, <b>--file</b>=&lt;<u>file</u>&gt;
                 Causes the <b>sacct</b> command to read job accounting data from the named <u>file</u> instead of the current
                 Slurm job accounting log file. Only applicable when running the jobcomp/filetxt plugin. Setting
                 this flag implicitly enables the -c flag.

       <b>-F</b>, <b>--flags</b>=&lt;<u>flag_list</u>&gt;
                 Comma separated list to filter jobs based on what various ways the jobs were  handled.  Current
                 flags  are  SchedSubmit,  SchedMain,  SchedBackfill  and StartReceived. SchedSubmit, SchedMain,
                 SchedBackfill describe the scheduler that started the job.

       <b>-o</b>, <b>--format</b>
                 Comma separated list of fields. (use "--helpformat" for a list of available fields).

                 <b>NOTE</b>: When using the format option for listing various fields you can put a %NUMBER  afterwards
                 to specify how many characters should be printed.

                 e.g.  format=name%30  will print 30 characters of field name right justified. A %-30 will print
                 30 characters left justified.

                 When set, the SACCT_FORMAT environment variable will override the default format. For example:

                 SACCT_FORMAT="jobid,user,account,cluster"

       <b>-g</b>, <b>--gid</b>=, <b>--group</b>=&lt;<u>gid_or_group_list</u>&gt;
                 Displays the statistics only for the jobs started with the GID or the GROUP  specified  by  the
                 <u>gid_list</u>  or  the <u>group_list</u> operand, which is a comma-separated list. Space characters are not
                 allowed.  Default is no restrictions.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
                 Displays a general help message.

       <b>-e</b>, <b>--helpformat</b>
                 Print a list of fields that can be specified with the <b>--format</b> option.

       <b>NOTE</b>: When using with Ave[RSS|VM]Size  or  their  values  in  TRESUsageIn[Ave|Tot].  They  represent  the
       average/total  of  the highest watermarks over all ranks in the step. When using sstat they represent the
       average/total at the moment the command was run.

       <b>NOTE</b>: TRESUsage*Min* values represent the lowest highwater mark in the step.

       <b>NOTE</b>:  Availability  of  metrics  rely   on   the   <b>jobacct_gather</b>   plugin   used.   For   example   the
       jobacct_gather/cgroup  in  combination  with  cgroup/v2  does  not  provide Virtual Memory metrics due to
       limitations in the kernel cgroups interfaces and will show a 0 for the related fields.

       The section titled "Job Accounting Fields" describes these fields.

       <b>-j</b>, <b>--jobs</b>=&lt;<u>job</u>[.<u>step</u>]&gt;
                 Displays information about the specified <u>job</u>[.<u>step</u>] or list of <u>job</u>[.<u>step</u>]s.

                 The <u>job</u>[.<u>step</u>] parameter is a comma-separated list of jobs.  Space characters are not permitted
                 in this list.
                 <b>NOTE</b>: A step id of 'batch' will display the information about the batch step.
                 By default sacct shows only jobs with Eligible time, but with this option the non-eligible will
                 be also shown.
                 <b>NOTE</b>: If --state is also specified, as non-eligible are not PD, then non-eligible jobs will not
                 be displayed.  See the <b>DEFAULT</b> <b>TIME</b> <b>WINDOW</b> for  details  about  how  this  option  changes  the
                 default -S and -E options.

       <b>--json</b>, <b>--json</b>=<u>list</u>, <b>--json</b>=&lt;<u>data_parser</u>&gt;
                 Dump  job information as JSON using the default data_parser plugin or explicit data_parser with
                 parameters. Sorting and formatting arguments will be ignored.

       <b>--local</b>   Show only jobs local to this cluster. Ignore  other  clusters  in  this  federation  (if  any).
                 Overrides --federation.

       <b>-l</b>, <b>--long</b>
                 Equivalent to specifying:

                 tresusageoutmaxt,tresusageoutave,tresusageouttot

       <b>--name</b>=&lt;<u>jobname_list</u>&gt;
                 Display jobs that have any of these name(s).

       <b>-i</b>, <b>--nnodes</b>=&lt;<u>min</u>[-<u>max</u>]&gt;
                 Return jobs that ran on the specified number of nodes.

       <b>-I</b>, <b>--ncpus</b>=&lt;<u>min</u>[-<u>max</u>]&gt;
                 Return jobs that ran on the specified number of cpus.

       <b>--noconvert</b>
                 Don't convert units from their original type (e.g. 2048M won't be converted to 2G).

       <b>-N</b>, <b>--nodelist</b>=&lt;<u>node_list</u>&gt;
                 Display jobs that ran on any of these node(s). <u>node_list</u> can be a ranged string.

                 <b>NOTE</b>:  This  is  not  reliable when nodes are added or removed to Slurm while jobs are running.
                 Only jobs that started in the specified time range (-S, -E) will be returned.

       <b>-n</b>, <b>--noheader</b>
                 No heading will be added to the output. The default action is to display a header.

       <b>-p</b>, <b>--parsable</b>
                 Output will be '|' delimited with a '|' at the end. See also the <b>--delimiter</b> option.

       <b>-P</b>, <b>--parsable2</b>
                 Output will be '|' delimited without a '|' at the end. See also the <b>--delimiter</b> option.

       <b>-r</b>, <b>--partition</b>
                 Comma separated list of partitions to select jobs and  job  steps  from.  The  default  is  all
                 partitions.

       <b>-q</b>, <b>--qos</b> Only send data about jobs using these qos. Default is all.

       <b>-R</b>, <b>--reason</b>=&lt;<u>reason_list</u>&gt;
                 Comma  separated  list  to  filter  jobs  based on what reason the job wasn't scheduled outside
                 resources/priority.

       <b>-S</b>, <b>--starttime</b>
                 Select jobs in any state after the specified time. Default is  00:00:00  of  the  current  day,
                 unless  the  '-s'  or  '-j'  options  are used. If the '-s' option is used, then the default is
                 'now'. If states are given with the '-s' option then only jobs in this state at this time  will
                 be returned. If the '-j' option is used, then the default time is Unix Epoch 0. See the <b>DEFAULT</b>
                 <b>TIME</b> <b>WINDOW</b> for more details.

                 Valid time formats are:
                 HH:MM[:SS][AM|PM]
                 MMDD[YY][-HH:MM[:SS]]
                 MM.DD[.YY][-HH:MM[:SS]]
                 MM/DD[/YY][-HH:MM[:SS]]
                 YYYY-MM-DD[THH:MM[:SS]]
                 today, midnight, noon, elevenses (11 AM), fika (3 PM), teatime (4 PM)
                 now[{+|-}<u>count</u>[seconds(default)|minutes|hours|days|weeks]]

       <b>-s</b>, <b>--state</b>=&lt;<u>state_list</u>&gt;
                 Selects  jobs  based  on their state during the time period given.  Unless otherwise specified,
                 the start and end time will be the current time when the <b>--state</b> option is specified  and  only
                 currently  running  jobs  can  be displayed.  A start and/or end time must be specified to view
                 information about jobs not currently running.  See the <b>JOB</b> <b>STATE</b> <b>CODES</b> section below for a list
                 of state designators.  Multiple state names may be specified using comma separators. Either the
                 short or long form of the state name may be used (e.g. <b>CA</b> or <b>CANCELLED</b>) and the  name  is  case
                 insensitive (i.e. ca and <b>CA</b> both work).

                 <b>NOTE</b>:  Note  for  a  job to be selected in the PENDING state it must have "EligibleTime" in the
                 requested time interval or different from "Unknown". The "EligibleTime"  is  displayed  by  the
                 "scontrol  show  job"  command.  For  example jobs submitted with the "--hold" option will have
                 "EligibleTime=Unknown" as they are pending indefinitely.

                 <b>NOTE</b>: When specifying states and no start time is given the default start time is  'now'.  This
                 is  only  when  -j  is  not used. If -j is used the start time will default to 'Epoch'. In both
                 cases if no end time is given it will default to 'now'. See the <b>DEFAULT</b> <b>TIME</b>  <b>WINDOW</b>  for  more
                 details.

       <b>-K</b>, <b>--timelimit-max</b>
                 Ignored by itself, but if timelimit_min is set this will be the maximum timelimit of the range.
                 Default is no restriction.

       <b>-k</b>, <b>--timelimit-min</b>
                 Only  send  data  about  jobs  with this timelimit. If used with timelimit_max this will be the
                 minimum timelimit of the range.  Default is no restriction.

       <b>-T</b>, <b>--truncate</b>
                 Truncate time. So if a job started before --starttime the start  time  would  be  truncated  to
                 --starttime. The same for end time and --endtime.

       <b>-u,</b> <b>--uid</b>=, <b>--user</b>=&lt;<u>uid_or_user_list</u>&gt;
                 Use  this comma separated list of UIDs or user names to select jobs to display. By default, the
                 running user's UID is used.

       <b>--units</b>=[<b>KMGTP</b>]
                 Display values in specified unit type. Takes precedence over <b>--noconvert</b> option.

       <b>--usage</b>   Display a command usage summary.

       <b>--use-local-uid</b>
                 When displaying UID, sacct uses the UID stored in Slurm's accounting database by  default.  Use
                 this  command to make Slurm use a system call to get the UID from the username. This option may
                 be useful in an environment with multiple clusters and one database where the UIDs  aren't  the
                 same on all clusters.

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b>
                 Primarily for debugging purposes, report the state of various variables during processing.

       <b>-V,</b> <b>--version</b>
                 Print version.

       <b>-W</b>, <b>--wckeys</b>=&lt;<u>wckey_list</u>&gt;
                 Displays  the  statistics  only  for the jobs started on the wckeys specified by the <u>wckey_list</u>
                 operand, which is a comma-separated list of wckey names. Space characters are  not  allowed  in
                 the <u>wckey_list</u>. Default is all wckeys.

       <b>--whole-hetjob</b>[=yes|no]
                 When  querying  and  filtering heterogeneous jobs with <b>--jobs</b>, Slurm will default to retrieving
                 information about all the components of the job if the het_job_id (leader id) is selected. If a
                 non-leader heterogeneous job component id is selected then only that component is retrieved  by
                 default.  This  behavior can be changed by using this option. If set to 'yes' (or no argument),
                 then information about all the components will  be  retrieved  no  matter  which  component  is
                 selected  in  the  job  filter.  If  set  to  'no'  then  only  the  selected heterogeneous job
                 component(s) will be retrieved, even when selecting the leader.

       <b>--yaml</b>, <b>--yaml</b>=<u>list</u>, <b>--yaml</b>=&lt;<u>data_parser</u>&gt;
                 Dump job information as YAML using the default data_parser plugin or explicit data_parser  with
                 parameters. Sorting and formatting arguments will be ignored.

   <b>Job</b> <b>Accounting</b> <b>Fields</b>
       Descriptions  of  each  field  option  can  be found below.  Note that the Ave*, Max* and Min* accounting
       fields look at the values for all the tasks of each step in a job and  return  the  average,  maximum  or
       minimum  values of the task for that job step. For example, for MaxRSS, the returned value is the maximum
       memory consumption seen by one of the tasks of the step, and MaxRSSTask shows which task it is.

                        (K,M,G,T,P).   Note:  Only  in  the  case of an exclusive job allocation does this value
                        reflect the job's real energy consumption.

              <b>ConsumedEnergyRaw</b>
                        Total energy consumed by all tasks in a job, in joules.  Note: Only in the  case  of  an

                        colon is the signal that caused the process to terminate  if  it  was  terminated  by  a
                        signal.  The  DerivedExitCode  can  be  modified  by invoking <b>sacctmgr</b> <b>modify</b> <b>job</b> or the
                        specialized <b>sjobexitmod</b> command.

              <b>Elapsed</b>   The job's elapsed time.

                        The job's elapsed time in seconds.

              <b>Eligible</b>  When the job became eligible to run. In the same format as <b>End</b>.

              <b>End</b>       Termination time of the job. The output is of  the  format  YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS,  unless
                        changed through the SLURM_TIME_FORMAT environment variable.

              <b>ExitCode</b>  The  exit  code  returned  by  the  job script or salloc, typically as set by the exit()
                        function. Following the colon is the signal that caused the process to terminate  if  it
                        was terminated by a signal.

              <b>Extra</b>     The  job's  extra  string when the AccountingStoreFlags parameter in the slurm.conf file
                        contains 'job_extra'. The Extra string can be modified by invoking <b>sacctmgr</b>  <b>modify</b>  <b>job</b>
                        command.

              <b>FailedNode</b>
                        The name of the node whose failure caused the job to be killed.

              <b>Flags</b>     Job flags. Current flags are SchedSubmit, SchedMain, SchedBackfill.

              <b>GID</b>       The group identifier of the user who ran the job.

              <b>Group</b>     The group name of the user who ran the job.

              <b>JobID</b>     The identification number of the job or job step.

                        Regular jobs are in the form:

                        <u>JobID[.JobStep]</u>

                        Array jobs are in the form:

                        <u>ArrayJobID_ArrayTaskID</u>

                        Heterogeneous jobs are in the form:

                        <u>HetJobID+HetJobOffset</u>

                        When  printing  job  arrays,  performance  of the command can be measurably improved for
                        systems with large numbers of jobs when a single job ID is specified. By  default,  this
                        field size will be limited to 64 bytes. Use the environment variable SLURM_BITSTR_LEN to
                        specify larger field sizes.

              <b>JobIDRaw</b>  The  identification  number  of  the  job  or  job  step.  Prints  the JobID in the form
                        <u>JobID[.JobStep]</u> for regular, heterogeneous and array jobs.

              <b>JobName</b>   The name of the job or job step. The <b>slurm_accounting.log</b>  file  is  a  space  delimited
                        file. Because of this if a space is used in the jobname an underscore is substituted for
                        the  space  before  the record is written to the accounting file. So when the jobname is
                        displayed by <b>sacct</b> the jobname that had a space in it will now  have  an  underscore  in
                        place of the space.

              <b>Layout</b>    What  the layout of a step was when it was running. This can be used to give you an idea
                        of which node ran which rank in your job.

              <b>ReqCPUFreqMax</b>
                        Maximum requested CPU frequency for the step, in kHz.  Note: This value applies only  to
                        a job step. No value is reported for the job.

              <b>ReqCPUFreqMin</b>
                        Minimum  requested CPU frequency for the step, in kHz.  Note: This value applies only to

                        allocation, not the step.

              <b>ReqNodes</b>  Requested minimum Node count for the job/step.

              <b>ReqTres</b>   Trackable resources. These are the minimum resource counts requested by the job/step  at

                        Reservation Id.

              <b>Restarts</b>  How many times this job has been requeued/restarted.

              <b>Start</b>     Initiation time of the job. In the same format as <b>End</b>.

              <b>State</b>     Displays  the job status, or state.  See the <b>JOB</b> <b>STATE</b> <b>CODES</b> section below for a list of
                        possible states.

                        If more information is available on the job state than will fit into the  current  field
                        width  (for  example, the UID that CANCELLED a job) the state will be followed by a "+".
                        You can increase the size of the displayed state using  the  "%NUMBER"  format  modifier
                        described earlier.

                        <b>NOTE</b>:  The RUNNING state will return suspended jobs as well. In order to print suspended
                        jobs you must request SUSPENDED at a different call from RUNNING.

                        <b>NOTE</b>: The RUNNING state will return any jobs completed (cancelled or otherwise)  in  the
                        time  period  requested  as  the  job was also RUNNING during that time. If you are only
                        looking for jobs that finished, please  choose  the  appropriate  state(s)  without  the
                        RUNNING state.

              <b>StdErr</b>    Display  the  "<u>filename</u>  <u>pattern</u>"  for stderr redirection specified in a batch job. Path

                        submission.

              <b>Submit</b>    The time the job was submitted. In the same format as <b>End</b>.

                        <b>NOTE</b>: If a job is requeued, the submit time is reset. To obtain the original submit time
                        it is necessary to use the -D or --duplicate option to display all duplicate entries for
                        a job.

              <b>SubmitLine</b>
                        The full command issued to submit the job.

              <b>Suspended</b> The amount of time a job or job step was suspended. Format is the same as <u>Elapsed</u>.

              <b>SystemComment</b>
                        The  job's  comment string that is typically set by a plugin.  Can only be modified by a
                        Slurm administrator.

              <b>SystemCPU</b> The amount of system CPU time used by the job  or  job  step.  Format  is  the  same  as
                        <b>Elapsed</b>.

                        <b>NOTE</b>: See the note for TotalCPU for information about how canceled jobs are handled.

              <b>Timelimit</b> What the timelimit was/is for the job. Format is the same as <b>Elapsed</b>, but two additional
                        special values can be displayed:

                        <b>Partition_limit</b>
                               Indicates  that the job did not have its time limit set and was not yet subjected
                               to a partition MaxTime (i.e. job is pending). You can define the  <b>DefaultTime</b>  on
                               the partition to avoid seeing this value.

                        <b>UNLIMITED</b>
                               Indicates the job did not have a time limit defined.

              <b>TimelimitRaw</b>
                        What  the  timelimit  was/is  for  the  job.  Format is in number of minutes.  <b>NOTE</b>: See
                        <b>TimeLimit</b> description.

              <b>TotalCPU</b>  The sum of the SystemCPU and UserCPU time used by the job or job step.   The  total  CPU
                        time  of  the  job  may exceed the job's elapsed time for jobs that include multiple job
                        steps. Format is the same as <b>Elapsed</b>.

                        <b>NOTE</b>: For the steps interrupted by signal (e.g. scancel, job timeout) TotalCPU  provides
                        a  measure of the task's parent process and may not include CPU time of child processes.
                        This is  a  result  of  <b>wait3</b>  resource  usage  (<b>getrusage</b>)  internals.   For  processes
                        completing  in  regular way all the descendant processes (forks and execs) resources are
                        included. However, if the processes are killed the result may differ  between  proctrack
                        plugins and end-user applications.

              <b>TresUsageInAve</b>
                        Tres average usage in by all tasks in job.  <b>NOTE</b>: If corresponding TresUsageInMaxTask is

</pre><h4><b>JOB</b> <b>STATE</b> <b>CODES</b></h4><pre>
       The following states  are  recognized  by  sacct.  A  full  list  of  possible  states  is  available  at
       &lt;https://slurm.schedmd.com/job_state_codes.html&gt;.

       <b>BF</b>  <b>BOOT_FAIL</b>       Job  terminated  due  to  launch  failure,  typically due to a hardware failure (e.g.
                           unable to boot the node or block and the job can not be requeued).

       <b>CA</b>  <b>CANCELLED</b>       Job was explicitly cancelled by the user or system administrator.  The job may or may
                           not have been initiated.

       <b>CD</b>  <b>COMPLETED</b>       Job has terminated all processes on all nodes with an exit code of zero.

       <b>DL</b>  <b>DEADLINE</b>        Job terminated on deadline.

       <b>F</b>   <b>FAILED</b>          Job terminated with non-zero exit code or other failure condition.

       <b>NF</b>  <b>NODE_FAIL</b>       Job terminated due to failure of one or more allocated nodes.

       <b>OOM</b> <b>OUT_OF_MEMORY</b>   Job experienced out of memory error.

       <b>PR</b>  <b>PREEMPTED</b>       Job terminated due to preemption.

       <b>R</b>   <b>RUNNING</b>         Job currently has an allocation.

       <b>RQ</b>  <b>REQUEUED</b>        Job was requeued.

       <b>RS</b>  <b>RESIZING</b>        Job is about to change size.

       <b>RV</b>  <b>REVOKED</b>         Sibling was removed from cluster due to other cluster starting the job.

       <b>S</b>   <b>SUSPENDED</b>       Job has an allocation, but execution has been suspended and CPUs have  been  released
                           for other jobs.

       <b>TO</b>  <b>TIMEOUT</b>         Job terminated upon reaching its time limit.

</pre><h4><b>DEFAULT</b> <b>TIME</b> <b>WINDOW</b></h4><pre>
       The  options --starttime and --endtime define the time window between which <b>sacct</b> is going to search. For
       historical and practical reasons their default values (i.e. the default time  window)  depends  on  other
       options: --jobs and --state.

       Depending  on  if  --jobs  and/or --state are specified, the default values of <b>--starttime</b>  and <b>--endtime</b>
       options are:

       WITHOUT EITHER <b>--jobs</b> NOR <b>--state</b> <b>specified:</b>
       <b>--starttime</b> defaults to Midnight.
       <b>--endtime</b> defaults to Now.

       WITH <b>--jobs</b> AND WITHOUT <b>--state</b> <b>specified:</b>
       <b>--starttime</b> defaults to Epoch 0.
       <b>--endtime</b> defaults to Now.

       WITHOUT <b>--jobs</b> AND WITH <b>--state</b> <b>specified:</b>
       <b>--starttime</b> defaults to Now.
       <b>--endtime</b> defaults to --starttime and to Now if --starttime is not specified.

       WITH BOTH <b>--jobs</b> AND <b>--state</b> <b>specified:</b>
       <b>--starttime</b> defaults to Epoch 0.
       <b>--endtime</b> defaults to --starttime or to Now if --starttime is not specified.

       <b>NOTE</b>: With <b>-v/--verbose</b> a message about the actual time window in use is shown.

</pre><h4><b>PERFORMANCE</b></h4><pre>
       Executing <b>sacct</b> sends a remote procedure call to <b>slurmdbd</b>. If enough calls  from  <b>sacct</b>  or  other  Slurm
       client commands that send remote procedure calls to the <b>slurmdbd</b> daemon come in at once, it can result in
       a degradation of performance of the <b>slurmdbd</b> daemon, possibly resulting in a denial of service.

       Do  not  run <b>sacct</b> or other Slurm client commands that send remote procedure calls to <b>slurmdbd</b> from loops
       in shell scripts or other programs. Ensure that programs limit calls to <b>sacct</b> to  the  minimum  necessary
       for the information you are trying to gather.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       Some  <b>sacct</b>  options  may be set via environment variables. These environment variables, along with their
       corresponding options, are  listed  below.  (Note:  Command  line  options  will  always  override  these
       settings.)

       <b>SACCT_FEDERATION</b>    Same as <b>--federation</b>

       <b>SACCT_FORMAT</b>        Allows you to define the columns to display in the output.  Same as <b>--format</b>

       <b>SACCT_LOCAL</b>         Same as <b>--local</b>

       <b>SLURM_BITSTR_LEN</b>    Specifies  the string length to be used for holding a job array's task ID expression.
                           The default value is 64 bytes. A value of 0 will print the full expression  with  any
                           length required. Larger values may adversely impact the application performance.

       <b>SLURM_CONF</b>          The location of the Slurm configuration file.

       <b>SLURM_DEBUG_FLAGS</b>   Specify  debug  flags  for sacct to use. See DebugFlags in the <b><a href="../man5/slurm.conf.5.html">slurm.conf</a></b>(5) man page
                           for a full list of flags. The environment variable takes precedence over the  setting
                           in the slurm.conf.

       <b>SLURM_TIME_FORMAT</b>   Specify  the  format  used  to  report  time stamps. A value of <u>standard</u>, the default
                           value, generates output in the form "year-month-dateThour:minute:second".  A value of
                           <u>relative</u> returns only "hour:minute:second" if the current day.  For  other  dates  in
                           the  current  year  it  prints  the  "hour:minute"  preceded  by "Tomorr" (tomorrow),
                           "Ystday" (yesterday), the name of the day for the coming  week  (e.g.  "Mon",  "Tue",
                           etc.),  otherwise  the date (e.g. "25 Apr").  For other years it returns a date month
                           and year without a time (e.g.  "6 Jun 2012"). All of the time stamps use  a  24  hour
                           format.

                           A valid strftime() format can also be specified. For example, a value of "%a %T" will
                           report the day of the week and a time stamp (e.g. "Mon 12:34:56").

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>

       This  example  demonstrates  the  ability  to  customize  the output of the <b>sacct</b> command. The fields are
       displayed in the order designated on the command line.

              <b>#</b> <b>sacct</b> <b>--format=jobid,elapsed,ncpus,ntasks,state</b>
                   <b>Jobid</b>    <b>Elapsed</b>      <b>Ncpus</b>   <b>Ntasks</b>     <b>State</b>
              <b>----------</b> <b>----------</b> <b>----------</b> <b>--------</b> <b>----------</b>
              <b>3</b>            <b>00:01:30</b>          <b>2</b>        <b>1</b> <b>COMPLETED</b>
              <b>3.0</b>          <b>00:01:30</b>          <b>2</b>        <b>1</b> <b>COMPLETED</b>
              <b>4</b>            <b>00:00:00</b>          <b>2</b>        <b>2</b> <b>COMPLETED</b>
              <b>4.0</b>          <b>00:00:01</b>          <b>2</b>        <b>2</b> <b>COMPLETED</b>
              <b>5</b>            <b>00:01:23</b>          <b>2</b>        <b>1</b> <b>COMPLETED</b>
              <b>5.0</b>          <b>00:01:31</b>          <b>2</b>        <b>1</b> <b>COMPLETED</b>

       This example demonstrates the use of the -T (--truncate) option when used with -S  (--starttime)  and  -E
       (--endtime).  When the -T option is used, the start time of the job will be the specified -S value if the
       job was started before the specified time, otherwise the time will be the job's start time. The end  time
       will  be  the specified -E option if the job ends after the specified time, otherwise it will be the jobs
       end time.

       Without -T (normal operation) sacct output would be like this.

              <b>#</b> <b>sacct</b> <b>-S2014-07-03-11:40</b> <b>-E2014-07-03-12:00</b> <b>-X</b> <b>-ojobid,start,end,state</b>
                  <b>JobID</b>                 <b>Start</b>                  <b>End</b>        <b>State</b>
              <b>---------</b> <b>---------------------</b> <b>--------------------</b> <b>------------</b>
              <b>2</b>         <b>2014-07-03T11:33:16</b>   <b>2014-07-03T11:59:01</b>   <b>COMPLETED</b>
              <b>3</b>         <b>2014-07-03T11:35:21</b>   <b>Unknown</b>               <b>RUNNING</b>
              <b>4</b>         <b>2014-07-03T11:35:21</b>   <b>2014-07-03T11:45:21</b>   <b>COMPLETED</b>
              <b>5</b>         <b>2014-07-03T11:41:01</b>   <b>Unknown</b>               <b>RUNNING</b>

       By adding the -T option the job's start and end times are truncated to reflect only the  time  requested.
       If a job started after the start time requested or finished before the end time requested those times are
       not altered. The -T option is useful when determining exact run times during any given period.

              <b>#</b> <b>sacct</b> <b>-T</b> <b>-S2014-07-03-11:40</b> <b>-E2014-07-03-12:00</b> <b>-X</b> <b>-ojobid,jobname,user,start,end,state</b>
                  <b>JobID</b>                 <b>Start</b>                  <b>End</b>        <b>State</b>
              <b>---------</b> <b>---------------------</b> <b>--------------------</b> <b>------------</b>
              <b>2</b>         <b>2014-07-03T11:40:00</b>   <b>2014-07-03T11:59:01</b>   <b>COMPLETED</b>
              <b>3</b>         <b>2014-07-03T11:40:00</b>   <b>2014-07-03T12:00:00</b>   <b>RUNNING</b>
              <b>4</b>         <b>2014-07-03T11:40:00</b>   <b>2014-07-03T11:45:21</b>   <b>COMPLETED</b>
              <b>5</b>         <b>2014-07-03T11:41:01</b>   <b>2014-07-03T12:00:00</b>   <b>RUNNING</b>

       <b>NOTE</b>:  If no <b>-s</b> (<b>--state</b>) option is given sacct will display eligible jobs during the specified period of
       time, otherwise it will return jobs that were in the state requested during that period of time.

       This example demonstrates the differences running sacct with and without the <b>--state</b> flag  for  the  same
       time period. Without the <b>--state</b> option, all eligible jobs in that time period are shown.

              <b>#</b> <b>sacct</b> <b>-S11:20:00</b> <b>-E11:25:00</b> <b>-X</b> <b>-ojobid,start,end,state</b>
                     <b>JobID</b>               <b>Start</b>                 <b>End</b>      <b>State</b>
              <b>------------</b> <b>-------------------</b> <b>-------------------</b> <b>----------</b>
              <b>2955</b>                    <b>11:15:12</b>            <b>11:20:12</b>  <b>COMPLETED</b>
              <b>2956</b>                    <b>11:20:13</b>            <b>11:25:13</b>  <b>COMPLETED</b>

       With  the <b>--state=pending</b> option, only job 2956 will be shown because it had a dependency on 2955 and was
       still PENDING from 11:20:00 until it started at 11:21:13. Note that  even  though  we  requested  PENDING
       jobs, the State shows as COMPLETED because that is the current State of the job.

              <b>#</b> <b>sacct</b> <b>--state=pending</b> <b>-S11:20:00</b> <b>-E11:25:00</b> <b>-X</b> <b>-ojobid,start,end,state</b>
                     <b>JobID</b>               <b>Start</b>                 <b>End</b>      <b>State</b>
              <b>------------</b> <b>-------------------</b> <b>-------------------</b> <b>----------</b>
              <b>2956</b>                    <b>11:20:13</b>            <b>11:25:13</b>  <b>COMPLETED</b>
