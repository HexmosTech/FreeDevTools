</pre><h4><b>PROLOG</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       jobs — display status of jobs in the current session

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       jobs <b>[</b>-l|-p<b>]</b> <b>[</b><u>job_id</u>...<b>]</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>jobs</u> utility shall display the status of jobs that were started in the current shell environment; see
       <u>Section</u> <u>2.12</u>, <u>Shell</u> <u>Execution</u> <u>Environment</u>.

       When <u>jobs</u> reports the termination status of a job, the shell shall remove its process ID from the list of
       those ``known in the current shell execution environment''; see <u>Section</u> <u>2.9.3.1</u>, <u>Examples</u>.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>jobs</u>  utility  shall  conform  to the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <u>Section</u> <u>12.2</u>, <u>Utility</u>
       <u>Syntax</u> <u>Guidelines</u>.

       The following options shall be supported:

       <b>-l</b>        (The letter ell.) Provide more information  about  each  job  listed.  This  information  shall
                 include  the  job number, current job, process group ID, state, and the command that formed the
                 job.

       <b>-p</b>        Display only the process IDs for the process group leaders of the selected jobs.

       By default, the <u>jobs</u> utility shall display the status of all stopped jobs, running  background  jobs  and
       all jobs whose status has changed and have not been reported by the shell.

</pre><h4><b>OPERANDS</b></h4><pre>
       The following operand shall be supported:

       <u>job_id</u>    Specifies  the  jobs for which the status is to be displayed. If no <u>job_id</u> is given, the status
                 information for all jobs shall be displayed. The format of <u>job_id</u>  is  described  in  the  Base
                 Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <u>Section</u> <u>3.204</u>, <u>Job</u> <u>Control</u> <u>Job</u> <u>ID</u>.

</pre><h4><b>STDIN</b></h4><pre>
       Not used.

</pre><h4><b>INPUT</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of <u>jobs</u>:

       <u>LANG</u>      Provide a default value for the internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See the
                 Base  Definitions  volume  of POSIX.1‐2017, <u>Section</u> <u>8.2</u>, <u>Internationalization</u> <u>Variables</u> for the
                 precedence  of  internationalization  variables  used  to  determine  the  values   of   locale
                 categories.)

       <u>LC_ALL</u>    If  set  to a non-empty string value, override the values of all the other internationalization
                 variables.

       <u>LC_CTYPE</u>  Determine the locale for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of text  data  as  characters
                 (for example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments).

       <u>LC_MESSAGES</u>
                 Determine  the  locale  that  should  be  used  to affect the format and contents of diagnostic
                 messages written to standard error and informative messages written to standard output.

       <u>NLSPATH</u>   Determine the location of message catalogs for the processing of <u>LC_MESSAGES</u>.

</pre><h4><b>ASYNCHRONOUS</b> <b>EVENTS</b></h4><pre>
       Default.

</pre><h4><b>STDOUT</b></h4><pre>
       If the <b>-p</b> option is specified, the output shall consist of one line for each process ID:

           "%d\n", &lt;<u>process</u> <u>ID</u>&gt;

       Otherwise, if the <b>-l</b> option is not specified, the output shall be a series of lines of the form:

           "[%d] %c %s %s\n", &lt;<u>job-number</u>&gt;, &lt;<u>current</u>&gt;, &lt;<u>state</u>&gt;, &lt;<u>command</u>&gt;

       where the fields shall be as follows:

       &lt;<u>current</u>&gt; The character <b>'+'</b> identifies the job that would  be  used  as  a  default  for  the  <u>fg</u>  or  <u>bg</u>
                 utilities;  this  job  can  also  be  specified using the <u>job_id</u> %+ or <b>"%%"</b>.  The character <b>'-'</b>
                 identifies the job that would become the default if the current default job were to exit;  this
                 job  can  also  be  specified using the <u>job_id</u> %-. For other jobs, this field is a &lt;space&gt;.  At
                 most one job can be identified with <b>'+'</b> and at most one job can be  identified  with  <b>'-'</b>.   If
                 there  is  any  suspended  job,  then the current job shall be a suspended job. If there are at
                 least two suspended jobs, then the previous job also shall be a suspended job.

       &lt;<u>job-number</u>&gt;
                 A number that can be used to identify  the  process  group  to  the  <u>wait</u>,  <u>fg</u>,  <u>bg</u>,  and  <u>kill</u>
                 utilities.  Using  these  utilities, the job can be identified by prefixing the job number with
                 <b>'%'</b>.

       &lt;<u>state</u>&gt;   One of the following strings (in the POSIX locale):

                 <b>Running</b>   Indicates that the job has not been suspended by a signal and has not exited.

                 <b>Done</b>      Indicates that the job completed and returned exit status zero.

                 <b>Done</b>(<u>code</u>)
                           Indicates that the job completed normally and that it exited with the specified  non-
                           zero exit status, <u>code</u>, expressed as a decimal number.

                 <b>Stopped</b>   Indicates that the job was suspended by the SIGTSTP signal.

                 <b>Stopped</b> (<b>SIGTSTP</b>)
                           Indicates that the job was suspended by the SIGTSTP signal.

                 <b>Stopped</b> (<b>SIGSTOP</b>)
                           Indicates that the job was suspended by the SIGSTOP signal.

                 <b>Stopped</b> (<b>SIGTTIN</b>)
                           Indicates that the job was suspended by the SIGTTIN signal.

                 <b>Stopped</b> (<b>SIGTTOU</b>)
                           Indicates that the job was suspended by the SIGTTOU signal.

                 The  implementation  may  substitute  the string <b>Suspended</b> in place of <b>Stopped</b>.  If the job was
                 terminated by a signal, the format of &lt;<u>state</u>&gt; is unspecified, but it shall be visibly  distinct
                 from  all of the other &lt;<u>state</u>&gt; formats shown here and shall indicate the name or description of
                 the signal causing the termination.

       &lt;<u>command</u>&gt; The associated command that was given to the shell.

       If the <b>-l</b> option is specified, a field containing the process group  ID  shall  be  inserted  before  the
       &lt;<u>state</u>&gt;  field.  Also,  more processes in a process group may be output on separate lines, using only the
       process ID and &lt;<u>command</u>&gt; fields.

</pre><h4><b>STDERR</b></h4><pre>
       The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.

</pre><h4><b>OUTPUT</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>EXTENDED</b> <b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       The following exit values shall be returned:

        0    Successful completion.

       &gt;0    An error occurred.

</pre><h4><b>CONSEQUENCES</b> <b>OF</b> <b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       Default.

       <u>The</u> <u>following</u> <u>sections</u> <u>are</u> <u>informative.</u>

</pre><h4><b>APPLICATION</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>-p</b> option is the only portable way to  find  out  the  process  group  of  a  job  because  different
       implementations have different strategies for defining the process group of the job. Usage such as $(<u>jobs</u>
       <b>-p</b>) provides a way of referring to the process group of the job in an implementation-independent way.

       The  <u>jobs</u> utility does not work as expected when it is operating in its own utility execution environment
       because that environment has no applicable jobs to manipulate. See the APPLICATION USAGE section for  <u>bg</u>.
       For this reason, <u>jobs</u> is generally implemented as a shell regular built-in.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>RATIONALE</b></h4><pre>
       Both  <b>"%%"</b>  and  <b>"%+"</b>  are  used  to  refer to the current job. Both forms are of equal validity—the <b>"%%"</b>
       mirroring <b>"$$"</b> and <b>"%+"</b> mirroring the output of <u>jobs</u>.  Both forms  reflect  historical  practice  of  the
       KornShell and the C shell with job control.

       The job control features provided by <u>bg</u>, <u>fg</u>, and <u>jobs</u> are based on the KornShell. The standard developers
       examined the characteristics of the C shell versions of these utilities and found that differences exist.
       Despite  widespread  use  of  the  C  shell,  the  KornShell  versions  were  selected for this volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017 to maintain a degree of uniformity with the rest of the KornShell features selected (such as
       the very popular command line editing features).

       The <u>jobs</u> utility is not dependent on the job control option, as are  the  seemingly  related  <u>bg</u>  and  <u>fg</u>
       utilities  because  <u>jobs</u>  is  useful  for  examining  background jobs, regardless of the condition of job
       control. When the user has invoked a <u>set</u> <b>+m</b> command and job control has been turned off, <u>jobs</u>  can  still
       be  used to examine the background jobs associated with that current session. Similarly, <u>kill</u> can then be
       used to kill background jobs with <u>kill</u> %&lt;<u>background</u> <u>job</u> <u>number</u>&gt;.

       The output for terminated jobs is  left  unspecified  to  accommodate  various  historical  systems.  The
       following formats have been witnessed:

        1. <b>Killed</b>(<u>signal</u> <u>name</u>)

        2. <u>signal</u> <u>name</u>

        3. <u>signal</u> <u>name</u>(<b>coredump</b>)

        4. <u>signal</u> <u>description</u>- <b>core</b> <b>dumped</b>

       Most  users  should be able to understand these formats, although it means that applications have trouble
       parsing them.

       The calculation of job IDs was not described since this would suggest an implementation, which may impose
       unnecessary restrictions.

       In an early proposal, a <b>-n</b> option was included to ``Display the status of jobs that have changed, exited,
       or stopped since the last status report''. It was removed because the shell  always  writes  any  changed
       status of jobs before each prompt.
