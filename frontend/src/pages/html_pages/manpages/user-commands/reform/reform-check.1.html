       reform-check - check your setup

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>reform-check</b> [<u>--help</u>] [<u>--mirror={mntre.com,reform.debian.net}</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This script checks the integrity of your MNT reform setup. It is meant for two main use-cases:

              1. somebody has a problem with their reform and to debug the problem it

              would be useful to know how their system differs from the default

              2. somebody installed their system several months ago and now wants to find

              out which things have since been added or changed in the defaults that they might want to apply to
              their running setup as well

       Running  this  script  as  non-root will give you a diff between the files in <u><a href="file:/etc/skel">/etc/skel</a></u> and those in your
       $HOME. Running this script as root performs the system-wide checks.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--help</b> Display this help and exit.

       <b>--mirror</b>=<u>MIRROR</u>
              Force MIRROR, either mntre.com or reform.debian.net
