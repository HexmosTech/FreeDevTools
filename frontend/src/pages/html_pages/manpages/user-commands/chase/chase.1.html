</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Chase</b> is a small utility that tracks down the name of the actual file that is truly  accessed,  when  one
       hits a symbolic link.  It chases the link, so to speak.

       In normal operation, you give <b>chase</b> a name of an existing file.  The program will then show you (or, more
       accurately,  print  to  the  standard  output  stream)  the  name of the real file that the original file
       referred to.  It does not matter if you give the program the name of a regular file; <b>chase</b> will just give
       you the same name back.  You can give the utility the option <b>--verbose</b>, in  order  to  have  it  be  more
       verbose in its operation.  You can also give the program a list of files from which it will read the file
       names to be chased (see the option <b>--from-file).</b>

       I'll  give  you  a  good example of a case where <b>chase</b> is useful.  In a Debian GNU/Linux system, software
       installation is handled by the program <b><a href="../man8/dpkg.8.html">dpkg</a></b>(8).  There is a way to query <b><a href="../man8/dpkg.8.html">dpkg</a></b>(8), which  package  a  file
       belongs  to.   Unfortunately,  this  does not not grok all symlinks.  This is a problem, since the Debian
       system uses symbolic links extensively for handling several flavours of a program (say,  XEmacs  and  GNU
       Emacs  and  the  versions 19 and 20 of both).  Now with <b>chase,</b> one can determine the real file easily and
       then using this result as an argument to <b><a href="../man8/dpkg.8.html">dpkg</a></b>(8).  Observe:

       ajk@ugh:~$ dpkg -S `which xemacs20`
       dpkg: /usr/bin/xemacs20 not found.
       ajk@ugh:~$ dpkg -S `which xemacs20 | xargs chase`
       xemacs20-nomule: /usr/bin/xemacs-20.4-nomule
       ajk@ugh:~$

       When given multiple file names as arguments, <b>chase</b> will chase every one of them in order.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The following options are recognized by <b>chase</b>:

       --verbose
              Chat about what is being done.

       -f, --from-file
              Treat the file names on the command line as sources for names to be chased.   If  this  option  is
              present,  <b>chase</b> will read in each of the files given on the command line (both a sole dash "-" and
              the absence of file names will be taken as meaning the standard input stream).  Each line  in  the
              files  is  taken as a verbatim file name that will be chased like it had been given on the command
              line of a run without this option.  There is no means for quoting the newline character; therefore
              only file names that do not contain newlines can be specified via the files.  This restriction  is
              lifted by the -0 option, though.  However, literal spaces are preserved and are not interpreted as
              special.

       -0, --null
              This option implies the option -f, which reads file names from a file.  The -0 option modifies the
              behavior  -f  so  that  instead  of  treating  lines in the file as file names, the file names are
              expected to be separated by null characters.  This allows for specifying file names with  newlines
              in them with -f.

       -w WCOUNT, --loop-warn-threshold=WCOUNT

       -l LCOUNT, --loop-fail-threshold=LCOUNT
              Set  the  threshold  for warning about a possible symlink loop (WCOUNT) and for failing because of
              one (LCOUNT).  There are default values, which you  can  find  out  by  invoking  <b>chase</b>  with  the
              argument --help.  Using zero as WCOUNT or LCOUNT disables the check.

       -D, --disable-loop-detection
              Normally  <b>chase</b>  keeps  a record of all symlinks it has visited when chasing the current file.  It
              uses this record to reliably detect symlink loops.  However, checking the record slows the process
              a little (more for long chains of symlinks) and the record requires a small amount of memory (more
              for long chains of symlinks), so it may be desirable in some cases to inhibit  this  check.   This
              option  disables  this loop detection and the associated recording of visited symlinks.  When this
              option is in effect (assuming no bugs in the related code) <b>chase</b> runs in constant space and linear
              time relative to the length of the symlink chains encountered.

       -h, --help
              Output a usage summary and exit successfully.

       -v, --version
              Show version information and exit successfully.

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       The exit status is 0 if and only if all files given in the command lines  exist  and  none  of  them  are
       dangling symlinks.

       The following messages are emitted by <b>chase</b> when it suspects or detects a symlink loop:

       quite many symlink hops, hope we're not looping...
              This  means  that  the chain of symlinks is longer than a given threshold.  This may mean that the
              chain is infinite (and thus contains a loop somewhere).  The threshold can be specified  by  using
              the --loop-warn-threshold command line option.

       too many symlink hops, giving up...
              This  means  that the chain of symlinks is longer than a given threshold.  This usually means that
              the chain is infinite (and thus contains a loop somewhere).  The threshold  can  be  specified  by
              using the --loop-fail-threshold command line option.  If you see this message, it means that <b>chase</b>
              has given up on that file.

       symlink loop detected, giving up...
              The  symlink  chain is looping and therefore there is no result for the chase.  <b>Chase</b> has given up
              on that file.

       Additionally, <b>Chase</b> emits several error messages under problematic conditions.  They all  come  from  the
       system libraries, so the program has no control over the actual wording of the messages.  They all follow
       the format "program name: file name: error message", where file name is the name of the offending file or
       directory.

       Debian bugtracking system.
