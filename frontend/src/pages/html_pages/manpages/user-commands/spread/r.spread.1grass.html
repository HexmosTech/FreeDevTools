       <b>r.spread</b>  - Simulates elliptically anisotropic spread.
       Generates a raster map of the cumulative time of spread, given raster maps containing the rates of spread
       (ROS),  the ROS directions and the spread origins. It optionally produces raster maps to contain backlink
       UTM coordinates for tracing spread paths. Usable for fire spread simulations.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>r.spread</u> is part of the wildfire simulation toolset. Preparational steps for the fire simulation are  the
       calculation  of  the  rate  of  spread  (ROS)  with  <u>r.ros</u>, and the creating of spread map with <u>r.spread</u>.
       Eventually, the fire path(s) based on starting point(s) are calculated with <u>r.spreadpath</u>.

       Spread phenomena usually show uneven movement over space. Such unevenness is due to two reasons:

       <b>1</b>      the uneven conditions from location to location, which can be called <u>spatial</u> <u>heterogeneity</u>, and

       <b>2</b>      the uneven conditions in different directions, which can be called <u>anisotropy</u>.

       The anisotropy of spread occurs when any of the determining  factors  have  directional  components.  For
       example, wind and topography cause anisotropic spread of wildfires.

       One  of  the  simplest  spatial heterogeneous and anisotropic spread is elliptical spread, in which, each
       local spread shape can be thought as an ellipse. In a raster setting, cell centers are foci of the spread
       ellipses, and the spread phenomenon moves fastest toward apogees and slowest to perigees. The  sizes  and
       shapes of spread ellipses may vary cell by cell.  So the overall spread shape is commonly not an ellipse.

       <u>r.spread</u>simulates  elliptically  anisotropic  spread  phenomena,  given three raster map layers about ROS
       (base ROS, maximum ROS and direction of the maximum ROS) plus a raster map  layer  showing  the  starting
       sources.   These  ROS  layers  define unique ellipses for all cell locations in the current computational
       region as if each cell center was a potential spread origin.  For some wildfire spread, these ROS  layers
       can  be  generated  by another GRASS raster program r.ros. The actual locations reached by a spread event
       are constrained by the actual spread origins and the elapsed spread time.

       <u>r.spread</u>optionally produces raster maps to contain backlink UTM coordinates for each raster cell  of  the
       spread  time  map.  The  spread  paths  can  be  accurately  traced  based on the backlink information by
       <u>r.spreadpath</u> module.

       Part of the spotting function in r.spread is based on Chase (1984) and Rothermel (1983). More information
       on <u>r.spread</u>, <u>r.ros</u> and <u>r.spreadpath</u> can be found in Xu (1994).

       Options spot_dist, w_speed and f_mois must all be given if the -s (spotting) flag is used.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLE</b></h4><pre>
       Assume we have inputs, the following simulates a spotting- involved wildfire and generates  three  raster
       maps to contain spread time, backlink information in UTM northing and easting coordinates:
       r.spread -s max=my_ros.max dir=my_ros.maxdir base=my_ros.base \
           start=fire_origin spot_dist=my_ros.spotdist w_speed=wind_speed \
           f_mois=1hour_moisture output=my_spread \
           x_output=my_spread.x y_output=my_spread.y

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       1.  <u>r.spread</u>  is  a  specific  implementation of the shortest path algorithm. <u>r.cost</u> module served as the
       starting point for the development of <u>r.spread</u>.  One of the major differences between the two programs is
       that <u>r.cost</u> only simulates <u>isotropic</u> spread while <u>r.spread</u> can simulate <u>elliptically</u> <u>anisotropic</u>  spread,
       including isotropic spread as a special case.

       2.  Before  running  r.spread,  the  user  should  prepare  the  ROS (base, max and direction) maps using
       appropriate models. For some wildfire spread, the <u>r.ros</u> module based on Rothermel’s  fire  equation  does
       such work.  The combination of the two forms a simulation of wildfire spread.

       3.  The relationship of the start map and ROS maps should be logically correct, i.e. a starting source (a
       positive value in the start map) should not be located in a spread <u>barrier</u> (zero value in the ROS  maps).
       Otherwise the program refuses to run.

       4.  <u>r.spread</u> uses the current computational region settings. The output map layer will not go outside the
       boundaries set in the region, and will not be influenced by starting sources outside. So  any  change  of
       the  current  region  may  influence the output. The recommendation is to use slightly larger region than
       needed.  Refer to <u>g.region</u> to set an appropriate computational region.

       5. The user should be sure that the inputs to <u>r.spread</u> are in proper units.

       6. <u>r.spread</u> is a computationally intensive program. The user may need to choose appropriate size  of  the
       computational region and resolution.

       7.  A  low  and  medium  (i.e.  &lt;=  0.5)  sampling density can improve accuracy for elliptical simulation
       significantly, without adding significantly extra running time. Further  increasing  the  sample  density
       will not gain much accuracy while requiring greatly additional running time.
