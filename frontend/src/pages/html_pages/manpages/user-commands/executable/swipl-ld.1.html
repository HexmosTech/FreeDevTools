       swipl-ld - Create a SWI-Prolog embedded executable

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>swipl-ld</b> <b>options</b> <b>c-files</b> <b>o-files</b> <b>pl-files</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The utility <b>swipl-ld</b> is a front-end for the C-compiler and linker to create a stand-alone executable from
       a  series  of C/C++ and Prolog input files. It extracts information from the SWI-Prolog executable <b>swipl,</b>
       after which it scans the arguments and breaks them into several categories.  It then calls the C-compiler
       to create an executable containing the user's C-code and the SWI-Prolog kernel.  After this, it will call
       the development environment to create a Prolog saved state from the prolog  files  and  finally  it  will
       create  the  target executable by concatenating the state to the emulator.  See also <b>qsave_program/2</b> from
       the <b>SWI-Prolog</b> <b>manual.</b>

   <b>Options</b>
       <b>-pl</b> <u>prolog</u>
              Specifies the prolog version to use.  The default is <b>swipl.</b>  This  flag  may  be  used  to  choose
              between different versions installed on your system, or to specify a modified version.  A modified
              version should understands the flags <b>-dump-runtime-variables</b> <b>-f</b> <u>file</u> <b>-F</b> <u>file</u> <b>-g</b> <u>goal</u> <b>-t</b> <u>toplevel</u><b>.</b>

       <b>-help</b>  Shows options briefly

       <b>-nostate</b>
              Just  relinks  the  kernel.   The  newly  linked  kernel  can only function in the presence of the
              development system.  Any supplied prolog sourcefiles are ignored, and so  are  the  options  <b>-goal</b>
              <b>-toplevel</b>  <b>-initfile.</b>   <b>-class</b>  This  is the preferred way to attach external modules to Prolog if
              dynamic loading is not supported on your system.

       <b>-c</b>     Compile C or C++ source-files into object files.  This turns <b>swipl-ld</b> into a replacement for the C
              or C++ compiler where proper options such as the location of  the  include  directory  are  passed
              automatically to the compiler.

       <b>-E</b>     Invoke the C preprocessor.  Used to make <b>swipl-ld</b> a replacement for the C or C++ compiler.

       <b>-shared</b>
              Link   C,   C++  or  object  files  into  a  shared  object  (DLL)  that  can  be  loaded  by  the
              <u>load_foreign_library/1</u> predicate.  If used with <b>-c</b> it sets the proper options to compile  a  C  or
              C++ file ready for linking into a shared object.

       <b>-embed-shared</b>
              Embed SWI-Prolog into a DLL/Shared object rather than an executable.  See the reference manual for
              details.

       <b>-dll</b>   <u>Windows</u> <u>only</u> Same as <b>-embed-shared</b> Backward compatibility.

       <b>-F</b> <u>base</u>
              By  default, <u>none</u> is passed to the swipl command to create the saved state.  Using <u>-F</u> <u>xpce</u> you can
              specify loading <u>xpce.rc</u>, making XPCE available to the saved state.

       <b>-goal</b> <u>goal</u>
              The goal that is initially executed when the toplevel is started using  <b>PL_toplevel()</b>.   E.i.  the
              default.  <b>-g</b> flag for the new executable.

       <b>-toplevel</b> <u>goal</u>
              The  goal  that  is  executed  as  the main toplevel goal.  E.i. the default.  <b>-t</b> flag for the new
              executable.

       <b>-initfile</b> <u>file</u>
              The file that is loaded by the toplevel.  E.i. the default.  <b>-f</b> flag for the new executable.

       <b>-class</b> <u>{runtime,kernel,development}</u>
              Set the save-class of the Prolog saved-state that is created.  If <b>runtime</b> (default), the resulting
              system leave interpretation of all arguments to the application.  If <b>kernel</b> all predicates will be
              locked for the tracer.  Finally, if <b>development</b> the state  is  saved  `as-is'  and  the  resulting
              system  processes  options just as the basic SWI-Prolog executable does.  See also <b>qsave_program/2</b>
              in the <u>SWI-Prolog</u> <u>reference</u> <u>manual</u>.

       <b>-v</b>     Verbose operation.  This echos the commands before executing them.  Note that  some  commands  are
              printed  as  shell  commands,  but actually executed by swipl-ld itself for compatibility with the
              Win32 platforms.

       <b>-f</b>     Fake operation.  Together with <b>-v</b> this prints the  commands  that  need  to  be  executed  without
              actually doing anything.

       <b>-E</b><u>cppargument</u> <u>...</u>
              If  the first option is <b>-E</b>, all subsequent options are appended and handed to the program selected
              by SWI-Prolog configure to run <b>cpp</b>.

       <b>-o</b> <u>file</u>
              Specifies the name of the final executable.  The default is <b>a.out.</b>

       <b>-cc</b> <u>C-compiler</u>
              Specify the compiler to use for <b>*.c</b> files.  Default is the compiler  used  to  compile  SWI-Prolog
              itself, as read from the feature <b>c_cc.</b>

       <b>-c++</b> <u>C++-compiler</u>
              Specify  the compiler to use for C++ input files.  If the C-compiler is <b>gcc</b> this is <b>g++,</b> otherwise
              <b>c++</b> is assumed.

       <b>-ld</b> <u>linker</u>
              Specifies the linker to use.  Default is the C-compiler.   On  Win32  platforms,  the  default  is
              <b>link.exe.</b>

       <b>-l</b><u>library</u>
              Specifies  a  C-library for linking the application.  By default, <b>-lswipl</b> as well as the libraries
              required by the SWI-Prolog kernel will be passed to the C-compiler.

       <b>-L</b><u>library-directory</u>
              Specifies an additional library directory for the C-compiler.  By default, the  runtime  directory
              for the current architecture is passed.

       <b>-g|-I*|-D*|-U*|-O*|-W*</b>
              Passed  to  the  compiler  as  c-flags.  By default, the SWI-Prolog include directory is passed as
              additional include directory.  The following -D flags are added by swipl-ld: -D__SWI_PROLOG__  and
              -D__SWI_EMBEDDED__.

       <b>-pl-options*</b>
              Specify  additional  options  for <b>swipl.</b>  The first character following <b>-pl-options</b> determines the
              option-separator.  The remainder of the argument is split using this separator and the  parts  are
              added to the option list for Prolog.  See also <b>-cc-options</b> <u>and</u> <b>-ld-options</b>

       <b>-ld-options*</b>
              Additional options passed to the linker.  For example: <b>-ld-options,-Bstatic</b>

       <b>-cc-options*</b>
              Additional options passed to both C- and C++-compiler.

       <b>*.o</b>    Passed as input files to the linker.

       <b>*.c</b>    Compiled  using  the  C-compiler, after which the object-file is passed to the linker.  The object
              file is deleted at cleanup.

       <b>*.cc|*.C|*.cxx|*.cpp</b>
              Compiled using the C++-compiler, after which the object-file is passed to the linker.  The  object
              file is deleted at cleanup.

       <b>*.pl|*.qlf</b>
              Passed as Prolog input files

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Parsing  the options and distributing them over the various programs is probably incomplete. Feel free to
       modify it and please forward generally useful modifications to <b><a href="mailto:bugs@swi-prolog.org">bugs@swi-prolog.org</a>.</b>

       Some care has to be taken that the state created with <b>qsave_program/2</b> is self-contained (i.e. contains no
       references to the Prolog libraries).  Also, as the state is created  using  the  development  environment
       rather  then  the user's emulator, the Prolog code cannot use directives that rely on the C-code added by
       the user.
