       <b>LRS</b> - Toolset for LRS (Linear Referencing System)

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       A  Linear  Referencing  System  (LRS)  is a system where features (points or segments) are localized by a
       measure along a linear element.  The LRS can be used to  reference  events  for  any  network  of  linear
       features,  for  example roads, railways, rivers, pipelines, electric and telephone lines, water and sewer
       networks. An event is defined in LRS by a route ID and a measure. A route  is  a  path  on  the  network,
       usually composed from more features in the input map.  Events can be either points or lines (segments).

       LRS  is  created  from  input lines and points in vector map.  Points - MP (mileposts) must have attached
       attributes specifying line and distance.  The distances from the beginning of the linear feature in  real
       world are specified by MP+offset.  Typically, MP is in kilometers and offset in meters.

       The implementation of LRS in GRASS has some particularities.

   <b>Double</b> <b>referenced</b> <b>system</b>
       This  feature  gives  a possibility to continue to use most of old mileposts if only small part of linear
       object in real world has changed. Example:
       --- road (linear feature)
        +   MP (milepost, point, distance from the beginning in km)
       Old situation:
       +----+----+----+----+----+
       0    2    3    4    5    6
       New situation (for example a new bypass around the village)
                 ?    ?
                 +----+
                 |    |
                 |    |
       +----+----+    +----+----+
       0    2    3    4    5    6
       The segment between km 3 and 4 is now longer, it is now 3 km not 1 km as in  old  version.  It  would  be
       expensive  to  change  also  all  MP  &gt;=  4, but we cannot use km 4 twice.  It is possible to use another
       notation for the new segment, we reference the segment from the kilometer 3, using only offset.
             3+1000  3+2000
                 +----+
                 |    |
                 |    |
       +----+----+    +----+----+
       0    2    3  3+3000 5    6
                      4
       This way, there is no ambiguity and minimal changes are needed.  But the MP 4  is  no  more  the  end  of
       segment  3 - 4 but the end of segment 3+2000 - 3+3000. This information must be entered to the system and
       it is done by optional MP attributes:

           •   end_mp - end MP

           •   end_off - end offset
       In this case original MP on km 4 will have these attributes:
       start_mp:  4
       start_off: 0
       end_mp:    3
       end_off:   3000
       Because each MP can keep 2 values (start, end) it is called ’double’ referenced LRS.

       To avoid potential confusion, MP values are limited to integers only.  It would be ambiguous to have  for
       example  segments 3.500 - 3.500+200 and 3.600 - 3.600+200. The position 3+650 would fall into 2 segments,
       correct would be 3.600+50.  That means, that MP must be the beginning of antonomous segment and all parts
       which becomes longer then before must be referenced from the last not changed MP.

       The MP <u>start_mp</u> and <u>end_mp</u> columns must be decimal, but <u>v.lrs.create</u> takes only  the  decimal  part,  and
       adds its value to offset and prints a warning.

       It  is  highly  recommended  to  work  with  polylines  instead  of  segmented  vector lines. The command
       <u>v.build.polylines</u> creates this map structure.

   <b>Available</b> <b>commands</b>
           •   v.lrs.create to create a linear referencing system,

           •   v.lrs.label to create stationing on the LRS,

           •   v.lrs.segment to create points/segments on LRS, and

           •   v.lrs.where  to  find  line  id  and  real  km+offset for given points in vector map using linear
               referencing system.

   <b>Input</b> <b>lines</b> <b>for</b> <b>v.lrs.segment</b> <b>and</b> <b>v.lrs.label</b>
       <u>v.lrs.create</u> joins all connected lines of the same line ID into one  line,  the  LRS  library  and  other
       modules  using  LRS expect this!  LR_get_nearest_offset in the LRS library checks duplicate segments only
       by line_cat and map_offset, not by coordinates in map.

   <b>Duplicate</b> <b>positions</b>
       It can happen that one offset appears on 2 different lines:
       ------1-------     --------2------
       +0.0            +1.0              +2.0
       In this case, the module gives error because the position results in 2 points.

       It can be also intended, for example a part of the road is shared with another one, but MP are used  only
       for one:
        + road1/km15         + road1/km22
         \                  /
          \ road1/km17     / road1/km20
           +--------------+
          / road2/km52     \ road2/km52
         /                  \
        + road2/km50         + road2/km54
