       ries - find algebraic equations, given their solution

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ries</b>  [<b>-l</b><u>n</u>]  [<b>-i[e]</b>]  [<b>-s</b>]  [<b>-x</b>]  [<b>-F</b><u>n</u>]  [<b>-S</b><u>sss</u>] [<b>-N</b><u>sss</u>] [<b>-O</b><u>sss</u>] [<b>-D</b><u>xxx</u>] [<b>-p</b><u>filename</u>] [<b>--extended-options</b>

       <b>ries</b> <b>--find-expression</b> [<u>expression</u> [...]]

       <b>ries</b> <b>--eval-expression</b> [<u>expression</u> [...]]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Given a number, <b>ries</b> searches for algebraic equations in one variable that have a  solution  (root)  near
       that  number. It avoids trivial or reducible solutions like ``<u>x</u>/<u>x</u> = 1''. If <u>value</u> is an integer, <b>ries</b> can
       find an exact solution expressed in terms of single-digit integers.

       For example, if you supply the value 2.5063, the first part of <b>ries</b>'s output will resemble the following:

         $ ries 2.5063

             Your target value: T = 2.5063              mrob.com/ries

                     2 x = 5              for x = T - 0.0063       {49}
                     8 x = e^3            for x = T + 0.00439212   {66}
                     x^2 = 2 pi           for x = T + 0.000328275  {55}
                     x^x = 1+9            for x = T - 0.000115854  {69}
                   x^2+e = 9              for x = T + 3.56063e-05  {63}
                 <a href="../man6/ln.6.html">ln</a>(6) x = sqrt(pi)+e     for x = T + 2.73037e-05  {93}
                   x/4+1 = 4,/7           for x = T + 6.24679e-06  {91}
          sinpi(ln(x))^2 = 1/(5 pi)       for x = T + 2.75665e-06  {92}

       The output gives progressively ``more complex'' solutions (as described below)  that  come  progressively
       closer  to  matching  your  number.  There  are  four columns: equations in symbolic form (two columns of
       expressions with '=' in the middle), solution of equation (value of <u>x</u> expressed as <u>T</u> plus a  small  error
       term), and total complexity score (described below).

       Each match is checked by solving for <u>x</u> using the Newton-Raphson method, and the closeness of the match is
       judged  by  the  difference  between the root (the value of <u>x</u> for which the two sides are equal) and your
       target value <u>T</u>.

       Options allow complete control over what symbols, constants and functions are used in  solutions,  or  to
       limit solutions to integer, rational, constuctible, or algebraic values.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Options must be separate: `ries -l1 -i -Ox 27', not `ries -l1iOx 27'.

       <b>-p</b><u>name</u> Profile  (or  Parameters):  Load  one  or  more  options  from  file <u>name</u>. <b>-p</b><u>name</u> is equivalent to
              <b>--include</b> <u>name</u>, which is described in the EXTENDED OPTIONS section below.  <b>-p</b> alone (with no <u>name</u>)
              has special meanings, also described under <b>--include</b>.

       <b>-l</b><u>n</u>    Level: Specifies the level of the search (default 2).  With each increment of <b>-l</b>, <b>ries</b> will search
              about 10 times as many equations, use 3.5 times as much memory and take at least 4 times as  long.
              Use  higher  levels to add more factors of 10.  The level can be fractional or negative.  Here are
              typical figures, measured on a Core i7 at 3.2 GHz (using only one thread) invoked by  the  command
              <b>ries</b> <b>-l</b><u>n</u> <b>2.5063141592653589</b> for different values of searchlevel <u>n</u>:

                         memory    equations tested  digits    run time
                     -l0  1.2M           89,400,000    6+       0.025 sec
                     -l1  4.0M          932,000,000    7+       0.08 sec
                     -l2  14 M       11,400,000,000    8+       0.33 sec
                     -l3  45 M      134,000,000,000    9+       1.8 sec
                     -l4  158M    1,600,000,000,000   11+       8.8 sec
                     -l5  490M   15,000,000,000,000   12+      37.1 sec
                     -l6  1.7G  184,000,000,000,000   13+      190 sec

              (these  times  are  a little quicker than a 2.33-GHz Core 2 Duo; on a 733-MHz Pentium 3, the times
              were about 5 times longer. If compiled for an  environment  with  32-bit  pointers,  memory  usage
              figures  are  about  20%  lower.   <b>ries</b> also works on much older and smaller systems, and can test
              billions of equations in less than a minute on 1990's hardware)

              Use a fractional argument (like <b>-l5.5</b>) for more precise control of how much memory <b>ries</b>  will  use
              before stopping its search.  When free memory is exhausted; performance will degrade significantly
              and  <b>ries</b>  might  exit,  depending  on  your  operating system. Under Linux and Mac OS, <b>ries</b> keeps
              running but the system slows to a crawl.  If you don't know what  your  OS  will  do,  be  careful
              before  running <b>ries</b> with higher levels. In extreme cases your computer's response might slow down
              so much that you are unable to save your work in other applications.

              The memory limits are not reached nearly as quickly when the symbolset is greatly limited with <b>-S</b>,
              <b>-O</b> and <b>-N</b> or when <b>-i</b> is specified. <b>-i</b> in particular should allow about  two  more  levels  in  any
              given amount of memory. Large arguments tend to lengthen runtime: for example, ries -l4 1058073667
              takes about three times as long as ries -l4 1.058073667.

</pre><h4><b>Options</b> <b>to</b> <b>Select</b> <b>Symbols</b></h4><pre>
       Several  options  are used to choose which symbols (constants, operations, and functions) <b>ries</b> is allowed
       to use when searching for equations.

       <b>-N</b><u>sss</u>  Never use these: <b>-N</b> followed by one or more characters specifies symbols (constants and operators)
              that <b>ries</b> should not use in its equations. The symbols are as follows:

              1-9    The integers 1 through 9. (<b>ries</b> constructs all larger integers from combinations of these.)

              p      pi = 3.14159...

              e      e = 2.71828...

              f      phi = (1+<a href="../man5/sqrt.5.html">sqrt</a>(5))/2 = 1.61803...

              n      Negative

              r      Reciprocal

              s      Squared

              q      Square root

              S C    Sine, Cosine

              T      Tangent

              l      ln (natural logarithm, also called log)

              E      e to the power of x

              + -    Add, Subtract

              * /    Multiply, Divide

              ^      Power: 2 ^ 3 = 8

              v      Root (the ``v'' resembles part of the radical symbol): 3 v 27 = cube root of 27

              L      Logarithm to base A of B

              W      Lambert W function. Only available if using the stand-alone maths library, described in the
                     section ``STAND-ALONE MATHS LIBRARY'' below. In addition, one  must  explicitly  choose  it
                     with <b>-EW</b>.

              There  are  lots  of  potential uses for <b>-N</b>. For example, if you invoke <b>ries</b> on a small irrational
              number, you might get several solutions that involve the unary and binary logarithm operators 'ln'
              (natural logarithm) and 'log_' (log to base A of B). If you decide you aren't interested  in  such
              solutions you can just add <b>-NlL</b> to your command line, and all such solutions will be skipped.

              If  you  are  checking an unknown number that you found in the context of some larger problem, you
              probably have some idea what constants and operators may be involved,  or  not  involved,  in  the
              phenomenon that produced your number. Use <b>-N</b> to rule out functions you don't think are relevant.

              Note  that  <b>ries</b>  will  often  run  considerably  slower  when you limit it to a very small set of
              symbols, mainly because it cannot use its optimization rules (described  below  under  ALGORITHM).
              Also,  with  fewer  symbols the average length of expressions is longer, and that makes the search
              slower.

       <b>-S</b><u>sss</u>  permitted Symbol Set: Specifies a symbol set, as with <b>-N</b>, but has the opposite effect: <u>only</u>  these
              symbols  will be used. A <b>-S</b> also cancels any <b>-E</b>, <b>-N</b> or <b>-O</b> options that were given; meaning that if
              you wish to combine these options, the <b>-S</b> should come first.

              <b>-S</b> can be used to solve those old problems of the sort ``How can the number 27 be expressed  using
              only the four basic operators and the digit 4?'' The answer is given by:

                  ries '-S4+-*/' 27 -Ox

              (The  <b>-Ox</b> option is described next).  To solve the same problem using the <b>-N</b> option, you'd have to
              type:

                  ries -Npef12356789rsqlL^v 27 -Ox

              If you give the <b>-S</b> option with no symbols, <b>ries</b> will display a table of all available symbols  (as
              modified  by any <b>-E</b>, <b>-N</b>, <b>-O</b> and <b>-S</b> options) with their definition and weights. This lone <b>-S</b> can be
              given along with a normal <b>-S</b> option, but in any case <b>ries</b> will exit after showing the table.

       <b>-E</b><u>sss</u>  Enable: Enables (or re-enables) the use of symbols that may have been disabled by an earlier <b>-S</b> or
              <b>-N</b> option. This is mainly intended for use in  combination  with  the  <b>--include</b>  option.  If  one
              include  file  disables some symbols, this option can be used to re-enable some or all of them. It
              is also required for use of the Lambert W function, which is disabled  by  default.  See  ``STAND-
              ALONE  MATHS  LIBRARY''  for  instructions  and use the option <b>-EW</b> to request use of the Lambert W
              function in a <b>ries</b> command.

       <b>-O</b><u>sss</u>  Only One: Specifies symbols which should appear no more than once on <u>each</u> <u>side</u>  of  the  equation.
              This option can be combined with <b>-E</b> or <b>-N</b>, in which case they augment each other.  If used with <b>-S</b>
              with the same symbol, the latter option takes effect.

              One additional symbol is available with <b>-O</b>:

                   x      The variable on the left-hand-side

              Thus,  you  can use <b>-Ox</b> to limit <b>ries</b>'s output to equations that have only one '<u>x</u>' in them and are
              therefore easy to solve for <u>x</u> using only the most  basic  algebra  techniques.   This  also  makes
              <b>ries</b>'s output more like that of traditional expression-finders, which search for expressions equal
              to  <u>x</u> rather than equations in <u>x</u>. Here's an example: ries -i 16 gives the answer ``<u>x</u>^2 - <u>x</u> = 3^5''
              with <u>x</u> very close to 16, because 16^2-16 is close to 3^5. ries -i 16 -Ox replaces that answer with
              ``5 <u>x</u>^2 = 6^4''.

</pre><h4><b>Options</b> <b>Limiting</b> <b>the</b> <b>Type</b> <b>of</b> <b>Solutions</b></h4><pre>
       Several options are used to choose what types of expression  can  be  used  in  the  equations  that  are
       presented as solutions.

       <b>-i</b>     Integer:  Require  that all expressions, and all subexpressions, must have integer values. This is
              primarily useful if you are searching for an exact solution for a large integer. Note that inexact
              solutions will still be given, but both sides of the equation will be  integers.   An  example  of
              this  is  ``2  <u>x</u>  =  7^3'' where <u>x</u>=173.  <b>-i</b> is interpreted as <b>-r</b> (described below) if the supplied
              target value is not an integer.

       <b>-ie</b>    Integer, Exact. Like <b>-i</b>, but exits after reporting an exact match (if found). This  equivalent  to
              <b>-i</b>  combined  with  <b>--min-match-distance</b>  <b>0</b>.  To not report any inexact matches at all, use <b>--max-</b>
              <b>match-distance</b> <b>0</b> (described in more detail below).

       <b>-r</b>     Rational: Require that all equations have a single <u>x</u> and that all subexpressions not  involving  <u>x</u>
              are  rational  (an exact ratio of two integers). This is primarily useful if you are searching for
              rational approximations. This option is essentially just shorthand for using the <b>-N</b> and <b>-E</b> options
              to allow only addition, subtraction, multiplication and division, excluding  irrational  constants
              and transcendental functions, etc.

       <b>-re</b>    Rational,  ``Exact''.  Like  <b>-r</b>,  but  exits  after  reporting an ``exact'' match (if found). This
              equivalent to <b>-r</b> combined with <b>--min-match-distance</b> <b>0</b>.
                   Note that computers are (famously) unable to make exact calculations with fractions as simple
              as 1/3. To exit on a match within  some  ``epsilon'',  use  <b>--max-match-distance</b>  with  a  nonzero
              epsilon; to reject inexact matches use <b>--max-match-distance</b> (these options are described in detail
              below).

       <b>-c</b>     Constructible:  Require  that  all  equations  have  a  single  <u>x</u>  and that all subexpressions are
              ``constructible'' in the sense of Euclid's <u>Elements</u>, given a unit interval. This is  like  the  <b>-r</b>
              option  except  that  squares, square roots and the golden ratio <u>phi</u> are also allowed. All results
              will be easily solvable for <u>x</u> and will use only addition, subtraction,  multiplication,  division,
              and square roots.
                   If  you  add  the  option <b>-Ex</b>, more than one <u>x</u> may appear in the solution. This gives answers
              that, when solved for <u>x</u>, are not constructible from the unit  interval,  but  both  sides  of  the
              (unsolved)   equation   <u>are</u>   constructible  given  <u>x</u>  and  a  unit  interval.  For  example  ries
              1.3263524026321 -c -Ex finds the solution ``<u>x</u> <u>x</u>^2 = 7/3''; <u>x</u> is the cube root of 7/3 which is  not
              itself  constructible.  <b>ries</b>'s  answer reflects the fact that 7/3 can be constructed from its cube
              root (although the opposite construction is impossible).

       <b>-a</b>     Algebraic: Generate equations whose roots are ``algebraic numbers''.  This is similar  to  the  <b>-c</b>
              option,  but  also  allows  <u>n</u>^th  powers and roots. The trigonometric functions (sine, cosine, and
              tangent) are allowed but their arguments will always be rational multiples of <u>pi</u>. More than one  <u>x</u>
              is allowed (unless you follow <b>-a</b> with the option <b>-Ox</b>) so the equations might not be easy to solve.

       <b>-Ox</b>    Using  the  <b>-O</b>  option  (described  above)  with  the symbol 'x' tells <b>ries</b> to limit its search to
              solutions that can be expressed in ``closed form''  using  the  basic  constants,  elementary  and
              transcendental  functions.  This concept of ``closed-form number'' is described by Timothy Chow in
              his 1998 paper <u>What</u> <u>is</u> <u>a</u> <u>closed-form</u> <u>number?</u>.

       <b>-l</b>     Liouvillian: Generate equations whose roots are ``Liouvillian numbers'', as described  by  Timothy
              Chow in his 1998 paper <u>What</u> <u>is</u> <u>a</u> <u>closed-form</u> <u>number?</u>.

</pre><h4><b>Options</b> <b>Affecting</b> <b>Output</b> <b>Format</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-s</b>     Sorta  Solve,  by  Shifting to right-hand side: With this option, <b>ries</b> will display equations with
              just a single ``<u>x</u>'' on the left-hand side of the equal sign. It isn't ``solving''  the  equations,
              but  merely performing algebraic transformations to move everything except one <u>x</u> to the right-hand
              side: ``<u>x</u>(<u>x</u>+1) = 7'' becomes ``<u>x</u> = 7/(<u>x</u>+1)''. You can combine this option with  <b>-Ox</b>  to  eliminate
              this  issue,  but  with  that option <b>ries</b> will no longer find solutions that require more than one
              ``<u>x</u>'', like ``<u>x</u>^<u>x</u> = 2'' for 1.55961.

       <b>-x</b>     X Values: Print actual values of <u>x</u> (the roots of the equations found) rather than expressing <u>x</u>  as
              <u>T</u> plus/minus a small number, where <u>T</u> is your target number.  ``<b>--absolute-roots</b>'' is a synonym for
              <b>-x</b>.

       <b>-F</b><u>n</u>    Format:  Controls  the  way expressions are formatted in the main output.  If <u>n</u> is omitted it is 3
              (``-F'' for ``FORTH Format''); if <b>-F</b> is not specified at all, the format will be 2. The  following
              formats are available; each shows the output of ries 1.506591651 -F<u>n</u>:

              Format  0:  Compressed  FORTH-like  postfix  format:  Each  operator and constant is just a single
              symbol. The symbols are as listed above under the <b>-N</b> option.

                        x1- = 2r         for x = T - 0.00659165  {50}
                        xlr = 6q         for x = T - 0.00241106  {62}
                        x4^ = p2+        for x = T - 0.000766951 {68}
                       x1+s = p2*        for x = T + 3.66236e-05 {69}

              Format 1: Infix format, but with single-letter symbols. If this format is specified,  a  table  of
              symbols  will be printed after the main table of results. The rest of the expression syntax is the
              same as the normal format. For example, ``q(l(<u>x</u>)) = p-1'' means ``sqrt(ln(<u>x</u>)) = pi - 1''.

                        x-1 = 1/2        for x = T - 0.00659165  {50}
                     1/l(x) = <a href="../man6/q.6.html">q</a>(6)       for x = T - 0.00241106  {62}
                        x^4 = 2+p        for x = T - 0.000766951 {68}
                    (x+1)^2 = 2.p        for x = T + 3.66236e-05 {69}

              Format 2: Standard infix expression format (this is the default).

                        x-1 = 1/2        for x = T - 0.00659165  {50}
                    1/ln(x) = <a href="../man6/sqrt.6.html">sqrt</a>(6)    for x = T - 0.00241106  {62}
                        x^4 = 2+pi       for x = T - 0.000766951 {68}
                    (x+1)^2 = 2 pi       for x = T + 3.66236e-05 {69}

              Format 3: Print solutions in postfix format, similar to that used in  FORTH  and  on  certain  old
              pocket  calculators.  This  is  close  to  the  format  used internally by <b>ries</b> (to get the exact,
              condensed format, use <u>-F0</u>). This is intended mainly for use by scripts that use <b>ries</b> as an  engine
              to  generate  equations  and  then perform further manipulation on them. However, this option will
              also help you distinguish what symbols were actually used internally to generate an  answer.   For
              example,  'squared'  and  'to  the  power  of 2' both show up as '^2' in the normal output, but in
              postfix they appear as "dup*" and "2 **" respectively.

                      x 1 - = 2 recip    for x = T - 0.00659165  {50}
                 x ln recip = 6 sqrt     for x = T - 0.00241106  {62}
                     x 4 ** = pi 2 +     for x = T - 0.000766951 {68}
                 x 1 + dup* = pi 2 *     for x = T + 3.66236e-05 {69}

              Most of the symbols used by <b>-F3</b> are self-explanatory. The nonobvious ones  are:  <b>neg</b>  for  negate,
              <b>recip</b> for reciprocal, <b>dup*</b> for square, <b>sqrt</b> for square root, <b>**</b> for power (A^B), <b>root</b> for Bth root
              of A, <b>logn</b> for logarithm (to base B) of A.  For these last three, <u>A</u> is the first operand pushed on
              the stack and <u>B</u> is the second.

              The setting of <b>-F</b> does not affect expressions displayed by the various <b>-D</b> diagnostic options (most
              of these use <b>-F0</b>, and <b>-Ds</b> (``show your work'') uses <b>-F2</b>).
                   You may use the <b>--symbol-names</b> option (described below) to redefine the appearance of formats
              2 and 3.

              Of these, <b>-Ds</b> is probably the most useful and fun to look at.  <b>-Dy</b> gives a nice top-level view  of
              the  statistics  of  the  search.   Most of the options that generate lots of output are useful if
              filtered through grep; this can tell you why a certain subexpression is or  is  not  appearing  in
              results.  <b>-DG</b>  and  <b>-Dg</b>  can  be  useful  if  you  want  to use <b>ries</b> to generate a massive list of
              expressions for processing by another program; for this reason its  output  uses  infix  notation.
              Most other <b>-D</b> options print subexpressions in the <b>-F0</b> terse postfix format.

</pre><h4><b>EXTENDED</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Longer  names  are used for options that are thought to be less commonly wanted, or are more likely to be
       used only within <b>--include</b> files.

       <b>--include</b> <u>filename</u>

       <b>-p</b><u>filename</u>

       <b>-p</b>     Load one or more options from file <u>filename</u>. The options ``<b>--include</b> <u>filename</u>'' and ``<b>-p</b><u>filename</u>''
              are equivalent; note that one requires a space before <u>filename</u> and the other cannot have  a  space
              (<b>-p</b>  alone  has  a  related  function,  described below). <b>ries</b> will attempt to open the named file
              (which may be a simple filename or a path), or the given name with ``.ries'' appended.  If  either
              is  found,  <b>ries</b>  will  scan  it for parameters and arguments separated by whitespace. Any control
              characters count as whitespace. Any '#' character that  comes  at  the  beginning  of  a  line  or
              immediately  after  blank  space  denotes  a comment and the rest of the line will be ignored. For
              example, if there is a file ``hst.ries'' containing the following:

                 # hst.ries:  High School Trigonometry settings
                 --trig-argument-scale 1.74532925199433e-2    # pi/180
                 -NLleEv      # No log, ln, e, e^x or arbitrary roots
                 -Ox      # Only allow one 'x' on the left-hand-side
                 -x      # Show equation roots as "x = 123.456"
                         #            rather than "x = T + 1.23e-4"

              then giving the option ``<b>-phst</b>'' is  equivalent  to  giving  the  options  ``<b>--trig-argument-scale</b>
              <b>1.74532925199433e-2</b> <b>-NLleEv</b> <b>-Ox</b> <b>-x</b>'', in that order.
                   A  parameter  file  may additionally invoke another parameter file with the <b>--include</b> option.
              When it encounters this option, <b>ries</b> will apply the options in the included  file,  then  continue
              with  the  rest  of  the  first file. These may be nested up to 25 levels deep. If a file includes
              itself recursively (either directly or indirectly) <b>ries</b> will exit with an error.
                   It is an error for <b>--include</b> or the end of an included file to come between an option and its
              arguments. For example, ``ries 1.2345 --eval-expression --include expressions.txt''  will  produce
              an  error  regardless  of  the  contents of ``expressions.txt'', because <b>--eval-expression</b> must be
              followed immediately by its argument(s). On the other hand, if  ``expressions.txt''  contains  the
              <b>--eval-expression</b> option, like so:

                 # expressions.txt:  Useful functions of one argument
                 --eval-expression
                   xsr    # 1/(x^2)
                   1xq-r  # 1/(1-sqrt(x))
                   2xl1+^ # 2^(ln(x)+1)

              then  the  command  ``ries  1.2345  --include expressions.txt'' works, and shows the values of the
              three expressions where <u>x</u> is 1.2345.
                   If you have a file called ``.ries_profile'' or ``ries_profile.txt'' in your  home  directory,
              <b>ries</b> will load it as if you specified it with a <b>--include</b> at the very beginning of the parameters.
              If  you  have  such  a  file  and  wish  to  prevent it from being used, give a bare <b>-p</b> (without a
              filename) at the very beginning of your <b>ries</b> options. If you wish to give some parameters and have
              .ries_profile loaded <u>after</u> your parameters, include <b>-p</b> again at the point where you want  <b>ries</b>  to
              use  the  profile. For example, if your .ries_profile contains ``<b>--trig-argument-scale</b> <b>1</b>'' and you
              have a hst.ries with contents as shown above, then giving the optiions ``<b>-phst</b> <b>-p</b>'' will  use  all
              of the settings in hst.ries except the <b>--trig-argument-scale</b>.
                   Two  more  example  profiles are the ``Latin'' and ``Mathematica'' settings files linked from
              the top of the main RIES webpage.

       <b>--absolute-roots</b>
              This is a synonym for the <b>-x</b> option, described above.

       <b>--algebraic-subexpressions</b>
              This is a synonym for the <b>-a</b> option, described above.

       <b>--any-exponents</b>
              This option cancels any restrictions on subexpressions used as an exponent, such as those  set  by
              the <b>--algebraic-subexpressions</b> and <b>--liouvillian-subexpressions</b> options.

       <b>--any-subexpressions</b>
              This option cancels any restrictions on subexpressions, as imposed by options such as <b>--algebraic-</b>
              <b>subexpressions</b>.  This might be useful if you are using one of the class selectors like <b>-a</b> or <b>-c</b> as
              shorthand for all the restrictions of that particular class, and then re-enable  a  function  like
              <u>e</u>^<u>x</u> using <b>-EE</b>.

       <b>--any-trig-args</b>
              This  option  cancels  any  restrictions  on  subexpressions  used  as  an  argument to one of the
              trigonometric function, such as those set by  the  <b>--algebraic-subexpressions</b>  and  <b>--liouvillian-</b>
              <b>subexpressions</b> options.

       <b>--canon-reduction</b> <u>symbols</u>
              Apply  simple  transformations in an effort to make all expression values fall in the range [1 ...
              2). This option improves the efficiency of the <b>ries</b>  algorithm  (described  in  the  ``ALGORITHM''
              section below) by increasing the chances of two expressions forming a match. This allows it to use
              less memory and time to achieve any given amount of precision.
                   This  option  should  be  followed by one or more symbols which represent the operations <b>ries</b>
              will try to apply to expressions:

              n      Negate expressions when possible to make all values positive.

              r      Take the reciprocal when possible to make all expressions fall outside the  range  (-1  ...
                     1).

              2      Multiply  by  2 when possible to increase the magnitude of expressions in the range (-1 ...
                     1).

              5      Divide by 2 (i.e. multiply by 0.5) when possible to decrease the magnitude  of  expressions
                     that fall outside the range (-2 ... 2).

              In  these  descriptions,  the  words  <u>when</u>  <u>possible</u> refer to the fact that <b>--canon-reduction</b> will
              respect any limits imposed by the symbolset options <b>-N</b>, <b>-O</b> and <b>-S</b>. So if you use  the  option  <b>-On</b>
              together  with  <b>--canon-reduction</b>  <b>n</b>,  the  negation  operator  will  still  be used only once per
              expression.
                   Although it makes <b>ries</b> more efficient, this option also causes the printed  results  to  have
              greater  complexity  scores,  and  complexity scores will increase somewhat more erratically. <b>ries</b>
              will try to simplify its printed results by  undoing  <b>--canon-reduction</b>  transformations  on  both
              sides  of  the equal sign. For example, ries 2.50618 --canon-reduction nr25 might yield the result
              ``<u>x</u>^<u>x</u>/2 = (1+9)/2'', which simplifies to ``<u>x</u>^<u>x</u> = 1+9''. But when only one side has a ``/2'',  <b>ries</b>
              cannot fix it, so the same example gives an overly complex ``1/(<u>pi</u>-<u>x</u>) = <u>pi</u>/2''.

       <b>--canon-simplify</b>
              When  reporting  a  match, remove common factors or terms from both sides of the equation. This is
              the default.

       <b>--constructible-subexpressions</b>
              This is a synonym for the <b>-c</b> option, described above.

       <b>--derivative-margin</b> <u>value</u>
              Specify the limit to how small the derivative of any expression or subexpression containing <u>x</u>  can
              be  in  relation  to  the  expression's  value.  By  default  this is 10^-6, so that an expression
              containing <u>x</u> is rejected if its value is more than a million  times  its  derivative.  For  really
              large  target  values,  this  doesn't work because the expression ``<u>x</u>'' (with a derivative of 1.0)
              would be rejected. So if the magnitude of your target is larger than  10^5,  <b>ries</b>  will  set  this
              limit  correspondingly lower. For example, if your target value is 10^8, <b>ries</b> automatically sets a
              <b>--derivative-margin</b> value of 10^-9.
                   If you do not consider these defaults suitable, use this option to pick your own  value.  For
              example  in  the command ries 12345 --derivative-margin 8e-5, derivatives of expressions can be as
              small as 8x10^-5 times the expression's value. In calculating any  possible  answers,  <b>ries</b>  would
              allow  ``<u>x</u>^2'' because the ratio between d/d<u>x</u> <u>x</u>^2 and <u>x</u>^2 is about 1.62e-4, which is big enough to
              surpass the margin. However, any answers involving ``sqrt(<u>x</u>)'' would be rejected because the ratio
              between d/d<u>x</u> sqrt(<u>x</u>) and sqrt(<u>x</u>) is only 4.05e-5:

                     expression   value    d/d<u>x</u>(expr.)  ratio
                         <u>x</u>^2    152399025     24690    1.62e-4
                          <u>x</u>       12345        1.0     8.1e-5
                       sqrt(<u>x</u>)   111.108     0.0045    4.05e-5

              Indeed, the results of ries 12345 include the equation ``2(sqrt(<u>x</u>)-9) = (2 e)^pi'', but  with  the
              option <b>--derivative-margin</b> <b>8e-5</b> that answer is left out.

       <b>--explicit-multiply</b>
              Always  use the ``*'' symbol when displaying results, rather than the default behavior of omitting
              ``*'' when multiplicaton can be implied by writing the multiplicands next to each other.  This  is
              useful if you need to copy <b>ries</b> output into a calculator, computer program or spreadsheet formula.

       <b>--integer-subexpressions</b>
              This is a synonym for the <b>-i</b> option, described above.

       <b>--match-all-digits</b>

       <b>--mad</b>  Request  that  all reported matches should match all of the supplied digits. This is equivalent to
              adding a '5' to the end of your target value, along with a <b>--max-match-distance</b> value equal to the
              magnitude of this appended '5' digit. It also selects the <b>--x</b> option, unless the <b>--wide</b> option  is
              also given.
                   For example, the command ries 2.5063 --mad is equivalent to ries 2.50635 --max-match-distance
              0.00005  -x,  and the first reported match is <u>x</u>^2+e = 9, which is true for <u>x</u> = 2.506335... Without
              <b>--mad</b> it reports 2 <u>x</u> = 5 and a few other answers that do not match all of the digits in 2.5063.

       <b>--max-equate-value</b> <u>value</u>

       <b>--min-equate-value</b> <u>value</u>
              Specify the maximum and minimum values for the LHS and RHS of any reported equations. For example,
              the command ries 2.50618 would normally give ``2 <u>x</u> = 5'' as the first solution; both sides of that
              equation are about 5. But the command ries 2.50618 --max-equate-value  3  instead  gives  ``<u>x</u>-2  =
              1/2''  as  the first answer: this is an equivalent solution, but expressed as an equation in which
              both sides of the equal sign are less than 3. Similarly, ries 2.50618 --min-equate-value 27  gives
              the answer ``(<u>e</u>^<u>x</u>)^2 = <u>e</u>^5''.

       <b>--max-match-distance</b> <u>value</u>
              Specify  the  maximum  distance  between your given target value <u>T</u> and the roots <u>x</u> of any reported
              equations. This sets a minimum level of accuracy, overriding the default, which is 1% of the  size
              of  your  target  value.  For  example, the command ries 2.5063 will use a threshold that is 1% of
              2.5063, or about 0.025. It gives as its first answer the equation 2<u>x</u> = 5, an equation  whose  root
              (solution)  is 2.5. This differs from the target value 2.5063 by 0.0063. If you specify an initial
              threshold of 0.001 with the command ries 2.5063 --max-match-distance 0.001, then 2<u>x</u>  =  5  is  not
              reported because 0.0063 is bigger than your threshold 0.001; instead the first match will be ``<u>x</u>^2
              = 2 <u>pi</u>'' (which comes within about 0.0003 of the target 2.5063).
                   Use  a  zero argument to specify that <b>ries</b> should only report an ``exact'' match, if any (and
              note that this ``exact'' match might be more complex than the obvious answer, because of  roundoff
              errors;  see  UNEXPECTED  BEHAVIOR  and BUGS below). Note that this is different from <b>--min-match-</b>
              <b>distance</b> <b>0</b>, which prints inexact matches and stops after the ``exact'' match.
                   Use a negative argument to specify a match threshold in proportion to your target value.  For
              example,  --max-match-distance -0.001 specifies that the first match must be within 1 part in 1000
              (or 1/10 of one percent) of the magnitude of the target.
                   If your choice of <b>--max-match-distance</b> is so stringent that the first match takes longer than
              2 seconds, <b>ries</b> will display progress messages until a match is found. Use the  <b>--no-slow-messages</b>
              option to suppress these.
                   There  is  also  a  <b>--min-match-distance</b>  option  (described below), which serves an entirely
              different purpose.

       <b>--max-matches</b> <u>N</u>

       <b>-n</b><u>N</u>    Limit the number of reported matches to a positive integer <u>N</u>.  This is  particularly  useful  with
              certain options (such as <b>--no-refinement</b>) that generate a lot of matches. The default <u>N</u> is 100.

       <b>--max-memory</b> <u>size</u>
              This  option tells <b>ries</b> not to use more than the given amount of memory (size specified in bytes).
              This is particularly useful in combination with a high <b>-l</b> (search level) option. For  example,  if
              you  typically  have  about 2 gigabytes of free memory on your machine, you could invoke <b>ries</b> with
              the option <b>--max-memory</b> <b>1.0e9</b>, to ensure that it  never  uses  more  than  1  gigabyte  of  memory
              regardless of the search level.
                   <b>ries</b>  also  has  an  (experimental) feature that can automatically detect when your system is
              slowing down; see the <b>--memory-abort-threshold</b> option for details.

       <b>--max-trig-cycles</b> <u>value</u>
              Specify the maximum and minimum values for arguments to the trigonometric functions, in  multiples
              of  one  half-period.  The default is 1.0, which corresponds to an allowed range of -<u>pi</u> to <u>pi</u>. The
              option --max-trig-cycles 4 would allow arguments from -4<u>pi</u> to 4<u>pi</u>.  In  combination  with  <b>--trig-</b>
              <b>argument-scale</b>,  this  argument  is  applied  after the scaling, so that the number of ``cycles'',
              ``periods'' or ``waves'' remains the same. For example, if the value <u>pi</u>/180 is  used  for  <b>--trig-</b>
              <b>argument-scale</b>  and  if <b>--max-trig-cycles</b> is set to 2, then the allowed range for arguments to the
              trigonometric functions is -360 to +360 (which is interpreted  as  being  in  units  of  degrees),
              corresponding to two full cycles of the trigonometric functions.

       <b>--memory-abort-threshold</b> <u>N</u>
              This  option  is  used  with  the <b>-DM</b> option, and overrides the default slowness measurement after
              which <b>ries</b> will automatically exit. With the <b>-DM</b> option, <b>ries</b> measures how fast it is running,  as
              compared  to  an  estimate of how fast it ``should'' be running. If this ratio is greater than the
              <u>--memory-abort-threshold</u> for more than 3 of the past 10 measurements, <b>ries</b> will exit. The  default
              <u>--memory-abort-threshold</u>  is  2.0.  The value must be at least 1.0, and values less than about 1.5
              are unlikely to be of much use.
                   <u>NOTE</u>: <b>--memory-abort-threshold</b> is an experimental <b>ries</b> feature and is  likely  to  change  in
              future versions of <b>ries</b>.

       <b>--min-match-distance</b> <u>value</u>
              Specify  the  minimum  distance  between your given target value <u>T</u> and the roots <u>x</u> of any reported
              equations. This is useful for finding approximate formulas for constants that have a known, simple
              formula. For example, using the command ries 3.141592653589 -x --min-match-distance 1e-8 -NSCT one
              can discover the following approximate formulas for <u>pi</u> :

                                x-3 = 1/6            for x = 3.16666666666667
                                x-3 = 1/7            for x = 3.14285714285714
                          ln(ln(x)) = 1/e^2          for x = 3.14219183392327
                              x^2+1 = 4 e            for x = 3.14215329254258
                              e^x+2 = 8 pi           for x = 3.14124898321672
                            x/phi^2 = 1/5+1          for x = 3.14164078649987
                             e^x-pi = 4*5            for x = 3.14163154625921
                          e^(x^2)+1 = e^(pi^2)       for x = 3.14158442136535
                               pi-x = 1/e^(4^2)      for x = 3.14159254105462
                       sqrt(1+pi) x = e^3/pi         for x = 3.14159272240341
                            x^2/e^3 = 1/sqrt(1+pi)   for x = 3.1415926879966
                            9(x-pi) = 1/-(e^(4^2))   for x = 3.14159264108588

              Among these results (after solving for <u>x</u>) are the ancient approximations 19/6 and  22/7,  and  the
              more  modern  curiosity <u>e</u>^<u>pi</u> = 20 + <u>pi</u> (which is called ``<u>Gelfond's</u> <u>constant</u>''). Other interesting
              results can be found by omitting symbols with <b>-N</b> or by using restricted classes. For example  <b>ries</b>
              <b>3.1415926</b>  <b>-NSCTlLfEevp</b>  <b>--min-match-distance</b>  <b>1e-8</b>  (excluding  most of the scientific functions)
              gives the fraction approximation 355/113 in the form ``1/(<u>x</u>-3)-1 = 1/4^2+6''; and  <b>ries</b>  <b>3.1415926</b>
              <b>-r</b>  <b>--min-match-distance</b>  <b>1e-8</b> (requesting only rational approximations) gives 355/113 in the form
              ``1/(<u>x</u>-3)-3 = 1/(4*4)+4''.
                   You will often  get  multiple  equivalent  results.  In  the  above  example,  the  equations
              sqrt(1+<u>pi</u>)  <u>x</u>  =  e^3/<u>pi</u>  and  <u>x</u>^2/e^3  =  1/sqrt(1+<u>pi</u>) can both be converted into the approximate
              relation:

                   <u>pi</u> = sqrt(sqrt(<u>e</u>^6/(<u>pi</u>+1)))

              (which does <u>not</u> converge on the true value of <u>pi</u> if iterated).
                   If you give a value of 0: ``--min-match-distance 0'', and <b>ries</b> finds an ``exact''  match,  it
              will exit and report no further results.  Note that this is different from <b>--max-match-distance</b> <b>0</b>,
              which will only print the ``exact'' match and will not print any inexact matches.
                   There  is  also  a  <b>--max-match-distance</b>  option  (described above), which serves an entirely
              different purpose.

       <b>--min-memory</b> <u>size</u>
              If <b>ries</b> is given the debug option <b>-DM</b>, it will try to measure the responsiveness of the system and
              automatically exit if it gets very slow. This  is  intended  as  an  automatic  safeguard  against
              virtual  memory  ``thrashing''  that  will  happen  if <b>ries</b> is allowed to use all of your system's
              memory. (This feature is only active with the <b>-DM</b> option because it is still being tested).
                   When <b>--min-memory</b> is given in combination with <b>-DM</b>, it will ensure that <b>ries</b>  does  not  exit
              because  of  slow memory response until at least <u>size</u> bytes of memory have been used. For example,
              if you know that you always have about 1 gigabyte of free memory on your machine, and your machine
              often gets slow for other compute-intensive tasks, you could invoke  <b>ries</b>  with  the  options  <b>-DM</b>
              <b>--min-memory</b>  <b>1.0e9</b>,  and slow system detection would be enabled but would not trigger (if at all)
              until a gigabyte of memory has been used.
                   For more direct control over <b>ries</b>' memory usage, use the <b>--max-memory</b> option (without <b>-DM</b>) or
              use a suitably small <b>-l</b> search level.

       <b>--no-canon-simplify</b>
              When reporting a match, do <u>not</u> remove common factors or terms from both  sides  of  the  equation.
              This  is useful mainly in combination with <b>--max-equate-value</b> and <b>--min-equate-value</b>. For example,
              the command ries -Ox 2.6905 would normally give the answer ``<u>x</u>-2 = <a href="../man2/ln.2.html">ln</a>(2)'' in which both sides  of
              the  equation  are  about  0.693.  Adding the options <b>--no-canon-simplify</b> and <b>--min-equate-value</b> <b>1</b>
              reports the same answer as ``1/(<u>x</u>-2) = 1/<a href="../man2/ln.2.html">ln</a>(2)'' in which both sides of  the  equation  are  about
              1.443.

       <b>--no-refinement</b>
              After reporting a match, do <u>not</u> require that the next match come closer to the target. This causes
              <b>ries</b>  to  emit many more matches than it normally would. The matches will not be given in order of
              closeness, but they will still be (roughly) ordered by increasing  ``complexity''.  Many  will  be
              equivalent  to  one  another,  for  example  the  command  ries 1.51301 --no-refinement yields the
              solutions <u>e</u>^(<u>x</u>^2) = pi^2 and <u>x</u>/<a href="../man2/sqrt.2.html">sqrt</a>(2) = sqrt(ln(pi)), both  with  the  root  1.513096088...  This
              option is most effective in combination with <b>--max-matches</b> along with <b>--match-all-digits</b> or <b>--max-</b>
              <b>match-distance</b> (using a stricter argument than the default -0.01).

       <b>--no-slow-messages</b>
              Suppress  the ``Still searching'' messages that <b>ries</b> would normally print if a search takes longer
              than 2 seconds without giving any results.

       <b>--no-solve-for-x</b>
              This option cancels the ``<b>--try-solve-for-x</b>'' option.

       <b>--numeric-anagram</b> <u>digits</u>
              Give a specific set of digits that can be used as constants in a solution; this forces the  <b>--one-</b>
              <b>sided</b>  option.  It  will  use  only as many of each digit as you specify. For example, if you give
              ``111223'' as the digits, <b>ries</b> will use up to three 1's, two 2's, and/or a single 3. This is meant
              to aid in solving certain puzzles of the ``four fours'' variety:

                ries 17 -ie --numeric-anagram 4444
                     x = 4*4+4/4               ('exact' match)       {92}

                ries 17 -ie --numeric-anagram 111223
                     x = 2^(1+3)+1             ('exact' match)       {77}

                ries 12 --numeric-anagram 44s
                     x = 4^2-4

                ries 12 --numeric-anagram 442
                     x = 2*4+4

              <b>--numeric-anagram</b> can be used to set hard limits on the digits, the constants <u>e</u>, <u>phi</u>, and <u>pi</u>,  and
              the  ``squared''  and ``reciprocal'' symbols. When you use <b>--numeric-anagram</b>, any of these symbols
              that you do not list will be forbidden just as if you  had  used  the  <b>-N</b>  option.  The  last  two
              examples  here  show  the use of ``s'' to specify the squaring operation <u>x</u>^2 as distinguished from
              any use of ``2''.

       <b>--one-sided</b>
              Force <b>ries</b> to ignore all LHS expressions except <u>x</u>. This results in ``one-sided equations'' with  <u>x</u>
              on  the  left-hand  side.  This makes <b>ries</b> much slower, but all of its output will be ``solved for
              <u>x</u>''.
                   This option is intended as a convenience for very special problems (for  example,  <b>--numeric-</b>
              <b>anagram</b>  automatically  turns  on  <b>--one-sided</b>),  but it is not generally useful because the speed
              advantage of the normal RIES bidirectional search algorithm is lost.  If you  want  <b>ries</b>  to  give
              answers that are solved for <u>x</u>, use the <b>--try-solve-for-x</b> option possibly along with <b>-Ox</b>.
                   If  you use this option, <b>ries</b> will be a lot slower and its solutions for a given search level
              will not be nearly as accurate.  Whereas a normal <b>ries</b> search  might  quickly  match  your  target
              value to the first 10 decimal places, a search with the <b>--one-sided</b> option, taking the same amount
              of  computation  time,  will  only match the first 5 decimal places. Sometimes this is acceptable,
              particularly when used with other options that restrict the search, such as <b>-i</b>, <b>-N</b>, <b>-O</b>, and <b>-S</b>.

       <b>--rational-exponents</b>
              Require any exponent to be a rational subexpression. For example <a href="../man2/sqrt.2.html">sqrt</a>(2) is allowed because it  is
              2  to  the  power  of  1/2,  but  2  to the power of <a href="../man2/sqrt.2.html">sqrt</a>(2) is not allowed because <a href="../man2/sqrt.2.html">sqrt</a>(2) is not
              rational. This option exists  mainly  to  support  the  <b>-a</b>  or  <b>--algebraic-subexpressions</b>  option
              (described above).

       <b>--rational-subexpressions</b>
              This is a synonym for the <b>-r</b> option, described above.

       <b>--rational-trig-args</b>
              Require  any  argument  to  a  trigonometric function be a rational subexpression. The restriction
              applies to the argument's value before multiplying by the  <b>--trig-argument-scale</b>  (if  any).  This
              option exists mainly to support the <b>-a</b> or <b>--algebraic-subexpressions</b> option (described above).

       <b>--relative-roots</b>
              When  printing each equation, show the root as <u>T</u> plus/minus a small number (where <u>T</u> is your target
              number) rather than as the actual value of the root. This is the default, so you'll only  need  to
              use  <b>--relative-roots</b>  to  cancel a <b>-x</b> or <b>--absolute-roots</b> option in your .ries_profile or another
              <b>--include</b> file.

       <b>--ries-arguments-end</b>
              This `option' signals the end of options and arguments; any that come after it will be ignored. If
              it occurs within a profile (described under the <b>--include</b> option above) <b>ries</b> will ignore the  rest
              of  the  contents  of that file and continue with the next option after the <b>--include</b> or <b>-p</b> option
              that invoked the profile.

       <b>--show-work</b>
              This is a synonym for the <b>-Ds</b> option, described in the <b>-D</b> (debugging/diagnostic) option above.

       <b>--significance-loss-margin</b> <u>digits</u>
              Specify the number of significant digits that may be lost  in  a  calculation.  By  default,  <b>ries</b>
              tolerates a loss of 2 digits in any calculation. For example, if <u>x</u> is 0.906402477... (the value of
              Gamma[5/4]),  <b>ries</b>  would  not  use  <u>x</u>+e^5 in any of its expressions, because <u>e</u>^5 is more than 100
              times as large as <u>x</u>. Due to round-off, more than 2 digits of the value of <u>x</u> would be lost  in  the
              addition.  This  restriction  applies  to  constant expressions too, so <b>ries</b> also avoids 1+e^5 and
              1+e^-5.  Similar restrictions apply to any function that  can  cause  precision  to  be  lost  (if
              evaluated at a point where the function's derivative is very low).
                   The  normal <b>ries</b> behavior corresponds to a <b>--significance-loss-margin</b> option with an argument
              of 2.0. Give a higher value to allow more digits to be lost in calculations.
                   Conversely, if you suspect <b>ries</b> is generating meaningless results due to round-off error, you
              can look at its calculations in detail with the  options  <b>-Ds</b>  and  <b>-F0</b>,  then  evaluate  specific
              expressions  with  <b>--eval-expression</b>  (described  below).  If it seems appropriate, make <b>ries</b> more
              strict by giving <b>--significance-loss-margin</b> with a lesser argument.

       <b>--symbol-names</b> :<u>sym</u>:<u>name</u> [ :<u>sym</u>:<u>name</u> ... ]
              This option allows you to  set  the  ``names''  of  individual  symbols.   This  affects  how  the
              expressions  and  equations are printed in any of the <b>-F</b> formatting modes, and by special commands
              such as <b>--eval-expression</b>. In addition to the symbols listed above in the <b>-N</b> option, you may  also
              define these symbols:

              ( )    brackets to group sub-expressions

              =      equality symbol

              Here  are  examples  of  the  normal  <b>ries</b>  output,  modified  by  changing  the appearance of the
              exponentiation operator and parentheses.  The  single-quotes  around  each  option  are  to  avoid
              substitution by the shell:

              With the smaller weight of 5, <u>x</u> is considered ``less expensive'', and <b>ries</b> uses <u>x</u>  more  often  in
              its  answers;  and  with the number <b>2</b> and squaring more expensive, these show up less often in the
              results. In many cases the new results are equivalent, and <b>ries</b> has simply found a  different  way
              to get there.
                   Since the arguments of <b>--symbol-weights</b> start with a digit, your target value will be treated
              as a symbol-weight specifier unless you place it somewhere else in the parameter list (as shown in
              the example), or use a single dash ``-'' to signal the end of the parameters.
                   <u>NOTE</u>: Changing the symbol weights can greatly reduce <b>ries</b>'s efficiency, causing it to run for
              a very long time and giving little or no output. If this happens, it usually can be fixed by using
              weights closer to the default values. You can also experiment with changing just one symbol-weight
              at a time to find which is causing the problem.

       <b>--trig-argument-scale</b> <u>value</u>
              Specify  a  constant  by  which  the  argument of the sine, cosine and tangent functions should be
              multiplied. By default this value is <u>pi</u> and the trig functions are called sinpi, cospi and  tanpi.
              sinpi(<u>x</u>)  is  the sine of <u>pi</u> times <u>x</u>; so for example sinpi(1/3) is the sine of <u>pi</u>/3, which is half
              the square root of 3. A full circle is 2 in these units: sinpi(<u>x</u>) = -sinpi(<u>x</u>+1) =  sinpi(<u>x</u>+2)  for
              all <u>x</u>.
                   If  you  give  this option, arguments will be multiplied by the number you give instead of by
              <u>pi</u>. Useful values to give are:

              <b>6.2831853071795864769</b>
                     This is ``tau'' (2 <u>pi</u>); use it to get units of 1 per ``full turn'': ``sin(1/16)'' will give
                     0.382683...

              <b>1</b>      Use 1 to get natural units (radians): ``sin(pi/8)'' will give 0.382683...

              <b>1.74532925199432957692e-2</b>
                     This is <u>pi</u>/180, and is used for degrees: ``sin(22.5)'' will give 0.382683...

              <b>1.57079632679489661923e-2</b>
                     This is <u>pi</u>/200, and is used for grads (gradians or gons): ``<a href="../man25/sin.25.html">sin</a>(25)'' will give 0.382683...

              If you use this option, <b>ries</b> will call the functions sin, cos and tan in its output, and the scale
              will be displayed after the function definitions at the end.

       <b>--try-solve-for-x</b>

       <b>-s</b>     <b>--try-solve-for-x</b> is equivalent to ``<b>-s</b>'', which is described in the OPTIONS section above.

       <b>--version</b>
              Displays information about the version of <b>ries</b>, the calculation precision and  math  library,  any
              optional  module(s),  the  currently enabled profile (see the <b>--include</b> option at the beginning of
              the EXTENDED OPTIONS section above), and a brief copyright notice. The version is a date, such  as
              ``2013 Jun 3''.

       <b>--wide-output</b>
              Use  a  wider  (132-column) output format. This shows the roots of equations (values of <u>x</u>) both in
              terms of the the actual value of <u>x</u>, and as <u>T</u> plus/minus a delta; it also shows the  ratio  between
              this  delta and <u>x</u> as ``(1 part in <u>N</u>)'' where <u>N</u> is the delta divided by <u>x</u>. For example, if <u>x</u> is 2.5
              and target value is 2.501, the delta is 0.001, which is ``1 part in 2500''.

</pre><h4><b>SPECIAL</b> <b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ries</b> provides some functions that supplement its main purpose.  Commands and  their  parameters  must  be
       separate:  `ries  1.23 --trig-argument-scale 0.5', not `ries 1.23 --trig-argument-scale 0.5'. Because the
       parameters are given separately, your target value might be interpreted as a parameter  if  you  give  it
       right  after  a  special  command.  To  avoid  this,  use  a  single  dash ``-'' to signal the end of the
       parameters.

       <b>--eval-expression</b> <u>forth-expr</u> [<u>forth-expr</u> ...]
              Evaluate one or more expressions, showing intermediate values,  derivatives,  and  the  complexity
              score  of  the full expression. The expression(s) should be given in the FORTH-like postfix syntax
              that is displayed when you use the -F0 option. The symbols  are  as  listed  above  under  the  <b>-N</b>
              option.  For  example, xxq- is the syntax for <u>x</u>-sqrt(<u>x</u>). Syntax errors and computation errors such
              as overflow are reported; however successful execution by  <b>--eval-expression</b>  does  not  guarantee
              that  the expression will be found in an actial <b>ries</b> search. For example, an expression containing
              <u>x</u> only appears as the left-hand-side of an equation if the <u>x</u> is the first symbol  in  the  postfix
              form: <b>ries</b> will use x2+ (<u>x</u>+2) but will not use 2x+ (2+<u>x</u>).

       <b>--find-expression</b> <u>forth-expr</u> [<u>forth-expr</u> ...]
              Perform  the  normal  equation-finding search algorithm, and report specific expressions when they
              are found, along with their value, derivative, and complexity. The expression(s) should  be  given
              in the FORTH-like postfix syntax that is displayed when you use the -F0 option. The symbols are as
              listed  above  under the <b>-N</b> option. For example, xxq- is the syntax for <u>x</u>-sqrt(<u>x</u>). This command is
              useful for diagnostics; an example is given below in the UNEXPECTED BEHAVIOR section.

</pre><h4><b>STAND-ALONE</b> <b>MATHS</b> <b>LIBRARY</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>ries</b> source code includes an auxiliary file, msal_math64.c, which can be  downloaded  from  the  same
       place  as  the  main  RIES  source  code  and this manual. It provides some of the standard trignonmetric
       functions, whose implementation have been found to vary across different releases of the  standard  libm.
       This is useful if you are running <b>ries</b> on a variety of newer or older systems and want to be able to rely
       on consistent results.

       msal_math64.c also provides the Lambert W function, defined to the symbol 'W'.

       To  use  msal_math64.c,  compile  <b>ries</b>  in  the  normal  way  but  with  the  additional  compiler option
       -DRIES_USE_SA_M64. The resulting  <b>ries</b>  binary  will  report  ``mathlib:  stand-alone''  when  given  the
       --version option.

       Once  <b>ries</b>  has  been compiled with the stand-alone maths library, the Lambert W function is available by
       giving the option -EW on the <b>ries</b> command-line. Its default weight is set to make it occur a little  more
       often  than  the two-argument exponential and root functions; use the <b>--symbol-weights</b> option if you want
       to change this.

</pre><h4><b>ALGORITHM</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ries</b> begins its search with small, simple equations and proceeds to longer, more complex ones. It uses  a
       set  of  <u>complexity</u>  <u>rules</u>  to compute a measure (similar to Kolmogorov complexity), which determines the
       order in which various candidate expressions are considered by <b>ries</b>. For example:

       1.     If you add a symbol to an equation, the result is more complex:

                  <u>x</u> + 1 = 3   is more complex than     <u>x</u> = 3

                <u>x</u> + 1 = <a href="../man3/ln.3.html">ln</a>(3) is more complex than   <u>x</u> + 1 = 3

                 <u>x</u> - 7 = 4^2  is more complex than   <u>x</u> - 7 = 4

       2.     If two equations are the same except for one number, the equation with the higher number  is  more
              complex:

                  <u>x</u> + 1 = 5   is more complex than   <u>x</u> + 1 = 3

                 <u>x</u>^3 + 1 = 3  is more complex than  <u>x</u>^2 + 1 = 3

       3.     If two equations are the same except for one symbol, the equation with the "more exotic" symbol is
              more complex:

                  <u>x</u> ^ 5 = 3   is more complex than   <u>x</u> + 5 = 3

       As <b>ries</b> searches it finds solutions -- these are equations for which <u>x</u> is close to being an exact answer.
       Each  time  it  finds a solution it prints it out. Then <b>ries</b> raises its standard for the next answer: The
       next answer <b>ries</b> prints must be a closer match to your supplied value than all the answers it  has  given
       so  far.  (The  only exception to this rule is an 'exact' match, one for which both sides match to within
       the limits of numerical precision. <b>ries</b> will print at most one of these, and will then continue to  print
       more inexact solutions. Sometimes the approximations are of greater interest than the exact match.)

       Instead  of  trying  complete  equations,  <b>ries</b> actually constructs half-equations, called <u>left-hand-side</u>
       <u>expressions</u> and <u>right-hand-side</u> <u>expressions</u>, abbreviated LHS's and RHS's.  It keeps a list of LHS's and a
       list of RHS's, and it keeps these lists in numerical order at  all  times.  This  enables  <b>ries</b>  to  find
       matches  much  faster.  All  LHS's contain <u>x</u> and all RHS's do not. Thus, 1000 LHS's and 1000 RHS's make a
       total of 1000000 possible equations, and all 1000000 combinations can be quickly checked just by scanning
       through the two lists in numerical order. This is why <b>ries</b> is able to check billions of equations in such
       a short time.

       The closeness of an LHS match depends on the value of <u>x</u>, and also on the derivative with respect to <u>x</u>  of
       the LHS expression. Because of this, <b>ries</b> calculates derivatives of LHS's as well as their values.

       There are dozens of optimization rules <b>ries</b> uses, like the following:

       <b>a+</b>     Don't try ``K + K'' for any constant <b>K</b> because ``K * 2'' is equivalent.

       <b>b+</b>     Don't  try  ``3 + 4'' (or any two unequal integers from 1 to 5) because another single integer (in
              this case ``7'') is shorter.

       <b>a*</b>     Don't try ``1 * K'' for any constant <b>K</b> because ``K'' is shorter.

       <b>b*</b>     Don't try both ``2 * 4'' and ``4 * 2'' because they are equivalent.

       <b>c*</b>     Don't try ``K * K'' because ``K ^ 2'' is shorter.

       <b>ar</b>     Don't try ``1 / (1 / expr))'' for any expression <b>expr</b> because ``expr'' is shorter.

       <b>a^</b>     Don't try ``2 ^ 2'' or ``2 squared'' because ``4'' is shorter.

       <b>b^</b>     Don't try ``expr ^ 2'' for any expression <b>expr</b> because ``expr squared'' is shorter.

       There are over 50 rules like this, and together they make the search about 10 times faster.  However,  if
       the  symbol  set  is  limited via <b>-N</b>, <b>-O</b> or <b>-S</b>, some of these rules cannot be used. For each optimization
       rule there are one or more symbolset exclude rules like the following:

             Don't use rule <b>a+</b> if either of the symbols '*' or '2' is disabled.

       In order to maintain maximum efficiency, <b>ries</b> checks each rule individually against  the  symbolset,  and
       uses  as  many  rules  as  it  can.   You  can  see  this process in action by trying a command like ries
       1.4142135, which gives the answer ``<u>x</u>^2 = 2''.  If you disable the 's' (squared) and '^' (power)  symbols
       with ries 1.4142135 -Ns^, rule <b>b^</b> goes away, and the answer becomes ``<u>x</u> <u>x</u> = 2''.  If you also disable '*'
       (multiplication)  the answer becomes ``<u>x</u> = <a href="../man2/sqrt.2.html">sqrt</a>(2)''.  Disable 'q' (square root) and you get ``log_2(<u>x</u>) =
       1/2'' (the logarithm to base 2 of <u>x</u> is 1/2).  Disable 'L' and it becomes ``<u>x</u> = 2,/2'' (square root of  2,
       this  time  using the generalized root function). Disable 'v' and you get ``<u>x</u>/(1/<u>x</u>) = 2''. Disabling '/',
       we get a trignometric identity involving <u>pi</u>/4; disabling the trig functions as well, the command  becomes
       ries  1.4142135  '-Ns^q*Lv/SCT'  and  we finally get an answer that most people probably would not guess:
       <u>x</u>-1/(<u>x</u>+1) = 1 (note that the '/' in this answer is  actually  part  of  '1/',  which  is  the  reciprocal
       operator 'r'). Throughout this progression the complexity score of the equation increases as the solution
       becomes  more  and more obscure, and simpler but poorly matching ``solutions'' like 1/cos(<u>x</u>) = 6 begin to
       appear.

</pre><h4><b>UNEXPECTED</b> <b>BEHAVIOR</b></h4><pre>
       Sometimes a more complex equation will be given before  the  (simpler)  equation  that  you  expect.  For
       example,  tan(<a href="../man2/sqrt.2.html">sqrt</a>(2))  = sin(<a href="../man2/sqrt.2.html">sqrt</a>(2))/cos(<a href="../man2/sqrt.2.html">sqrt</a>(2)) is 6.334119167042..., so you might expect the command
       ries  6.334119167042  --trig-argument-scale  1  -NT  to  report  something  like   ``cos(<a href="../man2/sqrt.2.html">sqrt</a>(2))   <u>x</u>   =
       sin(<a href="../man2/sqrt.2.html">sqrt</a>(2))''.    Instead,   <b>ries</b>  gives  ``sqrt(<u>x</u>^2+1)  =  1/cos(<a href="../man2/sqrt.2.html">sqrt</a>(2))'',  which  is  equivalent  by
       trigonometric identity, because it considers this equation to  be  ``more  balanced''  (complexity  score
       45+38)  than  the other (which has a score of 48+29). Please read the preceding section ``ALGORITHM'' for
       more details.

       Adding or changing the symbolset with the <b>-S</b>, <b>-O</b> and <b>-N</b> options often causes unexpected  changes  in  the
       output. For example, ries 2.2772 yields the solution ``1/(<u>x</u>-2) = 2+<u>phi</u>'' but ries 2.2772 '-N*/T' does not
       give this solution in any form. This seems counterintuitive: there was no *, /, or tan() in the ``1/(<u>x</u>-2)
       = 2+<u>phi</u>'' solution, so why did <b>ries</b> decide not to report it?
            In  fact,  the  solution is still generated internally, but because you have told it to exclude some
       operators, <b>ries</b> has to try other, more exotic expressions sooner than it otherwise would. As it  happens,
       the  next solution ``<u>x</u>+1/e = <a href="../man7/sqrt.7.html">sqrt</a>(7)'' (which matches the target value 2.2772 more closely than ``1/(<u>x</u>-2)
       = 2+<u>phi</u>'') ends up getting found earlier.
            The mysterious behavior results from the fact that <b>ries</b> always tries to keep the number of  LHS  and
       RHS expressions equal as it performs its search. Eliminating operators with the <b>-N</b> option means that more
       complex  expressions  must  be  generated  to reach the ``quota''. In this particular case, the symbolset
       restriction has a greater effect on the LHS than on the  RHS,  so  as  the  search  is  progressing,  LHS
       complexity  grows  a  little more quickly than RHS complexity. The complexity of ``1/(<u>x</u>-2)'' is 40, while
       the complexity of ``<u>x</u>+1/e'' is only a little more complex at 42. But the right-hand-side  ``<a href="../man7/sqrt.7.html">sqrt</a>(7)''  is
       considered  less  complex  (27)  than  ``2+<u>phi</u>''  (35). Since both pieces of an equation need to be found
       before an equation can be reported, <b>ries</b> is able to locate both pieces of ``<u>x</u>+1/e = <a href="../man7/sqrt.7.html">sqrt</a>(7)'' sooner when
       the -N option is given.
            This is all made plain with  the  <b>--find-expression</b>  option,  giving  the  expressions  ``1/(<u>x</u>-2)'',
       ``2+<u>phi</u>'',  ``<u>x</u>+1/e'' and ``<a href="../man7/sqrt.7.html">sqrt</a>(7)'' in postfix form, to reveal the order in which they are generated by
       the search algorithm:

           ries 2.2772 --find-expression x2-r f2+ xer+ 7q
            [7q] = 2.64575131106459, complexity = {27}
            [x2-r] = 3.60750360750361, d/dx = -13.0141, complexity = {40}
            [f2+] = 3.61803398874989, complexity = {35}
            [xer+] = 2.64507944117144, d/dx = 1, complexity = {42}

       Then, repeating the same command with <b>'-N*/T'</b> shows that the [xer+] is generated before [f2+].

       In the case of two equivalent solutions (like the 6.334119167042...  example earlier  in  this  section),
       both  equations come equally close to the supplied value, but only one can be found first. Once the first
       one is reported, the other is not, because <b>ries</b> only reports solutions that are at least  a  0.1%  closer
       match than the previously-reported solution.

       The  <b>-l</b>  option  is meant to give control over the number of solutions searched, but it actually controls
       the number of LHS and RHS expressions generated. Because two RHS's often have the same  value,  and  only
       one  (the  first) gets kept, the number of solutions checked (which is the RHS count times the LHS count)
       depends on how often you get two LHS's or RHS's with the same value. This happens particularly often when
       the symbol set is severely restricted. If <b>ries</b> tried to compensate for this, the  result  would  be  that
       severely  limited symbolsets would take a very long time to run and would generate really long equations.
       This is an important issue for those using  <b>ries</b>  to  solve  special  problems,  like  the  ``four  fours
       problem''  exemplified  by  the  command  ries --numeric-anagram 4444 -Ox 17.  The current implementation
       represents the author's attempt at a reasonable tradeoff.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Performance does not degrade gracefully when the physical memory limit is hit, because  expression  nodes
       are  allocated  in sequential order in memory, without regard to where they will end up in the tree. This
       could be improved in the future with percentile demographics and a sort performed one  time  only,  after
       the tree reaches a healthy (but not excessive) size.

       Although  it  tries  to  avoid it, <b>ries</b> will often print more than one equivalent solution. It misses the
       fact that the multiple solutions are equivalent because of roundoff error. For  example,  ries  '-S4+-*/'
       -Ox  17  gives  ``x-4*4  = 4/4'' and ``(4/(4-4*4)) x+4 = (4*4+4)/(4-4*4)'' (or a similar long form), only
       recognizing the first as an exact match (the more complex one involves divisions by multiples of 3, which
       require rounding).
            This problem is common when the target is already known very precisely by  the  user.  For  example,
       ries   0.00088953230706449   gives   the   (correct)   answer   ``ln(x)/pi   =  -<a href="../man5/sqrt.5.html">sqrt</a>(5)'',  followed  by
       redundant/equivalent answers such as ``ln(x)/pi-2  =  -(phi^3)''  (if  <b>ries</b>  was  compiled  with  regular
       precision)  or  ``<a href="../man5/sqrt.5.html">sqrt</a>(5),/x+4  =  1/e^pi+4''  (if  compiled  with the -DRIES_WANT_LDBL option); but ries
       0.000889532307 only gives the first, simplest form of the answer.

       Related to this, <b>ries</b> sometimes gives an overly-complex answer, again  because  of  roundoff  error.  For
       example,  <b>ries</b>  gets slightly different values for ``2/3'' and ``1-1/3'', and stores both of these in its
       database of RHS values. When reporting a solution in which both sides of the equation equal 2/3, it might
       give ``1-1/3'' for the right-hand side if it is closer to the (rounded) value of the left-hand side.
            This is particularly common if you request an exact match with a zero  or  very  small  <b>--max-match-</b>
       <b>distance</b>  value,  while giving an imprecise target value.  For example, ries 1.9739208802178 --max-match-
       distance 0 might give ``cospi(1/(5 x)^2) = cospi(1/pi^4)'' whereas ries  1.9739208802178715  --max-match-
       distance  0 gives the expected ``5 x = pi^2''. However, I've only gotten complaints about this from users
       who give <b>ries</b> a problem to which they already know an answer.
            If you know that 1.9739208802178... is <u>pi</u>^2/5, then you don't really need <b>ries</b> to tell you that,  do
       you?  And  if  you're  searching  for  things  that  approximate  <u>pi</u>^2/5,  such  as sqrt(sqrt(e^2+1)+1) =
       1.9739267..., you can use the <b>--min-match-distance</b> option.

       In deeper searches or with target values larger than 10^5, <b>ries</b> might occasionally  report  ``solutions''
       that   are   actually   tautologies  empty  in  meaning.  A  typical  example  is  ``<u>x</u>^(4/ln(sqrt(<u>x</u>)))  =
       sqrt(e)^(4^2)'' (which is true for any value of <u>x</u>), but <b>ries</b> handles that case and most others  like  it.
       If  you  suspect the solutions it gives, use the <b>-Ds</b> option to show all calculations behind each proposed
       solution. The options <b>--derivative-margin</b>, <b>--min-match-distance</b>, and <b>--significance-loss-margin</b> may  help
       avoid meaningless results.
           You  can also use <b>-Ox</b> to force <b>ries</b> to use only a single <u>x</u> in each equation, which will prevent these
       tautologies entirely, but will also prevent the discovery of interesting solutions like <u>x</u>^<u>x</u> = 10.
