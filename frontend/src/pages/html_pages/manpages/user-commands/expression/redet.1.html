</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       redet - regular expression development and execution tool

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>redet</b> &lt;options&gt; [&lt;input file&gt;]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>redet</u>  allows the user to construct regular expressions and test them against input data by executing any
       of a variety of search programs, editors, and programming languages that make use of regular expressions.
       When a suitable regular expression has been constructed it may be saved to a file.

       Redet currently supports over fifty different programs and regular expression  libraries.  These  include
       multiple  versions  of  grep,  several editors (Ed, Emacs, Sed, Vim), all the popular scripting languages
       (Awk, Perl, Python, Ruby, Tcl) and some less popular ones (Lua, Pike, Rebol),  most  shells  (Bash,  Ksh,
       Tcsh, Zsh) and various other languages, including Guile, Icon and Java.

       For  each program, a palette showing the available regular expression syntax is provided. Selections from
       the palette may be copied to the regular expression window with a mouse click. Users may  add  their  own
       definitions  to  the  palette  via  their  initialization  file.   <u>Redet</u> also keeps a list of the regular
       expressions executed,  from  which  entries  may  be  copied  back  into  the  regular  expression  under
       construction.  The  history  list  is  saved  to  a  file  and restored on startup, so it persists across
       sessions.

       <u>Redet</u> provides both regular expression matching and substitution so long as the underlying program does.

       Although <u>Redet</u> is primarily an interface for other programs, it adds some features of  its  own.   It  is
       possible  to  define  named character classes within <u>Redet</u>  and to intersect them. This allows provides a
       means of searching on feature matrices.

       So long as the underlying program supports Unicode, <u>redet</u> allows UTF-8 Unicode  in  both  test  data  and
       regular  expressions. Several tools provide additional support for Unicode use. These include popup lists
       of Unicode ranges and general character properties, a widget for entering characters by  their  numerical
       code,  and  widgets for entering International Phonetic Alphabet characters, widgets for entering letters
       with a variety of accents and other diacritics. Although internal operations  are  entirely  in  Unicode,
       test  data,  comparison  data,  and  results may be read and written in any encoding supported by Tcl/Tk.
       <u>Redet</u> is fully internationalized. If a suitable message catalogue is provided, the interface may be  made
       available  in  any  language  and  writing  system supported by Unicode for which the necessary fonts are
       available.

       For usage information, execute <u>redet</u> with the command line flag -h.

       Full information about <b>redet</b> is available from the reference manual, which  consists  of  a  set  of  web
       pages.  The  master  copy  is located at: <a href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~wjposer/RedetManual/Manual.html">http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~wjposer/RedetManual/Manual.html</a>.  The
       entry <u>Illustrated</u> <u>Web</u> <u>Manual</u> on the <u>Help</u> menu will take you to the master manual page.  The manual  pages
       are packaged with every copy of Redet.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-c</b> &lt;file name&gt;
              read character class definitions from the named file

       <b>-d</b>     set  the  debug  flag.  This causes additional information to be printed during program execution.
              It is mostly useful for developers.

       <b>-F</b> <b>&lt;filename&gt;</b>
              read a feature list from &lt;filename&gt;

       <b>-f</b>     act as a filter. This means that input is read from the standard input and output written  to  the
              standard output.

       <b>-H</b>     do not read the history file

       <b>-h</b>     print this help information

       <b>-I</b> &lt;file&gt;
              read &lt;file&gt; as the initialization file

       <b>-i</b>     do not read the initialization file

       <b>-n</b>     do not execute feature tests on startup

       <b>-P</b>     list the programs supported and indicate which are available

       <b>-p</b> &lt;program&gt;
              use the named program

       <b>-s</b>     start up in substitution mode

       <b>-t</b>     show the results of feature tests

       <b>-v</b>     print the program name and version, then exit
