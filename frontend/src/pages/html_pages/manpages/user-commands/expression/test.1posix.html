</pre><h4><b>PROLOG</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       test — evaluate expression

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       test <b>[</b><u>expression</u><b>]</b>

       [ <b>[</b><u>expression</u><b>]</b> ]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>test</u>  utility  shall  evaluate  the <u>expression</u> and indicate the result of the evaluation by its exit
       status. An exit status of zero indicates that the expression evaluated as true and an exit  status  of  1
       indicates that the expression evaluated as false.

       In  the  second  form  of the utility, where the utility name used is <u>[</u> rather than <u>test</u>, the application
       shall ensure that the closing square bracket is a separate argument. The <u>test</u>  and  <u>[</u>  utilities  may  be
       implemented as a single linked utility which examines the basename of the zeroth command line argument to
       determine  whether  to behave as the <u>test</u> or <u>[</u> variant. Applications using the <u>exec</u>() family of functions
       to execute these utilities shall ensure that the argument passed in <u>arg0</u> or <u>argv</u>[0] is <b>'['</b> when executing
       the <u>[</u> utility and has a basename of <b>"test"</b> when executing the <u>test</u> utility.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>test</u> utility shall not recognize the <b>"--"</b> argument in the manner specified by  Guideline  10  in  the
       Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <u>Section</u> <u>12.2</u>, <u>Utility</u> <u>Syntax</u> <u>Guidelines</u>.

       No options shall be supported.

</pre><h4><b>OPERANDS</b></h4><pre>
       The  application  shall  ensure  that  all  operators and elements of primaries are presented as separate
       arguments to the <u>test</u> utility.

       The following primaries can be used to construct <u>expression</u>:

       <b>-b</b> <u>pathname</u>
                 True if <u>pathname</u> resolves to an existing directory entry for a block special  file.   False  if
                 <u>pathname</u>  cannot be resolved, or if <u>pathname</u> resolves to an existing directory entry for a file
                 that is not a block special file.

       <b>-c</b> <u>pathname</u>
                 True if <u>pathname</u> resolves to an existing directory entry for a character special  file.   False
                 if  <u>pathname</u>  cannot  be resolved, or if <u>pathname</u> resolves to an existing directory entry for a
                 file that is not a character special file.

       <b>-d</b> <u>pathname</u>
                 True if <u>pathname</u> resolves to an existing directory entry for a  directory.  False  if  <u>pathname</u>
                 cannot  be  resolved, or if <u>pathname</u> resolves to an existing directory entry for a file that is
                 not a directory.

       <b>-e</b> <u>pathname</u>
                 True if <u>pathname</u> resolves to an existing directory entry. False if <u>pathname</u> cannot be resolved.

       <b>-f</b> <u>pathname</u>
                 True if <u>pathname</u> resolves to an existing directory entry for a regular file. False if  <u>pathname</u>
                 cannot  be  resolved, or if <u>pathname</u> resolves to an existing directory entry for a file that is
                 not a regular file.

       <b>-g</b> <u>pathname</u>
                 True if <u>pathname</u> resolves to an existing directory entry for a file that has  its  set-group-ID
                 flag  set.  False  if  <u>pathname</u>  cannot  be  resolved,  or  if <u>pathname</u> resolves to an existing
                 directory entry for a file that does not have its set-group-ID flag set.

       <b>-h</b> <u>pathname</u>
                 True if <u>pathname</u> resolves to an existing directory entry for a symbolic link. False if <u>pathname</u>
                 cannot be resolved, or if <u>pathname</u> resolves to an existing directory entry for a file  that  is
                 not  a symbolic link. If the final component of <u>pathname</u> is a symbolic link, that symbolic link
                 is not followed.

       <b>-L</b> <u>pathname</u>
                 True if <u>pathname</u> resolves to an existing directory entry for a symbolic link. False if <u>pathname</u>
                 cannot be resolved, or if <u>pathname</u> resolves to an existing directory entry for a file  that  is
                 not  a symbolic link. If the final component of <u>pathname</u> is a symbolic link, that symbolic link
                 is not followed.

       <b>-p</b> <u>pathname</u>
                 True if <u>pathname</u> resolves to an existing directory entry for a FIFO. False if  <u>pathname</u>  cannot
                 be  resolved,  or  if <u>pathname</u> resolves to an existing directory entry for a file that is not a
                 FIFO.

       <b>-r</b> <u>pathname</u>
                 True if <u>pathname</u> resolves to an existing directory entry for a file  for  which  permission  to
                 read  from  the  file  will  be  granted,  as defined in <u>Section</u> <u>1.1.1.4</u>, <u>File</u> <u>Read</u>, <u>Write</u>, <u>and</u>
                 <u>Creation</u>.  False if <u>pathname</u> cannot be  resolved,  or  if  <u>pathname</u>  resolves  to  an  existing
                 directory entry for a file for which permission to read from the file will not be granted.

       <b>-S</b> <u>pathname</u>
                 True if <u>pathname</u> resolves to an existing directory entry for a socket. False if <u>pathname</u> cannot
                 be  resolved,  or  if <u>pathname</u> resolves to an existing directory entry for a file that is not a
                 socket.

       <b>-s</b> <u>pathname</u>
                 True if <u>pathname</u> resolves to an existing directory entry for a file that  has  a  size  greater
                 than  zero.  False  if  <u>pathname</u>  cannot  be  resolved,  or if <u>pathname</u> resolves to an existing
                 directory entry for a file that does not have a size greater than zero.

       <b>-t</b> <u>file_descriptor</u>
                 True if file descriptor number <u>file_descriptor</u> is open and is associated with a terminal. False
                 if <u>file_descriptor</u> is not a  valid  file  descriptor  number,  or  if  file  descriptor  number
                 <u>file_descriptor</u> is not open, or if it is open but is not associated with a terminal.

       <b>-u</b> <u>pathname</u>
                 True  if  <u>pathname</u>  resolves to an existing directory entry for a file that has its set-user-ID
                 flag set. False if <u>pathname</u> cannot  be  resolved,  or  if  <u>pathname</u>  resolves  to  an  existing
                 directory entry for a file that does not have its set-user-ID flag set.

       <b>-w</b> <u>pathname</u>
                 True  if  <u>pathname</u>  resolves  to an existing directory entry for a file for which permission to
                 write to the file will be granted, as  defined  in  <u>Section</u>  <u>1.1.1.4</u>,  <u>File</u>  <u>Read</u>,  <u>Write</u>,  <u>and</u>
                 <u>Creation</u>.   False  if  <u>pathname</u>  cannot  be  resolved,  or  if <u>pathname</u> resolves to an existing
                 directory entry for a file for which permission to write to the file will not be granted.

       <b>-x</b> <u>pathname</u>
                 True if <u>pathname</u> resolves to an existing directory entry for a file  for  which  permission  to
                 execute  the  file  (or search it, if it is a directory) will be granted, as defined in <u>Section</u>
                 <u>1.1.1.4</u>, <u>File</u> <u>Read</u>, <u>Write</u>, <u>and</u> <u>Creation</u>.  False if <u>pathname</u> cannot be resolved, or if  <u>pathname</u>
                 resolves  to an existing directory entry for a file for which permission to execute (or search)
                 the file will not be granted.

       <b>-z</b> <u>string</u> True if the length of string <u>string</u> is zero; otherwise, false.

       <u>string</u>    True if the string <u>string</u> is not the null string; otherwise, false.

       <u>s1</u> <b>=</b> <u>s2</u>   True if the strings <u>s1</u> and <u>s2</u> are identical; otherwise, false.

       <u>s1</u> <b>!=</b> <u>s2</u>  True if the strings <u>s1</u> and <u>s2</u> are not identical; otherwise, false.

       <u>n1</u> <b>-eq</b> <u>n2</u> True if the integers <u>n1</u> and <u>n2</u> are algebraically equal; otherwise, false.

       <u>n1</u> <b>-ne</b> <u>n2</u> True if the integers <u>n1</u> and <u>n2</u> are not algebraically equal; otherwise, false.

       <u>n1</u> <b>-gt</b> <u>n2</u> True if the integer <u>n1</u> is algebraically greater than the integer <u>n2</u>; otherwise, false.

       <u>n1</u> <b>-ge</b> <u>n2</u> True if the integer <u>n1</u> is algebraically greater than or equal to  the  integer  <u>n2</u>;  otherwise,
                 false.

       <u>n1</u> <b>-lt</b> <u>n2</u> True if the integer <u>n1</u> is algebraically less than the integer <u>n2</u>; otherwise, false.

       <u>n1</u> <b>-le</b> <u>n2</u> True if the integer <u>n1</u> is algebraically less than or equal to the integer <u>n2</u>; otherwise, false.

       <u>expression1</u> <b>-a</b> <u>expression2</u>
                 True  if  both <u>expression1</u> and <u>expression2</u> are true; otherwise, false. The <b>-a</b> binary primary is
                 left associative. It has a higher precedence than <b>-o</b>.

       <u>expression1</u> <b>-o</b> <u>expression2</u>
                 True if either <u>expression1</u> or <u>expression2</u> is true; otherwise, false. The <b>-o</b> binary  primary  is
                 left associative.

       With  the  exception  of  the <b>-h</b> <u>pathname</u> and <b>-L</b> <u>pathname</u> primaries, if a <u>pathname</u> argument is a symbolic
       link, <u>test</u> shall evaluate the expression by resolving the symbolic link and using the file referenced  by
       the link.

       These primaries can be combined with the following operators:

       <b>!</b> <u>expression</u>
                 True if <u>expression</u> is false. False if <u>expression</u> is true.

       <b>(</b> <u>expression</u> <b>)</b>
                 True  if <u>expression</u> is true. False if <u>expression</u> is false. The parentheses can be used to alter
                 the normal precedence and associativity.

       The primaries with two elements of the form:

           -<u>primary_operator</u> <u>primary_operand</u>

       are known as <u>unary</u> <u>primaries</u>.  The primaries with three elements in either of the two forms:

           <u>primary_operand</u> -<u>primary_operator</u> <u>primary_operand</u>

           primary_operand primary_operator primary_operand

       are known as <u>binary</u> <u>primaries</u>.  Additional implementation-defined operators and <u>primary_operator</u>s may  be
       provided by implementations. They shall be of the form -<u>operator</u> where the first character of <u>operator</u> is
       not a digit.

       The  algorithm  for  determining  the  precedence  of  the  operators  and the return value that shall be
       generated is based on the number of arguments presented to <u>test</u>.  (However, when using the <b>"[...]"</b>  form,
       the &lt;right-square-bracket&gt; final argument shall not be counted in this algorithm.)

       In the following list, $1, $2, $3, and $4 represent the arguments presented to <u>test</u>:

       0 arguments:
                   Exit false (1).

       1 argument: Exit true (0) if $1 is not null; otherwise, exit false.

       2 arguments:
                    *  If $1 is <b>'!'</b>, exit true if $2 is null, false if $2 is not null.

                    *  If $1 is a unary primary, exit true if the unary test is true, false if the unary test is
                       false.

                    *  Otherwise, produce unspecified results.

       3 arguments:
                    *  If $2 is a binary primary, perform the binary test of $1 and $3.

                    *  If $1 is <b>'!'</b>, negate the two-argument test of $2 and $3.

                    *  If $1 is <b>'('</b> and $3 is <b>')'</b>, perform the unary test of $2.  On systems that do not support
                       the XSI option, the results are unspecified if $1 is <b>'('</b> and $3 is <b>')'</b>.

                    *  Otherwise, produce unspecified results.

       4 arguments:
                    *  If $1 is <b>'!'</b>, negate the three-argument test of $2, $3, and $4.

                    *  If  $1 is <b>'('</b> and $4 is <b>')'</b>, perform the two-argument test of $2 and $3.  On systems that
                       do not support the XSI option, the results are unspecified if $1 is <b>'('</b> and $4 is <b>')'</b>.

                    *  Otherwise, the results are unspecified.

       &gt;4 arguments:
                   The results are unspecified.

                   On XSI-conformant systems, combinations of primaries and operators shall be  evaluated  using
                   the  precedence  and  associativity  rules  described  previously.  In  addition,  the string
                   comparison binary primaries <b>'='</b> and <b>"!="</b> shall  have  a  higher  precedence  than  any  unary
                   primary.

</pre><h4><b>STDIN</b></h4><pre>
       Not used.

</pre><h4><b>INPUT</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of <u>test</u>:

       <u>LANG</u>      Provide a default value for the internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See the
                 Base  Definitions  volume  of POSIX.1‐2017, <u>Section</u> <u>8.2</u>, <u>Internationalization</u> <u>Variables</u> for the
                 precedence  of  internationalization  variables  used  to  determine  the  values   of   locale
                 categories.)

       <u>LC_ALL</u>    If  set  to a non-empty string value, override the values of all the other internationalization
                 variables.

       <u>LC_CTYPE</u>  Determine the locale for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of text  data  as  characters
                 (for example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments).

       <u>LC_MESSAGES</u>
                 Determine  the  locale  that  should  be  used  to affect the format and contents of diagnostic
                 messages written to standard error.

       <u>NLSPATH</u>   Determine the location of message catalogs for the processing of <u>LC_MESSAGES</u>.

</pre><h4><b>ASYNCHRONOUS</b> <b>EVENTS</b></h4><pre>
       Default.

</pre><h4><b>STDOUT</b></h4><pre>
       Not used.

</pre><h4><b>STDERR</b></h4><pre>
       The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.

</pre><h4><b>OUTPUT</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>EXTENDED</b> <b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       The following exit values shall be returned:

        0    <u>expression</u> evaluated to true.

        1    <u>expression</u> evaluated to false or <u>expression</u> was missing.

       &gt;1    An error occurred.

</pre><h4><b>CONSEQUENCES</b> <b>OF</b> <b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       Default.

       <u>The</u> <u>following</u> <u>sections</u> <u>are</u> <u>informative.</u>

</pre><h4><b>APPLICATION</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       The XSI extensions specifying the <b>-a</b> and <b>-o</b> binary primaries and the <b>'('</b>  and  <b>')'</b>  operators  have  been
       marked  obsolescent. (Many expressions using them are ambiguously defined by the grammar depending on the
       specific expressions being evaluated.) Scripts using these expressions should be converted to  the  forms
       given  below.  Even though many implementations will continue to support these obsolescent forms, scripts
       should be extremely careful when dealing with user-supplied input that could be confused with  these  and
       other primaries and operators. Unless the application developer knows all the cases that produce input to
       the script, invocations like:

           test "$1" -a "$2"

       should be written as:

           test "$1" &amp;&amp; test "$2"

       to  avoid  problems  if a user supplied values such as $1 set to <b>'!'</b>  and $2 set to the null string. That
       is, in cases where maximal portability is of concern, replace:

           test expr1 -a expr2

       with:

           test expr1 &amp;&amp; test expr2

       and replace:

           test expr1 -o expr2

       with:

           test expr1 || test expr2

       but note that, in <u>test</u>, <b>-a</b> has higher precedence than <b>-o</b> while <b>"&amp;&amp;"</b> and <b>"||"</b> have equal precedence in the
       shell.

       Parentheses or braces can be used in the shell command language to effect grouping.

       Parentheses must be escaped when using <u>sh</u>; for example:

           test \( expr1 -a expr2 \) -o expr3

       This command is not always portable even on XSI-conformant systems depending on the expressions specified
       by <u>expr</u>1, <u>expr</u>2, and <u>expr</u>3.  The following form can be used instead:

           ( test expr1 &amp;&amp; test expr2 ) || test expr3

       The two commands:

           test "$1"
           test ! "$1"

       could not be used reliably on some historical systems. Unexpected results would occur if  such  a  <u>string</u>
       expression were used and $1 expanded to <b>'!'</b>, <b>'('</b>, or a known unary primary. Better constructs are:

           test -n "$1"
           test -z "$1"

       respectively.

       Historical systems have also been unreliable given the common construct:

           test "$response" = "expected string"

       One of the following is a more reliable form:

           test "X$response" = "Xexpected string"
           test "expected string" = "$response"

       Note  that  the second form assumes that <u>expected</u> <u>string</u> could not be confused with any unary primary. If
       <u>expected</u> <u>string</u> starts with <b>'-'</b>, <b>'('</b>, <b>'!'</b>, or even <b>'='</b>, the first form should be used instead. Using  the
       preceding  rules  without the XSI marked extensions, any of the three comparison forms is reliable, given
       any input. (However, note that the strings are quoted in all cases.)

       Because the string comparison binary primaries, <b>'='</b> and <b>"!="</b>, have a higher  precedence  than  any  unary
       primary  in  the greater than 4 argument case, unexpected results can occur if arguments are not properly
       prepared. For example, in:

           test -d $1 -o -d $2

       If $1 evaluates to a possible directory name of <b>'='</b>, the first three arguments are  considered  a  string
       comparison,  which  shall  cause  a  syntax error when the second <b>-d</b> is encountered. One of the following
       forms prevents this; the second is preferred:

           test \( -d "$1" \) -o \( -d "$2" \)
           test -d "$1" || test -d "$2"

       Also in the greater than 4 argument case:

           test "$1" = "bat" -a "$2" = "ball"

       syntax errors occur if $1 evaluates to <b>'('</b> or <b>'!'</b>.  One of the following forms prevents this;  the  third
       is preferred:

           test "X$1" = "Xbat" -a "X$2" = "Xball"
           test "$1" = "bat" &amp;&amp; test "$2" = "ball"
           test "X$1" = "Xbat" &amp;&amp; test "X$2" = "Xball"

       Note that none of the following examples are permitted by the syntax described:

           [-f file]
           [-f file ]
           [ -f file]
           [ -f file
           test -f file ]

       In  the  first two cases, if a utility named <u>[‐f</u> exists, that utility would be invoked, and not <u>test</u>.  In
       the remaining cases, the brackets are mismatched, and the behavior is unspecified. However:

           test ! ]

       does have a defined meaning, and must exit with status 1. Similarly:

           test ]

       must exit with status 0.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
        1. Exit if there are not two or three arguments (two variations):

               if [ $# -ne 2 ] &amp;&amp; [ $# -ne 3 ]; then exit 1; fi
               if [ $# -lt 2 ] || [ $# -gt 3 ]; then exit 1; fi

        2. Perform a <u>mkdir</u> if a directory does not exist:

               test ! -d tempdir &amp;&amp; mkdir tempdir

        3. Wait for a file to become non-readable:

               while test -r thefile
               do
                   sleep 30
               done
               echo '"thefile" is no longer readable'

        4. Perform a command if the argument is one of three strings (two variations):

               if [ "$1" = "pear" ] || [ "$1" = "grape" ] || [ "$1" = "apple" ]
               then
                   <u>command</u>
               fi

               case "$1" in
                   pear|grape|apple) <u>command</u> ;;
               esac

</pre><h4><b>RATIONALE</b></h4><pre>
       The KornShell-derived conditional command (double bracket  <b>[[]]</b>)  was  removed  from  the  shell  command
       language  description in an early proposal. Objections were raised that the real problem is misuse of the
       <u>test</u> command (<b>[</b>), and putting it into the shell is the wrong way to fix  the  problem.   Instead,  proper
       documentation and a new shell reserved word (<b>!</b>)  are sufficient.

       Tests  that  require multiple <u>test</u> operations can be done at the shell level using individual invocations
       of the <u>test</u> command and shell logicals, rather than using the error-prone <b>-o</b> flag of <u>test</u>.

       XSI-conformant systems support more than four arguments.

       XSI-conformant systems support the combining of primaries with the following constructs:

       <u>expression1</u> <b>-a</b> <u>expression2</u>
             True if both <u>expression1</u> and <u>expression2</u> are true.

       <u>expression1</u> <b>-o</b> <u>expression2</u>
             True if at least one of <u>expression1</u> and <u>expression2</u> are true.

       <b>(</b> <u>expression</u> <b>)</b>
             True if <u>expression</u> is true.

       In evaluating these more complex combined expressions, the following precedence rules are used:

        *  The unary primaries have higher precedence than the algebraic binary primaries.

        *  The unary primaries have lower precedence than the string binary primaries.

        *  The unary and binary primaries have higher precedence than the unary <u>string</u> primary.

        *  The <b>!</b>  operator has higher precedence than the <b>-a</b> operator, and the <b>-a</b> operator has higher precedence
           than the <b>-o</b> operator.

        *  The <b>-a</b> and <b>-o</b> operators are left associative.

        *  The parentheses can be used to alter the normal precedence and associativity.

       The BSD and System V versions of <b>-f</b> are not the same. The BSD definition was:

       <b>-f</b> <u>file</u>   True if <u>file</u> exists and is not a directory.

       The SVID version (true if the file exists  and  is  a  regular  file)  was  chosen  for  this  volume  of
       POSIX.1‐2017  because  its  use  is consistent with the <b>-b</b>, <b>-c</b>, <b>-d</b>, and <b>-p</b> operands (<u>file</u> exists and is a
       specific file type).

       The <b>-e</b> primary, possessing similar functionality to that provided by the C shell, was  added  because  it
       provides  the  only  way for a shell script to find out if a file exists without trying to open the file.
       Since implementations are allowed to add additional file types, a portable script cannot use:

           test -b foo -o -c foo -o -d foo -o -f foo -o -p foo

       to find out if <b>foo</b> is an existing file. On historical BSD systems, the  existence  of  a  file  could  be
       determined by:

           test -f foo -o -d foo

       but  there  was no easy way to determine that an existing file was a regular file. An early proposal used
       the KornShell <b>-a</b> primary (with the same meaning), but this was changed to <b>-e</b> because there were  concerns
       about the high probability of humans confusing the <b>-a</b> primary with the <b>-a</b> binary operator.

       The  following  options  were  not included in this volume of POSIX.1‐2017, although they are provided by
       some implementations. These operands should not be used by new implementations for other purposes:

       <b>-k</b> <u>file</u>   True if <u>file</u> exists and its sticky bit is set.

       <b>-C</b> <u>file</u>   True if <u>file</u> is a contiguous file.

       <b>-V</b> <u>file</u>   True if <u>file</u> is a version file.

       The following option was not included because it was  undocumented  in  most  implementations,  has  been
       removed  from  some  implementations (including System V), and the functionality is provided by the shell
       (see <u>Section</u> <u>2.6.2</u>, <u>Parameter</u> <u>Expansion</u>.

       <b>-l</b> <u>string</u> The length of the string <u>string</u>.

       The <b>-b</b>, <b>-c</b>, <b>-g</b>, <b>-p</b>, <b>-u</b>, and <b>-x</b> operands are derived from the SVID; historical BSD does not provide  them.
       The <b>-k</b> operand is derived from System V; historical BSD does not provide it.

       On  historical  BSD  systems,  <u>test</u>  <b>-w</b>  <u>directory</u>  always  returned false because <u>test</u> tried to open the
       directory for writing, which always fails.

       Some additional primaries newly invented or from the KornShell appeared in an early proposal as  part  of
       the  conditional  command  (<b>[[]]</b>): <u>s1</u> <b>&gt;</b> <u>s2</u>, <u>s1</u> <b>&lt;</b> <u>s2</u>, <u>str</u> <b>=</b> <u>pattern</u>, <u>str</u> <b>!=</b> <u>pattern</u>, <u>f1</u> <b>-nt</b> <u>f2</u>, <u>f1</u> <b>-ot</b> <u>f2</u>,
       and <u>f1</u> <b>-ef</b> <u>f2</u>.  They were not carried forward into the <u>test</u> utility  when  the  conditional  command  was
       removed  from  the  shell  because  they have not been included in the <u>test</u> utility built into historical
       implementations of the <u>sh</u> utility.

       The <b>-t</b> <u>file_descriptor</u> primary is shown with a mandatory argument because the grammar is ambiguous if  it
       can be omitted. Historical implementations have allowed it to be omitted, providing a default of 1.

       It is noted that <b>'['</b> is not part of the portable filename character set; however, since it is required to
       be  encoded by a single byte, and is part of the portable character set, the name of this utility forms a
       character string across all supported locales.
