</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       wcalc - a natural-expression command-line calculator

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>wcalc</b> [ <u>options</u> ] [ <u>expression</u> <u>...</u> ]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       wcalc is a command-line calculator designed to accept all valid mathematical expressions. It supports all
       standard  mathematical  operations,  parenthesis,  brackets,  trigonometric  functions,  hyperbolic  trig
       functions, logs, and boolean operators.

       wcalc accepts input in a variety of manners. If no mathematical expression is given at  the  commandline,
       it  will  evaluate  the  contents  of  an  environment  variable named <u>wcalc_input</u> if one exists. If that
       variable is not set, wcalc will try to read input from standard input (i.e. piped input). If there is  no
       input from that, wcalc enters "interactive" mode. Interactive mode has more features.

       While  in interactive mode, detailed information about commands, functions, symbols, and variables can be
       obtained by executing: <b>\explain</b> <u>thing-to-explain</u>

   <b>OPTIONS</b>
       <b>-H</b> or <b>--help</b>
           Prints a help usage message to standard output, then exits.

       <b>-E</b>  Specifies that numerical output should be in scientific notation.

       <b>-EE</b> Specifies that numerical output should NOT be in scientific notation.

       <b>-P</b><u>XXX</u>
           Sets the "precision", or the number of decimal places displayed, to be <u>XXX</u>. This setting only affects
           output, not internal representations. If the precision is set to -1, the  number  of  decimal  places
           displayed will depend on the value.
           Precision is set to autoadjust (-1) by default.
           Example: wcalc -P6

       <b>-v</b> or <b>--version</b>
           Prints the version number and exits.

       <b>-d</b> or <b>-dec</b> or <b>--decimal</b>
           Results  are  printed  in  decimal (base 10). This option is the default, and does not have a default
           prefix to indicate that numbers are in base 10.

       <b>-h</b> or <b>-hex</b> or <b>--hexadecimal</b>
           Results are printed in hexadecimal (base 16). Numbers printed in hexadecimal  have  a  prefix  of  <u>0x</u>
           unless the <b>-p</b> or <b>--prefixes</b> option is used.

       <b>-o</b> or <b>-oct</b> or <b>--octal</b>
           Results  are  printed in octal (base 8). Numbers printed in octal have a prefix of <u>0</u> unless the <b>-p</b> or
           <b>--prefixes</b> option is used.

       <b>-b</b> or <b>-bin</b> or <b>--binary</b>
           Results are printed in binary (base 2). Numbers printed in binary have a prefix of <u>0b</u> unless  the  <b>-p</b>
           or <b>--prefixes</b> option is used.

       <b>-p</b> or <b>--prefixes</b>
           Toggles printing prefixes for hexadecimal, octal, and binary forms.

       <b>-l</b> or <b>--lenient</b>
           Makes the parser assume that uninitialized variables have a value of zero.

       <b>-r</b> or <b>--radians</b>
           Toggles  whether  trigonometric  functions  assume  input  (and  output)  is  in radians. By default,
           trigonometric functions assume input is in degrees.

       <b>-q</b> or <b>--quiet</b>
           Toggles whether the equals sign will be printed before the results.

       <b>-c</b> or <b>--conservative</b>
           Toggles accuracy guards. Because of the way floating point numbers  are  stored  in  computers,  some
           numbers  cannot be represented exactly (such as 0.1). Because of this, calculating with those numbers
           can produce results that are not <u>exactly</u> correct, but are different from the correct answer by a very
           small value (smaller than the floating point  value  can  represent  accurately).  For  example,  the
           calculation  of  1-.9-.1  can return an extremely small number that is not zero but is less than what
           can be represented accurately, and thus for all intents and purposes, it is  0.  The  accuracy  guard
           feature  will  round numbers to zero if they are less than the representable accuracy of the floating
           point number. However, sometimes numbers that small or smaller need to be  displayed,  and  thus  the
           accuracy  guard  should be turned off. Alternatively, the number of internal bits could be increased,
           which makes it possible to represent numbers with more accuracy.

       <b>-u</b> or <b>--units</b> [<u>type</u>]
           Prints units used for conversions; parameter <b>type</b> can be: lengths, areas,  volumes,  masses,  speeds,
           powers,  forces, accelerations, temperatures, angles, or pressures. If the parameter is not supplied,
           all units are printed.

       <b>--remember</b>
           Toggles whether or not expressions that produce errors are remembered in the history. Does not affect
           command-line math.

       <b>--round=</b> { <u>none</u> | <u>simple</u> | <u>sig_fig</u> }
           Wcalc can attempt to warn you when numbers have been rounded  in  the  output  display.  It  has  two
           methods  of  keeping  track---either  by  using  significant figures (sig_fig), or by a simple digit-
           counting algorithm. Rounding in the command-line version is denoted by a tilde before the equals sign
           (~=). Rounding in the GUI version is denoted by changing the text color to red. In some cases,  Wcalc
           may  think that the number has been rounded even if it shouldn't have been necessary (this is because
           of the way floating point numbers are represented internally).

       <b>--dsep=</b><u>X</u>
           Sets the decimal separator character to be X.

       <b>--tsep=</b><u>X</u>
           Sets the thousands separator character to be X.

       <b>--idsep=</b><u>X</u>
           Sets the input-only decimal separator character to be X.

       <b>--itsep=</b><u>X</u>
           Sets the input-only thousands separator character to be X.

       <b>--bits</b><u>XXXX</u>
           Sets the number of bits of memory that will be used to internally represent numbers to be  <u>XXXX</u>.  The
           default  is 1024. Set higher if you need to work with extremely large or extremely small numbers, set
           lower if you want to use less memory.

       <b>--ints</b>
           Toggles whether long integers will be abbreviated or not. This conflicts  with  engineering  notation
           for large numbers, but not for decimals.

       <b>--verbose</b>
           Toggles verbose mode, which displays the expression to be calculated before calculating it.

       <b>--defaults</b>
           Prevents reading the .wcalcrc file.

       <b>-C</b> or <b>--color</b>
           Toggles the use of color in the commandline output.

</pre><h4><b>USER-DEFINED</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       Variables are supported and may be assigned using the = operator. To assign a variable use the form:

              foo = anylegalexpression

       Thereafter, that variable name is the same as the literal value it represents.  Expressions can be stored
       in variables like this:

              foo = 'anylegalexpression'

       Expressions  stored  this  way  will be interpreted at evaluation time, rather than assignment-time. Note
       that these cannot be recursive.

       All variables may also be stored with a description of what they are. This description is  added  in  the
       form of a quoted string after the assignment, like this:

              foo = 'anylegalexpression' 'description'

   <b>ACTIVE</b> <b>VARIABLES</b>
       Active  variables  are  designed  to  give  a  functionality  similar to user-defined functions. They are
       variables that rather than representing a value, represent an expression that is evaluated  whenever  the
       variable is evaluated. This expression may contain other variable names. For example, after the following
       sequence of commands:

              foo=5
              bar='foo+4'

       The  variable  <u>bar</u>  will  evaluate  to  9,  or  four more than whatever <u>foo</u> evaluates to be. These can be
       stacked, like so:

              baz='sin(bar)+foo'

       In this case, <u>baz</u> will evaluate to be 5.15643, or the sin of whatever <u>foo</u>+4 is plus whatever <u>foo</u> is.

       To demonstrate the utility of these active variables, here  are  two  functions  written  by  Stephen  M.
       Lawson.  The  first  computes the weekday of a given day (<u>dy</u>) in a given month (<u>mo</u>) in a given year (<u>yr</u>).
       The value it returns is in the range of 1 to 7, where 1 is Sunday, 2 is Monday,  3  is  Tuesday,  and  so
       forth.

       weekday='(((floor((yr  - floor(0.6 + 1 / mo)) / 400) - floor((yr - floor(0.6 + 1 / mo)) / 100) + floor((5
       * (yr - floor(0.6 + 1 / mo))) / 4) + floor(13 * (mo + 12 * floor(0.6 + 1  /  mo)  +  1)  /  5))  -  (7  *
       floor((floor((yr - floor(0.6 + 1 / mo)) / 400) - floor((yr - floor(0.6 + 1 / mo)) / 100) + floor((5 * (yr
       -  floor(0.6 + 1 / mo))) / 4) + floor(13 * (mo + 12 * floor(0.6 + 1 / mo) + 1) / 5)) / 7)) + 1) + 5 + dy)
       % 7 + 1'

       The second function computes what day Easter will be for a given year (<u>yr</u>) and  returns  an  offset  from
       March  31st.  For example, for the year 2005, it returns -4, which means March 27th. Because of leap-year
       problems, this only works from the year 1900 to 2099, but is a good demonstration nevertheless.

       easter='((19 * (yr - 19 * floor(yr / 19)) + 24) - floor((19 * (yr - 19 * floor(yr / 19)) + 24)  /  30)  *
       30)  +  ((2  * (yr - 4 * floor(yr / 4)) + 4 * (yr - 7 * floor(yr / 7)) + 6 * ((19 * (yr - 19 * floor(yr /
       19)) + 24) - floor((19 * (yr - 19 * floor(yr / 19)) + 24) / 30) * 30) +  5)  -  floor((2  *  (yr  -  4  *
       floor(yr / 4)) + 4 * (yr - 7 * floor(yr / 7)) + 6 * ((19 * (yr - 19 * floor(yr / 19)) + 24) - floor((19 *
       (yr - 19 * floor(yr / 19)) + 24) / 30) * 30) + 5) / 7) * 7) - 9'

</pre><h4><b>BUILT-IN</b> <b>SYMBOLS</b></h4><pre>
       There are two basic kinds of built-in symbols in wcalc: functions and constants.

   <b>FUNCTIONS</b>
       The functions supported in wcalc are almost all self-explanatory. Here are the basic descriptions.

       <b>sin</b> <b>cos</b> <b>tan</b> <b>cot</b>
           The standard trigonometric functions

       <b>asin</b> <b>acos</b> <b>atan</b> <b>acot</b> or <b>arcsin</b> <b>arccos</b> <b>arctan</b> <b>arccot</b> or <b>sin^-1</b> <b>cos^-1</b> <b>tan^-1</b> <b>cot^-1</b>
           The standard arc- trigonometric functions.

       <b>round</b>
           Returns the integral value nearest to the argument according to the typical rounding rules.

       <b>abs</b> Returns the absolute value of the argument.

       <b>ceil</b> <b>ceiling</b> <b>floor</b>
           Returns the ceiling or floor of the argument.

       <b>sqrt</b> <b>cbrt</b>
           The square and cube root functions.

       <b>rand</b>
           Returns a random number between 0 and the number given.

       <b>irand</b>
           Returns a random integer between 0 and the number given.

       <b>fact</b>
           Returns the factorial of a number.

       <b>Gamma</b>
           Returns the value of the Gamma function at that value.

       <b>lnGamma</b>
           Returns the value of the log Gamma function at that value.

       <b>zeta</b>
           Returns the value of the Riemann zeta function at that value.

       <b>sinc</b>
           Returns the sinc function (for sinus cardinalis) of  the  input,  also  known  as  the  interpolation
           function,  filtering  function  or  the  first  spherical  Bessel  function, is the product of a sine
           function and a monotonically decreasing function.

   <b>CONSTANTS</b>
       Wcalc supports a lot of constants. Some are special (like  <b>pi</b>),  and  some  are  simply  mathematical  or
       physical   constants   that   have   been   hardcoded   in.   The   physics   constants  are  taken  from
       <u><a href="http://physics.nist.gov/constants">http://physics.nist.gov/constants</a></u>, and should all be in predictable SI units.

       The value of <b>pi</b> is special, as it is calculated to however many bits of  precision  have  been  specified
       with the <b>\bits</b> command. The default number of bits is 1024, or a value of:

       Similarly, all values that rely on the value of <b>pi</b>, like mu0, have the same level of precision. Here is a
       complete list of the symbols used to represent the constants hardcoded into wcalc:

</pre><h4><b>SPECIAL</b> <b>SYMBOLS</b></h4><pre>
       There are some special symbols that wcalc accept as input for compound operations.

       <b>@Inf@</b>  Symbol that represents Infinity

       <b>@NaN@</b>  Symbol that represents "Not a Number"

</pre><h4><b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       There are several commands that are supported in wcalc.

       <b>\p</b><u>XXX</u>  Sets  the  "precision",  or  the  number of decimal places displayed, to be <u>XXX</u>. This setting only
              affects output, not internal representations. If the precision is set to -1, the number of decimal
              places displayed will depend on the value. The default is -1.

       <b>\e</b> or <b>\eng</b> or <b>\engineering</b>
              Rotates between always using scientific notation, never using scientific notation, and choosing to
              do scientific notation when convenient. Can also take an argument that is one  of  <u>always</u>,  <u>never</u>,
              and <u>automatic</u> to choose a mode directly.

       <b>\help</b> or <b>?</b>
              Displays a help screen.

       <b>\prefs</b> Prints out the current preference settings.

       <b>\li</b> or <b>\list</b> or <b>\listvars</b>
              Prints out the currently defined variables.

       <b>\r</b> or <b>\radians</b>
              Toggles between using and not using radians for trigonometric calculations.

       <b>\cons</b> or <b>\conservative</b>
              Toggles  accuracy  guards. Because of the way floating point numbers are stored in computers, some
              numbers cannot be represented exactly (such as 0.1).  Because  of  this,  calculating  with  those
              numbers  can  produce  results  that  are  not exactly correct, but are different from the correct
              answer by a very small value (smaller than the floating point value can represent accurately). For
              example, the calculation of 1-.9-.1 can return an extremely small number that is not zero  but  is
              less  than what can be represented accurately, and thus for all intents and purposes, it is 0. The
              accuracy guard feature will round numbers to zero if they are less than the representable accuracy
              of the floating point number. However,  sometimes  numbers  that  small  or  smaller  need  to  be
              displayed, and thus the accuracy guard should be turned off. Alternatively, the number of internal
              bits could be increased, which makes it possible to represent numbers with more accuracy.

       <b>\p</b> or <b>\picky</b> or <b>\l</b> or <b>\lenient</b>
              Toggles  variable  parsing  rules.  When  wcalc  is  "picky" it will complain if you use undefined
              variables. If it is "lenient", wcalc will assume a value of 0 for undefined variables.

       <b>\re</b> or <b>\remember</b> or <b>\remember_errors</b>
              Toggles whether or not expressions that produce errors are remembered in the history.

       <b>\pre</b> or <b>\prefix</b> or <b>\prefixes</b>
              Toggles the display of prefixes for hexadecimal, octal, and binary output.

       <b>\b</b> or <b>\bin</b> or <b>\binary</b>
              Results are printed in binary (base 2). Numbers printed in binary have a prefix of <u>0b</u>  unless  the
              <b>\prefixes</b> command is used.

       <b>\d</b> or <b>\dec</b> or <b>\decimal</b>
              Results  are printed in decimal (base 10). This option is the default, and does not have a default
              prefix to indicate that numbers are in base 10.

       <b>\h</b> or <b>\x</b> or <b>\hex</b> or <b>\hexadecimal</b>
              Results are printed in hexadecimal (base 16). Numbers printed in hexadecimal have a prefix  of  <u>0x</u>
              unless the <b>\prefixes</b> command is used.

       <b>\o</b> or <b>\oct</b> or <b>\octal</b>
              Results  are  printed  in  octal  (base 8). Numbers printed in octal have a prefix of <u>0</u> unless the
              <b>\prefixes</b> command is used.

       <b>\round</b> <u>none</u>|<u>simple</u>|<u>sig_fig</u>
              Wcalc can attempt to warn you when numbers have been rounded in the output  display.  It  has  two
              methods  of  keeping  track---either by using significant figures (sig_fig), or by a simple digit-
              counting algorithm. Rounding in the command-line version is denoted by a tilde before  the  equals
              sign  (~=).  Rounding  in  the  GUI  version is denoted by changing the text color to red. In some
              cases, Wcalc may think that the number has been rounded even if it shouldn't have  been  necessary
              (this is because of the way floating point numbers are represented internally).

       <b>\dsep</b><u>X</u> Sets the decimal separator character to be <u>X</u>.

       <b>\tsep</b><u>X</u> Sets the thousands-place separator character to be <u>X</u>.

       <b>\idsep</b><u>X</u>
              Sets the input-only decimal separator character to be <u>X</u>.

       <b>\itsep</b><u>X</u>
              Sets the input-only thousands-place separator character to be <u>X</u>.

       <b>\hlimit</b><u>X</u>
              Sets the limit (<u>X</u>) on the length of the history.

       <b>\open</b> <u>filename.txt</u>
              Loads file <u>filename.txt</u>.

       <b>\save</b> <u>filename.txt</u>
              Saves the current session and variable list to a file, <u>filename.txt</u>.

       <b>\bits</b><u>XXXX</u>
              Sets the number of bits of precision that will be used to internally represent numbers to be <u>XXXX</u>.
              The  default  is  1024.  Set  higher if you need more precision, set lower if you want to use less
              memory.

       <b>\ints</b>  Toggles whether long integers will be abbreviated or not. This conflicts with engineering notation
              for large numbers, but not for decimals.

       <b>\prefs</b> or <b>\preferences</b>
              Displays the current preference settings.

       <b>\convert</b> <u>unit1</u> <u>unit2</u>
              Converts the previous answer from <u>unit1</u> to <u>unit2</u>.

       <b>\store</b> <u>variablename</u>
              Saves the specified variable in the preload file, <a href="file:~/.wcalc_preload">~/.wcalc_preload</a>

       <b>\explain</b> <u>object</u>
              Explains the specified object. The object can be a variable, constant, function, or command.

       <b>\verbose</b>
              Verbose mode displays the expression to be calculated before calculating it.

       <b>\del</b> or <b>\delim</b> or <b>\delimiters</b>
              Display delimiters in numerical output.

       <b>\cmod</b>  Toggle between C-style modulus operation and a more flexible method.

       <b>\color</b> Toggles the use of color in the commandline output.

</pre><h4><b>PREFERENCES</b></h4><pre>
       Preferences and settings can be retained between invocations  of  wcalc  by  storing  them  in  the  file
       <b><a href="file:~/.wcalcrc">~/.wcalcrc</a></b>

       The  format of the file is that each line is either blank or an assignment. Comments are ignored, and are
       defined as anything to the right of and including a hash mark (#). Assignments are of the form: <u>key=value</u>

       The possible keys are:

       <b>precision</b>
              A number defining the display precision. Equivalent to the <b>\P</b> command, where -1 means  "auto"  and
              anything  else  specifies the number of decimal places. This does not affect the behind-the-scenes
              precision.

       <b>show_equals</b>
              Either true ("yes" or "true") or false  (anything  else).  Equivalent  to  the  <b>--quiet</b>  argument.
              Specifies whether answers will begin with an equals sign or not.

       <b>engineering</b>
              Either  "always",  "never",  or  "automatic".  Equivalent  to  the <b>\engineering</b> command. Specifies
              whether answers will be displayed in engineering notation or not.

       <b>use_radians</b>
              Either true ("yes" or "true") or false  (anything  else).  Equivalent  to  the  <b>\radians</b>  command.
              Specifies whether trigonometric functions accept input in radians or degrees.

       <b>print_prefixes</b>
              Either  true  ("yes"  or  "true")  or  false (anything else). Equivalent to the <b>\prefixes</b> command.
              Specifies whether base prefixes (e.g. 0x for hexadecimal numbers) are used when displaying output.

       <b>save_errors</b>
              Either true ("yes" or "true")  or  false  (anything  else).  Equivalent  to  the  <b>\remember_errors</b>
              command. Specifies whether lines that contain a syntax error are added to the history or not.

       <b>precision_guard</b>
              Either  true  ("yes" or "true") or false (anything else). Equivalent to the <b>\conservative</b> command.
              Specifies whether the display  will  attempt  to  eliminate  numbers  too  small  to  be  accurate
              (hopefully, these are only errors created by the binary approximation of the inputs).

       <b>print_integers</b>
              Either true ("yes" or "true") or false (anything else). Equivalent to the <b>\ints</b> command. Specifies
              whether  whole  integers  will  be  printed un-abbreviated or not. This conflicts with engineering
              notation for large integers, but not for decimals.

       <b>print_delimiters</b>
              Either true ("yes" or "true") or false (anything else). Equivalent  to  the  <b>\delimiters</b>  command.
              Specifies whether delimiters will be added to output when displaying.

       <b>thousands_delimiter</b>
              Uses  the  next  character  after  the  equals sign as its value. Equivalent to the <b>\tsep</b> command.
              Specifies what the thousands delimiter is, and can affect output if <b>print_delimiters</b> is enabled.

       <b>decimal_delimiter</b>
              Uses the next character after the equals sign as its  value.  Equivalent  to  the  <b>\dsep</b>  command.
              Specifies what the decimal delimiter is.

       <b>input_thousands_delimiter</b>
              Uses  the  next  character  after  the equals sign as its value. Equivalent to the <b>\itsep</b> command.
              Specifies what the input-only thousands delimiter is, and cannot affect output.

       <b>input_decimal_delimiter</b>
              Uses the next character after the equals sign as its value.  Equivalent  to  the  <b>\idsep</b>  command.
              Specifies what the input-only decimal delimiter is, and cannot affect output.

       <b>history_limit</b>
              Either "no", for no limit, or a number. Equivalent to the <b>\hlimit</b> command.

       <b>output_format</b>
              Either <u>decimal</u>, <u>octal</u>, <u>binary</u>, <u>hex</u>, or <u>hexadecimal</u>.

       <b>rounding_indication</b>
              Either <u>no</u>, <u>simple</u>, or <u>sig_fig</u>. Equivalent to the <b>\rounding</b> command.

       <b>c_style_mod</b>
              Either true ("yes" or "true") or false (anything else). Equivalent to the <b>\cmod</b> command. Specifies
              whether  the  modulo operator (%) will behave as it does in the C programming language, or whether
              it will use a more flexible method. This only affects modulo operations where negative numbers are
              involved. As an example, with <b>c_style_mod</b> set to true (the default):

              -340 % 60 == -40; 340 % -60 == 40; -340 % -60 == -40

              However, with <b>c_style_mod</b> set to false:

              -340 % 60 == -40; 340 % -60 == -20; -340 % -60 == 20

       <b>color</b>  Either true ("yes" or "true")  or  false  (anything  else).  Equivalent  to  the  <b>\color</b>  command.
              Specifies whether the commandline interface will use color in its output or not.

       <b>colors[</b><u>XXX</u><b>]</b>
              This  is  used  to  specify the color of specific interface elements in the commandline interface.
              Valid colors are:
                     (bold)black
                     (bold)red
                     (bold)green
                     (bold)yellow
                     (bold)blue
                     (bold)magenta
                     (bold)cyan
                     (bold)white
              The <u>XXX</u> must be one of the following values:
                     conversion_category
                     conversion_unit
                     prompt
                     approx_answer

                     explanation

</pre><h4><b>PRELOAD</b></h4><pre>
       Wcalc uses a file, <b><a href="file:~/.wcalc_preload">~/.wcalc_preload</a></b>, to store persistent information between instances.  Typically,  this
       is  used  to store variables that are frequently defined. This file can be edited by hand with a standard
       text editor. There is also a command within wcalc (<b>\store</b>) to append a variable definition to the end  of
       this  file.  Any  variable  defined  in  this  file  is  defined  and available for use in any subsequent
       invocation of wcalc.
