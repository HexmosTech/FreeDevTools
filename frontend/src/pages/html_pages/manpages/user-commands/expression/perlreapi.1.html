</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       perlreapi - Perl regular expression plugin interface

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       As of Perl 5.9.5 there is a new interface for plugging and using regular expression engines other than
       the default one.

       Each engine is supposed to provide access to a constant structure of the following format:

           typedef struct regexp_engine {
               REGEXP* (*comp) (pTHX_
                                const SV * const pattern, const U32 flags);
               I32     (*exec) (pTHX_
                                REGEXP * const rx,
                                char* stringarg,
                                char* strend, char* strbeg,
                                SSize_t minend, SV* sv,
                                void* data, U32 flags);
               char*   (*intuit) (pTHX_
                                  REGEXP * const rx, SV *sv,
                                  const char * const strbeg,
                                  char *strpos, char *strend, U32 flags,
                                  struct re_scream_pos_data_s *data);
               SV*     (*checkstr) (pTHX_ REGEXP * const rx);
               void    (*free) (pTHX_ REGEXP * const rx);
               void    (*numbered_buff_FETCH) (pTHX_
                                               REGEXP * const rx,
                                               const I32 paren,
                                               SV * const sv);
               void    (*numbered_buff_STORE) (pTHX_
                                               REGEXP * const rx,
                                               const I32 paren,
                                               SV const * const value);
               I32     (*numbered_buff_LENGTH) (pTHX_
                                                REGEXP * const rx,
                                                const SV * const sv,
                                                const I32 paren);
               SV*     (*named_buff) (pTHX_
                                      REGEXP * const rx,
                                      SV * const key,
                                      SV * const value,
                                      U32 flags);
               SV*     (*named_buff_iter) (pTHX_
                                           REGEXP * const rx,
                                           const SV * const lastkey,
                                           const U32 flags);
               SV*     (*qr_package)(pTHX_ REGEXP * const rx);
           #ifdef USE_ITHREADS
               void*   (*dupe) (pTHX_ REGEXP * const rx, CLONE_PARAMS *param);
           #endif
               REGEXP* (*op_comp) (...);

       When a regexp is compiled, its "engine" field is then set to point at the appropriate structure, so that
       when it needs to be used Perl can find the right routines to do so.

       In order to install a new regexp handler, $^H{regcomp} is set to an integer which (when casted
       appropriately) resolves to one of these structures.  When compiling, the "comp" method is executed, and
       the resulting "regexp" structure's engine field is expected to point back at the same structure.

       The pTHX_ symbol in the definition is a macro used by Perl under threading to provide an extra argument
       to the routine holding a pointer back to the interpreter that is executing the regexp. So under threading
       all routines get an extra argument.

</pre><h4><b>Callbacks</b></h4><pre>
   <b>comp</b>
           REGEXP* comp(pTHX_ const SV * const pattern, const U32 flags);

       Compile the pattern stored in "pattern" using the given "flags" and return a pointer to a prepared
       "REGEXP" structure that can perform the match.  See "The REGEXP structure" below for an explanation of
       the individual fields in the REGEXP struct.

       The "pattern" parameter is the scalar that was used as the pattern.  Previous versions of Perl would pass
       two "char*" indicating the start and end of the stringified pattern; the following snippet can be used to
       get the old parameters:

           STRLEN plen;
           char*  exp = SvPV(pattern, plen);
           char* xend = exp + plen;

       Since any scalar can be passed as a pattern, it's possible to implement an engine that does something
       with an array (""ook" =~ [ qw/ eek hlagh / ]") or with the non-stringified form of a compiled regular
       expression (""ook" =~ qr/eek/").  Perl's own engine will always stringify everything using the snippet
       above, but that doesn't mean other engines have to.

       The "flags" parameter is a bitfield which indicates which of the "msixpn" flags the regex was compiled
       with.  It also contains additional info, such as if "use locale" is in effect.

       The "eogc" flags are stripped out before being passed to the comp routine.  The regex engine does not
       need to know if any of these are set, as those flags should only affect what Perl does with the pattern
       and its match variables, not how it gets compiled and executed.

       By the time the comp callback is called, some of these flags have already had effect (noted below where
       applicable).  However most of their effect occurs after the comp callback has run, in routines that read
       the "rx-&gt;extflags" field which it populates.

       In general the flags should be preserved in "rx-&gt;extflags" after compilation, although the regex engine
       might want to add or delete some of them to invoke or disable some special behavior in Perl.  The flags
       along with any special behavior they cause are documented below:

       The pattern modifiers:

       "/m" - RXf_PMf_MULTILINE
           If this is in "rx-&gt;extflags" it will be passed to "Perl_fbm_instr" by "pp_split" which will treat the
           subject string as a multi-line string.

       "/s" - RXf_PMf_SINGLELINE
       "/i" - RXf_PMf_FOLD
       "/x" - RXf_PMf_EXTENDED
           If present on a regex, "#" comments will be handled differently by the tokenizer in some cases.

           TODO: Document those cases.

       "/p" - RXf_PMf_KEEPCOPY
           TODO: Document this

       Character set
           The  character  set  rules  are determined by an enum that is contained in this field.  This is still
           experimental and subject to change, but the current interface returns the rules by use of the in-line
           function "get_regex_charset(const U32 flags)".  The only currently documented value returned from  it
           is  REGEX_LOCALE_CHARSET,  which  is  set if "use locale" is in effect. If present in "rx-&gt;extflags",
           "split" will use the locale dependent definition of whitespace when RXf_SKIPWHITE or RXf_WHITE is  in
           effect.  ASCII whitespace is defined as per isSPACE, and by the internal macros "is_utf8_space" under
           UTF-8, and "isSPACE_LC" under "use locale".

       Additional flags:

       RXf_SPLIT
           This  flag  was  removed  in  perl  5.18.0.   "split  ' '" is now special-cased solely in the parser.
           RXf_SPLIT is still #defined, so you can test for it.  This is how it used to work:

           If "split" is invoked as "split ' '" or with no arguments (which really means "split(' ',  $_)",  see
           split),  Perl  will  set this flag.  The regex engine can then check for it and set the SKIPWHITE and
           WHITE extflags.  To do this, the Perl engine does:

               if (flags &amp; RXf_SPLIT &amp;&amp; r-&gt;prelen == 1 &amp;&amp; r-&gt;precomp[0] == ' ')
                   r-&gt;extflags |= (RXf_SKIPWHITE|RXf_WHITE);

       These flags can be set during compilation to enable optimizations in the "split" operator.

       RXf_SKIPWHITE
           This flag was removed in perl 5.18.0.  It is still #defined, so you can set it,  but  doing  so  will
           have no effect.  This is how it used to work:

           If the flag is present in "rx-&gt;extflags" "split" will delete whitespace from the start of the subject
           string  before  it's operated on.  What is considered whitespace depends on if the subject is a UTF-8
           string and if the "RXf_PMf_LOCALE" flag is set.

           If RXf_WHITE is set in addition to this flag, "split" will behave like "split "  ""  under  the  Perl
           engine.

       RXf_START_ONLY
           Tells  the  split  operator  to split the target string on newlines ("\n") without invoking the regex
           engine.

           Perl's engine sets this if the pattern is "/^/" ("plen == 1 &amp;&amp; *exp == '^'"), even under "/^/s";  see
           split.   Of course a different regex engine might want to use the same optimizations with a different
           syntax.

       RXf_WHITE
           Tells the split operator to split the target string on whitespace without invoking the regex  engine.
           The  definition  of  whitespace  varies depending on if the target string is a UTF-8 string and on if
           RXf_PMf_LOCALE is set.

           Perl's engine sets this flag if the pattern is "\s+".

       RXf_NULL
           Tells the split operator to split the target string  on  characters.   The  definition  of  character
           varies depending on if the target string is a UTF-8 string.

           Perl's  engine  sets this flag on empty patterns, this optimization makes "split //" much faster than
           it would otherwise be.  It's even faster than "unpack".

       RXf_NO_INPLACE_SUBST
           Added in perl 5.18.0, this flag indicates that a regular expression might perform an  operation  that
           would  interfere  with  inplace  substitution. For instance it might contain lookbehind, or assign to
           non-magical variables (such as $REGMARK and $REGERROR) during matching.   "s///"  will  skip  certain
           optimisations when this is set.

   <b>exec</b>
           I32 exec(pTHX_ REGEXP * const rx,
                    char *stringarg, char* strend, char* strbeg,
                    SSize_t minend, SV* sv,
                    void* data, U32 flags);

       Execute a regexp. The arguments are

       rx  The regular expression to execute.

       sv  This  is  the  SV  to  be  matched against.  Note that the actual char array to be matched against is
           supplied by the arguments described below; the SV is just used to determine UTF8ness, pos() etc.

       strbeg
           Pointer to the physical start of the string.

       strend
           Pointer to the character following the physical end of the string (i.e.  the "\0", if any).

       stringarg
           Pointer to the position in the string where matching should start; it might not be equal to  "strbeg"
           (for example in a later iteration of "/.../g").

       minend
           Minimum  length of string (measured in bytes from "stringarg") that must match; if the engine reaches
           the end of the match but hasn't reached this position in the string, it should fail.

       data
           Optimisation data; subject to change.

       flags
           Optimisation flags; subject to change.

   <b>intuit</b>
           char* intuit(pTHX_
                       REGEXP * const rx,
                       SV *sv,
                       const char * const strbeg,
                       char *strpos,
                       char *strend,
                       const U32 flags,
                       struct re_scream_pos_data_s *data);

       Find the start position where a regex match should be attempted, or possibly if the regex  engine  should
       not  be  run  because the pattern can't match.  This is called, as appropriate, by the core, depending on
       the values of the "extflags" member of the "regexp" structure.

       Arguments:

           rx:     the regex to match against
           sv:     the SV being matched: only used for utf8 flag; the string
                   itself is accessed via the pointers below. Note that on
                   something like an overloaded SV, SvPOK(sv) may be false
                   and the string pointers may point to something unrelated to
                   the SV itself.
           strbeg: real beginning of string
           strpos: the point in the string at which to begin matching
           strend: pointer to the byte following the last char of the string
           flags   currently unused; set to 0
           data:   currently unused; set to NULL

   <b>checkstr</b>
           SV* checkstr(pTHX_ REGEXP * const rx);

       Return a SV containing a string that must appear in the pattern. Used by "split" for optimising matches.

   <b>free</b>
           void free(pTHX_ REGEXP * const rx);

       Called by Perl when it is freeing a regexp pattern so that the engine can release any  resources  pointed
       to  by  the  "pprivate"  member  of the "regexp" structure.  This is only responsible for freeing private
       data; Perl will handle releasing anything else contained in the "regexp" structure.

   <b>Numbered</b> <b>capture</b> <b>callbacks</b>
       Called to get/set the value of "$`", "$'", $&amp; and their named  equivalents,  ${^PREMATCH},  ${^POSTMATCH}
       and ${^MATCH}, as well as the numbered capture groups ($1, $2, ...).

       The  "paren"  parameter  will  be 1 for $1, 2 for $2 and so forth, and have these symbolic values for the
       special variables:

           ${^PREMATCH}  RX_BUFF_IDX_CARET_PREMATCH
           ${^POSTMATCH} RX_BUFF_IDX_CARET_POSTMATCH
           ${^MATCH}     RX_BUFF_IDX_CARET_FULLMATCH
           $`            RX_BUFF_IDX_PREMATCH
           $'            RX_BUFF_IDX_POSTMATCH
           $&amp;            RX_BUFF_IDX_FULLMATCH

       Note that in Perl 5.17.3 and earlier, the last three constants were also used for the caret  variants  of
       the variables.

       The  names  have been chosen by analogy with Tie::Scalar methods names with an additional <b>LENGTH</b> callback
       for efficiency.  However named capture variables are currently not tied internally  but  implemented  via
       magic.

       <u>numbered_buff_FETCH</u>

           void numbered_buff_FETCH(pTHX_ REGEXP * const rx, const I32 paren,
                                    SV * const sv);

       Fetch  a specified numbered capture.  "sv" should be set to the scalar to return, the scalar is passed as
       an argument rather than being returned from the function because when it's  called  Perl  already  has  a
       scalar  to  store  the  value,  creating  another  one  would  be  redundant.  The scalar can be set with
       "sv_setsv", "sv_setpvn" and friends, see perlapi.

       This callback is where Perl untaints its own capture variables under taint mode (see perlsec).   See  the
       "Perl_reg_numbered_buff_fetch"  function  in  <u>regcomp.c</u>  for  how  to untaint capture variables if that's
       something you'd like your engine to do as well.

       <u>numbered_buff_STORE</u>

           void    (*numbered_buff_STORE) (pTHX_
                                           REGEXP * const rx,
                                           const I32 paren,
                                           SV const * const value);

       Set the value of a numbered capture variable.  "value" is the scalar that is to be used as the new value.
       It's up to the engine to make sure this is used as the new value (or reject it).

       Example:

           if ("ook" =~ /(o*)/) {
               # 'paren' will be '1' and 'value' will be 'ee'
               $1 =~ tr/o/e/;
           }

       Perl's own engine will croak on any attempt to modify the capture variables, to do this in another engine
       use the following callback (copied from "Perl_reg_numbered_buff_store"):

           void
           Example_reg_numbered_buff_store(pTHX_
                                           REGEXP * const rx,
                                           const I32 paren,
                                           SV const * const value)
           {
               PERL_UNUSED_ARG(rx);
               PERL_UNUSED_ARG(paren);
               PERL_UNUSED_ARG(value);

               if (!PL_localizing)
                   Perl_croak(aTHX_ PL_no_modify);
           }

       Actually Perl will not <u>always</u> croak in a statement that looks like it would  modify  a  numbered  capture
       variable.   This  is  because the STORE callback will not be called if Perl can determine that it doesn't
       have to modify the value.  This is exactly how tied variables behave in the same situation:

           package CaptureVar;
           use parent 'Tie::Scalar';

           sub TIESCALAR { bless [] }
           sub FETCH { undef }
           sub STORE { die "This doesn't get called" }

           package main;

           tie my $sv =&gt; "CaptureVar";
           $sv =~ y/a/b/;

       Because $sv is "undef" when the "y///" operator is applied to  it,  the  transliteration  won't  actually
       execute and the program won't "die".  This is different to how 5.8 and earlier versions behaved since the
       capture  variables  were  READONLY  variables  then; now they'll just die when assigned to in the default
       engine.

       <u>numbered_buff_LENGTH</u>

           I32 numbered_buff_LENGTH (pTHX_
                                     REGEXP * const rx,
                                     const SV * const sv,
                                     const I32 paren);

       Get the "length" of a capture variable.  There's a special callback for this so that Perl doesn't have to
       do a FETCH and run "length" on the result, since the length is (in Perl's  case)  known  from  an  offset
       stored in "rx-&gt;offs", this is much more efficient:

           I32 s1  = rx-&gt;offs[paren].start;
           I32 s2  = rx-&gt;offs[paren].end;
           I32 len = t1 - s1;

       This  is  a  little  bit more complex in the case of UTF-8, see what "Perl_reg_numbered_buff_length" does
       with is_utf8_string_loclen.

   <b>Named</b> <b>capture</b> <b>callbacks</b>
       Called to get/set the value of "%+" and "%-", as well as by some utility functions in re.

       There are two callbacks, "named_buff" is called in all the cases the FETCH, STORE, DELETE, CLEAR,  EXISTS
       and  SCALAR  Tie::Hash  callbacks  would be on changes to "%+" and "%-" and "named_buff_iter" in the same
       cases as FIRSTKEY and NEXTKEY.

       The "flags" parameter can be used to determine which of these operations the callbacks should respond to.
       The following flags are currently defined:

       Which Tie::Hash operation is being performed from the Perl level on "%+" or "%+", if any:

           RXapif_FETCH
           RXapif_STORE
           RXapif_DELETE
           RXapif_CLEAR
           RXapif_EXISTS
           RXapif_SCALAR
           RXapif_FIRSTKEY
           RXapif_NEXTKEY

       If "%+" or "%-" is being operated on, if any.

           RXapif_ONE /* %+ */
           RXapif_ALL /* %- */

       If this is being called as "re::regname", "re::regnames" or "re::regnames_count", if any.  The first  two
       will be combined with "RXapif_ONE" or "RXapif_ALL".

           RXapif_REGNAME
           RXapif_REGNAMES
           RXapif_REGNAMES_COUNT

       Internally  "%+"  and  "%-"  are implemented with a real tied interface via Tie::Hash::NamedCapture.  The
       methods  in  that  package   will   call   back   into   these   functions.    However   the   usage   of
       Tie::Hash::NamedCapture  for  this  purpose  might change in future releases.  For instance this might be
       implemented by magic instead (would need an extension to mgvtbl).

       <u>named_buff</u>

           SV*     (*named_buff) (pTHX_ REGEXP * const rx, SV * const key,
                                  SV * const value, U32 flags);

           SV*     (*named_buff_iter) (pTHX_

                                       const U32 flags);

   <b>qr_package</b>
           SV* qr_package(pTHX_ REGEXP * const rx);

       The package the qr// magic object is blessed into (as seen  by  "ref  qr//").   It  is  recommended  that
       engines  change  this to their package name for identification regardless of if they implement methods on
       the object.

       The  package  this  method  returns  should  also  have  the  internal  "Regexp"  package  in  its  @ISA.
       "qr//-&gt;isa("Regexp")" should always be true regardless of what engine is being used.

       Example implementation might be:

           SV*
           Example_qr_package(pTHX_ REGEXP * const rx)
           {
               PERL_UNUSED_ARG(rx);
               return newSVpvs("re::engine::Example");
           }

       Any method calls on an object created with "qr//" will be dispatched to the package as a normal object.

           use re::engine::Example;
           my $re = qr//;
           $re-&gt;meth; # dispatched to re::engine::Example::meth()

       To  retrieve  the  "REGEXP"  object  from  the scalar in an XS function use the "SvRX" macro, see "REGEXP
       Functions" in perlapi.

           void meth(SV * rv)
           PPCODE:
               REGEXP * re = SvRX(sv);

   <b>dupe</b>
           void* dupe(pTHX_ REGEXP * const rx, CLONE_PARAMS *param);

       On threaded builds a regexp may need to be duplicated so  that  the  pattern  can  be  used  by  multiple
       threads.   This  routine  is  expected  to  handle  the duplication of any private data pointed to by the
       "pprivate" member of the "regexp" structure.  It will be called  with  the  preconstructed  new  "regexp"
       structure  as  an argument, the "pprivate" member will point at the <b>old</b> private structure, and it is this
       routine's responsibility to construct a copy and return a pointer to it (which  Perl  will  then  use  to
       overwrite the field as passed to this routine.)

       This  allows  the  engine to dupe its private data but also if necessary modify the final structure if it
       really must.

       On unthreaded builds this field doesn't exist.

   <b>op_comp</b>
       This is private to the Perl core and subject to change. Should be left null.

</pre><h4><b>The</b> <b>REGEXP</b> <b>structure</b></h4><pre>
       The REGEXP struct is defined in <u>regexp.h</u>.  All regex engines must be  able  to  correctly  build  such  a
       structure in their "comp" routine.

       The  REGEXP  structure  contains  all  the  data that Perl needs to be aware of to properly work with the
       regular expression.  It includes data about optimisations that Perl can use to  determine  if  the  regex
       engine  should really be used, and various other control info that is needed to properly execute patterns
       in various contexts, such as if the pattern anchored in some way, or what  flags  were  used  during  the
       compile, or if the program contains special constructs that Perl needs to be aware of.

       In  addition  it  contains  two  fields  that  are  intended for the private use of the regex engine that
       compiled the pattern.  These are the "intflags" and "pprivate" members.  "pprivate" is a void pointer  to
       an  arbitrary  structure,  whose  use and management is the responsibility of the compiling engine.  Perl
       will never modify either of these values.

       Most of the fields contained in this structure are accessed via macros with a prefix of "RX_" or  "RXp_".
       The fields are discussed in more detail below:

   <b>"engine"</b>
       This  field  points at a "regexp_engine" structure which contains pointers to the subroutines that are to
       be used for performing a match.  It is the compiling routine's  responsibility  to  populate  this  field
       before returning the regexp object.

       Internally  this  is set to "NULL" unless a custom engine is specified in $^H{regcomp}, Perl's own set of
       callbacks can be accessed in the struct pointed to by "RE_ENGINE_PTR".

   <b>"mother_re"</b>
       This is a pointer to another struct regexp which this one was derived from. "qr//" objects means that the
       same regexp pattern can be used in different contexts at the same time,  and  as  long  as  match  status
       information  is  stored  in  the structure (there are plans to change this eventually) we need to support
       having multiple copies of the structure in use at the same time. The fields related to the regexp program
       itself are copied from the mother_re, and owned by the mother_re, whereas the match state  variables  are
       owned by the struct itself.

   <b>"extflags"</b>
       This  will  be  used by Perl to see what flags the regexp was compiled with, this will normally be set to
       the value of the flags parameter by the comp callback.  See the comp documentation for valid flags.

   <b>"minlen"</b> <b>"minlenret"</b>
       The minimum string length (in characters) required for the pattern to match.  This is used to  prune  the
       search  space  by not bothering to match any closer to the end of a string than would allow a match.  For
       instance there is no point in even starting the regex engine if the minlen is 10 but the string is only 5
       characters long.  There is no way that the pattern can match.

       "minlenret" is the minimum length (in characters) of the string that would be found in $&amp; after a match.

       The difference between "minlen" and "minlenret" can be seen in the following pattern:

           /ns(?=\d)/

       where the "minlen" would be 3 but "minlenret" would only be 2 as the \d is required to match but  is  not
       actually included in the matched content.  This distinction is particularly important as the substitution
       logic  uses the "minlenret" to tell if it can do in-place substitutions (these can result in considerable
       speed-up).

   <b>"gofs"</b>
       Left offset from <b>pos()</b> to start match at.

   <b>"substrs"</b>
       Substring data about strings that must appear in the final match.  This is currently only used internally
       by Perl's engine, but might be used in the future for all engines for optimisations.

   <b>"nparens",</b> <b>"logical_nparens"</b>
       These fields are used to keep track of the number of physical and logical paren capture groups there  are
       in the pattern, which may differ if the pattern includes the use of the branch reset construct "(?| ... |
       ... )".  For instance the pattern "/(?|(foo)|(bar))/" contains two physical capture buffers, but only one
       logical  capture  buffer.  Most internals logic in the regex engine uses the physical capture buffer ids,
       but the user exposed logic uses logical capture buffer ids. See the next section for data-structures that
       allow mapping from one to the other.

   <b>"logical_to_parno",</b> <b>"parno_to_logical",</b> <b>"parno_to_logical_next"</b>
       These fields facilitate mapping between logical and physical capture buffer  numbers.  "logical_to_parno"
       is  an array whose Kth element contains the lowest physical capture buffer id for the Kth logical capture
       buffer. "parno_to_logical" is an array whose Kth element contains the logical capture  buffer  associated
       with  the Kth physical capture buffer. "parno_to_logical_next" is an array whose Kth element contains the
       next physical capture buffer with the same logical id, or 0 if there is none.

       Note that all three of these arrays are ONLY populated when the pattern includes the use  of  the  branch
       reset  concept.  Patterns which do not use branch-reset effectively have a 1:1 to mapping between logical
       and physical so there is no need for this meta-data.

       The following table gives an example of how this works.

            Pattern /(a) (?| (b) (c) (d) | (e) (f) | (g) ) (h)/
            Logical: $1      $2  $3  $4    $2  $3    $2    $5
            Physical: 1       2   3   4     5   6     7     8
            Next:     0       5   6   0     7   0     0     0

       Also note that the 0th element of any of these arrays is not used as it represents the "entire pattern".

   <b>"lastparen",</b> <b>and</b> <b>"lastcloseparen"</b>
       These fields are used to keep track of: which was the highest paren to be closed (see "$+"  in  perlvar);
       and which was the most recent paren to be closed (see "$^N" in perlvar).

   <b>"intflags"</b>
       The  engine's  private  copy  of  the  flags  the  pattern was compiled with. Usually this is the same as
       "extflags" unless the engine chose to modify one of them.

   <b>"pprivate"</b>
       A void* pointing to an engine-defined  data  structure.   The  Perl  engine  uses  the  "regexp_internal"
       structure (see "Base Structures" in perlreguts) but a custom engine should use something else.

   <b>"offs"</b>
       A  "regexp_paren_pair"  structure which defines offsets into the string being matched which correspond to
       the $&amp; and $1, $2 etc. captures, the "regexp_paren_pair" struct is defined as follows:

           typedef struct regexp_paren_pair {
               I32 start;
               I32 end;
           } regexp_paren_pair;

       If  "-&gt;offs[num].start"  or  "-&gt;offs[num].end"  is  -1  then  that   capture   group   did   not   match.
       "-&gt;offs[0].start/end"  represents  $&amp; (or "${^MATCH}" under "/p") and "-&gt;offs[paren].end" matches $$paren
       where $paren = 1&gt;.

   <b>"RX_PRECOMP"</b> <b>"RX_PRELEN"</b>
       Used for optimisations.  "RX_PRECOMP" holds a copy of the pattern that was compiled and  "RX_PRELEN"  its
       length.   When  a  new  pattern is to be compiled (such as inside a loop) the internal "regcomp" operator
       checks if the last compiled "REGEXP"'s "RX_PRECOMP" and "RX_PRELEN" are equivalent to the new one, and if
       so uses the old pattern instead of compiling a new one.

       In older perls these two macros were actually fields in  the  structure  with  the  names  "precomp"  and
       "prelen" respectively.

   <b>"paren_names"</b>
       This  is  a hash used internally to track named capture groups and their offsets.  The keys are the names
       of the buffers the values are dualvars, with the IV slot holding the number of  buffers  with  the  given
       name  and  the  pv being an embedded array of I32.  The values may also be contained independently in the
       data array in cases where named backreferences are used.

   <b>"substrs"</b>
       Holds information on the longest string that must occur at a fixed offset from the start of the  pattern,
       and  the  longest  string that must occur at a floating offset from the start of the pattern.  Used to do
       Fast-Boyer-Moore searches on the string to find out if its worth using the regex engine at all, and if so
       where in the string to search.

   <b>"subbeg"</b> <b>"sublen"</b> <b>"saved_copy"</b> <b>"suboffset"</b> <b>"subcoffset"</b>
       Used during the execution phase for managing search and replace patterns, and for providing the text  for
       $&amp;,  $1  etc.  "subbeg"  points  to  a  buffer  (either  the  original  string,  or a copy in the case of
       RX_MATCH_COPIED(rx_sv)), and "sublen" is the length of  the  buffer.   The  "RX_OFFS_START(rx_sv,n)"  and
       "RX_OFFS_END(rx_sv,n)"   macros  index  into  this  buffer.  as  does  the  data  structure  returned  by
       RX_OFFSp(rx_sv) but you should not use that directly.

       In the presence of the "REXEC_COPY_STR" flag, but with  the  addition  of  the  "REXEC_COPY_SKIP_PRE"  or
       "REXEC_COPY_SKIP_POST" flags, an engine can choose not to copy the full buffer (although it must still do
       so  in  the presence of "RXf_PMf_KEEPCOPY" or the relevant bits being set in "PL_sawampersand").  In this
       case, it may set "suboffset" to indicate the number of bytes from the logical start of the buffer to  the
       physical start (i.e. "subbeg").  It should also set "subcoffset", the number of characters in the offset.
       The latter is needed to support "@-" and "@+" which work in characters, not bytes.

   <b>"RX_WRAPPED"</b> <b>"RX_WRAPLEN"</b>
       Macros  which  access the string the "qr//" stringifies to. The Perl engine for example stores "(?^:eek)"
       in the case of "qr/eek/".

       When using a custom engine that doesn't support the "(?:)" construct for inline modifiers, it's  probably
       best  to  have "qr//" stringify to the supplied pattern, note that this will create undesired patterns in
       cases such as:

           my $x = qr/a|b/;  # "a|b"
           my $y = qr/c/i;   # "c"
           my $z = qr/$x$y/; # "a|bc"

       There's no solution for this problem other than making the custom  engine  understand  a  construct  like
       "(?:)".

   <b>RX_REFCNT()</b>
       The  number of times the structure is referenced. When this falls to 0, the regexp is automatically freed
       by a call to "pregfree". This should be set to 1 in each engine's "comp"  routine.  Note  that  in  older
       perls this was a member in the struct called "refcnt" but in more modern perls where the regexp structure
       was unified with the SV structure this is an alias to <b>SvREFCNT()</b>.
