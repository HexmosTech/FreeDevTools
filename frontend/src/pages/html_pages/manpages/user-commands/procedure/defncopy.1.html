</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       defncopy — extract procedures and views from a Microsoft server.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>defncopy</b>  [<b>-v</b>]  [<b>-U</b>  <u>username</u>]  [<b>-P</b>  <u>password</u>] [<b>-S</b> <u>server</u>] [<b>-D</b> <u>database</u>] [<b>-i</b> <u>input_file</u>] [<b>-o</b> <u>output_file</u>]
                [<u>owner.object_name</u> [<u>owner.object_name</u> <u>...</u>]]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>defncopy</b> is a utility program distributed with FreeTDS. It replaces a similar program of  the  same  name
       distributed by Sybase.

       <b>defncopy</b>  reads  the  text of a stored procedure or view, and writes a script suitable for recreating the
       procedure or view. For tables, it reads the output of sp_help and constructs a ‘CREATE TABLE’  statement,
       complete  with  ‘CREATE  INDEX’, too.  <u>owner</u> is optional if you or the database owner is the owner of the
       procedure/view being copied.  <u>object_name</u> is the name of the system object you wish to extract.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-U</b> <u>username</u>
               database server login name.

       <b>-P</b> <u>password</u>
               database server password.

       <b>-S</b> <u>server</u>
               database server to which to connect.

       <b>-D</b> <u>database</u>
               database to use. Optional if the procedure/view being extracted is in your default database.

       <b>-i</b> <u>input_file</u>
               a script to apply to the database. Not currently implemented.

       <b>-o</b> <u>output_file</u>
               a file to hold the script, defaults to standard output.

       <b>-v</b>      Show version information and copyright notice.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>defncopy</b> is a filter; it reads from standard input, writes to  standard  output,  and  writes  errors  to
       standard error. The <b>-i</b>, <b>-o</b>, and <b>-e</b> options override these defaults.

       <b>defncopy</b>  makes  use  of  the  db-lib  API  provided  by FreeTDS. This API is of course also available to
       application developers.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>defncopy</b> exits 0 on success, and &gt;0 if the server cannot process the query.

       <b>defncopy</b> will report any errors returned by the server, but will continue processing.

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       <b>defncopy</b> first appeared in FreeTDS 0.63.

</pre><h4><b>AUTHORS</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>defncopy</b> utility was written by James K. Lowden &lt;<a href="mailto:jklowden@schemamania.org">jklowden@schemamania.org</a>.&gt;

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Works only with Microsoft servers and ancient Sybase  servers.   Does  not  create  primary  keys.   Many
       options  are defined by Sybase that this version does not implement. Feel free to correct this situation.
       In theory, <b>defncopy</b> could apply/produce DDL for any system object, but at present only tables, procedures
       and views are supported, and only for extraction.

FreeTDS 1.3.17                                   April 26, 2012                                <u>DEFNCOPY</u>(FreeTDS)
