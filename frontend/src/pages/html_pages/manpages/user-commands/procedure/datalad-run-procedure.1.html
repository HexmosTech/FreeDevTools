       <b>datalad</b> <b>run-procedure</b> - run prepared procedures (DataLad scripts) on a dataset

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>

       <b>datalad</b> <b>run-procedure</b> [-h] [-d PATH] [--discover] [--help-proc] [--version] ...

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Concept</b>
       A  "procedure"  is an algorithm with the purpose to process a dataset in a particular way. Procedures can
       be useful in a wide range of scenarios, like adjusting dataset configuration in a uniform fashion,  popu‐
       lating  a  dataset  with  particular  content,  or  automating other routine tasks, such as synchronizing
       dataset content with certain siblings.

       Implementations of some procedures are shipped together with DataLad, but additional  procedures  can  be
       provided  by 1) any DataLad extension, 2) any (sub-)dataset, 3) a local user, or 4) a local system admin‐
       istrator.  DataLad will look for procedures in the following locations and order:

       Directories identified by the configuration settings

       -  'datalad.locations.user-procedures'   (determined   by   platformdirs.user_config_dir;   defaults   to
       '$HOME/.config/datalad/procedures'  on GNU/Linux systems) - 'datalad.locations.system-procedures' (deter‐
       mined by platformdirs.site_config_dir; defaults to '/etc/xdg/datalad/procedures' on GNU/Linux systems)  -
       'datalad.locations.dataset-procedures'

       and  subsequently  in the 'resources/procedures/' directories of any installed extension, and, lastly, of
       the DataLad installation itself.

       Please note that a dataset that defines any dataset it is a subdataset of. That way you can have  a  col‐
       lection  of  such  procedures  in a dedicated dataset and install it as a subdataset into any dataset you
       want to use those procedures with. In case of a naming  conflict  with  such  a  dataset  hierarchy,  the
       dataset you're calling run-procedures on will take precedence over its subdatasets and so on.

       Each configuration setting can occur multiple times to indicate multiple directories to be searched. If a
       procedure  matching  a given name is found (filename without a possible extension), the search is aborted
       and this implementation will be executed. This makes it possible for individual datasets, users,  or  ma‐
       chines to override externally provided procedures (enabling the implementation of customizable processing
       "hooks").

   <b>Procedure</b> <b>implementation</b>
       A  procedure can be any executable. Executables must have the appropriate permissions and, in the case of
       a script, must contain an appropriate "shebang" line. If a procedure is not executable, but its  filename
       ends with '.py', it is automatically executed by the 'python' interpreter (whichever version is available
       in the present environment). Likewise, procedure implementations ending on '.sh' are executed via 'bash'.

       Procedures can implement any argument handling, but must be capable of taking at least one positional ar‐
       gument (the absolute path to the dataset they shall operate on).

       For further customization there are two configuration settings per procedure available:

       -  'datalad.procedures.&lt;NAME&gt;.call-format'  fully  customizable format string to determine how to execute
       procedure NAME (see also datalad-run).  It currently requires to include the following placeholders:

       - '{script}': will be replaced by the path to the procedure - '{ds}': will be replaced  by  the  absolute
       path to the dataset the
         procedure shall operate on - '{args}': (not actually required) will be replaced by
         all additional arguments passed into run-procedure after NAME

         As an example the default format string for a call to a python script is:
         "python  {script}  {ds} {args}" - 'datalad.procedures.&lt;NAME&gt;.help' will be shown on `datalad run-proce‐
       dure --help-proc NAME` to provide a description and/or usage info for procedure NAME

   <b>Examples</b>
       Find out which procedures are available on the current system::

        % datalad run-procedure --discover

       Run the 'yoda' procedure in the current dataset::

        % datalad run-procedure cfg_yoda

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       NAME [ARGS]
              Name and possibly additional arguments of the to-be-executed procedure. [PY: Can also be a dictio‐
              nary coming from run-procedure(discover=True).]Note, that all options to run-procedure need to  be
              put before NAME, since all ARGS get assigned to NAME.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>, <b>--help-np</b>
              show  this  help message. --help-np forcefully disables the use of a pager for displaying the help
              message

       <b>-d</b> PATH, <b>--dataset</b> PATH
              specify the dataset to run the procedure on. An attempt is made to identify the dataset  based  on
              the  current  working  directory.  Constraints: Value must be a Dataset or a valid identifier of a
              Dataset (e.g. a path) or value must be NONE

       <b>--discover</b>
              if given, all configured paths are searched for procedures and one result  record  per  discovered
              procedure is yielded, but no procedure is executed.

       <b>--help-proc</b>
              if given, get a help message for procedure NAME from config setting datalad.procedures.NAME.help.

       <b>--version</b>
              show the module and its version which provides the command
