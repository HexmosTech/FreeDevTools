</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       wsl - A shell based command line client for WSMAN servers

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>wsl</u>  (aka  "whistle")  contains various scripts that serve as a client interface to WSMAN or Web Services
       for Management protocol based on DMTF standard specification. WSMAN provides  standards  based  messaging
       for systems management CIM-style objects.

       To  talk  to a remote WSMAN service, start with "wsl id check". This command will request the IP address,
       user name and password for the remote server and populate a file  ".wslrun"  in  the  current  directory.
       After  the  first  run,  you can use the commands listed below without having to provide IP address, user
       name and password repeatedly. This is the default behavior. However, you can configure  wsl  so  that  it
       always  ask  for  IP  address or IP address and user credential for each command in case you want to work
       with more than one target.

       The environmental variables that could affect the behavior of wsl are listed in README file.

       Help information is provided at different levels. Typing "wsl" provides help information about  available
       commands.  Typing "wsl enum" provides help information about enum command and its parameters. Typing "wsl
       enum help" gives the same information.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>e</b>|enum|enumerate
              Sends SOAP message with WS-MAN ENUMERATE command. Equivalent to calling "wslenum" directly.

       <b>id</b>|identify
              Sends SOAP message with WS-MAN IDENTIFY command. Equivalent to calling "wslid" directly.

       <b>i</b>|invoke
              Sends SOAP message with WS-MAN INVOKE command. Equivalent to callint "wslinvoke" directly.

       <b>g</b>|get  Sends SOAP message with WS-MAN GET command. Equivalent to calling "wslget" directly.

       <b>p</b>|put  Sends SOAP message with WS-MAN PUT command. Equivalent to calling "wslput" directly.

       <b>s</b>|set  See put.

       <b>xcert</b>  Command to extract SSL certificate of the server hosting WSMAN.

       <b>xclean</b> Command to remove/delete the files generated by this tool.

       <b>xcred</b>  Command to encrypt username and password to a file. The same command can be  used  for  decrypting
              the same file for verification. Equivalent to calling "wslcred" directly.

</pre><h4><b>AUTHENTICATION</b></h4><pre>
       wsl  supports  basic and digest authentication mechanism. You will be prompted for user name and password
       at run time or you can provide their values to environment variables WSUSER and WSPASS.

       A more secure method is to use the light encryption method provided by wsl. See the xcred command option.
       It will create a credential file that contains the encrypted form of the user name and password. To  use,
       simply  provide  the  filename to WSUSER prefixed with "FILE:". You do not have to provide WSPASS in this
       case.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <b><a href="file:~/.wsl-config">~/.wsl-config</a></b>
              This file contains custom user-configurable information that could affect the behavior of wsl.  If
              not  present,  this  file  is  created  the  firt  time wsl is used. Refer to README file for more
              information.

       <b>$PWD/.wslrun</b>
              This file contains environment variables that are populated the first time wsl is run and used  on
              subsequent  runs.  It includes user password so if security is a concern, try to use the encrypted
              version (see xcred command) or you may turn off creation  of  this  file  using  the  custom  user
              configuration (see .wsl-config).
