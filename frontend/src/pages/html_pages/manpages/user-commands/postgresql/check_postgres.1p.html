       check_postgres - a Postgres monitoring script for Nagios, MRTG, Cacti, and others

       This documents describes check_postgres version 2.26.0

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         ## Create all symlinks
         check_postgres --symlinks

         ## Check connection to Postgres database 'pluto':
         check_postgres --action=connection --db=pluto

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       check_postgres is a Perl script that runs many different tests against one or more Postgres databases. It
       uses the psql program to gather the information, and outputs the results in one of three formats: Nagios,
       MRTG, or simple.

   <b>Output</b> <b>Modes</b>
       The output can be changed by use of the "--output" option. The default output is nagios, although this
       can be changed at the top of the script if you wish. The current option choices are <b>nagios</b>, <b>mrtg</b>, and
       <b>simple</b>. To avoid having to enter the output argument each time, the type of output is automatically set
       if no --output argument is given, and if the current directory has one of the output options in its name.
       For example, creating a directory named mrtg and populating it with symlinks via the <u>--symlinks</u> argument
       would ensure that any actions run from that directory will always default to an output of "mrtg" As a
       shortcut for --output=simple, you can enter --simple, which also overrides the directory naming trick.

       <u>Nagios</u> <u>output</u>

       The default output format is for Nagios, which is a single line of information, along with four specific
       exit codes:

       0 (OK)
       1 (WARNING)
       2 (CRITICAL)
       3 (UNKNOWN)

       The  output  line  is one of the words above, a colon, and then a short description of what was measured.
       Additional statistics information, as well as the total time the command took, can be output as well: see
       the documentation on the arguments <u>--showperf</u>, <u>--perflimit</u>, and <u>--showtime</u>.

       <u>MRTG</u> <u>output</u>

       The MRTG output is four lines, with the first line always giving a single  number  of  importance.   When
       possible, this number represents an actual value such as a number of bytes, but it may also be a 1 or a 0
       for  actions  that  only return "true" or "false", such as check_postgres_version.  The second line is an
       additional stat and is only used for some actions. The third line indicates an "uptime" and is not  used.
       The  fourth  line is a description and usually indicates the name of the database the stat from the first
       line was pulled from, but may be different depending on the action.

       Some actions accept an optional <u>--mrtg</u> argument to further control the output.

       See the documentation on each action for details on the exact MRTG output for each one.

       <u>Simple</u> <u>output</u>

       The simple output is simply a truncated version of the MRTG one, and simply returns the first number  and
       nothing  else.  This is very useful when you just want to check the state of something, regardless of any
       threshold. You can transform the numeric output by appending  KB,  MB,  GB,  TB,  or  EB  to  the  output
       argument, for example:

         --output=simple,MB

       <u>Cacti</u> <u>output</u>

       The  Cacti output consists of one or more items on the same line, with a simple name, a colon, and then a
       number. At the moment, the only action with explicit Cacti output is 'dbstats', and  using  the  --output
       option  is  not needed in this case, as Cacti is the only output for this action. For many other actions,
       using --simple is enough to make Cacti happy.

</pre><h4><b>DATABASE</b> <b>CONNECTION</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       All actions accept a common set of database options.

       <b>-H</b> <b>NAME</b> or <b>--host=NAME</b>
           Connect to the host indicated by NAME.  Can  be  a  comma-separated  list  of  names.  Multiple  host
           arguments  are allowed. If no host is given, defaults to the "PGHOST" environment variable or no host
           at all (which indicates using a local Unix socket). You may also use "--dbhost".

       <b>-p</b> <b>PORT</b> or <b>--port=PORT</b>
           Connects using the specified PORT number. Can be a comma-separated list of port numbers, and multiple
           port arguments are allowed. If no  port  number  is  given,  defaults  to  the  "PGPORT"  environment
           variable. If that is not set, it defaults to 5432. You may also use "--dbport"

       <b>-db</b> <b>NAME</b> or <b>--dbname=NAME</b>
           Specifies  which  database to connect to. Can be a comma-separated list of names, and multiple dbname
           arguments are allowed. If no dbname option is provided,  defaults  to  the  "PGDATABASE"  environment
           variable.   If  that  is  not  set,  it  defaults  to 'postgres' if psql is version 8 or greater, and
           'template1' otherwise.

       <b>-u</b> <b>USERNAME</b> or <b>--dbuser=USERNAME</b>
           The name of the database user to connect as. Can be a comma-separated list of usernames, and multiple
           dbuser arguments are allowed. If this is not  provided,  it  defaults  to  the  "PGUSER"  environment
           variable, otherwise it defaults to 'postgres'.

       <b>--dbpass=PASSWORD</b>
           Provides  the  password  to  connect  to the database with. Use of this option is highly discouraged.
           Instead, one should use a .pgpass or pg_service.conf file.

       <b>--dbservice=NAME</b>
           The name of a service inside of the pg_service.conf file. Before version 9.0 of Postgres, this  is  a
           global  file,  usually  found  in  <u>/etc/pg_service.conf</u>.  If  you  are using version 9.0 or higher of
           Postgres, you can use the file ".pg_service.conf" in the home  directory  of  the  user  running  the
           script, e.g. nagios.

           This file contains a simple list of connection options. You can also pass additional information when
           using this option such as --dbservice="maindatabase sslmode=require"

           The        documentation        for        this        file        can        be       found       at
           &lt;https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/libpq-pgservice.html&gt;

       <b>--role=ROLE</b>
           Provides the role to switch to after connecting to the database but before running the  given  check.
           This  provides  the  ability to have superuser privileges assigned to a role without LOGIN access for
           the purposes of audit and other security considerations.  Requires a  local  `psql`  version  9.6  or
           higher.

       The database connection options can be grouped: <u>--host=a,b</u> <u>--host=c</u> <u>--port=1234</u> <u>--port=3344</u> would connect
       to a-1234, b-1234, and c-3344. Note that once set, an option carries over until it is changed again.

       Examples:

         --host=a,b --port=5433 --db=c
         Connects twice to port 5433, using database c, to hosts a and b: a-5433-c b-5433-c

         --host=a,b --port=5433 --db=c,d
         Connects four times: a-5433-c a-5433-d b-5433-c b-5433-d

         --host=a,b --host=foo --port=1234 --port=5433 --db=e,f
         Connects six times: a-1234-e a-1234-f b-1234-e b-1234-f foo-5433-e foo-5433-f

         --host=a,b --host=x --port=5432,5433 --dbuser=alice --dbuser=bob -db=baz
         Connects three times: a-5432-alice-baz b-5433-alice-baz x-5433-bob-baz

         --dbservice="foo" --port=5433
         Connects using the named service 'foo' in the pg_service.conf file, but overrides the port

</pre><h4><b>OTHER</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Other options include:

       <b>--action=NAME</b>
           States  what action we are running. Required unless using a symlinked file, in which case the name of
           the file is used to figure out the action.

       <b>--warning=VAL</b> <b>or</b> <b>-w</b> <b>VAL</b>
           Sets the threshold at which a warning alert is fired. The valid options for this  option  depends  on
           the action used.

       <b>--critical=VAL</b> <b>or</b> <b>-c</b> <b>VAL</b>
           Sets  the  threshold at which a critical alert is fired. The valid options for this option depends on
           the action used.

       <b>-t</b> <b>VAL</b> or <b>--timeout=VAL</b>
           Sets the timeout in seconds after which the script will abort whatever it  is  doing  and  return  an
           UNKNOWN  status. The timeout is per Postgres cluster, not for the entire script. The default value is
           10; the units are always in seconds.

       <b>--assume-standby-mode</b>
           If specified, first the check if server in standby mode will be performed (--datadir is required), if
           so, all checks that require SQL queries will be ignored and "Server in standby mode" with  OK  status
           will be returned instead.

           Example:

               postgres@db$./check_postgres --action=version --warning=8.1 --datadir /var/lib/postgresql/8.3/main/ --assume-standby-mode
               POSTGRES_VERSION OK:  Server in standby mode | time=0.00

       <b>--assume-prod</b>
           If specified, check if server in production mode is performed (--datadir is required).  The option is
           only relevant for ("symlink: check_postgres_checkpoint").

           Example:

               postgres@db$./check_postgres --action=checkpoint --datadir /var/lib/postgresql/8.3/main/ --assume-prod
               POSTGRES_CHECKPOINT OK: Last checkpoint was 72 seconds ago | age=72;;300 mode=MASTER

       <b>--assume-async</b>
           If  specified,  indicates  that  any replication between servers is asynchronous.  The option is only
           relevant for ("symlink: check_postgres_same_schema").

           Example:
               postgres@db$./check_postgres --action=same_schema --assume-async --dbhost=star,line

       <b>-h</b> or <b>--help</b>
           Displays a help screen with a summary of all actions and options.

       <b>--man</b>
           Displays the entire manual.

       <b>-V</b> or <b>--version</b>
           Shows the current version.

       <b>-v</b> or <b>--verbose</b>
           Set the verbosity level. Can call more than once to boost the level. Setting it to  three  or  higher
           (in other words, issuing "-v -v -v") turns on debugging information for this program which is sent to
           stderr.

       <b>--showperf=VAL</b>
           Determines  if  we  output  additional  performance data in standard Nagios format (at end of string,
           after a pipe symbol, using name=value).  VAL should be 0 or 1. The default is 1. Only takes effect if
           using Nagios output mode.

       <b>--perflimit=i</b>
           Sets a limit as to how many items of interest are reported back when using the <u>showperf</u> option.  This
           only  has  an effect for actions that return a large number of items, such as <b>table_size</b>. The default
           is 0, or no limit. Be careful when using this with the  <u>--include</u>  or  <u>--exclude</u>  options,  as  those
           restrictions are done <u>after</u> the query has been run, and thus your limit may not include the items you
           want. Only takes effect if using Nagios output mode.

       <b>--showtime=VAL</b>
           Determines  if  the  time  taken  to run each query is shown in the output. VAL should be 0 or 1. The
           default is 1. No effect unless <u>showperf</u> is on.  Only takes effect if using Nagios output mode.

       <b>--test</b>
           Enables test mode. See the "TEST MODE" section below.

       <b>--PGBINDIR=PATH</b>
           Tells the script where to find the psql binaries. Useful if you have more than  one  version  of  the
           PostgreSQL  executables on your system, or if there are not in your path. Note that this option is in
           all uppercase. By  default,  this  option  is  <u>not</u>  <u>allowed</u>.  To  enable  it,  you  must  change  the
           $NO_PSQL_OPTION  near the top of the script to 0. Avoid using this option if you can, and instead use
           environment variable c&lt;PGBINDIR&gt; or hard-coded $PGBINDIR variable, also near the top of  the  script,
           to set the path to the PostgreSQL to use.

       <b>--PSQL=PATH</b>
           <u>(deprecated,</u>  <u>this</u>  <u>option</u>  <u>may</u>  <u>be</u> <u>removed</u> <u>in</u> <u>a</u> <u>future</u> <u>release!)</u>  Tells the script where to find the
           psql program. Useful if you have more than one version of the psql executable on your system,  or  if
           there  is  no  psql program in your path. Note that this option is in all uppercase. By default, this
           option is <u>not</u> <u>allowed</u>. To enable it, you must change the $NO_PSQL_OPTION near the top of  the  script
           to  0.  Avoid  using  this option if you can, and instead hard-code your psql location into the $PSQL
           variable, also near the top of the script.

       <b>--symlinks</b>
           Creates symlinks to the main program for each action.

       <b>--output=VAL</b>
           Determines the format of the output, for use in various programs. The default is 'nagios'.  Available
           options are 'nagios', 'mrtg', 'simple' and 'cacti'.

       <b>--mrtg=VAL</b>
           Used only for the MRTG or simple output, for a few specific actions.

       <b>--debugoutput=VAL</b>
           Outputs  the  exact  string returned by psql, for use in debugging. The value is one or more letters,
           which determine if the output is displayed or not, where 'a' = all, 'c' = critical,  'w'  =  warning,
           'o' = ok, and 'u' = unknown. Letters can be combined.

       <b>--get_method=VAL</b>
           Allows   specification   of   the   method  used  to  fetch  information  for  the  "new_version_cp",
           "new_version_pg", "new_version_bc", "new_version_box", and "new_version_tnm" checks.   The  following
           programs  are  tried,  in  order, to grab the information from the web: GET, wget, fetch, curl, lynx,
           links. To force the use of just one (and thus remove the overhead of trying all the others until  one
           of  those  works), enter one of the names as the argument to get_method. For example, a BSD box might
           enter the following line in their ".check_postgresrc" file:

             get_method=fetch

       <b>--language=VAL</b>
           Set the language to use for all  output  messages.  Normally,  this  is  detected  by  examining  the
           environment  variables  LC_ALL, LC_MESSAGES, and LANG, but setting this option will override any such
           detection.

</pre><h4><b>ACTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The action to be run is selected using the --action flag, or by using a symlink to  the  main  file  that
       contains  the  name of the action inside of it. For example, to run the action "timesync", you may either
       issue:

         check_postgres --action=timesync

       or use a program named:

         check_postgres_timesync

       All the symlinks are created for you in the current directory if use the option --symlinks:

         perl check_postgres --symlinks

       If the file name already exists, it will not be overwritten. If the file exists and is a symlink, you can
       force it to overwrite by using "--action=build_symlinks_force".

       Most actions take a <u>--warning</u> and a <u>--critical</u> option, indicating at what point  we  change  from  OK  to
       WARNING,  and what point we go to CRITICAL. Note that because criticals are always checked first, setting
       the warning equal to the critical is an effective way to turn warnings off and always give a critical.

       The current supported actions are:

   <b>archive_ready</b>
       ("symlink: check_postgres_archive_ready") Checks how many WAL files with extension <u>.ready</u>  exist  in  the
       <u>pg_xlog/archive_status</u>  directory (PostgreSQL 10 and later: <u>pg_wal/archive_status</u>), which is found off of
       your <b>data_directory</b>. If the <u>--lsfunc</u> option is not used then this action must be run as a  superuser,  in
       order  to  access  the  contents of the <u>pg_xlog/archive_status</u> directory. The minimum version to use this
       action is Postgres 8.1. The <u>--warning</u> and <u>--critical</u> options are simply the number of <u>.ready</u> files in the
       <u>pg_xlog/archive_status</u> directory.  Usually, these values should be low, turning on the archive mechanism,
       we usually want it to archive WAL files as fast as possible.

       If the archive command fail, number of WAL in your <u>pg_xlog</u> directory will grow until exhausting  all  the
       disk space and force PostgreSQL to stop immediately.

       To  avoid  running  as a database superuser, a wrapper function around pg_ls_dir() should be defined as a
       superuser with SECURITY DEFINER, and the <u>--lsfunc</u> option used. This example function,  if  defined  by  a
       superuser, will allow the script to connect as a normal user <u>nagios</u> with <u>--lsfunc=ls_archive_status_dir</u>

         BEGIN;
         CREATE FUNCTION ls_archive_status_dir()
             RETURNS SETOF TEXT
             AS $$ SELECT pg_ls_dir('pg_xlog/archive_status') $$
             LANGUAGE SQL
             SECURITY DEFINER;
         REVOKE ALL ON FUNCTION ls_archive_status_dir() FROM PUBLIC;
         GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION ls_archive_status_dir() to nagios;
         COMMIT;

       Example  1:  Check  that  the  number  of  ready WAL files is 10 or less on host "pluto", using a wrapper
       function "ls_archive_status_dir" to avoid the need for superuser permissions

         check_postgres_archive_ready --host=pluto --critical=10 --lsfunc=ls_archive_status_dir

       For MRTG output, reports the number of ready WAL files on line 1.

   <b>autovac_freeze</b>
       ("symlink:  check_postgres_autovac_freeze")  Checks  how  close  each  database  is   to   the   Postgres
       <b>autovacuum_freeze_max_age</b>  setting.  This  action will only work for databases version 8.2 or higher. The
       <u>--warning</u> and <u>--critical</u> options should be expressed as percentages. The 'age'  of  the  transactions  in
       each database is compared to the autovacuum_freeze_max_age setting (200 million by default) to generate a
       rounded percentage. The default values are <b>90%</b> for the warning and <b>95%</b> for the critical. Databases can be
       filtered  by  use  of  the  <u>--include</u>  and <u>--exclude</u> options.  See the "BASIC FILTERING" section for more
       details.

       Example 1: Give a warning when any databases on port 5432 are above 97%

         check_postgres_autovac_freeze --port=5432 --warning="97%"

       For MRTG output, the highest overall percentage is reported on the first line, and  the  highest  age  is
       reported  on the second line. All databases which have the percentage from the first line are reported on
       the fourth line, separated by a pipe symbol.

   <b>backends</b>
       ("symlink: check_postgres_backends") Checks the current number of connections for one or more  databases,
       and  optionally  compares  it  to  the maximum allowed, which is determined by the Postgres configuration
       variable <b>max_connections</b>. The <u>--warning</u> and <u>--critical</u> options can take one  of  three  forms.  First,  a
       simple  number can be given, which represents the number of connections at which the alert will be given.
       This choice does not use the <b>max_connections</b> setting. Second, the percentage of available connections can
       be given. Third, a negative number can be given which represents the number  of  connections  left  until
       <b>max_connections</b> is reached. The default values for <u>--warning</u> and <u>--critical</u> are '90%' and '95%'.  You can
       also  filter  the  databases  by  use  of the <u>--include</u> and <u>--exclude</u> options.  See the "BASIC FILTERING"
       section for more details.

       To view only non-idle processes, you can use the <u>--noidle</u> argument. Note that the user you are running as
       (either connecting directly or switching via <u>--role</u>) must be a superuser for this to work properly.

       Example 1: Give a warning when the number of connections on host quirm reaches 120, and a critical if  it
       reaches 150.

         check_postgres_backends --host=quirm --warning=120 --critical=150

       Example 2: Give a critical when we reach 75% of our max_connections setting on hosts lancre or lancre2.

         check_postgres_backends --warning='75%' --critical='75%' --host=lancre,lancre2

       Example  3:  Give  a  warning  when  there  are only 10 more connection slots left on host plasmid, and a
       critical when we have only 5 left.

         check_postgres_backends --warning=-10 --critical=-5 --host=plasmid

       Example 4: Check all databases except those with "test" in their name, but  allow  ones  that  are  named
       "pg_greatest". Connect as port 5432 on the first two hosts, and as port 5433 on the third one. We want to
       always throw a critical when we reach 30 or more connections.

        check_postgres_backends --dbhost=hong,kong --dbhost=fooey --dbport=5432 --dbport=5433 --warning=30 --critical=30 --exclude="~test" --include="pg_greatest,~prod"

       For  MRTG  output, the number of connections is reported on the first line, and the fourth line gives the
       name of the database, plus the current maximum_connections. If more than one database has  been  queried,
       the one with the highest number of connections is output.

   <b>bloat</b>
       ("symlink:  check_postgres_bloat")  Checks the amount of bloat in tables and indexes. (Bloat is generally
       the amount of dead unused space taken up in a table or index. This space is usually reclaimed by  use  of
       the  VACUUM  command.) This action requires that stats collection be enabled on the target databases, and
       requires that ANALYZE is run frequently.  The <u>--include</u> and <u>--exclude</u> options can be used to  filter  out
       which tables to look at. See the "BASIC FILTERING" section for more details.

       The  <u>--warning</u> and <u>--critical</u> options can be specified as sizes, percents, or both.  Valid size units are
       bytes,  kilobytes,  megabytes,  gigabytes,  terabytes,  exabytes,  petabytes,  and  zettabytes.  You  can
       abbreviate all of those with the first letter. Items without units are assumed to be 'bytes'. The default
       values  are  '1  GB'  and  '5  GB'.  The value represents the number of "wasted bytes", or the difference
       between what is actually used by the table and index, and what we compute that it should be.

       Note that this action has two hard-coded values to avoid false alarms on smaller relations.  Tables  must
       have  at  least  10  pages,  and  indexes at least 15, before they can be considered by this test. If you
       really want to adjust these values, you can look for the variables <u>$MINPAGES</u> and <u>$MINIPAGES</u> at the top of
       the "check_bloat" subroutine. These values are ignored if either <u>--exclude</u> or <u>--include</u> is used.

       Only the top 10 most bloated relations are shown. You can change this number  by  using  the  <u>--perflimit</u>
       option to set your own limit.

       The  schema  named  'information_schema'  is  excluded from this test, as the only tables it contains are
       small and do not change.

       Please note that the values computed by this action are not precise, and should be used  as  a  guideline
       only.  Great  effort  was  made  to  estimate  the  correct size of a table, but in the end it is only an
       estimate. The correct index size is even more of a guess than the correct table  size,  but  both  should
       give a rough idea of how bloated things are.

       Example 1: Warn if any table on port 5432 is over 100 MB bloated, and critical if over 200 MB

         check_postgres_bloat --port=5432 --warning='100 M' --critical='200 M'

       Example 2: Give a critical if table 'orders' on host 'sami' has more than 10 megs of bloat

         check_postgres_bloat --host=sami --include=orders --critical='10 MB'

       Example 3: Give a critical if table 'q4' on database 'sales' is over 50% bloated

         check_postgres_bloat --db=sales --include=q4 --critical='50%'

       Example 4: Give a critical any table is over 20% bloated <u>and</u> has over 150 MB of bloat:

         check_postgres_bloat --port=5432 --critical='20% and 150 M'

       Example 5: Give a critical any table is over 40% bloated <u>or</u> has over 500 MB of bloat:

         check_postgres_bloat --port=5432 --warning='500 M or 40%'

       For  MRTG  output, the first line gives the highest number of wasted bytes for the tables, and the second
       line gives the highest number of wasted bytes for the indexes. The fourth line gives the  database  name,
       table  name,  and  index  name information. If you want to output the bloat ratio instead (how many times
       larger the relation is compared to how large it should be), just pass in "--mrtg=ratio".

   <b>checkpoint</b>
       ("symlink: check_postgres_checkpoint") Determines how long since the last checkpoint has been  run.  This
       must  run on the same server as the database that is being checked (e.g. the -h flag will not work). This
       check is meant to run on a "warm standby" server that is actively processing shipped WAL  files,  and  is
       meant  to  check  that  your warm standby is truly 'warm'.  The data directory must be set, either by the
       environment variable "PGDATA", or passing the "--datadir" argument. It  returns  the  number  of  seconds
       since  the  last  checkpoint  was  run, as determined by parsing the call to "pg_controldata". Because of
       this, the pg_controldata executable must be available in the current path. Alternatively, you can specify
       "PGBINDIR" as the directory that  it  lives  in.   It  is  also  possible  to  use  the  special  options
       <u>--assume-prod</u> or <u>--assume-standby-mode</u>, if the mode found is not the one expected, a CRITICAL is emitted.

       At least one warning or critical argument must be set.

       This action requires the Date::Parse module.

       For MRTG or simple output, returns the number of seconds.

   <b>cluster_id</b>
       ("symlink:   check_postgres_cluster-id")   Checks   that  the  Database  System  Identifier  provided  by
       pg_controldata is the same as last time you checked. This must run on the same  server  as  the  database
       that  is  being  checked (e.g. the -h flag will not work).  Either the <u>--warning</u> or the <u>--critical</u> option
       should be given, but not both. The value of each one is the cluster identifier, an integer value. You can
       run with the special "--critical=0" option to find out an existing cluster identifier.

       Example 1: Find the initial identifier

         check_postgres_cluster_id --critical=0 --datadir=/var//lib/postgresql/9.0/main

       Example 2: Make sure the cluster is the same and warn if not, using the result from above.

         check_postgres_cluster_id  --critical=5633695740047915135

       For MRTG output, returns a 1 or 0 indicating success of failure of the identifier to match. A  identifier
       must be provided as the "--mrtg" argument. The fourth line always gives the current identifier.

   <b>commitratio</b>
       ("symlink:  check_postgres_commitratio") Checks the commit ratio of all databases and complains when they
       are too low.  There is no need to run this command more than once per database cluster.  Databases can be
       filtered with the <u>--include</u> and <u>--exclude</u> options. See the "BASIC FILTERING" section  for  more  details.
       They  can also be filtered by the owner of the database with the <u>--includeuser</u> and <u>--excludeuser</u> options.
       See the "USER NAME FILTERING" section for more details.

       The warning and critical options should be specified as percentages. There  are  not  defaults  for  this
       action: the warning and critical must be specified. The warning value cannot be greater than the critical
       value. The output returns all databases sorted by commitratio, smallest first.

       Example:  Warn  if  any database on host flagg is less than 90% in commitratio, and critical if less then
       80%.

         check_postgres_database_commitratio --host=flagg --warning='90%' --critical='80%'

       For MRTG output, returns the percentage of the database with the smallest commitratio on the first  line,
       and the name of the database on the fourth line.

   <b>connection</b>
       ("symlink:  check_postgres_connection")  Simply connects, issues a 'SELECT <b>version()</b>', and leaves.  Takes
       no <u>--warning</u> or <u>--critical</u> options.

       For MRTG output, simply outputs a 1 (good connection) or a 0 (bad connection) on the first line.

   <b>custom_query</b>
       ("symlink: check_postgres_custom_query") Runs a custom query of your choosing, and  parses  the  results.
       The query itself is passed in through the "query" argument, and should be kept as simple as possible.  If
       at all possible, wrap it in a view or a function to keep things easier to manage. The query should return
       one or two columns. It is required that one of the columns be named "result" and is the item that will be
       checked  against  your warning and critical values. The second column is for the performance data and any
       name can be used: this will be the 'value' inside the performance data section.

       At least one warning or critical argument must be specified. What these are set to depends on the type of
       query you are running. There are four types of custom_queries that can be run, specified by the "valtype"
       argument. If none is specified, this action defaults to 'integer'. The four types are:

       <b>integer</b>: Does a simple integer comparison. The first column should be a simple integer, and  the  warning
       and critical values should be the same.

       <b>string</b>:  The  warning  and  critical are strings, and are triggered only if the value in the first column
       matches it exactly. This is case-sensitive.

       <b>time</b>: The warning and the critical are times, and can have units of seconds,  minutes,  hours,  or  days.
       Each  may be written singular or abbreviated to just the first letter. If no units are given, seconds are
       assumed. The first column should be an integer representing the number of seconds to check.

       <b>size</b>: The warning and the critical are  sizes,  and  can  have  units  of  bytes,  kilobytes,  megabytes,
       gigabytes,  terabytes,  or  exabytes. Each may be abbreviated to the first letter. If no units are given,
       bytes are assumed. The first column should be an integer representing the number of bytes to check.

       Normally, an alert is triggered if the values returned are <b>greater</b> <b>than</b>  or  equal  to  the  critical  or
       warning value. However, an option of <u>--reverse</u> will trigger the alert if the returned value is <b>lower</b> <b>than</b>
       or equal to the critical or warning value.

       Example  1:  Warn  if  any  relation  over  100  pages is named "rad", put the number of pages inside the
       performance data section.

         check_postgres_custom_query --valtype=string -w "rad" --query=
           "SELECT relname AS result, relpages AS pages FROM pg_class WHERE relpages &gt; 100"

       Example 2: Give a critical if the "foobar" function returns a number over 5MB:

         check_postgres_custom_query --critical='5MB'--valtype=size --query="SELECT foobar() AS result"

       Example 2: Warn if the function "snazzo" returns less than 42:

         check_postgres_custom_query --critical=42 --query="SELECT snazzo() AS result" --reverse

       If you come up with a useful custom_query, consider sending in a patch to this program to make it into  a
       standard action that other people can use.

       This action does not support MRTG or simple output yet.

   <b>database_size</b>
       ("symlink:  check_postgres_database_size")  Checks  the size of all databases and complains when they are
       too big.  There is no need to run this command more than once per database  cluster.   Databases  can  be
       filtered  with  the  <u>--include</u> and <u>--exclude</u> options. See the "BASIC FILTERING" section for more details.
       They can also be filtered by the owner of the database with the <u>--includeuser</u> and <u>--excludeuser</u>  options.
       See the "USER NAME FILTERING" section for more details.

       The  warning  and critical options can be specified as bytes, kilobytes, megabytes, gigabytes, terabytes,
       or exabytes. Each may be abbreviated to the first letter as well.  If no unit is  given,  the  units  are
       assumed  to be bytes. There are not defaults for this action: the warning and critical must be specified.
       The warning value cannot be greater than the critical value. The output returns all databases  sorted  by
       size largest first, showing both raw bytes and a "pretty" version of the size.

       Example 1: Warn if any database on host flagg is over 1 TB in size, and critical if over 1.1 TB.

         check_postgres_database_size --host=flagg --warning='1 TB' --critical='1.1 t'

       Example 2: Give a critical if the database template1 on port 5432 is over 10 MB.

         check_postgres_database_size --port=5432 --include=template1 --warning='10MB' --critical='10MB'

       Example 3: Give a warning if any database on host 'tardis' owned by the user 'tom' is over 5 GB

         check_postgres_database_size --host=tardis --includeuser=tom --warning='5 GB' --critical='10 GB'

       For MRTG output, returns the size in bytes of the largest database on the first line, and the name of the
       database on the fourth line.

   <b>dbstats</b>
       ("symlink: check_postgres_dbstats") Reports information from the pg_stat_database view, and outputs it in
       a  Cacti-friendly  manner. No other output is supported, as the output is informational and does not lend
       itself to alerts, such as used with Nagios. If no options are given, all databases are returned, one  per
       line. You can include a specific database by use of the "--include" option, or you can use the "--dbname"
       option.

       Eleven  items are returned on each line, in the format name:value, separated by a single space. The items
       are:

       backends
           The number of currently running backends for this database.

       commits
           The total number of commits for this database since it was created or reset.

       rollbacks
           The total number of rollbacks for this database since it was created or reset.

       read
           The total number of disk blocks read.

       hit The total number of buffer hits.

       ret The total number of rows returned.

       fetch
           The total number of rows fetched.

       ins The total number of rows inserted.

       upd The total number of rows updated.

       del The total number of rows deleted.

       dbname
           The name of the database.

       Note that ret, fetch, ins, upd, and del items will always be 0 if Postgres is version 8.2  or  lower,  as
       those stats were not available in those versions.

       If the dbname argument is given, seven additional items are returned:

       idxscan
           Total number of user index scans.

       idxtupread
           Total number of user index entries returned.

       idxtupfetch
           Total number of rows fetched by simple user index scans.

       idxblksread
           Total number of disk blocks read for all user indexes.

       idxblkshit
           Total number of buffer hits for all user indexes.

       seqscan
           Total number of sequential scans against all user tables.

       seqtupread
           Total number of tuples returned from all user tables.

       Example 1: Grab the stats for a database named "products" on host "willow":

         check_postgres_dbstats --dbhost willow --dbname products

       The output returned will be like this (all on one line, not wrapped):

           backends:82 commits:58374408 rollbacks:1651 read:268435543 hit:2920381758 idxscan:310931294 idxtupread:2777040927
           idxtupfetch:1840241349 idxblksread:62860110 idxblkshit:1107812216 seqscan:5085305 seqtupread:5370500520
           ret:0 fetch:0 ins:0 upd:0 del:0 dbname:willow

   <b>disabled_triggers</b>
       ("symlink:  check_postgres_disabled_triggers")  Checks  on  the  number  of  disabled triggers inside the
       database.  The <u>--warning</u> and <u>--critical</u> options are the number of such triggers found, and  both  default
       to  "1",  as in normal usage having disabled triggers is a dangerous event. If the database being checked
       is 8.3 or higher, the check is for the number of triggers that are in a 'disabled' status (as opposed  to
       being  'always' or 'replica'). The output will show the name of the table and the name of the trigger for
       each disabled trigger.

       Example 1: Make sure that there are no disabled triggers

         check_postgres_disabled_triggers

       For MRTG output, returns the number of disabled triggers on the first line.

   <b>disk_space</b>
       ("symlink: check_postgres_disk_space") Checks on the available physical disk space used by Postgres. This
       action requires that you have the executable "<a href="file:/bin/df">/bin/df</a>" available to report on disk  sizes,  and  it  also
       needs  to  be  run as a superuser (either connecting directly or switching via <u>--role</u>), so it can examine
       the <b>data_directory</b> setting inside of Postgres. The <u>--warning</u> and <u>--critical</u> options are given  in  either
       sizes  or  percentages  or  both.  If using sizes, the standard unit types are allowed: bytes, kilobytes,
       gigabytes, megabytes, gigabytes, terabytes, or exabytes. Each may be  abbreviated  to  the  first  letter
       only; no units at all indicates 'bytes'. The default values are '90%' and '95%'.

       This  command  checks the following things to determine all of the different physical disks being used by
       Postgres.

       <b>data_directory</b> - The disk that the main data directory is on.

       <b>log</b> <b>directory</b> - The disk that the log files are on.

       <b>WAL</b> <b>file</b> <b>directory</b> - The disk that the write-ahead logs are on (e.g. symlinked pg_xlog or pg_wal)

       <b>tablespaces</b> - Each tablespace that is on a separate disk.

       The output shows the total size used and available on each disk, as well as the  percentage,  ordered  by
       highest  to  lowest  percentage  used.  Each  item  above maps to a file system: these can be included or
       excluded. See the "BASIC FILTERING" section for more details.

       Example 1: Make sure that no file system is over 90% for the database on port 5432.

         check_postgres_disk_space --port=5432 --warning='90%' --critical='90%'

       Example 2: Check that all file systems starting with <u>/dev/sda</u> are smaller than 10 GB and 11  GB  (warning
       and critical)

         check_postgres_disk_space --port=5432 --warning='10 GB' --critical='11 GB' --include="~^/dev/sda"

       Example 4: Make sure that no file system is both over 50% <u>and</u> has over 15 GB

         check_postgres_disk_space --critical='50% and 15 GB'

       Example 5: Issue a warning if any file system is either over 70% full <u>or</u> has more than 1T

         check_postgres_disk_space --warning='1T or 75'

       For MRTG output, returns the size in bytes of the file system on the first line, and the name of the file
       system on the fourth line.

   <b>fsm_pages</b>
       ("symlink:  check_postgres_fsm_pages")  Checks  how  close  a  cluster  is  to the Postgres <b>max_fsm_pages</b>
       setting.  This action will only work for databases of 8.2 or higher, and it requires the  contrib  module
       <b>pg_freespacemap</b>  be  installed.  The <u>--warning</u> and <u>--critical</u> options should be expressed as percentages.
       The number of used pages in the free-space-map is determined by looking in the  pg_freespacemap_relations
       view,  and  running  a  formula  based on the formula used for outputting free-space-map pageslots in the
       vacuum verbose command. The default values are <b>85%</b> for the warning and <b>95%</b> for the critical.

       Example 1: Give a  warning  when  our  cluster  has  used  up  76%  of  the  free-space  pageslots,  with
       pg_freespacemap installed in database robert

         check_postgres_fsm_pages --dbname=robert --warning="76%"

       While  you  need to pass in the name of the database where pg_freespacemap is installed, you only need to
       run this check once per cluster. Also, checking this information does require obtaining special locks  on
       the free-space-map, so it is recommend you do not run this check with short intervals.

       For  MRTG  output,  returns  the  percent  of  free-space-map  on the first line, and the number of pages
       currently used on the second line.

   <b>fsm_relations</b>
       ("symlink: check_postgres_fsm_relations") Checks how close a cluster is to the Postgres <b>max_fsm_relations</b>
       setting.  This action will only work for databases of 8.2 or higher, and it requires the  contrib  module
       <b>pg_freespacemap</b>  be  installed.  The <u>--warning</u> and <u>--critical</u> options should be expressed as percentages.
       The  number  of  used   relations   in   the   free-space-map   is   determined   by   looking   in   the
       pg_freespacemap_relations view. The default values are <b>85%</b> for the warning and <b>95%</b> for the critical.

       Example  1:  Give  a  warning  when  our  cluster  has  used  up  80%  of  the free-space relations, with
       pg_freespacemap installed in database dylan

         check_postgres_fsm_relations --dbname=dylan --warning="75%"

       While you need to pass in the name of the database where pg_freespacemap is installed, you only  need  to
       run  this check once per cluster. Also, checking this information does require obtaining special locks on
       the free-space-map, so it is recommend you do not run this check with short intervals.

       For MRTG output, returns the percent of free-space-map  on  the  first  line,  the  number  of  relations
       currently used on the second line.

   <b>hitratio</b>
       ("symlink:  check_postgres_hitratio")  Checks  the hit ratio of all databases and complains when they are
       too low.  There is no need to run this command more than once per database  cluster.   Databases  can  be
       filtered  with  the  <u>--include</u> and <u>--exclude</u> options. See the "BASIC FILTERING" section for more details.
       They can also be filtered by the owner of the database with the <u>--includeuser</u> and <u>--excludeuser</u>  options.
       See the "USER NAME FILTERING" section for more details.

       The  warning  and  critical  options  should be specified as percentages. There are not defaults for this
       action: the warning and critical must be specified. The warning value cannot be greater than the critical
       value. The output returns all databases sorted by hitratio, smallest first.

       Example: Warn if any database on host flagg is less than 90% in hitratio, and critical if less then 80%.

         check_postgres_hitratio --host=flagg --warning='90%' --critical='80%'

       For MRTG output, returns the percentage of the database with the smallest hitratio on the first line, and
       the name of the database on the fourth line.

   <b>hot_standby_delay</b>
       ("symlink: check_hot_standby_delay") Checks the streaming replication lag by computing the delta  between
       the  current  xlog  position  of  a master server and the replay location of a slave connected to it. The
       slave server must be in hot_standby (e.g. read only) mode, therefore the  minimum  version  to  use  this
       action  is  Postgres  9.0. The <u>--warning</u> and <u>--critical</u> options are the delta between the xlog locations.
       Since these values are byte offsets in the WAL they should match the expected transaction volume of  your
       application to prevent false positives or negatives.

       The  first "--dbname", "--host", and "--port", etc. options are considered the master; the second belongs
       to the slave.

       Byte values should be based on the volume of  transactions  needed  to  have  the  streaming  replication
       disconnect  from  the  master  because of too much lag, determined by the Postgres configuration variable
       <b>wal_keep_segments</b>.  For units of time, valid units are 'seconds', 'minutes', 'hours',  or  'days'.   Each
       may be written singular or abbreviated to just the first letter. When specifying both, in the form '<u>bytes</u>
       and <u>time</u>', both conditions must be true for the threshold to be met.

       You  must  provide  information  on how to reach the databases by providing a comma separated list to the
       --dbhost and --dbport parameters, such as "--dbport=5432,5543". If not given, the action fails.

       Example 1: Warn a database with a local replica on port 5433 is behind on any xlog replay at all

         check_hot_standby_delay --dbport=5432,5433 --warning='1'

       Example 2: Give a critical if the last transaction replica1 receives is more than 10 minutes ago

         check_hot_standby_delay --dbhost=master,replica1 --critical='10 min'

       Example 3: Allow replica1 to be 1 WAL segment behind, if the master is momentarily seeing  more  activity
       than  the streaming replication connection can handle, or 10 minutes behind, if the master is seeing very
       little activity and not processing any transactions, but not both, which would indicate a lasting problem
       with the replication connection.

         check_hot_standby_delay --dbhost=master,replica1 --warning='1048576 and 2 min' --critical='16777216 and 10 min'

       (symlinks:  "check_postgres_relation_size",   "check_postgres_index_size",   "check_postgres_table_size",
       "check_postgres_indexes_size", and "check_postgres_total_relation_size")

       The  actions  <b>relation_size</b>  and  <b>index_size</b>  check  for  a  relation  (table, index, materialized view),
       respectively an index that has grown too big, using the <b>pg_relation_size()</b> function.

       The action <b>table_size</b> checks tables and materialized views using <b>pg_table_size()</b>, i.e. including relation
       forks and TOAST table.

       The action <b>indexes_size</b> checks tables and materialized views for the size of the attached  indexes  using
       <b>pg_indexes_size()</b>.

       The  action  <b>total_relation_size</b> checks relations using <b>pg_total_relation_size()</b>, i.e. including relation
       forks, indexes and TOAST table.

       Relations can be filtered with the <u>--include</u> and <u>--exclude</u> options. See the "BASIC FILTERING" section for
       more details. Relations can also be filtered by the user that owns them, by using the  <u>--includeuser</u>  and
       <u>--excludeuser</u> options.  See the "USER NAME FILTERING" section for more details.

       The  values  for  the  <u>--warning</u>  and  <u>--critical</u>  options  are  file sizes, and may have units of bytes,
       kilobytes, megabytes, gigabytes, terabytes, or exabytes.  Each can be abbreviated to the first letter. If
       no units are given, bytes are assumed. There are no default values: both the  warning  and  the  critical
       option must be given. The return text shows the size of the largest relation found.

       If  the  <u>--showperf</u>  option  is  enabled, <u>all</u> of the relations with their sizes will be given. To prevent
       this, it is recommended that you set the <u>--perflimit</u> option, which will cause the query to do a "ORDER BY
       size DESC LIMIT (perflimit)".

       Example 1: Give a critical if any table is larger than 600MB on host burrick.

         check_postgres_table_size --critical='600 MB' --warning='600 MB' --host=burrick

       Example 2: Warn if the table products is over 4 GB in size, and give a critical at 4.5 GB.

         check_postgres_table_size --host=burrick --warning='4 GB' --critical='4.5 GB' --include=products

       Example 3: Warn if any index not owned by postgres goes over 500 MB.

         check_postgres_index_size --port=5432 --excludeuser=postgres -w 500MB -c 600MB

       For MRTG output, returns the size in bytes of the largest relation, and the  name  of  the  database  and
       relation as the fourth line.

   <b>last_analyze</b>
   <b>last_vacuum</b>
   <b>last_autoanalyze</b>
   <b>last_autovacuum</b>
       (symlinks:                  "check_postgres_last_analyze",                  "check_postgres_last_vacuum",
       "check_postgres_last_autoanalyze", and "check_postgres_last_autovacuum") Checks  how  long  it  has  been
       since  vacuum  (or  analyze)  was  last  run on each table in one or more databases. Use of these actions
       requires that the target database is version 8.3  or  greater,  or  that  the  version  is  8.2  and  the
       configuration  variable  <b>stats_row_level</b>  has been enabled. Tables can be filtered with the <u>--include</u> and
       <u>--exclude</u> options. See the "BASIC FILTERING" section for more details.  Tables can also  be  filtered  by
       their owner by use of the <u>--includeuser</u> and <u>--excludeuser</u> options.  See the "USER NAME FILTERING" section
       for more details.

       The  units for <u>--warning</u> and <u>--critical</u> are specified as times.  Valid units are seconds, minutes, hours,
       and days; all can be abbreviated to the first letter. If no units are given, 'seconds' are  assumed.  The
       default  values  are  '1 day' and '2 days'. Please note that there are cases in which this field does not
       get automatically populated. If certain tables are giving you problems, make sure  that  they  have  dead
       rows to vacuum, or just exclude them from the test.

       The  schema  named  'information_schema'  is  excluded from this test, as the only tables it contains are
       small and do not change.

       Note that the non-'auto' versions will also check on the auto versions as well.  In  other  words,  using
       last_vacuum  will report on the last vacuum, whether it was a normal vacuum, or one run by the autovacuum
       daemon.

       Example 1: Warn if any table has not been vacuumed in 3 days, and give a critical at  a  week,  for  host
       wormwood

         check_postgres_last_vacuum --host=wormwood --warning='3d' --critical='7d'

       Example 2: Same as above, but skip tables belonging to the users 'eve' or 'mallory'

         check_postgres_last_vacuum --host=wormwood --warning='3d' --critical='7d' --excludeuser=eve,mallory

       For  MRTG  output, returns (on the first line) the LEAST amount of time in seconds since a table was last
       vacuumed or analyzed. The fourth line returns the name of the database and name of the table.

   <b>listener</b>
       ("symlink: check_postgres_listener") Confirm that someone is listening for one or more  specific  strings
       (using  the  LISTEN/NOTIFY system), by looking at the pg_listener table.  Only one of warning or critical
       is needed. The format is a simple string representing the LISTEN target, or a tilde character followed by
       a string for a regular expression check.  Note that this check will not work on versions of Postgres  9.0
       or higher.

       Example 1: Give a warning if nobody is listening for the string bucardo_mcp_ping on ports 5555 and 5556

         check_postgres_listener --port=5555,5556 --warning=bucardo_mcp_ping

       Example 2: Give a critical if there are no active LISTEN requests matching 'grimm' on database oskar

         check_postgres_listener --db oskar --critical=~grimm

       For  MRTG  output, returns a 1 or a 0 on the first, indicating success or failure. The name of the notice
       must be provided via the <u>--mrtg</u> option.

   <b>locks</b>
       ("symlink: check_postgres_locks") Check the total number of locks on one or more databases. There  is  no
       need  to  run  this more than once per database cluster. Databases can be filtered with the <u>--include</u> and
       <u>--exclude</u> options. See the "BASIC FILTERING" section for more details.

       The <u>--warning</u> and <u>--critical</u> options can be specified as simple numbers, which represent the total number
       of locks, or they can be broken down by type of lock.  Valid lock names are 'total',  'waiting',  or  the
       name  of  a lock type used by Postgres.  These names are case-insensitive and do not need the "lock" part
       on the end, so <b>exclusive</b> will match 'ExclusiveLock'. The format  is  name=number,  with  different  items
       separated by colons or semicolons (or any other symbol).

       Example 1: Warn if the number of locks is 100 or more, and critical if 200 or more, on host garrett

         check_postgres_locks --host=garrett --warning=100 --critical=200

       Example  2:  On  the host artemus, warn if 200 or more locks exist, and give a critical if over 250 total
       locks exist, or if over 20 exclusive locks exist, or if over 5 connections are waiting for a lock.

         check_postgres_locks --host=artemus --warning=200 --critical="total=250:waiting=5:exclusive=20"

       For MRTG output, returns the number of locks on the first line, and the  name  of  the  database  on  the
       fourth line.

   <b>logfile</b>
       ("symlink:  check_postgres_logfile")  Ensures  that  the logfile is in the expected location and is being
       logged to.  This action issues a command that throws an error  on  each  database  it  is  checking,  and
       ensures  that the message shows up in the logs. It scans the various log_* settings inside of Postgres to
       figure out where the logs should be.  If you are using syslog, it does a rough (but not  foolproof)  scan
       of  <u>/etc/syslog.conf</u>.  Alternatively,  you can provide the name of the logfile with the <u>--logfile</u> option.
       This is especially useful if the logs have a custom rotation scheme driven be an  external  program.  The
       <b>--logfile</b>  option  supports  the  following escape characters: "%Y %m %d %H", which represent the current
       year, month, date, and hour respectively. An error is always reported  as  critical  unless  the  warning
       option  has  been  passed  in  as  a  non-zero value. Other than that specific usage, the "--warning" and
       "--critical" options should <u>not</u> be used.

       Example 1: On port 5432, ensure the logfile is being written to the file /home/greg/pg8.2.log

         check_postgres_logfile --port=5432 --logfile=/home/greg/pg8.2.log

       Example 2: Same as above, but raise a warning, not a critical

         check_postgres_logfile --port=5432 --logfile=/home/greg/pg8.2.log -w 1

       For MRTG output, returns a 1 or 0 on the first line, indicating success or failure. In case of a failure,
       the fourth line will provide more detail on the failure encountered.

   <b>new_version_bc</b>
       ("symlink: check_postgres_new_version_bc") Checks if a newer version of the Bucardo program is available.
       The current version is obtained by running "bucardo_ctl --version".  If a major upgrade is  available,  a
       warning  is returned. If a revision upgrade is available, a critical is returned. (Bucardo is a master to
       slave, and master to  master  replication  system  for  Postgres:  see  &lt;https://bucardo.org/&gt;  for  more
       information).  See also the information on the "--get_method" option.

   <b>new_version_box</b>
       ("symlink:  check_postgres_new_version_box")  Checks  if  a  newer  version  of  the  boxinfo  program is
       available. The current version is obtained by running "boxinfo.pl --version".   If  a  major  upgrade  is
       available, a warning is returned. If a revision upgrade is available, a critical is returned. (boxinfo is
       a  program  for  grabbing  important  information  from  a  server and putting it into a HTML format: see
       &lt;https://bucardo.org/Boxinfo/&gt; for more information). See also  the  information  on  the  "--get_method"
       option.

   <b>new_version_cp</b>
       ("symlink:  check_postgres_new_version_cp") Checks if a newer version of this program (check_postgres) is
       available, by grabbing the version from a small text file on the main page  of  the  home  page  for  the
       project.  Returns  a  warning if the returned version does not match the one you are running. Recommended
       interval to check is once a day. See also the information on the "--get_method" option.

   <b>new_version_pg</b>
       ("symlink: check_postgres_new_version_pg") Checks if  a  newer  revision  of  Postgres  exists  for  each
       database  connected  to.  Note  that  this  only  checks  for  revision, e.g.  going from 8.3.6 to 8.3.7.
       Revisions are always 100% binary compatible and involve no dump and restore  to  upgrade.  Revisions  are
       made to address bugs, so upgrading as soon as possible is always recommended. Returns a warning if you do
       not  have  the  latest  revision.   It is recommended this check is run at least once a day. See also the
       information on the "--get_method" option.

   <b>new_version_tnm</b>
       ("symlink: check_postgres_new_version_tnm") Checks if a newer  version  of  the  tail_n_mail  program  is
       available.  The  current  version  is  obtained by running "tail_n_mail --version". If a major upgrade is
       available, a warning  is  returned.  If  a  revision  upgrade  is  available,  a  critical  is  returned.
       (tail_n_mail  is a log monitoring tool that can send mail when interesting events appear in your Postgres
       logs.  See: &lt;https://bucardo.org/tail_n_mail/&gt; for more information).  See also the  information  on  the
       "--get_method" option.

   <b>partman_premake</b>
       ("symlink: check_postgres_partman_premake") Checks if all partitions that <b>pg_parman</b>'s maintenance routine
       should have created are actually present.  Monthly and daily intervals are supported.

   <b>pgb_pool_cl_active</b>
   <b>pgb_pool_cl_waiting</b>
   <b>pgb_pool_sv_active</b>
   <b>pgb_pool_sv_idle</b>
   <b>pgb_pool_sv_used</b>
   <b>pgb_pool_sv_tested</b>
   <b>pgb_pool_sv_login</b>
   <b>pgb_pool_maxwait</b>
       (symlinks:           "check_postgres_pgb_pool_cl_active",           "check_postgres_pgb_pool_cl_waiting",
       "check_postgres_pgb_pool_sv_active",                                   "check_postgres_pgb_pool_sv_idle",

       "check_postgres_pgb_pool_sv_login", and "check_postgres_pgb_pool_maxwait")

       Examines pgbouncer's pool statistics.  Each  pool  has  a  set  of  "client"  connections,  referring  to
       connections  from  external  clients,  and  "server"  connections, referring to connections to PostgreSQL
       itself. The related check_postgres actions are prefixed by "cl_" and "sv_", respectively.  Active  client
       connections  are  those connections currently linked with an active server connection. Client connections
       may also be "waiting", meaning they have not yet been allocated a server connection.  Server  connections
       are  "active"  (linked  to  a  client), "idle" (standing by for a client connection to link with), "used"
       (just unlinked from a client, and not yet returned to the idle pool), "tested" (currently  being  tested)
       and  "login"  (in  the  process  of  logging  in). The maxwait value shows how long in seconds the oldest
       waiting client connection has been waiting.

   <b>pgbouncer_backends</b>
       ("symlink: check_postgres_pgbouncer_backends") Checks the current number of connections for one  or  more
       databases  through  pgbouncer,  and optionally compares it to the maximum allowed, which is determined by
       the pgbouncer configuration variable <b>max_client_conn</b>. The <u>--warning</u> and <u>--critical</u> options can  take  one
       of  three forms. First, a simple number can be given, which represents the number of connections at which
       the alert will be given.  This choice does not use the <b>max_connections</b> setting. Second, the percentage of
       available connections can be given. Third, a negative number can be given which represents the number  of
       connections  left  until  <b>max_connections</b> is reached. The default values for <u>--warning</u> and <u>--critical</u> are
       '90%' and '95%'.  You can also filter the databases by use of the <u>--include</u> and <u>--exclude</u>  options.   See
       the "BASIC FILTERING" section for more details.

       To view only non-idle processes, you can use the <u>--noidle</u> argument. Note that the user you are running as
       (either connecting directly or switching via <u>--role</u>) must be a superuser for this to work properly.

       Example  1: Give a warning when the number of connections on host quirm reaches 120, and a critical if it
       reaches 150.

         check_postgres_pgbouncer_backends --host=quirm --warning=120 --critical=150 -p 6432 -u pgbouncer

       Example 2: Give a critical when we reach 75% of our max_connections setting on hosts lancre or lancre2.

         check_postgres_pgbouncer_backends --warning='75%' --critical='75%' --host=lancre,lancre2 -p 6432 -u pgbouncer

       Example 3: Give a warning when there are only 10 more connection  slots  left  on  host  plasmid,  and  a
       critical when we have only 5 left.

         check_postgres_pgbouncer_backends --warning=-10 --critical=-5 --host=plasmid -p 6432 -u pgbouncer

       For  MRTG  output, the number of connections is reported on the first line, and the fourth line gives the
       name of the database, plus the current max_client_conn. If more than one database has been  queried,  the
       one with the highest number of connections is output.

   <b>pgbouncer_checksum</b>
       ("symlink:  check_postgres_pgbouncer_checksum")  Checks  that  all the pgBouncer settings are the same as
       last time you checked.  This is done by generating a checksum of a sorted list of setting names and their
       values. Note that you shouldn't specify the database name, it will automatically  default  to  pgbouncer.
       Either the <u>--warning</u> or the <u>--critical</u> option should be given, but not both. The value of each one is the
       checksum,  a  32-character  hexadecimal value. You can run with the special "--critical=0" option to find
       out an existing checksum.

       This action requires the Digest::MD5 module.

       Example 1: Find the initial checksum for pgbouncer configuration on port  6432  using  the  default  user
       (usually postgres)

         check_postgres_pgbouncer_checksum --port=6432 --critical=0

       Example 2: Make sure no settings have changed and warn if so, using the checksum from above.

         check_postgres_pgbouncer_checksum --port=6432 --warning=cd2f3b5e129dc2b4f5c0f6d8d2e64231

       For MRTG output, returns a 1 or 0 indicating success of failure of the checksum to match. A checksum must
       be provided as the "--mrtg" argument. The fourth line always gives the current checksum.

   <b>pgbouncer_maxwait</b>
       ("symlink:  check_postgres_pgbouncer_maxwait") Checks how long the first (oldest) client in the queue has
       been waiting, in seconds. If this starts increasing, then the current pool of  servers  does  not  handle
       requests quick enough. Reason may be either overloaded server or just too small of a pool_size setting in
       pbouncer  config  file.  Databases can be filtered by use of the <u>--include</u> and <u>--exclude</u> options. See the
       "BASIC FILTERING" section for more details.  The values or the <u>--warning</u> and <u>--critical</u> options are units
       of time, and must be provided (no default). Valid units are 'seconds',  'minutes',  'hours',  or  'days'.
       Each  may  be written singular or abbreviated to just the first letter.  If no units are given, the units
       are assumed to be seconds.

       This action requires Postgres 8.3 or better.

       Example 1: Give a critical if any transaction has been open for more than 10 minutes:

         check_postgres_pgbouncer_maxwait -p 6432 -u pgbouncer --critical='10 minutes'

       For MRTG output, returns the maximum time in seconds a transaction has been open on the first  line.  The
       fourth line gives the name of the database.

   <b>pgagent_jobs</b>
       ("symlink:  check_postgres_pgagent_jobs")  Checks  that  all  the  pgAgent jobs that have executed in the
       preceding interval of time have succeeded. This is done by checking for any steps that  have  a  non-zero
       result.

       Either  "--warning"  or  "--critical",  or  both, may be specified as times, and jobs will be checked for
       failures withing the specified periods of time before the current time. Valid units are seconds, minutes,
       hours, and days; all can be abbreviated to the first  letter.  If  no  units  are  given,  'seconds'  are
       assumed.

       Example 1: Give a critical when any jobs executed in the last day have failed.

         check_postgres_pgagent_jobs --critical=1d

       Example 2: Give a warning when any jobs executed in the last week have failed.

         check_postgres_pgagent_jobs --warning=7d

       Example 3: Give a critical for jobs that have failed in the last 2 hours and a warning for jobs that have
       failed in the last 4 hours:

         check_postgres_pgagent_jobs --critical=2h --warning=4h

   <b>prepared_txns</b>
       ("symlink:  check_postgres_prepared_txns")  Check on the age of any existing prepared transactions.  Note
       that most people will NOT use prepared transactions, as they are part of two-part commit and  complicated
       to  maintain.  They should also not be confused with prepared STATEMENTS, which is what most people think
       of when they hear prepare. The default value for a warning is 1 second, to detect  any  use  of  prepared
       transactions, which is probably a mistake on most systems. Warning and critical are the number of seconds
       a prepared transaction has been open before an alert is given.

       Example 1: Give a warning on detecting any prepared transactions:

         check_postgres_prepared_txns -w 0

       Example 2: Give a critical if any prepared transaction has been open longer than 10 seconds, but allow up
       to 360 seconds for the database 'shrike':

         check_postgres_prepared_txns --critical=10 --exclude=shrike
         check_postgres_prepared_txns --critical=360 --include=shrike

       For  MRTG  output,  returns the number of seconds the oldest transaction has been open as the first line,
       and which database is came from as the final line.

   <b>query_runtime</b>
       ("symlink: check_postgres_query_runtime") Checks how long a specific query takes to run, by  executing  a
       "EXPLAIN  ANALYZE"  against  it.  The <u>--warning</u> and <u>--critical</u> options are the maximum amount of time the
       query should take. Valid units are seconds, minutes, and hours; any  can  be  abbreviated  to  the  first
       letter.  If  no units are given, 'seconds' are assumed.  Both the warning and the critical option must be
       given. The name of the view or function to be run must be passed in to the <u>--queryname</u>  option.  It  must
       consist of a single word (or schema.word), with optional parens at the end.

       Example 1: Give a critical if the function named "speedtest" fails to run in 10 seconds or less.

         check_postgres_query_runtime --queryname='speedtest()' --critical=10 --warning=10

       For MRTG output, reports the time in seconds for the query to complete on the first line. The fourth line
       lists the database.

   <b>query_time</b>
       ("symlink:  check_postgres_query_time")  Checks  the  length of running queries on one or more databases.
       There is no need to run this more than once on the same database cluster. Note that this already excludes
       queries that are "idle in transaction". Databases can be filtered by using the  <u>--include</u>  and  <u>--exclude</u>
       options.  See the "BASIC FILTERING" section for more details. You can also filter on the user running the
       query with the <u>--includeuser</u> and <u>--excludeuser</u> options.  See the "USER NAME FILTERING" section  for  more
       details.

       The  values  for  the  <u>--warning</u>  and  <u>--critical</u>  options  are amounts of time, and at least one must be
       provided (no defaults). Valid units are 'seconds', 'minutes', 'hours', or 'days'.  Each  may  be  written
       singular  or  abbreviated  to  just  the  first  letter. If no units are given, the unit is assumed to be
       seconds.

       This action requires Postgres 8.1 or better.

       Example 1: Give a warning if any query has been running longer than 3 minutes, and a critical  if  longer
       than 5 minutes.

         check_postgres_query_time --port=5432 --warning='3 minutes' --critical='5 minutes'

       Example  2:  Using  default  values  (2  and  5  minutes), check all databases except those starting with
       'template'.

         check_postgres_query_time --port=5432 --exclude=~^template

       Example 3: Warn if user 'don' has a query running over 20 seconds

         check_postgres_query_time --port=5432 --includeuser=don --warning=20s

       For MRTG output, returns the length in seconds of the longest running query on the first line. The fourth
       line gives the name of the database.

   <b>replicate_row</b>
       ("symlink: check_postgres_replicate_row") Checks that master-slave replication is working to one or  more
       slaves.

       The first "--dbname", "--host", and "--port", etc. options are considered the master; subsequent uses are
       the  slaves.  The values or the <u>--warning</u> and <u>--critical</u> options are units of time, and at least one must
       be provided (no defaults). Valid units are 'seconds', 'minutes', 'hours', or 'days'. Each may be  written
       singular  or  abbreviated  to  just the first letter.  If no units are given, the units are assumed to be
       seconds.

       This check updates a single row on the master, and then measures how long it takes to be applied  to  the
       slaves.  To  do  this,  you  need  to  pick a table that is being replicated, then find a row that can be
       changed, and is not going to be changed by any other process. A specific  column  of  this  row  will  be
       changed  from  one  value  to another. All of this is fed to the "repinfo" option, and should contain the
       following options, separated by commas: table name, primary key, key  id,  column,  first  value,  second
       value.

       Example  1: Slony is replicating a table named 'orders' from host 'alpha' to host 'beta', in the database
       'sales'. The primary key of the table is named id, and we are going to test the  row  with  an  id  of  3
       (which  is  historical and never changed). There is a column named 'salesrep' that we are going to toggle
       from a value of 'slon' to 'nols' to check on  the  replication.  We  want  to  throw  a  warning  if  the
       replication does not happen within 10 seconds.

         check_postgres_replicate_row --host=alpha --dbname=sales --host=beta
         --dbname=sales --warning=10 --repinfo=orders,id,3,salesrep,slon,nols

       Example  2:  Bucardo is replicating a table named 'receipt' from host 'green' to hosts 'red', 'blue', and
       'yellow'. The database for both sides is 'public'.  The slave databases are running  on  port  5455.  The
       primary  key  is  named  'receipt_id', the row we want to use has a value of 9, and the column we want to
       change for the test is called 'zone'. We'll toggle between 'north' and 'south'  for  the  value  of  this
       column, and throw a critical if the change is not on all three slaves within 5 seconds.

        check_postgres_replicate_row --host=green --port=5455 --host=red,blue,yellow
         --critical=5 --repinfo=receipt,receipt_id,9,zone,north,south

       For  MRTG  output,  returns  on  the first line the time in seconds the replication takes to finish.  The
       maximum time is set to 4 minutes 30 seconds: if no replication has taken place in that long  a  time,  an
       error is thrown.

   <b>replication_slots</b>
       ("symlink:  check_postgres_replication_slots")   Check  the  quantity of WAL retained for any replication
       slots in the target database cluster.  This is handy for monitoring environments where all WAL  archiving
       and replication is taking place over replication slots.

       Warning and critical are total bytes retained for the slot. E.g:

         check_postgres_replication_slots --port=5432 --host=yellow -warning=32M -critical=64M

       Specific named slots can be monitored using --include/--exclude

   <b>same_schema</b>
       ("symlink: check_postgres_same_schema") Verifies that two or more databases are identical as far as their
       schema  (but  not the data within). Unlike most other actions, this has no warning or critical criteria -
       the databases are either in sync, or are not. If they are different, a detailed list of  the  differences
       is presented.

       You  may  want  to exclude or filter out certain differences. The way to do this is to add strings to the
       "--filter" option. To exclude a type of object, use "noname", where 'name' is the  type  of  object,  for
       example, "noschema". To exclude objects of a certain type by a regular expression against their name, use
       "noname=regex". See the examples below for a better understanding.

       The types of objects that can be filtered include:

       user
       schema
       table
       view
       index
       sequence
       constraint
       trigger
       function

       The filter option "noposition"  prevents verification of the position of columns within a table.

       The filter option "nofuncbody" prevents comparison of the bodies of all functions.

       The filter option "noperm" prevents comparison of object permissions.

       To provide the second database, just append the differences to the first one by a call to the appropriate
       connection   argument.   For   example,   to   compare   databases   on   hosts   alpha  and  bravo,  use
       "--dbhost=alpha,bravo". Also see the examples below.

       If only a single host is given, it is assumed we are doing a "time-based" report.  The first time this is
       run a snapshot of all the items in the database is saved to a local file. When you  run  it  again,  that
       snapshot is read in and becomes "database #2" and is compared to the current database.

       To replace the old stored file with the new version, use the --replace argument.

       If you need to write the stored file to a specific directory, use the --audit-file-dir argument.

       To  avoid  false  positives on value based checks caused by replication lag on asynchronous replicas, use
       the <u>--assume-async</u> option.

       To enable snapshots at various points in time, you can use the "--suffix" argument to make the  filenames
       unique to each run. See the examples below.

       Example 1: Verify that two databases on hosts star and line are the same:

         check_postgres_same_schema --dbhost=star,line

       Example 2: Same as before, but exclude any triggers with "slony" in their name

         check_postgres_same_schema --dbhost=star,line --filter="notrigger=slony"

       Example 3: Same as before, but also exclude all indexes

         check_postgres_same_schema --dbhost=star,line --filter="notrigger=slony noindexes"

       Example 4: Check differences for the database "battlestar" on different ports

         check_postgres_same_schema --dbname=battlestar --dbport=5432,5544

       Example 5: Create a daily and weekly snapshot file

         check_postgres_same_schema --dbname=cylon --suffix=daily
         check_postgres_same_schema --dbname=cylon --suffix=weekly

       Example 6: Run a historical comparison, then replace the file

         check_postgres_same_schema --dbname=cylon --suffix=daily --replace

       Example  7:  Verify  that  two  databases on hosts star and line are the same, excluding value data (i.e.
       sequence last_val):

         check_postgres_same_schema --dbhost=star,line --assume-async

   <b>sequence</b>
       ("symlink: check_postgres_sequence") Checks how much room is left on all sequences in the database.  This
       is measured as the percent of total possible values that have been used for each sequence.  The <u>--warning</u>
       and <u>--critical</u> options should be expressed as percentages. The default values are <b>85%</b> for the warning and
       <b>95%</b> for the critical. You may use --include and --exclude to control which sequences are to  be  checked.
       Note  that  this  check does account for unusual <b>minvalue</b> and <b>increment</b> <b>by</b> values. By default it does not
       care if the sequence is set to cycle or not, and by passing  <u>--skipcycled</u>  sequenced  set  to  cycle  are
       reported with 0% usage.

       The  output  for  Nagios  gives  the name of the sequence, the percentage used, and the number of 'calls'
       left, indicating how many more times nextval can be called on  that  sequence  before  running  into  the
       maximum value.

       The  output  for MRTG returns the highest percentage across all sequences on the first line, and the name
       of each sequence with that percentage on the fourth line, separated by a "|" (pipe)  if  there  are  more
       than one sequence at that percentage.

       Example 1: Give a warning if any sequences are approaching 95% full.

         check_postgres_sequence --dbport=5432 --warning=95%

       Example 2: Check that the sequence named "orders_id_seq" is not more than half full.

         check_postgres_sequence --dbport=5432 --critical=50% --include=orders_id_seq

   <b>settings_checksum</b>
       ("symlink:  check_postgres_settings_checksum") Checks that all the Postgres settings are the same as last
       time you checked.  This is done by generating a checksum of a sorted list  of  setting  names  and  their
       values.  Note  that  different users in the same database may have different checksums, due to ALTER USER
       usage, and due to the fact that superusers see more settings than ordinary users. Either the <u>--warning</u> or
       the <u>--critical</u> option should be given,  but  not  both.  The  value  of  each  one  is  the  checksum,  a
       32-character  hexadecimal  value.  You  can  run  with  the  special "--critical=0" option to find out an
       existing checksum.

       This action requires the Digest::MD5 module.

       Example 1: Find the initial checksum for the database on  port  5555  using  the  default  user  (usually
       postgres)

         check_postgres_settings_checksum --port=5555 --critical=0

       Example 2: Make sure no settings have changed and warn if so, using the checksum from above.

         check_postgres_settings_checksum --port=5555 --warning=cd2f3b5e129dc2b4f5c0f6d8d2e64231

       For MRTG output, returns a 1 or 0 indicating success of failure of the checksum to match. A checksum must
       be provided as the "--mrtg" argument. The fourth line always gives the current checksum.

   <b>slony_status</b>
       ("symlink:  check_postgres_slony_status")  Checks  in  the  status  of  a Slony cluster by looking at the
       results of Slony's sl_status view. This is returned  as  the  number  of  seconds  of  "lag  time".   The
       <u>--warning</u>  and <u>--critical</u> options should be expressed as times. The default values are <b>60</b> <b>seconds</b> for the
       warning and <b>300</b> <b>seconds</b> for the critical.

       The optional argument <u>--schema</u> indicated the schema that Slony is installed under. If it  is  not  given,
       the schema will be determined automatically each time this check is run.

       Example 1: Give a warning if any Slony is lagged by more than 20 seconds

         check_postgres_slony_status --warning 20

       Example 2: Give a critical if Slony, installed under the schema "_slony", is over 10 minutes lagged

         check_postgres_slony_status --schema=_slony --critical=600

   <b>timesync</b>
       ("symlink: check_postgres_timesync") Compares the local system time with the time reported by one or more
       databases.   The <u>--warning</u> and <u>--critical</u> options represent the number of seconds between the two systems
       before an alert is given. If neither is specified, the default values are used, which are  '2'  and  '5'.
       The  warning  value  cannot be greater than the critical value. Due to the non-exact nature of this test,
       values of '0' or '1' are not recommended.

       The string returned shows the time difference as well as the time on each side written out.

       Example 1: Check that databases on hosts ankh, morpork, and klatch are no more than 3  seconds  off  from
       the local time:

         check_postgres_timesync --host=ankh,morpork,klatch --critical=3

       For  MRTG  output, returns one the first line the number of seconds difference between the local time and
       the database time. The fourth line returns the name of the database.

   <b>txn_idle</b>
       ("symlink: check_postgres_txn_idle") Checks the number and duration of "idle in transaction"  queries  on
       one  or  more  databases.  There  is  no  need  to  run this more than once on the same database cluster.
       Databases can be filtered by using the <u>--include</u> and <u>--exclude</u> options. See the "BASIC FILTERING" section
       below for more details.

       The <u>--warning</u> and <u>--critical</u> options are given as units of time, signed integers, or integers  for  units
       of time, and at least one must be provided (there are no defaults). Valid units are 'seconds', 'minutes',
       'hours', or 'days'. Each may be written singular or abbreviated to just the first letter. If no units are
       given and the numbers are unsigned, the units are assumed to be seconds.

       This action requires Postgres 8.3 or better.

       As  of  PostgreSQL  10,  you  can  just  GRANT <u>pg_read_all_stats</u> to an unprivileged user account.  In all
       earlier versions, superuser privileges are required to see the  queries  of  all  users  in  the  system;
       UNKNOWN  is  returned  if  queries cannot be checked. To only include queries by the connecting user, use
       <u>--includeuser</u>.

       Example 1: Give a warning if any connection has been idle in transaction for more than 15 seconds:

         check_postgres_txn_idle --port=5432 --warning='15 seconds'

       Example 2: Give a warning if there are 50 or more transactions

         check_postgres_txn_idle --port=5432 --warning='+50'

       Example 3: Give a critical if 5 or more connections have been  idle  in  transaction  for  more  than  10
       seconds:

         check_postgres_txn_idle --port=5432 --critical='5 for 10 seconds'

       For  MRTG  output,  returns the time in seconds the longest idle transaction has been running. The fourth
       line returns the name of the database and other information about the longest transaction.

   <b>txn_time</b>
       ("symlink: check_postgres_txn_time") Checks the length of open transactions on  one  or  more  databases.
       There  is  no need to run this command more than once per database cluster.  Databases can be filtered by
       use of the <u>--include</u> and <u>--exclude</u> options. See the "BASIC FILTERING" section for more details. The owner
       of the transaction can also be filtered, by use of the <u>--includeuser</u> and <u>--excludeuser</u> options.  See  the
       "USER NAME FILTERING" section for more details.

       The  values  or the <u>--warning</u> and <u>--critical</u> options are units of time, and at least one must be provided
       (no default). Valid units are 'seconds', 'minutes', 'hours', or 'days'. Each may be written  singular  or
       abbreviated to just the first letter.  If no units are given, the units are assumed to be seconds.

       This action requires Postgres 8.3 or better.

       Example 1: Give a critical if any transaction has been open for more than 10 minutes:

         check_postgres_txn_time --port=5432 --critical='10 minutes'

       Example 1: Warn if user 'warehouse' has a transaction open over 30 seconds

         check_postgres_txn_time --port-5432 --warning=30s --includeuser=warehouse

       For  MRTG  output, returns the maximum time in seconds a transaction has been open on the first line. The
       fourth line gives the name of the database.

   <b>txn_wraparound</b>
       ("symlink: check_postgres_txn_wraparound") Checks  how  close  to  transaction  wraparound  one  or  more
       databases  are  getting.   The <u>--warning</u> and <u>--critical</u> options indicate the number of transactions done,
       and must be a positive integer.  If either option is not given, the default values of 1.3 and 1.4 billion
       are used. There is no need to run this command more than once per database cluster. For a  more  detailed
       discussion   of   what  this  number  represents  and  what  to  do  about  it,  please  visit  the  page
       &lt;https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/routine-vacuuming.html#VACUUM-FOR-WRAPAROUND&gt;

       The warning and critical values can have underscores in the number for legibility, as Perl does.

       Example 1: Check the default values for the localhost database

         check_postgres_txn_wraparound --host=localhost

       Example 2: Check port 6000 and give a critical when 1.7 billion transactions are hit:

         check_postgres_txn_wraparound --port=6000 --critical=1_700_000_000

       For MRTG output, returns the highest number of transactions for all databases on line one, while  line  4
       indicates which database it is.

   <b>version</b>
       ("symlink:  check_postgres_version")  Checks  that  the  required  version  of  Postgres  is running. The
       <u>--warning</u> and <u>--critical</u> options (only one is required) must be of the format <b>X.Y</b> or <b>X.Y.Z</b> where <b>X</b> is the
       major version number, <b>Y</b> is the minor version number, and <b>Z</b> is the revision.

       Example 1: Give a warning if the database on port 5678 is not version 8.4.10:

         check_postgres_version --port=5678 -w=8.4.10

       Example 2: Give a warning if any databases on hosts valley,grain, or sunshine is not 8.3:

         check_postgres_version -H valley,grain,sunshine --critical=8.3

       For MRTG output, reports a 1 or a 0 indicating success or failure on the  first  line.  The  fourth  line
       indicates the current version. The version must be provided via the "--mrtg" option.

   <b>wal_files</b>
       ("symlink:  check_postgres_wal_files")  Checks  how  many  WAL  files  exist  in  the  <u>pg_xlog</u>  directory
       (PostgreSQL 10 and later" <u>pg_wal</u>), which is found off of your <b>data_directory</b>, sometimes as a  symlink  to
       another  physical  disk for performance reasons. If the <u>--lsfunc</u> option is not used then this action must
       be run as a superuser, in order to access the contents of the <u>pg_xlog</u> directory. The minimum  version  to
       use  this  action is Postgres 8.1. The <u>--warning</u> and <u>--critical</u> options are simply the number of files in
       the <u>pg_xlog</u> directory. What number to set this to will vary, but a general guideline is to put  a  number
       slightly higher than what is normally there, to catch problems early.

       Normally,  WAL  files  are  closed  and  then  re-used,  but a long-running open transaction, or a faulty
       <b>archive_command</b> script, may cause Postgres to create too many files. Ultimately, this will cause the disk
       they are on to run out of space, at which point Postgres will shut down.

       To avoid connecting as a database superuser, a wrapper function around pg_ls_dir() should be defined as a
       superuser with SECURITY DEFINER, and the <u>--lsfunc</u> option used. This example function,  if  defined  by  a
       superuser, will allow the script to connect as a normal user <u>nagios</u> with <u>--lsfunc=ls_xlog_dir</u>

         BEGIN;
         CREATE FUNCTION ls_xlog_dir()
             RETURNS SETOF TEXT
             AS $$ SELECT pg_ls_dir('pg_xlog') $$
             LANGUAGE SQL
             SECURITY DEFINER;
         REVOKE ALL ON FUNCTION ls_xlog_dir() FROM PUBLIC;
         GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION ls_xlog_dir() to nagios;
         COMMIT;

       Example  1:  Check  that  the  number  of  ready WAL files is 10 or less on host "pluto", using a wrapper
       function "ls_xlog_dir" to avoid the need for superuser permissions

         check_postgres_archive_ready --host=pluto --critical=10 --lsfunc=ls_xlog_dir

       For MRTG output, reports the number of WAL files on line 1.

   <b>rebuild_symlinks</b>
   <b>rebuild_symlinks_force</b>
       This action requires no other arguments, and does not  connect  to  any  databases,  but  simply  creates
       symlinks in the current directory for each action, in the form <b>check_postgres_&lt;action_name&gt;</b>.  If the file
       already  exists,  it will not be overwritten. If the action is rebuild_symlinks_force, then symlinks will
       be overwritten. The option --symlinks is a shorter way of saying --action=rebuild_symlinks

</pre><h4><b>BASIC</b> <b>FILTERING</b></h4><pre>
       The options <u>--include</u> and <u>--exclude</u> can be combined to limit which things are checked, depending  on  the
       action.  The  name  of  the  database  can  be  filtered  when  using  the  following  actions: backends,
       database_size, locks, query_time, txn_idle, and txn_time.  The name of a relation can  be  filtered  when
       using  the following actions: bloat, index_size, table_size, relation_size, last_vacuum, last_autovacuum,
       last_analyze,  and  last_autoanalyze.   The  name  of  a  setting  can  be  filtered   when   using   the
       settings_checksum action.  The name of a file system can be filtered when using the disk_space action.

       If only an include option is given, then ONLY those entries that match will be checked. However, if given
       both  exclude and include, the exclusion is done first, and the inclusion after, to reinstate things that
       may have been excluded. Both <u>--include</u> and <u>--exclude</u> can  be  given  multiple  times,  and/or  as  comma-
       separated lists. A leading tilde will match the following word as a regular expression.

       To  match  a  schema, end the search term with a single period. Leading tildes can be used for schemas as
       well.

       Be careful when using filtering: an inclusion rule on the backends, for example, may report  no  problems
       not  only  because  the  matching  database  had  no backends, but because you misspelled the name of the
       database!

       Examples:

       Only checks items named pg_class:

        --include=pg_class

       Only checks items containing the letters 'pg_':

        --include=~pg_

       Only check items beginning with 'pg_':

        --include=~^pg_

       Exclude the item named 'test':

        --exclude=test

       Exclude all items containing the letters 'test:

        --exclude=~test

       Exclude all items in the schema 'pg_catalog':

        --exclude='pg_catalog.'

       Exclude all items in the 'pg_temp_nnn' per-session temporary schemas:

        --exclude=~^pg_temp_.

       Exclude all items containing the letters 'ace', but allow the item 'faceoff':

        --exclude=~ace --include=faceoff

       Exclude all items which start with the letters 'pg_', which contain the  letters  'slon',  or  which  are
       named  'sql_settings'  or  'green'.  Specifically check items with the letters 'prod' in their names, and
       always check the item named 'pg_relname':

        --exclude=~^pg_,~slon,sql_settings --exclude=green --include=~prod,pg_relname

</pre><h4><b>USER</b> <b>NAME</b> <b>FILTERING</b></h4><pre>
       The options <u>--includeuser</u> and <u>--excludeuser</u> can be used on some actions to only examine database  objects
       owned  by  (or  not  owned by) one or more users.  An <u>--includeuser</u> option always trumps an <u>--excludeuser</u>
       option. You can give each option more than once for multiple users, or you  can  give  a  comma-separated
       list. The actions that currently use these options are:

       database_size
       last_analyze
       last_autoanalyze
       last_vacuum
       last_autovacuum
       query_time
       relation_size
       txn_time

       Examples:

       Only check items owned by the user named greg:

        --includeuser=greg

       Only check items owned by either watson or crick:

        --includeuser=watson,crick

       Only check items owned by crick,franklin, watson, or wilkins:

        --includeuser=watson --includeuser=franklin --includeuser=crick,wilkins

       Check all items except for those belonging to the user scott:

        --excludeuser=scott

</pre><h4><b>TEST</b> <b>MODE</b></h4><pre>
       To  help  in setting things up, this program can be run in a "test mode" by specifying the <u>--test</u> option.
       This will perform some basic tests to make sure that the databases can be  contacted,  and  that  certain
       per-action  prerequisites are met, such as whether the user is a superuser, if the version of Postgres is
       new enough, and if stats_row_level is enabled.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       In addition to command-line configurations,  you  can  put  any  options  inside  of  a  file.  The  file
       <u>.check_postgresrc</u>  in  the  current  directory  will  be  used  if  found.  If  not  found, then the file
       <u><a href="file:~/.check_postgresrc">~/.check_postgresrc</a></u> will be used. Finally, the file <u>/etc/check_postgresrc</u> will be used if available.  The
       format of the file is option = value, one per line. Any line starting with a '#' will  be  skipped.   Any
       values   loaded   from  a  check_postgresrc  file  will  be  overwritten  by  command-line  options.  All
       check_postgresrc files can be ignored by supplying a "--no-checkpostgresrc" argument.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       The environment variable <u>$ENV{HOME}</u> is used to  look  for  a  <u>.check_postgresrc</u>  file.   The  environment
       variable <u>$ENV{PGBINDIR}</u> is used to look for PostgreSQL binaries.

</pre><h4><b>TIPS</b> <b>AND</b> <b>TRICKS</b></h4><pre>
       Since  this  program uses the <b>psql</b> program, make sure it is accessible to the user running the script. If
       run as a cronjob, this often means modifying the <b>PATH</b> environment variable.

       If you are using Nagios in embedded Perl mode, use the "--action" argument instead of symlinks,  so  that
       the plugin only gets compiled one time.

</pre><h4><b>DEPENDENCIES</b></h4><pre>
       Access to a working version of psql, and the following very standard Perl modules:

       <b>Cwd</b>
       <b>Getopt::Long</b>
       <b>File::Basename</b>
       <b>File::Temp</b>
       <b>Time::HiRes</b> (if $opt{showtime} is set to true, which is the default)

       The "settings_checksum" action requires the <b>Digest::MD5</b> module.

       The "checkpoint" action requires the <b>Date::Parse</b> module.

       Some  actions  require  access  to  external  programs.  If psql is not explicitly specified, the command
       <b>"which"</b> is used to find it. The program <b>"<a href="file:/bin/df">/bin/df</a>"</b> is needed by the "disk_space" action.

</pre><h4><b>DEVELOPMENT</b></h4><pre>
       Development happens using the git system. You can clone the latest version by doing:

        https://github.com/bucardo/check_postgres
        git clone https://github.com/bucardo/check_postgres.git

</pre><h4><b>MAILING</b> <b>LIST</b></h4><pre>
       Three mailing lists are available. For discussions about the program, bug reports, feature requests,  and
       commit notices, send email to <a href="mailto:check_postgres@bucardo.org">check_postgres@bucardo.org</a>

       &lt;https://mail.endcrypt.com/mailman/listinfo/check_postgres&gt;

       A low-volume list for announcement of new versions and important notices is the 'check_postgres-announce'
       list:

       &lt;https://mail.endcrypt.com/mailman/listinfo/check_postgres-announce&gt;

       Source code changes (via git-commit) are sent to the 'check_postgres-commit' list:

       &lt;https://mail.endcrypt.com/mailman/listinfo/check_postgres-commit&gt;

            Lots of refactoring and cleanup of how actions handle arguments.
            Do basic checks to figure out syslog file for 'logfile' action.
            Allow for exact matching of beta versions with 'version' action.
            Redo the default arguments to only populate when neither 'warning' nor 'critical' is provided.
            Allow just warning OR critical to be given for the 'timesync' action.
            Remove 'redirect_stderr' requirement from 'logfile' due to 8.3 changes.
            Actions 'last_vacuum' and 'last_analyze' are 8.2 only (Robert Treat)
