</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       pgCluu - PostgreSQL Cluster utilization

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       pgCluu is a PostgreSQL performance monitoring and auditing tool.

       It is a Perl program used to perform a full audit of a PostgreSQL Cluster and System performance. It is
       divided in two parts:

       - A collector used to grab statistics on the PostgreSQL cluster using the psql command line utility and
       sar from the sysstat package.

       - A pure Perl grapher that will generate all HTML and charts output without any requirements.

       If you don't need system utilization reports or don't want to install the sysstat package, you can
       disable it at command line. You will only have reports about your PostgreSQL Cluster. If you are running
       pgCluu from a central server using option -h to monitor remotely a PostgreSQL Cluster, the call to sar is
       automatically disabled.

       If you just want to have system utilization reports or generate graphs from a sar data file, it's also
       possible.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       PostgreSQL and System metrics collector.

               pgcluu_collectd [options] output_dir

       Report generator.

               pgcluu [options] -o report_dir input_dir

</pre><h4><b>REQUIREMENT</b></h4><pre>
       pgCluu comes with two Perl scripts. You need a modern Perl distribution, the psql client and the sar
       command line utility (sysstat). The sysstat package is optional, you can still use pgCluu to generate
       reports about your PostgreSQL Cluster without it.

       Charts are rendered using a Javascript library so you don't need anything else.  Your browser will do all
       the work.

</pre><h4><b>INSTALLATION</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Installation</b> <b>from</b> <b>package</b>
       Installation of pgCluu can be done through the PostgreSQL Global Development Group (PGDG) repositories.
       See how to install the PGDG repositories at the following URLs for Debian and Ubuntu:

               https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Apt

       and Redhat, CentOs, Fedora, Scientific Linux and Oracle Enterprise Linux:

               https://yum.postgresql.org/

       Once it is done you can simply install pgCluu with commands:

               sudo apt install pgcluu
               sudo yum install pgcluu

       Look at the package information to know where files are specifically installed. See next two chapters to
       see which default installation paths are used.

   <b>Installation</b> <b>from</b> <b>sources</b>
       Download the tarball from GitHub and unpack the archive:

               tar xzf pgcluu-3.x.tar.gz
               cd pgcluu-3.x/
               perl Makefile.PL
               make &amp;&amp; sudo make install

       This will copy the Perl scripts pgcluu_collectd and pgcluu into <a href="file:/usr/local/bin">/usr/local/bin</a> directory and the man page
       to /usr/local/share/man/man1/pgcluu.1p.gz.  Those are the default installation directories for 'site'
       install on some well-known distribution but the path could change.

       If you want to install all under <a href="file:/usr">/usr</a> location, use INSTALLDIRS='vendor' as an argument of Makefile.PL.
       The script will be installed into /usr/bin/pgcluu and the manpage into /usr/share/man/man1/pgcluu.1p.gz.

       For example, to install everything just like Debian does, proceed as follows:

               perl Makefile.PL INSTALLDIRS=vendor

       By default INSTALLDIRS is set to site.

       The directory where statistics will be saved is /var/lib/pgcluu/data and the default directory for
       reports is /var/lib/pgcluu/report.

       The CGI script is installed into /var/lib/cgi-bin/pgcluu.cgi and the Apache configuration file into
       /etc/apache/conf-available/pgcluu.conf. This file allow acces to resources files (CSS and JS files) from
       installation directory /usr/local/share/pgcluu/rsc/. Access is granted to local user only by default.

       All scripts (pgcluu_collectd, pgcluu and pgcluu.cgi) are reading configuration file from
       /usr/local/etc/pgcluu.conf. This file is mainly use by the CGI script but some directives are dedicated
       to pgcluu_collectd and pgcluu script to define the retention days for example.

   <b>Custom</b> <b>installation</b>
       The installation of pgCluu can be fully customized through environment variables
       (RSCDIR,CGIDIR,CONFDIR,PIDDIR,STATDIR,APACHECONF,MANDIR, DOCDIR,SYSTEMDDIR,RETENTION). These variables
       are passed to Makefile.PL as command line arguments or can be exported as environment variables before
       running "perl Makefile.PL".

       The default values for these variables are:

           DESTDIR     =&gt; <a href="file:/usr/local">/usr/local</a>
           INSTALLDIRS =&gt; site
           CONFDIR     =&gt; DESTDIR/etc
           PIDDIR      =&gt; /var/run/postgres
           STATDIR     =&gt; /var/lib/pgcluu/data
           REPORTDIR   =&gt; /var/lib/pgcluu/data
           RSCDIR      =&gt; DESTDIR/share/pgcluu
           CGIDIR      =&gt; /usr/lib/cgi-bin
           APACHECONF  =&gt; /etc/apache2/conf-available
           MANDIR      =&gt; DESTDIR/share/man
           DOCDIR      =&gt; DESTDIR/share/doc
           SYSTEMDIR   =&gt; DESTDIR/lib/systemd/system
           RETENTION   =&gt; 0

       If INSTALLDIRS is set to 'vendor':

           CONFDIR     =&gt; <a href="file:/etc">/etc</a>
           DESTDIR     =&gt; <a href="file:/usr">/usr</a>

       The configuration file is auto-generated by the Makefile.PL script and saved into CONFDIR/pgcluu.conf. If
       the destination file exists it is not overridden. The file is also saved as example in the directory
       DOCDIR/pgcluu/examples/pgcluu.conf.dist

       The directory where pgcluu_collectd will store statistics is defined with STATDIR which is by default
       /var/lib/pgcluu/data. The directory where pgcluu will generate static html reports is defined by
       REPORTDIR.  The default is /var/lib/pgcluu/report. Both directory must be owned by the postgres user.

       The man page is saved as DESTDIR/share/man/pgcluu.1p.gz and a symbolic link pgcluu_collectd.1p.gz is
       created to this file. The documentation, README, changelog.gz, LICENSE files are saved under
       DESTDIR/share/doc/.

       For the CGI mode, the resources (css and js files from the cgi-bin/rsc) are saved under the
       DESTDIR/share/pgcluu/rsc directory. The CGI script is saved under /usr/lib/cgi-bin/pgcluu.cgi. The Apache
       configuration file under /etc/apache2/conf-available/pgcluu.conf with a symbolic link
       /etc/apache2/conf-enabled/pgcluu.conf created to this file. Its content:

           Alias /pgcluu RSCDIR/
           &lt;Directory RSCDIR/&gt;
               Options FollowSymLinks MultiViews
               AllowOverride None
               Require local
               #Require ip 192.1.168.0/24
           &lt;/Directory&gt;

       The systemd files (pgcluu_collectd.service,pgcluu.service,pgcluu.timer) are saved as examples into
       DOCDIR/pgcluu/examples/ and into the systemd directory SYSTEMDDIR/

       The right path to the configuration file is set into all scripts pgcluu, pgcluu_collectd and pgcluu.cgi.
       The path where the pid file must be saved is replaced into pgcluu_collectd with the value of PIDFILE
       variable.

       Paths to scripts, pid directory, statistics and reports are replaced in all systemd service files
       following the values of the environment variable explain here.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Manually</u>

       See next two chapters for a complete description of the command line options.  For the impatient, here
       some simple commands that could be run as postgres user:

               mkdir /tmp/stat_db1/
               pgcluu_collectd -D -i 60 /tmp/stat_db1/
               LOG: Detach from terminal with pid: 11323

       or with more options

               pgcluu_collectd -D -i 60 /tmp/stat_db1/ -h 10.10.1.1 -U postgres -d mydb
               LOG: Detach from terminal with pid: 14671

       wait some time and activity on your PostgreSQL Cluster...  Then stop the pgcluu_collectd daemon and
       generate the report:

               pgcluu_collectd -k
               LOG: Received terminating signal.
               mkdir /tmp/report_db1/
               pgcluu -o /tmp/report_db1/ /tmp/stat_db1/

       You should obtain something like example at <a href="http://pgcluu.darold.net/example/">http://pgcluu.darold.net/example/</a>

       By default all javascript, css and the webfont fontawesome are automatically generated into the output
       directory if those files does not already exits.

       <u>Using</u> <u>systemd</u> <u>unit</u> <u>files</u>

       pgcluu comes with systemd service files:

           - pgcluu_collectd.service: execute pgcluu_collectd as a daemon to collect statistics.
           - pgcluu.service: execute pgcluu to generate reports.
           - pgcluu.timer: run periodically pgcluu.service

       These files are installed automatically by the install script or the package into <a href="file:/lib/systemd/system/.">/lib/systemd/system/.</a>
       To activate these services proceed as follow:

               systemctl daemon-reload
               systemctl enable pgcluu_collectd.service
               systemctl enable pgcluu.service
               systemctl enable pgcluu.timer
               systemctl start pgcluu_collectd.service
               systemctl start pgcluu.timer

       Be warn that storing indefinitely statistics with pgcluu_collectd can fill you disk space in the short or
       medium term. You have to remove obsolete statistics manually using a cron job or using the embedded
       retention feature by adding option '--retention ndays' to pgcluu_collectd call or by changing the value
       of STATS_COLLECTD_RETENTION configuration directive in file /usr/local/etc/pgcluu.conf or
       /etc/pgcluu.conf file following your installation.  You can also set STATS_REPORT_RETENTION to limit the
       retention of reports directories or use option '--retention ndays' with pgcluu. Default is to preserve
       collected data for the past 30 days.

       If you want to use the CGI mode you also have activate pgcluu caching by enabling value
       STATS_REPORT_CACHING in the configuration file and using pgcluu.service+pgcluu.timer. If you don"t want
       to use systemd you can simply run pgcluu script with the -C option and execute it periodically through a
       cron job.

       Note that the systemd service files set the privilege to the data and report directory to user postgres
       and group www-data. By this way reports are readable through an httpd server for static reports and data
       are readable through the CGI if enabled. Command executed by the pgcluu_collectd.service file (daemon
       part) are:

               <a href="file:/bin/mkdir">/bin/mkdir</a> -p $STATDIR
               <a href="file:/bin/chown">/bin/chown</a> postgres:www-data $STATDIR
               <a href="file:/bin/chmod">/bin/chmod</a> u=rwX,g=rsX,o= $STATDIR

       The pgcluu.service file (client part) execute commands:

               <a href="file:/bin/mkdir">/bin/mkdir</a> -p $REPORTDIR
               <a href="file:/bin/chown">/bin/chown</a> postgres:www-data $REPORTDIR
               <a href="file:/bin/chmod">/bin/chmod</a> u=rwX,g=rsX,o= $REPORTDIR

       In case you don't want to use systemd service files you will have to execute these commands manually
       before tunning pgCluu.

       For pgcluu reports, the output directory can be defined in the configuration file using the
       STATS_REPORT_OUTDIR directive.

</pre><h4><b>COLLECTING</b> <b>STATISTICS</b></h4><pre>
       To generate reports about your PostgreSQL Cluster Utilization you must collect statistics before.
       pgcluu_collectd is here for that. It can be run in a daemon mode (option -D) or in interactive mode for
       debugging purpose. All you need is to provide a directory where data will be stored. Statistics will be
       pooled at a default interval of 60 seconds, using option -i you can customize it. See below for a
       complete list of command line options.

       Use those options to execute sar on the remote host defined by the -h option, otherwise it will be
       executed locally:

         --enable-ssh             activate the use of ssh to run sysstat remotely.
         --ssh-program ssh        path to the ssh program to use. Default: ssh.
         --ssh-user username      connection login name. Default to running user.
         --ssh-identity file      path to the identity file to use.
         --ssh-timeout second     timeout to ssh connection failure. Default 10.
         --ssh-options  options   list of -o options to use for the ssh connection.
                                  Options always used:
                                    -o ConnectTimeout=$ssh_timeout
                                    -o PreferredAuthentications=hostbased,publickey

       For example, as postgres user to monitor locally a full PostgreSQL cluster:

         mkdir /tmp/stat_db1/
         pgcluu_collectd -D -i 60 /tmp/stat_db1/

       to collect statistics from pgbouncer too, and limit database statistics to a single database:

         pgcluu_collectd -D -i 60 /tmp/stat_db1/ -h 10.10.1.1 -U postgres -d mydb
                       --pgbouncer-args='-p 5342'

       to disable statistics collect between 22:30 and 06:30 the next day:

         pgcluu_collectd -D -i 60 /tmp/stat_db1/ --exclude-time "22:30-06:30"

       to collect statistics from a remote server:

           pgcluu_collectd -D -i 60 /tmp/statdb1/ -h 10.0.0.1 -U postgres --disable-sar

       the same but with collecting system statistics using remote sar calls:

         pgcluu_collectd -D -i 60 /tmp/statdb1/ -h 10.0.0.1 -U postgres --enable-ssh
               --ssh-user postgres --ssh-identity /var/lib/postgresql/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

       You may need a .pgpass and be able to establish passwordless ssh connections to be able to collect
       statistics from remote hosts.

       Then after some time and activities on the database, stop the daemon as follow:

         pgcluu_collectd -k

       or by sending sigterm to the pgcluu_collectd's pid.

       You can run the collector in incremental mode using a daily or a hourly statistics rotation:

         pgcluu_collectd -D -i 60 /tmp/stat_db1/ --rotate-daily

       On a server with huge activity you may want to use --rotate-hourly and compression mode with --compress
       option. If you have limited disk space you can restrict the retention time of statistics files using
       option --retention with the storage day limit.

   <b>Statistics</b> <b>files</b>
       The output directory with all statistics collected should look likes:

               |-- sar_stats.dat
               |-- sysinfo.txt

       Then now you can proceed with pgcluu to generate reports.

   <b>Additional</b> <b>statistics</b> <b>from</b> <b>extensions</b>
       To be able to report top statements, wait events and subxact statistics you need to create the related
       extensions into a single database and use this database for primary connection to pgcluu_collectd using
       the -d option.

       The related extension are pg_stat_statements, pg_wait_sampling and pg_subxact_counters.

   <b>Rotation</b> <b>and</b> <b>compression</b>
       When used the --rotate-daily or --rotate-hourly commands line option will force pgcluu_collectd to rotate
       daily or hourly all statistic's files. In this case, statistics files will be created in a subdirectory
       based on rotation frequency, output_dir/year/month/day[/hour]. This is called the incremental mode.

       To save filesystem space it is possible to enable compression of all rotated files during the rotation
       process. Just activate the -z or --compress command line option. You can also use the --retention option
       to set the storage time limit in days.

   <b>Incremental</b> <b>mode</b>
       This mode is enabled when --rotate-daily or --rotate-hourly command line options are used. It allow
       pgcluu to build reports incrementally by days or hours. In this mode you don't have to build reports per
       day or hour pgcluu will do the work automatically, just give it the top statistics directory.

               pgcluu -o /var/www/pgcluu/reports/ /var/lib/pgcluu/data/

       pgcluu will detect that --rotate-daily or --rotate-hourly have been used to collect data and generate
       reports for each day or hours stored. Previous directories already processed will not be processed again
       unless this was the the last one.

       The daily or hourly basis statistic storage also allow the use of the CGI script pgcluu.cgi to have
       dynamic reports and temporal search. See "Using dynamic mode" chapter.

       When used the --rotate-daily or --rotate-hourly commands line option will force pgcluu_collectd to rotate
       daily or hourly all statistic's files. In this case, statistics files will be created in a subdirectory
       based on rotation frequency, output_dir/year/month/day[/hour]. This is called the incremental mode.

       To save filesystem space it is possible to enable compression of all rotated files during the rotation
       process. Just activate the -z or --compress command line option. You can also use the --retention option
       to set the storage time limit in days.

   <b>Capture</b> <b>mode</b>
       The goal of this mode is to be able to obtain a simple report about the PostgreSQL installation without
       collected metrics others than database and tablespace size. This report can be use by ITs to better
       understand the configuration and things that need to be tuned.

       To enable this mode, just run pgcluu_collectd with the single option -c or --capture. Other command line
       options will not be taken in account.  pgcluu_collectd will create e temporary directory
       /tmp/pgcluu_capture to store temporary data and will removed if after building a compressed tar archive:
       /tmp/pgcluu_capture.tar.gz. This is this archive that can be used with pgcluu to build a snapshot report
       of the instance. pgcluu will automatically detect this mode.

</pre><h4><b>GENERATING</b> <b>REPORTS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Static</b> <b>HTML</b> <b>reports</b>
       To generate a pgCluu report about a PostgreSQL Cluster you must, at least, have a directory that contains
       all data files generated by pgcluu_collectd or pgstats. In this directory, if you have a file named
       sar_stats.dat or sadc_stats.dat for binary sadc data file, it will be taken to build report about system
       utilization. If you just want to make a report from a sar file use the -i or -I options.

       usage: pgcluu [options] [-i sar_file | -I sadc_file] [input_dir]

               input_dir: directory where pgcluu_collectd or pgstats and sar data
                          files are stored.

       options:
         -b, --begin  datetime      start date/time for the data to be parsed (time of current timezone).
         -C, --cache                generate cache files only (.bin), no html output.
         -d, --db-only dbname       only report for the whole cluster and the given
                                    database name. You can use it multiple time or
                                    give a comma separated list of database name.
         -D, --device-only dev      only report I/O stats for a particular device
                                    You can use it multiple time or give a comma
                                    separated list of device name, ex: sda,sdc.
         -e, --end    datetime      end date/time for the data to be parsed (time of current timezone).
         -i, --sar-file=FILE        path to the sar text data file to read to generate
                                    system reports. Default to input_dir/sar_stats.dat.
         -I, --sadc-file=FILE       sadc binary data file to read to generate system
                                    reports. Default to input_dir/sadc_stats.dat.
         -n, --top-number           Top number of tables or indexes I/O stats to show.
                                    Default is set to top 10. Set it to 0 to show all.
         -N, --network-only iface   only report stats for a particular network interface.
                                    You can use it multiple times or give a comma separated
                                    list of network interfaces, ex: eth0,eth1.
         -o, --output=DIR           output directory
         -r, --reverse-date         By default pgcluu look at mm/dd/yy format in sar file.
                                    When enabled pgcluu will look at dd/mm/yy format.
         -s, --sadf=BIN             path to the sadf sysstat command used to read the
                                    sadc binary data file. Default: /usr/bin/sadf.
         -S, --disable-sar          disable collect of system statistics with sar.
         -t, --with-table table     Only report for the whole tables and the given
                                    table name. You can use it multiple time or
                                    give a comma separated list of database name.
         -T, --no-table             Do not report statistics related to tables.
         -v, --verbose              Print out debug informations.
         -V, --version              Show pgcluu version and exit.
         -x, --external-menu        Save menu in menu.html and load it into each report
                                    using w3-include-html attribut from w3.js. This will
       only work if acces to HTML reports is through a Web                     server, not using the file://
       protocol.
         -z, --timezone +/-XX       Set the number of hour(s) from GMT of the timezone,
                                    Eg: -z +02
                                    Usually autodetected.
                                    Use this to adjust date/time from the sar output,
                                    pgcluu use GMT time to draw charts.
         -Z, --stats-timezone +/-XX Set the number of hour(s) from GMT of the timezone.
                                    Eg: -Z +02
                                    Usually autodetected.
                                    Use this to adjust date/time from the cluster and
                                    system stats output, pgcluu use GMT time.
         --from-sa-file             instruct pgcluu that file specified by the -i option
                                    uses the standard system activity daily data file.
         --charset                  used to set the HTML charset to be used.
                                    Default: utf-8.
         --retention NDAYS          number of rolling days to keep in report directory.
                                    Default is to store indefinitely.
         --help                     print usage

       For example, you can generate all HTML reports from data files stored into /tmp/stat_db1/ with the
       following commands:

               mkdir /tmp/report_db1/
               pgcluu -o /tmp/report_db1/ /tmp/stat_db1/

       If you just want reports of some databases, use the following:

               pgcluu -o /tmp/report_db1/ /tmp/stat_db1/ --db-only "db1,db2,db3"

       If you just want to create a report from a sar output file:

               sar -p -A 10 60 &gt; /root/my_sar_file.txt
               pgcluu -o /tmp/report_sar/ -i /root/my_sar_file.txt

       or from a daily sa file:

               sar -p -A -f /var/log/sa/sa18 &gt; /root/my_sar_file.txt
               pgcluu -o /tmp/report_sar/ -i /root/my_sar_file.txt --from-sa-file

       and from a sa binary file:

               pgcluu -o /tmp/report_sar/ -i /var/log/sysstat/sa22

       or the sa text file if you don't have the same version of sysstat:

               pgcluu -o /tmp/report_sar/ -i /var/log/sysstat/sar23 --from-sa-file

       If pgcluu_collectd have been run in incremental mode you can limit the number of retention days used for
       the reports:

               pgcluu -o /tmp/report_sar/ /tmp/stat_db1/ --retention 30

       A static report will be built for each day or hour following the rotation used with pgcluu_collectd.

   <b>Dynamic</b> <b>reports</b> <b>(CGI)</b>
       Dynamics reports are build by a CGI script named pgcluu.cgi that can be found in the cgi-bin repository
       of the source code. It allow you to select the time period to build reports and to look at all differents
       reports for this period just as with static HTML reports. After installation from sources or binary
       packages the CGI might be found in /usr/lib/cgi-bin/pgcluu.cgi or /var/www/cgi-bin/pgcluu.cgi following
       your distribution.

       To use pgCluu in CGI mode, you need a Web server (here we use Apache) and a cron task to build the cache
       periodically.

       First enable CGI mode.

               sudo a2enmod cgi
               sudo service apache2 restart

       Then the CGI need to find the statistics directory where pgcluu_collectd mostly /var/lib/pgcluu/data/.
       The content of this repository must be readable by the Apache user (www-data).

       Take care to restrict access to your server and the CGI as information about your database and server are
       exposed in the reports.

       The CGI script, pgcluu.cgi, use resources files (CSS and javascript). They are stored in the cgi-bin/rsc/
       directory of the source distribution. Install this repository onto the DocumentRoot of your Web server,
       for example:

               sudo mkdir /var/www/pgcluu/
               sudo cp -rf cgi-bin/rsc /var/www/pgcluu/

       Then edit /etc/pgcluu.conf, copy it from sources cgi-bin/pgcluu.conf if it doesn't exists. Change the
       RSC_BASE and INPUT_DIR configuration directive to match your installation. Here in our example:

               RSC_BASE        /pgcluu/rsc/
               INPUT_DIR       /var/lib/pgcluu/data

       Now we can start the data collection. For the moment pgcluu.conf is only read by the CGI pgcluu.cgi but
       this might change in the future.

       To let pgCluu start collecting data, you can use the following command (you can change it to however you
       like). We will need postgres user for this.

               sudo su - postgres
               /usr/local/bin/pgcluu_collectd -D -i 60 --rotate-daily /var/lib/pgcluu/data

       This will rotate you data daily. This is also the default in the systemd service file.

       Plugging the CGI directly to the CSV statistics files will result in very slow generation reports. To
       improve speed caching must be used, you must execute periodically pgcluu in cache mode. Run it manually
       the first time

               /usr/local/bin/pgcluu --cache /var/lib/pgcluu/data

       then add a cron task to execute the command each five or ten minutes:

               */5 * * * * /usr/local/bin/pgcluu --cache /var/lib/pgcluu/data

       If you are using systemd pgcluu.timer service then caching can be enabled using STATS_REPORT_CACHING
       directive. Enabling this mode generate cache files (*.bin) in the statistics directory and disable static
       HTML reports generation.

       To see your reports, go to the following URL:

               <a href="http://localhost/cgi-bin/pgcluu.cgi">http://localhost/cgi-bin/pgcluu.cgi</a>

       Or change localhost by your fqdn server name.

       Note that here pgcluu_collectd and pgcluu scripts are found in <a href="file:/usr/local/bin/">/usr/local/bin/</a> which is the default for
       an installation from sources but with an installation from binary package you might find them into
       <a href="file:/usr/bin/.">/usr/bin/.</a>

       The CGI mode allow you to select the period of time used to generate the statistics reports. Using
       default pgcluu_collectd 60 seconds interval, a daily graph will have 1440 points. Having too much
       timeseries to render is not a good point for performances so we are limiting to the first seven days of
       the selected period. This mean a maximum of 10080 points for one week, this seems a safe limit. Feel free
       to increase or reduce the limit following the server and client resources. This is controlled by

               MAX_RENDERED_DAYS       7

       configuration directive in pgcluu.conf

       pgCluu is an original development of Gilles Darold.

       Some parts of the collector are taken from pgstats a C program writen by Guillaume Lelarge and especially
       the SQL queries including the compatibility with all PostgreSQL versions. See
       https://github.com/gleu/pgstats

       Btw pgCluu grapher is compatible with files generated by pgstats, sar and sadc so you can use it
       independantly to graph those data. Some part of the sar output parser are taken from SysUsage. See
