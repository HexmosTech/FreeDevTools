</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       cpandb - interface to "CPAN::SQLite"

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 0.220

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This script is an interface to the routines of CPAN::SQLite for setting up, maintaining and searching a
       "DBD::SQLite" database of CPAN. Available options can be grouped into three categories.

   <b>Common</b> <b>options</b>
       These are options which are common to both setting up and maintaining the database or performing queries
       on it.  These are

       •  "--CPAN  '/path/to/CPAN'"

          This  specifies the path to where the index files are to be stored. This could be a local CPAN mirror,
          defined here by the presence of a <u>MIRRORED.BY</u> file beneath this directory, or  a  local  directory  in
          which  to store these files from a remote CPAN mirror. In the latter case, the index files are fetched
          from a remote CPAN mirror, using the same list that "CPAN.pm" uses, if this  is  configured,  and  are
          updated if they are more than one day old.

          If  the  "CPAN"  option is not given, it will default to "cpan_home" of CPAN::, if this is configured,
          with the sources being found under "keep_source_where".  A fatal error results  if  such  a  directory
          isn't found.  Updates to these index files are assumed here to be handled by "CPAN.pm".

       •  "--db_name  'cpan-sqlite'"

          This  is  the  name  of  the  database  that  "DBD::SQLite"  will  use. If not given, this defaults to
          "cpandb-sqlite".

       •  "--db_dir  '/path/to/db/dir'"

          This specifies the path to where the database file  is  found.  If  not  given,  it  defaults  to  the
          "cpan_home" directory of "CPAN.pm", if present, or to the directory in which the script was invoked.

   <b>Indexing</b> <b>options</b>
       These are options which are used for setting up and maintaining the database. These include

       •  "--setup"

          This  specifies  that  the database is to be created and populated from the CPAN indices; any existing
          database will be overwritten.

       •  "--update"

          This is used to update an existing database, which must have  first  been  created  with  the  "setup"
          option.

       •  "--reindex 'dist_name'"

          This specifies that the CPAN distribution "dist_name" is to be reindexed.

   <b>Querying</b> <b>options</b>
       These options are used to query the database. Available options are

       •  "--module Mod::Name"

          This provides information on the specified module name.

       •  "--dist Dist-Name"

          This provides information on the specified distribution name.

       •  "--cpanid CPANID"

          This provides information on the specified CPAN author id

       All search terms are assumed to be exact matches in a case-insensitive manner.

       There's  no limit on maximum number of records. If you need to adjust the number because you get too many
       results, set the CPAN_SQLITE_MAX_RESULTS environment variable.
