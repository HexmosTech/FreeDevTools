</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       pg_format - PostgreSQL SQL syntax beautifier

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This SQL formatter/beautifier supports keywords from SQL-92, SQL-99, SQL-2003, SQL-2008, SQL-2011 and
       PostgreSQL specifics keywords. Works with any other databases too.

       pgFormatter can work as a console program or as a CGI. It will automatically detect its environment and
       format output as text or as HTML following the context.  It can also return a JSON-formatted response if
       used as CGI with 'Accept: application/json'.

       Keywords highlighting will only be available in CGI context.

   <b>Terminal/console</b> <b>execution</b>
       Usage: pg_format [options] file.sql

           PostgreSQL SQL queries and PL/PGSQL code beautifier.

       Arguments:

           file.sql can be a file, multiple files or use - to read query from stdin.

           Returning the SQL formatted to stdout or into a file specified with
           the -o | --output option.

       Options:

           -a | --anonymize      : obscure all literals in queries, useful to hide
                                   confidential data before formatting.
           -b | --comma-start    : in a parameters list, start with the comma (see -e)
           -B | --comma-break    : in insert statement, add a newline after each comma.
           -c | --config FILE    : use a configuration file. Default is to not use
                                   configuration file unless files ./.pg_format or
                                   $HOME/.pg_format or the XDG Base Directory file
                                   $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/pg_format/pg_format.conf exist.

           -W | --wrap-after N   : number of column after which lists must be wrapped.
                                   Default: puts every item on its own line.
           -X | --no-rcfile      : don't read rc files automatically (./.pg_format or
                                   $HOME/.pg_format or $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/pg_format).
                                   The --config / -c option overrides it.
           --extra-function FILE : file containing a list of functions to use the same
                                   formatting as PostgreSQL internal function.
           --extra-keyword FILE  : file containing a list of keywords to use the same
                                   formatting as PostgreSQL internal keyword. Use
                                   special value 'redshift' for support to Redshift
                                   keywords defined internaly in pgFormatter.
           --no-space-function : remove space between function call and the open
                                   parenthesis.
           --redundant-parenthesis: do not remove redundant parenthesis in DML.

       Examples:

           cat samples/ex1.sql | pg_format -
           pg_format -n samples/ex1.sql
           pg_format -f 2 -n -o result.sql samples/ex1.sql

   <b>CGI</b> <b>context</b>
       Install pg_format into your cgi-bin folder, grant execution on it as a CGI script (maybe you should add
       the .cgi extension) and get it from your favorite browser. Copy files logo_pgformatter.png and
       icon_pgformatter.ico in the CGI directory, pg_format.cgi look for them in the same repository.

       You have a live example without limitation than ten thousand characters in your SQL query here:

               <a href="http://sqlformat.darold.net/">http://sqlformat.darold.net/</a>

       pg_format will automatically detected that it is running in a CGI environment and will output all html
       code needed to run an online code formatter site.  There's nothing more to do.

       You need to install the Perl CGI and JSON modules first. If it is not already the case do:

               yum install perl-cgi
               yum install perl-json
       or
               apt install libcgi-pm-perl
               apt install libjson-perl

       following your distribution.

</pre><h4><b>INSTALLATION</b></h4><pre>
       Following your Linux distribution you might need to install the autodie Perl module:

               sudo yum -y install perl-autodie

       Download the tarball from github and unpack the archive as follow:

               version=5.3 #please use the latest release version from github
               wget https://github.com/darold/pgFormatter/archive/refs/tags/v${version}.tar.gz
               tar xzf v${version}.tar.gz
               cd pgFormatter-${version}/
               perl Makefile.PL
               make &amp;&amp; sudo make install
               cd ../ &amp;&amp; rm -rf v${version}.tar.gz &amp;&amp; rm -rf pgFormatter-${version} #clean up

       This will copy the Perl script pg_format in /usr/local/bin/pg_format directory by default and the man
       page into /usr/local/share/man/man1/pg_format.1. Those are the default installation directory for 'site'
       install.

       If you want to install all under <a href="file:/usr/">/usr/</a> location, use INSTALLDIRS='perl' as argument of Makefile.PL. The
       script will be installed into /usr/bin/pg_format and the manpage into /usr/share/man/man1/pg_format.1.

       For example, to install everything just like Debian does, proceed as follow:

               perl Makefile.PL INSTALLDIRS=vendor

       By default INSTALLDIRS is set to site.

       Regression tests can be executed with the following command:

               make test

       If you have docker installed you can build a pgFormatter image using:

               docker build -t darold.net/pgformatter .

       then just use it as

               cat file.sql | docker run --rm -a stdin -a stdout -i darold.net/pgformatter -

</pre><h4><b>SPECIAL</b> <b>FORMATTING</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Option</b> <b>-W,</b> <b>--wrap-after</b>
       This option can be used to set number of column after which lists must be wrapped. By default pgFormatter
       puts every item on its own line. This format applies to SELECT and FROM list. For example the following
       query:

           SELECT a, b, c, d FROM t_1, t_2, t3 WHERE a = 10 AND b = 10;

       will be formatted into with -W 4:

           SELECT a, b, c, d
           FROM t_1, t_2, t3
           WHERE a = 10
               AND b = 10;

       Note this formatting doesn't fits well with sub queries in list.

   <b>Option</b> <b>-w,</b> <b>--wrap-limit</b>
       This option wraps queries at a certain length whatever is the part of the query at the limit unless it is
       a comment. For example if the limit is reach in a text constant the text will be wrapped.  Indentation is
       not included in the character count. This option is applied in all cases even if other options are used.

   <b>Option</b> <b>-C,</b> <b>--wrap-comment</b>
       This option wraps comments at the length defined by -w, --wrap-limit whatever is the part of the comment.
       Indentation is not included in the character count.

   <b>Option</b> <b>-t,</b> <b>--format-type</b>
       This option activate an alternative formatting that adds:

         * newline in procedure/function parameter list
         * new line in PUBLICATION and POLICY DDL
         * keep enumeration in GROUP BY clause on a single line

       Expect this list grow following alternative thoughts.

   <b>Option</b> <b>-g,</b> <b>--nogrouping</b>
       By default pgFormatter groups all statements when they are in a transaction:

           BEGIN;
           INSERT INTO foo VALUES (1, 'text 1');
           INSERT INTO foo VALUES (2, 'text 2');
           ...
           COMMIT;

       By disabling grouping of statement pgFormatter will always add an extra newline characters between
       statements just like outside a transaction:

           BEGIN;

           INSERT INTO foo VALUES (1, 'text 1');

           INSERT INTO foo VALUES (2, 'text 2');
           ...

           COMMIT;

       This might add readability to not DML transactions.

   <b>Option</b> <b>-L,</b> <b>--no-extra-line</b>
       By default pgFormatter always adds an empty line after the end of a statement when it is terminated by a
       ; except in a plpgsql code block.  If the extra empty line at end of the output is useless, you can
       remove it by adding this option to the command line.

   <b>Option</b> <b>--extra-function</b>
       pgFormatter applies some formatting to the PostgreSQL internal functions call but it can not detect user
       defined function. It is possible to defined a list of functions into a file (one function name per line)
       and give it to pgFormatter through the --extra-function option that will be formatter as PostgreSQL
       internal functions.

   <b>Option</b> <b>--extra-keyword</b>
       pgFormatter applies some formatting to the PostgreSQL internal keywords but it can not detect keywords
       for other database. It is possible to defined a list of keywords into a file (one keyword per line) and
       give it to pgFormatter through the --extra-keyword option that will be formatter as PostgreSQL internal
       functions.

       You can also pass a special value 'redshift' that will load the keywords defined internally in
       pgFormatter for this database. This was historically possible through the -r | --redshift option that is
       now obsolete and will be removed in the future.

   <b>Option</b> <b>--no-space-function</b>
       Use this option to remove the space character between a function call and the open parenthesis that
       follow. By default pgFormatter adds a space character, for example:

           DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS app_public.hello (a text);

       When this option is used the resulting query is formatted as follow:

           DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS app_public.hello(a text);

   <b>Option</b> <b>--redundant-parenthesis</b>
       By default, pgFormatter tries to remove redundant parenthesis in DML but in some cases they must be
       preseved. Using this option will keep redundant parenthesis untouched.

</pre><h4><b>HINTS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Configuration</b>
       If the default settings of pg_format doesn't fit all your needs you can customize the behavior of
       pg_format by using a configuration file instead of repeating the command line option. By default
       pgFormatter look for files ./.pg_format or $HOME/.pg_format or $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/pg_format/pg_format.conf
       if they exists but you can choose an alternate configuration file using command line option -c | --config

       To customize the CGI pg_format.cgi look for a configuration file named pg_format.conf in the same
       directory as the CGI script.

       For a sample configuration file see doc/pg_format.conf.sample

       To prevent pg_format to look at $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/pg_format or $HOME/.pg_format files you can use the
       command line option -X | --no-rcfile

   <b>Formatting</b> <b>from</b> <b>stdin</b>
       You can execute pg_format without any argument or - to give the SQL code to format through stdin.

       If you use the interactive mode you have to type `ctrl+d` after typing your SQL statement to format to
       end the typing.

               $ pg_format
               select * from customers;
               &lt; ctrl+d &gt;

       You can use stdin in a one liner as follow:

               echo "select * from customers;" | pg_format

   <b>Formatting</b> <b>from</b> <b>VI</b>
       With pgFormatter, you can just add the following line to your <a href="file:~/.vimrc">~/.vimrc</a> file:

               au FileType sql setl formatprg=/usr/local/bin/pg_format\ -

       This lets your gq commands use pgFormatter automagically. For example if you are on the first line,
       typing:

               ESC+gq+G

       will format the entire file.

               ESC+gq+2j

       will format the next two line.

       Thanks to David Fetter for the hint.

       There is also the (Neo)vim plugin for formatting code for many file types that support pg_format to
       format SQL file type.  Thanks to Anders Riutta for the patch to (Neo)vim.

   <b>Formatting</b> <b>from</b> <b>Atom</b>
       If you use atom as your favorite editor you can install the pg-formatter package which is a Node.js
       wrapper of pgFormatter.

       Features:

         * Format selected text or a whole file via keyboard shortcut or command.
         * Format SQL files on save.

       Installation:

       Search for pg-formatter in Atom UI or get it via command line:

           apm install pg-formatter

       Usage:

       Hit Ctrl-Alt-F to format selected text (or a whole file) or define your shortcut:

           'ctrl-alt-p': 'pg-formatter:format'

       Also, you can automatically format SQL files on save (disabled by default).

       You can download the package from url:

               https://atom.io/packages/pg-formatter

       the sources are available at https://github.com/gajus/pg-formatter

       Thanks to Alex Fedoseev for the atom package.

   <b>Formatting</b> <b>from</b> <b>Visual</b> <b>Studio</b>
       Thanks to Brady Holt a Visual Studio Code extension is available to formats PostgresSQL SQL using
       pgFormatter.

               https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradymholt.pgformatter

       For installation and use have a look at URL above.

   <b>Prevent</b> <b>replacing</b> <b>code</b> <b>snippets</b>
       Using -p or --placeholder command line option it is possible to keep code untouched by pgFormatter in
       your SQL queries. For example, in query like:

               SELECT * FROM projects WHERE projectnumber
                       IN &lt;&lt;internalprojects&gt;&gt; AND username = &lt;&lt;loginname&gt;&gt;;

       you may want pgFormatter to not interpret &lt;&lt; and &gt;&gt; as bit-shift keywords and modify your code snippets.
       You can use a Perl regular expression to instruct pgFormatter to keep some part of the query untouched.
       For example:

               pg_format samples/ex9.sql -p '&lt;&lt;(?:.*)?&gt;&gt;'

       will not format the bit-shift like operators.

       If you would like to wrap queries after 60 characters (-w 60) and to apply that limit to comments as well
       (-C), then urls in comments may get wrapped. If you would prefer not to wrap urls, you can use a regular
       expression to avoid wrapping urls.  For example:

               pg_format samples/ex62.sql -C -w 60 -p 'https?:\/\/(www\.)?[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\+~#=]{1,256}\.[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6}\b([-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\+.~#?&amp;//=]*)'

       will wrap the queries and the comments, but not the urls.

   <b>Prevent</b> <b>dynamic</b> <b>code</b> <b>formatting</b>
       By default pgFormatter takes all code between single quote as string constant and do not perform any
       formatting on this code. It is common to use a string as code separator to avoid doubling single quote in
       dynamic code generation, in this case pgFormatter can fail to auto detect the code separator. By default
       it will search for any string after the EXECUTE keyword starting with dollar sign. If it can not auto
       detect your code separator you can use the command line option -S or --separator to set the code
       separator that must be used.

   <b>Node.js</b> <b>thin-wrapper</b>
       Gajus Kuizinas has written a Node.js wrapper for executing pgFormatter.  You can find it at
       https://github.com/gajus/pg-formatter

   <b>Customize</b> <b>CSS</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>CGI</b> <b>output</b>
       You can change the HTML style rendered through the default CSS style by creating a file named
       custom_css_file.css into the pgFormatter CGI script directory. The default CSS will be fully overridden
       by this custom file content. You have to look at the generated HTML output to get the default CSS code
       used.

   <b>Using</b> <b>pgFormatter</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>API</b>
       You may use pgFormatter as an API by setting the 'Accept' HTTP header to value 'application/json' when
       calling it as a CGI app. In case you do not want to enable this feature, set "$self-&gt;{ 'enable_api' } =
       0" in the "set_config" sub of lib/pgFormatter/CGI.pm.
