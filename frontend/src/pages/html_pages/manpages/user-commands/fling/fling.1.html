</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       fling - quickly copy stdin over trusted network

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>fling</b> [<b>-vp</b>] <u>host</u> <u>port</u> ®.br <b>fling</b> [<b>-vp</b>] [<u>user@</u>]<u>host:/path/to/output</u> ®.br <b>fling</b> [<b>-vp</b>] <b>-r</b> <u>port</u> <b>&gt;output</b>
       <b>fling</b> [<b>-vp</b>] <b>-r</b> <u>port</u> <b>-o</b><u>output</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>fling</b>  transfers  data  quickly over a trusted network.  It does not encrypt the data.  It tries to avoid
       copying data between kernel and userspace where it can; you will see  the  most  improvement  over  other
       tools like netcat on systems with low memory bandwidth.

       The input is read from stdin, which can be a file or a pipe.

       <b>fling</b> needs to be installed on both ends of the transfer.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-r</b>     Receive instead of sending.  The received file is written by default to stdout.

       <b>-v</b>     Be more verbose about what's happening.

       <b>-p</b>     Report progress during transfer.

       <b>-o</b>     Specify output file when receiving to be used instead of stdout.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLE</b></h4><pre>
       You need to run fling on both ends of the transfer.  Run it first on the receiver:

              fling -r 12756 &gt; file.dat

       Alternatively, you can run this to set the output file with an option:

              fling -r 12756 -o file.dat

       And then on the sender:

              fling other.host.address 12756 &lt; file.dat

       You can also use the <u>experimental</u> support for ssh, and have <b>fling</b> run itself on the remote end, picking a
       port  automatically.   This  avoids  having to start it manually, in a different terminal.  Note that the
       actual transfer is insecure and doesn't go via ssh.

              fling other.host:data &lt; data

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>FLING_REMOTE_EXE</b>
              Name of command on the remote end for <b>fling</b> itself.  Should include full path  if  not  found  via
              PATH.

       <b>FLING_SSH</b>
              Name of command locally to use ssh.  Defaults to "ssh" if not set.

   <b>NOTES</b>
       The SSH support in fling is experimental.  It may have bugs.

       Note  that  ssh  is only used to set up the connection between the sending fling and the receiving fling.
       The actual connection through which data is transferred is still a separate cleartext connection.

       You should not use fling if you mind that data is transferred over an unencrypted  channel,  or  that  an
       attacker may modify data as it is transferred.  fling aims to be fast, not secure.

                                                                                                        <u><a href="../man1/FLING.1.html">FLING</a></u>(1)
