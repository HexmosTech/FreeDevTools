       cfgmaker - Creates mrtg.cfg files (for mrtg-2.17.10)

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       cfgmaker [options] [community@]router [[options] [community@]router ...]

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
        --ifref=name      interface references by Interface Name (default)
        --ifref=ip                         ... by Ip Address
        --ifref=eth                        ... by Ethernet Number
        --ifref=descr                      ... by Interface Description
        --ifref=nr                         ... by Interface Number
        --ifref=type                       ... by Interface Type
                       You may also use multiple options separated by commas,
                      in which case the first available one is used:
                      e.g.  --ifref=ip,name,nr

        --ifdesc=nr       interface description uses Interface Number (default)
        --ifdesc=ip                        ... uses Ip Address
        --ifdesc=eth                       ... uses Ethernet Number
        --ifdesc=descr                     ... uses Interface Description
        --ifdesc=name                      ... uses Interface Name
        --ifdesc=catname                   ... uses CatOS Interface Name
        --ifdesc=ppname                    ... uses Passport Port Name
        --ifdesc=alias                     ... uses Interface Alias
        --ifdesc=type                      ... uses Interface Type
                       You may also use multiple options separated by commas,
                      in which case the first available one is used:
                      e.g.  --ifdesc=catname,ppname,descr,alias,ip,name,nr

        --if-filter=f     Test every interface against filter f to decide whether
                          or not to include that interface into the collection.
                          Currently f is being evaluated as a Perl expression
                          and it's truth value is used to reject or accept the
                          interface.
                          (Experimental, under development, might change)

        --if-template=templatefile
                          Replace the normal target entries for the interfaces
                          with an entry as specified by the contents in the file
                          templatefile.  The file is supposed to contain Perl
                          code to be executed to generate the lines for the
                          target in the configuration file.
                          (Experimental, under development, might change)

        --host-template=templatefile
                          In addition to creating targets for a host's interfaces
                          do also create targets for the host itself as specified
                          by the contents in the file templatefile.  The file is
                          supposed to contain Perl code to be executed to generate
                          the lines for the host related targets (such as CPU,
                          ping response time measurements etc.) in the config-
                          uration file.
                          (Experimental, under development, might change)

        --global "x: a"   add global config entries

        --nodefaultglobal do not include default global settings

        --no-down         do not look at admin or opr status of interfaces

        --show-op-down    show interfaces which are operatively down

        --zero-speed=spd  use this speed in bits-per-second as the interface
                          speed for all interfaces that return a speed of 0
                          via ifSpeed/ifHighSpeed.  100Mbps = 100000000

        --subdirs=format  give each router its own subdirectory, naming each per
                          "format", in which HOSTNAME and SNMPNAME will be
                          replaced by the values of those items -- for instance,
                          --subdirs=HOSTNAME or --subdirs="HOSTNAME (SNMPNAME)"

        --noreversedns    do not reverse lookup ip numbers

        --community=cmty  Set the default community string to "cmty" instead of
                          "public".

        --enable-ipv6     Enable IPv6 support, if the required libraries are
                          present. Numeric IPv6 addresses must be enclosed
                          in square brackets, e.g. public@[2001:760:4::1]:161

        --use-16bit       Use 16bit SNMP request IDs to query all routers.

        --snmp-options=:[&lt;port&gt;][:[&lt;tmout&gt;][:[&lt;retr&gt;][:[&lt;backoff&gt;][:&lt;ver&gt;]]]]

                          Specify default SNMP options to be appended to all
                          routers following.  Individual fields can be empty.
                          Routers following might override some or all of the
                  options given to --snmp-options.

        --dns-domain=domain
                  Specifies a domain to append to the name of all
                  routers following.

        --nointerfaces    Don't do generate any configuration lines for interfaces,
                          skip the step of gathering interface information and
                          don't run any interface template code.

        --interfaces      Generate configuration lines for interfaces (this is the
                          default).  The main purpose of this option is to negate
                          an --nointerfaces appearing earlier on the command line.

        --help            brief help message
        --man             full documentation
        --version         print the version of cfgmaker

        --output=file     output filename default is STDOUT

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Cfgmaker</b> creates MRTG configuration files based on information pulled from a router or another SNMP
       manageable device.

       [<u>community</u><b>@</b>]<u>router</u>

       <u>Community</u> is the community name of the device you want to create a configuration for. If not specified,
       it defaults to '<b>public</b>'; you might want to try this first if you do not know the community name of a
       device. If you are using the wrong community name you will get no response from the device.

       <u>Router</u> is the DNS name or the IP number of an SNMP-manageable device.  Following the name you can specify
       6 further options separated by colons.  The full syntax looks like this:

       <b>router</b>[:[<b>prt</b>][:[<b>tmout</b>][:[<b>retr</b>][:[<b>backoff</b>][:<b>vers</b>]]]]]

       Of special interest may be the last parameter, <b>vers</b>.  If you set this to '2' then your device will be
       queried with SNMP version 2 requests. This allows you to poll the 64 bit traffic counters in the device
       and will thus work much better with fast interfaces (no more counter overrun).  Note that the order in
       which the routers are specified on the command line do matter as the same order is used when the
       configuration file is generated.  The first specified router has it's configuration lines generated
       first, followed by the lines belonging to the next router and so on.

       Note that the first line of the generated cfg file will contain all the commandline options you used for
       generating it. This is to allow for the easy 'regeneration' in case you want to add newhosts or make some
       other global change.

   <b>Configuration</b>
       Except for the <b>--output</b> and <b>--global</b> options, all options affect only the routers following them on the
       command line.  If an option specified earlier on the command line reappears later on the command line
       with another value, the new value overrides the old value as far as remaining routers are concerned.
       This way options might be tailored for groups of routers or for individual routers.

       See <b>--output</b> and <b>--global</b> for how their behaviour is affected by where or how many times they appear on
       the command line.

       See the <b>Examples</b> below on how to set an option differently for multiple routers.

       <b>--help</b>
           Print a brief help message and exit.

       <b>--man</b>
           Prints the manual page and exits.

       <b>--version</b>
           Print  the  version  of  cfgmaker.   This should match the version of MRTG for which config files are
           being created.

       <b>--ifref</b> <b>nr</b>|<b>ip</b>|<b>eth</b>|<b>descr</b>|<b>name</b>
           Select the interface identification method.  Default is <b>nr</b> which identifies the router interfaces  by
           their  number.  Unfortunately the interface numbering scheme in an SNMP tree can change. Some routers
           change their numbering when new interfaces are added, others change their numbering every  full  moon
           just for fun.

           To  work  around  this  sad problem MRTG can identify interfaces by 4 other properties. None of these
           works for all interfaces, but you should be able to find one which  does  fine  for  you.  Note  that
           especially  ethernet  addresses  can be problematic as some routers have the same ethernet address on
           most of their interface cards.

           Select <b>ip</b> to identify the interface by its IP number.  Use  <b>eth</b>  to  use  the  ethernet  address  for
           identification. Use <b>descr</b> to use the Interface description. Or use <b>name</b> to use the Interface name.

           You  can  specify  multiple properties if you wish, separated by commas.  In this case, cfgmaker will
           use the first item in the list which can provide unique identification.  This allows you to  specify,
           for example, to use IP address and to use ifName if this is not defined:
             --ifref ip,name

           If  your chosen method does not allow unique interface identification on the device you are querying,
           <b>cfgmaker</b> will tell you about it.

       <b>--ifdesc</b> <b>nr</b>|<b>ip</b>|<b>eth</b>|<b>descr</b>|<b>name</b>|<b>type</b>|<b>alias</b>
           Select what to use as the description of the interface.  The description  appears  in  the  "Title[]"
           property  for  the  target  as  well  as  the  text  header  in the HTML code defined in the target's
           "PageTop[]".  Default is to use <b>nr</b> which is just the interface number which isn't  always  useful  to
           the viewer of the graphs.

           There  are  6  other  properties  which could be used.  Use <b>ip</b> if you want to use the interface's IP-
           address.  Use <b>eth</b> if you want to use  the  interface's  ethernet  address.   If  you  want  a  better
           description,  you  can use either <b>descr</b>, <b>name</b> or <b>alias</b>.  Exactly what each of these do varies between
           different equipment so you might need to experiment.  For instance, for a serial interface on a Cisco
           router running IOS using <b>name</b> might result in "S0" being the  interface  description  ,  <b>descr</b>  might
           result  in  "Serial0"  and  <b>alias</b>  might result in "Link to HQ" (provided that is what is used as the
           interface's "description" in the router's configuration).

           Finally, if you want to describe the interface by it's Btype (i.e "ethernetCSMA",  "propPointtoPoint"
           etc) you can use <b>type</b>.

           You  can  specify  multiple properties if you wish, separated by commas.  In this case, cfgmaker will
           use the first item in the list which is available for this interface.  This allows  you  to  specify,
           for example, to use any of the different aliases in order of preference.

       <b>--if-filter</b> '<b>filter-expression</b>'
           First of all, this is under some development and is experimental.

           Use  this  if  you  want  to  have  better  control  over  what  interfaces  gets  included  into the
           configuration.  The <b>filter-expression</b> is evaluated as a piece of Perl code and is expected to  return
           a truth value.  If true, include the interface and if false, exclude the interface.

           For a further discussion on how these filters work, see the section "Details on Filters" below.

       <b>--if-template</b> <b>template-file</b>
           First of all, this is under some development and is experimental.

           Use  this  if you want to control what the line for each target should look like in the configuration
           file.  The contents of the file <b>template-file</b> will be evaluated as a Perl program which generates the
           lines using certain variables for input and output.

           For a further discussion on how these templates work, see the section "Details on Templates" below.

       <b>--host-template</b> <b>template-file</b>
           First of all, this is under some development and is experimental.

           Use this if you want to have some extra targets related to the host itself such as  CPU  utilization,
           ping  response  time  to the host, number of busy modems etc.  The contents of the file <b>template-file</b>
           will be evaluated once per host as a Perl program which generates the lines using  certain  variables
           for input and output.

           For a further discussion on how these templates work, see the section "Details on Templates" below.

       <b>--community</b> <b>community-string</b>
           Use  this  to  set  the  community for the routers following on the command line to <b>community-string</b>.
           Individual routers might override this community string by using the syntax <b>community@router</b>.

       <b>--enable-ipv6</b>
           This option enables IPv6 support. It requires the appropriate perl modules; if  they  are  not  found
           then IPv6 is disabled (see the ipv6 documentation).

           cfgmaker  will  use  IPv6  or  IPv4  depending on the target. If the target is a numeric address, the
           protocol depends on the type of address. If the target is a hostname, cfgmaker will  try  to  resolve
           the name first to an IPv6 address then to an IPv4 address.

           IPv6 numeric addresses must be specified between square braces.

           For example:

            cfgmaker --enable-ipv6 [2001:760:4::1]:165:::2

           If  the  target  has  both an IPv6 address and an IPv4 address with the same hostname, cfgmaker first
           queries the target using IPv6 and falls back to IPv4 if it fails. This is useful  for  targets  which
           don't support SNMP over IPv6.

       <b>--use-16bit</b>
           This  option  forces  the use of 16bit SNMP request IDs.  Some broken SNMP agents do not accept 32bit
           request IDs.  Try to avoid this option as much as possible, complain to your agent vendor instead.

       <b>--snmp-options</b>  :[<b>port</b>][:[<b>timeout</b>][:[<b>retries</b>][:[<b>backoff</b>][:<b>version</b>]]]]
           Use this to set the default SNMP options for all routers following on the command  line.   Individual
           values  might be omitted as well as trailing colons.  Note that routers might override individual (or
           all) values specified by <b>--snmp-options</b> by using the syntax

           <b>router</b>[:[<b>port</b>][:[<b>timeout</b>][:[<b>retries</b>][:[<b>backoff</b>][:<b>version</b>]]]]]

       <b>--global</b> <b>"</b><u>bla:</u> <u>abc</u><b>"</b>
           Use this to add global options to the generated config file.  You can call <b>--global</b> several times  to
           add  multiple options.  The line will appear in the configuration just before the config for the next
           router appearing on the command line.

            --global "workdir: /home/mrtg"

           If you want some default Options you might want to put

            --global "options[_]: growright,bits"

           Specifying <b>--global</b> after the last router on the command line will create a line in the configuration
           file which will appear after all the routers.

       <b>--noreversedns</b>
           Do not try to reverse lookup IP numbers ... a must for DNS free environments.

       <b>--no-down</b>
           Normally cfgmaker will not include interfaces which are  marked  anything  but  administratively  and
           operationally UP. With this switch you get them all.

       <b>--show-op-down</b>
           Include interfaces which are operatively down.

       <b>--zero-speed</b> <u>speed</u>
           Assign  this  speed  in bits-per-second to all interfaces which return 0 for ifSpeed and ifHighSpeed.
           Some switches, notably Foundry equipment, return a speed of zero for some interfaces.   For  example,
           to have all interfaces reporting zero set to 100Mbps, use --zero-speed=100000000.

       <b>--subdirs</b> <u>format</u>
           Give  each router its own subdirectory for the HTML and graphics (or .rrd) files.  The directory name
           is the given <u>format</u> string with a couple of pattern replacements.   The  string  "HOSTNAME"  will  be
           replaced  by  the  hostname of the router (however you specified it on the <b>cfgmaker</b> commandline -- it
           may be an actual hostname or just an IP address), and "SNMPNAME" will be replaced with  the  device's
           idea  of  its  own  name  (the  same  name that appears on the right side of the "Title" lines).  For
           instance, a call like:

            cfgmaker --subdirs=HOSTNAME__SNMPNAME <a href="mailto:public@10.10.0.18">public@10.10.0.18</a>

           would result in the generation of lines looking something like:

            Directory[10.10.0.18_1]: 10.10.0.18__fp2200-bothrip-1.3

       <b>--output</b> <u>file</u>
           Write the output from <b>cfgmaker</b> into the file <u>file</u>. The  default  is  to  use  "STDOUT".  <b>--output</b>  is
           expected  to  appear only once on the command line. If used multiple times, the file specified by the
           last <b>--output</b> will be used.

       <b>--nointerfaces</b>
           Don't generate configuration lines for interfaces.

           This makes cfgmaker skip all steps related to interfaces which means it will not do  any  polling  of
           the  router  to  retrieve interface information which speeds up the execution of cfgmaker and it will
           neither run any interface templates.

       <b>--interfaces</b>
           This makes cfgmaker generate configuration lines for interfaces (the default behaviour).

           The main usage of this option is to negate an --nointerfaces appearing earlier on the command line.

   <b>SNMP</b> <b>V3</b> <b>Options</b>
       <b>Cfgmaker</b> supports SNMP V3 using the <b>Net:SNMP</b> perl module.  There are optional parameters  affecting  SNMP
       operation.

       --enablesnmpv3 {yes|no}
           The  <b>--enablesnmpv3</b>  option is an optional flag to check for the presence of the <b>Net::SNMP</b> libraries.
           <b>Cfgmaker</b> will try to determine whether this flag is required and will set the values automatically.

       <u>SNMPv3</u> <u>Arguments</u>

       A SNMP context is a collection of management information  accessible  by  a  SNMP  entity.   An  item  of
       management  information  may  exist  in more than one context and a SNMP entity potentially has access to
       many contexts.  The combination of a contextEngineID and a contextName unambiguously identifies a context
       within an administrative domain.  In a SNMPv3 message, the contextEngineID and contextName  are  included
       as  part  of the scopedPDU.  All methods that generate a SNMP message optionally take a <b>--contextengineid</b>
       and <b>--contextname</b> argument to configure these fields.

       Context Engine ID
           The <b>--contextengineid</b> argument expects a hexadecimal string representing the desired contextEngineID.
           The string must be 10 to 64 characters (5 to 32 octets) long and can be  prefixed  with  an  optional
           "0x".   Once the <b>--contextengineid</b> is specified it stays with the object until it is changed again or
           reset to default by passing in the undefined value.  By default, the contextEngineID is set to  match
           the authoritativeEngineID of the authoritative SNMP engine.

       Context Name
           The  contextName is passed as a string which must be 0 to 32 octets in length using the <b>--contextname</b>
           argument.  The contextName stays with the object until it is changed.  The contextName defaults to an
           empty string which represents the "default" context.

       <u>User-based</u> <u>Security</u> <u>Model</u> <u>Arguments</u>

       The User-based Security Model (USM) used by SNMPv3 requires that a securityName be  specified  using  the
       <b>--username</b>  argument.  The creation of a Net::SNMP object with the version set to SNMPv3 will fail if the
       <b>--username</b> argument is not present.  The <b>--username</b> argument expects a string 1 to 32 octets in length.

       Different levels of security are allowed by the User-based Security Model  which  address  authentication
       and  privacy  concerns.  A SNMPv3 target will derive the security level (securityLevel) based on which of
       the following arguments are specified.

       By default a securityLevel of 'noAuthNoPriv' is assumed.  If the <b>--authkey</b>  or  <b>--authpassword</b>  arguments
       are  specified,  the  securityLevel  becomes  'authNoPriv'.  The <b>--authpassword</b> argument expects a string
       which is at least 1 octet in length.  Optionally, the <b>--authkey</b> argument can be used so that a plain text
       password does not have to be specified in a script.  The <b>--authkey</b> argument expects a hexadecimal  string
       produced  by  localizing the password with the authoritativeEngineID for the specific destination device.
       The "snmpkey" utility included with the Net::SNMP  distribution can be used  to  create  the  hexadecimal
       string (see snmpkey).

       Two  different  hash  algorithms  are  defined  by  SNMPv3  which  can  be used by the Security Model for
       authentication.  These algorithms are HMAC-MD5-96 "MD5" (RFC 1321) and HMAC-SHA-96 "SHA-1" (NIST FIPS PUB
       180-1).   The default algorithm used by the module is HMAC-MD5-96.  This behavior can be changed by using
       the <b>--authprotocol</b> argument.  This argument expects either the string 'md5' or  'sha'  to  be  passed  to
       modify the hash algorithm.

       By  specifying  the  arguments  <b>--privkey</b>  or <b>--privpassword</b> the securityLevel associated with the object
       becomes 'authPriv'.  According to SNMPv3, privacy requires the  use  of  authentication.   Therefore,  if
       either  of these two arguments are present and the <b>--authkey</b> or <b>--authpassword</b> arguments are missing, the
       creation of the object fails.  The <b>--privkey</b> and <b>--privpassword</b> arguments expect the same  input  as  the
       <b>--authkey</b> and <b>--authpassword</b> arguments respectively.

       The  User-based  Security Model described in RFC 3414 defines a single encryption protocol to be used for
       privacy.  This protocol, CBC-DES "DES" (NIST FIPS PUB 46-1), is used by default or if the string 'des' is
       passed to the <b>--privprotocol</b>  argument.   By  working  with  the  Extended  Security  Options  Consortium
       <a href="http://www.snmp.com/eso/">http://www.snmp.com/eso/</a>,  the module also supports additional protocols which have been defined in draft
       specifications.  The  draft  <a href="http://www.snmp.com/eso/draft-reeder-snmpv3-usm-3desede-00.txt">http://www.snmp.com/eso/draft-reeder-snmpv3-usm-3desede-00.txt</a>  defines  the
       support  of  CBC-3DES-EDE  "Triple-DES" (NIST FIPS 46-3) in the User-based Security Model.  This protocol
       can  be  selected  using  the  <b>--privprotocol</b>  argument   with   the   string   '3desede'.    The   draft
       <a href="http://www.snmp.com/eso/draft-blumenthal-aes-usm-04.txt">http://www.snmp.com/eso/draft-blumenthal-aes-usm-04.txt</a> describes the use of CFB128-AES-128/192/256 "AES"
       (NIST  FIPS  PUB  197) in the USM. The three AES encryption protocols, differentiated by their key sizes,
       can be selected by passing 'aescfb128', 'aescfb192', or 'aescfb256' to the <b>-privprotocol</b> argument.

   <b>Details</b> <b>on</b> <b>Filters</b>
       The purpose of the filters is to decide which interfaces to accept and which interfaces to reject.   This
       decision  is  done  for  each  interface  by evaluating the filter expression as a piece of Perl code and
       investigating the result of the evaluation.  If true, accept the interface otherwise reject it.

       When working with filters, remember that Perl has it's own idea of what truth and false  is.   The  empty
       string  ""  and  the  string  "0"  are  false, all other strings are true.  This further implies that any
       integer value of 0 is false as well as any  undef  value.   It  also  implies  that  all  references  are
       considered true.

       As the filter is evaluated as a Perl expression, several useful constructs in Perl are worth mentioning:

       Expressions  might  be  grouped  by  using parentheses "()".  Expressions might be combined using boolean
       operators such as the following:

       "<b>and</b>" (equivalent with "<b>&amp;&amp;</b>")
           Boolean "and" of the  two  expressions,  is  only  true  if  both  expressions  are  true.   Example:
           <u>expression1</u> <b>and</b> <u>expression2</u>

       "<b>or</b>" (equivalent with "<b>||</b>")
           Boolean  "or"  of  the  two  expressions,  is  true if either or both expressions are true.  Example:
           <u>expression1</u> <b>or</b> <u>expression2</u>

       "<b>not</b>" (equivalent with "<b>!</b>")
           Boolean negation  of  a  single  expression.   Example:   <b>not</b>  <u>expression</u>  .   Yet  another  example:
           <b>!</b><u>expression</u>

       (For more details on this I recommend a book on Perl)

       <u>Predefined</u> <u>Filter</u> <u>Variables</u>

       To  facilitate,  there are a number of predefined values available to use in the filter.  Note that these
       variables are also available when templates interfaces are evaluated (but not host templates).

       Caveat:  All these variables' names begin with a dollar sign  ($), which is a syntactic  requirement  for
       scalar  variables in Perl.  The danger here is that the dollar sign in many shells is an active character
       (often used for shell variables exactly as in Perl variables) so it is important to ensure that the  Perl
       expression  isn't  evaluated  by  the command line shell as shell code before being passed to cfgmaker as
       command line arguments.  In shells like Bourne shell,  ksh  shell  or  bash  shell,  placing  the  entire
       expression within single quotes will avoid such accidental evaluation:

        '--if-filter=($default_iftype &amp;&amp; $if_admin)'

       <b>$if_type</b>
           This  is  an  integer  specifying the interface type as per the SNMP standards and as reported by the
           polled device.  A complete list of interface types would be impractical for this document , but there
           are a number predefined variables below.  Normally, cfgmaker puts in the target's PageTop this iftype
           value within parenthesis after the name of the interface type. (e.g "propPointToPointSerial (22)").

           Here's a list of some of the most common interface types by number:

            134 ATM Sub Interface

       <b>$default</b>
           True if and only if  cfgmaker  normally  should  accepted  the  interface  based  on  the  interfaces
           administrative and operational state (taking the flags <b>--no-down</b> and <b>--show-op-down</b> into account) and
           it's type (and a few other things).

       <b>$default_ifstate</b>
           True  if  and  only  if  cfgmaker  would  have  accepted  the interface based on it's operational and
           administrative  states  (also  taking  into  account  the  presence  of  the  flags   <b>--no-down</b>   and
           <b>--show-op-down</b>).

       <b>$default_iftype</b>
           True  if  and  only  if cfgmaker would have accepted the interface based on it's type (and a few type
           specific details in addition).

       <b>$if_admin</b>
           True if and only if the interface is in an administrative up state.

       <b>$if_oper</b>
           True if and only if the interface is in an operational up state.

       A number of variables are also predefined to easily decide if an interface belong to a  certain  category
       or  not.   Below  is all those variables listed together with which if_type numbers each variable will be
       true for.  Note that some variables refer to other variables as well.

       <b>$if_is_ethernet</b>
           True for ethernet interfaces (nr 6, 7, 26, 62, 69 and 117).

       <b>$if_is_isdn</b>
           True for various ISDN interface types (nr 20, 21, 63, 75, 76 and 77)

       <b>$if_is_dialup</b>
           True for dial-up interfaces such as PPP as well as ISDN.  (nr 23, 81, 82 and 108 in addition  to  the
           numbers of <b>$if_is_isdn</b>).

       <b>$if_is_atm</b>
           True for miscellaneous ATM related interface types (nr 37, 49, 107, 105, 106, 114 and 134).

       <b>$if_is_wan</b>
           True for WAN interfaces point to point, Frame Relay and High Speed Serial ( 22,32,44,46)

       <b>$if_is_lan</b>
           True  for  LAN  interfaces  (8,  9,  11,  15,  26,  55,  59, 60 and 115 in addition to the numbers of
           <b>$if_is_ethernet</b>).

       <b>$if_is_dsl</b>
           True for ADSL, RDSL, HDSL and SDSL (nr 94, 95, 96, 97)

       <b>$if_is_loopback</b>
           True for software loopback interfaces (nr 24)

       <b>$if_is_ciscovlan</b>
           True for Cisco VLAN interfaces (interfaces with the word Vlan or VLAN in their ifdescs)

       <b>$if_vlan_id</b>
           Returns the vlan id associated with a specific port on Cisco Catalyst switches under both Catalyst OS
           and IOS, and 3Com switches.  If it is not a vlan interface, will return undef.

       <b>$if_cisco_trunk</b>
           Returns the trunking state of a specific port on Cisco Catalyst switches under both Catalyst  OS  and
           IOS.  Returns "1" if the interface is a trunk, undef otherwise.

       <b>$if_MTU</b>
           Returns the Maximum Transfer Unit associated with a specific port.

       Besides  that,  you  can  also use the variables defined for templates below.  Further, all the variables
       available in cfgmaker is at the scripts disposal even if the use of such features is  discouraged.   More
       "shortcuts" in the form of variables and functions will be made available in the future instead.

       <u>Examples</u> <u>on</u> <u>Filters</u>

       The  following  filter  will not affect which interfaces gets included or excluded, it will make cfgmaker
       behave as normally.

        '--if-filter=$default'

       The following filter will make cfgmaker exclude PPP (23) interfaces:

        '--if-filter=$default &amp;&amp; $if_type!=23'

       The following filter will make cfgmaker behave as usual except that  it  will  consider  the  operational
       state of an interface irrelevant but still reject all interfaces which are administratively down.

        '--if-filter=$if_admin &amp;&amp; $default_iftype'

   <b>Details</b> <b>on</b> <b>Templates</b>
       The  contents  of  the  template  files  are evaluated as a Perl program.  A number or Perl variables are
       available for the program to read and others are used to be written to.

       As quite a few of the predefined variables has values which are are supposed to be used in HTML code some
       of  them  have  an  "HTML-escaped"  variant,  e.g  $html_syslocation  is  the  HTML  escaped  variant  of
       $syslocation.  The HTML escaping means that the chars "&lt;", "&gt;" and "&amp;" are replaced by "&amp;lt;", "&amp;gt;" and
       "&amp;amp;"  and  that  newlines  embedded  in the string are prepended with "&lt;BR&gt;" and appended with a space
       character (if a newline is last in the string it is not touched).

       <u>Writable</u> <u>Template</u> <u>Variables</u>

       These are the variables available to store the configuration lines in.   Some  of  them  are  initialized
       prior  to the evaluation of the template but such content normally is comments for inclusion in the final
       configuration file so those variables might be reset  to  the  empty  string  in  the  template  code  to
       eliminate  the comments.  The other way around is also possible, the contents of these variables might be
       extended with further information for various reasons such as debugging etc.

       Once the template has been evaluated, the following happens:  if the template is a interface template and
       the actual interface for some reason is rejected and thus needs to be commented out, all the lines in the
       variable <b>$target_lines</b> are turned into comments by adding a hash mark ("#") at their beginning.  Then all
       the variables <b>$head_lines</b>, <b>$problem_lines</b> , <b>$target_lines</b> and <b>$separator_lines</b> are concatenated  together
       to form the lines to add to the configuration file.

       <b>$target_lines</b>
           This  variable is the placeholder for the configuration lines created by the template.  <b>$target_lines</b>
           is predefined to be empty when the template code is evaluated.

       <b>$head_lines</b>
           This variable is intended to be the placeholder for the comment line appearing just before the target
           in the configuration file.  It is initialized with that comment line before  the  evaluation  of  the
           template code and if the template doesn't modify <b>$head_lines</b> during evaluation, the comment will look
           like usual in the config file.

       <b>$problem_lines</b>
           This  variable  is  intended to be the placholder for the comment lines describing any problems which
           might have been encountered when trying to add the target into the configuration.  For host templates
           it's normally not used and for those it's predefined as the empty string.   For  interface  templates
           <b>$problem_lines</b>  is  predefined  with the error description comments which cfgmaker normally would use
           for rejected interfaces or as the empty string for accepted interfaces.

           It is possible to test against <b>$problem_lines</b> to find  out  if  an  interface  will  be  included  or
           rejected but this is not recommended.  Test against <b>$if_ok</b> instead.

       <b>$separator_lines</b>
           This  variable  is  the  placeholder  for  the  string  to  use as the separator between the code for
           individual targets.  The contents of this variable is put after each target (so the lines will appear
           after the end of the last target in the config as well).

       <u>Predefined</u> <u>Template</u> <u>Variables</u>

       All the variables below are available for interface templates to use.  For  host  templates,  only  those
       listed under "Host and System Variables" are available.

       For interface templates the variables listed under "Predefined Filter Variables" are also available.

       <u>Host</u> <u>and</u> <u>System</u> <u>Variables</u>

       <b>$router_name</b>
           This  is  the  fully  qualified  name  for  the router.  It is affected by the following items on the
           command line:  the router name itself and <b>--dns-domain</b>.

       <b>$router_connect</b>
           This is the reference string for the router  being  polled.   It  is  on  the  form  community@router
           possibly  followed  by some snmp options.  It is affected by the following items on the command line:
           the router name itself, <b>--community</b>, <b>--snmp-options</b>  and  <b>--dns-domain</b>.   (There's  no  HTML  escaped
           variant available)

       <b>$directory_name</b>
           This  variable  should contain the directory name as cfgmaker normally would use as the value for the
           "Directory[]" directive.  The value is determined by the <b>--subdirs</b> command line option.  If <b>--subdirs</b>
           isn't specified <b>$directory_name</b>  will  be  the  empty  string.   (There's  no  HTML  escaped  variant
           available)

       <b>$syscontact</b>
           This variable is the router's SNMP sysContact value.  (HTML escaped variant: <b>$html_syscontact</b>)

       <b>$sysname</b>
           This variable is the router's SNMP sysName value.  (No HTML escaped variant available)

       <b>$syslocation</b>
           This variable is the router's SNMP sysLocation value.  (HTML escaped variant: <b>$html_syslocation</b>)

       <b>$sysdescr</b>
           This  variable is the router's SNMP sysDescr value.  It is normally not used by cfgmaker but might be
           useful in a template.  (HTML escaped variant: <b>$html_sysdescr</b>)

       <u>Interface</u> <u>Target</u> <u>Related</u> <u>Variables</u>

       <b>$target_name</b>
           This is what cfgmaker normally would use as the the name of the target.  The target name is  what  is
           found  within  the  square  brackets,  "[]", for target directives.  (There's no HTML escaped variant
           available)

       <b>$if_ref</b>
           This the reference string for the interface.   It  is  expected  to  be  used  in  the  "Target[xyz]"
           directive  to  distinguish  what  interface  to  use.   The value of this variable is affected by the
           <b>--ifref</b> command line option.  It is normally used together with <b>$router_connect</b>.   (There's  no  HTML
           escaped variant available)

       <b>$if_ok</b>
           This variable is true if the interface is going to be included into the configuration file, otherwise
           false.  Don't test against other variables such as <b>$problem_lines</b> to find out if an interface will be
           rejected or not, use this <b>$if_ok</b> instead.

       <b>$default_target_lines</b>
           This  variable  contains  all  the target lines which cfgmaker by default outputs for this interface.
           It's useful if you want to have the "standard target" but want to add some extra lines to it by using
           a template.

       By default cfgmaker uses the following directives for  each  target  it  generates:  Target[],  SetEnv[],
       MaxBytes[], Title[], PageTop[] and if there is any directory specified also the Directory[] directive.

       To  facilitate  the creation of templates which generates target configs which are similar to the default
       one, each of the above mentioned directive lines have a corresponding variable  containing  the  line  as
       cfgmaker would have output it by default.

       Note  that  none  of  these have a HTML escaped variant, text in them is HTML escaped where needed.  Also
       note that they do not have any newline at the end.

       <b>$default_target_directive</b>
           This variable contains the default string for the Target[] directive line.

       <b>$default_setenv_directive</b>
           This variable contains the default string for the SetEnv[] directive line.

       <b>$default_directory_directive</b>
           This variable contains the default string for the Directory[] directive line which  means  it  is  an
           empty string (with no newline) if there's no directory.

       <b>$default_maxbytes_directive</b>
           This variable contains the default string for the MaxBytes[] directive line.

       <b>$default_title_directive</b>
           This variable contains the default string for the Title[] directive line.

       <b>$default_pagetop_directive</b>
           This variable contains the default string for the PageTop[] directive lines.

       <u>Interface</u> <u>Network</u> <u>Configuration</u> <u>Variables</u>

       <b>$if_ip</b>
           This  variable  should  contain  the  IP-address  of  the  interface, if any has been assigned to it.
           (There's no HTML escaped variant available)

       <b>$ifindex</b>
           This variable is the SNMP ifIndex for the interface  which  per  definition  always  is  an  integer.
           (There's no HTML escaped variant available)

       <b>$if_index</b>
           Equivalent with <b>$ifindex</b>.

       <b>$if_eth</b>
           Contains the ethernet address of the interface, if any.  (There's no HTML escaped variant available)

       <b>$if_speed</b>
           This  variable  is  the  speed  in  bytes/second  (with  prefixes).  (There's no HTML escaped variant
           available)

       <b>$if_speed_str</b>
           This variable is a cooked speed description which is either in bits or bytes depending on whether  or
           not  the bits option is active and also with the proper prefix for the speed (k, M, G etc).  (No HTML
           escaped variant available)

       <b>$if_type_desc</b>
           This  variable  is  a  textual  description  of  the  interface   type.    (HTML   escaped   variant:
           <b>$html_if_type_desc</b>)

       <b>$if_type_num</b>
           This  variable the integer value corresponding to the interface type (for a listing for the value for
           the more common interface types, see the section DETAILS ON FILTERS above).  (No HTML escaped variant
           available)

       <b>$if_dns_name</b>
           This is the DNS name for the interface.  (No HTML escaped variant available)

       <u>Interface</u> <u>Name,</u> <u>Description</u> <u>and</u> <u>Alias</u> <u>Variables</u>

       It might seem confusing with both <u>Name</u>, <u>Description</u> and <u>Alias</u> in this context and to some extent  it  is.
       <u>Name</u>  and  <u>Description</u> are usually supported on most equipment but how they are used varies, both between
       manufacturers as well as between different categories of equipment from the same manufacturer.  The <u>Alias</u>
       is at least supported by Cisco IOS, and that variable contains whatever is  used  in  the  IOS  statement
       called "description" for the interface (not to be confused with the SNMP variables for <u>Description</u>).

       For  better  control  from  the command line consider <b>$if_title_desc</b> which contents are controlled by the
       <b>--if-descr</b> command line option.

       <b>$if_snmp_descr</b>
           This variable should contain the "raw" description of the interface as determined by the SNMP polling
           of the router.  (HTML escaped variant: <b>$html_if_snmp_descr</b>)

       <b>$if_snmp_name</b>
           The  "raw"  name  for  the  interface  as  provided  by  SNMP  polling.    (HTML   escaped   variant:
           <b>$html_if_snmp_name</b>)

       <b>$if_snmp_alias</b>
           The   "raw"  ifAlias  for  the  interface  as  provided  by  SNMP  polling.  (HTML  escaped  variant:
           <b>$html_if_snmp_alias</b>)

       <b>$if_cisco_descr</b>
           The "raw" CiscolocIfDescr for the interface as provided by  SNMP  polling.   (HTML  escaped  variant:
           <b>$html_if_cisco_descr</b>)

       <b>$if_description</b>
           This  is the "cooked" description string for the interface, taking into account the SNMP values found
           for   the   interface's   RDescr,   ifAlias   and   CiscolocIfDescr.     (HTML    escaped    variant:
           <b>$html_if_description</b>)

       <b>$if_title</b>
           The full string cfgmaker by default would have used for the Title[] directive in the configuration as
           well  as  the  content  of  the  topmost  H1  tag  in  the PageTop[].  Is composed by the contents of
           <b>$desc_prefix</b>, <b>$if_title_desc</b> and <b>$sysname</b>.

           As <b>$if_title</b> depends on <b>$if_title_desc</b>, it is possible to indirectly control <b>$if_title</b> by  using  the
           command line option <b>--if-descr</b>.

           (HTML escaped variant: <b>$html_if_title</b>)

       <b>$if_port_name</b>
           If the host is a Cisco Catalyst LAN switch, this variable is the name of that port.  (No HTML escaped
           variant available)

       <b>$if_pp_port_name</b>
           If  the  host  is  a  Nortel  Passport  LAN switch, this variable is the name of that port.  (No HTML
           escaped variant available)

       <b>$desc_prefix</b>
           This variable is a prefix of the description of what the target is to use in the "Title[]"  directive
           and  in  the  H1  section  of  the  "PageTop[]".   Default is "Traffic analysis for ".  (HTML escaped
           variant: <b>$html_desc_prefix</b>)

       <b>$if_title_desc</b>
           This is the description of the interface normally used by cfgmaker as part of the variable <b>$if_title</b>.
           The latter is used as the full string in the "Title[]" directive and the H1 section in the PageTop[].

           <b>$if_title_desc</b> is controlled by the command line option  <b>--if-descr</b>  which  indirectly  controls  the
           contents of <b>$if_title</b>

           (HTML escaped variant: <b>$html_if_title_desc</b>)

       <u>Help</u> <u>Functions</u> <u>for</u> <u>Templates</u>

       The following functions exists to facilitate the writing of host and interface templates.

       <b>html_escape(</b><u><b>string</b></u><b>)</b>
           <b>html_escape()</b>  takes  a  string  as  an  argument  and  returns  a  new  string  where  the following
           substitutions has been done:  the chars "&lt;", "&gt;" and "&amp;" are replaced by "&amp;lt;", "&amp;gt;"  and  "&amp;amp;"
           and  that  newlines  embedded  in  the  string  are  prepended  with "&lt;BR&gt;" and appended with a space
           character (newlines at the end of the string are not touched).

       <b>oid_pick($router_connect,$v3opt,"oid1","oid2"...)</b>
           This function will try to poll each of the oids specified until it is successful or has  run  out  of
           oids. It will return the name of the first oid that worked or undef if it is not successful

       Template Example 1: Eliminating Rejected Targets From Appearing

       This  template  file  generates  exactly  the  same  configuration code per interface as cfgmaker does by
       default, with the exception that it eliminates all lines  (comments  as  well  as  config  code)  for  an
       interface if the interface happens to be rejected.

       Example  1  was  partly  intended to demonstrate how to customize the generation of interface targets but
       also to provide a hint of how the variables are used in the "default" template which one  could  consider
       that cfgmaker normally uses.

       If  you're  only  interested  in  the  easiest  way  of entirely eliminating those reject interfaces, the

        ECHO

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       The first example creates a config file for <u>router.place.xyz</u>:  the router has the community name  <u>public</u>.
       Interfaces  get  identified  by  their  IP number.  Two global options get added to the config file.  The
       config file gets redirected to <u>mrtg.conf</u>.  The '\' signs at the end of the line mean  that  this  command
       should be written on a single line.

        cfgmaker --global "WorkDir: /home/tobi"           \
                 --global "Options[_]: growright,bits"    \
                 --ifref=ip                               \
                 <a href="mailto:public@router.place.xyz">public@router.place.xyz</a> &gt; mrtg.cfg

       Note:  if  cfgmaker  is  not in your path, but you are in the directory where cfgmaker is stored, you can
       start it with ./cfgmaker

       The  next  example  creates  a  config  file  for  four  devices:  <u>router1.place.xyz</u>,  <u>router2.place.xyz</u>,
       <u>switch1.place.xyz</u> and <u>switch2.place.xyz</u> all with the community <u>public</u>.

       The  two  routers  will  have  <b>--ifref</b> set to <b>descr</b> whilst the two switches will use <b>--ifref</b> set to <b>name</b>.
       Further the routers will use <b>--ifdesc</b> set to <b>alias</b> and <u>switch1.place.xyz</u> will use <b>--ifdesc</b> set  to  <b>descr</b>
       whilst <u>switch2.place.xyz</u> use <b>name</b> instead.

       Finally,  there  will  be  two Options lines inserted in the configuration: One will be in the beginning,
       whilst the other will be inserted after the lines related to the  two  routers  but  before  those  lines
       related to the switches.

        cfgmaker --global "WorkDir: /home/tobi"           \
                 --global "Options[_]: growright,bits"    \
                 --ifref=descr                            \
                 --ifdesc=alias                           \
                 <a href="mailto:public@router1.place.xyz">public@router1.place.xyz</a>                 \
                 <a href="mailto:public@router2.place.xyz">public@router2.place.xyz</a>                 \
                 --global "Options[_]: growright"         \
                 --ifref=name                             \
                 --ifdesc=descr                           \
                 <a href="mailto:public@switch1.place.xyz">public@switch1.place.xyz</a>                 \
                 --ifdesc=name                            \
                 <a href="mailto:public@switch2.place.xyz">public@switch2.place.xyz</a> &gt; mrtg.cfg

       The  next  example  demonstrates  how to use the <b>--community</b>, <b>--snmp-options</b> and <b>--dns-domain</b> to make the
       command line simpler.  All the equipment will use the community <u>hidden</u>, except for the  ppp-server  which
       use  community  <u>access</u>.   All  equipment  uses these SNMP options: <b>1s</b> <b>timeout</b>, <b>1</b> <b>retry</b> and <b>SNMP</b> <b>version</b> <b>2</b>
       (<b>backoff</b> and <b>port</b> is unspecified which means they use the default values).  The exception  again  is  the
       ppp-server which uses <b>SNMP</b> <b>version</b> <b>1</b>.  Finally, all the equipment is part of the domain <u>place.xyz</u>, except
       for the ppp-server which is part of the domain <u>remote.place.xyz</u>.  Note that the latter is achieved simply
       by specifying the name of the ppp-server to be <u>ppp-server.<b>remote</b></u> .

        cfgmaker --global "WorkDir: /home/tobi"           \
                 --global "Options[_]: growright,bits"    \
