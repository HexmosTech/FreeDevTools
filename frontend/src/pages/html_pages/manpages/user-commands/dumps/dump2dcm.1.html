</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       dump2dcm - Convert ASCII dump to DICOM file

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       dump2dcm [options] dumpfile-in dcmfile-out

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>dump2dcm</b>  utility  converts an ASCII dump file to a DICOM file. The dump file has the same format as
       the output of <b>dcmdump</b>. Thus it is possible to capture the output of <b>dcmdump</b>  into  a  file,  modify  some
       attributes and create a new DICOM file.

</pre><h4><b>PARAMETERS</b></h4><pre>
       dumpfile-in  dump input filename

       dcmfile-out  DICOM output filename ('-' for stdout)

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Dump</b> <b>File</b> <b>Description</b>
       The  input  file can be an output of <b>dcmdump</b> (default indented format only). One element (tag, VR, value)
       must be written into one line separated by arbitrary spaces or tab characters. A  '#'  begins  a  comment
       that ends at the line end. Empty lines are allowed.

       The individual parts of a line have the following syntax:

       Tag:   (gggg,eeee)
              with gggg and eeee are 4 character hexadecimal values
              representing group and element tag.  Spaces and tabs can be
              anywhere in a tag specification.
       VR:    Value Representation must be written as 2 characters as in
              Part 6 of the DICOM standard.  No spaces or tabs are allowed
              between the two characters.  If the VR can be determined from
              the tag, this part of a line is optional.
       Value: There are several rules for writing values:
              1. US, SS, UL, SL, UV, SV, FD, FL, OD, OF, OL and OV are written
                 as decimal strings that can be read by scanf().
              2. AT is written as '(gggg,eeee)' with additional spaces
                 stripped off automatically and gggg and eeee being decimal
                 strings that can be read by scanf().
              3. OB and OW values are written as byte or word hexadecimal
                 values separated by '\' character.  Alternatively, OB or OW
                 values can be read from a separate file by writing the
                 filename prefixed by a '=' character (e.g. '=largepix.dat').
                 The contents of the file will be read as is.  By default, OW
                 data is expected to be little endian ordered and will be
                 swapped if necessary.  No checks will be made to ensure that
                 the amount of data is reasonable in terms of other attributes
                 such as Rows or Columns.
                 In case of compressed pixel data, the line should start with
                 '(7fe0,0010) OB (PixelSequence' in order to distinguish from
                 uncompressed pixel data.
              4. UI is written as '=Name' in data dictionary or as unique
                 identifier string (see 6.), e.g. '[1.2.840.....]'.
              5. Strings without () &lt;&gt; [] spaces, tabs and # can be written
                 directly.
              6. Other strings must be surrounded by '[' and ']'.  No bracket
                 structure is passed.  The value ends at the last ']' in the
                 line.  Anything after the ']' is interpreted as comment.
              7. '(' and '&lt;' are interpreted special and may not be used when
                 writing an input file by hand as beginning characters of a
                 string.  Multiple Value are separated by '\'.  The lines
                 need not be sorted into ascending tag order.  References in
                 DICOM Directories are not supported.  Semantic errors are
                 not detected.

   <b>Examples</b>
       The following lines show valid examples of the syntax described above:

        (0008,0020) DA [19921012]            #  8, 1 StudyDate
        (0008,0016) UI =MRImageStorage       # 26, 1 SOPClassUID
        (0002,0012) UI [1.2.276.0.7230010.100.1.1]
        (0020,0032) DS [0.0\0.0]             #  8, 2 ImagePositionPatient
        (0028,0009) AT (3004,000c)           #  4, 1 FrameIncrementPointer
        (0028,0010) US 256                   #  4, 1 Rows
        (0002,0001) OB 01\00

   <b>Limitations</b>
       Please note that <b>dump2dcm</b> currently does not fully support DICOMDIR files. Specifically, the value of the
       various offset data elements is not updated automatically by this tool.

</pre><h4><b>LOGGING</b></h4><pre>
       The  level  of logging output of the various command line tools and underlying libraries can be specified
       by the user. By default, only errors and warnings are written to the standard error stream. Using  option
       <u>--verbose</u> also informational messages like processing details are reported. Option <u>--debug</u> can be used to
       get  more  details  on  the  internal  activity, e.g. for debugging purposes. Other logging levels can be
       selected using option <u>--log-level</u>. In <u>--quiet</u> mode only fatal errors are reported. In  such  very  severe
       error  events,  the application will usually terminate. For more details on the different logging levels,
       see documentation of module 'oflog'.

       In case the logging output should be written to file (optionally with logfile rotation), to syslog (Unix)
       or the event log (Windows) option <u>--log-config</u> can be used.  This  configuration  file  also  allows  for
       directing only certain messages to a particular output stream and for filtering certain messages based on
       the  module  or  application  where  they  are  generated.  An  example configuration file is provided in
       <u>&lt;etcdir&gt;/logger.cfg</u>.

</pre><h4><b>COMMAND</b> <b>LINE</b></h4><pre>
       All command line tools use the following notation for parameters: square brackets enclose optional values
       (0-1), three trailing dots indicate that multiple values are allowed (1-n), a combination of both means 0
       to n values.

       Command line options are distinguished from parameters by  a  leading  '+'  or  '-'  sign,  respectively.
       Usually,  order  and  position  of  command  line  options are arbitrary (i.e. they can appear anywhere).
       However, if options are mutually exclusive the rightmost appearance is used. This  behavior  conforms  to
       the standard evaluation rules of common Unix shells.

       In  addition,  one  or  more command files can be specified using an '@' sign as a prefix to the filename
       (e.g. <u>@command.txt</u>). Such a command argument is replaced by the content of the  corresponding  text  file
       (multiple  whitespaces  are treated as a single separator unless they appear between two quotation marks)
       prior to any further evaluation. Please note that a command file cannot  contain  another  command  file.
       This  simple but effective approach allows one to summarize common combinations of options/parameters and
       avoids longish and confusing command lines (an example is provided in file <u>&lt;datadir&gt;/dumppat.txt</u>).

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>dump2dcm</b> utility  will  attempt  to  load  DICOM  data  dictionaries  specified  in  the  <u>DCMDICTPATH</u>
       environment  variable.  By  default,  i.e.  if  the <u>DCMDICTPATH</u> environment variable is not set, the file
       <u>&lt;datadir&gt;/dicom.dic</u> will be loaded unless the dictionary is  built  into  the  application  (default  for
       Windows).

       The  default  behavior  should  be  preferred  and  the  <u>DCMDICTPATH</u>  environment variable only used when
       alternative data dictionaries are required. The <u>DCMDICTPATH</u> environment variable has the same  format  as
       the  Unix  shell  <u>PATH</u>  variable in that a colon (':') separates entries. On Windows systems, a semicolon
       (';') is used as a separator. The data dictionary code will attempt to load each file  specified  in  the
       <u>DCMDICTPATH</u> environment variable. It is an error if no data dictionary can be loaded.
