       sed - stream editor

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>sed</b> [ <b>-gln</b> ] [ <b>-e</b> <u>script</u> ] [ <b>-f</b> <u>sfile</u> ] [ <u>file</u> <u>...</u>  ]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Sed</u>  copies the named <u>files</u> (standard input default) to the standard output, edited according to a script
       of commands.  The <b>-f</b> option causes the script to be taken from file <u>sfile</u>; these options accumulate.   If
       there  is  just  one  <b>-e</b>  option  and  no <b>-f</b>'s, the flag <b>-e</b> may be omitted.  The <b>-n</b> option suppresses the
       default output; <b>-g</b> causes all substitutions to be global, as if suffixed <b>g</b>.  The <b>-l</b> option causes <u>sed</u>  to
       flush its output buffer after every newline.

       A script consists of editing commands, one per line, of the following form:

              [<u>address</u> [, <u>address</u>] ] <u>function</u> [<u>argument</u> ...]

       In normal operation <u>sed</u> cyclically copies a line of input into a <u>pattern</u> <u>space</u> (unless there is something
       left after a command), applies in sequence all commands whose <u>addresses</u> select that pattern space, and at
       the  end  of the script copies the pattern space to the standard output (except under <b>-n</b>) and deletes the
       pattern space.

       An <u>address</u> is either a decimal number that counts input lines cumulatively across files, a that addresses
       the last line of input, or a context address, <b>/</b><u>regular-expression</u><b>/</b>, in the style of <u><a href="../man7/regexp.7.html">regexp</a></u>(7),  with  the
       added convention that matches a newline embedded in the pattern space.

       A command line with no addresses selects every pattern space.

       A command line with one address selects each pattern space that matches the address.

       A  command  line with two addresses selects the inclusive range from the first pattern space that matches
       the first address through the next pattern space that matches the second.  (If the second  address  is  a
       number  less than or equal to the line number first selected, only one line is selected.)  Thereafter the
       process is repeated, looking again for the first address.

       Editing commands can be applied to non-selected pattern spaces by use of the negation function (below).

       An argument denoted <u>text</u> consists of one or more lines, all but the last of which end with  to  hide  the
       newline.   Backslashes  in text are treated like backslashes in the replacement string of an command, and
       may be used to protect initial blanks and tabs against the stripping that is done on every script line.

       An argument denoted <u>rfile</u> or <u>wfile</u> must terminate the command line and must be preceded  by  exactly  one
       blank.   Each  <u>wfile</u>  is  created  before  processing  begins.   There  can be at most 120 distinct <u>wfile</u>
       arguments.

       <b>a\</b>
       <u>text</u>         Append.  Place <u>text</u> on the output before reading the next input line.

       <b>b</b> <u>label</u>      Branch to the <b>:</b> command bearing the <u>label</u>.  If <u>label</u> is empty, branch  to  the  end  of  the
                    script.

       <b>c\</b>
       <u>text</u>         Change.   Delete the pattern space.  With 0 or 1 address or at the end of a 2-address range,
                    place <u>text</u> on the output.  Start the next cycle.

       <b>d</b>            Delete the pattern space.  Start the next cycle.

       <b>D</b>            Delete the initial segment of the pattern space through the first newline.  Start  the  next
                    cycle.

       <b>g</b>            Replace the contents of the pattern space by the contents of the hold space.

       <b>G</b>            Append the contents of the hold space to the pattern space.

       <b>h</b>            Replace the contents of the hold space by the contents of the pattern space.

       <b>H</b>            Append the contents of the pattern space to the hold space.

       <b>i\</b>
       <u>text</u>         Insert.  Place <u>text</u> on the standard output.

       <b>n</b>            Copy the pattern space to the standard output.  Replace the pattern space with the next line
                    of input.

       <b>N</b>            Append  the  next line of input to the pattern space with an embedded newline.  (The current
                    line number changes.)

       <b>p</b>            Print.  Copy the pattern space to the standard output.

       <b>P</b>            Copy the initial segment of the pattern space through the  first  newline  to  the  standard
                    output.

       <b>q</b>            Quit.  Branch to the end of the script.  Do not start a new cycle.

       <b>r</b> <u>rfile</u>      Read the contents of <u>rfile</u>.  Place them on the output before reading the next input line.

       <b>s/</b><u>regular-expression</u><b>/</b><u>replacement</u><b>/</b><u>flags</u>
                    Substitute  the  <u>replacement</u>  string  for instances of the <u>regular-expression</u> in the pattern
                    space.  Any character may be used instead of For a fuller description see <u><a href="../man7/regexp.7.html">regexp</a></u>(7).   <u>Flags</u>
                    is zero or more of

                    <b>g</b>      Global.   Substitute  for  all  non-overlapping  instances  of the <u>regular</u> <u>expression</u>
                           rather than just the first one.

                    <b>p</b>      Print the pattern space if a replacement was made.

                    <b>w</b> <u>wfile</u>
                           Write.  Append the pattern space to <u>wfile</u> if a replacement was made.

       <b>t</b> <u>label</u>      Test.  Branch to the command bearing the <u>label</u> if any substitutions have been made since the
                    most recent reading of an input line or execution of a If <u>label</u> is empty, branch to the  end
                    of the script.

       <b>w</b>            <u>wfile</u>
                    Write.  Append the pattern space to <u>wfile</u>.

       <b>x</b>            Exchange the contents of the pattern and hold spaces.

       <b>y/</b><u>string1</u><b>/</b><u>string2</u><b>/</b>
                    Transform.   Replace  all  occurrences  of  characters  in  <u>string1</u>  with  the corresponding
                    character in <u>string2</u>.  The lengths of <u>string1</u> and <u>string2</u> must be equal.

       <b>!</b><u>function</u>    Don't.  Apply the <u>function</u> (or group, if <u>function</u> is only  to  lines  <u>not</u>  selected  by  the
                    address(es).

       <b>:</b> <u>label</u>      This command does nothing; it bears a <u>label</u> for <b>b</b> and <b>t</b> commands to branch to.

       <b>=</b>            Place the current line number on the standard output as a line.

       <b>{</b>            Execute the following commands through a matching only when the pattern space is selected.

                    An empty command is ignored.

       If input is from a pipe, buffering may consume characters beyond a line on which a command is executed.
