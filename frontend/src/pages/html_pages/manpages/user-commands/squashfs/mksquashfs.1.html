       mksquashfs - tool to create and append to squashfs filesystems

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>mksquashfs</b> <u>source1</u> <u>source2</u> ...  <u>FILESYSTEM</u> [<u>OPTIONS</u>] [<u>-e</u> <u>list</u> <u>of</u> <u>exclude</u> <u>dirs/files</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Squashfs  is  a  highly  compressed  read-only filesystem for Linux.  It uses either gzip/xz/lzo/lz4/zstd
       compression to compress both files, inodes and directories.  Inodes in the system are very small and  all
       blocks are packed to minimise data overhead. Block sizes greater than 4K are supported up to a maximum of
       1Mbytes (default block size 128K).

       Squashfs  is  intended  for  general  read-only  filesystem  use, for archival use (i.e. in cases where a
       .tar.gz file may be used), and in constrained block device/memory systems (e.g. embedded  systems)  where
       low overhead is needed.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Filesystem</b> <b>compression</b> <b>options:</b>
       <b>-b</b> BLOCK_SIZE
              set  data  block to BLOCK_SIZE.  Default 128 Kbytes. Optionally a suffix of K or M can be given to
              specify Kbytes or Mbytes respectively.

       <b>-comp</b> COMP
              select COMP compression. Compressors available: gzip (default), lzo, lz4, xz, zstd, lzma.

       <b>-mkfs-time</b> TIME
              set  filesystem  creation timestamp to TIME. TIME can be an unsigned 32-bit int indicating seconds
              since the epoch (1970-01-01) or a string value which is passed to the "date" command to parse. Any
              string value which the date command recognises can be used such as "now", "last week", or "Wed Feb
              15 21:02:39 GMT 2023".

       <b>-all-time</b> TIME
              set all file timestamps to TIME. TIME can be an unsigned 32-bit int indicating seconds  since  the
              epoch  (1970-01-01)  or  a string value which is passed to the "date" command to parse. Any string
              value which the date command recognises can be used such as "now", "last week",  or  "Wed  Feb  15
              21:02:39 GMT 2023".

       <b>-root-time</b> TIME
              set  root  directory time to TIME. TIME can be an unsigned 32-bit int indicating seconds since the
              epoch (1970-01-01) or a string value which is passed to the "date" command to  parse.  Any  string
              value  which  the  date  command recognises can be used such as "now", "last week", or "Wed Feb 15

              if one source directory is specified, create a root directory containing  that  directory,  rather
              than the contents of the directory.

   <b>Filesystem</b> <b>filter</b> <b>options:</b>
       <b>-p</b> PSEUDO-DEFINITION
              add pseudo file definition.  The definition should be quoted.

       <b>-pf</b> PSEUDO-FILE
              add  list  of  pseudo file definitions from PSEUDO-FILE, use - for stdin.  Pseudo file definitions
              should not be quoted.

       <b>-sort</b> SORT_FILE
              sort files according to priorities in  SORT_FILE.   One  file  or  dir  with  priority  per  line.
              Priority <b>-32768</b> to 32767, default priority 0.

       <b>-ef</b> EXCLUDE_FILE
              list of exclude dirs/files.  One per line.

       <b>-wildcards</b>
              allow extended shell wildcards (globbing) to be used in exclude dirs/files.

       <b>-regex</b> allow POSIX regular expressions to be used in exclude dirs/files.

       <b>-max-depth</b> LEVELS
              descend at most LEVELS of directories when scanning filesystem.

       <b>-one-file-system</b>
              do  not  cross  filesystem  boundaries.   If  a  directory  crosses  the boundary, create an empty
              directory for each mount point.  If a file crosses the boundary ignore it.

       <b>-one-file-system-x</b>
              do not cross filesystem boundaries. Like  <b>-one-file-system</b>  option  except  directories  are  also
              ignored if they cross the boundary.

   <b>Filesystem</b> <b>extended</b> <b>attribute</b> <b>(xattrs)</b> <b>options:</b>
       <b>-no-xattrs</b>
              do not store extended attributes.

       <b>-xattrs</b>
              store extended attributes (default).

       <b>-xattrs-exclude</b> REGEX
              exclude any xattr names matching REGEX.  REGEX is a POSIX regular expression, e.g. <b>-xattrs-exclude</b>
              '^user.' excludes xattrs from the user namespace.

       <b>-xattrs-include</b> REGEX
              include any xattr names matching REGEX.  REGEX is a POSIX regular expression, e.g. <b>-xattrs-include</b>
              '^user.' includes xattrs from the user namespace.

       <b>-xattrs-add</b> NAME=VAL
              add  the  xattr  NAME  with  VAL to files.  If an user xattr it will be added to regular files and
              directories (see man 7 xattr).  Otherwise it will be added to all files.  VAL by default  will  be
              treated  as binary (i.e. an uninterpreted byte sequence), but it can be prefixed with 0s, where it
              will be treated as base64 encoded, or prefixed with 0x, where val will be treated as  hexidecimal.
              Additionally  it can be prefixed with 0t where this encoding is similar to binary encoding, except
              backslashes are specially treated, and a backslash followed by 3  octal  digits  can  be  used  to
              encode  any  ASCII character, which obviously can be used to encode control codes.  The option can
              be repeated multiple times to add multiple xattrs.

   <b>Mksquashfs</b> <b>runtime</b> <b>options:</b>
       <b>-version</b>
              print version, licence and copyright message.

       <b>-exit-on-error</b>
              treat normally ignored errors as fatal.

       <b>-quiet</b> no verbose output.

       <b>-info</b>  print files written to filesystem.

       <b>-no-progress</b>
              do not display the progress bar.

       <b>-progress</b>
              display progress bar when using the <b>-info</b> option.

       <b>-percentage</b>
              display a percentage rather than the full progress bar. Can be used with dialog <b>--gauge</b> etc.

       <b>-throttle</b> PERCENTAGE
              throttle the I/O input rate by the given percentage. This can be used to reduce the  I/O  and  CPU
              consumption of Mksquashfs.

       <b>-limit</b> PERCENTAGE
              limit  the  I/O  input  rate  to  the given percentage. This can be used to reduce the I/O and CPU
              consumption of Mksquashfs (alternative to <b>-throttle</b>).

       <b>-processors</b> NUMBER
              use NUMBER processors.  By default will use number of processors available.

       <b>-mem</b> SIZE
              use SIZE physical memory for caches.   Use  K,  M  or  G  to  specify  Kbytes,  Mbytes  or  Gbytes
              respectively.

       <b>-mem-percent</b> PERCENT
              use PERCENT physical memory for caches.  Default 25%.

       <b>-mem-default</b>
              print default memory usage in Mbytes.

   <b>Filesystem</b> <b>append</b> <b>options:</b>
       <b>-noappend</b>
              do not append to existing filesystem.

       <b>-root-becomes</b> NAME
              when  appending  source files/directories, make the original root become a subdirectory in the new
              root called NAME, rather than adding the new source items to the original root.

       <b>-no-recovery</b>
              do not generate a recovery file.

       <b>-recovery-path</b> NAME
              use NAME as the directory to store the recovery file.

       <b>-recover</b> NAME
              recover filesystem data using recovery file NAME.

   <b>Filesystem</b> <b>actions</b> <b>options:</b>
       <b>-action</b> ACTION@EXPRESSION
              evaluate EXPRESSION on every file, and execute ACTION if it returns TRUE.

       <b>-log-action</b> ACTION@EXPRESSION
              as above, but log expression evaluation results and actions performed.

       <b>-true-action</b> ACTION@EXPRESSION
              as above, but only log expressions which return TRUE.

       <b>-false-action</b> ACTION@EXPRESSION
              as above, but only log expressions which return FALSE.

       <b>-action-file</b> FILE
              as action, but read actions from FILE.

       <b>-log-action-file</b> FILE
              as <b>-log-action</b>, but read actions from FILE.

       <b>-true-action-file</b> FILE
              as <b>-true-action</b>, but read actions from FILE.

       <b>-false-action-file</b> FILE
              as <b>-false-action</b>, but read actions from FILE.

   <b>Tar</b> <b>file</b> <b>only</b> <b>options:</b>
       <b>-default-mode</b> MODE
              tar files often do not store permissions for  intermediate  directories.   This  option  sets  the
              default directory permissions to octal MODE, rather than 0755. This also sets the root inode mode.

       <b>-default-uid</b> UID
              tar  files  often  do  not  store uids for intermediate directories.  This option sets the default
              directory owner to UID, rather than the user running Mksquashfs. This also  sets  the  root  inode
              uid.

       <b>-default-gid</b> GID
              tar  files  often  do  not  store gids for intermediate directories.  This option sets the default
              directory group to GID, rather than the group of the user running Mksquashfs.  This also sets  the
              root inode gid.

       <b>-ignore-zeros</b>
              allow  tar  files  to  be concatenated together and fed to Mksquashfs.  Normally a tarfile has two
              consecutive 512 byte blocks filled with zeros which means EOF and  Mksquashfs  will  stop  reading
              after the first tar file on encountering them. This option makes Mksquashfs ignore the zero filled
              blocks.

   <b>Expert</b> <b>options</b> <b>(these</b> <b>may</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>filesystem</b> <b>unmountable):</b>
       <b>-nopad</b> do not pad filesystem to a multiple of 4K.

       <b>-offset</b> OFFSET
              skip OFFSET bytes at the beginning of FILESYSTEM. Optionally a suffix of K, M or G can be given to
              specify Kbytes, Mbytes or Gbytes respectively. Default 0 bytes.

       <b>-o</b> OFFSET
              synonym for <b>-offset</b>.

   <b>Miscellaneous</b> <b>options:</b>
       <b>-fstime</b> TIME
              alternative name for <b>-mkfs-time</b>.

       <b>-always-use-fragments</b>
              alternative name for <b>-tailends</b>.

              Use a block size of 1 Mbyte and Zstandard compression to create the filesystem.

       mksquashfs DIRECTORY IMAGE.SQFS -e file1 file2
              Exclude file1 and file2 from DIRECTORY when creating filesystem.  No wildcard matching of files.

       mksquashfs DIRECTORY IMAGE.SQFS -wildcards -e "*.gz"
              Exclude anything in DIRECTORY which matches the wildcard pattern "*.gz".

       mksquashfs DIRECTORY IMAGE.SQFS -wildcards -e "... *.gz"
              Exclude  files  which  match  the  wildcard  pattern "*.gz" anywhere within DIRECTORY and its sub-
              directories.  The initial "..." indicates the wildcard pattern is "non-anchored"  and  will  match
              anywhere.

       Note:  when  passing wildcarded names to Mksquashfs, they should be quoted (as in the above examples), to
       ensure that they are not processed by the shell.

   <b>Using</b> <b>pseudo</b> <b>file</b> <b>definitions</b>
       mksquashfs DIRECTORY IMAGE.SQFS -p "build_dir d 0644 0 0"
              Create a directory called "build_dir" in the output filesystem.

       mksquashfs DIRECTORY IMAGE.SQFS -p "version.txt l /tmp/build/version"
              Create a reference called "version.txt" to a file outside DIRECTORY, which acts  as  if  the  file
              "/tmp/build/version" was copied or hard-linked into DIRECTORY before calling Mksquashfs.

       mksquashfs DIRECTORY IMAGE.SQFS -p "date.txt f 0644 0 0 date"
              Create a file called "date.txt" which holds the output (stdout) from running the "date" command.

       mksquashfs DIRECTORY IMAGE.SQFS -p "\"hello world\" f 0644 0 0 date"
              As  above, but, showing that filenames can have spaces, if they are quoted.  The quotes need to be
              blackslashed to protect them from the shell.

       mksquashfs - IMAGE.SQFS -p "input f 0644 root root dd if=/dev/sda1 bs=1024" -p "/ d 0644 0 0"
              Create a file containing the contents of partition  /dev/sda1".   Ordinarily  Mksquashfs  given  a
              device,  fifo,  or  named  socket will place that special file within the Squashfs filesystem, the
              above allows input from these special files to be captured and placed in the Squashfs  filesystem.
              Note  there  are no other sources than the pseudo file, and so the command line source is "-".  If
              there are no other sources than pseudo files, the root (/) directory must be defined too, as  seen
              in this example.

       unsquashfs -pf - IMAGE.SQFS | mksquashfs - NEW.SQFS -pf -
              Transcode  IMAGE.SQFS  to  NEW.SQFS by piping the pseudo file output from Unsquashfs to Mksquashfs
              using stdout and stdin.  This can convert from earlier Squashfs filesystems or change  compression
              algorithm, block size etc.  without needing to unpack into an intermediate directory or file.

       Note: pseudo file definitions should be quoted (as in the above examples), to ensure that they are passed
       to Mksquashfs as a single argument, and to ensure that they are not processed by the shell.

   <b>Using</b> <b>extended</b> <b>attribute</b> <b>options</b>
       mksquashfs DIRECTORY IMAGE.SQFS -no-xattrs
              Do  not  store any extended attributes in the Squashfs filesystem.  Any extended attributes in the
              source files will be ignored.

       mksquashfs DIRECTORY IMAGE.SQFS -xattrs-include "^user."
              Filter the extended attributes in the source files, and only store extended attributes in the user
              namespace in the Squashfs filesystem.

       mksquashfs DIRECTORY IMAGE.SQFS -xattrs-exclude "^user."
              Filter the extended attributes in the source files, and don't store any extended attributes in the
              user namespace in the Squashfs filesystem.

       mksquashfs DIRECTORY IMAGE.SQFS -xattrs-add "user.comment=hello world"
              Add the extended attribute called "user.comment" with the content "hello world" to all  files  and
              directories in the Squashfs filesystem.

       mksquashfs DIRECTORY IMAGE.SQFS -xattrs-add "user.comment=0thello world\012"
              Add  the  extended  attribute called "user.comment" to all files and directories, but in this case
              the contents of the extended attribute will be "hello world" with  a  trailing  newline  character
              (012 octal).

       mksquashfs DIRECTORY IMAGE.SQFS -xattrs-add "user.comment=0saGVsbG8gd29ybGQ="
              Add  the extended attribute called "user.comment" to all files and directories, where the value is
              given in base64 encoding, representing "hello world".

       mksquashfs DIRECTORY IMAGE.SQFS -action "-xattrs-include(^user.) @ type(f)"
              Filter the extended attributes but only in  regular  files  (type  f),  and  only  store  extended
              attributes in the user namespace.

       mksquashfs DIRECTORY IMAGE.SQFS -p "hello_world x user.comment=0tsalve mundi\012"
              Add  the  extended  attribute  called  "user.comment"  to  the file called "hello_world", with the
              contents of the extended attribute being "salve mundi" with  a  trailing  newline  character  (012
              octal).

   <b>Using</b> <b>Actions</b> <b>to</b> <b>not</b> <b>compress,</b> <b>change</b> <b>attributes</b> <b>etc.</b>
       mksquashfs DIRECTORY IMAGE.SQSH -action "uncompressed @ (name(*.jpg) || name(*.mpg) ) || (name(*.img) &amp;&amp;
       filesize(+1G))"
              Specify  that  any  files  matching  the  wildcards  "*.jpg" and "*.mpg" should not be compressed.
              Additionally, it also specifies any files matching the wildcard "*.img"  and  are  larger  than  1
              Gigabyte  should  be  uncompressed  too.   This  shows test operators can be combined with logical
              expressions.

       mksquashfs DIRECTORY IMAGE.SQSH -action "chmod(o+r)@! perm(o+r)"
              If any files within DIRECTORY are not readable by "others", then make them readable by  others  in
              the Squashfs filesystem.

       mksquashfs DIRECTORY IMAGE.SQSH -action "uid(phillip)@! perm(o+r)"
              As  previous,  match on any files which are not readable by "others", but, in this case change the
              owner of the file to "phillip" in the Squashfs filesystem.

       mksquashfs DIRECTORY IMAGE.SQSH -action "prune @ type(l) &amp;&amp; ! exists"
              Delete any symbolic link within  DIRECTORY  which  points  outside  of  DIRECTORY,  i.e.  will  be
              unresolvable in the Squashfs filesystem.

       mksquashfs DIRECTORY IMAGE.SQSH -action "exclude @ <a href="../man3/depth.3.html">depth</a>(3)"
              Create  a  Squashfs  filesystem  containing  the  two  top  most levels (contents of DIRECTORY and
              immediate sub-directories), and exclude anything at level 3 or below.

       mksquashfs DIRECTORY IMAGE.SQFS -action "-xattrs-include(^user.) @ type(f)"
              Filter the extended attributes but only in  regular  files  (type  f),  and  only  store  extended
              attributes in the user namespace.

       Note:  actions  should be quoted (as in the above examples), to ensure that they are passed to Mksquashfs
       as a single argument, and to ensure that they are not processed by the shell.
