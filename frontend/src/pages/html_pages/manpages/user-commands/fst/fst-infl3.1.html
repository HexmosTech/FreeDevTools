</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       fst-infl, fst-infl2, fst-infl3 - morphological analysers

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>fst-infl</b> <b>[</b> <b>options</b> <b>]</b> <u>file</u> [ <u>input-file</u> [ <u>output-file</u> ] ]
       <b>fst-infl2</b> <b>[</b> <b>options</b> <b>]</b> <u>file</u> [ <u>input-file</u> [ <u>output-file</u> ] ]
       <b>fst-infl3</b> <b>[</b> <b>options</b> <b>]</b> <u>file</u> [ <u>input-file</u> [ <u>output-file</u> ] ]

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-t</b> <b>file</b>
              Read  an  alternative  transducer  from  <u>file</u>  and  use it if the main transducer fails to find an
              analysis. By iterating this option, a cascade of transducers may be tried to find an analysis.

       <b>-b</b>     Print surface and analysis symbols. (fst-infl2 only)

       <b>-n</b>     Print multi-character symbols without the enclosing angle brackets.  (fst-infl only)

       <b>-d</b>     The analyses are symbolically disambiguated by returning only analyses with a  minimal  number  of
              morphemes.  This  option  requires that morpheme boundaries are marked with the tag &lt;X&gt;. If no &lt;X&gt;
              tag is found in the analysis string, then the program (basically)  counts  the  number  of  multi-
              character   symbols  consisting  entirely  of  upper-case  characters  and  uses  this  count  for
              disambiguation. The latter heuristic was developed for the German SMOR morphology. (This option is
              only available with fst-infl2 and fst-infl3.)

       <b>-e</b> <b>n</b>   If no regular analysis is found, do robust matching and print analyses with up to <u>n</u>  edit  errors.
              The  set of edit operations currently includes replacement, insertion and deletion. Each operation
              has currently a fixed error weight of 1. (fst-infl2 only)

       <b>-%</b> <b>f</b>   Disambiguates the analyses statistically and prints the most likely analyses with at least f %  of
              the  total  probability mass of the analyses. The transducer weights are read from a file obtained
              by appending <u>.prob</u> to the name of the transducer file. The weight  files  are  created  with  <u>fst-</u>
              <u>train.</u>  (fst-infl2 only)

       <b>-p</b>     Print the probability of each analysis. (fst-infl2 only)

       <b>-c</b>     use  this  option if the transducer was compiled on a computer with a different endianness. If you
              have a transducer which was compiled on a Sparc computer and you want to use it on a Pentium,  you
              need to use this option. (fst-infl2 only)

       <b>-q</b>     Suppress status messages.

       <b>-h</b>     Print usage information.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>fst-infl</u>  is  a  morphological  analyser. The first argument is the name of a file which was generated by
       <u>fst-compiler.</u>  The second argument is the name of the input file. The third argument is the output  file.
       If  the  third  argument is missing, output is directed to <u>stdout.</u>  If the second argument is missing, as
       well, input is read from <u>stdin.</u>

       <u>fst-infl2</u> is similar to <u>fst-infl</u> but needs a transducer in compact format (see the  man  pages  for  <u>fst-</u>
       <u>compiler</u> <u>and</u> <u>fst-compact).</u> <u>fst-infl2</u> <u>is</u> <u>implemented</u> <u>differently</u> from fst-infl and usually much faster.

       <u>fst-infl3</u> is also similar to <u>fst-infl</u> but needs a transducer in lowmem format (see the man pages for <u>fst-</u>
       <u>compiler</u>  <u>and</u>  <u>fst-lowmem).</u> <u>fst-infl3</u> <u>accesses</u> <u>the</u> <u>transducer</u> <u>on</u> disc rather than reading it into memory.
       It starts very fast and needs very little memory, but is slower than fst-infl2.

       <u>fst-infl</u> reads the transducer which is stored in the argument file. Then it reads the input file line  by
       line.  Each line is analysed with the transducer and all resulting analyses are printed (see also the man
       pages for <u>fst-mor).</u>
