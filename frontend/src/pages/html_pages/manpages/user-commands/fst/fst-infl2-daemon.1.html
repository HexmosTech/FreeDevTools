</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       fst-infl2-daemon - morphological analysers

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>fst-infl2-daemon</b> <b>[</b> <b>options</b> <b>]</b> <u>&lt;socket-no&gt;</u> <u>file</u>

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-t</b> <b>file</b>
              Read  an  alternative  transducer  from  <u>file</u>  and  use it if the main transducer fails to find an
              analysis. By iterating this option, a cascade of transducers may be tried to find an analysis.

       <b>-b</b>     Print surface and analysis symbols. (fst-infl2 only)

       <b>-n</b>     Print multi-character symbols without the enclosing angle brackets.  (fst-infl only)

       <b>-d</b>     The analyses are symbolically disambiguated by returning only analyses with a  minimal  number  of
              morphemes.  This  option  requires that morpheme boundaries are marked with the tag &lt;X&gt;. If no &lt;X&gt;
              tag is found in the analysis string, then the program (basically)  counts  the  number  of  multi-
              character   symbols  consisting  entirely  of  upper-case  characters  and  uses  this  count  for
              disambiguation. The latter heuristic was developed for the German SMOR morphology. (This option is
              only available with fst-infl2 and fst-infl3.)

       <b>-e</b> <b>n</b>   If no regular analysis is found, do robust matching and print analyses with up to <u>n</u>  edit  errors.
              The  set of edit operations currently includes replacement, insertion and deletion. Each operation
              has currently a fixed error weight of 1. (fst-infl2 only)

       <b>-%</b> <b>f</b>   Disambiguates the analyses statistically and prints the most likely analyses with at least f %  of
              the  total  probability mass of the analyses. The transducer weights are read from a file obtained
              by appending <u>.prob</u> to the name of the transducer file. The weight  files  are  created  with  <u>fst-</u>
              <u>train.</u>  (fst-infl2 only)

       <b>-p</b>     Print the probability of each analysis. (fst-infl2 only)

       <b>-c</b>     use  this  option if the transducer was compiled on a computer with a different endianness. If you
              have a transducer which was compiled on a Sparc computer and you want to use it on a Pentium,  you
              need to use this option. (fst-infl2 only)

       <b>-q</b>     Suppress status messages.

       <b>-h</b>     Print usage information.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>fst-infl2-daemon</u> is similar to <u>fst-infl2</u> but but reads and writes from/to a socket.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       No bugs are known so far.

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       fst-infl2, fst-compiler, fst-mor
