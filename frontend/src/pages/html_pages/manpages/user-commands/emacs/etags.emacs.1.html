</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>etags</b> program is used to create a tag table file, in a format understood by <b>emacs</b>(<b>1</b>); the <b>ctags</b> pro‐
       gram is used to create a similar table in a format understood by <b>vi</b>(<b>1</b>).  Both forms of the program under‐
       stand the syntax of C, Objective C, C++, Java, Fortran, Ada, Cobol, Erlang, Forth, Go, HTML, LaTeX, Emacs
       Lisp/Common Lisp, Lua, Makefile, Mercury, Pascal, Perl, Ruby,  Rust,  PHP,  PostScript,  Python,  Prolog,
       Scheme  and  most  assembler-like syntaxes.  Both forms read the files specified on the command line, and
       write a tag table (defaults: <b>TAGS</b> for <b>etags</b>, <b>tags</b> for <b>ctags</b>) in the  current  working  directory.   Files
       specified  with relative file names will be recorded in the tag table with file names relative to the di‐
       rectory where the tag table resides.  If the tag table is in <a href="file:/dev">/dev</a> or is the standard output, however, the
       file names are made relative to the working directory.  Files specified with absolute file names will  be
       recorded  with  absolute  file names.  Files generated from a source file--like a C file generated from a
       source Cweb file--will be recorded with the name of the source file.  Compressed files are supported  us‐
       ing  gzip,  bzip2,  xz, and zstd.  The programs recognize the language used in an input file based on its
       file name and contents.  The <b>--language</b> switch can be used to force parsing of the file  names  following
       the switch according to the given language, overriding guesses based on filename extensions.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Some options make sense only for the <b>vi</b> style tag files produced by ctags; <b>etags</b> does not recognize them.
       The programs accept unambiguous abbreviations for long option names.

       <b>-a,</b> <b>--append</b>
              Append to existing tag file.  (For <b>vi</b>-format tag files, see also <b>--update</b>.)

       <b>-B,</b> <b>--backward-search</b>
              Tag files written in the format expected by <b>vi</b> contain regular expression search instructions; the
              <b>-B</b>  option writes them using the delimiter "<b>?</b>", to search <u>backwards</u> through files.  The default is
              to use the delimiter "<b>/</b>", to search <u>forwards</u> through files.  Only <b>ctags</b> accepts this option.

       <b>--declarations</b>
              In C and derived languages, create tags for function declarations,  and  create  tags  for  extern
              variables  unless  --no-globals  is used.  In Lisp, create tags for (defvar foo) declarations.  In
              Mercury, declarations start a line with "<b>:-</b>" and are always tagged.  In addition, this option tags
              predicates or functions in first rules of clauses, as in Prolog.

       <b>-D,</b> <b>--no-defines</b>
              Do not create tag entries for C preprocessor constant definitions and enum  constants.   This  may
              make the tags file much smaller if many header files are tagged.

       <b>--globals</b>
              Create  tag  entries  for global variables in Perl and Makefile.  This is the default in C and de‐
              rived languages.

       <b>--no-globals</b>
              Do not tag global variables in C and derived languages.  Typically this reduces the file  size  by
              one fourth.

       <b>--no-line-directive</b>
              Ignore  <b>#line</b>  preprocessor  directives in C and derived languages.  The default is to honor those
              directives, and record the tags as if the file scanned was the one named in the  <b>#line</b>  directive.
              This switch is useful when the original file named by <b>#line</b> is no longer available.

       <b>-i</b> <u>file</u>, <b>--include=</b><u>file</u>
              Include  a note in the tag file indicating that, when searching for a tag, one should also consult
              the tags file <u>file</u> after checking the current file.  Only <b>etags</b> accepts this option.

       <b>-I,</b> <b>--ignore-indentation</b>
              Don't rely on indentation as much as we normally do.  Currently, this means not to assume  that  a
              closing  brace  in  the first column is the final brace of a function or structure definition in C
              and C++.  This is important for code that doesn't observe the GNU Coding  conventions  of  placing
              only top-level braces in column zero.

       <b>-l</b> <u>language</u>, <b>--language=</b><u>language</u>
              Parse  the following files according to the given language.  More than one such options may be in‐
              termixed with filenames.  Use <b>--help</b> to get a list of the available languages  and  their  default
              filename  extensions.   For example, as Mercury and Objective-C have same filename extension <u>.m</u>, a
              test based on contents tries to detect the language.  If this test  fails,  <b>--language=</b><u>mercury</u>  or
              <b>--language=</b><u>objc</u> should be used.  The "auto" language can be used to restore automatic detection of
              language  based on the file name.  The "none" language may be used to disable language parsing al‐
              together; only regexp matching is done in this case (see the <b>--regex</b> option).

       <b>--members</b>
              Create tag entries for variables that are members of structure-like constructs in  PHP.   This  is
              the default for C and derived languages.

       <b>--no-members</b>
              Do not tag member variables.

       <b>--packages-only</b>
              Only tag packages in Ada files.

       <b>--parse-stdin=</b><u>file</u>
              May  be  used (only once) in place of a file name on the command line.  <b>etags</b> will read from stan‐
              dard input and mark the produced tags as belonging to the file <b>FILE</b>.

       <b>-Q,</b> <b>--class-qualify</b>
              Qualify tag names with their class name in C++, ObjC, Java, and Perl.  This produces tag names  of
              the form <u>class</u><b>::</b><u>member</u> for C++ and Perl, <u>class</u><b>(</b><u>category</u><b>)</b> for Objective C, and <u>class</u><b>.</b><u>member</u> for Ja‐
              va.   For  Objective  C,  this  also  produces class methods qualified with their arguments, as in
              <u>foo</u><b>:</b><u>bar</u><b>:</b><u>baz</u><b>:</b><u>more</u>.

       <b>-o</b> <u>tagfile</u>, <b>--output=</b><u>tagfile</u>
              Explicit name of file for tag table; for <b>etags</b> only, a file name of - means standard output; over‐
              rides default <b>TAGS</b> or <b>tags</b>.  (But ignored with <b>-v</b> or <b>-x</b>.)

       <b>-r</b> <u>regexp</u>, <b>--regex=</b><u>regexp</u>

              Make tags based on regexp matching for the files following this option, in addition  to  the  tags
              made with the standard parsing based on language.  May be freely intermixed with filenames and the
              <b>-R</b> option.  The regexps are cumulative, i.e., each such option will add to the previous ones.  The
              regexps are of one of the forms:
                   [<b>{</b><u>language</u><b>}</b>]<b>/</b><u>tagregexp/</u>[<u>nameregexp</u><b>/</b>]<u>modifiers</u>
                   <b>@</b><u>regexfile</u>

              where  <u>tagregexp</u>  is used to match the tag.  It should not match useless characters.  If the match
              is such that more characters than needed are unavoidably matched by <u>tagregexp</u>, it may be useful to
              add a <u>nameregexp</u>, to narrow down the tag scope.  <b>ctags</b> ignores regexps without a <u>nameregexp</u>.   The
              syntax  of regexps is the same as in Emacs, except that backslash escapes are the same as GNU grep
              (which means, for example, that shy groups  are  not  supported),  and  <b>[:ascii:]</b>,  <b>[:multibyte:]</b>,
              <b>[:nonascii:]</b>,  <b>[:word:]</b>,  and  <b>[:unibyte:]</b>  are not supported.  The following character escape se‐
              quences are supported: \a, \b, \d, \e, \f, \n, \r, \t, \v, which respectively stand for the  ASCII
              characters BEL, BS, DEL, ESC, FF, NL, CR, TAB, VT.
              The  <u>modifiers</u>  are  a  sequence  of 0 or more characters among <u>i</u>, which means to ignore case when
              matching; <u>m</u>, which means that the <u>tagregexp</u> will be matched against the  whole  file  contents  at
              once,  rather  than line by line, and the matching sequence can match multiple lines; and <u>s</u>, which
              implies <u>m</u> and means that the dot character in <u>tagregexp</u> matches the newline char as well.
              The separator, which is <b>/</b> in the examples, can be any character different from space, tab,  braces
              and  <b>@</b>.   If the separator character is needed inside the regular expression, it must be quoted by
              preceding it with <b>\</b>.
              The optional <b>{</b><u>language</u><b>}</b> prefix means that the tag should be created only  for  files  of  language
              <u>language</u>, and ignored otherwise.  This is particularly useful when storing many predefined regexps
              in a file.
              In  its  second  form,  <u>regexfile</u> is the name of a file that contains a number of arguments to the
              <u>--regex=</u> option, one per line.  Lines beginning with a space or tab are assumed  to  be  comments,
              and ignored.

              Here are some examples.  All the regexps are quoted to protect them from shell interpretation.

              Tag the DEFVAR macros in the emacs source files:
              <u>--regex='/[</u> <u>\t]*DEFVAR_[A-Z</u><b>_</b> <u>\t(]+"\([^"]+\)"/'</u>

              Tag VHDL files (this example is a single long line, broken here for formatting reasons):
              <u>--language=none</u> <u>--regex='/[</u> <u>\t]*\(ARCHITECTURE\|\</u>   <u>CONFIGURATION\)</u> <u>+[^</u> <u>]*</u> <u>+OF/'</u> <u>--regex='/[</u> <u>\t]*\</u>
              <u>\(ATTRIBUTE\|ENTITY\|FUNCTION\|PACKAGE\(</u> <u>BODY\)?\</u>                                         <u>\|PROCE‐</u>
              <u>DURE\|PROCESS\|TYPE\)[</u> <u>\t]+\([^</u> <u>\t(]+\)/\3/'</u>

              Tag Tcl files (this last example shows the usage of a <u>tagregexp</u>):
              <u>--lang=none</u> <u>--regex='<a href="file:/proc">/proc</a>[</u> <u>\t]+\([^</u> <u>\t]+\)/\1/'</u>

              A  regexp  can be preceded by {<u>lang</u>}, thus restricting it to match lines of files of the specified
              language.  Use <b>etags</b> <b>--help</b> to obtain a list of the recognized languages.  This feature is partic‐
              ularly useful inside <b>regex</b> <b>files</b>.  A regex file contains one regex per  line.   Empty  lines,  and
              those  lines  beginning  with  space or tab are ignored.  Lines beginning with @ are references to
              regex files whose name follows the @ sign.  Other lines are considered  regular  expressions  like
              those following <b>--regex</b>.
              For example, the command
              <u>etags</u> <u>--regex=@regex.file</u> <u>*.c</u>
              reads the regexes contained in the file regex.file.

       <b>-R,</b> <b>--no-regex</b>
              Don't do any more regexp matching on the following files.  May be freely intermixed with filenames
              and the <b>--regex</b> option.

       <b>-u,</b> <b>--update</b>
              Update  tag  entries  for  <u>files</u> specified on command line, leaving tag entries for other files in
              place.  Currently, this is implemented by deleting the existing entries for the  given  files  and
              then  rewriting the new entries at the end of the tags file.  It is often faster to simply rebuild
              the entire tag file than to use this.  Only <b>ctags</b> accepts this option.

       <b>-v,</b> <b>--vgrind</b>
              Instead of generating a tag file, write index (in <b>vgrind</b> format) to standard output.   Only  <b>ctags</b>
              accepts this option.

       <b>-x,</b> <b>--cxref</b>
              Instead  of  generating  a tag file, write a cross reference (in <b>cxref</b> format) to standard output.
              Only <b>ctags</b> accepts this option.

       <b>-h,</b> <b>-H,</b> <b>--help</b>
              Print usage information.  Followed by one or  more  --language=LANG  prints  detailed  information
              about how tags are created for LANG.

       <b>-V,</b> <b>--version</b>
              Print the current version of the program (same as the version of the emacs <b>etags</b> is shipped with).
