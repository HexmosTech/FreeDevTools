       <b>create_bmp_for_stripline_coupler</b>  -  bitmap  generator  for  coupler  with  thin  striplines  between two
       infinitely wide groundplanes (part of <b>atlc</b>)

</pre><h4><b>WARNING</b></h4><pre>
       This man page is not a complete set of documentation - the complexity of the atlc project makes man pages
       not an ideal way to document it, although  out  of  completeness,  man  pages  are  produced.   The  best
       documentation  that  was current at the time the version was produced should be found on your hard drive,
       usually at
       /usr/local/share/atlc/docs/html-docs/index.html
       although it might be elsewhere if your system administrator  chose  to  install  the  package  elsewhere.
       Sometimes,  errors are corrected in the documentation and placed at <a href="http://atlc.sourceforge.net/">http://atlc.sourceforge.net/</a> before a
       new release of atlc is released.  Please, if you notice a problem with the documentation - even  spelling
       errors and typos, please let me know.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>create_bmp_for_stripline_coupler</b>  is a pre-processor for <b>atlc</b>, the finite difference program that is used
       to calculate the properties of a two and three conductor electrical transmission lines of arbitrary cross
       section. The program <b>create_bmp_for_stripline_coupler</b> is used as a fast way of generating bitmaps  (there
       is  no  need  to  use  a  graphics  program), for a pair of 1 pixel thick conductors of width w, spaced a
       distance s apart, inside a pair of groundplanes of  separation H. This has an  exact  analytical  answer,
       when  the inner is infinitely thin and the overall width W is infinitely wide. This theoretical impedance
       is calculated and printed to stderr if the  -v  option  is  given  on  create_bmp_for_stripline_coupler's
       command line.

       The  overall  width  W  is  calculated  internally to be large enough that making it any larger will have
       negligible effect on the results.  The dielectric is assumed that of vacuum.

       The bitmaps produced by <b>create_bmp_for_stripline_coupler</b> are 24-bit bit colour bitmaps, as  are  required
       by <b>atlc</b>.

       <b>-C</b>
       Print the full copyright information and exit.

       <b>-b</b> <b>bitmapsize</b>
       is  used  to  set  the  size  of  the  bitmap, and so the accuracy to which atlc is able to calculate the
       coupler's properties. The default value for 'bitmapsize' is normally 18  although  this  can  be  set  at
       compile  time. (see 'DEFAULT_COUPLER_BITMAP_SIZE' in definitions.h). The value can be set anywhere from 6
       to 28. The size of bitmap produced will be between 2^(bitmapsize-1) and 2^(bitmapsize+1), so if  its  set
       to 28 the bitmap could be as big as 512 Mb, which would take an eternity to compute.

       <b>-v</b>
       Print  some extra data to stdout on the theoretical impedance of the structure. This is useful to compare
       with the numerical result from <b>atlc</b>

       In the first example, a standard coupler is created, where the
