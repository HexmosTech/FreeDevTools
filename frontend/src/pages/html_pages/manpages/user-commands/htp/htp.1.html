       htp - HTML preprocessor

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>htp</b> [options] &lt;input file&gt; &lt;output file&gt;
       <b>htp</b> [options] @&lt;response file&gt;
       <b>htp</b> [options] @

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  documents  briefly  the  <b>htp</b>  command.   This  manual page was written for the Debian
       distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.  Instead, it has documentation  in
       HTML format; see /usr/share/doc/htp.

       <b>htp</b>  is  an  HTML  pre-processor.  It  is  designed  to  be  a flexible authoring tool that can easily be
       integrated into the design process. <b>htp</b> works by processing special HTML files and  producing  as  output
       regular  HTML  files ready to be served up. The original HTML files are "special" because they (possibly)
       contain certain markup tags only recognizable to <b>htp</b>.
       To handle larger sets of files, <b>htp</b> also accepts a response file, which lists input/output filename pairs
       and additional response files. For more information on response files, see the HTML documentation.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       A summary of options is included below.  For a complete description, see the HTML  documentation.   These
       options can be used on the command-line by preceding their name with a '-' or '/' character.

       <b>H,</b> <b>?</b>   Shows basic usage information.

       <b>IMGXY</b>  Width &amp; height will be added to all image tags. This is the default setting.

       <b>NOIMGXY</b>
              Width &amp; height will not be added to image tags (but not removed if already found).

       <b>QUIET</b>  Pre-processor only displays warnings and error messages.

       <b>VERBOSE</b>
              Pre-processor  displays  all  informational,  warnings,  and  error  messages. This is the default
              setting.

       <b>DEPEND</b> Check target file's dependencies before processing. If the input file, or any of the file  it  may
              INCLUDE  have  changed,  it  will  continue  and  build  the  output  file.  Otherwise,  a  simple
              informational message will be printed and no action will occur. This is the default setting.

       <b>NODEPEND</b>
              Dependency checking will not occur during processing.

       <b>PRECIOUS</b>
              Normally, if htp cannot finish processing a file, it will delete the  incomplete  output  file  to
              prevent  using  it  accidentally. However, if this is not desirable, the PRECIOUS option will turn
              off this behavior.

       <b>CONDENSE</b>
              All HTML will be condensed, which is merely stripping it of all linefeeds. HTML does  not  require
              any  carriage returns or linefeeds, so the format of the output will not be changed. However, file
              sizes will be somewhat smaller, and should load a little faster, especially over a slow link.

       <b>NOCONDENSE</b>
              This disables condensing the output. This is the default setting.

       <b>DELIM</b>  This can be set to either HTML, CURLY or SQUARE. Each setting determines how htp markups should be
              surrounded in the text. HTML indicates using arrow brackets ('&lt;' and '&gt;') just like standard  HTML
              tags.  CURLY  means  tags  should  be surrounded by curly braces ('{' and '}'). SQUARE uses square
              brackets ('[' and ']') to surround htp tags. Note that this only applies to the special  htp  tags
              and  not  to the standard HTML tags, including IMG (which htp can process.) The default setting is
              HTML.
