</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       tiemu - a TI's hand-helds emulator (m68k-based)

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSYS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>tiemu</b> [-h] [-v] [--help] [--version] [--import] [-rom=] [-tib=] [-sav=] [filename]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>TiEmu</b> program allows you to emulate a Texas Instruments calculator such as TI89, TI89 Titanium, TI92,
       TI92+  or V200PLT.  The emulator has also a virtual link capability which allows to connect it to another
       program (such as TiLP for instance).

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The command line options override the default options (startup options) and the config file options even.
       The <b>TiEmu</b> program accepts the following options:

       <b>-h,</b> <b>--help</b>
              Display a list of all command line options.

       <b>-v,</b> <b>--version</b>
              Output the version info.

       <b>--import=</b>
              Import ROM or TIB into repository and exit. Can be used for creating images (as an example).  This
              flag must be set before -rom or -tib !

       <b>-rom=</b>  Convert and use the specified dump as image. Note that the image is added to the image repository.
              Provided for compatibility.

       <b>-tib=</b>  Convert and use the specified tib/upgrade as image. Idem.  Provided for compatibility.

       <b>-sav=</b>  Load the specified state file. Must be a valid state image and  target  for  emulated  calculator.
              Provided for compatibility.

       <b>filename</b>
              Load  a  ROM/TIB/SAV  file.  ROM  &amp;  TIB files are converted and added to images repository. Image
              corresponding to SAV file is automatically loaded and state is load.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIG</b> <b>FILE</b> <b>FORMAT</b></h4><pre>
       This section describes the format of the .tiemu config file which is in the home directory  of  the  user
       (Linux)  or  in  the  Program Files folder (Win32). A line preceded by the '#' symbol is a comment.  Each
       line has the following format: key=value.  The config file must have the 'RC_END' string at  end.   Every
       line  can  be  put  in  any  order.   Take  in  mind  that  any  comment added in the config file will be
       overwritten.  Below is described each option and the possible values:

       <b>calctype=</b> Defines the calculator type for link parameter. Valid values are:  ti89,  ti89t,  ti92,  ti92+,
       v200.  Note: don't need to touch this setting, it's overridden by TiEmu. Kept for compatibility.

       <b>linktype=</b>  Define  the  link  cable  type.  Choose  one  of  the following value: none, parallel, serial,
       TIGraphLink, virtual, TiEmulator, VTi, UsbGraphLink.

       <b>port=</b> Define a link port to use. Can be: null, user, parallel port #1|2|3, serial port #1|2|3|4,  virtual
       port #1|2, USB port #1.

       <b>method=</b> Define an I/O method to use. Possible values are: automatic, asm, api, driver, null.

       <b>adr_port=</b> places the I/O address of the I/O port to use. It can be 0x3F8 for a serial port or 0x378 for a

       <b>serial_device=</b> places the character device name of the serial port to use with a Grey TIGL.

       <b>timeout=</b> with the timeout value to use in tenth of seconds. Default value: 20.

       -  native:  native  one (default): Win32 on Windows, KDE if built with KDE support and running under KDE,
       GTK+ 2.x else,
       - old: GTK 1.2 file selector,
       - new: GTK 2.x file selector (advanced capabilities and can show hidden files),
       - win32: deprecated (same as native),
       - kde: KDE file selector (only available if TiEmu is built with KDE support).

       <b>bkpts_wnd=</b>
       <b>code_wnd=</b>
       <b>mem_wnd=</b>

       x&amp;y are coordinates, w&amp;h are the size, m is set if window is minimized and v is  set  if  the  window  is
       open.
       <b>dbg_font_type=</b> Enable custom font if set to "custom"; use default font if set to "default".
       <b>dbg_font_name=</b>  Name  of  font  to  use.  It  must  be  a  valid  Pango  description  font name: a string
       representation in the form "[FAMILY-LIST] [STYLE-OPTIONS] [SIZE]", where FAMILY-LIST is a comma separated
       list of families optionally terminated by a comma, STYLE_OPTIONS is a whitespace separated list of  words
       where  each WORD describes one of style, variant, weight, or stretch, and SIZE is an decimal number (size
       in points). Any one of the options may be absent. If FAMILY-LIST is absent, then the family_name field of
       the resulting font description will be initialized to NULL. If STYLE-OPTIONS is missing, then  all  style
       options will be set to the default values. If SIZE is missing, the size in the resulting font description
       will be set to 0.

       Think to terminate your config script with the 'RC_END' word !!!
