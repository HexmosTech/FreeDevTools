</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       fuse — Sinclair ZX Spectrum emulator

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>fuse</b> [<u>options</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Fuse  is  a  Sinclair  ZX Spectrum  emulator.  It supports several models (including the 128), with quite
       faithful emulation of the display and sound.

       The emulator can load any of the formats supported by <u><a href="../man3/libspectrum.3.html">libspectrum</a></u>(3) — this includes  Z80,  SNA  and  SZX
       snapshots,  and PZX, TAP and TZX virtual-tape files. Saving to SZX, Z80 and SNA snapshots and TZX and TAP
       tape files is supported. The SLT extension to the Z80 format is partly supported (enough  for  multi-load
       games); however, loading of the old DAT-file variant is not.

       DSK,  UDI,  FDI,  TD0,  MGT,  IMG,  D40, D80, SAD, TRD, SCL and OPD disk images are supported when a disk
       interface is being emulated, including the integrated disk drives on +3, Pentagon or Scorpion machines as
       well as the +D, DISCiPLE, Opus Discovery, Beta 128 and Didaktik 80 interfaces. DCK cartridge  images  are
       supported when emulating a Timex 2068 variant. Interface 2 ROM cartridges are also supported.

       Finally, there is also support for reading and writing the RZX input recording format.

       See  the  <b>COMPRESSED</b>  <b>FILES</b>  section  for  details  on reading files compressed with <u><a href="../man3/bzip2.3.html">bzip2</a></u>(3), <u><a href="../man3/gzip.3.html">gzip</a></u>(3) or
       <u><a href="../man3/zip.3.html">zip</a></u>(3).

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--accelerate-loader</b>
              Specify whether Fuse should attempt to accelerate tape loaders by “short circuiting”  the  loading
              loop.  This  will  in  general  speed  up loading, but may cause some loaders to fail. (Enabled by
              default, but you can use `<b>--no-accelerate-loader</b>' to disable).  The  same  as  the  Media  Options
              dialog's <u>Accelerate</u> <u>loaders</u> option.

       <b>--aspect-hint</b>
              Specify  whether  the  GTK  and Xlib user interfaces should `hint' to the window manager about the
              preferred aspect ratio for the graphics window, thus preventing resizing to non-square sizes which
              lead to Fuse not displaying correctly. This option has been observed to cause problems  with  some
              window  managers when using the GTK UI which can prevent the window from being resized or moved at
              all. (Enabled  by  default,  but  you  can  use  `<b>--no-aspect-hint</b>'  to  disable).  See  also  the
              `<b>--strict-aspect-hint</b>' option.

       <b>--autosave-settings</b>
              Specify  whether  Fuse's  current  settings should be automatically saved on exit. The same as the
              General Options dialog's <u>Auto-save</u> <u>settings</u> option.

       <b>--auto-load</b>
              Specify whether tape and disk files should be automatically loaded when they are opened using  the
              <u>File,</u>  <u>Open...</u>   menu  option. In the case of TRD/SCL disk images, inserts also a boot loader file
              when none is available. (Enabled by default, but you can use `<b>--no-auto-load</b>' to disable). Same as
              the Media Options dialog's <u>Auto-load</u> <u>media</u> option.

       <b>--beta128</b>
              Emulate a Beta 128 interface. Same as the Disk Peripherals  Options  dialog's  <u>Beta</u> <u>128</u>  <u>interface</u>
              option.

       <b>--beta128-48boot</b>
              When  a  Beta 128  interface  is  used in 48K or TC2048 emulation the option additionally controls
              whether the machine boots directly into the TR-DOS system. Same as the  Disk  Peripherals  Options
              dialog's <u>Beta</u> <u>128</u> <u>auto-boot</u> <u>in</u> <u>48K</u> <u>machines</u> option.

       <b>--betadisk</b> <u>file</u>
              Insert  the  specified  file  into the emulated Beta disk interface's drive A: and select Pentagon
              mode on startup.

       <b>--bw-tv</b>
              Specify whether the display should simulate a colour or black and white television. This option is
              effective under the GTK, Win32, Xlib and SDL user interfaces: the others will  always  simulate  a
              colour TV.  The same as the General Options dialog's <u>Black</u> <u>and</u> <u>white</u> <u>TV</u> option.

       <b>--cmos-z80</b>
              This  option specifies that Fuse should emulate a CMOS Z80, as opposed to an NMOS Z80. Same as the
              General Options dialog's <u>Z80</u> <u>is</u> <u>CMOS</u> option.

       <b>--competition-code</b> <u>code</u>
              Specify the code to be written to competition mode RZX files. The same as the RZX Options dialog's
              <u>Competition</u> <u>code</u> option.

       <b>--competition-mode</b>
              Specify whether input recordings should be made in  `competition  mode'.   The  same  as  the  RZX
              Options dialog's <u>Competition</u> <u>mode</u> option.

       <b>--compress-rzx</b>
              Specify  whether  RZX files should be written out compressed. (Enabled by default, but you can use
              `<b>--no-compress-rzx</b>' to disable). Same as the RZX Options dialog's <u>Compress</u> <u>RZX</u> <u>data</u> option.

       <b>--confirm-actions</b>
              Specify whether `dangerous' actions (those which could cause data loss, for example resetting  the
              Spectrum)   require   confirmation  before  occurring.  (Enabled  by  default,  but  you  can  use
              `<b>--no-confirm-actions</b>' to disable). This option is  the  same  as  the  General  Options  dialog's
              <u>Confirm</u> <u>actions</u> option.

       <b>--covox</b>
              Emulate  a  Covox  sound  interface for Pentagon/Scorpion. Same as the General Peripherals Options
              dialog's <u>Covox</u> option.

       <b>--debugger-command</b> <u>string</u>
              Specify a debugger command to be run before emulator startup. This can be used to set  breakpoints
              or  the  like.  Currently, this is the only method to input multi-line debugger commands. (See the
              <b>MONITOR/DEBUGGER</b> section for more information).

       <b>--detect-loader</b>
              Specify whether Fuse should attempt to detect when the tape is being accessed and start  and  stop
              the  virtual tape playing automatically. (Enabled by default, but you can use `<b>--no-detect-loader</b>'
              to disable). Same as the Media Options dialog's <u>Detect</u> <u>loaders</u> option.

       <b>--disciple</b>
              Emulate a DISCiPLE interface. Same as the Disk Peripherals  Options  dialog's  <u>DISCiPLE</u>  <u>interface</u>
              option.

       <b>--discipledisk</b> <u>file</u>
              Insert the specified file into the emulated DISCiPLE's drive 1.

       <b>--didaktik80</b>
              Emulate  a  Didaktik  80  (or  Didaktik  40)  disk interface. Same as the Disk Peripherals Options
              dialog's <u>Didaktik</u> <u>80</u> <u>interface</u> option.

       <b>--didaktik80disk</b> <u>file</u>
              Insert the specified file into the emulated Didaktik 80 (or Didaktik 40)'s drive A.

       <b>--disk-ask-merge</b>
              Prompt the user to confirm whether Fuse should try to merge the `B' side of a disk  image  from  a
              separate file when opening a new single-sided disk image.

       <b>--disk-try-merge</b> <u>mode</u>
              Select  whether Fuse should try to merge a separate file for the `B' side of a disk image separate
              file when opening a new disk image. Most double sided disk images are dumped as two  single  sided
              disk  images e.g.  `Golden Axe - Side A.dsk' and `Golden Axe - Side B.dsk'. So, if we want to play
              Golden Axe, first we have to insert the first disk image and when the game asks to insert  side B,
              we  have  to  find  and open the second disk image, instead of just `flip'-ing the disk inside the
              drive. If enabled, Fuse will try to open the second image too and create a double sided disk image
              (merging the two one sided disk images) and insert this merged virtual disk into the  disk  drive.
              The  function detects whether the file is one side of a double-sided image if the filename matches
              a pattern like [Ss]ide[ _][abAB12][ _.] in the file name of a disk that is being opened. If found,
              Fuse will try to open the other side of the disk too substituting the  appropriate  characters  in
              the  filename e.g.  1→2, a→b, A→B. If successful then it will merge the two images and now we have
              a double sided disk in drive. This means that if we open `Golden Axe - Side A.dsk', then Fuse will
              try to open `Golden Axe - Side B.dsk' too. Now, we can just `flip' the disk if Golden Axe asks for
              `Side B'.  The available options are <u>Never</u>, <u>With</u> <u>single-sided</u> <u>drives</u> and <u>Always</u>.

       <b>--divide</b>
              Emulate the DivIDE interface. The same as the Disk Peripherals Options dialog's  <u>DivIDE</u>  <u>interface</u>
              option.

       <b>--divide-masterfile</b> <u>file</u>
       <b>--divide-slavefile</b> <u>file</u>
              Specify an IDE image to be loaded into the DivIDE's emulated master and slave drives respectively.

       <b>--divide-write-protect</b>
              Specify  that the emulated DivIDE's write protect jumper should be considered set. The same as the
              Disk Peripherals Options dialog's <u>DivIDE</u> <u>write</u> <u>protect</u> option.

       <b>--divmmc</b>
              Emulate the DivMMC interface. The same as the Disk Peripherals Options dialog's  <u>DivMMC</u>  <u>interface</u>
              option.

       <b>--divmmc-file</b> <u>file</u>
              Specify an HDF image to be loaded into the DivMMC's emulated memory card.

       <b>--divmmc-write-protect</b>
              Specify  that the emulated DivMMC's write protect jumper that protects EEPROM should be considered
              set. The same as the Disk Peripherals Options dialog's <u>DivMMC</u> <u>write</u> <u>protect</u> option.

       <b>--dock</b> <u>file</u>
              Insert the specified file into the emulated Timex 2068 variant dock; also  select  the  TC2068  on
              startup if available.

       <b>-D</b> <u>mode</u>
       <b>--doublescan-mode</b> <u>mode</u>
              Specify whether to use doublescan modes in the FB UI.  Available values for <u>mode</u> are 0, 1 and 2. 0
              means `never doublescan' (use 640×480 at either 72 Hz or 60 Hz), whereas 1 and 2 both mean `try to
              use  doublescan' and will fall back on the 640×480 modes. 1 selects 72 Hz modes (the same size and
              shape as your typical 640×480), and 2 selects 60 Hz modes (overscan).

              If your monitor displays a blank screen when using 1 or 2, press F10 then try a  different  option
              or say `--fbmode 640'.

              Some examples of use:

              <b>fuse</b> <b>-d</b> <b>alsa09:dev=hw:1</b>

              causes Fuse to use ALSA 0.9+ output with the second (#1) sound card.

              <b>fuse</b> <b>-d</b> <b>raw:byteorder=little,file=enigma.raw</b>

              causes Fuse to save little endian words to `<u>enigma.raw</u>'.

              See  the  `DEVICE'  section of <u><a href="../man1/ogg123.1.html">ogg123</a>(1)</u> for up to date information of devices and options (except
              for the `file' option which is provided by Fuse itself).

              If you are using <u>libasound</u> or <u>ALSA</u> for sound output, the <u>device</u> parameter allows  you  to  specify
              the  device  used for sound output and some parameters to be used for that device. In general, the
              <u>device</u> parameter has the form
              <u>devstr</u> or
              <u>param[=value][,param[=value][,...][,devstr]</u>.

              •      <u>devstr</u>: selects the ALSA device used, it can be any complex or  simple  ALSA  device  name.
                     e.g.:  <u>default</u>  or  <u>hw:0</u>  or  <u>tee:plughw:0,'/tmp/out.raw',raw</u>.   See  the  alsa-lib pcm api
                     reference    at    <u><a href="http://www.alsa-project.org/alsa-doc/alsa-lib/pcm.html">http://www.alsa-project.org/alsa-doc/alsa-lib/pcm.html</a></u>    for    further
                     explanation.

              •      <u>param</u> and <u>values</u>:

                     •      <u>buffer=nnnn</u>:  set the ALSA buffer in frames, smaller value cause smaller sound delay
                            but may more buffer underrun (pops and clicks), larger value cause longer delay  but
                            fewer  underrun. By default Fuse determine the buffer size based on the actual sound
                            frequency.

                            If you use some special plugin for your pcm device (e.g.: dmix)  or  your  card  not
                            support  some needed parameter (e.g. cannot play other only 48 kHz stereo sound like
                            some AC97 sound card)  may  cause  Fuse  unable  to  set  the  needed  buffer  size,
                            appropriate  sound  frequency,  channels and so on, therefore you cannot get optimal
                            result or not hear the sound at all. In this case try the <u>plughw:#</u>,  (where  #  mean
                            your card number counted from 0) for ALSA device.

                     •      <u>verbose</u> : if given, fuse report ALSA buffer underruns to <u>stderr</u>.

              Some examples of use:

              <b>fuse</b> <b>-d</b> <b>verbose,buffer=2000</b>

              causes  Fuse  to  use the default ALSA device with 2000 frame length buffer and report ALSA buffer
              underruns on <u>stderr</u>.

              <b>fuse</b> <b>-d</b> <b>tee:plughw:0,'/tmp/aufwm.raw',raw</b>

              causes Fuse to use the first card and parallel save the  raw  audio  samples  into  <u>/tmp/aufwm.raw</u>
              file.

              If  you  are  using  <u>PulseAudio</u>  for sound output, the <u>device</u> parameter allows you to specify some
              parameters to be used for that soud buffer. In general, the <u>device</u> parameter has the form
              <u>param[=value][,param[=value][,...]</u>.

              •      <u>param</u> and <u>values</u>:

                     •      <u>tlength=[num]ms</u>: set target length of the PulseAudio sound buffer  in  milliseconds.
                            Smaller value cause smaller sound delay but more buffer underruns (pops and clicks),
                            larger  value cause longer delay but fewer underruns. By default Fuse set the buffer
                            size to 30ms of sound delay.

                     •      <u>tlength=num</u>: set target length of the PulseAudio sound buffer in bytes.  By  default
                            Fuse set the buffer size to 30ms of sound delay.

                     •      <u>verbose</u> : if given, Fuse report PulseAudio buffer underruns to <u>stderr</u> and PulseAudio
                            buffer options to <u>stdout</u>.

              Some examples of use:

              <b>fuse</b> <b>-d</b> <b>tlength=40ms</b>

              causes Fuse to target 40ms of sound delay instead of the default 30ms.

              <b>fuse</b> <b>-d</b> <b>verbose,tlength=2646</b>

              causes Fuse to request a sound buffer of 2646 bytes and print info to <u>stdout</u>.

       <b>--sound-force-8bit</b>
              Force the use of 8-bit sound, even if 16-bit is possible. Same as the Sound Options dialog's <u>Force</u>
              <u>8-bit</u> option.

       <b>-f</b> <u>frequency</u>
       <b>--sound-freq</b> <u>frequency</u>
              Specify  what  frequency  Fuse  should use for the sound device, the default is 44.1 kHz, but some
              devices only support a single frequency or a limited range (e.g.  48 kHz or up to 22 kHz).

       <b>--speaker-type</b> <u>type</u>
              Select the output speaker emulation, type can be TV speaker, Beeper or  Unfiltered.  Same  as  the
              Sound Options dialog's <u>Speaker</u> <u>type</u> option.

       <b>--spectranet</b>
              Specify  whether  Fuse  will  emulate  the  Spectranet  Ethernet  interface.   Same as the General
              Peripherals Options dialog's <u>Spectranet</u> option. See the  <b>SPECTRANET</b>  <b>EMULATION</b>  section  for  more

       <b>--spectranet-disable</b>
              This  option  controls  the  state  of  the  Spectranet automatic page-in jumper (J2). Same as the
              General Peripherals Options dialog's <u>Spectranet</u>  <u>disable</u>  option.  See  the  <b>SPECTRANET</b>  <b>EMULATION</b>
              section for more details.

       <b>--speed</b> <u>percentage</u>
              Specify  the  speed  (as a percentage of real Spectrum speed) at which emulation should attempt to
              proceed. Same as the General Options dialog's <u>Emulation</u> <u>speed</u> option.

       <b>--statusbar</b>
              For the GTK and Win32 UI, enables the statusbar beneath the display. For  the  Xlib  and  SDL  UI,
              enables the status icons showing whether the disk and tape are being accessed. Same as the General
              Options dialog's <u>Show</u> <u>statusbar</u> option.

       <b>--strict-aspect-hint</b>
              For the GTK UI, use stricter limits for the aspect ratio limits set by the `<b>--aspect-hint</b>' option.
              This  can  cause  some  window  managers  (for example, <u><a href="../man1/metacity.1.html">metacity</a></u>(1)) to not allow the window to be
              resized and moved, but is necessary to prevent others  (for  example,  <u><a href="../man1/fvwm.1.html">fvwm</a></u>(1))  from  being  able
              resize the window away from square.

       <b>--svga-modes</b> <u>mode1,mode2,mode3</u>
              Specify  which SVGA mode to use for the SVGAlib UI at different screen sizes. Available values for
              <u>mode1</u>, <u>mode2</u> and <u>mode3</u> are listed in a table, when Fuse called with <b>--svga-modes</b> <u>list</u> command line
              option.  When user select a not available mode for a size, Fuse just ignore and try  to  find  the
              best  mode for it. e.g. with <b>--svga-modes</b> <b>0,0,12</b> Fuse use the specified 1024×768×256 SVGA mode for
              triple size filters, but select SVGA modes automatically for normal or double size  filters.   The
              above  mode  number is just an example, and mode numbers and their meanings may vary graphics card
              by graphics card.

       <b>-t</b> <u>file</u>
       <b>--tape</b> <u>file</u>

       <b>--textfile</b> <u>file</u>
              Set the filename used for text output from  the  emulated  printers.  See  the  <b>PRINTER</b>  <b>EMULATION</b>
              section below for more details.

       <b>--traps</b>
              Support  traps  for  ROM tape loading/saving. (Enabled by default, but you can use `<b>--no-traps</b>' to

       <b>--unittests</b>
              This  option runs a testing framework that automatically checks portions of code, comparing actual
              results with expected ones. It is meant to detect broken code  before  a  release.  There  is  not
              graphical  mode,  the  program  just  ends  with exit code 0 if all tests are good or prints error
              messages to stdout and ends with exit code greater than 0 if there are failed tests.

</pre><h4><b>THE</b> <b>VARIOUS</b> <b>FRONT-ENDS</b></h4><pre>
       Fuse  supports  various  front-ends,  or UIs (user interfaces). The usual one is GTK-based, but there are
       also SDL, Win32, Xlib, SVGAlib and framebuffer ones.

       The important difference to note is that GTK and Win32 versions uses `native' dialog boxes etc. (behaving
       like a fairly normal GUI-based program) while the others use an alternative, Fuse-specific  `widget  UI'.
       This  latter  front-end  is  easily  spotted by the way it uses the main Fuse window/screen for menus and
       dialogs, and uses the Spectrum's own font.

</pre><h4><b>MENUS</b> <b>AND</b> <b>KEYS</b></h4><pre>
       Since many of the keys available are devoted to emulation of the Spectrum's keyboard, the primary way  of
       controlling  Fuse itself (rather than the emulated machine) is via the menus. There are also function key
       shortcuts for some menu options.

       In the GTK and Win32 version, the menu bar is always visible at the top of the Fuse window. You can click
       on a menu name to pop it up. Alternatively, you can press <u>F1</u> to display a pop-up version of the menu bar,
       which you can then navigate with the cursor keys or mouse.

       In the widget UI pressing <u>F1</u> is the only way to get the main  menu;  and  unlike  the  GTK  version,  the
       emulator  pauses  while  the  menus  are being navigated. The menus show which key to press for each menu
       option in brackets. Pressing <u>Esc</u> exits a menu, and pressing <u>Enter</u> exits the menu system entirely (as well
       as `confirming' any current dialog).

       Here's what the menu options do, along with the function key mappings for those items which have them:

       <u>F3</u>
       <u>File,</u> <u>Open...</u>
              Open a Spectrum file. Snapshots will be loaded into memory; tape images will be inserted into  the
              emulated  tape  deck,  and if the <u>Auto-load</u> <u>media</u> option is set will being loading. Opening a disk
              image or a Timex dock image will cause the appropriate machine type (+3, Pentagon or TC2068) to be
              selected with the image inserted, and disks will automatically load if the <u>Auto-load</u> <u>media</u>  option
              is set. See the <b>FILE</b> <b>SELECTION</b> section below for details on how to choose the file. Note that this
              behaviour is different from previous versions of Fuse, when this option would open only snapshots.

       <u>F2</u>
       <u>File,</u> <u>Save</u> <u>Snapshot...</u>
              Save  a snapshot (machine state, memory contents, etc.) to file. You can select the filename to be
              saved to. If it has a .szx, .z80 or .sna extension, the snapshot will be  saved  in  that  format.
              Otherwise, it will be saved as a .szx file.

       <u>File,</u> <u>Recording,</u> <u>Record...</u>
              Start  recording  input  to an RZX file, initialised from the current emulation state. You will be
              prompted for a filename to use.

       <u>File,</u> <u>Recording,</u> <u>Record</u> <u>from</u> <u>snapshot...</u>
              Start recording input to an RZX file, initialised from a snapshot. You will first be asked for the
              snapshot to use and then the file to save the recording to.

       <u>File,</u> <u>Recording,</u> <u>Continue</u> <u>recording...</u>
              Continue recording input into an existing  RZX  file  from  the  last  recorded  state.  Finalised
              recordings cannot be resumed. You will be prompted for the recording to continue.

       <u>Insert</u>
       <u>File,</u> <u>Recording,</u> <u>Insert</u> <u>snapshot</u>
              Inserts  a  snapshot  of the current state into the RZX file. This can be used at a later point to
              roll back to the inserted state by using one of the commands below.

       <u>Delete</u>
       <u>File,</u> <u>Recording,</u> <u>Rollback</u>
              Rolls back the recording to the point at which the previous snapshot was inserted. Recording  will
              continue from that point.

       <u>File,</u> <u>Recording,</u> <u>Rollback</u> <u>to...</u>
              Roll back the recording to any snapshot which has been inserted into the recording.

       <u>File,</u> <u>Recording,</u> <u>Play...</u>
              Playback recorded input from an RZX file. This lets you replay keypresses recorded previously. RZX
              files generally contain a snapshot with the Spectrum's state at the start of the recording; if the
              selected RZX file doesn't, you'll be prompted for a snapshot to load as well.

       <u>File,</u> <u>Recording,</u> <u>Stop</u>
              Stop any currently-recording/playing RZX file.

       <u>File,</u> <u>Recording,</u> <u>Finalise...</u>
              Compact  an  RZX  file.  Any  interspersed  snapshot  will  be removed and the recording cannot be
              continued. All action replays submitted to the RZX Archive should be finalised.

       <u>File,</u> <u>AY</u> <u>Logging,</u> <u>Record...</u>
              Start recording the bytes output via the AY-3-8912 sound chip to a PSG file. You will be  prompted
              for a filename to save the recording to.

       <u>File,</u> <u>AY</u> <u>Logging,</u> <u>Stop</u>
              Stop any current AY logging.

       <u>File,</u> <u>Screenshot,</u> <u>Open</u> <u>SCR</u> <u>Screenshot...</u>
              Load  an  SCR  screenshot (essentially just a binary dump of the Spectrum's video memory) onto the
              current screen. Fuse supports screenshots saved in the Timex hi-colour and hi-res modes as well as
              `normal' Spectrum screens, and will make a simple conversion if a hi-colour or  hi-res  screenshot
              is loaded onto a non-Timex machine.

       <u>File,</u> <u>Screenshot,</u> <u>Save</u> <u>Screen</u> <u>as</u> <u>SCR...</u>
              Save a copy of whatever's currently displayed on the Spectrum's screen as an SCR file. You will be
              prompted for a filename to save the screenshot to.

       <u>File,</u> <u>Screenshot,</u> <u>Open</u> <u>MLT</u> <u>Screenshot...</u>
              Load  an  MLT  screenshot onto the current screen. The MLT format is similar to the SCR format but
              additionally supports capturing images that use techniques to display more  than  two  colours  in
              each  Spectrum  attribute square. Fuse will only load the bitmap version of an image on a Sinclair
              machine but on a Timex clone it can show the full colour detail captured in the image by using the
              hi-colour mode.

       <u>File,</u> <u>Screenshot,</u> <u>Save</u> <u>Screen</u> <u>as</u> <u>MLT...</u>
              Save a copy of whatever's currently displayed on the Spectrum's screen as an MLT file. You will be
              prompted for a filename to save the screenshot to.

       <u>File,</u> <u>Screenshot,</u> <u>Save</u> <u>Screen</u> <u>as</u> <u>PNG...</u>
              Save the current screen as a PNG file. You will be prompted for a filename to save the  screenshot
              to.

       <u>File,</u> <u>Scalable</u> <u>Vector</u> <u>Graphics,</u> <u>Start</u> <u>capture</u> <u>in</u> <u>line</u> <u>mode...</u>
              Start  trapping  the  video output functions present in ROM to copy the picture to SVG files, thus
              creating vectorized scalable picture; it is expected to be fully operational in  BASIC  only,  but
              few  machine  code  programs could work, if they use the ROM addresses to output text or graphics.
              The initial picture size is 256×176, but it is increased everytime a `scroll'  happens.  On  every
              CLS a new file will be created, with an increasing sequence number. CIRCLEs will be described as a
              sequence  of lines, so the original `imprecisions' will be still visible.  The text output will be
              fully understood and decoded: normal ASCII characters will  be  converted  into  COURIER  scalable
              fonts,  UDG  graphics  into  dot  matrix  areas, GRAPHICS blocky characters into small squares.  A
              slightly transparent output permits to show a bit of the overlapped text  and  graphics  elements.
              Lower portion of the screen (normally bound to stream #0 and #1) won't be captured.

       <u>File,</u> <u>Scalable</u> <u>Vector</u> <u>Graphics,</u> <u>Start</u> <u>capture</u> <u>in</u> <u>dot</u> <u>mode...</u>
              As above, but line capture is disabled. A line will be rendered as a sequence of dots.

       <u>File,</u> <u>Scalable</u> <u>Vector</u> <u>Graphics,</u> <u>Stop</u> <u>capture</u>
              Stop the SVG capture function.

       <u>File,</u> <u>Movie,</u> <u>Record...</u>
              Fuse  can  record  movie  (video and audio) into a file with special format which can be converted
              later to a common video file format with the <u><a href="../man1/fmfconv.1.html">fmfconv</a></u>(1) utility.   You  will  be  prompted  for  a
              filename to save video. Please see <b>MOVIE</b> <b>RECORDING</b> section.

       <u>File,</u> <u>Movie,</u> <u>Record</u> <u>from</u> <u>RZX...</u>
              Start  movie  recording  and RZX playback at the same time. You will be prompted for a filename to
              play from and a filename to save video.

       <u>File,</u> <u>Movie,</u> <u>Pause</u>
              Pause movie recording which is currently in progress.

       <u>File,</u> <u>Movie,</u> <u>Continue</u>
              Resume movie recording which has been previously paused.

       <u>File,</u> <u>Movie,</u> <u>Stop</u>
              Stop movie recording which is currently in progress.

       <u>File,</u> <u>Load</u> <u>Binary</u> <u>Data...</u>
              Load binary data from a file into the Spectrum's memory. After selecting the  file  to  load  data
              from, you can choose where to load the data and how much data to load.

       <u>File,</u> <u>Save</u> <u>Binary</u> <u>Data...</u>
              Save  an  arbitrary chunk of the Spectrum's memory to a file. Select the file you wish to save to,
              followed by the location and length of data you wish to save.

       <u>F10</u>
       <u>File,</u> <u>Exit</u>
              Exit the emulator. A confirmation dialog will appear checking you actually want to do this.

       <u>F4</u>
       <u>Options,</u> <u>General...</u>
              Display the General Options dialog, letting you configure Fuse. (With  the  widget  UI,  the  keys
              shown  in  brackets toggle the options, <u>Enter</u> confirms any changes, and <u>Esc</u> aborts). Note that any
              changed settings only apply to the currently-running Fuse.

              The options available are:

              <u>Emulation</u> <u>speed</u>
                     Set how fast Fuse will attempt to emulate the Spectrum, as a percentage  of  the  speed  at
                     which  the  real  machine  runs.  If  your  machine  isn't  fast enough to keep up with the
                     requested speed, Fuse will just run as fast as it can. Note that if the emulation speed  is
                     faster than 500%, no sound output will be produced.

              <u>Frame</u> <u>rate</u>
                     Specify  the frame rate, the ratio of spectrum frame updates to real frame updates. This is
                     useful if your machine is having trouble keeping up with the spectrum screen updates.

              <u>Issue</u> <u>2</u> <u>keyboard</u>
                     Early versions of the Spectrum used a different value for unused bits on the keyboard input
                     ports, and a few games depended on the old  value  of  these  bits.  Enabling  this  option
                     switches to the old value, to let you run them.

              <u>Recreated</u> <u>ZX</u> <u>Spectrum</u>
                     Enable  the  use  of  a Recreated ZX Spectrum in `Layer A' (game) mode. This is a Bluetooth
                     keyboard that can be paired to the device where Fuse is running.

              <u>Use</u> <u>shift</u> <u>with</u> <u>arrow</u> <u>keys</u>
                     Treat the keyboard arrow keys as shifted like the ZX Spectrum+ keyboard's arrow keys or  as
                     unshifted like a cursor joystick that maps to the 5, 6, 7 and 8 keys.

              <u>Allow</u> <u>writes</u> <u>to</u> <u>ROM</u>
                     If  this  option  is  selected,  Fuse  will  happily allow programs to overwrite what would
                     normally be ROM. This probably isn't very useful in most circumstances, especially  as  the
                     48K ROM overwrites parts of itself.

              <u>Late</u> <u>timings</u>
                     If  selected,  Fuse  will cause all screen-related timings (for example, when the screen is
                     rendered and when memory contention occurs) to be one tstate later than “normal”, an effect
                     which is present on some real hardware.

              <u>Z80</u> <u>is</u> <u>CMOS</u>
                     If selected, Fuse will emulate a CMOS Z80, as opposed to an  NMOS  Z80.   The  undocumented
                     `OUT (C),0' instruction will be replaced with `OUT (C),255' and emulation of a minor timing
                     bug in the NMOS Z80's `LD A,I' and `LD A,R' instructions will be disabled.

              <u>RS-232</u> <u>handshake</u>
                     If  you  turn  this  option  off,  Fuse  assumes the RS-232 line other end is live when you
                     connect the communication channels.  See also the `<b>--rs232-rx</b>' and `<b>--rs232-tx</b>' options.

              <u>Black</u> <u>and</u> <u>white</u> <u>TV</u>
                     This option allows you  to  choose  whether  to  simulate  a  colour  or  black  and  white
                     television.  This is effective only under the GTK, Win32, Xlib and SDL user interfaces: the
                     others will always simulate a colour TV.

              <u>PAL-TV</u> <u>use</u> <u>TV2x</u> <u>effect</u>
                     This option allows you to choose whether the PAL TV 2x and higher  scalers  also  reproduce
                     scanlines in the same way as the TV 2x, TV 3x and Timex TV scalers.

              <u>Show</u> <u>statusbar</u>
                     For  the  GTK  and  Win32  UI,  enables  the statusbar beneath the display. For the SDL UI,
                     enables the status icons showing whether the disk and tape are being accessed. This  option
                     has no effect for the other user interfaces.

              <u>Snap</u> <u>joystick</u> <u>prompt</u>
                     If set, Fuse will prompt you which physical joystick or keyboard you want to connect to the
                     joystick  interface  enabled  in  the  snapshot  unless  it  already  matches  your current
                     configuration.

              <u>Confirm</u> <u>actions</u>
                     Specify whether `dangerous' actions  (those  which  could  cause  data  loss,  for  example
                     resetting the Spectrum) require confirmation before occurring.

              <u>Auto-save</u> <u>settings</u>
                     If this option is selected, Fuse will automatically write its currently selected options to
                     its configuration file on exit (either in xml format if <u>libxml2</u> was available when Fuse was
                     compiled  or  plain text). If this option is off, you'll have to manually use <u>Options,</u> <u>Save</u>
                     afterwards to ensure that this setting gets written to Fuse's configuration file. Note that
                     if you turn this option on, loading a snapshot  could  enable  peripherals  that  would  be
                     written permanently to the configuration file.

       <u>Options,</u> <u>Media...</u>
              Display  the Media Options dialog, letting you configure Fuse's tape and Microdrive options. (With
              the widget UI, the keys shown in brackets toggle the options, <u>Enter</u> confirms any changes, and  <u>Esc</u>
              aborts). Note that any changed settings only apply to the currently-running Fuse.

              <u>Auto-load</u> <u>media</u>
                     On many occasions when you open a tape or disk file, it's because it's got a program in you
                     want  to  load  and run. If this option is selected, this will automatically happen for you
                     when you open one of these files using the <u>File,</u> <u>Open...</u>  menu option — you must  then  use
                     the  <u>Media</u>  menu  to  use  tapes  or  disks for saving data to, or for loading data into an
                     already running program.

              <u>Detect</u> <u>loaders</u>
                     If this option is enabled, Fuse will attempt  to  detect  when  a  loading  routine  is  in
                     progress,  and  then  automatically  start the virtual tape to load the program in. This is
                     done by using a heuristic to identify a loading routine, so is by no means infallible,  but
                     works in most cases.

              <u>Phantom</u> <u>typist</u> <u>mode</u>
                     Specify the keystroke sequence that the "phantom typist" should use when starting a program
                     loading. Available options are

                            <u>Auto</u>

                            <u>Keyword</u>

                            <u>Keystroke</u>

                            <u>Menu</u>

                            <u>Plus</u> <u>2A</u>

                            <u>Plus</u> <u>3</u>

                     The  first  four of these correspond to automatic detection based on machine model, keyword
                     based entry, keystroke based entry, and selection from a 128K style menu.  <u>Plus</u> <u>2A</u> and <u>Plus</u>
                     <u>3</u> also correspond to selection from a 128K style menu, but have special handling for  games
                     which need to be loaded with `LOAD ""CODE'. The most likely use for this option will be use
                     <u>Keystroke</u> if you have changed the default 48K ROM for one with keystroke entry.

              <u>Fastloading</u>
                     If  this  option  is  enabled,  then  Fuse  will run at the fastest possible speed when the
                     virtual tape is playing, thus dramatically reducing the time it takes to load programs. You
                     may wish to disable this option if you wish to stop the tape at a specific point.

              <u>Use</u> <u>tape</u> <u>traps</u>
                     Ordinarily, Fuse intercepts calls to the ROM tape-loading routine in  order  to  load  from
                     tape  files  more  quickly when possible. But this can (rarely) interfere with TZX loading;
                     disabling this option avoids the problem at the cost  of  slower  (i.e.  always  real-time)
                     tape-loading.   When  tape-loading  traps  are  disabled,  you  need to start tape playback
                     manually, by pressing <u>F8</u> or choosing the <u>Media,</u> <u>Tape,</u> <u>Play</u> menu item. Fuse also  uses  tape
                     traps to intercept the tape-saving routine in the ROM to save tape files quickly, tapes can
                     also be saved using the <u>Media,</u> <u>Tape,</u> <u>Record</u> <u>Start</u> menu item.

              <u>Accelerate</u> <u>loaders</u>
                     If  this  option  is  enabled,  then Fuse will attempt to accelerate tape loaders by “short
                     circuiting” the loading loop. This will in general speed up loading,  but  may  cause  some
                     loaders to fail.

              <u>Use</u> <u>.slt</u> <u>traps</u>
                     The  multi-load  aspect  of  SLT  files  requires  a trap instruction to be supported. This
                     instruction is not generally used except for this trap, but since  it's  not  inconceivable
                     that a program could be wanting to use the real instruction instead, you can choose whether
                     to support the trap or not.

              <u>MDR</u> <u>cartridge</u> <u>len</u>
                     This  option  controls  the  number  of blocks in a new Microdrive cartridge.  If the value
                     smaller than 10 or greater than 254 Fuse assumes 10  or  254.   Average  real  capacity  is
                     around 180 blocks (90 Kb).

              <u>Random</u> <u>length</u> <u>MDR</u> <u>cartridge</u>
                     If  this  option is enabled, Fuse will use a random Microdrive cartridge length (around 180
                     blocks) instead of the length specified in the <u>MDR</u> <u>cartridge</u> <u>len</u> option.

       <u>Options,</u> <u>Sound...</u>
              Display the Sound Options dialog, letting you configure Fuse's sound output. (With the widget  UI,
              the  keys  shown in brackets toggle the options, <u>Enter</u> confirms any changes, and <u>Esc</u> aborts). Note
              that any changed settings only apply to the currently-running Fuse.

              <u>Sound</u> <u>enabled</u>
                     Specify whether sound output should be enabled at all. When this option is  disabled,  Fuse
                     will not make any sound.

              <u>Loading</u> <u>sound</u>
                     Normally,  Fuse  emulates  tape-loading noise when loading from PZXs, TAPs or TZXs in real-
                     time, albeit at a deliberately lower volume than on a real Spectrum. You can  disable  this
                     option to eliminate the loading noise entirely.

              <u>AY</u> <u>stereo</u> <u>separation</u>
                     By  default,  the  sound  output  is  mono,  since  this  is all you got from an unmodified
                     Spectrum. But enabling this option gives you so-called ACB stereo (for sound from  the  128
                     and other clone's AY-3-8912 sound chip).

              <u>Force</u> <u>8-bit</u>
                     Force the use of 8-bit sound even if 16-bit (the default) is available. Note that (when the
                     option  is  enabled)  if 8-bit sound isn't available then there will be no sound at all, so
                     it's best not to use this option unless you have a specific need for it.

              <u>Speaker</u> <u>type</u>
                     This option allows the emulation of the sound  output  system  to  be  modified.  Different
                     choices  of  speaker  limit  the  bass  and  treble  response that can be produced from the
                     machine. Choose between a “TV”  type  speaker  and  a  small  “Beeper”  type  speaker  that
                     significantly  limits  bass and treble response. Choose “Unfiltered” to get unmodified (but
                     less accurate) sound output.

              <u>AY</u> <u>volume</u>
                     Sets the relative volume of the AY-3-8912 chip from a range of 0–100%.

              <u>Beeper</u> <u>volume</u>
                     Sets the relative volume of the beeper from a range of 0–100%.

              <u>Covox</u> <u>volume</u>
                     Sets the relative volume of the Covox from a range of 0–100%.

              <u>SpecDrum</u> <u>volume</u>
                     Sets the relative volume of the SpecDrum from a range of 0–100%.

       <u>Options,</u> <u>Peripherals,</u> <u>General...</u>
              Display the General Peripherals Options dialog, letting you configure the peripherals  which  Fuse
              will  consider  to  be  attached  to  the emulated machine. (With the widget UI, the keys shown in
              brackets toggle the options, <u>Enter</u> confirms any changes, and <u>Esc</u> aborts). Note  that  any  changed
              settings  only  apply  to  the  currently-running Fuse. Also note that any changes that enable and
              disable peripherals may result in a hard reset of the emulated machine.

              <u>Kempston</u> <u>joystick</u>
                     If this option is selected, Fuse will emulate a Kempston joystick interface  (probably  the
                     most widely supported type on the Spectrum).  Note that this option is basically equivalent
                     to  plugging  the  interface  itself  into  a  Spectrum, not to connecting a joystick; this
                     affects how the Spectrum responds to a read of input port 31. To use a Kempston joystick in
                     a game, this option must be enabled, and you must  also  select  a  Kempston  joystick  the
                     <u>Options,</u> <u>Joysticks</u> menu.

              <u>Kempston</u> <u>mouse</u>
                     If this option is selected, Fuse will emulate a Kempston mouse interface.

                     If  you're  using  Fuse full-screen, your mouse is automatically used as if attached to the
                     Kempston interface. Otherwise, you'll need to click on the Spectrum  display  in  order  to
                     tell  Fuse  to  grab the pointer (and make it invisible); to tell Fuse to release it, click
                     the middle button (or wheel) or press Escape.

                     With the framebuffer UI, Fuse prefers to use GPM; if this is not available,  it  will  fall
                     back  to  built-in  PS/2  mouse support. In this mode, it tries <u>/dev/input/mice</u>, <u>/dev/mouse</u>
                     then <u>/dev/psaux</u>, stopping when it successfully opens one. The first of these  is  preferred
                     since  (at  least on Linux, with a 2.6-series kernel) any type of mouse can be used and any
                     connected mouse may be used.

              <u>Swap</u> <u>mouse</u> <u>buttons</u>
                     If this option is enabled, the left and right mouse buttons will be swapped when  emulating
                     a Kempston mouse.

              <u>Fuller</u> <u>Box</u>
                     If this option is selected, Fuse will emulate a Fuller Box AY sound and joystick interface.
                     This emulation is only available for the 16k, 48k and TC2048 machines.

              <u>Melodik</u>
                     If  this  option  is  selected,  Fuse  will  emulate  a  Melodik AY sound interface.  These
                     interfaces and many similar ones were produced to make the 48K Spectrum compatible with the
                     same AY music as the 128K Spectrum. This emulation is only available for the 16k,  48k  and
                     TC2048 machines.

              <u>Interface</u> <u>1</u>
                     If  this  option  is selected, Fuse will emulate the simple Sinclair Interface 1, and allow
                     Microdrive cartridges  to  be  connected  and  disconnected  via  the  <u>Media,</u>  <u>Interface</u> <u>1,</u>
                     <u>Microdrive</u> menus. It also enables support for the Interface 1 RS-232 interface.

              <u>Interface</u> <u>2</u>
                     If this option is selected, Fuse will emulate a cartridge port as found on the Interface 2.
                     Cartridges  can  then  be  inserted and removed via the <u>Media,</u> <u>Cartridge,</u> <u>Interface</u> <u>2</u> menu.
                     Note that the Pentagon, Scorpion, Interface 2, ZXATASP and ZXCF all use the  same  hardware
                     mechanism  for  accessing  some  of their extended features, so only one of these should be
                     selected at once or unpredictable behaviour will occur.

              <u>Multiface</u> <u>One</u>
                     If this option is selected, Fuse will emulate the Romantic Robot Multiface One.   Available
                     for 16K, 48K and Timex TC2048 machines.

              <u>Multiface</u> <u>128</u>
                     If  this  option is selected, Fuse will emulate the Romantic Robot Multiface 128. Available
                     for 16K, 48K, Timex TC2048, 128K, +2 and SE machines.

              <u>Multiface</u> <u>3</u>
                     If this option is selected, Fuse will emulate the Romantic Robot Multiface 3. Available for
                     +2A, +3 and +3e machines.

              <u>Stealth</u> <u>Multiface</u> <u>One</u>
                     This option controls the `invisible' or `stealth' mode of Multiface One,  as  the  physical
                     switch on the side of the interface.

              <u>Emulate</u> <u>printers</u>
                     If  this option is selected, Fuse will emulate a printer. See the <b>PRINTER</b> <b>EMULATION</b> section
                     for more details.

              <u>ZX</u> <u>Printer</u>
                     If this option is selected, Fuse will emulate the ZX Printer.  See  the  <b>PRINTER</b>  <b>EMULATION</b>
                     section for more details.

              <u>SpeccyBoot</u> <u>interface</u>
                     If this option is selected, Fuse will emulate a SpeccyBoot interface which allows booting a
                     ZX Spectrum    over    an    Ethernet   network.   See   the   SpeccyBoot   web   page   at

                     This emulation is only available for the 48k, 128k and TC2048 machines.

              <u>Spectranet</u>
                     If  this  option is selected, Fuse will emulate the Spectranet interface, which provides an
                     Ethernet interface for the Spectrum. See the <b>SPECTRANET</b> <b>EMULATION</b> section for more details.

              <u>Spectranet</u> <u>disable</u>
                     This option controls the state of the Spectranet automatic page-in  jumper  (J2).  See  the
                     <b>SPECTRANET</b> <b>EMULATION</b> section for more details.

              <u>TTX2000S</u>
                     If  this  option  is  selected,  Fuse will emulate the OEL/Volex TTX2000S teletext adaptor.
                     Available for the 16K and 48K  machines.  See  the  <b>TTX2000S</b>  <b>EMULATION</b>  section  for  more
                     details.

              <u>µSource</u>
                     If this option is selected, Fuse will emulate a Currah µSource interface.  See the World of
                     Spectrum  Infoseek web page at <u><a href="http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekid.cgi">http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekid.cgi</a>?id=1000080</u> for
                     the manual.

              <u>Covox</u> <u>interface</u>
                     If this option is selected, Fuse  will  emulate  a  Covox  digital  sound  interface.  This
                     emulation  is  only  available for the Pentagon, Pentagon 512k, Pentagon 1024k and Scorpion
                     machines. The Pentagon variants use port 0xfb and the Scorpion version uses port 0xdd.

       <u>Options,</u> <u>Peripherals,</u> <u>Disk...</u>
              Display the Disk Peripherals Options dialog, letting you configure the disk interface  peripherals
              which  Fuse  will  consider  to be attached to the emulated machine. (With the widget UI, the keys
              shown in brackets toggle the options, <u>Enter</u> confirms any changes, and <u>Esc</u> aborts). Note  that  any
              changed  settings only apply to the currently-running Fuse. Also note that any changes that enable
              and disable peripherals may result in a hard reset of the emulated machine.

              <u>Simple</u> <u>8-bit</u> <u>IDE</u>
                     If this option is selected, Fuse will emulate the simple 8-bit IDE interface as used by the
                     Spectrum +3e, and allow hard disks to be connected and disconnected  via  the  <u>Media,</u>  <u>IDE,</u>

              <u>Beta</u> <u>128</u> <u>interface</u>
                     If this option is selected, Fuse will emulate the Beta 128  interface.   See  the  <b>BETA</b> <b>128</b>
                     <b>EMULATION</b>  section  for  more  details.  Beta 128 emulation is enabled for the Pentagon and
                     Scorpion machines regardless of this option.

              <u>Beta</u> <u>128</u> <u>auto-boot</u> <u>in</u> <u>48K</u> <u>machines</u>
                     If this option is selected, then when a  Beta 128  interface  is  used  in  48K  or  TC2048
                     emulation, the machine will boot directly into the TR-DOS system.

              <u>Opus</u> <u>Discovery</u> <u>interface</u>
                     If  this  option is selected, Fuse will emulate the Opus Discovery interface.  See the <b>OPUS</b>
                     <b>DISCOVERY</b> <b>EMULATION</b> section for more details.

       <u>Options,</u> <u>RZX...</u>
              Display the RZX Options dialog, letting you configure how Fuse's deals with RZX input  recordings.
              (With  the  widget  UI, the keys shown in brackets toggle the options, <u>Enter</u> confirms any changes,
              and <u>Esc</u> aborts). Note that any changed settings only apply to the currently-running Fuse.

              <u>Create</u> <u>autosaves</u>
                     If this option is selected, Fuse will add  a  snapshot  into  the  recording  stream  every
                     5 seconds  while  creating  an  RZX  file, thus enabling the rollback facilities to be used
                     without having to explicitly add snapshots into the stream. Older snapshots will be  pruned
                     from  the  stream  to  keep the file size and number of snapshots down: each snapshot up to
                     15 seconds will be kept, then one snapshot every 15 seconds  until  one  minute,  then  one
                     snapshot  every  minute  until  5 minutes, and then one snapshot every 5 minutes. Note that
                     this “pruning”  applies  only  to  automatically  inserted  snapshots:  snapshots  manually
                     inserted into the stream will never be pruned.

              <u>Compress</u> <u>RZX</u> <u>data</u>
                     If  this  option  is selected, and <u>zlib</u> was available when Fuse was compiled, any RZX files
                     written by Fuse will be compressed. This is generally a good thing as it  makes  the  files
                     significantly  smaller,  and  you probably want to turn it off only if you're debugging the
                     RZX files or there's some other program which doesn't support compressed RZX files.

              <u>Competition</u> <u>mode</u>
                     Any input recordings which are started when  this  option  is  selected  will  be  made  in
                     `competition  mode'.  In  essence,  this means that Fuse will act just like a real Spectrum
                     would: you can't load snapshots, pause the emulation  in  any  way,  change  the  speed  or
                     anything that you couldn't do on the real machine. If any of these things are attempted, or
                     if  the  emulated Fuse is running more than 5% faster or slower than normal Spectrum speed,
                     then the recording will immediately be stopped.

                     If <u>libgcrypt</u> was available when Fuse was compiled, then recordings  made  with  competition
                     mode  active  will  be  digitally  signed, in theory to `certify' that it was made with the
                     above restrictions in place.  <b>However,</b> <b>this</b> <b>procedure</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>secure</b>  <b>(and</b>  <b>cannot</b>  <b>be</b>  <b>made</b>
                     <b>so),</b> <b>so</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> <b>signature</b> <b>on</b> <b>an</b> <b>RZX</b> <b>file</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>as</b> <b>providing</b> <b>proof</b>
                     <b>that</b>  <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>made</b> <b>with</b> <b>competition</b> <b>mode</b> <b>active.</b>  This feature is included in Fuse solely as
                     it was one of the requirements for Fuse to be used in an on-line tournament.

              <u>Competition</u> <u>code</u>
                     The numeric code entered here will be written into any RZX files made in competition  mode.
                     This  is  another  feature  for  on-line  tournaments which can be used to `prove' that the
                     recording was made after a specific code was released. If you're  not  playing  in  such  a
                     tournament, you can safely ignore this option.

              <u>Always</u> <u>embed</u> <u>snapshot</u>
                     Specify whether a snapshot should be embedded in an RZX file when recording is started from
                     an existing snapshot.

                     This  option  set the compression level to None, Lossless or High. (See the <b>MOVIE</b> <b>RECORDING</b>
                     section for more information).

              <u>Stop</u> <u>recording</u> <u>after</u> <u>RZX</u> <u>ends</u>
                     If this option is selected, Fuse will stop any movie recording after  an  RZX  playback  is
                     finished.

       <u>Options,</u> <u>Joysticks</u>
              Fuse  can  emulate many of the common types of joystick which were available for the Spectrum. The
              input for these emulated joysticks can be taken from real  joysticks  attached  to  the  emulating
              machine   (configured   via   the  <u>Options,</u>  <u>Joysticks,</u>  <u>Joystick</u> <u>1...</u>   and  <u>Options,</u>  <u>Joysticks,</u>
              <u>Joystick</u> <u>2...</u>  options), or from the <u>q</u>, <u>a</u>,  <u>o</u>,  <u>p</u>,  and  <u>Space</u>  keys  on  the  emulating  machines
              keyboard,  configured  via  the  <u>Options,</u> <u>Joysticks,</u> <u>Keyboard...</u>  option. Note that when using the
              keyboard to emulate a joystick, the <u>q</u>, <u>a</u>, <u>o</u>, <u>p</u>, and <u>Space</u> keys will not have their  normal  effect
              (to avoid problems with games which do things like use <u>p</u> for pause when using a joystick).

              Each  of  the  joysticks (including the `fake' keyboard joystick) can be configured to emulate any
              one of the following joystick types:

                     <u>None</u>
                            No joystick: any input will simply be ignored.

                     <u>Cursor</u>
                            A cursor joystick, equivalent to pressing <u>5</u> (left), <u>6</u> (down), <u>7</u> (up), <u>8</u> (right), and
                            <u>0</u> (fire).

                     <u>Kempston</u>
                            A Kempston joystick, read from input port 31. Note that  the  <u>Options,</u>  <u>Peripherals,</u>
                            <u>General,</u> <u>Kempston</u> <u>interface</u> option must also be set for the input to be recognised.

                     <u>Sinclair</u> <u>1</u>
                     <u>Sinclair</u> <u>2</u>
                            The  `left'  and  `right'  Sinclair  joysticks,  equivalent  to pressing <u>1</u> (left), <u>2</u>
                            (right), <u>3</u> (down), <u>4</u> (up), and <u>5</u> (fire), or <u>6</u> (left), <u>7</u> (right), <u>8</u> (down),  <u>9</u>  (up),
                            and <u>0</u> (fire) respectively.

                     <u>Timex</u> <u>1</u>
                     <u>Timex</u> <u>2</u>
                            The  `left'  and  `right' joysticks as attached to the Timex 2068 variant's built-in
                            joystick interface.

              For the real joysticks, it is also possible to configure what effect each button on  the  joystick
              will  have: this can be <u>Joystick</u> <u>Fire</u>, equivalent to pressing the emulated joystick's fire button,
              <u>Nothing</u>, meaning to have no effect, or any Spectrum key, meaning that pressing that button will be
              equivalent to pressing that Spectrum key.

       <u>Options,</u> <u>Select</u> <u>ROMs,</u> <u>Machine</u> <u>ROMs</u>
              An individual dialog is available  for  each  Spectrum  variant  emulated  by  Fuse  which  allows
              selection  of  the  ROM(s)  used  by that machine. Simply select the ROM you wish to use, and then
              reset the Spectrum for the change to take effect.

       <u>Options,</u> <u>Select</u> <u>ROMs,</u> <u>Peripheral</u> <u>ROMs</u>
              The same as the Machine ROMs menu, but an individual dialog is available for peripherals that need
              a ROM. Simply select the ROM you wish to use, and then reset the Spectrum for the change  to  take
              effect.

       <u>Options,</u> <u>Filter...</u>
              Select the graphics filter currently in use. See the <b>GRAPHICS</b> <b>FILTERS</b> section for more details.

       <u>F11</u>
       <u>Options,</u> <u>Full</u> <u>Screen</u>
              Switch Fuse between full screen and windowed mode.  This menu is only available under the SDL UI.

       <u>Options,</u> <u>Disk</u> <u>Options...</u>
              When  emulating disk drives, Fuse allows the specification of the physical drive units attached to
              the emulated interface. Each drive can be set to be one of the following types:

                     <u>Disabled</u>

                     <u>Single-sided</u> <u>40</u> <u>track</u>

                     <u>Double-sided</u> <u>40</u> <u>track</u>

                     <u>Single-sided</u> <u>80</u> <u>track</u>

                     <u>Double-sided</u> <u>80</u> <u>track</u>

              The <u>Disabled</u> option is not supported for Drive 1 or Drive A of any interface.

              The available options that can be set are:

              <u>+3</u> <u>Drive</u> <u>A</u>
                     Defaults to a single-sided 40 track drive.

              <u>+3</u> <u>Drive</u> <u>B</u>
                     Defaults to a double-sided 80 track drive.

              <u>+3</u> <u>Detect</u> <u>Speedlock</u>
                     Specify whether the +3 drives try to detect Speedlock protected disks, and  emulate  `weak'
                     sectors.   If  the  disk image file (EDSK or UDI) contains weak sector data, than Speedlock
                     detection is automatically omitted.  See also the <b>WEAK</b> <b>DISK</b> <b>DATA</b> section.

              <u>Beta</u> <u>128</u> <u>Drive</u> <u>A</u>
                     Defaults to a double-sided 80 track drive.

              <u>Beta</u> <u>128</u> <u>Drive</u> <u>B</u>
                     Defaults to a double-sided 80 track drive.

              <u>Beta</u> <u>128</u> <u>Drive</u> <u>C</u>
                     Defaults to a double-sided 80 track drive.

              <u>Beta</u> <u>128</u> <u>Drive</u> <u>D</u>
                     Defaults to a double-sided 80 track drive.

              <u>+D</u> <u>Drive</u> <u>1</u>
                     Defaults to a double-sided 80 track drive.

              <u>+D</u> <u>Drive</u> <u>2</u>
                     Defaults to a double-sided 80 track drive.

              <u>Didaktik</u> <u>80</u> <u>Drive</u> <u>A</u>
                     Defaults to a double-sided 80 track drive.

              <u>Didaktik</u> <u>80</u> <u>Drive</u> <u>B</u>
                     Defaults to a double-sided 80 track drive.

              <u>DISCiPLE</u> <u>Drive</u> <u>1</u>
                     Defaults to a double-sided 80 track drive.

              <u>DISCiPLE</u> <u>Drive</u> <u>2</u>
                     Defaults to a double-sided 80 track drive.

              <u>Opus</u> <u>Drive</u> <u>1</u>
                     Defaults to a single-sided 40 track drive.

              <u>Opus</u> <u>Drive</u> <u>2</u>
                     Defaults to a single-sided 40 track drive.

              <u>Try</u> <u>merge</u> <u>'B'</u> <u>side</u> <u>of</u> <u>disks</u>
                     This option prompts the user to confirm whether Fuse should try to merge the `B' side of  a
                     disk image from a separate file when opening a new single-sided disk image.

              <u>Confirm</u> <u>merge</u> <u>disk</u> <u>sides</u>
                     Select  whether  Fuse  should try to merge a separate file for the `B' side of a disk image
                     separate file when opening a new disk image. Most double sided disk images  are  dumped  as
                     two single sided disk images e.g.  `Golden Axe - Side A.dsk' and `Golden Axe - Side B.dsk'.
                     So,  if  we  want to play Golden Axe, first we have to insert the first disk image and when
                     the game asks to insert side B, we have to find and open the second disk image, instead  of
                     just  `flip'-ing  the  disk  inside the drive. If enabled, Fuse will try to open the second
                     image too and create a double sided disk image (merging the two one sided disk images)  and
                     insert  this merged virtual disk into the disk drive. The function detects whether the file
                     is one side of a double-sided image  if  the  filename  matches  a  pattern  like  [Ss]ide[
                     _][abAB12][ _.] in the file name of a disk that is being opened. If found, Fuse will try to
                     open the other side of the disk too substituting the appropriate characters in the filename
                     e.g.   1→2,  a→b,  A→B.  If  successful then it will merge the two images and now we have a
                     double sided disk in drive. This means that if we open `Golden Axe - Side A.dsk', then Fuse
                     will try to open `Golden Axe - Side B.dsk' too. Now, we can just `flip' the disk if  Golden
                     Axe  asks  for  `Side B'.   The  available  options are <u>Never</u>, <u>With</u> <u>single-sided</u> <u>drives</u> and
                     <u>Always</u>.

       <u>Options,</u> <u>Save</u>
              This will cause Fuse's current options to be written to <u>.fuserc</u> in your home directory  (Unix-like
              systems),  or  <u>fuse.cfg</u>  in your %USERPROFILE% folder (Windows), from which they will be picked up
              again when Fuse is restarted. The best way to update this file is by using this option, but it's a
              simple XML file if <u>libxml2</u> was available when Fuse  was  compiled  (otherwise,  plain  text),  and
              shouldn't be too hard to edit by hand if you really want to.

       <u>Pause</u>
       <u>Machine,</u> <u>Pause</u>
              Pause  or  unpause  emulation. This option is available only under the GTK and Win32 UIs; to pause
              the other user interfaces, simply press F1 to bring up the main menu.

       <u>F5</u>
       <u>Machine,</u> <u>Reset</u>
              Reset the emulated Spectrum.

       <u>Machine,</u> <u>Hard</u> <u>reset</u>
              Reset the emulated Spectrum. A hard reset is equivalent to turning the Spectrum's power  off,  and
              then turning it back on.

       <u>F9</u>
       <u>Machine,</u> <u>Select...</u>
              Choose  a type of Spectrum to emulate. An brief overview of the Sinclair, Amstrad and Timex can be

              <u>Spectrum</u> <u>16K</u>
              <u>Spectrum</u> <u>48K</u>
                     The original machines as released by Sinclair in 1982 with 16 or 48K of RAM respectively.

              <u>Spectrum</u> <u>48K</u> <u>(NTSC)</u>
                     The NTSC 48K machine released in limited numbers in parts of South America.

              <u>Spectrum</u> <u>128K</u>
                     The 128K machine as released by Sinclair in 1985 (Spain) or 1986 (UK).

              <u>Spectrum</u> <u>+2</u>
                     The first machine released by Amstrad, in 1986. From an emulation point of view, the +2  is
                     virtually identical to the 128K.

              <u>Spectrum</u> <u>+2A</u>
              <u>Spectrum</u> <u>+3</u>
                     The  two  machines  released  by  Amstrad  in 1988. Technically very similar to each other,
                     except that the +3 features a 3″ disk drive while the +2A does not.

              <u>Spectrum</u> <u>+3e</u>
                     A +3 with modified ROMs allowing access to IDE hard disks via the simple  8-bit  interface,
                     as     activated     from     the    <u>Options,</u>    <u>Peripherals,</u>    <u>Disk...</u>     dialog.    See

              <u>Timex</u> <u>TC2048</u>
              <u>Timex</u> <u>TC2068</u>
                     The variants of the Spectrum as released by Timex in Portugal.

              <u>Timex</u> <u>TS2068</u>
                     The variant of the Spectrum released by Timex in North America.

              <u>Pentagon</u> <u>128K</u>
                     Russian clone of the Spectrum. There were many different machines called Pentagon from 1989
                     to 2006, this machine corresponds to a 1991 era Pentagon 128K with the  optional  AY  sound
                     chip  and  the  integrated  Beta 128 disk interface, and is the version of the machine most
                     often     emulated.     More     technical      details      can      be      found      at
                     <u><a href="http://www.worldofspectrum.org/rusfaq/index.html">http://www.worldofspectrum.org/rusfaq/index.html</a></u>,

              <u>Pentagon</u> <u>512K</u>
              <u>Pentagon</u> <u>1024K</u>
                     Newer  versions  of  the Pentagon Russian Spectrum clones which incorporate more memory and
                     the “Mr Gluk Reset Service” ROM offering a more powerful firmware.

              <u>Scorpion</u> <u>ZS</u> <u>256</u>
                     Another   Russian   clone   of   the   Spectrum.   Some   details   can   be    found    at
                     <u><a href="http://www.worldofspectrum.org/rusfaq/index.html">http://www.worldofspectrum.org/rusfaq/index.html</a></u>.   Like  all the Russian clones, they have
                     built in 3.5″ disk drives, accessed  via  the  Beta 128  disk  interface  and  TR-DOS  (the
                     Technology  Research  Disk  Operating  System).  The  most  important  distinction from the
                     Pentagon 128k and similar machines is the display timing details.

              <u>Spectrum</u> <u>SE</u>
                     A recent variant designed by Andrew Owen and Jarek Adamski, which is possibly best  thought
                     of  as  a cross between the 128K machine and the Timex variants, allowing 272K of RAM to be
                     accessed.        Some         more         details         are         available         at

                     extended BASIC is available at <u>https://github.com/cheveron/sebasic4/wiki</u>.  The bug  tracker
                     for the BASIC is at <u>https://github.com/cheveron/sebasic4/issues?state=open</u>.

       <u>Machine,</u> <u>Debugger...</u>
              Start the monitor/debugger. See the <b>MONITOR/DEBUGGER</b> section for more information.

       <u>Machine,</u> <u>Poke</u> <u>Finder...</u>
              Start the `poke finder'. See the <b>POKE</b> <b>FINDER</b> section for more information.

       <u>Machine,</u> <u>Poke</u> <u>Memory...</u>
              Allow  one  to  use multiface POKEs for things such as infinite lives. See the <b>POKE</b> <b>MEMORY</b> section
              for more information.

       <u>Machine,</u> <u>Memory</u> <u>Browser...</u>
              Start the memory browser. It should be fairly obvious what this does; perhaps the only thing worth
              noting is that emulation is paused until you close the window.

       <u>Machine,</u> <u>NMI</u>
              Sends a non-maskable interrupt to the emulated Spectrum. Due to a typo in the  standard  48K  ROM,
              this  will cause a reset, but modified ROMs are available which make use of this feature. When the
              +D (or DISCiPLE) is emulated, this is used  to  access  the  +D  (or  DISCiPLE)'s  screenshot  and
              snapshot features (see the <b>+D</b> <b>EMULATION</b> and <b>DISCIPLE</b> <b>EMULATION</b> sections below).  For the DISCiPLE,
              Caps Shift must be held down whilst pressing the NMI button.  For some UIs, this may be tricky, or
              even  impossible  to do.  Note that GDOS on the DISCiPLE contains a bug which causes corruption of
              saved snapshots, and a failure to return from the NMI menu correctly.  This bug is not present  in
              G+DOS on the +D.

       <u>Machine,</u> <u>Multiface</u> <u>Red</u> <u>Button</u>
              Presses the Multiface One/128/3 red button to active the interface.

       <u>Machine,</u> <u>Didaktik</u> <u>SNAP</u>
              Presses the Didaktik 80 (or Didaktik 40)'s `SNAP' button.

       <u>F7</u>
       <u>Media,</u> <u>Tape,</u> <u>Open...</u>
              Choose  a PZX, TAP or TZX virtual-tape file to load from. See the <b>FILE</b> <b>SELECTION</b> section below for
              details on how to choose the file. If <u>Auto-load</u> <u>media</u> is set in the Media Options dialog (as it is
              by default), you may use the <u>File,</u> <u>Open...</u>  menu option instead, and the tape will  begin  loading
              automatically.  Otherwise, you have to start the load in the emulated machine (with LOAD "" or the
              128's Tape Loader option, though you may need to reset first).

              To <u>guarantee</u> that TZX files will load properly, you should select the file, make sure tape-loading
              traps  are  disabled  in  the Media Options dialog, then press <u>F8</u> (or do <u>Media,</u> <u>Tape,</u> <u>Play</u>).  That
              said, most TZXs will work with tape-loading traps enabled (often  quickly  loading  partway,  then
              loading the rest real-time), so you might want to try it that way first.

       <u>F8</u>
       <u>Media,</u> <u>Tape,</u> <u>Play</u>
              Start  playing  the PZX, TAP or TZX file, if required. (Choosing the option (or pressing <u>F8</u>) again
              pauses playback, and a further press resumes). To  explain  —  if  tape-loading  traps  have  been
              disabled (in the Media Options dialog), starting the loading process in the emulated machine isn't
              enough.  You also have to `press play', so to speak :-), and this is how you do that. You may also
              need to `press play' like this in certain other circumstances,  e.g.  TZXs  containing  multi-load
              games may have a stop-the-tape request (which Fuse obeys).

       <u>Media,</u> <u>Tape,</u> <u>Browse</u>
              Browse  through  the  current tape. A brief display of each of the data blocks on the current tape
              will appear, from which you can select which block Fuse will play next. With the GTK UI, emulation
              will continue while the browser is displayed; double-clicking on a block will select  it.  In  the
              other  UIs,  emulation  is paused and you can use the cursor keys and press <u>Enter</u> to select it. If
              you decide you don't want to change block, just press <u>Escape</u>.

       <u>Media,</u> <u>Tape,</u> <u>Rewind</u>
              Rewind the current virtual tape, so it can be read again from the beginning.

       <u>Media,</u> <u>Tape,</u> <u>Clear</u>
              Clear the current virtual tape. This is particularly useful when you want a `clean slate'  to  add
              newly-saved files to, before doing <u>Media,</u> <u>Tape,</u> <u>Write...</u>  (or <u>F6</u>).

       <u>F6</u>
       <u>Media,</u> <u>Tape,</u> <u>Write...</u>
              Write  the  current  virtual-tape contents to a TZX file. You will be prompted for a filename. The
              virtual-tape contents are the contents of the previously-loaded tape (if any has been loaded since
              you last did a <u>Media,</u> <u>Tape,</u> <u>Clear</u>), followed by anything you've saved from  the  emulated  machine
              since.  These newly-saved files are <u>not</u> written to any tape file until you choose this option!

       <u>Media,</u> <u>Tape,</u> <u>Record</u> <u>Start</u>
              Starts  directly recording the output from the emulated Spectrum to the current virtual-tape. This
              is useful when you want to record using a non-standard ROM or from a  custom  save  routine.  Most
              tape operations are disabled during recording. Stop recording with the <u>Media,</u> <u>Tape,</u> <u>Write...</u>  menu
              option.

       <u>Media,</u> <u>Tape,</u> <u>Record</u> <u>Stop</u>
              Stops the direct recording and places the new recording into the virtual-tape.

       <u>Media,</u> <u>Interface</u> <u>1</u>
              Virtual  Microdrive  images  are  accessible only when the Interface 1 is active from the <u>Options,</u>
              <u>Peripherals,</u> <u>General...</u>  dialog. Note that any changes to the Microdrive image will not be written
              to the file on disk until the appropriate save option is used.

       <u>Media,</u> <u>Interface</u> <u>1,</u> <u>Microdrive</u> <u>1,</u> <u>Insert</u> <u>New</u>
              Insert a new (unformatted) Microdrive cartridge into emulated Microdrive 1.

       <u>Media,</u> <u>Interface</u> <u>1,</u> <u>Microdrive</u> <u>1,</u> <u>Insert...</u>
              Insert an existing Microdrive cartridge image into emulated Microdrive 1. You will be prompted for
              a filename.

       <u>Media,</u> <u>Interface</u> <u>1,</u> <u>Microdrive</u> <u>1,</u> <u>Eject</u>
              Eject the Microdrive image in Microdrive 1. If the image has been modified, you will be  asked  as
              to whether you want any changes saved.

       <u>Media,</u> <u>Interface</u> <u>1,</u> <u>Microdrive</u> <u>1,</u> <u>Save</u>

       <u>Media,</u> <u>Interface</u> <u>1,</u> <u>Microdrive</u> <u>1,</u> <u>Save</u> <u>as...</u>
              Write the Microdrive image in Microdrive 1 to a file. You will be prompted for a filename.

       <u>Media,</u> <u>Interface</u> <u>1,</u> <u>Microdrive</u> <u>1,</u> <u>Write</u> <u>protect,</u> <u>Enable</u>
              Enable the write protect tab for the image in Microdrive 1.

       <u>Media,</u> <u>Disk</u>
              Virtual floppy disk images are accessible when emulating a +3, +3e, Pentagon or Scorpion, or  when
              the Beta 128, Opus Discovery, +D, Didaktik or DISCiPLE interface options are enabled and a machine
              compatible  with  the chosen interface is selected. (See <b>THE</b> <b>.DSK</b> <b>FORMAT</b>, <b>BETA</b> <b>128</b> <b>EMULATION</b>, <b>OPUS</b>

              notes on the file formats supported).

              Once again, any changes made to a disk image will not affect the file which  was  `inserted'  into
              the drive. If you do want to keep any changes, use the appropriate `eject and write' option before
              exiting Fuse.

       <u>Help,</u> <u>Keyboard...</u>
              Display a diagram showing the Spectrum keyboard, and the various keywords that  can  be  generated
              with each key from (48K) BASIC. Under the GTK and Win32 UIs, this will appear in a separate window
              and  emulation  continues.  With  the  other  UIs,  the picture remains onscreen (and the emulator
              paused) until you press <u>Esc</u> or <u>Enter</u>.

       <u>Help,</u> <u>About...</u>
              Show Fuse's version number.

</pre><h4><b>KEY</b> <b>MAPPINGS</b></h4><pre>
       When emulating the Spectrum, keys <u>F1</u> to <u>F10</u> are used as shortcuts for various menu  items,  as  described
       above.  The  alphanumeric  keys  (along  with <u>Enter</u> and <u>Space</u>) are mapped as-is to the Spectrum keys. The
       other key mappings are:

       <u>Shift</u>  emulated as Caps Shift

       <u>Control</u>, <u>Alt</u>, and <u>Meta</u>
              emulated as Symbol Shift (most other modifiers are also mapped to this)

       <u>Backspace</u>
              emulated as Caps–0 (Delete)

       <u>Esc</u>    emulated as Caps–1 (Edit)

       <u>Caps</u> <u>Lock</u>
              emulated as Caps–2

       <u>Cursor</u> <u>keys</u>
              emulated as Caps–5/6/7/8 (as appropriate)

       <u>Tab</u>    emulated as Caps Shift–Symbol Shift (Extended Mode)

       Some further punctuation keys are supported, if they exist on your keyboard — `<u>,</u>', `<u>.</u>',  `<u>/</u>',  `<u>;</u>',  `<u>'</u>',
       `<u>#</u>', `<u>-</u>', and `<u>=</u>'.  These are mapped to the appropriate symbol-shifted keys on the Spectrum.

       A  list  of  keys applicable when using the file selection dialogs is given in the <b>FILE</b> <b>SELECTION</b> section
       below.

</pre><h4><b>DISPLAY</b> <b>SIZE</b></h4><pre>
       Some of Fuse's UIs allow resizing of the emulated Spectrum's display.  For the  window-based  ones  (GTK,
       Win32  and  Xlib), you can resize the window by, well, resizing it. :-) Exactly how this works depends on
       your window manager; you may have to make the window over twice the width and height of the original size
       before it actually scales up. Fuse attempts to keep the window `square', but with  some  window  managers
       this can mean the window will never resize at all. If you experience this problem, the `<b>--no-aspect-hint</b>'
       option may help.

       If  you're using the SDL UI under X11 or GTK, the window will automatically resize to be the correct size
       for the graphics filter selected.

</pre><h4><b>GRAPHICS</b> <b>FILTERS</b></h4><pre>
       Fuse has the ability to apply essentially arbitrary filters between building its image of the  Spectrum's
       screen,  and  displaying  it  on the emulating machine's monitor. These filters can be used to do various
       forms of smoothing, emulation of TV scanlines and  various  other  possibilities.  Support  for  graphics
       filters  varies between the different user interfaces, but there are two general classes: the GTK, Win32,
       Xlib, SVGAlib and SDL user interfaces (and  the  saving  of  .png  screenshots)  support  `interpolating'
       filters  which  use a palette larger than the Spectrum's 16 colours, while the framebuffer user interface
       currently does not support filters at all.

       A further complication arises due to the fact that the Timex machines have  their  high-resolution  video
       mode  with  twice  the  horizontal  resolution. To deal with this, Fuse treats these machines as having a
       `normal' display size which is twice the size of a normal Spectrum's screen, leading to a  different  set
       of  filters  being available for these machines. Note that any of the double or triple-sizing filters are
       available for Timex machines only when using the SDL, Win32 or GTK user interfaces.

       The available filters, along with their short name used to select them from the command line, are:

       <u>Timex</u> <u>half</u> <u>(smoothed)</u> (<u>half</u>)
       <u>Timex</u> <u>half</u> <u>(skipping)</u> (<u>halfskip</u>)
              Two Timex-machine specific filters which scale the screen down to half normal (Timex)  size;  that
              is,  the same size as a normal Spectrum screen. The difference between these two filters is in how
              they handle the high-resolution mode: the `smoothed' version  is  an  interpolating  filter  which
              averages  pairs  of  adjacent  pixels,  while the `skipping' version is a non-interpolating filter
              which simply drops every other pixel.

       <u>Normal</u> (<u>normal</u>)
              The simplest filter: just display one pixel for every pixel on the Spectrum's screen.

       <u>Double</u> <u>size</u> (<u>2x</u>)
              Scale the displayed screen up to double size.

       <u>Triple</u> <u>size</u> (<u>3x</u>)
              Scale the displayed screen up to triple size. Available only with the GTK,  Win32,  Xlib  and  SDL
              user interfaces or when saving screenshots of non-Timex machines.

       <u>Quadruple</u> <u>size</u> (<u>4x</u>)
              Scale  the  displayed screen up to quadruple size. Available only with the GTK, Win32 and SDL user
              interfaces.

       <u>2xSaI</u> (<u>2xsai</u>)
       <u>Super</u> <u>2xSaI</u> (<u>super2xsai</u>)
       <u>SuperEagle</u> (<u>supereagle</u>)
              Three interpolating filters which apply successively more smoothing. All three double the size  of
              the displayed screen.

       <u>AdvMAME2x</u> (<u>advmame2x</u>)
              A double-sizing, non-interpolating filter which attempts to smooth diagonal lines.

       <u>AdvMAME3x</u> (<u>advmame3x</u>)
              Very similar to <u>AdvMAME2x</u>, except that it triples the size of the displayed screen. Available only
              with  the  GTK,  Win32,  Xlib  and  SDL  user  interfaces  or when saving screenshots of non-Timex
              machines.

       <u>TV</u> <u>2x</u> (<u>tv2x</u>)
       <u>TV</u> <u>3x</u> (<u>tv3x</u>)
       <u>TV</u> <u>4x</u> (<u>tv4x</u>)
       <u>Timex</u> <u>TV</u> (<u>timextv</u>)
              Four filters which attempt to emulate the effect of television scanlines. The first is  a  double-
              sizing filter for non-Timex machines, the second is a similar triple-sizing filter, the third is a
              similar quadruple-sizing filter, while the last is a single-sizing filter for Timex machines (note
              that this means TV 2X and Timex TV produce the same size output).

       <u>PAL</u> <u>TV</u> (<u>paltv</u>)
       <u>PAL</u> <u>TV</u> <u>2x</u> (<u>paltv2x</u>)
       <u>PAL</u> <u>TV</u> <u>3x</u> (<u>paltv3x</u>)
       <u>PAL</u> <u>TV</u> <u>4x</u> (<u>paltv4x</u>)
              Four  filters  which  attempt  to  emulate  the  effect of the PAL TV system which layers a lower-
              resolution colour image over the top of a higher-resolution black-and-white image. The filters can
              also optionally add scanlines like the other TV series scalers.

       <u>Dot</u> <u>matrix</u> (<u>dotmatrix</u>)
              A double-sizing filter which emulates the effect of a dot-matrix display.

       <u>Timex</u> <u>1.5x</u> (<u>timex15x</u>)
              An interpolating Timex-specific filter which scales the Timex screen up to  1.5×  its  usual  size
              (which  is therefore 3× the size of a `normal' Spectrum screen). Available only for the GTK, Win32
              and SDL user interfaces or when saving screenshots.

       <u>Timex</u> <u>2x</u> (<u>timex2x</u>)
              A non-interpolating Timex-specific filter which scales the Timex screen up to 2×  its  usual  size
              (which  is therefore 4× the size of a `normal' Spectrum screen). Available only for the GTK, Win32
              and SDL user interfaces or when saving screenshots.

       <u>HQ</u> <u>2x</u> (<u>hq2x</u>)
       <u>HQ</u> <u>3x</u> (<u>hq3x</u>)
       <u>HQ</u> <u>4x</u> (<u>hq4x</u>)
              Three filters which do high quality (but slow) antialiasing. Doubles and  triples  and  quadruples
              the size of the displayed screen respectively.

</pre><h4><b>THE</b> <b>EMULATED</b> <b>SPECTRUM</b></h4><pre>
       The  emulated  Spectrum  is,  by  default,  an  unmodified 48K Spectrum with a tape player and ZX Printer
       attached. Oh, and apparently some magical snapshot load/save machine which is probably best glossed  over
       for the sake of the analogy. :-)

       To emulate different kinds of Spectrum, select the <u>Machine,</u> <u>Select...</u>  menu option, or press <u>F9</u>.

       The  Spectrum  emulation is paused when any dialogs appear. In the widget UI, it's also paused when menus
       or the keyboard picture are displayed.

</pre><h4><b>PRINTER</b> <b>EMULATION</b></h4><pre>
       The various models of Spectrum supported a range  of  ways  to  connect  printers,  three  of  which  are
       supported by Fuse. Different printers are made available for the different models:

       <u>16</u>, <u>48</u>, <u>TC2048</u>, <u>TC2068</u>, <u>TS2068</u>
              ZX Printer

       <u>128</u>/<u>+2</u>/<u>Pentagon</u>
              Serial printer (text-only)

       <u>+2A</u>, <u>+3</u>
              Parallel printer (text-only)

       If  Opus  Discovery,  +D  or  DISCiPLE  emulation  is  in use and printer emulation is enabled, text-only
       emulation of the disk interface's parallel printer interface is provided.

       Any printout is appended to one (or both) of two files, depending on  the  printer  —  these  default  to
       <u>printout.txt</u>  for  text  output,  and  <u>printout.pbm</u>  for graphics (PBM images are supported by most image
       viewers and converters). These names can be changed with the <b>--textfile</b> and <b>--graphicsfile</b>  options  from
       the  command line or configuration file. While the ZX Printer can <u>only</u> output graphically, simulated text
       output is generated at the same time using a crude sort of OCR based on the current character set (a  bit
       like  using  SCREEN$).  There is currently no support for graphics when using the serial/parallel output,
       though any escape codes used will be `printed' faithfully. (!)

       By the way, it's not a good idea to modify the <u>printout.pbm</u> file outside of Fuse if you want to  continue
       appending  to  it. The header needs to have a certain layout for Fuse to be able to continue appending to
       it correctly, and the file will be overwritten if it can't be appended to.

</pre><h4><b>ZXATASP</b> <b>AND</b> <b>ZXCF</b></h4><pre>
       The ZXATASP and ZXCF interfaces are two peripherals designed by Sami Vehmaa  which  significantly  extend
       the   capabilities   of  the  Spectrum.  More  details  on  both  are  available  from  Sami's  homepage,
       <u><a href="http://user.tninet.se/~vjz762w/">http://user.tninet.se/~vjz762w/</a></u>, but a brief overview is given here.

       The real ZXATASP comes with either 128K or 512K of RAM and the ability to connect an IDE hard disks and a
       CompactFlash card, while the ZXCF comes with 128K, 512K or 1024K of RAM and  the  ability  to  connect  a
       CompactFlash  card.  From  an  emulation point of view, the two interfaces are actually very similar as a
       CompactFlash card is logically just an IDE hard disk. Currently, Fuse's emulation is fixed at having 512K
       of RAM in the ZXATASP and 1024K in the ZXCF.

       To activate the ZXATASP, simply select the  <u>ZXATASP</u>  <u>interface</u>  option  from  the  <u>Options,</u>  <u>Peripherals,</u>
       <u>Disk...</u>   dialog.  The  state  of  the upload and write protect jumpers is then controlled by the <u>ZXATASP</u>
       <u>upload</u> and <u>ZXATASP</u> <u>write</u> <u>protect</u> options. Similarly, the ZXCF is controlled by  the  <u>ZXCF</u>  <u>interface</u>  and
       <u>ZXCF</u> <u>upload</u> options (the ZXCF write protect is software controlled).

       If  you're  using  either  the  ZXATASP  or  ZXCF,  you almost certainly want to investigate ResiDOS, the
       operating system designed for use with the ZXATASP and ZXCF. ResiDOS provides facilities  for  using  the
       extra  RAM,  accessing  the  mass storage devices and a task manager allowing virtually instant switching
       between programs on the Spectrum. See <u><a href="http://www.worldofspectrum.org/residos/">http://www.worldofspectrum.org/residos/</a></u> for more details.

</pre><h4><b>DIVIDE</b></h4><pre>
       The DivIDE is  another  IDE  interface  for  the  Spectrum,  of  which  full  details  can  be  found  at
       <u><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20150302052256/http">http://web.archive.org/web/20150302052256/http</a>://baze.au.com/divide/</u>.  The interface can be activated via
       the  <u>DivIDE</u>  <u>interface</u>  option from the <u>Options,</u> <u>Peripherals,</u> <u>Disk...</u>  dialog, and the state of its write
       protect jumper controlled via the <u>DivIDE</u> <u>write</u> <u>protect</u> <u>option</u>.  If you're going to be using  the  DivIDE,
       you'll probably want one of the firmwares available from the DivIDE homepage.

</pre><h4><b>DIVMMC</b></h4><pre>
       The  DivMMC  is  a  MMC  interface  for the Spectrum. Originally designed by Alessandro Dorigatti for the
       V6Z80P+ FPGA board as the fusion of DivIDE and ZXMMC+ interfaces, later assembled  as  an  interface  for
       real spectrums by Mario Prato. Currently there are variants with different RAM size, one/two memory cards
       slots, optional kempston jostick, etc.

       The  interface  can  be  activated via the <u>DivMMC</u> <u>interface</u> option from the <u>Options,</u> <u>Peripherals,</u> <u>Disk...</u>
       dialog, and the state of its EEPROM write protect jumper controlled via the <u>DivMMC</u> <u>write</u> <u>protect</u>  <u>option</u>.
       If you're going to be using the DivMMC, you'll need to load the ESXDOS firmware at <u><a href="http://www.esxdos.org/">http://www.esxdos.org/</a></u>
       or use the ZX Spectrum +3e ROMs by Garry Lancaster.

       You'll also need a HDF image to store the contents of the memory card.  There are several tools to create
       and manipulate this file format, e.g., hdfmonkey at <u>https://github.com/gasman/hdfmonkey</u>.

</pre><h4><b>SPECTRANET</b> <b>EMULATION</b></h4><pre>
       The Spectranet is an Ethernet network interface for the ZX Spectrum by Dylan Thomas. The interface can be
       activated via the <u>Spectranet</u> option on the Peripherals preferences dialog, and the state of its automatic
       page-in  (disable)  jumper  controlled via the <u>Spectranet</u> <u>disable</u> option. If you're going to be using the
       Spectranet,  you'll  probably  want  one  of  the  firmwares  available  from  the  Spectranet   homepage
       (<u><a href="http://spectrum.alioth.net/doc/index.php">http://spectrum.alioth.net/doc/index.php</a></u>) which is also where you can find more information on using the
       interface.

       Installing  the  Spectranet  firmware on Fuse is slightly more complicated than on a real machine, mostly
       because Fuse's emulation doesn't support DHCP. These instructions are  correct  as  of  2012-01-26  —  if
       you're using a later firmware than this, things may have changed slightly.

       The  first  thing  you will need to do is to obtain a copy of the Spectranet installer as a .tap file (or
       similar). The installer is also available at the Spectranet site above.

       Once you have a copy of the installer, start Fuse and  tick  the  <u>Spectranet</u>  option  from  the  <u>Options,</u>
       <u>Peripherals,</u>  <u>General...</u>  dialog, and the state of its write protect jumper controlled via the <u>Spectranet</u>
       <u>disable</u> option. Once that's done, open the installer file (use the <u>Media,</u> <u>Tape,</u> <u>Open...</u>   command  rather
       than <u>File,</u> <u>Open...</u>  to prevent autoloading) and enter the following commands from BASIC:

       CLEAR 26999
       LOAD "" CODE
       RANDOMIZE USR 27000

       The  screen  should  turn  blue  and  you'll  see around 20 lines of message appearing as the firmware is
       installed, starting with “Erasing sector 0” and finishing with “Restoring page B”,  and  you'll  get  the
       familiar 0 OK, 0: 1 at the bottom of the screen.

       Now  untick the <u>Spectranet</u> <u>disable</u> option from the <u>Options,</u> <u>Peripherals,</u> <u>General...</u>  dialog and reset the
       Spectrum. You should see a very brief blue status screen, before the  regular  copyright  screen  appears
       with  some  Spectranet  information at the top — there should be four status lines, starting with “Alioth
       Spectranet” and ending with the Spectranet's IP address (which will be 255.255.255.255 at this stage).

       Now trigger an NMI (the Machine / NMI menu option) and you should get a white on blue Spectranet NMI menu
       with five options.

       Select [A] Configure network settings — this should lead you to another menu, which will  scroll  of  the
       top of the screen; don't worry about this for now.

       You'll now need to set various options:

       [A] Enable/disable DHCP — select N
       [B] Change IP address — enter the IP address of the machine you are running Fuse on.
       [C] Change netmask — enter the appropriate netmask for the IP address you selected above. If that doesn't
       mean anything to you, try 255.255.255.0
       [D]  Change default gateway — enter the appropriate gateway address.  If you don't know any better, enter
       the IP address of your router.
       [E] Change primary DNS — enter the address of your DNS server. If you don't know any better, use Google's
       public DNS server, 8.8.8.8.

       There is no need to change options [F] or [G], but do select:

       [H] Change hostname — enter a hostname for the Spectranet-enabled machine. It doesn't really matter  what
       you  enter  here  —  it's  mostly useful just to replace the junk default name so you can see what you've
       entered for the other settings.

       Your screen should now look something like this:

       Current configuration
       ───────────────────────────────────────
       Use DHCP           : No
       IP address         : 192.168.000.002
       Netmask            : 255.255.255.000
       Default gateway    : 192.168.000.001
       Primary DNS        : 192.168.000.001
       Secondary DNS      : 255.255.255.255
       Hardware address   : FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF
       Hostname           : fuse
       &lt;menu options&gt;

       If  everything  looks  correct,  select  [I]  Save  changes  and  exit  (you'll  see  a   brief   “Saving
       configuration...” message) followed by [E] Exit, at which point you'll be returned to BASIC.

       Now type the following commands:

       %cfgnew
       %cfgcommit

       Which will show the standard 0 OK, 0:1 at the bottom of the screen.

       Reset  the  Spectrum  again  and you'll see the same four line status display, but this time with your IP
       address on the last line.

       Congratulations! You have now installed the Spectranet firmware. To save having to go  through  all  that
       every  time  you  start Fuse, save a .szx snapshot at this point, and load that in every time you want to
       use the Spectranet.

</pre><h4><b>TTX2000S</b> <b>EMULATION</b></h4><pre>
       Fuse supports emulating the OEL/Volex TTX2000S teletext adaptor with 16K and 48K machines.

       The interface has four tuning presets and extracts teletext signals from the vertical  blanking  interval
       of  the selected television channel.  These teletext signals are emulated by means of a simple TCP socket
       interface provided by an external server application. An example server written in  Python  is  available
       from <u>https://github.com/ZXGuesser/teletext-packet-server</u>

       The  default  address  for the four packet servers is 127.0.0.1 (loopback address), ports 19761 to 19764.
       Connections can also be made to other computers on a fast LAN by IP address  or  hostname.  Connecting  a
       packet server via the internet is not recommended.

       Only  one  connection  is  active at a time. Changing channel preset on the emulated interface closes any
       active connection and opens a new connection to the appropriate server. The same packet server can be set
       for multiple tuning presets.

       Note that a limitation of the TTX2000S ROM means that it only decodes the first 12 lines  of  a  teletext
       signal.  This  can be fixed by entering BASIC and executing `POKE 23394,33' then re-entering the teletext
       ROM with `RANDOMIZE USR 23500'. Alternatively just use teletext packet sources with 12 lines per field or
       fewer.

</pre><h4><b>FILE</b> <b>SELECTION</b></h4><pre>
       The way you select a file (whether snapshot or tape file) depends on which UI you're using.  So  firstly,
       here's how to use the GTK file selector.

       The  selector  shows  the  directories  and files in the current directory in two separate subwindows. If
       either list is too big to fit in the window, you can use the scrollbar to see the rest (by  dragging  the
       slider,  for  example),  or you can use <u>Shift–Tab</u> (to move the keyboard focus to a subwindow) and use the
       cursor keys.  To change directory, double-click it.

       To choose a file to load you can either double-click it, or click it then click <u>Ok</u>.  Or click  <u>Cancel</u>  to
       abort.

       If  you're using the keyboard, probably the easiest way to use the selector is to just ignore it and type
       in the name. This isn't as irksome as it sounds, since the filename input box has filename  completion  —
       type  part of a directory or file name, then press <u>Tab</u>.  It should complete it. If it was a directory, it
       moves to that directory; if the completion was ambiguous, it completes as much as possible,  and  narrows
       the  filenames  shown  to  those  which  match.  You  should  press <u>Enter</u> when you've finished typing the
       filename, or <u>Esc</u> to abort.

       Now, if you're using the widget UI — the one  using  the  Spectrum  font  —  the  selector  works  a  bit
       differently. The files and directories are all listed in a single two-column-wide window (the directories
       are shown at the top, ending in `/') — the names may be truncated onscreen if they're too long to fit.

       To  move  the  cursor,  you  can  either  use  the  cursor  keys, or the Spectrum equivalents <u>5</u>/<u>6</u>/<u>7</u>/<u>8</u>, or
       (similarly) <u>h</u>/<u>j</u>/<u>k</u>/<u>l</u>. For faster movement, the <u>Page</u> <u>Up</u>, <u>Page</u> <u>Down</u>, <u>Home</u>, and <u>End</u> keys are supported and do
       what you'd expect. To select a file or directory, press <u>Enter</u>.  To abort, press <u>Esc</u>.

       With both selectors, do bear in mind that <u>all</u> files are shown, whether Fuse would be able to load them or
       not.

</pre><h4><b>MONITOR/DEBUGGER</b></h4><pre>
       Firstly, note that the vast majority of this section applies only if you're using the GTK user interface;
       if you're using one of the widget user interfaces, you'll get  a  very  basic  monitor  which  shows  the
       current values of the registers and allows you to single step through execution or continue.

       If  you  are  using  the  GTK user interface, Fuse features a moderately powerful, completely transparent
       monitor/debugger, which can be activated via the <u>Machine,</u> <u>Debugger...</u>  menu  option.  A  debugger  window
       will  appear,  showing  the  current state of the emulated machine: the top-left `pane' shows the current
       state of the Z80 and the last bytes written to any emulated peripherals. The bottom-left pane  lists  any
       active  breakpoints. Moving right, the next pane shows where the Spectrum's 64K memory map (the `<u>W?</u>'  and
       `<u>C?</u>'  indicate whether each displayed chunk is writable or  contended  respectively).   Fuse  tracks  the
       memory  mapping of the overall address space in 2KB chunks but will summarise the mapped pages where they
       are part of the same page of the underlying memory source (e.g. 8KB page sizes in the Spectrum  128K  and
       4KB pages in the Timex clones' DOCK and EXROM banks).

       The  next  pane  to  the right has a disassembly, which by default starts at the current program counter,
       although this can be modified either by  the  `disassemble'  command  (see  below)  or  by  dragging  the
       scrollbar  next  to  it. The next pane shows the current stack, and the final pane any `events' which are
       due to occur and could affect emulation. Any of these panes can be removed by use of the <u>View</u> menu. Below
       the displays are an entry box for debugger commands, and five buttons for controlling the debugger:

       <u>Evaluate</u>
              Evaluate the command currently in the entry box.

       <u>Single</u> <u>Step</u>
              Run precisely one Z80 opcode and then stop emulation again.

       <u>Continue</u>
              Restart emulation, but leave the debugger window open. Note that the debugger window will  not  be
              updated while emulation is running.

       <u>Break</u>
              Stop emulation and return to the debugger.

       <u>Close</u>
              Close the debugger window and restart emulation.

       Double-clicking  on  an  entry  in  the  stack pane will cause emulation to run until the program counter
       reaches the value stored at that address, while double-clicking on an entry in  the  `events'  pane  will
       cause emulation to run until that time is reached.

       The  main  power  of  the  debugger  is via the commands entered into the entry box, which are similar in
       nature (but definitely not identical to or as powerful as) to those in <u><a href="../man1/gdb.1.html">gdb</a></u>(1).  In general, the  debugger
       is  case-insensitive,  and  numbers will be interpreted as decimal, unless prefixed by either `<u>0x</u>' or `<u>$</u>'
       when they will be interpreted as hex. Each command can be abbreviated to the portion not in curly braces.

       ba{se} <u>number</u>
              Change the debugger window to displaying output in base <u>number</u>.  Available values are 10 (decimal)
              or 16 (hex).

       br{eakpoint} [<u>address</u>] [if <u>condition</u>]
              Set a breakpoint to stop emulation and return to the debugger whenever an opcode  is  executed  at
              <u>address</u>  and  <u>condition</u> evaluates true. If <u>address</u> is omitted, it defaults to the current value of
              PC.

       br{eakpoint} p{ort} (re{ad}|w{rite}) <u>port</u> [if <u>condition</u>]
              Set a breakpoint to trigger whenever IO port <u>port</u>  is  read  from  or  written  to  and  <u>condition</u>
              evaluates true.

       br{eakpoint} (re{ad}|w{rite}) [<u>address</u>] [if <u>condition</u>]
              Set  a  breakpoint  to  trigger  whenever  memory location <u>address</u> is read from (other than via an
              opcode fetch) or written to and <u>condition</u> evaluates true.  <u>Address</u> again defaults to  the  current
              value of PC if omitted.

       br{eakpoint} ti{me} <u>time</u> [if <u>condition</u>]
              Set  a  breakpoint  to  occur  <u>time</u> tstates after the start of the every frame, assuming <u>condition</u>
              evaluates true (if one is given).

       br{eakpoint} ev{ent} <u>area</u>:<u>detail</u> [if <u>condition</u>]
              Set a breakpoint to occur when the event specified by <u>area</u>:<u>detail</u> occurs and  <u>condition</u>  evaluates
              to true. The events which can be caught are:

              beta128:page

              zxcf:unpage
                     The ZXCF interface is paged into or out of memory.

              In all cases, the event can be specified as <u>area</u>:* to catch all events from that area.

       cl{ear} [<u>address</u>]
              Remove  all  breakpoints  at  <u>address</u>  or  the  current  value  of  PC if <u>address</u> is omitted. Port
              read/write breakpoints are unaffected.

       com{mmands} <u>id</u> <u>&lt;newline&gt;</u>
       <u>&lt;debugger</u> <u>command&gt;</u> <u>&lt;newline&gt;</u>
       <u>&lt;debugger</u> <u>command&gt;</u> <u>&lt;newline&gt;</u>
       <u>...</u>
       end
              Set things such  that  the  specified  debugger  commands  will  be  automatically  executed  when
              breakpoint  <u>id</u> is triggered. There is currently no user interface for entering multi-line debugger
              commands,  so  the  only  way  to  specify  this  command  is  on   the   command-line   via   the
              <b>--debugger-command</b> option.

       cond{ition} <u>id</u> [<u>condition</u>]
              Set  breakpoint  <u>id</u>  to  trigger  only  when <u>condition</u> is true, or unconditionally if <u>condition</u> is
              omitted.

       co{ntinue}
              Equivalent to the <u>Continue</u> button.

       del{ete} [<u>id</u>]
              Remove breakpoint <u>id</u>, or all breakpoints if <u>id</u> is omitted.

       di{sassemble} <u>address</u>
              Set the centre panel disassembly to begin at <u>address</u>.

       ex{it} [<u>expression</u>]
              Exit the emulator immediately, using the exit code resulting from the evaluation of <u>expression</u>, or
              0 if <u>expression</u> is omitted.

       fi{nish}
              Exit from the current CALL or equivalent. This isn't infallible: it works by setting  a  temporary
              breakpoint  at  the  current  contents of the stack pointer, so will not function correctly if the
              code returns to some other point or plays with  its  stack  in  other  ways.  Also,  setting  this
              breakpoint doesn't disable other breakpoints, which may trigger before this one. In that case, the
              temporary breakpoint remains, and the `continue' command can be used to return to it.

       i{gnore} <u>id</u> <u>count</u>
              Do not trigger the next <u>count</u> times that breakpoint <u>id</u> would have triggered.

       n{ext}
              Step  to the opcode following the current one. As with the `finish' command, this works by setting
              a temporary breakpoint at the next opcode, so is not infallible.

       o{ut} <u>port</u> <u>value</u>
              Write <u>value</u> to IO port <u>port</u>.

       pr{int} <u>expression</u>
              Print the value of <u>expression</u> to standard output.

       se{t} <u>address</u> <u>value</u>
              Poke <u>value</u> into memory at <u>address</u>.

       se{t} $<u>variable</u> <u>value</u>
              Set the value of the debugger variable <u>variable</u> to <u>value</u>.

       se{t} <u>area</u>:<u>detail</u> <u>value</u>
              Set the value of the system variable <u>area</u>:<u>detail</u> to <u>value</u>.  The  available  system  variables  are
              listed below.

       s{tep}
              Equivalent to the <u>Single</u> <u>Step</u> button.

       t{breakpoint} [<u>options</u>]
              This  is  the same as the `breakpoint' command in its various forms, except that the breakpoint is
              temporary: it will trigger once and once only, and then be removed.

       Addresses can be specified in one of two forms: either an absolute addresses, specified by an integer  in
       the  range  0x0000  to 0xFFFF or as a `<u>source</u>:<u>page</u>:<u>offset</u>' combination, which refers to a location <u>offset</u>
       bytes into memory bank <u>page</u>, independent of where that bank is currently paged into memory. RAM  and  ROM
       pages  are  indicated, respectively, by `<u>RAM</u>' and `<u>ROM</u>' sources (e.g. offset 0x1234 in ROM 1 is specified
       as `<u>ROM:1:0x1234</u>').  Other available sources are: `<u>Betadisk</u>',  `<u>Didaktik</u>  <u>80</u>  <u>RAM</u>',  `<u>Didaktik</u>  <u>80</u>  <u>ROM</u>',
       `<u>DISCiPLE</u> <u>RAM</u>', `<u>DISCiPLE</u> <u>ROM</u>', `<u>DivIDE</u> <u>EPROM</u>', `<u>DivIDE</u> <u>RAM</u>', `<u>DivMMC</u> <u>EPROM</u>', `<u>DivMMC</u> <u>RAM</u>', `<u>If1</u>', `<u>If2</u>',
       `<u>Multiface</u>  <u>RAM</u>',  `<u>Multiface</u>  <u>ROM</u>',  `<u>Opus</u>  <u>RAM</u>',  `<u>Opus</u>  <u>ROM</u>',  `<u>PlusD</u> <u>RAM</u>', `<u>PlusD</u> <u>ROM</u>', `<u>SpeccyBoot</u>',
       `<u>Spectranet</u>', `<u>Timex</u> <u>Dock</u>', `<u>Timex</u> <u>EXROM</u>', `<u>uSource</u>', `<u>ZXATASP</u>' and `<u>ZXCF</u>'.  Please, note that spaces  in
       memory sources should be escaped, e.g., `break Didaktik\ 80\ ROM:0:0x1234'.  The 48K machines are treated
       as  having  a  permanent  mapping  of  page 5  at  0x4000,  page 2  at  0x8000  and page 0 at 0xC000; the
       16K Spectrum is treated as having page 5 at 0x4000 and no page at 0x8000 and 0xC000.

       Anywhere the debugger is expecting a numeric value, except where it expects  a  breakpoint  id,  you  can
       instead  use a numeric expression, which uses a restricted version of C's syntax; exactly the same syntax
       is used for conditional breakpoints, with `0' being false and any other  value  being  true.  In  numeric
       expressions,  you  can  use  integer constants (all calculations are done in integers), system variables,
       debugger variables, parentheses, the standard four numeric  operations  (`+',  `-',  `*'  and  `/'),  the
       (non-)equality  operators  `=='  and  `!=', the comparison operators `&gt;', `&lt;', `&gt;=' and `&lt;=', bitwise and
       (`&amp;'), or (`|') and exclusive or (`^') and logical and (`&amp;&amp;') and or (`||').  Square  brackets  (`['  and
       `]')  can be used to dereference a value; for example `[0x4000]' will give the value of the first byte of
       the screen.

       System variables are specified via an `<u>area</u>:<u>detail</u>' syntax. The available system variables are:

       ay:current
              The current AY-3-8912 register.
       divmmc:control
              The last byte written to DivMMC control port.
       spectrum:frames
              The frame count since reset. Note that this variable can only be read, not written to.
       tape:microphone
              The current level of the tape input connected to the `EAR' port. Note that this variable can  only
              be read, not written to.
       ula:last
              The last byte written to the ULA. Note that this variable can only be read, not written to.
       ula:mem1ffd
              The  last byte written to memory control port used by the ZX Spectrum +2A/3; normally addressed at
              0x1ffd, hence the name.
       ula:mem7ffd
              The last byte written to primary memory control port used  by  the  ZX  Spectrum  128  and  later;
              normally addressed at 0x7ffd, hence the name.
       ula:tstates
              The number of tstates since the last interrupt.
       z80: <u>register</u> <u>name</u>
              The value of the specified register. Both 8-bit registers and 16-bit register pairs are supported.
              The  MEMPTR  /  WZ  hidden  register is also supported. The (presumable) Q hidden register is also
              supported.
       z80:im
              The current interrupt mode of the Z80.
       z80:iff1
       z80:iff2
              1 if the specified interrupt flip-flop is currently set, or 0 if it is not set.

</pre><h4><b>THE</b> <b>POKE</b> <b>FINDER</b></h4><pre>
       The `poke finder' is a tool which is designed to make the task of finding (infinite lives etc.) pokes for
       games a bit easier: it is similar to the `Lifeguard'  utility  which  was  available  for  use  with  the
       Multiface. It works by maintaining a list of locations in which the current number of lives (etc.) may be
       stored,  and  having  the  ability to remove from that list any locations which don't contain a specified
       value.

       The poke finder dialog contains an entry box for specifying the value to be searched for, a count of  the
       current  number  of  possible  locations and, if there are less than 20 possible locations, a list of the
       possible locations (in `page:offset' format). The five buttons act as follows:

       <u>Incremented</u>
              Remove from the list of possible locations all addresses which have not been incremented since the
              last search.

       <u>Decremented</u>
              Remove from the list of possible locations all addresses which have not been decremented since the
              last search.

       <u>Search</u>
              Remove from the list of possible locations all addresses which do not contain the value  specified
              in the `Search for' field.

       <u>Reset</u>
              Reset the poke finder so that all locations are considered possible.

       <u>Close</u>
              Close the dialog. Note that this does not reset the current state of the poke finder.

       Double-clicking  on  an  entry  in  the  list  of possible locations will cause a breakpoint to be set to
       trigger whenever that location is written to.

       An example of how to use this may make things a bit clearer. We'll use the 128K version of  Gryzor.  Load
       the  game, define keys to suit and start playing. Immediately pause the game and bring up the poke finder
       dialog. We note that we currently have 6 lives, so enter `6'  into  the  `Search  for'  field  and  click
       `Search'.  This  reduces the number of possible locations to around 931 (you may get a slightly different
       number depending on exactly when you paused the game). Play along a bit and then  (deliberately)  lose  a
       life.  Pause the game again. As we now have 5 lives, replace the `6' in the `Search for' field with a `5'
       and click `Search' again. This then reduces the list of possible locations to just  one:  page 2,  offset
       0x00BC.  This  is  the  only  location in memory which stored `6' when we had 6 lives and `5' when we had
       5 lives, so its pretty likely that this is where the  lives  count  is  stored.  Double-clicking  on  the
       `2:0x00BC'  entry in the dialog will set the appropriate breakpoint (you may wish to open the debugger at
       this point to confirm this). Play along a bit more. When you next lose a life, emulation is stopped  with
       PC  at  0x91CD.  Scrolling up a few addresses in the debugger's disassembly pane shows a value was loaded
       from 0x80BC (our hypothetical lives counter), decremented and then stored again to  0x80BC,  which  looks
       very  much  like  the  code  to  reduce  the  number of lives. We can now use the debugger to replace the
       decrement with a NOP (`set 0x91c9 0'), and playing the game some more after this reveals  that  this  has
       worked and we now have infinite lives.

</pre><h4><b>THE</b> <b>POKE</b> <b>MEMORY</b></h4><pre>
       Fuse  supports  multiface POKEs, allowing to modify specific memory addresses in order to cheat (infinite
       lives, infinite ammo, etc.).

       The `poke memory' dialog contains a list of recently loaded POKEs and some entry boxes for adding  custom
       POKEs:

       <u>Bank</u>
              Sets the 128K memory bank (values `0' to `7') or the current memory mapping (value `8' or blank).

       <u>Address</u>
              Memory  address  to  modify.  Values in range 16384 to 65535 for 48K memory mode or 0 to 65535 for
              128K memory banks. GTK UI also accepts hex addresses.

       <u>Value</u>
              New value for the former address, in range 0 to 255. Value 256 means “Prompt to the user later”.

       It is possible to load POKEs from an external file using the <u>File,</u> <u>Open...</u>  menu option or the  drag-and-
       drop  functionality  in  the  GTK  and  Win32  UIs.   After  loading a snapshot or tape, Fuse will try to
       automatically locate a POK file with the same file name. This means that if we open `GAME.TAP', then Fuse
       will try to open `GAME.POK' and `POKES/GAME.POK'.  See  <u><a href="http://www.worldofspectrum.org/POKformat.txt">http://www.worldofspectrum.org/POKformat.txt</a></u>  for
       more details about this file format.

       POKEs  loaded  in  the  list  can be activated or deactivated as the user wants and will remain in memory
       until a machine reset.

</pre><h4><b>THE</b> <b>.DSK</b> <b>FORMAT</b></h4><pre>
       In general, disk images for the +3 Spectrum are thought of as being  in  DSK  format.  However,  this  is
       actually a slight oversimplification; there are in fact <u>two</u> similar, but not identical, DSK formats. (The
       difference can be seen by doing `<b>head</b> <b>-1</b> <u>dskfile</u>': one format will start `MV - CPCEMU' and the other will
       start `EXTENDED').

       Fuse supports both the `CPCEMU' and `EXTENDED' formats.

</pre><h4><b>BETA</b> <b>128</b> <b>EMULATION</b></h4><pre>
       Fuse supports Betadisk emulation in its Pentagon and Scorpion emulation, and also under 48K, TC2048, 128K
       and  +2  (but  not +2A) emulation if the <u>Beta</u> <u>128</u> <u>interface</u> option from the <u>Options,</u> <u>Peripherals,</u> <u>Disk...</u>
       dialog is enabled. When that option is used in 48K or TC2048 emulation  the  <u>Beta</u> <u>128</u>  <u>auto-boot</u>  <u>in</u>  <u>48K</u>
       <u>machines</u>  option additionally controls whether the machine boots directly into the TR-DOS system. See the
       <b>DISK</b> <b>FILE</b> <b>FORMATS</b> section for more details on supported disk file formats.

</pre><h4><b>OPUS</b> <b>DISCOVERY</b> <b>EMULATION</b></h4><pre>
       By default, Fuse emulates the Opus Discovery interface with the optional 2k RAM expansion  and  a  second
       40 track  single  sided disk drive.  See the <b>DISK</b> <b>FILE</b> <b>FORMATS</b> section for more details on supported disk
       file formats. The Opus Discovery's printer port is also  emulated  for  output  only.  (See  the  <b>PRINTER</b>
       <b>EMULATION</b>  section for more details.) The Opus Discovery may only be used with 16K, 48K, 128K, TC2048 and
       +2 (not +2A) emulation.  To access disks, use the same syntax as Interface 1 and Microdrives.

</pre><h4><b>+D</b> <b>EMULATION</b></h4><pre>
       Fuse supports emulating the +D disk and printer interface. See the <b>DISK</b> <b>FILE</b>  <b>FORMATS</b>  section  for  more
       details  on  supported  disk  file formats. The +D's printer port is emulated. (See the <b>PRINTER</b> <b>EMULATION</b>
       section for more details.) The +D may only be used with 48K, 128K and +2 (not +2A) emulation.  To  access
       disks, you will first need to load G+DOS, by inserting a disk containing the DOS file (+SYS) and entering
       “RUN”.   Once  DOS is loaded, you can load to/from +D disks by prefixing filenames with `d<u>n</u>' where `<u>n</u>' is
       the number of the drive in use.  For example, `<u>LOAD</u> <u>d1"myfile"</u>' would load the file named  `myfile'  from
       the emulated drive 1.  Microdrive syntax may also be used.

       To  save  a  snapshot, choose the <u>Machine,</u> <u>NMI</u> menu option, and then press `4' to save a 48K snapshot, or
       `5' to save a 128K snapshot.  When saving a 128K snapshot, you must then press Y or N to indicate whether
       the screen changed while saving the snapshot, to finish saving.  You  can  also  choose  `3'  to  save  a
       screenshot  to  disk.  Holding Caps Shift together with any of these options will cause the +D to save to
       the `other' drive to the one used last.

       Options `1' and `2' allow screenshots  to  be  printed  (in  monochrome,  in  normal  and  large  formats
       respectively)  if  printer  emulation  is  enabled.   For  saving and loading of snapshots, and saving of
       screenshots to disk, G+DOS must be loaded first, but printing of screenshots  can  be  performed  without
       loading G+DOS.

       Finally, `X' will return from the NMI menu.

</pre><h4><b>DIDAKTIK</b> <b>80</b> <b>EMULATION</b></h4><pre>
       Fuse  supports  Didaktik  80  (and  Didaktik  40)  emulation.   It  emulates  the original version of the
       Didaktik 80, running MDOS 1 and with a WD2797 floppy controller.  See the <b>DISK</b> <b>FILE</b> <b>FORMATS</b>  section  for
       more  details  on supported disk file formats.  The Didaktik 80 may only be used with 16K, 48K and TC2048
       emulation.  To press the Didaktik 80's `SNAP' button, choose the <u>Machine,</u> <u>Didaktik</u> <u>SNAP</u> menu option.

</pre><h4><b>DISCIPLE</b> <b>EMULATION</b></h4><pre>
       Fuse supports emulating the DISCiPLE disk and printer interface, although it does not  currently  support
       emulation of the Sinclair Network, or support emulation of a DISCiPLE attached to a 128K machine. See the
       <b>DISK</b>  <b>FILE</b>  <b>FORMATS</b> section for more details on supported disk file formats, which are the same as for +D
       emulation as described above. The DISCiPLE's printer port is emulated. (See the <b>PRINTER</b> <b>EMULATION</b> section
       for more details.) The DISCiPLE may only be used with 48K emulation at present.   To  access  disks,  you
       will first need to load GDOS, by inserting a disk containing the DOS file (SYS) and entering “RUN”.  Once
       DOS  is  loaded,  you  can  load to/from DISCiPLE disks by prefixing filenames with `d<u>n</u>' where `<u>n</u>' is the
       number of the drive in use.  For example, `<u>LOAD</u> <u>d1"myfile"</u>' would load the file named `myfile'  from  the
       emulated drive 1.  Microdrive syntax may also be used.

       Snapshots  can  be  saved in a similar manner to that of the +D as described above, but note that GDOS on
       the DISCiPLE contains a bug which causes corruption as soon as  the  NMI  button  is  pressed,  affecting
       saving  of  snapshots,  and  also loading of snapshots that were originally saved with a +D or SAM Coupé.
       This will cause corruption even when a screenshot is printed, or if the menu is never even entered in the
       first place (due to Caps Shift not being pressed down, as is required for the  DISCiPLE),  provided  that
       GDOS  is loaded.  This bug is not present in G+DOS on the +D.  (Note: this was caused by saving/restoring
       the AF register twice in the NMI handler, where both AF and the AF'  shadow  register  should  have  been
       saved/restored.)

       The  NMI  button works slightly differently on the DISCiPLE than on the +D.  Caps Shift must be held down
       whilst pressing the NMI button, and there is  no  `X'  option  to  exit  the  menu.   Also,  printing  of
       screenshots  requires  GDOS to be loaded.  Depending on the UI that you're using, holding down Caps Shift
       whilst choosing the <u>Machine,</u> <u>NMI</u> menu option may be slightly tricky, or even impossible.  For the GTK UI,
       ensure that the Shift key is held before entering on the <u>Machine</u> menu.  For the widget UI,  it  does  not
       seem possible to perform this action.

</pre><h4><b>DISK</b> <b>FILE</b> <b>FORMATS</b></h4><pre>
       Fuse supports several disk image formats in its +D, Didaktik, DISCiPLE and Beta 128 emulation.

       For reading:

       <u>.UDI</u>
              Ultra  Disk  Image;  for  specification  please  see <u><a href="http://faqwiki.zxnet.co.uk/wiki/UDI_format">http://faqwiki.zxnet.co.uk/wiki/UDI_format</a></u> or
              <u><a href="http://zxmak.chat.ru/docs.htm">http://zxmak.chat.ru/docs.htm</a></u>

              This is the only image format which can store all the relevant information of the recorded data on
              a magnetic disk, so it can be used for any <u>non</u> <u>standard</u> disk format. Fuse can  read  all  extended
              track types too (mixed FM/MFM, or tracks with `WEAK' data or even compressed tracks too).

       <u>.FDI</u>
              UKV Spectrum Debugger disk image format.

       <u>.MGT</u> <u>.IMG</u>
              DISCiPLE/+D file formats.

       <u>.SAD</u>
              For  compatibility  with  SAM  Coupé  disk images using these formats.  Note that SAM Coupé `.DSK'
              images share the same format as `.MGT'.

       <u>.D80</u> <u>.D40</u>
              Didaktik 80 and Didaktik 40 file formats.

       <u>.TRD</u>
              TR-DOS disk image. TRD and SCL sectors are loaded  interleaved,  therefore  you  might  experience
              problems with TR-DOS ROMs that use the turbo format (sequential sectors); for detailed information
              please see <u><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20070808150548/http">http://web.archive.org/web/20070808150548/http</a>://www.ramsoft.bbk.org/tech/tr-info.zip</u>

       <u>.SCL</u>
              A  simple  archive  format  for  TR-DOS  disk  files.  For specification please see <u><a href="http://www.zx">http://www.zx</a>-</u>
              <u>modules.de/fileformats/sclformat.html</u>

       <u>.TD0</u>
              Teledisk image format; Fuse supports only files  which  do  not  use  the  “Advanced  Compression”
              option. Detailed description found in <u><a href="http://www.classiccmp.org/dunfield/img54306/td0notes.txt">http://www.classiccmp.org/dunfield/img54306/td0notes.txt</a></u> and
              <u>https://web.archive.org/web/20130116072335/<a href="http://www.fpns.net/willy/wteledsk.htm">http://www.fpns.net/willy/wteledsk.htm</a></u>

       <u>.DSK</u>
              CPC  disk  image  format; Fuse supports the plain old and the new extended CPC format too. Further
              information please  see  the  <b>THE</b>  <b>.DSK</b>  <b>FORMAT</b>  section  and  the  CPCEMU  manual  section  7.7.1
              <u><a href="http://www.cpc-emu.org/linux/cpcemu_e.txt">http://www.cpc-emu.org/linux/cpcemu_e.txt</a></u> or the <u><a href="http://www.cpctech.org.uk/docs/extdsk.html">http://www.cpctech.org.uk/docs/extdsk.html</a></u>

       <u>.OPD</u> <u>.OPU</u>
              Opus Discovery file formats.

       Fuse  supports  most  of the above formats for writing: <u>.UDI</u> <u>.FDI</u> <u>.MGT</u> <u>.IMG</u> <u>.SAD</u> <u>.D80</u> <u>.D40</u> <u>.TRD</u> <u>.SCL</u> <u>.OPD</u>
       <u>.OPU</u> <u>.DSK</u> (only the old CPC format).

       You can save  disk  images  with  any  output  format,  just  select  the  appropriate  extension.  (e.g.
       `<u>elite3.udi</u>' to save as an UDI file). If the appropriate libraries were available when <u><a href="../man3/libspectrum.3.html">libspectrum</a></u>(3) was
       compiled,  than Fuse will try to create UDI images with compressed tracks to save disk space.  There is a
       <u>.LOG</u> `image' format for debugging purpose. This is a plain text file that contains  three  dumps  of  the
       loaded  disk  image  at  different details.  Not all image formats can store all disk images.  You cannot
       save a disk image with an inappropriate format that loses some information (e.g. variable track length or
       sector length).

</pre><h4><b>WEAK</b> <b>DISK</b> <b>DATA</b></h4><pre>
       Some copy protections have what is described as `weak/random' data.  Each time the sector is read one  or
       more  bytes  will change, the value may be random between consecutive reads of the same sector.  Two disk
       image formats (Extended DSK and UDI) can store this type of data.  Fuse can read and use weak sector data
       from EDSK and UDI files when present, and can save back weak sector data to UDI image format.

</pre><h4><b>MOVIE</b> <b>RECORDING</b></h4><pre>
       Fuse can save movies with sound in a specific file format (FMF).  This recording is very fast, and has  a
       moderate  size, but you need to use the <u><a href="../man1/fmfconv.1.html">fmfconv</a></u>(1) program in <u><a href="../man1/fuse-utils.1.html">fuse-utils</a></u>(1) to convert into regular video
       and/or audio files.  The <b>--movie-compr</b> option allows you to set the compression level to  None,  Lossless
       or High. If <u><a href="../man3/zlib.3.html">zlib</a></u>(3) is not available, only None is valid. The default when Zlib is available is Lossless.
       Recording  a  movie  may  slow down emulation, if you experience performance problems, you can try to set
       compression to None.

       Fuse records every displayed frame, so by default the recorded file has about 50 video frame per  second.
       A  standard  video  has  about  24–30/s  framerate,  so  if you set <u>Options/General/Frame</u> <u>rate</u> <u>1:n</u> or the
       equivalent <b>--rate</b> command line option to 2 than recording frame rate reduces about 25/s. The exact  frame
       rate depends on the Z80 clock frequency which varies depending on the specific emulated machine.

       Note:  You  can  see all of the “gfx” effects only if the Fuse frame rate option is set to 1, but in most
       cases you can safely use 2. Also, movie recording stops if the emulated machine is changed.

       The recorded sound sampling rate and the channel number is equal with the Fuse generated  sound  sampling
       rate  (44100 Hz  by  default)  and  channel  number (mono by default). The common sampling frequencies in
       standard video files are 44100 Hz and 48000 Hz. If you use  <b>--sound-freq</b>  command  line  option  you  can
       change the frequency.

       You  can  record stereo sound if you use <u>AY</u> <u>stereo</u> <u>separation</u> or the equivalent <b>--separation</b> command line
       switch.

       You can use <u><a href="../man1/fmfconv.1.html">fmfconv</a></u>(1) to convert recorded movie file into a standard video file.

       <b>Examples</b>

       <b>fuse</b> <b>--movie-start</b> <b>output.fmf</b> <b>--rate</b> <b>2</b> <b>--sound-freq</b> <b>44100</b> <b>--separation</b> <b>ACB</b>

       start video recording about 25/s video frame rate and 44100 Hz sampling frequency  stereo  sound  default
       compression level.

</pre><h4><b>COMPRESSED</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       Assuming  the  appropriate  libraries  were  available  when <u><a href="../man3/libspectrum.3.html">libspectrum</a></u>(3) was compiled, snapshots, tape
       images, dock cartridges and input recording files (RZX) can be read from files compressed with  <u><a href="../man3/bzip2.3.html">bzip2</a></u>(3),
       <u><a href="../man3/gzip.3.html">gzip</a></u>(3) or <u><a href="../man3/zip.3.html">zip</a></u>(3) just as if they were uncompressed. In the zip case, only the first supported file found
       inside  the  archive  is loaded.  There is currently no support for reading compressed +3, DISCiPLE/+D or
       Beta disk images.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Selecting a startup filter doesn't work properly with user interfaces other than SDL, Win32 and GTK.

       Changing virtual consoles when using SVGAlib for joystick support causes Fuse  to  exit.  If  this  is  a
       problem, compile Fuse with the `<b>--disable-ui-joystick</b>' option.

       The poke finder can't search outside `normal' RAM.

       The  libao  file  output  devices not work properly with the GTK UI.  No error reporting, but the created
       file does not contain any sound data.  If you use a `weak' machine alsa09 makes a lot of clicks and  pops
       and will output `<u>ALSA:</u> <u>underrun,</u> <u>at</u> <u>least</u> <u>0ms.</u>'  error messages.
