</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       gfsched - schedule and display available file system nodes

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>

       <b>gfsched</b> -f <u>gfarm-URL</u> [-D <u>domain-name</u>] [-n <u>number</u>] [-LMOSclw]

       <b>gfsched</b> [-P <u>gfarm-URL</u>] [-D <u>domain-name</u>] [-n <u>number</u>] [-LMOSlw]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>gfsched</b> command with the <b>-f</b> <u>gfarm-URL</u> option displays available file system nodes which have a file
       replica of the specified gfarm-URL.

       When the <b>-f</b> <u>gfarm-URL</u> option is not specified, the <b>gfsched</b> command just displays available file system
       nodes. In this case, you can specify a metadata server by the <b>-P</b> <u>gfarm-URL</u> option, if necessary.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-D</b> <u>domain-name</u>
           Limits file system node by specifying a domain name or a hostname.

       <b>-c</b>
           Displays scheduling information for a file creation, if the file specified by <b>-f</b> doesn't exist.

           Currently, this option creates the specified file. But please note that this behavior may be changed
           in future.

       <b>-L</b>
           Suppresses authentication check. Without this option, the scheduler checks whether the user will be
           successfully authenticated with the hosts or not. This option omits the check to make scheduling
           faster, but that creates a risk that hosts which fail authentication with the user may be scheduled.

       <b>-M</b>
           Suppresses client-side scheduling and only performs metadata-server-side scheduling. This option
           makes scheduling faster, but also creates a risk that hosts which is network-unreachable or fails
           authentication with the user may be scheduled.

       <b>-O</b>
           Displays filesystem nodes where the hosts are other than the host that the gfsched command is
           running.

       <b>-P</b> <u>gfarm-URL</u>
           Specifies a <u>gfarm-URL</u> or a pathname to identify a metadata server which is used for the scheduling.
           This option conflicts with the <b>-f</b> option.

       <b>-S</b>
           Displays a filesystem node where the host is same with the host that the gfsched command is running.

       <b>-f</b> <u>gfarm-URL</u>
           The <b>gfsched</b> command schedules file system nodes which have a replica of a file specified by this
           option. This option conflicts with the <b>-P</b> option.

       <b>-l</b>
           Long format. This option displays port numbers as well as hostnames. Note that the display format of
           this option may be changed in future.

       <b>-n</b> <u>number</u>
           Displays specified number of file system nodes at most. If this option is not specified, it displays
           all available nodes.

       <b>-w</b>
           Schedules with write-mode. When this option is specified, file system nodes which don't have enough
           free space won't be displayed.

           When both this option and the <b>-f</b> are specified, and if the file is already opened by an existing
           process with write-mode, the <b>gfsched</b> command only displays one file system node which is assigned for
           writing to the file.

       <b>-?</b>
           Displays a list of command options.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       The following is an example to inquire file system nodes that the metadata server thinks they are
       currently working.

           $ gfsched -M
