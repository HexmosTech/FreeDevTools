</pre><h4><b>Name</b></h4><pre>
       pico - simple text editor in the style of the Alpine Composer

</pre><h4><b>Syntax</b></h4><pre>
       <b>pico</b> [ <u>options</u> ] [ <u>file</u> ]

</pre><h4><b>Description</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Pico</u>  is  a  simple,  display-oriented  text editor based on the Alpine message system composer.  As with
       Alpine, commands are displayed at the bottom of the screen, and context-sensitive help is  provided.   As
       characters are typed they are immediately inserted into the text.

       Editing  commands  are  entered  using  control-key  combinations.   As  a work-around for communications
       programs that swallow certain control characters, you can emulate a control key by pressing ESCAPE twice,
       followed by the desired control character, e.g. "ESC ESC c" would be equivalent  to  entering  a  ctrl-c.
       The  editor  has  five  basic  features:  paragraph justification, searching, block cut/paste, a spelling
       checker, and a file browser.

       Paragraph justification (or filling) takes place in the paragraph that contains the cursor,  or,  if  the
       cursor is between lines, in the paragraph immediately below.  Paragraphs are delimited by blank lines, or
       by  lines  beginning  with  a  space or tab.  Unjustification can be done immediately after justification
       using the control-U key combination.

       String searches are not sensitive to case.  A search begins at the  current  cursor  position  and  wraps
       around  the  end  of  the  text.   The  most recent search string is offered as the default in subsequent
       searches.

       Blocks of text can be moved, copied or deleted with creative use of the command for mark (ctrl-^), delete
       (ctrl-k) and undelete (ctrl-u).  The delete command will remove text between the "mark" and  the  current
       cursor position, and place it in the "cut" buffer.  The undelete command effects a "paste" at the current
       cursor position.

       The  spell  checker  examines  all  words in the text.  It then offers, in turn, each misspelled word for
       correction  while  highlighting  it  in  the  text.   Spell  checking  can  be  cancelled  at  any  time.
       Alternatively, <u>pico</u> will substitute for the default spell checking routine a routine defined by the SPELL
       environment variable.  The replacement routine should read standard input and write standard output.

       The  file  browser  is  offered  as  an option in the "Read File" and "Write Out" command prompts.  It is
       intended to help in searching for specific files and navigating directory  hierarchies.   Filenames  with
       sizes and names of directories in the current working directory are presented for selection.  The current
       working  directory is displayed on the top line of the display while the list of available commands takes
       up the bottom two.  Several basic file manipulation functions are supported:  file renaming, copying, and
       deletion.

       More specific help is available in <u>pico</u>'s online help.

</pre><h4><b>Options</b></h4><pre>
       <b>+</b><u>n</u>     Causes <u>pico</u> to be started with the cursor located <u>n</u> lines into the file. (Note: no  space  between
              "+" sign and number)

       <b>-a</b>     Display all files including those beginning with a period (.).

       <b>-b</b>     Enable  the  option  to  Replace  text  matches  found using the "Where is" command. This now does
              nothing. Instead, the option is always turned on (as if the -b flag had been specified).

       <b>-d</b>     Rebind the "delete" key so the character the cursor is on is rubbed out rather than the  character
              to its left.

       <b>-e</b>     Enable file name completion.

       <b>-f</b>     Use  function  keys for commands.  This option supported only in conjunction with UW Enhanced NCSA
              telnet.

       <b>-h</b>     List valid command line options.

       <b>-j</b>     Enable "Goto" command in the file browser.  This enables the command to permit explicitly  telling
              <u>pilot</u> which directory to visit.

       <b>-g</b>     Enable  "Show  Cursor"  mode  in  file  browser.  Cause cursor to be positioned before the current
              selection rather than placed at the lower left of the display.

       <b>-k</b>     Causes "Cut Text" command to remove characters from the cursor position to the  end  of  the  line
              rather than remove the entire line.

       <b>-m</b>     Enable  mouse  functionality.   This  only  works  when <u>pico</u> is run from within an X Window System
              "xterm" window.

       <b>-n</b><u>n</u>    The -n<u>n</u> option enables new mail notification.  The <u>n</u>  argument  is  optional,  and  specifies  how
              often,  in  seconds, your mailbox is checked for new mail.  For example, -n60 causes <u>pico</u> to check
              for new mail once every minute.  The default interval is 180 seconds, while the minimum allowed is
              30. (Note: no space between "n" and the number)

       <b>-o</b> <u>dir</u> Sets operating directory.  Only files within this directory are accessible.   Likewise,  the  file
              browser is limited to the specified directory subtree.

       <b>-r</b><u>n</u>    Sets column used to limit the "Justify" command's right margin

       <b>-s</b> <u>speller</u>
              Specify an alternate program <u>spell</u> to use when spell checking.

       <b>-t</b>     Enable  "tool"  mode.  Intended for when <u>pico</u> is used as the editor within other tools (e.g., Elm,
              Pnews).  <u>Pico</u> will not prompt for save on exit, and will not rename the buffer during  the  "Write
              Out" command.

       <b>-v</b>     View the file only, disallowing any editing.

       <b>-version</b>
              Print Pico version and exit.

       <b>-w</b>     Disable word wrap (thus allow editing of long lines).

       <b>-x</b>     Disable keymenu at the bottom of the screen.

       <b>-z</b>     Enable ^Z suspension of <u>pico</u>.

       <b>-p</b>     Preserve  the "start" and "stop" characters, typically Ctrl-Q and Ctrl-S, which are sometimes used
              in communications paths to control data flow between devices that operate at different speeds.

       <b>-Q</b> <u>quotestr</u>
              Set the quote string.  Especially useful when composing  email,  setting  this  allows  the  quote
              string to be checked for when Justifying paragraphs.  A common quote string is "&gt; ".

       <b>-W</b> <u>word_separators</u>
              If  characters  listed  here  appear in the middle of a word surrounded by alphanumeric characters
              that word is split into two words. This is used by the Forward and Backward word commands  and  by
              the spell checker.

       <b>-q</b>     Termcap  or  terminfo  definition  for  input escape sequences are used in preference to sequences
              defined by default.  This option is only available if <u>pico</u>  was  compiled  with  the  TERMCAP_WINS
              define turned on.

       <b>-setlocale_ctype</b>
              Do setlocale(LC_CTYPE) if available. Default is to not do this setlocale.

       <b>-no_setlocale_collate</b>
              Do not do setlocale(LC_COLLATE). Default is to do this setlocale.

       Lastly, when a running <u>pico</u> is disconnected (i.e., receives a SIGHUP), <u>pico</u> will save the current work if
       needed  before  exiting.  Work is saved under the current filename with ".save" appended.  If the current
       work is unnamed, it is saved under the filename "pico.save".

</pre><h4><b>Color</b> <b>Support</b></h4><pre>
       If your terminal supports colors, Pico can be configured to color text. Users can configure the color  of
       the  text,  the  text  in the key menu, the titlebar, messages and prompt in the status line. As an added
       feature Pico can also be used to configure the color of up to three different levels of quoted text,  and
       the  signature  of an email message. This is useful when Pico is used as a tool (with the -t command line
       switch.)

       Pico can tell you the number of colors  that  your  terminal  supports,  when  started  with  the  switch
       -color_codes.  In addition Pico will print a table showing the numerical code of every color supported in
       that terminal. In order to configure colors, one must use these numerical codes. For example,  0  is  for
       black, so in order to configure a black color, one must use its code, the number 0.

       In  order  to  activate  colors,  one  must use the option -ncolors with a numerical value indicating the
       number of colors that your terminal supports, for example, <u>-ncolors</u> <u>256</u> indicates that the user wishes to
       use a table of 256 colors.

       All options that control color, are four letter options. Their last two letters are either "fc" or  "bc",
       indicating <u>foreground</u> <u>color</u> and <u>bacground</u> <u>color</u>, respectively. The first two letters indicate the type of
       text  that  is  being  configured,  for example "nt" stands for <u>normal</u> <u>text</u>, so that -ntfc represents the
       color of the normal text, while -ntbc represents the color of the background of normal text.  Here  is  a
       complete list of the color options supported by Pico.

       <b>-color_code</b>
              displays  the  number  of colors supported by the terminal, and a table showing the association of
              colors and numerical codes

       <b>-ncolors</b> <u>number</u>
              activates color support in Pico, and tells Pico  how  many  colors  to  use.   Depending  on  your

</pre><h4><b>Bugs</b></h4><pre>
       The manner in which lines longer than the display width are dealt is not immediately obvious.  Lines that
       continue beyond the edge of the display are indicated by a '$' character at the end of  the  line.   Long
       lines are scrolled horizontally as the cursor moves through them.

</pre><h4><b>Files</b></h4><pre>
       pico.save        Unnamed interrupted work saved here.
       *.save           Interrupted work on a named file is saved here.
