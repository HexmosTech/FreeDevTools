</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       alpine - an Alternatively Licensed Program for Internet News and Email

</pre><h4><b>SYNTAX</b></h4><pre>
       <b>alpine</b> [ <u>options</u> ] [ <u>address</u> , <u>address</u> ]

       <b>alpinef</b> [ <u>options</u> ] [ <u>address</u> , <u>address</u> ]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Alpine  is  a  screen-oriented  message-handling  tool.   In  its default configuration, Alpine offers an
       intentionally limited set of functions geared toward the novice user, but it also has  a  large  list  of
       optional  "power-user"  and  personal-preference  features.   <u>alpinef</u>  is  a  variant of Alpine that uses
       function keys rather than mnemonic single-letter commands.  Alpine's basic feature set includes:

              View, Save, Export, Delete, Print, Reply and Forward messages.

              Compose messages in a simple editor (Pico) with word-wrap and a spelling checker.  Messages may be
              postponed for later completion.

              Full-screen selection and management of message folders.

              Address book to keep a list of long or frequently-used addresses.  Personal distribution lists may
              be defined.  Addresses may be taken into the address book  from  incoming  mail  without  retyping
              them.

              New  mail  checking  and  notification  occurs  automatically  every 2.5 minutes and after certain
              commands, e.g. refresh-screen (Ctrl-L).

              On-line, context-sensitive help screens.

       Alpine supports MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail  Extensions),  an  Internet  Standard  for  representing
       multipart  and  multimedia  data  in email.  Alpine allows you to save MIME objects to files, and in some
       cases, can also initiate the correct program for viewing  the  object.   It  uses  the  system's  <u>mailcap</u>
       configuration file to determine what program can process a particular MIME object type.  Alpine's message
       composer does not have integral multimedia capability, but any type of data file --including multimedia--
       can  be  attached  to  a  text  message  and  sent using MIME's encoding rules.  This allows any group of
       individuals with MIME-capable mail software (e.g. Alpine, PC-Alpine, or many other programs) to  exchange
       formatted documents, spread-sheets, image files, etc, via Internet email.

       Alpine  uses  the <u>c-client</u> messaging API to access local and remote mail folders. This library provides a
       variety of low-level message-handling functions, including drivers for a variety of different  mail  file
       formats,  as well as routines to access remote mail and news servers, using IMAP (Internet Message Access
       Protocol) and NNTP (Network News Transport Protocol).  Outgoing mail is usually posted directly via  SMTP
       (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol).

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The command line options/arguments are:

       <u>address</u>             Send  mail  to  <u>address.</u>   This  will  cause  Alpine  to go directly into the message
                           composer.

       <b>-attach</b> <u>file</u>        Send mail with the listed <u>file</u> as an attachment.

       <b>-attachlist</b> <u>file-list</u>
                           Send mail with the listed <u>file-list</u> as an attachments.

       <b>-attach_and_delete</b> <u>file</u>
                           Send mail with the listed <u>file</u> as an  attachment,  and  remove  the  file  after  the
                           message is sent.

       <b>-aux</b> <u>local_directory</u>
                           PC-Alpine only. When using a remote configuration (-p &lt;remote_config&gt;) this tells PC-
                           Alpine  the  local  directory  to  use for storing auxiliary files, like debug files,
                           address books, and signature files.

       <b>-bail</b>               Exit if the pinerc file does not exist. This might be useful if the  config  file  is
                           accessed  using  some remote filesystem protocol. If the remote mount is missing this
                           will cause Alpine to quit instead of creating a new pinerc.

       <b>-c</b> <u>context-number</u>   context-number is the number corresponding to the folder-collection to which  the  <u>-f</u>
                           command  line  argument  should be applied.  By default the <u>-f</u> argument is applied to
                           the first defined folder-collection.

       <b>-conf</b>               Produce a sample/fresh copy of the system-wide configuration file, <u>pine.conf,</u> on  the
                           standard output. This is distinct from the per-user <u>.pinerc</u> file.

       <b>-convert_sigs</b> <u>-p</u> <u>pinerc</u>
                           Convert signature files into literal signatures.

       <b>-copy_abook</b> <b>&lt;</b><u>local_abook</u>&gt; &lt;<u>remote_abook</u>&gt;
                           Copy the local address book file to a remote address book folder.

       <b>-copy_pinerc</b> <b>&lt;</b><u>local_pinerc</u>&gt; &lt;<u>remote_pinerc</u>&gt;
                           Copy the local pinerc file to a remote pinerc folder.

       <b>-d</b> <u>debug-level</u>      Output  diagnostic info at <u>debug-level</u> (0-9) to the current <u>.pine-debug[1-4]</u> file.  A
                           value of 0 turns debugging off and suppresses the <u>.pine-debug</u> file.

       <b>-d</b> <u>key[=val]</u>        Fine tuned output of diagnostic messages where  "flush"  causes  debug  file  writing
                           without  buffering, "timestamp" appends each message with a timestamp, "imap=n" where
                           n is between  0  and  4  representing  none  to  verbose  IMAP  telemetry  reporting,
                           "numfiles=n"  where  n is between 0 and 31 corresponding to the number of debug files
                           to maintain, and "verbose=n" where n  is  between  0  and  9  indicating  an  inverse
                           threshold for message output.

       <b>-f</b> <u>folder</u>           Open  <u>folder</u>  (in  first  defined  folder  collection,  use  <u>-c</u>  <u>n</u> to specify another
                           collection) instead of INBOX.

       <b>-F</b> <u>file</u>             Open named text file and view with Alpine's browser.

       <b>-h</b>                  Help: list valid command-line options.

       <b>-i</b>                  Start up in the FOLDER INDEX screen.

       <b>-I</b> <u>keystrokes</u>       Initial (comma separated list of) keystrokes which Alpine should execute on startup.

       <b>-install</b>            For PC-Alpine only, this option causes PC-Alpine  to  prompt  for  some  basic  setup
                           information, then exits.

       <b>-k</b>                  Use function keys for commands. This is the same as running the command <u>alpinef</u>.

       <b>-n</b> <u>number</u>           Start up with current message-number set to <u>number.</u>

       <b>-nowrite_password_cache</b>
                           Read  from  a  password cache if there is one, but never offer to write a password to
                           the cache

       <b>-o</b>                  Open first folder read-only.

       <b>-p</b> <u>config-file</u>      Use <u>config-file</u> as the personal configuration file instead of the default <u>.pinerc</u>.

       <b>-P</b> <u>config-file</u>      Use  <u>config-file</u>  as  the  configuration  file   instead   of   default   system-wide
                           configuration file <u>pine.conf</u>.

       <b>-passfile</b> <u>&lt;fully-qualified-path&gt;</u>
                           When  password  file  support  is  compiled  in,  use  the  file specified in <u>&lt;fully-</u>
                           <u>qualified-path&gt;</u> instead of the default.

       <b>-pinerc</b> <u>file</u>        Output fresh pinerc configuration to <u>file,</u> <u>preserving</u> <u>the</u> <u>settings</u> <u>of</u> <u>variables</u>  <u>that</u>
                           <u>the</u> <u>user</u> <u>has</u> <u>made.</u>  Use <u>file</u> set to ``-'' to make output go to standard out.

       <b>-pwdcertdir</b> <u>&lt;fully-qualified-path&gt;</u>
                           When  SMIME  and  password  file  support  are  compiled  in,  this variable sets the
                           directory to store your personal key and certificate  to  encrypt  and  decrypt  your
                           password file.

       <b>-r</b>                  Use  restricted/demo  mode.   <u>Alpine</u> will only send mail to itself and functions like
                           save and export are restricted.

       <b>-registry</b> <u>cmd</u>       For PC-Alpine only, this option affects the  values  of  Alpine's  registry  entries.
                           Possible  values  for  <u>cmd</u>  are set, clear, and dump.  <u>Set</u> will always reset Alpine's
                           registry entries according to its current settings.  <u>Clear</u> will  clear  the  registry
                           values.   <u>Clearsilent</u> will silently clear the registry values.  <u>Dump</u> will display the
                           values of current registry  settings.   Note  that  the  dump  command  is  currently
                           disabled.   Without  the  -registry  option,  PC-Alpine  will  write  values into the
                           registry only if there currently aren't any values set.

       <b>-smimedir</b> <u>&lt;fully-qualified-path&gt;</u>
                           If SMIME is compiled in, this argument sets the directory where the public,  private,
                           and  certificate  authorities  certificates  and  keys  are stored. If not set by the
                           command line the default is <a href="file:~/.alpine-smime">~/.alpine-smime</a>

       <b>-sort</b> <u>order</u>         Sort the FOLDER INDEX display in one of the following orders: <u>arrival,</u> <u>date,</u> <u>subject,</u>
                           <u>orderedsubj,</u> <u>thread,</u> <u>from,</u> <u>size,</u> <u>score,</u> <u>to,</u> <u>cc,</u> or  <u>reverse.</u>  <u>Arrival</u>  order  is  the
                           default.  The OrderedSubj choice simulates a threaded sort.  Any sort may be reversed
                           by adding <u>/reverse</u> to it.  <u>Reverse</u> by itself is the same as <u>arrival/reverse</u>.

       <b>-supported</b>          Some  options may or may not be supported depending on how Alpine was compiled.  This
                           is a way to determine which options are supported in the particular  copy  of  Alpine
                           you are using.

       <b>-uninstall</b>          For  PC-Alpine  only,  this option causes PC-Alpine to remove references to Alpine in
                           Windows settings.

       <b>-url</b> <u>url</u>            Open the given <u>url.</u>  Cannot be used with <u>-f</u> or <u>-F</u> options.

       <b>-v</b>                  Version: Print version information.

       <b>-version</b>            Version: Print version information.

       <b>-x</b> <u>config</u>           Use configuration exceptions in <u>config.</u>  Exceptions are used to override your default
                           pinerc settings for a particular platform, can be a local file or a remote folder.

       <b>-xoauth2-server</b> <u>ServerName</u>
                           Name of the service that XOAUTH2 authentication will be attempted.  The only  service
                           supported  as of this writing is Gmail. Note that all of the options -xoauth2-server,
                           -xoauth2-client-id and -xoauth2-client-secret must be used  simultaneously.  Example:
                           -xoauth2-server Gmail.

       <b>-xoauth2-client-id</b> <u>Client-Id</u>
                           String  that  identifies  Alpine  with  the  service  provider  that provides XOAUTH2
                           authentication. Note that all of the options -xoauth2-server, -xoauth2-client-id  and
                           -xoauth2-client-secret must be used simultaneously.

       <b>-xoauth2-client-secret</b> <u>Client-Secret</u>
                           Secret  string  that  identifies  the  Alpine with the service provider that provides
                           XOAUTH2  authentication.    Note   that   all   of   the   options   -xoauth2-server,
                           -xoauth2-client-id and -xoauth2-client-secret must be used simultaneously.

       <b>-z</b>                  Enable ^Z and SIGTSTP so alpine may be suspended.

       <u>-option=value</u>       Assign  <u>value</u>  to  the  config  option  <u>option</u> e.g. -signature-file=sig1 or -feature-
                           list=signature-at-bottom (Note: feature-list values are additive)

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       There are several levels of Alpine configuration.   Configuration  values  at  a  given  level  over-ride
       corresponding values at lower levels.  In order of increasing precedence:

        o built-in defaults.
        o system-wide <u>pine.conf</u> file.
        o personal <u>.pinerc</u> file (may be set via built-in Setup/Config menu.)
        o command-line options.
        o system-wide <u>pine.conf.fixed</u> file.

       There is one exception to the rule that configuration values are replaced by the value of the same option
       in  a  higher-precedence file: the feature-list variable has values that are additive, but can be negated
       by prepending "no-" in front of  an  individual  feature  name.  Unix  Alpine  also  uses  the  following
       environment variables:

         TERM
         DISPLAY     (determines if Alpine can display IMAGE attachments.)
         SHELL       (if not set, default is <a href="file:/bin/sh">/bin/sh</a> )
         MAILCAPS    (semicolon delimited list of path names to mailcap files)

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
