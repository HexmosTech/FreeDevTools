</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       vile, xvile, uxvile, lxvile - <b>VI</b> <b>L</b>ike <b>E</b>macs

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>vile</b> <b>[@</b><u>cmdfile</u><b>]</b> <b>[+</b><u>command</u><b>]</b> <b>[-FhIiRVv]</b> <b>[-g</b><u>NNN</u><b>]</b> <b>[-k</b><u>cryptkey</u><b>]</b> <b>[-s</b><u>pattern</u><b>]</b> <b>[-t</b><u>tag</u><b>]</b> <b>[</b><u>filename</u><b>]...</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>vile</u>  is  a  text  editor.   This  man  page  is fairly terse.  More information can be obtained from the
       internal help, available with the <b>-h</b> option or by using the “:help” command from within <u>vile</u>.

       <u>xvile</u> is the same text editor, built as an X-windows application, with fully  integrated  mouse  support,
       scrollbars, etc.

       <u>uxvile</u>  is  a  wrapper  around <u>xvile</u> which invokes the latter program with the correct locale environment
       required to use a unicode character set and the “UXVile” X resource class set.

       <u>lxvile</u> is a wrapper around <u>xvile</u> which invokes the latter program with a font chosen to match the current
       locale environment.

</pre><h4><b>SPIRIT</b></h4><pre>
       <u>vile</u> retains the “finger-feel” if you will, of <u>vi</u>, while adding the multiple buffer and  multiple  window
       features  of emacs and other editors.  It is definitely not a vi clone, in that some substantial stuff is
       missing, and the screen doesn't look quite the same.  The things that you tend  to  type  over  and  over
       probably  work.   Things  done  less  frequently, like configuring a startup file, are somewhat (or very,
       depending on how ambitious you are) different.  But what matters most is that one's “muscle memory”  does
       the right thing to the text in front of you, and that is what <u>vile</u> tries to do for vi users.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Vile  accumulates  most  options  into  two  temporary  buffers <u>[vileinit]</u> and <u>[vileopts]</u>.  The former is
       executed before reading the first file into a buffer.  The latter is executed  after  reading  the  first
       file into a buffer.  Each is removed after executing (unless an error is detected).

   <b>COMMON</b> <b>OPTIONS</b>
       -c<u>command</u>
              <u>vile</u>  will begin the session on the first file invoking the given command.  Legal commands include
              many ex-style commands, vile-commands, etc., subject to shell quoting.  This option is  used  most
              often with a line number or search pattern.  For example

                 vile -c123 filename
                 vile -c/pattern filename

              They correspond to ex-style commands on the given file:

                 :123
                 :/pattern

              These are more verbose equivalents:

                 vile -c'123 goto-line' filename
                 vile -c'search-forward /pattern/' filename

              You can use more than one command, e.g.,

                 vile -c'123' -c'10*goto-col' filename

              to  put  the  cursor on column 10 of line 123.  The “*”(or “:” separates the repeat count (used by
              <u>goto-col</u>) from the line- or range-specification used by line-oriented commands.

       @<u>cmdfile</u>
              <u>vile</u> will run the specified file as its startup file, and will  bypass  any  normal  startup  file
              (i.e.  <u>.vilerc</u>) or environment variable (i.e.  <u>$VILEINIT</u>).  This is added to <u>[vileinit]</u>.

       -D     tells <u>vile</u> to trace the results of macro execution into the hidden buffer “[Trace]”.

       -e | -E
              Invokes <u>vile</u> in “noview” mode - changes are permitted to any buffer while in this mode (see “-v”.

       -F     will  run  the  syntax  filter  that  applies  to each filename on the command-line, and write the
              attributed text to the standard output.

       -h     Invokes <u>vile</u> on the helpfile.  See “-?” for a short usage message.

       -i | -I
              Tells <u>vile</u> to use <u>vileinit.rc</u> (which is installed) as the initialization file.  If you do not have
              a .vilerc, <u>vile</u> will make a short one that sources <u>vileinit.rc</u> This is added to <u>[vileinit]</u>.

       -k <u>cryptkey</u> | -K <u>cryptkey</u>
              Specifies an encryption/decryption key.  See below for further discussion.   This  option  applies
              only  locally to the buffers named on the command-line, and is not added to <u>[vileopts]</u>, since that
              is executed too late.

       -R     Invokes <u>vile</u> in “readonly” mode - no writes are permitted while in this mode.  (This will also  be
              true if <u>vile</u> is invoked as <u>view</u>, or if “readonly” mode is set in the startup file.)

       -s <u>pattern</u> | -S <u>pattern</u>
              In  the  first  file,  <u>vile</u> will execute an initial search for the given pattern.  This is not the
              same as “-c/<u>pattern</u>” since that positions the cursor to  the  line  matching  the  pattern.   This
              option positions the cursor within the line.

       -t <u>tag</u>
              <u>vile</u>  will  edit the correct file and move the cursor to the location of the tag.  This requires a
              tagsfile created with the <u><a href="../man1/ctags.1.html">ctags</a></u>(1) command.  The option -T is equivalent, and can be used when X11
              option parsing eats the -t.

       -U     overrides the $system-crlf variable, making new buffers start in dos mode.

       -u     overrides the $system-crlf variable, making new buffers start in nodos mode.

       -v     Invokes <u>vile</u> in “view” mode - no changes are permitted to any buffer while in this mode (see “-e”.

       -V     <u>vile</u> will report its version number.

       -?     If an option is not recognized (or the special option “?” is given), <u>vile</u>  prints  a  short  usage
              message.  Normally that is sent to the standard output.  The GUI <u>winvile</u> displays this information
              in a window.

   <b>SCREENSIZE</b> <b>OPTIONS</b>
       Screensize can be set from the command line for certain configurations:

       -25 -43 -50 -60
              On PC systems you may be able to set the initial screen resolution from the command line.

       -80 -132
              On  VMS  systems  you may be able to set the initial screen resolution from the command line.  See
              <u>vile.hlp</u> for details.

   <b>X11</b> <b>OPTIONS</b>
       <u>xvile</u>-specific command-line options are  detailed  in  the  help  file  (see  “Standard  X  command  line
       arguments”.  The standard ones (e.g., -display, -fn, -geometry, -name, etc.) are all supported.

   <b>OBSOLETE</b> <b>OPTIONS</b>
       vile recognizes some options which duplicate the functionality of the POSIX “-c” option:

       +<u>command</u>
              This has the same effect as “-c<u>command</u>”

       -g <u>NNN</u> | -G <u>NNN</u>
              This  has  the same effect as “-c<u>NNN</u>” <u>vile</u> will begin the session on the first file jumping to the
              given line number <u>NNN</u>.

</pre><h4><b>INVOCATION</b></h4><pre>
       vile will edit the files specified on the command line.  If no files are specified, and standard input is
       not connected to a terminal, then vile will bring up a buffer containing the output of  the  pipe  it  is
       connected to, and will re-open /dev/tty for commands.  Files (except for the first) are not actually read
       into  buffers until “visited” All buffers are kept in memory: machines with not much memory or swap space
       may have trouble with this.

</pre><h4><b>STARTUP</b></h4><pre>
       If the <u>@</u>cmdfile option is given, then the file given as “cmdfile”  will  be  run  before  any  files  are
       loaded.   If no <u>@</u> option appears, startup commands will be taken from the user's <u>VILEINIT</u> variable, if it
       is set, from the file <u>.vilerc</u> in the current directory, if it exists, or from <u>$HOME/.vilerc</u>,  as  a  last
       resort.  See the help file for examples of what sorts of things might go into these command files.

</pre><h4><b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       Please  refer  to  the  help  available within <u>vile</u> for <u>vile</u>-specific commands.  (That document, however,
       assumes familiarity with vi.)  Short  descriptions  of  each  <u>vile</u>  command  may  be  obtained  with  the
       “:describe-function” and “:describe-key” commands.  All commands may be listed with “:show-commands”

       Additional documentation on writing macros using the internal scripting language can be found in the file
       <u>macros.doc</u>, distributed with the vile source.

</pre><h4><b>RELATED</b> <b>PROGRAMS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>xvile</b>
       <u>vile</u>  may  also  be  built  and  installed  as  <u>xvile</u>,  in  which  case  it behaves as a native X Windows
       application, with scrollbars, better mouse support, etc.

       The help file has more information on this in the section <u>X</u> <u>Window</u> <u>System</u> <u>specifics</u>.

   <b>vile-manfilt</b>
       There is a program distributed with the vile source which is usually installed as <u>vile-manfilt</u>.   It  may
       be  used in conjunction with <u>vile</u> or <u>xvile</u> (with the help of the macros in the file manpage.rc) to filter
       and view system manual pages.  <u>xvile</u> will even (with your font set properly) display certain portions  of
       the manual page text in bold or italics as appropriate.

       See the help file section on <u>Filtering</u> <u>“man”</u> <u>pages</u> for details.

   <b>Syntax</b> <b>filters</b>
       Likewise,  there are several language filters, e.g., <u>vile-c-filt</u> for C, which can embolden, underline, or
       perform coloring on program source code.

       Again, see the help file section on <u>Syntax</u> <u>Coloring</u> for more information.

</pre><h4><b>UTILITY</b> <b>SCRIPTS</b></h4><pre>
       Vile is not simply an interactive program.  Its macro language and use of environment variables  lets  it
       be useful in scripting.

   <b>vile-libdir-path</b>
       The  syntax filters and <u>vile-manfilt</u> may not be installed where you would execute them in your <b>PATH</b>.  The
       <u>vile-libdir-path</u> script looks in the usual places and prints an updated <b>PATH</b> variable which other scripts
       can use when executing these programs.

   <b>vile-pager</b>
       Vile can be used as a <u>pager</u> (typical examples include <u>more</u> and <u>less</u>).  This script uses  <u>vile-manfilt</u>  to
       preprocess a file which is piped to vile, adding markup which vile displays properly.

       Unlike  a  typical  pager,  <u>vile-pager</u>  handles multi-line color escape sequences, and multiple levels of
       overstrikes.  But unlike a typical pager, <u>vile-pager</u> expects the pipe  to  be  closed  before  it  starts
       displaying.

   <b>vile-to-html</b>
       Vile's  “-F”  option  makes  it  act like a smart interface to the collection of syntax filters.  But its
       output uses vile's internal markup rather than  standard  escape  sequences.   Vile's  utilities  include
       programs which translate that markup into different formats:

       <u>atr2ansi</u>
              converts the markup to ANSI escape sequences.

       <u>atr2html</u>
              converts the markup to HTML (with color).

       <u>atr2text</u>
              converts the markup to plain text.

       The <u>vile-to-html</u> script uses <u>atr2html</u> to convert a text file into HTML using color.

</pre><h4><b>ENCRYPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  program  <u>vile-crypt</u>  can  be  used  to encrypt/decrypt files using the same algorithm as <u>microEmac</u>'s
       internal crypt algorithm.  This program, which uses public domain code written by  Dana  Hoggatt,  is  no
       longer used in vile, though it is provided for compatibility.

       <u>vile</u>  currently  uses  the  <u><a href="../man3/crypt.3.html">crypt</a>(3)</u>  function for encryption/decryption, which is available on most Unix
       systems.  This ensures that <u>vile</u> is able to read and write files compatibly with vi (but not  vim,  which
       uses  an  different  algorithm  derived  from  info-zip).   The editor's encryption/decryption key can be
       specified on the command line with “-k key” Text to be encrypted can be specified  as  filenames  on  the
       command line, or provided as the standard input.

       On  systems  with  a getpass() library routine, the user will be prompted for the encryption key if it is
       not given on the command line.  To accommodate systems  (such  as  linux)  where  the  getpass()  library
       routine is not interruptible from the keyboard, entering a crypt-key password which ends in ^C will cause
       the program to quit.

       See  the  help  file  for  more  information  on  <u>vile</u>'s  encryption support, including a discussion of a
       collection of macros that interface with GNU's gpg package.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>VILEINIT</b>
              Editor initialization commands in lieu of a startup file.  These are copied into  <u>[vileinit]</u>,  and
              executed.

       <b>VILE_HELP_FILE</b>
              Override the name of the help file, normally “vile.hlp”.

       <b>VILE_LIBDIR_PATH</b>
              Augment $PATH when searching for a filter program.

       <b>VILE_STARTUP_FILE</b>
              Override the name of the startup file, normally “.vilerc” (or “vile.rc” for non-UNIX systems).

       <b>VILE_STARTUP_PATH</b>
              Override the search path for the startup and help files.

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       Your  favorite  vi document, the file <u>macros.doc</u>, and the <u>vile</u> help page, available with the <u>-h</u> option or
       as the text file <u>vile.hlp</u>.

</pre><h4><b>DEBTS</b> <b>and</b> <b>CREDITS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>vile</u> was originally built from a copy of microEmacs,  so  a  large  debt  of  gratitude  is  due  to  the
       developers  of  that  program.  A lot of people have helped with code and bug reports on <u>vile</u>.  Names are
       named at the bottom of the help file.

</pre><h4><b>AUTHORS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>vile</u> was created by Paul Fox, Tom Dickey, and Kevin Buettner.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       The "<b>VI</b> <b>L</b>ike <b>E</b>macs” joke isn't really funny.  It only sounds that  way.  :-)  Other  suspicious  behavior
       should  be  reported  via  the  project mailing list, or via the web-based bug reporting system.  Both of
       these are available here:
