</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       dh_shell_completions - install shell completions for package

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>dh_shell_completions</b> [<u>debhelper</u> <u>options</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       dh_shell_completions is a debhelper addon for installing completion scripts for multiple shells,
       respecting conventions of each shell.

       It currently supports <b>bash</b>, <b>fish</b>, and <b>zsh</b>.

       To use it, <b>Build-Depends</b> on it, and pass <b>--with</b> <b>shell_completions</b> to debhelper.

       There are several modes of action, listed in <b>MODES</b>. The first has highest precedence, the last lowest.

       For all modes, mentioned files can have comment lines, starting with `#`.

       <u>$package</u> in file names, if omitted, will be the first binary package defined in debian/control.

</pre><h4><b>MODES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Generation</b>
       If a file named <u>debian/[$package.]shell-completions</u> exists, and its first non-comment line is:

               mode=gen

       Then the remaining lines should be one or more stanzas, each in the format:

               command=command-to-generate --completions _SHELL_ [--write-to _PATH_]
               shells=bash,fish,zsh
               name=foo

       <u>command</u>
           command  to  generate  a  completion script. Assumed to print to stdout unless it contains the <b>_</b><u>PATH</u><b>_</b>
           placeholder.

           <b>_SHELL_</b> is a placeholder for each shell in <u>shells</u>.

           <b>_PATH_</b> is an optional placeholder for the path to write the completion  script  to,  if  the  command
           works that way.

       <u>shells</u>
           a comma separated list of supported shell names to generate for.

       <u>name</u>
           an optional line to specify the name of generated completions other than <u>$package</u>.

       <u>command</u>  will  be  run  for each <b>_</b><u>SHELL</u><b>_</b> specified in <u>shells</u>, and installs the resulting completions with
       specified <u>name</u>.

   <b>Composite</b>
       If a file named <u>debian/[$package.]shell-completions</u> exists, and is in the format:

               $shell completions/foo      # installed as foo
               $shell completions/bar baz  # installed as baz

       then for each line, the referenced file will be installed as a completion script for <u>$shell</u>, named as the
       comments suggest.

   <b>Separate</b>
       If a file named <u>debian/[$package.]$shell-completions</u> exists for a  supported  <u>$shell</u>,  then  one  of  two
       actions are taken, depending on its content.

       If it's of the following format:

               completions/foo               # installed as foo
               completions/bar baz           # installed as baz

       then  the  referenced  file(s) will be installed as completion(s) for <u>$shell</u>, named as the comments above
       suggest.

       Otherwise, it's taken as a full completion script, and installed for <u>$shell</u>, named <u>$package</u>. This  is  in
       line with dh_bash-completion.
