</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       zsh - the Z shell

</pre><h4><b>OVERVIEW</b></h4><pre>
       Because zsh contains many features, the zsh manual has been split into a number of sections:

       <u>zsh</u>          Zsh overview (this section)
       <u>zshroadmap</u>   Informal introduction to the manual
       <u>zshmisc</u>      Anything not fitting into the other sections
       <u>zshexpn</u>      Zsh command and parameter expansion
       <u>zshparam</u>     Zsh parameters
       <u>zshoptions</u>   Zsh options
       <u>zshbuiltins</u>  Zsh built-in functions
       <u>zshzle</u>       Zsh command line editing
       <u>zshcompwid</u>   Zsh completion widgets

       <u>zshall</u>       Meta-man page containing all of the above

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Zsh  is  a  UNIX  command  interpreter (shell) usable as an interactive login shell and as a shell script
       command  processor.   Of  the  standard  shells,  zsh  most  closely  resembles  <b>ksh</b>  but  includes  many
       enhancements.   It  does  not  provide  compatibility with POSIX or other shells in its default operating
       mode:  see the section `Compatibility' below.

       Zsh has command line  editing,  builtin  spelling  correction,  programmable  command  completion,  shell
       functions (with autoloading), a history mechanism, and a host of other features.

</pre><h4><b>AUTHOR</b></h4><pre>
       Zsh  was  originally  written  by  Paul Falstad.  Zsh is now maintained by the members of the zsh-workers
       mailing list <b>&lt;<a href="mailto:zsh-workers@zsh.org">zsh-workers@zsh.org</a>&gt;</b>.   The  development  is  currently  coordinated  by  Peter  Stephenson
       <b>&lt;<a href="mailto:pws@zsh.org">pws@zsh.org</a>&gt;</b>.   The  coordinator  can be contacted at <b>&lt;<a href="mailto:coordinator@zsh.org">coordinator@zsh.org</a>&gt;</b>, but matters relating to the
       code should generally go to the mailing list.

</pre><h4><b>AVAILABILITY</b></h4><pre>
       Zsh is available from the following HTTP and anonymous FTP site.

       <b><a href="ftp://ftp.zsh.org/pub/">ftp://ftp.zsh.org/pub/</a></b>

</pre><h4><b>THE</b> <b>ZSH</b> <b>USERGUIDE</b></h4><pre>
       A  userguide is currently in preparation.  It is intended to complement the manual, with explanations and
       hints on issues where the manual can be cabbalistic, hierographic, or downright mystifying (for  example,
       the   word   `hierographic'   does   not   exist).    It   can   be   viewed  in  its  current  state  at
       <b>https://zsh.sourceforge.io/Guide/</b>.  At the time of writing, chapters dealing with startup files and their
       contents and the new completion system were essentially complete.

</pre><h4><b>INVOCATION</b></h4><pre>
       The following flags are interpreted by the shell when invoked to determine  where  the  shell  will  read
       commands from:

       <b>-c</b>     Take  the  first  argument  as a command to execute, rather than reading commands from a script or
              standard input.  If any further arguments are given, the first one is assigned to <b>$0</b>, rather  than
              being used as a positional parameter.

       <b>-i</b>     Force shell to be interactive.  It is still possible to specify a script to execute.

       <b>-s</b>     Force  shell  to  read  commands  from  the  standard input.  If the <b>-s</b> flag is not present and an
              argument is given, the first argument is taken to be the pathname of a script to execute.

       If there are any remaining arguments after option processing, and neither of the options  <b>-c</b>  or  <b>-s</b>  was
       supplied,  the  first  argument  is  taken  as  the file name of a script containing shell commands to be
       executed.  If the option <b>PATH_SCRIPT</b> is set, and the file name does not contain a  directory  path  (i.e.
       there is no `<b>/</b>' in the name), first the current directory and then the command path given by the variable
       <b>PATH</b>  are  searched  for the script.  If the option is not set or the file name contains a `<b>/</b>' it is used
       directly.

       After the first one or two arguments have been appropriated as described above, the  remaining  arguments
       are assigned to the positional parameters.

       For further options, which are common to invocation and the <b>set</b> builtin, see <u><a href="../man1/zshoptions.1.html">zshoptions</a></u>(1).

       The  long  option  `<b>--emulate</b>'  followed  (in  a separate word) by an emulation mode may be passed to the
       shell.  The emulation modes are those  described  for  the  <b>emulate</b>  builtin,  see  <u><a href="../man1/zshbuiltins.1.html">zshbuiltins</a></u>(1).   The
       `<b>--emulate</b>'  option  must  precede any other options (which might otherwise be overridden), but following
       options are honoured, so may be used to modify the requested emulation mode.   Note  that  certain  extra
       steps  are  taken to ensure a smooth emulation when this option is used compared with the <b>emulate</b> command
       within the shell: for example, variables that conflict with POSIX usage such  as  <b>path</b>  are  not  defined
       within the shell.

       Options  may  be specified by name using the <b>-o</b> option.  <b>-o</b> acts like a single-letter option, but takes a
       following string as the option name.  For example,

              <b>zsh</b> <b>-x</b> <b>-o</b> <b>shwordsplit</b> <b>scr</b>

       runs the script <b>scr</b>, setting the <b>XTRACE</b> option by the corresponding letter  `<b>-x</b>'  and  the  <b>SH_WORD_SPLIT</b>
       option  by name.  Options may be turned <u>off</u> by name by using <b>+o</b> instead of <b>-o</b>.  <b>-o</b> can be stacked up with
       preceding single-letter options, so for example `<b>-xo</b> <b>shwordsplit</b>' or `<b>-xoshwordsplit</b>'  is  equivalent  to
       `<b>-x</b> <b>-o</b> <b>shwordsplit</b>'.

       Options  may also be specified by name in GNU long option style, `<b>--</b><u>option-name</u>'.  When this is done, `<b>-</b>'
       characters in the option name are permitted: they are translated into `<b>_</b>', and  thus  ignored.   So,  for
       example,  `<b>zsh</b>  <b>--sh-word-split</b>'  invokes zsh with the <b>SH_WORD_SPLIT</b> option turned on.  Like other option
       syntaxes, options can be turned off by replacing the initial `<b>-</b>' with a `<b>+</b>';  thus  `<b>+-sh-word-split</b>'  is
       equivalent  to  `<b>--no-sh-word-split</b>'.   Unlike  other  option  syntaxes, GNU-style long options cannot be
       stacked with any other options, so for example `<b>-x-shwordsplit</b>' is an error, rather  than  being  treated
       like `<b>-x</b> <b>--shwordsplit</b>'.

       The  special  GNU-style  option  `<b>--version</b>'  is handled; it sends to standard output the shell's version
       information, then exits successfully.  `<b>--help</b>' is also handled; it sends to standard output  a  list  of
       options that can be used when invoking the shell, then exits successfully.

       Option  processing may be finished, allowing following arguments that start with `<b>-</b>' or `<b>+</b>' to be treated
       as normal arguments, in two ways.  Firstly, a lone `<b>-</b>' (or `<b>+</b>') as an  argument  by  itself  ends  option
       processing.   Secondly,  a special option `<b>--</b>' (or `<b>+-</b>'), which may be specified on its own (which is the
       standard POSIX usage) or may be stacked with preceding options (so  `<b>-x-</b>'  is  equivalent  to  `<b>-x</b>  <b>--</b>').
       Options are not permitted to be stacked after `<b>--</b>' (so `<b>-x-f</b>' is an error), but note the GNU-style option
       form discussed above, where `<b>--shwordsplit</b>' is permitted and does not end option processing.

       Except  when  the  <b>sh</b>/<b>ksh</b>  emulation  single-letter options are in effect, the option `<b>-b</b>' (or `<b>+b</b>') ends
       option processing.  `<b>-b</b>' is like `<b>--</b>', except that further single-letter options can be stacked after the
       `<b>-b</b>' and will take effect as normal.

</pre><h4><b>COMPATIBILITY</b></h4><pre>
       Zsh tries to emulate <b>sh</b> or <b>ksh</b> when it is invoked as <b>sh</b> or <b>ksh</b> respectively; more precisely, it looks  at
       the  first  letter  of  the name by which it was invoked, excluding any initial `<b>r</b>' (assumed to stand for
       `restricted'), and if that is `<b>b</b>', `<b>s</b>' or `<b>k</b>' it will emulate <b>sh</b> or <b>ksh</b>.  Furthermore, if invoked  as  <b>su</b>
       (which  happens  on  certain systems when the shell is executed by the <b>su</b> command), the shell will try to
       find an alternative name from the <b>SHELL</b> environment variable and perform emulation based on that.

       In <b>sh</b> and <b>ksh</b> compatibility modes the following parameters are not special and  not  initialized  by  the
       shell:  <b>ARGC</b>,  <b>argv</b>, <b>cdpath</b>, <b>fignore</b>, <b>fpath</b>, <b>HISTCHARS</b>, <b>mailpath</b>, <b>MANPATH</b>, <b>manpath</b>, <b>path</b>, <b>prompt</b>, <b>PROMPT</b>,
       <b>PROMPT2</b>, <b>PROMPT3</b>, <b>PROMPT4</b>, <b>psvar</b>, <b>status</b>.

       The usual zsh startup/shutdown scripts are not executed.  Login shells source  <b><a href="file:/etc/profile">/etc/profile</a></b>  followed  by
       <b>$HOME/.profile</b>.   If the <b>ENV</b> environment variable is set on invocation, <b>$ENV</b> is sourced after the profile
       scripts.  The value of <b>ENV</b> is subjected to parameter  expansion,  command  substitution,  and  arithmetic
       expansion  before  being  interpreted  as  a  pathname.  Note that the <b>PRIVILEGED</b> option also affects the
       execution of startup files.

       The following options are set if the shell  is  invoked  as  <b>sh</b>  or  <b>ksh</b>:  <b>NO_BAD_PATTERN</b>,  <b>NO_BANG_HIST</b>,
       <b>NO_BG_NICE</b>,  <b>NO_EQUALS</b>,  <b>NO_FUNCTION_ARGZERO</b>, <b>GLOB_SUBST</b>, <b>NO_GLOBAL_EXPORT</b>, <b>NO_HUP</b>, <b>INTERACTIVE_COMMENTS</b>,
       <b>KSH_ARRAYS</b>,  <b>NO_MULTIOS</b>,  <b>NO_NOMATCH</b>,  <b>NO_NOTIFY</b>,  <b>POSIX_BUILTINS</b>,   <b>NO_PROMPT_PERCENT</b>,   <b>RM_STAR_SILENT</b>,
       <b>SH_FILE_EXPANSION</b>,   <b>SH_GLOB</b>,   <b>SH_OPTION_LETTERS</b>,   <b>SH_WORD_SPLIT</b>.    Additionally   the   <b>BSD_ECHO</b>  and
       <b>IGNORE_BRACES</b> options are set if zsh is  invoked  as  <b>sh</b>.   Also,  the  <b>KSH_OPTION_PRINT</b>,  <b>LOCAL_OPTIONS</b>,
       <b>PROMPT_BANG</b>, <b>PROMPT_SUBST</b> and <b>SINGLE_LINE_ZLE</b> options are set if zsh is invoked as <b>ksh</b>.

       Please  note  that, whilst reasonable efforts are taken to address incompatibilities when they arise, zsh
       does not guarantee complete emulation of other shells, nor POSIX compliance. For more information on  the
       differences   between   zsh   and   other   shells,   please  refer  to  chapter  2  of  the  shell  FAQ,
       <b>https://www.zsh.org/FAQ/</b>.

</pre><h4><b>RESTRICTED</b> <b>SHELL</b></h4><pre>
       When the basename of the command used to invoke zsh starts with the letter `<b>r</b>' or the `<b>-r</b>'  command  line
       option  is  supplied  at  invocation,  the  shell becomes restricted.  Emulation mode is determined after
       stripping the letter `<b>r</b>' from the invocation name.  The following are disabled in restricted mode:

       •      changing directories with the <b>cd</b> builtin

       •      changing or  unsetting  the  <b>EGID</b>,  <b>EUID</b>,  <b>GID</b>,  <b>HISTFILE</b>,  <b>HISTSIZE</b>,  <b>IFS</b>,  <b>LD_AOUT_LIBRARY_PATH</b>,
              <b>LD_AOUT_PRELOAD</b>, <b>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</b>, <b>LD_PRELOAD</b>, <b>MODULE_PATH</b>, <b>module_path</b>, <b>PATH</b>, <b>path</b>, <b>SHELL</b>, <b>UID</b> and
              <b>USERNAME</b> parameters

       •      specifying command names containing <b>/</b>

       •      specifying command pathnames using <b>hash</b>

       •      redirecting output to files

       •      using the <b>exec</b> builtin command to replace the shell with another command

       •      using <b>jobs</b> <b>-Z</b> to overwrite the shell process' argument and environment space

       •      using the <b>ARGV0</b> parameter to override <b>argv[0]</b> for external commands

       •      turning off restricted mode with <b>set</b> <b>+r</b> or <b>unsetopt</b> <b>RESTRICTED</b>

       These restrictions are enforced after processing the startup files.  The startup files should set up <b>PATH</b>
       to  point to a directory of commands which can be safely invoked in the restricted environment.  They may
       also add further restrictions by disabling selected builtins.

       Restricted mode can also be activated any time  by  setting  the  <b>RESTRICTED</b>  option.   This  immediately
       enables all the restrictions described above even if the shell still has not processed all startup files.

       A  shell  <u>Restricted</u>  <u>Mode</u> is an outdated way to restrict what users may do:  modern systems have better,
       safer and more reliable ways to confine user actions, such as <u>chroot</u> <u>jails</u>, <u>containers</u> and <u>zones</u>.

       A restricted shell is very difficult to implement safely.  The feature may be removed in a future version
       of zsh.

       It is important to realise that the restrictions only apply to the shell, not to  the  commands  it  runs
       (except  for some shell builtins).  While a restricted shell can only run the restricted list of commands
       accessible via the predefined `<b>PATH</b>' variable, it does not prevent those commands from running any  other
       command.

       As an example, if `<b>env</b>' is among the list of <u>allowed</u> commands, then it allows the user to run any command
       as `<b>env</b>' is not a shell builtin command and can run arbitrary executables.

       So  when implementing a restricted shell framework it is important to be fully aware of what actions each
       of the <u>allowed</u> commands or features (which may be regarded as <u>modules</u>) can perform.

       Many commands can have their behaviour affected by environment variables.   Except  for  the  few  listed
       above, zsh does not restrict the setting of environment variables.

       If  a  `<b>perl</b>',  `<b>python</b>',  `<b>bash</b>', or other general purpose interpreted script it treated as a restricted
       command, the user can work around the restriction by setting specially crafted `<b>PERL5LIB</b>',  `<b>PYTHONPATH</b>',
       `<b>BASHENV</b>'  (etc.)  environment  variables.  On GNU systems, any command can be made to run arbitrary code
       when performing character set conversion (including zsh itself) by  setting  a  `<b>GCONV_PATH</b>'  environment
       variable.  Those are only a few examples.

       Bear  in  mind that, contrary to some other shells, `<b>readonly</b>' is not a security feature in zsh as it can
       be undone and so cannot be used to mitigate the above.

       A restricted shell only works if the allowed commands are few and carefully written so as  not  to  grant
       more  access  to users than intended.  It is also important to restrict what zsh module the user may load
       as some of them, such as `<b>zsh/system</b>',  `<b>zsh/mapfile</b>'  and  `<b>zsh/files</b>',  allow  bypassing  most  of  the
       restrictions.

</pre><h4><b>STARTUP/SHUTDOWN</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       Commands  are  first  read  from  <b>/etc/zsh/zshenv</b>;  this  cannot  be overridden.  Subsequent behaviour is
       modified by the <b>RCS</b> and <b>GLOBAL_RCS</b> options; the former affects all startup files, while the  second  only
       affects global startup files (those shown here with an path starting with a <b>/</b>).  If one of the options is
       unset  at  any  point,  any subsequent startup file(s) of the corresponding type will not be read.  It is
       also possible for a file in <b>$ZDOTDIR</b> to re-enable <b>GLOBAL_RCS</b>. Both <b>RCS</b> and <b>GLOBAL_RCS</b> are set by default.

       Commands are then read from <b>$ZDOTDIR/.zshenv</b>.  If the shell is a login  shell,  commands  are  read  from
       <b>/etc/zsh/zprofile</b> and then <b>$ZDOTDIR/.zprofile</b>.  Then, if the shell is interactive, commands are read from
       <b>/etc/zsh/zshrc</b>  and  then  <b>$ZDOTDIR/.zshrc</b>.   Finally, if the shell is a login shell, <b>/etc/zsh/zlogin</b> and
       <b>$ZDOTDIR/.zlogin</b> are read.

       When a login shell exits, the files <b>$ZDOTDIR/.zlogout</b> and then <b>/etc/zsh/zlogout</b> are read.   This  happens
       with  either an explicit exit via the <b>exit</b> or <b>logout</b> commands, or an implicit exit by reading end-of-file
       from the terminal.  However, if the shell terminates due to <b>exec</b>'ing another process,  the  logout  files
       are  not read.  These are also affected by the <b>RCS</b> and <b>GLOBAL_RCS</b> options.  Note also that the <b>RCS</b> option
       affects the saving of history files, i.e. if <b>RCS</b> is unset when the shell exits, no history file  will  be
       saved.

       If  <b>ZDOTDIR</b>  is  unset,  <b>HOME</b>  is  used  instead.   Files listed above as being in <b><a href="file:/etc">/etc</a></b> may be in another
       directory, depending on the installation.

       As <b>/etc/zsh/zshenv</b> is run for all instances of zsh, it is important that it be kept as small as possible.
       In particular, it is a good idea to put code that does not need to be run for every single shell behind a
       test of the form `<b>if</b> <b>[[</b> <b>-o</b> <b>rcs</b> <b>]];</b> <b>then</b> <b>...</b>' so that it will not be executed when zsh is invoked with the
       `<b>-f</b>' option.

       Any of these files may be pre-compiled with the <b>zcompile</b> builtin  command  (see  <u><a href="../man1/zshbuiltins.1.html">zshbuiltins</a></u>(1)).   If  a
       compiled  file  exists  (named  for  the  original file plus the <b>.zwc</b> extension) and it is newer than the
       original file, the compiled file will be used instead.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
