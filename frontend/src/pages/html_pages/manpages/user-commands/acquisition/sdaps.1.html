</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       sdaps — scripts for data acquisition with paper-based surveys

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>sdaps</b> [<b>-h</b>] <u>project</u> <u>command</u> <u>command_args</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       SDAPS  is  an  open source (GPLv3, LPPL) optical mark recognition (OMR) program.  It is written in python
       and has an integrated workflow with both LibreOffice and LaTeX to create questionnaires.

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       This manual page is not exhaustive. It was written by the Debian project to give users a  quick  hint  on
       how to run sdaps and get help, but no effort was made to document the complete command. This is because a
       completely new upstream release is on its way, requiring a complete rewrite of the manual page as well.

       In order to get full help right now, run sdaps <b>-h</b> or any of the commands listed there without arguments.

</pre><h4><b>AUTHORS</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual page was written by Dominik George &lt;<a href="mailto:nik@naturalnet.de">nik@naturalnet.de</a>&gt; for the Debian distribution. Released
       under the same licence as SDAPS itself; see <u>/usr/share/doc/sdaps/copyright</u>.
