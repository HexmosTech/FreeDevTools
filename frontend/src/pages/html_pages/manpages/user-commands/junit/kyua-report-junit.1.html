       kyua report-junit — Generates a JUnit report with the results of a test suite run

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>kyua</b> <b>report-junit</b> [<b>--output</b> <u>path</u>] [<b>--results-file</b> <u>file</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>kyua</b> <b>report-junit</b> command provides a simple mechanism to generate JUnit reports of the execution of a
       test suite.  The command processes a results file and then generates a single XML file that complies with
       the JUnit XSchema.

       The  JUnit  output  is  static  and  self-contained,  so  it  can  easily  be plugged into any continuous
       integration system, like Jenkins.

       The following subcommand options are recognized:

       <b>--output</b> <u>directory</u>
           Specifies the file into which to store the JUnit report.

       <b>--results-file</b> <u>path</u>, <b>-s</b> <u>path</u>
           Specifies the results file to operate on.  Defaults to ‘LATEST’, which causes  <b>kyua</b>  <b>report-junit</b>  to
           automatically load the latest results file from the current test suite.

           The following values are accepted:

           ‘LATEST’
               Requests  the  load of the latest results file available for the test suite rooted at the current
               directory.

           Directory
               Requests the load of the latest results file available for the test suite  rooted  at  the  given
               directory.

           Test suite name
               Requests the load of the latest results file available for the given test suite.

           Results identifier
               Requests the load of a specific results file.

           Explicit file name (aka everything else)
               Load the specified results file.

           See “Results files” for more details.

   <b>Caveats</b>
       Because  of  limitations  in  the  JUnit  XML  schema, not all the data collected by Kyua can be properly
       represented in JUnit reports.  However, because test data are extremely useful  for  debugging  purposes,
       the <b>kyua</b> <b>report-junit</b> command shovels these data into the JUnit output.  In particular:

       <b>•</b>   The test case metadata values are prepended to the test case's standard error output.

       <b>•</b>   Test cases that report expected failures as their results are recorded as passed.  The fact that they
           failed  as expected is recorded in the test case's standard error output along with the corresponding
           reason.

   <b>Results</b> <b>files</b>
       Results files contain, as their name implies, the results of the execution of a test  suite.   Each  test
       suite  executed  by <u><a href="../man1/kyua-test.1.html">kyua-test</a></u>(1) generates a new results file, and such results files can be loaded later
       on by inspection commands such as <u><a href="../man1/kyua-report.1.html">kyua-report</a></u>(1) to analyze their contents.

       Results files support identifier-based lookups and also path name lookups.  The differences  between  the
       two are described below.

       The  default naming scheme for the results files provides simple support for identifier-based lookups and
       historical recording of test suite runs.  Each results file is given an identifier derived from the  test
       suite  that  generated  it  and the time the test suite was run.  Kyua can later look up results files by
       these fields.

       The identifier follows this pattern:

             &lt;test_suite&gt;.&lt;YYYYMMDD&gt;-&lt;HHMMSS&gt;-&lt;uuuuuu&gt;

       where ‘test_suite’ is the path to the root of the test suite that was run with all  slashes  replaced  by
       underscores and ‘YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-uuuuuu’ is a timestamp with microsecond resolution.

       When  using  the  default  naming scheme, results files are stored in the <u><a href="file:~/.kyua/store/">~/.kyua/store/</a></u> subdirectory and
       each file holds a name of the form:

             <a href="file:~/.kyua/store/results.">~/.kyua/store/results.</a>&lt;identifier&gt;.db

       Results   files   are    simple    SQLite    databases    with    the    schema    described    in    the
       <u>/usr/share/kyua/store/schema_v?.sql</u>  files.   For  details  on  the  schema,  please refer to the heavily
       commented SQL file.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>kyua</b> <b>report-junit</b> command always returns 0.

       Additional exit codes may be returned as described in <u><a href="../man1/kyua.1.html">kyua</a></u>(1).

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Workflow</b> <b>with</b> <b>results</b> <b>files</b>
       If one runs the following command twice in a row:

             kyua test -k /usr/tests/Kyuafile

       the two executions will generate two different files with names like:

             <a href="file:~/.kyua/store/results.usr_tests.20140731-150500-196784.db">~/.kyua/store/results.usr_tests.20140731-150500-196784.db</a>
             <a href="file:~/.kyua/store/results.usr_tests.20140731-151730-997451.db">~/.kyua/store/results.usr_tests.20140731-151730-997451.db</a>

       Taking advantage of the default naming scheme, the following commands would all generate a report for the
       results of the <u>latest</u> execution of the test suite:

             cd /usr/tests &amp;&amp; kyua report-junit
             cd /usr/tests &amp;&amp; kyua report-junit --results-file=LATEST
             kyua report-junit --results-file=/usr/tests
             kyua report-junit --results-file=usr_tests
             kyua report-junit --results-file=usr_tests.20140731-151730-997451

       But it is also possible to explicitly load data for older runs or from explicitly-named files:

             kyua report-junit \
                 --results-file=usr_tests.20140731-150500-196784
             kyua report-junit \
                 --results-file=<a href="file:~/.kyua/store/results.usr_tests.20140731-150500-196784.db">~/.kyua/store/results.usr_tests.20140731-150500-196784.db</a>
