   <b>NAME:</b>
              Hardware Probe (hw-probe) A tool to probe for hardware, check operability and find drivers

   <b>DESCRIPTION:</b>
              Hardware Probe (hw-probe) is a tool to probe for hardware, check its operability and upload result
              to the BSD hardware database.

              By  creating  probes  you  contribute  to  the  "HDD/SSD  Desktop-Class  Reliability  Test" study:
              https://github.com/linuxhw/SMART

   <b>USAGE:</b>
              hw-probe [options]

   <b>EXAMPLE:</b>
              hw-probe <b>-all</b> <b>-upload</b>

   <b>PRIVACY:</b>
              Private information (including the username, machine's  hostname,  IP  addresses,  MAC  addresses,
              UUIDs and serial numbers) is NOT uploaded to the database.

              The  tool  uploads  32-byte  prefix  of  salted SHA512 hash of MAC addresses and serial numbers to
              properly identify unique computers and hard drives. UUIDs are  decorated  in  the  same  way,  but
              formatted  like  regular  UUIDs  in  order  to  save readability of logs. All the data is uploaded
              securely via HTTPS.

   <b>INFORMATION</b> <b>OPTIONS:</b>

       <b>-h</b>|-help

              Print this help.

       <b>-v</b>|-version

              Print version info.

       <b>-dumpversion</b>

              Print the tool version (1.6) and don't do anything else.

   <b>GENERAL</b> <b>OPTIONS:</b>

       <b>-all</b>

              Probe for hardware.

       <b>-log-level</b> N

              Set the logging level to N.  Available values:

              - minimal - default - maximal

       <b>-minimal</b>|-min

              Collect minimal number of logs. Equal to <b>--log-level</b>=<u>min</u>.

       <b>-maximal</b>|-max

              Collect maximal number of logs. Equal to <b>--log-level</b>=<u>max</u>.

       <b>-enable</b> LIST

              Comma separated list of logs to enable in addition to current log level.

       <b>-disable</b> LIST

              Comma separated list of logs to disable in current log level. Some logs cannot  be  disabled.  For
              example, you can disable collecting of 'fstab', but you cannot disable logging of 'smartctl'.

       <b>-check</b>

              Check devices operability. Test performance of CPU, memory, graphics cards and drives.

       <b>-check-extended</b>

              Perform extended check.

       <b>-upload</b>

              Upload result to the hardware database. You will get a permanent URL to view the probe.

              By  use  of  this  option  you  confirm  uploading  of 32-byte prefix of salted SHA512 hash of MAC
              addresses and serial numbers to prevent duplication of computers in the DB.

       <b>-hwinfo-path</b> PATH

              Path to a local hwinfo binary.

       <b>-proxy</b> ADDRESS:PORT

              Set outgoing http/https proxy using syntax: proxy.domain.local:3128

   <b>INVENTORY</b> <b>OPTIONS:</b>

       <b>-i</b>|-inventory-id ID

              Mark the probe by inventory ID.

       <b>-generate-inventory-id</b>

              Generate new inventory ID.

       <b>-email</b> ADDR

              Email for node status notifications.

   <b>MONITORING</b> <b>OPTIONS:</b>

       <b>-start</b>

              Start monitoring of the node.

       <b>-stop</b>

              Stop monitoring of the node.

       <b>-remind-inventory</b>

              Remind node inventory ID.
