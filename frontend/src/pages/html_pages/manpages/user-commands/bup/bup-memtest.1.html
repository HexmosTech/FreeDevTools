</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       bup-memtest - test bup memory usage statistics

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       bup memtest [options...]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       bup memtest opens the list of pack indexes in your bup repository, then searches the list for a series of
       nonexistent objects, printing memory usage statistics after each cycle.

       Because  of the way Unix systems work, the output will usually show a large (and unchanging) value in the
       VmSize column, because mapping the index files in the first place  takes  a  certain  amount  of  virtual
       address  space.  However, this virtual memory usage is entirely virtual; it doesn’t take any of your RAM.
       Over time, bup uses <u>parts</u> of the indexes, which need to be loaded from disk, and this is what  causes  an
       increase in the VmRSS column.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       -n, --number=<u>number</u>
              set the number of objects to search for during each cycle (ie.  before printing a line of output)

       -c, --cycles=<u>cycles</u>
              set  the number of cycles (ie.  the number of lines of output after the first).  The first line of
              output is always 0 (ie.  the baseline before searching for any objects).

       --ignore-midx
              ignore any .midx files created by bup midx.  This allows you to compare  memory  performance  with
              and without using midx.

       --existing
              search  for  existing  objects instead of searching for random nonexistent ones.  This can greatly
              affect memory usage and performance.  Note that most of the time, bup save spends most of its time
              searching for nonexistent objects, since existing ones are probably in unmodified  files  that  we
              won’t  be  trying  to back up anyway.  So the default behaviour reflects real bup performance more
              accurately.  But you might want this option anyway just to make sure you  haven’t  made  searching
              for existing objects much worse than before.

</pre><h4><b>DISCUSSION</b></h4><pre>
       When  optimizing  bup  indexing,  the  first goal is to keep the VmRSS reasonably low.  However, it might
       eventually be necessary to swap in all the indexes, simply because you’re searching for a lot of objects,
       and this will cause your RSS to grow as large as VmSize eventually.

       The key word here is <u>eventually</u>.  As long as VmRSS grows reasonably slowly, the amount of  disk  activity
       caused  by accessing pack indexes is reasonably small.  If it grows quickly, bup will probably spend most
       of its time swapping index data from disk instead of actually running your backup, so  backups  will  run
       very slowly.

       The  purpose  of bup memtest is to give you an idea of how fast your memory usage is growing, and to help
       in optimizing bup for better memory use.  If you have memory problems you might  be  asked  to  send  the
       output of bup memtest to help diagnose the problems.

       Tip: try using bup midx -a or bup midx -f to see if it helps reduce your memory usage.

       Trivia:  index  memory  usage  in  bup  (or  git)  is only really a problem when adding a large number of
       previously unseen objects.  This is because for each object, we need to absolutely confirm that it  isn’t
       already in the database, which requires us to search through <u>all</u> the existing pack indexes to ensure that
       none  of  them contain the object in question.  In the more obvious case of searching for objects that <u>do</u>
       exist, the objects being searched for are typically related in some way, which means  they  probably  all
       exist in a small number of packfiles, so memory usage will be constrained to just those packfile indexes.

       Since  git  users  typically  don’t add a lot of files in a single run, git doesn’t really need a program
       like bup midx.  bup, on the other hand, spends most of its time backing up files it hasn’t  seen  before,
       so its memory usage patterns are different.
