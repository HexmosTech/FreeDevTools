</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       bup  split concatenates the contents of the given files (or if no filenames are given, reads from stdin),
       splits the content into chunks of around 8k using a rolling checksum algorithm, and saves the chunks into
       a bup repository.  Chunks which have  previously  been  stored  are  not  stored  again  (ie.   they  are
       `deduplicated').

       Because  of  the  way the rolling checksum works, chunks tend to be very stable across changes to a given
       file, including adding, deleting, and changing bytes.

       For example, if you use bup split to back up an XML dump of a database, and the XML file changes slightly
       from one run to the next, nearly all the data will still be deduplicated and  the  size  of  each  backup
       after the first will typically be quite small.

       Another  technique is to pipe the output of the <a href="../man1/tar.1.html">tar</a>(1) or <a href="../man1/cpio.1.html">cpio</a>(1) programs to bup split.  When individual
       files in the tarball change slightly or are added or removed, bup still processes the  remainder  of  the
       tarball efficiently.  (Note that bup save is usually a more efficient way to accomplish this, however.)

       To get the data back, use <a href="../man1/bup-join.1.html">bup-join</a>(1).

</pre><h4><b>MODES</b></h4><pre>
       These options select the primary behavior of the command, with -n being the most likely choice.

       -n, --name=<u>name</u>
              after  creating  the dataset, create a git branch named <u>name</u> so that it can be accessed using that
              name.  If <u>name</u> already exists, the new dataset will be considered a descendant of  the  old  <u>name</u>.
              (Thus,  you  can continually create new datasets with the same name, and later view the history of
              that dataset to see how it has changed over time.)  The original data will also be available as  a
              top-level file named “data” in the VFS, accessible via bup fuse, bup ftp, etc.

       -t, --tree
              output the git tree id of the resulting dataset.

       -c, --commit
              output the git commit id of the resulting dataset.

       -b, --blobs
              output  a  series of git blob ids that correspond to the chunks in the dataset.  Incompatible with
              -n, -t, and -c.

       --noop read the data and split it into blocks based on the “bupsplit”  rolling  checksum  algorithm,  but
              don’t  store  anything  in the repo.  Can be combined with -b or -t to compute (but not store) the
              git blobs or tree ids for the dataset.  This is mostly useful for benchmarking and validating  the
              bupsplit algorithm.  Incompatible with -n and -c.

       --copy like  --noop, but also write the data to stdout.  This can be useful for benchmarking the speed of
              read+bupsplit+write for large amounts of data.  Incompatible with -n, -t, -c, and -b.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       -r, --remote=<u>host</u>:<u>path</u>
              save the backup set to the given remote server.  If <u>path</u> is omitted, uses the default path on  the
              remote  server  (you  still need to include the `:').  The connection to the remote server is made
              with SSH.  If you’d like to specify which port, user or private key to use for the SSH connection,
              we recommend you use the <a href="file:~/.ssh/config">~/.ssh/config</a> file.  Even though the destination is remote, a  local  bup
              repository is still required.

       -d, --date=<u>seconds-since-epoch</u>
              specify the date inscribed in the commit (seconds since 1970-01-01).

       -q, --quiet
              disable progress messages.

       -v, --verbose
              increase verbosity (can be used more than once).

       --git-ids
              stdin  is  a list of git object ids instead of raw data.  bup split will read the contents of each
              named git object (if it exists in the bup repository) and split it.   This  might  be  useful  for
              converting  a git repository with large binary files to use bup-style hashsplitting instead.  This
              option is probably most useful when combined with --keep-boundaries.

       --keep-boundaries
              if multiple filenames are given on the command line, they are normally concatenated together as if
              the content all came from a single file.  That is, the set of blobs/trees produced is identical to
              what it  would  have  been  if  there  had  been  a  single  input  file.   However,  if  you  use
              --keep-boundaries,  each  file is split separately.  You still only get a single tree or commit or
              series of blobs, but each blob comes from only one of the files; the end of one of the input files
              always ends a blob.

       --bench
              print benchmark timings to stderr.

       --max-pack-size=<u>bytes</u>
              never create git packfiles larger than the given number of bytes.  Default  is  1  billion  bytes.
              Usually there is no reason to change this.

       --max-pack-objects=<u>numobjs</u>
              never  create  git  packfiles with more than the given number of objects.  Default is 200 thousand
              objects.  Usually there is no reason to change this.

       --fanout=<u>numobjs</u>
              when splitting very large files, try and keep the number of elements in trees  to  an  average  of
              <u>numobjs</u>.

       --bwlimit=<u>bytes/sec</u>
              don’t  transmit  more than <u>bytes/sec</u> bytes per second to the server.  This is good for making your
              backups not suck up all your network bandwidth.  Use a suffix like k, M, or G to specify multiples
              of 1024, 1024*1024, 1024*1024*1024 respectively.

       -<u>#</u>, --compress=<u>#</u>
              set the compression level to # (a value from 0-9, where 9 is the highest and 0 is no compression).
              The default is 1 (fast, loose compression)
