</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       nbdkit-protocol - which parts of the NBD protocol nbdkit supports

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        nbdkit [-n|--newstyle] [--mask-handshake MASK] [--no-mc|--no-meta-contexts]
               [--no-sr|--no-structured-replies] [-o|--oldstyle] [...]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This page documents the level of support in nbdkit for various parts of the NBD protocol.

</pre><h4><b>NEW</b> <b>STYLE</b> <b>VS</b> <b>OLD</b> <b>STYLE</b> <b>PROTOCOL</b></h4><pre>
       The NBD protocol comes in two incompatible forms that we call "oldstyle" and "newstyle".  Unfortunately
       which protocol you should use depends on the client and cannot be known in advance, nor can it be
       negotiated from the server side.

       nbdkit defaults to the newstyle protocol since nbdkit ≥ 1.3 (the command line flag <u>-n</u> or <u>--newstyle</u> is
       ignored for backwards compatibility with older versions).  The newstyle protocol is better in every
       respect than the oldstyle protocol and you should prefer it if possible.  The newstyle protocol also
       includes extensions where a client may request structured replies for even more capabilities, such as
       sparse reads or meta contexts for obtaining block status.  By default, nbdkit advertises as many features
       as it can support (in some cases, this can be limited by what callbacks the plugin handles), even if the
       client does not negotiate to use all advertised features.

       Nbdkit also includes some options that are useful mainly when performing integration tests, for proving
       whether clients have sane fallback behavior when dealing various older servers permitted by the NBD
       protocol.  The following options intentionally disable optional parts of the NBD protocol, with
       successively larger impacts:

       <b>--no-mc</b>
       <b>--no-meta-contexts</b>
           Force  the  newstyle  protocol  to treat all requests for meta context negotiation from the client as
           unsupported; the client will be unable to query block status.  By default, nbdkit gracefully  handles
           all  meta  context  requests,  even  though  it currently supports only the "base:allocation" context
           (possibly by synthesizing a context that represents an all-data disk when the  plugin  lacks  support
           for extents); but treating meta contexts as unsupported is useful for emulating nbd-server 3.25.

       <b>--no-sr</b>
       <b>--no-structured-replies</b>
           Force  the  newstyle  protocol to decline any client request for structured replies; this is stronger
           than <u>--no-meta-contexts</u> in that it also disables the opportunity for sparse reads.   This  is  useful
           for emulating nbd-server 3.24.

       <b>--mask-handshake=</b>MASK
           Alter  the  mask  of  which  particular  global  features  are  advertised during new-style handshake
           (defaulting to all supported bits set).  Clearing bit 0 (the low order bit) limits a client to  using
           just "NBD_OPT_EXPORT_NAME" (incompatible with TLS, and includes all effects of <u>--no-sr</u>); clearing bit
           1  causes  the handshake to send more padding bytes in response to "NBD_OPT_EXPORT_NAME".  Other bits
           in the mask will only have an effect if the NBD protocol is extended in the future  to  define  other
           global bits.

       <b>-o</b>
       <b>--oldstyle</b>
           Force  the oldstyle protocol.  In this mode, <u>--no-meta-contexts</u>, <u>--no-sr</u> and <u>--mask-handshake</u> have no
           effect.

   <b>Errors</b> <b>seen</b> <b>if</b> <b>using</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>protocol</b>
       If you use qemu ≤ 2.5 without the exportname field against a newstyle server, it will give the error:

        Server requires an export name

       If you use qemu ≤ 2.5 with the exportname field against an oldstyle server, it will give the error:

        Server does not support export names

       If you use the oldstyle protocol with nbd-client ≥ 3.10, it will give the error:

        Error: It looks like you're trying to connect to an oldstyle server.

   <b>NBD</b> <b>protocol</b> <b>and</b> <b>port</b> <b>number</b>
       Port 10809/tcp is reserved by IANA for the NBD protocol, but you can use nbdkit on any port  or  on  Unix
       domain sockets.

       The  NBD protocol specification claims that you should always use newstyle when using port 10809, and use
       oldstyle on all other ports, but this claim is not based on the reality  of  what  NBD  servers  do,  and
       nbdkit does not require or encourage this.

</pre><h4><b>NBD</b> <b>PROTOCOL</b> <b>FEATURES</b> <b>SUPPORTED</b> <b>BY</b> <b>NBDKIT</b></h4><pre>
       newstyle protocol
           Supported in nbdkit ≥ 1.1.12, and the default in nbdkit ≥ 1.3.

       export names
           Partially  supported in nbdkit ≥ 1.1.12.  Support for plugins to read the client export name added in
           nbdkit ≥ 1.15.2.

           Versions of nbdkit before 1.16 could advertise a single export name to clients, via a now  deprecated
           side  effect of the <u>-e</u> option.  In nbdkit 1.15.2, plugins could read the client requested export name
           using <b><a href="../man3/nbdkit_export_name.3.html">nbdkit_export_name</a></b>(3) and serve different content.  In nbdkit 1.21.22, plugins could  implement
           ".list_exports" to answer "NBD_OPT_LIST" queries.

       "NBD_FLAG_NO_ZEROES"
           Supported in nbdkit ≥ 1.1.13.

           This protocol optimization avoids sending a useless block of zero bytes during protocol negotiation.

       "NBD_CMD_WRITE_ZEROES"
           Supported in nbdkit ≥ 1.1.13.

       TLS with X.509 certificates
           Supported in nbdkit ≥ 1.1.15.

       TLS with Pre-Shared Keys (PSK)
           Supported in nbdkit ≥ 1.4.0.

       "NBD_OPT_GO"
           Supported in nbdkit ≥ 1.5.3.

           This protocol enhancement allows the server to return errors when negotiating the export name.

       "NBD_OPT_INFO"
           Supported in nbdkit ≥ 1.9.3.

           This  protocol  enhancement  allows  a  client  to  inspect details about the export without actually
           connecting.

       "NBD_FLAG_CAN_MULTI_CONN"
           Supported in nbdkit ≥ 1.9.9.

       Structured Replies
           Supported in nbdkit ≥ 1.11.8.

           However we don’t expose the capability to send structured replies to plugins  yet,  nor  do  we  send
           human-readable error messages using this facility.

           In  nbdkit  ≥  1.13.9,  the  command-line  option  <u>--no-sr</u>  can be used to disable server support for
           structured replies, for testing client fallbacks; disabling structured replies also disables features
           like block status queries that depend on structured replies.

       Metadata Querying
           Supported in nbdkit ≥ 1.11.8.

           In nbdkit ≥ 1.37.9, the command-line option <u>--no-meta-contexts</u> can be used to disable server  support
           for meta contexts, for testing client fallbacks.

       Block Status
           Supported in nbdkit ≥ 1.11.10.

           Only "base:allocation" (ie. querying which parts of an image are sparse) is supported.

           Sparse  reads  (using  "NBD_REPLY_TYPE_OFFSET_HOLE"  are not directly supported, but a client can use
           block status to infer which portions of the export do not need to be read.

       "NBD_FLAG_DF"
           Supported in nbdkit ≥ 1.11.11.

           This protocol extension allows a client to force an all-or-none read when structured replies  are  in
           effect. However, the flag is a no-op until we extend the plugin API to allow a fragmented read in the
           first place.

       "NBD_CMD_CACHE"
           Supported in nbdkit ≥ 1.13.4.

           This  protocol extension allows a client to inform the server about intent to access a portion of the
           export, to allow the server an opportunity to cache things appropriately.

       "NBD_CMD_FLAG_FAST_ZERO"
           Supported in nbdkit ≥ 1.15.0.

           This protocol extension allows a server to advertise that it can rank all zero requests  as  fast  or
           slow,  at which point the client can make fast zero requests which fail immediately with "ENOTSUP" if
           the request is no faster than a counterpart write would be, while normal zero requests still  benefit
           from compressed network traffic regardless of the time taken.

       "NBD_INFO_NAME", "NBD_INFO_DESCRIPTION"
           Supported in nbdkit ≥ 1.23.6.

           These  protocol  extensions  allow  a  client  to  learn  more  information  about  an  export during
           "NBD_OPT_GO".  The ".default_export" callback can inform a client of a canonical  non-empty  name  in
           place of the default export "", and the ".export_description" callback can give a client more details
           about the export.

       "NBD_INFO_BLOCK_SIZE"
           Supported in nbdkit ≥ 1.30.

       Resize Extension
           <u>Not</u> <u>supported</u>.

       Extended Headers Extension
           <u>Not</u> <u>supported</u>.
