</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       netmate - displays network protocol headers in uniform RFC like format

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>netmate</b> filename

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Netmate  is  a  GTK+  program that shows network protocols headers in 32-bit aligned fields, identical as
       they are represented in Request for Comments (RFCs).  It can be used to learn  and  teach  about  network
       protocols and to understand their functionality and collaboration.

       This tool supports input files in pcap(ng) format as they are created by tcpdump, wireshark or other code
       based on libpcap.

       Netmate  is  written in C and released under the GNU General Public License.  It was inspired by netdude,
       that is not further developed any more.

       Currently the following network protocols are supported:
       - Layer 2: Ethernet, SLL (Linux Cooked)
       - Layer 3: ARP, ICMP, ICMPv6, IPv4, IPv6
       - Layer 4: TCP, UDP

</pre><h4><b>DEVELOPMENT</b></h4><pre>
       This tool is still under development! Please send any further wishes, feature  requests  or  problems  in
       compiling  and  execution  to  <a href="mailto:ruport@f00l.de">ruport@f00l.de</a>.   Also  send  me any more network protocols you want to be
       supported in future releases.

       For further information visit the netmate homepage at <a href="http://f00l.de/netmate/">http://f00l.de/netmate/</a>.
