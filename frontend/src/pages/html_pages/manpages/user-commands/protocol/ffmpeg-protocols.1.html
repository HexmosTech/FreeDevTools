</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       ffmpeg-protocols - FFmpeg protocols

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This document describes the input and output protocols provided by the libavformat library.

</pre><h4><b>PROTOCOL</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The libavformat library provides some generic global options, which can be set on all the protocols. In
       addition each protocol may support so-called private options, which are specific for that component.

       Options may be set by specifying -<u>option</u> <u>value</u> in the FFmpeg tools, or by setting the value explicitly in
       the "AVFormatContext" options or using the <u>libavutil/opt.h</u> API for programmatic use.

       The list of supported options follows:

       <b>protocol_whitelist</b> <u>list</u> <b>(</b><u>input</u><b>)</b>
           Set a ","-separated list of allowed protocols. "ALL" matches all protocols. Protocols prefixed by "-"
           are disabled.  All protocols are allowed by default but protocols used by an another protocol (nested
           protocols) are restricted to a per protocol subset.

</pre><h4><b>PROTOCOLS</b></h4><pre>
       Protocols  are  configured  elements  in  FFmpeg  that  enable  access to resources that require specific
       protocols.

       When you configure your FFmpeg build, all the supported protocols are enabled by default.  You  can  list
       all available ones using the configure option "--list-protocols".

       You  can  disable  all  the  protocols  using the configure option "--disable-protocols", and selectively
       enable a protocol using the option "--enable-protocol=<u>PROTOCOL</u>", or you can disable a particular protocol
       using the option "--disable-protocol=<u>PROTOCOL</u>".

       The option "-protocols" of the ff* tools will display the list of supported protocols.

       All protocols accept the following options:

       <b>rw_timeout</b>
           Maximum time to wait for (network) read/write operations to complete, in microseconds.

       A description of the currently available protocols follows.

   <b>amqp</b>
       Advanced Message Queueing Protocol (AMQP) version 0-9-1 is a broker based publish-subscribe communication
       protocol.

       FFmpeg must be compiled with --enable-librabbitmq to support AMQP. A separate AMQP broker  must  also  be
       run. An example open-source AMQP broker is RabbitMQ.

       After starting the broker, an FFmpeg client may stream data to the broker using the command:

               ffmpeg -re -i input -f mpegts amqp://[[user]:[password]@]hostname[:port][/vhost]

       Where  hostname  and  port  (default  is  5672)  is  the address of the broker. The client may also set a
       user/password for authentication. The default for both fields is "guest". Name of virtual host on  broker
       can be set with vhost. The default value is "/".

       Muliple subscribers may stream from the broker using the command:

               ffplay amqp://[[user]:[password]@]hostname[:port][/vhost]

       In  RabbitMQ  all  data  published  to the broker flows through a specific exchange, and each subscribing
       client has an assigned queue/buffer. When a packet arrives at an exchange, it may be copied to a client's
       queue depending on the exchange and routing_key fields.

       The following options are supported:

       <b>exchange</b>
           Sets the exchange to use on the broker. RabbitMQ has several predefined  exchanges:  "amq.direct"  is
           the  default  exchange,  where  the  publisher  and  subscriber  must  have  a  matching routing_key;
           "amq.fanout" is the same as a broadcast operation (i.e. the data is forwarded to all  queues  on  the
           fanout  exchange  independent  of  the  routing_key); and "amq.topic" is similar to "amq.direct", but
           allows for more complex pattern matching (refer to the RabbitMQ documentation).

       <b>routing_key</b>
           Sets the routing key. The default value is "amqp". The routing key is used on  the  "amq.direct"  and
           "amq.topic" exchanges to decide whether packets are written to the queue of a subscriber.

       <b>pkt_size</b>
           Maximum  size of each packet sent/received to the broker. Default is 131072.  Minimum is 4096 and max
           is any large value (representable by an int). When receiving packets, this sets  an  internal  buffer
           size  in  FFmpeg.  It  should  be  equal  to or greater than the size of the published packets to the
           broker. Otherwise the received message may be truncated causing decoding errors.

       <b>connection_timeout</b>
           The timeout in seconds during the initial connection to the broker. The default value is  rw_timeout,
           or 5 seconds if rw_timeout is not set.

       <b>delivery_mode</b> <u>mode</u>
           Sets the delivery mode of each message sent to broker.  The following values are accepted:

           <b>persistent</b>
               Delivery mode set to "persistent" (2). This is the default value.  Messages may be written to the
               broker's disk depending on its setup.

           <b>non-persistent</b>
               Delivery  mode  set  to  "non-persistent"  (1).  Messages will stay in broker's memory unless the
               broker is under memory pressure.

   <b>async</b>
       Asynchronous data filling wrapper for input stream.

       Fill data in a background thread, to decouple I/O operation from demux thread.

               async:&lt;URL&gt;
               async:<a href="http://host/resource">http://host/resource</a>
               async:cache:<a href="http://host/resource">http://host/resource</a>

   <b>bluray</b>
       Read BluRay playlist.

       The accepted options are:

       <b>angle</b>
           BluRay angle

       <b>chapter</b>
           Start chapter (1...N)

       <b>playlist</b>
           Playlist to read (BDMV/PLAYLIST/?????.mpls)

       Examples:

       Read longest playlist from BluRay mounted to /mnt/bluray:

               bluray:/mnt/bluray

       Read angle 2 of playlist 4 from BluRay mounted to /mnt/bluray, start from chapter 2:

               -playlist 4 -angle 2 -chapter 2 bluray:/mnt/bluray

   <b>cache</b>
       Caching wrapper for input stream.

       Cache the input stream to temporary file. It brings seeking capability to live streams.

       The accepted options are:

       <b>read_ahead_limit</b>
           Amount in bytes that may be read ahead when seeking isn't supported. Range is -1 to INT_MAX.  -1  for
           unlimited. Default is 65536.

       URL Syntax is

               cache:&lt;URL&gt;

   <b>concat</b>
       Physical concatenation protocol.

       Read and seek from many resources in sequence as if they were a unique resource.

       A URL accepted by this protocol has the syntax:

               concat:&lt;URL1&gt;|&lt;URL2&gt;|...|&lt;URLN&gt;

       where <u>URL1</u>, <u>URL2</u>, ..., <u>URLN</u> are the urls of the resource to be concatenated, each one possibly specifying
       a distinct protocol.

       For  example  to  read  a  sequence  of  files  <u>split1.mpeg</u>, <u>split2.mpeg</u>, <u>split3.mpeg</u> with <b>ffplay</b> use the
       command:

               ffplay concat:split1.mpeg\|split2.mpeg\|split3.mpeg

       Note that you may need to escape the character "|" which is special for many shells.

   <b>concatf</b>
       Physical concatenation protocol using a line break delimited list of resources.

       Read and seek from many resources in sequence as if they were a unique resource.

       A URL accepted by this protocol has the syntax:

               concatf:&lt;URL&gt;

       where <u>URL</u> is the url containing a line break delimited list of resources to  be  concatenated,  each  one
       possibly  specifying  a  distinct  protocol.  Special characters must be escaped with backslash or single
       quotes. See <b>the</b> <b>"Quoting</b> <b>and</b> <b>escaping"</b> <b>section</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b><a href="../man1/ffmpeg-utils.1.html">ffmpeg-utils</a>(1)</b> <b>manual</b>.

       For example to read a sequence of files <u>split1.mpeg</u>, <u>split2.mpeg</u>, <u>split3.mpeg</u> listed  in  separate  lines
       within a file <u>split.txt</u> with <b>ffplay</b> use the command:

               ffplay concatf:split.txt

       Where <u>split.txt</u> contains the lines:

               split1.mpeg
               split2.mpeg
               split3.mpeg

   <b>crypto</b>
       AES-encrypted stream reading protocol.

       The accepted options are:

       <b>key</b> Set the AES decryption key binary block from given hexadecimal representation.

       <b>iv</b>  Set the AES decryption initialization vector binary block from given hexadecimal representation.

       Accepted URL formats:

               crypto:&lt;URL&gt;
               crypto+&lt;URL&gt;

   <b>data</b>
       Data in-line in the URI. See &lt;<b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_URI_scheme">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_URI_scheme</a></b>&gt;.

       For example, to convert a GIF file given inline with <b>ffmpeg</b>:

               ffmpeg -i "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhCAAIAMIEAAAAAAAA//8AAP//AP///////////////ywAAAAACAAIAAADF0gEDLojDgdGiJdJqUX02iB4E8Q9jUMkADs=" smiley.png

   <b>fd</b>
       File descriptor access protocol.

       The accepted syntax is:

               fd: -fd &lt;file_descriptor&gt;

       If  <b>fd</b>  is  not  specified,  by  default  the  stdout file descriptor will be used for writing, stdin for
       reading. Unlike the pipe protocol, fd protocol has seek support if it corresponding to a regular file. fd
       protocol doesn't support pass file descriptor via URL for security.

       This protocol accepts the following options:

       <b>blocksize</b>
           Set I/O operation maximum block size, in bytes. Default value is  "INT_MAX",  which  results  in  not
           limiting  the  requested  block  size.   Setting  this value reasonably low improves user termination
           request reaction time, which is valuable if data transmission is slow.

       <b>fd</b>  Set file descriptor.

   <b>file</b>
       File access protocol.

       Read from or write to a file.

       A file URL can have the form:

               file:&lt;filename&gt;

       where <u>filename</u> is the path of the file to read.

       An URL that does not have a protocol prefix will be assumed to be a file URL. Depending on the build,  an
       URL  that  looks  like a Windows path with the drive letter at the beginning will also be assumed to be a
       file URL (usually not the case in builds for unix-like systems).

       For example to read from a file <u>input.mpeg</u> with <b>ffmpeg</b> use the command:

               ffmpeg -i file:input.mpeg output.mpeg

       This protocol accepts the following options:

       <b>truncate</b>
           Truncate existing files on write, if set to 1. A value of 0 prevents truncating. Default value is 1.

       <b>blocksize</b>
           Set I/O operation maximum block size, in bytes. Default value is  "INT_MAX",  which  results  in  not
           limiting  the  requested  block  size.   Setting  this value reasonably low improves user termination
           request reaction time, which is valuable for files on slow medium.

       <b>follow</b>
           If set to 1, the protocol will retry reading at the end of the  file,  allowing  reading  files  that
           still  are  being  written.  In  order  for  this to terminate, you either need to use the rw_timeout
           option, or use the interrupt callback (for API users).

       <b>seekable</b>
           Controls if seekability is advertised on the file. 0 means non-seekable, -1 means auto (seekable  for
           normal files, non-seekable for named pipes).

           Many  demuxers handle seekable and non-seekable resources differently, overriding this might speed up
           opening certain files at the cost of losing some features (e.g. accurate seeking).

   <b>ftp</b>
       FTP (File Transfer Protocol).

       Read from or write to remote resources using FTP protocol.

       Following syntax is required.

               ftp://[user[:password]@]server[:port]/path/to/remote/resource.mpeg

       This protocol accepts the following options.

       <b>timeout</b>
           Set timeout in microseconds of socket I/O operations used by the underlying low level  operation.  By
           default it is set to -1, which means that the timeout is not specified.

       <b>ftp-user</b>
           Set a user to be used for authenticating to the FTP server. This is overridden by the user in the FTP
           URL.

       <b>ftp-password</b>
           Set a password to be used for authenticating to the FTP server. This is overridden by the password in
           the FTP URL, or by <b>ftp-anonymous-password</b> if no user is set.

       <b>ftp-anonymous-password</b>
           Password used when login as anonymous user. Typically an e-mail address should be used.

       <b>ftp-write-seekable</b>
           Control  seekability  of  connection  during  encoding.  If  set  to 1 the resource is supposed to be
           seekable, if set to 0 it is assumed not to be seekable. Default value is 0.

       NOTE: Protocol can be used as output, but it is recommended to not do it, unless special  care  is  taken
       (tests,  customized server configuration etc.). Different FTP servers behave in different way during seek
       operation. ff* tools may produce incomplete content due to server limitations.

   <b>gopher</b>
       Gopher protocol.

   <b>gophers</b>
       Gophers protocol.

       The Gopher protocol with TLS encapsulation.

   <b>hls</b>
       Read Apple HTTP Live Streaming compliant segmented stream as a uniform one. The M3U8 playlists describing
       the segments can be remote HTTP resources or local files, accessed using the standard file protocol.  The
       nested protocol is declared by specifying "+<u>proto</u>" after the hls URI scheme name, where <u>proto</u>  is  either
       "file" or "http".

               hls+<a href="http://host/path/to/remote/resource.m3u8">http://host/path/to/remote/resource.m3u8</a>
               hls+file://path/to/local/resource.m3u8

       Using  this protocol is discouraged - the hls demuxer should work just as well (if not, please report the
       issues) and is more complete.  To use the hls demuxer instead, simply use the direct  URLs  to  the  m3u8
       files.

   <b>http</b>
       HTTP (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol).

       This protocol accepts the following options:

       <b>seekable</b>
           Control  seekability  of connection. If set to 1 the resource is supposed to be seekable, if set to 0
           it is assumed not to be seekable, if set to -1 it will try to autodetect if it is  seekable.  Default
           value is -1.

       <b>chunked_post</b>
           If set to 1 use chunked Transfer-Encoding for posts, default is 1.

       <b>http_proxy</b>
           set HTTP proxy to tunnel through e.g. <a href="http://example.com">http://example.com</a>:1234

       <b>headers</b>
           Set  custom  HTTP headers, can override built in default headers. The value must be a string encoding
           the headers.

       <b>content_type</b>
           Set a specific content type for the POST messages or for listen mode.

       <b>user_agent</b>
           Override the User-Agent header. If not specified the  protocol  will  use  a  string  describing  the
           libavformat build. ("Lavf/&lt;version&gt;")

       <b>referer</b>
           Set the Referer header. Include 'Referer: URL' header in HTTP request.

       <b>multiple_requests</b>
           Use persistent connections if set to 1, default is 0.

       <b>post_data</b>
           Set custom HTTP post data.

       <b>mime_type</b>
           Export the MIME type.

       <b>http_version</b>
           Exports the HTTP response version number. Usually "1.0" or "1.1".

       <b>cookies</b>
           Set  the cookies to be sent in future requests. The format of each cookie is the same as the value of
           a Set-Cookie HTTP response field. Multiple cookies can be delimited by a newline character.

       <b>icy</b> If set to 1 request ICY (SHOUTcast) metadata from the  server.  If  the  server  supports  this,  the
           metadata   has   to  be  retrieved  by  the  application  by  reading  the  <b>icy_metadata_headers</b>  and
           <b>icy_metadata_packet</b> options.  The default is 1.

       <b>icy_metadata_headers</b>
           If the server supports ICY metadata, this contains the ICY-specific HTTP reply headers, separated  by
           newline characters.

       <b>icy_metadata_packet</b>
           If  the server supports ICY metadata, and <b>icy</b> was set to 1, this contains the last non-empty metadata
           packet sent by the server. It should be polled in regular intervals  by  applications  interested  in
           mid-stream metadata updates.

       <b>metadata</b>
           Set  an  exported dictionary containing Icecast metadata from the bitstream, if present.  Only useful
           with the C API.

       <b>auth_type</b>
           Set HTTP authentication type. No  option  for  Digest,  since  this  method  requires  getting  nonce
           parameters from the server first and can't be used straight away like Basic.

           <b>none</b>
               Choose the HTTP authentication type automatically. This is the default.

           <b>basic</b>
               Choose the HTTP basic authentication.

               Basic authentication sends a Base64-encoded string that contains a user name and password for the
               client.  Base64 is not a form of encryption and should be considered the same as sending the user
               name and password in clear text (Base64 is a reversible encoding).  If a  resource  needs  to  be
               protected,  strongly  consider  using  an  authentication scheme other than basic authentication.
               HTTPS/TLS  should  be  used  with  basic  authentication.   Without  these  additional   security
               enhancements,  basic  authentication  should  not  be  used  to  protect  sensitive  or  valuable
               information.

       <b>send_expect_100</b>
           Send an Expect: 100-continue header for POST. If set to 1 it will send, if set to 0 it won't, if  set
           to -1 it will try to send if it is applicable. Default value is -1.

       <b>location</b>
           An exported dictionary containing the content location. Only useful with the C API.

       <b>offset</b>
           Set initial byte offset.

       <b>end_offset</b>
           Try to limit the request to bytes preceding this offset.

       <b>method</b>
           When used as a client option it sets the HTTP method for the request.

           When used as a server option it sets the HTTP method that is going to be expected from the client(s).
           If  the  expected  and  the  received HTTP method do not match the client will be given a Bad Request
           response.  When unset the HTTP method is not checked for now. This will be replaced by  autodetection
           in the future.

       <b>reconnect</b>
           Reconnect automatically when disconnected before EOF is hit.

       <b>reconnect_at_eof</b>
           If  set  then eof is treated like an error and causes reconnection, this is useful for live / endless
           streams.

       <b>reconnect_on_network_error</b>
           Reconnect automatically in case of TCP/TLS errors during connect.

       <b>reconnect_on_http_error</b>
           A comma separated list of HTTP status codes to reconnect on. The list  can  include  specific  status
           codes (e.g. '503') or the strings '4xx' / '5xx'.

       <b>reconnect_streamed</b>
           If set then even streamed/non seekable streams will be reconnected on errors.

       <b>reconnect_delay_max</b>
           Set the maximum delay in seconds after which to give up reconnecting.

       <b>reconnect_max_retries</b>
           Set the maximum number of times to retry a connection. Default unset.

       <b>reconnect_delay_total_max</b>
           Set the maximum total delay in seconds after which to give up reconnecting.

       <b>respect_retry_after</b>
           If  enabled,  and  a  Retry-After  header  is  encountered,  its requested reconnection delay will be
           honored, rather than using exponential backoff. Useful for 429 and 503 errors. Default enabled.

       <b>listen</b>
           If set to 1 enables experimental HTTP server. This can be used to send data when used  as  an  output
           option,  or read data from a client with HTTP POST when used as an input option.  If set to 2 enables
           experimental multi-client HTTP server. This is not yet implemented in ffmpeg.c and thus must  not  be
           used as a command line option.

                   # Server side (sending):
                   ffmpeg -i somefile.ogg -c copy -listen 1 -f ogg http://&lt;server&gt;:&lt;port&gt;

                   # Client side (receiving):
                   ffmpeg -i http://&lt;server&gt;:&lt;port&gt; -c copy somefile.ogg

                   # Client can also be done with wget:
                   wget http://&lt;server&gt;:&lt;port&gt; -O somefile.ogg

                   # Server side (receiving):
                   ffmpeg -listen 1 -i http://&lt;server&gt;:&lt;port&gt; -c copy somefile.ogg

                   # Client side (sending):
                   ffmpeg -i somefile.ogg -chunked_post 0 -c copy -f ogg http://&lt;server&gt;:&lt;port&gt;

                   # Client can also be done with wget:
                   wget --post-file=somefile.ogg http://&lt;server&gt;:&lt;port&gt;

       <b>resource</b>
           The resource requested by a client, when the experimental HTTP server is in use.

       <b>reply_code</b>
           The HTTP code returned to the client, when the experimental HTTP server is in use.

       <b>short_seek_size</b>
           Set  the  threshold,  in  bytes,  for  when  a  readahead should be prefered over a seek and new HTTP
           request. This is useful, for example, to make sure the same connection  is  used  for  reading  large
           video packets with small audio packets in between.

       <u>HTTP</u> <u>Cookies</u>

       Some HTTP requests will be denied unless cookie values are passed in with the request. The <b>cookies</b> option
       allows  these  cookies  to be specified. At the very least, each cookie must specify a value along with a
       path and domain.  HTTP requests that match both the domain and path will automatically include the cookie
       value in the HTTP Cookie header field. Multiple cookies can be delimited by a newline.

       The required syntax to play a stream specifying a cookie is:

               ffplay -cookies "nlqptid=nltid=tsn; path=/; domain=somedomain.com;" <a href="http://somedomain.com/somestream.m3u8">http://somedomain.com/somestream.m3u8</a>

   <b>Icecast</b>
       Icecast protocol (stream to Icecast servers)

       This protocol accepts the following options:

       <b>ice_genre</b>
           Set the stream genre.

       <b>ice_name</b>
           Set the stream name.

       <b>ice_description</b>
           Set the stream description.

       <b>ice_url</b>
           Set the stream website URL.

       <b>ice_public</b>
           Set if the stream should be public.  The default is 0 (not public).

       <b>user_agent</b>
           Override the User-Agent header. If not specified a string of the form "Lavf/&lt;version&gt;" will be used.

       <b>password</b>
           Set the Icecast mountpoint password.

       <b>content_type</b>
           Set the stream content type. This must be set if it is different from audio/mpeg.

       <b>legacy_icecast</b>
           This enables support for Icecast versions &lt; 2.4.0, that do not support the HTTP PUT  method  but  the
           SOURCE method.

       <b>tls</b> Establish a TLS (HTTPS) connection to Icecast.

               icecast://[&lt;username&gt;[:&lt;password&gt;]@]&lt;server&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/&lt;mountpoint&gt;

   <b>ipfs</b>
       InterPlanetary  File  System  (IPFS)  protocol  support.  One can access files stored on the IPFS network
       through so-called gateways. These are http(s) endpoints.  This protocol wraps the IPFS  native  protocols
       (ipfs://  and  ipns://)  to  be  sent to such a gateway. Users can (and should) host their own node which
       means this protocol will use one's local gateway to access files on the IPFS network.

       This protocol accepts the following options:

       <b>gateway</b>
           Defines the gateway to use. When not set, the protocol will first try locating the local  gateway  by
           looking at $IPFS_GATEWAY, $IPFS_PATH and "$HOME/.ipfs/", in that order.

       One can use this protocol in 2 ways. Using IPFS:

               ffplay ipfs://&lt;hash&gt;

       Or the IPNS protocol (IPNS is mutable IPFS):

               ffplay ipns://&lt;hash&gt;

   <b>mmst</b>
       MMS (Microsoft Media Server) protocol over TCP.

   <b>mmsh</b>
       MMS (Microsoft Media Server) protocol over HTTP.

       The required syntax is:

               mmsh://&lt;server&gt;[:&lt;port&gt;][/&lt;app&gt;][/&lt;playpath&gt;]

   <b>md5</b>
       MD5 output protocol.

       Computes  the  MD5  hash  of the data to be written, and on close writes this to the designated output or
       stdout if none is specified. It can be used to test muxers without writing an actual file.

       Some examples follow.

               # Write the MD5 hash of the encoded AVI file to the file output.avi.md5.
               ffmpeg -i input.flv -f avi -y md5:output.avi.md5

               # Write the MD5 hash of the encoded AVI file to stdout.
               ffmpeg -i input.flv -f avi -y md5:

       Note that some formats (typically MOV) require the output protocol to be seekable, so they will fail with
       the MD5 output protocol.

   <b>pipe</b>
       UNIX pipe access protocol.

       Read and write from UNIX pipes.

       The accepted syntax is:

               pipe:[&lt;number&gt;]

       If <b>fd</b> isn't specified, <u>number</u> is the number corresponding to the file descriptor of the pipe (e.g. 0  for
       stdin,  1  for  stdout, 2 for stderr).  If <u>number</u> is not specified, by default the stdout file descriptor
       will be used for writing, stdin for reading.

       For example to read from stdin with <b>ffmpeg</b>:

               cat test.wav | ffmpeg -i pipe:0
               # ...this is the same as...
               cat test.wav | ffmpeg -i pipe:

       For writing to stdout with <b>ffmpeg</b>:

               ffmpeg -i test.wav -f avi pipe:1 | cat &gt; test.avi
               # ...this is the same as...
               ffmpeg -i test.wav -f avi pipe: | cat &gt; test.avi

       This protocol accepts the following options:

       <b>blocksize</b>
           Set I/O operation maximum block size, in bytes. Default value is  "INT_MAX",  which  results  in  not
           limiting  the  requested  block  size.   Setting  this value reasonably low improves user termination
           request reaction time, which is valuable if data transmission is slow.

       <b>fd</b>  Set file descriptor.

       Note that some formats (typically MOV), require the output protocol to be seekable,  so  they  will  fail
       with the pipe output protocol.

   <b>prompeg</b>
       Pro-MPEG Code of Practice #3 Release 2 FEC protocol.

       The  Pro-MPEG  CoP#3  FEC  is  a  2D parity-check forward error correction mechanism for MPEG-2 Transport
       Streams sent over RTP.

       This protocol must be used in conjunction with the "rtp_mpegts" muxer and the "rtp" protocol.

       The required syntax is:

               -f rtp_mpegts -fec prompeg=&lt;option&gt;=&lt;val&gt;... rtp://&lt;hostname&gt;:&lt;port&gt;

       The destination UDP ports are "port + 2" for the column FEC stream and "port + 4" for the row FEC stream.

       This protocol accepts the following options:

       <b>l=</b><u>n</u> The number of columns (4-20, LxD &lt;= 100)

       <b>d=</b><u>n</u> The number of rows (4-20, LxD &lt;= 100)

       Example usage:

               -f rtp_mpegts -fec prompeg=l=8:d=4 rtp://&lt;hostname&gt;:&lt;port&gt;

           <b>advanced</b>
       <b>buffer_size</b>
           Set internal RIST buffer size in milliseconds for retransmission of data.  Default value is  0  which
           means the librist default (1 sec). Maximum value is 30 seconds.

       <b>fifo_size</b>
           Size  of  the librist receiver output fifo in number of packets. This must be a power of 2.  Defaults

       <b>overrun_nonfatal=</b><u>1|0</u>
           Survive in case of librist fifo buffer overrun. Default value is 0.

       <b>pkt_size</b>
           Set maximum packet size for sending data. 1316 by default.

       <b>log_level</b>
           Set loglevel for RIST logging messages. You only need to set this if you explicitly  want  to  enable
           debug level messages or packet loss simulation, otherwise the regular loglevel is respected.

       <b>secret</b>
           Set override of encryption secret, by default is unset.

       <b>encryption</b>
           Set encryption type, by default is disabled.  Acceptable values are 128 and 256.

   <b>rtmp</b>
       Real-Time Messaging Protocol.

       The Real-Time Messaging Protocol (RTMP) is used for streaming multimedia content across a TCP/IP network.

           is  installed  on  the  RTMP server (e.g. <u>/ondemand/</u>, <u>/flash/live/</u>, etc.). You can override the value
           parsed from the URI through the "rtmp_app" option, too.

       <b>playpath</b>
           It is the path or name of the resource to play with reference to the application  specified  in  <u>app</u>,
           may be prefixed by "mp4:". You can override the value parsed from the URI through the "rtmp_playpath"
           option, too.

           Act as a server, listening for an incoming connection.

       <b>timeout</b>
           Maximum time to wait for the incoming connection. Implies listen.

       Additionally, the following parameters can be set via command line options (or in code via "AVOption"s):

       <b>rtmp_app</b>
           Name  of  application to connect on the RTMP server. This option overrides the parameter specified in
           the URI.

           NN:code:1.23  NS:flag:ok O:0".  Each value is prefixed by a single character denoting the type, B for
           Boolean, N for number, S for string, O for object, or Z for null, followed by a colon.  For  Booleans
           the  data  must be either 0 or 1 for FALSE or TRUE, respectively.  Likewise for Objects the data must
           be 0 or 1 to end or begin an object,  respectively.  Data  items  in  subobjects  may  be  named,  by
           prefixing  the  type  with  'N'  and  specifying the name before the value (i.e. "NB:myFlag:1"). This
           option may be used multiple times to construct arbitrary AMF sequences.

       <b>rtmp_enhanced_codecs</b>
           Specify the list of codecs the client advertises to support in an enhanced RTMP stream.  This  option
           should  be  set to a comma separated list of fourcc values, like "hvc1,av01,vp09" for multiple codecs
           or "hvc1" for only one codec. The specified list will be presented in the  "fourCcLive"  property  of
           the Connect Command Message.

       <b>rtmp_flashver</b>
           Version  of  the  Flash  plugin  used  to  run  the  SWF  player. The default is LNX 9,0,124,2. (When

           Number of packets flushed in the same request (RTMPT only). The default is 10.

       <b>rtmp_live</b>
           Specify that the media is a live stream. No resuming or seeking in  live  streams  is  possible.  The
           default  value  is "any", which means the subscriber first tries to play the live stream specified in
           the playpath. If a live stream of that name is not found, it plays the  recorded  stream.  The  other
           possible values are "live" and "recorded".

       <b>rtmp_pageurl</b>
           URL of the web page in which the media was embedded. By default no value will be sent.

       <b>rtmp_playpath</b>

       <b>tcp_nodelay=</b><u>1|0</u>
           Set TCP_NODELAY to disable Nagle's algorithm. Default value is 0.

           <u>Remark:</u>  <u>Writing</u>  <u>to</u>  <u>the</u>  <u>socket</u> <u>is</u> <u>currently</u> <u>not</u> <u>optimized</u> <u>to</u> <u>minimize</u> <u>system</u> <u>calls</u> <u>and</u> <u>reduces</u> <u>the</u>
           <u>efficiency</u> <u>/</u> <u>effect</u> <u>of</u> <u>TCP_NODELAY.</u>

       For example to read with <b>ffplay</b> a multimedia resource named "sample" from the application "vod"  from  an
       RTMP server "myserver":

   <b>librtmp</b> <b>rtmp,</b> <b>rtmpe,</b> <b>rtmps,</b> <b>rtmpt,</b> <b>rtmpte</b>
       Real-Time Messaging Protocol and its variants supported through librtmp.

       Requires  the  presence  of  the librtmp headers and library during configuration. You need to explicitly
       configure the build with "--enable-librtmp". If enabled this will replace the native RTMP protocol.

       This protocol provides most client functions and a few server functions  needed  to  support  RTMP,  RTMP
       tunneled  in  HTTP  (RTMPT),  encrypted  RTMP (RTMPE), RTMP over SSL/TLS (RTMPS) and tunneled variants of
       these encrypted types (RTMPTE, RTMPTS).

       The required syntax is:

               &lt;rtmp_proto&gt;://&lt;server&gt;[:&lt;port&gt;][/&lt;app&gt;][/&lt;playpath&gt;] &lt;options&gt;

       where  <u>rtmp_proto</u>  is  one  of  the  strings  "rtmp",  "rtmpt",  "rtmpe",  "rtmps",  "rtmpte",   "rtmpts"
       corresponding to each RTMP variant, and <u>server</u>, <u>port</u>, <u>app</u> and <u>playpath</u> have the same meaning as specified
       for the RTMP native protocol.  <u>options</u> contains a list of space-separated options of the form <u>key</u>=<u>val</u>.

       See the librtmp manual page (man 3 librtmp) for more information.

       For example, to stream a file in real-time to an RTMP server using <b>ffmpeg</b>:

               ffmpeg -re -i myfile -f flv rtmp://myserver/live/mystream

       To play the same stream using <b>ffplay</b>:

               ffplay "rtmp://myserver/live/mystream live=1"

   <b>rtp</b>
       Real-time Transport Protocol.

       The required syntax for an RTP URL is: rtp://<u>hostname</u>[:<u>port</u>][?<u>option</u>=<u>val</u>...]

       <u>port</u> specifies the RTP port to use.

       The following URL options are supported:

       <b>ttl=</b><u>n</u>
           Set the TTL (Time-To-Live) value (for multicast only).

       <b>rtcpport=</b><u>n</u>
           Set the remote RTCP port to <u>n</u>.

       <b>localrtpport=</b><u>n</u>

       <b>buffer_size=</b><u>size</u>
           Set the maximum UDP socket buffer size in bytes.

       <b>connect=0|1</b>
           Do a connect() on the UDP socket (if set to 1) or not (if set to 0).

       <b>sources=</b><u>ip</u><b>[,</b><u>ip</u><b>]</b>
           List allowed source IP addresses.

       <b>block=</b><u>ip</u><b>[,</b><u>ip</u><b>]</b>
           List disallowed (blocked) source IP addresses.

       <b>write_to_source=0|1</b>
           Send packets to the source address of the latest received packet (if set to 1) or to a default remote
           address (if set to 0).

           Set the local RTP port to <u>n</u>.

       <b>localaddr=</b><u>addr</u>
           Local IP address of a network interface used for sending packets or joining multicast groups.

       <b>timeout=</b><u>n</u>
           Set timeout (in microseconds) of socket I/O operations to <u>n</u>.

           This is a deprecated option. Instead, <b>localrtpport</b> should be used.

       Important notes:

       1.  If <b>rtcpport</b> is not set the RTCP port will be set to the RTP port value plus 1.

       2.  If <b>localrtpport</b> (the local RTP port) is not set any available port will be used for the local RTP and
           RTCP ports.

       3.  If <b>localrtcpport</b> (the local RTCP port) is not set it will be set to the local RTP port value plus 1.

   <b>rtsp</b>
       Real-Time Streaming Protocol.

       RTSP  is  not  technically  a  protocol  handler  in  libavformat, it is a demuxer and muxer. The demuxer
       supports both normal RTSP (with data transferred over RTP; this is used by e.g. Apple and Microsoft)  and
       Real-RTSP (with data transferred over RDT).

       The  muxer  can  be used to send a stream using RTSP ANNOUNCE to a server supporting it (currently Darwin
       Streaming Server and Mischa Spiegelmock's &lt;<b>https://github.com/revmischa/rtsp-server</b>&gt;).

       The required syntax for a RTSP url is:

               rtsp://&lt;hostname&gt;[:&lt;port&gt;]/&lt;path&gt;

       Options can  be  set  on  the  <b>ffmpeg</b>/<b>ffplay</b>  command  line,  or  set  in  code  via  "AVOption"s  or  in
       "avformat_open_input".

       <u>Muxer</u>

       The following options are supported.

       <b>rtsp_transport</b>
           Set RTSP transport protocols.

           It accepts the following values:

           <b>udp</b> Use UDP as lower transport protocol.

           <b>tcp</b> Use TCP (interleaving within the RTSP control channel) as lower transport protocol.

           Default value is <b>0</b>.

       <b>rtsp_flags</b>
           Set RTSP flags.

           The following values are accepted:

           <b>latm</b>
               Use MP4A-LATM packetization instead of MPEG4-GENERIC for AAC.

           <b>rfc2190</b>
               Use RFC 2190 packetization instead of RFC 4629 for H.263.

           <b>skip_rtcp</b>
               Don't send RTCP sender reports.

           <b>h264_mode0</b>
               Use mode 0 for H.264 in RTP.

           <b>send_bye</b>
               Send RTCP BYE packets when finishing.

           Default value is <b>0</b>.

       <b>max_port</b>
           Set maximum local UDP port. Default value is 65000.

       <b>buffer_size</b>
           Set the maximum socket buffer size in bytes.

       <b>pkt_size</b>
           Set max send packet size (in bytes). Default value is 1472.

       <u>Demuxer</u>

       The following options are supported.

       <b>initial_pause</b>
           Do not start playing the stream immediately if set to 1. Default value is 0.

       <b>rtsp_transport</b>
           Set RTSP transport protocols.

           It accepts the following values:

           <b>udp</b> Use UDP as lower transport protocol.

           <b>tcp</b> Use TCP (interleaving within the RTSP control channel) as lower transport protocol.

           <b>udp_multicast</b>
               Use UDP multicast as lower transport protocol.

           <b>http</b>
               Use HTTP tunneling as lower transport protocol, which is useful for passing proxies.

           <b>https</b>
               Use  HTTPs  tunneling as lower transport protocol, which is useful for passing proxies and widely
               used for security consideration.

           Multiple lower transport protocols may be specified, in that case they are tried one at  a  time  (if
           the  setup  of  one  fails,  the next one is tried).  For the muxer, only the <b>tcp</b> and <b>udp</b> options are
           supported.

       <b>rtsp_flags</b>
           Set RTSP flags.

           The following values are accepted:

           <b>filter_src</b>
               Accept packets only from negotiated peer address and port.

           <b>listen</b>
               Act as a server, listening for an incoming connection.

           <b>prefer_tcp</b>
               Try TCP for RTP transport first, if TCP is available as RTSP RTP transport.

           <b>satip_raw</b>
               Export raw MPEG-TS stream instead of demuxing. The flag will simply write  out  the  raw  stream,
               with the original PAT/PMT/PIDs intact.

           Default value is <b>none</b>.

       <b>allowed_media_types</b>
           Set media types to accept from the server.

           The following flags are accepted:

           <b>video</b>
           <b>audio</b>
           <b>data</b>
           <b>subtitle</b>

           By default it accepts all media types.

       <b>min_port</b>
           Set minimum local UDP port. Default value is 5000.

       <b>max_port</b>
           Set maximum local UDP port. Default value is 65000.

       <b>listen_timeout</b>
           Set  maximum timeout (in seconds) to establish an initial connection. Setting <b>listen_timeout</b> &gt; 0 sets
           <b>rtsp_flags</b> to <b>listen</b>. Default is -1 which means an infinite timeout when <b>listen</b> mode is set.

       <b>reorder_queue_size</b>
           Set number of packets to buffer for handling of reordered packets.

       <b>timeout</b>
           Set socket TCP I/O timeout in microseconds.

       <b>user_agent</b>
           Override User-Agent header. If not specified, it defaults to the libavformat identifier string.

       <b>buffer_size</b>
           Set the maximum socket buffer size in bytes.

       When receiving data over UDP, the demuxer tries to reorder received packets (since they may arrive out of
       order, or packets may get lost totally). This can be disabled by setting the maximum  demuxing  delay  to
       zero (via the "max_delay" field of AVFormatContext).

       When  watching  multi-bitrate  Real-RTSP  streams  with <b>ffplay</b>, the streams to display can be chosen with
       "-vst" <u>n</u> and "-ast" <u>n</u> for video and audio respectively, and can be switched on the fly  by  pressing  "v"
       and "a".

       <u>Examples</u>

       The following examples all make use of the <b>ffplay</b> and <b>ffmpeg</b> tools.

       •   Watch a stream over UDP, with a max reordering delay of 0.5 seconds:

                   ffplay -max_delay 500000 -rtsp_transport udp rtsp://server/video.mp4

       •   Watch a stream tunneled over HTTP:

                   ffplay -rtsp_transport http rtsp://server/video.mp4

       •   Send a stream in realtime to a RTSP server, for others to watch:

                   ffmpeg -re -i &lt;input&gt; -f rtsp -muxdelay 0.1 rtsp://server/live.sdp

       •   Receive a stream in realtime:

                   ffmpeg -rtsp_flags listen -i rtsp://ownaddress/live.sdp &lt;output&gt;

   <b>sap</b>
       Session  Announcement  Protocol (RFC 2974). This is not technically a protocol handler in libavformat, it
       is a muxer and demuxer.  It is used for signalling of RTP streams, by announcing the SDP for the  streams
       regularly on a separate port.

       <u>Muxer</u>

       The syntax for a SAP url given to the muxer is:

               sap://&lt;destination&gt;[:&lt;port&gt;][?&lt;options&gt;]

       The  RTP  packets are sent to <u>destination</u> on port <u>port</u>, or to port 5004 if no port is specified.  <u>options</u>
       is a "&amp;"-separated list. The following options are supported:

       <b>announce_addr=</b><u>address</u>
           Specify the destination IP address for sending the announcements to.  If omitted,  the  announcements
           are  sent  to  the commonly used SAP announcement multicast address 224.2.127.254 (sap.mcast.net), or
           ff0e::2:7ffe if <u>destination</u> is an IPv6 address.

       <b>announce_port=</b><u>port</u>
           Specify the port to send the announcements on, defaults to 9875 if not specified.

       <b>ttl=</b><u>ttl</u>
           Specify the time to live value for the announcements and RTP packets, defaults to 255.

       <b>same_port=</b><u>0|1</u>
           If set to 1, send all RTP streams on the same port pair. If zero (the default), all streams are  sent
           on unique ports, with each stream on a port 2 numbers higher than the previous.  VLC/Live555 requires
           this  to  be  set to 1, to be able to receive the stream.  The RTP stack in libavformat for receiving
           requires all streams to be sent on unique ports.

       Example command lines follow.

       To broadcast a stream on the local subnet, for watching in VLC:

               ffmpeg -re -i &lt;input&gt; -f sap sap://224.0.0.255?same_port=1

       Similarly, for watching in <b>ffplay</b>:

               ffmpeg -re -i &lt;input&gt; -f sap sap://224.0.0.255

       And for watching in <b>ffplay</b>, over IPv6:

               ffmpeg -re -i &lt;input&gt; -f sap sap://[ff0e::1:2:3:4]

       <u>Demuxer</u>

       The syntax for a SAP url given to the demuxer is:

               sap://[&lt;address&gt;][:&lt;port&gt;]

       <u>address</u> is the multicast address to listen for announcements on, if omitted,  the  default  224.2.127.254
       (sap.mcast.net) is used. <u>port</u> is the port that is listened on, 9875 if omitted.

       The  demuxers listens for announcements on the given address and port.  Once an announcement is received,
       it tries to receive that particular stream.

       Example command lines follow.

       To play back the first stream announced on the normal SAP multicast address:

               ffplay sap://

       To play back the first stream announced on one the default IPv6 SAP multicast address:

               ffplay sap://[ff0e::2:7ffe]

   <b>sctp</b>
       Stream Control Transmission Protocol.

       The accepted URL syntax is:

               sctp://&lt;host&gt;:&lt;port&gt;[?&lt;options&gt;]

       The protocol accepts the following options:

       <b>listen</b>
           If set to any value, listen for an incoming connection. Outgoing connection is done by default.

       <b>max_streams</b>
           Set the maximum number of streams. By default no limit is set.

   <b>srt</b>
       Haivision Secure Reliable Transport Protocol via libsrt.

       The supported syntax for a SRT URL is:

               srt://&lt;hostname&gt;:&lt;port&gt;[?&lt;options&gt;]

       <u>options</u> contains a list of &amp;-separated options of the form <u>key</u>=<u>val</u>.

       or

               &lt;options&gt; srt://&lt;hostname&gt;:&lt;port&gt;

       <u>options</u> contains a list of '-<u>key</u> <u>val</u>' options.

       This protocol accepts the following options.

       <b>connect_timeout=</b><u>milliseconds</u>
           Connection timeout; SRT cannot connect for RTT &gt; 1500 msec (2 handshake exchanges) with  the  default
           connect  timeout of 3 seconds. This option applies to the caller and rendezvous connection modes. The
           connect timeout is 10 times the value set for the rendezvous mode (which can be used as a  workaround
           for this connection problem with earlier versions).

       <b>ffs=</b><u>bytes</u>
           Flight Flag Size (Window Size), in bytes. FFS is actually an internal parameter and you should set it
           to  not  less  than <b>recv_buffer_size</b> and <b>mss</b>. The default value is relatively large, therefore unless
           you set a very large receiver buffer, you do not need to change this option. Default value is 25600.

       <b>inputbw=</b><u>bytes/seconds</u>
           Sender nominal input rate, in bytes per seconds. Used along  with  <b>oheadbw</b>,  when  <b>maxbw</b>  is  set  to
           relative  (0),  to  calculate maximum sending rate when recovery packets are sent along with the main
           media stream: <b>inputbw</b> * (100 + <b>oheadbw</b>) / 100 if <b>inputbw</b> is not set while <b>maxbw</b> is  set  to  relative
           (0), the actual input rate is evaluated inside the library. Default value is 0.

       <b>iptos=</b><u>tos</u>
           IP Type of Service. Applies to sender only. Default value is 0xB8.

       <b>ipttl=</b><u>ttl</u>
           IP Time To Live. Applies to sender only. Default value is 64.

       <b>latency=</b><u>microseconds</u>
           Timestamp-based Packet Delivery Delay.  Used to absorb bursts of missed packet retransmissions.  This
           flag sets both <b>rcvlatency</b> and <b>peerlatency</b> to the same value. Note that prior to version 1.3.0 this is
           the only flag to set the latency, however this is effectively equivalent to setting <b>peerlatency</b>, when
           side  is  sender  and  <b>rcvlatency</b>  when side is receiver, and the bidirectional stream sending is not
           supported.

       <b>listen_timeout=</b><u>microseconds</u>
           Set socket listen timeout.

       <b>maxbw=</b><u>bytes/seconds</u>
           Maximum sending bandwidth, in bytes per seconds.  -1 infinite (CSRTCC limit is 30mbps) 0 relative  to
           input rate (see <b>inputbw</b>) &gt;0 absolute limit value Default value is 0 (relative)

       <b>mode=</b><u>caller|listener|rendezvous</u>
           Connection  mode.   <b>caller</b>  opens  client  connection.  <b>listener</b> starts server to listen for incoming
           connections.  <b>rendezvous</b> use Rendez-Vous connection mode.  Default value is caller.

       <b>mss=</b><u>bytes</u>
           Maximum Segment Size, in bytes. Used for buffer  allocation  and  rate  calculation  using  a  packet
           counter  assuming  fully  filled packets. The smallest MSS between the peers is used. This is 1500 by
           default in the overall internet.  This is the maximum  size  of  the  UDP  packet  and  can  be  only
           decreased, unless you have some unusual dedicated network settings. Default value is 1500.

       <b>nakreport=</b><u>1|0</u>
           If  set  to  1,  Receiver  will  send  `UMSG_LOSSREPORT` messages periodically until a lost packet is
           retransmitted or intentionally dropped. Default value is 1.

       <b>oheadbw=</b><u>percents</u>
           Recovery bandwidth overhead above input rate, in percents.  See <b>inputbw</b>. Default value is 25%.

       <b>passphrase=</b><u>string</u>
           HaiCrypt Encryption/Decryption Passphrase string, length from 10 to 79 characters. The passphrase  is
           the  shared secret between the sender and the receiver. It is used to generate the Key Encrypting Key
           using PBKDF2 (Password-Based Key Derivation Function). It is used only if <b>pbkeylen</b> is non-zero. It is
           used on the receiver only if the received data is encrypted.  The  configured  passphrase  cannot  be
           recovered (write-only).

       <b>enforced_encryption=</b><u>1|0</u>
           If  true,  both connection parties must have the same password set (including empty, that is, with no
           encryption). If the password doesn't match or  only  one  side  is  unencrypted,  the  connection  is
           rejected. Default is true.

       <b>kmrefreshrate=</b><u>packets</u>
           The  number  of  packets  to  be transmitted after which the encryption key is switched to a new key.
           Default is -1.  -1 means auto (0x1000000 in srt library). The range for this option  is  integers  in
           the 0 - "INT_MAX".

       <b>kmpreannounce=</b><u>packets</u>
           The  interval  between  when a new encryption key is sent and when switchover occurs. This value also
           applies to the subsequent interval between when switchover occurs and when the old encryption key  is
           decommissioned.  Default  is -1.  -1 means auto (0x1000 in srt library). The range for this option is
           integers in the 0 - "INT_MAX".

       <b>snddropdelay=</b><u>microseconds</u>
           The sender's extra delay before dropping packets. This delay is added to the default drop delay  time
           interval value.

           Special value -1: Do not drop packets on the sender at all.

       <b>payload_size=</b><u>bytes</u>
           Sets the maximum declared size of a packet transferred during the single call to the sending function
           in  Live  mode.  Use  0  if  this  value  isn't  used (which is default in file mode).  Default is -1
           (automatic), which typically means MPEG-TS; if you are going to use SRT to send any different kind of
           payload, such as, for example, wrapping a live stream in very small frames, then you can use a bigger
           maximum frame size, though not greater than 1456 bytes.

       <b>pkt_size=</b><u>bytes</u>
           Alias for <b>payload_size</b>.

       <b>peerlatency=</b><u>microseconds</u>
           The latency value (as described in <b>rcvlatency</b>) that is set by the sender side as a minimum value  for
           the receiver.

       <b>pbkeylen=</b><u>bytes</u>
           Sender  encryption  key  length,  in  bytes.   Only  can  be  set to 0, 16, 24 and 32.  Enable sender
           encryption if not 0.  Not required on receiver (set to 0), key size obtained from sender in  HaiCrypt
           handshake.  Default value is 0.

       <b>rcvlatency=</b><u>microseconds</u>
           The  time  that  should  elapse  since  the  moment when the packet was sent and the moment when it's
           delivered to the receiver application in the receiving function.  This time should be a  buffer  time
           large enough to cover the time spent for sending, unexpectedly extended RTT time, and the time needed
           to  retransmit  the lost UDP packet. The effective latency value will be the maximum of this options'
           value and the value of <b>peerlatency</b> set by the peer side. Before version 1.3.0  this  option  is  only
           available as <b>latency</b>.

       <b>recv_buffer_size=</b><u>bytes</u>
           Set UDP receive buffer size, expressed in bytes.

       <b>send_buffer_size=</b><u>bytes</u>
           Set UDP send buffer size, expressed in bytes.

       <b>timeout=</b><u>microseconds</u>
           Set  raise  error  timeouts  for  read,  write  and connect operations. Note that the SRT library has
           internal timeouts which can be controlled separately, the value set here is only a cap on those.

       <b>tlpktdrop=</b><u>1|0</u>
           Too-late Packet Drop. When enabled on receiver, it skips missing packets that have not been delivered
           in time and delivers the following packets to the application when their time-to-play  has  come.  It
           also  sends  a  fake ACK to the sender. When enabled on sender and enabled on the receiving peer, the
           sender drops the older packets that have no chance of being delivered in time. It  was  automatically
           enabled in the sender if the receiver supports it.

       <b>sndbuf=</b><u>bytes</u>
           Set send buffer size, expressed in bytes.

       <b>rcvbuf=</b><u>bytes</u>
           Set receive buffer size, expressed in bytes.

           Receive buffer must not be greater than <b>ffs</b>.

       <b>lossmaxttl=</b><u>packets</u>
           The value up to which the Reorder Tolerance may grow. When Reorder Tolerance is &gt; 0, then packet loss
           report  is  delayed  until  that  number of packets come in. Reorder Tolerance increases every time a
           "belated" packet has come, but it wasn't due to retransmission (that is, when  UDP  packets  tend  to
           come  out  of order), with the difference between the latest sequence and this packet's sequence, and
           not more than the value of this option. By default it's 0, which means that this mechanism is  turned
           off, and the loss report is always sent immediately upon experiencing a "gap" in sequences.

       <b>minversion</b>
           The  minimum SRT version that is required from the peer. A connection to a peer that does not satisfy
           the minimum version requirement will be rejected.

           The version format in hex is 0xXXYYZZ for x.y.z in human readable form.

       <b>streamid=</b><u>string</u>
           A string limited to 512 characters that can be set on the socket prior to connecting. This stream  ID
           will  be  able  to be retrieved by the listener side from the socket that is returned from srt_accept
           and was connected  by  a  socket  with  that  set  stream  ID.  SRT  does  not  enforce  any  special
           interpretation  of  the  contents  of  this  string.   This  option  doesn’t make sense in Rendezvous
           connection; the result might be that simply one side will override the value from the other side  and
           it’s the matter of luck which one would win

       <b>srt_streamid=</b><u>string</u>
           Alias for <b>streamid</b> to avoid conflict with ffmpeg command line option.

       <b>smoother=</b><u>live|file</u>
           The  type  of  Smoother  used  for  the  transmission  for  that socket, which is responsible for the
           transmission and congestion control. The Smoother type must be exactly the same  on  both  connecting
           parties, otherwise the connection is rejected.

       <b>messageapi=</b><u>1|0</u>
           When set, this socket uses the Message API, otherwise it uses Buffer API. Note that in live mode (see
           <b>transtype</b>) there’s only message API available. In File mode you can chose to use one of two modes:

           Stream  API  (default, when this option is false). In this mode you may send as many data as you wish
           with one sending instruction, or even use dedicated functions that read directly  from  a  file.  The
           internal  facility  will  take care of any speed and congestion control. When receiving, you can also
           receive as many data as desired, the data not extracted will be waiting for the next call.  There  is
           no boundary between data portions in the Stream mode.

           Message  API.  In this mode your single sending instruction passes exactly one piece of data that has
           boundaries (a message). Contrary to Live mode, this message may span across multiple UDP packets  and
           the  only  size  limitation is that it shall fit as a whole in the sending buffer. The receiver shall
           use as large buffer as necessary to receive the message, otherwise the message will not be given  up.
           When the message is not complete (not all packets received or there was a packet loss) it will not be
           given up.

       <b>transtype=</b><u>live|file</u>
           Sets  the  transmission  type  for the socket, in particular, setting this option sets multiple other
           parameters to their default values as required for a particular transmission type.

           live: Set options as for live transmission. In this mode, you should send by one sending  instruction
           only  so many data that fit in one UDP packet, and limited to the value defined first in <b>payload_size</b>
           (1316 is default in this mode). There is no speed control in this mode, only the  bandwidth  control,
           if configured, in order to not exceed the bandwidth with the overhead transmission (retransmitted and
           control packets).

           file: Set options as for non-live transmission. See <b>messageapi</b> for further explanations

       <b>linger=</b><u>seconds</u>
           The  number  of  seconds that the socket waits for unsent data when closing.  Default is -1. -1 means
           auto (off with 0 seconds in live mode, on with 180 seconds in file mode). The range for  this  option
           is integers in the 0 - "INT_MAX".

       <b>tsbpd=</b><u>1|0</u>
           When true, use Timestamp-based Packet Delivery mode. The default behavior depends on the transmission
           type: enabled in live mode, disabled in file mode.

           are used as master salt.

   <b>subfile</b>
       Virtually extract a segment of a file or another stream.  The underlying stream must be seekable.

       Accepted options:

       <b>start</b>
           Start offset of the extracted segment, in bytes.

       <b>end</b> End offset of the extracted segment, in bytes.  If set to 0, extract till end of file.

       Examples:

       Extract a chapter from a DVD VOB file (start and end sectors obtained externally and multiplied by 2048):

               subfile,,start,153391104,end,268142592,,:/media/dvd/VIDEO_TS/VTS_08_1.VOB

   <b>tee</b>
       Writes the output to multiple protocols. The individual outputs are separated by |

               tee:file://path/to/local/this.avi|file://path/to/local/that.avi

   <b>tcp</b>
       Transmission Control Protocol.

       The required syntax for a TCP url is:

               tcp://&lt;hostname&gt;:&lt;port&gt;[?&lt;options&gt;]

       <u>options</u> contains a list of &amp;-separated options of the form <u>key</u>=<u>val</u>.

       The list of supported options follows.

       <b>listen=</b><u>2|1|0</u>
           Listen for an incoming connection. 0 disables listen, 1 enables  listen  in  single  client  mode,  2
           enables listen in multi-client mode. Default value is 0.

       <b>local_addr=</b><u>addr</u>
           Local IP address of a network interface used for tcp socket connect.

       <b>local_port=</b><u>port</u>
           Local port used for tcp socket connect.

       <b>timeout=</b><u>microseconds</u>
           Set raise error timeout, expressed in microseconds.

           This  option is only relevant in read mode: if no data arrived in more than this time interval, raise
           error.

       <b>listen_timeout=</b><u>milliseconds</u>
           Set listen timeout, expressed in milliseconds.

       <b>recv_buffer_size=</b><u>bytes</u>
           Set receive buffer size, expressed bytes.

       <b>send_buffer_size=</b><u>bytes</u>
           Set send buffer size, expressed bytes.

       <b>tcp_nodelay=</b><u>1|0</u>
           Set TCP_NODELAY to disable Nagle's algorithm. Default value is 0.

           <u>Remark:</u> <u>Writing</u> <u>to</u> <u>the</u> <u>socket</u> <u>is</u> <u>currently</u> <u>not</u> <u>optimized</u> <u>to</u> <u>minimize</u> <u>system</u>  <u>calls</u>  <u>and</u>  <u>reduces</u>  <u>the</u>
           <u>efficiency</u> <u>/</u> <u>effect</u> <u>of</u> <u>TCP_NODELAY.</u>

       <b>tcp_mss=</b><u>bytes</u>
           Set maximum segment size for outgoing TCP packets, expressed in bytes.

       The  following  example shows how to setup a listening TCP connection with <b>ffmpeg</b>, which is then accessed
       with <b>ffplay</b>:

               ffmpeg -i &lt;input&gt; -f &lt;format&gt; tcp://&lt;hostname&gt;:&lt;port&gt;?listen
               ffplay tcp://&lt;hostname&gt;:&lt;port&gt;

   <b>tls</b>
       Transport Layer Security (TLS) / Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)

       The required syntax for a TLS/SSL url is:

               tls://&lt;hostname&gt;:&lt;port&gt;[?&lt;options&gt;]

       The following parameters can be set via command line options (or in code via "AVOption"s):

       <b>ca_file,</b> <b>cafile=</b><u>filename</u>
           A file containing certificate authority (CA) root certificates to treat as trusted. If the linked TLS
           library contains a default this might not need to be specified for verification to work, but not  all
           libraries and setups have defaults built in.  The file must be in OpenSSL PEM format.

       <b>tls_verify=</b><u>1|0</u>
           If  enabled,  try  to  verify  the peer that we are communicating with.  Note, if using OpenSSL, this
           currently only makes sure that the peer certificate is signed by one of the root certificates in  the
           CA  database,  but  it  does  not validate that the certificate actually matches the host name we are
           trying to connect to. (With other backends, the host name is validated as well.)

           This is disabled by default since it requires a CA database to be provided  by  the  caller  in  many
           cases.

       <b>cert_file,</b> <b>cert=</b><u>filename</u>
           A file containing a certificate to use in the handshake with the peer.  (When operating as server, in
           listen  mode, this is more often required by the peer, while client certificates only are mandated in
           certain setups.)

       <b>key_file,</b> <b>key=</b><u>filename</u>
           A file containing the private key for the certificate.

       <b>listen=</b><u>1|0</u>
           If enabled, listen for connections on the provided port, and assume the server role in the  handshake
           instead of the client role.

       <b>http_proxy</b>
           The HTTP proxy to tunnel through, e.g. "<a href="http://example.com">http://example.com</a>:1234".  The proxy must support the CONNECT
           method.

       Example command lines:

       To create a TLS/SSL server that serves an input stream.

               ffmpeg -i &lt;input&gt; -f &lt;format&gt; tls://&lt;hostname&gt;:&lt;port&gt;?listen&amp;cert=&lt;server.crt&gt;&amp;key=&lt;server.key&gt;

       To play back a stream from the TLS/SSL server using <b>ffplay</b>:

               ffplay tls://&lt;hostname&gt;:&lt;port&gt;

   <b>udp</b>
       User Datagram Protocol.

       The required syntax for an UDP URL is:

               udp://&lt;hostname&gt;:&lt;port&gt;[?&lt;options&gt;]

       <u>options</u> contains a list of &amp;-separated options of the form <u>key</u>=<u>val</u>.

       In  case  threading is enabled on the system, a circular buffer is used to store the incoming data, which
       allows one to reduce loss of data due to UDP socket buffer overruns. The <u>fifo_size</u>  and  <u>overrun_nonfatal</u>
       options are related to this buffer.

       The list of supported options follows.

       <b>buffer_size=</b><u>size</u>
           Set  the  UDP  maximum  socket  buffer  size in bytes. This is used to set either the receive or send
           buffer size, depending on what the socket is used for.  Default is 32  KB  for  output,  384  KB  for
           input.  See also <u>fifo_size</u>.

       <b>bitrate=</b><u>bitrate</u>
           If  set  to  nonzero,  the  output  will  have the specified constant bitrate if the input has enough
           packets to sustain it.

       <b>burst_bits=</b><u>bits</u>
           When using <u>bitrate</u> this specifies the maximum number of bits in packet bursts.

       <b>localport=</b><u>port</u>
           Override the local UDP port to bind with.

       <b>localaddr=</b><u>addr</u>
           Local IP address of a network interface used for sending packets or joining multicast groups.

       <b>pkt_size=</b><u>size</u>
           Set the size in bytes of UDP packets.

       <b>reuse=</b><u>1|0</u>
           Explicitly allow or disallow reusing UDP sockets.

       <b>ttl=</b><u>ttl</u>
           Set the time to live value (for multicast only).

       <b>connect=</b><u>1|0</u>
           Initialize the UDP socket with connect(). In this case, the destination address can't be changed with
           ff_udp_set_remote_url later.  If the destination address isn't known at the start, this option can be
           specified in ff_udp_set_remote_url, too.  This allows finding out the source address for the  packets
           with  getsockname, and makes writes return with AVERROR(ECONNREFUSED) if "destination unreachable" is
           received.  For receiving, this gives the benefit of only receiving packets from  the  specified  peer
           address/port.

       <b>sources=</b><u>address</u><b>[,</b><u>address</u><b>]</b>
           Only  receive  packets  sent  from  the  specified addresses. In case of multicast, also subscribe to
           multicast traffic coming from these addresses only.

       <b>block=</b><u>address</u><b>[,</b><u>address</u><b>]</b>
           Ignore packets sent from the specified addresses. In case  of  multicast,  also  exclude  the  source
           addresses in the multicast subscription.

       <b>fifo_size=</b><u>units</u>
           Set  the UDP receiving circular buffer size, expressed as a number of packets with size of 188 bytes.
           If not specified defaults to 7*4096.

       <b>overrun_nonfatal=</b><u>1|0</u>
           Survive in case of UDP receiving circular buffer overrun. Default value is 0.

       <b>timeout=</b><u>microseconds</u>
           Set raise error timeout, expressed in microseconds.

           This option is only relevant in read mode: if no data arrived in more than this time interval,  raise
           error.

       <b>broadcast=</b><u>1|0</u>
           Explicitly allow or disallow UDP broadcasting.

           Note that broadcasting may not work properly on networks having a broadcast storm protection.

       <u>Examples</u>

       •   Use <b>ffmpeg</b> to stream over UDP to a remote endpoint:

                   ffmpeg -i &lt;input&gt; -f &lt;format&gt; udp://&lt;hostname&gt;:&lt;port&gt;

       •   Use  <b>ffmpeg</b>  to  stream  in  mpegts  format over UDP using 188 sized UDP packets, using a large input
           buffer:

                   ffmpeg -i &lt;input&gt; -f mpegts udp://&lt;hostname&gt;:&lt;port&gt;?pkt_size=188&amp;buffer_size=65535

       •   Use <b>ffmpeg</b> to receive over UDP from a remote endpoint:

                   ffmpeg -i udp://[&lt;multicast-address&gt;]:&lt;port&gt; ...

   <b>unix</b>
       Unix local socket

       The required syntax for a Unix socket URL is:

               unix://&lt;filepath&gt;

       The following parameters can be set via command line options (or in code via "AVOption"s):

       <b>timeout</b>
           Timeout in ms.

       <b>listen</b>
           Create the Unix socket in listening mode.

   <b>zmq</b>
       ZeroMQ asynchronous messaging using the libzmq library.

       This library supports unicast streaming to multiple clients without relying on an external server.

       The required syntax for streaming or connecting to a stream is:

               zmq:tcp://ip-address:port

       Example: Create a localhost stream on port 5555:

               ffmpeg -re -i input -f mpegts zmq:tcp://127.0.0.1:5555

       Multiple clients may connect to the stream using:

               ffplay zmq:tcp://127.0.0.1:5555

       Streaming to multiple clients is implemented using a ZeroMQ Pub-Sub pattern.  The server side binds to  a
       port and publishes data. Clients connect to the server (via IP address/port) and subscribe to the stream.
       The order in which the server and client start generally does not matter.

       ffmpeg must be compiled with the --enable-libzmq option to support this protocol.

       Options can be set on the <b>ffmpeg</b>/<b>ffplay</b> command line. The following options are supported:

       <b>pkt_size</b>
           Forces the maximum packet size for sending/receiving data. The default value is 131,072 bytes. On the
           server  side,  this  sets  the  maximum  size  of sent packets via ZeroMQ. On the clients, it sets an
           internal buffer size for receiving packets. Note that pkt_size on the clients should be equal  to  or
           greater than pkt_size on the server. Otherwise the received message may be truncated causing decoding
           errors.
