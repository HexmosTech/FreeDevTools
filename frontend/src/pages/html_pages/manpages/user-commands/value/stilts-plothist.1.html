</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This  section describes a deprecated command. It still works, but you are advised to use the more capable
       <u>plot2plane</u> instead.

       <u>plothist</u> performs histogram plots, sending the output to a graphical display or writing it to a  file  in
       some  vector  or  bitmapped  graphics format. You need to supply it with values for one or more sets of X
       values, in terms of table columns, and it will bin the data and draw bars appropriately. Plot bounds, bin
       widths etc may be supplied expliicitly, but will be calculated from the data and set from defaults as ap‐
       propriate otherwise. There are many options available to configure the detailed appearance of  the  plot,
       but  in  its simplest form invocation is quite straightforward. See SUN/256 for more discussion on use of
       the plotting commands.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>xpix=</b><u>&lt;int-value&gt;</u>
              The width of the output graphic in pixels.

       <b>ypix=</b><u>&lt;int-value&gt;</u>
              The height of the output graphic in pixels.

       <b>font=</b><u>dialog|serif|...</u>
              Determines the font that will be used for textual annotation of the plot, including axes  etc.  At
              least the following fonts will be available:

                * <u>serif</u>

                * <u>sansserif</u>

                * <u>monospaced</u>

                * <u>dialog</u>

                * <u>dialoginput</u>
               as well as a range of system-dependent fonts, possibly including

                * <u>dejavu_sans</u>

                * <u>dejavu_sans_mono</u>

                * <u>dejavu_serif</u>

       <b>fontsize=</b><u>&lt;int-value&gt;</u>
              Sets the font size used for plot annotations.

       <b>fontstyle=</b><u>plain|bold|italic|bold-italic</u>
              Gives  a  style  in which the font is to be applied for plot annotations. Options are <u>plain</u>, <u>bold</u>,
              <u>italic</u> and <u>bold-italic</u>.

       <b>legend=</b><u>true|false</u>
              Determines whether a legend showing which plotting style is used for each data  set.  Defaults  to
              true if there is more than one set, false otherwise.

       <b>title=</b><u>&lt;value&gt;</u>
              A one-line title to display at the top of the plot.

       <b>omode=</b><u>swing|out|cgi|discard|auto</u>
              Determines how the drawn plot will be output, see SUN/256.

                * <u>swing</u>:  Plot  will  be displayed in a window on the screen. This plot is "live"; it can be re‐
                  sized and (except for old-style plots) navigated around with mouse actions in the same way  as
                  plots in TOPCAT.

                * <u>out</u>: Plot will be written to a file given by <u>out</u> using the graphics format given by <u>ofmt</u>.

                * <u>cgi</u>:  Plot  will be written in a way suitable for CGI use direct from a web server. The output
                  is in the graphics format given by <u>ofmt</u>, preceded by a suitable "Content-type" declaration.

                * <u>discard</u>: Plot is drawn, but discarded. There is no output.

                * <u>auto</u>: Behaves as <u>swing</u> or <u>out</u> mode depending on presence of <u>out</u> parameter

       <b>out=</b><u>&lt;out-file&gt;</u>
              The location of the output file. This is usually a filename to write to. If it  is  equal  to  the
              special value "-" the output will be written to standard output.

       <b>ofmt=</b><u>png|png-transp|gif|jpeg|pdf|svg|eps|eps-gzip</u>
              Graphics format in which the plot is written to the output file, see SUN/256. One of:

                * <u>png</u>: PNG

                * <u>png-transp</u>: PNG with transparent background

                * <u>gif</u>: GIF

                * <u>jpeg</u>: JPEG

                * <u>pdf</u>: Portable Document Format

                * <u>svg</u>: Scalable Vector Graphics

                * <u>eps</u>: Encapsulated PostScript

                * <u>eps-gzip</u>: Gzipped Encapsulated PostScript
               May default to a sensible value depending on the filename given by <u>out</u>.

       <b>inN=</b><u>&lt;table&gt;</u>
              The location of the input table. This may take one of the following forms:

                * A filename.

                * A URL.

                * The special value "<u>-</u>", meaning standard input. In this case the input format must be given ex‐
                  plicitly using the <u>ifmtN</u> parameter. Note that not all formats can be streamed in this way.

                * A scheme specification of the form <u>:&lt;scheme-name&gt;:&lt;scheme-args&gt;</u>.

                * A  system command line with either a "<u>&lt;</u>" character at the start, or a "<u>|</u>" character at the end
                  ("<u>&lt;syscmd</u>" or "<u>syscmd|</u>"). This executes the given pipeline and reads from its standard output.
                  This will probably only work on unix-like systems.
               In any case, compressed data in one of the supported compression formats (gzip, Unix compress  or
              bzip2) will be decompressed transparently.

       <b>ifmtN=</b><u>&lt;in-format&gt;</u>
              Specifies the format of the input table as specified by parameter <u>inN</u>. The known formats are list‐
              ed  in SUN/256. This flag can be used if you know what format your table is in. If it has the spe‐
              cial value <u>(auto)</u> (the default), then an attempt will be made to detect the format  of  the  table
              automatically.  This  cannot always be done correctly however, in which case the program will exit
              with an error explaining which formats were attempted. This parameter is ignored for scheme-speci‐
              fied tables.

       <b>istreamN=</b><u>true|false</u>
              If set true, the input table specified by the <u>inN</u> parameter will be read as a stream. It is neces‐
              sary to give the <u>ifmtN</u> parameter in this case. Depending on the required operations and processing
              mode, this may cause the read to fail (sometimes it is necessary  to  read  the  table  more  than
              once).  It is not normally necessary to set this flag; in most cases the data will be streamed au‐
              tomatically if that is the best thing to do. However it can sometimes result in less resource  us‐
              age  when  processing  large files in certain formats (such as VOTable). This parameter is ignored
              for scheme-specified tables.

       <b>cmdN=</b><u>&lt;cmds&gt;</u>
              Specifies processing to be performed on the table. The value of this parameter is one or  more  of
              the  filter  commands  described  in SUN/256. If more than one is given, they must be separated by
              semicolon characters (";"). This parameter can be repeated multiple times on the same command line
              to build up a list of processing steps. The sequence of commands given in  this  way  defines  the
              processing pipeline which is performed on the table.

              Commands  may  alternatively  be  supplied in an external file, by using the indirection character
              '<u>@</u>'. Thus a value of "<u>@filename</u>" causes the file <u>filename</u> to be read for a list of filter commands
              to execute. The commands in the file may be separated by newline characters and/or semicolons, and
              lines which are blank or which start with a '<u>#</u>' character are ignored. A backslash character '<u>\fR'</u>
              <u>at</u> <u>the</u> <u>end</u> <u>of</u> <u>a</u> <u>line</u> <u>joins</u> <u>it</u> <u>with</u> <u>the</u> <u>following</u> <u>line.</u>

       <b>xdataN=</b><u>&lt;expr&gt;</u>
              Gives a column name or expression for the x axis data for table N. The expression is a numeric al‐
              gebraic expression based on column names as described in SUN/256

       <b>xlo=</b><u>&lt;float-value&gt;</u>
              The lower limit for the plotted x axis. If not set, a value will be chosen which is low enough  to
              accommodate all the data.

       <b>xhi=</b><u>&lt;float-value&gt;</u>
              The upper limit for the plotted x axis. If not set, a value will be chosen which is high enough to
              accommodate all the data.

       <b>xlog=</b><u>true|false</u>
              If false (the default), the scale on the x axis is linear; if true it is logarithmic.

       <b>xflip=</b><u>true|false</u>
              If set true, the scale on the x axis will increase in the opposite sense from usual (e.g. right to
              left rather than left to right).

       <b>xlabel=</b><u>&lt;value&gt;</u>
              Specifies  a  label  to  be used for annotating axis x. A default values based on the plotted data
              will be used if no value is supplied for this parameter.

       <b>subsetNS=</b><u>&lt;expr&gt;</u>
              Gives the selection criterion for the subset labelled "<u>NS</u>". This is a boolean expression which may
              be the name of a boolean-valued column or any other boolean-valued expression. Rows for which  the
              expression  evaluates  true will be included in the subset, and those for which it evaluates false
              will not.

       <b>nameNS=</b><u>&lt;value&gt;</u>
              Provides a name to use for a subset with the symbolic label NS. This name will be used for display
              in the legend, if one is displayed.

       <b>colourNS=</b><u>&lt;rrggbb&gt;|red|blue|...</u>
              Defines the colour of bars plotted for data set NS. The value may be a 6-digit hexadecimal  number
              giving  red,  green  and  blue intensities, e.g. "<u>ff00ff</u>" for magenta. Alternatively it may be the
              name of one of the pre-defined colours. These are currently red, blue, green, grey, magenta, cyan,
              orange, pink, yellow, black and white.

              For most purposes, either the American or the British spelling  is  accepted  for  this  parameter
              name.

       <b>barstyleNS=</b><u>fill|open|...</u>
              Defines how histogram bars will be drawn for dataset NS. The options are:

                * <u>fill</u>

                * <u>open</u>

                * <u>tops</u>

                * <u>semi</u>

                * <u>semitops</u>

                * <u>spikes</u>

                * <u>fillover</u>

                * <u>openover</u>

       <b>linewidthNS=</b><u>&lt;int-value&gt;</u>
              Defines the line width for lines drawn as part of the bars for dataset NS. Only certain bar styles
              are affected by the line width.

       <b>dashNS=</b><u>dot|dash|...|&lt;a,b,...&gt;</u>
              Defines  the  dashing  pattern for lines drawn for dataset NS. To generate a dashed line the value
              may be one of the named dash types:

                * <u>dot</u>

                * <u>dash</u>

                * <u>longdash</u>

                * <u>dotdash</u>
               or may be a comma-separated string of on/off length values such as "<u>4,2,8,2</u>". A <u>null</u> value  indi‐
              cates a solid line. Only certain bar styles are affected by the dash pattern.

       <b>grid=</b><u>true|false</u>
              If true, grid lines are drawn on the plot. If false, they are absent.

       <b>antialias=</b><u>true|false</u>
              Controls  whether  lines  are  drawn using antialiasing, where applicable. If lines are drawn to a
              bitmapped-type graphics output format setting this parameter to true smooths the lines out by  us‐
              ing  gradations  of  colour for diagonal lines, and setting it false simply sets each pixel in the
              line to on or off. For vector-type graphics output formats, or for  cases  in  which  no  diagonal
              lines  are  drawn,  the setting of this parameter has no effect. Setting it true may slow the plot
              down slightly.

       <b>sequence=</b><u>&lt;suffix&gt;,&lt;suffix&gt;,...</u>
              Can be used to control the sequence in which different datasets and subsets are plotted. This will
              affect which symbols are plotted on top of, and so potentially obscure, which other ones. The val‐
              ue of this parameter is a comma-separated list of the "<u>NS</u>" suffixes which appear on the parameters
              which apply to subsets. The sets which are named will be plotted in order, so the first-named  one
              will  be at the bottom (most likely to be obscured). Note that if this parameter is supplied, then
              only those sets which are named will be plotted, so this parameter may also be  used  to  restrict
              which  plots  appear  (though  it may not be the most efficient way of doing this). If no explicit
              value is supplied for this parameter, sets will be plotted in  some  sequence  decided  by  STILTS
              (probably alphabetic by suffix).

       <b>ylo=</b><u>&lt;float-value&gt;</u>
              Lower bound for Y axis.

       <b>yhi=</b><u>&lt;float-value&gt;</u>
              Upper bound for Y axis. Autogenerated from the data if not supplied.

       <b>ylog=</b><u>true|false</u>
              Whether to use a logarithmic scale for the Y axis.

       <b>ylabel=</b><u>&lt;value&gt;</u>
              Specifies a label for annotating the vertical axis. A default value based on the type of histogram
              will be used if no value is supplied for this parameter.

       <b>weightN=</b><u>&lt;value&gt;</u>
              Defines  a  weighting  for each point accumulated to determine the height of plotted bars. If this
              parameter has a value other than 1 (the default) then instead of simply accumulating the number of
              points per bin to determine bar height, the bar height will be the sum over the weighting  expres‐
              sion  for the points in each bin. Note that with weighting, the figure drawn is no longer strictly
              speaking a histogram.

              When weighted, bars can be of negative height. An anomaly of the plot as currently implemented  is
              that  the  Y axis never descends below zero, so any such bars are currently invisible. This may be
              amended in a future release (contact the author to lobby for such an amendment).

       <b>binwidth=</b><u>&lt;float-value&gt;</u>
              Defines the width on the X axis of histogram bins. If the X axis is logarithmic, then  this  is  a
              multiplicative value.

       <b>norm=</b><u>true|false</u>
              Determines  whether bin counts are normalised. If true, histogram bars are scaled such that summed
              height of all bars over the whole dataset is equal to one. Otherwise (the default), no scaling  is
              done.

       <b>cumulative=</b><u>true|false</u>
              Determines  whether  historams are cumulative. When false (the default), the height of each bar is
              determined by counting the number of points which fall into the range on the X axis that  it  cov‐
              ers.  When true, the height is determined by counting all the points between negative infinity and
              the upper bound of the range on the X axis that it covers.

       <b>binbase=</b><u>&lt;float-value&gt;</u>
              Adjusts the offset of the bins. By default zero (or one for logarithmic X axis) is a boundary  be‐
              tween bins; other boundaries are defined by this and the bin width. If this value is adjusted, the
              lower bound of one of the bins will be set to this value, so all the bins move along by the corre‐
              sponding distance.
