</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This  program  burns  vector geometries (points, lines, and polygons) into the raster band(s) of a raster
       image.  Vectors are read from OGR supported vector formats. If the  output  raster  already  exists,  the
       affected pixels are updated in-place.

       Note  that  on  the  fly  reprojection of vector data to the coordinate system of the raster data is only
       supported since GDAL 2.1.0.

       <b>--help</b> Show this help message and exit

       <b>--help-general</b>
              Gives a brief usage message for the generic GDAL commandline options and exit.

       <b>-b</b> <b>&lt;band&gt;</b>
              The band(s) to burn values into.  Multiple -b arguments may be used to burn into a list of  bands.
              The default is to burn into band 1.  Not used when creating a new raster.

       <b>-i</b>     Invert  rasterization.   Burn  the  fixed  burn value, or the burn value associated with the first
              feature into all parts of the image <u>not</u> inside the provided polygon.

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 When the vector features contain a polygon nested within another polygon (like an island  in  a
                 lake), GDAL must be built against GEOS to get correct results.

       <b>-at</b>    Enables  the ALL_TOUCHED rasterization option so that all pixels touched by lines or polygons will
              be updated, not just those on the line render path, or whose center point is  within  the  polygon
              (behavior is unspecified when the polygon is just touching the pixel center). Defaults to disabled
              for normal rendering rules.

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 When this option is enabled, the order of the input features (lines or polygons) can affect the
                 results.  When  two  features  touch each other, the last one (i.e. topmost) will determine the
                 burned pixel value at the edge.  You may wish to use the <u>-sql</u> option to  reorder  the  features
                 (ORDER BY) to achieve a more predictable result.

       <b>-burn</b> <b>&lt;value&gt;</b>
              A  fixed  value to burn into a band for all objects.  A list of <u>-burn</u> options can be supplied, one
              per band being written to.

       <b>-a</b> <b>&lt;attribute_name&gt;</b>
              Identifies an attribute field on the features to be used for a burn-in value.  The value  will  be
              burned into all output bands.

       <b>-3d</b>    Indicates  that  a  burn  value should be extracted from the "Z" values of the feature. Works with
              points and lines (linear interpolation along each segment).  For polygons, works properly only  if
              the are flat (same Z value for all vertices).

       <b>-add</b>   Instead  of  burning  a  new  value, this adds the new value to the existing raster.  Suitable for
              heatmaps for instance.

       <b>-l</b> <b>&lt;layername&gt;</b>
              Indicates the layer(s) from the datasource that will be used for input features.  May be specified
              multiple times, but at least one layer name or a <u>-sql</u> option must be specified (not both).

       <b>-where</b> <b>&lt;expression&gt;</b>
              An optional SQL WHERE style query expression to be applied to select features to burn in from  the
              input layer(s).

       <b>-sql</b> <b>&lt;select_statement&gt;</b>
              An  SQL statement to be evaluated against the datasource to produce a virtual layer of features to
              be burned in.  Starting with GDAL 3.7, the <b>@filename</b> syntax can  be  used  to  indicate  that  the
              content is in the pointed filename.

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 This option will be ignored if the <u>-l</u> option has been set as well.

       <b>-dialect</b> <b>&lt;dialect&gt;</b>
              SQL  dialect.  In some cases can be used to use (unoptimized) OGR SQL instead of the native SQL of
              an RDBMS by passing OGRSQL. The "SQLITE" dialect can also be used with any datasource.

              New in version 2.1.

       <b>-of</b> <b>&lt;format&gt;</b>
              Select the output format. Starting with GDAL 2.3, if not specified, the format is guessed from the
              extension (previously was GTiff). Use the short format name.

       <b>-a_nodata</b> <b>&lt;value&gt;</b>
              Assign a specified nodata value to output bands.

       <b>-init</b> <b>&lt;value&gt;</b>
              Pre-initialize the output image bands with these values.  However, it is not marked as the  nodata
              value in the output file.  If only one value is given, the same value is used in all the bands.

       <b>-a_srs</b> <b>&lt;srs_def&gt;</b>
              Override  the projection for the output file. If not specified, the projection of the input vector
              file will be used if available. When using this option, no reprojection of features from  the  SRS
              of  the input vector to the specified SRS of the output raster, so use only this option to correct
              an invalid source SRS.  The &lt;srs_def&gt; may be any  of  the  usual  GDAL/OGR  forms,  complete  WKT,
              PROJ.4, EPSG:n or a file containing the WKT.

       <b>-to</b> <b>&lt;NAME&gt;=&lt;VALUE&gt;</b>
              set a transformer option suitable to pass to <u>GDALCreateGenImgProjTransformer2()</u>. This is used when
              converting  geometries  coordinates  to target raster pixel space. For example this can be used to
              specify RPC related transformer options.

              New in version 2.3.

       <b>-co</b> <b>&lt;NAME&gt;=&lt;VALUE&gt;</b>
              Many formats have one or more optional creation options that can be used  to  control  particulars
              about  the  file  created.  For  instance, the GeoTIFF driver supports creation options to control
              compression, and whether the file should be tiled.

              The creation options available vary by format driver, and some simple  formats  have  no  creation
              options  at all. A list of options supported for a format can be listed with the <u>--formats</u> command
              line option but the documentation for the format is the definitive source of information on driver
              creation options.  See <u>Raster</u> <u>drivers</u> format specific documentation for legal creation options for
              each format.

       <b>-te</b> <b>&lt;xmin&gt;</b> <b>&lt;ymin&gt;</b> <b>&lt;xmax&gt;</b> <b>&lt;ymax&gt;</b>
              Set georeferenced extents. The values must be expressed in georeferenced units.  If not specified,
              the extent of the output file will be the extent of the vector layers.

       <b>-tr</b> <b>&lt;xres&gt;</b> <b>&lt;yres&gt;</b>
              Set target resolution. The values must be expressed in georeferenced units.  Both must be positive
              values.

       <b>-tap</b>   (target aligned pixels) Align the coordinates of the extent of the output file to  the  values  of
              the  <u>-tr</u>,  such  that the aligned extent includes the minimum extent.  Alignment means that xmin /
              resx, ymin / resy, xmax / resx and ymax / resy are integer values.

       <b>-ts</b> <b>&lt;width&gt;</b> <b>&lt;height&gt;</b>
              Set output file size in pixels and lines. Note that <u>-ts</u> cannot be used with <u>-tr</u>

       <b>-ot</b> <b>&lt;type&gt;</b>
              Force the output bands to be of the indicated data type. Defaults to <b>Float64</b>, unless the attribute
              field to burn is of type <b>Int64</b>, in which case <b>Int64</b> is used for the output raster data type if the
              output driver supports it.

       <b>-optim</b> <b>{AUTO|VECTOR|RASTER}</b>
              Force the algorithm used (results are identical). The raster  mode  is  used  in  most  cases  and
              optimise  read/write  operations. The vector mode is useful with a decent amount of input features
              and optimise the CPU use. That mode have to be used with tiled images to be  efficient.  The  auto
              mode (the default) will chose the algorithm based on input and output properties.

              New in version 2.3.

       <b>-oo</b> <b>&lt;NAME&gt;=&lt;VALUE&gt;</b>
              New in version 3.7.

              Source dataset open option (format specific)

       <b>-q</b>     Suppress progress monitor and other non-error output.

       <b>&lt;src_datasource&gt;</b>
              Any OGR supported readable datasource.

       <b>&lt;dst_filename&gt;</b>
              The GDAL supported output file.  Must support update mode access.  This file will be created if it
              does  not  already  exist  If  the  output  raster already exists, the affected pixels are updated
              in-place.

       The program creates a new target raster image when any of the <u>-of</u>, <u>-a_nodata</u>, <u>-init</u>,  <u>-a_srs</u>,  <u>-co</u>,  <u>-te</u>,
       <u>-tr</u>,  <u>-tap</u>,  <u>-ts</u>, or <u>-ot</u> options are used.  The resolution or size must be specified using the <u>-tr</u> or <u>-ts</u>
       option for all new rasters.  The target raster will be overwritten if it already exists and any of  these
       creation-related options are used.

</pre><h4><b>C</b> <b>API</b></h4><pre>
       This utility is also callable from C with <u>GDALRasterize()</u>.

       New in version 2.1.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       The  following  would  burn all polygons from mask.shp into the RGB TIFF file work.tif with the color red
       (RGB = 255,0,0).

          gdal_rasterize -b 1 -b 2 -b 3 -burn 255 -burn 0 -burn 0 -l mask mask.shp work.tif

       The following would burn all "class A"  buildings  into  the  output  elevation  file,  pulling  the  top
       elevation from the ROOF_H attribute.

          gdal_rasterize -a ROOF_H -where "class='A'" -l footprints footprints.shp city_dem.tif

       The  following would burn all polygons from footprint.shp into a new 1000x1000 rgb TIFF as the color red.
       Note that <u>-b</u> is not used; the order of the <u>-burn</u> options determines the bands of the output raster.

          gdal_rasterize -burn 255 -burn 0 -burn 0 -ot Byte -ts 1000 1000 -l footprints footprints.shp mask.tif
