</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       mysqlreport - Makes a friendly report of important MySQL status values

</pre><h4><b>SYNTAX</b></h4><pre>
       mysqlreport [<u>options</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       mysqlreport  makes  a  friendly  report  of  important MySQL status values. Actually, it makes a friendly
       report of nearly every status value from SHOW STATUS.  Unlike SHOW STATUS which  simply  dumps  over  100
       values  to  screen in one long list, mysqlreport interprets and formats the values and presents the basic
       values and many more inferred values in a human-readable format. Numerous example reports  are  available
       at the mysqlreport web page at <a href="http://hackmysql.com/mysqlreport">http://hackmysql.com/mysqlreport</a>.

       The  benefit  of  mysqlreport  is  that  it  allows  you  to very quickly see a wide array of performance
       indicators for your MySQL server which would otherwise need to be calculated by hand from all the various
       SHOW STATUS values. For example, the Index Read Ratio is an important value but it's not present in  SHOW
       STATUS; it's an inferred value (the ratio of Key_reads to Key_read_requests).

       This  documentation  outlines  all  the  command line options in mysqlreport, most of which control which
       reports are printed. This document does not address how to interpret these reports; that topic is covered
       in the document Guide To Understanding mysqlreport at <a href="http://hackmysql.com/mysqlreportguide">http://hackmysql.com/mysqlreportguide</a>.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Technically, command line options are in the form --option, but -option works too.  All  options  can  be
       abbreviated if the abbreviation is unique. For example, option --host can be abbreviated --ho but not --h
       because --h is ambiguous: it could mean --host or --help.

       <b>--help</b> Output help information and exit.

       <b>--user</b> <b>USER</b>

       <b>--password</b>
              As  of  version  2.3  --password  can take the password on the command line like "--password FOO".
              Using --password alone without giving a password on the command line causes mysqlreport to  prompt
              for a password.

       <b>--host</b> <b>ADDRESS</b>

       <b>--port</b> <b>PORT</b>

       <b>--socket</b> <b>SOCKET</b>

       <b>--no-mycnf</b>
              --no-mycnf  makes  mysqlreport  not  read <a href="file:~/.my.cnf">~/.my.cnf</a> which it does by default otherwise. --user and
              --password always override values from <a href="file:~/.my.cnf.">~/.my.cnf.</a>

       <b>--dtq</b>  Print Distribution of Total Queries (DTQ) report (under Total in Questions  report).  Queries  (or
              Questions)  can  be  divided  into four main areas: DMS (see --dms below), Com_ (see --com below),
              COM_QUIT (see COM_QUIT and Questions at <a href="http://hackmysql.com/com_quit">http://hackmysql.com/com_quit</a>), and Unknown.  --dtq  lists
              the number of queries in each of these areas in descending order.

       <b>--dms</b>  Print  Data  Manipulation  Statements  (DMS) report (under DMS in Questions report). DMS are those
              from the MySQL  manual  section  13.2.  Data  Manipulation  Statements.   (Currently,  mysqlreport
              considers  only  SELECT,  INSERT,  REPLACE,  UPDATE, and DELETE.) Each DMS is listed in descending
              order by count.

       <b>--com</b> <b>N</b>
              Print top N number of non-DMS Com_ status values in  descending  order  (after  DMS  in  Questions
              report).  If  N  is  not  given,  default  is  3.  Such non-DMS Com_ values include Com_change_db,
              Com_show_tables, Com_rollback, etc.

       <b>--sas</b>  Print report for Select_ and Sort_ status values (after Questions report). See  MySQL  Select  and
              Sort Status Variables at <a href="http://hackmysql.com/selectandsort">http://hackmysql.com/selectandsort</a>.

       <b>--tab</b>  Print  Threads,  Aborted,  and Bytes status reports (after Created temp report). As of mysqlreport
              v2.3 the Threads report reports on all Threads_ status values.

       <b>--qcache</b>
              Print Query Cache report.

       <b>--all</b>  Equivalent to "--dtq --dms --com 3 --sas --qcache".  (Notice --tab is not invoked by --all.)

       <b>--infile</b> <b>FILE</b>
              Instead of getting SHOW STATUS values from MySQL, read values from FILE. FILE is often a  copy  of
              the  output of SHOW STATUS including formatting characters (|, +, -).  mysqlreport expects FILE to
              have the format " value number " where value is only alpha and underscore characters (A-Z  and  _)
              and  number is a positive integer. Anything before, between, or after value and number is ignored.
              mysqlreport  also  needs   the   following   MySQL   server   variables:   version,   table_cache,
              max_connections, key_buffer_size, query_cache_size. These values can be specified in INFILE in the
              format  "name  =  value"  where  name is one of the aforementioned server variables and value is a
              positive integer with or without a trailing M and possible periods (for version). For example,  to
              specify  an  18M key_buffer_size: key_buffer_size = 18M. Or, a 256 table_cache: table_cache = 256.
              The M implies Megabytes not million, so 18M means  18,874,368  not  18,000,000.  If  these  server
              variables are not specified the following defaults are used (respectively) which may cause strange
              values to be reported: 0.0.0, 64, 100, 8M, 0.

       <b>--outfile</b> <b>FILE</b>
              After  printing the report to screen, print the report to FILE too. Internally, mysqlreport always
              writes the report to a temp file first: /tmp/mysqlreport.PID on *nix, c:sqlreport.PID  on  Windows
              (PID  is  the  script's  process ID). Then it prints the temp file to screen. Then if --outfile is
              specified, the temp file is copied to OUTFILE. After --email (below), the temp file is deleted.

       <b>--email</b> <b>ADDRESS</b>
              After printing the report to screen, email the report to ADDRESS. This option requires sendmail in
              <a href="file:/usr/sbin/">/usr/sbin/</a>, therefore it does not work on Windows.  /usr/sbin/sendmail can be a sym link to qmail,
              for example, or any MTA that emulates sendmail's -t command line option and operation.  The  FROM:
              field is "mysqlreport", SUBJECT: is "MySQL status report".

       <b>--flush-status</b>
              Execute  a  "FLUSH STATUS;" after generating the reports.  If you do not have permissions in MySQL
              to do this an error from DBD::MariaDB::st will be printed after the reports.
