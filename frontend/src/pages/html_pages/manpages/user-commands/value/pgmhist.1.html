</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       pgmhist - print a histogram of the values in a PGM image

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>pgmhist</b>

       [<b>-median</b>, <b>-quartile</b>, <b>-decile</b>]

       [<b>-forensic</b>]

       [<b>-machine</b>]

       [<u>pgmfile</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This program is part of <b><a href="../man1/Netpbm.1.html">Netpbm</a></b>(1).

       <b>pgmhist</b>  reads  a  PGM  image  as  input  and  prints  a histogram of the gray values or other gray value
       distribution metrics.

       If you specify none of <b>-median</b>, <b>-quartile</b>, or <b>-decile</b>, <b>pgmhist</b> prints a complete  histogram  showing  how
       many pixels of each possible gray value exist in the image.  Along with each gray value, it tells you how
       many pixels are at lest as black as it and how many are at least as white.

       <b>-median</b>,  <b>-quartile</b>,  and  <b>-decile</b>  options cause <b>pgmhist</b> instead to print the indicated quantiles.  Each
       quantile is a gray value that actually appears in the image (as opposed to  fractional  values  that  are
       sometimes  used  for  quantiles).  The 3rd quartile is the least gray value for which at least 75% of the
       pixels are as dark or darker than it.  The 4th quartile is the brightest gray value that appears  in  the
       image.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       In  addition  to  the options common to all programs based on libnetpbm (most notably <b>-quiet</b>, see  Common
       Options ), <b>pgmhist</b> recognizes the following command line options:

       You may specify at most one of <b>-median</b>, <b>-quartile</b>, and <b>-decile</b>.  If none of these  is  specified  <b>pgmhist</b>
       prints a histogram of gray values.

       <b>-median</b>

              This option causes <b>pgmhist</b> to print the median gray value.

              This option was new in Netpbm 10.61 (December 2012).

       <b>-quartile</b>

              This option causes <b>pgmhist</b> to print the four quartile gray values.

              This option was new in Netpbm 10.61 (December 2012).

       <b>-decile</b>

              This option causes <b>pgmhist</b> to print the ten decile gray values.

              This option was new in Netpbm 10.61 (December 2012).

       <b>-forensic</b>

              With  this  option, <b>pgmhist</b> works on images that contain invalid gray values.  Normally, like most
              Netpbm programs, <b>pgmhist</b> fails if it encounters a gray value greater  than  the  maxval  that  the
              image  declares.   The  presence of such a value means the image is invalid, so the pixels have no
              meaning.  But with <b>-forensic</b>, <b>pgmhist</b> produces a histogram  of  the  actual  gray  values  without
              regard to maxval.  It issues messages summarizing the invalid pixels if there are any.

              One use for this is to diagnose the problem that caused the invalid Netpbm image to exist.

              There  is  a  small  exception  to  the  ability  of  <b>pgmhist</b>  to process invalid pixels even with
              <b>-forensic</b>: it can never process a gray value greater than 65535.  Note that  in  the  rarely  used
              Plain  PGM  format,  it  is  possible  for a number greater than that to appear where a gray value
              belongs.

              This option was new in Netpbm 10.66 (March 2014).  But Netpbm older than 10.66 does  not  properly
              reject invalid sample values, so the effect is very similar to <b>-forensic</b>.

       <b>-machine</b>

              This  option  causes  <b>pgmhist</b>  to print the information in a way easily digestible by a machine as
              opposed to a human.

              For the quantiles, there is one line per quantile, in quantile order, and it consists of the  gray
              value of the quantile in decimal with no leading zeroes.

              For the full histogram output, it consists of one line per possible gray value (whether that value
              appears  in  the  image  or  not),  in  order of the gray values.  The line consists of two tokens
              separated by a space.  The first is the gray value; the second is the  number  of  pixels  in  the
              image that have that gray value.  Both are decimal numbers without leading zeroes.

              This option was new in Netpbm 10.61 (December 2012).
