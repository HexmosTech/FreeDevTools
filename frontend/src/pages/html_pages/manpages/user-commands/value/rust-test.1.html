</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Check file types and compare values.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
              Print help

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--version</b>
              Print version

</pre><h4><b>EXTRA</b></h4><pre>
       Exit with the status determined by EXPRESSION.

       An omitted EXPRESSION defaults to false.  Otherwise, EXPRESSION is true or false and sets exit status.

       It is one of:

       *  (  EXPRESSION  )               EXPRESSION is true * ! EXPRESSION                 EXPRESSION is false *
       EXPRESSION1 -a EXPRESSION2   both EXPRESSION1 and EXPRESSION2  are  true  *  EXPRESSION1  -o  EXPRESSION2
       either EXPRESSION1 or EXPRESSION2 is true

       String   operations:   *   -n   STRING              the   length   of   STRING   is   nonzero   *  STRING
       equivalent to -n STRING * -z STRING            the length of STRING is zero * STRING1  =  STRING2     the
       strings are equal * STRING1 != STRING2   the strings are not equal

       Integer  comparisons:  *  INTEGER1  -eq  INTEGER2   INTEGER1 is equal to INTEGER2 * INTEGER1 -ge INTEGER2
       INTEGER1 is greater than or equal to INTEGER2 * INTEGER1 -gt INTEGER2   INTEGER1 is greater than INTEGER2
       * INTEGER1 -le INTEGER2   INTEGER1 is less than or equal to INTEGER2 * INTEGER1 -lt  INTEGER2    INTEGER1
       is less than INTEGER2 * INTEGER1 -ne INTEGER2   INTEGER1 is not equal to INTEGER2

       File  operations:  * FILE1 -ef FILE2   FILE1 and FILE2 have the same device and inode numbers * FILE1 -nt
       FILE2   FILE1 is newer (modification date) than FILE2 * FILE1 -ot FILE2   FILE1 is older than FILE2

       * -b FILE     FILE exists and is block special * -c FILE     FILE exists and is character  special  *  -d
       FILE      FILE  exists  and  is  a directory * -e FILE     FILE exists * -f FILE     FILE exists and is a
       regular file * -g FILE     FILE exists and is set-group-ID * -G FILE     FILE exists and is owned by  the
       effective  group  ID  *  -h  FILE      FILE exists and is a symbolic link (same as -L) * -k FILE     FILE
       exists and has its sticky bit set * -L FILE     FILE exists and is a symbolic link (same as -h) * -N FILE
       FILE exists and has been modified since it was last read * -O FILE     FILE exists and is  owned  by  the
       effective  user  ID  *  -p  FILE      FILE  exists and is a named pipe * -r FILE     FILE exists and read
       permission is granted * -s FILE     FILE exists and has a size greater  than  zero  *  -S  FILE      FILE
       exists and is a socket * -t FD       file descriptor FD is opened on a terminal * -u FILE     FILE exists
       and  its  set-user-ID  bit  is  set  *  -w FILE     FILE exists and write permission is granted * -x FILE
       FILE exists and execute (or search) permission is granted

       Except for -h  and  -L,  all  FILE-related  tests  dereference  (follow)  symbolic  links.   Beware  that
       parentheses  need  to be escaped (e.g., by backslashes) for shells.  INTEGER may also be -l STRING, which
       evaluates to the length of STRING.

       NOTE: Binary -a and -o are inherently ambiguous.  Use test EXPR1 &amp;&amp; test EXPR2  or  test  EXPR1  ||  test
       EXPR2 instead.

       NOTE:  [  honors  the  --help  and --version options, but test does not.  test treats each of those as it
       treats any other nonempty STRING.

       NOTE: your shell may have its own version  of  test  and/or  [,  which  usually  supersedes  the  version
       described here.  Please refer to your shell's documentation for details about the options it supports.
