</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>g.region</u> module allows the user to manage the settings  of  the  current  geographic  region.   These
       regional  boundaries  can  be  set  by the user directly and/or set from a region definition file (stored
       under the windows directory in the user’s current mapset).  The user can create,  modify,  and  store  as
       many  geographic  region  definitions  as  desired  for  any  given  mapset.   However, only one of these
       geographic region definitions will be current at any given moment, for a specified mapset;   i.e.,  GRASS
       programs that respect the geographic region settings will use the current geographic region settings.

</pre><h4><b>DEFINITIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Region:</b>
           In  GRASS, a <u>region</u> refers to a geographic area with some defined boundaries, based on a specific map
           coordinate system and map projection.  Each region also has associated with it the specific east-west
           and north-south resolutions of its smallest units (rectangular units called "cells").

       The region’s boundaries are given as the northernmost, southernmost, easternmost, and westernmost  points
       that define its extent (cell edges).  The north and south boundaries are commonly called <u>northings</u>, while
       the east and west boundaries are called <u>eastings</u>.

       The  region’s  cell  resolution  defines  the  size  of  the smallest piece of data recognized (imported,
       analyzed, displayed, stored, etc.) by  GRASS  modules  affected  by  the  current  region  settings.  The
       north-south  and  east-west cell resolutions need not be the same, thus allowing non-square data cells to
       exist.

       Typically all raster and display modules are affected by the current  region  settings,  but  not  vector
       modules.  Some special modules diverge from this rule, for example raster import modules and <u>v.in.region</u>.

       <b>Default</b> <b>Region:</b>
           Each  GRASS  project  (previously  called location) has a fixed geographic region, called the default
           geographic region (stored in the region file DEFAULT_WIND under the special mapset  PERMANENT),  that
           defines  the  extent  of  the  data  base.   While  this  provides  a starting point for defining new
           geographic regions, user-defined geographic regions need not fall within this geographic region.  The
           current  region  can be reset to the default region with the <b>-d</b> flag. The default region is initially
           set when the project is first created and can be reset using the <b>-s</b> flag.

       <b>Current</b> <b>Region:</b>
           Each mapset has a current geographic region.  This region defines the geographic area  in  which  all
           GRASS displays and raster analyses will be done. Raster data will be resampled, if necessary, to meet
           the cell resolutions of the current geographic region setting.

       <b>Saved</b> <b>Regions:</b>
           Each GRASS MAPSET may contain any number of pre-defined, and named, geographic regions.  These region
           definitions  are  stored  in  the  user’s  current  mapset location under the windows directory (also
           referred to as the user’s saved region definitions).  Any of these pre-defined geographic regions may
           be selected, by name, to become the current geographic region.  Users may also  access  saved  region
           definitions  stored  under other mapsets in the current project, if these mapsets are included in the
           user’s mapset search path or the ’@’ operator is used (region_name@mapset).

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       After all updates have been applied, the current region’s southern and western boundaries are  (silently)
       adjusted  so  that  the  north/south  distance  is  a multiple of the north/south resolution and that the
       east/west distance is a multiple of the east/west resolution.

       With the <b>-a</b> flag all four boundaries are adjusted to be even multiples of the  resolution,  aligning  the
       region to the resolution supplied by the user. The default is to align the region resolution to match the
       region boundaries.

       The  <b>-m</b>  flag  will report the region resolution in meters. The resolution is calculated by averaging the
       resolution at the region boundaries. This resolution is calculated by dividing the geodesic  distance  in
       meters  at the boundary by the number of rows or columns.  For example the east / west resolution (ewres)
       is determined from an average of the geodesic distances at the North and South boundaries divided by  the
       number of columns.

       The <b>-p</b> (or <b>-g</b>) option is recognized last.  This means that all changes are applied to the region settings
       before printing occurs.

       The  <b>-g</b>  flag prints the current region settings in shell script style.  This format can be given back to
       <u>g.region</u> on its command line.  This may also be  used  to  save  region  settings  as  shell  environment
       variables with the UNIX eval command, "eval `g.region -g`".

       With <b>-u</b> flag current region is not updated even if one or more options for changing region is used (<b>res=</b>,
       <b>raster=</b>,  etc).   This  can  be  used for example to print modified region values for further use without
       actually modifying the current region.  Similarly, <b>-o</b> flag forces to update current region file even when
       e.g., only printing was specified. Flag <b>-o</b> was added in GRASS GIS version 8 to simulate <u>g.region</u> behavior
       in prior versions when current region file was always updated unless <b>-u</b> was specified.

   <b>Additional</b> <b>parameter</b> <b>information:</b>
       <b>zoom=</b><u>name</u>
           Shrink current region settings to the smallest region encompassing all non-NULL  data  in  the  named
           raster  map  layer that fall inside the user’s current region. In this way you can tightly zoom in on
           isolated clumps within a bigger map.

       If the user also includes the <b>raster=</b><u>name</u> option on the command line,  <b>zoom=</b><u>name</u>  will  set  the  current
       region  settings  to  the  smallest region encompassing all non-NULL data in the named <b>zoom</b> map that fall
       inside the region stated in the cell header for the named <b>raster</b> map.

       <b>align=</b><u>name</u>
           Set the current resolution equal to that of the named raster map, and align the current region  to  a
           row  and column edge in the named map.  Alignment only moves the existing region edges outward to the
           edges of the next nearest cell in the named raster map - not to the named map’s  edges.   To  perform
           the latter function, use the <b>raster=</b><u>name</u> option.

        g.region -g
           The <b>-g</b> option prints the region in the following script style (key=value) format:
           n=4928000
           s=4914000

        g.region -bg
           The  <b>-bg</b>  option prints the region in the following script style (key=value) format plus the boundary
           box in latitude-longitude/WGS84:
           n=4928000
           s=4914000

           LL_S=44.37302019

        g.region -l
           The <b>-l</b> option prints the region in the following format:
           long: -103.86789484 lat: 44.50165890 (north/west corner)
           long: -103.62895703 lat: 44.49904013 (north/east corner)
           long: -103.63190061 lat: 44.37303558 (south/east corner)

        g.region -pm
           This will print the current region in the format (latitude-longitude project):
           projection: 3 (Latitude-Longitude)
           zone:       0
           ellipsoid:  wgs84

           Note that the resolution is here reported in meters, not decimal degrees.

   <b>Changing</b> <b>extent</b> <b>and</b> <b>raster</b> <b>resolution</b> <b>using</b> <b>values</b>
        g.region n=7360100 e=699000
           will reset the northing and easting for the current region, but leave the south edge, west edge,  and
           the region cell resolutions unchanged.

        g.region n=51:36:05N e=10:10:05E s=51:29:55N w=9:59:55E res=0:00:01
           will  reset  the  northing, easting, southing, westing and resolution for the current region, here in
           DMS latitude-longitude style (decimal degrees and degrees with decimal minutes can also be used).

        g.region -dp s=698000
           will set the current region from the default region for the GRASS project, reset the  south  edge  to
           698000, and then print the result.

        g.region n=n+1000 w=w-500
           The  n=<u>value</u>  may  also  be  specified  as  a function of its current value:  n=n+<u>value</u> increases the
           current northing, while n=n-<u>value</u> decreases it.  This is also true for s=<u>value</u>, e=<u>value</u>, and w=<u>value</u>.
           In this example the current region’s northern boundary is extended by  1000  units  and  the  current
           region’s western boundary is decreased by 500 units.

        g.region n=s+1000 e=w+1000
           This  form  allows  the  user  to  set the region boundary values relative to one another.  Here, the
           northern boundary coordinate is  set  equal  to  1000  units  larger  than  the  southern  boundary’s
           coordinate  value, and the eastern boundary’s coordinate value is set equal to 1000 units larger than
           the western boundary’s coordinate value.  The corresponding forms s=n-<u>value</u> and

       w=e-<u>value</u> may be used to set the values of the region’s southern and western boundaries, relative to  the
       northern and eastern boundary values.

   <b>Changing</b> <b>extent</b> <b>and</b> <b>raster</b> <b>resolution</b> <b>using</b> <b>maps</b>
        g.region raster=soils
           This  form  will  make the current region settings exactly the same as those given in the cell header
           file for the raster map layer <u>soils</u>.

        g.region raster=soils zoom=soils
           This form will first look up the cell header file for the raster map layer <u>soils</u>,  use  this  as  the
           current  region  setting,  and  then  shrink  the  region  down  to  the  smallest region which still
           encompasses all non-NULL data in the map layer <u>soils</u>.  Note that if the parameter  <u>raster=soils</u>  were
           not specified, the zoom would shrink to encompass all non-NULL data values in the soils map that were
           located within the <u>current</u> <u>region</u> settings.

        g.region -up raster=soils
           The <b>-u</b> option suppresses the re-setting of the current region definition.  This can be useful when it
           is  desired to only extract region information.  In this case, the cell header file for the soils map
           layer is printed without changing the current region settings.

        g.region -up zoom=soils save=soils
           This will zoom into the smallest region which encompasses all non-NULL soils data  values,  and  save
           the  new  region  settings in a file to be called <u>soils</u> and stored under the windows directory in the
           user’s current mapset.  The current region settings are not changed.

   <b>Changing</b> <b>extent</b> <b>and</b> <b>raster</b> <b>resolution</b> <b>in</b> <b>3D</b>
        g.region b=0 t=3000 tbres=200 res3=100 g.region -p3
           This will define the 3D region for voxel computations.  In this example a volume with bottom (0m)  to
           top (3000m) at horizontal resolution (100m) and vertical resolution (200m) is defined.

   <b>Using</b> <b>g.region</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>shell</b> <b>in</b> <b>combination</b> <b>with</b> <b>OGR</b>
       Extracting  a  spatial  subset  of  the  external  vector  map  soils.shp  into  new  external vector map
       soils_cut.shp using the OGR <u>ogr2ogr</u> tool:
       eval `g.region -g`
       ogr2ogr -spat $w $s $e $n soils_cut.shp soils.shp
       This requires that the project and the SHAPE file CRS’ match.

   <b>Using</b> <b>g.region</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>shell</b> <b>in</b> <b>combination</b> <b>with</b> <b>GDAL</b>
       Extracting a spatial subset of the external raster map p016r035_7t20020524_z17_nn30.tif into new external
       raster map p016r035_7t20020524_nc_spm_wake_nn30.tif using the GDAL <u>gdalwarp</u> tool:
       eval `g.region -g`
       gdalwarp -t_srs "`g.proj -wf`" -te $w $s $e $n \
                p016r035_7t20020524_z17_nn30.tif \
                p016r035_7t20020524_nc_spm_wake_nn30.tif
       Here the input raster map does not have to match the project’s coordinate reference system  since  it  is
       reprojected on the fly.
