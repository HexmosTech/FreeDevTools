</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       safe-rm - wrapper around the rm command to prevent accidental deletions

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       safe-rm [ ... ] (same arguments as rm)

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       safe-rm prevents the accidental deletion of important files by replacing rm with a wrapper which checks
       the given arguments against a configurable list of exclusions for files and directories which should
       never be removed.

       Users who attempt to delete one of these protected files or directories will not be able to do so and
       will be shown a warning message instead.

       safe-rm is meant to replace the rm command so you can achieve this by putting a symbolic link with the
       name "rm" in a directory which sits at the front of your path. For example, given this path:

         PATH=<a href="file:/usr/local/bin">/usr/local/bin</a>:<a href="file:/bin">/bin</a>:<a href="file:/usr/bin">/usr/bin</a>

       You could create the following symbolic link:

         ln -s /usr/local/bin/safe-rm /usr/local/bin/rm

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       Protected paths can be set both at the site and user levels.

       All of these configuration files can contain a list of important files or directories (one per line):

         /etc/safe-rm.conf
         /usr/local/etc/safe-rm.conf
         <a href="file:~/.config/safe-rm">~/.config/safe-rm</a>

       If all of these are empty, a default list of important paths will be used.

         <a href="file:/usr/lib/">/usr/lib/</a>*

       will protect all of the files inside the <a href="file:/usr/lib">/usr/lib</a> directory if they are referred to directly, but it will
       not protect your system against:

         rm -rf <a href="file:/usr/lib">/usr/lib</a>

       For a full protection, you should include both of these lines:

         <a href="file:/usr/lib">/usr/lib</a>
         <a href="file:/usr/lib/">/usr/lib/</a>*

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       Same exit status as the real rm command.

       Note that if all file arguments are skipped by safe-rm then the exit status will be the same as the exit
       status of the real rm when no files arguments are present.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b> <b>AND</b> <b>LIMITATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Note that if you put the following in your protected paths list:

         $ cat /etc/safe-rm.conf
         <a href="file:/usr/lib">/usr/lib</a>

       Then safe-rm will prevent you from deleting the directory:

         $ rm -rf <a href="file:/usr/lib">/usr/lib</a>
         Skipping <a href="file:/usr/lib">/usr/lib</a>
         <a href="file:/bin/rm">/bin/rm</a>: missing operand
         Try `<a href="file:/bin/rm">/bin/rm</a> --help' for more information.

       However it cannot protect you from the following:

         $ cd <a href="file:/usr/lib">/usr/lib</a>
         $ rm -f *
