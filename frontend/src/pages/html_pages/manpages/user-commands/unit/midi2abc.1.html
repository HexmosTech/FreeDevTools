       <b>midi2abc</b> - program to convert MIDI format files to abc notation

       midi2abc  -f  <u>infile</u> [-xa] [-ga] [-a <u>acbeats</u>] [-m <u>time</u> <u>signature</u>] [-ppu parts per unit] [-aul denominator

       [-mftextpulses] [-nogr] [-title string] [-origin string][-midinotes]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>midi2abc</u> takes a MIDI format file and converts it to something as close as possible to abc  text  format.
       The  user  then  has  to add text fields not present in the MIDI header and possibly tidy up the abc note
       output.

       The output of midi2abc is printed to the screen. To save it to a  file,  use  the  redirection  operator,
       (e.g. <u>midi2abc</u> <u>-f</u> <u>file.mid</u> <u>&gt;</u> <u>file.abc</u>) or specify the output file using the -o option.

       Use  only  one  or  none of the options -u -gu, -b and -Q. Midi2abc normally converts the MIDI time units
       into quantum units normally corresponding to the abc 1/16th note or 1/32nd note.  If  none  of  these  is
       present,  the program will use the PPQN information in the MIDI header to compute the suitable conversion
       factor. For most MIDI files on the web, it is recommended to rely on the MIDI header information and  not
       use any of the options other than the formatting options.

       The program will extract the time signature information from the MIDI file if it is present. Otherwise it
       will assume 4/4 or you could specify it with -m. option.

       If  the  tune  has  an  anacrusis,  you  can use either the -ga or -xa option to estimate the its length.
       Alternatively, you can specify its value using the -a option. The anacrusis is  specified  in  half  unit
       lengths,  where  the  unit  length is defined by the L: field. For example if L: 1/8, then a quarter note
       would be indicated by the value 4, (4 1/16 units).

   <b>OPTIONS</b>
       <b>-a</b> <u>acbeats</u>
              where acbeats specifies the anacrusis in half unit lengths.

       <b>-xa</b>    extract the anacrusis from file by finding the first strong note

       <b>-ga</b>    guess the anacrusis by minimizing the number of ties across bars

       <b>-m</b> <u>time</u> <u>signature</u>
              time signature

       <b>-b</b> <u>bars</u>
              number of bars wanted in output

       <b>-Q</b> <u>tempo</u>
              tempo in quarter-notes per minute

       <b>-u</b> <b>pulses</b>
              Allows you to specify directly the number of midi pulses per abc time unit.

       <b>-ppu</b> <b>parts</b> <b>per</b> <b>abc</b> <b>unit</b> <b>length</b>
              Normally, the smallest note unit that midi2abc can extract is half  the  L:  unit  length.This  is
              called  the  quantum  unit.   Thus for L: 1/8, midi2abc can extract 1/16 notes but not 1/32 notes.
              You can change this by specifying -ppu 4 for example. The number of parts should be a power of 2.

       <b>-aul</b> <b>denominator</b> <b>of</b> <b>abc</b> <b>unit</b> <b>length</b>
              Normally midi2abc chooses a unit length of 1/8 or 1/16 depending upon the time signature. For time
              signatures smaller than 3/4 the L: 1/16 is used and for larger time signatures L: 1/8 is used. You
              can specify the unit length to be used using this parameter. Thus -aul 32 will cause  midi2abc  to
              use a unit length of 1/32 nd note.

       <b>-gu</b>    Tells  midi2abc  to estimate the number of midi pulses per abc time unit from the note duration or
              spacing in the MIDI file.

       <b>-gk</b>    Tells midi2abc to guess the key signature by minimizing the number of accidentals even if the  key
              signature is already specified in the MIDI file. By default the key signature is the one specified
              in  the  MIDI  file.   If  it  is  not  specified,  then  the program guesses the key signature by
              minimizing accidentals.

       <b>-k</b> <u>key</u> key signature: -6 to 6 sharps.

       <b>-c</b> <u>channel</u>
              select only this midi channel.

       <b>-f</b> <u>infile</u>
              input file in midi format

       <b>-o</b> <u>output</u> <u>file</u>
              specifies the output abc file name.

       <b>-s</b>     do not discard very short notes.

       <b>-sr</b> <u>quantum</u> <u>units</u>
              do not notate a short rest smaller than the specified size after a note. If the size  (in  quantum
              units)  is zero, nothing is done. For larger values, the rest is absorbed into the preceding note.
              In other words, the preceding note is lengthened to include that rest.

       <b>-sum</b>   print a short summary of the input midi file.

       <b>-nb</b>    do not look for broken rhythms

       <b>-nt</b>    do not look for triplets

       <b>-obpl</b>  Print only one bar per line instead of 4. For complex music  this  improves  the  readability  and
              avoids some problems with some abc to postscript converters. This option is deprecated.

       <b>-nogr</b>  (No  note grouping.) Inserts a space between all notes. It makes a less pretty postscript file but
              it is easier to edit.

       <b>-bpl</b> <b>nbars</b>
              Print nbars of music on every line followed by a backslash.

       <b>-bps</b> <b>nbars</b>
              When nbars have been printed (including those lines joined by a backslash continuation)  go  to  a
              new line (with no backslash).

       <b>-splitvoices</b>
              This  parameter  handles  polyphonic  chords by splitting an entire voice into multiple voices. (A
              polyphonic chord is a chord composed of notes that  do  not  start  or  end  at  the  same  time.)
              Normally, midi2abc joins the longer notes to the notes in the following chord using ties.  Here is
              an  example:   [Bd-]d  [Bd-]d|. This should be separated into two voices ideally  Bz Bz and d2 d2.
              However, the separation is not unique. Bz d2 and d2 Bz are also ok.

       <b>-midigram</b>
              When this option appears, all other options are ignored and no abc file  is  produced.  Instead  a
              list  of  all notes in the MIDI file are printed in a fixed format. Each line represents a pair of
              MIDI note on/off event. The line contains the on/off time of the note, its track  number,  channel
              number,  midi  pitch and midi velocity. The last record indicates the duration of the MIDI file in
              MIDI pulse units. The output is designed to go into a graphical user interface which will  produce
              a graphical representation (piano roll).

       <b>-mftext</b>
              When  this  option  appears,  all other options are ignored and no abc file is produced. Instead a
              list of all the MIDI commands are printed. The output is designed to  go  into  a  graphical  user
              interface provided by runabc.tcl.

       <b>-mftextpulses</b>
              Same as -mftext except the time units is in midi pulses.

       <b>-title</b> <b>string</b>
              Replaces the default title field following T: with the given string.

       <b>-origin</b> <b>string</b>
              Adds an O: field with the given string.

       <b>-midinotes</b>
              Like -mftext, this option outputs the midi pitches present in the midi file, where middle C is 60,
              the  deviation of the note from the equal tempered scale in units of cents, and the pitch value in
              cents of the note relative to C. If the pitchbend  is  used,  then  its  value  follows  cents  in
              parentheses.  There are 100 cents in the semitone interval. Thus a pitch half way between C and C#
              would have a cent value of 50. There are 1200 cents in an octave, so the pitch value of D  natural
              would  be  200.  The  pitch  value of B natural is 1100. These values are useful for verifying the
              pitch values in an equaltempered scale divided into more than  12  tones.  The  pitch  values  are
              determined  from  the pitchbend value in the midi file, which is normally 8192.  However, for some
              midi players the pitch can also be altered using sysex (System Exclusive) messages. In particular,
              Jef Moine's abc2svg uses the latter rather than pitchbends  which  act  on  all  the  notes  in  a
              channel.

   <b>FEATURES</b>
       * The key is chosen so as to minimize the number of accidentals.  Alternatively, the user can specify the
       key  numerically  (a  positive  number  is the number of sharps, a negative number is minus the number of
       flats).

       * Note length can be set by specifying the total number of bars or the tempo of the piece.  Alternatively
       the  note length can be read from the file.  However, by default it is deduced in a heuristic manner from
       the inter-note distances.  This means that you do not have to use the MIDI  clock  as  a  metronome  when
       playing in a tune from a keyboard.

       *  Barlines are automatically inserted. The user specifies the number of measures in the anacrusis before
       the first barline and the time signature.

       * The program can guess how the length of the anacrusis, either by looking for the first strong  note  or
       minimizing the number of notes split by a tie across a barline.

       * Where a note extends beyond a bar break, it is split into two tied notes.

       * The output has 4 bars per line.

       * Enough accidental signs are put in the music to ensure that no pitch errors occur if a barline is added
       or deleted.

       * The program attempts to group notes sensibly in each bar.

       * Triplets and broken rhythm (a&gt;b) are supported.

       * Chords are identified.

       * Text information from the original MIDI file is included as comments.

       * The -c option can be used to select only 1 MIDI channel. Events on other channels are ignored.

   <b>LIMITATIONS</b>
       midi2abc does not ...

       *  Supply tune title, composer or any other field apart from X: , K:, Q:, M: and L: - these must be added
       by hand afterwards, though they may have been included in the text of the MIDI file.

       * Support duplets, quadruplets, other esoteric features.

       * Support mid-tune key or time signature changes.

       * Deduce repeats. The output is just the notes in the input file.

       * Recover an abc tune as supplied to abc2midi. However, if  you  want  to  do  this,  "midi2abc   -xa  -f
       file.mid" comes close.
