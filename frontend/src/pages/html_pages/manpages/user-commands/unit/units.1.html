</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>units</u> program converts quantities expressed in various systems of measurement to their equivalents in
       other  systems  of  measurement.  Like many similar programs, it can handle multiplicative scale changes.
       It can also handle nonlinear conversions such as Fahrenheit to Celsius; see <u>Temperature</u> <u>Conversions</u>.  The
       program can also perform conversions from and to sums of units, such as  converting  between  meters  and
       feet plus inches.

       But  Fahrenheit  to  Celsius  is  linear,  you  insist.   Not  so.   A  transformation  <u>T</u>  is  linear  if
       <u>T</u>(<u>x</u> + <u>y</u>) = <u>T</u>(<u>x</u>) + <u>T</u>(<u>y</u>) and this fails for <u>T</u>(<u>x</u>) = <u>ax</u> + <u>b</u>.  This transformation is affine, but not  linear—
       see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_map.

       Basic  operation is simple: you enter the units that you want to convert <u>from</u> and the units that you want
       to convert <u>to</u>.  You can use the program interactively with prompts, or you can use it  from  the  command
       line.

       Beyond  simple  unit conversions, <u>units</u> can be used as a general-purpose scientific calculator that keeps
       track of units in  its  calculations.   You  can  form  arbitrary  complex  mathematical  expressions  of
       dimensions  including  sums,  products,  quotients,  powers,  and even roots of dimensions.  Thus you can
       ensure accuracy and dimensional  consistency  when  working  with  long  expressions  that  involve  many
       different units that may combine in complex ways; for an illustration, see <u>Complicated</u> <u>Unit</u> <u>Expressions</u>.

       The  units  are  defined  in several external data files.  You can use the extensive data files that come
       with the program, or you can provide your own data file to suit your needs.  You can also  use  your  own
       data file to supplement the standard data files.

       You can change the default behavior of <u>units</u> with various options given on the command line. See <u>Invoking</u>
       <u>Units</u> for a description of the available options.

</pre><h4><b>ADDITIONAL</b> <b>DOCUMENTATION</b></h4><pre>
       This manual is also available in PDF and HTML:

          https://www.gnu.org/software/units/manual/units.html

<b>INTERACTING</b> <b>WITH</b> <u><b>UNITS</b></u>
       To  invoke  <u>units</u> for interactive use, type <u>units</u> at your shell prompt.  The program will print something
       like this:

       Currency exchange rates from FloatRates (USD base) on 2023-07-08
       3612 units, 109 prefixes, 122 nonlinear units
       You have:

       At the ‘You have:’ prompt, type the quantity and units that you are converting <u>from</u>.  For example, if you
       want to convert ten meters to feet, type <u>10</u> <u>meters</u>.  Next, <u>units</u> will print ‘You want:’.  You should type
       the units you want to convert <u>to</u>.  To convert to feet, you would type <u>feet</u>.  If the <u>readline</u> library  was
       compiled in, then <u>tab</u> will complete unit names. See <u>Readline</u> <u>Support</u> for more information about <u>readline</u>.
       To quit the program type <u>quit</u> or <u>exit</u> at either prompt.

       The  result  will  be  displayed  in  two  ways.  The first line of output, which is marked with a ‘*’ to
       indicate multiplication, gives the result of the conversion you have  asked  for.   The  second  line  of
       output,  which is marked with a ‘/’ to indicate division, gives the inverse of the conversion factor.  If
       you convert 10 meters to feet, <u>units</u> will print

           * 32.808399
           / 0.03048

       which tells you that 10 meters equals about 32.8 feet.  The second number gives  the  conversion  in  the
       opposite  direction.   In this case, it tells you that 1 foot is equal to about 0.03 dekameters since the
       dekameter is 10 meters.  It also tells you that 1/32.8 is about 0.03.

       The <u>units</u> program prints the inverse because sometimes it is a more convenient number.   In  the  example
       above,  for example, the inverse value is an exact conversion: a foot is exactly 0.03048 dekameters.  But
       the number given the other direction is inexact.

       If you convert grains to pounds, you will see the following:

       You have: grains
       You want: pounds
               * 0.00014285714
               / 7000

       From the second line of the output, you can immediately see that a grain is equal to a  seven  thousandth
       of  a  pound.   This  is not so obvious from the first line of the output.  If you find the output format
       confusing, try using the ‘--verbose’ option:

       You have: grain
       You want: aeginamina
               grain = 0.00010416667 aeginamina
               grain = (1 / 9600) aeginamina

       If you request a conversion between units that measure reciprocal dimensions, then <u>units</u> will display the
       conversion results with an extra note indicating that reciprocal conversion has been done:

       You have: 6 ohms
       You want: siemens
               reciprocal conversion
               * 0.16666667
               / 6

       Reciprocal conversion can be suppressed by using the ‘--strict’ option.  As usual,  use  the  ‘--verbose’
       option to get more comprehensible output:

       You have: tex
       You want: typp
               reciprocal conversion
               1 / tex = 496.05465 typp
               1 / tex = (1 / 0.0020159069) typp
       You have: 20 mph
       You want: sec/mile
               reciprocal conversion
               1 / 20 mph = 180 sec/mile
               1 / 20 mph = (1 / 0.0055555556) sec/mile

       If  you  enter  incompatible unit types, the <u>units</u> program will print a message indicating that the units
       are not conformable and it will display the reduced form for each unit:

       You have: ergs/hour
       You want: fathoms kg^2 / day
       conformability error
               2.7777778e-11 kg m^2 / sec^3
               2.1166667e-05 kg^2 m / sec

       If you only want to find the reduced form or definition of a unit, simply press <u>Enter</u> at the  ‘You want:’
       prompt.  Here is an example:

       You have: jansky
       You want:
               Definition: fluxunit = 1e-26 W/m^2 Hz = 1e-26 kg / s^2

       The  output  from  <u>units</u>  indicates that the jansky is defined to be equal to a fluxunit which in turn is
       defined to be a certain combination of watts, meters, and hertz.  The fully reduced  (and  in  this  case
       somewhat  more  cryptic) form appears on the far right.  If the ultimate definition and the fully reduced
       form are identical, the latter is not shown:

       You have: B
       You want:
               Definition: byte = 8 bit

       The fully reduced form <u>is</u> shown if it and the ultimate definition are equivalent but not identical:

       You have: N
       You want:
               Definition: newton = kg m / s^2 = 1 kg m / s^2

       Some named units are treated as dimensionless in some situations.  These units  include  the  radian  and
       steradian.   These  units  will  be treated as equal to 1 in units conversions.  Power is equal to torque
       times angular velocity.  This conversion can only be performed if the radian is dimensionless.

       You have: (14 ft lbf) (12 radians/sec)
       You want: watts
               * 227.77742
               / 0.0043902509

       It is also possible to compute roots and other non-integer powers of  dimensionless  units;  this  allows
       computations such as the altitude of geosynchronous orbit:

       You have: cuberoot(G earthmass / (circle/siderealday)^2) - earthradius
       You want: miles
               * 22243.267
               / 4.4957425e-05

       Named  dimensionless  units  are  not treated as dimensionless in other contexts.  They cannot be used as
       exponents so for example, ‘meter^radian’ is forbidden.

       If you want a list of options you can type <u>?</u> at the ‘You want:’ prompt.  The program will display a  list
       of  named  units  that  are  conformable  with the unit that you entered at the ‘You have:’ prompt above.
       Conformable unit <u>combinations</u> will not appear on this list.

       Typing <u>help</u> at either prompt displays a short help message.  You can also type <u>help</u> followed  by  a  unit
       name.   This will invoke a pager on the units data base at the point where that unit is defined.  You can
       read the definition and comments that may give more details or historical information about the unit.  If
       your pager allows, you may want to scroll backwards, e.g. with ‘b’, because sometimes  a  longer  comment
       about  a  unit  or  group  of units will appear before the definition.  You can generally quit out of the
       pager by pressing ‘q’.

       Typing <u>search</u> <u>text</u> will display a list of all of the units whose names contain <u>text</u> as a substring  along
       with their definitions.  This may help in the case where you aren't sure of the right unit name.

       Many  command-line  options  can be set by typing <u>set</u> <u>option=value</u>; typing <u>set</u> <u>option</u> will show the value
       for that option.  Typing <u>set</u> will show a list of options that can be  set;  options  set  to  other  than
       default values will have a prepended ‘*’.  See <u>Setting</u> <u>Options</u> <u>Interactively</u> for more information.

</pre><h4><b>USING</b> <u><b>UNITS</b></u> <b>NON-INTERACTIVELY</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>units</u>  program  can  perform units conversions non-interactively from the command line.  To do this,
       type the command, type the original unit expression, and type  the  new  units  you  want.   If  a  units
       expression  contains  non-alphanumeric  characters, you may need to protect it from interpretation by the
       shell using single or double quote characters.

       If you type

       units "2 liters" quarts

       then <u>units</u> will print

           * 2.1133764
           / 0.47317647

       and then exit.  The output tells you that 2 liters is about 2.1 quarts, or alternatively that a quart  is
       about 0.47 times 2 liters.

       <u>units</u>  does  not  require  a space between a numerical value and the unit, so the previous example can be
       given as

       units 2liters quarts

       to avoid having to quote the first argument.

       If the conversion is successful, <u>units</u> will return success (zero) to the  calling  environment.   If  you
       enter  non-conformable units, then <u>units</u> will print a message giving the reduced form of each unit and it
       will return failure (nonzero) to the calling environment.

       If the ‘--conformable’ option is given, only one unit expression is allowed, and  <u>units</u>  will  print  all
       units  conformable  with  that  expression;  it is equivalent to giving <u>?</u> at the ‘You want:’ prompt.  For
       example,

       units --conformable gauss
       B_FIELD   tesla
       Gs        gauss
       T         tesla
       gauss     abvolt sec / cm^2
       stT       stattesla
       statT     stattesla
       stattesla statWb/cm^2
       tesla     Wb/m^2

       If you give more than one unit expression with the ‘--conformable’ option, the program will exit with  an
       error message and return failure.  This option has no effect in interactive mode.

       If  the  ‘--terse’  (‘-t’)  option  is given with the ‘--conformable’ option, conformable units are shown
       without definitions; with the previous example, this would give

       units --terse --conformable gauss
       B_FIELD
       Gs
       T
       gauss
       stT
       statT
       stattesla
       tesla

       When the ‘--conformable’ option is not given and you invoke <u>units</u> with  only  one  argument,  <u>units</u>  will
       print  the  definition  of  the  specified  unit.   It will return failure if the unit is not defined and
       success if the unit is defined.

</pre><h4><b>UNIT</b> <b>DEFINITIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The conversion information is read from several units data files: ‘definitions.units’,  ‘elements.units’,
       ‘currency.units’, and ‘cpi.units’, which are usually located in the ‘/usr/share/units’ directory.  If you
       invoke  <u>units</u>  with  the  ‘-V’  option, it will print the location of these files.  The default main file
       includes definitions for all familiar units, abbreviations and metric prefixes.  It  also  includes  many
       obscure or archaic units.  Many common spelled-out numbers (e.g., ‘seventeen’) are recognized.

   <b>Physical</b> <b>Constants</b>
       Many constants of nature are defined, including these:

       pi          ratio of circumference of a circle to its diameter
       c           speed of light
       e           charge on an electron
       force       acceleration of gravity
       mole        Avogadro's number
       water       pressure per unit height of water
       Hg          pressure per unit height of mercury
       au          astronomical unit
       k           Boltzman's constant
       mu0         permeability of vacuum
       epsilon0    permittivity of vacuum
       G           Gravitational constant
       mach        speed of sound

       The  standard  data  file  includes numerous other constants.  Also included are the densities of various
       ingredients used in baking so that ‘2 cups flour_sifted’ can be converted to ‘grams’.   This  is  not  an
       exhaustive  list.   Consult  the units data file to see the complete list, or to see the definitions that
       are used.

   <b>Atomic</b> <b>Masses</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Elements</b>
       The data file ‘elements.units’ includes atomic masses for most elements and most known isotopes.  If  the
       mole  fractions  of  constituent  isotopes are known, an elemental mass is calculated from the sum of the
       products of the mole fractions and the masses of the constituent isotopes.  If the mole fractions are not
       known, the mass of the most stable isotope—if known—is given as  the  elemental  mass.   For  radioactive
       elements  with atomic numbers 95 or greater, the mass number of the most stable isotope is not specified,
       because the list of studied isotopes is still incomplete.  If no stable isotope is  known,  no  elemental
       mass is given, and you will need to choose the most appropriate isotope.

       The   data   are   obtained  from  the  US  National  Institute  for  Standards  and  Technology  (NIST):
       https://physics.nist.gov/cgi-bin/Compositions/stand_alone.pl?ele=&amp;all=all&amp;ascii=ascii2&amp;isotype=all.   The
       ‘elements.units’  file  can  be  generated  from  these  data using the <u>elemcvt</u> command included with the
       distribution.

   <b>Currency</b> <b>Exchange</b> <b>Rates</b> <b>and</b> <b>Consumer</b> <b>Price</b> <b>Index</b>
       The data file ‘currency.units’ includes currency conversion rates; the file ‘cpi.units’ includes  the  US
       Consumer Price Index (CPI), published by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics.  The data are updated monthly
       by the BLS; see <u>Updating</u> <u>Currency</u> <u>Exchange</u> <u>Rates</u> <u>and</u> <u>CPI</u> for information on updating ‘currency.units’ and
       ‘cpi.units’.

   <b>English</b> <b>Customary</b> <b>Units</b>
       English  customary  units differ in various ways among different regions.  In Britain a complex system of
       volume measurements featured different gallons for different materials such as  a  wine  gallon  and  ale
       gallon that different by twenty percent.  This complexity was swept away in 1824 by a reform that created
       an  entirely  new  gallon,  the  British  Imperial gallon defined as the volume occupied by ten pounds of
       water.  Meanwhile in the USA the gallon is derived from the 1707 Winchester wine  gallon,  which  is  231
       cubic  inches.   These  gallons  differ by about twenty percent.  By default if <u>units</u> runs in the ‘en_GB’
       locale you will get the British volume measures.  If it runs in the ‘en_US’ locale you will  get  the  US
       volume  measures.   In  other  locales  the  default values are the US definitions.  If you wish to force
       different definitions, then set the environment variable UNITS_ENGLISH to either ‘US’ or ‘GB’ to set  the
       desired definitions independent of the locale.

       Before  1959,  the  value of a yard (and other units of measure defined in terms of it) differed slightly
       among English-speaking countries.  In 1959, Australia, Canada,  New  Zealand,  the  United  Kingdom,  the
       United  States,  and  South  Africa  adopted the Canadian value of 1 yard = 0.9144 m (exactly), which was
       approximately halfway between the values used by the UK and the US; it had the  additional  advantage  of
       making  1 inch  =  2.54 cm  (exactly).   This new standard was termed the <u>International</u> <u>Yard</u>.  Australia,
       Canada, and the UK then defined all customary lengths in terms of the International Yard  (Australia  did
       not  define the furlong or rod); because many US land surveys were in terms of the pre-1959 units, the US
       continued to define customary surveyors' units (furlong, chain, rod, pole, perch, and link) in  terms  of
       the previous value for the foot, which was termed the <u>US</u> <u>survey</u> <u>foot</u>.  The US defined a <u>US</u> <u>survey</u> <u>mile</u> as
       5280  US  survey  feet,  and  defined  a <u>statute</u> <u>mile</u> as a US survey mile.  The US values for these units
       differed from the international values by about 2 ppm.

       The 1959 redefinition of the foot was legally binding in the US but allowed continued use of the previous
       definition of the foot for geodetic surveying.  It was assumed that this use would be temporary, but  use
       persisted,  leading  to  confusion  and  errors, and it was at odds with the intent of uniform standards.
       Since January 1, 2023, the US survey foot has been officially deprecated (85  FR  62698),  with  its  use
       limited to historical and legacy applications.

       The  <u>units</u>  program has always used the international values for these units; the legacy US values can be
       obtained by using either the  ‘US’  or  the  ‘survey’  prefix.   In  either  case,  the  simple  familiar
       relationships  among  the  units  are  maintained,  e.g., 1 ‘furlong’ = 660 ‘ft’, and 1 ‘USfurlong’ = 660
       ‘USft’, though the metric equivalents differ slightly between the two cases.   The  ‘US’  prefix  or  the
       ‘survey’ prefix can also be used to obtain the US survey mile and the value of the US yard prior to 1959,
       e.g.,  ‘USmile’  or  ‘surveymile’ (but <u>not</u> ‘USsurveymile’).  To get the US value of the statute mile, use
       either ‘USstatutemile’ or ‘USmile’.  The pre-1959 UK values for these units  can  be  obtained  with  the
       prefix ‘UK’.

       Except  for  distances  that  extend  over  hundreds  of  miles (such as in the US State Plane Coordinate
       System), the differences in the miles are usually insignificant:

       You have: 100 surveymile - 100 mile
       You want: inch
               * 12.672025
               / 0.078913984

       The US acre was officially defined in terms of the US survey foot, but <u>units</u> has used a definition  based
       on  the  international  foot; the <u>units</u> definition is now the same as the official US value.  If you want
       the previous US acre, use ‘USacre’ and similarly use ‘USacrefoot’ for the previous  US  version  of  that
       unit.  The difference between these units is about 4 parts per million.

   <b>Miscellaneous</b> <b>Notes</b> <b>on</b> <b>Unit</b> <b>Definitions</b>
       The  ‘pound’  is  a unit of mass.  To get force, multiply by the force conversion unit ‘force’ or use the
       shorthand ‘lbf’.  (Note that ‘g’ is already taken as the standard abbreviation for the gram.)   The  unit
       ‘ounce’  is also a unit of mass.  The fluid ounce is ‘fluidounce’ or ‘floz’.  When British capacity units
       differ from their US counterparts, such as the British Imperial gallon, the unit  is  defined  both  ways
       with  ‘br’  and  ‘us’  prefixes.   Your  locale settings will determine the value of the unprefixed unit.
       Currency is prefixed with its country name: ‘belgiumfranc’, ‘britainpound’.

       When searching for a unit, if the specified string does not appear exactly as a unit name, then the <u>units</u>
       program will try to remove a trailing ‘s’, ‘es’.  Next units will replace a trailing ‘ies’ with ‘y’.   If
       that  fails,  <u>units</u>  will check for a prefix.  The database includes all of the standard metric prefixes.
       Only one prefix is permitted per unit, so ‘micromicrofarad’ will  fail.   However,  prefixes  can  appear
       alone with no unit following them, so ‘micro*microfarad’ will work, as will ‘micro microfarad’.

       To find out which units and prefixes are available, read the default units data files; the main data file
       is extensively annotated.

   <b>Operators</b>
       You can enter more complicated units by combining units with operations such as multiplication, division,
       powers, addition, subtraction, and parentheses for grouping.  You can use the customary symbols for these
       operators  when <u>units</u> is invoked with its default options.  Additionally, <u>units</u> supports some extensions,
       including high priority multiplication using a space, and a high  priority  numerical  division  operator
       (‘|’) that can simplify some expressions.

       You multiply units using a space or an asterisk (‘*’).  The next example shows both forms:

       You have: arabicfoot * arabictradepound * force
       You want: ft lbf
               * 0.7296
               / 1.370614

       You can divide units using the slash (‘/’) or with ‘per’:

       You have: furlongs per fortnight
       You want: m/s
               * 0.00016630986
               / 6012.8727

       You can use parentheses for grouping:

       You have: (1/2) kg / (kg/meter)
       You want: league
               * 0.00010356166
               / 9656.0833

       White   space   surrounding   operators   is   optional,   so   the  previous  example  could  have  used
       ‘(1/2)kg/(kg/meter)’.  As a consequence, however,  hyphenated  spelled-out  numbers  (e.g.,  ‘forty-two’)
       cannot be used; ‘forty-two’ is interpreted as ‘40 - 2’.

       Multiplication using a space has a higher precedence than division using a slash and is evaluated left to
       right;  in  effect,  the first ‘/’ character marks the beginning of the denominator of a unit expression.
       This makes it simple to enter a quotient with several terms in the denominator: ‘J / mol K’.  The ‘*’ and
       ‘/’ operators have the same precedence, and are evaluated left to right; if you multiply  with  ‘*’,  you
       must group the terms in the denominator with parentheses: ‘J / (mol * K)’.

       The  higher precedence of the space operator may not always be advantageous.  For example, ‘m/s s/day’ is
       equivalent to ‘m / s s day’ and has dimensions of length per time cubed.  Similarly,  ‘1/2 meter’  refers
       to  a unit of reciprocal length equivalent to 0.5/meter, perhaps not what you would intend if you entered
       that expression.  The get a half meter you  would  need  to  use  parentheses:  ‘(1/2) meter’.   The  ‘*’
       operator is convenient for multiplying a sequence of quotients.  For example, ‘m/s * s/day’ is equivalent
       to ‘m/day’.  Similarly, you could write ‘1/2 * meter’ to get half a meter.

       The  <u>units</u>  program supports another option for numerical fractions: you can indicate division of <u>numbers</u>
       with the vertical bar (‘|’), so if you wanted half a meter you could write ‘1|2 meter’.  You  cannot  use
       the vertical bar to indicate division of non-numerical units (e.g., ‘m|s’ results in an error message).

       Powers of units can be specified using the ‘^’ character, as shown in the following example, or by simple
       concatenation of a unit and its exponent: ‘cm3’ is equivalent to ‘cm^3’; if the exponent is more than one
       digit, the ‘^’ is required.  You can also use ‘**’ as an exponent operator.

       You have: cm^3
       You want: gallons
               * 0.00026417205
               / 3785.4118

       Concatenation  only  works  with  a  single  unit  name:  if  you  write ‘(m/s)2’, <u>units</u> will treat it as
       multiplication by 2.  When a unit includes a prefix, exponent operators  apply  to  the  combination,  so
       ‘centimeter3’  gives cubic centimeters.  If you separate the prefix from the unit with any multiplication
       operator (e.g., ‘centi meter^3’), the prefix is treated as a separate unit, so the exponent applies  only
       to  the  unit  without  the prefix.  The second example is equivalent to ‘centi * (meter^3)’, and gives a
       hundredth of a cubic meter, not a cubic centimeter.  The <u>units</u> program is limited internally to  products
       of  99  units;  accordingly,  expressions  like  ‘meter^100’  or  ‘joule^34’  (represented  internally as
       ‘kg^34 m^68 / s^68’) will fail.

       The ‘|’ operator has the highest precedence, so you can write the square root of two thirds as ‘2|3^1|2’.
       The ‘^’ operator has the second highest precedence, and is evaluated right to left, as usual:

       You have: 5 * 2^3^2
       You want:
               Definition: 2560

       With a dimensionless base unit, any dimensionless exponent is meaningful (e.g.,  ‘pi^exp(2.371)’).   Even
       though angle is sometimes treated as dimensionless, exponents cannot have dimensions of angle:

       You have: 2^radian
                        ^
       Exponent not dimensionless

       If  the  base unit is not dimensionless, the exponent must be a rational number <u>p</u>/<u>q</u>, and the dimension of
       the unit must be a power of <u>q</u>, so ‘gallon^2|3’ works but ‘acre^2|3’ fails.  An exponent using  the  slash
       (‘/’)  operator  (e.g.,  ‘gallon^(2/3)’)  is  also  acceptable;  the  parentheses  are needed because the
       precedence of ‘^’ is higher than that of ‘/’.  Since <u>units</u> cannot  represent  dimensions  with  exponents
       greater  than 99, a fully reduced exponent must have <u>q</u> &lt; 100.  When raising a non-dimensionless unit to a
       power, <u>units</u> attempts to convert a decimal exponent to a rational number with <u>q</u> &lt; 100.  If  this  is  not
       possible <u>units</u> displays an error message:

       You have: ft^1.234
       Base unit not dimensionless; rational exponent required

       A  decimal  exponent must match its rational representation to machine precision, so ‘acre^1.5’ works but
       ‘gallon^0.666’ does not.

   <b>Sums</b> <b>and</b> <b>Differences</b> <b>of</b> <b>Units</b>
       You may sometimes want to add values of different units that are outside the SI.  You may  also  wish  to
       use  <u>units</u> as a calculator that keeps track of units.  Sums of conformable units are written with the ‘+’
       character, and differences with the ‘-’ character.

       You have: 2 hours + 23 minutes + 32 seconds
       You want: seconds
               * 8612
               / 0.00011611705

       You have: 12 ft + 3 in
       You want: cm
               * 373.38
               / 0.0026782366

       You have: 2 btu + 450 ft lbf
       You want: btu
               * 2.5782804
               / 0.38785542

       The expressions that are added or subtracted must reduce to identical expressions in primitive units,  or
       an error message will be displayed:

       You have: 12 printerspoint - 4 heredium
                                             ^
       Invalid sum of non-conformable units

       If  you add two values of vastly different scale you may exceed the available precision of floating point
       (about 15 digits). The effect is that the addition of the smaller value makes no  change  to  the  larger
       value; in other words, the smaller value is treated as if it were zero.

       You have: lightyear + cm

       No  warning  is given, however.  As usual, the precedence for ‘+’ and ‘-’ is lower than that of the other
       operators.  A fractional quantity such as 2 1/2 cups can be given as ‘(2+1|2) cups’; the parentheses  are
       necessary because multiplication has higher precedence than addition.  If you omit the parentheses, <u>units</u>
       attempts to add ‘2’ and ‘1|2 cups’, and you get an error message:

       You have: 2+1|2 cups
                          ^
       Invalid sum or difference of non-conformable units

       The expression could also be correctly written as ‘(2+1/2) cups’.  If you write ‘2 1|2 cups’ the space is
       interpreted as <u>multiplication</u> so the result is the same as ‘1 cup’.

       The  ‘+’ and ‘-’ characters sometimes appears in exponents like ‘3.43e+8’.  This leads to an ambiguity in
       an expression like ‘3e+2 yC’.  The unit ‘e’ is a small unit  of  charge,  so  this  can  be  regarded  as
       equivalent  to  ‘(3e+2) yC’ or ‘(3 e)+(2 yC)’.  This ambiguity is resolved by always interpreting ‘+’ and
       ‘-’ as part of an exponent if possible.

   <b>Numbers</b> <b>as</b> <b>Units</b>
       For <u>units</u>, numbers are just another kind of unit.  They can appear as many times as you like and  in  any
       order  in  a  unit expression.  For example, to find the volume of a box that is 2 ft by 3 ft by 12 ft in
       steres, you could do the following:

       You have: 2 ft 3 ft 12 ft
       You want: stere
               * 2.038813
               / 0.49048148
       You have: $ 5 / yard
       You want: cents / inch
               * 13.888889
               / 0.072

       And the second example shows how the dollar sign in the  units  conversion  can  precede  the  five.   Be
       careful:  <u>units</u> will interpret ‘$5’ with no space as equivalent to ‘dollar^5’.

   <b>Built-in</b> <b>Functions</b>
       Several  built-in  functions  are  provided: ‘sin’, ‘cos’, ‘tan’, ‘asin’, ‘acos’, ‘atan’, ‘sinh’, ‘cosh’,
       ‘tanh’, ‘asinh’, ‘acosh’, ‘atanh’, ‘exp’, ‘ln’, ‘log’,  ‘abs’,  ‘round’,  ‘floor’,  ‘ceil’,  ‘factorial’,
       ‘Gamma’,  ‘lnGamma’,  ‘erf’,  and  ‘erfc’; the function ‘lnGamma’ is the natural logarithm of the ‘Gamma’
       function.

       The ‘sin’, ‘cos’, and ‘tan’ functions require  either  a  dimensionless  argument  or  an  argument  with
       dimensions of angle.

       You have: sin(30 degrees)
       You want:
               Definition: 0.5
       You have: sin(pi/2)
       You want:
               Definition: 1
       You have: sin(3 kg)
                         ^
       Unit not dimensionless

       The  other  functions  on  the list require dimensionless arguments.  The inverse trigonometric functions
       return arguments with dimensions of angle.

       The ‘ln’ and ‘log’ functions give natural log and log base 10  respectively.   To  obtain  logs  for  any
       integer  base,  enter the desired base immediately after ‘log’.  For example, to get log base 2 you would
       write ‘log2’ and to get log base 47 you could write ‘log47’.

       You have: <a href="../man32/log2.32.html">log2</a>(32)
       You want:

       You want:
               Definition: 1.50515

       If you wish to take roots of units, you may use the ‘sqrt’  or  ‘cuberoot’  functions.   These  functions
       require  that  the  argument  have the appropriate root.  You can obtain higher roots by using fractional
       exponents:

       You have: sqrt(acre)
       You want: feet
               * 208.71074
               / 0.0047913202
       You have: (400 W/m^2 / stefanboltzmann)^(1/4)
       You have:
               Definition: 289.80882 K
       You have: cuberoot(hectare)
                                 ^
       Unit not a root

   <b>Previous</b> <b>Result</b>
       You can insert the result of the previous conversion using the underscore (‘_’).  It is useful  when  you
       want to convert the same input to several different units, for example

       You have: 2.3 tonrefrigeration
       You want: btu/hr
               * 27600
               / 3.6231884e-005
       You have: _
       You want: kW
               * 8.0887615
               / 0.12362832

       Suppose  you  want to do some deep frying that requires an oil depth of 2 inches.  You have 1/2 gallon of
       oil, and want to know the largest-diameter pan that will maintain the required depth.  The nonlinear unit
       ‘circlearea’ gives the <u>radius</u> of the circle (see <u>Other</u> <u>Nonlinear</u> <u>Units</u>, for a more detailed  description)
       in SI units; you want the <u>diameter</u> in <u>inches</u>:

       You have: 1|2 gallon / 2 in
       You want: circlearea
               0.10890173 m
       You have: 2 _
       You want: in
               * 8.5749393
               / 0.1166189

       In most cases, surrounding white space is optional, so the previous example could have used ‘2_’.  If ‘_’
       follows a non-numerical unit symbol, however, the space is required:

       You have: m_
                  ^
       Parse error

       You can use the ‘_’ symbol any number of times; for example,

       You have: m
       You want:
               Definition: 1 m
       You have: _ _
       You want:
               Definition: 1 m^2

       Using ‘_’ before a conversion has been performed (e.g., immediately after invocation) generates an error:

       You have: _
                 ^
       No previous result; '_' not set

       Accordingly, ‘_’ serves no purpose when <u>units</u> is invoked non-interactively.

       If <u>units</u> is invoked with the ‘--verbose’ option (see <u>Invoking</u> <u>Units</u>), the value of ‘_’ is not expanded:

       You have: mile
       You want: ft
               mile = 5280 ft
               mile = (1 / 0.00018939394) ft
       You have: _
       You want: m
               _ = 1609.344 m
               _ = (1 / 0.00062137119) m

       You can give ‘_’ at the ‘You want:’ prompt, but it usually is not very useful.

   <b>Complicated</b> <b>Unit</b> <b>Expressions</b>
       The  <u>units</u> program is especially helpful in ensuring accuracy and dimensional consistency when converting
       lengthy unit expressions.  For example, one form of the Darcy-Weisbach fluid-flow equation is

            Delta <u>P</u> = (8 / pi)^2 (<u>rho</u> <u>fLQ</u>^2) / <u>d</u>^5,

       where Delta <u>P</u> is the pressure drop, <u>rho</u> is the mass density, <u>f</u> is the (dimensionless) friction factor,  <u>L</u>
       is  the length of the pipe, <u>Q</u> is the volumetric flow rate, and <u>d</u> is the pipe diameter.  You might want to
       have the equation in the form

            Delta <u>P</u> = A1 <u>rho</u> <u>fLQ</u>^2 / <u>d</u>^5

       that accepted the user’s normal units; for typical units used in the US, the required conversion could be
       something like

       You have: (8/pi^2)(lbm/ft^3)ft(ft^3/s)^2(1/in^5)
       You want: psi
               * 43.533969
               / 0.022970568

       The parentheses allow individual terms in the expression to be entered naturally, as they might  be  read
       from the formula.  Alternatively, the multiplication could be done with the ‘*’ rather than a space; then
       parentheses are needed only around ‘ft^3/s’ because of its exponent:

       You have: 8/pi^2 * lbm/ft^3 * ft * (ft^3/s)^2 /in^5
       You want: psi
               * 43.533969
               / 0.022970568

       Without  parentheses,  and  using  spaces  for  multiplication,  the previous conversion would need to be
       entered as

       You have: 8 lb ft ft^3 ft^3 / pi^2 ft^3 s^2 in^5
       You want: psi
               * 43.533969
               / 0.022970568

   <b>Variables</b> <b>Assigned</b> <b>at</b> <b>Run</b> <b>Time</b>
       Unit definitions are fixed once <u>units</u> has finished reading the units data file(s), but at  run  time  you
       can assign unit expressions to variables whose names begin with an underscore, using the syntax

       _<u>name</u> = <u>&lt;unit</u> <u>expression&gt;</u>

       This  can  help manage a long calculation by saving intermediate quantities as variables that you can use
       later.  For example, to determine the shot-noise-limited signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of an imaging system
       using a helium–neon laser, you could do

       You have: _lambda = 632.8 nm            # laser wavelength
       You have: _nu = c / _lambda             # optical frequency
       You have: _photon_energy = h * _nu
       You have: _power = 550 uW
       You have: _photon_count = _power * 500 ns / _photon_energy
       You have: _snr = sqrt(_photon_count)
       You have: _snr
       You want:
               Definition: sqrt(_photon_count) = 29597.922

       Except for beginning with an underscore, runtime  variables  follow  the  same  naming  rules  as  units.
       Because  names  beginning with ‘_’ are reserved for these variables and unit names cannot begin with ‘_’,
       runtime variables can never hide unit definitions.  Runtime variables are undefined  until  you  make  an
       assignment  to  them, so if you give a name beginning with an underscore and no assignment has been made,
       you get an error message.

       When you assign a unit expression to a runtime variable, <u>units</u> checks the expression to determine whether
       it is valid, but the resulting definition is stored as a text string that is  not  reduced  to  primitive
       units.   The  text  will be processed anew each time you use the variable in a conversion or calculation;
       this means that if your definition depends on other runtime variables (or the special variable ‘_’),  the
       result of calculating with your variable will change if any of those variables change.  A dependence need
       not be direct.

       Continuing  the  example  of  the  laser  above, suppose you have done the calculation as shown.  You now
       wonder what happens if you switch to an argon laser:

       You have: _lambda = 454.6 nm
       You have: _snr
       You want:
               Definition: sqrt(_photon_count) = 25086.651

       If you then change the power:

       You have: _power = 1 mW
       You have: _snr
       You want:
               Definition: sqrt(_photon_count) = 33826.834

       Instead of having to reenter or edit a lengthy expression when you perform another calculation, you  need
       only enter values that change; in this respect, runtime variables are similar to a spreadsheet.

       The  more times a variable appears in an expression that depends on it, the greater the benefit of having
       a calculation using that expression reflect changes  to  that  variable.   For  example,  the  length  of
       daylight—the time the Sun is above the horizon—at a given latitude and declination of the Sun is given by

            <u>L</u> = acos((sin <u>h</u> - sin <u>ϕ</u> sin <u>δ</u>) /
                           (cos <u>ϕ</u> cos <u>δ</u>))

       where <u>L</u> is the day length, <u>h</u> is the altitude, <u>ϕ</u> is the latitude, and <u>δ</u> is the Sun’s declination.

       The result above is in sidereal time; the length in solar time is obtained by multiplying by

       siderealday / day

       By  convention,  the  Sun’s  altitude  at rise or set is -50′ to allow for atmospheric refraction and the
       semidiameter of its disk.  At the summer solstice in the northern hemisphere, the  Sun’s  declination  is
       approximately  23.44°; to find the length of the longest day of the year for a latitude of 55°, you could
       do

       You have: _alt = -50 arcmin
       You have: _lat = 55 deg
       You have: _decl = 23.44 deg
       You have: _num = sin(_alt) - sin(_lat) sin(_decl)
       You have: _denom = cos(_lat) cos(_decl)
       You have: _sday = 2 (acos(_num / _denom) / circle) 24 hr
       You have: _day = _sday siderealday / day
       You have: _day
       You want: hms
               17 hr + 19 min + 34.895151 sec

       At the winter solstice, the Sun’s declination is approximately -23.44°, so you could calculate the length
       of the shortest day of the year using:

       You have: _decl = -23.44 deg
       You have: _day
       You want: hms
               7 hr + 8 min + 40.981084 sec

       Latitude and declination each appear twice in the expression for _day; the result in the  examples  above
       is updated by changing only the value of the declination.

       It  may seem easier—and less subject to error—to simply specify the new value of _decl as the negative of
       the current value (e.g., ‘_decl = -_decl’).  This doesn’t work; when you make an assignment with the  ‘=’
       operator,  the definition is stored as entered, including possible dependencies on variables.  But if you
       attempt an assignment that is ultimately self-referential, the current definition is  retained,  and  you
       get an error message.  For example,

       You have: _decl = 23.44 deg
       You have: _decl = -_decl
       Circular unit definition

       You  can  overcome  this by using the ‘:=’ operator, which reduces the right hand side to primitive units
       before making the assignment, eliminating any dependencies on variables.  Returning to the example above,

       You have: _decl = 23.44 deg
       You have: _decl = -_decl
       Circular unit definition
       You have: _decl := -_decl
       You have: _decl
       You want: deg
               * -23.44
               / -0.042662116

       This works to much the same effect as if the assignment had been entered literally, e.g.,

       You have: _decl = -23.44 deg

       but the actual definition is in primitive units—in this case, radians:

       You have: _decl = 23.44 deg
       You have: _decl := -_decl
       You have: _decl
       You want:
               Definition: -0.40910517666747087 radian = -0.40910518 radian

       Definitions are text strings, and a redefinition using ‘:=’ is given with enough digits maintain the full
       precision of the current definition when converted back to a number; because it is a string,  all  digits
       are  displayed when showing the definition, regardless of the numerical display precision, so you may see
       more digits than expected.

       A runtime variable must be assigned before it can be used in an assignment; in the  first  of  the  three
       examples above, giving the general equation before the values for _alt, _lat, and _decl had been assigned
       would result in an error message.

   <b>Backwards</b> <b>Compatibility:</b> <b>‘</b>*’ and ‘-’
       The  original  <u>units</u>  assigned  multiplication  a  higher precedence than division using the slash.  This
       differs from the usual precedence rules, which give multiplication and division equal precedence, and can
       be confusing for people who think of units as a calculator.

       The star operator (‘*’) included in this <u>units</u> program has, by default, the same precedence as  division,
       and  hence follows the usual precedence rules.  For backwards compatibility you can invoke <u>units</u> with the
       ‘--oldstar’ option.  Then ‘*’ has  a  higher  precedence  than  division,  and  the  same  precedence  as
       multiplication using the space.

       Historically, the hyphen (‘-’) has been used in technical publications to indicate products of units, and
       the original <u>units</u> program treated it as a multiplication operator.  Because <u>units</u> provides several other
       ways to obtain unit products, and because ‘-’ is a subtraction operator in general algebraic expressions,
       <u>units</u>  treats  the  binary ‘-’ as a subtraction operator by default.  For backwards compatibility use the
       ‘--product’ option, which causes <u>units</u> to treat the binary ‘-’ operator as a product operator.  When  ‘-’
       is  a  multiplication  operator  it  has  the same precedence as multiplication with a space, giving it a
       higher precedence than division.

       When ‘-’ is used as a unary operator it negates its operand.  Regardless of the  <u>units</u>  options,  if  ‘-’
       appears  after  ‘(’  or after ‘+’, then it will act as a negation operator.  So you can always compute 20
       degrees minus 12 minutes by entering ‘20 degrees + -12 arcmin’.  You must use this construction when  you
       define new units because you cannot know what options will be in force when your definition is processed.

</pre><h4><b>NONLINEAR</b> <b>UNIT</b> <b>CONVERSIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Nonlinear units are represented using functional notation.  They make possible nonlinear unit conversions
       such as temperature.

   <b>Temperature</b> <b>Conversions</b>
       Conversions between temperatures are different from linear conversions between temperature <u>increments</u>—see
       the  example  below.  The absolute temperature conversions are handled by units starting with ‘temp’, and
       you must use functional notation.  The temperature-increment conversions are done  using  units  starting
       with ‘deg’ and they do not require functional notation.

       You have: <a href="../man45/tempF.45.html">tempF</a>(45)
       You want: tempC
               7.2222222
       You have: 45 degF
       You want: degC
               * 25
               / 0.04

       Think  of  ‘tempF(<u>x</u>)’  not  as  a  function  but as a notation that indicates that <u>x</u> should have units of
       ‘tempF’ attached to it.  See <u>Defining</u> <u>Nonlinear</u> <u>Units</u>.  The  first  conversion  shows  that  if  it’s  45
       degrees  Fahrenheit  outside, it’s 7.2 degrees Celsius.  The second conversion indicates that a change of
       45 degrees Fahrenheit corresponds to a change of 25 degrees Celsius.  The conversion from  ‘tempF(<u>x</u>)’  is
       to absolute temperature, so that

       You have: <a href="../man45/tempF.45.html">tempF</a>(45)
       You want: degR
               * 504.67
               / 0.0019814929

       gives the same result as

       You have: <a href="../man45/tempF.45.html">tempF</a>(45)
       You want: tempR
               * 504.67
               / 0.0019814929

       But if you convert ‘tempF(<u>x</u>)’ to ‘degC’, the output is probably not what you expect:

       You have: <a href="../man45/tempF.45.html">tempF</a>(45)
       You want: degC
               * 280.37222
               / 0.0035666871

       The result is the temperature in K, because ‘degC’ is defined as ‘K’, the kelvin. For consistent results,
       use the ‘temp<u>X</u>’ units when converting to a temperature rather than converting a temperature increment.

       The ‘tempC()’ and ‘tempF()’ definitions are limited to positive absolute temperatures, and giving a value
       that would result in a negative absolute temperature generates an error message:

       You have: tempC(-275)
                           ^
       Argument of function outside domain

   <b>US</b> <b>Consumer</b> <b>Price</b> <b>Index</b>
       <u>units</u>  includes  the  US  Consumer  Price  Index published by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics.  Several
       functions that use this value are provided: ‘cpi’, ‘cpi_now’, ‘inflation_since’, and ‘dollars_in’.

       The ‘cpi’ function gives the CPI for a specified decimal year.  A <u>decimal</u> <u>year</u> is given as the year  plus
       the  fractional  part of the year; because of leap years and the different lengths of months, calculating
       an exact value for the fractional part can be tedious, but for the purposes of CPI, an approximate  value
       is  usually  adequate.   For  example,  1 January 2000 is 2000.0, 1 April 2000 is 2000.25, 1 July 2000 is
       2000.4986, and 1 October 2000 is 2000.75.  Note also that the CPI data update monthly; values in  between
       months are linearly interpolated.

       In the middle of 1975, the CPI was

       You have: cpi(1975.5)
       You want:
               Definition: 53.6

       The  value  of  the  CPI  for  a month is usually published sometime around the 20th day of the following
       month; the latest value of the CPI is available with ‘cpi_now’.  On 7 January 2024, the value was

       You have: cpi_now
       You want:
               Definition: UScpi_now = 307.051

       This means that the CPI was 307.015 on 1 December 2023.  The ‘cpi_now’ variable can only present the most
       recent data available, so it can lag the current CPI by several weeks.  The  decimal  year  of  the  last
       update is available with ‘cpi_lastdate’.

       The  ‘inflation_since’  function  provides  a  convenient  way  to  determine the inflation factor from a
       specified decimal year to the latest value in the CPI table.  For example, on 7 January 2024:

       You have: <a href="../man1970/inflation_since.1970.html">inflation_since</a>(1970)
       You want:
               Definition: 8.1445889

       In other words, goods that cost 1 US$ in 1970 would cost 8.14 US$ on 1 December 2023.

       The ‘inflation_since’ function can be used to determine an annual rate of inflation.  The earliest US CPI
       data are from about 1913.1; the approximate time between then and 7 January 2024  is  110.9  years.   The
       approximate annual inflation rate for that period is then

       You have: inflation_since(1913.1)^1|110.9 - 1
       You want: %
               * 3.1548115
               / 0.31697614

       The inflation rate for any time period can be found from the ratio of the CPI at the end of the period to
       that of the beginning:

       You have: (<a href="../man1982/cpi.1982.html">cpi</a>(1982)/<a href="../man1972/cpi.1972.html">cpi</a>(1972))^1|10 - 1
       You want: %
               * 8.6247033
               / 0.11594602

       The period 1972–1982 was indeed one of high inflation.

       The  ‘dollars_in’  function  is  similar  to  ‘inflation_since’  but  its  output  is  in US$ rather than
       dimensionless:

       You have: <a href="../man1970/dollars_in.1970.html">dollars_in</a>(1970)
       You want:
               Definition: 8.1445889 US$

       A typical use might be

       You have: 250 <a href="../man1970/dollars_in.1970.html">dollars_in</a>(1970)
       You want: $
               * 2036.1472
               / 0.00049112362

       Because ‘dollars_in’ includes the units, you should not include them at the ‘You have:’ prompt.  You  can
       also use ‘dollars_in’ to convert between two specified years:

       You have: 250 <a href="../man1970/dollars_in.1970.html">dollars_in</a>(1970)
       You want: <a href="../man1950/dollars_in.1950.html">dollars_in</a>(1950)
               * 156.49867
               / 0.0063898305

       which shows that 250 US$ in 1970 would have equivalent purchasing power to 156 US$ in 1950.

   <b>Other</b> <b>Nonlinear</b> <b>Units</b>
       Some  other  examples of nonlinear units are numerous different ring sizes and wire gauges, screw gauges,
       pipe and tubing sizes, the grit sizes used for abrasives, the decibel scale, shoe size,  scales  for  the
       density  of  sugar (e.g., baume).  The standard data file also supplies units for computing the area of a
       circle and the volume of a sphere.  See the standard units data file for more details.

       Diameters of American wire sizes can be found using the ‘wiregauge()’ function or its alias ‘awg()’:

       You have: <a href="../man11/wiregauge.11.html">wiregauge</a>(11)
       You want: inches
               * 0.090742002

       You have: 1 mm
       You want: wiregauge
               18.201919

       Wire and screw gauges with multiple zeroes are signified using negative numbers, where two zeroes  (“00”;
       “2/0”)  is  ‘-1’, three zeros (“000”; “3/0”) is ‘-2’, and so on.  Alternatively, you can use the synonyms
       ‘g00’, ‘g000’, or ‘g2_0’, ‘g3_0’, and so on that are defined in the standard units data file.

       You have: brwiregauge(g00)
       You want: inches
               * 0.348
               / 2.8735632

       In North America, wire sizes larger than 0000 (“4/0”) are usually given in terms of area, either in kcmil
       or the older initialism MCM (thousand circular mils).  Outside of  North  America,  all  wire  sizes  are
       usually  given  in  terms  of  area in mm^2.  Wire area can be obtained using ‘wiregaugeA()’ or its alias
       ‘awgA()’:

       You have: awgA(g6_0)
       You want: kcmil
               * 336.45718
               / 0.0029721464
       You have: <a href="../man12/awgA.12.html">awgA</a>(12)
       You want: mm^2
               * 3.3087729
               / 0.30222685

       The closest standard metric sizes are 2.5 mm^2 and 4 mm^2; in general, there isn’t an  exact  correlation
       between American and metric wire sizes.

       Though  based  on the long-established iron pipe size (IPS) given in inches, nominal pipe size (NPS) is a
       dimensionless quantity that corresponds to the inch size.  Pipe size can be equivalently specified  using
       metric  diamètre  nominal  (DN), which roughly corresponds to the diameter in mm.  For a given pipe size,
       outside diameter is constant while inside diameter varies with schedule.  For example, for NPS 2½ pipe,

       You have: npsOD(2+1|2)
       You want: in
               * 2.875

       You want: in
               * 2.323
               / 0.43047783

       Pipe size can be given equivalently in terms of the  metric  DN  by  using  the  ‘DN()’  function,  which
       converts nominal metric size to nominal inch size:

       You have: npsOD(<a href="../man65/DN.65.html">DN</a>(65))
       You want: mm

       Unlike with wire sizes, actual NPS and metric DN pipe dimensions are the same.

       The last example shows the conversion from P graded sand paper, which is the European standard and may be
       marked “P600” on the back, to the USA standard.

       You  can compute the area of a circle using the nonlinear unit, ‘circlearea’.  You can also do this using
       the circularinch or circleinch.  The next example shows two ways to compute the area of a circle  with  a
       five inch radius and one way to compute the volume of a sphere with a radius of one meter.

       You have: circlearea(5 in)
       You want: in2

               / 0.0067601492

       The inverse of a nonlinear conversion is indicated by prefixing a tilde (‘~’) to the nonlinear unit name:

       You have: ~wiregauge(0.090742002 inches)
       You want:
               Definition: 11

       You  can  give  a  nonlinear  unit  definition without an argument or parentheses, and press <u>Enter</u> at the
       ‘You want:’ prompt to get the definition of a nonlinear unit; if the definition is not valid for all real
       numbers, the range of validity is also given.  If the definition requires specific units this information
       is also displayed:

       You have: tempC
               Definition: tempC(x) = x K + stdtemp
                           defined for x &gt;= -273.15
       You have: ~tempC
               Definition: ~tempC(tempC) = (tempC +(-stdtemp))/K
                           defined for tempC &gt;= 0 K
       You have: circlearea
               Definition: circlearea(r) = pi r^2
                           r has units m

       To see the definition of the inverse use the ‘~’ notation.  In this case the parameter in the  functional
       definition  will  usually  be  the  name  of  the  unit.  Note that the inverse for ‘tempC’ shows that it
       requires units of ‘K’ in the specification of the allowed range of values.   Nonlinear  unit  conversions
       are described in more detail in <u>Defining</u> <u>Nonlinear</u> <u>Units</u>.

</pre><h4><b>UNIT</b> <b>LISTS:</b> <b>CONVERSION</b> <b>TO</b> <b>SUMS</b> <b>OF</b> <b>UNITS</b></h4><pre>
       Outside of the SI, it is sometimes desirable to convert a single unit to a sum of units—for example, feet
       to  feet  plus inches.  The conversion <u>from</u> sums of units was described in <u>Sums</u> <u>and</u> <u>Differences</u> <u>of</u> <u>Units</u>,
       and is a simple matter of adding the units with the ‘+’ sign:

       You have: 12 ft + 3 in + 3|8 in
       You want: ft
               * 12.28125
               / 0.081424936

       Although you can similarly write a sum of units to convert <u>to</u>, the result will not be the  conversion  to
       the units in the sum, but rather the conversion to the particular sum that you have entered:

       You have: 12.28125 ft
       You want: ft + in + 1|8 in
               * 11.228571
               / 0.089058524

       The  unit  expression given at the ‘You want:’ prompt is equivalent to asking for conversion to multiples
       of ‘1 ft + 1 in + 1|8 in’, which is 1.09375 ft, so the conversion in the previous example  is  equivalent
       to

       You have: 12.28125 ft
       You want: 1.09375 ft
               * 11.228571
               / 0.089058524

       In  converting  to  a  sum  of units like miles, feet and inches, you typically want the largest integral
       value for the first unit, followed by the  largest  integral  value  for  the  next,  and  the  remainder
       converted  to  the  last  unit.   You can do this conversion easily with <u>units</u> using a special syntax for
       lists of units.  You must list the desired units in order from largest  to  smallest,  separated  by  the
       semicolon (‘;’) character:

       You have: 12.28125 ft
       You want: ft;in;1|8 in
               12 ft + 3 in + 3|8 in

       The  conversion always gives integer coefficients on the units in the list, except possibly the last unit
       when the conversion is not exact:

       You have: 12.28126 ft
       You want: ft;in;1|8 in
               12 ft + 3 in + 3.00096 * 1|8 in

       The order in which you list the units is important:

       You have: 3 kg
       You want: oz;lb
               105 oz + 0.051367866 lb
       You have: 3 kg
       You want: lb;oz
               6 lb + 9.8218858 oz

       Listing ounces before pounds produces a technically correct result, but not a very useful one.  You  must
       list the units in descending order of size in order to get the most useful result.

       Ending  a unit list with the separator ‘;’ has the same effect as repeating the last unit on the list, so
       ‘ft;in;1|8 in;’ is equivalent to ‘ft;in;1|8 in;1|8 in’.  With the example above, this gives

       You have: 12.28126 ft
       You want: ft;in;1|8 in;
               12 ft + 3 in + 3|8 in + 0.00096 * 1|8 in

       in effect separating the integer and fractional parts of the coefficient  for  the  last  unit.   If  you
       instead  prefer  to  round  the  last coefficient to an integer you can do this with the ‘--round’ (‘-r’)
       option.  With the previous example, the result is

       You have: 12.28126 ft
       You want: ft;in;1|8 in
               12 ft + 3 in + 3|8 in (rounded down to nearest 1|8 in)

       When you use the ‘-r’ option, repeating the last unit on the list has no effect (e.g., ‘ft;in;1|8  in;1|8
       in’  is  equivalent  to  ‘ft;in;1|8 in’), and hence neither does ending a list with a ‘;’.  With a single
       unit and the ‘-r’ option, a terminal ‘;’ <u>does</u> have an effect: it causes <u>units</u> to treat the single unit as
       a list and produce a rounded value for the single unit.  Without the extra ‘;’, the ‘-r’  option  has  no
       effect on single unit conversions.  This example shows the output using the ‘-r’ option:

       You have: 12.28126 ft
       You want: in
               * 147.37512
               / 0.0067854058
       You have: 12.28126 ft
       You want: in;
               147 in (rounded down to nearest in)

       Each unit that appears in the list must be conformable with the first unit on the list, and of course the
       listed units must also be conformable with the unit that you enter at the ‘You have:’ prompt.

       You have: meter
       You want: ft;kg
                    ^
       conformability error
               ft = 0.3048 m
               kg = 1 kg
       You have: meter
       You want: lb;oz
       conformability error
               1 m
               0.45359237 kg

       In  the  first  case,  <u>units</u> reports the disagreement between units appearing on the list.  In the second
       case, <u>units</u> reports disagreement  between  the  unit  you  entered  and  the  desired  conversion.   This
       conformability error is based on the first unit on the unit list.

       Other common candidates for conversion to sums of units are angles and time:

       You have: 23.437754 deg
       You want: deg;arcmin;arcsec
           23 deg + 26 arcmin + 15.9144 arcsec
       You have: 7.2319 hr
       You want: hr;min;sec
           7 hr + 13 min + 54.84 sec

       Some  applications  for unit lists may be less obvious.  Suppose that you have a postal scale and wish to
       ensure that it’s accurate at 1 oz, but have only metric calibration weights.  You might try

       You have: 1 oz
       You want: 100 g;50 g; 20 g;10 g;5 g;2 g;1 g;
               20 g + 5 g + 2 g + 1 g + 0.34952312 * 1 g

       You might then place one each of the 20 g, 5 g, 2 g, and 1 g weights  on  the  scale  and  hope  that  it
       indicates close to

       You have: 20 g + 5 g + 2 g + 1 g
       You want: oz;
               0.98767093 oz

       Appending  ‘;’  to  ‘oz’  forces  a one-line display that includes the unit; here the integer part of the
       result is zero, so it is not displayed.

       If a non-empty list item differs vastly in scale  from  the  quantity  from  which  the  list  is  to  be
       converted,  you may exceed the available precision of floating point (about 15 digits), in which case you
       will get a warning, e.g.,

       You have: lightyear
       You want: mile;100 inch;10 inch;mm;micron
               5.8786254e+12 mile + 390 * 100 inch (at 15-digit precision limit)

   <b>Cooking</b> <b>Measure</b>
       In North America, recipes for cooking typically measure ingredients by volume, and use units that are not
       always convenient multiples of each other.  Suppose that you have a recipe for 6 and you wish to  make  a
       portion  for  1.   If  the  recipe  calls  for  2 1/2  cups  of an ingredient, you might wish to know the
       measurements in terms of measuring devices you have available, you could use <u>units</u> and enter

       You have: (2+1|2) cup / 6
       You want: cup;1|2 cup;1|3 cup;1|4 cup;tbsp;tsp;1|2 tsp;1|4 tsp
               1|3 cup + 1 tbsp + 1 tsp

       By default, if a unit in a list begins with fraction of the form 1|<u>x</u> and its multiplier  is  an  integer,
       the fraction is given as the product of the multiplier and the numerator; for example,

       You have: 12.28125 ft
       You want: ft;in;1|8 in;
               12 ft + 3 in + 3|8 in

       In  many cases, such as the example above, this is what is wanted, but sometimes it is not.  For example,
       a cooking recipe for 6 might call for 5 1/4 cup of an ingredient, but you want a portion for 2, and  your
       1-cup measure is not available; you might try

       You have: (5+1|4) cup / 3
       You want: 1|2 cup;1|3 cup;1|4 cup
               3|2 cup + 1|4 cup

       This  result  might be fine for a baker who has a 1 1/2-cup measure (and recognizes the equivalence), but
       it may not be as useful to someone with more limited set of measures, who  does  want  to  do  additional
       calculations,  and  only  wants  to know “How many 1/2-cup measures to I need to add?”  After all, that’s
       what was actually asked.  With the ‘--show-factor’ option, the factor will not be combined with  a  unity
       numerator, so that you get

       You have: (5+1|4) cup / 3
       You want: 1|2 cup;1|3 cup;1|4 cup
               3 * 1|2 cup + 1|4 cup

       A  user-specified  fractional  unit  with a numerator other than 1 is never overridden, however—if a unit
       list specifies ‘3|4 cup;1|2 cup’, a result equivalent to 1 1/2 cups will always be shown as ‘2 * 3|4 cup’
       whether or not the ‘--show-factor’ option is given.

       A unit list such as

       would work with a slightly looser fit.

</pre><h4><b>ALTERNATIVE</b> <b>UNIT</b> <b>SYSTEMS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>CGS</b> <b>Units</b>
       The  SI—an  extension  of  the  MKS  (meter–kilogram–second)  system—has largely supplanted the older CGS
       (centimeter–gram–second) system, but CGS units are still used in a few specialized fields, especially  in
       physics where they lead to a more elegant formulation of Maxwell’s equations.  Conversions between SI and
       CGS  involving  mechanical  units  are  straightforward,  involving  powers  of  10 (e.g., 1 m = 100 cm).
       Conversions involving electromagnetic units are more  complicated,  and  <u>units</u>  supports  four  different
       systems of CGS units: electrostatic units (ESU), electromagnetic units (EMU), the Gaussian system and the
       Heaviside–Lorentz  system.   The  differences between these systems arise from different choices made for
       proportionality constants in electromagnetic equations.  Coulomb’s law gives electrostatic force  between
       two charges separated by a distance delim $$ <u>r</u>:

            <u>F</u> = <u>k</u>_C <u>q</u>_1 <u>q</u>_2 / <u>r</u>^2.

       Ampere’s  law  gives  the  electromagnetic  force per unit length between two current-carrying conductors
       separated by a distance <u>r</u>:

            <u>F</u>/<u>l</u> = 2 <u>k</u>_A <u>I</u>_1 <u>I</u>_2 / <u>r</u>.

       The two constants, <u>k</u>_C and <u>k</u>_A, are related by the square of the speed of light: <u>k</u>_A = <u>k</u>_C / <u>c</u>^2.

       In the SI, the constants have dimensions, and an additional base  unit,  the  ampere,  measures  electric
       current.   The  CGS systems do not define new base units, but express charge and current as derived units
       in terms of mass, length, and time.  In the ESU system, the constant for Coulomb’s law is  chosen  to  be
       unity  and dimensionless, which defines the unit of charge.  In the EMU system, the constant for Ampere’s
       law is chosen to be unity and dimensionless, which defines  a  unit  of  current.   The  Gaussian  system
       usually  uses the ESU units for charge and current; it chooses another constant so that the units for the
       electric and magnetic fields are the same.   The  Heaviside–Lorentz  system  is  “rationalized”  so  that
       factors  of 4{pi} do not appear in Maxwell’s equations.  The SI system is similarly rationalized, but the
       other CGS systems are not.  In the  Heaviside–Lorentz  (HLU)  system  the  factor  of  4{pi}  appears  in
       Coulomb’s  law  instead;  this  system  differs from the Gaussian system by factors of the square root of
       4{pi}

       The dimensions of electrical quantities in the various CGS systems are different from the  SI  dimensions
       for  the  same  units; strictly, conversions between these systems and SI are not possible.  But units in
       different systems relate to the same physical quantities, so there  is  a  <u>correspondence</u>  between  these
       units.   The  <u>units</u>  program defines the units so that you can convert between corresponding units in the
       various systems.

       The CGS definitions involve cm^(1/2) and g^(1/2), which is problematic because <u>units</u>  does  not  normally
       support  fractional  roots  of  base  units.   The ‘--units’ (‘-u’) option allows selection of a CGS unit
       system and works around this restriction by introducing base units for the square  roots  of  length  and
       mass:  ‘sqrt_cm’  and  ‘sqrt_g’.  The centimeter then becomes ‘sqrt_cm^2’ and the gram, ‘sqrt_g^2’.  This
       allows working from equations using the units in the CGS system,  and  enforcing  dimensional  conformity
       within  that  system.   Recognized  CGS arguments to the ‘--units’ option are ‘gauss[ian]’, ‘esu’, ‘emu’,
       ‘lhu’; the argument is case insensitive.  You can also give ‘si’ which just enforces the default SI  mode
       and displays ‘(SI)’ at the ‘You have:’ prompt to emphasize the units mode.  Some other types of units are
       also  supported as described below.  Giving an unrecognized system generates a warning, and <u>units</u> uses SI
       units.

       The changes resulting from the ‘--units’ option are actually controlled by the  UNITS_SYSTEM  environment
       variable.   If  you  frequently  work  with  one  of  the  supported  CGS units systems, you may set this
       environment variable rather than giving the ‘--units’ option at each invocation.   As  usual,  an  option
       given  on  the  command line overrides the setting of the environment variable. For example, if you would
       normally work with Gaussian units but might occasionally work with SI,  you  could  set  UNITS_SYSTEM  to
       ‘gaussian’  and  specify  SI with the ‘--units’ option.  Unlike the argument to the ‘--units’ option, the
       value of UNITS_SYSTEM <u>is</u> case sensitive, so setting a value of ‘EMU’ will have no effect  other  than  to
       give an error message and set SI units.

       The CGS definitions appear as conditional settings in the standard units data file, which you can consult
       for more information on how these units are defined, or on how to define an alternate units system.

       The  ESU  system  derives  the  electromagnetic  units from its unit of charge, the statcoulomb, which is
       defined from Coulomb’s law.  The statcoulomb equals dyne^(1/2) cm, or cm^(3/2) g^(1/2) s^(−1).  The  unit
       of  current,  the  statampere, is statcoulomb sec, analogous to the relationship in SI.  Other electrical
       units are then derived in a manner similar to that for SI units; the units use the SI names  prefixed  by
       ‘stat-’, e.g., ‘statvolt’ or ‘statV’.  The prefix ‘st-’ is also recognized (e.g., ‘stV’).

       The EMU system derives the electromagnetic units from its unit of current, the abampere, which is defined
       in  terms  of  Ampere’s law.  The abampere is equal to dyne^(1/2), or cm^(1/2) g^(1/2) s^(−1).  delim off
       The unit of charge, the abcoulomb, is abampere sec,  again  analogous  to  the  SI  relationship.   Other
       electrical  units  are  then derived in a manner similar to that for SI units; the units use the SI names
       prefixed by ‘ab-’, e.g., ‘abvolt’ or ‘abV’.  The magnetic field units include the gauss, the oersted  and
       the maxwell.

       The Gaussian units system, which was also known as the Symmetric System, uses the same charge and current
       units  as  the  ESU system (e.g., ‘statC’, ‘statA’); it differs by defining the magnetic field so that it
       has the same units as the electric field.  The resulting magnetic field units are the same ones  used  in
       the EMU system: the gauss, the oersted and the maxwell.

       The  Heaviside–Lorentz  system  appears  to  lack named units.  We define five basic units, ‘hlu_charge’,
       ‘hlu_current’, ‘hlu_volt’, ‘hlu_efield’ and  ‘hlu_bfield’  for  conversions  with  this  system.   It  is
       important  to  remember  that with all of the CGS systems, the units may look the same but mean something
       different.  The HLU system  and  Gaussian  systems  both  measure  magnetic  field  using  the  same  CGS
       dimensions, but the amount of magnetic field with the same units is different in the two systems.

       The  CGS  systems  define  units  that  measure  the  same  thing  but  may  have conflicting dimensions.
       Furthermore, the dimensions of the electromagnetic CGS units are never compatible with SI.   But  if  you
       measure  charge  in  two  different  systems  you  have  measured  the same physical thing, so there is a
       <u>correspondence</u> between the units in  the  different  systems,  and  <u>units</u>  supports  conversions  between
       corresponding  units.  When running with SI, <u>units</u> defines all of the CGS units in terms of SI.  When you
       select a CGS system, <u>units</u> defines the SI units and the other CGS system units in terms of the system you
       have selected.

       (Gaussian) You have: statA
                  You want: abA
               * 3.335641e-11
               / 2.9979246e+10
       (Gaussian) You have: abA
                  You want: sqrt(dyne)
       conformability error
               2.9979246e+10 sqrt_cm^3 sqrt_g / s^2
               1 sqrt_cm sqrt_g / s

       In the above example, <u>units</u> converts between the current units statA and abA even though  the  abA,  from
       the  EMU system, has incompatible dimensions.  This works because in Gaussian mode, the abA is defined in
       terms of the statA, so it does not have the correct definition for EMU; consequently, you cannot  convert
       the abA to its EMU definition.

       One  challenge  of  conversion  is that because the CGS system has fewer base units, quantities that have
       different dimensions in SI may have the same dimension in a CGS system.  And yet, they may not  have  the
       same  conversion factor.  For example, the unit for the E field and B fields are the same in the Gaussian
       system, but the conversion factors to SI are quite different.  This means that correct conversion is only
       possible if you keep track of what quantity is being measured.  You cannot convert statV/cm to SI without
       indicating which type of field the unit measures.  To aid in dimensional analysis, <u>units</u> defines  various
       dimension  units  such  as  ‘LENGTH’,  ‘TIME’,  and  ‘CHARGE’ to be the appropriate dimension in SI.  The
       electromagnetic dimensions such as ‘B_FIELD’ or ‘E_FIELD’ may be useful  aids  both  for  conversion  and
       dimensional analysis in CGS.  You can convert them to or from CGS in order to perform SI conversions that
       in  some  cases  will not work directly due to dimensional incompatibilities.  This example shows how the
       Gaussian system uses the same units for all of the fields, but they all have different conversion factors
       with SI.

       (Gaussian) You have: statV/cm
                  You want: E_FIELD
               * 29979.246
               / 3.335641e-05
       (Gaussian) You have: statV/cm
                  You want: B_FIELD
               * 0.0001
               / 10000
       (Gaussian) You have: statV/cm
                  You want: H_FIELD
               * 79.577472
               / 0.012566371
       (Gaussian) You have: statV/cm
                  You want: D_FIELD
               * 2.6544187e-07
               / 3767303.1

       The next example shows that the oersted cannot be converted directly to the SI unit  of  magnetic  field,
       A/m,  because  the  dimensions conflict.  We cannot redefine the ampere to make this work because then it
       would not convert with the statampere.  But you can still do this conversion as shown below.

       (Gaussian) You have: oersted
                  You want: A/m
       conformability error

       Like the CGS units, “natural” units are an alternative to the SI  system  used  primarily  physicists  in
       different  fields,  with  different  systems  tailored  to  different fields of study.  These systems are
       “natural” because the base measurements are defined using physical constants instead of arbitrary  values
       such  as  the  meter  or second.  In different branches of physics, different physical constants are more
       fundamental, which has given rise to a variety of incompatible natural unit systems.

       The supported systems are the “natural” units (which seem to have no better name)  used  in  high  energy
       physics  and  cosmology, the Planck units, often used by scientists working with gravity, and the Hartree
       atomic units are favored by those working in physical chemistry and condensed matter physics.

       You can select the various natural units using the ‘--units’ option in the same way that you  select  the
       CGS   units.    The  “natural”  units  come  in  two  types,  a  rationalized  system  derived  from  the
       Heaviside–Lorentz units and an unrationalized system derived from the Gaussian system.   You  can  select
       these  using  ‘natural’ and ‘natural-gauss’ respectively.  For conversions in SI mode, several unit names
       starting with ‘natural’ are available.  This “natural” system is defined by setting  {hbar},  c  and  the
       Boltzman constant to 1.  Only a single base unit remains: the electron volt.

       The  Planck  units  exist  in  a  variety  of  forms,  and  <u>units</u> supports two.  Both supported forms are
       rationalized, in that factors of 4{pi} do not appear in Maxwell’s equations.  However, Planck  units  can
       also  differ  based  on how the gravitational constant is treated.  This system is similar to the natural
       units in that c, {hbar}, and Boltzman’s constant are set to 1, but in this system, Newton’s gravitational
       constant, <u>G</u> is also fixed.  In the “reduced” Planck system, delim $$ 8{pi}<u>G</u> = 1 whereas in the  unreduced
       system <u>G</u> = 1.  The reduced system eliminates factors of 8{pi} delim off from the Einstein field equations
       for  gravitation,  so  this is similar to the process of forming rationalized units to simplify Maxwell’s
       equations.  To obtain the unreduced system use the name  ‘planck’  and  for  the  reduced  Planck  units,
       ‘planck-red’.   Units  such  as ‘planckenergy’ and ‘planckenergy_red’ enable you to convert the unreduced
       and reduced Planck energy unit in SI mode between the various systems.  In Planck units, all measurements
       are dimensionless.

       The final natural unit system is the Hartree atomic units.  Like the Planck units,  all  measurements  in
       the  Hartree  units  are  dimensionless,  but this system is defined by defined from completely different
       physical constants: the electron mass, Planck’s constant, the electron charge, and the  Coulomb  constant
       are  the  defining  physical  quantities,  which  are  all  set to unity.  To invoke this system with the
       ‘--units’ option use the name ‘hartree’.

   <b>Prompt</b> <b>Prefix</b>
       If a unit system is specified with the ‘--units’ option, the selected system’s name is prepended  to  the
       ‘You have:’ prompt as a reminder, e.g.,

       (Gaussian) You have: stC
                  You want:
               Definition: statcoulomb = sqrt(dyne) cm = 1 sqrt_cm^3 sqrt_g / s

       You can suppressed the prefix by including a line

       !prompt

       with  no  argument  in a site or personal units data file.  The prompt can be conditionally suppressed by
       including such a line within ‘!var’ ... ‘!endvar’ constructs, e.g.,

       !var UNITS_SYSTEM gaussian gauss
       !prompt
       !endvar

       This might be appropriate if you normally use Gaussian units and find the prefix distracting but want  to
       be reminded when you have selected a different CGS system.

</pre><h4><b>LOGGING</b> <b>CALCULATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The  ‘--log’  option  allows you to save the results of calculations in a file; this can be useful if you
       need a permanent record of your work.   For  example,  the  fluid-flow  conversion  in  <u>Complicated</u>  <u>Unit</u>
       <u>Expressions</u>,  is lengthy, and if you were to use it in designing a piping system, you might want a record
       of it for the project file.  If the interactive session

       # Conversion factor A1 for pressure drop
       # dP = A1 rho f L Q^2/d^5
       You have: (8/pi^2) (lbm/ft^3)ft(ft^3/s)^2(1/in^5) # Input units
       You want: psi
               * 43.533969
               / 0.022970568

       were logged, the log file would contain

       ### Log started Fri Oct 02 15:55:35 2015
       # Conversion factor A1 for pressure drop
       # dP = A1 rho f L Q^2/d^5
       From: (8/pi^2) (lbm/ft^3)ft(ft^3/s)^2(1/in^5)   # Input units
       To:   psi
               * 43.533969
               / 0.022970568

       The time is written to the log file when the file is opened.

       The use of comments can help clarify  the  meaning  of  calculations  for  the  log.   The  log  includes
       conformability errors between the units at the ‘You have:’ and ‘You want:’ prompts, but not other errors,
       including  lack  of  conformability  of  items in sums or differences or among items in a unit list.  For
       example, a conversion between zenith angle and elevation angle could involve

       You have: 90 deg - (5 deg + 22 min + 9 sec)
                                          ^
       Invalid sum or difference of non-conformable units
       You have: 90 deg - (5 deg + 22 arcmin + 9 arcsec)
       You want: dms
               84 deg + 37 arcmin + 51 arcsec
       You have: _
       You want: deg
               * 84.630833
               / 0.011816024
       You have:

       The log file would contain

       From: 90 deg - (5 deg + 22 arcmin + 9 arcsec)
       To:   deg;arcmin;arcsec
               84 deg + 37 arcmin + 51 arcsec
       From: _
       To:   deg
               * 84.630833
               / 0.011816024

       The initial entry error (forgetting that minutes have dimension of time, and that arcminutes must be used
       for dimensions of angle) does not appear in the output.  When converting to  a  unit  list  alias,  <u>units</u>
       expands the alias in the log file.

       The ‘From:’ and ‘To:’ tags are written to the log file even if the ‘--quiet’ option is given.  If the log
       file  exists when <u>units</u> is invoked, the new results are appended to the log file.  The time is written to
       the log file each time the file is opened.  The ‘--log’  option  is  ignored  when  <u>units</u>  is  used  non-
       interactively.

<b>INVOKING</b> <u><b>UNITS</b></u>
       You invoke <u>units</u> like this:

       units [<u>options</u>] [<u>from-unit</u> [<u>to-unit</u>]]

       If  the  <u>from-unit</u>  and  <u>to-unit</u> are omitted, the program will use interactive prompts to determine which
       conversions to perform.  See <u>Interactive</u> <u>Use</u>.  If both <u>from-unit</u> and <u>to-unit</u> are given, <u>units</u> will  print
       the result of that single conversion and then exit.  If only <u>from-unit</u> appears on the command line, <u>units</u>
       will  display  the  definition of that unit and exit.  Units specified on the command line may need to be
       quoted to protect them from shell interpretation and to group them into two arguments.   Note  also  that
       the  ‘--quiet’  option  is  enabled by default if you specify <u>from-unit</u> on the command line.  See <u>Command</u>
       <u>Line</u> <u>Use</u>.

       The default behavior of <u>units</u> can be changed by various options given  on  the  command  line.   In  most
       cases,  the  options  may  be given in either short form (a single ‘-’ followed by a single character) or
       long form (‘--’ followed by a word or  hyphen-separated  words).   Short-form  options  are  cryptic  but
       require  less  typing;  long-form  options  require  more typing but are more explanatory and may be more
       mnemonic.  With long-form options you need only enter sufficient  characters  to  uniquely  identify  the
       option  to  the  program.  For example, ‘--out %f’ works, but ‘--o %f’ fails because <u>units</u> has other long
       options beginning with ‘o’.  However, ‘--q’ works because ‘--quiet’ is the  only  long  option  beginning
       with ‘q’.

       Some  options  require arguments to specify a value (e.g., ‘-d 12’ or ‘--digits 12’).  Short-form options
       that do not take arguments may be concatenated (e.g., ‘-erS’  is  equivalent  to  ‘-e -r -S’);  the  last
       option  in  such a list may be one that takes an argument (e.g., ‘-ed 12’).  With short-form options, the
       space between an option and its argument is optional (e.g., ‘-d12’ is equivalent to ‘-d 12’).   Long-form
       options  may  not be concatenated, and the space between a long-form option and its argument is required.
       Short-form and long-form options may be intermixed on the command line.  Options  may  be  given  in  any
       order,  but  when  incompatible  options  (e.g.,  ‘--output-format’  and  ‘--exponential’)  are  given in
       combination, behavior  is  controlled  by  the  last  option  given.   For  example,  ‘-o%.12f -e’  gives
       exponential format with the default eight significant digits).

       Many  options  can be set interactively; this can be especially helpful for Windows users who start <u>units</u>
       from a shortcut.  See <u>Setting</u> <u>Options</u> <u>Interactively</u> for more information.

       The following options are available:

       <b>-c</b>, <b>--check</b>
              Check that all units and prefixes defined in units data files reduce to primitive units.   Display
              a  list  of  all units that cannot be reduced and a list of units with circular definitions.  Also
              display some other diagnostics  about  suspicious  definitions  in  the  units  data  file.   Only
              definitions  active  in  the  current  locale  are checked.  You should always run <u>units</u> with this
              option after modifying a units data file.

              Some errors may hide other errors, so you should run <u>units</u> with this option again after correcting
              any errors, and keep doing so until there are no errors.

       <b>--check-verbose</b>, <b>--verbose-check</b>
              Like the ‘--check’ option, this option displays a list of units that cannot be  reduced.   But  it
              also  lists the units as they are checked.  Because the ‘--check’ option now catches circular unit
              definitions that previously caused <u>units</u> to hang, this option  is  no  longer  necessary.   It  is
              retained only for compatibility with previous versions.

       <b>-d</b> <u>ndigits</u>, <b>--digits</b> <u>ndigits</u>
              Set  the  number of significant digits in the output to the value specified (which must be greater
              than zero).  For example, ‘-d 12’ sets the number of significant digits to 12.   With  exponential
              output,  <u>units</u>  displays one digit to the left of the decimal point and eleven digits to the right
              of the decimal point.  On most systems, the maximum number of internally meaningful digits is  15;
              if you specify a greater number than your system’s maximum, <u>units</u> will print a warning and set the
              number  to  the  largest meaningful value.  To directly set the maximum value, give an argument of
              max (e.g., ‘-d max’).  Be aware, of course, that “significant” here refers only to the <u>display</u>  of
              numbers;  if  results  depend  on  physical  constants not known to this precision, the physically
              meaningful precision may be less than that shown.  The ‘--digits’ option is incompatible with  the
              ‘--output-format’  option;  if  you  give  them  both, the format is controlled by the last option
              given.

       <b>-e</b>, <b>--exponential</b>
              Set the numeric output format to exponential (i.e., scientific notation), like that  used  in  the
              Unix  <u>units</u> program.  The default precision is eight significant digits (seven digits to the right
              of the decimal point); this can be changed with the ‘--digits’ option.  The ‘--exponential’ option
              is incompatible with the ‘--output-format’ option; if you give them both, the format is controlled
              by the last option given.

       <b>-o</b> <u>format</u>, <b>--output-format</b> <u>format</u>
              This option affords complete control over the numeric output format using  the  specified  <u>format</u>.
              The  format is a single floating point numeric format for the printf function in the C programming
              language.  All compilers support the format types ‘g’ and ‘G’ to specify significant  digits,  ‘e’
              and ‘E’ for scientific notation, and ‘f’ for fixed-point decimal.  The ISO C99 standard introduced
              the  ‘F’  type  for  fixed-point decimal and the ‘a’ and ‘A’ types for hexadecimal floating point;
              these types are allowed with compilers that support them.   The  default  format  is  ‘%.8g’;  for
              greater  precision,  you  could  specify  ‘-o %.15g’.   Unlike with the ‘--digits’ option, you can
              specify any desired precision, though not all digits may be meaningful. See <u>Numeric</u> <u>Output</u>  <u>Format</u>
              and  the documentation for printf for more detailed descriptions of the format specification.  The
              ‘--output-format’ option affords the greatest control of the output appearance,  but  requires  at
              least  rudimentary  knowledge  of  the printf format syntax.  If you don’t want to bother with the
              printf syntax, you can specify greater precision more simply with the ‘--digits’ option or  select
              exponential  format  with  ‘--exponential’.  The ‘--output-format’ option is incompatible with the
              ‘--exponential’ and ‘--digits’ options; if you give either in combination with  ‘--output-format’,
              the format is controlled by the last option given.

       <b>-f</b> <u>filename</u>, <b>--file</b> <u>filename</u>
              Instruct  <u>units</u>  to  load  the  units  file <u>filename</u>.  You can specify up to 25 units files on the
              command line.  When you use this option, <u>units</u> will load <u>only</u> the files you list  on  the  command
              line;  it  will  not load the standard file or your personal units file unless you explicitly list
              them.  If <u>filename</u> is the empty string (‘-f ""’), the default main units file (or  that  specified
              by UNITSFILE) will be loaded in addition to any others specified with ‘-f’.

       <b>-L</b> <u>logfile</u>, <b>--log</b> <u>logfile</u>
              Save  the  results  of  calculations in the file <u>logfile</u>; this can be useful if it is important to
              have a record of unit conversions or other calculations that are to be used extensively  or  in  a
              critical  activity  such  as  a  program or design project.  If <u>logfile</u> exits, the new results are
              appended to the file.  This option is ignored when <u>units</u> is used non-interactively.   See  <u>Logging</u>
              <u>Calculations</u> for a more detailed description and some examples.

       <b>-H</b> <u>filename</u>, <b>--history</b> <u>filename</u>
              Instruct  <u>units</u>  to  save  history to <u>filename</u>, so that a record of your commands is available for
              retrieval across different <u>units</u> invocations.   To  prevent  the  history  from  being  saved  set
              <u>filename</u> to the empty string (‘-H ""’).  This option has no effect if readline is not available.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
              Print out a summary of the options for <u>units</u>.

       <b>-m</b>, <b>--minus</b>
              Causes ‘-’ to be interpreted as a subtraction operator.  This is the default behavior.

       <b>-p</b>, <b>--product</b>
              Causes  ‘-’  to be interpreted as a multiplication operator when it has two operands.  It will act
              as a negation operator when it has only one operand: ‘(-3)’.  By  default  ‘-’  is  treated  as  a
              subtraction operator.

       <b>--oldstar</b>
              Causes  ‘*’  to  have  the  old-style  precedence,  higher than the precedence of division so that
              ‘1/2*3’ will equal ‘1/6’.

       <b>--newstar</b>
              Forces ‘*’ to have the new (default) precedence that follows  the  usual  rules  of  algebra:  the
              precedence of ‘*’ is the same as the precedence of ‘/’, so that ‘1/2*3’ will equal ‘3/2’.

       <b>-r</b>, <b>--round</b>
              When  converting  to a combination of units given by a unit list, round the value of the last unit
              in the list to the nearest integer.

       <b>-S</b>, <b>--show-factor</b>
              When converting to a combination of units specified in a list,  always  show  a  non-unity  factor
              before  a unit that begins with a fraction with a unity denominator.  By default, if the unit in a
              list begins with fraction of the form 1|<u>x</u> and its multiplier is  an  integer  other  than  1,  the
              fraction  is  given as the product of the multiplier and the numerator (e.g., ‘3|8 in’ rather than
              ‘3 * 1|8 in’).  In some cases, this is not what is wanted; for example, the results for a  cooking
              recipe  might  show  ‘3  *  1|2 cup’  as  ‘3|2 cup’.   With  the  ‘--show-factor’ option, a result
              equivalent to 1.5 cups will display as ‘3 * 1|2 cup’  rather  than  ‘3|2 cup’.   A  user-specified
              fractional  unit  with  a  numerator  other  than  1  is  never overridden, however—if a unit list
              specifies ‘3|4 cup;1|2 cup’, a result equivalent to 1 1/2 cups  will  always  be  shown  as  ‘2  *
              3|4 cup’ whether or not the ‘--show-factor’ option is given.

       <b>--conformable</b>
              In  non-interactive  mode, show all units conformable with the original unit expression.  Only one
              unit expression is allowed; if you give more than one, <u>units</u> will exit with an error  message  and
              return failure.

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b>
              Give  slightly more verbose output when converting units.  When combined with the ‘-c’ option this
              gives the same effect as ‘--check-verbose’.   When  combined  with  ‘--version’  produces  a  more
              detailed output, equivalent to the ‘--info’ option.

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--version</b>
              Print  the  program  version  number,  tell  whether  the <u>readline</u> library has been included, tell
              whether UTF-8 support has been included; give the locale, the location of the default  main  units
              data  file,  and the location of the personal units data file; indicate if the personal units data
              file does not exist.

              When given in combination with the ‘--terse’ option, the program prints only  the  version  number
              and exits.

              When given in combination with the ‘--verbose’ option, the program, the ‘--version’ option has the
              same effect as the ‘--info’ option below.

       <b>-I</b>, <b>--info</b>
              Print  the  information given with the ‘--version’ option, show the pathname of the units program,
              show the status of the UNITSFILE and MYUNITSFILE environment variables, and additional information
              about how <u>units</u> locates the related files.  On systems running Microsoft Windows,  the  status  of
              the  UNITSLOCALE environment variable and information about the related locale map are also given.
              This option is usually of interest only to developers and administrators, but it can sometimes  be
              useful for troubleshooting.

              Combining the ‘--version’ and ‘--verbose’ options has the same effect as giving ‘--info’.

       <b>-U</b>, <b>--unitsfile</b>
              Print  the  location  of  the  default main units data file and exit; if the file cannot be found,
              print “Units data file not found”.

       <b>-u</b> <u>units-system</u>, <b>--units</b> <u>units-system</u>
              Specify a CGS units system or natural units system.  The supported units systems are:  gauss[ian],
              esu,  emu,  hlu, natural, natural-gauss, hartree, planck, planck-red, and si. See <u>Alternative</u> <u>Unit</u>
              <u>Systems</u> for further information about these unit systems.

       <b>-l</b> <u>locale</u>, <b>--locale</b> <u>locale</u>
              Force a specified locale such as ‘en_GB’ to get British definitions by  default.   This  overrides
              the  locale determined from system settings or environment variables. See <u>Locale</u> for a description
              of locale format.

       <b>-n</b>, <b>--nolists</b>
              Disable conversion to unit lists.

       <b>-s</b>, <b>--strict</b>
              Suppress conversion of units to their reciprocal units.  For example, <u>units</u> will normally  convert
              hertz  to  seconds  because these units are reciprocals of each other.  The strict option requires
              that units be strictly conformable to perform a conversion, and will give an error if you  attempt
              to convert hertz to seconds.

       <b>-1</b>, <b>--one-line</b>
              Give  only one line of output (the forward conversion); do not print the reverse conversion.  If a
              reciprocal conversion is performed, then <u>units</u> will still print the “reciprocal conversion” line.

       <b>-t</b>, <b>--terse</b>
              Print only a single conversion factor without any clutter, or if you request a definition,  prints
              just  the  definition  (including  its  units).   This  option can be used when calling <u>units</u> from
              another program so that the output is easy to parse.  The command units --terse  mile  m  produces
              the  output  ‘1690.344’.   This  option  has  the  combined  effect  of these options:  ‘--strict’
              ‘--quiet’ ‘--one-line’ ‘--compact’.  When combined with ‘--version’ it produces a display  showing
              only the program name and version number.

       <b>--compact</b>
              Give  compact  output  featuring only the conversion factor; the multiplication and division signs
              are not shown, and there is no leading whitespace.  If you convert to a unit list, then the output
              is a semicolon separated list of factors.  This turns off the ‘--verbose’ option.

       <b>-q</b>, <b>--quiet</b>, <b>--silent</b>
              Suppress the display of statistics about the number of units loaded, any messages printed  by  the
              units  database,  and  the prompting of the user for units.  This option does not affect how <u>units</u>
              displays the results.  This option is turned on by  default  if  you  invoke  <u>units</u>  with  a  unit
              expression on the command line.

</pre><h4><b>SETTING</b> <b>OPTIONS</b> <b>INTERACTIVELY</b></h4><pre>
       Many  command-line options can also be set interactively, obviating the need to quit and restart <u>units</u> to
       change the values.  This can be especially helpful for Windows users who start <u>units</u> from a shortcut.

       Typing <u>set</u> will display a list of all options that can be set interactively, as well as the  current  and
       possible values; options set to other than default values have an asterisk (‘*’) prepended. For example,

       You have: set
         q[uiet] = no         (y|n) do/don’t suppress prompting
         o[neline] = no       (y|n) do/don’t suppress the second line of output
         st[rict] = no        (y|n) do/don’t suppress reciprocal unit conversion
                                    (e.g. Hz&lt;-&gt;s)
         t[erse] = no         (y|n) do/don’t give very terse output
         c[ompact] = no       (y|n) do/don’t suppress printing tab, SETFLAG, and ’/’
                                    characters in results
         v[erbose] = 1        (0|1|2) amount of information shown
        *d[igits] = 9         number of significant digits in output
         e[ponential] = no    (y|n) do/don’t use exponential ("scientific") notation
        *f[ormat] = %.9g      <a href="../man3/printf.3.html">printf</a>(3) format specification
         u[nitlists] = yes    (y|n) do/don’t allow conversion to unit lists
         r[ound] = no         (y|n) do/don’t round last element of unit list output
                                    to an integer
         sh[owfactor] = no    (y|n) do/don’t show non-unity factor before 1|x
                                    in multi-unit output

       Characters  within  the  square brackets are optional, so settings can be changed by entering only one or
       two characters.

       The syntax for setting options is <u>set</u> <u>option</u> <u>=</u> <u>value</u>; the spaces around the ‘=’ sign are optional.

       Some settings are Boolean, enabled by entering <u>yes</u> (or just <u>y</u>) and disabled by entering <u>no</u> (or  just  <u>n</u>).
       For example,

       You have: set quiet = y
         quiet = yes

       Other settings take an integer value; for example,

       You have: set d=11
         digits = 11
         format = %.11g

       The  format setting takes a string, the format specification for the printf function in the C programming
       language; for example,

       You have: set format = %.9g
         format = %.9g

       Typing <u>set</u> <u>option</u> will display the current value of <u>option</u>, for example

       You have: set u
         unitlists = yes
       You have: set d
         digits = 8
         format = %.8g

       For the digits and exponential options, the value of format is also shown.

<b>SCRIPTING</b> <b>WITH</b> <u><b>UNITS</b></u>
       Despite its numerous options, <u>units</u> cannot cover every conceivable unit-conversion  task.   For  example,
       suppose  we  have  found some mysterious scale, but cannot figure out the units in which it is reporting.
       We reach into our pocket, place a 3.75-gram coin on the scale, and observe  the  scale  reading  ‘0.120’.
       How  do  we  quickly  determine  the units?  Or we might wonder if a unit has any “synonyms,” i.e., other
       units with the same value.

       The capabilities of <u>units</u> are easily extended  with  simple  scripting.   Both  questions  above  involve
       conformable  units; on a system with Unix-like utilities, conversions to conformable units could be shown
       accomplished with the following script:

       #!<a href="file:/bin/sh">/bin/sh</a>
       progname=`basename $0 .sh`
       umsg="Usage: $progname [&lt;number&gt;] unit"
       if [ $# -lt 1 ]
       then
           echo "$progname: missing quantity to convert"
           echo "$umsg"
           exit 1
       fi
       for unit in `units --conformable "$*" | cut -f 1 -d ' '`
       do
           echo "$*"   # have -- quantity to convert
           echo $unit  # want -- conformable unit
       done | units --terse --verbose

       When <u>units</u> is invoked with no non-option arguments, it reads <u>have</u>/<u>want</u> pairs, on alternating lines,  from
       its  standard input, so the task can be accomplished with only two invocations of <u>units</u>.  This avoids the
       computational overhead of needlessly reprocessing the units database for each conformable unit,  as  well
       as the inherent system overhead of process invocation.

       By  itself,  the  script  is not very useful.  But it could be used in combination with other commands to
       address specific tasks.  For example, running the script through a simple output filter could help  solve
       the scale problem above.  If the script is named <u>conformable</u>, running

       $ conformable 3.75g | grep 0.120

       gives

               3.75g = 0.1205653 apounce
               3.75g = 0.1205653 fineounce
               3.75g = 0.1205653 ozt
               3.75g = 0.1205653 tradewukiyeh
               3.75g = 0.1205653 troyounce

       So we might conclude that the scale is calibrated in troy ounces.

       We might run

       $ units --verbose are
               Definition: 100 m^2 = 100 m^2

       and wonder if ‘are’ has any synonyms, value.  To find out, we could run

       $ conformable are | grep "= 1 "
               are = 1 a
               are = 1 are

</pre><h4><b>OUTPUT</b> <b>STYLES</b></h4><pre>
       The  output can be tweaked in various ways using command line options.  With no options, the output looks
       like this

       $ units
       Currency exchange rates from FloatRates (USD base) on 2023-07-08
       3612 units, 109 prefixes, 122 nonlinear units
       You have: 23ft
       You want: m
               * 7.0104
               / 0.14264521
       You have: m
       You want: ft;in
               3 ft + 3.3700787 in

       This is arguably a bit cryptic; the ‘--verbose’ option makes clear what the output means:

       $ units --verbose
       Currency exchange rates from FloatRates (USD base) on 2023-07-08
       3612 units, 109 prefixes, 122 nonlinear units
       You have: 23 ft
       You want: m
               23 ft = 7.0104 m
               23 ft = (1 / 0.14264521) m
       You have: meter
       You want: ft;in
               meter = 3 ft + 3.3700787 in

       The ‘--quiet’ option suppresses the clutter displayed when <u>units</u> starts, as well as the  prompts  to  the
       user.  This option is enabled by default when you give units on the command line.

       $ units --quiet
       23 ft
       m
               * 7.0104
               / 0.14264521
       $ units 23ft m
               * 7.0104
               / 0.14264521

       The  remaining  style  options  allow  you  to  display  only  numerical  values  without  the tab or the
       multiplication and division signs, or to display just a single line showing the forward conversion:

       $ units --compact 23ft m
       7.0104
       0.14264521
       $ units --compact m 'ft;in'
       3;3.3700787
       $ units --one-line 23ft m
               * 7.0104
       $ units --one-line 23ft 1/m
               reciprocal conversion
               * 0.14264521
       $ units --one-line 23ft kg
       conformability error
               7.0104 m
               1 kg

       Note that when converting to a unit list, the ‘--compact’ option displays a semicolon separated  list  of
       results.   Also  be  aware  that  the  ‘one-line’  option  doesn't  live  up to its name if you execute a
       reciprocal conversion or if you get a conformability error.  The former case can be prevented  using  the
       ‘--strict’  option,  which  suppresses  reciprocal  conversions.   Similarly  you  can suppress unit list
       conversion using ‘--nolists’.  It is impossible to prevent the three line error output.

       $ units --compact --nolists m 'ft;in'
       Error in 'ft;in': Parse error
       $ units --one-line --strict 23ft 1/m

       The various style options can be combined appropriately.   The  ultimate  combination  is  the  ‘--terse’
       option,  which  combines  ‘--strict’,  ‘--quiet’,  ‘--one-line’,  and  ‘--compact’ to produce the minimal
       output, just a single number for regular conversions and a semicolon separated  list  for  conversion  to
       unit  lists.   This  will likely be the best choice for programs that want to call <u>units</u> and then process
       its result.

       $ units --terse 23ft m
       7.0104
       $ units --terse m 'ft;in'
       3;3.3700787
       $ units --terse 23ft 1/m
       conformability error
       7.0104 m
       1 / m
       $ units --terse '1 mile'
       1609.344 m
       $ units --terse mile
       5280 ft = 1609.344 m

</pre><h4><b>ADDING</b> <b>YOUR</b> <b>OWN</b> <b>DEFINITIONS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Units</b> <b>Data</b> <b>Files</b>
       The units  and  prefixes  that  <u>units</u>  can  convert  are  defined  in  the  units  data  file,  typically
       ‘/usr/share/units/definitions.units’.    If  you  can’t  find  this  file,  run  units --version  to  get
       information on the file locations for your installation.  Although you can extend  or  modify  this  data
       file  if you have appropriate user privileges, it’s usually better to put extensions in separate files so
       that the definitions will be preserved if you update <u>units</u>.

       You can include additional data files in the units database using the ‘!include’ command in the  standard
       units data file. For example

       !include    /usr/local/share/units/local.units

       might be appropriate for a site-wide supplemental data file.  The location of the ‘!include’ statement in
       the  standard units data file is important; later definitions replace earlier ones, so any definitions in
       an included file will override definitions before the ‘!include’ statement in  the  standard  units  data
       file.   With normal invocation, no warning is given about redefinitions; to ensure that you don’t have an
       unintended redefinition, run units -c after making changes to any units data file.

       If you want to add your own units in addition to or in place of standard or site-wide supplemental  units
       data  files, you can include them in the ‘.units’ file in your home directory.  If this file exists it is
       read after the standard units data file, so that any definitions in this file will replace definitions of
       the same units in the standard data file or in files included from the standard  data  file.   This  file
       will not be read if any units files are specified on the command line.  (Under Windows the personal units
       file  is  named  ‘unitdef.units’.)   Running units -V will display the location and name of your personal
       units file.

       The <u>units</u> program first tries to determine your home directory from the HOME  environment  variable.   On
       systems  running  Microsoft  Windows,  if HOME does not exist, <u>units</u> attempts to find your home directory
       from HOMEDRIVE, HOMEPATH and USERPROFILE.  You can specify an arbitrary file as your personal units  data
       file  with  the  MYUNITSFILE  environment  variable;  if  this variable exists, its value is used without
       searching your home directory.  The default units data files are described in more detail in <u>Data</u> <u>Files</u>.

   <b>Defining</b> <b>New</b> <b>Units</b> <b>and</b> <b>Prefixes</b>
       A unit is specified on a single line by giving its name and an equivalence.  Comments start  with  a  ‘#’
       character,  which  can  appear  anywhere in a line.  The backslash character (‘\’) acts as a continuation
       character if it appears as the last character on a line, making it possible  to  spread  definitions  out
       over  several  lines if desired.  A file can be included by giving the command ‘!include’ followed by the
       file’s name.  The ‘!’ must be the first character on the line.  The file  will  be  sought  in  the  same
       directory  as  the  parent  file unless you give a full path.  The name of the file to be included cannot
       contain spaces or the comment character ‘#’.

       Unit names cannot begin or end with an underscore (‘_’), a comma (‘,’) or a decimal point  (‘.’).   Names
       must  not  contain  any  of  the  operator characters ‘+’, ‘-’, ‘*’, ‘/’, ‘|’, ‘^’, ‘;’, ‘~’, the comment
       character ‘#’, or parentheses.  To facilitate copying and pasting from documents,  several  typographical
       characters  are  converted to operators: the figure dash (U+2012), minus (‘-’; U+2212), and en dash (‘–’;
       U+2013) are converted to the operator ‘-’; the multiplication sign (‘×’; U+00D7),  N-ary  times  operator
       (U+2A09), dot operator (‘⋅’; U+22C5), and middle dot (‘·’; U+00B7) are converted to the operator ‘*’; the
       division  sign  (‘÷’;  U+00F7)  is  converted  to  the  operator  ‘/’; and the fraction slash (U+2044) is
       converted to the operator ‘|’; accordingly, none of these characters can appear in unit names.

       Names cannot begin with a digit, and if a name ends in a digit other than zero or one, the digit must  be
       preceded  by  a  string  beginning  with an underscore, and afterwards consisting only of digits, decimal
       points, or commas.  For example, ‘foo_2’, ‘foo_2,1’, or ‘foo_3.14’ are valid names but ‘foo2’ or ‘foo_a2’
       are invalid.  The underscore is necessary because without it, <u>units</u> cannot determine whether ‘foo2’ is  a
       unit  name  or  represents  ‘foo^2’.   Zero and one are exceptions because <u>units</u> never interprets them as
       exponents.

       You could define nitrous oxide as

       N2O     nitrogen 2  + oxygen

       but would need to define nitrogen dioxide as

       NO_2    nitrogen + oxygen 2

       Be careful to define new units in terms of old ones so that a reduction leads  to  the  primitive  units,
       which  are  marked  with  ‘!’   characters.   Dimensionless  units  are  indicated  by  using  the string
       ‘!dimensionless’ for the unit definition.

       When adding new units, be sure to use the ‘-c’ option to check that the new  units  reduce  properly  and
       that  there  are  no circular definitions that lead to endless loops.  Because some errors may hide other
       errors, you should run <u>units</u> with the ‘-c’ option again after correcting any errors, and  keep  doing  so
       until no errors are displayed.

       If  you  define  any units that contain ‘+’ characters in their definitions, carefully check them because
       the ‘-c’ option will not catch non-conformable sums.  Be careful with the ‘-’  operator  as  well.   When
       used  as  a  binary  operator,  the ‘-’ character can perform addition or multiplication depending on the
       options used to invoke <u>units</u>.  To ensure consistent behavior use ‘-’ only as a  unary  negation  operator
       when  writing  units definitions.  To multiply two units leave a space or use the ‘*’ operator with care,
       recalling that it has two possible precedence values and may require  parentheses  to  ensure  consistent
       behavior.  To compute the difference of ‘foo’ and ‘bar’ write ‘foo+(-bar)’ or even ‘foo+-bar’.

       You may wish to intentionally redefine a unit.  When you do this, and use the ‘-c’ option, <u>units</u> displays
       a  warning  message about the redefinition.  You can suppress these warnings by redefining a unit using a
       ‘+’ at the beginning of the unit name.  Do not include any white space between the ‘+’ and the  redefined
       unit name.

       Here is an example of a short data file that defines some basic units:

       m       !               # The meter is a primitive unit
       sec     !               # The second is a primitive unit
       rad     !dimensionless  # A dimensionless primitive unit
       micro-  1e-6            # Define a prefix
       minute  60 sec          # A minute is 60 seconds
       hour    60 min          # An hour is 60 minutes
       inch    72 m            # Inch defined incorrectly terms of meters
       ft      12 inches       # The foot defined in terms of inches
       mile    5280 ft         # And the mile
       +inch   0.0254 m        # Correct redefinition, warning suppressed

       A  unit  that ends with a ‘-’ character is a prefix.  If a prefix definition contains any ‘/’ characters,
       be sure they are protected by parentheses.   If  you  define  ‘half-  1/2’,  then  ‘halfmeter’  would  be
       equivalent to ‘1 / (2 meter)’.

   <b>Defining</b> <b>Nonlinear</b> <b>Units</b>
       Some  unit  conversions  of  interest  are  nonlinear;  for  example, temperature conversions between the
       Fahrenheit and Celsius scales cannot be done by simply multiplying by conversion factors.

       When you give a linear unit definition such as ‘inch 2.54 cm’ you are providing  information  that  <u>units</u>
       uses  to  convert  values  in  inches  into  primitive  units of meters.  For nonlinear units, you give a
       functional definition that provides the same information.

       Nonlinear units are represented using a functional notation.  It is best to regard this notation not as a
       function call but as a way of adding units to a number, much the same way that writing a linear unit name
       after a number adds units to that number.  Internally, nonlinear units are defined by a pair of functions
       that convert to and from linear units in the database, so that an eventual conversion to primitive  units
       is possible.

       Here is an example nonlinear unit definition:

       tempF(x) units=[1;K] domain=[-459.67,) range=[0,) \
                   (x+(-32)) degF + stdtemp ; (tempF+(-stdtemp))/degF + 32

       A  nonlinear  unit definition comprises a unit name, a formal parameter name, two functions, and optional
       specifications for units, the domain, and the range (the domain of the inverse function).  The  functions
       tell  <u>units</u>  how  to  convert to and from the new unit.  To produce valid results, the arguments of these
       functions need to have the correct dimensions and be within the  domains  for  which  the  functions  are
       defined.

       The  definition  begins  with the unit name followed immediately (with no spaces) by a ‘(’ character.  In
       the parentheses is the name of the formal parameter.  Next is an  optional  specification  of  the  units
       required  by  the  functions  in  the  definition.  In the example above, the ‘units=[1;K]’ specification
       indicates that the ‘tempF’ function requires an input argument conformable with ‘1’ (i.e.,  the  argument
       is  dimensionless),  and  that the inverse function requires an input argument conformable with ‘K’.  For
       normal nonlinear units definition, the forward function will always take  a  dimensionless  argument;  in
       general,  the  inverse  function will need units that match the quantity measured by your nonlinear unit.
       Specifying the units enables <u>units</u> to perform error checking on function arguments, and  also  to  assign
       units to domain and range specifications, which are described later.

       Next the function definitions appear.  In the example above, the ‘tempF’ function is defined by

       tempF(x) = (x+(-32)) degF + stdtemp

       This  gives a rule for converting ‘x’ in the units ‘tempF’ to linear units of absolute temperature, which
       makes it possible to convert from tempF to other units.

       To enable conversions to Fahrenheit, you must give a rule for the inverse conversions.  The inverse  will
       be ‘x(tempF)’ and its definition appears after a ‘;’ character.  In our example, the inverse is

       x(tempF) = (tempF+(-stdtemp))/degF + 32

       This  inverse  definition takes an absolute temperature as its argument and converts it to the Fahrenheit
       temperature.  The inverse can be omitted by leaving out the ‘;’ character and the inverse definition, but
       then conversions <u>to</u> the unit will not be possible.  If the inverse definition is omitted,  the  ‘--check’
       option  will  display  a warning.  It is up to you to calculate and enter the correct inverse function to
       obtain proper conversions; the ‘--check’ option tests the inverse at one point and prints an error if  it
       is not valid there, but this is not a guarantee that your inverse is correct.

       With some definitions, the units may vary.  For example, the definition

       square(x)       x^2

       can  have any arbitrary units, and can also take dimensionless arguments.  In such a case, you should <u>not</u>
       specify units.  If a definition takes a root of its arguments, the definition is  valid  only  for  units
       that yield such a root.  For example,

       squirt(x)       sqrt(x)

       is valid for a dimensionless argument, and for arguments with even powers of units.

       Some definitions may not be valid for all real numbers.  In such cases, <u>units</u> can handle errors better if
       you specify an appropriate domain and range.  You specify the domain and range as shown below:

       baume(d) units=[1;g/cm^3] domain=[0,130.5] range=[1,10] \
                (145/(145-d)) g/cm^3 ; (baume+-g/cm^3) 145 / baume

       In  this example the domain is specified after ‘domain=’ with the endpoints given in brackets.  In accord
       with mathematical convention,  square  brackets  indicate  a  closed  interval  (one  that  includes  its
       endpoints),  and  parentheses  indicate  an  open interval (one that does not include its endpoints).  An
       interval can be open or closed on one or both ends; an interval  that  is  unbounded  on  either  end  is
       indicated  by  omitting  the limit on that end.  For example, a quantity to which decibel (dB) is applied
       may have any value greater than zero, so the range is indicated by ‘(0,)’:

       decibel(x) units=[1;1] range=(0,) 10^(x/10); 10 log(decibel)

       If the domain or range is given, the second endpoint must be greater than the first.

       The domain and range specifications can appear independently and  in  any  order  along  with  the  units
       specification.   The  values  for  the  domain and range endpoints are attached to the units given in the
       units specification, and if necessary, the parameter value is adjusted for comparison with the endpoints.
       For example, if a definition includes ‘units=[1;ft]’ and ‘range=[3,)’, the range will be taken as 3 ft to
       infinity.  If the  function  is  passed  a  parameter  of  ‘900 mm’,  that  value  will  be  adjusted  to
       2.9527559 ft,  which  is  outside  the  specified  range.   If  you omit the units specification from the
       previous example, <u>units</u> can not tell whether you intend the lower endpoint to be 3 ft or 3 microfurlongs,
       and can not adjust the parameter value of 900 mm for comparison.  Without units, numerical  values  other
       than  zero  or plus or minus infinity for domain or range endpoints are meaningless, and accordingly they
       are not allowed.  If you give other values without units, then the definition will  be  ignored  and  you
       will get an error message.

       Although  the  units, domain, and range specifications are optional, it’s best to give them when they are
       applicable; doing so allows <u>units</u> to perform better error checking and give more helpful error  messages.
       Giving  the  domain  and range also enables the ‘--check’ option to find a point in the domain to use for
       its point check of your inverse definition.

       You can make synonyms for nonlinear units by providing both the forward and  inverse  functions;  inverse
       functions can be obtained using the ‘~’ operator.  So to create a synonym for ‘tempF’ you could write

       fahrenheit(x) units=[1;K] tempF(x); ~tempF(fahrenheit)

       This is useful for creating a nonlinear unit definition that differs slightly from an existing definition
       without having to repeat the original functions.  For example,

       dBW(x)     units=[1;W] range=[0,) dB(x) W ;  ~dB(dBW/W)

       If  you  wish  a  synonym to refer to an existing nonlinear unit without modification, you can do so more
       simply by adding the synonym with appended parentheses as a new unit, with the existing  nonlinear  unit—
       without parentheses—as the definition.  So to create a synonym for ‘tempF’ you could write

       fahrenheit()  tempF

       The definition must be a nonlinear unit; for example, the synonym

       fahrenheit()  meter

       will result in an error message when <u>units</u> starts.

       You  may  occasionally  wish  to  define  a  function  that  operates on units.  This can be done using a
       nonlinear unit definition.  For example, the definition below provides conversion between radius and  the
       area  of  a  circle.   This  definition  requires  a  length  as input and produces an area as output, as
       indicated by the ‘units=’ specification.  Specifying the range as the  nonnegative  numbers  can  prevent
       cryptic error messages.

       circlearea(r) units=[m;m^2] range=[0,)   pi r^2 ; sqrt(circlearea/pi)

   <b>Defining</b> <b>Piecewise</b> <b>Linear</b> <b>Units</b>
       Sometimes  you  may  be interested in a piecewise linear unit such as many wire gauges.  Piecewise linear
       units can be defined by specifying conversions to linear units on a list of points.  Conversion at  other
       points will be done by linear interpolation.  A partial definition of zinc gauge is

       zincgauge[in] 1 0.002, 10 0.02, 15 0.04, 19 0.06, 23 0.1

       In  this example, ‘zincgauge’ is the name of the piecewise linear unit.  The definition of such a unit is
       indicated by the embedded ‘[’ character.  After the bracket, you should indicate the units to be attached
       to the numbers in the table.  No spaces can appear before the ‘]’ character, so a definition like ‘foo[kg
       meters]’ is invalid; instead write ‘foo[kg*meters]’.  The definition of the unit consists of  a  list  of
       pairs  optionally  separated  by  commas.  This list defines a function for converting from the piecewise
       linear unit to linear units.  The first item in each pair is the function argument; the  second  item  is
       the  value  of  the  function at that argument (in the units specified in brackets).  In this example, we
       define ‘zincgauge’ at five points.  For example, we set ‘<a href="../man1/zincgauge.1.html">zincgauge</a>(1)’ equal to ‘0.002 in’.   Definitions
       like this may be  more readable  if written using  continuation characters as

       zincgauge[in] \
            1 0.002  \
           10 0.02   \
           15 0.04   \
           19 0.06   \
           23 0.1

       With the preceding definition, the following conversion can be performed:

       You have: <a href="../man10/zincgauge.10.html">zincgauge</a>(10)
       You want: in
           * 0.02
           / 50
       You have: .01 inch
       You want: zincgauge
           5

       If  you  define a piecewise linear unit that is not strictly monotonic, then the inverse will not be well
       defined.  If the inverse is requested for such a unit, <u>units</u> will return the smallest inverse.

       After adding nonlinear units definitions, you should normally run ‘units --check’ to  check  for  errors.
       If  the  ‘units’  keyword  is  not given, the ‘--check’ option checks a nonlinear unit definition using a
       dimensionless argument, and then checks using an arbitrary combination of units, as well  as  the  square
       and cube of that combination; a warning is given if any of these tests fail.  For example,

       Warning: function 'squirt(x)' defined as 'sqrt(x)'
                failed for some test inputs:
                squirt(7(kg K)^1): Unit not a root
                squirt(7(kg K)^3): Unit not a root

       Running  ‘units --check’  will  print  a warning if a non-monotonic piecewise linear unit is encountered.
       For example, the relationship between ANSI coated abrasive designation and mean  particle  size  is  non-
       monotonic in the vicinity of 800 grit:

       ansicoated[micron] \
            . . .
           600 10.55 \
           800 11.5 \
           1000 9.5 \

       Running ‘units --check’ would give the error message

       Table 'ansicoated' lacks unique inverse around entry 800

       Although  the  inverse  is not well defined in this region, it’s not really an error.  Viewing such error
       messages can be tedious, and if there are enough of them, they can  distract  from  true  errors.   Error
       checking  for  nonlinear  unit  definitions  can  be  suppressed by giving the ‘noerror’ keyword; for the
       examples above, this could be done as

       squirt(x) noerror domain=[0,) range=[0,) sqrt(x); squirt^2
       ansicoated[micron] noerror \
            . . .

       Use the ‘noerror’ keyword with caution.  The safest approach after adding a nonlinear unit definition  is
       to run ‘units --check’ and confirm that there are no actual errors before adding the ‘noerror’ keyword.

   <b>Defining</b> <b>Unit</b> <b>List</b> <b>Aliases</b>
       Unit  list aliases are treated differently from unit definitions, because they are a data entry shorthand
       rather than a true definition for a new unit.  A unit list alias definition begins with  ‘!unitlist’  and
       includes the alias and the definition;  for example, the aliases included in the standard units data file
       are

       !unitlist   hms     hr;min;sec
       !unitlist   time    year;day;hr;min;sec
       !unitlist   dms     deg;arcmin;arcsec
       !unitlist   ftin    ft;in;1|8 in
       !unitlist   usvol   cup;3|4 cup;2|3 cup;1|2 cup;1|3 cup;1|4 cup;\
                           tbsp;tsp;1|2 tsp;1|4 tsp;1|8 tsp

       Unit  list  aliases are only for unit lists, so the definition must include a ‘;’.  Unit list aliases can
       never be combined with units or other unit list aliases, so the definition of ‘time’  shown  above  could
       <u>not</u> have been shortened to ‘year;day;hms’.

       As  usual,  be  sure  to  run  ‘units --check’  to  ensure that the units listed in unit list aliases are
       conformable.

</pre><h4><b>NUMERIC</b> <b>OUTPUT</b> <b>FORMAT</b></h4><pre>
       By default, units shows results to eight significant digits in general number  format.   You  can  change
       this  with the ‘--exponential’, ‘--digits’, and ‘--output-format’ options.  The first sets an exponential
       format (i.e., scientific notation) like that used in the original Unix <u>units</u> program, the  second  allows
       you  to  specify  a different number of significant digits, and the last allows you to control the output
       appearance using the format for the printf function in the C programming language.  If you only  want  to
       change  the  number  of  significant  digits  or  specify exponential format type, use the ‘--digits’ and
       ‘--exponential’ options.  The ‘--output-format’  option  affords  the  greatest  control  of  the  output
       appearance,  but requires at least rudimentary knowledge of the printf format syntax.  See <u>Invoking</u> <u>Units</u>
       for descriptions of these options.

   <b>Format</b> <b>Specification</b>
       The format specification recognized with the ‘--output-format’ option is a subset  of  that  for  printf.
       The  format  specification has the form %[<u>flags</u>][<u>width</u>][.<u>precision</u>]<u>type</u>; it must begin with ‘%’, and must
       end with a floating-point type specifier: ‘g’ or ‘G’ to specify the number of significant digits, ‘e’  or
       ‘E’  for  scientific  notation, and ‘f’ for fixed-point decimal.  The ISO C99 standard added the ‘F’ type
       for fixed-point decimal and the ‘a’ and ‘A’ types for hexadecimal floating point; these types are allowed
       with compilers that support them.  Type length modifiers (e.g.,  ‘L’  to  indicate  a  long  double)  are
       inapplicable and are not allowed.

       The default format for <u>units</u> is ‘%.8g’; for greater precision, you could specify ‘-o %.15g’.  The ‘g’ and
       ‘G’  format  types  use  exponential  format  whenever  the  exponent would be less than -4, so the value
       0.000013 displays as ‘1.3e-005’.  These types also use exponential notation when the exponent is  greater
       than or equal to the precision, so with the default format, the value 5 × 10^7 displays as ‘50000000’ and
       the value 5 × 10^8 displays as ‘5e+008’.  If you prefer fixed-point display, you might specify ‘-o %.8f’;
       however, small numbers will display very few significant digits, and values less than 5 × 10^-8 will show
       nothing but zeros.

       The  format specification may include one or more optional flags: ‘+’, ‘ ’ (space), ‘#’, ‘-’, or ‘0’ (the
       digit zero).  The digit-grouping flag ‘'’ is allowed with compilers that support it.  Flags are  followed
       by  an  optional  value  for the minimum field width, and an optional precision specification that begins
       with a period (e.g., ‘.6’).  The field width includes the digits, decimal point, the exponent,  thousands
       separators (with the digit-grouping flag), and the sign if any of these are shown.

   <b>Flags</b>
       The  ‘+’  flag  causes  the output to have a sign (‘+’ or ‘-’).  The space flag ‘ ’ is similar to the ‘+’
       flag, except that when the value is positive, it is prefixed with a space rather than a plus  sign;  this
       flag  is ignored if the ‘+’ flag is also given.  The ‘+’ or ‘ ’ flag could be useful if conversions might
       include positive and negative results, and  you  wanted  to  align  the  decimal  points  in  exponential
       notation.   The ‘#’ flag causes the output value to contain a decimal point in all cases; by default, the
       output contains a decimal point only if there are digits (which can be trailing zeros) to  the  right  of
       the point.  With the ‘g’ or ‘G’ types, the ‘#’ flag also prevents the suppression of trailing zeros.  The
       digit-grouping flag ‘'’ shows a thousands separator in digits to the left of the decimal point.  This can
       be useful when displaying large numbers in fixed-point decimal; for example, with the format ‘%f’,

       You have: mile
       You want: microfurlong
               * 8000000.000000
               / 0.000000

       the  magnitude of the first result may not be immediately obvious without counting the digits to the left
       of the decimal point.  If the thousands separator is the comma (‘,’), the output with  the  format  ‘%'f’
       might be

       You have: mile
       You want: microfurlong
               * 8,000,000.000000
               / 0.000000

       making the magnitude readily apparent.  Unfortunately, few compilers support the digit-grouping flag.

       With  the  ‘-’ flag, the output value is left aligned within the specified field width.  If a field width
       greater than needed to show the output value is specified, the ‘0’ (zero) flag causes the output value to
       be left padded with zeros until the specified field width  is  reached;  for  example,  with  the  format
       ‘%011.6f’,

       You have: troypound
       You want: grain
               * 5760.000000
               / 0000.000174

       The ‘0’ flag has no effect if the ‘-’ (left align) flag is given.

   <b>Field</b> <b>Width</b>
       By default, the output value is left aligned and shown with the minimum width necessary for the specified
       (or  default)  precision.   If  a  field  width  greater than this is specified, the value shown is right
       aligned, and padded on the left with enough spaces  to  provide  the  specified  field  width.   A  width
       specification  is typically used with fixed-point decimal to have columns of numbers align at the decimal
       point; this arguably is less useful with <u>units</u> than with long columnar output,  but  it  may  nonetheless
       assist in quickly assessing the relative magnitudes of results.  For example, with the format ‘%12.6f’,

       You have: km
       You want: in
               * 39370.078740
               /     0.000025
       You have: km
       You want: rod
               *   198.838782
               /     0.005029
       You have: km
       You want: furlong
               *     4.970970
               /     0.201168

   <b>Precision</b>
       The  meaning  of  “precision”  depends  on  the format type.  With ‘g’ or ‘G’, it specifies the number of
       significant digits (like the ‘--digits’ option); with ‘e’, ‘E’, ‘f’, or ‘F’,  it  specifies  the  maximum
       number of digits to be shown after the decimal point.

       With the ‘g’ and ‘G’ format types, trailing zeros are suppressed, so the results may sometimes have fewer
       digits  than  the  specified  precision  (as  indicated  above,  the ‘#’ flag causes trailing zeros to be
       displayed).

       The default precision is 6, so ‘%g’ is equivalent to ‘%.6g’, and would show the output to six significant
       digits.  Similarly, ‘%e’ or ‘%f’ would show the output with six digits after the decimal point.

       The C printf function allows a precision of arbitrary  size,  whether  or  not  all  of  the  digits  are
       meaningful.   With  most compilers, the maximum internal precision with <u>units</u> is 15 decimal digits (or 13
       hexadecimal digits).  With the ‘--digits’ option, you are limited to the maximum internal precision; with
       the ‘--output-format’ option, you may  specify  a  precision  greater  than  this,  but  it  may  not  be
       meaningful.  In some cases, specifying excess precision can result in rounding artifacts.  For example, a
       pound is exactly 7000 grains, but with the format ‘%.18g’, the output might be

       You have: pound
       You want: grain
               * 6999.9999999999991
               / 0.00014285714285714287

       With the format ‘%.25g’ you might get the following:

       You have: 1/3
       You want:
               Definition: 0.333333333333333314829616256247

       In  this  case  the  displayed  value  includes  a  series of digits that represent the underlying binary
       floating-point approximation to 1/3 but are not meaningful for the desired computation.  In general,  the
       result  with excess precision is system dependent.  The precision affects only the <u>display</u> of numbers; if
       a result relies on physical constants that are not known  to  the  specified  precision,  the  number  of
       physically meaningful digits may be less than the number of digits shown.

       See the documentation for printf for more detailed descriptions of the format specification.

       The  ‘--output-format’  option  is  incompatible  with  the ‘--exponential’ or ‘--digits’ options; if the
       former is given in combination with either of the latter, the format is controlled  by  the  last  option
       given.

</pre><h4><b>LOCALIZATION</b></h4><pre>
       Some  units  have different values in different locations.  The localization feature accommodates this by
       allowing a units data file to specify definitions that depend on the user’s locale.

   <b>Locale</b>
       A locale is a subset of a user’s environment that indicates the user’s language  and  country,  and  some
       attendant  preferences,  such  as  the  formatting of dates.  The <u>units</u> program attempts to determine the
       locale from the POSIX setlocale function;  if  this  cannot  be  done,  <u>units</u>  examines  the  environment
       variables  LC_CTYPE and LANG.  On POSIX systems, a locale is of the form <u>language</u>_<u>country</u>, where <u>language</u>
       is the two-character code from ISO 639-1 and <u>country</u> is the two-character code from ISO 3166-1;  <u>language</u>
       is lower case and <u>country</u> is upper case. For example, the POSIX locale for the United Kingdom is en_GB.

       On  systems  running  Microsoft  Windows, the value returned by setlocale is different from that on POSIX
       systems; <u>units</u> attempts to map the Windows value to a POSIX value  by  means  of  a  table  in  the  file
       ‘locale_map.txt’  in  the  same  directory  as  the other data files.  The file includes entries for many
       combinations of  language  and  country,  and  can  be  extended  to  include  other  combinations.   The
       ‘locale_map.txt’ file comprises two tab-separated columns; each entry is of the form

            <u>Windows-locale</u>   <u>POSIX-locale</u>

       where  <u>POSIX-locale</u>  is as described above, and <u>Windows-locale</u> typically spells out both the language and
       country.  For example, the entry for the United States is

       English_United States   en_US

       You can force <u>units</u> to run in a desired locale by using the ‘-l’ option.

       In order to create unit definitions for a particular locale you begin a block of definitions  in  a  unit
       datafile with ‘!locale’ followed by a locale name.  The ‘!’ must be the first character on the line.  The
       <u>units</u>  program  reads the following definitions only if the current locale matches.  You end the block of
       localized units with ‘!endlocale’.  Here is an example, which defines the British gallon.

       !locale en_GB
       gallon       4.54609 liter
       !endlocale

   <b>Additional</b> <b>Localization</b>
       Sometimes  the  locale  isn’t  sufficient  to  determine  unit  preferences.   There  could  be  regional
       preferences,  or  a  company could have specific preferences.  Though probably uncommon, such differences
       could arise with the choice of English customary units outside of English-speaking countries.  To address
       this, <u>units</u> allows specifying definitions that depend on environment variable settings.  The  environment
       variables  can  be controlled based on the current locale, or the user can set them to force a particular
       group of definitions.

       A conditional block of definitions in a units data file begins with either ‘!var’ or ‘!varnot’  following
       by  an  environment variable name and then a space separated list of values.  The leading ‘!’ must appear
       in the first column of a units  data  file,  and  the  conditional  block  is  terminated  by  ‘!endvar’.
       Definitions  in  blocks  beginning  with  ‘!var’ are executed only if the environment variable is exactly
       equal to one of the listed values.  Definitions in blocks beginning with ‘!varnot’ are executed  only  if
       the environment variable does <u>not</u> equal any of the list values.

       The inch has long been a customary measure of length in many places.  The word comes from the Latin <u>uncia</u>
       meaning  “one  twelfth,”  referring to its relationship with the foot.  By the 20th century, the inch was
       officially defined in English-speaking countries relative to the yard, but until 1959, the yard  differed
       slightly  among those countries.  In France the customary inch, which was displaced in 1799 by the meter,
       had a different length based on a french foot.  These customary  definitions  could  be  accommodated  as
       follows:

       !var INCH_UNIT usa
       yard          3600|3937 m
       !endvar
       !var INCH_UNIT canada
       yard          0.9144 meter
       !endvar
       !var INCH_UNIT uk
       yard          0.91439841 meter
       !endvar
       !var INCH_UNIT canada uk usa
       foot          1|3 yard
       inch          1|12 foot
       !endvar
       !var INCH_UNIT france
       foot          144|443.296 m
       inch          1|12 foot
       line          1|12 inch
       !endvar
       !varnot INCH_UNIT usa uk france canada
       !message Unknown value for INCH_UNIT
       !endvar

       When <u>units</u> reads the above definitions it will check the environment variable INCH_UNIT and load only the
       definitions  for  the appropriate section.  If INCH_UNIT is unset or is not set to one of the four values
       listed, then <u>units</u> will run the last block.  In this case that  block  uses  the  ‘!message’  command  to
       display a warning message.  Alternatively that block could set default values.

       In  order  to create default values that are overridden by user settings the data file can use the ‘!set’
       command, which sets an environment variable <u>only</u> <u>if</u> <u>it</u> <u>is</u> <u>not</u> <u>already</u> <u>set</u>;  these settings are  only  for
       the  current  <u>units</u>  invocation  and  do  not  persist.   So  if the example above were preceded by ‘!set
       INCH_UNIT france’, then this would make ‘france’ the default value for INCH_UNIT.  If the  user  had  set
       the variable in the environment before invoking <u>units</u>, then <u>units</u> would use the user’s value.

       To  link  these  settings to the user’s locale you combine the ‘!set’ command with the ‘!locale’ command.
       If you wanted to combine the above example with suitable locales you could  do  by  <u>preceding</u>  the  above
       definition with the following:

       !locale en_US
       !set INCH_UNIT usa
       !endlocale
       !locale en_GB
       !set INCH_UNIT uk
       !endlocale
       !locale en_CA
       !set INCH_UNIT canada
       !endlocale
       !locale fr_FR
       !set INCH_UNIT france
       !endlocale
       !set INCH_UNIT france

       These  definitions  set  the  overall  default  for INCH_UNIT to ‘france’ and set default values for four
       locales appropriately.  The overall default setting comes last so that it only applies when INCH_UNIT was
       not set by one of the other commands or by the user.

       If the variable given after ‘!var’ or ‘!varnot’ is undefined, then <u>units</u>  prints  an  error  message  and
       ignores  the  definitions  that  follow.   Use  ‘!set’  to create defaults to prevent this situation from
       arising.  The ‘-c’ option only checks the definitions that are active for  the  current  environment  and
       locale,  so when adding new definitions take care to check that all cases give rise to a well defined set
       of definitions.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>units</u> program uses the following environment variables:

       <b>HOME</b>   Specifies the location of your home directory; it is used by <u>units</u> to find a personal  units  data
              file  ‘.units’.   On  systems  running Microsoft Windows, the file is ‘unitdef.units’, and if HOME
              does not exist, <u>units</u> tries to determine your home  directory  from  the  HOMEDRIVE  and  HOMEPATH
              environment  variables; if these variables do not exist, units finally tries USERPROFILE—typically
              ‘C:\Users\<u>username</u>’  (Windows  Vista  and   Windows 7)   or   ‘C:\Documents and Settings\<u>username</u>’
              (Windows XP).

       <b>LC_CTYPE,</b> <b>LANG</b>
              Checked  to determine the locale if <u>units</u> cannot obtain it from the operating system.  Sections of
              the default main units data file are specific to certain locales.

       <b>MYUNITSFILE</b>
              Specifies your personal units data file.  If this variable exists, <u>units</u>  uses  its  value  rather
              than  searching  your  home directory for ‘.units’.  The personal units file will not be loaded if
              any data files are given using the ‘-f’ option.

       <b>PAGER</b>  Specifies the pager to use for help and for displaying the conformable units.  The  help  function
              browses  the  units  database  and  calls  the  pager using the ‘+n’<u>n</u> syntax for specifying a line
              number.  The default pager is <u>more</u>; PAGER can be used to specify alternatives such  as  <u>less</u>,  <u>pg</u>,
              <u>emacs</u>, or <u>vi</u>.

       <b>UNITS_ENGLISH</b>
              Set  to  either ‘US’ or ‘GB’ to choose United States or British volume definitions, overriding the
              default from your locale.

       <b>UNITSFILE</b>
              Specifies the units data file to use (instead of the default).  You  can  only  specify  a  single
              units  data  file  using  this environment variable.  If units data files are given using the ‘-f’
              option, the file specified by UNITSFILE will be not be loaded unless the ‘-f’ option is given with
              the empty string (‘units -f ""’).

       <b>UNITSLOCALEMAP</b>
              Windows only; this variable has no effect on Unix-like systems.  Specifies the  units  locale  map
              file to use (instead of the default).  This variable seldom needs to be set, but you can use it to
              ensure  that  the  locale map file will be found if you specify a location for the units data file
              using either the ‘-f’ option or the UNITSFILE environment variable, and  that  location  does  not
              also contain the locale map file.

       <b>UNITS_SYSTEM</b>
              This environment variable is used in the default main data file to select CGS measurement systems.
              Currently  supported  systems  are  ‘esu’, ‘emu’, ‘gauss[ian]’, ‘hlu’, ‘natural’, ‘natural-gauss’,
              ‘planck’, ‘planck-red’, ‘hartree’ and ‘si’.  The default is ‘si’.

</pre><h4><b>DATA</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>units</u> program uses four default data files: the  main  data  file,  ‘definitions.units’;  the  atomic
       masses  of the elements, ‘elements.units’; currency exchange rates, ‘currency.units’, and the US Consumer
       Price Index, ‘cpi.units’.  The last three files are loaded by means of ‘!include’ directives in the  main
       file  (see  <u>Database</u>  <u>Command</u>  <u>Syntax</u>).   The  program  can also use an optional personal units data file
       ‘.units’ (‘unitdef.units’ under Windows) located in the user’s home directory.  The personal  units  data
       file is described in more detail in <u>Units</u> <u>Data</u> <u>Files</u>.

       On  Unix-like  systems,  the  data files are typically located in ‘/usr/share/units’ if <u>units</u> is provided
       with the operating  system,  or  in  ‘/usr/local/share/units’  if  <u>units</u>  is  compiled  from  the  source
       distribution.  Note that the currency file ‘currency.units’ is a symbolic link to another location.

       On  systems  running  Microsoft Windows, the files may be in the same locations if Unix-like commands are
       available, a Unix-like file structure is present (e.g., ‘C:<a href="file:/usr/local">/usr/local</a>’), and <u>units</u> is compiled  from  the
       source   distribution.    If   Unix-like   commands   are  not  available,  a  more  common  location  is
       ‘C:\Program Files (x86)\GNU\units’ (for 64-bit  Windows  installations)  or  ‘C:\Program Files\GNU\units’
       (for 32-bit installations).

       If  <u>units</u>  is  obtained  from  the  GNU  Win32  Project (<a href="http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/">http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/</a>), the files are
       commonly in ‘C:\Program Files\GnuWin32\share\units’.

       If the default main units data file is not an absolute pathname, <u>units</u> will look  for  the  file  in  the
       directory that contains the <u>units</u> program; if the file is not found there, <u>units</u> will look in a directory
       ../share/units relative to the directory with the <u>units</u> program.

       You  can  determine  the location of the files by running ‘units --version’.  Running ‘units --info’ will
       give you additional information about the files, how <u>units</u> will attempt to find them, and the  status  of
       the related environment variables.

</pre><h4><b>UNICODE</b> <b>SUPPORT</b></h4><pre>
       The  standard  units  data  file  is  in  Unicode, using UTF-8 encoding.  Most definitions use only ASCII
       characters (i.e., code points U+0000 through U+007F); definitions using non-ASCII  characters  appear  in
       blocks beginning with ‘!utf8’ and ending with ‘!endutf8’.

       The non-ASCII definitions are loaded only if the platform and the locale support UTF-8.  Platform support
       is determined when <u>units</u> is compiled; the locale is checked at every invocation of <u>units</u>.  To see if your
       version of <u>units</u> includes Unicode support, invoke the program with the ‘--version’ option.

       When  Unicode  support is available, <u>units</u> checks every line within UTF-8 blocks in all of the units data
       files for invalid or non-printing UTF-8 sequences; if such sequences  occur,  <u>units</u>  ignores  the  entire
       line.   In  addition  to checking validity, <u>units</u> determines the display width of non-ASCII characters to
       ensure proper positioning of the pointer in some error messages and to align columns for the ‘search’ and
       ‘?’ commands.

       Microsoft Windows supports UTF-8 in console applications  running  in  Windows  Terminal;  UTF-8  is  not
       supported  in applications running in the older Windows Console Host—see <u>Unicode</u> <u>Support</u> <u>on</u> <u>Windows</u>.  The
       UTF-16 and UTF-32 encodings are not supported on any platforms.

       If Unicode support is available and definitions that contain non-ASCII UTF-8 characters are  added  to  a
       units  data  file, those definitions should be enclosed within ‘!utf8’ ... ‘!endutf8’ to ensure that they
       are only loaded when Unicode support is available.  As usual, the ‘!’ must appear as the first  character
       on the line.  As discussed in <u>Units</u> <u>Data</u> <u>Files</u>, it’s usually best to put such definitions in supplemental
       data files linked by an ‘!include’ command or in a personal units data file.

       When  Unicode  support is not available, <u>units</u> makes no assumptions about character encoding, except that
       characters in the range 00–7F hexadecimal correspond to ASCII encoding.  Non-ASCII characters are  simply
       sequences  of bytes, and have no special meanings; for definitions in supplementary units data files, you
       can use any encoding consistent with this  assumption.   For  example,  if  you  wish  to  use  non-ASCII
       characters  in  definitions when running <u>units</u> under Windows, you can use a character set such as Windows
       “ANSI” (code page 1252 in the US and Western Europe); if this is done, the console code page must be  set
       to  the  same  encoding  for  the  characters  to  display properly.  You can even use UTF-8, though some
       messages may be improperly aligned, and <u>units</u> will not detect invalid UTF-8 sequences.  If you use  UTF-8
       encoding  when  Unicode  support  is  not  available,  you  should  place  any definitions with non-ASCII
       characters <u>outside</u> ‘!utf8’ ... ‘!endutf8’ blocks—otherwise, they will be ignored.

       Except for code examples, typeset material usually uses the Unicode symbols for  mathematical  operators.
       To  facilitate  copying  and pasting from such sources, several typographical characters are converted to
       the ASCII operators used in <u>units</u>: the figure dash (U+2012), minus  (‘-’;  U+2212),  and  en  dash  (‘–’;
       U+2013)  are  converted  to the operator ‘-’; the multiplication sign (‘×’; U+00D7), N-ary times operator
       (U+2A09), dot operator (‘⋅’; U+22C5), and middle dot (‘·’; U+00B7) are converted to the operator ‘*’; the
       division sign (‘÷’; U+00F7) is converted to  the  operator  ‘/’;  and  the  fraction  slash  (U+2044)  is
       converted to the operator ‘|’.

   <b>Unicode</b> <b>Support</b> <b>on</b> <b>Windows</b>
       Microsoft  Windows  supports  UTF-8  in  console  applications  running  in  Windows  Terminal but not in
       applications running in the older Windows Console Host.  In Windows Terminal, the code page must  be  set
       to 65001 for UTF-8 to be enabled.  With the UTF-8 code page, running units -V might show

       GNU Units version 2.24
       Without readline, with UTF-8, locale English_United States (en_US)

       Two values are shown for the locale: the first is the one returned by the system; the second is the POSIX
       value to which the system value is mapped.

       With a different code page, the result might be

       GNU Units version 2.24
       Without readline, with UTF-8 (disabled), locale English_United States (en_US)
       To enable UTF-8: set code page to 65001

       If <u>units</u> is running in Windows Console Host, regardless of the code page, the result might be

       GNU Units version 2.24
       Without readline, with UTF-8 (disabled), locale English_United States (en_US)
       To enable UTF-8: run in Windows Terminal and set code page to 65001

       The UTF-8 code page can be set by running chcp 65001.

       As of late 2024, the Windows build of <u>units</u> does not identify characters—typically East Asian—that occupy
       more than one column, and error messages involving those characters may not be properly aligned.

</pre><h4><b>READLINE</b> <b>SUPPORT</b></h4><pre>
       If  the  <u>readline</u>  package  has been compiled in, then when <u>units</u> is used interactively, numerous command
       line editing features are available.  To check if your version of <u>units</u>  includes  <u>readline</u>,  invoke  the
       program with the ‘--version’ option.

       For complete information about <u>readline</u>, consult the documentation for the <u>readline</u> package.  Without any
       configuration,  <u>units</u>  will  allow  editing  in the style of emacs.  Of particular use with <u>units</u> are the
       completion commands.

       If you type a few characters and then hit <u>ESC</u> followed by <u>?</u>, then <u>units</u> will display a list  of  all  the
       units  that  start with the characters typed.  For example, if you type <u>metr</u> and then request completion,
       you will see something like this:

       You have: metr
       metre             metriccup         metrichorsepower  metrictenth
       metretes          metricfifth       metricounce       metricton
       metriccarat       metricgrain       metricquart       metricyarncount
       You have: metr

       If there is a unique way to complete a unit name, you can hit the <u>TAB</u> key and <u>units</u> will provide the rest
       of the unit name.  If <u>units</u> beeps, it means that there is no unique completion.  Pressing the <u>TAB</u>  key  a
       second time will print the list of all completions.

       The  readline  library  also  keeps a history of the values you enter.  You can move through this history
       using the up and down arrows.  The history is saved to the file ‘.units_history’ in your  home  directory
       so  that  it  will  persist  across  multiple  <u>units</u> invocations.  If you wish to keep work for a certain
       project separate you can change the history filename  using  the  ‘--history’  option.   You  could,  for
       example,  make  an  alias  for  <u>units</u> to units --history .units_history so that <u>units</u> would save separate
       history in the current directory.  The length of each history file is limited to 5000 lines.   Note  also
       that if you run several concurrent copies of <u>units</u> each one will save its new history to the history file
       upon exit.

</pre><h4><b>UPDATING</b> <b>CURRENCY</b> <b>EXCHANGE</b> <b>RATES</b> <b>AND</b> <b>CPI</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Currency</b> <b>Exchange</b> <b>Rates</b>
       The units program database includes currency exchange rates and prices for some precious metals.  Of
       course, these values change over time, sometimes very rapidly, and <u>units</u> cannot provide real-time values.
       To update the exchange rates, run <u>units_cur</u>, which rewrites the file containing the currency rates,
       typically ‘/var/lib/units/currency.units’ or ‘/usr/local/com/units/currency.units’ on a Unix-like system
       or ‘C:\Program Files (x86)\GNU\units\definitions.units’ on a Windows system.

       This  program  requires  Python  3  (https://www.python.org).   The  program  must  be  run with suitable
       permissions to write the file.  To keep the rates updated automatically, run it using a  cron  job  on  a
       Unix-like system, or a similar scheduling program on a different system.

       Reliable  free  sources of currency exchange rates have been annoyingly ephemeral.  The program currently
       supports several sources:

        •  ExchangeRate-API.com (https://www.exchangerate-api.com).
           The default currency server.  Allows open access without an API key,  with  unlimited  API  requests.
           Rates  update once a day, the US dollar (‘USD’) is the default base currency, and you can choose your
           base currency with the ‘-b’ option described below.  You can optionally sign up for  an  API  key  to
           access paid benefits such as faster data update rates.

        •  FloatRates (https://www/floatrates.com).
           The  US  dollar (‘USD’) is the default base currency.  You can change the base currency with the ‘-b’
           option described below.  Allowable base currencies are listed on the  FloatRates  website.   Exchange
           rates update daily.

        •  The European Central Bank (https://www.ecb.europa.eu).
           The  base  currency  is  always the euro (‘EUR’).  Exchange rates update daily.  This source offers a
           more limited list of currencies than the others.

        •  Fixer (https://fixer.io).
           Registration for a free API key is required.  With a  free  API  key,  base  currency  is  the  euro;
           exchange  rates  are  updated  hourly,  the service has a limit of 1,000 API calls per month, and SSL
           encryption (https protocol) is not available.  Most of these restrictions are eliminated  or  reduced
           with paid plans.

        •  open exchange rates (https://openexchangerates.org).
           Registration  for  a  free  API  key  is  required.  With a free API key, the base currency is the US
           dollar; exchange rates are updated hourly, and there is a limit of 1,000 API calls per  month.   Most
           of these restrictions are eliminated or reduced with paid plans.

       The default source is FloatRates; you can select a different one using ‘-s’ option described below.

       Precious  metals  pricing  is  obtained from Packetizer (www.packetizer.com).  This site updates once per
       day.

   <b>US</b> <b>Consumer</b> <b>Price</b> <b>Index</b>
       The <u>units</u> program includes the US Consumer Price  Index  (CPI)  published  by  the  US  Bureau  of  Labor
       Statistics:  specifically,  the  Consumer  Price  Index  for  All Urban Consumers (CPI-U), not seasonally
       adjusted—Series CUUR0000SA0.  The <u>units_cur</u> command updates the CPI and saves the result  in  ‘cpi.units’
       in  the  same  location  as  ‘currency.units’.   The  data  are  obtained  via  the  BLS  Public Data API
       (https://www.bls.gov/developers/).  These data update once a month.  When <u>units_cur</u>  runs  it  will  only
       attempt  to  update the CPI data if the current CPI data file is from a previous month, or if the current
       date is after the 18th of the month.

   <b>Invoking</b> <u><b>units_cur</b></u>
       You invoke <u>units_cur</u> like this:

       units_cur [<u>options</u>] [<u>currency_file</u>] [<u>cpi_file</u>]

       By default, the output is written to the default currency and CPI files described above; this is  usually
       what  you  want, because this is where <u>units</u> looks for the files.  If you wish, you can specify different
       filenames on the command line and <u>units_cur</u> will write the data to those files.  If you give  ‘-’  for  a
       file it will write to standard output.

       The following options are available:

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
              Print a summary of the options for <u>units_cur</u>.

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--version</b>
              Print the <u>units_cur</u> version number.

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b>
              Give slightly more verbose output when attempting to update currency exchange rates.

       <b>-s</b> <u>source</u>, <b>--source</b> <u>source</u>
              Specify  the  source for currency exchange rates; currently supported values are ‘floatrates’ (for
              FloatRates),  ‘eubank’   (for   the   European   Central   Bank),   ‘fixer’   (for   Fixer),   and
              ‘openexchangerates’  (for  open  exchange rates); the last two require an API key to be given with
              the ‘-k’ option.

       <b>-b</b> <u>base</u>, <b>--base</b> <u>base</u>
              Set the base currency (when allowed by the site providing the data).  <u>base</u> should  be  a  3-letter
              ISO  currency  code, e.g., ‘USD’.  The specified currency will be the primitive currency unit used
              by <u>units</u>.  You may find it convenient to specify your local currency.   Conversions  may  be  more
              accurate  and  you  will  be  able  to  convert  to  your  currency by simply hitting <u>Enter</u> at the
              ‘You want:’ prompt.  This option is ignored if the source  does  not  allow  specifying  the  base
              currency.  (Currently only floatrates supports this option.)

       <b>-k</b> <u>key</u>, <b>--key</b> <u>key</u>
              Set the API key to <u>key</u> for currency sources that require it.

       <b>--blskey</b> <u>BLSkey</u>
