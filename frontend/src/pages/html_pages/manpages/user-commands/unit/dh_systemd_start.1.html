       dh_systemd_start - start/stop/restart systemd unit files

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>dh_systemd_start</b> [<u>debhelper</u> <u>options</u>] [<b>--restart-after-upgrade</b>] [<b>--no-stop-on-upgrade</b>] [<u>unit</u> <u>file</u> ...]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>dh_systemd_start</b> is a debhelper program that is responsible for starting/stopping or restarting systemd
       unit files in case no corresponding sysv init script is available.

       As with <b>dh_installinit</b>, the unit file is stopped before upgrades and started afterwards (unless
       <b>--restart-after-upgrade</b> is specified, in which case it will only be restarted after the upgrade).  This
       logic is not used when there is a corresponding SysV init script because invoke-rc.d performs the
       stop/start/restart in that case.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--restart-after-upgrade</b>
           Do  not  stop  the unit file until after the package upgrade has been completed.  This is the default
           behaviour in compat 10.

           In earlier compat levels the default was to stop the unit file in the <u>prerm</u>, and start  it  again  in
           the <u>postinst</u>.

           This  can be useful for daemons that should not have a possibly long downtime during upgrade. But you
           should make sure that the daemon will not get confused by  the  package  being  upgraded  while  it's
           running before using this option.

       <b>--no-restart-after-upgrade</b>
           Undo  a  previous  <b>--restart-after-upgrade</b>  (or  the  default of compat 10).  If no other options are
           given, this will cause the service to be stopped in  the  <u>prerm</u>  script  and  started  again  in  the
           <u>postinst</u> script.

       <b>-r</b>, <b>--no-stop-on-upgrade</b>, <b>--no-restart-on-upgrade</b>
           Do not stop service on upgrade.

       <b>--no-start</b>
           Do not start the unit file after upgrades and after initial installation (the latter is only relevant
           for services without a corresponding init script).

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       Note that this command is not idempotent. <b><a href="../man1/dh_prep.1.html">dh_prep</a></b>(1) should be called between invocations of this command
       (with  the  same  arguments).  Otherwise, it may cause multiple instances of the same text to be added to
       maintainer scripts.

       Note that <b>dh_systemd_start</b> should be run after <b>dh_installinit</b> so that it can  detect  corresponding  SysV
       init  scripts.  The  default sequence in <b>dh</b> does the right thing, this note is only relevant when you are
       calling <b>dh_systemd_start</b> manually.
