</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       metalint - a metaconfig unit consistency checker

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>metalint</b> [ -<b>hklsV</b> ] [ -<b>L</b> <u>dir</u> ]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Metalint</u>  parses  the units and performs some extensive consistency checks, to make sure the whole set is
       sound. Due to the relatively huge amount of units available, it is becoming very  difficult  to  maintain
       the units manually, and an automated process can be of real help, although not perfect.

       <u>Metalint</u>  operates from within your top level package directory and is used to make sure your own private
       units are correctly relying on the publicly available units.  If you intensively develop new  units,  you
       should run <u>metalint</u> on them before making them publicly available.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Metalint</u> recognizes the following set of options:

       <b>-h</b>             Print a short usage description and exit.

       <b>-k</b>             Keep temporary <u>.MT</u> directory.

       <b>-l</b>             (not  implemented  yet)  By  default,  <u>metalint</u>  only reports problems related to your own
                      private units. This switch directs <u>metalint</u> to also report problems in publicly  available
                      units.

       <b>-s</b>             Silent mode.

       <b>-L</b> <u>dir</u>         Override  default  library  location.  Normally  only useful for metaconfig maintainers to
                      locally check the units being developed instead of the publicly available  ones.  The  <u>dir</u>
                      specified is the one containing the units <u>U</u> directory.

       <b>-V</b>             Print version number and exit.

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       The following diagnostics may be emitted by <u>metalint</u>:

       "(?MAKE) command line must start with a leading TAB character."
            Self explanatory.

       "(?MAKE) fourth pick argument is missing."
            Self explanatory.

       "(?MAKE) fourth pick argument should probably be the %&lt; macro."
            When  the  fourth argument is not a relative path, it is expected to be the current unit name, which
            is best described using the "%&lt;" string, a macro handled by <u>metaconfig</u> and which is substituted with
            the current unit name.

       "(?MAKE) ignoring duplicate dependency listing line."
            More than one ?MAKE: line bearing dependencies was found in the unit. There may  be  only  one  such
            line, although multiple ?MAKE action lines may occur.

       "(?MAKE) special unit 'Xxx' should not be listed as made."
            A  special  unit  symbol  (first  letter capitalized) may only be listed as made in the special unit
            itself. To suppress this warning in legitimate cases, add a '+' in front  of  the  offending  symbol
            (note that for non-special units, the '+' in this position indicates an internal symbol which should
            not appear in the config.sh file).

       "(?MAKE) '+xxx' is listed x times."
            A conditional dependency is listed more than once. This is harmless though.

       "(?MAKE) 'xxx' is listed x times."
            A normal depdendency is listed more than once. Again, an harmless error.

       "(?MAKE) 'xxx' listed as both conditional and full dependency."
            Symbol  is listed as a normal dependency and as a conditional one.  <u>Metaconfig</u> will consider this as
            being a full dependency, but that may not be what you initially wanted...

       "(?MAKE) pick needs a command argument."
            There is no command name after the special "pick" directive, which is invalid.

       "(?MAKE) third pick argument must be $@.
            The third argument to the special "pick" directive must be $@, litterally.

       "(?MAKE) unknown pick command 'xxx'.
            The command argument listed for the special "pick" directive is unknown.

       "(?MAKE) weird fourth argument 'xxx' to pick.
            The fourth argument for pick, the target file, should be a unit name, a file path introduced by "./"
            or the special "%&lt;" token.

       "(?Y) unknown layout directive 'xxx'."
            Layout directives may only be one of <u>top</u>, <u>default</u> or <u>bottom</u>, but case does not  matter.  An  unknown
            directive is just ignored and handled as if <u>default</u> had been specified.

       "(?S) duplicate description for variable '$xxx'."
            Shell symbol is described more than once, and that will produce two entries in the Glossary.

       "(?S) variable '$xxx' is not listed on ?MAKE: line."
            The  unit  describes  a  shell  symbol  entry  which cannot be used externally since not listed as a
            dependency.

       "(?S) syntax error in ?S: construct."
            Self explanatory.

       "(?C) duplicate description for symbol 'XXX'."
            C symbol is described more than once, and that will produce two entries for it in the Glossary.

       "(?C) syntax error in ?C: construct."
            Self explanatory.

       "(?H) symbol 'XXX' was already defined."
            Apparently, two ?H: lines are defining the same C symbol.

       "(?H) variable '$xxx' not even listed on ?MAKE: line."
            A variable is used, but not listed on the dependency line.

       "(?H) section was already terminated by '?H:.'."
            There can be no more ?H: lines after the first '?H:.' marking the end of that section.

       "(?H) uncommon cpp line should be protected with '?%&lt;:'."
            All ?H: lines that are recognized by <u>metaconfig</u> and thus <u>metalint</u> have their inclusion  in  config.h
            automatically  protected by a suitable symbol if none is provided.  However, unrecognized lines must
            be protected with the '?%&lt;:' sequence to avoid their inclusion should the  unit  not  be  loaded  in
            Configure.

       "(?H) line should not be listed here but in '?C:'."
            Only cpp lines should appear in the ?H: section.  If you have a comment to put regarding the symbol,
            use ?C:.  If you want to comment a particular generation sequence, put them into ?X: comment so that
            they don't make it into config.h.

       "(?H) constraint 'xxx' is an unknown symbol."
            All  the  leading ?sym: constraints on the ?H: lines should be a valid shell or C symbol, defined in
            the unit.

       "(?M) syntax error in ?M: construct."
            Self explanatory.

       "(?M) symbol 'xxx' already listed on a ?M: line in 'yyy'."
            A magic definition for symbol xxx is attempted, but another one was already provided in unit yyy.

       "(?V) visible declaration in non-special unit ignored."
            Visible declarations (?V: lines) may only appear in special units. Otherwise, they are meaningless.

       "(?V) wanted variable '$xxx' made visible."
            A wanted variable (described as a dependency on the ?MAKE: line) cannot be made visible  since  that
            does  not  make  any  sense:  the  unit  cannot  depend on it and then advertise it as being locally
            defined.

       "(?V) defined variable '$xxx' made visible."
            A defined variable (listed as made on the ?MAKE: line) cannot be made visible,  since  it  could  as
            well be directly wanted in another unit.

       "(?V) variable '$xxx' already made visible by unit yyy."
            Inconsistent declaration: two units are making one single symbol visible...

       "(?V) variable '$xxx' already read-write visible in yyy."
            The variable was already made visible as read-write by another unit.

       "(?V) variable '$xxx' already read-only visible in yyy."
            The variable was already made visible as read-only by another unit.

       "(?W) variable '$xxx' already wanted."
            Variable is already wanted, there is no need to explicitly ask for it here.

       "(?W) variable '$xxx' also locally defined."
            A  wanted  variable  would  conflict  with  a locally defined variable and could result in getting a
            garbage value.

       "(?W) variable '$xxx' already listed on a ?W: line in 'yyy'."
            The variable in the shell symbol section of a ?W: line can only appear in one unit.

       "(?F) produced file 'xxx' mutiply declared."
            The file is listed more than once on the ?F: line, under the same name.  This does not  appear  when
            declaring both a private UU file and a public file with the same name, for instance.

       "(?F) UU file 'xxx' in non-special unit ignored."
            Private UU files (i.e. files like the <u>myread</u> script created for later perusal by <u>Configure</u>) may only
            be  created  in  special  units.   Exceptions allowed if the ?F: line is preceded by a proper ?LINT:
            hint.

       "(?F) file 'xxx' already exported by yyy.U."
            The listed file 'xxx' is already reported exported (listed likewise) in the other unit yyy.U and  is
            conflicting.  An exported file is a generated file above the UU directory.

       "(?F) UU file 'xxx' already created by yyy.U."
            The  listed  file  'xxx'  is already created in the UU directory by the other unit yyy.U.  A created
            file is listed as ./xxx on the ?F: line.

       "(?T) temporary symbol '$xxx' multiply declared."
            Self explanatory.

       "directive should come after ?MAKE declarations."
            The directive listed between () at the beginning of this message should really come after the ?MAKE:
            lines.  You must reorder the unit or <u>metalint</u> will not be able to properly diagnose problems.

       "control sequence '?XXX:' ignored within body."
            Attempt to use a control line other than ?X: or ?LINT: in the unit body, which should be only  shell
            code

       "variable '$xxx' is changed."
            A  variable  listed as wanted in the dependency line is changed. Such a variable should be read-only
            for the unit. Use the <u>change</u> lint hint to suppress this message in pathological cases.

       "no ?MAKE: line describing dependencies."
            Every unit should have a dependency line, or it will be silently ignored by <u>metaconfig</u>. This message
            is suppressed by a ?LINT: empty hint.

       "first body line should be a general ': description'."
            The very first shell line of the unit that will be added to the generated  Configure  script  should
            hold a description of the unit's purpose, on a ':' line.  There must be a space after the ':', since
            it  is  interpreted  by  the shell, and the description should avoid meta-characters like '(' or '&gt;'
            unless the whole string is quoted.  This message is suppressed by a ?LINT: nocomment hint.

       "missing space after ':' to make it a comment."
            A line starting by ':' is interpreted by the shell but will be ignored.  There must be a space after
            the ':' though, or the shell will try to execute an unknown command...

       "found unquoted meta-character &gt; on comment line."
            A line starting by ':' is interpreted by the shell but will be ignored.  This means that  meaningful
            meta-characters such as '(' or '&gt;' must be quoted or escaped with a leading backslash.

       "found dangling quote on ':' comment line."
            An  unclosed  single  or  double  quote  was  spotted  on a ':' comment line.  Since those lines are
            interpreted by the shell, albeit ignored, all quotes must match perfectly.

       "not ending with a blank line."
            Since all units are gathered together to form one big script, it is recommended (hence  enforced  by
            <u>metalint</u>) that every unit file end with an empty line.

       "last line not ending with a new-line character."
            This  is  merely intended to users whose editor does not always append a new-line at the end of text
            files. Should not happen when you use <u>vi</u>.

       "symbol '$xxx' was not described."
            The shell symbol defined by this unit was not documented. Use the <u>describe</u>  lint  hint  to  suppress
            this message.

       "C symbol 'XXX' was not described."
            The  C  symbol  defined  by  this  unit was not documented. Use the <u>known</u> lint hint to suppress this
            message.

       "C symbol 'XXX' was not defined by any ?H: line."
            A C symbol was advertised by never defined, hence it cannot appear  in  the  <u>config.h</u>  file  and  is
            therefore useless...

       "variable '$xxx' should have been set."
            A  variable  listed on the make line as made by the unit was not set by the shell code body. Use the
            <u>set</u> lint hint to suppress this message in pathological cases.

       "unused dependency variable '$xxx'."
            Apparently no usage is made from a shell variable. Use the <u>change</u> or <u>use</u> lint  hints  (depending  on
            the situation) to suppress this message.

       "unused conditional variable '$xxx'.
            Apparently  no  usage  is made from this conditional dependency. The <u>change</u> or <u>use</u> lint hints can be
            used to suppress this message.

       "unused temporary variable '$xxx'."
            A variable declared as temporary in a ?T: line is not used. The <u>use</u> lint  hint  will  fool  <u>metalint</u>
            into thinking it's indeed used.

       "unknown control sequence '?XXX:'."
            Attempt to use an unknown control sequence.

       "unknown LINT request 'false' ignored."
            An unknown ?LINT: tag was used. All such tags must be spelled out in lowercase.

       "symbol '$xxx' has no default value."
            A symbol used as a conditional dependency in some unit has no default value set by a ?D: line.

       "stale ?MAKE: dependency 'xxx'."
            Unit  lists  a  symbol as a dependency, but that symbol is otherwise unknown, i.e.  never appears as
            made by any other unit.

       "symbol '$xxx' missing from ?MAKE."
            A symbol used or defined was not listed as a dependency in the ?MAKE: line.

       "missing xxx from ?MAKE for visible '$yyy'."
            A symbol defined as visible by a special unit is used, but that special unit  is  not  part  of  the
            dependency line.

       "stale ?M: dependency 'xxx'."
            Magic line lists a C symbol as a dependency but that symbol is not known by any unit.

       "unknown symbol '$xxx'."
            I  have no idea about what this symbol is. If the variable is externally define, this warning can be
            suppresed via a proper ?LINT: extern.

       "read-only symbol '$xxx' is set."
            A symbol that should be read-only is set by the unit's shell code body.

       "obsolete symbol 'xxx' is used."
            An obsolete symbol is used in the unit's shell code.

       "undeclared symbol '$xxx' is set."
            The unit tries to set a shell variable which has not  been  otherwise  declared  as  made  or  as  a
            temporary variable, or whatever.

       "unclosed ?H: section."
            The  ?H: section was not terminated by a single '?H:.' line before the body of the unit or the start
            of another ?C: section.

       "C symbol 'xxx' is defined in the following units:"
            The C symbol is defined in more that one unit. Offending units are listed.

       "Shell symbol 'xxx' is defined in the following units:"
            A shell symbol is defined in more than one unit. Offending units folllow.

       "Shell symbol 'xxx' is altogether:"
            A shell symbol is defined by some units, obsoleted by others and used as a temporary.

       "Shell symbol 'xxx' is both defined and obsoleted:"
            Self explanatory.

       "Shell symbol 'xxx' is both defined and used as temporary:"
            Self explanatory.

       "Shell symbol 'xxx' obsoleted also used as temporary:"
            Self explanatory.

       "definition of '$xxx' not closed by '?S:.'."
            Self explanatory.

       "definition of 'XXX' not closed by '?C:.'."
            Self explanatory.

       "magic definition of 'xxx' not closed by '?M:.'."
            Self explanatory.

       "variable '$xxx' is defined externally."
            A variable defined externally (i.e. in another unit) is used, without proper dependency information.
            Use the <u>extern</u> lint hint to suppress this message.

       "file 'xxx' was not created."
            A file listed as a private UU file is not created by the special  unit.   Creation  is  detected  by
            seing  an  explicit  shell  redirection  to  the  file,  not  by  an  implicit creation (such as a C
            compilation would for instance).  All special units should  create  only  shell  scripts  explicitly
            anyway so this message cannot be suppressed via a lint hint.

       "local file 'xxx' may override the one set by 'unit.U'."
            You  are  attempting to create a local file, but the special unit creates one bearing the exact same
            name and should it be loaded before within <u>Configure</u>, you would override that file. Change the  name
            of your local file.

       "unused temporary file 'xxx'.
            The file was declared on the ?F: line but does not appear to be used anywhere.

       "mis-used temporary file 'xxx'.
            A  local  temporary  file has been declared on the ?F: line and is used in a way that may not be the
            proper one. Indeed, all such local files should be called with an explicit relative path,  to  avoid
            PATH lookups which could get you another file.

       "you might not always get file 'xxx' from 'unit.U'."
            You  seem  to be calling the specified file, but not by using an explicit relative pathname. Relying
            on the PATH to find this file is not safe.  To fix this problem, call your file using somthing  like
            <u>./xxx</u>.

       "missing Unit from ?MAKE for private file 'xxx'."
            You are using a private UU file without listing the special unit that produces it in your dependency
            line. Add the unit to your dependency list.

       "unknown private file 'xxx'."
            The file does not appear on any ?F: line; however it should.

       "File 'xxx' is defined in the following units:"
            The listed units cannot seem to agree on who is defining the file.

       "empty here-document name discouraged."
            You should refrain from using empty names for here documents, as <u>metalint</u> will not monitor those.

       "unclosed here-document xxx started line x."
            The opened here-document at line x was never closed in this unit.  This generally mean that when the
            unit is used, the generated script will not work!

       "spurious 'LINT xxx' directive."
            You have inserted a ?LINT: directive that is not used to shut-up warnings.

       "Cycle found for:"
            There is a dependency cycle found for the symbols listed. Only the symbols involved in the cycle are
            listed.

       "Cycle involves:"
            An exerpt of the dependencies where the cycle was found is listed. This may involve far more symbols
            than  the  previous  message, because <u>metalint</u> actually rescans the rules to emphasize the cycle and
            stops whenever it has found one, i.e. it does not try to minimize  it  (the  cycle  is  found  using
            another algorithm, which unfortunately cannot spit it out but only say for sure there is one).

</pre><h4><b>REFERENCE</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Metalint</u> uses the following control lines, which are otherwise ignored by <u>metaconfig</u>:

       ?V:<u>read-only</u> <u>symbols</u>:<u>read-write</u> <u>symbols</u>
            This  line should be used only in special units. It lists all the shell variable defined by the unit
            which should not be used directly as dependencies by other units: they  must  include  this  special
            unit  in  their  dependency list if they make use of any of the symbols described here. Those can be
            viewed as exported symbols which you inherit from when depending from  the  unit.   Symbols  may  be
            exported read-only or read-write.

       ?F:<u>files</u> <u>created</u>
            This  line  serves two purposes: it is a <u>metalint</u> hint, and also a placeholder for future <u>jmake</u> use.
            It must list three kind of files: the temporary one which are created for a  test,  the  private  UU
            ones  created  in the UU directory for later perusal, and the public ones left in the root directory
            of the package. Temporary files must be listed with a preceding '!' character (meaning "no!  they're
            not  re-used  later!"),  private  UU  files  should be preceded by a './' (meaning: to use them, say
            <u>./file</u>, not just <u>file</u>), and public ones should be named as-is.

       ?T:<u>shell</u> <u>temporaries</u>
            This line should list all the shell variables used as temporaries within the unit's body. This  line
            should  be kept accurate, and prevents you from writing a unit defining a symbol which would be used
            as a scratch variable in another unit...
