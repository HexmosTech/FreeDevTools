              <u>...]</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This  program takes one or more movie files in any format that <u>mplayer</u> understands and converts them into
       a DVD compatible format.  This program automatically scales the movies so that  they  will  appear  full-
       screen  when  viewed  on  a  television  set  in combination with a standalone DVD player.  Normally, the
       program produces two files for each input file, one for video and one for audio, but there is  an  option
       to  make  the  program  produce  finished  (multiplexed)  VOB  files  for you.  The program takes care of
       framerate changes and audio adjustment.

       Nearly everything is done automatically: the program can determine the value of all the needed parameters
       automatically, except for the destination video type, which is either NTSC or PAL.  Therefore,  the  only
       option that you usually specify is the <b>-m</b> option.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The following options are available:

       <b>-r</b> <b>resolution</b>
              Specify the DVD resolution.  Possibilities are:
              PAL: <b>720x576</b>, <b>704x576</b>, <b>352x576</b> and <b>352x288</b>
              NTSC: <b>720x480</b>, <b>704x480</b>, <b>352x480</b> and <b>352x240</b>

              You may specify <b>auto</b> (which is the default for this option) for automatic selection.  If you leave
              out  this option or specify the value <b>auto</b>, you <u>must</u> supply a <b>-m</b> option to tell the system whether
              you want PAL or NTSC.  If you specify a value other than <b>auto</b>, you may leave out the <b>-m</b> option, as
              the system will infer which mode you want automatically.

              The value that you specify may not conflict with a specific mode that you might set using  the  <b>-m</b>
              option; for example, you cannot specify <b>-r</b> <b>720x576</b> and then later specify <b>-m</b> <b>ntsc</b>.

       <b>-d</b> <b>display</b>
              Specify  how  the video is to be fitted into the available screen size, either <b>letterbox</b> (which is
              the default for this option), which loses no information but may introduce black borders on either
              the top and the bottom or the left and the right sides of the screen, or <b>panscan</b>, which fills  the
              entire screen but possibly chops off edges of the video image.

       <b>-f</b> <b>method</b>
              Specify  how  to  change  the  movie to adjust its framerate if necessary.  You may specify either
              <b>auto</b>, <b>video</b>, <b>audio</b>.

              <b>video</b> will duplicate or drop frames to adjust the framerate (which will make the  movie  jerky  in
              some situations), and will keep the audio as it is.

              <b>audio</b>  will adjust the pitch of the audio track so that it runs synchronized with the movie if the
              movie would be played slightly faster  or  slower  than  normal  because  it's  new  framerate  is
              different from the original.

              <b>auto</b>  will  make  the choice for you.  The choice that is made depends on the source video and the
              destination parameters that you are encoding to.

       <b>-a</b> <b>aspect</b>
              Specify either <b>16:9</b> (widescreen), <b>4:3</b> (traditional TV set) or <b>auto</b> (which is the default for  this
              option), which chooses the correct value from the source video automatically.

       <b>-A</b> <b>src_aspect</b>
              Specify  the  aspect ratio of the source if it is not encoded correctly in the source.  The format
              is <b>X:Y</b>, for example <b>4:3</b> or <b>41:18</b>.  The numbers used may be floating point, so that  you  may  also
              use  aspect  ratios  like  <b>1.25:1</b>  or  <b>1.77:1</b>.   Or  you  may specify <b>auto</b> (default) for automatic
              detection from the source.

       <b>-m</b> <b>mode</b>
              Specify either <b>pal</b> (European and other non-US regions), <b>ntsc</b> (United States) or <b>auto</b> (which is the
              default for this option).  <b>auto</b> is only allowed if you specify a specific resolution using the  <b>-r</b>
              option, otherwise the system will not be able to infer which mode you want.

              The  value  that  you specify may not conflict with a specific resolution that you might set using
              the <b>-r</b> option; for example, you cannot specify <b>-r</b> <b>720x576</b> and then later specify <b>-m</b> <b>ntsc</b>.

       <b>-c</b> <b>audio_codec</b>
              Specify either <b>mp2</b> (two channel audio, supported by PAL DVD players), <b>ac3</b>  (Dolby  Digital  sound,
              supported  by  all DVD players) or <b>auto</b> (which is the default for this option and currently always
              chooses <b>ac3</b>).

              According to the DVD standard, NTSC DVD players are required to support AC3, but not MP2.  PAL DVD
              players are required to support MP2 and AC3.

       <b>-q</b> <b>quality</b>
              Select either <b>low</b>, <b>normal</b> (which is the default for this option) <b>high</b> or  a  numeric  bitrate  (in
              kilobits per second).

              <b>low</b>  encodes  the video using a maximum bitrate of 3500 kilobits per second, <b>normal</b> uses a maximum
              of 6000 kilobits per second and <b>high</b> uses a maximum of 8000 kilobits  per  second.   Specifying  a
              number uses that number as the maximum bitrate in kilobits per second.

       <b>-Q</b> <b>bitrate</b>
              Select  either  <b>auto</b>  (which is the default for this option) or a numeric bitrate (in kilobits per
              second).

              <b>auto</b> automatically chooses an appropriate bitrate for the audio output,  depending  on  the  audio
              output  format and the number of channels.  You may also specify a numeric bitrate in kilobits per
              second, such as 224, 384 or 448.  If you choose to override the audio bitrate, you should probably
              combine this option with the <b>-c</b> option to override the audio  output  format  as  well,  to  avoid
              unexpected results.

       <b>-o</b> <b>output_dir</b>
              Writes the results of the conversion into the specified directory instead of in the same directory
              as where the sources are located.  If you use this option and the sources include directory names,
              those  directories will be removed from the source name before using the name to determine what to
              call the result in the output directory.

       <b>-M</b>     Multiplex the output audio and video together, which means that each source file will be converted
              into a DVD-compatible <b>.vob</b> file.  If you do not specify this, a <b>.m2v</b>  (which  contains  the  video
              part)  and  a  <b>.mp2</b> (for stereo audio) or <b>.ac3</b> (for AC3 surround audio) file will be generated for
              each input movie.

              The program <b><a href="../man1/movie-title.1.html">movie-title</a></b>(1) (which is used to create DVDs with menus) can use both the <b>.vob</b> and the
              <b>.m2v</b> format, although the default (two generated files per source) is faster because less disk I/O
              is involved.

       <b>-b</b>     This tells <u>mplayer</u> that any AVI headers that are encountered are broken and that  they  should  be
              ignored  when determining the audio-video sync delay.  This activates <u>mplayer</u>'s <b>-nobps</b> option (see
              <u>mplayer</u>'s manual for details).

       <b>-O</b> <b>options</b>
              You may specify any options for <u>mplayer</u> that are needed  to  decode  the  movie(s)  that  you  are
              converting  correctly.   You  normally  don't  need  to use this option unless the source movie is
              broken in some respect.  Be sure to quote the options correctly so that they will  appear  as  one
              string  to  this option.  Type the options as you would normally do to play the movie correctly on
              an <b>mplayer</b> command line.

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       If this program is called with a incorrect set of parameters, it will print a diagnostic message  telling
       the  user  what  went wrong.  Also, it will then print its usage information, listing all the options and
       their meanings.

       If the program tells you "<u>ERROR:</u> <u>Cannot</u> <u>find</u> <u>video</u> <u>size</u> <u>for</u> <b>file</b>", this means that <u>mplayer</u> was unable  to
       read  the file or the file is stored in a format that it does not understand.  In this case, <b>movie-to-dvd</b>
       will not be able to transcode the movie file for you.

       For each source file, the following information is printed:
              * Source size: <b>width</b>x<b>height</b>
              * Source crop area: <b>width</b>x<b>height</b>
              * Destination size: <b>width</b>x<b>height</b>
              * Final screen size: <b>width</b>x<b>height</b>
              * Destination aspect: <b>width</b>:<b>height</b>

       This small table shows you what will be done to the source file to get to the  destination.   The  <b>source</b>
       <b>size</b>  is the frame size of the original video source.  The <b>source</b> <b>crop</b> <b>area</b> is the size of the frame that
       will be cut out of the original frame (usually the same size as the source, except when <b>panscan</b>  mode  is
       used  instead  of  <b>letterbox</b>  mode).   The  <b>destination</b>  <b>size</b> is the size of the zoomed/shrunk image that
       calculated from the image that was cut out of the original source image.  The <b>final</b> <b>screen</b>  <b>size</b>  is  the
       size  of  the  MPEG-2  frame  that  will  be  created  (that is, the destination size including any black
       borders).  The <b>destination</b> <b>aspect</b> is the aspect ratio of the  destination  video,  which  is  either  4:3
       (traditional TV set) or 16:9 (widescreen).

       While encoding the movie for you, the program will display its progress: it will tell you how much of the
       movie it has already encoded (a percentage) and it will tell you how long it will probably take to finish
       the encode (this is, of course, an estimate).

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLE</b></h4><pre>
       The command line that I use most often is:

              <b>movie-to-dvd</b> -m pal <u>input_file.avi</u>

       This  command  line  simply  takes  the  input file (in AVI format in this case) and converts it into two
       files, <u>input_file.mp2</u> (if the source has  stereo  audio)  or  <u>input_file.ac3</u>  (for  surround  sound)  and
       <u>input_file.m2v</u>.   All the necessary conversions will be automatically done, such as framerate adjustment,
       audio adjustment, frame size, etcetera.

       Later, I usually combine two or more of these movies into one DVD with a nice selection menu using <b>movie-</b>
       <b>title</b>, usually in combination with <b>movie-make-title</b>.

</pre><h4><b>SHORTCOMINGS</b></h4><pre>
       Currently, the program does not handle subtitles at all.  That is  to  say,  it  does  not  support  real
       subtitles  that  can be turned on and off in the DVD version of the movie.  If a subtitle file is present
       in the directory where your input movie exists, and mplayer shows these subtitles when you play the movie
       on your computer's display, then the subtitles will be rendered into the DVD version  as  well,  but  you
       will not be able to turn them on or off.  They will then be a fixed part of the image.

       Perhaps a future version of Videotrans will support proper subtitling.
