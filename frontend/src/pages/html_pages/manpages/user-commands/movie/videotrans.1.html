</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       <b>videotrans</b> - A package to convert movies to DVD format and to build DVDs with

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>videotrans</b>  is  a set of scripts that allow its user to reformat existing movies into the VOB format that
       is used on DVDs.

       Furthermore, <b>videotrans</b> supplies programs which allow its  user  to  create  a  complete  DVD,  including
       selection  menus which allow the viewer to choose which movie he/she wants to see, if more than one movie
       fits onto a DVD.

       If you want to start quickly, please read on to the "quick start" section.

       <b>videotrans</b> has the following programs available (each program has a separate manual  page  that  explains
       the program in detail):

       <b>movie-to-dvd</b>
              The  <b>movie-to-dvd</b>  program  takes  one or more input files and converts them into a separate MPEG2
              video stream and a separate MP2 or AC3 audio stream.  If you want, it will combine the  video  and
              audio  into a DVD-compatible <b>.vob</b> file, although this is usually not necessary because the program
              <b>movie-title</b> will do this for you if it hasn't been done yet when you are generating a DVD image to
              burn to a real DVD, which saves disk I/O.

              This program takes care of all the necessary conversions,  such  as  framerate  adjustment,  audio
              adjustment,  zooming/shrinking  for  DVD  frame  sizes, etcetera.  The program can determine which
              conversions are necessary on its own, no user intervention is  required  (but  of  course,  it  is
              possible).

              When  making  a  DVD, you'll first convert all the movies that you want to put on the DVD into the
              MPEG2 video and MP2 or AC3 audio streams.   Later,  you'll  combine  these  with  the  <b>movie-title</b>
              program into a complete DVD.

       <b>movie-title</b>
              The  <b>movie-title</b>  program  takes  one  or more video files that were converted by the <b>movie-to-dvd</b>
              program and a special title sequence that was produced by  <b>movie-make-title</b>  or  <b>movie-make-title-</b>
              <b>simple</b>  and  combines  all  of these into a menu from which the viewer of the DVD can choose which
              movie he or she wants to watch.

              The menu is created by displaying the title image or movie in the background, with  no  images  or
              static  or animated picture-in-picture versions of all the movies on top of that.  The creator has
              the option of supplying information about the movies.  This information can  be  viewed  from  the
              menu as well, on a movie-per-movie basis.

              The  program  also  generates  an  XML  file  for  use with <u>dvdauthor</u>, the program that is used to
              actually create the DVD image that you will burn onto a DVD disc.  The program tells  you  how  to
              run <u>dvdauthor</u> to do the processing for you.

       <b>movie-make-title</b>
              The  <b>movie-make-title</b>  program  is  used  to  create a background movie and an audio track for DVD
              menus.

              The <b>movie-make-title</b> program takes a single movie and cuts a specified part of out  it.   It  then
              converts  this piece of the movie into separate frames and saves the audio track in a WAV file for
              you.

              You'll have to manually view all the frames and throw away those that you do not want in the title
              sequence of your DVD (the first few frames and  the  last  few  frames).   It's  not  possible  to
              automatically  cut  out  the  piece  of  the movie that you want exactly.  I recommend <u>xv</u> for this
              purpose, although any image viewer that understands JPEG picture files will do.

              Also, you'll have to process the WAV audio file by hand, to cut out exactly that audio track  that
              you  want  to  hear  when  the menu is displayed.  I personally find <u>sweep</u> a very useful graphical
              audio processor for this purpose.  The <b>movie-title</b> program will make sure  that  the  audio  track
              lasts exactly as long as the movie clip that you cut out does.  This is to compensate for possible
              changes  in  the  video  frame  rate  and  to  correct small mistakes.  <u>Sweep</u> can be downloaded at
              <b><a href="http://sweep.sourceforge.net/">http://sweep.sourceforge.net/</a></b>.

       <b>movie-make-title-simple</b>
              The <b>movie-make-title-simple</b> program is used to create an optional background image and an optional
              audio track for DVD menus.

              You have the choice of using an empty background of a specific color (black being the default)  or
              an image that you supply.

              You also have the choice of including an audio track or to have no sound with the menu.

       <b>movie-rip-epg.data</b>
              The  <b>movie-rip-epg.data</b>  program  is  a  convenience  program  that  can  convert an EPG data file
              generated by VDR into a <b>.info</b> file that can be used together with  <b>movie-title</b>.   The  <b>movie-title</b>
              program  will  then  be  able  to  display the movie's name in the menu and provide an information
              button which leads to the generated information.

       <b>movie-compare-dvd</b>
              The <b>movie-compare-dvd</b> program can be used after burning a DVD  image  to  a  DVD  disc  to  verify
              whether  all  the  data was written onto the disc intact.  The program takes the on-filesytem copy
              and the on-DVD copy and compares the checksums of the files on both to find any differences.

</pre><h4><b>QUICK</b> <b>START</b></h4><pre>
       If you want to start quickly with these programs, and you have a couple of movies that you  want  to  put
       onto  a  DVD,  try  this  (assuming  that  your TV standard is PAL, otherwise specify <b>ntsc</b> instead of <b>pal</b>
       everywhere that it's used):

              <b>movie-to-dvd</b> -m pal movie1.avi movie2.avi movie3.avi
              <b>movie-make-title-simple</b> -o title -m pal \
                    -i background.jpg -s -a music.mp3
              <b>movie-title</b> -o title.vob -t title \
                    movie1.m2v movie2.m2v movie3.m2v
              dvdauthor -o dvd_directory -x title.vob-dvdauthor.xml
              <u>a_command_to_burn_a_dvd_from</u> dvd_directory

       In case you don't want a selection menu, you may also try:

              <b>movie-to-dvd</b> -m pal -M movie1.avi movie2.avi movie3.avi
              dvdauthor -o dvd_directory movie1.vob
              dvdauthor -o dvd_directory movie2.vob
              dvdauthor -o dvd_directory movie3.vob
              dvdauthor -o dvd_directory -T
              <u>a_command_to_burn_a_dvd_from</u> dvd_directory

       In this case, you'll have to use the DVD player's navigation controls to get to the various movies on the
       DVD.
