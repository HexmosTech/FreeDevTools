</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       <b>movie-title</b> - Creates a menu for a set of movies on a DVD

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>

       <b>movie-title</b> <u>[-C]</u> <u>-o</u> <u>output</u> <u>-t</u> <u>title_seq</u> <u>[-T</u> <u>XxY]</u> <u>[-s</u> <u>start]</u> <u>[-c</u> <u>interval]</u> source_video <u>[...]</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This  program  takes  one  or  more  video streams (which are the <b>.m2v</b> or <b>.vob</b> files that are produced by
       <b>movie-to-dvd</b>) and exactly one title sequence (as produced by <b>movie-make-title</b> or <b>movie-make-title-simple</b>)
       and combines all of them into a navigational menu from which a viewer of the DVD can choose  which  movie
       he or she wants to see.

       The  program will produce a VOB file that can be used as a menu if you want to do your own DVD authoring,
       but it will also produce an XML file that can be used directly  as  an  input  file  for  <b>dvdauthor</b>,  the
       program that you will most likely be using to create the DVD images that you can burn on a real DVD.

</pre><h4><b>THE</b> <b>MENU</b></h4><pre>
       The menu will look as follows: the background that will fill the entire screen will be the supplied title
       sequence (as produced by <b>movie-make-title</b> or <b>movie-make-title-simple</b>).  The sound from the title sequence
       (if any) will be audible while the viewer is choosing which movie to watch.

       If the <b>animated</b> type of menu was chosen in <b>movie-make-title</b> or <b>movie-make-title-simple</b>, each movie in the
       menu  will  be  presented by having a rectangle in the menu in which a picture-in-picture version of that
       movie is display (exactly as long as the title sequence is itself).

       If the <b>static</b> type of menu was chosen in <b>movie-make-title</b> or <b>movie-make-title-simple</b>, each movie  in  the
       menu  will  be presented by having a rectangle in the menu in which one frame of that movie is displayed,
       that will remain unchanged while the menu is being displayed.

       If the <b>none</b> type of menu was chosen in <b>movie-make-title</b> or <b>movie-make-title-simple</b>, none of the movies in
       the menu will have a preview image at all.

       Below the rectangle (or below the navigation button(s) if there is no preview image),  the  name  of  the
       movie  will  be displayed.  If no further information is supplied (see further on), the movie's file name
       will be used as the title (which is most likely not what you want), otherwise the supplied title will  be
       used.   Above  the rectangle (or above the title if no preview images are present), a "play" icon will be
       displayed, which can be chosen by using the DVD player's remote to play the movie.  If  more  information
       is supplied (more than just a title), an extra "information" icon will be displayed as well, which can be
       selected in order to view the extra supplied information.

</pre><h4><b>EXTRA</b> <b>INFORMATION</b></h4><pre>
       If  supplied,  one  can  also add information about the movies to the DVD: an extra information icon will
       appear with the movie's title, and when chosen, the information will appear for the viewer to  read.   If
       there is more information than will fit onto the screen, a scrollbar will be created, and the viewer will
       be able to scroll by using the up and down keys on his or her DVD player's remote control.

       The way the extra information works is as follows: create a file with the same name as the video stream's
       name,  except using <b>.info</b> as the extension instead of <b>.m2v</b> or <b>.vob</b>.  So if you have a video stream called
       <b>my_home_video.m2v</b>, then you should create a text file called <b>my_home_video.info</b>.

</pre><h4><b>EXTRA</b> <b>INFORMATION</b> <b>FORMAT</b></h4><pre>
       The file has a certain format: the first line should be the title of the movie as it should be  displayed
       in  the  menu.   You may use the special character <b>^</b> (carrot, usually shift-6) to split up the title into
       multiple lines.  This is useful when the title is quite long and is too wide to fit in the grid.

       The remainder of the file may be used to supply information about the movie.  If the file  contains  only
       one  line, only the title will be used and no "information" icon will be displayed for this movie.  Lines
       should normally not be any wider than about 60 characters to avoid the lines being wider than the  screen
       can display.

</pre><h4><b>EXTRA</b> <b>INFORMATION</b> <b>COLORS</b></h4><pre>
       To introduce some extra clarity, you may specify in which color a line should be displayed.  Usually, the
       text  is  white  (and  the  background is always black).  You may type a hash mark (<b>#</b>) followed by a six-
       character hexadecimal color code (the same as those used on the web) followed by a space followed by  the
       line itself to display a line in a certain color.

</pre><h4><b>EXTRA</b> <b>INFORMATION</b> <b>EXAMPLE</b></h4><pre>
       An example of a <b>.info</b> file could be:

       My first words
       #ffff00 Title:
           My first words

       #ff00ff Date:
           September 8th, 1975

       #ff0000 Synopsis:
           A home video that captures my first words as a child!

       In  this  case,  the  title  is "My first words", which will be displayed in the DVD menu.  Further more,
       extra information is supplied, which can be viewed using the "information" icon on the DVD.  The "Title:"
       line will be in yellow, the "Date:" line in magenta and the "Synopsis:" line will be  presented  in  red.
       The other text will be in plain white.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The following options are available:

       <b>-o</b> <b>output</b>
              Specifies the name of the menu VOB file that should be produced by this program.

              Not  only  this  file  is  created,  but  a  whole lot of other files as well.  These files can be
              automatically cleaned up by using the <b>-C</b> option (see the information there).

              The most notable files are <b>output</b> itself (which is a VOB file that can be used as a menu,  if  you
              want  to  do  your  own  DVD authoring) and <b>output</b>-dvdauthor.xml, which is an XML file that can be
              given to <b>dvdauthor</b>'s <b>-x</b> option to create the DVD image for you.

              There is also <b>output</b>-overlay.gif, which will contain the titles and the  rectangles  used  in  the
              menu.   This  file  can  be viewed to see whether the titles all fit nicely in the menu before you
              decide to burn it to a real DVD.

              Personally, I usually use the name <b>title.vob</b> (short and to-the-point).

       <b>-C</b>     When this option is supplied (and the rest the of arguments remain as they were when  the  program
              is  first  run), the program will clean up all the temporary files that were created for producing
              the DVD image.  When the program is run without this option, it will suggest a command line to run
              including this option when it finishes, to clean up.

       <b>-t</b> <b>title_sequence</b>
              This option tells the program which title sequence directory to use, which must have been  created
              my  <b>movie-make-title</b>  or  <b>movie-make-title-simple</b> beforehand.  Please look in the manual pages for
              <b>movie-make-title</b> and <b>movie-make-title-simple</b> for more information on how to use those programs.

       <b>-T</b> <b>XxY</b> Normally, the program will determine by itself what the optimal grid size is in which  to  present
              all the movies at once.  For example, if there are five movies, it will set the grid size to three
              by  two (leaving one space blank).  Using this option, you may override the program's default grid
              size and set it to X by Y (note the letter <b>x</b> in between the two numbers).  If you specify  a  grid
              size  that  has more spaces than there are movies, the last few spaces will be left blank.  If you
              specify a grid size that has fewer spaces than there are movies, the program will tell you so  and
              will refuse to run.

       <b>-s</b> <b>start</b>
              Normally,  the  program  will  start  capturing  frames for the picture-in-picture versions of the
              movies to put in the menu from the beginning (first frame) of those movies.  This  is  often  just
              fine, but sometimes you will want to start capturing frames somewhere beyond the start.  You could
              want  this if all the movies start the same way, for example.  You'll also want to use this if you
              are displaying static preview images in your menu: if you don't, you  will  probably  just  see  a
              black  image because the first image of a movie is rarely anything useful.  Using this option, you
              can specify a number seconds, which will be used as a seek position in the movie before any frames
              are captured.

       <b>-c</b> <b>interval</b>
              Sets how long a chapter lasts in the movies.  Chapters are created every <b>interval</b> minutes  in  the
              movies.  This makes the movie easy to navigate with a DVD player's remote control.  The default is
              2 minutes.  If you do not want chapters to be created, specify <b>none</b>.

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       If  this program is called with a incorrect set of parameters, it will print a diagnostic message telling
       the user what went wrong.  Also, it will then print its usage information, listing all  the  options  and
       their meanings.

       The program tells you what it is doing while it is running.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLE</b></h4><pre>
       The command line that I use most often is:

              <b>movie-title</b> -o title.vob -t title <u>input1.m2v</u> <u>input2.m2v</u>

</pre><h4><b>AFTER</b> <b>RUNNING</b> <b>THE</b> <b>PROGRAM</b></h4><pre>
       Once the program has been run, you should run <b>dvdauthor</b> to create a DVD image that you can burn to a real
       DVD.  The program will tell you how to run <b>dvdauthor</b> once it has finished.  Also, it will suggest what to
       run  after <b>dvdauthor</b> has done its job to clean up all the temporary files that are no longer necessary at
       that point.

</pre><h4><b>BURNING</b> <b>THE</b> <b>IMAGE</b> <b>TO</b> <b>A</b> <b>REAL</b> <b>DVD</b></h4><pre>
       Once you have created a DVD image with <b>dvdauthor</b>, you may burn it onto a real  DVD.   How  this  is  done
       depends on which program you use for that.  Personally, I use <b>growisofs</b>.  The command line that I use for
       that program is:

              <b>growisofs</b> -dvd-video -Z /dev/dvd <u>directory_with_image</u>

       The <u>directory_with_image</u> is the directory that you specified in <b>dvdauthor</b>'s <b>-o</b> option.

</pre><h4><b>MOVIES</b> <b>WITH</b> <b>MORE</b> <b>THAN</b> <b>ONE</b> <b>PART</b></h4><pre>
       Some  movies  are  split  up into more than one part.  That is, you have more than one <b>.m2v</b> or <b>.vob</b> file,
       which together make up the entire movie.  For example, you could have a movie that has been split up into
       separate sections, each lasting a half hour at the most.

       In this case, you don't want all the sections to appear in the menu, just the section from which you want
       to rip the picture-in-picture view for use in the menu.

       You should supply just the <b>.m2v</b> or <b>.vob</b> as an argument to this program from which you  want  to  rip  the
       frames  for use in the menu, along with any other <b>.m2v</b> or <b>.vob</b> files that you want to appear in the menu.
       Once the program is done, just before you  run  <b>dvdauthor</b>,  you  should  edit  the  file  called  <b>output</b>-
       dvdauthor.xml.   Look  for  the  line  that  contains  the file name of the section of the movie that you
       specified on the command line.  Copy this line and paste it below the existing line  until  you  have  as
       many  lines  as that there are parts of the movie.  Now, edit the file names in each of the lines so that
       you end up naming all of the sections of the movie.

       Now, when you run <b>dvdauthor</b>, it will join all of the sections together into one complete movie.  It  will
       do this for all the movies that had been split up.
