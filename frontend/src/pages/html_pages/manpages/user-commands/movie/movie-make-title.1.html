</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       <b>movie-make-title</b> - Creates a title sequence that can be used to create a menu with <b>movie-title</b>

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>

       <b>movie-make-title</b> <u>-o</u> <u>output</u> <u>-s</u> <u>start_time</u> <u>-e</u> <u>end_time</u> <u>[-n</u> <u>animation]</u> <u>-m</u> <u>mode</u> source_movie

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This  program  takes  exactly  one movie file in any format that <u>mplayer</u> understands and converts part of
       that file into a directory full of JPEG files and a WAV file that can be used by the <b>movie-title</b>  program
       to create menus for DVDs with more than one movie on them.

       The way this works is the following: this program rips part of the source movie and uses that ripped part
       as  the  animated  background  of the menu that <b>movie-title</b> will create.  The foreground of the menus are
       rectangle with borders around them that act like little TV sets: they display the first  few  seconds  of
       each movie on the DVD.

       The best way to grasp how the system works is by trying it out for yourself.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The following options are available:

       <b>-o</b> <b>output</b>
              Specifies the name of the directory that should be created and will contain a large number of JPEG
              files  and  a  WAV  file  for the audio of the title sequence.  Personally, I usually use the name
              <b>title</b> (short and to-the-point).

       <b>-s</b> <b>start_time</b>
              Specifies the starting time (in seconds) of the part of the source movie that you want to rip.

              I usually determine this time by playing the source movie with <b>mplayer</b> and  then  looking  at  the
              status  line that <b>mplayer</b> continually updates at the moment that the clip that you want as a title
              starts.  Then, I usually subtract about 5 seconds because <b>mplayer</b>  is  unable  to  seek  to  exact
              positions  when  ripping  a  part  of  a  movie.  Usually, the seeking resolution is about 5 to 10
              seconds, and that is why I subtract 5 seconds.

              While the movie part is being ripped, the normal <b>mplayer</b> output will be  displayed.   If  you  see
              that  <b>mplayer</b> starts at a time that is later than the start of your clip, press <b>CTRL-C</b> and restart
              the program with an earlier starting time.

       <b>-e</b> <b>end_time</b>
              Specifies the ending time (in seconds) of the part of the source movie that you want to rip.

              I usually determine this time by playing the source movie with <b>mplayer</b> and  then  looking  at  the
              status  line that <b>mplayer</b> continually updates at the moment that the clip that you want as a title
              ends.  Then, I usually add about 5 seconds because <b>mplayer</b> is unable to stop  at  exact  positions
              when  ripping  a  part  of a movie.  Usually, the seeking resolution is about 5 to 10 seconds, and
              that is why I add 5 seconds.

              While the movie part is being ripped, the normal <b>mplayer</b> output will be  displayed.   If  you  see
              that  <b>mplayer</b> ends at a time that is earlier than the end of your clip, restart the program with a
              later ending time.

       <b>-n</b> <b>animation</b>
              Using this option, you can tell the program what kind of menu  you  would  like  to  create.   The
              possible  arguments  are <b>none</b> (which will cause a menu to be created that will have no previews of
              the movies, but will only display the background movie, the titles of  the  main  movies  and  the
              navigation  buttons),  <b>static</b>  (which  will cause a menu to be created that will display a preview
              image of each movie, but that is not animated) and <b>animated</b> (which will cause a menu to be created
              that will display picture-in-picture animated previews of the movies).

              If you don't specify this option, the default will be <b>animated</b>.

       <b>-m</b> <b>mode</b>
              Specify either <b>pal</b> or <b>ntsc</b>, depending on whether you are creating a PAL or NTSC DVD.  NTSC  is  an
              American TV standard, PAL is usually used in Europe and other parts of the world.

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       If  this program is called with a incorrect set of parameters, it will print a diagnostic message telling
       the user what went wrong.  Also, it will then print its usage information, listing all  the  options  and
       their meanings.

       If  the program tells you "<u>ERROR:</u> <u>Cannot</u> <u>find</u> <u>video</u> <u>size</u> <u>for</u> <b>file</b>", this means that <u>mplayer</u> was unable to
       read the file or the file is stored in a format that it does not understand.  In this  case,  <b>movie-make-</b>
       <b>title</b> will not be able to do its work for you.

       The program tells you what it is doing while it is running.

</pre><h4><b>POSTPROCESSING</b></h4><pre>
       Because  the  ripping of a part of a movie is not an exact science because of the seeking resolution that
       <b>mplayer</b> offers, you must edit the result of this program by hand.  That  means  that  you  will  have  to
       remove  any images that not belong at the start and end of your title sequence.  Do not remove any images
       in the middle of the title sequence: any missing image will be seen as the end of the sequence.

       I usually use the program <b>xv</b> (which is an  image  viewer  for  X  windows,  which  you  can  download  at
       <b><a href="http://www.trilon.com/xv/xv.html">http://www.trilon.com/xv/xv.html</a></b>)  to look at all the images in the directory that you specified with the
       <b>-o</b> option (in my case, I run <b>xv</b> <b>title/*.jpg</b>).  Then I remove any images at the start of the sequence  and
       at the end of the sequence that are not actually a part of the title sequence that I had in mind.

       Just  as the images have to be adjusted, the audio file that was produced will have to be edited as well.
       You will have to chop off the audio parts at the beginning and the end that you do not want.  The file to
       edit is <b>title.wav</b> in the directory that you specified with the <b>-o</b> option.  I usually edit  the  WAV  file
       with  <b>sweep</b>,  a  really  nice  audio  editing  program  for  X  windows,  which  may  be  downloaded from
       <b><a href="http://sweep.sourceforge.net/">http://sweep.sourceforge.net/</a></b>.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLE</b></h4><pre>
       The command line that I use most often is:

              <b>movie-make-title</b> -o title -m pal \
                     -s 123 -e 234 <u>input_file.avi</u>

       This command line simply takes the input file (in AVI format in this case) and converts it for  use  with
       <b>movie-title</b>.   In this case, I'm ripping the part of the movie that starts at second 123 (two minutes and
       three seconds into the movie) and ends at second 234 (nearly four minutes into the movie).
