       | <b>-</b> <u>...</u> ]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>flac</b> is a command-line tool for encoding, decoding, testing and analyzing FLAC streams.

</pre><h4><b>GENERAL</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       <b>flac</b> supports as input RIFF WAVE, Wave64, RF64, AIFF,  FLAC  or  Ogg  FLAC  format,  or  raw  interleaved
       samples.  The decoder currently can output to RIFF WAVE, Wave64, RF64, or AIFF format, or raw interleaved
       samples.   flac  only  supports  linear PCM samples (in other words, no A-LAW, uLAW, etc.), and the input
       must be between 4 and 32 bits per sample.

       flac assumes that files ending in “.wav” or that have the RIFF WAVE header present are WAVE files,  files
       ending  in “.w64” or have the Wave64 header present are Wave64 files, files ending in “.rf64” or have the
       RF64 header present are RF64 files, files ending in “.aif” or “.aiff” or have the AIFF header present are
       AIFF files, files ending in “.flac” or have the FLAC header present are FLAC files and  files  ending  in
       “.oga” or “.ogg” or have the Ogg FLAC header present are Ogg FLAC files.

       Other  than  this,  flac  makes  no assumptions about file extensions, though the convention is that FLAC
       files have the extension “.flac” (or “.fla” on ancient “8.3” file systems like FAT-16).

       Before going into the full command-line description, a few other things help to sort it out:

       1. flac encodes by default, so you must use -d to decode

       2. Encoding options -0 ..  -8 (or --fast and --best) that control the compression level actually are just
          synonyms for different groups of specific encoding options (described later).
       3. The order in which options are specified is generally not important except when they  contradict  each
          other,  then  the latter takes precedence except that compression presets are overridden by any option
          given before or after.  For example, -0M, -M0, -M2 and -2M are all the same as -1, and -l  12  -6  the
          same as -7.

       4. flac behaves similarly to gzip in the way it handles input and output files

       Skip to the EXAMPLES section below for examples of some typical tasks.

       flac  will  be  invoked  one  of  four ways, depending on whether you are encoding, decoding, testing, or
       analyzing.  Encoding is the default invocation, but can be switch to decoding with <b>-d</b>, analysis  with  <b>-a</b>
       or  testing  with  <b>-t</b>.  Depending on which way is chosen, encoding, decoding, analysis or testing options
       can be used, see section OPTIONS for details.  General options can be used for all.

       If only one inputfile is specified, it may be “-” for stdin.  When stdin is  used  as  input,  flac  will
       write to stdout.  Otherwise flac will perform the desired operation on each input file to similarly named
       output files (meaning for encoding, the extension will be replaced with “.flac”, or appended with “.flac”
       if  the  input  file has no extension, and for decoding, the extension will be “.wav” for WAVE output and
       “.raw” for raw output).  The original file is not deleted unless --delete-input-file is specified.

       If you are encoding/decoding from stdin to a file, you should use the -o option like so:

              flac [options] -o outputfile
              flac -d [options] -o outputfile

       which are better than:

              flac [options] &gt; outputfile
              flac -d [options] &gt; outputfile

       since the former allows flac to seek backwards to write the STREAMINFO or RIFF WAVE header contents  when
       necessary.

       Also, you can force output data to go to stdout using -c.

       To  encode  or  decode  files  that  start  with a dash, use -- to signal the end of options, to keep the
       filenames themselves from being treated as options:

              flac -V -- -01-filename.wav

       The encoding options affect the compression ratio and encoding speed.  The format  options  are  used  to
       tell  flac the arrangement of samples if the input file (or output file when decoding) is a raw file.  If
       it is a RIFF WAVE, Wave64, RF64, or AIFF file the format options are not needed since they are read  from
       the file’s header.

       In test mode, flac acts just like in decode mode, except no output file is written.  Both decode and test
       modes  detect errors in the stream, but they also detect when the MD5 signature of the decoded audio does
       not match the stored MD5 signature, even when the bitstream is valid.

       flac can also re-encode FLAC files.  In other words, you can specify a FLAC or Ogg FLAC file as an  input
       to  the  encoder  and  it will decoder it and re-encode it according to the options you specify.  It will
       also preserve all the metadata unless you override it with other  options  (e.g.   specifying  new  tags,
       seekpoints, cuesheet, padding, etc.).

       flac  has  been  tuned so that the default settings yield a good speed vs.  compression tradeoff for many
       kinds of input.  However, if you are looking to maximize the compression rate or speed, or  want  to  use
       the  full  power  of  FLAC’s  metadata  system,  see  the page titled `About the FLAC Format' on the FLAC
       website.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Some typical encoding and decoding tasks using flac:

   <b>Encoding</b> <b>examples</b>
       flac abc.wav
              Encode abc.wav to abc.flac using the default compression setting.  abc.wav is not deleted.

       flac --delete-input-file abc.wav
              Like above, except abc.wav is deleted if there were no errors.

       flac --delete-input-file -w abc.wav
              Like above, except abc.wav is deleted if there were no errors and no warnings.

       flac --best abc.wav or flac -8 abc.wav
              Encode abc.wav to abc.flac using the highest compression preset.

       flac --verify abc.wav or flac -V abc.wav
              Encode abc.wav to abc.flac and internally decode abc.flac to make sure it matches abc.wav.

       flac -o my.flac abc.wav
              Encode abc.wav to my.flac.

       flac abc.aiff foo.rf64 bar.w64
              Encode abc.aiff to abc.flac, foo.rf64 to foo.flac and bar.w64 to bar.flac

       flac *.wav *.aif?
              Wildcards are supported.  This command will encode all .wav files and all  .aif/.aiff/.aifc  files
              (as well as other supported files ending in .aif+one character) in the current directory.

       flac abc.flac --force or flac abc.flac -f
              Recompresses,  keeping  metadata  like  tags.   The syntax is a little tricky: this is an <u>encoding</u>
              command (which is the default: you need to specify -d for decoded output), and will thus  want  to
              output  the  file  abc.flac - which already exists.  flac will require the --force or shortform -f
              option to overwrite an existing file.  Recompression will first  write  a  temporary  file,  which
              afterwards  replaces  the  old  abc.flac (provided flac has write access to that file).  The above
              example uses default settings.  More often, recompression is combined with a different  -  usually
              higher  - compression option.  Note: If the FLAC file does not end with .flac - say, it is abc.fla
              - the -f is not needed: A new abc.flac will be  created  and  the  old  kept,  just  like  for  an
              uncompressed input file.

       flac --tag-from-file="ALBUM=albumtitle.txt" -T "ARTIST=Queen" *.wav
              Encode  every  .wav  file in the directory and add some tags.  Every file will get the same set of
              tags.  Warning: Will wipe all existing tags, when the input file is (Ogg) FLAC -  not  just  those
              tags listed in the option.  Use the metaflac utility to tag FLAC files.

       flac --keep-foreign-metadata-if-present abc.wav
              FLAC  files  can  store  non-audio  chunks  of input WAVE/AIFF/RF64/W64 files.  The related option
              --keep-foreign-metadata works the same way, but will instead exit with an error if the  input  has
              no  such  non-audio  chunks.  The encoder only stores the chunks as they are, it cannot import the
              content into its own tags (vorbis comments).  To transfer  such  tags  from  a  source  file,  use
              tagging software which supports them.

       flac -Vj2 -m3fo Track07.flac  -- -7.wav
              flac employs the commonplace convention that options in a short version - invoked with single dash
              -  can  be  shortened together until one that takes an argument.  Here -j and -o do, and after the
              “2” a whitespace is needed to start new options with single/double dash.  The -m option does  not,
              and  the  following  “3”  is the -3 compression setting.  The options could equally well have been
              written out as -V -j 2 -m -3 -f -o Track04.flac ,  or  as  -fo  Track04.flac  -3mVj2.   flac  also
              employs  the  convention that -- (with whitespace!)  signifies end of options, treating everything
              to follow as filename.  That is needed when an input filenames  could  otherwise  be  read  as  an
              option,  and  “-7” is one such.  In total, this line takes the input file -7.wav as input; -o will
              give output filename as Track07.flac, and the -f  will  overwrite  if  the  file  Track04.flac  is
              already  present.  The encoder will select encoding preset -3 modified with the -m switch, and use
              two CPU threads.  Afterwards, the -V will make it decode the flac file and compare  the  audio  to
              the input, to ensure they are indeed equal.

   <b>Decoding</b> <b>examples</b>
       flac --decode abc.flac or flac -d abc.flac
              Decode  abc.flac to abc.wav.  abc.flac is not deleted.  If abc.wav is already present, the process
              will exit with an error instead of overwriting; use –force / -f to force overwrite.  NOTE: A  mere
              flac  abc.flac  <u>without</u>  <u>–decode</u> <u>or</u> <u>its</u> <u>shortform</u> <u>-d</u>, would mean to re-encode abc.flac to abc.flac
              (see above), and that command would err out because abc.flac already exists.

       flac -d --force-aiff-format abc.flac or flac -d -o abc.aiff abc.flac
              Two different ways of decoding abc.flac to abc.aiff (AIFF format).  abc.flac is not  deleted.   -d
              -o  could  be shortened to -do.  The decoder can force other output formats, or different versions
              of the WAVE/AIFF formats, see the options below.

       flac -d --keep-foreign-metadata-if-present abc.flac
              If the FLAC file has non-audio chunks stored from  the  original  input  file,  this  option  will
              restore  both audio and non-audio.  The chunks will reveal the original file type, and the decoder
              will select output format and output file extension accordingly - note that this is not compatible
              with forcing a particular output format except if it coincides with the original, as  the  decoder
              cannot transcode non-audio between formats.  If there are no such chunks stored, it will decode to
              abc.wav.   The  related  option --keep-foreign-metadata will instead exit with an error if no such
              non-audio chunks are found.

       flac -d -F abc.flac
              Decode abc.flac to abc.wav and don’t abort if errors are found.  This is  potentially  useful  for
              recovering  as  much as possible from a corrupted file.  Note: Be careful about trying to “repair”
              files this way.  Often it will only conceal an error, and not play any subjectively “better”  than
              the  corrupted  file.   It  is a good idea to at least keep it, and possibly try several decoders,
              including the one that generated the file, and hear if one has  less  detrimental  audible  errors
              than another.  Make sure output volume is limited, as corrupted audio can generate loud noises.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       A  summary of options is included below.  Several of the options can be negated, see the <b>Negative</b> <b>options</b>
       section below.

   <b>GENERAL</b> <b>OPTIONS</b>
       <b>-v</b>, <b>--version</b>
              Show the flac version number, and quit.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
              Show basic usage and a list of all options, and quit.

       <b>-d</b>, <b>--decode</b>
              Decode (the default behavior is to encode)

       <b>-t</b>, <b>--test</b>
              Test a flac encoded file.  This works the same as -d except no decoded file is written,  and  with
              some additional checks like parsing of all metadata blocks.

       <b>-a</b>, <b>--analyze</b>
              Analyze a FLAC encoded file.  This works the same as -d except the output is an analysis file, not
              a decoded file.

       <b>-c</b>, <b>--stdout</b>
              Write output to stdout

       <b>-f</b>, <b>--force</b>
              Force overwriting of output files.  By default, flac warns that the output file already exists and
              continues to the next file.

       <b>--delete-input-file</b>
              Automatically  delete  the  input file after a successful encode or decode.  If there was an error
              (including a verify error) the input file is left intact.

       <b>-o</b> <u>FILENAME</u>, <b>--output-name</b>=<u>FILENAME</u>
              Force the output file name (usually flac just changes the  extension).   May  only  be  used  when
              encoding a single file.  May not be used in conjunction with --output-prefix.

       <b>--output-prefix</b>=<u>STRING</u>
              Prefix  each  output file name with the given string.  This can be useful for encoding or decoding
              files to a different directory.  Make sure if your string is a path  name  that  it  ends  with  a
              trailing `/’ (slash).

       <b>--preserve-modtime</b>
              (Enabled  by default.)  Output files have their timestamps/permissions set to match those of their
              inputs.  Use --no-preserve-modtime to  make  output  files  have  the  current  time  and  default
              permissions.

       <b>--keep-foreign-metadata</b>
              If encoding, save WAVE, RF64, or AIFF non-audio chunks in FLAC metadata.  If decoding, restore any
              saved  non-audio chunks from FLAC metadata when writing the decoded file.  Foreign metadata cannot
              be transcoded, e.g. WAVE chunks saved in a FLAC file cannot be restored  when  decoding  to  AIFF.
              Input  and  output  must be regular files (not stdin or stdout).  With this option, FLAC will pick
              the right output format on decoding.  It will exit with error if no such chunks are found.

       <b>--keep-foreign-metadata-if-present</b>
              Like --keep-foreign-metadata, but without throwing an error if foreign metadata cannot be found or
              restored.  Instead, prints a warning.

       <b>--skip</b>={#|<u>MM:SS</u>}
              Skip the first number of samples of the input.  To skip over a given initial time, specify instead
              minutes and seconds: there must then be at least one  digit  on  each  side  of  the  colon  sign.
              Fractions   of   a   second   can   be   specified,  with  locale-dependent  decimal  point,  e.g.
              --skip=123:9,867 if your decimal point is a comma.  A --skip option is applied to each input  file
              if more are given.  This option cannot be used with -t.  When used with -a, the analysis file will
              enumerate frames from starting point.

       <b>--until</b>={#|[+|]<u>MM:SS</u>}
              Stop  at  the given sample number (which is not included).  A negative number is taken relative to
              the end of the audio, a `+’ (plus) sign means that the --until point  is  taken  relative  to  the
              --skip point.  For other considerations, see --skip.

       <b>--no-utf8-convert</b>
              Do  not convert tags from local charset to UTF-8.  This is useful for scripts, and setting tags in
              situations where the locale is wrong.  This option must appear before any tag options!

       <b>-s</b>, <b>--silent</b>
              Silent mode (do not write runtime encode/decode statistics to stderr)

       <b>--totally-silent</b>
              Do not print anything of any kind, including warnings or errors.  The exit code will be  the  only
              way to determine successful completion.

       <b>-w</b>, <b>--warnings-as-errors</b>
              Treat all warnings as errors (which cause flac to terminate with a non-zero exit code).

   <b>DECODING</b> <b>OPTIONS</b>
       <b>-F</b>, <b>--decode-through-errors</b>
              By  default flac stops decoding with an error message and removes the partially decoded file if it
              encounters a bitstream error.  With -F, errors are still printed but flac will  continue  decoding
              to  completion.   Note  that errors may cause the decoded audio to be missing some samples or have
              silent sections.

       <b>--cue</b>=[#.#][-[#.#]]
              Set the beginning and ending cuepoints to decode.  Decimal points  are  locale-dependent  (dot  or
              comma).   The  optional  first  #.# is the track and index point at which decoding will start; the
              default is the beginning of the stream.  The optional second #.# is the track and index  point  at
              which  decoding  will  end; the default is the end of the stream.  If the cuepoint does not exist,
              the closest one before it (for the start point) or after it (for the end point) will be used.   If
              those  don’t  exist  , the start of the stream (for the start point) or end of the stream (for the
              end point) will be used.  The cuepoints are merely translated into sample  numbers  then  used  as
              --skip  and  --until.   A CD track can always be cued by, for example, --cue=9.1-10.1 for track 9,
              even if the CD has no 10th track.

       <b>–decode-chained-stream</b>
              Decode all links in a chained Ogg stream, not just the first one.

       <b>--apply-replaygain-which-is-not-lossless</b>[=<u>SPECIFICATION</u>]
              Applies ReplayGain values while decoding.  <b>WARNING:</b> <b>THIS</b> <b>IS</b> <b>NOT</b> <b>LOSSLESS.</b>  <b>DECODED</b> <b>AUDIO</b> <b>WILL</b>  <b>NOT</b>
              <b>BE</b>  <b>IDENTICAL</b>  <b>TO</b>  <b>THE</b> <b>ORIGINAL</b> <b>WITH</b> <b>THIS</b> <b>OPTION.</b> This option is useful for example in transcoding
              media servers, where the client does not support ReplayGain.  For  details  on  the  use  of  this
              option, see the section <b>ReplayGain</b> <b>application</b> <b>specification</b>.

       <b>-l</b> #, <b>--max-lpc-order</b>=#
              Specifies  the maximum LPC order.  This number must be &lt;= 32.  For subset streams, it must be &lt;=12
              if the sample rate is &lt;=48kHz.  If 0, the encoder will not attempt generic linear prediction,  and
              only choose among a set of fixed (hard-coded) predictors.  Restricting to fixed predictors only is
              faster, but compresses weaker - typically five percentage points / ten percent larger files.

       <b>-b</b> #, <b>--blocksize</b>=#
              Specify  the  blocksize  in  samples.  The current default is 1152 for -l 0, else 4096.  Blocksize
              must be between 16 and 65535 (inclusive).  For subset streams it must be &lt;= 4608 if the samplerate
              is &lt;= 48kHz, for subset streams with higher samplerates it must be &lt;= 16384.

       <b>-m</b>, <b>--mid-side</b>
              Try mid-side coding for each frame (stereo only, otherwise ignored).

       <b>-M</b>, <b>--adaptive-mid-side</b>
              Adaptive mid-side coding for all frames (stereo only, otherwise ignored).

       <b>-r</b> [#,]#, <b>--rice-partition-order</b>=[#,]#
              Set the [min,]max residual partition order (0..15).  For subset streams, max  must  be  &lt;=8.   min
              defaults  to  0.   Default  is  -r  5.   Actual  partitioning will be restricted by block size and
              prediction order, and the encoder will silently reduce too high values.

       <b>-A</b> <u>FUNCTION(S)</u>, <b>--apodization</b>=<u>FUNCTION(S)</u>
              Window audio data with given apodization function.   More  can  be  given,  comma-separated.   See
              section <b>Apodization</b> <b>functions</b> for details.

       <b>-e</b>, <b>--exhaustive-model-search</b>
              Do exhaustive model search (expensive!).

       <b>-q</b> #, <b>--qlp-coeff-precision</b>=#
              Precision  of  the  quantized linear-predictor coefficients.  This number must be in between 5 and
              16, or 0 (the default) to let encoder decide.  Does nothing if using -l 0.

       <b>-p</b>, <b>--qlp-coeff-precision-search</b>
              Do exhaustive search of LP coefficient quantization (expensive!).  Overrides -q; does  nothing  if
              using -l 0.

       <b>--lax</b>  Allow  encoder  to  generate  non-Subset  files.  The resulting FLAC file may not be streamable or
              might have trouble being played in all players (especially hardware devices), so you  should  only
              use this option in combination with custom encoding options meant for archival.

       <b>--limit-min-bitrate</b>
              Limit  minimum bitrate by not allowing frames consisting of only constant subframes.  This ensures
              a bitrate of at least 1 bit/sample, for example 48kbit/s for 48kHz input.  This is  mainly  useful
              for internet streaming.

       <b>-j</b> #, <b>--threads</b>=#
              Try  to set a maximum number of threads to use for encoding.  If multithreading was not enabled on
              compilation or when setting a number of threads that is too high, this fails with a warning.   The
              value   of  0  means  a  default  set  by  the  encoder;  currently  that  is  1  thread  (i.e. no
              multithreading), but that could change in the future.  Currently, up to 128 threads are supported.
              Using a value higher than the number of available CPU threads harms performance.

       <b>--ignore-chunk-sizes</b>
              When encoding to flac, ignore the file size headers in WAV and  AIFF  files  to  attempt  to  work
              around  problems  with over-sized or malformed files.  WAV and AIFF files both specifies length of
              audio data with an unsigned 32-bit number, limiting audio to just over 4 gigabytes.  Files  larger
              than this are malformed, but should be read correctly using this option.  Beware however, it could
              misinterpret any data following the audio chunk, as audio.

       <b>--replay-gain</b>
              Calculate ReplayGain values and store them as FLAC tags, similar to vorbisgain.  Title gains/peaks
              will  be computed for each input file, and an album gain/peak will be computed for all files.  All
              input files must have the same resolution, sample rate, and number of  channels.   Only  mono  and
              stereo  files are allowed, and the sample rate must be 8, 11.025, 12, 16, 18.9, 22.05, 24, 28, 32,
              36, 37.8, 44.1, 48, 56, 64, 72, 75.6, 88.2, 96, 112, 128, 144, 151.2, 176.4, 192, 224,  256,  288,
              302.4,  352.8, 384, 448, 512, 576, or 604.8 kHz.  Also note that this option may leave a few extra
              bytes in a PADDING block as the exact size of the tags is not known until all files are processed.
              Note that this option cannot be used when encoding to standard output (stdout).

       <b>--cuesheet</b>=<u>FILENAME</u>
              Import the given cuesheet file and store it in a CUESHEET metadata block.  This option may only be
              used when encoding a single file.  A seekpoint will be added for each index point in the  cuesheet
              to the SEEKTABLE unless --no-cued-seekpoints is specified.

       <b>--picture</b>={<u>FILENAME|SPECIFICATION</u>}
              Import  a picture and store it in a PICTURE metadata block.  More than one --picture option can be
              specified.  Either a filename for the picture file or a more complete specification  form  can  be
              used.  The <u>SPECIFICATION</u> is a string whose parts are separated by | (pipe) characters.  Some parts
              may  be  left  empty  to  invoke  default  values.  Specifying only <u>FILENAME</u> is just shorthand for
              “||||FILENAME”.  See the section <b>Picture</b> <b>specification</b> for <u>SPECIFICATION</u> format.

       <b>-S</b> {#|X|#x|#s}, <b>--seekpoint</b>={#|X|#x|#s}
              Specifies point(s) to include in SEEKTABLE, to override the encoder’s default choice  of  one  per
              ten  seconds  (`-s  10s').   Using  #,  a  seek  point at that sample number is added.  Using X, a
              placeholder point is added at the end of a the table.  Using #x, # evenly spaced seek points  will
              be added, the first being at sample 0.  Using #s, a seekpoint will be added every # seconds, where
              decimal  points  are  locale-dependent,  e.g.   `-s 9.5s' or `-s 9,5s'.  Several -S options may be
              given; the resulting SEEKTABLE will contain all seekpoints specified (duplicates removed).   Note:
              `-S  #x' and `-S #s' will not work if the encoder cannot determine the input size before starting.
              Note: if you use `-S #' with # being &gt;= the number of samples in the input, there will  be  either
              no  seek point entered (if the input size is determinable before encoding starts) or a placeholder
              point (if input size is not determinable).  Use --no-seektable for no SEEKTABLE.

       <b>-P</b> #, <b>--padding</b>=#
              (Default: 8192 bytes, although 65536 for input above 20 minutes.)  Tell the  encoder  to  write  a
              PADDING  metadata block of the given length (in bytes) after the STREAMINFO block.  This is useful
              for later tagging, where one can write over the PADDING block instead of  having  to  rewrite  the
              entire file.  Note that a block header of 4 bytes will come on top of the length specified.

       <b>-T</b> “<u>FIELD=VALUE</u>”<b>,</b> <b>--tag</b>=“<u>FIELD=VALUE</u>”
              Add  a  FLAC tag.  The comment must adhere to the Vorbis comment spec; i.e. the FIELD must contain
              only legal characters, terminated by an  `equals'  sign.   Make  sure  to  quote  the  content  if
              necessary.   This option may appear more than once to add several Vorbis comments.  NOTE: all tags
              will be added to all encoded files.

       <b>--tag-from-file</b>=“<u>FIELD=FILENAME</u>”
              Like --tag, except FILENAME is a file whose contents will be read verbatim to set the  tag  value.
              The  contents  will  be  converted  to  UTF-8 from the local charset.  This can be used to store a
              cuesheet in a tag (e.g. --tag-from-file=“CUESHEET=image.cue”).  Do not try to store binary data in
              tag fields!  Use APPLICATION blocks for that.

   <b>FORMAT</b> <b>OPTIONS</b>
       Encoding defaults to FLAC and not OGG.  Decoding defaults to WAVE (more specifically WAVE_FORMAT_PCM  for
       mono/stereo  with  8/16  bits,  and  to  WAVE_FORMAT_EXTENSIBLE otherwise), except: will be overridden by
       chunks found by --keep-foreign-metadata-if-present or --keep-foreign-metadata

       <b>--ogg</b>  When encoding, generate Ogg FLAC output instead of native FLAC.  Ogg FLAC streams are FLAC streams
              wrapped in an Ogg transport layer.  The resulting file should have an `.oga'  extension  and  will
              still  be  decodable  by flac.  When decoding, force the input to be treated as Ogg FLAC.  This is
              useful when piping input from stdin or when the filename does not end in `.oga' or `.ogg'.

       <b>--serial-number</b>=#
              When used with --ogg, specifies the serial number to use for the first Ogg FLAC stream,  which  is
              then  incremented  for  each additional stream.  When encoding and no serial number is given, flac
              uses a random number for the first stream, then increments it for each  additional  stream.   When
              decoding and no number is given, flac uses the serial number of the first page.

       <b>--force-aiff-format</b>
       <b>--force-rf64-format</b>
       <b>--force-wave64-format</b>   :   For   decoding:   Override   default   output  format  and  force  output  to
       AIFF/RF64/WAVE64, respectively.  This option is not needed if the output filename (as  set  by  -o)  ends
       with  <u>.aif</u>  or  <u>.aiff</u>,  <u>.rf64</u>  and  <u>.w64</u>  respectively.  The encoder auto-detects format and ignores this
       option.

       <b>--force-legacy-wave-format</b>
       <b>--force-extensible-wave-format</b> : Instruct the decoder to output a  WAVE  file  with  WAVE_FORMAT_PCM  and
       WAVE_FORMAT_EXTENSIBLE respectively, overriding default choice.

       <b>--force-aiff-c-none-format</b>
       <b>--force-aiff-c-sowt-format</b>  :  Instruct  the  decoder  to output an AIFF-C file with format NONE and sowt
       respectively.

       <b>--force-raw-format</b>
              Force input (when encoding) or output (when decoding) to  be  treated  as  raw  samples  (even  if
              filename suggests otherwise).

   <b>raw</b> <b>format</b> <b>options</b>
       When encoding from or decoding to raw PCM, format must be specified.

       <b>--sign</b>={signed|unsigned}
              Specify the sign of samples.

       <b>--endian</b>={big|little}
              Specify the byte order for samples

       <b>--channels</b>=#
              (Input  only)  specify  number of channels.  The channels must be interleaved, and in the order of
              the FLAC format (see the format specification); the encoder (/decoder) cannot re-order channels.

       <b>--bps</b>=#
              (Input only) specify bits per sample (per channel: 16 for CDDA.)

       <b>--sample-rate</b>=#
              (Input only) specify sample rate (in Hz.  Only integers supported.)

       <b>--input-size</b>=#
              (Input only) specify the size of the raw input in bytes.  This  option  is  only  compulsory  when
              encoding  from  stdin and using options that need to know the input size beforehand (like, --skip,
              --until, --cuesheet ) The encoder will truncate at the specified  size  if  the  input  stream  is
              bigger.  If the input stream is smaller, it will complain about an unexpected end-of-file.

   <b>ANALYSIS</b> <b>OPTIONS</b>
       <b>--residual-text</b>
              Includes  the residual signal in the analysis file.  This will make the file very big, much larger
              than even the decoded file.

       <b>--residual-gnuplot</b>
              Generates a gnuplot file for every subframe; each file will contain the residual  distribution  of
              the subframe.  This will create a lot of files.  gnuplot must be installed separately.

   <b>NEGATIVE</b> <b>OPTIONS</b>
       The following will negate an option previously given:

       <b>--no-adaptive-mid-side</b>
       <b>--no-cued-seekpoints</b>
       <b>--no-decode-through-errors</b>
       <b>--no-delete-input-file</b>
       <b>--no-preserve-modtime</b>
       <b>--no-keep-foreign-metadata</b>
       <b>--no-exhaustive-model-search</b>
       <b>--no-force</b>

       <b>--no-verify</b>
       <b>--no-warnings-as-errors</b>

   <b>ReplayGain</b> <b>application</b> <b>specification</b>
       The  option  --apply-replaygain-which-is-not-lossless[=&lt;specification&gt;]  applies  ReplayGain values while
       decoding.  <b>WARNING:</b> <b>THIS</b> <b>IS</b> <b>NOT</b> <b>LOSSLESS.</b>  <b>DECODED</b> <b>AUDIO</b> <b>WILL</b> <b>NOT</b> <b>BE</b> <b>IDENTICAL</b> <b>TO</b> <b>THE</b> <b>ORIGINAL</b> <b>WITH</b>  <b>THIS</b>
       <b>OPTION.</b> This option is useful for example in transcoding media servers, where the client does not support
       ReplayGain.

       The  &lt;specification&gt;  is  a  shorthand notation for describing how to apply ReplayGain.  All elements are
       optional - defaulting to 0aLn1 - but order is important.  The format is:

       [&lt;preamp&gt;][a|t][l|L][n{0|1|2|3}]

       In which the following parameters are used:

       • <b>preamp</b>: A floating point number in dB.  This is added to the existing gain value.

       • <b>a|t</b>: Specify `a' to use the album gain, or `t' to use the track gain.  If tags for the  preferred  kind
         (album/track) do not exist but tags for the other (track/album) do, those will be used instead.

       • <b>l|L</b>:  Specify  `l'  to peak-limit the output, so that the ReplayGain peak value is full-scale.  Specify
         `L' to use a 6dB hard limiter that kicks in when the signal approaches full-scale.

       • <b>n{0|1|2|3}</b>: Specify the amount of noise shaping.  ReplayGain synthesis happens in floating  point;  the
         result  is  dithered  before  converting back to integer.  This quantization adds noise.  Noise shaping
         tries to move the noise where you won’t hear it as much.  0 means no noise shaping, 1  means  `low',  2
         means `medium', 3 means `high'.

       For  example,  the  default of 0aLn1 means 0dB preamp, use album gain, 6dB hard limit, low noise shaping.
       --apply-replaygain-which-is-not-lossless=3 means 3dB preamp,  use  album  gain,  no  limiting,  no  noise
       shaping.

       flac  uses  the ReplayGain tags for the calculation.  If a stream does not have the required tags or they
       can’t be parsed, decoding will continue with a warning, and no ReplayGain is applied to that stream.

   <b>Picture</b> <b>specification</b>
       This      described      the      specification      used      for      the       <b>--picture</b>       option.
       [<u>TYPE</u>]|[<u>MIME-TYPE</u>]|[<u>DESCRIPTION</u>]|[<u>WIDTHxHEIGHTxDEPTH</u>[/<u>COLORS</u>]]|<u>FILE</u>

       <u>TYPE</u> is optional; it is a number from one of:

        0. Other

        1. 32x32 pixels `file icon' (PNG only)

        2. Other file icon

        3. Cover (front)

        4. Cover (back)

        5. Leaflet page

        6. Media (e.g. label side of CD)

        7. Lead artist/lead performer/soloist

        8. Artist/performer

        9. Conductor

       10. Band/Orchestra

       11. Composer

       12. Lyricist/text writer

       13. Recording Location

       14. During recording

       15. During performance

       16. Movie/video screen capture

       17. A bright coloured fish

       18. Illustration

       19. Band/artist logotype

       20. Publisher/Studio logotype

       The default is 3 (front cover).  There may only be one picture each of type 1 and 2 in a file.

       <u>MIME-TYPE</u>  is  optional;  if  left blank, it will be detected from the file.  For best compatibility with
       players, use pictures with MIME type image/jpeg or image/png.  The MIME type can also be --&gt; to mean that
       FILE is actually a URL to an image, though this use is discouraged.

       <u>DESCRIPTION</u> is optional; the default is an empty string.

       The next part specifies the resolution and color information.  If the <u>MIME-TYPE</u> is image/jpeg, image/png,
       or image/gif, you can usually leave this empty and they can be detected from the  file.   Otherwise,  you
       must  specify the width in pixels, height in pixels, and color depth in bits-per-pixel.  If the image has
       indexed colors you should also specify the number of colors used.  When manually  specified,  it  is  not
       checked against the file for accuracy.

       <u>FILE</u> is the path to the picture file to be imported, or the URL if MIME type is --&gt;

       <b>Specification</b> <b>examples:</b> “|image/jpeg|||../cover.jpg” will embed the JPEG file at ../cover.jpg, defaulting
       to  type  3 (front cover) and an empty description.  The resolution and color info will be retrieved from
       the file itself.  “4|--&gt;|CD|320x300x24/173|<a href="http://blah.blah/backcover.tiff">http://blah.blah/backcover.tiff</a>” will  embed  the  given  URL,
       with  type  4  (back  cover),  description  “CD”,  and  a  manually  specified  resolution of 320x300, 24
       bits-per-pixel, and 173 colors.  The file at the URL will not be fetched; the URL itself is stored in the
       PICTURE metadata block.

   <b>Apodization</b> <b>functions</b>
       To improve LPC analysis, the audio data is windowed.  An <b>-A</b>  option  applies  the  specified  apodization
       function(s)  instead  of  the  default  (which  is “tukey(5e-1)”, though different for presets -6 to -8.)
       Specifying one more function effectively means, for each subframe, to try another weighting of  the  data
       and  see  if  it  happens  to  result  in  a  smaller  encoded subframe.  Specifying several functions is
       time-expensive, at typically diminishing compression gains.

       The subdivide_tukey(<u>N</u>) functions (see below)  used  in  presets  -6  to  -8  were  developed  to  recycle
       calculations  for  speed,  compared to using a number of independent functions.  Even then, a high number
       like <u>N</u>&gt;4 or 5, will often become less efficient than other options considered expensive, like the  slower
       -p, though results vary with signal.

       Up  to 32 functions can be given as comma-separated list and/or individual <b>-A</b> options.  Any mis-specified
       function is silently ignored.  Quoting a function which  takes  options  (and  has  parentheses)  may  be
       necessary,   depending   on   shell.   Currently  the  following  functions  are  implemented:  bartlett,
       bartlett_hann, blackman,  blackman_harris_4term_92db,  connes,  flattop,  gauss(<u>STDDEV</u>),  hamming,  hann,
       kaiser_bessel,      nuttall,      rectangle,      triangle,      tukey(<u>P</u>),     partial_tukey(<u>N</u>[/<u>OV</u>[/<u>P</u>]]),
       punchout_tukey(<u>N</u>[/<u>OV</u>[/<u>P</u>]]), subdivide_tukey(<u>N</u>[/<u>P</u>]), welch.

       For parameters <u>P</u>, <u>STDDEV</u> and <u>OV</u>, scientific notation is supported,  e.g.   tukey(5e-1).   Otherwise,  the
       decimal point must agree with the locale, e.g. tukey(0.5) or tukey(0,5) depending on your system.

       • For gauss(<u>STDDEV</u>), <u>STDDEV</u> is the standard deviation (0&lt;<u>STDDEV</u>&lt;=5e-1).

       • For  tukey(<u>P</u>),  <u>P</u>  (between  0  and 1) specifies the fraction of the window that is cosine-tapered; <u>P</u>=0
         corresponds to “rectangle” and <u>P</u>=1 to “hann”.

       • partial_tukey(<u>N</u>)  and  punchout_tukey(<u>N</u>)   are   largely   obsoleted   by   the   more   time-effective
         subdivide_tukey(<u>N</u>),  see  next  item.   They  generate  <u>N</u> functions each spanning a part of each block.
         Optional arguments are an overlap <u>OV</u> (&lt;1, may be negative), for example partial_tukey(2/2e-1); and then
         a taper parameter <u>P</u>, for example partial_tukey(2/2e-1/5e-1).

       • subdivide_tukey(<u>N</u>) is a more efficient  reimplementation  of  partial_tukey  and  punchout_tukey  taken
         together,   combining   the   windows   they   would  generate  up  to  the  specified  <u>N</u>.   Specifying
         <a href="../man3/subdivide_tukey.3.html">subdivide_tukey</a>(3) entails a tukey, a <a href="../man2/partial_tukey.2.html">partial_tukey</a>(2), a  <a href="../man3/partial_tukey.3.html">partial_tukey</a>(3)  and  a  <a href="../man3/punchout_tukey.3.html">punchout_tukey</a>(3);
         specifying  <a href="../man5/subdivide_tukey.5.html">subdivide_tukey</a>(5)  will  on  top  of  that  add a <a href="../man4/partial_tukey.4.html">partial_tukey</a>(4), a <a href="../man4/punchout_tukey.4.html">punchout_tukey</a>(4), a
         <a href="../man5/partial_tukey.5.html">partial_tukey</a>(5) and a <a href="../man5/punchout_tukey.5.html">punchout_tukey</a>(5) - but all with tapering chosen to  facilitate  the  re-use  of
         computation.   Thus  the  <u>P</u> parameter (defaulting to 5e-1) is applied for the smallest used window: For
         example,  subdivide_tukey(2/5e-1)  results  in  the  same   taper   as   that   of   tukey(25e-2)   and
         <a href="../man5/subdivide_tukey.5.html">subdivide_tukey</a>(5) in the same taper as of tukey(1e-1).
