</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       exifgrep - select and reformat the output of <b>exifprobe</b>

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>exifgrep</b> [<u>options</u>] [<u>egrep_options</u>] <u>egrep_pattern</u> [<u>NOT</u> <u>egrep-pattern]</u> <u>filename(s)</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Exifgrep</b>  is  a  shell  script  which  applies  <b><a href="../man1/egrep.1.html">egrep</a>(1)</b>  to  the output of <b>exifprobe</b> <u>-L</u>, permitting easy
       selection and minor reformatting of output items.

       <b>exifprobe</b> is small, fast, and utterly sycophantic in its desire to  report  <u>everything</u>  it  finds  in  an
       image.   <b>exifgrep</b>  applies the regular expression matching capabilities of <b>egrep</b> to the output barrage to
       extract only wanted information.

       <b>exifgrep</b> also performs a mild form of selection on  the  output  fields  of  <b>exifprobe</b>  <u>-L</u>.   Many  items
       reported  by exifprobe are represented in the image file by a <u>number</u> which compactly represents a defined
       value.

       E.g. <b>exifprobe</b> <u>-L</u> may report

       TIFF.Ifd1.ResolutionUnit              = 2 = 'pixels per inch'

       where the value “2” must be  interpreted  to  mean  that  resolution  values  (<u>TIFF.IFd1.Xresolution</u>  and
       <u>TIFF.IFd1.YResolution</u>)  are  recorded  in  pixels  per  inch,  rather  than,  say, pixels per centimeter.
       <b>exifprobe</b> reports both fields; <b>exifprobe</b> may also report interpreted values for items which are  recorded
       in unfamiliar units, such as

       JPEG.APP1.Ifd0.Exif.FNumber           = 5.6 APEX = 'f7.0'

       In all such cases, <b>exifgrep</b> reports (by default) only the "human readable" field:

       TIFF.Ifd1.ResolutionUnit = 'pixels per inch'
       JPEG.APP1.Ifd0.Exif.FNumber = 'f7.0'

       unless the "<u>-num</u>" option is given to select the numerical value.

       In addition, a `variable' format may be selected ("<u>-var</u>") which eliminates whitespace, providing a format
       which typical shells may use directly to set variables for further processing.  E.g.

       TIFF.Ifd1.ResolutionUnit='pixels per inch'
       JPEG.APP1.Ifd0.Exif.FNumber='f7.0'

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       -r        <u>file</u>  arguments  may  be  directories,  which  will  be  searched  via <b>find</b> for all image types
                 recognized by <b>exifprobe</b>.

       -n        force <b>exifprobe</b> to print a filename for each line of its output, which <u>exifgrep</u> will turn  into
                 a comment at the end of each matching line.

       -t        force <b>exifprobe</b> to print tag numbers for all itemes that have them, so that matches may be made
                 on hex or decimal tag numbers.

       -c        turn on color output from <b>exifprobe</b>

       -h        print a usage message (help)

       -var      report  in  "variable"  format,  which may be directly `sourced' by any Bourne-compatible shell
                 (except that most shells will insist that the dots must be replaced, e.g. by underscores).

       -export   report in "variable" format, but with a Bourne-compatible <u>export</u> command

       -num      report numerical values rather than interpreted strings, for fields which have both.

       NOTE: the <u>-var</u> and <u>-export</u> options are obsolescent; they are  retained  for  compatibility  with  earlier
       versions  of  <u>exifprobe</u>.   A  post-processor  such  as  <u>reformat.sh</u> may be more effective for the current
       version if shell-compatible output is desired.

       Any option not recognized by the script will be passed on to <b>egrep</b>.

       The first non-option argument will be used as the pattern passed to <b>egrep</b>.  This may be followed  by  the
       keyword  <u>NOT</u> and an expression representing matches to be <u>rejected</u>.  This pattern will be passed to <b>egrep</b>
       <u>-v</u>.  Only one argument of each type may be given, and the "accept"  expression  (if  given)  must  appear
       before the "reject" expression.

       All remaining arguments are interpreted as image filenames.
