</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       notcurses-input - Read and display input events

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>notcurses-input</b> [<b>-v</b>] [<b>-m</b>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>notcurses-input</b>  reads from stdin and decodes the input to stdout, including synthesized events and mouse
       events.  To exit, generate EOF (usually Ctrl+'d').

       Each event will be printed on a single line.  Leading that line is a series of modifier indicators:

       • 'A'/'a': Alt was or was not pressed.

       • 'C'/'c': Ctrl was or was not pressed.

       • 'S'/'s': Shift was or was not pressed.

       • 'U'/'u': Super was or was not pressed

       • 'M'/'m': Meta was or was not pressed.

       • 'H'/'h': Hyper was or was not pressed.

       • 'X'/'x': CapsLock was or was not pressed.

       • '#'/'.': NumLock was or was not pressed.

       • 'L'/'R'/'P'/'u': Key was a release, repeat, press, or of unknown type.

       By default, mice events are enabled.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-v</b>: Increase verbosity.  <b>-m</b>: Inhibit mice events.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       Mouse events are only generated for button presses and releases, and for movement while a button is  held
       down.
