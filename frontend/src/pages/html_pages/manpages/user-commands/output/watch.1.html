</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       watch - execute a program periodically, showing output fullscreen

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>watch</b> [<u>options</u>] <u>command</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>watch</b>  runs <u>command</u> repeatedly, displaying its output and errors (the first screenfull).  This allows you
       to watch the program output change over time.  By default, <u>command</u> is run every 2 seconds and <b>watch</b>  will
       run until interrupted.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-b</b>, <b>--beep</b>
              Beep if command has a non-zero exit.

       <b>-c</b>, <b>--color</b>
              Interpret ANSI color and style sequences.

       <b>-C</b>, <b>--no-color</b>
              Do not interpret ANSI color and style sequences.

       <b>-d</b>, <b>--differences</b>[=<u>permanent</u>]
              Highlight  the  differences  between  successive  updates.  If  the optional <u>permanent</u> argument is
              specified then <b>watch</b> will show all changes since the first iteration.

       <b>-e</b>, <b>--errexit</b>
              Freeze updates on command error, and exit after a key press.

       <b>-g</b>, <b>--chgexit</b>
              Exit when the output of <u>command</u> changes.

       <b>-n</b>, <b>--interval</b> <u>seconds</u>
              Specify update interval.  The command will not allow quicker than 0.1 second  interval,  in  which
              the  smaller  values  are  converted.  Both  '.'  and ',' work for any locales. The <b>WATCH_INTERVAL</b>
              environment can be used to persistently set a non-default interval (following the same  rules  and
              formatting).

       <b>-p</b>, <b>--precise</b>
              Make  <b>watch</b> attempt to run <u>command</u> every <b>--interval</b> <u>seconds</u>.  Try it with <b>ntptime</b> (if present) and
              notice how the fractional seconds stays (nearly) the same, as opposed to normal  mode  where  they
              continuously increase.

       <b>-q</b>, <b>--equexit</b> &lt;cycles&gt;
              Exit when output of <u>command</u> does not change for the given number of cycles.

       <b>-r</b>, <b>--no-rerun</b>
              Do  not  run  the program on terminal resize, the output of the program will re-appear at the next
              regular run time.

       <b>-t</b>, <b>--no-title</b>
              Turn off the header showing the interval, command, and current time at the top of the display,  as
              well as the following blank line.

       <b>-w</b>, <b>--no-wrap</b>
              Turn off line wrapping. Long lines will be truncated instead of wrapped to the next line.

       <b>-x</b>, <b>--exec</b>
              Pass  <u>command</u>  to  <b><a href="../man2/exec.2.html">exec</a></b>(2) instead of <b>sh</b> <b>-c</b> which reduces the need to use extra quoting to get the
              desired effect.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
              Display help text and exit.

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--version</b>
              Display version information and exit.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
              <b>0</b>      Success.
              <b>1</b>      Various failures.
              <b>2</b>      Forking the process to watch failed.
              <b>3</b>      Replacing child process stdout with write side pipe failed.
              <b>4</b>      Command execution failed.
              <b>5</b>      Closing child process write pipe failed.
              <b>7</b>      IPC pipe creation failed.
              <b>8</b>      Getting child process return value with <b><a href="../man2/waitpid.2.html">waitpid</a></b>(2) failed, or command exited up on error.
              <b>other</b>  The watch will propagate command exit status as child exit status.
</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       The behavior of <b>watch</b> is affected by the following environment variables.

       <b>WATCH_INTERVAL</b>
              Update interval, follows the same rules as the <b>--interval</b> command line option.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       POSIX option processing is used (i.e., option processing stops at the first non-option  argument).   This
       means that flags after <u>command</u> don't get interpreted by <b>watch</b> itself.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Upon  terminal  resize,  the screen will not be correctly repainted until the next scheduled update.  All
       <b>--differences</b> highlighting is lost on that update as well. When using the <b>--no-rerun</b> option, no output of
       will be visible.

       Non-printing characters are stripped from program output.  Use <b>cat</b> <b>-v</b> as part of the command pipeline  if
       you want to see them.

       Combining  Characters  that are supposed to display on the character at the last column on the screen may
       display one column early, or they may not display at all.

       Combining Characters never count as different in <b>--differences</b> mode.  Only the base character counts.

       Blank lines directly after a line which ends in the last column do not display.

       <b>--precise</b> mode doesn't yet have advanced temporal distortion technology to compensate for a <u>command</u>  that
       takes  more  than <b>--interval</b> <u>seconds</u> to execute.  <b>watch</b> also can get into a state where it rapid-fires as
       many executions of <u>command</u> as it can  to  catch  up  from  a  previous  executions  running  longer  than
       <b>--interval</b> (for example, <b><a href="../man8/netstat.8.html">netstat</a></b>(8) taking ages on a DNS lookup).

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       To watch for mail, you might do
              watch -n 60 from
       To watch the contents of a directory change, you could use
              watch -d ls -l
       If you're only interested in files owned by user joe, you might use
              watch -d 'ls -l | fgrep joe'
       To see the effects of quoting, try these out
              watch echo $$
              watch echo '$$'
              watch echo "'"'$$'"'"
       To see the effect of precision time keeping, try adding <b>-p</b> to
              watch -n 10 sleep 1
       You can watch for your administrator to install the latest kernel with
              watch uname -r
       (Note  that <b>-p</b> isn't guaranteed to work across reboots, especially in the face of <b>ntpdate</b> (if present) or
       other bootup time-changing mechanisms)
