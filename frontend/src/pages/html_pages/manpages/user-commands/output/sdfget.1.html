       sdfget - Documentation Extraction Utility

</pre><h4><b>PURPOSE</b></h4><pre>
       <u>sdfget</u> extracts documentation embedded in source code.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
        usage  : sdfget [-h[help]] [-o[out_ext]]
                [-l[log_ext]] [-O[out_dir]]
                [-f formatting_filename] [-g[get_rule]]
                [-r[rpt_file]] [-s scope] [-i]
                [-v[verbose]] file ...
       purpose: extract documentation embedded in source code
       version: 2.000    (SDF 2.001)

       The options are:

        Option       Description
        -h           display help on options
        -o           output file extension
        -l           log file extension
        -O           output to input file's (or explicit) directory
        -f           filename to use when formatting the output
        -g           rule to use to get documentation
        -r           report file
        -s           scope of documentation to be extracted
        -i           only output lines not extracted
        -v           verbose mode

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The -h option provides help. If it is specified without a parameter, a brief description of each option
       is displayed. To display the attributes for an option, specify the option letter as a parameter.

       By default, generated output goes to standard output. To direct output to a file per input file, use the
       -o option to specify an extension for output files. If the -o option is specified without a parameter, an
       extension of <u>out</u> is assumed.

       Likewise, error messages go to standard error by default. Use the -l option to create a log file per
       input file. If the -l option is specified without a parameter, an extension of <u>log</u> is assumed.

       By default, generated output and log files are created in the current directory. Use the -O option to
       specify an explicit output directory.  If the -O option is specified without a parameter, the input
       file's directory is used.

       The -f option can be used to specify a filename to use when formatting the output. This is useful when
       the text is coming from the standard input stream.

       The <u>get-rule</u> nominates the formatting of the embedded documentation to be extracted. All currently
       defined get-rules assume the documentation is in comment blocks in one of the following formats:

        &gt;&gt;section_title1::
        text of section 1, line 1
        text of section 1, line ..

        &gt;&gt;section_title2::
        text of section 2, line 1
        text of section 2, line ..
        &gt;&gt;END::

        &gt;&gt;section_title3:: text of section 3

       The first form is most commonly used. In this format, the text in a section extends until the end of the
       current "comment block" or the start of the next section, whichever comes first. The second form (i.e.
       explicitly specifying where the section ends) is useful if you wish to add some normal comments (i.e.
       non-documentation) which you do not want extracted. If the text is short, the third form can be used.
       Regardless of the format, if a section is found which is already defined, the text of the section is
       concatenated onto the existing text. This permits the documentation for each entity to be specified
       immediately above where it is defined in the source code.

       The -g option specifies the <u>get-rule</u> to use. The available get-rules differ on the prefix expected at the
       front of each line as shown below.

        Rule                              Prefix
        perl                              #
        cpp                               //
        c                                 * or /*
        fortran                           c (with 5 preceding spaces)
        eiffel                            --
        bat                               rem

       Within C code, a trailing space is required after the characters above. For other languages, a trailing
       space is optional. Within FORTRAN code, the "c" character must be preceded by exactly 5 spaces.  For
       other languages, zero or more whitespace characters are permitted before the characters above.

       For example, embedded documentation within C code looks like:

        /* &gt;&gt;Purpose::
         * This library provides a high level interface
         * to commonly used network services.
         */

       If the -g option is not specified, <u>perl</u> is the default get-rule. If the -g option is specified without a
       parameter, the extension in lowercase of the filename (or the <u>formatting</u> <u>filename</u> if the text is coming
       from standard input) is used to guess the get_rule as shown below.

        Rule                              Extensions
        cpp                               cpp, c++, cc, hpp, hpp, h, java, idl
        c                                 c
        fortran                           fortran, for, f77, f
        eiffel                            eiffel, ada
        bat                               bat, cmd

       A report filename can be specified using the -r option. If the name doesn't include an extension, sdg is
       assumed. Reports provide a mechanism for:

       •   selectively extracting sections, and

       •   rudimentary reformatting (e.g. to <u>SDF</u>)

       If no report is specified, all sections are output in the following format:

        section_title1
        section_text1

        section_title2
        section_text2

       If  -r  is  specified on its own, <u>default.sdg</u> is assumed. This report selects the set of sections (within
       the <u>SDF</u> documentation standards) which form the user documentation and formats them into <u>SDF</u>. Details  on
       the  report  format  are  specified below. Reports are searched for in the current directory, then in the
       <u>stdlib</u> directory within SDF's library directory.

       The -s option can be used to specify the scope  of  the  documentation  to  be  extracted.  (This  is  an
       experimental feature and may change so most users should avoid using it.)

       The  -i  option  outputs  only  those  lines  which the get-rule did not match. This option is useful for
       extracting non-documentation from a file to give just the code.

       <b>Note:</b> The -r option is ignored if -i is specified.

       The -v option enables verbose mode. This is useful for seeing which rule is being used for each file.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       To extract the user documentation from a <u>SDF</u> application written in C++  (<u>xyz</u>,  say)  and  save  it  into
       <u>xyz.sdf</u>:

             sdfget -gcpp -r -osdf xyz.cpp

</pre><h4><b>LIMITATIONS</b> <b>AND</b> <b>FUTURE</b> <b>DIRECTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       It would be nicer if the get-rule was always guessed from the filename extension but changing the default
       from  perl  could  break  existing  scripts.  Therefore,  get-rule guessing must be explicitly enabled by
       specifging the -g option without a parameter.
