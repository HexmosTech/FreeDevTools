</pre><h4><b>PROLOG</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       printf — write formatted output

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       printf <u>format</u> <b>[</b><u>argument</u>...<b>]</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>printf</u> utility shall write formatted operands to the standard output. The <u>argument</u> operands shall be
       formatted under control of the <u>format</u> operand.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>OPERANDS</b></h4><pre>
       The following operands shall be supported:

       <u>format</u>    A string describing the format to use to  write  the  remaining  operands.   See  the  EXTENDED
                 DESCRIPTION section.

       <u>argument</u>  The  strings  to  be written to standard output, under the control of <u>format</u>.  See the EXTENDED
                 DESCRIPTION section.

</pre><h4><b>STDIN</b></h4><pre>
       Not used.

</pre><h4><b>INPUT</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of <u>printf</u>:

       <u>LANG</u>      Provide a default value for the internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See the
                 Base Definitions volume  of  POSIX.1‐2017,  <u>Section</u>  <u>8.2</u>,  <u>Internationalization</u>  <u>Variables</u>  the
                 precedence   of   internationalization  variables  used  to  determine  the  values  of  locale
                 categories.)

       <u>LC_ALL</u>    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values of all the  other  internationalization
                 variables.

       <u>LC_CTYPE</u>  Determine  the  locale  for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of text data as characters
                 (for example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments).

       <u>LC_MESSAGES</u>
                 Determine the locale that should be used to  affect  the  format  and  contents  of  diagnostic
                 messages written to standard error.

       <u>LC_NUMERIC</u>
                 Determine  the  locale  for  numeric  formatting. It shall affect the format of numbers written
                 using the <b>e</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>f</b>, <b>g</b>, and <b>G</b> conversion specifier characters (if supported).

       <u>NLSPATH</u>   Determine the location of message catalogs for the processing of <u>LC_MESSAGES</u>.

</pre><h4><b>STDERR</b></h4><pre>
       The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.

</pre><h4><b>OUTPUT</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>EXTENDED</b> <b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>format</u> operand shall be used as the <u>format</u>  string  described  in  the  Base  Definitions  volume  of
       POSIX.1‐2017, <u>Chapter</u> <u>5</u>, <u>File</u> <u>Format</u> <u>Notation</u> with the following exceptions:

        1. A &lt;space&gt; in the format string, in any context other than a flag of a conversion specification, shall
           be treated as an ordinary character that is copied to the output.

        2. A <b>'</b>' character in the format string shall be treated as a <b>'</b>' character, not as a &lt;space&gt;.

        3. In  addition to the escape sequences shown in the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <u>Chapter</u> <u>5</u>,
           <u>File</u> <u>Format</u> <u>Notation</u> (<b>'\\'</b>, <b>'\a'</b>, <b>'\b'</b>, <b>'\f'</b>, <b>'\n'</b>, <b>'\r'</b>, <b>'\t'</b>, <b>'\v'</b>), <b>"\ddd"</b>, where <u>ddd</u>  is  a  one,
           two,  or three-digit octal number, shall be written as a byte with the numeric value specified by the
           octal number.

        4. The implementation shall not precede or follow output from the <b>d</b>  or  <b>u</b>  conversion  specifiers  with
           &lt;blank&gt; characters not specified by the <u>format</u> operand.

        5. The  implementation shall not precede output from the <b>o</b> conversion specifier with zeros not specified
           by the <u>format</u> operand.

        6. The <b>a</b>, <b>A</b>, <b>e</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>f</b>, <b>F</b>, <b>g</b>, and <b>G</b> conversion specifiers need not be supported.

        7. An additional conversion specifier character, <b>b</b>, shall be supported as follows. The argument shall be
           taken to be a string that can contain &lt;backslash&gt;-escape sequences. The following  &lt;backslash&gt;-escape
           sequences shall be supported:

           --  The  escape  sequences  listed  in  the  Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <u>Chapter</u> <u>5</u>, <u>File</u>
               <u>Format</u> <u>Notation</u> (<b>'\\'</b>, <b>'\a'</b>, <b>'\b'</b>, <b>'\f'</b>, <b>'\n'</b>, <b>'\r'</b>, <b>'\t'</b>, <b>'\v'</b>), which shall be converted to the
               characters they represent

           --  <b>"\0ddd"</b>, where <u>ddd</u> is a zero, one, two, or three-digit octal number that shall be converted to  a
               byte with the numeric value specified by the octal number

           --  <b>'\c'</b>, which shall not be written and shall cause <u>printf</u> to ignore any remaining characters in the
               string operand containing it, any remaining string operands, and any additional characters in the
               <u>format</u> operand

           The interpretation of a &lt;backslash&gt; followed by any other sequence of characters is unspecified.

           Bytes  from  the converted string shall be written until the end of the string or the number of bytes
           indicated by the precision specification is reached. If the precision is omitted, it shall  be  taken
           to be infinite, so all bytes up to the end of the converted string shall be written.

        8. For  each  conversion  specification  that  consumes  an argument, the next <u>argument</u> operand shall be
           evaluated and converted to the appropriate type for the conversion as specified below.

        9. The <u>format</u> operand shall be reused as often as necessary to satisfy the <u>argument</u> operands. Any  extra
           <b>b</b>, <b>c</b>, or <b>s</b> conversion specifiers shall be evaluated as if a null string argument were supplied; other
           extra conversion specifications shall be evaluated as if a zero argument were supplied. If the <u>format</u>
           operand  contains  no  conversion  specifications  and <u>argument</u> operands are present, the results are
           unspecified.

       10. If a character sequence in the <u>format</u> operand begins with a <b>'%'</b> character, but does not form a  valid
           conversion specification, the behavior is unspecified.

       11. The  argument  to  the  <b>c</b>  conversion  specifier can be a string containing zero or more bytes. If it
           contains one or more bytes, the first byte shall  be  written  and  any  additional  bytes  shall  be
           ignored.  If  the argument is an empty string, it is unspecified whether nothing is written or a null
           byte is written.

       The <u>argument</u> operands shall be treated as strings if the corresponding conversion specifier is <b>b</b>,  <b>c</b>,  or
       <b>s</b>,  and shall be evaluated as if by the <u>strtod</u>() function if the corresponding conversion specifier is <b>a</b>,
       <b>A</b>, <b>e</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>f</b>, <b>F</b>, <b>g</b>, or <b>G</b>.  Otherwise, they shall  be  evaluated  as  unsuffixed  C  integer  constants,  as
       described by the ISO C standard, with the following extensions:

        *  A leading &lt;plus-sign&gt; or &lt;hyphen-minus&gt; shall be allowed.

        *  If  the  leading character is a single-quote or double-quote, the value shall be the numeric value in
           the underlying codeset of the character following the single-quote or double-quote.

        *  Suffixed integer constants may be allowed.

       If an <u>argument</u> operand cannot  be  completely  converted  into  an  internal  value  appropriate  to  the
       corresponding  conversion  specification, a diagnostic message shall be written to standard error and the
       utility shall not exit with a zero exit status, but shall continue processing any remaining operands  and
       shall write the value accumulated at the time the error was detected to standard output.

       It  shall  not  be  considered  an  error  if an <u>argument</u> operand is not completely used for a <b>b</b>, <b>c</b>, or <b>s</b>
       conversion.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       The following exit values shall be returned:

        0    Successful completion.

       &gt;0    An error occurred.

</pre><h4><b>CONSEQUENCES</b> <b>OF</b> <b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       Default.

       <u>The</u> <u>following</u> <u>sections</u> <u>are</u> <u>informative.</u>

</pre><h4><b>APPLICATION</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       The floating-point formatting  conversion  specifications  of  <u>printf</u>()  are  not  required  because  all
       arithmetic  in  the shell is integer arithmetic. The <u>awk</u> utility performs floating-point calculations and
       provides its  own  <b>printf</b>  function.  The  <u>bc</u>  utility  can  perform  arbitrary-precision  floating-point
       arithmetic, but does not provide extensive formatting capabilities. (This <u>printf</u> utility cannot really be
       used  to  format  <u>bc</u>  output; it does not support arbitrary precision.) Implementations are encouraged to
       support the floating-point conversions as an extension.

       Note that this <u>printf</u> utility, like the <u>printf</u>() function defined in  the  System  Interfaces  volume  of
       POSIX.1‐2017 on which it is based, makes no special provision for dealing with multi-byte characters when
       using  the  <b>%c</b>  conversion  specification  or  when  a  precision  is  specified in a <b>%b</b> or <b>%s</b> conversion
       specification. Applications should be extremely cautious using either of these features  when  there  are
       multi-byte characters in the character set.

       No  provision  is  made  in  this  volume  of POSIX.1‐2017 which allows field widths and precisions to be
       specified as <b>'*'</b> since the <b>'*'</b> can be replaced directly  in  the  <u>format</u>  operand  using  shell  variable
       substitution. Implementations can also provide this feature as an extension if they so choose.

       Hexadecimal character constants as defined in the ISO C standard are not recognized in the <u>format</u> operand
       because  there  is  no  consistent  way  to detect the end of the constant. Octal character constants are
       limited to, at most, three octal digits, but hexadecimal character constants are  only  terminated  by  a
       non-hex-digit  character. In the ISO C standard, the <b>"##"</b> concatenation operator can be used to terminate
       a constant and follow it with a hexadecimal character to be written. In the shell,  concatenation  occurs
       before the <u>printf</u> utility has a chance to parse the end of the hexadecimal constant.

       The  <b>%b</b>  conversion specification is not part of the ISO C standard; it has been added here as a portable
       way to process &lt;backslash&gt;-escapes expanded in string operands as provided by the <u>echo</u> utility. See  also
       the  APPLICATION USAGE section of <u>echo</u> for ways to use <u>printf</u> as a replacement for all of the traditional
       versions of the <u>echo</u> utility.

       If an argument cannot be parsed correctly for the  corresponding  conversion  specification,  the  <u>printf</u>
       utility  is  required  to  report  an  error.  Thus,  overflow and extraneous characters at the end of an
       argument being used for a numeric conversion shall be reported as errors.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       To alert the user and then print and read a series of prompts:

           printf "\aPlease fill in the following: \nName: "
           read name
           printf "Phone number: "
           read phone

       To read out a list of right and wrong answers from a file, calculate the percentage correctly, and  print
       them  out. The numbers are right-justified and separated by a single &lt;tab&gt;.  The percentage is written to
       one decimal place of accuracy:

           while read right wrong ; do
               percent=$(echo "scale=1;($right*100)/($right+$wrong)" | bc)
               printf "%2d right\t%2d wrong\t(%s%%)\n" \
                   $right $wrong $percent
           done &lt; database_file

       The command:

           printf "%5d%4d\n" 1 21 321 4321 54321

       produces:

               1  21
             3214321
           54321   0

       Note that the <u>format</u> operand is used three times to print all of the given strings and  that  a  <b>'0'</b>  was
       supplied by <u>printf</u> to satisfy the last <b>%4d</b> conversion specification.

       The  <u>printf</u>  utility  is  required to notify the user when conversion errors are detected while producing
       numeric output; thus, the following results would be expected on  an  implementation  with  32-bit  twos-
       complement integers when <b>%d</b> is specified as the <u>format</u> operand:
                      ┌─────────────┬─────────────┬───────────────────────────────────────────┐
                      │             │  <b>Standard</b>   │                                           │
                      │  <b>Argument</b>   │   <b>Output</b>    │             <b>Diagnostic</b> <b>Output</b>             │
                      ├─────────────┼─────────────┼───────────────────────────────────────────┤
                      │ 5a          │ 5           │ printf: "5a" not completely converted     │
                      │ 9999999999  │ 2147483647  │ printf: "9999999999" arithmetic overflow  │
                      │ -9999999999 │ -2147483648 │ printf: "-9999999999" arithmetic overflow │
                      │ ABC         │ 0           │ printf: "ABC" expected numeric value      │
                      └─────────────┴─────────────┴───────────────────────────────────────────┘

       The  diagnostic  message  format is not specified, but these examples convey the type of information that
       should be reported. Note that the value shown on standard output is what would be expected as the  return
       value  from  the  <u>strtol</u>() function as defined in the System Interfaces volume of POSIX.1‐2017. A similar
       correspondence exists between <b>%u</b> and <u>strtoul</u>() and  <b>%e</b>,  <b>%f</b>,  and  <b>%g</b>  (if  the  implementation  supports
       floating-point conversions) and <u>strtod</u>().

       In a locale using the ISO/IEC 646:1991 standard as the underlying codeset, the command:

           printf "%d\n" 3 +3 -3 \'3 \"+3 "'-3"

       produces:

       3     Numeric value of constant 3

       3     Numeric value of constant 3

       -3    Numeric value of constant -3

       51    Numeric value of the character <b>'3'</b> in the ISO/IEC 646:1991 standard codeset

       43    Numeric value of the character <b>'+'</b> in the ISO/IEC 646:1991 standard codeset

       45    Numeric value of the character <b>'-'</b> in the ISO/IEC 646:1991 standard codeset

       Note that in a locale with multi-byte characters, the value of a character is intended to be the value of
       the  equivalent  of  the  <b>wchar_t</b>  representation  of the character as described in the System Interfaces
       volume of POSIX.1‐2017.

</pre><h4><b>RATIONALE</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>printf</u> utility was added to provide functionality  that  has  historically  been  provided  by  <u>echo</u>.
       However,  due  to  irreconcilable differences in the various versions of <u>echo</u> extant, the version has few
       special features, leaving those to this new <u>printf</u> utility, which is based on one in  the  Ninth  Edition
       system.

       The  EXTENDED  DESCRIPTION  section  almost  exactly matches the <u>printf</u>() function in the ISO C standard,
       although it is described in terms of  the  file  format  notation  in  the  Base  Definitions  volume  of
       POSIX.1‐2017, <u>Chapter</u> <u>5</u>, <u>File</u> <u>Format</u> <u>Notation</u>.

       Earlier  versions  of  this  standard specified that arguments for all conversions other than <b>b</b>, <b>c</b>, and <b>s</b>
       were evaluated in the same way  (as  C  constants,  but  with  stated  exceptions).  For  implementations
       supporting  the  floating-point conversions it was not clear whether integer conversions need only accept
       integer constants and floating-point conversions need only accept floating-point  constants,  or  whether
       both types of conversions should accept both types of constants. Also by not distinguishing between them,
       the  requirement relating to a leading single-quote or double-quote applied to floating-point conversions
       even though this provided no useful functionality to applications that was not already available  through
       the  integer  conversions.  The current standard clarifies the situation by specifying that the arguments
       for floating-point conversions are evaluated as if by <u>strtod</u>(), and the arguments for integer conversions
       are evaluated as C integer constants, with the special treatment of leading single-quote and double-quote
       applying only to integer conversions.
