</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
<b>tablix2</b> [ <u>options</u> ] <u>file</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
Output  is  given  in  the  form  of a XML file. This file can be further processed by <b>tablix2_output</b> utility to
</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
</pre><h4><b>-n</b> <b>N</b></h4><pre>
 Start  <b>N</b>  slave  processes (kernels). This is the number of spawned PVM3 tasks on the virtual machine. A larger
 number means larger total population, steeper convergence graph, more exhaustive search  for  solutions  and  a
 smaller  chance  of premature convergence. However, optimal number depends on the number and speed of computing
 nodes. For a virtual machine composed of reasonably fast machines start with <b>N</b> <b>=</b> <b>4</b> <b>*</b> <b>i</b> where <b>i</b> is the number of
 computing nodes. Tablix will try to arrange tasks so that all computing nodes will have equal load. (Be sure to
 set <b>speed</b> field correctly in your PVM3 hostfile). Default is 4.

</pre><h4><b>-l</b> <b>N</b></h4><pre>
 When a population in a slave process (computing node) reaches a local minimum that process will try to  execute
 an algorithm called local search. This is a way to nudge the main genetic algorithm out of a local minimum trap
 if  it  gets caught in it. However it is usually not efficient for this algorithm to run simultaneously on many
 nodes. This option sets the number of computing nodes that are allowed to simultaneously perform local  search.
 Setting <b>N</b> to 0 disables local search and -1 means no limit. Default is 1.

</pre><h4><b>-r</b></h4><pre>
 Restore  saved  populations  instead  of  starting  with  random  ones. Populations are loaded from a number of
 <u>PREFIXsave?.txt</u> files, where PREFIX is the prefix, specified with the -o option. See below.

</pre><h4><b>-o</b> <b>PREFIX</b></h4><pre>
 Specify a prefix for output files. All output files (result, saved populations and convergence graph info) will
 have PREFIX prepended.

</pre><h4><b>-d</b> <b>LEVEL</b></h4><pre>
 Set the verbosity level, where LEVEL is one of the following:

          0    (only fatal error messages are shown),

          1    (fatal and non-fatal errors),

          2    (errors and a progress indicator),

          3    (all of the above plus some informational messages) or

          4    (all of the above plus debug messages).

</pre><h4><b>-h</b></h4><pre>
 Shows a brief help message.

</pre><h4><b>-v</b></h4><pre>
 Shows compile time options, path to modules and copyright information.

</pre><h4><b>-t</b> <b>MINUTES</b></h4><pre>
 Sets a time limit for the genetic algorithm. Tablix will stop if no solution  is  found  after  set  number  of
 minutes.  The  effect is same as when Ctrl-C is pressed. Setting <b>MINUTES</b> to 0 disables this feature. Default is
 disabled. Use this option to prevent Tablix to run indefinitely if there is no possible solution.

</pre><h4><b>-p</b> <b>PARAMETERS</b></h4><pre>
 Set algorithm parameters. This is rarely used. The defaults should work fine in most  cases.  PARAMETERS  is  a
 comma separated string of <u>parameter=value</u> pairs. Following parameters are available:

          popsize
               Population  size  of one node in cluster. Bigger populations mean less generations per minute but
               also in some cases more optimized results. Default 500.

          toursize
               Tournament size. Bigger tournament sizes result  in  faster  convergence,  which  can  result  in
               finding a local instead of a global minimum. Default 3.

          mutatepart
               What  part  of  the  population will mutate each generation. 2 means one half, 3 means one third,
               etc. More mutations usually result in slower convergence but can help to  avoid  local  minimums.
               Default 4.

          randpart
               What  part  of  the  population  will be randomized each generation. Randomizations have the same
               effect as mutations. Default 6.

          maxequal
               How many equally graded timetables can exist at the same time in  a  population.  Smaller  values
               result in slower convergence but can help to avoid local minimums. Default 20.

          finish
               Tablix  will finish when the number of all mandatory errors in the best solution reaches zero and
               this best solution had the same fitness value for N sequential populations. This  option  enables
               you to set the value of N. It has no effect if there are no non-mandatory errors defined (in that
               case Tablix finishes as soon as the number of all mandatory errors reaches zero). Default 300.

          migrtime
               How  often  do  parts  of populations migrate between nodes. Smaller value means more migrations,
               which results in faster convergence. Default 40.

          migrpart
               What part of population will migrate between nodes. Default 10.

          localtresh
               How many equally graded populations to wait before starting local search  (if  enabled).  Default
               100.

          localstep
               Initial  step  for  the  local  search  algorithm.  Larger values mean more exhaustive and slower
               search. Default 4.

          pophint
               If the user has loaded an XML file that already contains a partial or a  full  solution,  then  a
               part  of  the  population  can  be  initialized  with  this solution.  This parameter defines the
               percentage of the timetables in the population that will be initialized (other timetables will be
               initialized with random values). Values must be between 0 and 100. Larger values  mean  that  the
               solution  given  in  the  XML file will have a greater possibility of being included in the final
               solution. If there is no solution in the XML file then this parameter has no effect. Default 25.

          cachesize
               This is the maximum number of timetable fitness values that will be held in  the  fitness  cache.
               Larger  values  mean  more  cache  search  overhead  but  may improve cache hit/miss ratio. It is
               probably unwise to use caches larger than 32.  In general fitness caching will reduce performance
               at the start of the genetic algorithm and improve it at the end. Set to 0 to  turn  off  caching.
               Default 16.

</pre><h4><b>-i</b> <b>PATH</b></h4><pre>
 Sets  the path to fitness modules. By default the module path is set to the location where fitness modules were
 installed by <b>make</b> <b>install</b> command.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
When you run <b>tablix2</b> , you actually start the  master  process  that  will spawn the requested number  of  slave
solution to the given problem. Data in these files can be graphically represented with the <b>tablix2_plot</b> utility.
</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
<b>tablix2_kernel</b> is executable for the slave process. It should not be started by hand, unless you know what  your
