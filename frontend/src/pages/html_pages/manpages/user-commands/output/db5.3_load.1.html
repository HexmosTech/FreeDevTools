</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       db5.3_load - Load data from standard input

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>db5.3_load</b>  [-nTV]  [-c  name=value]  [-f file] [-h home] [-P password] [-t btree | hash | queue | recno]
       file

       <b>db5.3_load</b> [-r lsn | fileid] [-h home] [-P password] file

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The db5.3_load utility reads from the standard input and loads it into the database  file.  The  database
       file is created if it does not already exist.

       The  input  to db5.3_load must be in the output format specified by the db5.0_dump utility, utilities, or
       as specified for the -T below.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-c</b>     Specify configuration options ignoring any value they may have based on the input.   The  command-
              line  format  is  <b>name=value</b>.   See  the  Supported  Keywords section below for a list of keywords
              supported by the <b>-c</b> option.

       <b>-f</b>     Read from the specified <b>input</b> file instead of from the standard input.

       <b>-h</b>     Specify a home directory for the database environment.

              If a home directory is specified, the database  environment  is  opened  using  the  DB_INIT_LOCK,
              DB_INIT_LOG,  DB_INIT_MPOOL,  DB_INIT_TXN,  and DB_USE_ENVIRON flags to DB_ENV-&gt;open.  (This means
              that db5.3_load can be used to load data into databases while they are in use by other processes.)
              If the DB_ENV-&gt;open call fails, or if no home  directory  is  specified,  the  database  is  still
              updated, but the environment is ignored; for example, no locking is done.

       <b>-n</b>     Do not overwrite existing keys in the database when loading into an already existing database.  If
              a key/data pair cannot be loaded into the database for this reason, a warning message is displayed
              on the standard error output, and the key/data pair are skipped.

       <b>-P</b>     Specify  an  environment  password.   Although Berkeley DB utilities overwrite password strings as
              soon as possible, be aware there may be a window of vulnerability on  systems  where  unprivileged
              users  can  see  command-line  arguments  or  where utilities are not able to overwrite the memory
              containing the command-line arguments.

       <b>-r</b>     Reset the database's file ID or log sequence numbers (LSNs).

              All database pages in transactional environments  contain  references  to  the  environment's  log
              records.   In  order  to  copy  a  database  into  a different database environment, database page
              references to the old environment's log records must be reset, otherwise data corruption can occur
              when the database is modified in the new environment.  The <b>-r</b> <b>lsn</b> option resets a  database's  log
              sequence numbers.

              All  databases  contain  an  ID  string  used to identify the database in the database environment
              cache.  If a database is copied, and used in the same environment as another file with the same ID
              string, corruption can occur.  The <b>-r</b> <b>fileid</b>  option resets a database's file ID to a new value.

              <b>In</b> <b>both</b> <b>cases,</b> <b>the</b> <b>physical</b> <b>file</b> <b>specified</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>file</b> <b>argument</b> <b>is</b> <b>modified</b> <b>in-place.</b>

       <b>-T</b>     The <b>-T</b> option allows non-Berkeley DB applications to easily load text files into databases.

              If the database to be created is of type Btree or Hash, or the keyword <b>keys</b> is specified  as  set,
              the  input must be paired lines of text, where the first line of the pair is the key item, and the
              second line of the pair is its corresponding data item.  If the database to be created is of  type
              Queue  or  Recno and the keyword <b>keys</b> is not set, the input must be lines of text, where each line
              is a new data item for the database.

              A simple escape mechanism, where newline and backslash (\) characters are special, is  applied  to
              the text input.  Newline characters are interpreted as record separators.  Backslash characters in
              the  text  will  be  interpreted  in  one of two ways: If the backslash character precedes another
              backslash character, the pair will be interpreted  as  a  literal  backslash.   If  the  backslash
              character  precedes  any  other  character,  the  two  characters  following the backslash will be
              interpreted as a hexadecimal specification of a single character; for example, \0a  is  a  newline
              character in the ASCII character set.

              For  this  reason, any backslash or newline characters that naturally occur in the text input must
              be escaped to avoid misinterpretation by db5.3_load.

              If the <b>-T</b> option is specified, the underlying access method type must be specified  using  the  <b>-t</b>
              option.

       <b>-t</b>     Specify  the  underlying access method.  If no <b>-t</b> option is specified, the database will be loaded
              into a database of the same type as was dumped; for example, a Hash database will be created if  a
              Hash database was dumped.

              Btree and Hash databases may be converted from one to the other.  Queue and Recno databases may be
              converted  from  one  to the other.  If the <b>-k</b> option was specified on the call to db5.3_dump then
              Queue and Recno databases may be converted to Btree or Hash, with the key being the integer record
              number.

       <b>-V</b>     Write the library version number to the standard output, and exit.

       The db5.3_load utility may be used with a Berkeley DB environment (as described for the  <b>-h</b>  option,  the
       environment  variable  <b>DB_HOME</b>,  or  because  the utility was run in a directory containing a Berkeley DB
       environment).  In order to avoid environment corruption when using a Berkeley DB environment,  db5.3_load
       should  always  be  given  the  chance  to  detach  from  the  environment and exit gracefully.  To cause
       db5.3_load to release all environment resources and exit cleanly, send it an interrupt signal (SIGINT).

       The db5.3_load utility exits 0 on success, 1 if one or more key/data  pairs  were  not  loaded  into  the
       database because the key already existed, and &gt;1 if an error occurs.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       The db5.3_load utility can be used to load text files into databases.  For example, the following command
       loads  the  standard  UNIX  <u><a href="file:/etc/passwd">/etc/passwd</a></u> file into a database, with the login name as the key item and the
       entire password entry as the data item:

       awk -F: '{print $1; print $0}' &lt; <a href="file:/etc/passwd">/etc/passwd</a> |
               sed 's/\\/\\\\/g' | db5.3_load -T -t hash passwd.db

       Note that backslash characters naturally occurring in the text are escaped  to  avoid  interpretation  as
       escape characters by db5.3_load.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>DB_HOME</b>
              If  the  <b>-h</b> option is not specified and the environment variable DB_HOME is set, it is used as the
              path of the database home, as described in DB_ENV-&gt;open.

</pre><h4><b>SUPPORTED</b> <b>KEYWORDS</b></h4><pre>
       The following keywords are supported for the <b>-c</b>  command-line  ption  to  the  db5.3_load  utility.   See
