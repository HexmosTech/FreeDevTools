</pre><h4><b>PROLOG</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       split — split a file into pieces

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       split <b>[</b>-l <u>line_count</u><b>]</b> <b>[</b>-a <u>suffix_length</u><b>]</b> <b>[</b><u>file</u> <b>[</b><u>name</u><b>]]</b>

       split -b <u>n</u><b>[</b>k|m<b>]</b> <b>[</b>-a <u>suffix_length</u><b>]</b> <b>[</b><u>file</u> <b>[</b><u>name</u><b>]]</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>split</u> utility shall read an input file and write zero or more output files.  The default size of each
       output  file shall be 1000 lines. The size of the output files can be modified by specification of the <b>-b</b>
       or <b>-l</b> options. Each output file shall be created with a  unique  suffix.  The  suffix  shall  consist  of
       exactly <u>suffix_length</u> lowercase letters from the POSIX locale. The letters of the suffix shall be used as
       if  they  were  a  base-26  digit  system,  with  the  first  suffix  to be created consisting of all <b>'a'</b>
       characters, the second with a <b>'b'</b> replacing the last <b>'a'</b>, and so on, until a name of all  <b>'z'</b>  characters
       is  created.  By  default, the names of the output files shall be <b>'x'</b>, followed by a two-character suffix
       from the character set as described above, starting with <b>"aa"</b>, <b>"ab"</b>, <b>"ac"</b>,  and  so  on,  and  continuing
       until the suffix <b>"zz"</b>, for a maximum of 676 files.

       If  the number of files required exceeds the maximum allowed by the suffix length provided, such that the
       last allowable file would be larger than the requested size, the <u>split</u> utility shall fail after  creating
       the  last  file  with a valid suffix; <u>split</u> shall not delete the files it created with valid suffixes. If
       the file limit is not exceeded, the last file created shall contain the remainder of the input file,  and
       may  be  smaller  than the requested size. If the input is an empty file, no output file shall be created
       and this shall not be considered to be an error.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>split</u> utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of  POSIX.1‐2017,  <u>Section</u>  <u>12.2</u>,  <u>Utility</u>
       <u>Syntax</u> <u>Guidelines</u>.

       The following options shall be supported:

       <b>-a</b> <u>suffix_length</u>
                 Use  <u>suffix_length</u> letters to form the suffix portion of the filenames of the split file. If <b>-a</b>
                 is not specified, the default suffix length shall be two. If the sum of the  <u>name</u>  operand  and
                 the  <u>suffix_length</u> option-argument would create a filename exceeding {NAME_MAX} bytes, an error
                 shall result; <u>split</u> shall exit with a diagnostic message and no files shall be created.

       <b>-b</b> <u>n</u>      Split a file into pieces <u>n</u> bytes in size.

       <b>-b</b> <u>n</u><b>k</b>     Split a file into pieces <u>n</u>*1024 bytes in size.

       <b>-b</b> <u>n</u><b>m</b>     Split a file into pieces <u>n</u>*1048576 bytes in size.

       <b>-l</b> <u>line_count</u>
                 Specify the number of lines in each  resulting  file  piece.  The  <u>line_count</u>  argument  is  an
                 unsigned  decimal integer. The default is 1000. If the input does not end with a &lt;newline&gt;, the
                 partial line shall be included in the last output file.

</pre><h4><b>OPERANDS</b></h4><pre>
       The following operands shall be supported:

       <u>file</u>      The pathname of the ordinary file to be split. If no input file is given or <u>file</u>  is  <b>'-'</b>,  the
                 standard input shall be used.

       <u>name</u>      The  prefix  to  be  used  for each of the files resulting from the split operation. If no <u>name</u>
                 argument is given, <b>'x'</b> shall be used as the prefix of the output files. The combined length  of
                 the  basename  of  <u>prefix</u>  and  <u>suffix_length</u>  cannot  exceed {NAME_MAX} bytes. See the OPTIONS
                 section.

</pre><h4><b>STDIN</b></h4><pre>
       See the INPUT FILES section.

</pre><h4><b>INPUT</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       Any file can be used as input.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of <u>split</u>:

       <u>LANG</u>      Provide a default value for the internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See the
                 Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <u>Section</u> <u>8.2</u>, <u>Internationalization</u>  <u>Variables</u>  for  the
                 precedence   of   internationalization  variables  used  to  determine  the  values  of  locale
                 categories.)

       <u>LC_ALL</u>    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values of all the  other  internationalization
                 variables.

       <u>LC_CTYPE</u>  Determine  the  locale  for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of text data as characters
                 (for example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments and input files).

       <u>LC_MESSAGES</u>
                 Determine the locale that should be used to  affect  the  format  and  contents  of  diagnostic
                 messages written to standard error.

       <u>NLSPATH</u>   Determine the location of message catalogs for the processing of <u>LC_MESSAGES</u>.

</pre><h4><b>ASYNCHRONOUS</b> <b>EVENTS</b></h4><pre>
       Default.

</pre><h4><b>STDOUT</b></h4><pre>
       Not used.

</pre><h4><b>STDERR</b></h4><pre>
       The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.

</pre><h4><b>OUTPUT</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       The output files contain portions of the original input file; otherwise, unchanged.

</pre><h4><b>EXTENDED</b> <b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       The following exit values shall be returned:

        0    Successful completion.

       &gt;0    An error occurred.

</pre><h4><b>CONSEQUENCES</b> <b>OF</b> <b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       Default.

       <u>The</u> <u>following</u> <u>sections</u> <u>are</u> <u>informative.</u>

</pre><h4><b>APPLICATION</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       In the following examples <b>foo</b> is a text file that contains 5000 lines.

        1. Create five files, <b>xaa</b>, <b>xab</b>, <b>xac</b>, <b>xad</b>, and <b>xae</b>:

               split foo

        2. Create  five  files,  but  the suffixed portion of the created files consists of three letters, <b>xaaa</b>,
           <b>xaab</b>, <b>xaac</b>, <b>xaad</b>, and <b>xaae</b>:

               split -a 3 foo

        3. Create three files with four-letter suffixes and a supplied prefix, <b>bar_aaaa</b>, <b>bar_aaab</b>, and <b>bar_aaac</b>:

               split -a 4 -l 2000 foo bar_

        4. Create as many files as are necessary to contain at most 20*1024 bytes, each with the default  prefix
           of <b>x</b> and a five-letter suffix:

               split -a 5 -b 20k foo

</pre><h4><b>RATIONALE</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>-b</b>  option was added to provide a mechanism for splitting files other than by lines. While most uses
       of the <b>-b</b> option are for transmitting files over networks, some believed it would have additional uses.

       The <b>-a</b> option was added to overcome the limitation of being able to create only 676 files.

       Consideration was given to deleting this utility, using the rationale that the functionality provided  by
       this  utility  is  available via the <u>csplit</u> utility (see <u>csplit</u>).  Upon reconsideration of the purpose of
       the User Portability Utilities option, it was decided to retain both this utility and the <u>csplit</u>  utility
       because  users  use  both  utilities and have historical expectations of their behavior. Furthermore, the
       splitting on byte boundaries in <u>split</u> cannot be duplicated with the historical <u>csplit</u>.

       The text ``<u>split</u> shall not delete the files it created with valid suffixes'' would normally  be  assumed,
       but  since  the  related  utility,  <u>csplit</u>,  does  delete  files under some circumstances, the historical
       behavior of <u>split</u> is made explicit to avoid misinterpretation.

       Earlier versions of this standard allowed a <b>-</b><u>line_count</u> option. This  form  is  no  longer  specified  by
       POSIX.1‐2008 but may be present in some implementations.
