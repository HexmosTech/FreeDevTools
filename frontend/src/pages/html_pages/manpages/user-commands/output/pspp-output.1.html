       <b>pspp-output</b> <b>--help</b> | <b>-h</b>
       <b>pspp-output</b> <b>--version</b> | <b>-v</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>pspp-output</b>  is a command-line utility accompanying PSPP.  It supports multiple operations on SPSS viewer
       or <b>.spv</b> files, here called SPV files.  SPSS 16 and later writes SPV files to represent  the  contents  of
       its output editor.

       SPSS 15 and earlier versions instead use <b>.spo</b> files.  <b>pspp-output</b> does not support this format.

       <b>pspp-output</b>  has  a  number  of  subcommands,  documented separately below.  <b>pspp-output</b> also has several
       undocumented command forms that developers may find useful for debugging.

   <b>The</b> <b>detect</b> command
       When invoked as <b>pspp-output</b> <b>detect</b> <u>file</u>, <b>pspp-output</b> reads enough of <u>file</u> to determine whether it  is  an
       SPV  file.  If so, it exits successfully without outputting anything.  When <u>file</u> is not an SPV file or if
       some other error occurs, <b>pspp-output</b> prints an error message and exits with a failure indication.

   <b>The</b> <b>dir</b> command
       When invoked as <b>pspp-output</b> <b>dir</b> <u>file</u>, <b>pspp-output</b> prints on stdout a table of contents for SPV file <u>file</u>.
       By default, this table lists every object in  the  file,  except  for  hidden  objects.   See  the  <b>Input</b>
       <b>Selection</b> <b>Options</b> section below for information on the options available to select a subset of objects.

       The following additional option for <b>dir</b> is intended mainly for use by PSPP developers:

       <b>--member-names</b>
              Also show the names of the Zip members associated with each object.

   <b>The</b> <b>convert</b> command
       When  invoked  as  <b>pspp-output</b>  <b>convert</b>  <u>source</u>  <u>destination</u>,  <b>pspp-output</b>  reads the SPV file <u>source</u> and
       converts it to another format, writing the output to <u>destination</u>.

       By default, <b>pspp-output</b> infers the intended  format  for  <u>destination</u>  from  its  extension.   The  known
       extensions  are  generally:  <b>csv</b>  <b>html</b>  <b>list</b> <b>odt</b> <b>pdf</b> <b>ps</b> <b>spv</b> <b>svg</b> <b>txt</b>.  Use <b>--help</b> to see an accurate list,
       since a given installation might be built without support for some formats.

       See the <b>Input</b> <b>Selection</b> <b>Options</b> section below for information on the options available to select a subset
       of objects to include in the output.  The following additional options are accepted:

       <b>-O</b> <b>format=</b><u>format</u>
              Overrides the format inferred from the output  file's  extension.   <u>format</u>  must  be  one  of  the
              extensions listed above.

       <b>-O</b> <u>option</u><b>=</b><u>value</u>
              Sets  an option for the output file format.  Refer to the PSPP manual for details of the available
              output options.

       <b>-F</b>
       <b>--force</b>
              By default, if the source is corrupt or otherwise cannot be  processed,  the  destination  is  not
              written.  These option make <b>pspp-output</b> write the output as best it can, even with errors.

       <b>--table-look=</b><u>file</u>
              Reads  a  table  style  from  <u>file</u>  and applies it to all of the output tables.  The file should a
              TableLook <b>.stt</b> or <b>.tlo</b> file.

       <b>--use-page-setup</b>
              By default, the <b>convert</b> command uses the default page setup (for example, page size  and  margins)
              for  <u>destination</u>,  or  the  one  specified with <b>-O</b> options, if any.  Specify this option to ignore
              these sources of page setup in favor of the one embedded in the SPV, if any.

   <b>The</b> <b>get-table-look</b> command
       When invoked as <b>pspp-output</b> <b>get-table-look</b> <u>source</u> <u>destination</u>, <b>pspp-output</b> reads SPV file <u>source</u>, applies
       any selection options (as described under <b>Input</b> <b>Selection</b> <b>Options</b> below), picks the first table from  the
       selected  object, extracts the TableLook from that table, and writes it to <u>destination</u> (typically with an
       <b>.stt</b> extension) in the TableLook XML format.

       Use <b>-</b> for <u>source</u> to instead write the default look to <u>destination</u>.

       The user may use the TableLook file to change the style of tables in other files, by passing  it  to  the
       <b>--table-look</b> option on the <b>convert</b> command.

   <b>The</b> <b>convert-table-look</b> command
       When  invoked  as  <b>pspp-output</b> <b>convert-table-look</b> <u>source</u> <u>destination</u>, <b>pspp-output</b> reads <b>.stt</b> or .tlo file
       <u>source</u>, and writes it back to <u>destination</u> (typically with an <b>.stt</b> extension) in the TableLook XML format.
       This is useful for converting a TableLook <b>.tlo</b> file from SPSS 15 or earlier into the newer <b>.stt</b> format.

   <b>Input</b> <b>Selection</b> <b>Options</b>
       The <b>dir</b> and <b>convert</b> commands, by default, operate on all of the objects in the source  SPV  file,  except
       for  objects  that  are  not  visible in the output viewer window.  The user may specify these options to
       select a subset of the input objects.  When multiple options are used, only objects that satisfy  all  of
       them are selected:

       <b>--select=</b>[<b>^</b>]<u>class</u>...
              Include  only  objects  of the given <u>class</u>; with leading <b>^</b>, include only objects not in the class.
              Use commas to separate multiple classes.  The supported classes are:

                     <b>charts</b> <b>headings</b> <b>logs</b> <b>models</b> <b>tables</b> <b>texts</b>  <b>trees</b>  <b>warnings</b>  <b>outlineheaders</b>  <b>pagetitle</b>  <b>notes</b>
                     <b>unknown</b> <b>other</b>

              Use <b>--select=help</b> to print this list of classes.

       --commands=[<b>^</b>]<u>command</u>...
       --subtypes=[<b>^</b>]<u>subtype</u>...
       --labels=[<b>^</b>]<u>label</u>...
              Include  only  objects  with  the specified <u>command</u>, <u>subtype</u>, or <u>label</u>.  With a leading <b>^</b>, include
              only the objects that do not match.  Multiple values may be specified  separated  by  commas.   An
              asterisk at the end of a value acts as a wildcard.

              The <b>--command</b> option matches command identifiers, case insensitively.  All of the objects produced
              by  a  single  command use the same, unique command identifier.  Command identifiers are always in
              English regardless of the language used for output.  They often differ from the  command  name  in
              PSPP syntax.  Use the <b>pspp-output</b> program's <b>dir</b> command to print command identifiers in particular
              output.

              The  <b>--subtypes</b>  option  matches particular tables within a command, case insensitively.  Subtypes
              are not necessarily unique: two commands that produce similar  output  tables  may  use  the  same
              subtype.  Subtypes are always in English and <b>dir</b> will print them.

              The  <b>--labels</b>  option  matches the labels in table output (that is, the table titles).  Labels are
              affected by the output language, variable  names  and  labels,  split  file  settings,  and  other
              factors.

       --nth-commands=<u>n</u>...
              Include  only  objects from the <u>n</u>th command that matches <b>--commands</b> (or the <u>n</u>th command overall if
              <b>--commands</b> is not specified), where <u>n</u> is 1 for the first command, 2 for the second, and so on.

       <b>--instances=</b><u>instance</u>...
              Include the specified <u>instance</u> of an object that  matches  the  other  criteria  within  a  single
              command.   The <u>instance</u> may be a number (1 for the first instance, 2 for the second, and so on) or
              <b>last</b> for the last instance.

       <b>--show-hidden</b>
              Include hidden output objects in the output.  By default, they are excluded.

       <b>--or</b>   Separates two sets of selection options.  Objects selected by either set of options  are  included
              in the output.

       The following additional input selection options are intended mainly for use by PSPP developers:

       <b>--errors</b>
              Include only objects that cause an error when read.  With the <b>convert</b> command, this is most useful
              in conjunction with the <b>--force</b> option.

       <b>--members=</b><u>member</u>...
              Include  only  the  objects  that  include  a  listed  Zip file <u>member</u>.  More than one name may be
              included, comma-separated.  The members in an SPV file may be  listed  with  the  <b>dir</b>  command  by
              adding the <b>--show-members</b> option or with the <b>zipinfo</b> program included with many operating systems.
              Error messages that <b>pspp-output</b> prints when it reads SPV files also often include member names.

       <b>--member-names</b>
              Displays  the  name of the Zip member or members associated with each object just above the object
              itself.
