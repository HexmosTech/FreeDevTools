</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       kinput2 - kanji input server for X11

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>kinput2</b> [-options...]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Kinput2</u> is an X window application to input Japanese text.  It acts as a front-end for other applications
       that want kana-kanji conversion.

       When  invoked,  after  some  initialization  (which will take about a few to 30 seconds depending on your
       machine) <u>kinput2</u> waits quietly for a Japanese text input request from another  client  (i.e.  no  windows
       appear).   When  <u>kinput2</u>  receives a request, it pops up a window and starts conversion process. It sends
       the converted text back to the client when the text is fixed.

       <u>Kinput2</u> has some big improvements over its predecessor, kinput, which was contributed to X11R4.

       <b>Over-the-spot/On-the-spot</b> <b>Input</b>
               These features enable conversion process to be done  at  cursor  position,  avoiding  unnecessary
               movement  of  eyes  between  cursor  position  and conversion window.  <u>Kinput2</u> also supports root
               window style input and off-the-spot style input.

       <b>Multiple</b> <b>Protocol</b> <b>Support</b>
               <u>Kinput2</u> supports several conversion protocols between front-end and client.  Supported  protocols
               are:
                    kinput protocol
                    kinput2 protocol
                    Matsushita jinput protocol
                    Sony xlc protocol
                    XIMP protocol
                    X Input Method Protocol (X Consortium standard)

       <b>Multiple</b> <b>Conversion</b> <b>Engine</b> <b>Support</b>
               <u>Kinput2</u>  can use 4 different conversion engines, Wnn, Canna, Sj3 and Atok.  You can choose one at
               compilation time, or at run time.

       <b>Kinput</b> <b>Compatibility</b>
               <u>Kinput2</u> is fully upward-compatible with kinput, so applications which use kinput as the front-end
               can also use <u>kinput2</u>.  In this case, the applications  cannot  take  advantage  of  over-the-spot
               conversion, though.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>kinput2</u>  accepts  all of the standard X Toolkit command line options.  The following options are accepted
       as well.

       <b>-wnn</b>    This option specifies that Wnn jserver is used as the conversion engine.

       <b>-jserver</b>
               This option specifies the hostname of the jserver to be used for conversion.

       <b>-ccdef</b>  This option specifies the input character conversion rule file.

       <b>-wnnenvrc4</b>
               This option specifies the Wnn convertion  environment  initialization  file  (wnnenvrc)  for  Wnn
               version 4.

       <b>-wnnenvrc6</b>
               This option is similar to -wnenvrc4, but for Wnn version 6.

       <b>-canna</b>  This  option  specifies  that  Canna  conversion  server  (irohaserver) is used as the conversion
               engine.

       <b>-cannaserver</b>
               This option specifies the hostname of Canna conversion server.

       <b>-cannafile</b>
               This option specifies Canna conversion customization file.

       <b>-sj3</b>    This option specifies that Sj3 conversion server (sj3serv) is used as the conversion engine.

       <b>-sj3serv</b>
               This option specifies the hostname of the primary sj3 conversion server.

       <b>-sj3serv2</b>
               This option specifies the hostname of the secondary sj3 server. The secondary server is used when
               <u>kinput2</u> cannot connect to the primary server.

       <b>-atok</b>   This option specifies that Atok server is used as the conversion engine.

       <b>-atokserver</b>
               This option specifies the hostname of the atok server to be used for conversion.

       <b>-font</b> <u>ascii-font</u>
               This option specifies the default font to be used for displaying ASCII text.

       <b>-kanjifont</b> <u>kanji-font</u>
               This option specifies the default font to be used for displaying Kanji text.

       <b>-kanafont</b> <u>kana-font</u>
               This option specifies the default font to be used for displaying Kana text.

       <b>-/+kinput</b>
               This option enables/disables use of  kinput  protocol  family  (i.e.   kinput  protocol,  kinput2
               protocol, jinput protocol and xlc protocol).

       <b>-/+ximp</b> This option enables/disables use of XIMP protocol.

       <b>-/+xim</b>  This option enables/disables use of X Input Method Protocol.

       <b>-bc</b>     Kinput  protocol,  which  is one of the communication protocols <u>kinput2</u> supports, uses X window's
               selection mechanism to notify other clients of front-end's existence.  This option forces <u>kinput2</u>
               to use selection ``JAPANESE_CONVERSION'' (which is not a standard  selection  name)  as  well  as
               ``_JAPANESE_CONVERSION''.   This  is  for  backward compatibility, since many of the applications
               that connect with kinput still use this non-standard selection.

       <b>-tbheightP</b> <u>title-bar-height</u>
               This option specifies the height (in pixels)  of the titlebar attached to popup  shells  such  as
               candidate  selection  window.   <u>Kinput2</u>  uses this value to compute the correct popup location of
               these windows.

</pre><h4><b>RESOURCES</b></h4><pre>
       There are too many resources to describe here, but you don't have to know most of them.   So  here  is  a
       brief description of resources which you might want to set.

       <b>Kinput2</b> application resource:

           <b>conversionEngine</b>
               This  resource  specifies  which  conversion  engine  to  use.   You  can specify one of ``wnn'',
               ``canna'', ``sj3'' or ``atok''.

       <b>ConversionControl</b>  widget  (which  is  a  superclass  of  SeparateConversion,  OffTheSpotConversion   and
       OverTheSpotConversion) resource:

           <b>sendbackKeyPress</b>
               If this resource is ``true'', the KeyPress events intercepted but unused by <u>kinput2</u> are sent back
               to  the  client  when there is no conversion text.  Although this feature is convenient, it might
               confuse some clients since none of corresponding KeyRelease events are  sent.   Also,  since  the
               ``send_event''  flag  of  those  events  are true, some clients do not accept events sent back by
               <u>kinput2</u>.  For example, kterm doesn't accept those events without specifying
                    KTerm*allowSendEvents: true
               in a resource file.
               The default of <b>sendbackKeyPress</b> resource is <b>true</b>.

           <b>titlebarHeight</b>
               This resource specifies the height of a title bar  which  is  attached  to  various  popup  shell
               windows, such as candicate selection.  When computing the location of these windows, <u>kinput2</u> uses
               this value to pop up them at correct position.
               The default is <b>0P.</b>

       <b>OverTheSpotConversion</b> widget resources:

           <b>shrinkWindow</b>
               If this resource is ``true'', the width of on-the-spot conversion window shrinks according to the
               length  of the text on it. Otherwise, the window never shrinks.  If the performance of Xserver on
               window resizing is poor, you may consider setting this resources to false.  The default is <b>true</b>.

           <b>modeLocation</b>
               This resource specifies the location of status widget in case of over-the-spot  type  conversion.
               Unless  client specifies the location explicitly, the location of the status widget is determined
               by this resource.  If the value of this resource is ``topleft'', the widget is placed at the  top
               left of the client window. You can also specify ``topright'', ``bottomleft'' and ``bottomright''.
               If  the  value  is  ``tracktext'', the widget is placed just under the cursor position, and moves
               according to the cursor. However, if the region available for conversion is too small, status  is
               placed  at  the bottom left of the client area.  If the value is ``none'', the status widget will
               never appear.
               The default is ``tracktext''.

           <b>modeBorderForeground</b>
               If this resource is ``true'', the color of status widget is forced to be same as  the  foreground
               color of the widget.
               The default is <b>false</b>.

           <b>useOverrideShellForMode</b>
               If this resource is ``true'', the status widget becomes an instance of OverriddeShell, instead of
               the default TransientShell.  Turn this resource on if you encounter a strange phenomenon that the
               status  widget  keeps  flickering  and you cannnot enter any text.  This is caused by (incorrect)
               focus management of your  window  manager,  and  setting  this  resource  will  stop  any  window
               management  for  the widget.  The result is that the widget will be totally ignored by the window
               manager, meaning you cannot move, resize, raise nor lower the widget.
               The default is <b>false</b>.

       <b>OnTheSpotConversion</b> widget resources:

           <b>feedbackAttributes</b>
               This resource specifies the display attributes of preedit string when on-the-spot input style  is
               used.  In  on-the-spot style, it is a client's responsibility to draw preedit string, and kinput2
               sends some hints on how it should be drawn, which is controled by this resource.   The  value  of
               this  resource  should  be  a comma-separated list of 4 elements, and each element represents the
               drawing hint of specific type of string.  They represent the hints for not-yet-converted  string,
               for  converted  string,  for  converted string which belongs to the current clause, for converted
               string belonging to the current sub-clause, in that order.  Each element consists of zero or more
               drawing attributes, which are `R' (reverse), `U' (underline), `H' (highlight), `P' (primary), `S'
               (secondary) or `T' (tertiary).  You should consult the Xlib document for  the  meaning  of  these
               attributes  (see  the  section about preedit draw callback).  The default is ``U,,R,H'', which is
               close to the drawing attributes used by other input styles.

       <b>CcWnn</b> (conversion widget using Wnn) resources:

           <b>jserver</b>
               This resource specifies the hostname of the (primary) jserver to be used for conversion.  If  not
               specified, value of environment variable ``JSERVER'' is used.

           <b>jserver2nd</b>
               This  resource  specifies  the  hostname  of  the secondary jserver, which is used if the primary
               server is down. If not specified, <u>kinput2</u> doesn't use secondary server.

           <b>wnnEnvrc4</b>
               This resource specifies the filename of the Wnn conversion environment initialization file.  This
               file  is  used when the Wnn server (jserver) is version 4. See documents of Wnn for the format of
               the file.  The default is <b>/usr/local/lib/wnn/wnnenvrc</b>.

           <b>wnnEnvrc6</b>
               This resource also specifies the filename of the Wnn conversion environment initialization  file.
               This file is used when the Wnn server (jserver) is version 6. See documents of Wnn for the format
               of the file.

           <b>wnnEnvrc</b>
               This resource is provided for backward compatibility.  Use <b>wnnEnvrc4</b> or <b>wnnEnvrc6</b> instead.

           <b>ccdef</b>
               This   resource   specifies   the   input   character  conversion  rule  file.   The  default  is
               <b>/usr/lib/X11/ccdef/ccdef.kinput2</b>.

       <b>Canna</b> (conversion widget using Canna) resources:

           <b>cannahost</b>
               This resource specifies the hostname of the canna server to be used.

           <b>cannafile</b>
               This resource specifies Canna conversion customization file.

       <b>Sj3</b> (conversion widget using SJ3) resources:

           <b>sj3serv</b>
               This resource specifies the hostname of the (primary) sj3serv to be used for conversion.  If  not
               specified, value of environment variable ``SJ3SERV'' is used.

           <b>sj3serv2</b>
               This  resource  specifies  the  hostname  of  the secondary sj3serv, which is used if the primary
               server is down.

           <b>rcfile</b>
               This resource specifies the filename of the Sj3 conversion customization  file.  The  default  is
               <b>/usr/lib/X11/sj3def/sjrc</b>.

           <b>rkfile</b>
               This   resource   specifies   the   Romaji-Kana   conversion   rule   file.    The   default   is
               <b>/usr/lib/X11/sj3def/sjrk</b>.

       <b>Atok</b> (conversion widget using Atok) resources:

           <b>server</b>
               This resource specifies the hostname of the atok server to be used for conversion.

           <b>port</b>
               This resource specifies the port number of the atok server.

           <b>conf</b>
               This resource specifies the name of atok configuration file.

           <b>style</b>
               This resource specifies the name of atok style file.

       <b>JpWcharDisplay</b> (widget for drawing Japanese text) resources:

           <b>font</b>, <b>kanjiFont</b>, <b>kanaFont</b>
               These resource specifies the font  to  be  used  for  displaying  ASCII,  Kanji  and  Kana  text,
               respectively.  Since <u>kinput2</u> changes fonts dynamically by client requests, the fonts specified by
               these resources might not be used.  If not specified, the following fonts are used.
                    -*-fixed-medium-r-normal--14-*-*-*-c-*-iso8859-1
                    -*-fixed-medium-r-normal--14-*-*-*-c-*-jisx0208.1983-0
                    -*-fixed-medium-r-normal--14-*-*-*-c-*-jisx0201.1976-0

       <b>KinputProtocol</b>  (widget  for  handling kinput protocol family - kinput, kinput2, jinput and xlc protocol)
       resources:

           <b>backwardCompatible</b>
               All of the protocols in kinput protocol family use X window's selection mechanism to notify other
               clients of  front-end's  existence.   If  this  resource  is  ``true'',  <u>kinput2</u>  uses  selection
               ``JAPANESE_CONVERSION''    (which    is   not   a   standard   selection   name)   as   well   as
               ``_JAPANESE_CONVERSION''.  This is for backward compatibility, since  many  of  the  applications
               using these protocols still use this non-standard selection.
               The default is <b>true</b>.

           <b>xlcConversionStartKey</b>
               This  resource  specifies  the key that starts the conversion.  The key is a hint for the clients
               using xlc protocol to determine when they should request conversion to <u>kinput2</u>.   The  syntax  of
               the specification is a subset of the translation table syntax:
                    <u>modifier-names</u>&lt;Key&gt;<u>keysym-name</u>
               where modifier-names is a combination of <b>Shift</b>, <b>Lock</b>, <b>Meta</b>, <b>Alt</b> and <b>Mod[1-5]</b>.
               The default is <b>Shift&lt;Key&gt;space</b>.

       <b>XimpProtocol</b> and <b>IMProtocol</b> (which handle XIMP protocol and X Input Method Protocol) resources:

           <b>conversionStartKeys</b>
               This resource specifies the keys that start the conversion.  The syntax of the specification is a
               subset of the translation table syntax:
                    <u>modifier-names</u>&lt;Key&gt;<u>keysym-name</u>
               where  modifier-names  is  a  combination of <b>Ctrl</b>, <b>Shift</b>, <b>Lock</b>, <b>Meta</b>, <b>Alt</b> and <b>Mod[1-5]</b>. A '~' can
               precede each modifier name, meaning the modifier must not  be  asserted.   For  example,  if  the
               conversion  start  key is ``Kanji'' key with shift key pressed and control key not pressed (other
               modifier keys may be pressed or not), the specification is:
                    Shift ~Ctrl&lt;Key&gt;Kanji
               Multiple keys can be specified by separating them with newlines.
               The default is as follows:
                    Shift&lt;Key&gt;space \n\
                    Ctrl&lt;Key&gt;Kanji

           <b>defaultFontList</b>
               This resource specifies the default fonts to be used if the client does not specify fonts  to  be
               used.  The default is <b>-*-fixed-medium-r-normal--14-*-*-*-c-*</b>.

</pre><h4><b>CLIENT</b> <b>SETUP</b></h4><pre>
       When  using  X  Input  Method Protocol, you have to specify the name of the input server you want to use.
       This can be done by setting ``<b>inputMethod</b>'' resource or setting <b>XMODIFIERS</b> environment  variable.   Since
       some clients don't regard inputMethod resource while other clients ignore XMODIFIERS variable, so it is a
       good idea to set both of them.

       To  use  kinput2,  you  should  add  the  following  line  to  your resource file (such as .Xresources or
       .Xdefaults):
            *inputMethod: kinput2
       and, set XMODIFIERS to ``@im=kinput2''.
            setenv XMODIFIERS "@im=kinput2"   (for csh)
            XMODIFIERS="@im=kinput2"; export XMODIFIERS   (for sh)
