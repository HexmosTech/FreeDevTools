</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       h5fromtxt - convert text input to an HDF5 file

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>h5fromtxt</b> [<u>OPTION</u>]... [<u>HDF5FILE</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       h5fromtxt  takes  a series of numbers from standard input and outputs a multi-dimensional numeric dataset
       in an HDF5 file.

       HDF5 is a free, portable binary format and supporting  library  developed  by  the  National  Center  for
       Supercomputing  Applications  at  the  University  of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign.  A single <u>h5</u> file can
       contain multiple data sets; by default, <u>h5fromtxt</u> creates a  dataset  called  "data",  but  this  can  be
       changed  via the <b>-d</b> option, or by using the syntax <u>HDF5FILE:DATASET</u>.  The <b>-a</b> option can be used to append
       new datasets to an existing HDF5 file.

       All characters besides the numbers (and associated decimal points, etcetera) in the  input  are  ignored.
       By  default,  the  data  is  assumed  to  be  a two-dimensional MxN dataset where M is the number of rows
       (delimited by newlines) and N is the number of columns.  In this case, it is an error for the  number  of
       columns to vary between rows.  If M or N is 1 then the data is written as a one-dimensional dataset.

       Alternatively,  you  can specify the dimensions of the data explicitly via the <b>-n</b> <u>size</u> option, where <u>size</u>
       is e.g. "2x2x2".  In this case, newlines are ignored and the data is taken as an array of the given  size
       stored  in row-major ("C") order (where the last index varies most quickly as you step through the data).
       e.g. a 2x2x2 array would be have the elements listed in the order: (0,0,0),  (0,0,1),  (0,1,0),  (0,1,1),
       (1,0,0), (1,0,1), (1,1,0), (1,1,1).

       A simple example is:

           h5fromtxt foo.h5 &lt;&lt;EOF
           1 2 3 4
           5 6 7 8
           EOF

       which reads in a 2x4 space-delimited array from standard input.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-h</b>     Display help on the command-line options and usage.

       <b>-V</b>     Print the version number and copyright info for h5fromtxt.

       <b>-v</b>     Verbose output.

       <b>-a</b>     If  the  HDF5 output file already exists, append the data as a new dataset rather than overwriting
              the file (the default behavior).  An existing  dataset  of  the  same  name  within  the  file  is
              overwritten, however.

       <b>-n</b> <u>size</u>
              Instead  of  trying  to  infer the dimensions of the array from the rows and columns of the input,
              treat the data as a sequence of numbers in row-major order forming an array  of  dimensions  <u>size</u>.
              <u>size</u> is of the form MxNxLx... (with M, N, L being numbers) and may be of any dimensionality.

       <b>-T</b>     Transpose the input when it is written, reversing the dimensions.

       <b>-d</b> <u>name</u>
              Write  to  dataset  <u>name</u> in the output; otherwise, the output dataset is called "data" by default.
              Alternatively, use the syntax <u>HDF5FILE:DATASET</u>.
