          ebook-convert input_file output_file [options]

       Convert an e-book from one format to another.

       input_file  is the input and output_file is the output. Both must be specified as the first two arguments
       to the command.

       The output e-book format is guessed from the file extension of output_file. output_file can  also  be  of
       the special format .EXT where EXT is the output file extension. In this case, the name of the output file
       is  derived  from  the  name  of  the  input  file. Note that the filenames must not start with a hyphen.
       Finally, if output_file has no extension, then it is treated as a  folder  and  an  "open  e-book"  (OEB)
       consisting  of  HTML  files is written to that folder. These files are the files that would normally have
       been passed to the output plugin.

       After specifying the input and output file  you  can  customize  the  conversion  by  specifying  various
       options. The available options depend on the input and output file types. To get help on them specify the
       input and output file and then use the -h option.

       For full documentation of the conversion system see <u>E-book</u> <u>conversion</u>

       Whenever you pass arguments to <b>ebook-convert</b> that have spaces in them, enclose the arguments in quotation
       marks. For example: "/some path/with spaces"

       The  options and default values for the options change depending on both the input and output formats, so
       you should always check with:

          ebook-convert myfile.input_format myfile.output_format -h

       Below are the options that are common to all conversion, followed by the options specific to every  input
       and output format.

       <b>--input-profile</b>
              Specify  the  input  profile.  The input profile gives the conversion system information on how to
              interpret various information in the input document.  For  example  resolution  dependent  lengths
              (i.e. lengths in pixels). Choices are: cybookg3, cybook_opus, default, hanlinv3, hanlinv5, illiad,
              irexdr1000, irexdr800, kindle, msreader, mobipocket, nook, sony, sony300, sony900

       <b>--list-recipes</b>
              List builtin recipe names. You can create an e-book from a builtin recipe like this: ebook-convert
              <b>"</b>Recipe Name.recipe<b>"</b> output.epub

       <b>--output-profile</b>
              Specify  the  output  profile.  The output profile tells the conversion system how to optimize the
              created document for the specified device. In some  cases,  an  output  profile  can  be  used  to
              optimize  the  output for a particular device, but this is rarely necessary. Choices are:cybookg3,
              cybook_opus,  default,  generic_eink,  generic_eink_hd,  generic_eink_large,  hanlinv3,  hanlinv5,

</pre><h4><b>LOOK</b> <b>AND</b> <b>FEEL</b></h4><pre>
       Options to control the look and feel of the output

       <b>--asciiize</b>
              Transliterate  Unicode  characters  to  an  ASCII  representation. Use with care because this will
              replace Unicode characters with ASCII. For instance it will replace <b>"</b>Pelé<b>"</b> with <b>"</b>Pele<b>"</b>. Also, note
              that in cases where there are multiple  representations  of  a  character  (characters  shared  by
              Chinese  and  Japanese  for  instance)  the  representation based on the current calibre interface
              language will be used.

       <b>--base-font-size</b>
              The base font size in pts. All font sizes in the produced book will  be  rescaled  based  on  this
              size.  By  choosing  a  larger size you can make the fonts in the output bigger and vice versa. By
              default, when the value is zero, the base font size is chosen based  on  the  output  profile  you
              chose.

       <b>--change-justification</b>
              Change  text  justification.  A  value of <b>"</b>left<b>"</b> converts all justified text in the source to left
              aligned (i.e. unjustified) text. A value of <b>"</b>justify<b>"</b> converts all unjustified text to  justified.
              A  value  of  <b>"</b>original<b>"</b> (the default) does not change justification in the source file. Note that
              only some output formats support justification.

       <b>--disable-font-rescaling</b>
              Disable all rescaling of font sizes.

       <b>--embed-all-fonts</b>
              Embed every font that is referenced in the input document but  not  already  embedded.  This  will
              search your system for the fonts, and if found, they will be embedded. Embedding will only work if
              the  format you are converting to supports embedded fonts, such as EPUB, AZW3, DOCX or PDF. Please
              ensure that you have the proper license for embedding the fonts used in this document.

       <b>--embed-font-family</b>
              Embed the specified font family into the book. This specifies the <b>"</b>base<b>"</b> font used for  the  book.
              If  the  input document specifies its own fonts, they may override this base font. You can use the
              filter style information option to remove fonts from the input document. Note that font  embedding
              only works with some output formats, principally EPUB, AZW3 and DOCX.

       <b>--expand-css</b>
              By  default,  calibre  will  use  the  shorthand  form  for various CSS properties such as margin,
              padding, border, etc. This option will cause it to use the full expanded form instead.  Note  that
              CSS  is  always expanded when generating EPUB files with the output profile set to one of the Nook
              profiles as the Nook cannot handle shorthand CSS.

       <b>--extra-css</b>
              Either the path to a CSS stylesheet or raw CSS. This CSS will be appended to the style rules  from
              the source file, so it can be used to override those rules.

       <b>--filter-css</b>
              A  comma  separated  list of CSS properties that will be removed from all CSS style rules. This is
              useful if the presence of some style information prevents it from being overridden on your device.
              For example: font-family,color,margin-left,margin-right

       <b>--font-size-mapping</b>
              Mapping from CSS font names to font sizes in pts. An example setting  is  12,12,14,16,18,20,22,24.
              These  are  the  mappings  for  the sizes xx-small to xx-large, with the final size being for huge
              fonts. The font rescaling algorithm uses these sizes to intelligently rescale fonts.  The  default
              is to use a mapping based on the output profile you chose.

       <b>--insert-blank-line</b>
              Insert  a  blank line between paragraphs. Will not work if the source file does not use paragraphs
              (&lt;p&gt; or &lt;div&gt; tags).

       <b>--insert-blank-line-size</b>
              Set the height of the inserted blank lines (in em). The height of  the  lines  between  paragraphs
              will be twice the value set here.

       <b>--keep-ligatures</b>
              Preserve  ligatures present in the input document. A ligature is a combined character of a pair of
              characters like ff, fi, fl et cetera. Most readers do not have  support  for  ligatures  in  their
              default  fonts, so they are unlikely to render correctly. By default, calibre will turn a ligature
              into the corresponding pair of normal characters. Note  that  ligatures  here  mean  only  unicode
              ligatures not ligatures created via CSS or font styles. This option will preserve them instead.

       <b>--line-height</b>
              The  line  height  in  pts.  Controls  spacing  between consecutive lines of text. Only applies to
              elements that do not define their own line height. In most cases, the minimum line  height  option
              is more useful. By default no line height manipulation is performed.

       <b>--linearize-tables</b>
              Some badly designed documents use tables to control the layout of text on the page. When converted
              these  documents  often  have  text  that  runs off the page and other artifacts. This option will
              extract the content from the tables and present it in a linear fashion.

       <b>--margin-bottom</b>
              Set the bottom margin in pts. Default is 5.0. Setting this to less than zero will cause no  margin
              to  be  set  (the  margin setting in the original document will be preserved). Note: Page oriented
              formats such as PDF and DOCX have their own margin settings that take precedence.

       <b>--margin-left</b>
              Set the left margin in pts. Default is 5.0. Setting this to less than zero will cause no margin to
              be set (the margin setting in the original  document  will  be  preserved).  Note:  Page  oriented
              formats such as PDF and DOCX have their own margin settings that take precedence.

       <b>--margin-right</b>
              Set  the  right margin in pts. Default is 5.0. Setting this to less than zero will cause no margin
              to be set (the margin setting in the original document will be  preserved).  Note:  Page  oriented
              formats such as PDF and DOCX have their own margin settings that take precedence.

       <b>--margin-top</b>
              Set  the top margin in pts. Default is 5.0. Setting this to less than zero will cause no margin to
              be set (the margin setting in the original  document  will  be  preserved).  Note:  Page  oriented
              formats such as PDF and DOCX have their own margin settings that take precedence.

       <b>--minimum-line-height</b>
              The  minimum  line  height,  as  a  percentage of the element<b>'</b>s calculated font size. calibre will
              ensure that every element has a line height of at least this setting,  irrespective  of  what  the
              input  document specifies. Set to zero to disable. Default is 120%. Use this setting in preference
              to the direct line height specification, unless you know what you are doing. For example, you  can
              achieve <b>"</b>double spaced<b>"</b> text by setting this to 240.

       <b>--remove-paragraph-spacing</b>
              Remove  spacing  between  paragraphs.  Also sets an indent on paragraphs of 1.5em. Spacing removal
              will not work if the source file does not use paragraphs (&lt;p&gt; or &lt;div&gt; tags).

       <b>--remove-paragraph-spacing-indent-size</b>
              When calibre removes blank lines between paragraphs, it automatically sets a paragraph indent,  to
              ensure  that paragraphs can be easily distinguished. This option controls the width of that indent
              (in em). If you set this value negative, then the indent specified in the input document is  used,
              that is, calibre does not change the indentation.

       <b>--smarten-punctuation</b>
              Convert  plain  quotes,  dashes  and  ellipsis  to  their typographically correct equivalents. For
              details, see <u>https://daringfireball.net/projects/smartypants</u>.

       <b>--subset-embedded-fonts</b>
              Subset all embedded fonts. Every embedded font is reduced to contain only the glyphs used in  this
              document.  This  decreases  the size of the font files. Useful if you are embedding a particularly
              large font with lots of unused glyphs.

       <b>--transform-css-rules</b>
              Path to a file containing rules to transform the CSS styles in  this  book.  The  easiest  way  to
              create  such  a  file is to use the wizard for creating rules in the calibre GUI. Access it in the
              <b>"</b>Look &amp; feel-&gt;Transform styles<b>"</b> section of the conversion dialog. Once you create the  rules,  you
              can use the <b>"</b>Export<b>"</b> button to save them to a file.

       <b>--transform-html-rules</b>
              Path to a file containing rules to transform the HTML in this book. The easiest way to create such
              a  file  is  to  use  the  wizard  for creating rules in the calibre GUI. Access it in the <b>"</b>Look &amp;
              feel-&gt;Transform HTML<b>"</b> section of the conversion dialog. Once you create the rules, you can use the
              <b>"</b>Export<b>"</b> button to save them to a file.

       <b>--unsmarten-punctuation</b>
              Convert fancy quotes, dashes and ellipsis to their plain equivalents.

</pre><h4><b>HEURISTIC</b> <b>PROCESSING</b></h4><pre>
       Modify  the  document  text  and  structure   using   common   patterns.   Disabled   by   default.   Use
       --enable-heuristics to enable.  Individual actions can be disabled with the --disable-* options.

       <b>--disable-dehyphenate</b>
              Analyze  hyphenated words throughout the document.  The document itself is used as a dictionary to
              determine whether hyphens should be retained or removed.

       <b>--disable-delete-blank-paragraphs</b>
              Remove empty paragraphs from the document when they exist between every other paragraph

       <b>--disable-fix-indents</b>
              Turn indentation created from multiple non-breaking space entities into CSS indents.

       <b>--disable-format-scene-breaks</b>
              Left aligned scene break markers are center aligned. Replace soft scene breaks that  use  multiple
              blank lines with horizontal rules.

       <b>--disable-italicize-common-cases</b>
              Look for common words and patterns that denote italics and italicize them.

       <b>--disable-markup-chapter-headings</b>
              Detect unformatted chapter headings and sub headings. Change them to h2 and h3 tags.  This setting
              will not create a TOC, but can be used in conjunction with structure detection to create one.

       <b>--disable-renumber-headings</b>
              Looks  for  occurrences  of  sequential  &lt;h1&gt;  or  &lt;h2&gt;  tags.  The tags are renumbered to prevent
              splitting in the middle of chapter headings.

       <b>--disable-unwrap-lines</b>
              Unwrap lines using punctuation and other formatting clues.

       <b>--enable-heuristics</b>
              Enable heuristic processing. This option must be set for any heuristic processing to take place.

       <b>--html-unwrap-factor</b>
              Scale used to determine the length at which a line should be unwrapped. Valid values are a decimal
              between 0 and 1. The default is 0.4, just below the median line length.  If only a  few  lines  in
              the document require unwrapping this value should be reduced

       <b>--replace-scene-breaks</b>
              Replace  scene  breaks  with  the  specified text. By default, the text from the input document is
              used.

</pre><h4><b>SEARCH</b> <b>AND</b> <b>REPLACE</b></h4><pre>
       Modify the document text and structure using user defined patterns.

       <b>--search-replace</b>
              Path to a  file  containing  search  and  replace  regular  expressions.  The  file  must  contain
              alternating  lines  of  regular  expression followed by replacement pattern (which can be an empty
              line). The regular expression must be in the Python regex  syntax  and  the  file  must  be  UTF-8
              encoded.

       <b>--sr1-replace</b>
              Replacement to replace the text found with sr1-search.

       <b>--sr1-search</b>
              Search pattern (regular expression) to be replaced with sr1-replace.

       <b>--sr2-search</b>
              Search pattern (regular expression) to be replaced with sr2-replace.

       <b>--sr3-replace</b>
              Replacement to replace the text found with sr3-search.

       <b>--sr3-search</b>
              Search pattern (regular expression) to be replaced with sr3-replace.

</pre><h4><b>STRUCTURE</b> <b>DETECTION</b></h4><pre>
       Control auto-detection of document structure.

       <b>--add-alt-text-to-img</b>
              When  an  &lt;img&gt;  tag  has  no  alt  attribute,  check  the associated image file for metadata that
              specifies alternate text, and use it to fill in the alt attribute. The alt attribute  is  used  by
              screen readers for assisting the visually challenged.

       <b>--chapter</b>
              An  XPath  expression  to detect chapter titles. The default is to consider &lt;h1&gt; or &lt;h2&gt; tags that
              contain the words <b>"</b>chapter<b>"</b>, <b>"</b>book<b>"</b>, <b>"</b>section<b>"</b>, <b>"</b>prologue<b>"</b>, <b>"</b>epilogue<b>"</b> or <b>"</b>part<b>"</b> as chapter titles
              as well as any tags that have class=<b>"</b>chapter<b>"</b>. The expression used must  evaluate  to  a  list  of
              elements.  To  disable  chapter  detection,  use the expression <b>"</b>/<b>"</b>. See the XPath Tutorial in the
              calibre User Manual for further help on using this feature.

       <b>--chapter-mark</b>
              Specify how to mark detected chapters. A value of  <b>"</b>pagebreak<b>"</b>  will  insert  page  breaks  before
              chapters.  A  value  of  <b>"</b>rule<b>"</b> will insert a line before chapters. A value of <b>"</b>none<b>"</b> will disable
              chapter marking and a value of <b>"</b>both<b>"</b> will use both page breaks and lines to mark chapters.

       <b>--disable-remove-fake-margins</b>
              Some documents specify page margins by specifying a left  and  right  margin  on  each  individual
              paragraph.  calibre  will  try  to  detect and remove these margins. Sometimes, this can cause the
              removal of margins that should not have been removed. In this case you can disable the removal.

       <b>--insert-metadata</b>
              Insert the book metadata at the start of the book. This is useful if your e-book reader  does  not
              support displaying/searching metadata directly.

       <b>--page-breaks-before</b>
              An  XPath  expression.  Page breaks are inserted before the specified elements. To disable use the
              expression: /

       <b>--prefer-metadata-cover</b>
              Use the cover detected from the source file in preference to the specified cover.

       <b>--remove-first-image</b>
              Remove the first image from the input e-book. Useful if the input document has a cover image  that
              is  not  identified  as  a cover. In this case, if you set a cover in calibre, the output document
              will end up with two cover images if you do not specify this option.

       <b>--start-reading-at</b>
              An XPath expression to detect the location in the document at which to start reading. Some  e-book
              reading  programs (most prominently the Kindle) use this location as the position at which to open
              the book. See the XPath tutorial in the calibre User Manual for further help using this feature.

</pre><h4><b>TABLE</b> <b>OF</b> <b>CONTENTS</b></h4><pre>
       Control the automatic generation of a Table of Contents. By default, if the source file has  a  Table  of

       <b>--duplicate-links-in-toc</b>
              When  creating  a  TOC  from links in the input document, allow duplicate entries, i.e. allow more
              than one entry with the same text, provided that they point to a different location.

       <b>--level1-toc</b>
              XPath expression that specifies all tags that should be added to the Table of  Contents  at  level
              one.  If  this is specified, it takes precedence over other forms of auto-detection. See the XPath
              Tutorial in the calibre User Manual for examples.

       <b>--level2-toc</b>
              XPath expression that specifies all tags that should be added to the Table of  Contents  at  level
              two. Each entry is added under the previous level one entry. See the XPath Tutorial in the calibre
              User Manual for examples.

       <b>--level3-toc</b>
              XPath  expression  that  specifies all tags that should be added to the Table of Contents at level
              three. Each entry is added under the previous level two entry.  See  the  XPath  Tutorial  in  the
              calibre User Manual for examples.

       <b>--max-toc-links</b>
              Maximum  number  of  links  to insert into the TOC. Set to 0 to disable. Default is: 50. Links are

       <b>--toc-threshold</b>
              If  fewer than this number of chapters is detected, then links are added to the Table of Contents.
              Default: 6

       <b>--use-auto-toc</b>
              Normally, if the source file already has a Table of Contents, it is  used  in  preference  to  the
              auto-generated one. With this option, the auto-generated one is always used.

              Extract the contents of the generated AZW3 file to the  specified  folder.  The  contents  of  the
              folder are first deleted, so be careful.

       <b>--mobi-toc-at-start</b>
              When adding the Table of Contents to the book, add it at the start of the book instead of the end.
              Not recommended.

       <b>--no-inline-toc</b>
              Don<b>'</b>t add Table of Contents to the book. Useful if the book has its own table of contents.

       <b>--prefer-author-sort</b>
              When present, use author sort field as author.

       <b>--pretty-print</b>
              If  specified,  the output plugin will try to create output that is as human readable as possible.
              May not have any effect for some output plugins.

       <b>--share-not-sync</b>
              Enable sharing of book content via Facebook etc.  on the Kindle. WARNING: Using this feature means
              that  the book will not auto sync its last read position  on multiple devices. Complain to Amazon.

       <b>--toc-title</b>
              Title for any generated inline table of contents.

</pre><h4><b>DOCX</b> <b>OUTPUT</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--docx-custom-page-size</b>
              Custom size of the document. Use the form width x height, for  example:  <u>123x321</u>  to  specify  the
              width and height (in pts). This overrides any specified page-size.

       <b>--docx-no-cover</b>
              Do not insert the book cover as an image at the start of the document. If you use this option, the
              book cover will be discarded.

       <b>--docx-no-toc</b>
              Do not insert the table of contents as a page at the start of the document.

       <b>--docx-page-margin-bottom</b>
              The  size  of  the  bottom  page margin, in pts. Default is 72pt. Overrides the common bottom page
              margin setting, unless set to zero.

       <b>--docx-page-margin-left</b>
              The size of the left page margin, in pts. Default is 72pt. Overrides the common left  page  margin
              setting.

       <b>--docx-page-margin-right</b>
              The size of the right page margin, in pts. Default is 72pt. Overrides the common right page margin
              setting, unless set to zero.

       <b>--docx-page-margin-top</b>

              Extract  the  contents  of  the  generated  DOCX file to the specified folder. The contents of the
              folder are first deleted, so be careful.

       <b>--preserve-cover-aspect-ratio</b>
              Preserve the aspect ratio of the cover image instead of stretching it  out  to  cover  the  entire
              page.

       <b>--pretty-print</b>
              If  specified,  the output plugin will try to create output that is as human readable as possible.
              May not have any effect for some output plugins.

</pre><h4><b>EPUB</b> <b>OUTPUT</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--dont-split-on-page-breaks</b>
              Turn off splitting at page breaks. Normally, input files are automatically  split  at  every  page
              break  into  two  files.  This  gives  an  output  e-book  that can be parsed faster and with less
              resources. However, splitting is slow and if your source file contains a very large number of page
              breaks, you should turn off splitting on page breaks.

       <b>--epub-flatten</b>
              This option is needed only if you intend to use the EPUB with FBReaderJ. It will flatten the  file
              system inside the EPUB, putting all files into the top level.

       <b>--epub-inline-toc</b>
              Insert an inline Table of Contents that will appear as part of the main book content.

       <b>--epub-max-image-size</b>
              The maximum image size (width x height). A value of none means use the screen size from the output
              profile.  A  value  of profile means no maximum size is specified. For example, a value of 100x200
              will cause all images to be resized so that their width is no  more  than  100  pixels  and  their
              height  is no more than 200 pixels. Note that this only affects the size of the actual image files
              themselves. Any given image may be rendered at a different size depending on the  styling  applied
              to it in the document.

       <b>--epub-toc-at-end</b>
              Put the inserted inline Table of Contents at the end of the book instead of the start.

       <b>--epub-version</b>
              The version of the EPUB file to generate. EPUB 2 is the most widely compatible, only use EPUB 3 if
              you know you actually need it.

       <b>--extract-to</b>
              Extract  the  contents  of  the  generated  EPUB file to the specified folder. The contents of the
              folder are first deleted, so be careful.

       <b>--flow-size</b>
              Split all HTML files larger than this size (in KB). This is necessary as most EPUB readers  cannot
              handle large file sizes. The default of 260KB is the size required for Adobe Digital Editions. Set
              to 0 to disable size based splitting.

       <b>--no-default-epub-cover</b>
              Normally,  if  the input file has no cover and you don<b>'</b>t specify one, a default cover is generated
              with the title, authors, etc. This option disables the generation of this cover.

       <b>--no-svg-cover</b>
              Do not use SVG for the book cover. Use this option if your EPUB is going to be used  on  a  device
              that  does not support SVG, like the iPhone or the JetBook Lite. Without this option, such devices
              will display the cover as a blank page.

       <b>--preserve-cover-aspect-ratio</b>
              When using an SVG cover, this option will cause the cover to scale to cover the  available  screen
              area,  but  still  preserve  its  aspect ratio (ratio of width to height). That means there may be
              white borders at the sides or top and bottom of the image, but the image will never be  distorted.
              Without this option the image may be slightly distorted, but there will be no borders.

       <b>--pretty-print</b>
              If  specified,  the output plugin will try to create output that is as human readable as possible.
              May not have any effect for some output plugins.

       <b>--toc-title</b>
              Title for any generated inline table of contents.

              folder are first deleted, so be careful.

       <b>--mobi-file-type</b>
              By  default  calibre  generates  MOBI  files  that  contain  the old MOBI 6 format. This format is

              calibre  not  to do this. Useful if your document contains lots of GIF/PNG images that become very
              large when converted to JPEG.

       <b>--mobi-toc-at-start</b>
              When adding the Table of Contents to the book, add it at the start of the book instead of the end.
              Not recommended.

              conversion.  It  is  used only when sending MOBI files to a device. If the file being sent has the
              specified tag, it will be marked as a personal document when sent to the Kindle.

       <b>--prefer-author-sort</b>
              When present, use author sort field as author.

       <b>--pretty-print</b>

       <b>--pdf-odd-even-offset</b>
              Shift the text horizontally by the specified offset (in pts). On odd numbered pages, it is shifted
              to the right and on even numbered pages to the left. Use negative numbers for the opposite effect.
              Note  that  this  setting  is  ignored  on  pages where the margins are smaller than the specified
              offset. Shifting is done by setting the PDF CropBox, not all software respects the CropBox.

       <b>--pdf-page-margin-bottom</b>
              The size of the bottom page margin, in pts. Default is 72pt.  Overrides  the  common  bottom  page

              example, <b>"</b>if (n &lt; 3) 0; else n - 3;<b>"</b>, where n is current page number.

       <b>--pdf-page-numbers</b>
              Add page numbers to the bottom of every page in the generated PDF file. If you  specify  a  footer
              template, it will take precedence over this option.

       <b>--pdf-sans-family</b>

              margins  specified in the conversion settings to be ignored. If the document does not specify page
              margins, the conversion settings will be used as a fallback.

       <b>--preserve-cover-aspect-ratio</b>
              Preserve the aspect ratio of the cover, instead of stretching it to fill the full  first  page  of
              the generated PDF.

       <b>--pretty-print</b>
              If  specified,  the output plugin will try to create output that is as human readable as possible.

              specific device.

</pre><h4><b>PML</b> <b>OUTPUT</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--full-image-depth</b>
