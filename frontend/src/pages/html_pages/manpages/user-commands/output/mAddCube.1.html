</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       mAddCube - Co-add the reprojected cubes to form the output mosaic

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       mAddCube  [-p  <u>imgdir</u>]  [-n(o-areas)]  [-a  mean|median|count] [-e(xact-size)] [-d <u>level</u>] [-s <u>statusfile</u>]
       images.tbl template.hdr out.fits

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Coadd the reprojected cubes in an input list to form an output mosaic with FITS header keywords specified
       in a header file. Creates two output files, one containing the coadded pixel values for each cube  plane,
       and  the  other  containing  coadded  pixel area values. The pixel area values can be used as a weighting
       function if the output cube values are themselves to be coadded with other projected cubes, and may  also
       be used in validating the fidelity of the output pixel values.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       -p <u>imgdir</u>
              Specifies  path  to  directory  containing  reprojected images.  If the -p switch is not included,
              mAddCube will look for the input images in the current working directory.

       -n     Co-addition ignores weighting  by  pixel  areas  and  performs  coaddition  based  only  on  pixel
              positions. Will not output an area image for the output image.

       -a <u>type</u>
              Select  type  of  averaging  to  be  done on accumulated pixel values (either mean or median).  To
              generate a map showing counts of how many times each pixel was overlapped by the input images, use
              count.

       -e     Enables exact size mode. The output image will match  the  header  template  exactly,  instead  of
              shrinking the output to fit the data.

       -d <u>level</u>
              Turns on debugging to the specified level (1-3).

       -s <u>statusfile</u>
              mAddCube output and errors will be written to <u>statusfile</u> instead of stdout.

</pre><h4><b>ARGUMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       images.tbl
              ASCII  table  (generated by mImgtbl) containing metadata for all images to be coadded.  For cubes,
              mImgtbl needs to be run with the -C option which picks up  the  third  dimension  parameters  (and
              fourth if they exist).

       template.hdr
              FITS header template to be used in generation of output FITS cube.

       out.fits
              Name of output FITS image.

</pre><h4><b>RESULT</b></h4><pre>
       If  successful,  mAddCube  creates a FITS datacube file <b>out.fits</b> that is a coadd of all the FITS cubes in
       the table <b>images.tbl</b>, according to the header template given.   A  corresponding  <b>out_area.fits</b>  is  also
       created.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       The following example runs <b>mAddCube</b> on 4 FITS images, generating the output  file  <b>mosaic.fits</b>.   Related
       files are images.tbl and template.hdr.

       $ mAddCube -p proj images.tbl template.hdr output/mosaic.fits
              [struct stat="OK", time=1]

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       The drizzle algorithm has been implemented but has not been tested in this release.

       If a header template contains carriage returns (i.e., created/modified on a Windows machine), the cfitsio
       library  will  be  unable  to read it properly, resulting in the error: [struct stat="ERROR", status=207,
       msg="illegal character in keyword"]

       It is best for the background correction  algorithms  if  the  area  described  in  the  header  template
       completely encloses all of the input images in their entirety. If parts of input images are "chopped off"
       by  the  header  template,  the  background correction will be affected. We recommend you use an expanded
       header for the reprojection and background modeling steps, returning to  the  originally  desired  header
       size  for  the  final  coaddition.  The  default background matching assumes that there are no non-linear
       background variations in the individual images (and therefore in the overlap differences).  If  there  is
       any  uncertainty  in  this  regard, it is safer to turn on the "level only" background matching (the "-l"
       flag in mBgModel.
