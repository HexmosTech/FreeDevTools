       dcintro - ACR/NEMA DICOM PS3 ... Introduction and options

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>

       <b>dcxxxx</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  options  described  are  common to all tools and conversions as necessary when either DICOM input or
       output or both are supported.

       Though input may be redirected from standard input or standard output, in general the ability to seek  is
       required on input, and if this is not supported, as in input from a pipe, the operation will fail.

       Under  normal  circumstances,  utilities  that  read DICOM or older ACR/NEMA input files, whether a meta-
       information header is present or not, should be able to automatically determine the appropriate  Transfer
       Syntax.

       For  utilities  that write DICOM output,  the default behaviour is to write a meta-information header and
       preamble, and hence produce files that are compliant with  DICOM  PS  3.10.  No  other  files  can  claim
       conformance  to the standard, and even then compliance with a specific Media Application Profile is still
       required. It may be useful to suppress the meta-header if it is required to construct datasets  contained
       temporarily within files prior to exchange using the DICOM network protocol.

       For  utilities  that write DICOM output, various attributes may be manually deleted or replaced after the
       initial DICOM dataset is read or generated.  Various options exist to replace such attributes  before  or
       after  the  image pixel data encoding is established, hence either incorrect attributes can be corrected,
       or the encoding can be changed.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Input options are:

       <b>-if|-input-file|&lt;</b> <u>name</u>

       <b>-input-nometa</b>
              Input does not contain a meta-information header and preamble.  Needed  only  when  the  automatic
              determination  of  input Transfer Syntax fails.  When specified, suppresses check for the presence
              of a meta-information header and will use either the transfer syntax specified by -input-ts " uid"
              or the byte order and implicit or explicit vr, otherwise these are automatically  determined  from
              the dataset (guessed).

       <b>-input-nolengthtoend</b>
              Ignore  the  length to end value, if present. Normally the reading stops after length to end bytes
              have been read and any trailing padding present is ignored.

       <b>-ignoreoutofordertags</b>
              Ignore tags that are incorrectly out of order and keep reading the dataset.  Useful for  debugging
              invalid  data  sets,  but may cause parser to get lost if problem is not really out of order tags.
              Also enables parsing past various other encoding issues that are not related to tag order.

       <b>-usvrlutdata</b>
              If the VR for the LUT Data attribute is not explicitly specified,  then  a  US  (rather  than  the
              default  OW) VR will be used; can be used to convert one form to another by converting to implicit
              first and then using this option .

       <b>-input-ts</b> <u>uid</u>
              Use the input Transfer Syntax specified by the UID.  Needed only when the automatic  determination
              of  input  Transfer Syntax fails.  Will be used to set the transfer syntax for the meta-header (if
              present) rather than the dataset unless -input-nometa is also specified.

       <b>-input-default</b>
              Use the default Implicit VR Little Endian  Transfer  Syntax  for  input.   Needed  only  when  the
              automatic determination of input Transfer Syntax fails.

       <b>-input-byteorder|-input-endian</b>  <b>big|little</b>
              Select  an uncompressed input Transfer Syntax that uses the specified byteorder. Requires that the
              input Value Representation also be specified.  Needed only when  the  automatic  determination  of
              input Transfer Syntax fails.

       <b>-input-vr</b>  <b>implicit|explicit</b>
              Select  an  uncompressed  input  Transfer  Syntax  that  uses  the specified Value Representation.
              Requires that the input byteorder also be specified.  Needed only when the automatic determination
              of input Transfer Syntax fails.

       Output options are:

       <b>-of|-output-file|&gt;</b> <u>name</u>

       <b>-n|-nometa|-output-nometa</b>
              Don't write an output meta-information header and preamble.

       <b>-justmeta|-output-justmeta</b>
              Write only a meta-information header and preamble, and not the data set itself.

       <b>-implicitmeta|-output-implicitmeta</b>
              Use the obsolete pre-standard draft Implicit VR  Little  Endian  Transfer  Syntax  for  the  meta-
              information header.

       <b>-ts|-output-ts|-output-transfersyntax</b> <u>uid</u>
              Use the output Transfer Syntax specified by the UID.

       <b>-output-default</b>
              Use  the  default  Implicit VR Little Endian Transfer Syntax for output.  This is the default mode
              anyway, and the option is redundant.

       <b>-output-byteorder|-output-endian</b>  <b>big|little</b>
              Select an uncompressed output Transfer Syntax that uses the specified byteorder. Requires that the
              output Value Representation also be specified.

       <b>-output-vr</b>  <b>implicit|explicit</b>
              Select an uncompressed output Transfer  Syntax  that  uses  the  specified  Value  Representation.
              Requires that the output byteorder also be specified.

       <b>-s|-stamp</b> <u>uiddatetimestamp</u>
              When  UIDs  are  automatically  generated,  they  incorporate  the current date and time to ensure
              uniqueness. If two invocations of a utility are to generate the same UIDs,  for  example  for  two
              images  of  a  series  to  share a common SeriesInstanceUID, then the current date and time may be
              replaced in the generated uid by the explicitly specified value. This option is  also  useful  for
              regression  testing to ensure that the output matches that of a previous invocation, without being
              affected by the current date and time. A typical value to use for a stamp shared between  multiple
              images in the same study would be "`date '+%Y%m%d%H%M%S'`.$$".

       <b>-addlengths</b>
              Add  group  length attributes to every group.  Normally the group length is only generated for the
              meta-information header group, where it is mandatory. These have been retired by DICOM 3.0 but are
              often checked by applications, and are sometimes required by  older  ACR/NEMA  applications.  Note
              that LengthToEnd is not added by this option unless -addlengthtoend is also specified.

       <b>-addlengthtoend</b>
              Add  the  LengthToEnd  attribute.  This  has  been  retired  by DICOM 3.0 but are often checked by
              applications, and are sometimes required by older ACR/NEMA applications.

       <b>-tiff|-tif</b>
              Add a TIFF header in the DICOM Meta-information preamble,  which  points  to  a  TIFF  Image  File
              Directory  (IFD)  at  the  end  of  the  dataset in the DataSetTrailingPadding Attribute after the
              PixelData attribute. This allows the DICOM file to be a 'dual-personality' file, sharing the pixel
              data with two formats, and allowing both TIFF and DICOM readers to handle the image.

       <b>-removeprivate</b>
              Remove any private attributes present, ie. all those in odd groups.

       <b>-removeinstanceuid</b>
              Remove any existing SOPInstanceUID. This is generally a prelude to automatically generating a  new
              one, which will happen unless -noadddicom is also specified.

       <b>-noadddicom</b>
              Suppress  the  automatic  insertion of SOP Instance UIDs and SOP Class UIDs where they are missing
              and can be meaningfully guessed at given the presence  and  values  of  other  attributes.  For  a
              composite  image  object instance, the StudyID, SeriesNumber and ImageNumber will be used together
              with  the  date  and  time  or  explicit  stamp  (see  -stamp)   to   generate   StudyInstanceUID,
              SeriesInstanceUID  and  SOPInstanceUID.   The  SOPClassUID will be guessed at from Modality if not
              ambiguous.  There is no guarantee that a complete IOD will be generated in this manner, it is just
              a best effort when required attributes are missing, and has no effect  on  an  exisiting  complete
              IOD.

       <b>-nodisclaimer</b>
              Suppress  insertion  of  the  'for  investigational  use  only'  disclaimer  in  the ImageComments
              attribute.

       <b>-disambiguateseriesbydescription</b>
              When inserting Series Instance UIDs, use not just the Series Number but also the characters in the
              Series Description to (try to) build a value that disambiguates series with the  same  number  but
              different descriptions.

       <b>-d|-delete</b> <u>deletekeyword</u>
              Delete  the named attribute after the data set has been cleaned of old metaheader attributes, UIDs
              (if requested) and private attributes (if requested), but before automatic  DICOM  attributes  (if
              not suppressed), disclaimers (if not suppressed) and new metaheader (if not suppressed) attributes
              have been added.

       <b>-r|-replace|-rb|-replace-before</b> <u>replacekeyword</u> <u>values</u>
              Replace  or  add  the  named  attribute  after  the  data  set  has been cleaned of old metaheader
              attributes, UIDs (if requested) and private attributes (if requested), but BEFORE automatic  DICOM
              attributes  (if not suppressed), disclaimers (if not suppressed) and new metaheader attributes (if
              not suppressed) have been added, and the output encoding transformations  have  been  established.
              Note  that  attributes  related  to  image pixel encoding changed at this point WILL affect actual
              image pixel data transformations, and hence may be specified here to cause  such  transformations,
              based  on  BitsAllocated,  BitsStored  and  HighBit.  Note that in order to replace a value with a
              string that starts with a leading hyphen ('-') that might  otherwise  be  interpreted  as  another
              option, enter the value in single quotes and preceded the hyphen with a space (which will later be
              elided), eg. "-r Rescale Intercept ' -1024'".

       <b>-ra|-replace-after</b> <u>replacekeyword</u> <u>values</u>
              Replace  or  add  the  named  attribute  after  automatic  DICOM  attributes  (if not suppressed),
              disclaimers (if not suppressed) and new metaheader attributes (if not suppressed) have been added,
              but before group lengths (if requested) have been added. Note that  attributes  related  to  image
              pixel   encoding  changed  at  this  point  will  have  no  effect  on  actual  image  pixel  data
              transformations, and hence may be specified here to correct such attributes.

       <b>-version</b>
              Print a version string to stderr, and exit if there are no other arguments.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Though redirection from a file on standard input should work, certain libraries give  incorrect  results,
       rather  than actually failing with a seek error ... this has been observed with libg++ 2.7.0 and is a bit
       worrying. The use of standard  input  redirection  has  not  been  removed  however,  for  use  in  those
       environments in which it does work.

       One  cannot  specify  a  zero length string value for replacements on the command line. One can specify a
       string with a single space byte, which then gets removed as trailing zeroes are removed, so one can  make
       zero length type 2 attributes.
