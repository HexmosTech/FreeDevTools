</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       pt-align - Align output from other tools to columns.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       Usage: pt-align [FILES]

       pt-align aligns output from other tools to columns.  If no FILES are specified, STDIN is read.

       If a tool prints the following output,

          DATABASE TABLE   ROWS
          foo      bar      100
          long_db_name table  1
          another  long_name 500

       then pt-align reprints the output as,

          DATABASE     TABLE     ROWS
          foo          bar        100
          long_db_name table        1
          another      long_name  500

</pre><h4><b>RISKS</b></h4><pre>
       Percona Toolkit is mature, proven in the real world, and well tested, but all database tools can pose a
       risk to the system and the database server.  Before using this tool, please:

       •   Read the tool's documentation

       •   Review the tool's known "BUGS"

       •   Test the tool on a non-production server

       •   Backup your production server and verify the backups

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       pt-align reads lines and splits them into words.  It counts how many words each line has, and if there is
       one  number that predominates, it assumes this is the number of words in each line.  Then it discards all
       lines that don't have that many words, and looks at the 2nd line that does.  It assumes this is the first
       non-header line.  Based on whether each word looks numeric  or  not,  it  decides  on  column  alignment.
       Finally, it goes through and decides how wide each column should be, and then prints them out.

       This is useful for things like aligning the output of vmstat or iostat so it is easier to read.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>

       details.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>

</pre><h4><b>SYSTEM</b> <b>REQUIREMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       You need Perl, and some core packages that ought to be installed in any reasonably new version of Perl.
