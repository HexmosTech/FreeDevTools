</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>i.gensigset</u> is a non-interactive method for generating input into <u>i.smap.</u>  It is used as the  first  pass
       in  the  a  two-pass classification process.  It reads a raster map layer, called the training map, which
       has some of the pixels or regions already classified.  <u>i.gensigset</u> will then extract spectral  signatures
       from  an  image  based  on the classification of the pixels in the training map and make these signatures
       available to <u>i.smap.</u>

       The user would then execute the GRASS program <u>i.smap</u> to create the final classified map.

       This module generates signature files of type "sigset".  Use  module  i.signatures  to  manage  generated
       signature files.

       For  all  raster  maps used to generate signature file it is recommended to have semantic label set.  Use
       <u>r.support</u> to set semantic labels of each member of the imagery group.  Signatures generated for one scene
       are suitable for classification of other scenes as long as they consist of same  raster  bands  (semantic
       labels  match).  If  semantic  labels  are not set, it will be possible to use obtained signature file to
       classify only the same imagery group used for generating signatures.

       An usage example can be found in i.smap documentation.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Parameters</b>
       <b>trainingmap=</b><u>name</u>
           ground truth training map

       This raster layer, supplied as input by the user, has some of its pixels already classified, and the rest
       (probably most) of the pixels unclassified.  Classified means that the pixel has  a  non-zero  value  and
       unclassified means that the pixel has a zero value.

       This  map  must  be  prepared by the user in advance by using a combination of <u>wxGUI</u> <u>vector</u> <u>digitizer</u> and
       <u>v.to.rast</u>,  or  some  other  import/development  process  (e.g.,  <u>v.transects)</u>  to   define   the   areas
       representative of the classes in the image.

       At present, there is no fully-interactive tool specifically designed for producing this layer.

       <b>group=</b><u>name</u>
           imagery group

       This  is  the name of the group that contains the band files which comprise the image to be analyzed. The
       <u>i.group</u> command is used to construct groups of raster layers which comprise an image.

       <b>subgroup=</b><u>name</u>
           subgroup containing image files

       This names the subgroup within the group that selects a subset of the bands to be analyzed.  The  <u>i.group</u>
       command is also used to prepare this subgroup.  The subgroup mechanism allows the user to select a subset
       of all the band files that form an image.

       <b>signaturefile=</b><u>name</u>
           resultant signature file

       This is the resultant signature file (containing the means and covariance matrices) for each class in the
       training map that is associated with the band files in the subgroup selected.

       <b>maxsig=</b><u>value</u>
           maximum number of sub-signatures in any class
           default: 5

       The  spectral  signatures  which  are  produced by this program are "mixed" signatures (see NOTES).  Each
       signature contains one or more subsignatures (represeting subclasses).  The  algorithm  in  this  program
       starts  with  a  maximum  number  of subclasses and reduces this number to a minimal number of subclasses
       which are spectrally distinct.  The user has the option to set this starting value with this option.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       The algorithm in <u>i.gensigset</u> determines the parameters of a spectral class  model  known  as  a  Gaussian
       mixture  distribution.   The  parameters  are estimated using multispectral image data and a training map
       which labels the class of a subset of the image pixels.  The mixture class parameters  are  stored  as  a
       class signature which can be used for subsequent segmentation (i.e., classification) of the multispectral
       image.

       The  Gaussian  mixture  class  is  a  useful  model because it can be used to describe the behavior of an
       information class which contains pixels  with  a  variety  of  distinct  spectral  characteristics.   For
       example,  forest,  grasslands  or urban areas are examples of information classes that a user may wish to
       separate in an image.  However, each of these information classes may contain subclasses  each  with  its
       own  distinctive  spectral characteristic.  For example, a forest may contain a variety of different tree
       species each with its own spectral behavior.

       The objective of mixture classes is to improve segmentation  performance  by  modeling  each  information
       class  as a probabilistic mixture with a variety of subclasses.  The mixture class model also removes the
       need to perform an initial unsupervised segmentation for the purposes of  identifying  these  subclasses.
       However,  if  misclassified  samples  are  used  in  the training process, these erroneous samples may be
       grouped as a separate undesired subclass.  Therefore, care should be taken to provided accurate  training
       data.

       This  clustering  algorithm  estimates  both  the  number  of  distinct subclasses in each class, and the
       spectral mean and covariance for each subclass.  The number of subclasses is estimated  using  Rissanen’s
       minimum  description  length  (MDL)  criteria  [1].   This  criteria  attempts to determine the number of
       subclasses which "best" describe the data.  The approximate maximum likelihood estimates of the mean  and
       covariance of the subclasses are computed using the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm [2,3].

</pre><h4><b>WARNINGS</b></h4><pre>
       If warnings like this occur, reducing the remaining classes to 0:
       ...
       WARNING: Removed a singular subsignature number 1 (4 remain)
       WARNING: Removed a singular subsignature number 1 (3 remain)
       WARNING: Removed a singular subsignature number 1 (2 remain)
       WARNING: Removed a singular subsignature number 1 (1 remain)
       WARNING: Unreliable clustering. Try a smaller initial number of clusters
       WARNING: Removed a singular subsignature number 1 (-1 remain)
       WARNING: Unreliable clustering. Try a smaller initial number of clusters
       Number of subclasses is 0
       then the user should check for:

           •   the  range  of  the  input  data  should  be between 0 and 100 or 255 but not between 0.0 and 1.0
               (<u>r.info</u> and <u>r.univar</u> show the range)

           •   the training areas need to contain a sufficient amount of pixels
