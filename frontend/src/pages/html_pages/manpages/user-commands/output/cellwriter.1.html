</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       <b>cellwriter</b> - grid-entry handwriting recognition input panel

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>cellwriter</b> [options]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       CellWriter is a grid-entry natural handwriting recognition input panel.  As you write characters into the
       cells,  your writing is instantly recognized at the character level. When you press 'Enter' on the panel,
       the input you entered is sent to the currently focused application as if typed on the keyboard.

       See the program website for details: <a href="http://risujin.org/cellwriter">http://risujin.org/cellwriter</a>

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The following options are provided by CellWriter using the standard GNU command line syntax:

       <b>--help</b> Prints the command line options.

       <b>--log-level</b>=4
              Determines the detail level of log output:
              0 = Silent
              3 = Errors only
              4 = Warnings (default)
              5 = Informational messages
              7 = Debugging information
              8 = Function traces

       <b>--log-file</b>=PATH
              Redirects log output from standard error to a file.

       <b>--xid</b>  This option starts CellWriter in embedded mode. You can set gnome-screensaver to  call  CellWriter
              with this option to embed CellWriter into the unlock password prompt.

       <b>--profile</b>=filename
              Specifies the full path of a profile file to load instead of the user's.

       <b>--read-only</b>
              Prevents changes from being saved to the profile.

       <b>--keyboard-only</b>
              Places  CellWriter in keyboard-only mode which prevents profile loading, suppresses the no-samples
              prompt, and only displays the full on-screen keyboard.

       <b>--show-window</b>
       <b>--hide-window</b>
              Show or hide the main window  regardless  of  the  saved  profile  setting.   If  an  instance  of
              CellWriter is already running, you can start a second instance of CellWriter with <b>--hide-window</b> to
              hide its window.

       <b>--window-x</b>=X
       <b>--window-y</b>=Y
              Specify the position of the main window in pixels, overriding the profile setting.

       <b>--dock-window</b>=N
              Controls window docking:
              0 = Not docked
              1 = Docked to top
              2 = Docked to bottom

       <b>--window-struts</b>
              Sets  the  extended  window  manager struts hint when docking. This causes all other windows to be
              moved out of the docking area. This works with some window managers (XFWM4) but can  cause  severe
              problems with others (Metacity).

       <b>--disable-overwrite</b>
              CellWriter  needs  to  modify  the  X  server  keymap  in order to generate keystrokes for Unicode
              characters that are not already in the user's keymap. This can potentially cause stability issues.
              Use this option to prevent CellWriter from modifying the keymap.
