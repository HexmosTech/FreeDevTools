</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       ipmctl-inject-error - Injects an error or clears a previously injected error

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           ipmctl set [OPTIONS] -dimm [TARGETS] [PROPERTIES]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Injects an error or clears a previously injected error on one or more PMem module for testing purposes.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       -h, -help
           Displays help for the command.

       -ddrt
           Used to specify DDRT as the desired transport protocol for the current invocation of ipmctl.

       -smbus
           Used to specify SMBUS as the desired transport protocol for the current invocation of ipmctl.

           <b>Note</b>

           The -ddrt and -smbus options are mutually exclusive and may not be used together.

       -o (text|nvmxml), -output (text|nvmxml)
           Changes the output format. One of: "text" (default) or "nvmxml".

</pre><h4><b>TARGETS</b></h4><pre>
       -dimm [DimmIDs]
           Injects or clears an error on specific PMem modules by supplying one or more comma separated PMem
           module identifiers. The default is to inject the error on all manageable PMem modules.

</pre><h4><b>PROPERTIES</b></h4><pre>
       This command only supports setting or clearing one type of error at a time.

       Clear

           •   "1": Clears a previously injected error. This property must be combined with one of the other
               properties indicating the previously injected error to clear.

       Temperature
           Injects an artificial media temperature in degrees Celsius into the PMem module. The firmware that is
           monitoring the temperature of the PMem module will then be alerted and take necessary precautions to
           preserve the PMem module. The value is injected immediately and will override the firmware from
           reading the actual media temperature of the device and use this value instead which may cause adverse
           reactions by the firmware and result in an alert or log.

           <b>Note</b>

           The injected temperature value will remain until the next reboot or until it is cleared. The media
           temperature is an artificial temperature and will not cause harm to the part. Although firmware
           actions due to improper temperature injections may cause adverse effects on the PMem module.
           If the Critical Shutdown Temperature, or higher, is passed in, this may cause the PMem module
           firmware to perform a shutdown in order to preserve the part and data.
           The temperature value will be ignored on clear.

       Poison
           The physical address to poison.
           Poison is not possible for any address in the PM region if the PM region is locked. Injected poison
           errors are only triggered on a subsequent read of the poisoned address in which case an error log
           will be generated by the firmware, but no alerts will be sent.
           This command can be used to clear non-injected poison errors. The data will be zeroed after clearing.
           There is no requirement to enable error injection prior to request to clear poison errors.
           The caller is responsible for keeping a list of injected poison errors, in order to properly clear
           the injected errors afterwards. Simply disabling injection does not clear injected poison errors.
           Injected poison errors are persistent across power cycles and system resets.

           <b>Note</b>

           System firmware (BIOS) will not read from any Intel® Optane™ PMem device addresses that are known to
           be poisoned. For any poisoned address, the first read may result in a hang/fault, but system firmware
           (BIOS) will mark this address as poisoned so subsequent attempts to read poisoned addresses will be
           rejected with an error. The result of such an error may prevent booting from a namespace that has
           poisoned data.

           <b>Note</b>

           The address must be 256 byte aligned (e.g., 0x10000000, 0x10000100, 0x10000200...).

       PoisonType
           The type of memory to poison. One of:

           •   "PatrolScrub": Injects a poison error at the specified address simulating an error found during a
               patrol scrub operation indifferent to how the memory is currently allocated. This is the default.

           •   "MemoryMode": Injects a poison error at the specified address currently allocated in Memory Mode.

           •   "AppDirect": Injects a poison error at the specified address currently allocated as App Direct.

           <b>Note</b>

           If the address to poison is not currently allocated as the specified memory type, an error is
           returned.

       PackageSparing

           •   "1": Triggers an artificial package sparing. If package sparing is enabled and the PMem module
               still has spares remaining, this will cause the firmware to report that there are no spares
               remaining.

           <b>Note</b>

           Injecting package sparing is not supported on Intel® Optane™ Persistent Memory 300 series modules.

       PercentageRemaining
           Injects an artificial percentage remaining value into the PMem module. This will cause the firmware
           to take appropriate action based on the value and if necessary generate an error log, an alert, and
           update the health status.

       FatalMediaError

           •   "1": Injects a fake media fatal error which will cause the firmware to generate an error log and
               an alert.

           <b>Note</b>

           When media fatal error is injected, BSR Media Disabled status bit will be set indicating media error,
           until the fatal error is cleared using disable trigger input parameter to clear this injected fatal
           error.

           <b>Note</b>

           Injecting a Fatal Media error is unsupported on Windows*. Contact Microsoft* for assistance in
           performing this action.

           <b>Note</b>

           When a fatal media error is cleared, A power cycle is needed for this operation to take effect.

       DirtyShutdown

           •   "1": Injects an ADR failure resulting in dirty shutdown upon reboot.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Sets the media temperature on all manageable PMem modules to 50 degrees Celsius.

           ipmctl set -dimm Temperature=50

       Clears the injected media temperature on all manageable PMem modules.

           ipmctl set -dimm Clear=1 Temperature=1

       Poison address 0x10000200 on PMem module 1234.

           ipmctl set -dimm 1234 Poison=0x10000200

       Clears the injected poison of address 0x10000200 on PMem module 1234.

           ipmctl set -dimm 1234 Poison=0x10000200 Clear=1

       Triggers an artificial package sparing on all manageable PMem modules.

           ipmctl set -dimm PackageSparing=1

       Sets the life remaining percentage on all manageable PMem modules to 10%.

           ipmctl set -dimm PercentageRemaining=10

       Clears the injected remaining life percentage on all manageable PMem modules. The value of
       PercentageRemaining is irrelevant.

           ipmctl set -dimm PercentageRemaining=10 Clear=1

       Triggers an artificial ADR failure on all manageable PMem modules resulting in a dirty shutdown on each
       PMem module on the next reboot.

           ipmctl set -dimm DirtyShutdown=1

</pre><h4><b>LIMITATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       This command is available only when error injection is enabled on the PMem modules in the BIOS. To
       successfully execute this command, the specified PMem modules must be manageable by the host software.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>DATA</b></h4><pre>
       For each PMem module, the CLI will indicate the status of the operation. If a failure occurs when
       injecting an error on multiple PMem modules, the process will continue with the remaining PMem modules.
