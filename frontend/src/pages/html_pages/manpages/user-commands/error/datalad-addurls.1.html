</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Format</b> <b>specification</b>
       Several arguments take format strings.  These are similar to normal Python format strings where the names
       from `URL-FILE` (column names for a comma- or tab-separated file or properties for JSON) are available as
       placeholders. If `URL-FILE` is a CSV or TSV file, a positional index can also be used  (i.e.,  "{0}"  for
       the first column). Note that a placeholder cannot contain a ':' or '!'.

       In addition, the `FILENAME-FORMAT` arguments has a few special placeholders.

       - _repindex

         The constructed file names must be unique across all fields rows.  To
         avoid collisions, the special placeholder "_repindex" can be added to
         the formatter.  Its value will start at 0 and increment every time a
         file name repeats.

       - _url_hostname, _urlN, _url_basename*

         Various parts of the formatted URL are available.  Take
         "<a href="http://datalad.org/asciicast/seamless_nested_repos.sh">http://datalad.org/asciicast/seamless_nested_repos.sh</a>" as an example.

         "datalad.org" is stored as "_url_hostname".  Components of the URL's
         path can be referenced as "_urlN".  "_url0" and "_url1" would map to
         "asciicast" and "seamless_nested_repos.sh", respectively.  The final
         part of the path is also available as "_url_basename".

         This name is broken down further.  "_url_basename_root" and
         "_url_basename_ext" provide access to the root name and extension.
         These values are similar to the result of os.path.splitext, but, in the
         case of multiple periods, the extension is identified using the same
         length heuristic that git-annex uses.  As a result, the extension of
         "file.tar.gz" would be ".tar.gz", not ".gz".  In addition, the fields
         "_url_basename_root_py" and "_url_basename_ext_py" provide access to
         the result of os.path.splitext.

       - _url_filename*

         These are similar to _url_basename* fields, but they are obtained with
         a server request.  This is useful if the file name is set in the
         Content-Disposition header.

   <b>Examples</b>
       Consider a file "avatars.csv" that contains::

         who,ext,link
         neurodebian,png,https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/260793
         datalad,png,https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/8927200

       To download each link into a file name composed of the 'who' and 'ext' fields, we could run::

       $ datalad addurls -d avatar_ds avatars.csv '{link}' '{who}.{ext}'

       The `-d avatar_ds` is used to create a new dataset in "$PWD/avatar_ds".

       If  we  were  already in a dataset and wanted to create a new subdataset in an "avatars" subdirectory, we
       could use "//" in the `FILENAME-FORMAT` argument::

       $ datalad addurls avatars.csv '{link}' 'avatars//{who}.{ext}'

       If the information is represented as JSON lines instead of comma separated values or a  JSON  array,  you
       can use a utility like jq to transform the JSON lines into an array that addurls accepts::

       $ ... | jq --slurp . | datalad addurls - '{link}' '{who}.{ext}'

       NOTE

        For users familiar with 'git annex addurl': A large part of this
        plugin's functionality can be viewed as transforming data from
        `URL-FILE` into a "url filename" format that fed to 'git annex addurl
        --batch --with-files'.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       URL-FILE
              A file that contains URLs or information that can be used to construct URLs. Depending on the val‐
              ue of --input-type, this should be a comma- or tab-separated file (with a header as the first row)
              or  a  JSON  file (structured as a list of objects with string values). If '-', read from standard
              input, taking the content as JSON when --input-type is at its default value of 'ext'.

       URL-FORMAT
              A format string that specifies the URL for each entry.  See  the  'Format  Specification'  section
              above.

       FILENAME-FORMAT
              Like  `URL-FORMAT`,  but  this format string specifies the file to which the URL's content will be
              downloaded. The name should be a relative path and will be taken  as  relative  to  the  top-level
              dataset,  regardless  of whether it is specified via --dataset or inferred. The file name may con‐
              tain directories. The separator "//" can be used to indicate that the left-side  directory  should
              be created as a new subdataset. See the 'Format Specification' section above.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>, <b>--help-np</b>
              show  this  help message. --help-np forcefully disables the use of a pager for displaying the help
              message

       <b>-d</b> <u>DATASET</u>, <b>--dataset</b> <u>DATASET</u>
              Add the URLs to this dataset (or possibly subdatasets of this dataset). An empty  or  non-existent
              directory  is passed to create a new dataset. New subdatasets can be specified with `FILENAME-FOR‐
              MAT`. Constraints: Value must be a Dataset or a valid identifier of a Dataset  (e.g.  a  path)  or
              value must be NONE

       <b>-t</b> TYPE, <b>--input-type</b> TYPE
              Whether  `URL-FILE`  should  be  considered a CSV file, TSV file, or JSON file. The default value,
              "ext", means to consider `URL-FILE` as a JSON file if it ends with ".json" or a  TSV  file  if  it
              ends  with  ".tsv".  Otherwise,  treat it as a CSV file. Constraints: value must be one of ('ext',
              'csv', 'tsv', 'json') [Default: 'ext']

       <b>-x</b> REGEXP, <b>--exclude-autometa</b> REGEXP
              By default, metadata field=value pairs are constructed with each column in  `URL-FILE`,  excluding
              any single column that is specified via `URL-FORMAT`. This argument can be used to exclude columns
              that  match  a regular expression. If set to '*' or an empty string, automatic metadata extraction
              is disabled completely. This argument does not affect metadata set explicitly with --meta.

       <b>-m</b> FORMAT, <b>--meta</b> FORMAT
              A format string that specifies metadata. It should be structured as "&lt;field&gt;=&lt;value&gt;". As an exam‐
              ple, "location={3}" would mean that the value for the "location" metadata field should be set  the
              value of the fourth column. This option can be given multiple times.

       <b>--key</b> FORMAT
              A  format  string  that specifies an annex key for the file content. In this case, the file is not
              downloaded; instead the key is used to create the file without content. The value should be struc‐
              tured as "[et:]&lt;input backend&gt;[-s&lt;bytes&gt;]--&lt;hash&gt;". The optional "et:" prefix, which requires git-
              annex 8.20201116 or later, signals to toggle extension state of the input backend  (i.e.,  MD5  vs
              MD5E). As an example, "et:MD5-s{size}--{md5sum}" would use the 'md5sum' and 'size' columns to con‐
              struct  the  key,  migrating  the  key from MD5 to MD5E, with an extension based on the file name.
              Note: If the *input* backend itself is an annex extension backend (i.e., a backend with a trailing
              "E"), the key's extension will not be updated to match the extension  of  the  corresponding  file
              name.  Thus,  unless the input keys and file names are generated from git-annex, it is recommended
              to avoid using extension backends as input. If an extension is desired, use the plain  variant  as
              input  and  prepend  "et:"  so that git-annex will migrate from the plain backend to the extension
              variant.

       <b>--message</b> MESSAGE
              Use this message when committing the URL additions. Constraints: value must be NONE or value  must
              be a string

       <b>-n</b>, <b>--dry-run</b>
              Report which URLs would be downloaded to which files and then exit.

       <b>--fast</b> If  True, add the URLs, but don't download their content. WARNING: ONLY USE THIS OPTION IF YOU UN‐
              DERSTAND THE CONSEQUENCES. If the content of the URLs is not downloaded, then datalad will  refuse
              to  retrieve  the contents with `datalad get &lt;file&gt;` by default because the content of the URLs is
              not verified. Add `annex.security.allow-unverified-downloads = ACKTHPPT` to your git config to by‐
              pass the safety check. Underneath, this passes the `--fast` flag to `git annex addurl`.

       <b>--ifexists</b> {overwrite|skip}
              What to do if a constructed file name already exists. The default behavior is to proceed with  the
              `git  annex  addurl`,  which will fail if the file size has changed. If set to 'overwrite', remove
              the old file before adding the new one. If set to 'skip', do not add the  new  file.  Constraints:
              value must be one of ('overwrite', 'skip')

       <b>--missing-value</b> VALUE
              When  an  empty  string is encountered, use this value instead. Constraints: value must be NONE or
              value must be a string

       <b>--nosave</b>
              by default all modifications to a dataset are immediately saved. Giving this option  will  disable
              this behavior.

       <b>--version-urls</b>
              Try  to  add  a  version  ID to the URL. This currently only has an effect on HTTP URLs for AWS S3
              buckets. s3:// URL versioning is not yet supported, but any URL that already contains a  "version‐
              Id=" parameter will be used as is.

       <b>-c</b> PROC, <b>--cfg-proc</b> PROC
              Pass this --cfg_proc value when calling CREATE to make datasets.

       <b>-J</b> NJOBS, <b>--jobs</b> NJOBS
              how many parallel jobs (where possible) to use. "auto" corresponds to the number defined by 'data‐
              lad.runtime.max-annex-jobs'  configuration  item.  Constraints:  value must be convertible to type
              'int' or value must be NONE or value must be one of ('auto',)

       <b>--drop-after</b>
              drop files after adding to annex.

       <b>--on-collision</b> {error|error-if-different|take-first|take-last}
              What to do when more than one row produces the same file name. By default an error  is  triggered.
              "error-if-different"  suppresses  that error if rows for a given file name collision have the same
              URL and metadata. "take-first" or "take-last" indicate to instead take the first row or  last  row
              from each set of colliding rows. Constraints: value must be one of ('error', 'error-if-different',
              'take-first', 'take-last') [Default: 'error']

       <b>--version</b>
              show the module and its version which provides the command
