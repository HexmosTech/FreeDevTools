</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       pt-fk-error-logger - Log MySQL foreign key errors.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       Usage: pt-fk-error-logger [OPTIONS] [DSN]

       pt-fk-error-logger logs information about foreign key errors on the given DSN.  Information is printed to
       "STDOUT", and it can also be saved to a table by specifying "--dest".  The tool runs for forever unless
       "--run-time" or "--iterations" is specified.

       Print foreign key errors on host1:

          pt-fk-error-logger h=host1

       Print foreign key errors on host1 once then exit:

          pt-fk-error-logger h=host1 --iterations 1

       Save foreign key errors on host1 to percona_schema.fke on host2:

         pt-fk-error-logger h=host1 --dest h=host2,D=percona_schema,t=fke

</pre><h4><b>RISKS</b></h4><pre>
       Percona Toolkit is mature, proven in the real world, and well tested, but all database tools can pose a
       risk to the system and the database server.  Before using this tool, please:

       •   Read the tool's documentation

       •   Review the tool's known "BUGS"

       •   Test the tool on a non-production server

       •   Backup your production server and verify the backups

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       pt-fk-error-logger prints or saves the foreign key errors text from "SHOW INNODB STATUS".  The errors are
       not  parsed  or  interpreted  in any way.  Foreign key errors are uniquely identified by their timestamp.
       Only new (more recent) errors are printed or saved.

       By default the tool runs forever, checking  every  "--interval"  seconds  for  new  foreign  key  errors.
       Specify "--run-time" and/or "--iterations" to limit how long the tool runs.

</pre><h4><b>OUTPUT</b></h4><pre>
       The  foreign  key error text from "SHOW ENGINE INNODB STATUS" is printed to "STDOUT", unless "--quiet" is
       specified.  Errors and warnings are printed to "STDERR".

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       This tool accepts additional command-line arguments.  Refer to the "SYNOPSIS" and usage  information  for
       details.

       --ask-pass
           Prompt for a password when connecting to MySQL.

       --charset
           short form: -A; type: string

           Default  character  set.   If  the  value  is utf8, sets Perl's binmode on STDOUT to utf8, passes the
           mysql_enable_utf8 option to DBD::mysql, and runs SET NAMES UTF8 after connecting to MySQL.  Any other
           value sets binmode on STDOUT without the utf8 layer, and runs SET NAMES after connecting to MySQL.

       --config
           type: Array

           Read this comma-separated list of config files; if specified, this must be the first  option  on  the
           command line.

       --daemonize
           Fork to the background and detach from the shell.  POSIX operating systems only.

       --database
           short form: -D; type: string

           Connect to this database.

       --defaults-file
           short form: -F; type: string

           Only read mysql options from the given file.  You must give an absolute pathname.

       --dest
           type: DSN

           Save foreign key errors in this table.  The DSN must specify a database (D) and table (t).

           Missing  DSN values are inherited from the DSN being monitored, so you can omit most values if you're
           saving foreign key errors on the same host.

           The following table is suggested:

            CREATE TABLE foreign_key_errors (
              ts datetime NOT NULL,
              error text NOT NULL,
              PRIMARY KEY (ts)
            )

           The only information saved is the timestamp and the foreign key error text.

       --help
           Show help and exit.

       --host
           short form: -h; type: string

           Connect to host.

       --interval
           type: time; default: 30

           How often to check for foreign key errors.

       --iterations
           type: int

           How many times to check for foreign key errors.  By default, this option is undefined which means  an
           infinite  number  of  iterations.   The  tool  always exits for "--run-time", regardless of the value
           specified for this option.  For example, the tool will  exit  after  1  minute  with  "--run-time  1m
           --iterations  4  --interval  30"  because  4  iterations at 30 second intervals would take 2 minutes,
           longer than the 1 mintue run-time.

       --log
           type: string

           Print all output to this file when daemonized.

       --password
           short form: -p; type: string

           Password to use when connecting.  If password contains commas they must be escaped with a  backslash:
           "exam\,ple"

       --pid
           type: string

           Create  the  given  PID  file.   The  tool  won't start if the PID file already exists and the PID it
           contains is different than the current PID.  However, if the PID file exists and the PID it  contains
           is  no  longer  running,  the tool will overwrite the PID file with the current PID.  The PID file is
           removed automatically when the tool exits.

       --port
           short form: -P; type: int

           Port number to use for connection.

       --quiet
           Do not print foreign key errors; only print errors and warnings to "STDERR".

       --run-time
           type: time

           How long to run before exiting.  By default, the tool runs forever.

       --set-vars
           type: Array

           Set the MySQL variables in this comma-separated list of "variable=value" pairs.

           By default, the tool sets:

              wait_timeout=10000

           Variables specified on the command line override these defaults.  For example, specifying "--set-vars
           wait_timeout=500" overrides the defaultvalue of 10000.

           The tool prints a warning and continues if a variable cannot be set.

       --socket
           short form: -S; type: string

           Socket file to use for connection.

       --user
           short form: -u; type: string

           User for login if not current user.

       --version
           Show version and exit.

       --[no]version-check
           default: yes

           Check for the latest version of Percona Toolkit, MySQL, and other programs.

           This is a standard "check for updates automatically" feature, with two additional  features.   First,
           the  tool  checks  its own version and also the versions of the following software: operating system,
           Percona Monitoring and Management (PMM), MySQL, Perl, MySQL driver for Perl (DBD::mysql), and Percona
           Toolkit. Second, it checks for and warns about versions  with  known  problems.  For  example,  MySQL
           5.5.25 had a critical bug and was re-released as 5.5.25a.

           A  secure connection to Percona’s Version Check database server is done to perform these checks. Each
           request is logged by the server, including software version numbers and  unique  ID  of  the  checked
           system.  The  ID  is  generated  by the Percona Toolkit installation script or when the Version Check
           database call is done for the first time.

           Any updates or known problems are printed to STDOUT before the tool's normal  output.   This  feature
           should never interfere with the normal operation of the tool.

</pre><h4><b>DSN</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       These  DSN  options are used to create a DSN.  Each option is given like "option=value".  The options are
       case-sensitive, so P and p are not the same option.  There cannot be whitespace before or after  the  "="
       and  if  the  value  contains  whitespace  it  must be quoted.  DSN options are comma-separated.  See the
       percona-toolkit manpage for full details.

       •   A

           dsn: charset; copy: yes

           Default character set.

       •   D

           dsn: database; copy: yes

           Default database.

       •   F

           dsn: mysql_read_default_file; copy: yes

           Only read default options from the given file

       •   h

           dsn: host; copy: yes

           Connect to host.

       •   p

           dsn: password; copy: yes

           Password to use when connecting.  If password contains commas they must be escaped with a  backslash:
           "exam\,ple"

       •   P

           dsn: port; copy: yes

           Port number to use for connection.

       •   S

           dsn: mysql_socket; copy: yes

           Socket file to use for connection.

       •   t

           Table in which to store foreign key errors.

       •   u

           dsn: user; copy: yes

           User for login if not current user.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       The  environment  variable "PTDEBUG" enables verbose debugging output to STDERR.  To enable debugging and
       capture all output to a file, run the tool like:

          PTDEBUG=1 pt-fk-error-logger ... &gt; FILE 2&gt;&amp;1

       Be careful: debugging output is voluminous and can generate several megabytes of output.

</pre><h4><b>SYSTEM</b> <b>REQUIREMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       You need Perl, DBI, DBD::mysql, and some core packages that ought to be installed in any  reasonably  new
       version of Perl.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       For a list of known bugs, see &lt;<a href="http://www.percona.com/bugs/pt-fk-error-logger">http://www.percona.com/bugs/pt-fk-error-logger</a>&gt;.

       Please  report bugs at &lt;https://jira.percona.com/projects/PT&gt;.  Include the following information in your
       bug report:
