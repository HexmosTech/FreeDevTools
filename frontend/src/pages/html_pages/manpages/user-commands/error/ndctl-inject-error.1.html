</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       ndctl-inject-error - inject media errors at a namespace offset

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>ndctl</u> <u>inject-error</u> &lt;namespace&gt; [&lt;options&gt;]

</pre><h4><b>THEORY</b> <b>OF</b> <b>OPERATION</b></h4><pre>
       The capacity of an NVDIMM REGION (contiguous span of persistent memory) is accessed via one or more
       NAMESPACE devices. REGION is the Linux term for what ACPI and UEFI call a DIMM-interleave-set, or a
       system-physical-address-range that is striped (by the memory controller) across one or more memory
       modules.

       The UEFI specification defines the <u>NVDIMM</u> <u>Label</u> <u>Protocol</u> as the combination of label area access methods
       and a data format for provisioning one or more NAMESPACE objects from a REGION. Note that label support
       is optional and if Linux does not detect the label capability it will automatically instantiate a
       "label-less" namespace per region. Examples of label-less namespaces are the ones created by the kernel’s
       <u>memmap=ss!nn</u> command line option (see the nvdimm wiki on kernel.org), or NVDIMMs without a valid
       <u>namespace</u> <u>index</u> in their label area.

           <b>Note</b>

           Label-less namespaces lack many of the features of their label-rich cousins. For example, their size
           cannot be modified, or they cannot be fully <u>destroyed</u> (i.e. the space reclaimed). A destroy operation
           will zero any mode-specific metadata. Finally, for create-namespace operations on label-less
           namespaces, ndctl bypasses the region capacity availability checks, and always satisfies the request
           using the full region capacity. The only reconfiguration operation supported on a label-less
           namespace is changing its <u>mode</u>.

       A namespace can be provisioned to operate in one of 4 modes, <u>fsdax</u>, <u>devdax</u>, <u>sector</u>, and <u>raw</u>. Here are the
       expected usage models for these modes:

       •   fsdax: Filesystem-DAX mode is the default mode of a namespace when specifying <u>ndctl</u> <u>create-namespace</u>
           with no options. It creates a block device (/dev/pmemX[.Y]) that supports the DAX capabilities of
           Linux filesystems (xfs and ext4 to date). DAX removes the page cache from the I/O path and allows
           <a href="../man2/mmap.2.html">mmap</a>(2) to establish direct mappings to persistent memory media. The DAX capability enables workloads
           / working-sets that would exceed the capacity of the page cache to scale up to the capacity of
           persistent memory. Workloads that fit in page cache or perform bulk data transfers may not see
           benefit from DAX. When in doubt, pick this mode.

       •   devdax: Device-DAX mode enables similar <a href="../man2/mmap.2.html">mmap</a>(2) DAX mapping capabilities as Filesystem-DAX. However,
           instead of a block-device that can support a DAX-enabled filesystem, this mode emits a single
           character device file (/dev/daxX.Y). Use this mode to assign persistent memory to a virtual-machine,
           register persistent memory for RDMA, or when gigantic mappings are needed.

       •   sector: Use this mode to host legacy filesystems that do not checksum metadata or applications that
           are not prepared for torn sectors after a crash. Expected usage for this mode is for small boot
           volumes. This mode is compatible with other operating systems.

       •   raw: Raw mode is effectively just a memory disk that does not support DAX. Typically this indicates a
           namespace that was created by tooling or another operating system that did not know how to create a
           Linux <u>fsdax</u> or <u>devdax</u> mode namespace. This mode is compatible with other operating systems, but
           again, does not support DAX operation.

       ndctl-inject-error can be used to ask the platform to simulate media errors in the NVDIMM address space
       to aid debugging and development of features related to error handling.

       By default, injecting an error actually only injects an error to the first <u>n</u> bytes of the block, where <u>n</u>
       is the output of ndctl_cmd_ars_cap_get_size(). In other words, we only inject one <u>ars_unit</u> per sector.
       This is sufficient for Linux to mark the whole sector as bad, and will show up as such in the various
       <u>badblocks</u> lists in the kernel. If multiple blocks are being injected, only the first <u>n</u> bytes of each
       block specified will be injected as errors. This can be overridden by the --saturate option, which will
       force the entire block to be injected as an error.

           <b>Warning</b>

           These commands are DANGEROUS and can cause data loss. They are only provided for testing and
           debugging purposes.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Inject errors in namespace0.0 at block 12 for 2 blocks (i.e. 12, 13)

       ndctl inject-error --block=12 --count=2 namespace0.0

       Check status of injected errors on namespace0.0

       ndctl inject-error --status namespace0.0

       Uninject errors at block 12 for 2 blocks on namespace0.0

       ndctl inject-error --uninject --block=12 --count=2 namespace0.0

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       -B, --block=
           Namespace block offset in 512 byte sized blocks where the error is to be injected.

               NOTE: The offset is interpreted in different ways based on the "mode"
               of the namespace. For "raw" mode, the offset is the base namespace
               offset. For "fsdax" mode (i.e. a "pfn" namespace), the offset is
               relative to the user-visible part of the namespace, and the offset
               introduced by the kernel's metadata will be accounted for. For a
               "sector" mode namespace (i.e. a "BTT" namespace), the offset is
               relative to the base namespace, as the BTT translation details are
               internal to the kernel, and can't be accounted for while injecting
               errors.

       -n, --count=
           Number of blocks to inject as errors. This is also in terms of fixed, 512 byte blocks.

       -d, --uninject
           This option will ask the platform to remove any injected errors for the specified block offset, and
           count.

               WARNING: This will not clear the kernel's internal badblock tracking,
               those can only be cleared by doing a write to the affected locations.
               Hence use the --clear option only if you know exactly what you are
               doing. For normal usage, injected errors should only be cleared by
               doing writes. Do not expect have the original data intact after
               injecting an error, and clearing it using --clear - it will be lost,
               as the only "real" way to clear the error location is to write to it
               or zero it (truncate/hole-punch).

       -t, --status
           This option will retrieve the status of injected errors. Note that this will not retrieve all
           known/latent errors (i.e. non injected ones), and is NOT equivalent to performing an Address Range
           Scrub.

       -N, --no-notify
           This option is only valid when injecting errors. By default, the error inject command and will ask
           platform firmware to trigger a notification in the kernel, asking it to update its state of known
           errors. With this option, the error will still be injected, the kernel will not get a notification,
           and the error will appear as a latent media error when the location is accessed. If the platform
           firmware does not support this feature, this will have no effect.

       -S, --saturate
           This option forces error injection or un-injection to cover the entire address range covered by the
           specified block(s).

       -v, --verbose
           Emit debug messages for the error injection process

       -u, --human
           Format numbers representing storage sizes, or offsets as human readable strings with units instead of
           the default machine-friendly raw-integer data. Convert other numeric fields into hexadecimal strings.

       -r, --region=
           A <u>regionX</u> device name, or a region id number. Restrict the operation to the specified region(s). The
           keyword <u>all</u> can be specified to indicate the lack of any restriction, however this is the same as not
           supplying a --region option at all.

       -b, --bus=
           A bus id number, or a provider string (e.g. "ACPI.NFIT"). Restrict the operation to the specified
           bus(es). The keyword <u>all</u> can be specified to indicate the lack of any restriction, however this is
           the same as not supplying a --bus option at all.
