       Msc-generator - draws signalling charts from textual descriptions

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>msc-gen</b> [<u>OPTIONS</u>] [<u>infile</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Msc-generator draws signalling charts from textual descriptions.

   <b>Program</b> <b>information:</b>
       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
              Display this help and exit.

       <b>-l</b>     Display program license and exit.

       <b>--version</b>
              Display version information and exit.

   <b>Operation</b> <b>mode</b> <b>selection:</b>
       <b>--tei-mode</b>
              Using  this  option puts msc-generator into text editor integration mode. In this mode msc-gen can
              produce color syntax highlighting, quick error, text indent and hinting/autocomplete  information.
              Input file(s) are read from standard input, output is written to standard output, thus no input or
              output  filename  can  be specified and options <b>-i</b> and <b>-o</b> are invalid. Same with option <b>-T</b> option,
              but <b>-S</b> is mandatory. Option <b>--tei-mode</b> implies <b>-Pno</b>, as well. See the documentation for details.

       <b>--list-embedded</b>

              Lists the charts embedded in a PPT file.

   <b>Input</b> <b>control:</b>
       &lt;infile&gt;
              The file from which to read input. If specified as '-', input will be read from  stdin  (and  '-S'
              must  be  used). The filename extension determines what type of chart the input file contains. You
              can also specify a PNG image, in which case Msc-generator searches for the chart text embedded  in
              an  iTXT  chunk.   You  can  also  specify a PPT file optionally followed by a slide number, like:
              'my.pptx:2'. In this case the chart text is looked for in the PPT file on the given slide (2). You
              can omit the slide if the file contains only one embedded chart. If the  slide  contains  multiple
              embedded  charts, you can append a number (in increasing Z-order of the chart) to select one. (You
              can embed charts with Msc-generator using, e.g., '-T embed:1' or update embedded charts  by  using
              them both as input and output: 'msc-gen my.pptx:2:1 <b>-T</b> embed:2:1 <b>-o</b> my.pptx'

       <b>-i</b> &lt;infile&gt; To retain compatibility with mscgen, this is an alternate way to

              specify the input file.

       <b>-S</b> &lt;lang&gt;
              Forces  Msc-generator  to interpret the input file as a specific type of chart. This overrides the
              guess from the filename extension. Current chart types are 'signalling' for Signalling Charts  and
              'graph' for Graphviz graphs and 'block' for Block Diagrams.

       <b>--utf8</b> Forces the input file to be interpreted as UTF-8, even if it does not look like it.

       <b>--utf16</b>
              Forces the input file to be interpreted as UTF-16, even if it looks like UTF-8 or ASCII.

       <b>--opt=</b>&lt;chart_option&gt;=&lt;value&gt;

              These  options  will  be  evaluated before the input file. Any value here will be overwritten by a
              conflicting option in the file.

       <b>--design=</b>&lt;chart_design&gt;

              Any chart design can be specified here, taking precedence over the design specified in  the  input
              file.

   <b>Output</b> <b>control:</b>
       <b>-a[h]</b>  Automatic  pagination.  Used  only  with  full-page  output. If specified, scale cannot be 'auto'.
              Specifying <b>-ah</b> will insert a heading after automatically inserted page breaks.

       <b>-D</b> &lt;design_file&gt;

              Load file containing additional chart design definitions.  You can have multiple of this option to
              load several design files, after the default ones. These files are loaded even if  <b>--nodesigns</b>  is
              specified.

       <b>-e</b>     If  output  type  is  PNG,  specifying this will embed the chart text into the PNG file as an iTXt
              chunk. In case of multiple pages (and multiple output files) all will have it  embedded.   Results
              in a warning if the output type is not PNG.

       <b>-F</b> &lt;font&gt;
              Use  specified  font.  This  must  be a font name available in the local system, and overrides the
              MSCGEN_FONT environment variable if that is also set. (On Linux\Unix try fontconfig.)

       <b>-L</b> &lt;lang&gt;
              Use the specified language to select fonts. It must be an RFC 3066 style language  specifier,  and
              will  override  any  value  in the MSCGEN_FONT_LANG environment variable. Use either 2 letter lang
              codes, such as 'ja' for Japanese, 'zh' for Chinese, etc.  Ignored on Windows, as  font  names  are
              language specific there.

       <b>-m</b>{lrud}=&lt;margin&gt;

              Useful  only  for  full-page output, specifies the margin.  A separate option is needed to specify
              the left, right, upwards and downwards margins, denoted  by  the  second  letter  of  the  option.
              Margins  are  to be specified in inches (number only) or in centimeters, if appended with 'cm' (no
              spaces). The default margin is half inches everywhere.

       <b>--nodesigns</b>

              If you specify this no design files will be loaded (except the ones you specify with <b>-D</b>). This  is
              useful to increase performance when you do not use them anyway.

       <b>--nopaths</b>
              Only the filename will be printed in error messages without its path.

       <b>-o</b> &lt;file&gt;
              Write  output  to  the named file. If omitted, the input filename will be appended by an extension
              suitable for the output format.  If neither input nor output file is given, msc-gen_out.* will  be
              used. Specifying '-' will result in the out be written to standard output.

       <b>-p[=</b>&lt;page size]

              Full-page output. (PDF or PPT only, automatically implied for PPT) In this case the chart is drawn
              on fixed-size pages (following pagination) with one pixel equaling to 1/72 inches for PDF and 1/96
              inches  for  PPT.  If  a  chart  page  is  larger than a physical page it is simply cropped with a
              warning. Setting the scale with the <b>-s</b> option enables zooming. Page size can be set to  ISO  sizes
              from  A0 to A6, and to US sizes, such as letter, legal, ledger and tabloid. Append a 'p' or an 'l'
              for portrait and landscape,  respectively  (except  for  'tabloid'  and  'ledger',  which  are  by
              definition  portrait and landscape, resp.). E.g., use 'A4p', 'A2l' or 'letter_l'. Default is 'A4p'
              for PDF and 'widescreen_l' for PPT, but you can also use 'on_screen_4_3_l' or 'on_screen_16_9'  as
              well.

       <b>--no-pedantic</b>

       <b>--pedantic</b>
              Set  or unset the pedantic chart option (defaults to what is set in the design lib or false if not
              defined).

       <b>-Pno</b>   No progress indicator displayed.

       <b>-q</b>     No progress indicator displayed, plus any final 'Success.' is also suppressed. On success with  no
              warnings msc-gen prints nothing.

       <b>-s=</b>&lt;scale&gt;
              Can  be  used to scale chart size up or down. Default is 1.0.  Cannot be used together with any of
              the <b>-x</b> or <b>-y</b> options.  Only for bitmap or full-page output (<b>-p</b>).  For full-page  output,  you  can
              set &lt;scale&gt; to 'width' which results in the chart width being set to the page width, or to 'auto',
              which  scales  such that all pages fit. For full-page output, you can specify multiple <b>-s</b> options,
              which makes msc-gen to try them in the order specified until one is found for which no pages  need
              to be cropped. If none is such, the last one will be used and a warning will be given.

       <b>-T</b> &lt;type&gt;
              Specifies  the  output  file  type,  which  may  be 'png', 'eps', 'pdf', 'svg', 'ppt' or 'emf' (if
              supported on your system).  Default is 'png'. The token 'ismap' produces an NCSA  formatted  ismap
              file.  The  token  'lmap'  is  accepted and results in a text file listing (the first line of) all
              labels and their page number and coordinates. 'src' will simply save the chart text; useful if you
              want to extract the source of charts embedded in PNG and PPT input files. You can also use 'embed'
              with a PPT output file to append a page with a PNG of the chart that includes the chart text  (and
              can  be later edited by Msc-generator). 'embed:&lt;page&gt;' will add the PNG to an existing page, while
              'embed:&lt;page&gt;:&lt;chart&gt;' will update an existing chart (&lt;chart&gt; is the number of the chart  on  that
              page in Z-order starting from 1).

       <b>--TI</b>   Additional Technical Info is printed about compilation.

       <b>-va=</b>&lt;center|up|down&gt;

       <b>-ha=</b>&lt;center|left|right&gt;

              Set the vertical and horizontal alignment within a page for fullpage output.

       <b>-Wno</b>   No warnings displayed.

       <b>-x=</b>&lt;width&gt;
              Specifies chart width (in pixels). Only for bitmap output.

       <b>-y=</b>&lt;height&gt; Specifies chart height (in pixels). If only one of <b>-x</b> or <b>-y</b>

              is specified, the aspect ratio is kept. Only for bitmap output.

       <b>--fps=</b>&lt;fps&gt; Can be used to select the maximum frames per second for the GUI.

              Silently  ignored  when  not  using  the  GUI.  Ignored on Windows, as there frame presentation is
              synchronized to the refresh of the screen maxing the FPS to the screen FPS.

   <b>Signalling</b> <b>chart</b> <b>specific</b> <b>options:</b>

       <b>--force-mscgen</b>

              Forces the chart to be interpreted in  mscgen  mode.  Note  that  many  Msc-generator  attributes,
              commands  and  keywords are still recognized. This setting makes conflicting syntax be interpreted
              as mscgen would do. Without this switch Msc-generator uses the  mscgen  mode  only  if  the  chart
              starts with the text 'msc {'.

       <b>--prevent-mscgen</b>

              Prevents  the chart to be interpreted in mscgen mode. Note that some mscgen attributes and symbols
              are still recognized. This setting makes conflicting syntax be interpreted as Msc-generator  would
              do.  Without this switch Msc-generator uses the mscgen mode if the chart starts with the text 'msc
              {'.

       <b>-Wno-mscgen</b> Disables warnings for deprecated constructs kept only for

              backwards compatibility with mscgen. Has no effect with  <b>--force-mscgen</b>,  in  that  case  no  such
              warnings are emitted anyway.

   <b>Environment</b> <b>variables:</b>
              MSCGEN_FONT:  can  be used to define the default font similar to the <b>-F</b> option.  MSCGEN_FONT_LANG:
              can be used to define the default language for fontconfig

              based systems, similar to the <b>-L</b> option.

              MSCGEN_NOFONT: When set (to any value), Msc-generator draws no text to any

              output (but considers the place of the text at layout as normally. Useful for testing.

              MSCGEN_FPS: When set to a number, the GUI will use it as maximum frames per

              second. Can be overridden by the <b>--fps</b> option. Ignored on Windows, as there frame presentation  is
              synchronized to the refresh of the screen maxing the FPS to the screen FPS.
