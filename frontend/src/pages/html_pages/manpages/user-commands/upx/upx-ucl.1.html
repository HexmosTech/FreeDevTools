       <b>UPX</b> is a portable, extendable, high-performance executable packer for several different executable
       formats. It achieves an excellent compression ratio and offers <u>*very*</u> fast decompression. Your
       executables suffer no memory overhead or other drawbacks for most of the formats supported, because of
       in-place decompression.

</pre><h4><b>DISCLAIMER</b></h4><pre>
       <b>UPX</b> comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details see the file COPYING.

       Please report all problems or suggestions to the authors. Thanks.

</pre><h4><b>SECURITY</b> <b>CONTEXT</b></h4><pre>
       IMPORTANT NOTE: <b>UPX</b> inherits the security context of any files it handles.

       This means that packing, unpacking, or even testing or listing a file requires the same security
       considerations as actually executing the file.

       Use <b>UPX</b> on trusted files only!

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>UPX</b> is a versatile executable packer with the following features:

         - secure: as UPX is documented Open Source since many years any relevant
             Security/Antivirus software is able to peek inside UPX compressed
             apps to verify them

         - excellent compression ratio: typically compresses better than Zip,
             use UPX to decrease the size of your distribution !

         - very fast decompression: more than 500 MB/sec on any reasonably modern
             machine

         - no memory overhead for your compressed executables for most of the
             supported formats because of in-place decompression

         - safe: you can list, test and unpack your executables.
             Also, a checksum of both the compressed and uncompressed file is
             maintained internally.

         - universal: UPX can pack a number of executable formats, including
             Windows programs and DLLs, macOS apps and Linux executables

         - portable: UPX is written in portable endian-neutral C++

         - extendable: because of the class layout it's very easy to support
             new executable formats or add new compression algorithms

         - free: UPX is distributed with full source code under the GNU General
             Public License v2+, with special exceptions granting the free usage
             for commercial programs

       You probably understand now why we call <b>UPX</b> the "<u>ultimate</u>" executable packer.

</pre><h4><b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Compress</b>
       This is the default operation, eg. <b>upx</b> <b>yourfile.exe</b> will compress the file specified on the command line.

   <b>Decompress</b>
       All <b>UPX</b> supported file formats can be unpacked using the <b>-d</b> switch, eg.  <b>upx</b> <b>-d</b> <b>yourfile.exe</b> will
       uncompress the file you've just compressed.

   <b>Test</b>
       The <b>-t</b> command tests the integrity of the compressed and uncompressed data, eg. <b>upx</b> <b>-t</b> <b>yourfile.exe</b> check
       whether your file can be safely decompressed. Note, that this command doesn't check the whole file, only
       the part that will be uncompressed during program execution. This means that you should not use this
       command instead of a virus checker.

   <b>List</b>
       The <b>-l</b> command prints out some information about the compressed files specified on the command line as
       parameters, eg <b>upx</b> <b>-l</b> <b>yourfile.exe</b> shows the compressed / uncompressed size and the compression ratio of
       <u>yourfile.exe</u>.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-q</b>: be quiet, suppress warnings

       <b>-q</b> <b>-q</b> (or <b>-qq</b>): be very quiet, suppress errors

       <b>-q</b> <b>-q</b> <b>-q</b> (or <b>-qqq</b>): produce no output at all

       <b>--help</b>: prints the help

       <b>--version</b>: print the version of <b>UPX</b>

       <b>--exact</b>: when compressing, require to be able to get a byte-identical file after decompression with
       option <b>-d</b>. [NOTE: this is work in progress and is not supported for all formats yet. If you do care, as a
       workaround you can compress and then decompress your program a first time - any further compress-
       decompress steps should then yield byte-identical results as compared to the first decompressed version.]

       <b>-k</b>: keep backup files

       <b>-o</b> <b>file</b>: write output to file

       [ ...more docs need to be written... - type `<b>upx</b> <b>--help</b>' for now ]

</pre><h4><b>COMPRESSION</b> <b>LEVELS</b> <b>&amp;</b> <b>TUNING</b></h4><pre>
       <b>UPX</b> offers ten different compression levels from <b>-1</b> to <b>-9</b>, and <b>--best</b>.  The default compression level is
       <b>-8</b> for files smaller than 512 KiB, and <b>-7</b> otherwise.

       •   Compression levels 1, 2 and 3 are pretty fast.

       •   Compression levels 4, 5 and 6 achieve a good time/ratio performance.

       •   Compression levels 7, 8 and 9 favor compression ratio over speed.

       •   Compression level <b>--best</b> may take a long time.

       Note that compression level <b>--best</b> can be somewhat slow for large files, but you definitely should use it
       when releasing a final version of your program.

       Quick info for achieving the best compression ratio:

       •   Try <b>upx</b> <b>--brute</b> <b>--no-lzma</b> <b>myfile.exe</b> or even <b>upx</b> <b>--ultra-brute</b> <b>--no-lzma</b> <b>myfile.exe</b>.

       •   The  option <b>--lzma</b> enables LZMA compression, which compresses better but is *significantly slower* at
           decompression. You probably do not want to use it for large files.

           (Note that <b>--lzma</b> is automatically enabled by <b>--all-methods</b> and <b>--brute</b>, use <b>--no-lzma</b> to override.)

       •   Try if <b>--overlay=strip</b> works.

       •   For win32/pe programs there's <b>--strip-relocs=0</b>. See notes below.

</pre><h4><b>OVERLAY</b> <b>HANDLING</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Info: An "overlay" means auxiliary data attached after the logical end of an  executable,  and  it  often
       contains  application  specific  data  (this  is a common practice to avoid an extra data file, though it
       would be better to use resource sections).

       <b>UPX</b> handles overlays like many other executable packers do:  it  simply  copies  the  overlay  after  the
       compressed  image.  This  works  with  some  files,  but  doesn't  work  with others, depending on how an
       application actually accesses this overlaid data.

         --overlay=copy    Copy any extra data attached to the file. [DEFAULT]

         --overlay=strip   Strip any overlay from the program instead of
                           copying it. Be warned, this may make the compressed
                           program crash or otherwise unusable.

         --overlay=skip    Refuse to compress any program which has an overlay.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLE</b></h4><pre>
       The environment variable <b>UPX</b> can hold a set of default options for <b>UPX</b>.  These  options  are  interpreted
       first and can be overwritten by explicit command line parameters.  For example:

           for DOS/Windows:   set UPX=-9 --compress-icons#0
           for sh/ksh/zsh:    UPX="-9 --compress-icons=0"; export UPX
           for csh/tcsh:      setenv UPX "-9 --compress-icons=0"

       Under  DOS/Windows  you  must  use  '#' instead of '=' when setting the environment variable because of a
       COMMAND.COM limitation.

       Not all of the options are valid in the environment variable - <b>UPX</b> will tell you.

       You can explicitly use the <b>--no-env</b> option to ignore the environment variable.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>THE</b> <b>SUPPORTED</b> <b>EXECUTABLE</b> <b>FORMATS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>NOTES</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>ATARI/TOS</b>
       This is the executable format used by the Atari ST/TT, a Motorola 68000 based personal computer which was
       popular in the late '80s. Support of this format is only because of nostalgic  feelings  of  one  of  the
       authors and serves no practical purpose :-).  See https://freemint.github.io for more info.

       Packed  programs  will be byte-identical to the original after uncompression.  All debug information will
       be stripped, though.

       Extra options available for this executable format:

         --all-methods       Compress the program several times, using all
                             available compression methods. This may improve
                             the compression ratio in some cases, but usually
                             the default method gives the best results anyway.

   <b>NOTES</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>BVMLINUZ/I386</b>
       Same as vmlinuz/i386.

   <b>NOTES</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>DOS/COM</b>
       Obviously <b>UPX</b> won't work with executables that want to read data from themselves (like  some  commandline
       utilities that ship with Win95/98/ME).

       Compressed programs only work on a 286+.

       Packed programs will be byte-identical to the original after uncompression.

       Maximum uncompressed size: ~65100 bytes.

       Extra options available for this executable format:

         --8086              Create an executable that works on any 8086 CPU.

         --all-methods       Compress the program several times, using all
                             available compression methods. This may improve
                             the compression ratio in some cases, but usually
                             the default method gives the best results anyway.

         --all-filters       Compress the program several times, using all
                             available preprocessing filters. This may improve
                             the compression ratio in some cases, but usually
                             the default filter gives the best results anyway.

   <b>NOTES</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>DOS/EXE</b>
       dos/exe stands for all "normal" 16-bit DOS executables.

       Obviously  <b>UPX</b> won't work with executables that want to read data from themselves (like some command line
       utilities that ship with Win95/98/ME).

       Compressed programs only work on a 286+.

       Extra options available for this executable format:

         --8086              Create an executable that works on any 8086 CPU.

         --no-reloc          Use no relocation records in the exe header.

         --all-methods       Compress the program several times, using all
                             available compression methods. This may improve
                             the compression ratio in some cases, but usually
                             the default method gives the best results anyway.

   <b>NOTES</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>DOS/SYS</b>
       Compressed programs only work on a 286+.

       Packed programs will be byte-identical to the original after uncompression.

       Maximum uncompressed size: ~65350 bytes.

       Extra options available for this executable format:

         --8086              Create an executable that works on any 8086 CPU.

         --all-methods       Compress the program several times, using all
                             available compression methods. This may improve
                             the compression ratio in some cases, but usually
                             the default method gives the best results anyway.

         --all-filters       Compress the program several times, using all
                             available preprocessing filters. This may improve
                             the compression ratio in some cases, but usually
                             the default filter gives the best results anyway.

   <b>NOTES</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>DJGPP2/COFF</b>
       First of all, it is recommended to use <b>UPX</b> *instead* of <b>strip</b>. strip has the very bad habit of  replacing
       your  stub  with its own (outdated) version.  Additionally <b>UPX</b> corrects a bug/feature in strip v2.8.x: it
       will fix the 4 KiB alignment of the stub.

       <b>UPX</b> includes the full functionality of stubify. This means it will automatically stubify your COFF files.
       Use the option <b>--coff</b> to disable this functionality (see below).

       <b>UPX</b> automatically handles Allegro packfiles.

       The DLM format (a rather exotic shared library extension) is not supported.

       Packed programs will be byte-identical to the original after uncompression.  All  debug  information  and
       trailing garbage will be stripped, though.

       Extra options available for this executable format:

         --coff              Produce COFF output instead of EXE. By default
                             UPX keeps your current stub.

         --all-methods       Compress the program several times, using all
                             available compression methods. This may improve
                             the compression ratio in some cases, but usually
                             the default method gives the best results anyway.

         --all-filters       Compress the program several times, using all
                             available preprocessing filters. This may improve
                             the compression ratio in some cases, but usually
                             the default filter gives the best results anyway.

   <b>NOTES</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>LINUX</b> <b>[general]</b>
       Introduction

         Linux/386 support in UPX consists of 3 different executable formats,
         one optimized for ELF executables ("linux/elf386"), one optimized
         for shell scripts ("linux/sh386"), and one generic format
         ("linux/386").

         We will start with a general discussion first, but please
         also read the relevant docs for each of the individual formats.

         Also, there is special support for bootable kernels - see the
         description of the vmlinuz/386 format.

       General user's overview

         Running a compressed executable program trades less space on a
         ``permanent'' storage medium (such as a hard disk, floppy disk,
         CD-ROM, flash memory, EPROM, etc.) for more space in one or more
         ``temporary'' storage media (such as RAM, swap space, <a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a>, etc.).
         Running a compressed executable also requires some additional CPU
         cycles to generate the compressed executable in the first place,
         and to decompress it at each invocation.

         How much space is traded?  It depends on the executable, but many
         programs save 30% to 50% of permanent disk space.  How much CPU
         overhead is there?  Again, it depends on the executable, but
         decompression speed generally is at least many megabytes per second,
         and frequently is limited by the speed of the underlying disk
         or network I/O.

         Depending on the statistics of usage and access, and the relative
         speeds of CPU, RAM, swap space, <a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a>, and file system storage, then
         invoking and running a compressed executable can be faster than
         directly running the corresponding uncompressed program.
         The operating system might perform fewer expensive I/O operations
         to invoke the compressed program.  Paging to or from swap space
         or <a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a> might be faster than paging from the general file system.
         ``Medium-sized'' programs which access about 1/3 to 1/2 of their
         stored program bytes can do particularly well with compression.
         Small programs tend not to benefit as much because the absolute
         savings is less.  Big programs tend not to benefit proportionally
         because each invocation may use only a small fraction of the program,
         yet UPX decompresses the entire program before invoking it.
         But in environments where disk or flash memory storage is limited,
         then compression may win anyway.

         Currently, executables compressed by UPX do not share RAM at runtime
         in the way that executables mapped from a file system do.  As a
         result, if the same program is run simultaneously by more than one
         process, then using the compressed version will require more RAM and/or
         swap space.  So, shell programs (bash, csh, etc.)  and ``make''
         might not be good candidates for compression.

         UPX recognizes three executable formats for Linux: Linux/elf386,
         Linux/sh386, and Linux/386.  Linux/386 is the most generic format;
         it accommodates any file that can be executed.  At runtime, the UPX
         decompression stub re-creates in <a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a> a copy of the original file,
         and then the copy is (re-)executed with the same arguments.
         ELF binary executables prefer the Linux/elf386 format by default,
         because UPX decompresses them directly into RAM, uses only one
         exec, does not use space in <a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a>, and does not use /proc.
         Shell scripts where the underlying shell accepts a ``-c'' argument
         can use the Linux/sh386 format.  UPX decompresses the shell script
         into low memory, then maps the shell and passes the entire text of the
         script as an argument with a leading ``-c''.

       General benefits:

         - UPX can compress all executables, be it AOUT, ELF, libc4, libc5,
           libc6, Shell/Perl/Python/... scripts, standalone Java .class
           binaries, or whatever...
           All scripts and programs will work just as before.

         - Compressed programs are completely self-contained. No need for
           any external program.

         - UPX keeps your original program untouched. This means that
           after decompression you will have a byte-identical version,
           and you can use UPX as a file compressor just like gzip.
           [ Note that UPX maintains a checksum of the file internally,
             so it is indeed a reliable alternative. ]

         - As the stub only uses syscalls and isn't linked against libc it
           should run under any Linux configuration that can run ELF
           binaries.

         - For the same reason compressed executables should run under
           FreeBSD and other systems which can run Linux binaries.
           [ Please send feedback on this topic ]

       General drawbacks:

         - It is not advisable to compress programs which usually have many
           instances running (like `sh' or `make') because the common segments of
           compressed programs won't be shared any longer between different
           processes.

         - `ldd' and `size' won't show anything useful because all they
           see is the statically linked stub.  Since version 0.82 the section
           headers are stripped from the UPX stub and `size' doesn't even
           recognize the file format.  The file patches/patch-elfcode.h has a
           patch to fix this bug in `size' and other programs which use GNU BFD.

       General notes:

         - As UPX leaves your original program untouched it is advantageous
           to strip it before compression.

         - If you compress a script you will lose platform independence -
           this could be a problem if you are using NFS mounted disks.

         - Compression of suid, guid and sticky-bit programs is rejected
           because of possible security implications.

         - For the same reason there is no sense in making any compressed
           program suid.

         - Obviously UPX won't work with executables that want to read data
           from themselves. E.g., this might be a problem for Perl scripts
           which access their __DATA__ lines.

         - In case of internal errors the stub will abort with exitcode 127.
           Typical reasons for this to happen are that the program has somehow
           been modified after compression.
           Running `strace -o strace.log compressed_file' will tell you more.

   <b>NOTES</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>LINUX/ELF386</b>
       Please read the general Linux description first.

       The  linux/elf386  format decompresses directly into RAM, uses only one exec, does not use space in <a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a>,
       and does not use /proc.

       Linux/elf386 is automatically selected for Linux ELF executables.

       Packed programs will be byte-identical to the original after uncompression.

       How it works:

         For ELF executables, UPX decompresses directly to memory, simulating
         the mapping that the operating system kernel uses during exec(),
         including the PT_INTERP program interpreter (if any).
         The brk() is set by a special PT_LOAD segment in the compressed
         executable itself.  UPX then wipes the stack clean except for
         arguments, environment variables, and Elf_auxv entries (this is
         required by bugs in the startup code of /lib/ld-linux.so as of
         May 2000), and transfers control to the program interpreter or
         the e_entry address of the original executable.

         The UPX stub is about 1700 bytes long, partly written in assembler
         and only uses kernel syscalls. It is not linked against any libc.

       Specific drawbacks:

         - For linux/elf386 and linux/sh386 formats, you will be relying on
           RAM and swap space to hold all of the decompressed program during
           the lifetime of the process.  If you already use most of your swap
           space, then you may run out.  A system that is "out of memory"
           can become fragile.  Many programs do not react gracefully when
           malloc() returns 0.  With newer Linux kernels, the kernel
           may decide to kill some processes to regain memory, and you
           may not like the kernel's choice of which to kill.  Running
           <a href="file:///usr/lib/w3m/cgi-bin/w3mman2html.cgi?top">/usr/bin/top</a> is one way to check on the usage of swap space.

   <b>NOTES</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>LINUX/SH386</b>
       Please read the general Linux description first.

       Shell scripts where the underling shell accepts a ``-c'' argument can use the  Linux/sh386  format.   <b>UPX</b>
       decompresses  the  shell  script  into  low memory, then maps the shell and passes the entire text of the
       script as an argument with a leading ``-c''.  It does not use space in <a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a>, and does not use /proc.

       Linux/sh386 is automatically selected for shell scripts that use a known shell.

       Packed programs will be byte-identical to the original after uncompression.

       How it works:

         For shell script executables (files beginning with "#!/" or "#! /")
         where the shell is known to accept "-c &lt;command&gt;", UPX decompresses
         the file into low memory, then maps the shell (and its PT_INTERP),
         and passes control to the shell with the entire decompressed file
         as the argument after "-c".  Known shells are sh, ash, bash, bsh, csh,
         ksh, tcsh, pdksh.  Restriction: UPX cannot use this method
         for shell scripts which use the one optional string argument after
         the shell name in the script (example: "#! <a href="file:/bin/sh">/bin/sh</a> option3\n".)

   <b>NOTES</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>LINUX/386</b>
       Please read the general Linux description first.

       The generic linux/386 format decompresses to <a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a> and needs <a href="file:/proc">/proc</a> file  system  support.  It  starts  the
       decompressed program via the <b>execve()</b> syscall.

       Linux/386 is only selected if the specialized linux/elf386 and linux/sh386 won't recognize a file.

       Packed programs will be byte-identical to the original after uncompression.

       How it works:

         For files which are not ELF and not a script for a known "-c" shell,
         UPX uses kernel execve(), which first requires decompressing to a
         temporary file in the file system.  Interestingly -
         because of the good memory management of the Linux kernel - this
         often does not introduce a noticeable delay, and in fact there
         will be no disk access at all if you have enough free memory as
         the entire process takes places within the file system buffers.

         A compressed executable consists of the UPX stub and an overlay
         which contains the original program in a compressed form.

         The UPX stub is a statically linked ELF executable and does
         the following at program startup:

           1) decompress the overlay to a temporary location in <a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a>
           2) open the temporary file for reading
           3) try to delete the temporary file and start (execve)
              the uncompressed program in <a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a> using <a href="file:/proc/">/proc/</a>&lt;pid&gt;/fd/X as
              attained by step 2)
           4) if that fails, fork off a subprocess to clean up and
              start the program in <a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a> in the meantime

         The UPX stub is about 1700 bytes long, partly written in assembler
         and only uses kernel syscalls. It is not linked against any libc.

       Specific drawbacks:

         - You need additional free disk space for the uncompressed program
           in your <a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a> directory. This program is deleted immediately after
           decompression, but you still need it for the full execution time
           of the program.

         - You must have <a href="file:/proc">/proc</a> file system support as the stub wants to open
           <a href="file:/proc/">/proc/</a>&lt;pid&gt;/exe and needs <a href="file:/proc/">/proc/</a>&lt;pid&gt;/fd/X. This also means that you
           cannot compress programs that are used during the boot sequence
           before <a href="file:/proc">/proc</a> is mounted.

         - Utilities like `top' will display numerical values in the process
           name field. This is because Linux computes the process name from
           the first argument of the last execve syscall (which is typically
           something like <a href="file:/proc/">/proc/</a>&lt;pid&gt;/fd/3).

         - Because of temporary decompression to disk the decompression speed
           is not as fast as with the other executable formats. Still, I can see
           no noticeable delay when starting programs like my ~3 MiB emacs (which
           is less than 1 MiB when compressed :-).

       Extra options available for this executable format:

         --force-execve      Force the use of the generic linux/386 "execve"
                             format, i.e. do not try the linux/elf386 and
                             linux/sh386 formats.

   <b>NOTES</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>PS1/EXE</b>
       This  is  the  executable  format used by the Sony PlayStation (PSone), a MIPS R3000 based gaming console
       which is popular since the late '90s.  Support of this format is very similar to the Atari  one,  because
       of nostalgic feelings of one of the authors.

       Packed programs will be byte-identical to the original after uncompression, until further notice.

       Maximum uncompressed size: ~1.89 / ~7.60 MiB.

       Notes:

         - UPX creates as default a suitable executable for CD-Mastering
           and console transfer. For a CD-Master main executable you could also try
           the special option "--boot-only" as described below.
           It has been reported that upx packed executables are fully compatible with
           the Sony PlayStation 2 (PS2, PStwo) and Sony PlayStation Portable (PSP) in
           Sony PlayStation (PSone) emulation mode.

         - Normally the packed files use the same memory areas like the uncompressed
           versions, so they will not override other memory areas while unpacking.
           If this isn't possible UPX will abort showing a 'packed data overlap'
           error. With the "--force" option UPX will relocate the loading address
           for the packed file, but this isn't a real problem if it is a single or
           the main executable.

       Extra options available for this executable format:

         --all-methods       Compress the program several times, using all
                             available compression methods. This may improve
                             the compression ratio in some cases, but usually
                             the default method gives the best results anyway.

         --8-bit             Uses 8 bit size compression [default: 32 bit]

         --8mib-ram          PSone has 8 MiB ram available [default: 2 MiB]

         --boot-only         This format is for main exes and CD-Mastering only !
                             It may slightly improve the compression ratio,
                             decompression routines are faster than default ones.
                             But it cannot be used for console transfer !

         --no-align          This option disables CD mode 2 data sector format
                             alignment. May slightly improves the compression ratio,
                             but the compressed executable will not boot from a CD.
                             Use it for console transfer only !

         --all-filters       Compress the program several times, using all
                             available preprocessing filters. This may improve
                             the compression ratio in some cases, but usually
                             the default filter gives the best results anyway.

   <b>NOTES</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>VMLINUZ/386</b>
       The  vmlinuz/386  and bvmlinuz/386 formats take a gzip-compressed bootable Linux kernel image ("vmlinuz",
       "zImage", "bzImage"), gzip-decompress it and re-compress it with the <b>UPX</b> compression method.

       vmlinuz/386 is completely unrelated to the other Linux executable formats, and it does not share  any  of
       their drawbacks.

       Notes:

         - Be sure that "vmlinuz/386" or "bvmlinuz/386" is displayed
         during compression - otherwise a wrong executable format
         may have been used, and the kernel won't boot.

       Benefits:

         - Better compression (but note that the kernel was already compressed,
         so the improvement is not as large as with other formats).
         Still, the bytes saved may be essential for special needs like
         boot disks.

            For example, this is what I get for my 2.2.16 kernel:
               1589708  vmlinux
                641073  bzImage        [original]
                560755  bzImage.upx    [compressed by "upx -9"]

         - Much faster decompression at kernel boot time (but kernel
           decompression speed is not really an issue these days).

   <b>NOTES</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>WATCOM/LE</b>
       <b>UPX</b> has been successfully tested with the following extenders:
         DOS4G, DOS4GW, PMODE/W, DOS32a, CauseWay.
         The WDOS/X extender is partly supported (for details
         see the file bugs BUGS).

       DLLs and the LX format are not supported.

       Extra options available for this executable format:

         --le                Produce an unbound LE output instead of
                             keeping the current stub.

   <b>NOTES</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>WIN32/PE</b>
       The  PE support in <b>UPX</b> is quite stable now, but probably there are still some incompatibilities with some
       files.

       Because of the way <b>UPX</b> (and other packers for this format) works, you can see increased memory  usage  of
       your  compressed  files because the whole program is loaded into memory at startup.  If you start several
       instances of huge compressed programs you're wasting memory because the common segments  of  the  program
       won't get shared across the instances.  On the other hand if you're compressing only smaller programs, or
       running only one instance of larger programs, then this penalty is smaller, but it's still there.

       If  you're  running executables from network, then compressed programs will load faster, and require less
       bandwidth during execution.

       DLLs are supported. But UPX compressed DLLs can not share common data and code  when  they  got  used  by
       multiple applications. So compressing msvcrt.dll is a waste of memory, but compressing the dll plugins of
       a particular application may be a better idea.

       Screensavers  are supported, with the restriction that the filename must end with ".scr" (as screensavers
       are handled slightly different than normal exe files).

       UPX compressed PE files have some minor memory overhead (usually in the 10 - 30 KiB range) which  can  be
       seen by specifying the "-i" command line switch during compression.

       Extra options available for this executable format:

        --compress-exports=0 Don't compress the export section.
                             Use this if you plan to run the compressed
                             program under Wine.
        --compress-exports=1 Compress the export section. [DEFAULT]
                             Compression of the export section can improve the
                             compression ratio quite a bit but may not work
                             with all programs (like winword.exe).
                             UPX never compresses the export section of a DLL
                             regardless of this option.

         --compress-icons=0  Don't compress any icons.
         --compress-icons=1  Compress all but the first icon.
         --compress-icons=2  Compress all icons which are not in the
                             first icon directory. [DEFAULT]
         --compress-icons=3  Compress all icons.

         --compress-resources=0  Don't compress any resources at all.

         --keep-resource=list Don't compress resources specified by the list.
                             The members of the list are separated by commas.
                             A list member has the following format: I&lt;type[/name]&gt;.
                             I&lt;Type&gt; is the type of the resource. Standard types
                             must be specified as decimal numbers, user types can be
                             specified by decimal IDs or strings. I&lt;Name&gt; is the
                             identifier of the resource. It can be a decimal number
                             or a string. For example:

                             --keep-resource=2/MYBITMAP,5,6/12345

                             UPX won't compress the named bitmap resource "MYBITMAP",
                             it leaves every dialog (5) resource uncompressed, and
                             it won't touch the string table resource with identifier
                             12345.

         --force             Force compression even when there is an
                             unexpected value in a header field.
                             Use with care.

         --strip-relocs=0    Don't strip relocation records.
         --strip-relocs=1    Strip relocation records. [DEFAULT]
                             This option only works on executables with base
                             address greater or equal to 0x400000. Usually the
                             compressed files becomes smaller, but some files
                             may become larger. Note that the resulting file will
                             not work under Windows 3.x (Win32s).
                             UPX never strips relocations from a DLL
                             regardless of this option.

         --all-methods       Compress the program several times, using all
                             available compression methods. This may improve
                             the compression ratio in some cases, but usually
                             the default method gives the best results anyway.

         --all-filters       Compress the program several times, using all
                             available preprocessing filters. This may improve
                             the compression ratio in some cases, but usually
                             the default filter gives the best results anyway.
