</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       <b>bruteforce-wallet</b> - try to find the password of an encrypted wallet file

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>bruteforce-wallet</b> [<u>options</u>] &lt;filename&gt;

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>bruteforce-wallet</b> try to find the password of an encrypted Peercoin (or Bitcoin, Litecoin, etc...) wallet
       file.  It can be used in two ways:

              •  Try all possible passwords given a charset.

              •  Try all passwords in a file (dictionary).

       <b>bruteforce-wallet</b> have the following features:

              •  You can specify the number of threads to use when cracking a file.

              •  Sending  a  USR1  signal  to  a  running  <b>bruteforce-wallet</b> process makes it print progress and
                 continue.

              •  There are an exhaustive mode and a dictionary mode.

       In the exhaustive mode the program tries to decrypt one of the  encrypted  addresses  in  the  wallet  by
       trying  all  the  possible  passwords.   It is especially useful if you know something about the password
       (i.e. you forgot a part of your password but still remember most of  it).   Finding  the  password  of  a
       wallet  without  knowing  anything  about  it would take way too much time (unless the password is really
       short and/or weak).  There are some command line <u>options</u> to specify:

              •  The minimum password length to try.

              •  The maximum password length to try.

              •  The beginning of the password.

              •  The end of the password.

              •  The character set to use (among the characters of the current locale).

       In dictionary mode the program tries to decrypt one of the encrypted addresses in the  wallet  by  trying
       all the passwords contained in a file.  The file must have one password per line.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-b</b> <b>&lt;string&gt;</b>
              Beginning of the password. The default value is "".

       <b>-e</b> <b>&lt;string&gt;</b>
              End of the password. Default: "".

       <b>-f</b> <b>&lt;file&gt;</b>
              Read the passwords from a file instead of generating them.

       <b>-h</b>     Show help and quit.

       <b>-l</b> <b>&lt;length&gt;</b>
              Minimum password length (beginning and end included). Default: 1.

       <b>-m</b> <b>&lt;length&gt;</b>
              Maximum password length (beginning and end included). Default: 8.

       <b>-s</b> <b>&lt;string&gt;</b>
              Password             character             set.             Default            value            is
              "0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"

       <b>-t</b> <b>&lt;n&gt;</b> Number of threads to use. Default: 1.

       <b>-v</b> <b>&lt;n&gt;</b> Print progress info every n seconds.

       <b>-w</b> <b>&lt;file&gt;</b>
              Restore the state of a previous session if the file exists, then  write  the  state  to  the  file
              regularly (~ every minute).

       Note:  Sending  a  USR1  signal  to  a  running <b>bruteforce-wallet</b> process makes it print progress info to
       standard error and continue.

</pre><h4><b>LIMITATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The program currently only works on unix-like POSIX systems  (e.g.  GNU/Linux).   Different  versions  of
       BerkeleyDB are usually not compatible with each other.  Therefore, for the program to work, you will have
       to  check  that  the  BerkeleyDB  version  you are using can read the databases created by the BerkeleyDB
       version your wallet was created with.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Try to find the password of an encrypted wallet file using  4  threads,  trying  only  passwords  with  5
       characters:

           $ bruteforce-wallet -t 4 -l 5 -m 5 wallet.dat

       Try  to find the password of an encrypted wallet file using 8 threads, trying only passwords with 5 to 10
       characters beginning with "W4l" and ending with "z":

           $ bruteforce-wallet -t 8 -l 5 -m 10 -b "W4l" -e "z" wallet.dat

       Try to find the password of an encrypted wallet file using 8  threads,  trying  only  passwords  with  10
       characters using the character set "P情8ŭ":

           $ bruteforce-wallet -t 8 -l 10 -m 10 -s "P情8ŭ" wallet.dat

       Try to find the password of an encrypted wallet file using 6 threads, trying the passwords contained in a
       dictionary file:

           $ bruteforce-wallet -t 6 -f dictionary.txt wallet.dat

       Print progress info:

           $ pkill -USR1 -f bruteforce-wallet

       Print progress info every 30 seconds:

           $ bruteforce-wallet -t 6 -f dictionary.txt -v 30 wallet.dat

       Save/restore state between sessions:

           $ bruteforce-wallet -t 6 -f dictionary.txt -w state.txt wallet.dat

           (Let the program run for a few minutes and stop it)

           $ bruteforce-wallet -t 6 -w state.txt wallet.dat
