</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       mayavi2 - A scientific visualization package for 2-D and 3-D data

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>mayavi2</b> <b>[options]</b> <b>[args]</b>

       Where  arg1,  arg2  etc.  are  optional  file  names  that  correspond  to  saved  Mayavi2 visualizations
       (filename.mv2),  Mayavi2 scripts (filename.py) and any data file formats that Mayavi supports.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Mayavi2 is a tool for 2-D and 3-D scientific visualization. Features of Mayavi2 include:

       *      Visualization of scalar and vector data in 2 and 3 dimensions

       *      Easy scriptability using Python

       *      Easy extendability via sources, components, modules, and data filters

       *      Reading several file formats: VTK (legacy and XML), PLOT3D, etc.

       *      Saving of visualizations

       *      Saving rendered visualization in a variety of image formats.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-h</b>

       This prints all the available command line options and exits.  Also available through <b>--help</b>.

       <b>-V</b>

       This prints the Mayavi version on the command line and exits.  Also available through <b>--version</b>.

       <b>-z</b> <b>filename.mv2</b>

       This loads a previously saved Mayavi2  visualization.   Also  available  through  <b>--viz</b>  filename.mv2  or
       <b>--visualization</b> filename.mv2.

       <b>-d</b> datafile.*

       Opens  any  of the supported data file formats or a non-file related data source.  This includes VTK file
       formats (*.vtk, *.xml, *.vt[i,p,r,s,u], *.pvt[i,p,r,s,u]),  VRML2  (*.wrl),  3D  Studio  (*.3ds),  PLOT3D
       (*.xyz),  STL, BYU, RAW, PLY, PDB, SLC, FACET, OBJ, AVSUCD (*.inp), GAMBIT (*.neu), Exodus (*.exii), PNG,
       JPEG, BMP, PNM, DCM, DEM, MHA, MHD, MINC, XIMG, TIFF, and various others that are supported.   datafile.*
       can  also  be a source object not associated with a file, for example ParametricSurface or PointLoad will
       load the corresponding data sources into Mayavi.  Also available through <b>--data</b>.

       <b>-m</b> module-name

       A module is an object that actually visualizes the data.  The given module-name is loaded in the  current
       ModuleManager.  The module name must be a valid one if not you will get an error message.

       If a module is specified as 'package.sub.module.SomeModule' then the module (SomeModule) is imported from
       'package.sub.module'.   Standard  modules  provided with mayavi2 do not need the full path specification.
       For example:

              mayavi2 -d data.vtk -m Outline -m m2_user_modules.TestModule

       In this example 'Outline' is a standard module and  'm2_user_modules.TestModule'  is  some  user  defined
       module.   See  <b>MAYAVI2</b> <b>MODULES</b> section below for an exhaustive list of available modules.  Also available
       through <b>--module</b>.

       <b>-f</b> filter-name

       A filter is an object that filters out the data in some way or  the  other.   The  given  filter-name  is
       loaded  with respect to the current source/filter object.  The filter name must be a valid one if not you
       will get an error message.

       If the filter is specified as 'package.sub.filter.SomeFilter' then the filter (`SomeFilter`) is  imported
       from   'package.sub.filter'.   Standard  modules  provided  with  mayavi2  do  not  need  the  full  path
       specification.  For example:

              mayavi2 -d data.vtk -f ExtractVectorNorm -f m2_user_filters.TestFilter

       In this example 'ExtractVectorNorm' is a standard filter and 'm2_user_filters.TestFilter'  is  some  user
       defined filter.

       See  <b>MAYAVI2</b>  <b>FILTERS</b>  section  below for an exhaustive list of available filters. Also available through
       <b>--filter</b>.

       <b>-M</b>

       Starts up a new module manager on the Mayavi pipeline. Also available through <b>--module-mgr</b>.

       <b>-n</b>

       Creates a new window/scene. Any options passed after this will apply to this newly created  scene.   Also
       available through <b>--new-window</b>.

       <b>-t</b>

       Runs  the  mayavi2  test suite and exits.  If run as such, this runs both the TVTK and Mayavi2 unittests.
       If any additional arguments are passed they are passed along to the test runner.  So this may be used  to
       run other tests as well.  For example:

              mayavi2 -t enthought.persistence

       This  will run just the tests inside the enthought.persistence package.  You can also specify a directory
       with test files to run with this, for example:

              mayavi2 -t relative_path_to/integrationtests/mayavi

       will run the integration tests from the mayavi sources.   Also available through <b>--test</b>.

       <b>-x</b> script-file

       This executes the given script in a namespace where we guarantee  that  the  name  'mayavi'  is  Mayavi's
       script instance -- just like in the embedded Python interpreter.  Also available through <b>--exec</b>

       <b>WARNING:</b>  Note  that  this  uses `execfile`, so please note that this can be dangerous if the script does
       something nasty!

       <b>-s</b> python-expression

       Execute the expression on the last created object.  For example, if the previous object was a module, and
       we want to set the color of that object one can do -s "actor.property.color = (1,0,0)".  One  should  use
       quotes for the expression. Also available with <b>--set</b>.  For example:

               mayavi2 -d ParametricSurface -m Outline \
                -s "actor.property.color = (1,0,0)" \
                -s "scene.save('test.png', size=(800, 800))"

       <b>WARNING:</b> Note that this uses `exec`, so please note that this can be dangerous!

              contours of the data.

       <b>CustomGridPlane</b>
              A custom grid plane with a lot more flexibility than GridPlane module.

       <b>DataSetClipper</b>
              This filter clips the dataset in a area.  The area can  be  defined  interactively  as  a  box,  a
              sphere...

              A module that integrates through a tensor field to generate a hyperstreamline. The integration  is
              along  the  maximum eigenvector and the cross section of the hyperstreamline is defined by the two
              other eigenvectors. Thus the shape of the hyperstreamline is "tube-like", with the  cross  section
              being elliptical. Hyperstreamlines are used to visualize tensor fields.

       <b>ImageActor</b>
              A simple module to view image data efficiently.

       <b>ImagePlaneWidget</b>
              A simple module to view image data.

              marks the orientation of the scene. Requires VTK-4.5 and above.

       <b>Outline</b>
              A module that draws an outline for the given data.

       <b>ScalarCutPlane</b>
              Takes a cut plane of any input data set using an implicit plane and plots the data  with  optional
              contouring and scalar warping.

       <b>SliceUnstructuredGrid</b>
              This  module  takes  a  slice  of the unstructured grid data and shows the cells that intersect or
              touch the slice.

       <b>Streamline</b>
              Allows the user to draw streamlines for given vector data. This supports  various  types  of  seed
              objects  (line,  sphere,  plane and point seeds). It also allows the user to draw ribbons or tubes
              and further supports different types of interactive modes of calculating the streamlines.

       <b>StructuredGridOutline</b>
              Draws a grid-conforming outline for structured grids.

       <b>VectorCutPlane</b>
              Takes an arbitrary slice of the input data using an implicit cut plane and places glyphs according
              to the vector field data. The glyphs may be colored using  either  the  vector  magnitude  or  the
              scalar attributes.

       <b>Vectors</b>
              Displays  different  types  of glyphs oriented and colored as per vector data at the input points.
              This is merely a convenience module that is entirely based on the Glyph module.

       <b>Volume</b> The Volume module visualizes scalar fields using volumetric visualization techniques.

       <b>WarpVectorCutPlane</b>
              Takes an arbitrary slice of the input data using an implicit cut plane and warps it  according  to
              the vector field data. The scalars are displayed on the warped surface as colors.

</pre><h4><b>MAYAVI2</b> <b>FILTERS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>CellDerivatives</b>
              Computes  derivatives  from  input  point  scalar  and  vector  data and produces cell data on the
              gradients.  Can be used to approximately calcuate the vorticity for example.

       <b>CellToPointData</b>
              Transforms cell attribute data to point data by averaging the cell data  from  the  cells  at  the
              point.

       <b>Contour</b>
              A  contour  filter  that  wraps around the Contour component to generate iso-surfaces on any input
              dataset.

       <b>CutPlane</b>
              This class represents a cut plane that can be used to slice through any dataset.  It also provides
              a 3D widget interface to position and move the slice interactively.

       <b>ElevationFilter</b>
              Creates scalar data corresponding to the elevation of the points along a line.

       <b>Delaunay2D</b>
              Performs a 2D Delaunay triangulation.

       <b>Delaunay3D</b>
              Performs a 3D Delaunay triangulation.

       <b>ExtractEdges</b>
              This filter extracts cell edges from any input data.

       <b>ExtractGrid</b>
              Allows a user to select a part of a structured grid.

       <b>ExtractTensorComponents</b>
              Wraps the TVTK ExtractTensorComponents filter to extract components from a tensor field.

       <b>ExtractUnstructuredGrid</b>
              Allows a user to select a part of an unstructured grid.

       <b>ExtractVectorNorm</b>
              Computes the norm (Eucliedean) of the input vector data (with optional scaling  between  [0,  1]).
              This  is  useful  when the input data has vector input but no scalar data for the magnitude of the
              vectors.

       <b>ExtractVectorComponents</b>
              Wraps the TVTK ExtractVectorComponents filter to extract components of a vector.  This  is  useful
              for analysing individual components of a vector data.

       <b>GaussianSplatter</b>
              This filter splat points into a volume with an elliptical, Gaussian distribution.

       <b>MaskPoints</b>
              Selectively  passes  the  input points downstream. This can be used to subsample the input points.
              Note that this does not pass geometry data, this means all grid information is lost.

       <b>GreedyTerrainDecimation</b>
              Approximates a height field (image data) with a triangle mesh, keeping  the  number  of  triangles
              minimum.

       <b>ImageChangeInformation</b>
              A  filter  that  can  be  used to change the origin, spacing and extents of an input image dataset
              without changing the data itself.

       <b>ImageDataProbe</b>
              A filter that can be used to probe any dataset using a Structured Points dataset.  The filter also
              allows one to convert the scalar data to an unsigned short array so that the scalars can  be  used
              for volume visualization.

       <b>PointToCellData</b>
              Does the inverse of the CellToPointData filter.

       <b>PolyDataNormals</b>
              Computes  normals  from  input data. This gives meshes a smoother appearance. This should work for
              any  input  dataset.  Note:  this  filter   is   called   "Compute   Normals"   in   Mayavi2   GUI
              (Visualize/Filters/Compute Normals).

       <b>QuadricDecimation</b>
              Reduce triangles in a mesh, forming a good approximation of the original mesh.

       <b>SelectOutput</b>
              A  filter that allows a user to select one among several of the outputs of a given input.  This is
              typically very useful for a multi-block data source.

       <b>SetActiveAttribute</b>
              This filter lets a user set the active data attribute (scalars, vectors  and  tensors)  on  a  VTK
              dataset.   This  is  particularly  useful if you need to do something like compute contours of one
              scalar on the contour of another scalar.

       <b>Stripper</b>
              Create triangle strips and/or poly-lines. Useful for regularizing  broken  up  surfaces,  such  as
              those created by the Tube filter.  .

       <b>Threshold</b>
              A simple filter that thresholds on input data.

       <b>TransformData</b>
              Performs a linear transformation to input data.

       <b>TriangleFilter</b>
              Converts  input  polygons  and  triangle  strips to triangles using the tvtk.TriangleFilter class.
              This is useful when you have a downstream filter that only processes triangles.

       <b>Tube</b>   Turns lines into tubes.

       <b>UserDefined</b>
              This filter lets  the  user  define  their  own  filter  dynamically/interactively.   It  is  like
              FilterBase but allows a user to specify the class without writing any code.

       <b>Vorticity</b>
              This  filter  computes the vorticity of an input vector field.  For convenience, the filter allows
              one to optionally pass-through the given input vector field.  The filter also allows the  user  to
              show  the  component  of the vorticity along a particular cartesian co-ordinate axes.  It produces
              point data on output which is ready to visualize.

       <b>WarpScalar</b>
              Warps the input data along a particular direction (either the normals or  a  specified  direction)
              with a scale specified by the local scalar value. Useful for making carpet plots.

       <b>WarpVector</b>
              Warps  the input data along a the point vector attribute scaled as per a scale factor.  Useful for
              showing flow profiles or displacements.
