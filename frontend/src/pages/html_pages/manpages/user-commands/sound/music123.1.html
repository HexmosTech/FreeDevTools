</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       music123 - plays various sound files (usually including MP3, Ogg and Wav).

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>music123</b> [<b>-DhiLlqrvZz</b>] [<b>-d</b> <u>ARG</u>] [<b>-@</b> <u>ARG</u>] [<b>--</b>] <u>files</u> ...

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>music123</b>  is  a  shell  around  various  command  line  programs  to  play  music files.  It will descend
       directories trees with -r, and randomize file lists with -z. The programs used and the options given them
       are listed in /etc/music123rc or <a href="file:~/.music123rc.">~/.music123rc.</a>

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       -D     Equivalent to <b>-d0</b>.  May make music123 harder to kill.

       -d     Customize the time music123 delays between songs.  <b>-d</b> takes one argument,  expressed  in  seconds,
              which may have a fractional part.

       -h     Show command help and exit immediately.

       -i     Ignore case of file path extensions.  For example, <u>.ogg</u> and <u>.OGG</u> are considered equivalent.

       -l     Loop at the end of the playlist.

       -L     List files and exit immediately.

       -q     Quiet mode.  No messages are displayed.

       -r     Recurse into directories, instead of ignoring them.

       -T     Redirect standard input, allowing <u>q</u> or <u>Q</u> keys to stop after current file.  The player will not see
              its standard output anymore.

       -v     Display version information and exit immediately.

       -z     Randomize the song list once before starting to play.  music123 will shuffle the list once and for
              all, then play the songs without repetition (and repeat the selected order over and over with -l).

       -Z     Pick  up  a  song after the other randomly and endlessly, possibly playing a given song twice in a
              row, or never playing a given song.  This disables <u>-l</u> and <u>-z</u> options.

       -@     Play the files listed in the mandatory argument of -@.  Other files can be added  on  the  command
              line, and this option can be given several times.  Note that music123 doesn't yet play URLs.

       --     End  option  list.   Following  arguments are interpreted as file names, even if they start with a
              dash.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Play three songs:
              <b>music123</b> <b>test1.ogg</b> <b>test2.mp3</b> <b>test3.wav</b>

       Play a couple of directories and other songs at random:
              <b>music123</b> <b>-rz</b> <b>Rock/</b> <b>test1.ogg</b> <b>Pop/</b> <b>test4.wav</b>

       Play a playlist then a strange file name with a delay between the songs:
              <b>music123</b> <b>-d</b> <b>6.0</b> <b>-@playlist</b> <b>-âˆ’</b> <b>-strange.ogg</b>

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       /etc/music123rc
              Describes which programs <b>music123</b> uses, which files types it supports, and which options it passes
              those programs.

       <a href="file:~/.music123rc">~/.music123rc</a>
              Per-user config file to override the system wide settings.
