</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       gbsplay - Gameboy sound player

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>gbsplay</b> [<u>options</u>] <u>gbs-file</u> [<u>start-subsong</u> [<u>stop-subsong</u>] ]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>gbsplay</b>  emulates  the  sound  hardware  of  the  Nintendo Gameboy.  It is able to play the sounds from a
       Gameboy module dump (.GBS format) over <u>/dev/dsp</u> and other sound drivers.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-E</b> <u>endian</u>
              Set endianness to <u>endian</u>.  Valid values are  <b>b</b>,  <b>l</b>  and  <b>n</b>  for  big,  little  and  native  endian
              respectively.

       <b>-f</b> <u>fadeout-time</u>
              Set  fadeout  time  to  <u>fadeout-time</u>  seconds.  Instead of cutting the subsong off hard, do a soft
              fadeout.  Default value is 3 seconds.

       <b>-g</b> <u>subsong-gap</u>
              Set subsong gap to <u>subsong-gap</u> seconds.   Before  playing  the  next  subsong  after  the  subsong
              timeout, <u>subsong-gap</u> seconds of silence will be played.  Default value is 2 seconds.

       <b>-h</b>     Display short help and exit.

       <b>-H</b> <u>filter</u>
              Set  output high-pass type to <u>filter</u>.  Valid values are <b>dmg</b> (Gameboy Classic), <b>cgb</b> (Gameboy Color)
              and <b>off</b> (no filter).  Default value is dmg.

       <b>-l</b>     Enable loop mode.  After the last subsong has been played, playback starts again  with  the  first
              subsong.  Default is no loop.

       <b>-o</b> <u>plugin</u>
              Select  sound  output  plugin <u>plugin</u>.  Select <b>list</b> to view a list of all available output plugins.
              Default value depends on compilation options.

       <b>-q</b>     Be quieter, reduce verbosity.  Can be applied multiple times.  Default verbosity is 3.

       <b>-r</b> <u>samplerate</u>
              Set the samplerate to <u>samplerate</u> Hz.  Default value is 44100Hz.

       <b>-R</b> <u>refresh-delay</u>
              Set the refresh delay to <u>refresh-delay</u> milliseconds.  Larger values  will  lower  CPU  usage,  but
              things as subsong changes, fadeouts and reactions to XEvents will be delayed.  Default value is 33
              milliseconds.

       <b>-t</b> <u>subsong-timeout</u>
              Set  subsong  timeout  to  <u>subsong-timeout</u>  seconds.  When a subsong has been played for the given
              time, the player will skip to the next subsong.  A timeout of 0 seconds disables automatic subsong
              changes.  Default value is 120 seconds.

       <b>-T</b> <u>silence-timeout</u>
              Set silence timeout to <u>silence-timeout</u> seconds.  When a subsong contains  silence  for  the  given
              time, the player will skip to the next subsong.  Default value is 2 seconds.

       <b>-v</b>     Increase  verbosity, print more information.  Can be applied multiple times.  Default verbosity is
              3.

       <b>-V</b>     Display version number and exit.

       <b>-z</b>     Play subsongs in shuffle mode.  Every subsong will be played once in random order.

       <b>-Z</b>     Play subsongs in random mode.  Like shuffle mode (<u>-z</u>), but a subsong can be played multiple times.

       <b>-1</b>     Mute channel 1 on start.

       <b>-2</b>     Mute channel 2 on start.

       <b>-3</b>     Mute channel 3 on start.

       <b>-4</b>     Mute channel 4 on start.

       <u>gbs-file</u>
              The sound file to play.  Must be in uncompressed .GBS format.

       <u>start-subsong</u>
              The subsong from the sound file to play first.  If not specified, the default song declared in the
              sound file will be played unless shuffle (<u>-z</u>) or random mode (<u>-Z</u>) are  active.   An  out-of-bounds
              number will be clipped to the possible range of subsongs.

       <u>stop-subsong</u>
              <b>gbsplay</b> exits after this subsong has been played.  If not specified or out-of-bounds, <b>gbsplay</b> will
              exit after playing the last subsong, unless in loop mode (<u>-l</u>).

</pre><h4><b>OUTPUT</b> <b>PLUGINS</b></h4><pre>
       Output  plugins  are  sometimes called <u>plugouts</u> because that's shorter, so don't be confused.  Not all of
       the plugins listed here may be available, see `<u>gbsplay</u> <u>-o</u> <u>list</u>'.

       <b>alsa</b>   Use the ALSA sound driver for sound output.

       <b>altmidi</b>
              Alternative implementation of the MIDI  output  plugin  (see  <u>midi</u>  below).   Should  export  more
              accurate  note  off  events  (the length register is taken into account), but generated MIDI files
              will be more complicated and fine grained and probably not suitable  for  editing  or  printing  a
              score.

       <b>devdsp</b> Use the OSS sound driver for sound output via <u>/dev/dsp</u>.

       <b>dsound</b> Use the DirectSound sound driver for sound output on Microsoft Windows.

       <b>iodumper</b>
              Dump  IO  calls to the Gameboy sound hardware to stdout.  This reduces the verbosity to 0 (see <u>-q</u>)
              because stdout is used for the dumped data.

       <b>midi</b>   Write a simple MIDI conversion of the song into a separate file per subsong.  The files are called
              <u>gbsplay-%d.mid</u>, where <u>%d</u> is replaced with the subsong  number.   The  files  are  created  in  the
              current  working  directory and existing files are silently overwritten.  Only channels 1 to 3 are
              converted to MIDI, because channel 4 contains noise data that can't be converted  into  MIDI  note
              events.   Every  GBS channel is exported to a separate MIDI channel.  When multiple voices share a
              channel, they will not be separated in the output.  The conversion is rather basic and complicated
              GBS files using tricks and hacks will not be converted properly.

       <b>nas</b>    Use the NAS sound driver for sound output to a Network Audio Server.

       <b>pipewire</b>
              Use the PipeWire sound driver for sound output.

       <b>pulse</b>  Use the Pulseaudio sound driver for sound output.

       <b>sdl</b>    Use SDL sound driver for sound output.  On Microsoft Windows, libSDL might use  the  <u>wasapi</u>  audio
              backend  by  default  which can result in choppy sound.  To fix this, set the environment variable
              <u>SDL_AUDIODRIVER</u> to <u>directsound</u> to select a different libSDL audio backend (or switch to the <u>dsound</u>
              plugout instead).

       <b>stdout</b> Dump the raw audio stream to stdout.  This reduces the verbosity to 0 (see <u>-q</u>) because  stdout  is
              used for the dumped data.  The raw audio is always stereo (2 channels), 16 bit signed PCM.  Sample
              rate and endianness can be set via <u>-r</u> and <u>-E</u>.

       <b>vgm</b>    Write  separate  VGM  files  for  every subsong.  The files are called <u>gbsplay-%d.vgm</u>, where <u>%d</u> is
              replaced with the subsong number.  The files are created in  the  current  working  directory  and
              existing files are silently overwritten.

       <b>wav</b>    Write  separate  WAV  files  (RIFF  WAVE) for every subsong.  The files are called <u>gbsplay-%d.wav</u>,
              where <u>%d</u> is replaced with the subsong number.  The  files  are  created  in  the  current  working
              directory  and existing files are silently overwritten.  The output is always encoded as stereo (2
              channels), 16 bit signed PCM in little endian (the <u>-E</u> switch is ignored).  Sample rate can be  set
              via <u>-r</u>.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <u>/etc/gbsplayrc</u>
              Default location of the global configuration file.
