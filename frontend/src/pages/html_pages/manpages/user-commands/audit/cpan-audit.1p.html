</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       "cpan-audit" is a command line application that checks the modules or distributions for known
       vulnerabilities. It is using its internal database that is automatically generated from a hand-picked
       database &lt;https://github.com/briandfoy/cpan-security-advisory&gt;.

       "cpan-audit" does not connect to anything, that is why it is important to keep it up to date. Every
       update of the internal database is released as a new version. Ensure that you have the latest database by
       updating CPAN::Audit frequently; the database can change daily.  You can use enable a warning for a
       possibly out-of-date database by adding "--fresh", which warns if the database version is older than a
       month:

               % cpan-audit --fresh ...
               % cpan-audit -f ...

               % env CPAN_AUDIT_FRESH_DAYS=7 cpan-audit -f ...

   <b>Finding</b> <b>dependencies</b>
       "cpan-audit" can automatically detect dependencies from the following sources:

       "Carton"
           Parses <u>cpanfile.snapshot</u> file and checks the distribution versions.

       <u>cpanfile</u>
           Parses <u>cpanfile</u> taking into account the required versions.

       It is assumed that if the required version of the module is less than a version of a release with a known
       vulnerability fix, then the module is considered affected.

   <b>JSON</b> <b>data</b>
       If you request JSON output, the data looks like:

           {
             "meta" : {
                 ... meta information ...
             "dists": {
               "&lt;distribution1&gt;": {
                 ... distribution info ...
               }
             }
             "errors" : [
               ... list of errors - if any ...
             ]
           }

       <u>Meta</u> <u>information</u>

       The meta data contains information about the run of "cpan-audit".

           {
             "args": [
               "Mojo::File",
               "Mojo::UserAgent",
               "LWP::UserAgent"
             ],
             "cpan_audit": {
               "version": "20230601.002"
             },
             "total_advisories": 19,
             "command": "modules"
           }

       These information are shown:

       •   cpan_audit

           The version of "cpan_audit" that is used for the audit

       •   command

           The command of "cpan_audit" that was run

       •   args

           Arguments for the command

       •   total_advisories

           Number of found advisories

       <u>Distribution</u> <u>information</u>

       For each distribution where at least one advisory was found, the JSON looks like:

           "Dist-Name": {
             "queried_modules": [
               "Queried::Namespace"
             ],
             "version": "Any",
             "advisories": [
               {
                 ... advisory data as in the audit database ...
               },
                 ... more advisories ...
             ]
           },

       The advisory data is basically the data from the database. So this depends on what is known for the given
       advisory.

       The distribution information contains:

       •   version

           The version (range) that is checked for advisories. If there's no version specified, all versions are
           checked and the version is report as "Any".

       •   queried_modules

           The actual namespaces queried, either from the command line or another source, such as a <u>cpanfile</u>.

       •   advisories

           A list of all vulnerabilities found for the version range

   <b>Exit</b> <b>values</b>
       In  prior  versions,  "cpan-audit" exited with the number of advisories it found. Starting with 1.001, if
       there are advisories found, "cpan-audit" exits with 64 added  to  that  number.  The  maximum  number  of
       reported advisories is 62, since values over 126 are spoken for.

       If the option "--exit-zero" is set "cpan-audit" exits always with a normal exit code (0). This allows you
       to use "cpan-audit" in build environments together with bash exit mode activated ("set -e").

       •   0 - no advisories found

       •   2 - problem with program invocation, such as bad switches or values

       •   64+n - advisories found. Subtract 64 to get the advisory count, up to 62 advisories

       •   255 - unspecified program error
