</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       AuditVerify - Command-Line utility for verifying Certificate System signed audit logs.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>AuditVerify</b> <b>-d</b> <u>dbdir</u> <b>-n</b> <u>signing-cert-nickname</u> <b>-a</b> <u>logListFile</u> [<b>-P</b> <u>db-prefix</u>] [<b>-v</b>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>AuditVerify</b>  command provides command-line utility to verify that signed audit logs were signed with
       the appropriate PKI audit private signing key  and  that  the  audit  logs  have  not  been  compromised.
       Auditors can verify the authenticity and integrity of signed audit logs using the <b>AuditVerify</b> tool.  This
       tool  uses  the  public  key of the signed audit log signing certificate to verify the digital signatures
       embedded in a signed audit log file.  The tool result indicates either that  the  signed  audit  log  was
       successfully  verified  or  that  the  signed  audit  log was not successfully verified.  An unsuccessful
       verification warns the auditor that the signature failed to verify, indicating the log file may have been
       tampered with (compromised).

       <b>Note:</b> An auditor can be any user that has the privilege to peruse the PKI audit logs.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-d</b> <u>dbdir</u>
           Specifies the directory containing the  security  databases  with  the  imported  audit  log  signing
       certificate.
           This  directory  is  almost  always  the  auditor's  own personal certificate databases in a personal
       directory,
           such as $HOME/.dogtag/nssdb.

       <b>-n</b> <u>signing-cert-nickname</u>
           Gives the nickname of the certificate used to sign the log files.
           The nickname is whatever was used when the log signing certificate was imported into that database.

       <b>-P</b> <u>db-prefix</u>
           Optional. The prefix to prepend to the certificate and key database filenames.
           If used, a value of empty quotation marks (“”) should be specified for this argument,
           since the auditor is using separate certificate and key databases from the PKI server
           and it is unlikely that the prefix should be prepended to the new audit security database files.

       <b>-a</b> <u>logListFile</u>
           Specifies the file which contains the list of file paths (in chronological order)
           of the signed audit logs to be verified.
           The contents of the logListFile are the full paths to the audit logs.

       <b>-v</b>
           Optional. Specifies verbose output.

</pre><h4><b>Setting</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>Auditor's</b> <b>Database</b></h4><pre>
       <b>AuditVerify</b> needs access to a  set  of  security  databases  (usually  the  auditor's  personal  security
       databases)  containing  the  signed  audit log signing certificate and its chain of issuing certificates.
       One of the CA certificates in the issuance chain must be marked as trusted in the database.

       Auditors should import the audit signing certificate into  their  personal  certificate  database  before
       running  <b>AuditVerify</b>.   The auditor should not use the security databases of the PKI server instance that
       generated the signed audit log files.  If there are no readily accessible certificate and  key  database,
       the  auditor  must  create a set of certificate and key databases and import the signed audit log signing
       certificate chain.

       To create the security databases and import the certificate chain, create  a  special  directory  in  the
       auditor's home directory to use to perform the verification. For example:

              $ mkdir -p $HOME/.dogtag/nssdb

       Use the certutil tool to create an empty set of certificate databases in the auditor's home directory.

              $ certutil -N -d $HOME/.dogtag/nssdb

       Download  the  CA  certificate  from the CA's Retrieval page at https://server.example.com:8443/ca/ee/ca.
       The certificates can be obtained from the CA in ASCII format.

       Then import the CA certificate and log signing certificate into  the  databases  and  set  trust  of  the
       certificates.  If the CA certificate is in a file called cacert.pem and the log signing certificate is in
       a  file called logsigncert.pem, then the certutil can be used to set the trust for the new audit security
       database directory pointing to those files, as follows:

              $ certutil -A -d $HOME/.dogtag/nssdb -n "CA Certificate" -t "CT,CT,CT" -a -i cacert.pem
              $ certutil -A -d $HOME/.dogtag/nssdb -n "Log Signing Certificate" -t ",,P" -a -i logsigncert.pem

       <b>Note:</b> The signedAudit directory kept by the subsystem is not writeable by any user, including auditors.

</pre><h4><b>Operation</b></h4><pre>
       After a separate audit database directory has been configured, create a text file containing  a  list  of
       the  log  files  to  be  verified.   The name of this file is referenced in the <b>AuditVerify</b> command.  For
       example, this file could be logListFile.txt:

              /var/log/pki/pki-tomcat/ca/signedAudit/ca_audit.20030227102711
              /var/log/pki/pki-tomcat/ca/signedAudit/ca_audit.20030226094015
              /var/log/pki/pki-tomcat/ca/signedAudit/ca_audit

       Assuming the audit databases do not contain prefixes and are located in the user home directory, such  as
       $HOME/.dogtag/nssdb,  and  the signing certificate nickname is "Log Signing Certificate", the <b>AuditVerify</b>
       command is run as follows:

              $ AuditVerify -d $HOME/.dogtag/nssdb -n "Log Signing Certificate" -a logListFile.txt -P "" -v

       <b>Note:</b> It has been observed that if audit signing is enabled after system  is  first  started,  the  first
       audit  signature  would not be verified.  What happens is that the signature starts calculating from it's
       in-memory audit log message when it signs, and since log signing is turned on mid-way (not from  a  fresh
       new  log  file),  the  previous  content  were  not signed along for calculating the first signature (and
       rightfully so).  When <b>AuditVerify</b> is run, it does not know where the log signing begins, so it assumes it
       starts from the beginning of the file till the first signature.  This is  why  the  first  signature  (if
       signing is turned on mid-way) will always appear to be incorrect.
