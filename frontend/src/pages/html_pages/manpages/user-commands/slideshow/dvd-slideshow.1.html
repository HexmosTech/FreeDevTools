</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Creates  a  video from a bunch of images. The default video format is designed to produce DVDs, but other
       formats can be created for the web also (.flv).  You can add music on the command line  or  in  the  text
       input  file. Supports several effects like fadein, fadeout, crossfade, crop, and kenburns.  dvd-slideshow
       is designed to work with dvd-menu to create a dvd navigation menu that you can  then  burn  onto  a  dvd.
       There are also some helper scripts to convert a directory of pictures or your favorite online photo album
       to a dvd.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       [<b>-n</b> <b>&lt;Slideshow</b> <b>name&gt;</b>]
              The  program  uses this string as the filename base for the output files so you can distinguish it
              from other slideshows that you can send to the  same  output  directory.  If  not  specified,  the
              default value is the name of the input file.

       <b>[-f]</b> <b>&lt;Input</b> <b>text</b> <b>file&gt;</b>
              See the INPUT FILE section.

       [<b>-o</b> <b>&lt;Output</b> <b>directory&gt;</b>]
              Directory  where  the final .vob and dvdauthor .xml files will be written. Defaults to the current
              working directory.

       [<b>-b</b> <b>&lt;Background</b> <b>jpeg&gt;</b>]
              Image to use for the background of the slideshow. All of the pictures will be overlaid on  top  of
              this  background  image.  If no file is specified, black will be used for the slideshow and a blue
              gradient for the title slide.

       [<b>-a</b> <b>&lt;Audio</b> <b>file&gt;</b>]
              Audio file to play in background during the slideshow. It will be faded out at the end.   Supports
              mp3, ogg, or wav formats at this point.  Multiple files will be joined. See also the more flexible
              text file input method. To pass multiple files, use the -a switch again.

       [<b>-p</b>]   Use PAL output video format instead of NTSC.

       [<b>-mpeg2enc</b>]
              Force  use  of mpeg2enc with mp2 audio even if ffmpeg is installed.  Use this if you have problems
              with ffmpeg.  Usually ffmpeg is much faster at encoding video.

       [<b>-mp2</b>] Use mp2 audio by default.  AC3 audio seems to be more stable when playing in dvd hardware players,
              but requires ffmpeg.  This will over-ride the AC3 default and use the mp2 audio encoder.

       [<b>-s</b> <b>WidthxHeight</b>]
              Use output size other than the standard DVD output size (720x480 for NTSC).  Used when  specifying
              alternate output formats with -flv or -mp4

       [<b>-flv</b>] Render a flash video instead of a mpeg2 .vob.  Default output size is 320x240.

       [<b>-mp4</b>] Render a mp4 video instead of a mpeg2 .vob.

       [<b>-mpg</b>] Render  a  .mpg  video  instead of a mpeg2 .vob.  Allows for alternate (non DVD compatible) sizing
              with -s

       [<b>-vcd</b>] (alpha) Renders video in vcd-compatible output.

       [<b>-svcd</b>]
              (alpha) Renders video in svcd-compatible output.

       [<b>-L</b>]   Render a low-quality video suitable for debugging.  This  sets  the  resolution  to  1/2  of  full
              resolution  and  decreases  the  quality  of  fades/transitions.   It should speed up the encoding
              process by at least a factor of 4.

       [<b>-H</b>]   (Beta) Render a higher-quality video. This uses the default dvd resolution  and  keeps  all  other
              output  parameters  the  same, but enables some pixel-sampling methods that make the scroll effect
              look better at very slow velocities. This will make dvd-slideshow take up to 4x longer to  process
              the scroll effect. Only applied when needed; the output will explain if it is being used.

       [<b>-theme</b> <b>&lt;themefile&gt;</b>]
              Use   the   given   theme   when   setting   variables/colors/etc.   Themes   are   installed   in
              /opt/dvd-slideshow/themes or in a local directory <a href="file:~/.dvd-slideshow/themes">~/.dvd-slideshow/themes</a>

       [<b>-border</b> <b>N</b>]
              Make a border of N pixels around each image. Does not apply to title slides.

       [<b>-sharpen</b>]
              Sharpen images.

       [<b>-r</b>]   Autocrop images near the DVD output aspect ratio to fill the whole window.

       [<b>-w</b>]   [alpha] Render widescreen (16:9) output instead of standard (4:3).

       [<b>-nosmp</b>]
              Disable multiple threads in some processes when possible.  If you have little  memory  or  a  slow
              machine, this may help if you experience problems with disk memory caching.

       [<b>-nocleanup</b>]
              Leave temporary files in the temporary directory.  Useful for debugging.

       [<b>-q</b>]   Quiet output mode.  Reduce amount of information on screen, but keep a progressbar indicator.

       [<b>-V</b> <b>1|2</b>]
              Increase verbose debug output.  1 adds more than the default, and 2 adds a lot.

       <b>-h</b>     Prints help file (basically this manpage).

</pre><h4><b>INPUT</b> <b>FILE</b></h4><pre>
       Note: The -f is optional if the input filename is the last argument on the comand-line.

       The input file is a text file that acts like a timeline or storyboard for your slideshow.  In the most
       simple form, it is just a list of images.  See EXAMPLES for some simple examples of these text files. The
       input file also allows for many more special effects that are not available on the command line. Each
       line contains one image or effect. It uses the : character as a separator for the fields. Here is the
       syntax:

       [image.jpg|keyword]:duration:subtitle:effect:effect_params

       Duration can be specified in integer seconds like 5 or with up to three decimal points of accuracy, like
       5.683.

       When passing a picture, you can optionally use the keyword "audio" instead of the duration in seconds.
       What this does is force the duration of that image to be the length of the previous audio track.  This is
       useful for making a music video dvd.

       The subtitle field is optional, but if you are passing effects after the subtitle field, be sure to
       include all the colons :: in order for the parser to get the correct info.  You can escape a colon in
       subtitles with a backslash.

       <b>NOTE:</b> the effect parameters are separated by a semicolon ; instead of a colon :.

       <b>KEYWORDS:</b>
              <b>title</b>:duration:title text
              Makes  a  title  slide  with  text centered in the screen.  Further control of the font, size, and
              position of the title text can be achieved by setting variables (see the VARIABLES section).

              <b>titlebar</b>:duration:Upper title text:Lower title text
              Makes a title slide using &lt;Upper title text&gt; as a title at the top of the screen, and &lt;Lower title
              text&gt; as a lower title, in a band at the bottom of the screen.  Each title is optional.  If one is
              missing, it will not be displayed. White ands are underlayed behind the text for better  contrast.
              Further  control  of  the  font,  size,  and position of the title text can be achieved by setting
              variables (see the VARIABLES section).

              <b>musictitle</b>:duration:subtitle:Title:Artist;Album
              Makes a black frame with the song info printed in the bottom left corner. Yes, that is a semicolon
              between Artist and Album.

              <b>background</b>:duration:subtitle:image.jpg
              Makes a slide with the current background image (or black if no image is passed).  If a new  image
              name is passed, the background will be reset to that picture. Examples:
              "background:2" will display the current background for 2 seconds.
              "background:2::image.jpg" will set the background to image.jpg and also display it for 2 seconds.
              "background:0::image.jpg"  will  set  the background image to image.jpg, but will not use it until
              the next picture.
              "black" or "white" can be used instead of an image name to display a black or white background.

              <b>Transitions</b>:
              Transitions do not add time to the overall slideshow,  they  just  get  overlaid  on  top  of  the
              adjacent  images.   Because  of  this, the transition duration can not be greater than half of the
              adjacent image duration.

              <b>fadein</b>:duration:subtitle
              Fades in to the next slide

              <b>fadeout</b>:duration:subtitle
              Fades out to the background

              <b>crossfade</b>:duration:subtitle
              Fades from one slide to the next.

              <b>wipe</b>:duration:subtitle:[up|down|left|right]
              Wipes from one picture to the next.  The direction is optional and will default to left.

              <b>chapter</b>
              Force manual chapter marker timing.  Chapter markers will only  be  created  where  the  "chapter"
              keyword occurs. The default is to add chapter markers at every slide.

              <b>include</b>:includefile.txt
              Other  input  files  can  be  included  in  the  input .txt file. The file includefile.txt will be
              concatenated in the place where the line occurs..

              <b>exit</b>
              Stops the slideshow at the current point as if the input.txt file ended at this point. Useful  for
              debugging

       <b>EFFECTS:</b>
              Effects  are  only  used with images, not keywords. In the following effects, x0,y0 represents the
              top left corner of a defined box, and x1,y1 is the bottom right corner.
              NOTE: the effect parameters are separated by a semicolon ; instead of a colon :

              <b>crop</b>
              image.jpg:duration:subtitle:crop:x0,y0;x1,y1
              Crops the image about the coordinates specified (in the original image coordinate system).
              <u>Crop</u> <u>keyword</u> <u>description:</u>
              Because it is difficult to figure out the exact locations where you want to crop, it  is  possible
              to use special keywords for the locations where you want to crop the image.  The basic format is:
                   frame_size%;frame_location
              where  frame_size indicates the relative scale(%) in percent of the final dvd window width/height,
              and frame_location refers to the location of the center point of the picture relative to  the  dvd
              window.
              Frame_location can be any of the following keywords:
                   topleft        top            topright
                   left           middle         right
                   bottomleft     bottom         bottomright
              or
                   x%,y%
              where  %  is  a percentage of the window width,height starting from the top left corner of the dvd
              window.
              or
                   imagewidth | imageheight
              where the image width or height will be scaled to fill the full width or height of the dvd screen.
              <u>Crop</u> <u>examples:</u>
                   image.jpg:dur:sub:crop:651,390;1134,759
                   image.jpg:dur:sub:crop:30%;60%,60%
                   image.jpg:dur:sub:crop:50%;topleft
                   image.jpg:dur:sub:crop:imageheight;left

              <b>kenburns</b>
              image.jpg:duration:subtitle:kenburns:start_box;end_box
              Where now we have starting (s) and ending (e) boxes, defined in the same  way  as  in  the  "crop"
              function,  above.  The  kenburns  effect  will  crop/zoom  from the start to the end for the given
              duration.
              Full box description:
                   xs0,ys0;xs1,ys1;xe0,ye0;xe1,ye1
              Specifies the <a href="../man0/top-left.0.html">top-left</a>(0) and <a href="../man1/bottom-right.1.html">bottom-right</a>(1) points.

              <u>Keyword</u> <u>description:</u>
              start_frame_size%;start_location;end_frame_size%;end_location

              <u>Kenburns</u> <u>examples:</u>
                      image.jpg:5::kenburns:651,390;1134,759;372,330;1365,1089
                   image.jpg:5:sub:kenburns:30%;60%,60%;75%;40%,50%
                   image.jpg:5:sub:kenburns:50%;topleft;50%;bottomright
                   image.jpg:5:sub:kenburns:100%;left;0,0;720,480
                   image.jpg:5:sub:kenburns:100%;left;imageheight;left

              <u>scroll</u>
                   image.jpg:duration:subtitle:scroll:left
                   image.jpg:duration:subtitle:scroll:right
                   image.jpg:duration:subtitle:scroll:up
                   image.jpg:duration:subtitle:scroll:down

              This is most useful for displaying panorama-style pictures that are much wider than they are tall.
              For example, "scroll:right" will automatically resize the picture so  that  the  image  height  is
              equal to the video display height (480) before scrolling right.

              Note that in high quality mode (-H), some calculations will be made to see how slow the scroll is,
              and  if  it  is  slow  enough, sub-pixel sampling will be used to make the scroll effect look much
              smoother.  Sounds good, right?  Well, it will take a LOT longer to process the frames also!

       <b>AUDIO:</b>
              Audio tracks can be inter-mixed with the video.  If an audio track is placed between two different
              images/effects, that audio track will begin playing at the start of the second image/effect.  When
              placing audio, use the syntax:

              audiofile:track:effect1:effect1_params:effect2:effect2_params

              The audiofile can be a .ogg, .mp3, or .wav file.
              Track is the resulting dvd audio track.

              <b>Audio</b> <b>Effects</b> are audio effects where you can specify things  like  fadein  and  fadeout  for  the
              audio.  Example:

              audiofile:1:fadein:3:fadeout:2

              If  you  want  to concatenate two audio files, just place them one right after another in the .txt
              file.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       You can specify lots of variables and options throughout  the  dvd-slideshow  script.   Settings  can  be
       passed  on the command line, in a default <a href="file:~/.dvd-slideshow/dvd-slideshowrc">~/.dvd-slideshow/dvd-slideshowrc</a> file, or within the input text
       file.  The order in which the script reads the settings is as follows:
       Default script settings --&gt; <a href="file:~/.dvd-slideshow/dvd-slideshowrc">~/.dvd-slideshow/dvd-slideshowrc</a> --&gt; command line --&gt; input text file
       so each successive setting will over-ride the previous settings if they are already set.

       <b><a href="file:~/.dvd-slideshow/dvd-slideshowrc">~/.dvd-slideshow/dvd-slideshowrc</a>:</b>
              With the syntax shown below, the following variables can be specified  in  the  <a href="file:~/.dvd-slideshowrc">~/.dvd-slideshowrc</a>
              file.  All lines are optional, and everything after the # character is not read.

              debug=1        # 0 (low) to 3 (lots of info)

       <b>Input</b> <b>text</b> <b>file:</b>
              The same syntax used in <a href="file:~/.dvd-slideshow/dvd-slideshowrc">~/.dvd-slideshow/dvd-slideshowrc</a> can be used in the input text file.  This
              way, you could specify settings specifit to the slideshow you are working on without changing your
              default settings.

</pre><h4><b>THEMES</b></h4><pre>
       A theme is just a file containing a list of configuration variables, and possibly also background images,
       fonts, or audio in the same directory.

       Any of the configuration variables can be placed in a dvd-slideshow theme file to  control  dvd-slideshow
       also..br

       This will be explained more later...
