</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       qprint - encode / decode file as RFC 1521 MIME Quoted-Printable

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>qprint</b> <b>-d</b>|<b>-e</b> [ <u>options</u> ] [ <u>infile</u> [ <u>outfile</u> ] ]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  MIME  (Multipurpose  Internet  Mail  Extensions)  specification  RFC  1521 and successors) defines a
       mechanism for encoding text consisting primarily of printable ASCII characters,  but  which  may  contain
       characters  (for example, accented letters in the ISO 8859 Latin-1 character set) which cannot be encoded
       as 7-bit ASCII or are non-printable characters which may confuse mail transfer agents.

       <b>qprint</b> is a command line utility which encodes and decodes files in this format.  It can be used within a
       pipeline as an encoding or decoding filter, and is most commonly used  in  this  manner  as  part  of  an
       automated  mail  processing  system.   With appropriate options, <b>qprint</b> can encode pure binary files, but
       it's a poor choice since it may inflate the size of the file by as much as a factor of three.  The Base64
       MIME encoding is a better choice for such data.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-b</b>, <b>--binary</b>
                   Treat the input (when encoding) or output (when decoding) file as pure  binary,  and  process
                   end  of  line  sequences  as  binary  data.   Encoding  and  decoding a file with this option
                   preserves the exact sequence of bytes in the input, but does not perform the  translation  of
                   end of line sequences normally performed by Quoted-Printable encoding.

       <b>--copyright</b> Print program copyright information.

       <b>-d</b>, <b>--decode</b>
                   Decodes the input, previously created by <b>qprint</b>, to recover the original input file.

       <b>-e</b>, <b>--encode</b>
                   Encodes the input into an output text file containing its qprint encoding.

       <b>-i</b>, <b>--ebcdic</b>
                   Encode  ASCII  characters  for  which no equivalent exists in the EBCDIC character set.  This
                   renders files more portable when transported to EBCDIC systems.

       <b>-n</b>, <b>--noerrcheck</b>
                   Suppress error checking when decoding.  By default,  upon  encountering  a  non  white  space
                   character  which  does  not  belong  to  the  qprint  set,  or  discovering the input file is
                   incorrectly padded to a multiple of four characters,  <b>qprint</b>  issues  an  error  message  and
                   terminates  processing  with  exit  status 1.  The <b>-n</b> option suppresses even this rudimentary
                   error checking; invalid characters are silently ignored and the output truncated to the  last
                   three valid octets if the input is incorrectly padded.

       <b>-p</b> ,<b>--paranoid</b>
                   Every  character  in  the  input  file  will be encoded as an escape sequence.  You must also
                   specify the <b>-b</b> or <b>--binary</b> option if you wish end of line sequences to be  escaped  as  well.
                   This  option is a last resort when there's no other way to transmit the file, but an encoding
                   explicitly designed for binary data such as Base64 is a much more economical choice.

       <b>-u</b>, <b>--help</b>  Print how-to-call information.

       <b>--version</b>   Print program version information.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>qprint</b> returns status 0 if processing was completed without errors, 1 if an I/O error occurred or  errors
       were  detected in decoding a file which indicate it is incorrect or incomplete, and 2 if processing could
       not be performed at all due, for example, to a nonexistent input file.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       If no <u>infile</u> is specified or <u>infile</u> is a single ``-'', <b>qprint</b> reads from standard input; if no <u>outfile</u> is
       given, or <u>outfile</u> is a single ``-'', output is sent  to  standard  output.   The  input  and  output  are
       processed strictly serially; consequently <b>qprint</b> may be used in pipelines.  The program can process files
       of any size supported by the system containing text lines of arbitrary length.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Encoding a file with a large percentage of non-ASCII characters may dramatically increase its size.  This
       is inherent in the design of Quoted-Printable encoding.
