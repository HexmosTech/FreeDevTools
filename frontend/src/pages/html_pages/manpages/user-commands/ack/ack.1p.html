</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       ack - grep-like text finder

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           ack [options] PATTERN [FILE...]
           ack -f [options] [DIRECTORY...]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       ack is designed as an alternative to <u>grep</u> for programmers.

       ack searches the named input FILEs or DIRECTORYs for lines containing a match to the given PATTERN.  By
       default, ack prints the matching lines.  If no FILE or DIRECTORY is given, the current directory will be
       searched.

       PATTERN is a Perl regular expression.  Perl regular expressions are commonly found in other programming
       languages, but for the particulars of their behavior, please consult perlreref
       &lt;https://perldoc.perl.org/perlreref.html&gt;.  If you don't know how to use regular expression but are
       interested in learning, you may consult perlretut &lt;https://perldoc.perl.org/perlretut.html&gt;.  If you do
       not need or want ack to use regular expressions, please see the "-Q"/"--literal" option.

       Ack can also list files that would be searched, without actually searching them, to let you take
       advantage of ack's file-type filtering capabilities.

</pre><h4><b>FILE</b> <b>SELECTION</b></h4><pre>
       If files are not specified for searching, either on the command line or piped in with the "-x" option,
       <u>ack</u> delves into subdirectories selecting files for searching.

       <u>ack</u> is intelligent about the files it searches.  It knows about certain file types, based on both the
       extension on the file and, in some cases, the contents of the file.  These selections can be made with
       the <b>--type</b> option.

       With no file selection, <u>ack</u> searches through regular files that are not explicitly excluded by
       <b>--ignore-dir</b> and <b>--ignore-file</b> options, either present in <u>ackrc</u> files or on the command line.

       The default options for <u>ack</u> ignore certain files and directories.  These include:

       •   Backup files: Files matching <u>#*#</u> or ending with <u>~</u>.

       •   Coredumps: Files matching <u>core.\d+</u>

       •   Version control directories like <u>.svn</u> and <u>.git</u>.

       Run <u>ack</u> with the "--dump" option to see what settings are set.

       However,  <u>ack</u>  always searches the files given on the command line, no matter what type.  If you tell <u>ack</u>
       to search in a coredump, it will search in a coredump.

</pre><h4><b>DIRECTORY</b> <b>SELECTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>ack</u> descends through the directory tree of the starting directories specified.   If  no  directories  are
       specified, the current working directory is used.  However, it will ignore the shadow directories used by
       many  version  control systems, and the build directories used by the Perl MakeMaker system.  You may add
       or remove a directory from this list with the <b>--[no]ignore-dir</b> option. The  option  may  be  repeated  to
       add/remove multiple directories from the ignore list.

       For a complete list of directories that do not get searched, run "ack --dump".

</pre><h4><b>MATCHING</b> <b>IN</b> <b>A</b> <b>RANGE</b> <b>OF</b> <b>LINES</b></h4><pre>
       The "--range-start" and "--range-end" options let you specify ranges of lines to search within each file.

       Say you had the following file, called <u>testfile</u>:

           # This function calls print on "foo".
           sub foo {
               print 'foo';
           }
           my $print = 1;
           sub bar {
               print 'bar';
           }
           my $task = 'print';

       Calling "ack print" will give us five matches:

           $ ack print testfile
           # This function calls print on "foo".
               print 'foo';
           my $print = 1;
               print 'bar';
           my $task = 'print';

       What  if  we only want to search for "print" within the subroutines?  We can specify ranges of lines that
       we want ack to search.  The range starts with any line that matches the pattern  "^sub  \w+",  and  stops
       with any line that matches "^}".

           $ ack --range-start='^sub \w+' --range-end='^}' print testfile
               print 'foo';
               print 'bar';

       Note  that  ack  searched  two  ranges of lines.  The listing below shows which lines were in a range and
       which were out of the range.

           Out # This function calls print on "foo".
           In  sub foo {
           In      print 'foo';
           In  }
           Out my $print = 1;
           In  sub bar {
           In      print 'bar';
           In  }
           Out my $task = 'print';

       You don't have to specify both "--range-start" and "--range-end".  IF "--range-start"  is  omitted,  then
       the  range  runs  from  the  first  line  in  the  file  until the first line that matches "--range-end".
       Similarly, if "--range-end" is omitted, the range runs from the first line  matching  "--range-start"  to
       the end of the file.

       For  example,  if  you  wanted  to search all HTML files up until the first instance of the "&lt;body&gt;", you
       could do

           ack foo --html --range-end='&lt;body&gt;'

       Or to search after Perl's `__DATA__` or `__END__` markers, you would do

           ack pattern --perl --range-start='^__(END|DATA)__'

       It's possible for a range to start and stop on the same line.  For example

           --range-start='&lt;title&gt;' --range-end='&lt;/title&gt;'

       would match this line as both the start and end of the range, making a one-line range.

           &lt;title&gt;Page title&lt;/title&gt;

       Note that the patterns in "--range-start" and "--range-end" are not affected by options like  "-i",  "-w"
       and "-Q" that modify the behavior of the main pattern being matched.

       Again,  ranges  only  affect  where  matches  are looked for.  Everything else in ack works the same way.
       Using "-c" option with a range will give a count of all the matches that appear within those ranges.  The
       "-l" shows those files that have a match within a range, and the "-L" option shows files that do not have
       a match within a range.

       The "-v" option for negating a match works inside the range, too.  To see lines that don't match "google"
       within the "&lt;head&gt;" section of your HTML files, you could do:

           ack google -v --html --range-start='&lt;head' --range-end='&lt;/head&gt;'

       Specifying a range to search does not affect how matches are displayed.  The context  for  a  match  will
       still be the same, and

       Using  the context options work the same way, and will show context lines for matches even if the context
       lines fall outside the range.  Similarly, "--passthru" will show all lines in the  file,  but  only  show
       matches for lines within the range.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--ackrc</b>
           Specifies an ackrc file to load after all others; see "ACKRC LOCATION SEMANTICS".

       <b>-A</b> <u><b>NUM</b></u>, <b>--after-context=</b><u><b>NUM</b></u>
           Print <u>NUM</u> lines of trailing context after matching lines.

       <b>-B</b> <u><b>NUM</b></u>, <b>--before-context=</b><u><b>NUM</b></u>
           Print <u>NUM</u> lines of leading context before matching lines.

       <b>--[no]break</b>
           Print a break between results from different files. On by default when used interactively.

       <b>-C</b> <b>[</b><u><b>NUM</b></u><b>]</b>, <b>--context[=</b><u><b>NUM</b></u><b>]</b>
           Print  <u>NUM</u> lines (default 2) of context around matching lines.  You can specify zero lines of context
           to override another context specified in an ackrc.

       <b>-c</b>, <b>--count</b>
           Suppress normal output; instead print a count of matching lines for each input file.   If  <b>-l</b>  is  in
           effect,  it  will  only  show the number of lines for each file that has lines matching.  Without <b>-l</b>,
           some line counts may be zeroes.

           If combined with <b>-h</b> (<b>--no-filename</b>) ack outputs only one total count.

       <b>--[no]color</b>, <b>--[no]colour</b>
           <b>--color</b> highlights the matching text.  <b>--nocolor</b> suppresses the color.  This is on by default  unless
           the output is redirected.

           On  Windows, this option is off by default unless the Win32::Console::ANSI module is installed or the
           "ACK_PAGER_COLOR" environment variable is used.

       <b>--color-filename=</b><u><b>color</b></u>
           Sets the color to be used for filenames.

       <b>--color-match=</b><u><b>color</b></u>
           Sets the color to be used for matches.

       <b>--color-colno=</b><u><b>color</b></u>
           Sets the color to be used for column numbers.

       <b>--color-lineno=</b><u><b>color</b></u>
           Sets the color to be used for line numbers.

       <b>--[no]column</b>
           Show the column number of the first match.  This is helpful for editors that can place your cursor at
           a given position.

       <b>--create-ackrc</b>
           Dumps the default ack options to standard output.  This is useful for when you want to customize  the
           defaults.

       <b>--dump</b>
           Writes the list of options loaded and where they came from to standard output.  Handy for debugging.

       <b>--[no]env</b>
           <b>--noenv</b>  disables  all  environment  processing.  No <u>.ackrc</u> is read and all environment variables are
           ignored. By default, <u>ack</u> considers <u>.ackrc</u> and settings in the environment.

       <b>--flush</b>
           <b>--flush</b> flushes output immediately.  This is off by default unless ack is running interactively (when
           output goes to a pipe or file).

       <b>-f</b>  Only print the files that would be searched, without actually doing any searching.  PATTERN must  not
           be specified, or it will be taken as a path to search.

       <b>--files-from=</b><u><b>FILE</b></u>
           The  list of files to be searched is specified in <u>FILE</u>.  The list of files are separated by newlines.
           If <u>FILE</u> is "-", the list is loaded from standard input.

           Note that the list of files is <b>not</b> filtered in any way.  If you  add  "--type=html"  in  addition  to
           "--files-from", the "--type" will be ignored.

       <b>--[no]filter</b>
           Forces ack to act as if it were receiving input via a pipe.

       <b>--[no]follow</b>
           Follow  or don't follow symlinks, other than whatever starting files or directories were specified on
           the command line.

           This is off by default.

       <b>-g</b> <u><b>PATTERN</b></u>
           Print searchable files where the relative path + filename matches <u>PATTERN</u>.

           Note that

               ack -g foo

           is exactly the same as

               ack -f | ack foo

           This means that just as ack will not search, for example, <u>.jpg</u> files, "-g" will not list  <u>.jpg</u>  files
           either.  ack is not intended to be a general-purpose file finder.

           Note  also  that  if  you  have  "-i"  in  your .ackrc that the filenames to be matched will be case-
           insensitive as well.

           This option can be combined with <b>--color</b> to make it easier to spot the match.

       <b>--[no]group</b>
           <b>--group</b> groups matches by file name.  This is the default when used interactively.

           <b>--nogroup</b> prints one result per line, like grep.  This is the default when output is redirected.

       <b>-H</b>, <b>--with-filename</b>
           Print the filename for each match. This is the default unless searching a single explicitly specified
           file.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--no-filename</b>
           Suppress the prefixing of filenames on output when multiple files are searched.

       <b>--[no]heading</b>
           Print a filename heading above each file's results.  This is the default when used interactively.

       <b>--help</b>
           Print a short help statement.

       <b>--help-types</b>
           Print all known types.

       <b>--help-colors</b>
           Print a chart of various color combinations.

       <b>--help-rgb-colors</b>
           Like <b>--help-colors</b> but with more precise RGB colors.

       <b>-i</b>, <b>--ignore-case</b>
           Ignore case distinctions in PATTERN.  Overrides <b>--smart-case</b> and <b>-I</b>.

       <b>-I</b>, <b>--no-ignore-case</b>
           Turns on case distinctions in PATTERN.  Overrides <b>--smart-case</b> and <b>-i</b>.

       <b>--ignore-ack-defaults</b>
           Tells ack to completely ignore the  default  definitions  provided  with  ack.   This  is  useful  in
           combination with <b>--create-ackrc</b> if you <u>really</u> want to customize ack.

       <b>--[no]ignore-dir=</b><u><b>DIRNAME</b></u>, <b>--[no]ignore-directory=</b><u><b>DIRNAME</b></u>
           Ignore  directory  (as  CVS,  .svn,  etc  are ignored). May be used multiple times to ignore multiple
           directories. For example, mason users may  wish  to  include  <b>--ignore-dir=data</b>.  The  <b>--noignore-dir</b>
           option  allows  users  to search directories which would normally be ignored (perhaps to research the
           contents of <u>.svn/props</u> directories).

           The <u>DIRNAME</u> must always be  a  simple  directory  name.  Nested  directories  like  <u>foo/bar</u>  are  NOT
           supported.  You  would  need to specify <b>--ignore-dir=foo</b> and then no files from any foo directory are
           taken into account by ack unless given explicitly on the command line.

       <b>--ignore-file=</b><u><b>FILTER:ARGS</b></u>
           Ignore files matching <u>FILTER:ARGS</u>.  The filters are specified identically to  file  type  filters  as
           seen in "Defining your own types".

       <b>-k</b>, <b>--known-types</b>
           Limit selected files to those with types that ack knows about.

       <b>-l</b>, <b>--files-with-matches</b>
           Only print the filenames of matching files, instead of the matching text.

       <b>-L</b>, <b>--files-without-matches</b>
           Only print the filenames of files that do <u>NOT</u> match.

       <b>--match</b> <u><b>PATTERN</b></u>
           Specify  the  <u>PATTERN</u>  explicitly.  This  is helpful if you don't want to put the regex as your first
           argument, e.g. when executing multiple searches over the same set of files.

               # search for foo and bar in given files
               ack file1 t/file* --match foo
               ack file1 t/file* --match bar

       <b>-m=</b><u><b>NUM</b></u>, <b>--max-count=</b><u><b>NUM</b></u>
           Print only <u>NUM</u> matches out of each file.  If you want to stop ack after printing the first  match  of
           any kind, use the <b>-1</b> options.

       <b>--man</b>
           Print this manual page.

       <b>-n</b>, <b>--no-recurse</b>
           No descending into subdirectories.

       <b>--not=PATTERN</b>
           Specifies  a  <u>PATTERN</u>  that must NOT me true on a given line for a match to occur. This option can be
           repeated.

           If you want to find all the lines with "dogs" but not if "cats" or "fish" appear on the line, use:

               ack dogs --not cats --not fish

           Note that the options that affect "dogs" also affect "cats" and "fish", so if you have

               ack -i -w dogs --not cats

           the the search for both "dogs" and "cats" will be case-insensitive and be word-limited.

       <b>-o</b>  Show only the part of each line matching PATTERN (turns off text highlighting).  This is exactly  the
           same as "--output=$&amp;".

       <b>--output=</b><u><b>expr</b></u>
           Output  the  evaluation  of <u>expr</u> for each line (turns off text highlighting). If PATTERN matches more
           than once then a line is output for each non-overlapping match.

           <u>expr</u> may contain the strings "\n", "\r" and "\t", which  will  be  expanded  to  their  corresponding
           characters line feed, carriage return and tab, respectively.

           <u>expr</u> may also contain the following Perl special variables:

           $1 through $9
               The subpattern from the corresponding set of capturing parentheses.  If your pattern is "(.+) and
               (.+)", and the string is "this and that', then $1 is "this" and $2 is "that".

           $_  The contents of the line in the file.

           $.  The number of the line in the file.

           $&amp;, "$`" and "$'"
               $&amp;  is  the  the string matched by the pattern, "$`" is what precedes the match, and "$'" is what
               follows it.  If the pattern is "gra(ph|nd)"  and  the  string  is  "lexicographic",  then  $&amp;  is
               "graph", "$`" is "lexico" and "$'" is "ic".

               Use of these variables in your output will slow down the pattern matching.

           $+  The match made by the last parentheses that matched in the pattern.  For example, if your pattern
               is "Version: (.+)|Revision: (.+)", then $+ will contain whichever set of parentheses matched.

           $f  $f  is  available,  in  "--output"  only,  to  insert  the  filename.  This is a stand-in for the
               discovered $filename usage in old "ack2 --output",  which  is  disallowed  with  "ack3"  improved
               security.

               The  intended  usage  is to provide the grep or compile-error syntax needed for editor/IDE go-to-
               line integration, e.g. "--output=$f:$.:$_" or "--output=$f\t$.\t$&amp;"

       <b>--pager=</b><u><b>program</b></u>, <b>--nopager</b>
           <b>--pager</b> directs ack's output through <u>program</u>.  This can also be specified  via  the  "ACK_PAGER"  and
           "ACK_PAGER_COLOR" environment variables.

           Using --pager does not suppress grouping and coloring like piping output on the command-line does.

           <b>--nopager</b>  cancels any setting in <u><a href="file:~/.ackrc">~/.ackrc</a></u>, "ACK_PAGER" or "ACK_PAGER_COLOR".  No output will be sent
           through a pager.

       <b>--passthru</b>
           Prints all lines, whether or not they match the expression.  Highlighting will still work, though, so
           it can be used to highlight matches while still seeing the entire file, as in:

               # Watch a log file, and highlight a certain IP address.
               $ tail -f <a href="file:~/access.log">~/access.log</a> | ack --passthru 123.45.67.89

       <b>--print0</b>
           Only works in conjunction with <b>-f</b>, <b>-g</b>, <b>-l</b> or <b>-c</b>, options that only list filenames.  The filenames are
           output separated with a null byte instead of the usual newline. This is  helpful  when  dealing  with
           filenames that contain whitespace, e.g.

               # Remove all files of type HTML.
               ack -f --html --print0 | xargs -0 rm -f

       <b>-p[N]</b>, <b>--proximate[=N]</b>
           Groups  together  match  lines  that  are  within N lines of each other.  This is useful for visually
           picking out matches that appear close to other matches.

           For example, if you got these results without the "--proximate" option,

               15: First match
               18: Second match
               19: Third match
               37: Fourth match

           they would look like this with "--proximate=1"

               15: First match

               18: Second match
               19: Third match

               37: Fourth match

           and this with "--proximate=3".

               15: First match
               18: Second match
               19: Third match

               37: Fourth match

           If N is omitted, N is set to 1.

       <b>-P</b>  Negates the effect of the <b>--proximate</b> option.  Shortcut for <b>--proximate=0</b>.

       <b>-Q</b>, <b>--literal</b>
           Quote all metacharacters in PATTERN, it is treated as a literal.

       <b>-r</b>, <b>-R</b>, <b>--recurse</b>
           Recurse into sub-directories. This is the default and just here for compatibility with grep. You  can
           also use it for turning <b>--no-recurse</b> off.

       <b>--range-start=PATTERN</b>, <b>--range-end=PATTERN</b>
           Specifies  patterns  that  mark the start and end of a range.  See "MATCHING IN A RANGE OF LINES" for
           details.

       <b>-s</b>  Suppress error messages about nonexistent or unreadable files.  This is taken from fgrep.

       <b>-S</b>, <b>--[no]smart-case</b>, <b>--no-smart-case</b>
           Ignore case in the search strings if PATTERN contains no uppercase characters.  This  is  similar  to
           "smartcase" in the vim text editor.  The options overrides <b>-i</b> and <b>-I</b>.

           <b>-S</b> is a synonym for <b>--smart-case</b>.

           <b>-i</b> always overrides this option.

       <b>--sort-files</b>
           Sorts the found files lexicographically.  Use this if you want your file listings to be deterministic
           between runs of <u>ack</u>.

       <b>--show-types</b>
           Outputs the filetypes that ack associates with each file.

           Works with <b>-f</b> and <b>-g</b> options.

       <b>-t</b> <b>TYPE</b>, <b>--type=TYPE</b>, <b>--TYPE</b>
           Specify  the  types  of  files  to  include  in  the  search.   TYPE is a filetype, like <u>perl</u> or <u>xml</u>.
           <b>--type=perl</b> can also be specified as <b>--perl</b>, although this is deprecated.

           Type inclusions can be repeated and are ORed together.

           See <u>ack</u> <u>--help-types</u> for a list of valid types.

       <b>-T</b> <b>TYPE</b>, <b>--type=noTYPE</b>, <b>--noTYPE</b>
           Specifies the type of files to exclude from the search.   <b>--type=noperl</b>  can  be  done  as  <b>--noperl</b>,
           although this is deprecated.

           If  a  file is of both type "foo" and "bar", specifying both <b>--type=foo</b> and <b>--type=nobar</b> will exclude
           the file, because an exclusion takes precedence over an inclusion.

       <b>--type-add</b> <u><b>TYPE</b></u><b>:</b><u><b>FILTER</b></u><b>:</b><u><b>ARGS</b></u>
           Files with the given ARGS applied to the given FILTER are recognized as being of (the existing)  type
           TYPE.  See also "Defining your own types".

       <b>--type-set</b> <u><b>TYPE</b></u><b>:</b><u><b>FILTER</b></u><b>:</b><u><b>ARGS</b></u>
           Files  with  the  given  ARGS  applied to the given FILTER are recognized as being of type TYPE. This
           replaces an existing definition for type TYPE.  See also "Defining your own types".

       <b>--type-del</b> <u><b>TYPE</b></u>
           The filters associated with TYPE are removed from Ack, and are no longer considered for searches.

       <b>--[no]underline</b>
           Turns on underlining of matches, where "underlining" is printing a line of carets under the match.

               $ ack -u foo
               peanuts.txt
               17: Come kick the football you fool
                                 ^^^          ^^^
               623: Price per square foot
                                     ^^^

           This is useful if you're dumping the results of an ack run into a text file or printer  that  doesn't
           support ANSI color codes.

           The setting of underline does not affect highlighting of matches.

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--invert-match</b>
           Invert match: select non-matching lines.

       <b>--version</b>
           Display version and copyright information.

       <b>-w</b>, <b>--word-regexp</b>
           Force PATTERN to match only whole words.

       <b>-x</b>  An  abbreviation  for  <b>--files-from=-</b>. The list of files to search are read from standard input, with
           one line per file.

           Note that the list of files is <b>not</b> filtered in any way.  If you  add  "--type=html"  in  addition  to
           "-x", the "--type" will be ignored.

       <b>-1</b>  Stops  after  reporting  first match of any kind.  This is different from <b>--max-count=1</b> or <b>-m1</b>, where
           only one match per file is shown.  Also, <b>-1</b> works with <b>-f</b> and <b>-g</b>, where <b>-m</b> does not.

       <b>--thpppt</b>
           Display the all-important Bill The Cat logo.  Note that the  exact  spelling  of  <b>--thpppppt</b>  is  not
           important.  It's checked against a regular expression.

       <b>--bar</b>
           Check with the admiral for traps.

       <b>--cathy</b>
           Chocolate, Chocolate, Chocolate!

</pre><h4><b>THE</b> <b>.ackrc</b> <b>FILE</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>.ackrc</u>  file contains command-line options that are prepended to the command line before processing.
       Multiple options may live on multiple lines.  Lines beginning with a # are ignored.  A <u>.ackrc</u> might  look
       like this:

           # Always sort the files
           --sort-files

           # Always color, even if piping to another program
           --color

           # Use "less -r" as my pager
           --pager=less -r

       Note  that  arguments  with  spaces  in them do not need to be quoted, as they are not interpreted by the
       shell. Basically, each <u>line</u> in the <u>.ackrc</u> file is interpreted as one element of @ARGV.

       <u>ack</u> looks in several locations for <u>.ackrc</u> files; the searching process is  detailed  in  "ACKRC  LOCATION
       SEMANTICS".  These files are not considered if <b>--noenv</b> is specified on the command line.

</pre><h4><b>Defining</b> <b>your</b> <b>own</b> <b>types</b></h4><pre>
       ack  allows  you  to define your own types in addition to the predefined types. This is done with command
       line options that are best put into an <u>.ackrc</u> file - then you do not have to define your types  over  and
       over  again.  In the following examples the options will always be shown on one command line so that they
       can be easily copy &amp; pasted.

       File types can be specified both with the the <u>--type=xxx</u> option, or the file type as  an  option  itself.
       For  example,  if you create a filetype of "cobol", you can specify <u>--type=cobol</u> or simply <u>--cobol</u>.  File
       types must be at least two characters long.  This is why the C language is <u>--cc</u> and  the  R  language  is
       <u>--rr</u>.

       <u>ack</u>  <u>--perl</u> <u>foo</u> searches for foo in all perl files. <u>ack</u> <u>--help-types</u> tells you, that perl files are files
       ending in .pl, .pm, .pod or .t. So what if you would like to include .xs files as well when searching for
       --perl files? <u>ack</u> <u>--type-add</u> <u>perl:ext:xs</u> <u>--perl</u> <u>foo</u> does this  for  you.  <b>--type-add</b>  appends  additional
       extensions to an existing type.

       If  you  want  to  define  a  new type, or completely redefine an existing type, then use <b>--type-set</b>. <u>ack</u>
       <u>--type-set</u> <u>eiffel:ext:e,eiffel</u> defines the type <u>eiffel</u>  to  include  files  with  the  extensions  .e  or
       .eiffel.   So  to  search  for  all  eiffel  files  containing  the  word  Bertrand  use  <u>ack</u>  <u>--type-set</u>
       <u>eiffel:ext:e,eiffel</u> <u>--eiffel</u> <u>Bertrand</u>.  As usual, you can also write <b>--type=eiffel</b> instead  of  <b>--eiffel</b>.
       Negation  also  works,  so <b>--noeiffel</b> excludes all eiffel files from a search. Redefining also works: <u>ack</u>
       <u>--type-set</u> <u>cc:ext:c,h</u> and <u>.xs</u> files no longer belong to the type <u>cc</u>.

       When defining your own types in the <u>.ackrc</u> file you have to use the following:

         --type-set=eiffel:ext:e,eiffel

       or writing on separate lines

         --type-set
         eiffel:ext:e,eiffel

       The following does <b>NOT</b> work in the <u>.ackrc</u> file:

         --type-set eiffel:ext:e,eiffel

       In order to see all currently defined  types,  use  <u>--help-types</u>,  e.g.   <u>ack</u>  <u>--type-set</u>  <u>backup:ext:bak</u>
       <u>--type-add</u> <u>perl:ext:perl</u> <u>--help-types</u>

       In  addition  to filtering based on extension, ack offers additional filter types.  The generic syntax is
       <u>--type-set</u> <u>TYPE:FILTER:ARGS</u>; <u>ARGS</u> depends on the value of <u>FILTER</u>.

       is:<u>FILENAME</u>
           <u>is</u> filters match the target filename exactly.  It takes exactly one argument, which is  the  name  of
           the file to match.

           Example:

               --type-set make:is:Makefile

       ext:<u>EXTENSION</u>[,<u>EXTENSION2</u>[,...]]
           <u>ext</u>  filters  match the extension of the target file against a list of extensions.  No leading dot is
           needed for the extensions.

           Example:

               --type-set perl:ext:pl,pm,t

       match:<u>PATTERN</u>
           <u>match</u> filters match the target filename against a regular expression.  The regular expression is made
           case-insensitive for the search.

           Example:

               --type-set make:match:/(gnu)?makefile/

       firstlinematch:<u>PATTERN</u>
           <u>firstlinematch</u> matches the first line of the target file against a regular expression.   Like  <u>match</u>,
           the regular expression is made case insensitive.

           Example:

               --type-add perl:firstlinematch:/perl/

</pre><h4><b>ACK</b> <b>COLORS</b></h4><pre>
       ack  allows  customization  of  the  colors it uses when presenting matches onscreen.  It uses the colors
       available in Perl's Term::ANSIColor module, which provides the following listed values.  Note  that  case
       does not matter when using these values.

       There are four different colors ack uses:

           Aspect      Option              Env. variable       Default
           --------    -----------------   ------------------  ---------------
           filename    --color-filename    ACK_COLOR_FILENAME  black on_yellow
           match       --color-match       ACK_COLOR_MATCH     bold green
           line no.    --color-lineno      ACK_COLOR_LINENO    bold yellow
           column no.  --color-colno       ACK_COLOR_COLNO     bold yellow

       The column number column is only used if the column number is shown because of the --column option.

       Colors  may  be  specified  by  command-line option, such as "ack --color-filename='red on_white'", or by
       setting an environment variable, such as "ACK_COLOR_FILENAME='red on_white'".  Options for colors can  be
       set in your ACKRC file (See "THE .ackrc FILE").

       ack can understand the following colors for the foreground:

           black red green yellow blue magenta cyan white

       The optional background color is specified by prepending "on_" to one of the foreground colors:

           on_black on_red on_green on_yellow on_blue on_magenta on_cyan on_white

       Each  of  the  foreground  colors  can be modified with the following attributes, which may or may not be
       supported by your terminal:

           bold faint italic underline blink reverse concealed

       Any combinations of modifiers can be added to the foreground color. If your terminal supports it, and you
       enjoy visual punishment, you can specify:

           ack --color-filename="blink italic underline bold red on_yellow"

       For charts of the colors and what they look like, run "ack --help-colors" and "ack --help-rgb-colors".

       If the eight standard colors, in their bold, faint and unmodified states, aren't enough for you to choose
       from, you can also specify colors by their RGB values.  They are specified as "rgbXYZ" where X, Y, and  Z
       are  values  between  0  and  5  giving  the  intensity of red, green and blue, respectively.  Therefore,
       "rgb500" is pure red, "rgb505" is purple, and so on.

       Background colors can be specified with the "on_" prefix prepended on an RGB color, so  that  "on_rgb505"
       would be a purple background.

       The modifier attributes of blink, italic, underscore and so on may or may not work on the RGB colors.

       For a chart of the 216 possible RGB colors, run "ack --help-rgb-colors".

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       For  commonly-used  ack  options,  environment  variables can make life much easier.  These variables are
       ignored if <b>--noenv</b> is specified on the command line.

       ACKRC
           Specifies the location of the user's <u>.ackrc</u> file.  If this file  doesn't  exist,  <u>ack</u>  looks  in  the
           default location.

       ACK_COLOR_COLNO
           Color  specification  for  the  column  number in ack's output.  By default, the column number is not
           shown.  You have to enable it with the <b>--column</b> option.  See the section "ack Colors" above.

       ACK_COLOR_FILENAME
           Color specification for the filename in ack's output.  See the section "ack Colors" above.

       ACK_COLOR_LINENO
           Color specification for the line number in ack's output.  See the section "ack Colors" above.

       ACK_COLOR_MATCH
           Color specification for the matched text in ack's output.  See the section "ack Colors" above.

       ACK_PAGER
           Specifies a pager program, such as "more", "less" or "most", to which ack will send its output.

           Using "ACK_PAGER" does not suppress grouping and coloring like  piping  output  on  the  command-line
           does, except that on Windows ack will assume that "ACK_PAGER" does not support color.

           "ACK_PAGER_COLOR" overrides "ACK_PAGER" if both are specified.

       ACK_PAGER_COLOR
           Specifies  a  pager  program that understands ANSI color sequences.  Using "ACK_PAGER_COLOR" does not
           suppress grouping and coloring like piping output on the command-line does.

           If you are not on Windows, you never need to use "ACK_PAGER_COLOR".

</pre><h4><b>ACK</b> <b>&amp;</b> <b>OTHER</b> <b>TOOLS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Simple</b> <b>vim</b> <b>integration</b>
       <u>ack</u> integrates easily with the Vim text editor. Set this in your <u>.vimrc</u> to use <u>ack</u> instead of <u>grep</u>:

           set grepprg=ack\ -k

       That example uses "-k" to search through only files of the types ack knows about, but you may  use  other
       default flags. Now you can search with <u>ack</u> and easily step through the results in Vim:

         :grep Dumper perllib

   <b>Editor</b> <b>integration</b>
       Many  users  have  integrated  ack  into  their  preferred  text  editors.   For  details  and links, see
       &lt;https://beyondgrep.com/more-tools/&gt;.

   <b>Shell</b> <b>and</b> <b>Return</b> <b>Code</b>
       For greater compatibility with <u>grep</u>, <u>ack</u> in normal use returns shell return or exit code  of  0  only  if
       something is found and 1 if no match is found.

       (Shell exit code 1 is "$?=256" in perl with "system" or backticks.)

       The <u>grep</u> code 2 for errors is not used.

       If  "-f" or "-g" are specified, then 0 is returned if at least one file is found.  If no files are found,
       then 1 is returned.

</pre><h4><b>DEBUGGING</b> <b>ACK</b> <b>PROBLEMS</b></h4><pre>
       If ack gives you output you're not expecting, start with a few simple steps.

   <b>Try</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> <b>--noenv</b>
       Your environment variables and <u>.ackrc</u> may  be  doing  things  you're  not  expecting,  or  forgotten  you
       specified.  Use <b>--noenv</b> to ignore your environment and <u>.ackrc</u>.

   <b>Use</b> <b>-f</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>files</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>selected</b> <b>for</b> <b>searching</b>
       Ack's  <b>-f</b>  was  originally  added as a debugging tool.  If ack is not finding matches you think it should
       find, run <u>ack</u> <u>-f</u> to see what files have been selected.  You can also add the  "--show-types"  options  to
       show the type of each file selected.

   <b>Use</b> <b>--dump</b>
       This  lists  the  ackrc  files  that  are loaded and the options loaded from them.  You may be loading an
       <u>.ackrc</u> file that you didn't know you were loading.

</pre><h4><b>ACKRC</b> <b>LOCATION</b> <b>SEMANTICS</b></h4><pre>
       Ack can load its configuration from many sources.  The following list specifies the sources Ack looks for
       configuration files; each one that is found is loaded in the order specified here, and each one overrides
       options set in any of the sources preceding it.  (For example, if I set --sort-files in  my  user  ackrc,
       and --nosort-files on the command line, the command line takes precedence)

       •   Defaults    are    loaded    from    App::Ack::ConfigDefaults.     This    can   be   omitted   using
           "--ignore-ack-defaults".

       •   Global ackrc

           Options are then loaded from the global ackrc.  This is located at "/etc/ackrc" on Unix-like systems.

           Under Windows XP and earlier, the global ackrc is at "C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application
           Data\ackrc"

           Under Windows Vista/7, the global ackrc is at "C:\ProgramData\ackrc"

           The "--noenv" option prevents all ackrc files from being loaded.

       •   User ackrc

           Options are then loaded from the user's ackrc.   This  is  located  at  "$HOME/.ackrc"  on  Unix-like
           systems.

           Under  Windows  XP  and  earlier, the user's ackrc is at "C:\Documents and Settings\$USER\Application
           Data\ackrc".

           Under Windows Vista/7, the user's ackrc is at "C:\Users\$USER\AppData\Roaming\ackrc".

           If you want to load a different user-level ackrc, it may be specified  with  the  $ACKRC  environment
           variable.

           The "--noenv" option prevents all ackrc files from being loaded.

       •   Project ackrc

           Options  are  then loaded from the project ackrc.  The project ackrc is the first ackrc file with the
           name ".ackrc" or "_ackrc", first searching in the current directory, then the parent directory,  then
           the grandparent directory, etc.  This can be omitted using "--noenv".

       •   --ackrc

           The  "--ackrc"  option may be included on the command line to specify an ackrc file that can override
           all others.  It is consulted even if "--noenv" is present.

       •   Command line

           Options are then loaded from the command line.

       details.

</pre><h4><b>FAQ</b></h4><pre>
       This is the Frequently Asked Questions list for ack.

   <b>Can</b> <b>I</b> <b>stop</b> <b>using</b> <b>grep</b> <b>now?</b>
       Many people find <u>ack</u> to be better than <u>grep</u> as an everyday tool 99% of the time,  but  don't  throw  <u>grep</u>
       away,  because  there are times you'll still need it.  For example, you might be looking through huge log
       files and not using regular expressions.  In that case, <u>grep</u> will probably perform better.

   <b>Why</b> <b>isn't</b> <b>ack</b> <b>finding</b> <b>a</b> <b>match</b> <b>in</b> <b>(some</b> <b>file)?</b>
       First, take a look and see if ack is even looking at the file.  ack is intelligent in what files it  will
       search and which ones it won't, but sometimes that can be surprising.

       Use  the  "-f"  switch, with no regex, to see a list of files that ack will search for you.  If your file
       doesn't show up in the list of files that "ack -f" shows, then ack never looks in it.

   <b>Wouldn't</b> <b>it</b> <b>be</b> <b>great</b> <b>if</b> <u><b>ack</b></u> <b>did</b> <b>search</b> <b>&amp;</b> <b>replace?</b>
       No, ack will always be read-only.  Perl has a perfectly good way to do search &amp; replace in  files,  using
       the "-i", "-p" and "-n" switches.

       You  can  certainly use ack to select your files to update.  For example, to change all "foo" to "bar" in
       all PHP files, you can do this from the Unix shell:

           $ perl -i -p -e's/foo/bar/g' $(ack -f --php)

   <b>Can</b> <b>I</b> <b>make</b> <b>ack</b> <b>recognize</b> <u><b>.xyz</b></u> <b>files?</b>
       Yes!  Please see "Defining your own types" in the ack manual.

   <b>Will</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>ack</b> <b>recognize</b> <u><b>.xyz</b></u> <b>files</b> <b>by</b> <b>default?</b>
       We might, depending on how widely-used the file format is.

       Submit an issue at in the GitHub issue  queue  at  &lt;https://github.com/beyondgrep/ack3/issues&gt;.   Explain
       what the file format is, where we can find out more about it, and what you have been using in your <u>.ackrc</u>
       to support it.

       Please  do not bother creating a pull request.  The code for filetypes is trivial compared to the rest of
       the process we go through.

   <b>Why</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>called</b> <b>ack</b> <b>if</b> <b>it's</b> <b>called</b> <b>ack-grep?</b>
       The name of the program is "ack".  Some packagers  have  called  it  "ack-grep"  when  creating  packages
       because there's already a package out there called "ack" that has nothing to do with this ack.

       I suggest you make a symlink named <u>ack</u> that points to <u>ack-grep</u> because one of the crucial benefits of ack
       is having a name that's so short and simple to type.

       To do that, run this with <u>sudo</u> or as root:

          ln -s /usr/bin/ack-grep /usr/bin/ack

       Alternatively, you could use a shell alias:

           # bash/zsh
           alias ack=ack-grep

           # csh
           alias ack ack-grep

   <b>What</b> <b>does</b> <u><b>ack</b></u> <b>mean?</b>
       Nothing.  I wanted a name that was easy to type and that you could pronounce as a single syllable.

   <b>Can</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>multi-line</b> <b>regexes?</b>
       No, ack does not support regexes that match multiple lines.  Doing so would require reading in the entire
       file at a time.

       If you want to see lines near your match, use the "--A", "--B" and "--C" switches for displaying context.

   <b>Why</b> <b>is</b> <b>ack</b> <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>invalid</b> <b>option</b> <b>when</b> <b>searching</b> <b>for</b> <b>"+foo"?</b>
       ack  treats  command  line  options beginning with "+" or "-" as options; if you would like to search for
       these, you may prefix your search term with "--" or use the "--match"  option.   (However,  don't  forget
       that "+" is a regular expression metacharacter!)

   <b>Why</b> <b>does</b> <b>"ack</b> <b>'.{40000,}'"</b> <b>fail?</b>  <b>Isn't</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>valid</b> <b>regex?</b>
       The  Perl  language  limits  the  repetition  quantifier  to  32K.  You can search for ".{32767}" but not
       ".{32768}".

   <b>Ack</b> <b>does</b> <b>"X"</b> <b>and</b> <b>shouldn't,</b> <b>should</b> <b>it?</b>
       We try to remain as close to grep's behavior as possible, so when in  doubt,  see  what  grep  does!   If
       there's  a  mismatch  in functionality there, please submit an issue to GitHub, and/or bring it up on the
       ack-users mailing list.
