</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       exa — a modern replacement for ls

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       exa [options] [files...]

       <b>exa</b>  is a modern replacement for ls.  It uses colours for information by default, helping you distinguish
       between many types of files, such as whether you are the owner, or in the owning group.

       It also has extra features not present in the original ls, such as viewing the Git status for a  directo‐
       ry, or recursing into directories with a tree view.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>exa</b>    Lists the contents of the current directory in a grid.

       <b>exa</b> <b>--oneline</b> <b>--reverse</b> <b>--sort=size</b>
              Displays a list of files with the largest at the top.

       <b>exa</b> <b>--long</b> <b>--header</b> <b>--inode</b> <b>--git</b>
              Displays a table of files with a header, showing each file’s metadata, inode, and Git status.

       <b>exa</b> <b>--long</b> <b>--tree</b> <b>--level=3</b>
              Displays a tree of files, three levels deep, as well as each file’s metadata.

</pre><h4><b>DISPLAY</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-1</b>, <b>--oneline</b>
              Display one entry per line.

       <b>-F</b>, <b>--classify</b>
              Display file kind indicators next to file names.

       <b>-G</b>, <b>--grid</b>
              Display entries as a grid (default).

       <b>-l</b>, <b>--long</b>
              Display extended file metadata as a table.

       <b>-R</b>, <b>--recurse</b>
              Recurse into directories.

       <b>-T</b>, <b>--tree</b>
              Recurse into directories as a tree.

       <b>-x</b>, <b>--across</b>
              Sort the grid across, rather than downwards.

       <b>--color</b>, <b>--colour=WHEN</b>
              When to use terminal colours.  Valid settings are `always', `automatic', and `never'.

       <b>--color-scale</b>, <b>--colour-scale</b>
              Colour file sizes on a scale.

       <b>--icons</b>
              Display icons next to file names.

       <b>--no-icons</b>
              Don’t display icons.  (Always overrides –icons)

</pre><h4><b>FILTERING</b> <b>AND</b> <b>SORTING</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-a</b>, <b>--all</b>
              Show hidden and “dot” files.  Use this twice to also show the `.' and `..'  directories.

       <b>-d</b>, <b>--list-dirs</b>
              List directories as regular files, rather than recursing and listing their contents.

       <b>-L</b>, <b>--level=DEPTH</b>
              Limit the depth of recursion.

       <b>-r</b>, <b>--reverse</b>
              Reverse the sort order.

       <b>-s</b>, <b>--sort=SORT_FIELD</b>
              Which field to sort by.

       Valid  sort  fields  are  `name',  `Name',  `extension', `Extension', `size', `modified', `changed', `ac‐
       cessed', `created', `inode', `type', and `none'.

       The modified sort field has the aliases `date', `time', and `newest',  and  its  reverse  order  has  the
       aliases `age' and `oldest'.

       Sort  fields  starting  with a capital letter will sort uppercase before lowercase: `A' then `B' then `a'
       then `b'.  Fields starting with a lowercase letter will mix them: `A' then `a' then `B' then `b'.

       <b>-I</b>, <b>--ignore-glob=GLOBS</b>
              Glob patterns, pipe-separated, of files to ignore.

       <b>--git-ignore</b> [if exa was built with git support]
              Do not list files that are ignored by Git.

       <b>--group-directories-first</b>
              List directories before other files.

       <b>-D</b>, <b>--only-dirs</b>
              List only directories, not files.

</pre><h4><b>LONG</b> <b>VIEW</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       These options are available when running with --long (-l):

       <b>-b</b>, <b>--binary</b>
              List file sizes with binary prefixes.

       <b>-B</b>, <b>--bytes</b>
              List file sizes in bytes, without any prefixes.

       <b>--changed</b>
              Use the changed timestamp field.

       <b>-g</b>, <b>--group</b>
              List each file’s group.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--header</b>
              Add a header row to each column.

       <b>-H</b>, <b>--links</b>
              List each file’s number of hard links.

       <b>-i</b>, <b>--inode</b>
              List each file’s inode number.

       <b>-m</b>, <b>--modified</b>
              Use the modified timestamp field.

       <b>-n</b>, <b>--numeric</b>
              List numeric user and group IDs.

       <b>-S</b>, <b>--blocks</b>
              List each file’s number of file system blocks.

       <b>-t</b>, <b>--time=WORD</b>
              Which timestamp field to list.  Valid timestamp fields are `modified', `changed', `accessed',  and
              `created'.

       <b>--time-style=STYLE</b>
              How  to  format  timestamps.   Valid timestamp styles are `default', `iso', `long-iso', and `full-
              iso'.

       <b>-u</b>, <b>--accessed</b>
              Use the accessed timestamp field.

       <b>-U</b>, <b>--created</b>
              Use the created timestamp field.

       <b>--no-permissions</b>
              Suppress the permissions field.

       <b>--no-filesize</b>
              Suppress the file size field.

       <b>--no-user</b>
              Suppress the user field.

       <b>--no-time</b>
              Suppress the time field.

       <b>-@</b>, <b>--extended</b>
              List each file’s extended attributes and sizes.

       <b>--git</b> [if exa was built with git support]
              List each file’s Git status, if tracked.

       This adds a two-character column indicating the staged and unstaged statuses  respectively.   The  status
       character  can be `-' for not modified, `M' for a modified file, `N' for a new file, `D' for deleted, `R'
       for renamed, `T' for type-change, `I' for ignored, and `U' for conflicted.

       Directories will be shown to have the status of their contents, which is how `deleted' is possible: if  a
       directory contains a file that has a certain status, it will be shown to have that status.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       exa responds to the following environment variables:

   <b>COLUMNS</b>
       Overrides the width of the terminal, in characters.

       For example, `COLUMNS=80 exa' will show a grid view with a maximum width of 80 characters.

       This option won’t do anything when exa’s output doesn’t wrap, such as when using the --long view.

   <b>EXA_STRICT</b>
       Enables <u>strict</u> <u>mode</u>, which will make exa error when two command-line options are incompatible.

       Usually, options can override each other going right-to-left on the command line, so that exa can be giv‐
       en  aliases:  creating  an alias `exa=exa --sort=ext' then running `exa --sort=size' with that alias will
       run `exa --sort=ext --sort=size', and the sorting specified by the user will override the sorting  speci‐
       fied by the alias.

       In strict mode, the two options will not co-operate, and exa will error.

       This  option is intended for use with automated scripts and other situations where you want to be certain
       you’re typing in the right command.

   <b>EXA_GRID_ROWS</b>
       Limits the grid-details view (`exa --grid --long') so it’s only activated when at least the given  number
       of rows of output would be generated.

       With  widescreen  displays,  it’s  possible for the grid to look very wide and sparse, on just one or two
       lines with none of the columns lining up.  By specifying a minimum number of rows, you can only  use  the
       view if it’s going to be worth using.

   <b>EXA_ICON_SPACING</b>
       Specifies the number of spaces to print between an icon (see the `--icons' option) and its file name.

       Different  terminals  display icons differently, as they usually take up more than one character width on
       screen, so there’s no “standard” number of spaces that exa can use to separate an icon  from  text.   One
       space  may place the icon too close to the text, and two spaces may place it too far away.  So the choice
       is left up to the user to configure depending on their terminal emulator.

   <b>LS_COLORS</b>, EXA_COLORS
       Specifies the colour scheme used to highlight files based on their name and kind, as well as highlighting
       metadata and parts of the UI.

       For more information on the format of these environment variables, see the <a href="../man5/exa_colors.5.html">exa_colors</a>(5) manual page.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUSES</b></h4><pre>
       0      If everything goes OK.

       1      If there was an I/O error during operation.

       3      If there was a problem with the command-line arguments.
