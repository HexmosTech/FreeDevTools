</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       pdftoipe - Convert PDF files into editable Ipe format

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>pdftoipe</b> { <u>options</u> } <u>PDF</u> <u>file</u> [ <u>XML</u> <u>file</u> ]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>pdftoipe</b> converts arbitrary PDF files to Ipe's XML format.

       Note  that  <b>pdftoipe</b>  is  not  related  to  Ipe's use of the PDF file format.  PDF files generated by Ipe
       contain an extra stream with Ipe markup information, which is necessary for Ipe to read the  file  again.
       If  you  wish to convert an Ipe-generated PDF-file to XML format, you should use <u>ipetoipe</u> <u>-xml</u>!  <b>pdftoipe</b>
       is meant to allow you to take arbitrary PDF files and make them editable in Ipe.

       <b>pdftoipe</b> does a pretty good job on drawings, but doesn't handle text very  well.   Ipe's  text  model  is
       based on LaTeX, which is just too different from the text found in most PDF files.

       <b>-notext</b>
              Ignore all text in the PDF file, convert graphics only

       <b>-literal</b>
              Allow Latex markup in text objects.  The default is to escape all characters special in Latex.

       <b>-math</b>  Use LaTeX math mode for all text in the PDF file

       <b>-merge</b> <u>int</u>
              Set  the  text  merge  level, an integer between 0 (the default) and 2.  It determines how eagerly
              <b>pdftoipe</b> tries to combine consecutive text in the PDF document into a single Ipe text object.   At
              level  0,  only  characters  consecutively  rendered in PDF are combined. At level 1, more text is
              combined.  At level 2, all text is combined until a path or image is drawn.

       <b>-unicode</b> <u>int</u>
              Determine what should be done with non-ASCII characters  in  text.   At  level  0,  all  non-ASCII
              characters are represented as <b>[U+XXX]</b>.  At level 1 (the default), some often used characters (such
              as  bullets)  are  replaced  by Latex equivalents, others are represented as <b>[U+XXX]</b>.  At level 2,
              characters that are not replaced by Latex equivalents are included in  UTF-8.   At  level  3,  all
              characters are included as UTF-8.

              At  level  2  and 3, UTF-8 is set as the input encoding in the Latex preamble of the generated Ipe
              document.

              Note that this only concerns characters for which the PDF file  provides  a  mapping  to  Unicode.
              Characters  from  embedded  fonts  without  Unicode  mapping  (such  as  symbol  fonts) are always
              represented as <b>[S+XX]</b>.

       <b>-f</b> <u>int</u> First page to convert

       <b>-l</b> <u>int</u> Last page to convert

       <b>-opw</b> <u>string</u>
              Owner password for encrypted PDF files

       <b>-upw</b> <u>string</u>
              User password for encrypted PDF files

       <b>-q</b>     Quiet mode (don't print any messages or errors)
