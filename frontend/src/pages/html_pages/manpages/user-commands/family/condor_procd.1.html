</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       condor_procd - HTCondor Manual

       Track and manage process families

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>condor_procd</b> <b>-h</b>

       <b>condor_procd</b> <b>-A</b> <u>address-file</u> [<b>options</b> ]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>condor_procd</u> tracks and manages process families on behalf of the HTCondor daemons. It may track families
       of  PIDs  via  relationships  such as: direct parent/child, environment variables, UID, and supplementary
       group IDs. Management of the PID families include

       • registering new families or new members of existing families

       • getting usage information

       • signaling families for operations such as suspension, continuing, or killing the family

       • getting a snapshot of the tree of families

       In a regular HTCondor installation, this program is not intended to be used or executed by any human.

       The required argument, <b>-A</b> <u>address-file</u>, is the path and file name of the address file which is the  named
       pipe that clients must use to speak with the <u>condor_procd</u>.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
          <b>-h</b>     Print out usage information and exit.

          <b>-D</b>     Wait for the debugger. Initially sleep 30 seconds before beginning normal function.

          <b>-C</b> <u>principal</u>
                 The  <u>principal</u>  is the UID of the owner of the named pipe that clients must use to speak to the
                 <u>condor_procd</u>.

          <b>-L</b> <u>log-file</u>
                 A file the <u>condor_procd</u> will use to write logging information.

          <b>-E</b>     When specified, another tool such as the <u>procd_ctl</u> tool must allocate the GID associated with a
                 process. When this option is not specified, the <u>condor_procd</u> will allocate the GID itself.

          <b>-P</b> <u>PID</u> If not specified, the <u>condor_procd</u> will use the <u>condor_procd</u> 's parent, which may not be PID  1
                 on  Unix,  as  the  parent  of  the <u>condor_procd</u> and the root of the tracking family.  When not
                 specified, if the <u>condor_procd</u> 's parent PID dies, the <u>condor_procd</u> exits. When specified,  the
                 <u>condor_procd</u> will track this <u>PID</u> family in question and not also exit if the PID exits.

          <b>-S</b> <u>seconds</u>
                 The  maximum  number of seconds the <u>condor_procd</u> will wait between taking snapshots of the tree
                 of families. Different clients to the <u>condor_procd</u> can specify different  snapshot  times.  The
                 quickest  snapshot  time  is  the  one  performed  by the <u>condor_procd</u>. When this option is not
                 specified, a default value of 60 seconds is used.

          <b>-G</b> <u>min-gid</u> <u>max-gid</u>
                 If the <b>-E</b> option is not specified, then track process families using a self-allocated, free GID
                 out of the inclusive range specified by <u>min-gid</u> and <u>max-gid</u>. This means that if a  new  process
                 shows  up  using  a previously known GID, the new process will automatically associate into the
                 process  family  assigned  that  GID.   If  the  <b>-E</b>  option  is  specified,  then  instead   of
                 self-allocating the GID, the <u>procd_ctl</u> tool must be used to associate the GID with the PID root
                 of  the  family.  The associated GID must still be in the range specified. This is a Linux-only
                 feature.

          <b>-K</b> <u>windows-softkill-binary</u>
                 This is the path and executable name of the <u>condor_softkill.exe</u> binary.  It  is  used  to  send
                 softkill signals to process families.  This is a Windows-only feature.

</pre><h4><b>DEALING</b> <b>WITH</b> <b>SHORT</b> <b>READS</b></h4><pre>
       For  unknown  reasons, on Linux, attemps to read the list of PIDs from the <a href="file:/proc">/proc</a> filesystem do not always
       return all of the PIDs on the system.  The <u>condor_procd</u> attempts to detect when this  occurs,  using  two
       methods.

       If  the list of PIDs does not include PID 1, the <u>condor_procd</u>'s own PID, or the PID of the <u>condor_procd</u>'s
       parent (which may be PID 1), then the list must be incomplete, and the <u>condor_procd</u>  immediately  retries
       the read.

       Additionally,  the  <u>condor_procd</u>  compares the number of PIDs it just read to the number of PIDs from the
       last time it (successfully) checked.  If the number is too much smaller,  it  immediately  retries.   The
       default  threshold  is  0.90,  meaning that if the current read has 90% or fewer of the last read's PIDs,
       it's considered invalid.  In our testing, this threshold  was  met  by  roughly  1  in  4000  reads,  but
       successfully  detected  all  real  short  reads.   If  you need to adjust the threshold, you may do so by
       setting the environment variable _CONDOR_PROCAPI_RETRY_FRACTION.  (In the normal case, simply have it  in
       the environment when the <u>condor_master</u> starts up.)

       If a retried read is incomplete (according to either method), the <u>condor_procd</u> returns the results of the
       previous read.

</pre><h4><b>GENERAL</b> <b>REMARKS</b></h4><pre>
       This  program  may be used in a stand alone mode, independent of HTCondor, to track process families. The
       programs <u>procd_ctl</u> and <u>gidd_alloc</u> are used with the <u>condor_procd</u> in stand alone mode to interact with the
       daemon and to inquire about certain state of running processes on the machine, respectively.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>condor_procd</u> will exit with a status value of 0 (zero) upon success, and it will exit with  the  value  1
       (one) upon failure.
