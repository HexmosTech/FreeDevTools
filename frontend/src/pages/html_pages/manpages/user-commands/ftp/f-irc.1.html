</pre><h4><b>COLORS</b></h4><pre>
       Available colors: black, blue, cyan, default, green, magenta, red, white, yellow.

</pre><h4><b>DICTIONARY</b></h4><pre>
       F-irc can, apart from channel/nick/command also do tab-completion on a configurable list of  words.  With
       "dictionary_file=..."  you can select a text-file with 2 or more columns. In the first column you put the
       word that f-irc needs to look for when pressing tab. Then  when  there's  a  match,  that  word  will  be
       replaced by what's in the 2nd (and 3d, etc.) column.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       When  F-IRC  is  started, you'll see a list of channels and servers on the right. On the left a large box
       with what is written by people. The line at the top is the topic of that channel  and  the  line  at  the
       bottom is where you write the things you would like to appear in the channels.

       If there's a reverse color border around the channel-list, then it is selected. That means that you can
       navigate through it with the cursor keys. Press right to enter a channel. Press right again on that
       channel to get a list of names in that channel. Press right once again to get a list of actions to
       perform on that user. Press left to exit the actions menu. Another left to return to the channel-list.
       Use up cursor/down cursor keys to navigate through the list. 'home' jumps to the top of the list, 'end'
       to the bottom.

       Press left on a server to "fold it": this hides the channels. Press the right cursor key to unfold it.
       When a server is not folded and it is already selected, press "right" again to get a menu with server-
       options: reconnect a server for example and disconnect it.

       In the "scroll back"/"search" windows you can press '/' to search in that window and 'w' to write the
       contents of a window to a file.

       <b>^X</b>     means: press ctrl key and press x while still holding ctrl.

       If the channel/name-list is selected, you can enter ^N: you can then move the cursor from right to left
       and back to navigate through the sentence you're typing. If the edit-line is selected, then the border
       around the names/channels is no longer reverse, also the '&gt;' left from- and the '&gt;' right from the edit
       line are in reverse video.

       If the edit-line is selected, you can press up cursor key and down left cursor key to browse through
       older lines you wrote. Also "home" and "end" work like they should.

       <b>^A</b>     moves  the cursor to the left, <b>^E</b> moves the cursor to the right <b>^D</b> deletes the character under the
              cursor. This is like how the bash-shell behaves.

       <b>^U</b>     Clear input line. Press second time to undo clear.

       If there's something new in a channel, a '*' is put in front of the server or channel name.

       <b>^Q</b>     jump to your next favorite channel (see the "favorite=... ..." configuration file parameter).

       <b>^W</b>     lets you jump to the next channel in which new lines were written.

       <b>^R</b>     like ^W but searching backwards

       <b>^Z</b>     lets you jump to the next channel in which your (nick-)name was mentioned

       <b>^X</b>     like ^Z but searching backwards

       <b>^T</b>     jump back to the previously selected channel

       <b>^O</b>     lets f-irc remove all the *'s

       <b>^F</b>     lets you scroll-back in what was written by others

       <b>^B</b>     lets you scroll-back in what you wrote. you can then select a line and press enter to copy  it  to
              your edit-line

       <b>^Y</b>     Enable/disable "only show channels with new messages".

       <b>^V</b>     Enter 1 character. Used when entering ascii values &lt; 32, e.g. ^B for bold.

       Press  <b>TAB</b> for auto-completion of commands (e.g. /TOPIC, /TIME, etc.) and nick names

       Press  <b>^G</b> to close a channel.

       Press  <b>^L</b> to redraw the screen.

       Press  <b>^C</b> to terminate the program. Or enter /EXIT (or /exit, commands are not case sensitive).

       When you enter:
              <b>@/...</b>  then /... is send
              <b>@@...</b>  then @... is send
              <b>@...</b>   then  the program will look for a channel/server with '...' in its name and then change the
              channel to that one. you can enter <b>^J</b> to let it jump to the next channel with that

       <b>^P</b>     add a markerline to the current channel

       <b>F2</b>     Store current configuration on disk

       <b>F3</b>     Add a new server

       <b>F4</b>     Switch to edit-line (shortcut for ^N)

       <b>F5</b>     Redraw screen

       <b>F6</b>     Search in all windows

       <b>F7</b>     Close all channels with only "NOTICE" messages. Those are most oftehn the channels  with  messages
              that come from bots and servers.

       <b>F8</b>     Configure f-irc

       <b>F9</b>     Undo the close of the last closed channel

       <b>F10</b> <b>^N</b> Toggle between channel-list, edit-line and word-cloud (if enabled)

       <b>F12</b>    Add markerline to all channels on all servers

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       Not  only  messages  but also commands can be entered in the line at the bottom. Above @... was mentioned
