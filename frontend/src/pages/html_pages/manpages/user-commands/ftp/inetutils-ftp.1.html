</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       ftp — ARPANET file transfer program

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ftp</b> [<u>option</u> <u>...</u>] [<u>user@host</u> [<u>port</u>]]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ftp</b>  is  the user interface to the ARPANET standard File Transfer Protocol.  The program allows a user to
       transfer files to and from a remote network site.  A <u>user</u> can be specified in the <u>host</u>  by  prefixing  it
       followed by an @.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Options may be specified at the command line, or to the command interpreter.

       <b>-4</b>, <b>--ipv4</b>
             Use IPv4 to connect to hosts.

       <b>-6</b>, <b>--ipv6</b>
             Use IPv6 to connect to hosts.

       <b>-A</b>, <b>--active</b>
             Enable active mode transfer, default for <b>ftp</b>.

       <b>-p</b>, <b>--passive</b>
             Enable passive mode transfer, default for <b>pftp</b>.

       <b>--prompt</b> [<u>text</u>]
             Print a command line prompt (optionally with <u>text</u>), even if not on a tty.

       <b>-N</b>, <b>--netrc</b> <u>filename</u>
             Select a specific initialization file.

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b>
             Verbose  option  forces <b>ftp</b> to show all responses from the remote server, as well as report on data
             transfer statistics.

       <b>-t</b>, <b>--trace</b>
             Enable packet tracing.

       <b>-d</b>, <b>--debug</b>
             Enables debugging.

       <b>-e</b>, <b>--no-edit</b>
             Disable command line editing.

       <b>-n</b>, <b>--no-login</b>
             Restrains <b>ftp</b> from attempting “auto-login” upon initial connection.  If auto-login is enabled,  <b>ftp</b>
             will  check  the  <u>.netrc</u>  (see  below) file in the user's home directory for an entry describing an
             account on the remote machine.  If no entry exists, <b>ftp</b> will prompt for the  remote  machine  login
             name  (default is the user identity on the local machine), and, if necessary, prompt for a password
             and an account with which to login.

       <b>-i</b>, <b>--no-prompt</b>
             Turns off interactive prompting during multiple file transfers.

       <b>-g</b>, <b>--no-glob</b>
             Disables file name globbing.

       <b>--usage</b>
             Display a short usage message.

       <b>-</b>?, <b>--help</b>
             Display a help list.

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--version</b>
             Display program version.

</pre><h4><b>OPERATION</b></h4><pre>
       The client host (with an optional prefixed user followed by an @) with which <b>ftp</b> is to communicate may be
       specified on the command line.  If this is done, <b>ftp</b> will immediately attempt to establish  a  connection
       to  an  FTP server on that host; otherwise, <b>ftp</b> will enter its command interpreter and await instructions
       from the user.  When <b>ftp</b> is awaiting commands from the user the prompt ‘ftp&gt;’ is provided  to  the  user.
       The following commands are recognized by <b>ftp</b>:

       <b>!</b> [<u>command</u> [<u>args</u>]]
                   Invoke an interactive shell on the local machine.  If there are arguments, the first is taken
                   to be a command to execute directly, with the rest of the arguments as its arguments.

       <b>$</b> <u>macro-name</u> [<u>args</u>]
                   Execute  the macro <u>macro-name</u> that was defined with the <b>macdef</b> command.  Arguments are passed
                   to the macro unglobbed.

       <b>account</b> [<u>passwd</u>]
                   Supply a supplemental password required by a remote system for access  to  resources  once  a
                   login has been successfully completed.  If no argument is included, the user will be prompted
                   for an account password in a non-echoing input mode.

       <b>append</b> <u>local-file</u> [<u>remote-file</u>]
                   Append a local file to a file on the remote machine.  If <u>remote-file</u> is left unspecified, the
                   local  file  name is used in naming the remote file after being altered by any <b>ntrans</b> or <b>nmap</b>
                   setting.  File transfer uses the current settings for <b>type</b>, <b>format</b>, <b>mode</b>, and <b>structure</b>.

       <b>ascii</b>       Set the file transfer <b>type</b> to network ASCII.  This is the default type.

       <b>bell</b>        Arrange that a bell be sounded after each file transfer command is completed.

       <b>binary</b>      Set the file transfer <b>type</b> to support binary image transfer.

       <b>bye</b>         Terminate the FTP session with the remote server and exit <b>ftp</b>.  An  end  of  file  will  also
                   terminate the session and exit.

       <b>case</b>        Toggle remote computer file name case mapping during <b>mget</b> commands.  When <b>case</b> is on (default
                   is  off),  remote computer file names with all letters in upper case are written in the local
                   directory with the letters mapped to lower case.

       <b>cd</b> <u>remote-directory</u>
                   Change the working directory on the remote machine to <u>remote-directory</u>.

       <b>cdup</b>        Change the remote machine working directory to the  parent  of  the  current  remote  machine
                   working directory.

       <b>chmod</b> <u>mode</u> <u>file-name</u>
                   Change the permission modes of the file <u>file-name</u> on the remote system to <u>mode</u>.

       <b>close</b>       Terminate the FTP session with the remote server, and return to the command interpreter.  Any
                   defined macros are erased.

       <b>cr</b>          Toggle  carriage return stripping during ascii type file retrieval.  Records are denoted by a
                   carriage return/linefeed sequence during ascii type  file  transfer.   When  <b>cr</b>  is  on  (the
                   default),  carriage  returns  are stripped from this sequence to conform with the Unix single
                   linefeed record delimiter.  Records on non-Unix remote systems may contain single  linefeeds;
                   when  an  ascii  type  transfer  is  made, these linefeeds may be distinguished from a record
                   delimiter only when <b>cr</b> is off.

       <b>delete</b> <u>remote-file</u>
                   Delete the file <u>remote-file</u> on the remote machine.

       <b>debug</b> [<u>debug-value</u>]
                   Toggle debugging mode.  If an optional <u>debug-value</u>  is  specified  it  is  used  to  set  the
                   debugging  level.   When debugging is on, <b>ftp</b> prints each command sent to the remote machine,
                   preceded by the string ‘--&gt;’

       <b>dir</b> [<u>remote-directory</u>] [<u>local-file</u>]
                   Print  a  listing  of  the  directory  contents  in  the  directory,  <u>remote-directory</u>,  and,
                   optionally,  placing  the  output  in  <u>local-file</u>.   If interactive prompting is on, <b>ftp</b> will
                   prompt the user to verify that the  last  argument  is  indeed  the  target  local  file  for
                   receiving  <b>dir</b>  output.   If  no directory is specified, the current working directory on the
                   remote machine is used.  If no local file is specified, or <u>local-file</u> is <b>-</b>, output  comes  to
                   the terminal.

       <b>disconnect</b>  A synonym for <u>close</u>.

       <b>epsv4</b>       Toggle the use of EPSV/EPRT for IPv4 addressing. Default is off.

       <b>form</b> <u>format</u>
                   Set the file transfer <b>form</b> to <u>format</u>.  The only supported format is “non-print”.

       <b>get</b> <u>remote-file</u> [<u>local-file</u>]
                   Retrieve  the  <u>remote-file</u>  and store it on the local machine.  If the local file name is not
                   specified, it is given the same name it has on the remote machine, subject to  alteration  by
                   the  current <b>case</b>, <b>ntrans</b>, and <b>nmap</b> settings.  The current settings for <b>type</b>, <b>form</b>, <b>mode</b>, and
                   <b>structure</b> are used while transferring the file.

       <b>glob</b>        Toggle filename expansion for <b>mdelete</b>, <b>mget</b> and <b>mput</b>.  If globbing is turned off  with  <b>glob</b>,
                   the  file  name arguments are taken literally and not expanded.  Globbing for <b>mput</b> is done as
                   in <u><a href="../man1/csh.1.html">csh</a></u>(1).  For <b>mdelete</b> and <b>mget</b>, each remote file name is expanded separately on the  remote
                   machine  and  the  lists  are  not  merged.   Expansion  of  a directory name is likely to be
                   different from expansion of the name of an ordinary file: the exact  result  depends  on  the
                   foreign  operating  system and ftp server, and can be previewed by doing ‘mls remote-files -’
                   Note: <b>mget</b> and <b>mput</b> are not meant to transfer entire directory subtrees of files.   That  can
                   be done by transferring a <u><a href="../man1/tar.1.html">tar</a></u>(1) archive of the subtree (in binary mode).

       <b>hash</b> [<u>size</u>]
                   Toggle  hash-sign  ("#")  printing for each data block transferred.  The <u>size</u> of a data block
                   can optionally be specified.  If not given, it defaults to 1024 bytes.

       <b>help</b> [<u>command</u>]
                   Print an informative message about the meaning of <u>command</u>.  If  no  argument  is  given,  <b>ftp</b>
                   prints a list of the known commands.

       <b>idle</b> [<u>seconds</u>]
                   Set the inactivity timer on the remote server to <u>seconds</u> seconds.  If <u>seconds</u> is omitted, the
                   current inactivity timer is printed.

       <b>image</b>       Set binary transfer type.

       <b>ipv4</b>        Select IPv4 as the only addressing scheme.

       <b>ipv6</b>        Select IPv6 as the only addressing scheme.

       <b>ipany</b>       Allow IPv4 as well as IPv6 addressing.

       <b>lcd</b> [<u>directory</u>]
                   Change  the working directory on the local machine.  If no <u>directory</u> is specified, the user's
                   home directory is used.

       <b>lpwd</b>        Print the name of the current working directory on the local machine.

       <b>ls</b> [<u>remote-directory</u>] [<u>local-file</u>]
                   Print a listing of the contents of a directory on the remote machine.  The  listing  includes
                   any  system-dependent  information that the server chooses to include; for example, most Unix
                   systems will produce output from the command ‘ls -l’.  (See also <b>nlist</b>.)  If <u>remote-directory</u>
                   is left unspecified, the current working directory is used.  If interactive prompting is  on,
                   <b>ftp</b> will prompt the user to verify that the last argument is indeed the target local file for
                   receiving  <b>ls</b>  output.  If no local file is specified, or if <u>local-file</u> is ‘<b>-</b>’, the output is
                   sent to the terminal.

       <b>macdef</b> <u>macro-name</u>
                   Define a  macro.   Subsequent  lines  are  stored  as  the  macro  <u>macro-name</u>;  a  null  line
                   (consecutive  newline  characters in a file or carriage returns from the terminal) terminates
                   macro input mode.  There is a limit of 16 macros and 4096 total  characters  in  all  defined
                   macros.   Macros  remain  defined  until  a  <b>close</b>  command is executed.  The macro processor
                   interprets '$' and '\' as special characters.  A '$' followed by a  number  (or  numbers)  is
                   replaced  by the corresponding argument on the macro invocation command line.  A '$' followed
                   by an 'i' signals that macro processor that the executing macro is  to  be  looped.   On  the
                   first  pass  '$i'  is replaced by the first argument on the macro invocation command line, on
                   the second pass it is replaced by the second argument, and so on.   A  '\'  followed  by  any
                   character  is  replaced  by  that character.  Use the '\' to prevent special treatment of the
                   '$'.

       <b>mdelete</b> [<u>remote-files</u>]
                   Delete the <u>remote-files</u> on the remote machine.

       <b>mdir</b> <u>remote-files</u> <u>local-file</u>
                   Like <b>dir</b>, except multiple remote files may be specified.  If interactive prompting is on, <b>ftp</b>
                   will prompt the user to verify that the last argument is indeed the  target  local  file  for
                   receiving <b>mdir</b> output.

       <b>mget</b> <u>remote-files</u>
                   Expand  the <u>remote-files</u> on the remote machine and do a <b>get</b> for each file name thus produced.
                   See <b>glob</b> for details on the filename expansion.  Resulting file names will then be  processed
                   according  to  <b>case</b>, <b>ntrans</b>, and <b>nmap</b> settings.  Files are transferred into the local working
                   directory, which can be changed with ‘lcd directory’; new local directories  can  be  created
                   with ‘! mkdir directory’.

       <b>mkdir</b> <u>directory-name</u>
                   Make a directory on the remote machine.

       <b>mls</b> <u>remote-files</u> <u>local-file</u>
                   Like  <b>nlist</b>,  except  multiple  remote  files  may  be  specified, and the <u>local-file</u> must be
                   specified.  If interactive prompting is on, <b>ftp</b> will prompt the user to verify that the  last
                   argument is indeed the target local file for receiving <b>mls</b> output.

       <b>mode</b> [<u>mode-name</u>]
                   Set the file transfer <b>mode</b> to <u>mode-name</u>.  The default mode is “stream” mode.

       <b>modtime</b> <u>file-name</u>
                   Show the last modification time of the file on the remote machine.

       <b>mput</b> <u>local-files</u>
                   Expand wild cards in the list of local files given as arguments and do a <b>put</b> for each file in
                   the  resulting  list.  See <b>glob</b> for details of filename expansion.  Resulting file names will
                   then be processed according to <b>ntrans</b> and <b>nmap</b> settings.

       <b>newer</b> <u>file-name</u>
                   Get the file only if the modification time of the remote file is more recent that the file on
                   the current system.  If the file does not exist on the current system,  the  remote  file  is
                   considered <b>newer</b>.  Otherwise, this command is identical to <u>get</u>.

       <b>nlist</b> [<u>remote-directory</u>] [<u>local-file</u>]
                   Print a  list of the files in a directory on the remote machine.  If <u>remote-directory</u> is left
                   unspecified, the current working directory is used.  If interactive prompting is on, <b>ftp</b> will
                   prompt  the  user  to  verify  that  the  last  argument  is indeed the target local file for
                   receiving <b>nlist</b> output.  If no local file is specified, or if <u>local-file</u> is <b>-</b>, the output  is
                   sent to the terminal.

       <b>nmap</b> [<u>inpattern</u> <u>outpattern</u>]
                   Set  or  unset  the  filename mapping mechanism.  If no arguments are specified, the filename
                   mapping mechanism is unset.  If arguments are specified, remote filenames are  mapped  during
                   <b>mput</b>  commands  and  <b>put</b>  commands  issued  without  a  specified remote target filename.  If
                   arguments are specified, local filenames are mapped during <b>mget</b>  commands  and  <b>get</b>  commands
                   issued  without a specified local target filename.  This command is useful when connecting to
                   a non-Unix remote computer with different file naming conventions or practices.  The  mapping
                   follows  the pattern set by <u>inpattern</u> and <u>outpattern</u>.  [<u>Inpattern</u>] is a template for incoming
                   filenames (which may have already been processed according to the <b>ntrans</b> and <b>case</b>  settings).
                   Variable  templating  is  accomplished  by  including  the sequences '$1', '$2', ..., '$9' in
                   <u>inpattern</u>.  Use '\' to prevent this special  treatment  of  the  '$'  character.   All  other
                   characters  are  treated  literally,  and are used to determine the <b>nmap</b> [<u>inpattern</u>] variable
                   values.  For example, given <u>inpattern</u> $1.$2 and the remote file name "mydata.data", $1  would
                   have  the  value "mydata", and $2 would have the value "data".  The <u>outpattern</u> determines the
                   resulting mapped filename.  The sequences '$1', '$2', ...., '$9' are replaced  by  any  value
                   resulting  from  the  <u>inpattern</u>  template.   The  sequence  '$0'  is  replace by the original
                   filename.  Additionally, the sequence ‘[<u>seq1</u>, <u>seq2</u>]’ is replaced by [<u>seq1</u>] if <u>seq1</u> is  not  a
                   null string; otherwise it is replaced by <u>seq2</u>.  For example, the command

                         nmap $1.$2.$3 [$1,$2].[$2,file]

                   would  yield  the  output  filename  "myfile.data"  for  input  filenames  "myfile.data"  and
                   "myfile.data.old", "myfile.file" for the input filename "myfile", and "myfile.myfile" for the
                   input filename ".myfile".  Spaces may be included in <u>outpattern</u>, as in the example: 'nmap  $1
                   sed  "s/   *$//"  &gt;  $1'  .   Use  the  '\'  character  to  prevent  special treatment of the
                   '$','[','[', and ',' characters.

       <b>ntrans</b> [<u>inchars</u> [<u>outchars</u>]]
                   Set or unset the filename character translation mechanism.  If no  arguments  are  specified,
                   the  filename  character  translation  mechanism  is  unset.   If  arguments  are  specified,
                   characters in remote filenames are translated during <b>mput</b> commands and  <b>put</b>  commands  issued
                   without  a specified remote target filename.  If arguments are specified, characters in local
                   filenames are translated during <b>mget</b> commands and <b>get</b> commands  issued  without  a  specified
                   local  target filename.  This command is useful when connecting to a non-Unix remote computer
                   with different file naming conventions or practices.  Characters in  a  filename  matching  a
                   character  in  <u>inchars</u>  are  replaced  with  the corresponding character in <u>outchars</u>.  If the
                   character's position in <u>inchars</u> is longer than the  length  of  <u>outchars</u>,  the  character  is
                   deleted from the file name.

       <b>open</b> <u>user@host</u> [<u>port</u>]
                   Establish  a  connection to the specified <u>host</u> FTP server.  An optional user may be supplied,
                   by prefixing it to the <u>host</u> followed by an @.  An optional port number may  be  supplied,  in
                   which case, <b>ftp</b> will attempt to contact an FTP server at that port.  If the <b>auto-login</b> option
                   is  on  (default),  <b>ftp</b>  will also attempt to automatically log the user in to the FTP server
                   (see below).

       <b>passive</b>     Toggle passive mode.  If passive mode is turned on (default is off), the ftp client will send
                   a PASV command for all data connections instead of the usual PORT command.  The PASV  command
                   requests that the remote server open a port for the data connection and return the address of
                   that port.  The remote server listens on that port and the client connects to it.  When using
                   the more traditional PORT command, the client listens on a port and sends that address to the
                   remote  server,  who  connects  back  to it.  Passive mode is useful when using <b>ftp</b> through a
                   gateway router or host that controls the directionality of traffic.  (Note  that  though  ftp
                   servers are required to support the PASV command by RFC 1123, some do not.)

       <b>prompt</b>      Toggle interactive prompting.  Interactive prompting occurs during multiple file transfers to
                   allow  the  user to selectively retrieve or store files.  If prompting is turned off (default
                   is on), any <b>mget</b> or <b>mput</b> will transfer all files, and any <b>mdelete</b> will delete all files.

       <b>proxy</b> <u>ftp-command</u>
                   Execute an ftp command on a secondary control connection.  This command  allows  simultaneous
                   connection  to  two  remote  ftp servers for transferring files between the two servers.  The
                   first <b>proxy</b> command should be an <b>open</b>, to establish the secondary control connection.   Enter
                   the  command "proxy ?" to see other ftp commands executable on the secondary connection.  The
                   following commands behave differently when prefaced by <b>proxy</b>: <b>open</b> will not define new macros
                   during the auto-login process, <b>close</b> will not erase existing macro definitions, <b>get</b> and  <b>mget</b>
                   transfer  files  from the host on the primary control connection to the host on the secondary
                   control connection, and <b>put</b>, <b>mput</b>, and <b>append</b> transfer files from the host on  the  secondary
                   control connection to the host on the primary control connection.  Third party file transfers
                   depend  upon  support of the ftp protocol PASV command by the server on the secondary control
                   connection.

       <b>put</b> <u>local-file</u> [<u>remote-file</u>]
                   Store a local file on the remote machine.  If <u>remote-file</u> is left unspecified, the local file
                   name is used after processing according to any <b>ntrans</b> or <b>nmap</b> settings in naming  the  remote
                   file.  File transfer uses the current settings for <b>type</b>, <b>format</b>, <b>mode</b>, and <b>structure</b>.

       <b>pwd</b>         Print the name of the current working directory on the remote machine.

       <b>quit</b>        A synonym for <b>bye</b>.

       <b>quote</b> <u>arg1</u> <u>arg2</u> <u>...</u>
                   The arguments specified are sent, verbatim, to the remote FTP server.

       <b>recv</b> <u>remote-file</u> [<u>local-file</u>]
                   A synonym for get.

       <b>reget</b> <u>remote-file</u> [<u>local-file</u>]
                   Reget  acts  like  get,  except  that  if  <u>local-file</u> exists and is smaller than <u>remote-file</u>,
                   <u>local-file</u> is presumed to be a partially transferred copy of <u>remote-file</u> and the transfer  is
                   continued  from the apparent point of failure.  This command is useful when transferring very
                   large files over networks that are prone to dropping connections.

       <b>rhelp</b> [<u>command-name</u>]
                   Request help from the remote FTP server.  If a <u>command-name</u> is specified it  is  supplied  to
                   the server as well.

       <b>rstatus</b> [<u>file-name</u>]
                   With  no arguments, show status of remote machine.  If <u>file-name</u> is specified, show status of
                   <u>file-name</u> on remote machine.

       <b>rename</b> [<u>from</u>] [<u>to</u>]
                   Rename the file <u>from</u> on the remote machine, to the file <u>to</u>.

       <b>reset</b>       Clear reply queue.  This command re-synchronizes command/reply sequencing with the remote ftp
                   server.  Resynchronization may be necessary following a violation of the ftp protocol by  the
                   remote server.

       <b>restart</b> <u>marker</u>
                   Restart  the  immediately  following  <b>get</b>  or  <b>put</b> at the indicated <u>marker</u>.  On Unix systems,
                   marker is usually a byte offset into the file.

       <b>rmdir</b> <u>directory-name</u>
                   Delete a directory on the remote machine.

       <b>runique</b>     Toggle storing of files on the local system with unique filenames.  If a file already  exists
                   with  a name equal to the target local filename for a <b>get</b> or <b>mget</b> command, a ".1" is appended
                   to the name.  If the resulting name matches another existing file, a ".2" is appended to  the
                   original  name.   If this process continues up to ".99", an error message is printed, and the
                   transfer does not take place.  The generated unique filename will  be  reported.   Note  that
                   <b>runique</b>  will not affect local files generated from a shell command (see below).  The default
                   value is off.

       <b>send</b> <u>local-file</u> [<u>remote-file</u>]
                   A synonym for put.

       <b>sendport</b>    Toggle the use of PORT commands.  By default, <b>ftp</b> will attempt to use  a  PORT  command  when
                   establishing  a  connection  for  each  data  transfer.  The use of PORT commands can prevent
                   delays when performing multiple file transfers.  If the PORT command fails, <b>ftp</b> will use  the
                   default data port.  When the use of PORT commands is disabled, no attempt will be made to use
                   PORT  commands  for each data transfer.  This is useful for certain FTP implementations which
                   do ignore PORT commands but, incorrectly, indicate they've been accepted.

       <b>site</b> <u>arg1</u> <u>arg2</u> <u>...</u>
                   The arguments specified are sent, verbatim, to the remote FTP server as a SITE command.

       <b>size</b> <u>file-name</u>
                   Return size of <u>file-name</u> on remote machine.

       <b>status</b>      Show the current status of <b>ftp</b>.

       <b>struct</b> [<u>struct-name</u>]
                   Set the file transfer <u>structure</u> to <u>struct-name</u>.  By default “stream” structure is used.

       <b>sunique</b>     Toggle storing of files on remote machine under unique file names.  Remote  ftp  server  must
                   support  ftp  protocol STOU command for successful completion.  The remote server will report
                   unique name.  Default value is off.

       <b>system</b>      Show the type of operating system running on the remote machine.

       <b>tenex</b>       Set the file transfer type to that needed to talk to TENEX machines.

       <b>trace</b>       Toggle packet tracing.

       <b>type</b> [<u>type-name</u>]
                   Set the file transfer <b>type</b> to <u>type-name</u>.  If no  type  is  specified,  the  current  type  is
                   printed.  The default type is network ASCII.

       <b>umask</b> [<u>newmask</u>]
                   Set  the  default  umask on the remote server to <u>newmask</u>.  If <u>newmask</u> is omitted, the current
                   umask is printed.

       <b>user</b> <u>user-name</u> [<u>password</u>] [<u>account</u>]
                   Identify yourself to the remote FTP server.  If the <u>password</u> is not specified and the  server
                   requires  it,  <b>ftp</b>  will  prompt the user for it (after disabling local echo).  If an <u>account</u>
                   field is not specified, and the FTP server requires it, the user will be prompted for it.  If
                   an <u>account</u> field is specified, an account command will be relayed to the remote server  after
                   the  login  sequence  is  completed  if  the remote server did not require it for logging in.
                   Unless <b>ftp</b> is invoked with “auto-login” disabled,  this  process  is  done  automatically  on
                   initial connection to the FTP server.

       <b>verbose</b>     Toggle verbose mode.  In verbose mode, all responses from the FTP server are displayed to the
                   user.   In  addition,  if verbose is on, when a file transfer completes, statistics regarding
                   the efficiency of the transfer are reported.  By default, verbose is on.

       ? [<u>command</u>]
                   A synonym for help.

       Command arguments which have embedded spaces may be quoted with quote '"' marks.

</pre><h4><b>ABORTING</b> <b>A</b> <b>FILE</b> <b>TRANSFER</b></h4><pre>
       To abort a file transfer, use the terminal interrupt key (usually Ctrl-C).   Sending  transfers  will  be
       immediately  halted.   Receiving  transfers  will be halted by sending a ftp protocol ABOR command to the
       remote server, and discarding any further data received.  The speed at which this is accomplished depends
       upon the remote server's support for ABOR processing.  If the remote server does  not  support  the  ABOR
       command,  an  ‘ftp&gt;’  prompt  will not appear until the remote server has completed sending the requested
       file.

       The terminal interrupt key sequence will be ignored when <b>ftp</b> has completed any local  processing  and  is
       awaiting  a  reply from the remote server.  A long delay in this mode may result from the ABOR processing
       described above, or from unexpected behavior by the  remote  server,  including  violations  of  the  ftp
       protocol.   If  the  delay  results from unexpected remote server behavior, the local <b>ftp</b> program must be
       killed by hand.

</pre><h4><b>FILE</b> <b>NAMING</b> <b>CONVENTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Files specified as arguments to <b>ftp</b> commands are processed according to the following rules.

       1.   If the file name ‘<b>-</b>’ is specified, the <u>stdin</u> (for reading) or <u>stdout</u> (for writing) is used.

       2.   If the first character of the file name is ‘|’, the remainder of the argument is  interpreted  as  a
            shell  command.   <b>ftp</b>  then  forks  a  shell,  using  <u><a href="../man3/popen.3.html">popen</a></u>(3) with the argument supplied, and reads
            (writes) from the stdout (stdin).  If the shell  command  includes  spaces,  the  argument  must  be
            quoted; e.g.  “" ls -lt"”.  A particularly useful example of this mechanism is: “dir more”.

       3.   Failing  the  above checks, if "globbing" is enabled, local file names are expanded according to the
            rules used in the <u><a href="../man1/csh.1.html">csh</a></u>(1); c.f. the <b>glob</b> command.  If the <b>ftp</b> command expects  a  single  local  file
            (.e.g.  <b>put</b>), only the first filename generated by the "globbing" operation is used.

       4.   For  <b>mget</b>  commands  and  <b>get</b>  commands with unspecified local file names, the local filename is the
            remote filename, which may be altered by a <b>case</b>, <b>ntrans</b>, or <b>nmap</b> setting.   The  resulting  filename
            may then be altered if <b>runique</b> is on.

       5.   For  <b>mput</b>  commands  and <b>put</b> commands with unspecified remote file names, the remote filename is the
            local filename, which may be altered by a <b>ntrans</b> or <b>nmap</b> setting.  The resulting filename  may  then
            be altered by the remote server if <b>sunique</b> is on.

</pre><h4><b>FILE</b> <b>TRANSFER</b> <b>PARAMETERS</b></h4><pre>
       The FTP specification specifies many parameters which may affect a file transfer.  The <b>type</b> may be one of
       “ascii”,  “image”  (binary),  “ebcdic”,  and  “local  byte size” (for PDP-10's and PDP-20's mostly).  <b>ftp</b>
       supports the ascii and image types of file transfer, plus local byte size 8 for <b>tenex</b> mode transfers.

       <b>ftp</b> supports only the default values for the remaining file transfer parameters: <b>mode</b>, <b>form</b>, and <b>struct</b>.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ftp</b> utilizes the following environment variables.

       HOME        For default location of a <u>.netrc</u> file, if one exists.

       NETRC       Alternate location of the <u>.netrc</u> file, taking precedence over the standard location.

       SHELL       For default shell.

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       <u><a href="../man8/ftpd.8.html">ftpd</a></u>(8), <u><a href="../man5/netrc.5.html">netrc</a></u>(5)

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>ftp</b> command appeared in 4.2BSD.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Correct execution of many commands depends upon proper behavior by the remote server.

       An error in the treatment of carriage returns in the 4.2BSD ascii-mode transfer code has been  corrected.
       This  correction  may  result in incorrect transfers of binary files to and from 4.2BSD servers using the
       ascii type.  Avoid this problem by using the binary image type.
