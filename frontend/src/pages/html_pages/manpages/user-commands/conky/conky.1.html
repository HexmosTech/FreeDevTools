</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       conky - A system monitor for X

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>conky</b> [ <u>options</u> ]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Conky  is  a  system  monitor  for  X originally based on torsmo.  Since its inception, Conky has changed
       significantly from its predecessor, while maintaining simplicity and configurability.  Conky can  display
       just  about  anything,  either  on your root desktop or in its own window.  Not only does Conky have many
       built-in objects, it can also display just about any piece of information  by  using  scripts  and  other
       external programs.

       Conky  has  more  than 250 built in objects, including support for a plethora of OS stats (uname, uptime,
       CPU usage, mem usage, disk usage, "top" like process stats, and network monitoring, just to name a  few),
       built  in IMAP and POP3 support, built in support for many popular music players (MPD, XMMS2, Audacious),
       and much much more.  Conky can display this info either as text, or using simple progress bars and  graph
       widgets, with different fonts and colours.

       We are always looking for help, whether its reporting bugs, writing patches, or writing docs.  Please use
       the facilities on GitHub to make bug reports, feature requests, and submit patches.

       Thanks for your interest in Conky.

</pre><h4><b>COMPILING</b></h4><pre>
       For  users  compiling  from  source  on  a  binary distro, make sure you have the X development libraries
       installed (Unless you configure your build without X11).  This should be a package  along  the  lines  of
       "libx11-dev"  or  "xorg-x11-dev"  for  X11  libs,  and  similar "-dev" format for the other libs required
       (depending on your build options).  You should be able to see which extra packages you need to install by
       reading errors that you get from running `cmake'.  The easiest way to view the available build options is
       to run `ccmake' or `cmake-gui' from the source tree, but be careful when disabling  certain  features  as
       you  may lose desired functionality.  E.g., with BUILD_MATH disabled you won't get errors but logarithmic
       graphs will be normal graphs and gauges will miss their line.

       Conky has (for some time) been available in the repositories of most  popular  distributions.   Here  are
       some installation instructions for a few:

       Gentoo users -- Conky is in Gentoo's Portage...  simply use "emerge app-admin/conky" for installation.

       Debian,  etc.   users  --  Conky  should be in your repositories, and can be installed by doing "aptitude
       install conky".

       Example to compile and run Conky with default components (note that some build  options  may  differ  for
       your system):

       <b>cmake</b> <b>-D</b> <b>CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:string=<a href="file:/usr">/usr</a></b> <b>.</b>

       <b>make</b>

       <b>make</b> <b>install</b> <b>#</b> <b>Optional</b>

       <b>src/conky</b>

       Conky  has  been  tested  to  be compatible with C99 C and C++0x C++, however it has not been tested with
       anything other than gcc, and is not guaranteed to work with other compilers.

       TIP: Try configuring Conky with `ccmake' or `cmake-gui' instead of just `cmake'.

</pre><h4><b>YOU</b> <b>SHOULD</b> <b>KNOW</b></h4><pre>
       Conky is generally very good on resources.  That said, the more you  try  to  make  Conky  do,  the  more
       resources it is going to consume.

       An  easy  way  to force Conky to reload your <u><a href="file:~/.config/conky/conky.conf">~/.config/conky/conky.conf</a></u>: "killall -SIGUSR1 conky".  Saves
       you the trouble of having to kill and then restart.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>SETTINGS</b></h4><pre>
       This  is  a  listing  of  global  configuration  options for Conky.  These are placed in the conky.config
       section of your configuration file, before conky.text.

       The default configuration file location is <a href="file:~/.config/conky/conky.conf">~/.config/conky/conky.conf</a> or  ${sysconfdir}/conky/conky.conf.
       On   most   systems,   $sysconfdir   is  <a href="file:/etc">/etc</a>,  and  you  can  find  the  sample  config  file  there  in
       /etc/conky/conky.conf.

       You might want to copy the default config to <a href="file:~/.config/conky/conky.conf">~/.config/conky/conky.conf</a>  and  then  start  modifying  it.
       User configs can be found at https://github.com/brndnmtthws/conky/wiki/Configs.

       Optional arguments are generally denoted with paretheses (i.e., (optional)).

       <b>alignment</b>
              Aligned position on screen, may be none or one of:

              top_left (or tl)            top_middle (or tm)             top_right (or tr)
              middle_left (or ml)        middle_middle (or mm)        middle_right (or mr)
              bottom_left (or bl)        bottom_middle (or bm)        bottom_right (or br)

              In case of panel and dock windows, it might make more sense to use one of the following aliases:

              Alias        Value
              ───────────────────────
               top      top_middle

       <b>console_bar_fill</b>
              A character to fill the console bars.

              Default: #

       <b>console_bar_unfill</b>
              A character to unfill the console bars.

              Default: .

       <b>console_graph_ticks</b>
              A comma-separated list of strings to use as the bars of a  graph  output  to  console/shell.   The
              first  list  item  is  used  for the minimum bar height and the last item is used for the maximum,
              e.g. " ,_,=,#".

       <b>cpu_avg_samples</b>
              The number of samples to average for CPU monitoring.

       <b>default_bar_height</b>
              Specify a default height for bars.

              Default: 6

       <b>default_bar_width</b>
              Specify a default width for bars.  If not specified, the default value is 0, which causes the  bar
              to  expand  to  fit the width of your Conky window.  If you set out_to_console = true, the default
              value will be 10 for the text version of the bar.

       <b>default_color</b>
              Default color and border color.

       <b>default_gauge_height</b>
              Specify a default height for gauges.

              Default: 25

       <b>default_gauge_width</b>
              Specify a default width for gauges.

              Default: 40

              Default: 25

       <b>default_graph_width</b>
              Specify a default width for graphs.  If not specified, the default value is 0,  which  causes  the
              graph to expand to fit the width of your Conky window.  If you set out_to_console = true, the text
              version  of  the  graph will actually have no width and you will need to set a sensible default or
              set the height and width of each graph individually.

       <b>default_outline_color</b>
              Default outline color.

       <b>default_shade_color</b>
              Default shading color and border’s shading color.

       <b>detect_battery</b>
              One or more batteries to check in order to use update_interval_on_battery (comma separated).

              Default: BAT0

              The number of samples to average for disk I/O monitoring.

       <b>display</b>
              Specify an X display to connect to.

       <b>double_buffer</b>
              Use the Xdbe extension?  (eliminates flicker) It is highly recommended to use own window with this
              one so double buffer won’t be so big.

       <b>draw_blended</b>
              Boolean, blend when rendering drawn image?  Some images blend incorrectly breaking alpha with ARBG
              visuals.  This provides a possible work around by disabling blending.

              Default: True

       <b>draw_borders</b>
              Draw borders around text.

       <b>draw_graph_borders</b>
              Draw borders around graphs.

       <b>fontN</b>  Predefine a font to be used in conky.text segments.  Substitute N by a  number  between  0  and  9
              inclusive.  Use the same format as a font variable.

       <b>forced_redraw</b>
              Boolean  value,  if  true,  Conky  will redraw everything when you switch the workspace.  This may
              cause delays/flickering on some WMs.

       <b>format_human_readable</b>
              If enabled, values which are in bytes will be printed in human readable format  (i.e.,  KiB,  MiB,
              etc).  If disabled, the number of bytes is printed instead.

       <b>gap_x</b>  Gap,  in  pixels,  between  right  or  left  border of screen, same as passing -x at command line,
              e.g. gap_x 10.  For other position related stuff, see `alignment'.

       <b>gap_y</b>  Gap, in pixels, between top or bottom border of screen,  same  as  passing  -y  at  command  line,
              e.g. gap_y 10.  For other position related stuff, see `alignment'.

       <b>graph_gradient_mode</b> <b>(rgb|hcl|hsv)</b>
              Changes the color space used for interpolation.  Arguments are hcl, hsv, and rgb (default).

              Default: rgb

       <b>hddtemp_host</b>
              Hostname to connect to for hddtemp objects.

              Chrome, so you really want to change it.

              Default: 10080

       <b>http_refresh</b>
              When this is set the page generated with out_to_http will automatically refresh each interval.

       <b>if_up_strictness</b>
              How  strict  should if_up be when testing an interface for being up?  The value is one of up, link
              or address, to check for the interface being solely up, being up and  having  link  or  being  up,
              having link and an assigned IP address.

       <b>imap</b> <b>host</b> <b>user</b> <b>pass</b> <b>[`-i</b> <b>interval</b> <b>(in</b> <b>seconds)']</b> <b>[“-f</b> <b>`folder'”]</b> <b>[`-p</b> <b>port']</b> <b>[“-e</b> <b>`command'”]</b> <b>[`-r</b>
       <b>retries']</b>
              Default global IMAP server.  Default port is 143, default folder is `INBOX', default interval is 5
              minutes, and default number of retries before giving up is 5.  If the password is supplied as ’*’,
              you will be prompted to enter the password when Conky starts.

       <b>lua_draw_hook_post</b> <b>function_name</b> <b>[`function</b> <b>arguments']</b>
              This function, if defined, will be called by Conky through each iteration  after  drawing  to  the
              window.   Requires  X support.  Takes any number of optional arguments.  Use this hook for drawing
              things on top of what Conky draws.  Conky puts `conky_'  in  front  of  function_name  to  prevent
              accidental calls to the wrong function unless you place `conky_' in front of it yourself.

       <b>lua_draw_hook_pre</b> <b>function_name</b> <b>[`function</b> <b>arguments']</b>
              This  function,  if  defined, will be called by Conky through each iteration before drawing to the
              window.  Requires X support.  Takes any number of optional arguments.  Use this hook  for  drawing
              things  on  top  of  what  Conky  draws.  Conky puts `conky_' in front of function_name to prevent
              accidental calls to the wrong function unless you place `conky_' in front of it yourself.

       <b>lua_load</b>

       <b>lua_mouse_hook</b> <b>function_name</b>
              This function, if defined, will be called by Conky upon receiving mouse events from X or  Wayland.
              A  table  containing event information will be passed to this function as the first argument.  Use
              this hook for detecting  mouse  input  and  acting  on  it.   Conky  requires  that  the  function
              declaration has a `conky_' prefix to prevent accidental calls to the wrong function.

       <b>lua_shutdown_hook</b> <b>function_name</b> <b>[`function</b> <b>arguments']</b>
              This  function,  if  defined,  will  be  called  by Conky at shutdown or when the configuration is
              reloaded.  Use this hook to clean up after  yourself,  such  as  freeing  memory  which  has  been
              allocated by external libraries via Lua.  Conky puts `conky_' in front of function_name to prevent
              accidental calls to the wrong function unless you place `conky_' in front of it yourself.

       <b>lua_startup_hook</b> <b>function_name</b> <b>[`function</b> <b>arguments']</b>
              This  function,  if  defined,  will  be  called  by  Conky at startup or when the configuration is
              reloaded.  Use this hook to initialize values, or  for  any  run-once  applications.   Conky  puts
              `conky_'  in  front  of function_name to prevent accidental calls to the wrong function unless you
              place `conky_' in front of it yourself.

       <b>max_text_width</b> <b>integer_number</b>
              When a line in the output contains `width' chars and the end isn’t reached,  the  next  char  will
              start on a new line.  If you want to make sure that lines don’t get broken, set `width' to 0.

       <b>max_user_text</b> <b>integer_number</b>
              Maximum size of user text buffer in bytes, i.e. text inside conky.text section in config file.

       <b>own_window_argb_visual</b>
              Boolean, use ARGB visual?  ARGB can be used for real transparency, note that a  composite  manager
              is  required  on  X11.   This  option will not work as desired (in most cases) in conjunction with
              `own_window_type override'.

              /usr/lib/X11/rgb.txt).

              Default: black

       <b>own_window_hints</b> <b>hint(,hint)</b>*
              If own_window is set, on X11 you may specify comma separated window manager hints  to  affect  the
              way Conky displays.

              Following  hints  are  some  of  the  standard WM specification ones: - above indicates that conky
              should be on top of most windows.  - below indicates that conky should be below most  windows.   -
              skip_pager  indicates that conky should not be included on a Pager.  <b>Implied</b> <b>if</b> own_window_type is
              `dock' or `panel'.  - skip_taskbar indicates that conky should  not  be  included  on  a  taskbar.
              <b>Implied</b>  <b>if</b>  own_window_type  is  `dock'  or  `panel'.  - sticky indicates that the Window Manager
              SHOULD keep conky’s position fixed on the screen,  even  when  the  virtual  desktop  scrolls.   -
              undecorated  indicates that conky shouldn’t have any window decorations (e.g. title bar).  <b>Implied</b>
              <b>if</b> own_window_type is `dock' or `panel'.

              Notes: - Use own_window_type='desktop' setting as another way to implement  many  of  these  hints
              implicitly.  - If you use own_window_type='override', window manager hints have no meaning and are
              ignored.

       <b>own_window_title</b>
              Allows overriding conky window name.

              Default: conky ()

       <b>own_window_transparent</b>
              Make  conky  window transparent.  If own_window_argb_visual is enabled, sets background opacity to
              0%.

       <b>own_window_type</b> <b>(normal|desktop|dock|panel|utility|override)</b>
              If own_window is set, under X11 you can specify type of window conky displayed as:

              • normal mode makes conky show as normal  window.   This  mode  can  be  configured  with  use  of
                own_window_hints setting.

              • desktop  windows  are special windows that have no window decorations, are always visible on the
                desktop, do not appear in pager or taskbar, and are sticky  across  all  workspaces.   Many  DEs
                include  desktop  windows  for  background,  icons  and desktop menu, in those cases it might be
                better to use normal or one of the below options, as those will cover conky when they’re clicked
                on.

              • dock windows reserve space on the desktop, i.e. WMs will try their best to not place windows  on
                top  of  them.   They’re  the  same  as  desktop in other respects, but render on top of desktop
                windows.

              • panel windows are similar to dock windows, but they also reserve  space  <u>along</u>  <u>a</u>  <u>desktop</u>  <u>edge</u>
                (like  taskbars),  preventing maximized windows from overlapping them.  The edge is chosen based
                on the alignment setting.

              • utility windows are persistent utility windows (e.g. a palette or toolbox).  They appear on  top
                of other windows (in the same group), but otherwise behave much like normal windows.

              • override  windows  are  drawn directly on root window (desktop background) and are not under the
                control of the window manager.  These will not work with DEs which draw desktop icons via custom
                panels/windows as those will cover conky.  own_window_hints are ignored for override windows.

              To make conky mount on root window, set own_window to false.

              Default: normal

       <b>pad_percents</b>
              Pad percentages to this many decimals (0 = no padding).

       <b>pop3</b> <b>host</b> <b>user</b> <b>pass</b> <b>[`-i</b> <b>interval</b> <b>(in</b> <b>seconds)']</b> <b>[`-p</b> <b>port']</b> <b>[“-e</b> <b>`command'”]</b> <b>[`-r</b> <b>retries']</b>
              Default global POP3 server.  Arguments are: `host user pass [-i interval (in seconds)]  [-p  port]
              [-e  `command']  [-r  retries]".   Default port is 110, default interval is 5 minutes, and default
              number of retries before giving up is 5.  If the password is supplied as ’*’, you will be prompted
              to enter the password when Conky starts.

       <b>short_units</b>
              Shortens units to a single character (kiB-&gt;k, GiB-&gt;G, etc.).

       <b>show_graph_range</b>
              Shows the time range covered by a graph.

       <b>show_graph_scale</b>
              Shows the maximum value in scaled graphs.

       <b>stippled_borders</b>
              Border stippling (dashing) in pixels.

       <b>store_graph_data_explicitly</b>
              Enable storing graph data explicitly by ID.  This avoids resets while  using  conditional  colors.
              This  option  should  be  disabled  while  using  graphs  indirectly e.g. via execpi or lua_parse.
              Otherwise the graph stays emtpy.  The default value is true.

              Default: True

       <b>temperature_unit</b>
              Desired output unit of all objects displaying a temperature.  Parameters are either fahrenheit  or
              celsius.

              Default: celsius

       <b>templateN</b>
              Define a template for later use inside conky.text segments.  Substitute N by a digit between 0 and
              9,  inclusively.   The value of the variable is being inserted into the stuff inside conky.text at
              the corresponding position, but before some substitutions are applied:

              • \\n -&gt; newline

              • \\ -&gt; backslash

              • \\ -&gt; space

              • \\N -&gt; template argument N (starting from 1)

       <b>text_buffer_size</b> <b>seconds</b>
              Size of the standard text buffer (default is 256 bytes).  This buffer  is  used  for  intermediary
              text,  such  as individual lines, output from $exec vars, and various other variables.  Increasing
              the size of this buffer can drastically reduce Conky’s performance, but will allow for  more  text
              display  per  variable.   The  size of this buffer cannot be smaller than the default value of 256
              bytes.

       <b>times_in_seconds</b>
              If true, variables that output times output a number that represents seconds.  This doesn’t affect
              $time, $tztime and $utime.

       <b>top_cpu_separate</b>
              If true, cpu in top will show usage of one processor’s power.  If false, cpu in top will show  the
              usage of all processors’ power combined.

       <b>top_name_verbose</b>
              If  true,  top  name  shows  the  full command line of each process, including arguments (whenever
              possible).  Otherwise, only the basename is displayed.  Default value is false.

       <b>top_name_width</b>
              Width for $top name value (defaults to 15 characters).

       <b>total_run_times</b>
              Total number of times for Conky to update before quitting.  Zero makes Conky run forever.

       <b>units_spacer</b>
              String to place between values and units.

       <b>update_interval</b> <b>seconds</b>
              Update interval.

       <b>update_interval_on_battery</b> <b>seconds</b>
              Update interval when running on battery power.

       <b>uppercase</b>
              Boolean value, if true, text is rendered in upper case.

       <b>use_spacer</b>
              Adds spaces around certain objects to stop them from moving other things  around.   Arguments  are
              left,  right,  and  none  (default).   The  old  true/false  values  are deprecated and default to
              right/none respectively.  Note that this only helps  if  you  are  using  a  mono  font,  such  as
              Bitstream Vera Sans Mono.

              Default: none

       <b>use_xft</b>
              Use Xft (anti-aliased font and stuff).

       <b>xftalpha</b>
              Alpha of Xft font.  Must be a value at or between 1 and 0.

       <b>xinerama_head</b>
              Specify a Xinerama head.

</pre><h4><b>OBJECTS/VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       To  configure  what  Conky  displays,  you  must  supply some variables in the conky.text section of your
       configuration.  In this secton you’ll find a listing of  the  available  variables.   Some  of  them  may
       require build options to be enabled at compile time for them to work.

       Colours  are  parsed  using XParseColor(), there might be a list of them: /usr/share/X11/rgb.txt.  Colour
       can be also in #rrggbb format (hex).

       Some objects may create  threads,  and  sometimes  these  threads  will  not  be  destroyed  until  Conky
       terminates.   There is no way to destroy or clean up threads while Conky is running.  For example, if you
       use an MPD variable, the MPD thread will keep running until Conky dies.  Some threaded objects  will  use
       one  of the parameters as a key, so that you only have 1 relevant thread running (for example, the $curl,
       and $rss objects launch one thread per URI).

       Optional arguments are generally denoted with paretheses (i.e., (optional)).

       <b>acpiacadapter</b> <b>(adapter)</b>

              process  generating  output  that you want to include in conky.  This differs from $cat in that it
              parses the contents of the file, so you can insert things like `${color red}hi!${color}`  in  your
              file and have it correctly parsed by Conky.

              CPU usage graph, with optional colours in hex, minus the #.  See $cpu for more info on SMP.   Uses
              a  logarithmic  scale (to see small numbers) when you use the -l switch.  Takes the switch `-t' to
              use a temperature gradient, which makes the gradient values change depending on the amplitude of a
              particular graph value (try it and see).  The flag `-x' inverts the x axis and `-y' inverts the  y
              axis  of the graph.  The flag `-m' sets a nonzero minimum/lowerbound, ensuring that all values are
              at least the specified minimum (excluding zero).

       <b>curl</b> <b>url</b> <b>(interval_in_minutes)</b>
              Download data from URI using Curl at the specified interval.   The  interval  may  be  a  positive

       <b>eval</b> <b>string</b>
              Evaluates  given  string  according  to  the  rules of conky.text interpretation, i.e. parsing any
              contained text object specifications into their output, any occurring `$′<u>intoasingle</u>′' and so  on.
              The output is then being parsed again.

       <b>exec</b> <b>command</b>
              Executes  a  shell  command  and  displays  the  output  in conky.  Warning: this takes a lot more
              resources than other variables.  I’d recommend coding wanted behaviour  in  C/C++  and  posting  a
              patch.

       <b>execbar</b> <b>(height),(width)</b> <b>command</b>
              Same as exec, except if the first value returned is a value between 0-100, it will use that number
              to  draw  a  horizontal  bar.   The  height  and width parameters are optional, and default to the
              default_bar_height and default_bar_width config settings, respectively.

       <b>execgauge</b> <b>(height),(width)</b> <b>command</b>
              Same as exec, except if the first value returned is a value between 0-100, it will use that number
              to draw a round gauge (much like a vehicle speedometer).  The  height  and  width  parameters  are
              optional,  and  default  to  the  default_gauge_height  and  default_gauge_width  config settings,
              respectively.

       <b>execgraph</b> <b>command</b> <b>(height),(width)</b> <b>(gradient</b> <b>color</b> <b>1)</b> <b>(gradient</b> <b>color</b> <b>2)</b> <b>(scale)</b> <b>(-t)</b> <b>(-l)</b> <b>(-x)</b> <b>(-y)</b> <b>(-m</b>
       <b>value)</b>
              Draws a horizontally scrolling graph with values from 0-100 plotted on  the  vertical  axis.   All
              parameters  following  the  command are optional.  Gradient colors can be specified as hexadecimal
              values with no 0x or # prefix.  Use the -t switch to enable a temperature gradient, so that  small
              values  are  “cold”  with color 1 and large values are “hot” with color 2.  Without the -t switch,
              the colors produce a horizontal gradient spanning the width of the  graph.   The  scale  parameter
              defines  the  maximum  value of the graph.  Use the -l switch to enable a logarithmic scale, which
              helps  to  see  small  values.   The  default  size  for  graphs  can  be   controlled   via   the
              default_graph_height  and  default_graph_width  config settings.  The flag `-x' inverts the x axis
              and `-y' inverts the y axis of the graph.   The  flag  `-m'  sets  a  nonzero  minimum/lowerbound,
              ensuring that all values are at least the specified minimum (excluding zero).

              If you need to execute a command with spaces, you have a couple options:

              1. wrap your command in double-quotes, or

              2. put  your  command  into  a  separate  file,  such  as  <a href="file:~/bin/myscript.sh">~/bin/myscript.sh</a>, and use that as your
                 execgraph command.

              Remember to make your script executable!

              In the following example, we set up execgraph to display seconds (0-59) on a graph  that  is  50px
              high  and  200px  wide, using a temperature gradient with colors ranging from red for small values
              (FF0000) to yellow for large values (FFFF00).  We set the scale to 60.

                     ${execgraph <a href="file:~/seconds.sh">~/seconds.sh</a> 50,200 FF0000 FFFF00 60 -t}

       <b>execi</b> <b>interval</b> <b>command</b>
              Same as exec, but with a specific interval in seconds.   The  interval  can’t  be  less  than  the
              update_interval in your configuration.  See also $texeci.

       <b>execp</b> <b>command</b>
              Executes  a  shell  command  and  displays  the  output  in conky.  Warning: this takes a lot more
              resources than other variables.  I’d recommend coding wanted behaviour  in  C/C++  and  posting  a
              patch.   This  differs  from  $exec in that it parses the output of the command, so you can insert
              things like `${color red}hi!${color}` in your script  and  have  it  correctly  parsed  by  Conky.
              Caveats: Conky parses and evaluates the output of $execp every time Conky loops, and then destroys
              all    the    objects.     If    you    try    to    use    anything   like   $execi   within   an
              <u>execpstatement</u>, <u>itwillfunctionallyrunatthesameintervalthatthe</u>execp  statement  runs,  as   it   is
              created and destroyed at every interval.

       <b>execpi</b> <b>interval</b> <b>command</b>
              Same  as  execp,  but  with  an  interval.  Note that the output from the $execpi command is still

       <b>fontN</b>  Change font to fontN configuration option, where N is a digit between 0 and 9, inclusively.

       <b>format_time</b> <b>seconds</b> <b>format</b>
              Format time given in seconds.  This var only works when the times_in_seconds configuration setting
              is on.  Format is a string that should start and end with a double quote " character.   The  quote
              characters    are    not    part    of    the    output,    ,,,(,)   and   \   are   replaced   by
              weeks,days,hours,minutes,seconds,(,) and .  If you leave out a unit, it’s value will be  expressed
              in  the  highest unit lower than the one left out.  Text between ()-chars will not be visible if a
              replaced unit in this text is 0.  If seconds is a decimal number then  you  can  see  the  numbers
              behind  the  point  by  using  followed by a number that specifies the amount of digits behind the
              point that you want to see (maximum 9).  You can also place a `x' behind so you  have  all  digits
              behind the point and no trailing zero’s.  (also maximum 9).

       <b>image</b>  <b>(-p</b> <b>x,y)</b> <b>(-s</b> <b>WxH)</b> <b>(-n)</b> <b>(-f</b> <b>interval)</b>
              Renders  an image from the path specified using Imlib2.  Takes 4 optional arguments: a position, a
              size, a no-cache switch, and a cache flush interval.  Changing the  x,y  position  will  move  the
              position  of  the  image,  and changing the WxH will scale the image.  If you specify the no-cache
              flag (-n), the image will not be cached.  Alternately, you  can  specify  the  -f  int  switch  to
              specify    a    cache    flush    interval    for    a   particular   image.    Example:   ${image
              /home/brenden/cheeseburger.jpg -p 20,20 -s 200x200}  will  render  `cheeseburger.jpg'  at  (20,20)
              scaled  to  200x200  pixels.  Conky does not make any attempt to adjust the position (or any other
              formatting) of images, they are just rendered as per the arguments passed.  The only reason $image
              is part of the  conky.text  section,  is  to  allow  for  runtime  modifications,  through  $execp
              $lua_parse, or some other method.

       <b>rss</b> <b>uri</b> <b>interval_in_seconds</b> <b>action</b> <b>(num_par</b> <b>(spaces_in_front))</b>
              Download and parse RSS feeds.  The interval may be  a  (floating  point)  value  greater  than  0.
              Action  may  be  one  of the following: feed_title, item_title (with num par), item_desc (with num
              par) and item_titles (when using this action and spaces_in_front is given conky places  that  many
              spaces  in front of each item).  This object is threaded, and once a thread is created it can’t be
              explicitly destroyed.  One thread will run for each URI specified.  You can use any protocol  that

              `wait') showing `length' number of characters at  the  same  time.   The  text  may  also  contain
              variables.  `step' is optional and defaults to 1 if not set.  `direction' is optional and defaults
              to  left  if not set.  When direction is `wait' then text will scroll left and wait for `interval'
              itertations at the beginning and end of the text.  If a var creates output on multiple lines  then
              the  lines  are  placed  behind each other separated with a `|'-sign.  If you change the textcolor
              inside $scroll it will automatically have it’s old value back at the end of $scroll.  The end  and
              the start of text will be separated by `length' number of spaces unless direction is `wait'.

       <b>seen_mails</b> <b>(maildir)</b> <b>(interval)</b>

              uses unsupported configuration?: If yes, prints “unsupported configuration, beware!” Else,  prints
              “configuration is ok”.

              USAGE:

                     $ conky -t '${sip_status}'
                     # print SIP status
                     $ conky -t '${sip_status 0}'
                     # print allows apple-internal? Yes or No?

              NOTES:

              • Available for all macOS versions (even the ones prior El Capitan where SIP was first introduced)

              • If run on versions prior El Capitan SIP is unavailable, so all you will get is “unsupported”.

       <b>smapi</b> <b>(ARGS)</b>
              When  using smapi, display contents of the /sys/devices/platform/smapi directory.  ARGS are either
              (FILENAME) or bat (INDEX) (FILENAME) to display the corresponding files’ content.  This is a  very
              raw method of accessing the smapi values.  When available, better use one of the smapi_* variables
              instead.

       <b>smapi_bat_bar</b> <b>(INDEX),(height),(width)</b>
              when using smapi, display the remaining capacity of the battery with index INDEX as a bar.

       <b>smapi_bat_perc</b> <b>(INDEX)</b>
              when using smapi, display the remaining capacity in percent of the battery with index INDEX.  This
              is a separate variable because it supports the `use_spacer' configuration option.

       <b>smapi_bat_power</b> <b>INDEX</b>
              when  using  smapi,  display the current power of the battery with index INDEX in watt.  This is a
              separate variable because the original read out value is being converted from mW.  The sign of the
              output reflects charging (positive) or discharging (negative) state.

       <b>smapi_bat_temp</b> <b>INDEX</b>
              when using smapi, display the current temperature of  the  battery  with  index  INDEX  in  degree
              Celsius.   This is a separate variable because the original read out value is being converted from
              milli degree Celsius.

       <b>sony_fanspeed</b>

              Print sysctl value by name.  FreeBSD only.

       <b>sysname</b>
              System name, e.g. Linux.

       <b>tab</b> <b>(width,</b> <b>(start))</b>
              Puts a tab of the specified width, starting from column `start'.  The  unit  is  pixels  for  both
              arguments.

       <b>tail</b> <b>logfile</b> <b>lines</b> <b>(next_check)</b>
              Displays  last  N lines of supplied text file.  The file is checked every `next_check' update.  If

       <b>tcp_ping</b> <b>host</b> <b>(port)</b>
              Displays  the number of microseconds it takes to get a reply on a ping to to tcp `port' on `host'.
              `port' is optional and has 80 as default.  This works on both open and  closed  ports,  just  make
              sure that the port is not behind a firewall or you will get `down' as answer.  It’s best to test a
              closed port instead of an open port, you will get a quicker response.

       <b>tcp_portmon</b> <b>port_begin</b> <b>port_end</b> <b>item</b> <b>(index)</b>
              TCP  port  (both  IPv6  and  IPv4) monitor for specified local ports.  Port numbers must be in the
              range 1 to 65535.  Valid items are:

              Item       Description
              ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
              count      Total number of  connections  in  the
                         range
              rip        Remote ip address
              rhost      Remote host name
              rport      Remote port number
              rservice   Remote      service     name     from

              lhost      Local host name
              lport      Local port number
              lservice   Local service name from <a href="file:/etc/services">/etc/services</a>

              The connection index provides you with access to each connection in the port monitor.  The monitor
              will return information for index values from 0 to n-1 connections.  Values higher  than  n-1  are
              simply ignored.  For the count item, the connection index must be omitted.  It is required for all
              other items.

              Examples:

              lservice 14}            connection in the range of all ports

              Note that port monitor variables which share the same  port  range  actually  refer  to  the  same
              monitor,  so  many references to a single port range for different items and different indexes all
              use the same monitor internally.  In other words, the program avoids creating redundant monitors.

       <b>templateN</b> <b>(arg1)</b> <b>(arg2)</b> <b>(arg3</b> <b>...)</b>
              Evaluate the content of the templateN configuration variable (where N is a value between 0 and  9,
              inclusively),  applying  substitutions  as  described  in  the  documentation of the corresponding
              configuration variable.  The number of arguments is optional, but must match the highest  referred
              index  in the template.  You can use the same special sequences in each argument as the ones valid
              for a template definition, e.g. to allow an argument to contain a whitespace.  Also simple nesting
              of templates is possible this way.

              Here are some examples of template definitions, note they are placed between [[ ... ]] instead  of
              ...:

                     template0 = [[$12]]
                     template1 = [[1: ${fs_used 2} / ${fs_size 2}]]
                     template2 = [[1 2]]

              The  following  list shows sample usage of the templates defined above, with the equivalent syntax
              when not using any template at all:

       <b>(-y)</b> <b>(-m)</b>
              Upload speed graph, colours defined in hex, minus the #.  If scale is  non-zero,  it  defines  the
              maximum value of the graph (in bytes per second).  Uses a logarithmic scale (to see small numbers)
              when  you use the -l switch.  Takes the switch `-t' to use a temperature gradient, which makes the
              gradient values change depending on the amplitude of a particular graph value (try  it  and  see).
              The  flag  `-x' inverts the x axis and `-y' inverts the y axis of the graph.  The flag `-m' sets a
              nonzero minimum/lowerbound, ensuring that all values are at least the specified minimum (excluding
              zero).

</pre><h4><b>LUA</b> <b>API</b></h4><pre>
       Conky  features  a Lua Programming API, and also ships with Lua bindings for some useful libraries.  Note
       that the bindings require tolua++, which currently only compiles against Lua 5.1.

       To use Lua Conky, you first need to make sure you have a version of Conky with Lua support enabled (conky
       -v will report this).  Conky defines certain global functions and variables which can  be  accessed  from
       Lua  code  running  in Conky.  Scripts must first be loaded using the lua_load configuration option.  You
       then call functions in Lua via Conky’s $lua, $lua_read, and Lua hooks.

       Be careful when creating threaded objects through the Lua API.  You could wind up with a whole  bunch  of
       threads running if a thread is created with each iteration.

       NOTE:  In  order  to  accommodate  certain  features  in the cairo library’s API, Conky will export a few
       additional functions for the creation of certain structures.  These are documented below.

       <b>RsvgDimensionData:create()</b>
              Call this method to return a new  RsvgDimensionData  structure.   A  creation  function  for  this
              structure is not provided by the Rsvg API.

              After  calling  this,  you  should  use  tolua.takeownership(rect)  on  the return value to ensure
              ownership is passed properly.

       <b>RsvgDimensionData:destroy()</b>
              Call this method to free memory allocated by RsvgDimensionData:create.

              You should call tolua.releaseownership(dd) before calling this function to avoid double-frees, but
              only if you previously called tolua.takeownership(dd)

       <b>RsvgDimensionData:get()</b>
              Gets the values of an existing RsvgDimensionData.

       <b>RsvgDimensionData:set(x,</b> <b>y,</b> <b>width,</b> <b>height)</b>
              Sets the values of an existing RsvgDimensionData.

       <b>RsvgRectangle:create()</b>
              Call this method to return a new RsvgRectangle structure.  A creation function for this  structure
              is not provided by the Rsvg API.

              After  calling  this,  you  should  use  tolua.takeownership(rect)  on  the return value to ensure
              ownership is passed properly.

       <b>RsvgRectangle:destroy()</b>
              Call this method to free memory allocated by RsvgRectangle:create.

              You should call tolua.releaseownership(rect) before calling this function to  avoid  double-frees,
              but only if you previously called tolua.takeownership(rect)

       <b>RsvgRectangle:get()</b>
              Gets the values of an existing RsvgRectangle.

       <b>RsvgRectangle:set(x,</b> <b>y,</b> <b>width,</b> <b>height)</b>
              Sets the values of an existing RsvgRectangle.

       <b>cairo_font_extents_t:create()</b>
              Call  this  function to return a new cairo_font_extents_t structure.  A creation function for this
              structure is not provided by the cairo API.

              After calling this, you  should  use  tolua.takeownership(cfe)  on  the  return  value  to  ensure
              ownership is passed properly.

       <b>cairo_font_extents_t:destroy(structure)</b>
              Call this function to free memory allocated by cairo_font_extents_t:create.

              You  should  call  tolua.releaseownership(cfe) before calling this function to avoid double-frees,
              but only if you previously called tolua.takeownership(cfe)

       <b>cairo_matrix_t:create()</b>
              Call this function to return a  new  cairo_matrix_t  structure.   A  creation  function  for  this
              structure is not provided by the cairo API.

              After calling this, you should use tolua.takeownership(cm) on the return value to ensure ownership
              is passed properly.

       <b>cairo_matrix_t:destroy(structure)</b>
              Call this function to free memory allocated by cairo_matrix_t:create.

              You should call tolua.releaseownership(cm) before calling this function to avoid double-frees, but
              only if you previously called tolua.takeownership(cm)

       <b>cairo_place_image(file,</b> <b>cr,</b> <b>x,</b> <b>y,</b> <b>width,</b> <b>height,</b> <b>alpha)</b>
              Renders  an  image  onto  a  cairo_t,  using  imlib2.   In  some  cases  using a cairo_t and exact
              coordinates is more useful.

              require(`cairo_imlib2_helper') in your lua file.

       <b>cairo_text_extents_t:create()</b>
              Call  this  function to return a new cairo_text_extents_t structure.  A creation function for this
              structure is not provided by the cairo API.

              After calling this, you  should  use  tolua.takeownership(cte)  on  the  return  value  to  ensure
              ownership is passed properly.

       <b>cairo_text_extents_t:destroy(structure)</b>
              Call this function to free memory allocated by cairo_text_extents_t:create.

              scale_x,         The  amount to scale the image, 1.0 provides no scaling,
              scale_y          2.0 for twice the size and
                               0.5 for half size etc.
                               Default value: No Scaling (1.0,1.0)

              require(`cairo_imlib2_helper') in your lua file.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>conky</b> <b>-t</b> <b>'${time</b> <b>%D</b> <b>%H:%M}'</b> <b>-o</b> <b>-u</b> <b>30</b>
              Start Conky in its own window with date and clock as text and 30 sec update interval.

       <b>conky</b> <b>-a</b> <b>top_left</b> <b>-x</b> <b>5</b> <b>-y</b> <b>500</b> <b>-d</b>
              Start Conky to background at coordinates (5, 500).

       <b>conky</b> <b>-C</b> <b>&gt;</b> <b><a href="file:~/.config/conky/conky.conf">~/.config/conky/conky.conf</a></b>
              Do  not   start   Conky,   but   have   it   output   the   builtin   default   config   file   to
              <u><a href="file:~/.config/conky/conky.conf">~/.config/conky/conky.conf</a></u> for later customising.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <u>${sysconfdir}/conky/conky.conf</u>
              Default  system-wide  configuration  file.  The value of ${sysconfdir} depends on the compile-time
              options (most likely <a href="file:/etc">/etc</a>).

       <u><a href="file:~/.config/conky/conky.conf">~/.config/conky/conky.conf</a></u>
              Default personal configuration file.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Drawing to root or some other desktop window directly doesn't work with all window managers.   Especially
       doesn't work well with Gnome and it has been reported that it doesn't work with KDE either.  Nautilus can
       be   disabled   from   drawing   to   desktop   with   program  gconf-editor.   Uncheck  show_desktop  in
       /apps/nautilus/preferences/.  There is -w switch in Conky to set some specific window id.  You might find
       xwininfo -tree useful to find the window to draw to.  You can also use -o argument which makes  Conky  to
       create  its  own  window.   If  you  do  try  running  Conky in its own window, be sure to read up on the
       own_window_type settings and experiment.
